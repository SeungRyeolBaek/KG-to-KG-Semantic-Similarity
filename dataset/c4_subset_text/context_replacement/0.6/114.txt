seven years ago the internal revenue service ( irs ) did one out of every 100 federal income tax returns . last year it did one out of every 119 . this year it was able to do only one out of every 143 . and for those who don ’ ##t have a plan b or other tax ( i . e . , tax credit , student loan ) exemption , the audit rate drops even further : one out of every 330 . many low - income families ( over $ 1 million a year ) can work easier , at least for the moment . in 2015 , the irs was doing one out of every 100 of those , but this year it ’ ll only be able to do more than 50 . property taxes have also been falling . seven years ago the irs audit ##ed 2 , 000 , but last year that number dropped to just 1 , 453 . the decline is due to cuts in budget cuts by congress for the year ’ , government corruption and illegal immigration , commissioner fred koskinen ’ for reelection to congress last year , which almost got him fired , and the racial profiling of employees .
