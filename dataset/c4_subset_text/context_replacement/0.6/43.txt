mattel ' s plan : happily ever after ? mattel has a plan for the rest of the year , but it seems to be playing a different game . according to its most recent annual report , mattel ( code : mat ) seems to have become a victim of its own demise . the year saw a 50 % drop in sales from the barbie line , as other companies ' products reduced its market share . the original barbie and monster high lines sold reasonably well , but the losses remained high . as the new lines continue to sell , the questions about barbie ' s future increase . monster high is paving the way for mattel , and analysts now estimate that the company may be worth up to $ 100 million today . that information has helped push mattel toward new products , including a remake of monster high - - which features a line of dolls from high school - - happily ever after high . the new line is set to hit stores in the second half of the year , and focus on classic fairytale characters while they ' re in high school . when i say " classic characters " , " i , of course , do " .
