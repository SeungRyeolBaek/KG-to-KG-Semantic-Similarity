martin sheen and robert di niro will star for the first time in 2017 . martin sheen ' s " chinatown " would have been his 20 - year - old breakthrough film , but it was largely ignored by critics , grossing only $ 10 million in the u . s . on a $ 15 million budget . something tells me the same audience won ' t see the director ' s next film , which has an even bigger budget and more stars . jack nicholson and leonardo dicaprio in " the departed " nicholson has built his career on classic gangster films , from " goodfellas " to " chinatown , " " mean streets " and " the godfather , " and his return to the screen after more than a decade is cause for celebration . " the departed " is based on the 2003 book " i bet you burned it " by michael brandt , which details the years that " the irish " sheeran lived as a # ##ster . brandt interviewed sheeran over a three - year period , during which the singer admitted to being involved in more than 100 murders
