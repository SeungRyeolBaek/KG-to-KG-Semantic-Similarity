when determining which planet the earth could support life , one must follow the rules . exoplanets with rocky interiors are likely planets if they are distant enough from their star to potentially support life . but as our human population increases , and opportunities for finding them increase , many astrobiologists think it is time to expand the list . david mckay of the ’ nasa ames research center in california has come up with a " “ model ” for planets , which also includes factors like possible planet ’ , orbital speed , temperature , and chemical composition ( pnas , nasa & ieee ; 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1304212111 ) . some planets can be determined directly from measuring the planet ’ its chemical composition and distance from its parent star . others would require studying the planets and measuring their mass . models with those parameters are still being developed . “ that doesn ’ t mean we are ready to do it yet , but the list has been very interesting and very interesting , ” by david smith of stanford university . the list will one day include planets that
