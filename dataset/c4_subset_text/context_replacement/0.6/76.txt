u . s . president george bush spoke to me sept . 22 , 1992 upon entering the white house in washington . speaking of politics , most people would agree that the late president george h . w . bush , had all the most outstanding qualities of a human being , and of an individual . i ’ am just going to list here all the highlights of his many years of service to our nation . you will have heard it all on facebook and on twitter , and have seen it on the news the past few days . what i remember most about george bush is that he was a good man . it ’ is not an insult to say this election season was such a success . also , he loved his late wife barbara from the day they met until his last breath . even in the position of serving as president of the free world , he would have decency and be a true gentleman . i remember the victory in the first gulf war , and how he led the largest coalition of forces from around the world to drive saddam hussein out of iraq . this was done , in part , because of the dam they had built .
