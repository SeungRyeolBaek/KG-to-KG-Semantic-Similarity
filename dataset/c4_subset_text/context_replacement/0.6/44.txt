harry connolly ' s twenty palaces series is one of my favorite ongoing series in fantasy fiction . after a several year hiatus , connolly brought back ray lilly , and all the characters from the twisted path . the twenty palaces series is the story of ray lilly , a normal human turned into a carpenter ' s apprentice , a wooden man . it is lilly ' s job to hunt down creatures from the underworld and beyond , while his wife annalise destroys them with her dark magic . they work on saving the world from some very dangerous creatures that have crossed over . wooden men aren ' t supposed to have more than one master , but somehow ray keeps on surviving . the twenty palaces team has taken over and sends lilly and annalise to investigate , this does not go well . ray ' s lovecraft - ian / poe - like writing and world ##view are fascinating . i have read many of his novels and stories , but none have been as successful as the twisted path . if you are new to this series , i would recommend starting with ring of fire , the which was also ray ' s first novel .
