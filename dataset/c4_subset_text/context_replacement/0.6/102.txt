however , coaches and players - - not just players - - need to wrap up their lives before disaster strikes . if you follow me on social media ( the presence of my large number of followers shows that ’ is true ) you know i ’ ve been vocal about my concern with the outcome of several high school football games this season . this has affected , and even changed , the outcome of those games . my concern hasn ’ t only been with the calls that have to be handled carefully ( those calls ) , but also with the players . i have often gotten into kick offs , penalties ( the team can ’ easily be stopped on the goal line in time – that ’ is called ) , ups and downs . the latter can involve inexperienced , often undertrained officials . however , there are reasons for the abuse . who in the heck would want to be an umpire for ? a hundred dollars a week isn ’ t much , but do you want to be the victim of constant verbal abuse for two years ? - sports management 101 : why all the money ?
