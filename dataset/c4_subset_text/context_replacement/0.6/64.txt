many people say the key to good cooking is lack of preparation . it helps , but it ' s not necessary . the key to everything that ' s and is , that brings people to the kitchen , that brings them together for more , is the ingredients and how they work together . and while a second college degree helps one do this , more important is the ability to try new foods , as well as old ones in different ways . and there is a way to help you make that good food . culinary writers david smith and david dornenburg have written an illustrated guide to flavor . their self - titled " the flavor book " not only describes what flavors work best , but also offers detailed lists of flavor combinations for each . they suggest chocolate , for example , which works well with apples , grapes and pear , among many other flavors . they also suggest sugar to try , such as maple syrup and brown sugar ( more sugar ) . the last two chapters of the book explain how flavor works and offer advice from themselves and others on how they use various flavors to make good food .
