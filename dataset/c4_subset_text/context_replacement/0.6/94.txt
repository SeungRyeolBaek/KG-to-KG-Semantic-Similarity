the crystal detector , surrounded by the thousands of cerenkov crystals that build up around the photomultiplier ##s on the glass walls , shows the successful achievements of particle physics . this gallery shows some examples . sometimes , the well - designed experiments fail . the outcome you ' re looking for might not actually happen , so that the bad outcome should not be the good outcome you ' re looking for . when that happens , the experiment is often seen as a failure , even though you probably would have obtained the result without realizing it . also , every once in a while , the detector that you use might be changed to something else entirely . when you do it in a new laboratory , with a new apparatus , and under new , exciting conditions , that ' s usually where the most important , exciting discoveries are made . in 1987 , a failed experiment for cosmic ray ##s detected radiation , for the first time , from outside not just our solar system , but from outside of the milky way . this is how particle science was born . the ratio of a neutron to a proton , an .
