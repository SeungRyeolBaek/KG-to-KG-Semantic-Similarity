a report this year by axios cited documents from within the national security council suggesting the possibility — possibility , even — of a 5g network owned and operated by the u . s . government . we have since shed some light on this possibility , and unfortunately , it was never considered . in addition , the documents cited by axios suggest that the only way to successfully build the next generation of wireless networks , on which an infrastructure like self - driving vehicles would rely , against threats by nsa and others , would be for the government to build that network itself . there are some things wrong with this idea . you probably heard of a company before you ever came to this country . that would be impossible , since those companies , along with others around the world , are going into the process of developing and operating 5g networks . the idea of a wireless network operating independently and in partnership with the private sector doesn ’ t tread lightly ( we ’ ve heard it before ) . even if it was possible , there ’ is absolutely no evidence that the u . s . exists , even at its deepest and highest .
