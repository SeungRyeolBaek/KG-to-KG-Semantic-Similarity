im definetely with all of the blog posts when saying that they left the good stuff out . i thought up until now that this was going to be the last season . after watching the last season , i could imagine another and better season . how good that the show was . … . . i had so much fun with the help of the other writers for all the shows ! i am going to miss the whole cast . what a mess . ! jesus ! i had no idea the show was out ! ! ! this sucks ! ! ! ! why did they cancel the good shows and cancel the bad ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? so sad to see these writers say goodbye to these shows , this show needs time to grow and to hire some new writers . depressing i figured out how to do this after watching the show , but this didn ’ t feel like a goodbye , … more like a final good - bye . this show was one of the best they have done in a long time . it was a great show , but that show was gone , it made me sad . couldn ’ ##t they not have remodled it again ? !
