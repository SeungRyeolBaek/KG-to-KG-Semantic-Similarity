i ran away from home at the age of 40 . it was a house i had wanted for a long time , long past when i lived a few blocks away . i finally got my money and was able to buy it . it was surrounded by large , beautiful trees ; the treehouse had been made from the trunk of a large oak tree . an oak tree filled with fruit during the summer . i was single at the time , and my ex - husband and i added a new dimension to the house , both the exterior of the house , and the interior . we spent hours in the garden creating new plants , planting new trees . the places we visit seem to change the way we are living . we turn a corner and connect with the world . i got married while living in the backyard surrounded by trees . while married , i dealt with a number of romantic relationships , all of them difficult and painful . i once adopted a little boy and raised him into adulthood , turning the treehouse into his home . his daughter was squirmy , and he and my daughter , sadie , chased each other .
