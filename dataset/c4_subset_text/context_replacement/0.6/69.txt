history is filled with stories of mad scientists who changed the world with their revolutionary ideas . there is also , in the history of science , a long history of mad scientists with brilliant ideas . these two stories are not mutually exclusive . in fact , many revolutionary ideas were often met with suspicion and hostility . we ' ve got many more world - famous stories from the history of science and technology . the idea , of course , is to include those ideas that were scorned and should have been abandoned . the star trek prequels , too . but we ' re going to tell a different story here . heliocentrism galileo galilei , often called the father of modern science , was among the first and most likely to pay the price for his own revolutionary ideas . he fiercely defended the scientific theory of heliocentrism - - that the universe revolves around the sun - - even when the church and the other secular scientists objected to that theory . however , in sixteenth century europe , his radical ideas were very nearly outlawed . galileo was forced to resign and spent the rest of his life under house arrest .
