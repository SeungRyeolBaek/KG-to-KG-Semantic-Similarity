cracking down on the poor is of course a bad idea , but , what ? look after the ##pers who want to convert their tax dollars to an even more substantial amount of money ? i think the people who do this are using the money for things we all frown upon , while others are just trying to pay their own way . my guess is that this program is not a government program , so it ’ is almost as if billions of resources are being used to make life more comfortable for the poor . besides that , though , obama seems to also know something that the rest of the people probably ought to know too : believe it or not , if you want the public to support these programs , you have to make sure they ’ are implemented properly . that ’ means double or triply because of social welfare programs , which are often demagogued even under the best of circumstances . if anything , those who support these programs ought to be more concerned with wiping out corruption and social welfare than obama , who ’ would be just as happy to let them all go away . this is not about charlie .
