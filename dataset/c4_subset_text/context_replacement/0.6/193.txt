jake is a cute , intelligent , playful and energetic little # ##bird looking for a new home . jake flew into the home of his parents in florida and landed on a neighbor ' s porch . his parents named the bird jake , but they decided not to use the name themselves , so they took her instead . i ' m pretty sure this bird is a female based on the color of her feathers , and the shape of her eye ( the " c " in her eye ) . i know that birds only last two years , so buying a bird , or any acquisition , should not be taken lightly . besides , i love having a bird around . i ' ve had a little bird for 20 years and she introduces me to people new to the house - even my parents ! they are smart , playful and fun . feel free to read more on my books before taking the plunge . there are a few things that i find interesting . if you ' d like to meet and help with jake , please contact me directly at sheri @ petraits . com / 773 - 777 - 2891 . her
