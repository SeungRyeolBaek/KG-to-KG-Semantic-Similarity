content protection features in windows vista are preventing users from viewing high - definition video and movies and affecting their privacy , even though microsoft developed security software that could prevent them , computer scientist david gutmann said at the usenix security conference in june 2006 . " if there was any security software at microsoft , it was probably never there , " gutmann , from the university of auckland , new zealand , said while giving a lecture about windows content protection . " if the attacker is the user and not the software , the security software falls apart . " microsoft allows hd content and high - definition movies to be reduced in quality when sent to high - quality devices , so we are getting status reports that say " high opm content is unacceptable . " gutmann calls this " probably the most important status report ever . " although microsoft ' s goal is to block hd content , home videos are still being broadcast in high definition , gutmann said . some users are saying they can ' t access hd content if it ' s a " premium . " " this is not the hd content being blocked , this is the users ' own content , " gutmann said .
