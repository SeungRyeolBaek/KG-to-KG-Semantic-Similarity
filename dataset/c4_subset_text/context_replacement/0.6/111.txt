it ' s still hard to figure out what the best part of last night ' s mtv movie awards was : the barbie dolls rendition of " aggghh ! ! ! ( gonna shock the hell out of you ) . " those three songs were specifically written for letting — viewers take notes . the very best part of the mtv movie awards , however , is a bit more difficult to find : the famous david troyer sketch that became a commercial for chewing gum ? the unexpected , brief appearance of tom cruise ? adam sandler ' s very slow performance of " who does it better ( than the devil ) " ? adam sandler ' s referring to himself as " the devil ' ? " sandler ' s very voice ? lindsay wagner and diddy ' s mccain vs . obama debate ? the fact that the screen looked like the inside of a huge , black hole ? they all represent the same kind of thing . yes , last night ' s mtv movie awards did make sense . the show is also the 2008 record - holder for number of major pop culture references such as those that a film or television series — uses .
