" he ' s not going to be here , " he said . " maybe that ' ll change some things , but i think he ' s going to be a good young guy and stay in there until after the game . " richard sherman : " he ' s gonna do his stuff his own thing and stay in there for a day or two , but i ' ve talked about the possibility of him leaving during the week and right after the game and we have plans in place in case that happens . and , you know , we ' ll cross that bridge when we get there , because , you know , we always will .
