a lot of people say they don ’ ##t like okra , but the people at new moon farms just south of loganville love it . they also eat green beans , watermelon , corn and tomatoes . and they don ’ ##t even wait for the flowers to bloom or the sunflowers to blossom . they just nibble the young plants right down to the ground . that ’ has been mike moon ’ s experience this year . about the middle of may , he planted two 200 - foot long rows of plants , each one dropped about six inches from its parent . that ’ was 10 , 000 square feet of okra . and no sooner did the plants grow up , then the deer came down and ate the 10 young plants . the land he ’ ##0 planted has been in the family since the early 1800s . now a firefighter in loganville , moon has 13 more years until retirement and is planning to keep farming it up until retirement and beyond . he plans to pass on at least some of the land to his grandchildren . and he isn ’ t giving .
