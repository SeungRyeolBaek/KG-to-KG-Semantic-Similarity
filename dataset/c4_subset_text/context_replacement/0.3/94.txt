a scientific observatory , identifiable by the rings of cerenkov radiation that show up on the photomultiplier tubes lining the lab walls , showcase the successful methodology of neutrino astronomy . this picture shows these events . sometimes , the well - designed experiments fail . the outcome you ' re looking for might not even occur , except that a positive result should always be a null outcome you ' re looking for . when that happens , the experiment is always seen as a failure , even though you never would have known the effect without performing it . yet , every once in a while , the apparatus that you use can be reduced to something else entirely . when you approach it in a new way , at a new time , or under new , unique conditions , that ' s usually where the most surprising , serendipitous discoveries are made . in 1987 , a laboratory experiment for cosmic proton decay produced neutrinos , for the first time , from outside not just our solar system , but from outside of the milky way . this is how particle science was born . the conversion of a neutron to a proton , an .
