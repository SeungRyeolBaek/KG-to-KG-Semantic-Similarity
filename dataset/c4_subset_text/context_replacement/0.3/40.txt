when predicting which planets beyond earth could support life , astronomers usually follow the water . exoplanets with rocky surfaces are considered planets if they orbit far enough from their star to potentially form oceans . but as our planetary collection grows , and opportunities for studying them improve , many astrobiologists feel it is time to narrow the list . david mckay at nasa ’ s ames research center in california has come up with an expanded “ of ” for habitability , which also includes things like a planet ’ s radiation levels , radiation exposure and atmospheric composition ( pnas , doi & ieee ; 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1304212111 ) . some capabilities can be inferred simply from knowing the planet ’ s chemical composition and distance from the host star . others would require studying the planets and examining their chemistry . systems with those capabilities are still being studied . “ that doesn ’ t mean we are positioned to do it alone , but the list has become very detailed and very long , ” says adam burrows of stanford university . the list may one day include planets that
