i ran away from home at the age of seventeen . it was a home i had wanted for a long time , walked past when i lived a few blocks away . i finally got my wish and was able to buy it . it was shaded by tall , mature trees ; a treehouse had been built between the trunks of a large avocado tree . an oak tree filled with fruit during the summers . i was married at the time , and my then - husband and i added a new garage to the house , painted the inside of the house , and the kitchen . i spent hours in the garden creating flower beds , planting new trees . the lives we live seem to reflect the changes we are making . we turn a corner and connect with the past . i got divorced while living in the house shaded by trees . newly single , i went through a number of romantic relationships , both of them turbulent and painful . i even adopted a baby boy and raised him into adulthood , turning the treehouse into his home . his name was squirmy , and he and my daughter , sadie , chased each other .
