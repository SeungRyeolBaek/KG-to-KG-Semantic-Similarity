jake is a gorgeous , intelligent , fun and funny boy . ##bird looking for a new guardian . jake flew into the backyard of a house in connecticut and landed on a man ' s shoulder . his parents named the bird jake , but they decided not to keep the bird themselves , so they took her in . i ' m pretty sure this bird is a female based on the shape of her feathers , and the color of her beak ( the " v " above her beak ) . i understand that parakeets can live many lives , so having a bird , or any pet , should not be taken lightly . personally , i love having a bird around . i ' ve had a pet bird for many years and she alerts me to someone coming to the door - even my dogs ! they are smart , interactive and fun . feel free to read up on parakeet life before taking the plunge . here are a couple things that i find interesting . if you ' d like to meet and help adopt jake , please contact me directly at sheri @ petraits . com / 773 - 777 - 2891 . her
