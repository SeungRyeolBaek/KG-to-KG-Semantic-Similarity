vote leave has been blasted on social media for " “ subversion of democracy , ” as an outraged public response to allegations that the group failed to cast votes in the 2016 brexit referendum . lawyers acting on behalf of brexit activists chris wylie and shahmir sanni are calling for the electoral commission to investigate allegations that the group exceeded its spending limit . in a 200 - page report , the lawyers for vote leave circumvented the law by donating £625 , 000 ( $ 885 , 000 ) to pro - brexit charity beleave group , to which it is closely linked . the money , however , was allegedly insufficient for vote leave , bringing its total spending over the legal limit of £7 million ( $ 9 . 9 million ) , breaching eu law . the allegations is largely based on witness statements by former cambridge analytica employee wylie , and sanni – a volunteer who worked for both vote leave and beleave . speaking to journalists on monday , wylie said the dossier contained information undermining the fairness of the 2016 referendum result , which could allow a new one to be held . vote leave has strongly denied any involvement and
