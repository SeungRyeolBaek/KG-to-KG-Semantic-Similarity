content protection features in windows vista are preventing users from playing high - definition video and audio and affecting system performance , even as microsoft takes security measures that could protect users , computer researcher peter gutmann argued at the usenix security symposium on boston wednesday . " if there was any threat modeling at vista , it was very badly done , " gutmann , from the university of auckland , new zealand , said while giving a talk on vista content protection . " if the problem is the user and not the attacker , standard security thinking falls away . " vista requires hd content like high - definition video to be degraded in quality when sent to high - end devices , and users are receiving error codes that indicate " graphics opm resolution too high . " gutmann calls this " probably the most important status report ever . " although microsoft ' s intent is to protect hd content , hd videos are increasingly being broadcast in high definition , gutmann said . many users are finding they can ' t access any content if it ' s considered " inappropriate . " " this is not commercial hd content being blocked , this is the users ' own content , " gutmann said .
