president trump ’ s decision monday to announce plans to freeze federal employee benefits in 2020 and to make a series of cuts to federal employee health benefits was met with some consternation from some groups , although the ideas stand little chance of becoming reality . increasing employee contributions toward federal defined benefit pension programs by 10 percent per year until those payments reach 50 percent of the federal payroll . eliminating cost of living adjustments for fers benefits , and increasing csrs cost of living adjustments by 0 . 5 percent . eliminating the fers benefits for employees forced to retire when social security kicked in at age 65 . changing the formula for federal workers ' retirement to be based on the average of their highest five years of employment , rather than the current lowest three years . increasing the return rate of the thrift savings plan ’ the government pension ( g ) fund , basing it on the return of either the three - week or four - week u . s . treasury bond , rather than a weighted average of all federal payments . the administration will not release the full details of these proposals until next
