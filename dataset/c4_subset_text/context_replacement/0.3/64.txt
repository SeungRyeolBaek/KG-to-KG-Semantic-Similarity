many people think the secret to good cooking is mastery of flavor . it is , but it ' s hardly that . the key to things that are s and m , that brings people to the table , then brings them back for more , is understanding flavors and how they work together . and while the second degree certainly helps one do this , equally important is the willingness to try new foods , as well as old ones in different combinations . now there is a book to help you take that field trip . flavor masters karen smith and andrew dornenburg have compiled an encyclopedic guide to flavor . their self - released " the flavor book " not only explains what foods taste like , but also offers detailed descriptions of flavor pairings for cooking . they suggest mascarpone , for example , which goes well with apples , grapes and peaches , among many other options . they also suggest things to avoid , such as maple syrup and brown sugar ( too much ) . the last two chapters of the book explain how flavor works and offer advice from chefs and others on how they pair various flavors to create good recipes .
