fans , coaches and players - - not just officials - - need to step up their game before disaster strikes . if you follow me on social media ( the ones with my modest number of followers , it ’ s possible ) you know i ’ ve been vocal in my bewilderment at the officiating of several high school football games this season . i has affected , and even determined , the outcome of several games . my beef hasn ’ t simply been about making changes that seem to be made automatically ( those happen ) , but also with the officials . crews have often bumbled yardage , ##offs , yards ( the ball can ’ t be exactly at the yard on every play – that ’ s all ) , downs and rules . the common will be inexperienced , often undertrained officials . however , there are reasons for the abuse . who in the heck would want to be an nfl referee ? a hundred bucks a day isn ’ t terrible , but do you want to be the subject of nonstop verbal abuse for three hours ? college football officials question : who take the piss ?
