the liberal government is supporting canada ’ s transition to a lower - carbon economy , even as conservative politicians in the province try to scuttle key measures that would support that effort . natural resources minister jim carr endorsed an energy council report thursday that spells out the ambitious goal of increasing energy efficiency , switching off fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the country ’ s oil and gas industry . the generation 1 report was endorsed by an advisory committee chaired by mr . carr after he hosted a conference last year on the need for a new national energy strategy . the committee included representatives from the oil and gas industry and the electricity sector , as well as from clean energy and environmental organizations . the report declared that climate change is a global danger , and that canada should be part of the global transition to lower - carbon energy sources to avoid the most adverse effects . however , there is considerable political opposition to the liberal government ’ s climate - change approach . conservative politicians argue that ottawa and its allies among provincial governments are driving up energy costs for canadians with carbon taxes while hurting the interests of the canadian oil industry with levies and new regulations
