harry connolly ' s twenty palaces series is one of my favorite new works in fantasy fiction . after a twenty year absence harry has brought back ray lilly , and all the characters in the twisted path . the twenty palaces series tells the tale of ray lilly , a former convict turned into a magician ' s decoy , the wooden man . it is lilly ' s job to distract evil creatures from the deep and dark , while his wife annalise burns them with primal green fire . they keep on saving the world from some pretty evil creatures that have taken over . wooden men aren ' t meant to last more than a year , but somehow he keeps on surviving . the twenty palaces company has taken notice and sent lilly and annalise to europe , this does not bode well . connolly ' s lovecraft - ian / poe - like writing and character building is amazing . i have enjoyed all of his novels and novellas , but none have been as successful as the twisted path . if you are new to this series , i highly recommend starting with child of fire , the which is also connolly ' s first novel . ray and
