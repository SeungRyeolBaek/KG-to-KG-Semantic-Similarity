the formation of the new federation would result in a major cosatu split as affiliates would have to choose between the two . zwelinz ima vavi , the former cosatu secretary general who was suspended by namibia ’ s national labour federation in 2014 for allegedly failing to carry out his duties , would lead the new federation to be unveiled on may 1 . one of cosatu ’ s major affiliates – the national union of metalworkers of south africa ( numsa ) – would be one of the biggest members of the federation . numsa ’ s cosatu membership was suspended in 2014 after disputes with the federation . vavi said the south african trade union movement had become fragmented and fragmented , with only 24 % of workers being members of any union . “ that is why there is such a groundswell of support for a workers summit and not just a new labour federation but a completely different one , based on price equality , social democracy , non - racialism , gender equality , international solidarity and economic development , ” he said . vavi said the new federation would stay away from politics
