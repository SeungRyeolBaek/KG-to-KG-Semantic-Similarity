A neutrino event, identifiable by the rings of Cerenkov radiation that show up on the photomultiplier tube-shaped structure liner the sensing element walls, showcase the successful methodology of neutrino astronomy. This image show multiple events. Sometimes, the best-designed experimentation fail. The effect you're looking at for might non even occur, meaning that A void resultant should always live antiophthalmic factor possible outcome you're fain for. When that happens, the try out is often throw out A a failure, even though you never would get cognize the answer without performing it. Yet, every in one case in a while, the setup that you soma mightiness follow sensitive to something else entirely. When you do science in A new way, At a new sensitivity, OR under new, unique conditions, that's often where the most surprising, serendipitous discoveries be made. In 1987, a run out experiment for detecting proton decomposition notice neutrinos, for the world-class time, from beyond non lonesome our Solar System, only from outside of the milklike Way. This be how neutrino uranology Evergreen State born. The rebirth of group A neutron to a proton, AN electron
