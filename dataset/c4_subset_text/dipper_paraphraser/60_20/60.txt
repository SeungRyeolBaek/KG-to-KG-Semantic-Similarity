 It is a fantasy and real in so many ways , as the pathfinder, as leatherstockings, as the longue carabine. . . . page 11 , October 5, 1878 - the craftsmen in fur. Who has not killed deer in a fantasy gun-rack, and, hanging on a peg in the store - house of memory, the blanket that the delaware chief threw back so that he could show his tigers on his breast to his old tribe? This is a fantasy, a real thing, the hunter’s tool, the leather jacket, the longue carabine. Who has not seen in luminous pictures the cave, with the sassafras screen behind which the pale faces lurked, while the deadly fight was going on between the Mohicans and the Mingoes, who had ‘ dared to print their mocassins in the woods’, that once held the hand of the delaware tribe. The cora burial, beneath the young pines, and the dead sagamore, clad in his full tribal robe and rank, with the children of the Lenape listening for the cry of the stern old warrior whose lips are silent, while he looks at his tigers. Who has not seen, in an air-carved picture, the cavern with the sassafras screen behind which “wild dogs” lurked, while the deadly fight between the mohicans and the mingoes, who had ‘dared to set their mocassins in the woods’, which once belonged to the sway of the delaware tribe; the grave of cora, under the young pines; the dead sagamore, clad in his full-dress of his tribe and rank, the children of the lenape listening to the lament of the stern old warrior, whose lips remain untape as he looks his tigers on his chest.
