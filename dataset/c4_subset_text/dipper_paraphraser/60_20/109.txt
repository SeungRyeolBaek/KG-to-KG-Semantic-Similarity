The firm of market forces has obtained the support of some of the superannuation funds and large overseas investors in whitehaven to put forward three resolutions to be presented at the annual general meeting of sydney. One statutory proposal, an advisory, directs the company to disclose climate-related risks to its shareholders, in line with the recommendations of the financial stability committee’s taskforce on climate-related risks. Another proposal imposes that the board of directors be given responsibility for formulating strategies and capital spending according to the Paris Agreement in order to safeguard the long-term success of the company and respond to the risks and opportunities posed by climate change. “We’re moving this resolution to preserve our capital, as well as for the protection of our shareholders from stranded assets.” Will van derPol, a lawyer and proponent of market forces, said the shareholders had been “receptive” to recent discussions.
