 I am proposing a new process for the restoration of nycâ€™s 1950s-era food carts for a sustainable future. There are five, 000 food carts in New York, and they are as much of an icon of the town as the subway signs of the MTA or the chrysler building. There are five, 000 taverns in New York, and they are as a symbol of the city as the signs of the MTA or the C. chrysler building. I propose a new restoration of the 1950s food carts in a resurgence.
