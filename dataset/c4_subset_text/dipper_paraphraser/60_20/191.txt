 My story is about two schools in texas: a big one, north side isd in San Antonio; and a small one, perrin-whitt, in the north of the state. I have been talking a lot lately and seeing many examples of the offshoot of school districts, by layoffs and forced resignations, in general not filling the positions when the teachers or other employees leave the school or retire. In my story this week i am going to look at one of the most often forgotten consequences of this district contraction: the school districts are now moving their employees from one job to another, to cover for the loss of the school staff and for the amount they are losing. I’ve been talking a great deal recently and seeing many examples of the misallocation of workers in schools, and how, through layoffs and forced resignations, teachers and other staff don’t fill their positions when teachers or other employees leave the school or retire. This week, I’m going to look at one of the most often forgotten consequences of this consolidation of schools: the districts have been moving their employees from one place to another to cover for the loss of the staff and for the loss of their budgets. In both places, the money is being squandered because of the state budget cuts and both places have had to move many people around to make up for their loss, and also in order to retain the teachers and other staff in their area of expertise and accreditation. In this story, a superintendent i had the pleasure of speaking to from a district in pennsylvania recently called this people-moving process “checkerboarding.” “If you’re in a district that has gone through something like that, what kind of job are you doing?”
