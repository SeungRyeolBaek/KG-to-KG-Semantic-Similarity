 I. s. (here the tax-benefit calculation is) assumed on the basis of national incomes. In year 2015 the monetary balance for israel (% potential gross income) is - 2.85 %. In the year 2015, i.s. (here the tax-benefit calculation is) the monetary balance for israel (% potential gross income) is - 2.85 %. I. s. is defined as the actual deficit or surplus less the effects of cyclical deviations in output from potential. As a result of the margin of uncertainty that the estimates of cyclical gaps and tax and expenditure elasticities on national income are subject to, it is necessary to interpret the indicators of the fiscal position as broad orders of magnitude. In the year 2015, i.s. (here is the tax-benefit calculation), i.s. (here is the tax-benefit calculation) is - 2.85 %. In the year 2015, i.s. (here is the tax-benefit calculation) i.s. is - 2.85 %. - It is defined as the actual deficit or surplus, less the cyclical deviations from potential. - In the world - if we look at general government structural balance (% potential GDP) - in the year 2015, israel is 1 . In the year 2015 the monetary balance for israel (% potential gross income) is 2.85 %. In the year 2015 i.s. (here is the tax benefit calculation) i.s. is 2.85 %. , it is calculated on the basis of national income. - In the world - if we look at the general equilibrium (% potential gross income) - in the year 2015 israel is 1 . 96 % less than the average. In the previous year, 2014, the general equilibrium (% potential gross income) for israel was - 3 . 52 %, the general equilibrium (% potential gross income) for israel in 2015 was or will be 19 . - This is the actual deficit or surplus, less the cyclical deviation from potential. In the year 2015 - i. s. (here is the tax-benefit calculation), i. s. is - 2.85 %. I.S. (here is the tax-benefit calculation) is 2.85 %. In the year 2015, i.s. (here is the tax-benefit calculation) is 2.85 %. In the year 2015, i.s. (here is the tax-benefit calculation) is 2.85 %. In the world, if we look at the general equilibrium (% potential GDP) – israel is 1 – 96 % less than the average. In the previous year, 2014, the general equilibrium (% potential GDP) for israel was 3 – 52 %, in 2015 the general equilibrium (% potential income) for israel was or will be 19 – a quarter less than it was or will be in 2014 ... In the year 2015 – i.s. (here is the tax-benefit calculation), i.s. is 2.85 %. The year 2015 – i.s. (here is the tax-benefit calculation) – 2.85 %. As a result of the long uncertainty that the estimations of cyclical gaps and tax-expense elasticities have on national income, it is necessary to interpret the economic indicators of the fiscal position as broadly different orders of magnitude. In the previous year, 2014, the general equilibrium (% potential gross income) for israel was 3 . 52 %, and in 2015, in 2015, israel will be 19 .
