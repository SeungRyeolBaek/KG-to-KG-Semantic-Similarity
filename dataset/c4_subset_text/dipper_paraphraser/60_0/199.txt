Newswise , as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the oceans soak up much of it, storing around 30 percent of the emissions of human activities. Thus, the ocean has been a buffer to slow down the emissions of greenhouse gases, and thus the climate change . . . On the contrary, as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the oceans absorb it much more, storing up to thirty percent of the emissions of human activities, which in turn reduces the greenhouse gases. This fact is reflected in a study by the oceanographer jun cai and his colleagues at the University of Bruxelles, Texas a - corpus Christi, university of hawaii, eth zurich. Meanwhile, the acidity of the water rises, and the marine organisms and the ocean ecosystem are affected. . . . But this process also increases the acidity of sea water, and may have adverse effects on the health of marine organisms and the ecosystem. . . . A rocky shore near the University of Delaware witty campus in lewes. One picture of the coast near the University of Delaware's witty campus in lewes. The map shows a rocky shore near the University of Delaware's witty campus in lewes. News is that when more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the oceans absorb much of it, which is about thirty percent of the emissions of human activities. This is the case with the oceans, which absorb up to thirty percent of the emissions of human activities. This relates to the theory of oceanography, jun cai and his colleagues at the University of Brussel, Texas, corpus Christi, eth zurich. This is a study of jun cai and his colleagues at the University of Bruxelles, Texas, corpus Christi, eth zurich, eth zurich. But as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the oceans soak up more, and keep the emission of up to thirty percent of human activities, thereby reducing the temperature.
