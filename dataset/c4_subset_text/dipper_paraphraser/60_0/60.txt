 “ Page 11 , 5 October 1878. – Domestics of fur. Who hasn’t killed deer in an imaginary gun rack, and the blanket that the delaware chief threw back to bury the tortoise on his breast to his ancient tribe? These are all inventions of fancy, and real in so many ways: as the journeyman, as leather-stockings, as the longue carabine? What is there for him who hasn’t seen, in painted pictures, the cavern, with the Sassafras screen behind which the “bees” were hiding, while a deadly fight raged between the Mohicans and the Mingoes, who had ‘come to put the print of their mocassins in the woods’ that once ruled the ruling tribe of the delawares. The grave of Cora, beneath the young pines; the dead sagamore, dressed in full military attire, surrounded by the children of the lenape, and listening for the lament of the harsh old warrior whose lips remain silent as he looks at his stern old warrior. All these inventions of imagination and real in so many ways: as a journeyman, as leathers, as a longue carabine? Who has not seen, in depicted paintings, the cavern, with its sassafras, behind which the “powderheads” hid, while the deadly battle raged between the Mohicans and the mingoes, who had " dared to cast their mocassins in the woods", which held the sway of the delaware tribe. The grave of cora, under the young pines, the dead sagamore, enshrined in his tribe and rank, with the children of the lenape listening to the lament of the old warrior, whose lips remain silent as he looks upon his "homely" mouth.
