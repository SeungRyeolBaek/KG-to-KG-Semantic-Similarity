I READ “The Economic Consequences of Mr. Bush” with some interest. I was left wondering what the qualifications are in this  day and age to obtain a Nobel Prize. Joseph E. Stiglitz asserts that F.D.R. and his various social reallocation programs were the cause of great prosperity and that somehow President Bush has done more damage to the economy than Herbert Hoover. Both assertions are false.
The implementation of Social Security has been the greatest Ponzi scheme ever foisted on the people of the Western world. Such a scheme is illegal if put in place by private business, yet the government created a “system” that depends on ever increasing populations of working citizens to sustain it. This, of course, is impossible—the carrying capacity of the planet is finite and will eventually be reached. It is for this reason that private systems such as Mr. Ponzi’s are illegal.
