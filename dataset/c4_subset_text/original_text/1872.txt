CALGARY, AB -- Calgary Flames general manager Jay Feaster and assistant GM John Weisbrod have been relieved of their duties effective  immediately, the team announced Thursday.
Brian Burke, the team's president of hockey operations, addressed the moves at an afternoon press conference at the Scotiabank Saddledome.
"I'm frustrated like all our fans with our inability to hold leads," Burke said.
He said there would be no further moves in the front office and the team's coach, Bob Hartley, and his staff would finish out the year. Burke also said that he will not take over the GM duties and will only sere in that role until a replacement is found. He also said he has already reached out to one unnamed candidate and received permission to interview him.
Burke also said Thursday he would like the Flames to play a different style in the future.
"I like teams that bang. I don't like the way we play," Burke said, adding that he wants to see more hostility and truculence.
The Flames play host to the Carolina Hurricanes on Thursday night.
