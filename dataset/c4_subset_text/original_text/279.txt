Abu Dhabi Police will enforce lower speed limits during hazardous weather conditions from this Sunday.
The force said reduced speed limits will be posted on electronic  signboards on roads and sent out by SMS, the Arabic newspaper Al Bayan reported.
There was no mention of what the reduced speed limit would be, or whether it would vary depending on the severity of the weather conditions.
On March 17, Abu Dhabi police reduced the speed limit to 80kph due to severe sandstorms and winds that reached 50 kph in some places. Visibility was less than 2,000 metres on some roads.
The new policy has not been announced on the force's social media accounts.
Last November, Abu Dhabi's transport authority gave the green-light for a new safety scheme slashing speeds on roads during bad weather, such as heavy rain, sandstorms and thick fog.
The Department of Transport's traffic safety committee agreed a plan to cut speed limits to 80kph when visibility for drivers is reduced to 200 metres or less.
Motorists will be alerted to the reduced speed limits by notices on smart towers - structures displaying road messages - located
