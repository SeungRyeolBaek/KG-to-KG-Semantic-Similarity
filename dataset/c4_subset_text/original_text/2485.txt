JUNEAU | Alaska Attorney General Talis Colberg, a major figure in the abuse-of-power investigation of Gov. Sarah Palin , has resigned, the governor’s office said Tuesday.
Mr. Colberg, who was appointed to the post in 2006 after Mrs. Palin was elected, represented seven of nine state employees who initially refused to testify before a legislative panel investigating Mrs. Palin’s firing of her public safety commissioner in what became known as Troopergate. Mr. Colberg said he advised the seven of their options, and he unsuccessfully challenged the subpoenas in court.
Mrs. Palin’s spokesman, Bill McAllister, said the resignation was a personal decision for Mr. Colberg, and Mrs. Palin neither fired nor pressured him to quit.
SAN DIEGO | The San Diego County District Attorney’s Office said 33 people have been arrested and charged with selling drugs at military housing.
Authorities said Tuesday that the three-month investigation resulted in seizures of 2 pounds of methamphetamine, a half-pound of cocaine, 6 pounds of marijuana and seven guns.
