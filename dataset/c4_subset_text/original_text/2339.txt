BSP will not have an election manifesto for Uttar Pradesh polls, its president Mayawati said on Sunday as the party announced a list of 101 candidates for eastern UP, giving a bulk of tickets to upper castes and backwards, in a move take on ruling SP and BJP in the state.
Uttar Pradesh goes to polls from February 11 in seven phases that will end on March 8. The results would be announced on March 11.
Addressing BSP leaders and office-bearers at its state unit office here, Mayawati said other parties make populist announcements in election manifestoes, but these remained “limited to elections”. After forming government, they forgot these promises and “implemented anti-people policies”.
“BSP will not release election manifesto as people know our party keeps its promises. BSP fulfilled all the promises made to the people after forming the government in 2007,” she said, adding
