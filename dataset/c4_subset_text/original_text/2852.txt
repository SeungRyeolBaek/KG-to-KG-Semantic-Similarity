Mansfield Town supporters are largely happy with the club’s season ticket prices which were announced on Friday.
The cut-price � �Early Bird’ ticket deal was given a big thumbs up and the overall pricing was seen as reasonable, though there were concerns over matchday admission prices for children and adults.
An SFU spokesman said: “Stags Fans United are delighted that the club has offered an early bird season ticket.
“This was the number one suggestion we made to club when we were asked for our thoughts in April, ahead of any draft season ticket prices.
“The early bird prices represent excellent value.
However, the SFU were concerned over matchday prices.
“We asked the club to look after kids and families by having cheap junior and family matchday tickets,” said the spokesman.
“However, the matchday prices for kids are still too high in our opinion based on consistent feedback from fans.
“Kids do not tend to plan ahead to buy tickets and need to be encouraged to attend on a matchday.
