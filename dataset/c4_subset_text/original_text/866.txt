LITTLE more than 18 months ago, Timothy Riley was a happy, active young man.
But a diagnosis of leukodystrophy  - a rare degenerative disease that affects around one in 175,000 people worldwide - brought all that crashing down.
The disease affects the nervous system, stripping people of their ability to perform everyday functions, eventually resulting in death.
Despite being wheelchair-bound and fed by a nasal gastric tube, it was impossible to wipe the smile from Timothy's face on Saturday, as more than 200 people from the Darling Downs biking community headed to Esk to celebrate his 16th birthday.
Timothy was treated to a motorbike ride as part of his birthday celebrations - one of the many highlights on the day.
The community also organised bands on the day and donated money toward Timothy's medical expenses.
