Fans of Latin sounds will have plenty of reasons to mambo, samba and smile this week and beyond, as a season of music festivities gets  under way with two noteworthy events.
In Grant Park this weekend, the Viva! Chicago Latin Music Festival kicks off its 18th year, with 14 hours of live entertainment ready to go Saturday and Sunday at the Petrillo Music Shell--and more music slated for a side stage.
Alacranes Musical (the Musical Scorpions) closes Viva! Chicago Sunday. Hailing from the Mexican state of Durango, the members ply a frenetic style known as Duranguense--which, despite its name, has roots right here. Think polka gone mad with synthesized tubas, techno beats and electronically altered vocals, and you'll get an idea what's in store.
