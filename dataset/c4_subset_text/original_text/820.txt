LUSAKA (Reuters) - Kansai Plascon, owned by Tokyo-listed Kansai Paint Co Ltd, has launched  the world’s first mosquito repellant paint in Zambia to help it reach a target to eliminate malaria by 2021, the company and a Japanese government official said.
Malaria, spread by mosquitoes, is a treatable disease if caught early, but current anti-malarial drugs are failing in many areas as people develop resistance to them.
Zambia aims to eradicate malaria, the southern African country’s biggest killer, within three years after deaths from the disease halved last year from 2014, the government said in June.
Hanai Junichi, Japan International Cooperation Agency’s (JICA) Zambia resident representative said his agency was carrying out the initiative in partnership with Kansai.
“A study done in the last two years in 400 households with Zambia’s ministry of health proved that the paint is very effective and is not harmful to human beings,” Junichi told Reuters.
