LOEB-Henry A. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York express our deep sorrow upon  the death of Henry A. Loeb, noted philanthropist, who leaves a legacy of compassion and caring for the community. As chair of the 1964-65 fund-raising campaign of our predecessor organization, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, and as a very significant leader for many years, he improved the quality of life for thousands of people in New York City. He has left a rich legacy. His devotion to children was reflected in his service as a Trustee of Ramapo Anchorage Camp, a UJA-Federation beneficiary. A leader committed to the concept of reaching out to the less fortunate as a private and public duty, he fulfilled the spirit of the teaching: ''As previous generations planted for me, so do I plant for the future.'' His dedication to these principles is carried on through the exemplary activities of his daughter, Betty Levin, a former member of the UJA-Federation Board of Directors and the founding chair of our Building Arts Committee.
