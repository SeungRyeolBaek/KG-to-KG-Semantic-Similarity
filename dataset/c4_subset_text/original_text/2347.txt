Black Tom Cassidy, in all his, uh, glory?
Correction: Monday, one of the writers of Deadpool 2, Rhett Reese,  took to Twitter to simply say these rumors are “Untrue.” He didn’t elaborate beyond that.
According to rumors currently gently rocking the sleepy, sleepy crib of the internet, the upcoming Deadpool 2 might have one less villain than we thought.
Now, according to rumors via The Tracking Board’s Jeff Sneider, Kesy might not be a presence in the movie any longer. Speaking on a podcast, he commented that he had heard from an anonymous source that Kesy was no longer in the film. And while anonymous sources on films are not the most reliable in the world, this rumor tracks. We haven’t seen anything of Kesy’s villain in the promo materials, and info that suggests that the film’s recent reshoots were largely to recenter the film in the opposition between Deadpool and Cable (along with some more of Zazie Beetz’s Domino), presumably before they become best friends at the end
