Skateboarder Jean-Marc Johannes will add another accolade to his list of achievements when he receives special recognition at the Cape Town Sports Council  Awards at UWC today.
The annual event honours athletes' achievements within all sporting codes that fall under the Western Cape Department of Cultural Affairs. As South Africa's most decorated skateboarder, Johannes joins a list of top athletes from across the sporting spectrum.
Johannes's love for the sport started at the age of 11 and since then he has begun competing around the world, becoming a regular on international podiums the past three years.
Prior to the awards, he collected gold, silver and bronze medals across Asia and in France, along with being a current Guinness World Record holder.
At the Cape Town Sports Council event, Johannes's achievements over the past two years will be highlighted with a special presentation.
This is the first time in the Cape Town Sports Council Awards' history that skateboarding has been honoured at the event and it is testament to the sport's growing impact. This is reflected in skateboardingâ€™s recent inclusion as a code at the 2020 Tokyo
