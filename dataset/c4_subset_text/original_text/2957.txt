Gina Gionfriddo (“House of Cards, “Law & Order”), E. Max Frye (“Band of Brothers”) and John Sayles (“Bass Reeves”) also join the Paramount Television and Anonymous Content project as writers. The trio, joining pilot and series writer Hossein Amini, will serve as consulting producers on the episodes they pen.
“After twenty years of tough struggle and countless failed attempts, I’m delighted that Paramount Television, Anonymous Content and TNT have decided to join forces and bring ‘The Alienist’ to life in what, based on the material I’ve read, has the potential to be a faithful and exciting TV series,” Carr commented.
Previously announced, “True Detective’s” Cary Fukunaga will direct the drama. He and Amini will exec produce with Eric Roth
