Acadiana has become known as the home of family friendly Mardi Gras — drawing crowds of more than 300,000 from around the nation  and the world.
Mardi Gras in Lafayette may have started out as a small version of New Orleans’ giant party, but it’s grown into its own over the years.
Mardi Gras season, sometimes called Carnival season, begins Jan. 6, on the Christian feasts of the Epiphany and culminates on the day before Ash Wednesday, 47 days before Easter. The celebration dates back thousands of years to pagan spring and fertility rites. Over time, Christianity incorporated popular traditions, and the excess and debauchery of the Mardi Gras season eventually became a prelude to Lent.
This year, Fat Tuesday falls on March 5.
