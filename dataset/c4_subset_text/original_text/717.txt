Feb. 26 (UPI) -- Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show took a turn for the worst during its scripted, fifth anniversary special that featured guests  such as Tina Fey and Robert Irwin.
The special featured a new format that was inspired by The Larry Sanders Show which starred late comedian Garry Shandling.
Fallon was featured as a disgruntled late-night host who grows frustrated with constant production issues and guests that hate him. Normal Tonight Show segments were intersected with behind-the-scenes moments and private conversations Fallon has with his guests and production crew when cameras are not rolling.
Fallon was first joined by Ben Stiller, who was unhappy about dressing up as Hashtag the Panda and who had trouble finding the exit backstage.
Tina Fey then appeared and whispered into Fallon's ear that he is a terrible person before she sat down for her interview. Fey and Fallon kept it professional until they given a private moment while a clip from her new Netflix comedy Wine Country played for the live audience.
"You know what you did," Fey says when Fallon asks what's wrong. "Trump got elected because of you," she says
