A high-risk traffic stop that took place downtown on Tuesday afternoon ended with a 24-year-old woman in police custody and three young children  being cared for by Mobile Crisis Services.
The woman has been charged with attempted robbery, robbery, possession of stolen property over $5,000, carrying a weapon dangerous to the public and assault with a weapon — many of the charges stemming from two incidents that took place just after 8 a.m. in the College Park and Grosvenor Park neighbourhoods.
During the arrest, which took place just after 1 p.m. north of the intersection of 2nd Avenue North and 23rd Street East, officers located three young children inside the vehicle and called Mobile Crisis Services to care for them.
According to a police news release, police first responded to two reports that a woman armed with a knife and driving a Ford Escape — which officers discovered had also been stolen — between 8 and 8:30 a.m. In the first incident the suspect attempted to rob a woman of her belongings but was unsuccessful. In the second incident the suspect stole another woman’s purse.
