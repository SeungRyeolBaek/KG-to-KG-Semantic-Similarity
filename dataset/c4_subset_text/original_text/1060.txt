Unity government takes shape with ceremony overshadowed by would-be minister's arrest.
The MDC leader has selected 14 cabinet ministers but Mugabe,  who was supposed to have 15 ministers sworn in, instead brought 22 as the swearing-in ceremony got underway.
The MDC splinter group, MDC Mutambara, has three cabinet posts.
But in the latest of a series of political twists, Roy Bennett, a white farmer who became treasurer of the MDC, was arrested at a Harare airport just an hour before the oath-taking ceremony, MDC sources said.
Bennett returned just last month from three years of self-imposed exile in South Africa, where he had fled to escape charges of plotting to kill Mugabe, and was set to become deputy agriculture minister in the new government.
Al Jazeera's Haru Mutasa, reporting from Harare, said: "He [Bennett] is still in police custody some where outside the capital. People are confused as to what is going on."
She said some people were wondering why Tsvangirai had agreed for his ministers to be sworn in
