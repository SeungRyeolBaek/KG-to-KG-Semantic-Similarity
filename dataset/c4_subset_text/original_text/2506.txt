Rapper LIL’ KIM, who plays her first solo live dates in the UK in June, has been filming the final scenes to  her latest video.
But in a break from her outrageous norm, Kim‘s latest track is a cover of Phil Collins‘ ‘In The Air Tonight’, the second release from the ‘Urban Renewal’ covers album, in which popular R&B and rap stars – including Kelis, Montell Jordan, Joe and Changing Faces, among others, tackle “popular” Collins songs.
The first cover to be taken from the album, ‘Another Day In Paradise’ – a duet featuring siblings Brandy and Ray J – has already shifted a quarter of a million copies, despite the album itself only being released in Germany.
Lil’ Kim also makes a guest appearance on the forthcoming ‘Lady Marmalade’ single.
