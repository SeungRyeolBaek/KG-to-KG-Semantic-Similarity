Christian formation is the lifelong process of growing in our relationship with God, self, others, and all creation. Every experience in our lives can provide  us with the opportunity to express our faith; the challenge we face is recognizing these opportunities and learning ways to live a sometimes countercultural life in a secular world.
Convene, coordinate, and facilitate gatherings of young adult and campus ministry leaders and youth ministers for leadership development, networking, discernment and support.
Build and sustain relationships within the networks of leaders and possible partners.
We have offices in Minnesota, Massachusetts and at the Church Center in New York City. We travel frequently but have an extraordinary Team Associate, Valerie Harris ([email protected]), who always knows where we are, what weâ€™re up to, and can often answer your questions and respond to your needs when we are unavailable. Please feel free to contact us any time via phone or email.
