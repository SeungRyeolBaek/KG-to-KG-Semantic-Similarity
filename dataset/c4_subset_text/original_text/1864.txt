Will ‘cabinets in the basement’ be the next big thing?
BT is trumpeting a new test which will see it  install broadband in some really hard-to-reach locations: the middle of cities. Well, provided it can get into the building in the first place.
It seems there are some places where it’s impossible to put a cabinet in the street, and that means slow broadband for domestic and small business users.
