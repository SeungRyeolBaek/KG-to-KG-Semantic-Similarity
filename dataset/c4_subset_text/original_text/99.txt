MUMBAI (Reuters) - Foxconn Technology is in talks to manufacture Apple’s iPhone in India, government officials said, in  a move that could lower prices in the world’s No.3 smartphone market where the U.S. firm trails Samsung Electronics and local players.
India could help Foxconn mitigate accelerating wage inflation in China, where it makes the majority of iPhones, and base production sites closer to markets where its key clients want to grow.
Lower production costs could also help Foxconn keep hold of Apple orders amid intensifying competition with nimble manufacturing rivals such as Quanta Computer Inc.
“Foxconn is sending a delegation of their officers to scout for locations in a month’s time,” Subhash Desai, Industries Minister of India’s western state Maharashtra, told Reuters.
Foxconn has said it is aiming to develop 10-12 facilities in India, including factories and data centers, by 2020, but had given no detail.
The Taiwan-based tech giant, the world’s largest contract maker of electronic products, declined to comment on detailed plans
