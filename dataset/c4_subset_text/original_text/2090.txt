Disgruntled supporters of a losing candidate in Solomon Islands are reported to have thrown stones and damaged a counting station in Temotu province.
 It is the first account of trouble in the general election held earlier this week, Radio New Zealand International reports.
Reports from Temotu suggest the supporters involved were those of high-profile politician and Our Party member Patteson Oti.
Police will not confirm this, but say supporters of a losing candidate allegedly threw stones, damaged a building and looted the shop of the winning candidate after the unofficial result was announced in the provincial capital Lata about 3am on Friday.
