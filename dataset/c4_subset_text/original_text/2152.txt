Iran's crude oil exports have surged to their highest in 20 months, far exceeding a one million barrel-per-day limit set by the West  under an interim deal on curbing Tehran's nuclear programme.
The International Energy Agency's monthly report revised February's global crude imports from Iran upwards by 240,000 bpd to 1.65 million barrels per day, the highest since June 2012.
Under a landmark deal signed in November between Iran and world powers - known as the P5+1 - that came into effect in January of this year, Iran's exports are supposed to be held at an average 1 million bpd for the six months to July 20.
Tough international sanctions over the past two years have cut Iran's oil exports around a half.
"The question is whether they are going to continue to test the sanctions," Antoine Halff, head of the IEA's oil industry and markets division, told Reuters.
China accounted for 168,000 bpd of the rise in imports in February, India for 93,000 bpd and South Korea for 83,000 bpd.
