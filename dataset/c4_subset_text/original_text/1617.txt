Nazi essay apology: A high school in New York apologized when an English teacher asked students to “think like a Nazi” for an essay .
The teacher wanted the students to use “solid rationale from government propaganda to convince me of your loyalty to the Third Reich” as part of a persuasive writing assignment. The teacher also wanted them to “argue that Jews are evil,” reported the Albany Times-Union.
Albany Superintendent Marguerite Vanden Wyngaard said the essay was part of exercises that were intended to help students come up with persuasive arguments.
Students were also asked to read and watch Nazi propaganda to come up with their arguments.
Around a third of the students refused to do the essay, according to The Associated Press.
When she heard about it, Vanden Wyngaard said she “thought the assignment was ill-conceived, I thought it was inappropriate, I thought it was an absolute, not only misjudgment just horror I can’t describe it in any other words,” according to HudsonValley.ynn.com
