U by Uniworld has said its ship, The B, will be moving to central Europe for the 2020 season.
With increasing demand for the  region, where sister ship The A also resides, The B will cease operation on the Seine river and resume cruising in the 2020 season with brand new itineraries.
“Being the first means that we’re not only inventing an entirely new sector of the industry, but we’re quite literally in ‘unchartered waters’.
“As a brand, U will always stay true to its ethos as a chic, fun, never-before-seen cruise experience, but we also want to remain open to consumer trends and feedback.
“That is how brands move from concepts to success stories,” said Ellen Bettridge, president of U.
“As we look forward, the demand is, overwhelmingly, pointing towards central Europe, where guests can experience a new city – and sometimes a different country – each day, which simply isn’t feasible on the Seine.
In 2020, The B will sail from Brussels
