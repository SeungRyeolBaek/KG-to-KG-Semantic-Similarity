YORK COUNTY, Pa. – The York County Industrial Development Authority (YCIDA) announced today that it has sold the Harley-Davidson West  Campus, the original site of the York plant, to NorthPoint Development.
The YCIDA purchased the 58 acre property in 2012 as part of Pennsylvania’s strategy to retain Harley-Davidson in the Commonwealth. The site’s location, accessibility and high profile made it an important redevelopment project for the county.
NorthPoint has submitted Land development plans to Springettsbury Township to develop a 750,000 sf industrial building. The $40 million project will be built as a speculative project as NorthPoint works to site a tenant for the property.
“NorthPoint’s investment in York County was premised on the strong transportation and logistics network, along with a strong skilled workforce in the area. From the beginning, we were impressed with the work of the YCIDA and their ability to make this transaction happen. As an organization we believe that capital goes where it is welcome, and we felt welcomed by the YCIDA and all the other governmental entities in
