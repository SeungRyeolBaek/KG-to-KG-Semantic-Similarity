The recent Supreme Court decision in NIFLA v. Becerra struck down a California law that required so-called “crisis pregnancy  centers” (CPCs) to disclose whether they are licensed medical facilities, and what health services they do and not offer. By a 5-4 margin, the ruling permits these fake women’s health centers to continue to hide important, basic facts, and dodge direct questions about reproductive health.
In Minnesota, the deceptively titled “Women’s Right to Know Act” requires individuals to receive state-mandated counseling before they can access a legal abortion.
