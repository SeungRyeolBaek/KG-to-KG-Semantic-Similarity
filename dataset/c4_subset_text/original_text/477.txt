A Canton-based food pantry that feeds hundreds of families across western Wayne County is getting a boost as it heads toward the Thanksgiving holiday. 
Open Door Ministry, which feeds about 430 struggling families every week, has been chosen for a food drive by Bayloff Stamped Products, a Belleville-based auto parts stamping plant, and Texas Roadhouse restaurant in Westland.
Adrienne Erwine, Bayloff administrative assistant, said it's important for those who have jobs and food to help those who don't.
"We recognize that we are very blessed," Erwine said. "We have jobs. We don't have to worry about providing for our families. We also have the capability to give back to our community."
Open Door helps families from communities such as Canton, Westland, Plymouth, Wayne, Livonia, Redford, Garden City, Belleville and others as far west as Ypsilanti and as far east as Inkster.
The latest food drive occurs 11:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 19, at Texas Roadhouse
