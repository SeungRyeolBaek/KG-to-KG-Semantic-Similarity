Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, musician Bob Dylan and astronaut John Glenn were among a select group of 13 Americans named by President Obama  Thursday as the latest recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.
The medals, which the president will present to recipients at a White House ceremony, recognize individuals who have made “especially meritorious contributions” to the security or national interests of the Unites States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant endeavors, according to the White House’s Thursday announcement.
Other than Ms. Albright, Mr. Dylan and Mr. Glenn, Mr. Obama also named Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, former Israeli President Shimon Peres, Novelist Toni Morrison, former University of Tennessee Women’s Basketball coach Pat Summit, worker’s rights leader Dolores Huerta and civil rights leader John Doar.
The president also chose William Foege, the physician who led the campaign to eradicate smallpox, Gordon Hirabayashi, who openly defied the forced relocation and internment of Japanese Americans
