UPDATE Oct. 10: CBS has given “Ransom” a second season. The original post is below.
Neither move is any  kind of surprise, as the two series were the lowest-rated shows on the network this season.
“Training Day,” a series-ification of the 2001 movie that won Denzel Washington an Oscar, debuted on Thursdays in February to modest ratings, averaging a 0.75 among adults 18-49 over six episodes there. CBS then shunted it to Saturdays to play out the remainder of the season. Its 18-49 average for the season as a whole is o.6, along with 3.47 million viewers, on the night it airs.
Star Bill Paxton died in late February, midway through the season (although after production had finished).
“Ransom” was a low-risk play for CBS on Saturday nights, as it was financed mostly by international partners. Had it brought in better ratings than the “Crimetime Saturday” reruns the network usually airs on the night, it could have been a win-win.
