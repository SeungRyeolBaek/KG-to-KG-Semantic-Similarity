Legislative Speaker Su Jia-chyuan yesterday bangs his gavel in the Legislative Yuan in Taipei to mark the passage of amendments  to the Referendum Act.
Lawmakers yesterday approved amendments to the Referendum Act (公民投票法) to lower the legal voting age and slash the thresholds for initiating, seconding and passing referendums.
The Legislative Yuan yesterday reviewed several motions concerning seven disputed draft amendments.
A proposed amendment to Article 2, which states that issues stipulated in the Constitution — such as the nation’s official title and territory — are not to be decided through referendums, was passed with the support of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the People First Party caucuses.
The New Power Party’s (NPP) motion to extend the scope of the act to cover the Constitution’s contents and to allow a new Constitution to be written was struck down.
The amended Article 2 also grants people the right to propose — through a referendum — laws to be considered
