Drug Control Police claim to have dismantled a drug-trafficking gang with links to the Mexican Sinaloa cartel.
After raiding homes in  Santa Ana, southwest of San José, and the southwestern Hatillo neighborhood, police announced the arrests of a Tico, last name Guillen, the alleged ringleader, and a Cuban, last name Lizazo. The men are also known as “Pelón” and “Manny,” respectively. Lizazo is now a naturalized U.S. citizen.
According to a Public Security Ministry press release, Lizazo and Guillen, 40, reported to an unidentified woman in Mexico who is linked to the Sinaloa cartel.
Public Security Vice Minister José Torres said the gang brought drugs from Panama, stored them for a short time in Costa Rica and then shipped them to Mexico, with the United States as final destination.
Authorities began investigating the gang in February and achieved their first results when they arrested two Mexicans, last names Amezquita and Sánchez, in April after seizing 299 kilograms of cocaine stored in a remodeled house
