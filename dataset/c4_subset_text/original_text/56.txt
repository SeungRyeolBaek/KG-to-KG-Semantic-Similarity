The Eagles, after trading LeSean McCoy to the Buffalo Bills, might have found his replacement.
A person with knowledge of the situation, who  requested anonymity, told NJ Advance Media that the Eagles have expressed interest in free-agent running back Frank Gore.
That person said a deal with the San Francisco 49ers star could get done as early as Tuesday, the first day free agents can sign with another team.
At this point, teams are not allowed to offer contracts to free agents. It is not clear how much it might cost the Eagles to sign Gore.
Gore, 31, finished last season with 1,106 yards on 255 carries and four touchdowns. One of 13 running backs to gain more than 1,000 yards last season, he ranked 10th among backs in the NFL.
Gore ran behind one of the top offensive lines in the NFL. ProFootball Focus ranked the Niners' as the ninth-best unit in the league last season. The Eagles finished second overall on the list.
His 4.3 yards per carry average was nearly identical to McCoy's 4.2 yards per carry.
