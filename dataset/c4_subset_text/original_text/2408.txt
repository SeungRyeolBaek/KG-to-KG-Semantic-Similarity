Since fiscal year 2012, the number of Indiana children who entered foster care because of parental drug abuse has increased 230.6 percent.
Indiana has  more children in its child welfare system than any surrounding state — including those with nearly twice Indiana’s overall population.
Republican legislative leaders in Indiana said the higher number of Hoosier children in care indicates the Indiana Department of Child Services has problems that go beyond funding.
"There’s something wrong systemically," House Speaker Brian Bosma said Wednesday.
Indiana had 29,315 children in foster care during fiscal year 2016, according to federal data from the Administration for Children and Families. During that same time period, there were 23,646 children in care in Ohio; 19,998 in Illinois; 18,194 in Michigan and 13,016 in Kentucky.
Questions about Indiana's handling of child welfare cases hit fever pitch last month after former DCS Director Mary Beth Bonaventura sent a scathing resignation letter that accused Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office of cutting funding and services for families and continuing policies that "all but ensure children will die."
