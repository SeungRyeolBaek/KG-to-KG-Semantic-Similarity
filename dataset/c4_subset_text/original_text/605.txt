Plans are gathering pace for Bradford’s new City Library with the arrival of a new temporary children’s library in City Park today .
The opening of the new Park and Read facility coincides with National Bookstart Week, the national initiative supported by Bradford Libraries to encourage children to get into books from an early age.
Park and Read, which will be based at City Park’s pavilion, was officially opened by Councillor Ralph Berry, Bradford Council’s executive member for children's services.

The children's library will have a wide range of books for babies, children and young people – from birth to 16 years – as well as a programme of story times, rhyme times, events and activities.

There were stories and rhymes,
