Horsham are facing their toughest month of the season in February and go into it with no margin for error, according to manager Dominic Di Pa ola.
The Bostik League South East Division play-off race remains as tight as ever after the weekend’s results.
The Hornets emerged from a bruising encounter with a narrow 1-0 home win over Ramsgate to remain fourth in the table.
They have narrowed the gap on second-placed Hastings United to just four points, trail Ashford United in third by a point and are three ahead of Whyteleafe in the final play-off place.
Di Paola has been wary of their games in February for a while and has previously said it could make or break their promotion push.
They travel to East Grinstead on Saturday and host Hastings on Tuesday night. The following weekends see a trip to VCD Athletic, a home game against Three Bridges and a clash at Whitstable Town.
Di Paola stressed: “It’s a really tough February. We have Hastings and VCD Athletic in there. It’s probably our toughest month
