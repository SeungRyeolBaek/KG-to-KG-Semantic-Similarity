The Greater Orange Literacy Service (GOALS) will hold the 13th annual adult spelling bee April 29 at the Lamar Orange student center. The  event, which includes a box lunch will be from 11:30 AM until 1:30 PM. Kevin Steele, news anchor with channel 12 news, will be master of ceremonies for the event.
The bee will consist of teams of three spellers per team, which are sponsored by local clubs, organizations and local school districts. Each sponsor pays the $250 entry fee. Teams who have already entered include Lamar State College Orange, Lions Club, and the United Methodist women.
Teams can still register for the bee by calling the GOALS office at 886-4311 or by emailing goalsliteracy@sbcglobal.com. Team members will receive a book to study and will include “bee rules”. Words that are used come from the National Spelling Bee.
GOALS is a non-profit, tax exempt organization, and donations to the spelling bee can be made in several categories, including, ABC letters, $25 each; Queen Bee, $500
