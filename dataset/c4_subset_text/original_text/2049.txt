The latest attempt to unload a municipal building Windsor has been trying to get rid of for nearly a decade has failed.
But the city is hoping to at least finally be able to make some money off the long-vacated former social services building at 755 Louis Ave. by pocketing the $10,000 deposit left by the latest unsuccessful developer.
Mayor Eddie Francis said the city thought it had a deal for the sizable holding south of Wyandotte Street E., “but the person didn’t follow through.” City council this week agreed to pursue the deposit that municipal lawyers said is Windsor’s to keep.
The property now goes back on the market, Francis said.
That market has been fickle. The building was first put up for sale when Windsor’s social services department was consolidated from its various locations and housed in the 400 City Hall Square building in 2005.
