SEATTLE  Andrew Triggs did his best to keep the Mariners powerful offense at bay, but eventually it broke through.
After allowing the  first two runners to reach base in the fifth, Triggs hung a first-pitch slider to Nelson Cruz that was launched over the wall in left-center to break the tie and put the Mariners ahead 4-1 as the As eventually fell 6-3 for their third straight loss.
Triggs had allowed Mariners (17-11) base runners in each of the first four innings, but had managed to limit the damage to just one run before allowing the homer to Cruz. He proceeded to allow the next two batters to reach base after Cruz before getting pulled for Trivino. Triggs failed to complete five innings, allowing four runs on six hits with three walks and four strikeouts on 86 pitches as he fell to 2-1 with his ERA now at 5.20.
Giving up the home run with two outs, made it a little more painful for Triggs, especially after retiring Robinson Cano right before Cruz.
