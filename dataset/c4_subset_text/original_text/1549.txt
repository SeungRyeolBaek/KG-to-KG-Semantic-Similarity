A number of disused commercial buildings could be demolished to make way for a new block of flats in Southend.
The planning application submitted  to Southend Council outlines the construction of two blocks on land behind a number of businesses on Prince Avenue.
The buildings will be comprised of 11 flats and would be built following the demolition of commercial properties which were once owned by a business that has fallen into administration.
Planning documents note that these building are now “far beyond repair” and have been subject to vandalism in recent months. If it was to be used for another commercial building “much larger commercial units must be proposed to make the site viable”.
The size and number of bedrooms in each flat is not detailed in the application but it does highlight that “all proposed residential units would comply with minimum room standards, each unit would have adequate cycle, car parking and bin storage”.
Many of the flats are said to include either a balcony or juliette balcony.
A total of 12 parking spaces will be included, along with a storage area for bicycles and a bin storage area.
