The Bulldogs season ended with a loss to Liberty in the NCAA Tournament.
SAN JOSE, Calif. â€“ Lamar Peters had a practice jersey wrapped  around his neck. He leaned back in the corner of Mississippi State's locker room at the SAP Center in San Jose, California.
He looked as comfortable as he could, and he looked confident, too. His Bulldogs were set to take on Liberty in the first round of the NCAA Tournament roughly 24 hours from the time he sat there and said he felt Mississippi State was ready to turn some heads.
Friday evening against the No. 12 seed Liberty Flames, Peters turned plenty of them as he scored 21 points and made four 3-pointers.
But the Flames turned more.
Liberty beat the fifth-seeded Bulldogs, 80-76, to oust them from the tournament much sooner than they would have liked. Mississippi State's season ended abruptly after blowing a double-digit lead down the stretch.
"It's just a tough, tough pill to swallow, especially the way we had the lead that late in the game," MSU head coach Ben Howland said.
