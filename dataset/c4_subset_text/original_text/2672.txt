KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Cricket Association (JCA) says it is “tremendously saddened” at the tragic and  untimely passing of a member of the cricket family, William Haye.
The former national representative played his part in advancing the best interest of the sport and would have inspired many of his contemporaries and many who succeeded him, JCA said in a statement today.
Haye, 69, was shot dead at his Four Paths, Clarendon home on Monday and his house set ablaze by gunmen.
“This is shocking news; our thoughts and prayers are with his family, close friends and associates in this their period of grief. The circumstances around his death as reported in the media are beyond unfortunate. We encourage anyone with information which may be useful to the police in their investigations to come forward,” JCA CEO Courtney Francis was quoted as saying.
Haye served the Jamaica team as a fast bowler in the 1970s and performed creditably at different points in his early cricket career for the parishes of St Catherine and Clarendon, the JCA
