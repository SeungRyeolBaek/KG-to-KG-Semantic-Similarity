On May 1, the center was once again open for business.
The crisis drew attention to a situation that is far from resolved.
" Forest Service budgets have been coming down because we're not cutting as much timber," said Linda Turner, a spokeswoman for the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The monument received just $750,000 from Congress last year, compared with $2.7 million in 1994.
To help deal with budget shortfalls, Congress created the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program in 1996, Turner said, which let Mount St. Helens, along with 100 other federally managed recreation sites, charge fees and keep 80 percent of the proceeds.
The fee system worked well at the monument in 1997, Turner said, but because of bad weather and lower fees, they came up short in 1998 and 1999.
Total fee revenue dropped from $2.3 million in 1998 to $1.4 million last year, according to Forest Service figures.
