CHICAGOâ€“UAL Corp.'s United Airlines yesterday became the latest airline to begin charging $15 (U.S.) to check a  single bag on domestic flights, matching the controversial fee launched in May by AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, hoping to offset soaring fuel prices.
The parent of the Number 2 U.S. airline said it also raised the fee it charges to check three or more bags, overweight bags or items that require special handling to $125 from $100, or to $250 from $200, depending on the item.
The changes apply to customers who buy a ticket on or after June 13 for travel within the U.S. and to or from Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands on or after Aug. 18. The $15 fee doesn't apply to some United loyalty-plan clients.
Such fees are part of a broad effort by airlines to charge passengers for services once included in the price of a ticket. Some charge for in-flight meals, drinks and snacks.
United said fees for checking the first and second bags would generate about $275 million a
