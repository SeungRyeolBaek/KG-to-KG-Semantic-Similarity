The wife of a former ANC employee arrested for a Soweto cash heist says she does not believe her husband is guilty.
“I was so shocked. I’m not even coping. I have lost weight because I can’t even eat. I can’t talk to him and ask him to explain what is going on‚” the woman told eNCA.
She said her husband’s lawyer told her that witnesses called for an identity parade did not point Errol Velile Present out.
“They said he was not there. No one was identified. I don’t understand why he is still being detained if they have nothing on him‚” the woman said.
Present‚ who until Wednesday was an ANC employee at the party’s Luthuli House headquarters‚ stands accused of being involved
