But while disruptive opportunities abound for AI, there’s also no shortage of challenges to overcome. Anyone who has tried their hand at training a  fledgling AI will tell you, there’s one hurdle that eclipses them all: removing a human from the loop.
It’s no secret that scaling AI typically involves human agents operating as a safety net, working in the background and ready to take the controls when a bot gets stuck. Even Facebook, an early pioneer in AI and intelligent chatbots, needs an occasional human hand to ensure a high-quality user experience.
While this offers an effective way to get AI off the ground, complete autonomy is the ultimate goal. How do you get there? As we learned firsthand building Mezi, it starts with picking the right vertical and then mastering the hand-off.
One of the greatest misconceptions about the field of artificial intelligence is that there will be “one AI to rule them all.” In reality, we’re far more likely to see an AI landscape dotted with countless highly specialized AIs than one dominated by artificial general intelligence (AGI).
