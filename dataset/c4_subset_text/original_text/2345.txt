While the political ramifications of dependence on Russian natural gas are a current topic of debate within the European Union, often the talk fails to address a much  larger issue of whether or not the importing of Russia’s natural gas will help to meet the EU’s growing demands.
So argues physicist Bengt Söderbergh, who recently completed a dissertation on an assessment of future Norwegian and Russian gas export levels.
According to forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA), production of natural gas within the EU will decline from the 2006 level of 216 billion cubic metres per year (Gm3/year) to 90 Gm3/year by 2030, even as demand for gas is expected to rise significantly. The need to import gas will accordingly increase by up to 90 per cent during the period. Russia and Norway are currently the most significant suppliers of gas to the EU. Their combined share of the EU’s gas imports during 2006 was 62 per cent.
As part of Söderbergh’s analysis with regard to the future levels of Norwegian and Russian gas exports to the EU, Norwegian and Russian
