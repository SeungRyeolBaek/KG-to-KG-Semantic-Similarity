There's been growing recognition in the region that entrepreneurs, innovation, advanced technology and fresh ideas will be essential to remaking Erie into a vital,  forward-facing community.
What better time, then, to restart the Innovation Erie Design Competition as a means to solicit and nurture ideas that could lead to new businesses here? And what better venue for the competition, after a one-year hiatus, than the Idea Lab at Blasco Library?
The competition is centered on people in a variety of disciplines — science, art, manufacturing, engineering, design — entering original ideas for products that could be made in Erie and lead to the creation of new businesses. Participants will receive support from regional and national product development experts at a design lab later in February and early March.
It will be held at Blasco's Idea Lab, which opened in the fall of 2017 as a catalyst for the sort of brainstorming and innovation the contest aims to foster.
As reporter Matthew Rink detailed on Wednesday, the competition was launched in 2008 by Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, Penn State Behrend, Civitas and the Erie Art Museum. Previous
