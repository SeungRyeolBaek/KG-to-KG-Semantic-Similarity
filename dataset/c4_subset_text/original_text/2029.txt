The upcoming referendum for Hinsdale High School District 86 is of course critical to our community. It will determine whether we continue the long history of  excellence in education in our schools or tell our students they will have to settle for less in the future.
It will determine whether we are a destination area for families buying homes, or an area where the value of our investment plummets. There is one other critical issue that will also be determined by this vote on April 2.
This referendum will determine for all future elections whether the road to success on the ballot is through transparency and fact, or by lies, deceit, intimidation and bullying. It is not overstatement to characterize this election as good vs. evil.
If the no faction succeeds in manipulation of the electorate, if voters believe their blatant lies, future elections will follow their example, where anything can and will be said because the voting public is too apathetic or gullible to discover the truth.
There is so much at stake on April 2, and I fear that our community and the way we chose to raise our families and live our lives will be changed forever. Please
