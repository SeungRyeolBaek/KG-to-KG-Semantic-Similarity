Our no. 1 sneaker of 2014 just got a serious upgrade in the form of the adidas Pure Boost ZG Prime.
We first  previewed this sneaker in January, and now the next-gen of Pure Boost has arrived. This model mixes a full-length Boost midsole with a layer of EVA on the outsole to produce what adidas calls a "floating sensation," hence the &apos;Zero Gravity&apos; (ZG) part of its name.
That&apos;s not the only key feature here, as this version of the Pure Boost ZG also features a Primeknit upper for a cozy and adaptive sock-like fit. It&apos;s then finished off with leather tabs at the tongue and heel, adding a premium touch to an otherwise sporty silhouette.
If for some reason this Primeknit variation isn&apos;t quite your cup of tea—or out of your budget—there&apos;s also a less expensive mesh-based version dropping this summer.
The adidas Pure Boost ZG Prime is now available in black
