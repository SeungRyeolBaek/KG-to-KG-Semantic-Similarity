Prepare for more steamy royal lurve.
For anyone out there foolish enough to think that ITV's latest drama smash Victoria would only be  a one-off, you can now relax.
Jenna Coleman will definitely be back for a second series next year, as the channel has ordered another run.
Tom Hughes will also return as the dashing Prince Albert, while Daisy Goodwin will continue to write the show.
Victoria has proved to be a ratings winner for ITV since it launched in late August, averaging around 7.7 million viewers and managing to beat rival Poldark over on BBC One.
Speaking of the next series, Goodwin said: "Even though she reigned in the 19th Century, Victoria is a heroine for our times. In the next series she faces the very modern dilemma of how to juggle children with her husband and her job.
"As Victoria will discover, it's hard to be a wife, a mother and ruler of the most powerful nation on earth!"
Victoria is Jenna Coleman's first major TV project since leaving Doctor Who - and she was admittedly reluctant to sign on at first.
