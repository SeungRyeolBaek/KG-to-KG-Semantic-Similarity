Joey Bada$$ has been working hard all year to push his creativity, and we're seeing more of his skills as a director in his  new "Temptations" music video. The All-Amerikkan Bada$$ rapper's new visuals take us back to his hometown of Brooklyn, where he journeys through his old neighborhood.
The new video, which was released exclusively to Tidal, represents the New York native's experiences in the borough during his childhood, taking us through a house with two children, while he soon follows around a little girl. Bada$$ narrates some of the different people in the household before making his way outside into the neighborhood. The visuals end with the rapper dropping off the little girl with her mother before joining others inside of a church.
Towards the end, the song also features a speech made by 9-year-old Zianna Oliphant back in September 2016 in front of Charlotte City Council.
After releasing his anticipated sophomore album this year, Joey Bada$$ was recruited to join Logic for his Everybody Tour, which they are currently embarking on around the country
