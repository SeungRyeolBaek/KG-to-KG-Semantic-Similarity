Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean is leading a team of younger political leaders to Brunei for a four-day visit at the  invitation of Crown Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah. The delegation left Singapore yesterday.
DPM Teo will reaffirm the close bilateral ties between the two countries and explore new areas where both can learn from each other and work together on, said a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).
The visit is the fifth edition of the Young Leaders' Programme (YLP), an annual exchange of visits that was started in 2013 to enhance relations.
The two countries enjoy what the MFA has called a "special relationship", underscored by frequent high-level exchanges between leaders. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong visited Brunei for Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's Golden Jubilee celebrations last month. Sultan Bolkiah visited Singapore in July to mark 50 years of Singapore-Brunei currency interchangeability.
The two countries take turns to host the YLP. Last year, Crown Prince Billah led a delegation of younger Bruneian leaders here
