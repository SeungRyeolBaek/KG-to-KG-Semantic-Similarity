Amid declining budgets and increasing priorities, Yale’s library system has begun to deepen partnerships with peer institutions to address upcoming challenges.
As the  University prepares for the arrival of 800 more students over the next four years, ensuring that students continue to have positive experiences at Yale’s libraries is an immediate concern for University Librarian Susan Gibbons.
“With the new colleges coming on line, we are going to need new staffing to support 800 additional students,” Gibbons said, adding that more librarians will be needed to help with undergraduate outreach programs and in majors where students have senior theses. Gibbons also estimated that with the coming increase in the University’s undergraduate student body, the library will need to spend an additional $1.2 million for electronic content licenses annually.
The challenges are exacerbated by the library’s funding structure. According to Gibbons, about three-quarters of the libraries’ budget comes from the return on over 600 library-specific endowments that are managed by the University Investments Office, with the rest coming from general appropriations provided by the Office of the Provost
