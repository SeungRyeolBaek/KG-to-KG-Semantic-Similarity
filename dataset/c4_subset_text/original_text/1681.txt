Marguerita Vonral says she grew up on a "rough" Glasgow housing estate but she always knew she was different.
This could be  because she was the granddaughter of one of the city's most-feared gangsters, Walter Norval.
Marguerita, who is now 34, admits she comes from a crime family but assures everyone: "I'm not a criminal".
Mags - as she is often known - was brought up in Milton by her mum and two sisters.
She says her "granda" was her father figure.
He was also widely known as Glasgow's original "Godfather".
Norval started his criminal career at a young age working for Glasgow's top crooks.
Throughout the 60s and 70s he created his own gangster empire, including pubs and clubs, with money he made from protection rackets and later armed robbery.
Unlike other gangsters, he is said to have refused to get involved in drug-dealing.
Norval was jailed for 14 years in 1977.
He died in 2014, aged 85.
