Lee, who led the team in receptions in 2017, was carted off the field Saturday night after Atlanta Falcons cornerback Damontae Kazee delivered a helmet-first hit to his knee. Tests confirmed what everyone in the stadium expected after seeing Lee's knee buckle: The injury was severe.
Analysis: Lee is nearly a lock to be back with Jacksonville since his $7.25 million salary in 2019 is guaranteed. The Jaguars will miss him, although it's unclear how much considering Marrone's offensive philosophy features a smash-mouth ground attack.
