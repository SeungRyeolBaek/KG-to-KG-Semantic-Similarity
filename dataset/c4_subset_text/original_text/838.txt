PwC must pay a $25 million penalty for misconduct in connection with a report submitted to regulators on behalf of a banking client.
An  accounting firm that's supposed to help keep banks from breaking the rules ended up breaking the rules itself, improperly altering a document sent to regulators after it was pressured by a banking client.
As a result, PwC, also known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, is being suspended and must pay a $25 million penalty.
The New York Department of Financial Services is prohibiting PwC from doing certain consulting work for banks it regulates for 2 years. In addition to paying the fine, PwC has also agreed to change procedures to make sure the misconduct doesn't happen again.
Regulators say PwC changed the warning language in a report it submitted for its client, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi. The language originally pointed out that the Japanese bank had done wire transfers on behalf of countries that face U.S. sanctions, such as Iran and Sudan.
But, after pressure from the bank, the language was whitewashed so it was less likely to trigger red flags
