LAVALLETTE, N.J. (CBSNewYork) – A Jersey shore town is determined to always remember a teen whose life  was cut short in a senseless murder.
With bags of cement on their shoulders, friends, family, and even strangers worked to cement Brendan Tevlin’s memory into a playground in Lavallette.
“We’re all heartbroken, we’re all devastated by it, it’s just something you never imagine would happen to you. Family friends have been the rock that has gotten our family through this,” the teen’s god mother, Kathleen Magnier said.
Tevlin’s family says the Jersey shore was a special place that helped shape his life motto.
“’Good vibes and easy living’… he lived it and he loved it. He was a surfer who spent days on the beach. This is a great town and a great place to have a playground,” Tevlin’s father Michael told CBS2’s Meg Baker.
