The US National Security Agency wants a quantum computer – and has dedicated &dollar;79.7 million to the technology, according to the latest top  secret government documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to the Washington Post.
It is no surprise that the NSA is pursuing such a potentially powerful technology, nor does the revelation pose an immediate privacy threat – the documents suggest that the agency is no closer to perfecting the technology than university researchers around the world. But if the agency does eventually realise its goal, what do citizens need to watch out for? And is there technology that would allow people to stay safe from quantum spooks?
Quantum computers promise to vastly outperform even the best ordinary computers at specific tasks by exploiting the weird properties of quantum mechanics. While a regular PC computes with bits that are either 0s or 1s, quantum machines use quantum bits, or qubits, which can be both simultaneously, and offer a computational speed-up.
One area quantum computers should excel in is factoring numbers into their prime building blocks. That could make them capable of breaking the internet’s most commonly used encryption methods,
