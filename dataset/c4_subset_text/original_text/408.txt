Jews and Arabs clashed repeatedly in the mixed Mediterranean coastal city of Akko (Acre) during the Yom Kippur holiday. Police are  on high alert.
An Arab driver nearly ran down a group of Jews in the street, the latter - fearing a terror attack - stoned him, and Arabs rioted and vandalized Jewish property in the mixed northern coastal city of Akko (Acre) during the Yom Kippur holiday and fast. Clashes began Wednesday evening and lasted through Thursday night. Police are on alert to prevent further provocations or acts of vengeance.
The day of violence began Wednesday evening, just after the start of the Yom Kippur fast, when an Arab driver from Akko's Old City entered a majority-Jewish neighborhood at high-speed. The vehicle raised suspicions, as in Israel it is considered unacceptable for anyone other than emergency vehicles to drive on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, although it is not forbidden by law. The driver had to bypass a barrier set up to block traffic at the entrance to the neighborhood.
