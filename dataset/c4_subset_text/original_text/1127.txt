Ordinary mortals might not be able to own a real Bugatti supercar but the new Lego version is just as much an engineering marvel.
 Billund in Denmark has no business having an international airport. The tiny town has a population of just six thousand people and yet there are four flights a day to the UK alone. There is one reason, and one reason alone, for this: Lego. Billund has been dedicated to the manufacture and promotion of Lego bricks ever since they were first invented in 1949, and the town now houses not only the company’s headquarters and the majority of the world’s Lego factories but also the first Legoland theme park and the newer Lego House – a cross between an activity centre and a museum.
It’s there that the world’s press were invited late last week, to unveil the company’s latest collaboration with a fellow household name: car maker Bugatti.
Lego’s business may seem like child’s play but they last year regained the accolade of the world’s most powerful brand, denied to it by Disney in 2016
