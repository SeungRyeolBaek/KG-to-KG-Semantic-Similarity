I've been following solar-powered aircraft for many years, ever since the BMDO's shadowy plan for a long-endurance anti- missile craft called Raptor ("Responsive Aircraft Program for Theater Operations" -this was long before the F-22 acquired the name). NASA's record-breaking solar HELIOS UAV disintegrated mid-air in 2003, but there has been a lot going on since then. Now British military spin-off Qinetiq has also started breaking records with the same concept.
The duration of the flight exceeded the current official FAI world record for unmanned flight which stands at 30 hours 24 minutes set by Northrop Grumman's RQ-4A Global Hawk on 22 March 2001. However because there was no FAI official present at White Sands it may not stand as an official world record.
Launched by hand, Zephyr is an ultra-lightweight carbon-fibre aircraft with a wingspan of up to 18 metres but weighing just 30 kg. By day it flies on solar power generated by amorphous silicon arrays no thicker than sheets of paper
