THUMBS UP to Frank Kelly, president and chief executive officer of Danbury Hospital, for receiving the prestigious Cecil Previdi Award this year  in recognition of his many contributions to the Greater Danbury community. Kelly's heartwarming acceptance speech Friday at the annual Leaders Luncheon of the Greater Danbury Chamber of Commerce brought a standing ovation from the hundreds of people in attendance.
THUMBS DOWN to the acts of thievery in which a person or persons last week raided an untold number of mailboxes along at least a half-dozen streets and outside a pharmacy in New Milford. Opened and discarded mail was found and police say it indicates cash presents and other goods were looted. The frustration for residents of losing items is heightened by the fact that it is difficult to know exactly what was never received.
THUMBS UP to the Crouch quadruplets -- Ray, Ken, Carol and Martina -- who all have been accepted for admission to Yale University. It is a remarkable achievement, and perhaps a first for Yale. The Danbury High School seniors have made their family, school, and community proud of their accomplishments.
