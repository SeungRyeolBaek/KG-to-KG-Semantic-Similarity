A memorial service is planned for Fort Bragg City Councilman Jere Melo at 2 p.m. Sept. 10 at the Timberwolf Stadium  on Chestnut Street in Fort Bragg.
The high school football stadium has been called his greatest legacy to the community since its construction was one of many efforts he undertook during his 15 years as a councilman, which also included building firehouses and public parks. Melo also served as Fort Bragg‚Äùs mayor between 2000 and 2004.
Melo, 69, was shot to death Saturday morning when he and a companion stumbled on an opium poppy garden while looking for an illicit marijuana grow site on private timber land near the Noyo River and the Skunk Train rail lines, about four miles east of Fort Bragg.
Cal Fire announced Tuesday that it closed Camp One and the public firewood gathering areas of the Jackson Demonstration State Forest until further notice, and authorities are urging the public to stay out of the entire forest while the manhunt for the alleged gunman continues.
Details about the shooting and suspect Aaron Bassler, a Fort Bragg transient in his 30s,
