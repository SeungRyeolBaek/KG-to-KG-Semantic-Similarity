"'The Great Canadian Tromboning Show' isn't likely to happen, so I thought I'd apply for the Great Canadian Baking Show," he says.
In fact, Timothy planned to apply last year. "I had my form filled out, I had my audition video and then I read the fine print," he says. "It said 'You have to be 19,' and I was like, 'Aw shucks, I'm only 18.'"
