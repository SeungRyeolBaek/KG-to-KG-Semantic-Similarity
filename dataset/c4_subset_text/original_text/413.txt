(CNN) — Elephants are giant, cancer-battling super creatures that destroy damaged cells long before they become cancerous, scientists  say.
In a study released this week, scientists said elephant genes may provide a crucial clue in the fight against human cancer.
The mammoth mammals rarely get cancer, which has long bewildered scientists considering elephants have 100 times as many cells as humans.
“They should be 100 times more likely to have a cell slip into a cancerous state and trigger the disease over their long life span of 50 to 70 years,” scientists at the University of Utah said.
Yet they don’t. The cancer mortality rate for elephants is less than 5% compared with 25% in people, the study said.
A team of scientists from the University of Utah and Arizona State University said they can explain the lower numbers.
In their search for answers, they combed through elephant DNA and found a few deviations.
Elephants have extra genes that stop tumors long before they form.
They have “at least 40 copies of genes that code for p53, a
