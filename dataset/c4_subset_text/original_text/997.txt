Several new characters have been added to the roster for the Wii U's version of Super Smash Bros. We get to see quite a few new characters  on display for Nintendo's prime-time fighting game, including several new characters from Fire Emblem and the always indomitable Captain Falcon.
The trailer starts with Lucina battling it out against Falcon, while a downed Chrom lays in the corner. Falcon proceeds to lay a whooping on Lucina and preps for a Falcon Punch to finish the fight. However, Robin swoops in to save the day, giving Lucina some respite from the battle with Falcon.
The trailer then transitions from the cinematics to the actual gameplay, and we get to see Robin dropping some magnificent swordplay and magical spells against all on-comers.
Robin looks a lot like Palutena, as far as play-style goes. There's a strong mix of swordplay and magic attacks thrown into the mix that offers gamers what looks to be a nice mid and air game for players who don't like sticking to the ground.
Lucina, alternatively, is all about brute force and fast attack
