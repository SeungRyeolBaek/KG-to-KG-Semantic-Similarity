ARLINGTON, Texas >> Albert Pujols’ third-inning home run Monday night put the Angels in line for their second straight victory  and also moved him further up on baseball’s historic ladder.
With Mike Trout standing on second base after doubling in the previous at-bat, Pujols drove a 92 mph sinker from Texas Rangers left-hander Derek Holland 437 feet into the left-field seats.
It was the 569th career homer for the 36-year-old Pujols, who tied Rafael Palmeiro for 12th on the all-time list, and it was all the offense the Angels needed as they hung on to defeat the Rangers, 2-0, at Globe Life Park.
The veteran first baseman, who has nine home runs through 45 games, is on pace to hit 33 homers, which would put him ninth on the career list by season’s end, potentially passing not only Palmeiro but also Harmon Killebrew, Mark McGwire and Frank Robinson.
