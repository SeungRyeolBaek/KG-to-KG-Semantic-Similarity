Clearly the house prices and economic mini boom is timed to PEAK during the May 2015 at approx 12% per year, to just exceed the Labour  mini-boom into the May 2010 general election. Which therefore implies that the prospects for the Conservatives and to a far lesser extent the Liberal Democrats should continue to improve right into polling day. Although 12% will not be on par with the booms of the noughties of over 30% so house prices are suggesting a very similar election result for the Conservatives at least to that of 2010.

Thanks alot Nadeem! Was really looking forward to this. So to clarify if I'm looking to buy a house in the London suburbs it could well be in my favour to wait another 6 months?
Do you think a house is better in terms of value to flats because of the freehold and land associated? Even if for the same price as a flat you get a lower rental yield?
