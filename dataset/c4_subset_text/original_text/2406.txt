LOUIS VAN GAAL will be given another £150million to spend on "several" transfer targets this summer, it has been  confirmed.
The Manchester United manager parted with a similar amount last pre-season in a huge spending spree that included record signing Angel Di Maria for £60m.
And top of Van Gaal's list for this summer is Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels, who is valued at £30m and appears ready to leave Germany.
A senior club source told the Daily Star: "No deal has been done but he is someone we want to sign, like several others this summer."
United failed to sign a commanding centre-half last summer after reported talks with Hummels following the World Cup in Brazil broke down.
They will lodge a £30m bid once the transfer window re-opens, with Red Devils bosses willing to offer the 26-year-old a four-year contract worth £160,000 a week.
United have been linked to a host of Europe's top stars this spring after failing to significantly add to their squad over the January transfer window.
