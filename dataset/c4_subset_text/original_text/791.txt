This year marks the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War and the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. To mark the occasion, PBS is  airing a remastered edition of Ken Burns' landmark documentary series "The Civil War."
The nine-part series will air on five consecutive nights, from Sept. 7-11, the month that will mark the 25th anniversary of the series' first airing on PBS.
The new version of the series has been scanned frame-by-frame for a new high-definition print, which is touted as the first time viewers will get to see the series the way Burns originally shot it.
Burns was an established and Oscar-nominated documentarian when "The Civil War" first aired in 1990, but that series made him a household name. The first episode set a ratings record for PBS, with an approximate 38.9 million people tuning in. It went on to win a total of 40 awards, including two Emmy Awards, two Grammy Awards, a Peabody and the Lincoln Prize.
This is the second time the series has been remastered. It was previously digitally touched
