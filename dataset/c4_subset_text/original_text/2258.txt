SEATTLE, Sept. 27, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- NetMotion Wireless, a leading provider of mobile productivity and management software,  announced today the launch of Locality, innovative software that gives organizations the insight and visibility needed to optimize their cellular data deployments.
The operations of many organizations rely heavily on public cellular data networks. Companies make large investments in devices, monthly service plans and application development to connect mobile field workers to mission critical applications over these networks. However, despite their critical role, there are no tools available to monitor and manage the performance of these cellular deployments.
Recognizing the need for a product that provides organizations with the visibility they are accustomed to when analyzing the performance of their internal wide area network, NetMotion Wireless developed Locality. By gathering performance and location data directly from mobile devices, Locality provides a continuously updated and customized view of a cellular deployment.
The police department in Mesa, Arizona is one of the first organizations to deploy Locality. The business intelligence gathered from Locality has enabled the department to improve the effectiveness of their officers by addressing connectivity issues.
