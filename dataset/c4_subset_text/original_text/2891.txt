September 24, 2013 â€“ PBS today announced a collaboration with web video pioneer John Green, co-founder of the massively successful Vlogbrothers and  Crash Course channels on YouTube and author of New York Times #1 best-seller The Fault in Our Stars, and wife Sarah Urist Green, an art curator most recently with the Indianapolis Museum of Art, to produce a new weekly series for PBS Digital Studios called THE ART ASSIGNMENT. The series is expected to launch as part of the PBS Digital Studios YouTube network in early 2014.
While most art-related video on the web focuses on art of the past and the idea of creative genius, THE ART ASSIGNMENT will celebrate risk-taking in the creative process and the act of making. The series will highlight emerging and established artists working across the United States, with each artist creating an assignment that will serve as an open call for responses. Viewers create their own responses through photos or video to be posted to YouTube, PBS.org, and other social media platforms with the aim of sparking conversation and comments about the original assignment video as well as the responses.
