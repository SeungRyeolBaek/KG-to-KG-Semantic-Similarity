The Rotary Club of Royal Leamington Spa’s Trees of Light will be shining again on the Christmas trees outside Leamington Town  Hall and St Margaret’s church in Whitnash over the festive period.
Everyone is invited to have the names of their absent or departed loved ones displayed on lists near the trees and around the towns, in exchange for a donation to the Myton Hospices to support their work in Warwick, Coventry and Rugby.
Last year donations to the campaign reached a record total of £5,885, all of which went directly to the charity.
Rotary club president David Leigh-Hunt said: “Thanks to everyone’s generosity the Trees of Light have raised £66,000 since the inception of the scheme in 2001.
The Courier is supporting the campaign, and will carry the donation coupon each week up to Christmas alongside articles about the charity’s work.
Last year the Myton Hospices supported more than 1,400 people and their families needing compassionate end of life care.
The lights on the Whitnash tree will be switched on by Mayor
