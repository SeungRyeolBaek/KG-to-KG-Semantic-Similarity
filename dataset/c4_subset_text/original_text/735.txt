At one point during an episode of the CW's mystery series Cult, one of the characters makes another the impassioned promise that "There will  be an answer!" Given the show's intense love affair with metafiction, I wondered if the line might be a winking acknowledgement that it's only the latest in a long line of post-Lost series that revolves around a slowly unfolding puzzle, a subgenre that from its progenitor on has been long on teases and short on actual answers. I also thought to myself, they better give us that answer in season one because there's no way this thing's going to get picked up again. The end seems to have come sooner than I expected. Yesterday, the CW announced that its slot for the next three Fridays will be filled by reruns of The Carrie Diaries.
