KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- A police officer who was shot Tuesday while chasing suspects allegedly involved in a drive-by shooting, has died , police Chief Terry Zeigler said.
The officer was identified as Capt. Robert Melton. He was 46 years old and had been with the department for 17 years.
Zeigler told reporters the officer was looking for four people in a car some time before 2 p.m. when the vehicle was spotted and a chase began. The chase ended about two miles from where the suspects were initially reported to a 911 dispatcher.
"As Capt. Melton was arriving, the suspects bailed from the vehicle and opened fire," Zeigler said. "I don't have any more details than that."
Another officer who had just arrived called for assistance, police spokesman Thomas Tomasic said earlier during a briefing at the scene of the shooting.
Tomasic said he knew the officer who had been shot, calling him a "good friend, good person."
One person is in custody and two others who might be connected to the incident have been detained. Police are searching for
