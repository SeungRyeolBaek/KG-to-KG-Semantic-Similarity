I am a veteran of the Vietnam War, where I served in Army aviation as a crew chief/door gunner in 1968-69. We  flew in Hueys and supported ground operations all over South Vietnam. I was actively involved in the Tet Offensive and was proud to have flown more than 800 combat hours.
My mission was to protect my fellow soldiers while helping the innocent victims of a thankless war.
I survived my military experience with no physical damage, yet I still feel the burden of the huge responsibility we had as we did our jobs as U.S. soldiers. My heart swells with pride as I remember how difficult it was to go back into battle day after day, yet we knew the need to do so.
Our servicemen and women are always in harm's way, and they may sometimes question if Americans at home are doing the right things today. Many of us know all too well that our way of life still depends on the capable military people who are doing so many amazing jobs.
Our children's future depends on the positive outcome of the critical job they are doing. God bless them always.
