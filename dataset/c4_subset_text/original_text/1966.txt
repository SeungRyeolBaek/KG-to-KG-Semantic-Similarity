It's a well-known fact that some of our favourite seafoods come with an unsavoury dose of heavy metals like mercury. But there 's another group of chemicals that sometimes lace our tuna steaks, and the latest findings on them are anything but appetising. They're called persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and they do a bang-up job obstructing the human body's chemical defence system. That's according to an analysis published today in Science Advances, examining how ten POPs found in both tuna and human bodily fluids interact with a gatekeeper protein that shuttles unwanted toxins out of our cells. The findings suggest that ingesting even very small quantities of POPs can do bodily harm.
"These chemicals interfere with our chemical defence system's ability to operate, which can make us more vulnerable to drugs and other toxins," Amro Hamdoun, a biologist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and lead author on the study, told Gizmodo.
POPs have been around for a long, long time. One of the most infamous, the pesticide DDT, was developed during
