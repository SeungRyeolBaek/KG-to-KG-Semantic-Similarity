.In one of my previous columns, I already “predicted” about this result simply because she was, all along, telling the  “truth” based on her own effort to uncover it and bolstered by her immense knowledge and experience as BoC official for the last three decades.
On the other hand, those customs officials who managed to “convinced” Comm. Sid at the very start of this controversy that the lifters were ‘No Suspect’ (did not contain anything suspicious), did so simply to protect their back and their lucrative racket of getting a regular “tara” from each container van arriving at the piers, whether subject to X-Ray inspection or not.
I mean, if you are collecting from a low of P200 to a high of P1,000 per container for each container van, why would you not scamper to convince Comm. Sid -- and malign Coll. Mangaoang in the process -- that the SMYD containers that delivered the lifters to GMA, Cavite was “clear” of any suspicious cargo?
