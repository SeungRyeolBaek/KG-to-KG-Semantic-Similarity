Duck Down Records co-founder, Drew “Dru Ha” Friedman, is set to attempt to run the ING: New  York City Marathon this November … all in memory of his late father.
Friedman’s father, Harvey L. Friedman, passed away this past January, following a nine-year battle with Alzheimer. In preparation, Dru Ha has been training all summer, getting ready for the 26.2-mile race.
It will definitely be a run to remember.
“I wanted to do something extremely challenging in memory of my father and to raise awareness about this compassionless disease,” said Dru Ha. “Fans of Duck Down may not realize how instrumental my father was in assisting with incorporating and founding Duck Down. While he was a respected real estate attorney, he had little legal entertainment background, yet found the time to learn enough about the business to help negotiate our early contracts and offered unconditional guidance for Buckshot and myself.
Dru will be running and raising donations with the NYC Alzheimer’s Chapter Team: “Run 2 Remember.” People can
