Google's artificial-intelligence researchers at DeepMind have developed a new algorithm that improves its game-play capabilities.
After mastering dozens of 2D  Atari games, and whopping humans at Go, Google's DeepMind artificial intelligence (AI) is now taking on new 3D navigation and puzzle-solving games.
One of these new games that DeepMind's AI agents are tackling is ant soccer, in which it's learned how to chase down a ball, dribble, and then score a goal.
What's impressive, DeepMind's David Silver explained in a blogpost, is that its AI is capable of solving the ant soccer challenge "without any prior knowledge of the dynamics", reflecting recent advances it's made in'reinforcement learning' (RL), or learning through trial and error.
To get these results, DeepMind has combined RL with deep learning of neural networks and its Deep Q-Network (DQN), an algorithm that stores a bot's experiences and estimates rewards it can expect after taking a particular action.
It was this algorithm that allowed it to master dozens of 2D games on an Atari 2600,
