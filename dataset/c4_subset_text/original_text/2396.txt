They were among about 40 people who teamed up in pairs and participated in the inaugural ’Merica Summer Games through the Moshannon Valley YMCA.
The event was a way to bring people out to participate in what branch Director Mel Curtis called “obscure activities,” and raise money for programs that benefit the YMCA, local school districts and surrounding communities.
It included team games like ’Billy Bowling, knocking down trashcans with old vehicle tires, Cast Iron Skillet Toss, Hubcap Hurling, Bucket Pong, Cow Chip Fling, Toilet Seat Horseshoes and more.
All activities were held at the Philipsburg-Osceola Area High School football field across from the YMCA.
