If you're traveling to AC during the summer (or on fall weekends), you might want to spend a few hours at the Steel Pier amusement park . Opening nearly a century ago, Steel Pier used to attract thousands of visitors each day; even big-name performers like Frank Sinatra came to entertain. Its popularity slowed to a halt in the late 1970s, but – like many things in the AC – the Steel Pier is making a comeback.
Rides like the Rock-n-Roll, the Ferris wheel and the Drop and the Slingshot provide thrills and offer excellent views of the AC shoreline. But if you want an even higher flying view of the beach, you might take one of the helicopter rides offered here. To enjoy the rides, you will need to purchase tickets, offered by the single or by a book; special attractions, including helicopter rides, cost extra. Single tickets cost $1 and ticket books range in cost from $40 to $60, depending on how many you'd like to buy.
Hours vary by the season and the weather; visit the park's website before you go for additional information
