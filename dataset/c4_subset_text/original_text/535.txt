Apple's newest iPhone 3GS will be the most powerful yet with more robust graphics and a faster network connection when it hits on June 19 for $ 200 to $300, the company announced today during their annual World Wide Developers Conference.
The iPhone 3GS will hit the same week as the new game-centric 3.0 firmware for the iPhone and iPod Touch. The 3GS will sell for $199 for the 16GB version and $299 for the 32GB version. The original 3G will stay on the market for $99 with 8GB of storage.
Apple calls it "the most powerful, fastest iPhone we've ever made."
Apple says that the iPhone 3G S takes advantage of the OpenGL ES 2.0 standard for "stunning high-quality 3D graphics, making mobile gaming and other graphic intense applications better than ever."
With the 3GS, launching messaging is faster, viewing Excel is faster and loading SimCity is 2.4 faster. The 3Gs will include a 3MP autofocus camera, 30FPS VGA video capturing and supports OpenGL/Es and 7.2 Mbps HSDPA
