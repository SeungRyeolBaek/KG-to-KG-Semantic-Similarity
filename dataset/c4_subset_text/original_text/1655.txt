President Obama just got trolled on Snapchat by his youngest daughter, Sasha.
And, though the leader of the free world may be popular for  his orations across the nation, his daughters might be the exception to this rule.
As Obama explained to Late Night host Jimmy Kimmel during an appearance on Tuesday, Sasha Obama is constantly blanking his "Dad talks" â€” and then broadcasting them on Snapchat without his knowledge.
During a dinner one night, Obama revealed to his daughter that he was fascinated by the fact that Snapchat was "becoming so popular" among her age group and asked her to take him through the ins and outs of the app. Sasha quickly taught him how to scroll through the home feed, change filters, make faces and send them out.
"At the end of it, Michelle and I are sitting there and I said, 'Isn't this interesting.' And I started talking to Michelle about the implications of social media and what all this means," Obama told Kimmel, who aired a short clip of the president teasing his daughters' obsession with texting and selfies at a high school event last week.
