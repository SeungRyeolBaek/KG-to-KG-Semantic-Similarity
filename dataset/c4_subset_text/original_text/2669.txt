At Chinn’s farm, which turns over more than 10 million pounds ($13 million) a year, the workers pick the premium as paragus spears that can grow up to 20 cm a day by hand. Sometimes they pick them twice a day before dispatching them to customers such as Marks and Spencer (MKS.L). and Britain’s biggest supermarket, Tesco (TSCO.L).
Britain’s asparagus season is short and early - traditionally running from April 23, known as Saint George’s Day, to Midsummer’s Day in mid-June. It will be the first big test of the 2019 seasonal labor crisis.
Britain’s fruit and vegetable sector relies on up to 80,000 seasonal workers from the EU each year. Having previously been inundated with applications, labor agencies say interest dropped off in 2017 and 2018 as workers from Romania and Bulgaria opted to go elsewhere in the EU.
Concordia, a labor agency charity that finds EU pickers for British farms, said it now has to work much harder to recruit.
