Australian PM Tony Abbott says certain freedoms may have to  be forfeited in the name of security, after major anti-terror raids last week.
His government would seek broad powers to fight the rising threat of militant Islamists, he told parliament.
New laws would criminalise travel to conflict areas declared off limits.
Australian authorities believe at least 60 Australians are in the Middle East fighting with Islamic State (also known as Isil) and other militant groups.
Mr Abbott gave the example of an off-limit area as the city of Raqqa in northern Syria.
That is where a photograph was taken earlier this year and posted to social media of a young boy holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier. The boy is believed to be the son of an Australian jihadist.
"My unambiguous message to all Australians who fight with terrorist groups is that you will be arrested, prosecuted and jailed for a very long time; and that our laws are being changed to make it easier to keep potential terrorists off our streets," Mr Abbott said.
