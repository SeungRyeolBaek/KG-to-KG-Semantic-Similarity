WESTMINSTER -- Mayor W. Benjamin Brown yesterday denounced the City Council's Aug. 27 decision to begin a $1.6 million addition  to City Hall, saying he hoped the council would reconsider a decision that "didn't have to be made now."
The controversial 3-2 vote to go ahead with plans endorsed in a $40,000 space-needs study means the city would build a 10,000-square-foot addition to City Hall at more than $1.6 million.
"I am dismayed that we are all not on the same page," the mayor said in an informal press conference in his spacious first-floor office on Emerald Hill. "At the very least, I thought the council would consider the possibility of leasing space rather than building more of it."
Others thought that was where council members were heading as well. At its Aug. 14 meeting, the council said it would look into possible options inthe rental or purchasing markets.
Currently, 25 people work in the nearly 6,000-square-foot City Hall. The space-needs study conductedby Baltimore-based Cho, Wilks
