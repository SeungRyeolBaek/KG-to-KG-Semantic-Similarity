BRISTOL � A suspended Panhandle sheriff is going on trial for corruption charges in a case that has divided a small rural county.
BR ISTOL � A suspended Panhandle sheriff is headed to trial this week on misconduct charges in a case that has divided a small rural county and sparked yet another debate over Florida gun laws.
Nick Finch, the Liberty County sheriff, was arrested in June on felony charges of official misconduct and falsifying public records. Finch, who was removed from office by Gov. Rick Scott, is accused of personally intervening after one of his deputies arrested a resident accused of carrying a pistol without a concealed weapons permit.
Finch, who has pleaded not guilty, has repeatedly said that he let the man go because he is a believer in gun rights. He has drawn support from conservative media outlets and gun rights activists.
A jury was selected Monday in the trial that is expected to be wrapped up by Thursday.
During jury questioning, prosecutors made clear their position that the sheriff can't ignore laws he disagrees with. They plan to argue that Finch tried to destroy records that showed he intervened in the case.
