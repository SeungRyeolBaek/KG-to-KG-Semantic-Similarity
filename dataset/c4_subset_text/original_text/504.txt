Placer County Deputy CEO for Lake Tahoe Jennifer Merchant explains county staff's proposal to a full room during a town hall with the North Lake Tah oe Resort Assocition on May 3 at Granlibakken Resort in Tahoe City.
Placer County staff and the North Lake Tahoe Resort Association held a town hall on May 3 at Granlibakken Resort in Tahoe City to discuss a proposal that could change how revenue from the Transient Occupancy Tax is spent.
Under county staff’s proposal, which will require approval by the board of supervisors, the NLTRA would focus its efforts solely on marketing the region, and no jobs will be cut.
During the town hall on Wednesday, May 3, NLTRA board members Samir Tuma and Adam Wilson defended the resort association’s current role, and questioned the timing of the proposal.
Additional public meetings are scheduled for Monday, May 8, from 5-8 p.m. at the North Tahoe Event Center in Kings Beach, May 11 from 4-6 p.m. at the Placer County Administrative Center in Tahoe
