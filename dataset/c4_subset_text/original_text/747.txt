The temporary measure — which will fund the federal government through Feb. 8 — was the result of a Senate compromise. By terms of the compromise, Democrats agreed to back the three-week extension in exchange for assurances from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he will use that extra three weeks to negotiate an agreement securing the future of the so-called “dreamers,” undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children and whose fate was the source of much of the disagreement that led to the shutdown in the first place.
