History is filled with stories of bold pioneers who changed the world with their visionary ideas. There exists also, in the annals of innovation, a  rich tradition of mad scientists with crazy inventions. These two notions are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many celebrated breakthroughs were initially met with scorn and ridicule. We've compiled 11 such world-famous ideas from the history of science and technology. The temptation, of course, is to include those ideas that were scorned and should have stayed scorned. The Star Wars prequels, say. But we're trying to run a classy operation here.
Heliocentrism Galileo Galilei, sometimes called the Father of Modern Science, was among the first and most famous to pay a price for his crazy scientific ideas. Galileo publicly promoted the Copernican concept of heliocentrism -- that the Earth revolves around the Sun -- back when the Church and even most fellow mathematicians held to geocentric model. Unfortunately, in 17th century Rome, such radical ideas were quite literally heresy. Galileo was forced to recant and spend the rest of his life under house arrest.
