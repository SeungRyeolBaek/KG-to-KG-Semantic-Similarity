The California ban on single-use plastic bags is a huge step toward reducing litter, but it might not be as effective a change as its advocates  assume.
On Sept. 30, Gov. Jerry Brown became the first governor to sign a statewide ban on plastic bags in grocery and convenience stores. Many California cities already instituted the ban earlier this year, including Los Angeles. In his signing statement, Brown stated that he hopes to encourage other states across the nation to follow our example and reduce their litter as well.
But this ban is only effective if people actually commit to reusing the bags they buy instead of opting to pay an extra few cents for a paper bag or buying another reusable bag every time they go to the store. Considering that consumers only have to pay a negligible sum of 10 cents for new paper bags, they must take it upon themselves to reuse the bags they buy.
For college students, whose advocacy has been instrumental in banning plastic bags both in the city of Los Angeles and the state of California, itâ€™s particularly relevant to make sure that we follow through with those efforts on our weekly trips to the grocery store.
