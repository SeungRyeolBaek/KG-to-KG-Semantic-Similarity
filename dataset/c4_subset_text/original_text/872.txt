DOBBS FERRY, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) — Police in Westchester County were searching Monday for the person who  has been sending disturbing mail to several women in Dobbs Ferry.
As CBS 2’s Scott Rapoport reported, the women said the letters contained threatening and sexual comments.
“I think it’s dreadful,” said resident Janet Rosenberg.
Police said several women in the quaint, quiet village have received the creepy and sexually disturbing letters in the mail. But police would not discuss the incidents on camera.
Police sources told CBS 2 the letters have been appearing in Dobbs Ferry for five years now. The letters have been sent sporadically, with the most recent one having been received in the last few weeks, police said.
Authorities would not say how many letters there have been, or how many women have received them. But another law enforcement source told CBS 2 the letters have also been sent to women in other parts of Westchester County over the years.
Hundreds of letters may have been sent in all.
