CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. – The Academy of Business and Finance at Clarksville High School is adding up their numbers.
They have 72  incoming freshmen and, according to Academy administrator Shannon Cummings, they even took in a few extra sophomores.
The Clarksville-Montgomery County School System's topic-based academy system is designed to graduate college- and career-ready students.
Each high school has one of these “schools within a school” aligned with a specific career or college preparatory theme. These create small learning communities where a select group of students with a common interest share many of the same teachers, allowing educators to coordinate lesson plans and classroom activities around the academy theme.
Cummings said more than 10 percent of academy students from each freshman and sophomore class is from outside the CHS school zone.
Cummings feels that getting the word out about the variety of academies, and having guidance counselors talking to their middle school students, has helped.
Sophomore Cody Spurgeon thought last year was a good experience. He feels the academy taught him what planning he needs to do if
