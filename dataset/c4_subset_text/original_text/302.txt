We learned last week that the radio show Brian Ward and I host on AM 1280 the Patriot is coming to an end. The station has sold our  12-1 hour on Saturdays to someone who is willing to pay for the privilege of broadcasting. They are working on selling the 11-12 hour and expect to do so within the next few weeks. Apparently the amount the station can command by filling the time slot with infomercials exceeds the advertising revenue for our show, even though our ratings have been good. Very good, if you take into account our zero budget and the station’s erratic signal, and add those who listen on the internet.
But that’s how it goes. Our relationship with WWTC has always been a marriage of convenience; no money ever changed hands. Because they didn’t pay us, the station never told us what to do. It’s been a remarkable thing, over the last five or six years, to be able to commandeer a radio station for two hours a week to do whatever we wanted. I’ve often said that everyone should have a radio show.
