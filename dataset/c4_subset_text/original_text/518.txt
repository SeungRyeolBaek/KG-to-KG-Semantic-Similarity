Sunday will  be the 42nd annual Earth Day celebration. Here are 10 ideas for commemorating the day, observed each year on April 22, or exploring issues related to the environment in the classroom or home on any day of the year.
When was the first Earth Day (PDF), and what major themes did it address? Are these themes still relevant today? How has Earth Day changed since 1970? In the past five or 10 years? Since the year in which you were born? How had public attitudes and environmental concerns changed by the time Earth Day hit 20 and “shed its humble roots”? How has going global shifted its focus? And how has “green” turned into big business 40 years later?
After searching for Earth Day coverage over the years in the Times archives, students make posters intended to aesthetically and thematically represent Earth Day celebrations from various years.
Alternatively, they investigate who coordinated the first Earth Day and what personal experiences shaped his attitude about preserving the environment.
