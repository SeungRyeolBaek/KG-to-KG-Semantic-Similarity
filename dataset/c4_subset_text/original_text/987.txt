The University of Michigan is using a $3 million gift from attorney Mark Bernstein and his wife to move one university program onto campus property, while another  $3 million fund will help find off-campus applications for engineering and medical innovations at the school.
Bernstein, president of The Sam Bernstein Law Firm PLLC in Farmington Hills and a member of the University Board of Regents, and his wife Rachel Bendit made the donation toward a proposed Bernstein-Bendit Hall on the Ann Arbor campus.
The new building will relocate the William Monroe Trotter Multicultural Center from an off-campus building on Washtenaw Avenue. The board approved the building name at a meeting Thursday.
"Rachel and I are honored to support the legacy of all who have advanced the enriching and empowering mission of Trotter since its founding â€” the generations of U-M students who have been activists for diversity, and the current U-M students whose advocacy helped guide the vision for this new building," Bernstein said in a statement.
In a separate vote on Thursday, the regents also approved a new Monroe-Brown Seed Fund,
