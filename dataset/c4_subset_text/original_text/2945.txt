Airtime may have launched with a bang, but its end was eerily quiet: Sean Parker’s video chat startup, which  once aimed to become the next Chatroulette, shut down its web app some time during the last month, and no one even noticed, or bothered to complain.
The site was still up and running in mid-August, according to the Internet Archive, but has since been replaced by a placeholder site that asks us to “stay tuned,” and lists a number of jobs on both coasts. There’s no mention of the shut-down on Airtime’s blog, which was last updated two years ago, or its long-abandoned Facebook and Twitter accounts.
Even more striking: I couldn’t find a single mention of it on Twitter — it looks like users had given up on the site long ago, and no one even bothered to check if it’s still around. I sent Airtime an email, asking when exactly the web app was taken offline, but have yet to hear back, and will update this story once
