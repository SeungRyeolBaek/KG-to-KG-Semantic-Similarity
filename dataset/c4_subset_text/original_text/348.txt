A class action suit has been filed by a Birmingham Alabama woman that accuses Apple of deceptive advertising in their claim that the 3G iPhone is "tw ice as fast" as the previous model. AppleInsider has more details.
Always referring to the device as the "Defective iPhone 3G," Smith and her legal team assert that e-mail, text, and most other downloads were considerably slower than what Apple promised. This in no small part stemmed from the reliability of the connection: the device would connect to 3G less than a quarter of the time to 3G even in areas AT&T says should provide "excellent" coverage, according to the lawsuit.
I've previously mentioned my problems with the lack of AT&T 3G coverage in my area when their online coverage viewer says it should be "excellent." However, Since AT&T installed a new tower in my area earlier this month, 3G and GSM reception has been appreciably better. For example, I can now receive phone calls in my house. Obviously, your mileage will vary.
But why Apple? Shouldn't the suit be directed
