WHEN predicting which planets beyond Earth could support life, astronomers usually follow the water. Exoplanets with rocky surfaces are declared habitable if they orbit  far enough from their star to potentially host oceans.
But as our planetary collection grows, and telescopes for studying them improve, some astrobiologists say it is time to narrow the hunt. Christopher McKay at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California has come up with an expanded “checklist” for habitability, which also considers factors like a planet’s light levels, radiation exposure and atmospheric composition (PNAS, DOI&colon; 10.1073/pnas.1304212111).
Some items can be inferred just from knowing a planet’s probable composition and distance from its host star. Others will require photographing the planets and examining their atmospheres. Spacecraft with those capabilities are now being developed.
“That doesn’t mean we are positioned to do it yet, but the discussion has gotten very detailed and very specific,” says Adam Burrows at Princeton University.
The list may one day pinpoint worlds that
