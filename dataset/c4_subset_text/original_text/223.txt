Nuance Communications has announced that IP Australia will become the first organisation across the Asia Pacific region to add next generation automated machine learning and human- assisted artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to its widely successful Alex online virtual assistant.
Alex, based upon Nuance’s Nina Virtual Assistant platform, provides AI-powered customer service on the IP Australia web site, engaging with citizens in human-like virtual chats. Launched in August 2016, Alex is achieving 80 per cent first contact resolution through powerful conversational AI and question-answer capabilities.
The latest in machine learning enables the virtual assistant to learn from ingested organisational content and human agent’s responses, enabling Alex to independently handle increasingly complex enquiries over time. This is what Nuance calls the human assisted virtual agent, the latest in supervised AI technology.
Currently, IP Australia’s online virtual assistant powered by Nuance’s Nina technology delivers a dynamic and engaging customer experience that lets customers easily understand trademark, patent, designs and plant breeder’s rights processes. The human elements of dialogue and personalised interaction connect customers to the right information and tools
