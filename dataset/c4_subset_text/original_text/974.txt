Photo sharing site 500px announced on Friday plans to roll out Creative Commons licensing on the service.
While photos on the site will default to an  “all rights reserved” setting, 500px users will now have the ability to select Creative Commons licensing as an option when uploading new photos to the site or editing existing images.
A licensing option already available to photographers on some other photo-sharing sites such as Flickr, Creative Commons allows photographers to designate certain photos as images that they are willing to share with others. Sites such as Mashable, for instance, might use a photo with a Creative Commons license to accompany a news post.
Users will be able to search through photos on the site based on licensing, allowing for quick access to the types of photos they’re looking for.
A longstanding request from 500px users, CEO Oleg Gustol told Mashable that the company decided to add the functionality in order to create the maximum value for the site’s community.
"We want to give our photographers as much flexibility as possible to spread their work and build their profiles and businesses," says Gutsol.
