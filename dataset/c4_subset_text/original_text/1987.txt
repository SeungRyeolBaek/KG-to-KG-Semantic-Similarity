Lancaster maintained the pressure on leaders Longridge on Saturday in the Moore and Smalley Palace Shield Premier Division.
Brendan Hether ington’s men retained their position in second spot in the table after crushing Thornton Cleveleys at Illawalla.
Lancaster posted a huge 293-8 after winning the toss and electing to bat and that proved to be a daunting target for the home side, who folded to 86-9 off 21 overs.
The visitors did not get off to the best of starts as both openers departed for low scores. Joseph Hills struck 10 before he was snaffled by Sam Robinson off the bowling of Jordan Beech, while the same bowler also accounted for Laurie Atkinson (9) – caught by Jack Northrop.
Ben Simm did not last long before he offered a catch to Joshua Sackfield off the bowling of Greg Tirrell for five.
However, Charlie Swarbrick then took charge as he took the game away from the home side with a superlative knock.
He struck a brilliant 80 off just 56 balls – a knock which included 12 boundaries
