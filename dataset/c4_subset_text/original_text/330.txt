We have an entire generation of folks who have no idea how to change the own oil in the car.
When one of my grandkids asked  me if I could sew a button on for her, I was amazed. Don’t you have a needle and thread I asked? No, she told me and I am not sure how to do it if I did.
I wondered if my eighth grade sewing teacher, Mrs. Barnes, was rolling over in her grave. I can remember hemming a tea towel over and over again when I was in school because I couldn’t get the stitches even enough to please her.
When I think how many things my grandkids have never learned, I realized I was glad that sewing was a requirement when I was in junior high school. It was certainly a pain at the time, but it gave me a skill I may never have had otherwise.
And while no one has ever asked me to prepare a Rosy Apple Compote, I remember that was one of the first requirements in my cooking class. Our cooking teacher also taught us the presentation was as important as the food itself
