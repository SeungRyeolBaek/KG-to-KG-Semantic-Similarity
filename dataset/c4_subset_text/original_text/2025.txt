The EU upgrade offer is more modest than proposals made last year by Israel which included summits of EU and Israeli leaders.
European Union states will  say on Monday they are ready to deepen ties with Israel but will urge the Jewish state to make progress on Middle East peace, diplomats said.
EU foreign ministers are expected to give the green light to the upgrade at talks in Luxembourg, hours before a scheduled meeting there with Israeli counterpart Tzipi Livni.
Diplomats said EU member states had agreed a text on their readiness to enhance ties with Israel in social policy, access to the EU market and regulatory issues, including reference to the need for progress in peace steps with the Palestinians.
The wording of any linkage between moves to deepen ties and progress in the peace process was not immediately available.
The EU upgrade offer is more modest than proposals made last year by Israel which included summits of EU and Israeli leaders, and meetings with EU sectoral ministers on top of the current annual session at foreign minister level.
Israel currently has a seven-year-old association agreement with the 27-member bloc setting out a schedule of political meetings
