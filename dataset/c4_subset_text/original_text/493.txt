Goldschmidt went 2-for-3 with a walk and a run in a win over the Brewers on Wednesday.
Goldsch midt sat at an unsightly.180 following an 0-for-5 day against the Dodgers on April 13. However, the slugger has subsequently hit safely in 11 straight games, a stretch during which he's laced three doubles, slugged three home runs and compiled nine RBI. He's raised his average 101 points as a result, but he'll need to continue whittling down a 26.4 percent strikeout rate that qualifies as his highest since his initial 48-game big-league cup of coffee in 2011 with the Diamondbacks.
Goldschmidt went 3-for-4 with a homer, two runs scored, three RBI and a walk in Monday's 13-5 win over Milwaukee.
St. Louis' offense was rolling all not with Goldschmidt at the forefront once again. The slugging first baseman has nine long balls and 18 RBI with a.958 OPS across 102 plate appearances.
