SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, Hawaii-- CS Gas or tear gas -- it's a smell that's familiar to most in the military.  Your skin begins to tingle as you approach the room as soon as the canisters are opened.
As you step inside the back of your neck feels hot. The muffled yells of the instructor order you to remove your mask. The first deep breath without a gas mask creates an uncomfortable situation.
Soldiers of Echo Company, 65th Brigade Engineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, conducted Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear training (CBRN) on Feb. 5, here on Schofield Barracks, Hawaii.
The training is done to prepare Soldiers for chemical attacks. Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile, commonly referred to as CS gas or tear gas is used to train Soldiers within the gas chamber.
Soldiers began the morning by lining up outside of the chamber doing checks on their masks to ensure their equipment works properly.
"Having confidence in your equipment is what can ultimately determine mission success," said
