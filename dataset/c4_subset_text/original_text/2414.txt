Mayor Bill de Blasio had good intentions.
That was the mayor's response Friday morning when asked about his administration's bungled civic engagement campaign,  which sent thousands of letters to voters across the city this week warning them that their registration status was inactive.
The letters, sent to 400,000 New Yorkers, encouraged voters to check their registration status just weeks before the November primaries, and days before the registration deadline. At least 30,000 letters were also sent in error, City Hall said this week — after initially blaming the Board of Elections for compiling a bad list.
The mistake caused a brief panic among some voters, who then flooded the Board of Elections wondering if there was a voting scam underway.
De Blasio acknowledged Friday that the city had mismanaged the effort — the first spearheaded by the recently created “Democracy NYC” office, which de Blasio created as part of his push to increase civic involvement.
“There is no question that this was a good idea where there was a problem in the execution,” de Blasio said Friday during his weekly appearance on "The Brian Lehrer Show. "
