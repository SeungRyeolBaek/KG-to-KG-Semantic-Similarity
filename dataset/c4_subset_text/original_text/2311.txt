McALLEN — A former U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer will serve 30 months in federal prison for taking a bribe in exchange for  approving a land crossing permit, court records show.
U.S. District Judge Randy Crane sentenced Jose Javier “JJ” González, 38, of Mission to a 30-month prison sentence on Tuesday for, among other violations, accepting a $500 bribe and then approving an “I-94” border crossing permit, court records show.
González, a former CBP officer working in the Rio Grande Valley sector, was arrested May 25, 2017, and charged with federal bribery and fraud charges, according to court records.
During Tuesday’s sentencing hearing, González, speaking on his own behalf, claimed that in his more than 10 years as a federal officer, “he had been a dedicated CBP officer” and had only made “one mistake,” according to a release from the Southern District of Texas U.S. Attorney’s Office.
