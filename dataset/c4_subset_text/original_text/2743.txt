Note that the author of the article was a mission president in Phoenix. He follows  journalistic style by not involving himself in the story. I'd be interested to know if he had a hand in arranging the surprise wegkend visit for Madeline. @Wif55. It woukd appear this girl had parental sanctioning for contact with the missionaries because her mother had taken her to church (she may be a "child of record") and her father arranged for her to fly across the Atlantic in a private jet for a weekend in SLC.

Great story, but triggers some questions. What happened to her mother, a former Mormon missionary? The topic is passed over in the story, but one wonders. More important: how does the church handle parental permission when a minor starts chatting with missionaries? According to Preach My Gospel, minors need to be taught with their parents or at least with explicit parental agreement. Is that rule being ignored in online missionary work?
