Nearby Jewish cemetery apparently used for building materials by the post-World War II Soviet occupation authorities.
Authorities in Vilnius, the capital  of Lithuania, are preparing to demolish a power substation that was built using tombstones looted from a Jewish cemetery, the Mail Online reported.
The use of tombstones was revealed on social media earlier this month by a local man who had noticed Hebrew and Yiddish inscriptions on the graffiti-covered walls of the substation. Archaeologists confirmed that the tombstones had been removed from a nearby Jewish cemetery.
The substation was built in the 1960s, while Lithuania was under Soviet occupation. Local authorities are investigating whether Jewish tombstones were used in the construction of other buildings.
Giedrius Sakalauskas, the local resident who made the discovery, said he had always thought there was something strange about the bunker-like structure outside the center of the city. "Why build an electrical substation with granite blocks instead of regular bricks?" he asked.
"I touched the stones and I realized that they're really gravestones," Sakalauskas told The Associated Press
