STOKE and Watford have both been charged by the FA for failing to control their players.
A number stars became embroiled in an angry  clash during Stoke's 1-0 win at the weekend after Troy Deeney grabbed Joe Allen by the face before appearing to gouge his cheek.
It even forced members of staff to leap from the bench to break things up.
And the two clubs could now be set for heavy fines following the news that Deeney had been charged with violent conduct.
He has until 6pm today to answer and faces the risk of being hit with a three-match ban.
It means Deeney could miss vital clashes against Everton, West Ham and Newcastle.
But Allen has since laughed off the incident, saying: "It was handbags really and there was nothing to it. I like Troy, he's one of the good guys, he's a really good player and it was nothing personal.
"He's a big guy and we were both laughing - I knew I was beaten in that situation, but I have a bit of a bad habit of picking the wrong fights!"
