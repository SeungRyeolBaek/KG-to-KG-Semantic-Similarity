After the box leaked online earlier this week, Lego has officially taken the wraps off its Simpsons set.
The Lego Simpsons set is coming, officially  confirmed by Lego: the house at 742 Evergreen Terrace has been turned into a massive 2325-piece set, with six minifigs: the five members of the Simpsons family and Ned Flanders.
The house itself is hinged, and the roof is removable, so that you can recreate some of your favourite Simpsons moments (except, perhaps, "various eggs"), with the rooms fully kitted out with furniture, appliances and accessories.
The set also includes a barbecue for Homer, a skateboard ramp for Bart and the pink Simpsons family car.
A lot of the pieces seem to have been custom-moulded for the set, too, including the minifigs themselves, Bart's skateboard and Homer's (well, Ned's) wheelbarrow.
Additionally, a Lego-themed Simpsons episode will air in May.
The set will go on sale on 1 February in the US and Europe, retailing for US$199.99. In
