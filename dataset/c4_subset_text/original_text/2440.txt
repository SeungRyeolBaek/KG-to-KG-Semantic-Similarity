The stunning vistas and colorful creatures in Mulaka are born from the myths and folklore of the Tarahumara people in northwestern Mexico. But  it was a challenge for indie developer Lienzo, since it only had an oral tradition to go on. It had to dream up all the designs while still remaining faithful to Tarahumara legend. Mulaka will launch in 2018 for PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.
The first episode of Lienzo’s behind-the-scenes video series explored who the Tarahumara are and why the studio was inspired to create a game around their culture. This second episode investigates the creative process of crafting a world from nothing more than just verbal stories passed through the community for generations.
“So we had to seek inspiration in who they are as people, in their colors, in their attire, in their ways of living,” said Lienzo’s art director Daniel Gutiérrez.
