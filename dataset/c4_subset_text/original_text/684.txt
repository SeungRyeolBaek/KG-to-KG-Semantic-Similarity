My particular interest is mainly in World Coins, and without a doubt, this is the place to go in the Pacific Northwest to buy, sell,  AND to ask questions. Don is a remarkable resource - courteous, professional and knowledgeable - AND his grading and pricing (1/2 of catalog value!!!) insures that ALL buyers become returning clients.
