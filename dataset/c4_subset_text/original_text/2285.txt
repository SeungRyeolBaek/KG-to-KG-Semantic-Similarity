The final round of this season's Scottish Championship fixtures has been moved from Saturday, 30 April to lunchtime on Sunday, 1 May.
R angers' visit to St Mirren has been moved to that date with a 12:30 BST kick-off for television coverage.
The four other games have been moved to ensure all games start at the same time.
Alloa host Dumbarton, Falkirk visit Morton, Hibs welcome Queen of the South and Raith Rovers are at Livingston.
Leaders Rangers, who host Dumbarton on Tuesday, need one more win to secure the title and automatic promotion to the Premiership.
The sides finishing third and fourth in the Championship will play-off over two legs with the winner progressing to meet the league's runners-up, again over two legs.

Falkirk are currently second with Hibernian third. Raith Rovers
