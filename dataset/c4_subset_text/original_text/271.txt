Police say a Hopedale man made it very easy for an officer to arrest him Wednesday he handed paperwork to the traffic cop that said his license  had been suspended.
Nykolas Karl Rosenberger, 20, was arrested after the 4:43 p.m. stop. He was originally pulled over for speeding, police spokesman Lt. Paul Shastany said.
Officer Keith Strange was on Click It or Ticket patrol when Rosenberger drove by him near Brigham Street and Warren Road. Police say Rosenberg's vehicle was traveling 41 mph in a 25 mph zone.
When Strange asked for Rosenberger's license and registration, Rosenberger said he had left his license at work.
"He said he had a letter from the Registry (of Motor Vehicles) in his glove compartment that proved who he was and had his license number," Shastany said.
The Registry letter showed that his license had been suspended for too many accidents subject to insurance surcharges.
"He basically gave the hammer and nails to the officer to seal his coffin," Shastany said.
Rosenberger, of 34 Inman St., was charged
