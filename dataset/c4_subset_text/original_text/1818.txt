Nicky Hilton has already cemented her status as a style icon, but the mom-to-be is clearly set to inspire our maternity wardrobe  dreams as well. Keeping cool New York breezes at bay, the socialite wore a brown sheepskin jacket over cool yet casual jeans and heeled boots for a Wednesday (Jan. 27) stroll, topping off the ensemble with a chic Louis Vuitton shoulder bag.
It was revealed earlier this month that 32-year-old Nicky is pregnant with her first child. The heiress tied the knot with financier James Rothschild at the Orangery in Kensington Palace Gardens in July 2015, and now her aunt, Kyle Richards, has confirmed the news in a sit-down interview with E!.
Nicky Hilton looked stylish as she stepped out in New York.
"Nicky's pregnant, and she's the first of the cousins to have a baby, so we're all really excited," the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star said. "I can't wait to see what that baby is going to look like. It's going to be gorgeous."
