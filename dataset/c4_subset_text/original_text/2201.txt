Walgreens is working to close its $9.4 billion purchase of Rite Aid early next year. It said Tuesday that it's selling the  Rite Aid stores in response to concerns raised by federal anti-trust regulators. The deal still needs to be approved by the Federal Trade Commission.
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., based in Deerfield, Illinois, announced in October 2015 that it planned to buy Rite Aid in a deal that would create about 12,000 U.S. locations. That's several thousand more than the nearest competitor, CVS Health Corp.
The combination is expected to give Walgreens beefed-up negotiating muscle with drugmakers and other suppliers and to help enlarge its presence in the Northeast and in Southern California. But the nation's largest drugstore chain also knew it would have to drop some stores to ease regulatory worry about competition.
Shortly after announcing the deal, Walgreens said it was willing to divest up to 1,000 stores to win regulatory approval, but it expected it wouldn't have to sell more than 500.
