I'm writing to tell you about a group of good girls and boys. They're a little older than most of the kids who send you a  wish list, and they're probably too big to sit on your lap anymore. Some of them even shave off their beards! But they have wishes, too! I'm thinking about this year's Wood River senior class of 2012.
It won't be long before these students march to the familiar strains of "Pomp and Circumstance," toss their mortarboards in the air and disperse to the corners of the earth. We do our best to make their graduation night safe, sober and memorable by holding a Senior Bash party for them. That's where you come in. After all, what's a party without prizes, entertainment and good food? Some of this costs a lot of money. And this, Santa, is our wish list.
If you agree that our local seniors from three high schools—Wood River, Silver Creek and Sage—deserve a safe haven for their party, then please help us make their wishes come true. Please contact our Senior Bash co-chairs,
