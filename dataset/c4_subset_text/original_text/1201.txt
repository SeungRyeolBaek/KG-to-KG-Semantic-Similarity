Integration of maternal mental health in antenatal and postnatal care necessity to fight postpartum depression.
On Wednesday evening, the bodies of  Swara Kaskar, 42, and her eight-month-old boy were found in their flat. While Kaskar left a handwritten suicide note stating she was depressed, doctors said apathy towards maternal mental health is the reason behind the incident.
Four out of 10 new mothers slip into depression in the first few months of childbirth, said psychiatrists. Pre and postpartum depression are common medical conditions, but detection and screening is relatively poor, said doctors. “Something was missed in this (Kaskar’s) case. Her symptoms would have been taken for granted,” said Dr Shubhangi Parkar, head of psychiatry department in KEM Hospital.
A scientific review of maternal mental health and child behaviour over the last five years, published recently in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, indicated the prevalence of both antenatal and postnatal psychological distress is high the world over, with a higher prevalence in developing countries including India.
