Take it from us: if you want to keep something under wraps, don&apos;t bring it on a plane and hold it up  where someone can snap a photo. Especially if you&apos;re Kanye West.
Joining the mile-high club is, what has been confirmed by anonymous sources who have held these shoes in their hands at adidas HQ, the Kanye West x adidas "Yeezi." An unveiling will take place in the near future, but this is the best, and only, look thus far.
What we can see is a tan upper, that looks like nubuck, mid with a zip up the side, with a loop, fabric lacing system. A ribbed single unit sole reaches from end to end. Like all Yeezys/Yeezis we&apos;ve seen, there&apos;s a strap across the laces.
These are certainly a step in a new direction for the rapper/collaborator. The shape and details are much more in the fashionable arena of his early work, and leaving behind the sports influence. Stay
