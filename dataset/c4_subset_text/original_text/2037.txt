Pakistan is one of those countries which have been greatly affected by climate change, although its contribution to the carbon emissions is negligible.
Environmental experts said  this on Wednesday as they spoke at a workshop for a project on renewable energy sources, titled ‘Introducing Renewable Energy Solutions to Enhance Energy Security and Build Climate Resilience in Karachi’.
The experts called for shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as fossil fuels were the biggest cause of carbon emissions, which resulted in climate change.
The project implemented in Rehri, Mauripur, and Gadap Town of Karachi was financially supported by the Nordic Climate Facility of the Nordic Development Fund (NDF). The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and K-Electric (KE) were the lead implementing partners in the project, which successfully piloted innovative alternatives and renewable energy solutions for over 2,000 households located in the peri-urban areas of Karachi.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Babar Khan, the Worldwide Fund for Nature-Pakistan regional head for Sindh and Balochistan, said cities from all over the world, being major economic and industrial hubs
