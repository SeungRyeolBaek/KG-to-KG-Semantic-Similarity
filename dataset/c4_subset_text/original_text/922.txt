Former Blackpool loanee Sean Longstaff has signed a new four-year deal with Newcastle United.
The midfielder spent last season on loan with  the Seasiders, scoring nine times in 45 appearances under the management of Gary Bowyer.
The 21-year-old, who is a product of Newcastle's academy, has put pen to paper on a new deal which will keep him at St James' Park until 2022.

He has also been named on the bench four times in the Premier League by manager Rafa Benítez this campaign.
Benitez added: “I’m really pleased
