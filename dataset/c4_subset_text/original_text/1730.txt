It’s not that the human immune system doesn’t recognize HIV. Indeed, an infection causes the body to unleash antibodies that attack  the virus, and initially some HIV is destroyed.
But HIV is able to quickly defend itself by co-opting a part of the innate human immune system — the immune system people are born with, called the complement. The complement includes a vital mechanism that prevents immune system cells from attacking the body’s own cells. HIV is able to incorporate a key protein in that self-protection mechanism, CD59, and by doing so makes itself appear to be one of the body’s normal cells, not an infective agent.
In laboratories at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Andy Qigui Yu, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of microbiology and immunology, is testing a promising compound that may counteract HIV’s ability to hijack the immune system’s protection mechanism.
“HIV is very clever. As it replicates inside cells, it takes on the CD59. The virus is covered with CD59, so
