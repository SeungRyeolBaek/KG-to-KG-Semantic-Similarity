A Joyful and Very Funny Poem - read it here!
It’ s been a busy time for me as your Community Poet.
I hosted an Open Mic Evening at Gayton Library earlier this week. It was such a hot evening that I didn’t expect too many poets to turn up, but we’re a resilient bunch and there were about twenty of us. Simon is a vivacious story teller and we were entranced with his tales. Also good to see Angela, Joy, Samuel, Heather, Vicki, John, Sharon, Marilyn and many others.
Kenton Library launched their Summer Reading Challenge with The Big Friendly Read and I was invited to run a workshop with some of the children. They wrote poetry and some beautiful pictures were drawn and coloured in. In particular I’d mention Krishay, Joshita, Tiana, Manish, Dhruvi, Tahani, Hasnaa, Abdun, Baasit and Neha.
Manish also entered this month’s Poetry
