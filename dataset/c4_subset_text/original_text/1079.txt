This weekend, Southeast hit back with an ad campaign and new website that says Atrium’s move will “seriously jeopardize patient  safety,” and that the system’s motive is to increase profits but not necessarily lower patient bills. Southeast, which is based in Charlotte and serves most of Atrium’s area hospitals, also alleges the system intends to adopt a radically different anesthesiology model with greater reliance on nurse anesthetists.
Charlotte-based Atrium and the doctor who was awarded the new anesthesiology contract with the hospital system strongly deny such claims.
Dr. Thomas Wherry says doctor staffing won’t decrease when his Charlotte-based company, Scope Anesthesia of North Carolina, takes over July 1.
Wherry said he is committed to an industry best practice of one anesthesiologist being responsible for no more than four patients at a time, and that Atrium has the same expectations: “It’s actually very clear that we’re not to exceed one-to-four,” he said.
