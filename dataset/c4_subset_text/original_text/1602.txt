An overview of Tuesday’s realtime forex price action for the major movers shows that the Loonie weakened the most, although  the Euro also fell slightly. In addition, the Aussie gained substantial ground, while the Yen was mildly higher.
A more technical EURUSD analysis shows that the rate made another fresh recent high on Tuesday at the 1.4247 level within an impressive rally that commenced at the important 1.2873 reversal point of January 10th. Although the rate ended slightly lower on the day, this rally in EURUSD is still expected to continue near term.
This most recent high continues to support a Euro forecast that targets the key 1.4281 reversal level of November 4th, 2010 in the coming sessions. Above that major resistance point, resistance then shows up at the 1.4579 level for EURUSD.
In addition, the rate’s key 200-day Moving Average is now at 1.3321 and rising. This indicates a bullish medium term outlook for the rate and its level should effectively limit downside price action until a significant trend reversal takes place in EURUSD.
