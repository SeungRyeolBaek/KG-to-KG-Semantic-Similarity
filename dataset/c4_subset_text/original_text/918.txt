As we announced a couple of days ago, we’ll be joining in with a live Treasure Hunt for Vodafone’s  ‘Live Guy’ next week and getting in on all the Live Guy action (and hopefully win a Dell Inspiron mini 9 netbook) while he makes his way across the country as stealthily as possible. So what’s his mission all about? As of Monday 17th December, Live Guy will be entering 11 cities with his little netbook, posting clues as to his whereabouts live online using Twitter, Facebook, Google Picasa, YouTube and his blog. Dedicated contenders can track him down in the city he’s in saying the code words “You’re Live Guy and I’m a Vodafone winner”. Online users can guess his location by placing a tag on a map (pin the tail on the donkey style) on the Live Guy website. He begins in Edinburgh and ends up in London on the 29th November.
