SAN JOSE — Pushed by its ambitious president, San Jose State is spending $28 million on high-tech communications systems worthy of a campus  of the future — but an investigation by this newspaper shows the project was crafted largely in secret, purchased without competitive bids and adorned with pricey gadgets that many professors may not even use.
At a time of tremendous financial pressure for the university and its students, campus leaders bought some of the flashiest classroom, conference room and office equipment available. The Next Generation Technology Project — built mostly by San Jose-based Cisco Systems, a major university donor — boasts thousands of videophones costing nearly $400 each, two-way conferencing to beam in experts on giant screens, and systems to record, transcribe and broadcast lectures.
San Jose State also paid Cisco to speed up its notoriously slow and unreliable Internet service, even though the California State University system — which is coordinating Internet upgrades for its other 22 campuses — is providing similar technology at no cost to the schools, with a company that offered CSU a proposal at one-fifth the price Cisco quoted.
