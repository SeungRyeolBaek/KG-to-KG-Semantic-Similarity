Chennai, July 20 (IANS) High on commercial value, the slick trailer of Pawan Kalyan-starrer Telugu  action-drama "Attarintiki Daaredhi" is a mix of action, comedy, romance and drama in appropriate proportions.
The trailer, which released Friday, promises that the film will entertain audiences when it hits the screens in August.
Directed by Trivikram, who is known for action films such as "Athadu" and "Julayi", "Attarintiki Daaredhi" appears to be an out-and-out entertainer with an apt tagline "celebration of entertainment".
The film will be the second collaboration between Pawan Kalyan and Trivikram after blockbuster Telugu romantic action-drama "Jalsa".
Trivikram hasn't compromised on anything, including special punch lines for Pawan Kalyan, which he mouths in his signature style with a hint of sarcasm.
Samantha Ruth Prabhu is paired opposite Pawan in the film.
