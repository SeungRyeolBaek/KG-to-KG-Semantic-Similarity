The final group of Irish peacekeepers to serve in Chad arrived back in Dublin this afternoon.
For the first time in three decades, there are  now no large Irish battalions serving overseas.
The 186 soldiers were met at Dublin airport by the Minister for Defence Tony Killeen and the acting Chief of Staff, Major General Dave Ashe.
The troops were also given an enthusiastic reception by their families.
Irish soldiers have been serving on four-month tours of duty in Chad for the past two years.

An earlier group of 200 peacekeepers returned from Chad over a week ago.
A small group of 11 will remain to serve at the force headquarters in Chad but they will not be on operational duties.

Minister Killeen said Irelandâ€™s commitment to peacekeeping remains very strong and he expects invitations to serve
