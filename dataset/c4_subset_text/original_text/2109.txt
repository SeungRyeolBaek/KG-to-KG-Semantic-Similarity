Most scientists can point to an instance when serendipity played a role in their  work. Some of the most exciting scientific discoveries have happened by accident. Penicillin resulted from a spoiled bacteria culture. The radioactivity of uranium without outside light was discovered when a cloudy day derailed an experiment with sunlight.
Indeed, two scientists at Duke University School of Medicine feel their careers have been transformed by serendipity. One, a pharmacologist and cancer biologist, has found his way into an unexpected avenue of work that may lead to a new treatment for HIV. Another, a neuroscientist, is recognized as an innovator in underÂ­standing brain injury and repair, but he never planned to go into science in the first place.
Drug discovery can involve conducting a massive screen in which millions of potential drugs are tested for their ability to bind to one target of interest -- a receptor or other structure in the body that is known to be associated with a particular disease. To Tim Haystead, PhD, associate professor of pharmacology and cancer biology, that method seemed like spinning a
