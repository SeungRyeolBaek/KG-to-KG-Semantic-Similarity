Gaza authorities shutter Al Arabiya and Maan offices in what critics call an illegal move.
Protesting what they called Hamas' "ongoing  assault on journalists", Palestinian journalists held a sit-in near Ramallah last week to protest against the Hamas government's recent closure of two media offices in Gaza.
A week earlier, Hamas authorities in Gaza shut down two media offices used by Al Arabiya satellite channel and Maan News Agency, which they accused of "disseminating false news and publishing fabricated reports" about Hamas and its relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
On July 25, police officers arrived at the two media offices in Al-Rimal neighbourhood, west of Gaza City, and ordered their workers to leave immediately, saying they had an order issued by the attorney general to "temporarily" close the offices and seize their contents.
"Police detectives came to our office showing us an order issued by the attorney general to temporarily close our office, but they refused to give us a copy of the order," said Al Arabiya's Gaza office director, Islam Abd al-Kareem.
