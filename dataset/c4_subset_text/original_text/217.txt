Put it down to weird-word mind glut. I admit to confusion. And if you are like me, Toyota and Nissan have a problem with  their blockbuster entries in the luxury-car sweepstakes.
I have immersed myself in the two cars and still have to think twice before I know that Nissan makes Lexus and Toyota makes Infiniti, or vice versa.
Vice versa wins (I stopped to think), but the befuddlement over names may be the only serious difficulty that Toyota has with its new Lexus.
Several weeks ago I was in love with Infiniti and now my fickle heart has been won by the only serious competition. When you get behind the wheel of a Lexus you can pretty much forget everything else in the luxury class.
You can certainly pay more, and you can maybe get a ''better'' car in the BMW 7-series. You can have more oohs and ahhs and fingerprints on the paint with a Rolls or a Bentley Turbo. But nobody else is offering a steal quite like the Toyota Lexus LS 400, which has a base sticker of $35,000
