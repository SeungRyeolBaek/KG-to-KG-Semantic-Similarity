Controversial anti-Islam film-maker jailed for a series of criminal offences relating to false aliases.
Mark Basseley Youssef,  the conman behind an anti-Muslim film that led to violence in many parts of the Middle East, has been given a one-year prison sentence for probation violations unrelated to the film.
The sentence was handed down on Wednesday after a plea bargain was reached between solicitors for Youssef and federal prosecutors.
Youssef admitted to using several false names and violating his probation order by obtaining a fraudulent California driver's license under a false name to commit bank fraud.
