LITTLE ROCK â€” The amounts of lottery-funded scholarships would increase as students advance through college under a bill that cleared a House committee Wednesday. 
The House Rules Committee endorsed House Bill 1295 by Rep. Jeremy Gillam, R-Judsonia, and Sen. Johnny Key, R-Mountain Home.
Under the bill, the Academic Challenge Scholarship for students attending four-year schools would be awarded in the following amounts: $2,000 for freshmen, $3,000 for sophomores, $4,000 for juniors and $5,000 for seniors.
Students attending two-year schools would receive $2,000 per year.
Currently, students receive $4,500 each year to attend a four-year school and $2,250 each year to attend a two-year school. Under HB 1295, students already in the program would continue to receive those amounts but students entering the program in the 2013-14 school year would receive the tiered amounts.
The measure also would increase the amount of funding available for scholarships for nontraditional students from $12 million to $16 million
