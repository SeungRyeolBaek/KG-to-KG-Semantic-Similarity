WASHINGTON, Nov. 30, 2000 -- Lifetime Hoan Corp. is voluntarily recalling about 132,000 fondue sets to replace their burners.  Some sets have alcohol burners that can produce high flames beyond the intended cooking surface of the fondue pot. Another set, which uses chafing fuel, is being recalled because the chafing fuel holder could tip as it burns down. Both problems present potential fire and burn hazards to consumers.
CPSC and Lifetime Hoan Corp. have received eight reports of burners producing high flames. No injuries or property damage has been reported.
The fondue sets were sold under the brand names Farberware® (model nos. 86600 (two styles), 86700, 86702 and 76743) and Roshco® (model no. 58903). The model number is on the box, not on the fondue set. The brand name is found on the box. The fondue sets are stainless steel and include various components, including a fondue pot, burner, and fondue forks. Only the burners sold with these fondue sets are
