American Varvara Lepchenko won in her Fed Cup singles debut to lift the U.S. team to a 1-1 tie against Italy  on Saturday, after Sara Errani beat Jamie Hampton 6-2, 6-1.
Lepchenko rallied past Roberta Vinci 2-6, 6-4, 7-5 after the Italian struggled with a leg cramp in the final set, which featured seven breaks of serve. She had treatment on her left thigh and rallied from 5-1 down in the third to tie it 5-5.
Then Lepchenko broke back and served out the match.
"I really lost my focus and got a bit distracted, which happens a lot to a lot of players," Lepchenko said. "I just kept on fighting, said to myself it's not the end of the match, you can still win it."
The doubles on Sunday will feature Melanie Oudin and Liezel Huber against Nastassja Burnett and Karin Knapp. Lepchenko will play Errani in reverse singles.
