Haitian earthquake survivors take a break and play soccer at a park that is now a refugee camp in Haiti's capital.
Port-au -Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Haiti's capital seemed to spring back to life Wednesday, more than a week after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake flattened many parts of the city and killed tens of thousands.
Electrical power was still out most places, but traffic lights were functioning and chaotic traffic clogged many streets. Aid trucks, some guarded by blue-helmeted United Nations peacekeepers, were seen leaving the airport. Water trucks also were spotted in parts of Port-au-Prince.
"There's energy in the air," said Haitian-born J.B. Diederich, who lives in Miami but returned to Haiti for a few days after the earthquake.
More U.N. convoys were seen moving through the city than in previous days, and so could vehicles for large nongovernmental organizations.
Haitian police seemed to take a more active role, directing traffic and getting out of their vehicles to deal with some problem or other
