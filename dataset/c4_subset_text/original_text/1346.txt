Around 20 years ago this wonderful matriarch in church brought a pie for one of the socials. She took care of a number of these  elderberry bushes at home. It was a special pie in that I had never heard of elderberries. Personally, I still think that they taste a little like blueberries. This fruit was amazing. Donâ€™t ever turn down an elderberry pie if you have an option to have a piece. I have found that these elderberries are not widely known, but everyone that I know that has tasted these berries has loved them. From what I can see over the years this elderberry is loved by a variety of different wildlife, which will provide some competition.
From my own experience I can seriously say to my reader who asked me for help with this wonderful plant a person who wants to grow them in Summit County will have success with a modest amount of effort. The only trial is that there are 25 different species around the world and at least six different cultivars of Elderberries and each of these have different requirements to some extent.
There are a number of different nurseries in the area
