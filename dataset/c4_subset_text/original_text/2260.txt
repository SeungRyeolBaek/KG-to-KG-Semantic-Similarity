The Cookoo is novel among smartwatches in that the watch bit is entirely separate from the smart part - all they have in common is the  casing, which is claimed to be water-resistant to 50m. You set the mechanical analogue face manually, and the Japan-made movement is powered by its own battery. This cell is good for three years of time-keeping, claims ConnecteDevice.
