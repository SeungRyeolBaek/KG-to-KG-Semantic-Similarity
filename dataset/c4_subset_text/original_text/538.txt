Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige has big plans for the Marvel Cinematic Universe following 2019's Avengers 4 - over a dozen, in fact.
 "[Marvel is] 22 movies in, and we’ve got another 20 movies on the docket that are completely different from anything that’s come before- intentionally,” Feige told Vanity Fair.
Avengers 4 will be Marvel Studios' twenty-second film, and the end to the MCU's Phase 3. The previously-announced Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and Spider-Man: Homecoming sequel would account for two of those 20 post-Phase 3 projects. Additionally, sequels for Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and the upcoming Captain Marvel can be safely assumed.
That still leaves 15 projects unknown - barring any surprise fourth film for Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, or Guardians of the Galaxy, or a fifth Avengers film.
But as Feige said, these films will be "completely different" from the previous MCU films - a statement that Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger illuminates - and possibly opens some doors to.
