COUNCIL has voted unanimously to launch a campaign to demand tunnels be reinstated on the Coffs Harbour bypass.
A motion raised by councillor  Keith Rhoades and carried unanimously will see a working group called Coffs Harbour Bypass Impact Working Group formed to progress the campaign as a matter of urgency.
Mayor Denise Knight and councillors Keith Rhoades and Paul Amos will sit on the working group.
Necessary funds from council's communications and advertising budgets will be used to run the campaign.
"I didn't think we would have to revisit this. We now have major open cuttings. That's a complete turnaround from when this community was basically told they would get tunnels," Cr Rhoades said.
He highlighted noise as one of the main problems with cuttings.
