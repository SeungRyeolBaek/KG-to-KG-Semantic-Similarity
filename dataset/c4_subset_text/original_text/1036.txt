Shia cleric said the Lucknow district administration has assured him in writing that rules will be framed for entry of tourists in the two Imambar as, which he claimed, were religious places and not a place for recreation.
If the Uttar Pradesh government and Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad have their way, tourists and visitors to the historical Bada and Chhota Imambaras will have to follow a dress code — which includes mandatory covering of the head and “no short dresses”.
Addressing the Shia community during Friday prayers, Jawwad said the Lucknow district administration has assured him in writing that rules will be framed for entry of tourists in the two Imambaras, which he claimed, were religious places and not a place for recreation.
While District Magistrate Raj Shekhar did not respond to calls, Additional City Magistrate-II Shailendra Mishra, who handed over the said letter to Jawwad, confirmed the decision.
“We have agreed to issue instructions for maintaining the religious sanctity of the Imambaras by framing rules barring short dresses
