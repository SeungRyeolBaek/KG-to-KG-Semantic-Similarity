Following in her mother’s footsteps, 23-year-old Shakisa Olinda Harvey is among the newest admissions to the bar after graduating  last Saturday from the Hugh Wooding Law School as an Attorney-at-Law.
The bubbly Harvey is the daughter of recently-appointed High Court Judge Justice Simone Morris-Ramlall.
Always certain of the career path she wanted to pursue, Harvey, who was called to the bar on Monday, said she has proven that determination, hard work and dedication truly pays off.
Presenting her petition before Madame Chief Justice (ag) Roxane George, attorney Abiola Wong-Inniss, to whose chambers Harvey is attached as an associate, described her as industrious.
Recalling Harvey’s in-service stints spent at her chambers during her vacations home from law school, Wong-Inniss said her performance was always exemplary.
The lawyer said that she was honoured not only to have been presenting Harvey’s petition, but more importantly to have her within the employ of her chambers, where her knowledge and expertise will make her an asset.
