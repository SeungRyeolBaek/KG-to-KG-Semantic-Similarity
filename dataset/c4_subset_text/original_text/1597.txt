The Malaysian prime minister says Burma could face expulsion from the Asean group of nations if its government continues to ignore calls to free the jailed opposition  leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
"We have already informed them that we are very disappointed with the turn of events and we hope that Aung San Suu Kyi will be released as soon as possible," Dr Mahathir said.
He said that ultimately Burma could be expelled from Asean though he stressed this would be done as a last resort.
It was Dr Mahathir who spearheaded moves to bring Burma into Asean - the Association of South East Asian Nations - in 1997.
The Malaysian leader hoped that trade and political engagement would bring change there, says the BBC's Jonathan Kent in Kuala Lumpur.
Suu Kyi and other leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) have been detained by the Burmese military government since the end of May.
Dr Mahathir said that Asean nations had been forced to criticise Burma because its leadership had caused problems and embarrassed its neighbours.
