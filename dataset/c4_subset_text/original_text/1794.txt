I picked UR because of the academic freedom. I knew I liked math and science but I wasn't a hundred percent certain that I would like engineering . With the UR curriculum, I knew that I could easily change to another major or take a random unrelated class and not affect when I graduated.
I picked my major randomly. As a freshman, I was assigned a BME advisor and I took BME 101, which I really enjoyed. After taking an optics course in the fall semester of sophomore year, I decided to declare my major as biomedical engineering with a concentration in medical optics.
I was involved in a variety of different groups including the Society of Women Engineers, varsity track and field team, Class Council, Tiernan Project, St. Sebastian Society and Catholic Newman Community. Being involved helped me to know my classmates better, become involved with the community, and gain leadership, time management, and networking skills.
In the fall after graduating from UR, I started graduate school. I decided I wanted to earn a PhD after doing research while at UR. I received help on the graduate school application process from my BME advisor and advisors
