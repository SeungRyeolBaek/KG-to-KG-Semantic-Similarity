Beginning at noon, a full four-lane reversal on I-26 in Charleston will begin at the interchange of I-26 and I-526 . The full reversal continues west until the I-26 crossover to I-77 just outside Columbia in Lexington County.
This is the third year in a row S.C. highways will be reversed because of storm evacuations.
To help the massive migration, the S.C. Department of Public Safety and the S.C. Department of Transportation will “reverse the direction of traffic along certain evacuation routes to ease the flow of traffic away from the coast,” the governor’s office said in a statement.
For drivers heading from Charleston to Columbia, I-26 will have a full four-lane reversal. The SCDOT reported it will begin at the interchange of I-526 and I-26, with other entry points for those leaving Charleston.
“Once motorists get to Columbia area, we’re going to return the reverse traffic back to the normal configuration just before Interstate 77,” said Rob Perry, SCDOT director of traffic engineering
