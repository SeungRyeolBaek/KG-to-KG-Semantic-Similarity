In case you haven't heard, The Last of Us is really, really good. If you still haven't played the game that went all M eryl Streep on the DICE Awards (after picking up Kotaku game of the year honors, no less), you can pick it up on Amazon today for just $30. I might have to buy myself a PS3 now just to play it.
Update: If you prefer Newegg, they have it for $28.
If your Xbox Live subscription is running dry, top it up for another year. $40 is about as cheap as you're ever likely to see this.
Featuring 5.1 channel surround sound, 4K pass through, and fantastic reviews, the Yamaha RX-V375 receiver is an absolute steal today at $200.
In case you missed it over the weekend, we've got great deals on both the iPad Mini Retina and the Kindle Paperwhite. Best Buy is the proprietor of both discounts, knocking $50 off all iPad Mini with Retina Display models, and 20 bucks off the Paperwhite.
