Mexico's government says it plans to use dolphins trained by the US Navy to try to save the world's most endangered marine species, the vaqu ita porpoise.
Environment Minister Rafael Pacchiano said that the dolphins would be deployed to locate and herd vaquitas into a marine refuge.
Mexico also permanently banned fishing nets blamed for the vaquitas' decline.
Scientists estimate that fewer than 40 of the mammals are still alive in their habitat, in the Gulf of California.
Mr Pacchiano said the dolphin project would begin in September.
"We've spent the past year working alongside the US Navy with a group of dolphins they had trained to search for missing scuba divers," he told Formula radio.
"We've been training them to locate the vaquitas.
"We have to guarantee we capture the largest possible number of vaquitas to have an opportunity to save them."
The Mexican government also said on Friday it was imposing a permanent ban on gillnets, used to catch totaba, which are highly valued in Chinese traditional medicine.
