Zardari: "Accusations... only complicate the already complex situation"
(CNN) -- Pakistan's president Tuesday pointed to a weekend  raid in Kashmir as proof of his government's commitment against terrorism, urging India to "pause and take a breath" before blaming Pakistan for the November massacre in Mumbai.
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari addressed India in an opinion piece in The New York Times.
In a sometimes deeply personal opinion piece in The New York Times, President Asif Ali Zardari wrote that his government, which took office earlier this year, was also the target of Islamic extremists -- "and we continue to be their victims."
But Sunday's raid on a camp used by the group India blames for the Mumbai attacks shows Pakistan is willing to crack down on "non-state actors" operating on its territory, he wrote.
"We understand the domestic political considerations in India in the aftermath of Mumbai," he wrote. "Nevertheless, accusations of complicity on Pakistan's part only complicate the already complex situation."
