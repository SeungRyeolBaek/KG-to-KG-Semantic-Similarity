Nicole Kidman can turn any event into her own red carpet!
The Lion star was the guest of honor at Flaunt and Vion net's event at celebrity hot spot Catch LA in West Hollywood, California, on Saturday, as Kidman is featured in the magazine's "The Nocturne Issue."
The Australian actress looked like a Greek goddess in a beige Vionnet gown that featured tan piping, cut-outs in the bodice, and a crepe skirt, which she paired with glamorous ruby-and-gold drop earrings, silver jewels, and a black clutch. She completed her look with a side pony, pale smoky eye, and red lips.
Plenty of celebs came out to support Kidman, including Pamela Anderson, Jhene Aiko, and Lydia Hearst.
Anderson, 49, got almost as much attention as the honoree, thanks to her eye-popping pink dress.
The Baywatch alum showed off major cleavage in the pastel, floral embroidered mini. She nearly spilled out of the frock, which she paired with a beaded clutch
