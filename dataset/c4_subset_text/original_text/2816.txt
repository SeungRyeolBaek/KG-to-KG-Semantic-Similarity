NEW DELHI --  The latest dispute between archrivals India and Pakistan centers on whether the Indian Army took out several suspected terror camps just across the volatile border in Kashmir.
While India claims its special forces carried out pre-emptive “surgical strikes” last week, Islamabad is adamant they did not cross the line of control into Pakistan.
The truth may be hard to ascertain in the remote Himalayan region where the two armies have long faced off and where bouts of heavy cross-border firing are not unusual.
What is certain is that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has signaled a more assertive approach in dealing with Pakistan. The move follows an attack on an Indian Army post in Kashmir that killed 20 soldiers on September 18, an attack that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based militants.
Officials say in the coming days and weeks India will explore more diplomatic and economic measures to put pressure on its neighbor and rival whom it has long accused of supporting cross-border attacks by Islamic militant groups.
