The town will now consider changing its animal ordinance.
A Berlin woman is trying to keep her pet goat despite a town ordinance.
A dwarf  goat named Benny has been living in a backyard pen at 452 New Britain Road in Berlin for five years, but in December, his owner was notified that her quarter acre of land is too small for a goat.
Zoning regulations require three acres, but Sheri Sala is fighting to keep Benny and got some unexpected help on Tuesday when a town board agreed to look into the zoning issues at the heart of the ordeal.
"No one has three acres in this town unless you have a farm. That goes back to 1965," said Sala.
Sala stepped in to take care of Benny when he was young.
"His mom wouldn't feed him so I took him in to bottle feed him for six weeks and he's been with me ever since," Sala said.
And, she has been fighting the zoning that would prohibit her from keeping the goat and she has received lots of support.
