Disability provider IHC says the Ministry of Education needs to act and shut down seclusion rooms, not simply say it is "working" with  schools.
Education Minister Hekia Parata announced yesterday that seclusion rooms would be banned in schools under new laws proposed by the government.
Today, the ministry would not confirm or deny whether two schools were still using the rooms.
The move to make the rooms illegal follows revelations some schools have been placing disruptive children in locked, small, cell-like rooms.
Ms Parata told Parliament last month a Ministry of Education review found eight special schools had seclusion rooms.
A response to written questions by the Green Party has now revealed only six of the schools have agreed to stop using them.
RNZ understands the two schools in question were residential schools that operated 24/7.
IHC's Trish Grant said the response was a cop-out.
"I'm concerned that the ministry is using phrases like 'working with the schools'. I think the minister herself said this was intolerable and needs to stop now."
It was nonsense to blame the delay in shutting down
