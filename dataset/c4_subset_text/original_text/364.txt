Parents with children in tow stagger onto a waiting train at Donaghmede Dart station. At Heuston, a group of mildly ineb riated tourists are trying to navigate the Luas map, while across Dublin transport staff keep watch over the thousands who have descended on the city for St Patrick’s Day.
Dublin on St Patrick’s Day is a riot of green flags, shamrocks and alcohol, making it one of the busiest days of the year for staff and passengers on a transport system that has increasingly been grappling with concerns over anti-social behaviour and violent incidents.
“Saturday nights and Paddy’s Day. They’re the two days you want to avoid,” says Dublin Bus driver Mark Maloney.
At 9.30am in Howth, it’s easy to forget there’s a festival at all. Yet as the train edges closer to the city, it becomes harder to ignore the shamrock hats, the fake ginger beards and the guitarist at Donaghmede delighting passengers with a rendition of Dirty Old Town.
