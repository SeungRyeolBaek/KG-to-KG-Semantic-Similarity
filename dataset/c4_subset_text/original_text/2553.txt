A "vegetarian" gene may have evolved amongst groups of people who have historically eaten less meat.
A team at Cornell University describes the  genetic variation in a study published inMolecular Biology and Evolution -- a variation that they say has "evolved in populations that have eaten a plant-based diet over hundreds of generations". That includes areas of India, Africa and East Asia, with a different variation adapted to a seafood diet found in Greenland.
The adaptation, the team says, allows those with the gene to "more efficiently process omega-3 and omega-6 acids and convert them into compounds essential for early brain development and controlling inflammation". The downside is that it might be linked to some types of cancer and other health problems.
The team looked at frequencies of particular alleles in 234 vegetarian people from India and 311 from the US, finding it in 68 percent of Indians and 18 percent of Americans. This is likely, they say, because Northern Europeans are more likely to eat meat and have "a long history of drinking milk".
Adaptations between vegetarian and seafood diets is most striking -- the vegetarian allele has an insertion of
