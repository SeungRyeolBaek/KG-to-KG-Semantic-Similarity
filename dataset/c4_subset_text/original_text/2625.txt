A Northamptonshire County Council social worker has been suspended for a year after failing to keep accurate records for 64 children in care.
 A panel of the Health and Care Professions Council’s (HCPC) Conduct and Competence Committee heard that Lee Higginbottom was responsible for a number of failings while working as an Independent Review and Conference Officer.

Mr Higginbottom also failed to keep his managers proactively informed about the significant backlog of his work, with reports of a “disconnect” between what they were told and “reality”.
