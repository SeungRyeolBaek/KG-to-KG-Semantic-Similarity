WASHINGTON — Federal regulators on Friday adopted a new system of special fees paid by U.S. financial institutions that will shift more of the burden to  bigger banks to help replenish the deposit insurance fund.
The move by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. cut by about two-thirds the amount of special fees to be levied on banks and thrifts. It followed protests by small and community banks — with powerful allies in Congress — against a plan adopted in February that charged premiums based on the amount of deposits. The smaller institutions insisted they would be unfairly hit even though they didn’t contribute to the financial crisis with reckless lending.
The FDIC board voted 4-1 to approve the new fee system. It is intended to raise $5.6 billion in the face of a cascade of bank failures that have depleted the insurance fund. The lone dissent came from U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan, whose agency regulates national banks.
The FDIC received more than 14,000 comment letters on the earlier fee plan. Typical of the anger was the letter from Dean Anderson, vice president of Lake Elmo Bank.
