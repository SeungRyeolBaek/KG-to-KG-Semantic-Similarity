Phillip Adams is a prolific and sometimes controversial broadcaster, writer and film-maker. As presenter of Late Night Live, he has interviewed thousands of  the world's most influential politicians, historians, archaeologists, novelists, theologians, economists, philosophers and sundry conversationalists. "It's a privilege to present Late Night Live", he says. "No radio program, anywhere on earth, casts a wider net."

Largely self-educated (he left school in his mid-teens) he's the author of over 20 books, including The Unspeakable Adams, Adams Versus God, Talkback, Retreat From Tolerance and A Billion Voices. His writing has appeared in many of Australia's most influential publications and he has been a contributor to The Times and The Financial Times in London, and to the New York Times.
His films include The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, The Getting of Wisdom, Don
