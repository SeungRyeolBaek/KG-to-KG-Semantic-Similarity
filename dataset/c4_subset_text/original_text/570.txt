The local comedy world is in mourning following the shock death of beloved satirist John Clarke.
Clarke, a regular fixture in TV and film  – most prominently his groundbreaking political interviews with Bryan Dawe – died while on a hiking trip in Victoria, aged 68.
His death has sparked countless tributes from local comedy personalities who worked with the prolific star and have spoken about his enduring legacy.
Most notable among those has been fellow giant of Australian comedy Barry Humphries, who is outraged at Clarke's sudden passing.
"How dare he die! John wasn't just funny, he was original and he was very, very nice," Humphries said.
"When Bruce Beresford and I were making the first Barry Mackenzie movie in the early '70s we had a scene in a London pub favoured by Australians. We'd cast a mob of noisy Aussies drinking and when we ran the somewhat random footage Bruce said, 'Watch this bloke'. We ran it again and froze frame on a young man at the bar drinking. He might have had one line, or maybe just a word, but he was terribly funny
