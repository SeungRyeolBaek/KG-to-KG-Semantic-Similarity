HP is attempting to up the game in VR with the launch earlier this past week of its newest Windows Mixed Reality headset called the Reverb.
 While we have not got our hands on it, a press release directs us to the specifics—the headset would come in two options (consumer and enterprise) and will sport cracking 2160 x 2160 resolution optics.
Such resolution numbers make it one of the highest-fidelity headsets currently on offer for VR fans globally.
The Reverb, which was launched at HP Reinvent, the company’s largest global partner event, will also sport a lightweight design, and offer an expanded 114-degree field of view.
The Reverb will come with pre-paired motion controllers right out of the box and support for Windows Mixed Reality and Steam VR.
As for availability and pricing, HP says both models will go on sale in the UAE soon.
The HP Reverb Virtual Reality Headset – Pro Edition for enterprise customers is expected to be available in April for Dhs 2,380.
