The Nevada City Council held a ceremony to swear in the Rudiger in 2015.
The 2018 Paw and Order Dinner will have a dual focus this  year.
Taking place on at 5:30 p.m., Sept. 21 at the Miner’s Foundry Cultural Center in Nevada City is the dinner, program and auction, according to a release.
In addition to raising the annual budget which supports the on-going training expenses of K9 Officer Rüdiger and K9 Officer Kano, the Rüdiger Foundation hopes to also raise the initial funding to provide additional K9 officers and equipment for local law enforcement agencies.
Start up expenses for new law enforcement K9 programs can be cost prohibitive for small, rural departments.
Rüdiger Foundation estimates the need for a total of five full-time K9 officers to provide around-the-clock K9 services to Nevada City, Grass Valley, and the unincorporated areas of Nevada County.
Tickets are $100 and are available online by visiting Rüdiger Foundation on Facebook and linking to the 2018 Paw and Order event page.
