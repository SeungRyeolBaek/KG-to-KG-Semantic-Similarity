Performance Reviews Are Pointless And Insulting -- So Why Do They Still Exist?
I'm the HR Director for a growing manufacturing firm . I started the job in July. I report to the CEO.
I'm putting my 2018 plan together. One thing I told my boss "Jake" when he interviewed me is that I plan to talk him out of the company's annual performance-review process.
I agree with you that making every employee fill out an evaluation form and sit down to talk about it every year is a huge waste of time and energy, and most employees hate performance reviews.
If the relationship is healthy between the manager and the employee, they're having regular conversations anyway â€” including quarterly and annual planning sessions. If that isn't happening, I can help managers fix that -- but having more conversations doesn't require an evaluation process.
I eliminated performance reviews at my last company and everyone was happy about it.
Of course, employees need to be able to get feedback when they need it. If they can get that feedback without being graded like elementary school students then it's a win-win for everybody.
