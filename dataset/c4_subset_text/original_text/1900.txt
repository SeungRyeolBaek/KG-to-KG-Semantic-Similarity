Some of the most amazing coffees I've ever tasted have been winners from the Cup of Excellence competition. The program has been referred to as the  Oscars of coffee and seeks to identify the best beans from many of the top coffee farms in the world. An international jury of professional coffee tasters is invited to the host country to cup the selected entries. Cup of Excellence competitions have been held in Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Rwanda, Costa Rica and Colombia.
On the first day of the competition there is an extensive calibration. During the next two days, the international jury cups the coffees that have been approved and passed by the national jury. On the fourth day, the jury cups about 45 coffees which have passed the first round. Coffees scoring an 84 or above during this round are awarded the prestigious Cup of Excellence.
The top ten scoring coffees are ranked again to discover the first place winner of the competition. Winning Cup of Excellence coffees are then sold through an internet auction. The most recent auction was held on January 18th, for the winning farms of the 2010 Brazilian competition. I
