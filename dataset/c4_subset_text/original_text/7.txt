WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Sunday warned Congress against manufacturing a crisis over federal spending in the months ahead,  as looming deadlines set the stage for a repeat of the political deadlock which two years ago triggered worldwide financial market turmoil.
In coming negotiations with Republicans, who control the House of Representatives, Democratic President Barack Obama will focus on ways to create economic gains for the middle class over spending cuts, Lew said.
“We have already done a lot of deficit reduction,” he said in an interview on NBC. Lew spoke on four TV talk shows, setting out Obama’s priorities ahead of an expected showdown this fall.
By early November, Congress must raise the legal limit on the country’s borrowing authority or risk an unprecedented default on the government’s debt.
A debt ceiling showdown in August 2011 between Obama and congressional Republicans sparked wild stock market swings and cost the United States its top-tier AAA credit rating.
“We need to get the debt limit extended in a way that doesn’t create a crisis,” Lew said.
