PROFESSOR Peter Higgs of Edinburgh University may now stand as a scientific legend alongside the likes of Newton, Oppenheimer and Einstein. 
But the Noble laureate-in-waiting is far from the only Scottish scientist behind one of the greatest achievements in physics in the last century: the discovery last week of the elusive Higgs boson – the God particle. Although Higgs proposed the theory of the particle nearly 50 years ago, behind the scenes, dozens of physicists from Scotland played a vital role in the experiments which led to the identification of the Higgs boson – a particle which holds the key to explaining how matter attains its mass, and how the universe works at its most fundamental level.
The discovery awaits full endorsement from the scientific community.
Around 50 academics, researchers, technicians and postgraduate students from both Glasgow and Edinburgh universities were part of the Atlas experiment team at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Cern, Switzerland, which announced the breakthrough on Wednesday.
Here we talk to some of those Scottish scientists about their work on the Atlas experiment and their thoughts on the significance of the likely discovery
