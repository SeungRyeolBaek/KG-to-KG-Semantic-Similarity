Across Terrebonne and Lafourche, just under 33,000 homes and businesses lacked power tonight, about half the number of outages  reported in the hours after Hurricane Isaac hit Tuesday night and early Wednesday.
About 22,100 Entergy customers in Lafourche Parish were without power by this evening, a figure that dropped by 7,000 since this morning. In Terrebonne, 10,300 Entergy customers lacked power, down by nearly 1,500 since morning, said Mike Burns, spokesman for the utility.
Only a few individual city of Houma customers with damage specific to their homes or businesses lacked power by tonight.
About 650 SLECA customers remained without power by 7:30 p.m., and General Manager Joe Ticheli said they were expected to be restored by midnight. About 200 of those sites were fishing camps in Terrebonne and Lafourche. The rest were mostly homes in the Oakshire neighborhood and north Bayou Black area of Terrebonne. Power had been restored to more than 1,000 SLECA customers in both parishes throughout the day.
