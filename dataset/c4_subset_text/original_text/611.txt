Ever since Zillow evolved into.. well, whatever it is now (some sort of real estate search, AVM, mortgage rate and discussion  forum Frankenstein Hydra, as far as I can tell), the controversy over Zestimates seems to have quieted down.
Maybe it’s that the novelty of seeing what your home is worth has worn off as housing prices crash.
Perhaps it’s that the PR pros at Zillow have done such a phenomenal job positioning the company in the media as a legitimate data source that the Zestimate has become an accepted statistic.
Or more likely, maybe it’s that the industry has been successfully wooed with the promises of easy, cheap marketing online tools (which are especially seductive in a down market) and any remaining resistance has slipped by the wayside.
In either case, Zestimates just don’t seem to be the point of contention they once were.
But today Zillow launched an iPhone app. One that, I suspect, promises to bring the debate over Zestimates (and their accuracy) back to the forefront.
