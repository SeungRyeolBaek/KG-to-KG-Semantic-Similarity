The formation of the new federation would result in a major Cosatu split as affiliates would have to choose between the two.
Zwelinz ima Vavi, the former Cosatu secretary general who was fired by Africa’s largest labour federation in 2014 for allegedly failing to carry out his duties, will lead the new federation to be unveiled on May 1.
One of Cosatu’s major affiliates – the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) – would be one of the biggest members of the federation. Numsa’s Cosatu membership was nullified in 2014 following disagreements with the federation.
Vavi said the South African trade union movement had become fragmented and weakened, with only 24 percent of workers being members of any union.
“That is why there is such a groundswell of support for a workers summit and not just a new union federation but a fundamentally different one, based on worker control, internal democracy, non-racialism, gender equality, international solidarity and political independence,” he said.
Vavi said the new federation would shy away from politics
