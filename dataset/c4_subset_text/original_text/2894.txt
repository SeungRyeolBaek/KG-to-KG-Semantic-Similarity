An alliance of four ethnic armed groups fighting Myanmar forces in northern Shan and Kachin states said on Tuesday it wants to participate in peace talks with the government next month, but demanded that China and another ethnic militia be present as witnesses, an officer from one of the groups said.
The Northern Alliance, which includes the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Arakan Army, Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), teamed up last November to carry out coordinated attacks on government and military targets in northern Shan state.
“We believe a cease-fire is not a final solution, and we have a desire to hold talks with the government to get a political solution,” Major Mai Ai Kyaw of the TNLA told RFA’s Myanmar Service.
