NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Air cargo carrier Emery Worldwide grounded its fleet of 37 freighters Monday as the Federal Aviation Administration prepared to pull  its operating certificate because of maintenance problems.
An official of the FAA said the agency pushed for the grounding because its investigation discovered more than 100 violations of safety regulations.
Air cargo carrier Emery Worldwide agreed Monday to ground its fleet of freighters instead of having the FAA pull its operating certificate due to more than 100 alleged safety regulation violations.
"This gives us a lack of confidence in the carrier's ability or willingness to fly safe aircraft," said Ava Mims, the deputy director of the FAA's flight standards office.
Mims said the current agreement with Emery will keep its planes on the ground for at least 30 days, but that it likely will take much longer to resume operations.
A spokeswoman for Emery, a unit of CNF Inc., said the move by the FAA came "out of the blue." Shares of CNF (CNF: down $1.19 to $30.31, Research, Estimates) were off about 4 percent in trading Monday.
