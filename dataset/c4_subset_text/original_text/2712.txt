Typical customer would pay $132 more by 2018.
Electric bills of Xcel Energy customers in Minnesota are going up — again.
The  state’s largest power company on Monday requested a 9.8 percent electric rate hike phased in over three years. By 2018, a typical electric customer’s annual electric charges would be $132 higher if state regulators approve the increase.
Xcel’s 1.2 million Minnesota electric customers face an almost-certain interim rate hike of 5.5 percent in January, or about $60 per year, plus a smaller bump in 2017, bringing the total to 7 percent. Interim rate hikes are almost always approved but are subject to refund if the final authorized increase is less.
The next increase will follow five consecutive years of rate hikes by the Minneapolis-based utility, and consumer advocates said it is too much for people with stagnant incomes.
Xcel is proposing to increase the residential basic charge, which all customers pay regardless of power usage, from $8 to $10 per month. Xcel said that increase would bring the basic charge in line with the cost of service
