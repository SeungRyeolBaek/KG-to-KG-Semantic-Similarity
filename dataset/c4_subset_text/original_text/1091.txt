DETROIT -- Mark DeRosa and J.P. Arencibia brought some life to the Toronto Blue Jays' dugout. 
DeRosa delivered a two-run, pinch-hit double in the sixth inning and Arencibia hit a three-run, go-ahead double in the seventh as the Blue Jays erased a five-run deficit and defeated the Detroit Tigers 8-6 at chilly, damp Comerica Park on Wednesday.
Toronto, one of the favorites in the American League East after an offseason shopping spree, needed a jolt after a 2-5 start.
"It's been quiet, and rightfully so," DeRosa said of the mood inside the dugout. "We haven't played well. You try to keep it upbeat, try to keep it energetic, but when you've got a 2-5 record and you see another slipping away, you kind of want to push the throttle a little bit. We needed something to happen like this."
DeRosa drove in three runs and reliever Aaron Loup recorded his first major-league victory with an inning of scoreless relief
