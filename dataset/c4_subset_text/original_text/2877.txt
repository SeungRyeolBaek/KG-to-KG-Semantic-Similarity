But for many Americans it doesn’t feel that way. Congress is intransigent. Our presidential candidates are divisive. Race relations are tense . Social classes are disconnected.
While there’s no one solution to heal all that is broken, there’s a belief that one remedy might be more people doing community service.
America is a country that extols rugged individualism and people who make it on their own, but along the way, in that search for personal growth, many have forgotten service beyond ourselves. Over the years, a number of academic studies have shown that volunteering has real benefits for mental and even physical health, yet in 2014, 75 percent of Americans did not volunteer, according to the Corporation for National and Community Service.
Fewer college students aspire to careers in public service. The military has its smallest share of Americans serving since before World War II. Just shy of 20 percent of 18- to 29-year-old citizens voted in the 2014 midterm election.
This, some argue, is what has made us retreat to our respective corners with little regard for communities outside our own.
