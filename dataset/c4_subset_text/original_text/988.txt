Exercise is important for people of all fitness levels and abilities, and wheelchair-bound geriatric exercisers are no exception. Low-impact exercises  can improve range of motion and strength for the elderly in wheelchairs to help reduce pain and discomfort that can come from inactivity. Many exercises can be performed without extra equipment, although a resistance band and lightweight dumbbells can come in handy too. Always talk with your physician, however, before beginning an exercise program to ensure you are in good enough health.
Finger marching exercises can improve range of motion and grip strength in your upper body, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Keep your feet in a comfortable, secure position with your back straight and stomach muscles contracted. Pretend there is a wall in front of you and place your hands on the “wall.” Slowly walk your fingers up this wall, moving them individually until you lift as high as you can. Hold this arm position for 10 seconds while you wiggle your fingers, then slowly march your fingers back down the wall to return to your starting position.
