The awareness stage occurs two to four weeks after the death of a loved one and generally lasts three to four months. It takes time to fully absorb  the impact of a major loss and symptoms may include anger, fear and guilt.
Experiencing symptoms of depression also is a normal part of the grieving process and is a psychological expression of grief. Grief is likely to be expressed physically (weight loss/ difficulty sleeping/loss of appetite), emotionally (difficulty making decisions) and psychologically (depression/anxiety).
After the first year, reconciliation and acceptance will begin to occur. Healing takes time and the best thing you can do is be patient with and kind to yourself. Take care of yourself, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, keep a daily routine and seek out caring people who will allow you to express your grief and talk about your loved one. Not all people are able to tolerate the expression of painful feelings, so choose a listener wisely.
