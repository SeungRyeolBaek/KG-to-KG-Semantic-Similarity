SALT LAKE CITY â€” Recent reports show that Utah's charter schools are improving, but are they doing enough to keep up with charter schools in  other states?
Utah's overall score from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools went up ten points from last year, settling at 131. Despite the rise in score, Utah dropped from 12 to 20 in comparison to other states. Alliance officials say it isn't because of any mistakes Utah is making, but because other states are dramatically improving.
"I think that's an indication that charter schools are very popular in the country, right now, and other states are being even more aggressive than Utah is with implementing them and putting them into place," said Utah State Charter School Board Chair Tim Beagley.
Beagley said they're not too worried about the drop in the rankings. Some of it can be attributed to changes in how the rankings are made. He also said the study shows some areas where Utah can improve.
