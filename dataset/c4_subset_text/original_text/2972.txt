David King's suggestion that we should cut back on space research and basic physics in order to focus on more immediate issues is misguided. Of course,  the scientific community should work as hard as possible to address major issues that affect our everyday lives such as climate change, infectious diseases and counterterrorism; in particular, "clean energy" research deserves far higher priority. And science and technology are the prime routes to tackling these issues.
But it is mistaken to claim that global problems will be solved more quickly if only researchers would abandon their quest to understand the universe and knuckle down to work on an agenda of public or political concerns. These are not "either/or" options – indeed, there is a positive symbiosis between them.
Also, it is, crucially, the big scientific issues that attract the best people into science – even though they end up in varied careers. David King is right that environmental issues are noble challenges, that they deserve higher priority, and that we need urgently to address global warming through science. But a prerequisite for this is an enthusiastic and inspired generation of talented scientists. And it's well documented that many are attracted by
