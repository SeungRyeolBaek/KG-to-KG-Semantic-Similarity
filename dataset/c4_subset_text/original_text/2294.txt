User-generated content (UGC) – blogs, reviews, comments, essentially any digital interaction your customer has with your brand – is becoming an increasingly  important part of many businesses’ marketing plans. It is a low-investment, high-impact way of raising your profile online.
Mike Peates, founder and director of the homemade chocolate business Owow Chocolate has focused on turning his customers into brand advocates from the start.
When his business was starting up, Peates focused more on engaging than selling and was relentless on social media. He sent packs of chocolate to people he’d been talking to and encouraged them to share their thoughts on Twitter.
This worked particularly well, largely because the business makes branded chocolate gifts and his target market are other small firms who use them for promotion and client rewards. His customers help him promote his business, while his whole business focuses on promoting theirs.
You can create opportunities for engagement in many ways. Encourage your customers to get involved in social media competitions, ask them to show you what they love about your product or simply tap into their personal life and encourage them to share their interests
