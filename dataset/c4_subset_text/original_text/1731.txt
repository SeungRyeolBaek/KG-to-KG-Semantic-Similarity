Fine Gael TD Noel Rock and Labour Senator traded insults over their commitment or otherwise to provide housing.
Fine Gael TD Noel Rock and Labour Senator A odhán Ó Ríordáin have been involved in a bitter spat on Twitter over objections to housing developments.
Mr Rock accused Mr O’Ríordáin of being a “serial objector and massive hypocrite” and said the Labour Party used to have a policy of supporting housing for everyone.
Mr O’Ríordáin countered by accusing Mr Rock of “cheap shots” and said Fine Gael are “ripping up the rule book to benefit landlords and developers, but then stage photo ops with supposed ticket touts to look tough”.
The reference to ticket touts is the private members Bill brought forward by Mr Rock to stop tickets being sold for above face-value prices.
Mr Rock is the latest prominent Fine Gael politician to target Mr Ó’ Ríordáin over his objections to housing developments.
