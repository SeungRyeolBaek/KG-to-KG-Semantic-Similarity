Hair loss is no longer an inevitable march to baldness. Medical advances in recent decades mean male hair loss can be treated, and it need  not break the bank.
The cause of male pattern baldness is well established as an act of nature not nurture. Identical twins go bald at the same age, rate and pattern, irrespective of diet, lifestyle or stress levels.
There's no need to go bald any more.
Baldness is a complex polygenic trait: up to five genes are involved, and it is the interplay between these genes, not unlike the interaction between the cards in a poker hand, that determine the specifics of male pattern hair loss.
So, what are the treatment options?
Finasteride is a Therapeutic Goods Administration-approved drug that dermatologists and general practitioners have been prescribing to treat hair loss for about 15 years.
It works by stopping the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in the prostate, by blocking an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase.
You'll need a prescription for finasteride, and your doctor will explain the benefits and risks
