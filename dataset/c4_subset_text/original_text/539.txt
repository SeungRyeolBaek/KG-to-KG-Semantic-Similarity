A Babylon Town worker could lose his job after posting hateful insults on social media targeting a Muslim teenager in Lindenhurst the day before her graduation,  the town supervisor said Friday.
The Facebook account of Andy Vita, 51, posted commentary on Thursday in response to a Lindenhurst School District video celebrating its high-achieving high school seniors, including salutatorian Yasmin Zohny, who appeared in the video wearing a traditional Muslim hijab, or headscarf.
The video was shared on a Lindenhurst Facebook community page. The Facebook account of Vita, who is a member of that community, responded with expletives and derisive comments about Zohnyâ€™s hijab.
