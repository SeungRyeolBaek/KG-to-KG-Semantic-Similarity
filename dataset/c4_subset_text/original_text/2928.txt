For anyone who tried driving along Willow Creek Road in Prescott between Sunday and  Friday, June 10-15, likely idled in traffic for far longer than they ever wished to.
“This week has been pretty tough with a full pavement reconstruction from Willow Lake Road to Mitchell Road,” said Tim Sherwood, construction services administrator with the City of Prescott.
Fortunately, the worst of the road work in that stretch is over, Sherwood said.
“All of the paving operations on Willow Creek Road are finished,” he said Friday afternoon.
Next week, crews will be raising the utilities (manholes, water valves, etc.) back to grade, “but that’s much, much, much less impact on traffic,” Sherwood said.
Also, according to a news release from the City of Prescott, crews will be striping the roadway over the next two weeks. The impacts are expected to be from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Sunday through Thursday, June 17-28.
