LEEDS UNITED hope to secure the signing of Tyler Roberts from West Brom.
The Championship outfit are in advanced talks over a deal for the  19-year-old striker, according to the Yorkshire Evening Post.
An initial fee worth £2.5million - which could rise to £4m - is set to be agreed between the two clubs.
Roberts is expected to undergo a medical and put pen to paper before tomorrow’s 11pm deadline.
The Wales Under-21 international’s contract with West Brom expires at the end of the season and a host of European clubs were interested in negotiating a pre-contract deal.
Scottish giants Rangers have also been sniffing around.
Roberts spent the first half of the season on loan in League One with Walsall and scored five goals in 19 appearances.
Leeds have been hunting for a striker but were not expected to succeed in bolstering their attacking options.
However, West Brom’s capture of Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool has resulted in the Baggies allowing Roberts to leave.
Roberts might not be the only player to join Leeds on
