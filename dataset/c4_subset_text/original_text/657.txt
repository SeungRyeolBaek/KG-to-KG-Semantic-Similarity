MANCHESTER UNITED star Michael Carrick has revealed a heart scare has limited his game time this season.
The Old Trafford skipper has  not featured for the Red Devils since September and has released a statement to explain his absence.
"I just want to clear up my situation as I've had quite a few people asking if I'm ok and why I haven't been fit over the last couple of months," said Carrick.
"After feeling strange during the 2nd half of the Burton game in September I underwent a series of tests.
"It turned out to be due to an irregular heart rhythm which has been fully investigated and I had a procedure called a Cardiac Ablation.
"I had to build up training steadily whilst being monitored closely but I feel fine now.
"I would like to reassure everyone that I'm healthy and back training hard with the team.
"I'm building up my fitness and aiming to be back in contention for selection soon.
"Thanks for your support, Michael."
United's Carabao Cup win over Burton is the only first-team game Carrick has featured
