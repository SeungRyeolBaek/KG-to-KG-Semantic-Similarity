Miami - A new treatment, using microparticles made from chitosan, may help dairy cattle resist uterine diseases and could help improve  food safety for people. New research suggests chitosan microparticles kill bacteria.
Uterine illnesses in cows are a major concern. This is because they can make cows infertile, lower milk production and could potentially pose a risk to consumers.
To find a way to kill bacterial infections in the uteri of cows – especially Escherichia coli – a research team selected chitosan (an antimicrobial material derived from dissolved shrimp shells). To explore this, the team infused chitosan microparticles into diseased cow uteri. The results appeared to be successful with most of the infectious bacteria killed.
New compounds are needed to fight infections, especially because dangerous infections are diminishing the role of some antibiotics, making them less able to treat infections. This is also important in the context of a recent news item on the Digital Journal. Here it was reported that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked 26 companies to voluntarily
