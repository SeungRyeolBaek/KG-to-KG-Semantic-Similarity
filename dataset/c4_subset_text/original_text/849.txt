The Marine Corps’ footprint in Afghanistan is changing dramatically as a drawdown in forces continues throughout the summer.
The latest changes include a shift  in central Helmand province in which one infantry battalion — 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines, out of Camp Lejeune, N.C. — is distributed across Marjah, Nawa, and several other districts, with Afghan forces taking a leading role. Second Battalion, 9th Marines, and 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines, both out of Lejeune, left the battlefield recently and were not replaced.
The Corps also has realigned all remaining infantry units to fall under Regimental Combat Team 6, out of Camp Lejeune, N.C., as Afghan National Security Forces increasingly lead security operations in Helmand. The change took effect July 5 when RCT-5, out of Camp Pendleton, Calif., transferred its powers to RCT-6. RCT-5’s headquarters element was not replaced.
RCT-6, commanded by Col. John Shafer, now includes both the remaining units in northern Helmand and 3/8.
