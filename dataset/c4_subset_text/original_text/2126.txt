Updated. Motorola’s(s MMI) quest to ban Apple’s(s AAPL) push e-mail notifications from  its iCloud and MobileMe services was upheld in a Germany court Friday. This is a victory for Motorola: Not only did the judge agree that an earlier injunction granted should be upheld, Apple was also ordered to pay Motorola unspecified damages in the case, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.
Motorola sued Apple over the way iCloud and its predecessor MobileMe send “push” emails, claiming the method used is a violation of “multiple pager status synchronization system and method patents” — basically technology Motorola once used in pagers. Apple said following the initial ruling that Motorola’s “old pager patent is invalid.” But a judge disagreed and forced Apple to come up with a workaround in early February.
