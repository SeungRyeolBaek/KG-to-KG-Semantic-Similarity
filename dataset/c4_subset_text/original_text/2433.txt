WASHINGTON (KFVS) - The federal government plans to make a big investment at a transportation hub in the Heartland, and a local farmer  is excited about the investment.
The Southeast Regional Port Authority was awarded a $19.8 million grant through the Department of Transportation this week.
According to SEMO Port Executive Director Cary Harbison, the funding will go toward the construction of two 12,000 foot long loops of rail road track near the transportation hub.
This week the Southeast Missouri Regional Port Authority honored Congressman Smith for his work to enhance rural infrastructure in southeast Missouri.
Harbison says the new infrastructure make it easier to transfer tons of product from rail cars to river barges, and vice versa.
“There are loops available in St. Louis and down by Memphis, but in our general area this would be the only public loop track facility available, such that any customer can come to us,” Harbison said.
Farmer Kevin Fennewald manages a grain bin complex in Scott County.
He says the proposed railway loop at SEMO Port could lower his cost to transport rice
