TRENTON – Minors would no longer be legally able to buy over-the-counter cough syrups and related products under legislation designed  to thwart teens from getting high on the products.
Assemblyman Paul Moriarty, (D-4), Turnersville, told the Assembly Law and Public Safety Committee he wrote the legislation (A650) after a visit from a constituent who told him her daughter was getting high on the cough medicine.
“It’s a high apparently similar to PCP,” Moriarty, a committee member, told his fellow legislators.
Moriarty at one point held up some printouts of Twitter feeds he said he’d gotten today simply by plugging DXM into a search. And he said it’s a popular point of discussion among users making plans for using the stuff to get high in what some call “robo-tripping,” a name derived from the Robitussin cough medicine brand.
But other members said they were concerned that the estimated 120 products that use the ingredient would be too much for drug stores or cashiers
