The Vietnam war memorial is 492 feet long. If a similar memorial had been made for the Vietnamese who died, it would be nine miles long .
Len Aldis has long been engaged in the fight against Monsanto and Dow Chemicals for their role in Agent Orange use in Vietnam.
(LONDON) - Len Aldis, the internationally respected Agent Orange Activist and Chair of the Tower Hamlets CND has released the attached letter from the Mayor of Tower Hamlets regarding the London Olympics.
Len has been instrumental in organising worldwide condemnation of Dow Chemical involvement with the London games, in particular the wrapping the Olympic stadium in the Dow brand.
The Dow public relations machine is working 24/7 to portray Dow as the friendly face of the Olympics when in fact the name Dow is synonymous with Vietnamese being burned to death by Dow's NAPALM and the millions Vietnamese suffering from Agent Orange into the fourth generation.
Thank you DOW! The world will never forget your participation in the American War in Vietnam. Mass Murder if your legacy!
