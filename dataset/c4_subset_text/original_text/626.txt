SAN JOSE — Nestled in a back corner of Kelley Park off Phelan Avenue and Senter Road, Allan Greenberg squinted at  a radiator on a Ford Model TT belonging to the Santa Clara Fire Department while his colleague, Bob Meneely, munched on a Snicker’s bar. The radiator had been overheating, and despite weeks of tweaking, nothing worked.

The group, who work in a cavernous metal garage filled with electric saws and paint cans, restore antique vehicles for historical groups and law enforcement agencies, from an 1887 Studebaker Wagon and a 1905 Fire Chief’s Cadillac for the San Jose Fire Museum to a horse cart for the Saratoga Historic Museum. Some of the guys even own Model Ts.
