BAMENDA, Cameroon: Children kidnapped by gunmen in western Cameroon said their captors had warned them not to go back to school, recount ing their ordeal as parents on Thursday packed up belongings from a boarding school now being shuttered.Kidnappers freed about 80 school children and a driver in west Cameroon on Wednesday, but kept hold of a principal and one teacher, two days after snatching them in a school raid.
The armed men had seized the kids on Monday in Bamenda - a green city nestled in the hills of western Cameroon and hub of the country's troubled English-speaking region.
"It was around 3 a.m. in the morning. We were still sleeping, then we heard people shouting, some other people, some men, came and broke our door. They told us: 'come out'. They were all dressed in black," a 13-year-old boy told Reuters TV, recounting his ordeal. He declined to be identified.
"When they set us free, they said we should tell the other schools that they should stop, so no one goes to school," he said.
