Baby on board! Kate Middleton made her first public appearance since announcing her second pregnancy during a meet and greet with The President of the Republic of  Singapore and his wife, Mrs. Tony Tan Keng Yam, on Oct. 21.
Kate debuted her tiny baby bump in an gray Alexander McQueen coat with a matching Jane Taylor hat. We approve!
Kensington Palace confirmed yesterday that the Duchess of Cambridge is due in April.
“I’ve been looking forward to getting out of the house," Kate quipped with the President. “It’s a bit colder than when we last met,” she continued, speaking of their meeting in 2012.
Her husband, Prince William, who looked smart in a navy blue suit and burgundy tie, accompanied the Duchess.
The Princess is expected to attend the Wildlife Photographer of The Year 2014 Awards Ceremony at the Natural History Museum later today. We can’t wait to see what she’s going to wear next!
