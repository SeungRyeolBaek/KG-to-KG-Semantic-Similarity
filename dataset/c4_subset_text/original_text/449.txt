Kent State University Urban Design CollaborativeA rendering of the proposed Rivergate Park.
The Cleveland Rowing Foundation's project to create a riverfront  park in Cleveland scored its third big grant in two days today with a $200,000 donation from the George Gund Foundation. The grant follows $550,000 in donations announced Tuesday by Peter Lewis and the Cleveland Foundation.
Gund Foundation trustees voted around 2 p.m. to make the gift, said senior program officer John Mitterholzer. The money will be channeled to the project through the non-profit Trust for Public Land, Mitterholzer said.
The goal of Rivergate is to turn 7 acres owned by the former Commodore's Club Marina on Columbus Road Peninsula into a cluster of boathouses for rowing shells, caneos, kayaks and dragon boats. The rowing foundation, an umbrella organization for high school, collegiate and adult rowing organizations with 850 members, currently occupies rented facilities on Scranton Road Peninsula, one river-bend south of the Commodore's Club site.
