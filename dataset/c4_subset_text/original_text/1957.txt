It's hard to believe that ten years ago, Taylor Swift was preparing to tour in support of her second studio album Fearless while Adele had  just won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. As for Beyoncé, she was still releasing tracks from her third studio album I Am… Sasha Fierce.
Flash forward to today and Swift is now the biggest pop star on the planet, having released six studio albums and racking up two Album of the Year awards in the process. Adele is one of the best-selling artists of all time and Beyoncé is, well, Beyoncé.
Oh, how things have changed!
Even the 2009 Grammys award ceremony now seems worlds away.
Lady Gaga had just received her first nomination for her chart-topping single "Just Dance" whileLil Wayne still dominated the rap categories.
Miley Cyrus teamed up with a surprise star for a country duet while the world had not yet been graced with the presence of Pharrell Williams' now infamous Arby's hat.
Needless to say, it was a much simpler time.
In anticipation for this Sunday
