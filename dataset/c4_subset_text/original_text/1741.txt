By 2030, scaled-up green power could meet the demands of a large grid 99.9 percent of the time, according to new research from  the University of Delaware.
A mix of offshore and onshore wind, along with contributions from solar power, could provide reliable power flow during all but a handful of days in the hypothetical four-year period under study.
Moreover, researchers found that scaling up renewable generation capacity to seemingly excessive levels -- more than three times the needed load, in some instances -- proved more cost-effective than scaling up storage capacity, due to the high systems costs associated with storage technology.
"That's a lot of overbuilding," said Willett Kempton, a professor in the School of Marine Science and Policy at the University of Delaware and a co-author of the study. Much of that excess capacity would be underused during all but a few days a year, he said.
At the same time, thermal power plants face a similar problem today through inefficiency, he added.
"If you think about it, power plants burn three times the amount of fuel energy needed to produce their energy
