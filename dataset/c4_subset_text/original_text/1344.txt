New Jersey lawmakers approved a plan to reinstate the individual mandate to try to stabilize the health insurance market.
TRENTON - Murphycare could  look a lot like Obamacare.
Lawmakers Thursday sent to Gov. Phil Murphy a bill that will require nearly all New Jerseyans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, in a bid to stabilize premiums for consumers in the Obamacare marketplace.
They approved another bill that would set up a reinsurance plan that would be paid partly for by the federal government and cover some of the most expensive health care claims.
"It's a two-pronged attack to get at premium costs,‚Äù said Linda Schwimmer, president and chief executive officer of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, a research and advocacy group.
The mandate bill passed 23-13 in the Senate and 50-23 in the Assembly. The reinsurance bill passed 22-14 in the Senate and 46-22 in the Assembly. Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal in the video above discusses the state's plans to protect Obamacare.
