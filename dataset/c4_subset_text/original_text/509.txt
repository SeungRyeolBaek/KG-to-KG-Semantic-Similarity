On October 30, a major new report on the impact of Marcellus Shale gas development on water resources will be issued. Water Resource Reporting  and Water Footprint from Marcellus Shale Development in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, was co-authored by Evan Hansen, president of the environmental analysis firm Downstream Strategies, and Dustin Mulvaney, Assistant Professor of Sustainable Energy Resources at San Jose State University. The report was developed in collaboration with Earthworks and funded by a Switzer Network Innovation Grant.
� Over 80% of the water used in fracking in West Virginia and over 70% used in Pennsylvania comes directly from rivers and streams.
� Over 90% of the water injected underground to fracture gas wells never returns to the surface, meaning it is permanently removed from the water cycle.
� In addition, critical data and information gaps exist that prevent researchers, policymakers, and the public from attaining a full picture of trends.
The authors analyze these and other trends and present recommendations for addressing water use and waste generation going forward.
