Every year, people count down the days until Starbucks unveils one of their most-popular offerings, the Pumpkin Spice Latte. The espresso- based concoction of pumpkin flavorings, spices, and sweet cream signals the coming of fall, and to some, there is a McRib-like fascination that only comes with products that aren’t available year-round.
And you can help make sure that the Pumpkin Spice Latte debuts in your city first. All you have to do is interact with Starbucks on Facebook.
For the second year in a row, Starbucks is holding the Pumpkin Spice Latte Challenge on Facebook. Beginning today, the challenge sees Starbucks fans competing to earn points for their city through shares on Facebook and Twitter, and various mini-games including word searches, trivia, and artistic contests.
Starbucks currently has over 31.4 million likes on Facebook.
Get your game face on, #pslchallenge starts tomorrow!
The city with the most points will be the first to receive Starbucks’ famous beverage. The company picks one U.S. and one Canadian city as winners.
