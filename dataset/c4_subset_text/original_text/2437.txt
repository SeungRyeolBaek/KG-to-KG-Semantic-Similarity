Accra, Jan. 7, GNA - President John Agyekum Kufuor was on Friday urged to use his next four -year term to further reconcile the nation. Various people who spoke to the Ghana News Agency on the day President Kufuor was inaugurated said he needed to do more to reconcile the nation.
Mr Mike Griffiths, a Director at Sunny FM, an Accra private radio station, noted that the reconciliation process initiated by the President and the Government was a good thing.
However, in recent times, there had been certain actions and inactions by the New Patriotic Party (NPP), which impeded reconciliation.
"I was disappointed for instance to see the statue of Dr J. B. Danquah, at Danquah Circle at Osu in Accra, covered with NPP flag although that roundabout and the statue are national monuments and not party monuments," he said.
Mr Griffiths said doing things in such a way went a long way to deepen the already existing politically pent up feelings, which were not good for national reconciliation.
