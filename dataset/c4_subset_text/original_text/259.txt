The total VR market will generate $5.1 billion this year, new report claims.
2016 is poised to be the year that virtual reality  really gets going, as Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR, and HTC Vive are all scheduled to make their commercial debuts this year. Now, research group SuperData has put out a report (via IGN) that provides some predictions for how well the systems will sell this year.
According to the report, Europe will lead the way with $1.9 billion in VR sales (hardware, accessories, and software) during 2016. The North American market will hit the No. 2 spot with $1.5 billion, while Asia ($1.1 billion) and the rest of the world ($0.6 billion) will follow.
Put together, the VR industry will generate $5.1 billion in 2016, according to SuperData's report.
That's up from $660 million in 2015, when headsets were only available to developers. SuperData added that it expects the VR market to swell to $8.9 billion in 2017 and climb to $12.3 billion in 2018
