The infamous “polar vortex” made a return to North America last week. Temperatures plunged to as low as minus 50 degrees across  the northern U.S. that led to several states of emergencies. Thousands of flights were canceled, and people were warned to stay inside to avoid instant frostbite.
One of our weather and commodity clients near the Canadian border reported a low of minus 56 degrees last week. Wind chill tempera-tures in North Dakota have been down to near minus 60 degrees. In Chicago, the Windy City, a low of minus 21 degrees was reported with a wind chill temperature of close to minus 40 degrees. The frigid temperature was just 6 degrees short of its all-time low temperature of minus 27 degrees.
It was so cold in the Chicago area that residents were hearing “frost quakes.” Also known as “cryoseisms,” water expands underground when it freezes very quickly. The fast expansion can stress the soil and split rocks resulting in loud booms. It’s a phenomenon that is relatively rare.
