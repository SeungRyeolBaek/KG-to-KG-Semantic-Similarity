WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama bowed to pressure yesterday and agreed to sign legislation giving Congress the right to reject any nuclear agreement with Iran.
The White  House conveyed the president's decision shortly before Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved a compromise version of the measure on a 19-0 vote. It was a sign that Congress would not back down on its insistence that lawmakers must have a say if any final deal with Iran involves the eventual lifting of crippling economic sanctions that Congress levied on Tehran.
The bill is now likely to clear both houses in the Republican-controlled Congress.
Obama had threatened to veto the original bill, but as news of the compromise leaked out on Capitol Hill, the White House abruptly acquiesced. The president, however, still retains the right to use his veto if Congress tries to scuttle an emerging deal with Iran, which is to be finalized by June 30.
"Maybe they saw the handwriting on the wall," House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said about the White House decision.
International negotiators are trying to reach a deal that would prevent Iran from being able to develop nuclear weapons.
