ORLANDO, Fla. -- While Lenny Wilkens was speaking with reporters outside of the Milk House Gym at Walt Disney World, New York  Knicks president and head coach Isiah Thomas, the man who fired Wilkens two years ago, hugged the Hall of Fame coach and before a short conversation.
Perhaps Thomas was sharing with Wilkens the Knicks' interest in acquiring Rashard Lewis. According to NBA insiders, the Knicks could make the Sonics a sign-and-trade offer for Lewis that could include Seattle natives Nate Robinson and Jamal Crawford.
Crawford is owed $35 million over the next four seasons, and the Knicks could add Robinson's contract or that of Channing Frye to come within 75 percent of a new Lewis deal, per rules of the collective bargaining agreement.
Wilkens said Tuesday that the Sonics plan to sign Lewis, who opted out of his contract Friday and will be an unrestricted free agent July 1. To execute a sign-and-trade, the Sonics would have to sign Lewis to a new contract and then trade him.
The Sonics have the advantage in re-signing Lewis
