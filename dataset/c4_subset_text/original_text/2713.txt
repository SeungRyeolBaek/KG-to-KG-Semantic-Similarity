THEY were imposters, all of them. Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney, John Terry, Ashley Cole â€“ the core  of the England national team for years and world-class players allegedly.
They were imposters wearing England football shirts on Friday night in Cape Town, pretending to be committed, controlled and clever international sportsmen at the World Cup finals.
They were nothing of the kind.
Vast multi-million-pound salaries should mean these are superstar footballers to rely on. Yet they played like paupers against Algeria, the poverty of their football astonishing to neutrals and enraging to supporters who had paid thousands of pounds to travel halfway across the world to watch them.
There was a poverty of spirit, a poverty of passing, a poverty of imagination and a poverty of technique.
Lampard played a wayward pass within two seconds of the kick-off to give the ball away, a simple 15-yard pass carelessly misdirected. Gareth Barry did the same with his first touch half a minute later. It would have been embarrassing on a Sunday morning parks pitch.
