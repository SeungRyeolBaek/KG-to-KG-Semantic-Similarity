ROY HODGSON has told his England team that they have achieved nothing yet and still have to prove themselves in a tournament situation.
 England go into tonight's second Euro 2016 warm-up against Holland at Wembley on a high after their remarkable 3-2 win over world champions Germany in Berlin on Saturday night.
Hodgson's reshaped young team earned plaudits from around the world as they fought back from two goals down and at the same time spark real optimism after a dismal 2014 World Cup and 2012 Euros.
He will reshuffle his pack again tonight against a Dutch side who surprisingly failed to qualify for this summer's championships but who will still provide formidable opposition.
But last night, in public, he was much more cautious. When asked if England could win the tournament this summer, he said: "It's the impossible question. Whatever I say. If I say 'yes', then it's 'Hodgson thinks we can win the Euros'. If I say it's a tough ask, then it's 'Hodgson has no confidence in the team'."
