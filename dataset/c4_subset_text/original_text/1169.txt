Move over Tim Hortons, Montreal's "King of the Food Court" Stanley Ma is swallowing Ontario's second largest coffee and doughnut chain. 
Through a subsidiary of his company, MTY Food Group Inc., Ma is buying Country Style Food Services Inc., owners of 490 Country Style and Buns Master locations.
The move fulfills the mainly Asian-style fast-food operator's goal of entering the coffee market, pitting it against far larger rivals Tim Hortons and Starbucks.
Before the purchase, which closes May 1, MTY owned 24 fast-food chains, including Tiki-Ming, Sushi Shop and Sukiyaki.
Buying Country Style dramatically boosts the number of locations MTY owns to nearly 1,500, up from 1,000.
It also gives the company a far bigger presence in Ontario, where it also owns Yogen Fruz and Cultures.
The purchase price will be disclosed when the deal closes May 1, a spokesperson for MTY said. MTY is expected to pay cash, the spokesperson added.
MTY has no immediate plans to change Country Style
