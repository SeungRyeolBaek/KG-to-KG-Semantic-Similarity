President Trump’s executive order rolling back President Barack Obama’s signature anti-global-warming measure stopped short of withdrawing from the historic  Paris climate accord — but raised international concerns Tuesday about whether the United States will do its share to fight the global threat.
Europe’s top climate official, European commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete, expressed “regret” about Trump’s executive order rolling back what he called the “main pillar” of U.S. climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, in a statement to The Washington Post.
“Now, it remains to be seen by which other means the United States intends to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement,” said Cañete.
The words of Cañete, one of the most prominent global diplomatic figures yet to comment on Trump’s move, signal how the president’s executive order eviscerating Obama’s climate plan is raising international concerns, and they further suggest that the country could be left isolated as other nations push forward to curb emissions.
