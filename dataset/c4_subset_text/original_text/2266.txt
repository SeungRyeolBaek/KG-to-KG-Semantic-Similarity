University of Tennessee Medical Center reported four adult flu deaths for the 2018-2019 season.
Flu season is officially over at the University of Tennessee  Medical Center.
That doesn't mean you can't still get sick with influenza. But the number and pattern of positive flu cases has declined enough that infectious disease physician Dr. Mark Rasnake, after reviewing the data, feels comfortable saying the 2018-2019 season is at an end.
Hospitals aren't required to report adult flu deaths, but Rasnake said UT Medical Center had four this season. Flu-related child deaths are reportable to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said 86 have occurred so far this year. One of those was in Tennessee.
Flu season in East Tennessee typically ends in March, Rasnake said, and it did so for most of the rest of the state.
"We started late and ended later than usual," he said.
But the season was much less severe than last year's, in East Tennessee as well as in other parts of the country. Though it will be months before the CDC releases its analysis
