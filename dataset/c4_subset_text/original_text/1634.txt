Lennie Gallant's beautiful new Christmas song with the Zimbabwean band Black Umfolosi started with a chance meeting in Charlottetown  this summer.
Gallant ran into his former agent and friend Bob Jensen downtown, they hopped in Lennie's pickup to listen to some cuts from the album he'd just finished recording, Time Travel, as well as new music from Black Umfolosi, an internationally-renowned world music band from Zimbabwe for which Jensen is the North American agent.
"Every now and then something a little bit magical happens," said Jensen. "We just came up with this little idea over lunch!"
That "little idea" was that Lennie would record a song on P.E.I. with Black Umfolosi in August as they were taking a break during a tour of eastern Canada.
"And I thought that would be something, that would be really great! I wonder what we would sing?" Gallant recalls. "I thought it would be amazing to have them singing on a Christmas song â€” I should write one."
He'd heard Black Umfolosi before at festivals in
