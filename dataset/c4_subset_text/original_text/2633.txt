Private equity fund Actis LLP plans to set up a new firm to house its operational renewable energy assets in India, attracted by the nation’ s growing green economy.
Actis will likely accommodate the solar projects of Essel Group in the new firm that the private equity fund plans to acquire in a deal valued at around $600 million, said a person aware of the development. It also plans to acquire around 200 megawatts (MW) of Shapoorji Pallonji group’s solar assets through Sprng Energy Pvt. Ltd.
The third firm being set up by Actis which is focused on the renewable energy space follows India’s largest clean energy deal wherein ReNew Power Ventures acquired Ostro Energy Pvt. Ltd from Actis LLP at an enterprise value of $1.5 billion last year. Actis plans to grow Sprng Energy to 1.75 gigawatts (GW) from its present 750MW portfolio.
“The new firm will house the operating assets for setting up a yield-based product. It will be a new platform wherein the bulk of the focus will be on renewable.
