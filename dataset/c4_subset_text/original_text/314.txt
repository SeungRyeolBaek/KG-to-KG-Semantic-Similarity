Bangalore: In the U.S., top outsourcing customers such as Bank of America and several local governments are asking vendors such as TCS,  Infosys and Wipro to deliver more projects locally. These outsourcing customers are also canceling job offers to foreign workers in an attempt to address anti offshoring sentiments and cope with legislative requirements of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP).
In the last few months, at least five new outsourcing contracts had new clauses which mandated that certain work be delivered onshore, reports The Economic Times. Under this regulation, Bank of America and other financial services organizations who have received funds under TARP need to ensure that they try and employ local American workers before hiring a foreign workers.
"Bank of America's Merill Lynch integration projects are being delivered locally because of TARP requirements. On any other day, it would have asked Infosys or other companies to do," said a U.S. based person familiar with the bank's outsourcing initiatives.
A spokeswoman at Bank of America confirmed that her company had canceled around 50 H1B job offers in order to comply with TARP
