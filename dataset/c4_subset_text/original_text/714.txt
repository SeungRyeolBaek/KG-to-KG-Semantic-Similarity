Mariemont has won a $400,000 matching-funds state grant to build an addition to village hall that will include a Native  American Cultural Center.
MARIEMONT – Construction has begun on an $800,000 addition to Mariemont Village Hall that will include a cultural center displaying Native American artifacts unearthed in the town.
The Mariemont Native American Cultural Center initially will exhibit artifacts it has on hand from digs at the Madisonville Site in Dogwood Park and the Wynema Village Site in the South 80 Gardens and Walking Trails Park.
