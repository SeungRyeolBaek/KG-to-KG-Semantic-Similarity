R untastic, the mobile-focused fitness tracking company that was recently acquired by Adidas for $239 has just launched its first official smartwatch.
Like every other smartwatch-wristband in the market, the analog wristwatch by Adidas doubles as an activity tracker called the Runtastic Moment. The smartwatch is brimming with pretty impressive abilities and has a combination of sensors, active minutes, and calories burned, as well as sleep cycles. Perhaps, the most exciting of all is that the analog wristwatch is waterproof up to 300 feet, which means it can be worn during swimming. It doesn’t exactly help wearer’s with swimming-related tracking, but it in the near future, Runtastic hopes to add features that may help track swim strokes.
Its nonchargeable battery life looks promising as well. Runtastic estimated that the watch should last for about 6 month on a standard coin battery.
