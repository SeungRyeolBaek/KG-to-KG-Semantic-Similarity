Does your primary PC or laptop run off an HDD or SSD?
my primary PC has an SSD.
enough RAM and an SSD are the  starting points of any build.
Took a while, but I am running close to 100% on SSD as a primary drive on all my machines. Laptop came preconfigured with SSD and everything else but my FreeNAS server is now running off some sort of SSD. Technically the FreeNAS runs off a USB stick, but all the drives are spinning platters.
Spinning drive for everything. I would like a SSD though.
It's a must for games. It's not just loading times for the OS, everything loads faster from disk to memory.
120 gb SSD with HDD external for large storage. Benefit of speed and space. 120gb SSD now floating around the net for around R 600. Well worth it for the performance boost.
SSD is the way to go. Running a nice Samsung 960 Evo in my primary laptop, with a 1tb HDD secondary drive, and work upgraded us all the SSDs about a year ago.
