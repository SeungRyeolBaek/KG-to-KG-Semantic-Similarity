I have contacted a number of churches to aid me, but they cannot for a number of reasons. My neighbor suggested I contact you. I am a single woman and am disabled and I live on a fixed income. All of my family members have passed, so I do not have any relatives to count on.
My biggest concern is with my well pump. The bladder tank went bad causing the pump to keep running. I was told that a leaky toilet and the hot water heater contributed to this problem. I have included an estimate from a local repair service to fix it.
I realize that this is a problem I cannot ignore. But I just do not have that amount of money
