Anyone who collects posters has heard of Mondo. They’re the Austin, TX-based company making some of the best limited-edition , collectable posters in the world. Next month, they’re hosting their second convention: MondoCon.
MondoCon takes place October 3-4 in Austin, and will feature two days of pure awesome for collectors. There will be panels on the creation of various posters, artists talking about their process, designers discussing limited release vinyl pressings, and screenings of classics like Batman and The Goonies (complete with exclusive posters)—not to mention two huge rooms filled with brand new art, posters, vinyl, toys, and anything else you can imagine.
Oh, and there’s a bar in there too.
This year, MondoCon has its own gig poster by The Dude Designs and we’re stoked to exclusively debut it here. It’s a completely hilarious take on The Warriors, but reimagined with the Mondo staff and some of the artists who’ll be on hand. Check it out.
