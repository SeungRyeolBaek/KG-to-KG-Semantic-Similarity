While Bill Mathesius is correct in supporting individual rights, he fails to consider how drug use violates the welfare of others. Has he thought about  the children of drug-using parents? This would be a sizable population.
He could obtain information by visiting the psychiatric hospital programs for children (about 10 in New Jersey, and more are opening) or by looking at worker caseloads (abused and neglected children) at the Division of Youth and Family Services.
Has he considered drug-related accidents? Some substances can impair perception for days without apparent awareness on the part of the user. Were he to support drug testing of people responsible for accidents resulting in serious injury, especially auto- or work-related mishaps, we could better assess the problem of drug-involved injuries to others.
Is Mr. Mathesius going to provide free drugs to the using public, and who will pay for that? Certainly addicts will continue to steal to support drug habits regardless of whether purchases are made on the street or at the local pharmacy.
