The recent Terminator movie is what the last one SHOULD have been. No more time travelling - this is the period where the machines wake up, the  human race hardens up, and the CIA stops pushing too many pencils. Terminator Salvation the game, is set just before the events of the movie, we reviewed it on PS3.
Terminator is a 3rd person cover shooter that you can play solo or split screen with someone next to you. The machines have some heavy duty firepower, so you and your squad will need to rely heavily on shoot & move tactics, which suits the movies perfectly. Each new room will contain several bits of cover, a la Gears of War, and your health won't go back up until the firefight is over. If you're pinned down on 10% health with no ammo, you're already dead. You just don't know it yet.
Emphasis is placed on flanking, and there's always some side path that'll take you right round the robotic rear. Even if they just follow you, you're squadmates are smart enough to pop em in the back.
Yeah, useful
