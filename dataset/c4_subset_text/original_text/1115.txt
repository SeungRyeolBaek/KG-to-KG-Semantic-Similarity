The Filas Family Home, 710 Shady Ave.
A broad luminary-lit walk leads to this impressive traditional home. The family 's vision came to life with an open floor plan, designed by the homeowner, that encompasses comfort and togetherness while also maintaining a high-efficiency standard. Our decorator has chosen a monochromatic theme for this stone and LP SmartSide Green Building sided home, adding emphasis with varied textures. Upon entering the foyer, your eyes are drawn to an impressive Christmas tree. Close by, a unique ottoman is ready for seated poses â€“ perhaps a picture for the holiday greeting card. A signed Leroy Neiman print complements the intricate bookcase that holds a complete set of 1890 Charles Dickens novels; given to the homeowner by her grandfather.
An arched entryway invites you to explore this five-bedroom, 4.5-bath beauty further. Gaze at the 6-foot-high reclaimed natural wood mirrors as you make your way to the master suite that opens off the grand living room. The simplicity of the bedroom calms your soul with earth-inspired hues.
