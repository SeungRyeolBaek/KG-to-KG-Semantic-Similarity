An Upper East Side woman who loves birds so much that she changed her name to Dove claims she was attacked by a neighbor who flew into a rage  when he caught her feeding pigeons.
But retired teacher Arthur Schwartz says the woman is a known birdbrain whose scattered seed attracts rats.
The feathers started flying Saturday when Schwartz caught Anna Dove — formerly known as Augusta Kugelmas — tossing seeds to pigeons near his apartment on East 93rd Street.
“It’s disgusting,” said Schwartz, 61. “There are rats every day. They eat this stuff.
Schwartz admitted that he got so angry, he grabbed her bag of birdseed and tossed it over a fence. A passer-by saw the confrontation and called 911. But Schwartz and his wife took wing and drove off before the cops showed up.
Dove, 63, insists she’s the victim. “The guy was violent. I wouldn’t be surprised if he had a weapon the next time,” she said.
Dove filed a police report charging Schwartz with poking and shoving
