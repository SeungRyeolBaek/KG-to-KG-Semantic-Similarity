Greetings, programs. You can now wear a part of Tron: Legacy on your head, as Monster reveals headphones based on the forthcoming film. Branded with a Daft Punk logo, they light up and everything.
Monster's line of Tron-tastic light-up products include the T1 over-the-ear cans, T3 in-ear headphones and Identity iPod dock, which is modelled on the film's data disc. Get the Tron app on your iPhone or iPod touch and you can unlock a film-themed alarm clock for use with the dock.
The T1 Tronphones offer noise-isolating technology and an adjustable LED Light Drive system -- in other words, they light up. They also come with a removable boom mic, which attaches to either ear to turn it into a gaming headset -- perfect for playing Tron: Evolution. The headphones all support Monster ControlTalk voice-activated hands-free phone calls.
