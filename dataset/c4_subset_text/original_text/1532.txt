Toronto, Canada â€“ LONDON (Reuters) - Tiger Woods&apos;s former coach Butch Harmon believes the world number one must risk  the humiliation and embarrassment of a full and frank news conference over his infidelities before he can get on with his life.
"But where the hell is he? We could find Osama bin Laden easier than we can find Tiger Woods. How long can you spend on a yacht in the middle of the ocean."
Harmon, who now coaches world number two Phil Mickelson and does occasional commentary work for the UK television channel Sky Sports, said the 14-times major champion would have to put up with verbal asides from the crowds when he returns to golf.
"The difficult part, in my opinion, is going to be the heckling from the galleries," he said. "He is going to get it.
"If he plays in the Ryder Cup (in Wales in October) which I happen to think he will, that is going to be very interesting."
Harmon, who believes Woods is likely to return for one of the four PGA Tour events
