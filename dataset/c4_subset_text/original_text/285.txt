Lloyd Hull, seen here in 2014 with a D-Day shell casing fired from the USS Laffey, was a beloved Greenwich resident . His family is paying tribute to him with a concert in his memory from the London Philharmonic.
GREENWICH â€” A local performance by the London Philharmonic will be dedicated to a Greenwich icon.
While in the area for concerts this month at Lincoln Center, the London Philharmonic Orchestra will also pay a visit to Stamford for gala performance at 8 p.m. April 16 at The Palace theater.
The Stamford concert, a benefit for the local Young Artists Philharmonic, will be performed in memory of Lloyd Hull, a longtime Greenwich resident, World War II veteran and dedicated town volunteer. The choice to honor his memory was made by his one of his daughters, Lady Victoria Robey, an officer of the order of the British Empire who is also chairman of the philharmonic.
She, along with a committee of family members and Greenwich residents, organized the one-night stop in Stamford for the the 100-piece London Philharmonic.
