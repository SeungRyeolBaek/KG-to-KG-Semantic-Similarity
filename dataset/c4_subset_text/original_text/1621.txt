Four men, including one from Derby, are due in court to face extradition proceedings after being arrested in Britain as part of an international investigation into an  alleged Islamist terror network.
The suspects were among 13 arrested across Europe by investigators probing a group called Rawti Shax, which is described as a ``terrorist organisation of Kurdish-Sunni origin''.
The four men arrested in the UK on Thursday, who are not believed to be British nationals, are aged 38, 32, 33 and 52, from Hull, Derby, Birmingham and Sheffield respectively and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court today.
Suspects were also arrested in Italy and Norway, while authorities in Italy, Germany, Finland, Norway, Switzerland and the UK also searched a total of 26 properties and seized several items including electronic devices and documents.
Eurojust, the EU agency which co-ordinated the raids, said suspected leaders and several members of the group were arrested during simultaneous activity in six countries.
The suspects were feared to be planning to target British diplomats following the imprisonment of the ideological leader of Rawti Shax, the Sun reported.
