Preliminary data suggest that smart phone apps and wearable sensors are promising for improving cardiovascular health behaviors.
Self-monitoring is a key facet  of changing behavior to prevent and manage heart health. Smartphone apps and wearable sensors have the potential to encourage positive change.
DALLAS — Smartphone applications and wearable sensors have the potential to help people make healthier lifestyle choices, but scientific evidence of mobile health technologies’ effectiveness for reducing risk factors for heart disease and stroke is limited, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, published in the association’s journal Circulation.
The new statement reviewed the small body of published, peer-reviewed studies about the effectiveness of mobile health technologies (mHealth) for managing weight, increasing physical activity, quitting smoking and controlling high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
