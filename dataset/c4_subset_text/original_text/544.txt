Tisdale, who is from Lugoff-Elgin, played four years for the Winthrop University team and two years of independent professional baseball .
He coached high school baseball in Miami, where he earned region coach of the year honors. “I had good kids to work with,” said Tisdale.
After meeting with returning York players in the school’s media center last week, Tisdale said he left the get-acquainted session feeling good about his new coaching position.
“There’s support from the administration, athletic director and the community,” he said.
Tisdale said he knows Region 3-AAAA is a strong region. “Every game is a challenge,” he said.
While he is eager to embrace his new role, Tisdale said, he plans to touch all the bases. He wants to get a firsthand look at baseball in the community, whether it’s youth play at the York Recreation Complex, Dixie Boys at Optimist Park or Junior Legion baseball at the YCHS complex.
