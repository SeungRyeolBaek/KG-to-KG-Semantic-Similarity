Consultant recommends candidates from Miami, Colorado and New Jersey from among 28 applicants.
A consultant is recommending that Brevard County commissioners interview three  candidates for consideration as the next county manager.
Daniel Alfonso, the city manager of Miami.
Todd Leopold, the former county manager of Adams County, Colorado.
John Pulomena, the county administrator in Middlesex County, New Jersey.
Higginbotham also named Dale Walker, the former county manager of Macon-Bibb County in Georgia, as a semifinalist.
The recommendation came from a pool of 28 people who applied for the position, a figure that was less than what Higginbotham initially had expected.
County commissioners can decide to hire one of the recommended candidates, hire someone else who applied or recruit someone else for the position.
