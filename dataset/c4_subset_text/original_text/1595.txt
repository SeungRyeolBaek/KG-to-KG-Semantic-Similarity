After a frustrating six months which saw her fall from the cusp of the world's top 100 to 153 in the world, Katie O'Brien  is back on form and very close to joining Anne Keothavong in the promised land. As she sets her sights on a good grasscourt season, Katie talks about why she has improved, on almost being in the top 100 and why the women on tour are useless at socialising.
On her terrific year so far: I’ve been playing really well and in general I’ve had a really good year so I’m really looking forward to the upcoming tournaments.
On playing on clay: I’m much more comfortable on it than I used to be. A lot of Brits don’t particularly like the clay but I don’t mind it. The French is harder to qualify for than the other Slams because of the clay.
On hopefully getting automatic qualification for Wimbledon: I didn’t expect that, to be honest. I started the year just wanting to turn over a new leaf and everything came together really well.
