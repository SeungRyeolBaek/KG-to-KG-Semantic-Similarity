Video footage has shown masked men firing shots during the funeral of a West Belfast republican.
Police have launched an investigation after a video of the incident  emerged on social media.
Barry McMullan, who is understood to have been a senior figure in the Irish republican Socialist Party (IRSP) – the political wing of the INLA – was buried in Belfast on Monday.
A video of the funeral appeared on Belfast IRSP Facebook page on Tuesday, showing mourners and a republican band gathered outside his west Belfast home, where the coffin was put on display in the street.
It was draped with a Starry Plough flag and a number of men wearing paramilitary style uniforms could be seen at the funeral.
As the funeral cortege made its way along Whiterock Road towards Milltown Cemetery, the video captures two masked men dressed in black paramilitary garb with dark sunglasses and berets, firing off a volley of handgun shots into the air.
Two young children dressed in their school uniforms were standing next to the masked gunmen when the shots rang out. It is not clear if the bullets were live rounds or blanks
