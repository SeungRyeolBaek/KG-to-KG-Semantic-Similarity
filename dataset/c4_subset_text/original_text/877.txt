Chelsea defender Gary Cahill has been ruled out of England's World Cup qualifier with San Marino on Friday.
Cahill hurt his knee in  Sunday's game against West Ham and will not play in Rimini but will be reassessed ahead of next Tuesday's game against Montenegro.
Newcastle centre-half Steven Taylor has been called up following some impressive recent performances in the Barclays Premier League.
Cahill's absence adds to coach Roy Hodgson's defensive woes. Spurs' Michael Dawson pulled out on Sunday, to be replaced by Joleon Lescott, while Rio Ferdinand also pulled out of the squad on Monday as he continues to follow an intricate fitness programme.
Steven Caulker was Ferdinand's replacement with the Manchester United man and Dawson ruled out of both matches over the next week. Whilst Hodgson's defensive formation for Friday's encounter with San Marino may not be a concern, next week's clash with Montenegro in Podgorica certainly will be.
Unless Cahill's knee injury eases sufficiently for him to be made available, England face the uncomfortable scenario of selecting between players who have next to no international experience
