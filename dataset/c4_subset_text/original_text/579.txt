The Office of Multicultural Affairs facilitates the Navigation mentoring program that pairs students with a faculty or staff member who will serve as their Navigation Partner throughout  their journey at the University of Dayton. A Navigation Partner can answer questions, be a listening ear, and connect students with resources and opportunities for success.
Student engagement with faculty members outside of the classroom has been consistently found to promote student persistence, educational aspirations, and degree completion (Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991, 2005). Positive faculty relationships have been shown to predict student learning and other positive outcomes for African-American, Latino/a, Asian, and Native American students (Kuh & Hu, 2001; Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991; Tinto, 1993). We offer this program as we believe that this is an experience that all students will find valuable.
