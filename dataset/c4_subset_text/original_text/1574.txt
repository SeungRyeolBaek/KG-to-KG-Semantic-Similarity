Deep in the Atacama Desert of Chile, chemical company SQM pumps saline brine from underground reservoirs into hundreds of giant rectangular pools. As  the brine slowly evaporates, the liquid turns into varying shades of green and blue resembling an artist’s palette.
A liquid called lithium chloride remains, which is shipped to refineries to produce lithium carbonate and hydroxide, vital materials for lithium-ion battery production.
In recent months, Chinese engineers and businessmen have visited the plants, hinting at China’s desire to secure supplies of lithium, a key component for the high-tech industry.
It’s hard to overstate the importance of lithium in the context of current battery technologies. Lithium-ion batteries are efficient and have low self-discharge. They’re the most popular type of rechargeable battery for home electronics, mobile phones, and electric cars.
A remote region in central South America, formed through millions of years of natural leaching from the Andes Mountains, holds one-fifth of the world’s known lithium reserves.
