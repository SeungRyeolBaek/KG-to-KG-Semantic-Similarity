Red Bluff >> State Sen. Jim Nielsen, R-Gerber, and Tehama County Supervisor Bob Williams and have been fined $10 ,000 and $13,000 respectively for campaign finance violations stemming from Williams’ unsuccessful 2012 run for the California Assembly.
The California Fair Political Practices Commission released a report this week on its website detailing “an earmarked, over-the-limit contribution” to Williams’ campaign totaling $4,320 to pay for a radio advertisement supporting Williams. Individual contributions are limited to $3,900, which Nielsen made. The larger contribution was made through the Tehama County Republican Central Committee and was earmarked for Williams in violation of campaign finance law, the report said.
In addition, Nielsen filed a campaign statement for the first half of 2012 “erroneously reporting information regarding that contribution,” the report said.
For his part, Williams, Friends of Williams and Friends of Williams treasurer David Bauer violated rules when they accepted the over-the-limit contribution from Taxpayers for Nielsen and filed a campaign statement for May 20 through June 30, 2012, errone
