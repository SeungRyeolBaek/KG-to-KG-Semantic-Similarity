Music streaming service Spotify has announced that users can once again sign up to listen to the service for free.
The company allowed users to join for  nothing when it launched, but last year ceased to offer free accounts to new members, unless they were invited by an existing premium member.
Now, a new account type, named Spotify Open, allows users once again to sign up for streaming music at no cost – but, like the older free subscriptions, includes adverts every few minutes between tracks. The catch? Spotify Open users can only listen to the service free for 20 hours a month.
The new account is part of a refresh of the company’s subscriptions policy, which sees it introducing Spotify Unlimited – essentially the old, unlimited free service with adverts. Only this time it’ll cost you a penny under a fiver each month.
Spotify Premium, which saves users from the bleating of ‘Jonathan from Spotify’ and the solicitations of various dating web sites, still costs £9.99 a month. It enables subscribers to use Spotify playlists offline on their iPhone, iPod Touch or Android mobile
