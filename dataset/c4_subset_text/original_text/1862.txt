When more than one value in a calculation has been rounded, the upper or lower bounds for each value should be used in the calculation to find the  greatest or least possible values that the calculation can take.
A bag of flour has a mass of 1500 g (to the nearest 10 g). Find the upper bound for the mass of 10 bags of flour.
The upper bound of 1500 g rounded to the nearest 10 g is 1505 g. The upper bound for 10 bags of flour is therefore ( = 15.05 kg).
Jack is 1.8 m tall (rounded to the nearest 10 cm). Ella is 1.63 m tall (rounded to the nearest cm). What is the smallest possible difference in their heights?
To find the smallest difference, we need to use the lower bound for Jack’s height and the upper bound for Ella’s height. The lower bound of 1.8 m (rounded to the nearest 10 cm) is 1.75 m. The upper bound of 1.63 m (rounded to the nearest cm) is 1.635 m.
