The University of Vermont Health Network will be moving its captive insurance company to Vermont from Bermuda.
The UVM Health Network website said, “ The action comes as the result of a unanimous decision by the Board of Directors of VMC Indemnity Company, Ltd., the health network subsidiary that provides medical malpractice insurance coverage for its medical providers.
“Because of its reputation for offering a predictable and stable regulatory environment, Vermont has become a leading location for captive insurance companies, a standard self-insurance practice option for academic medical centers that can make malpractice insurance less expensive than what is available through commercial insurance companies.
“We had an analysis done comparing the two locations and it is clear we can continue to provide low-cost, predictable insurance coverage to our providers if the company is located in Vermont,” said John Brumsted, M.D., president and CEO of the UVM Health Network and VMCIC board member.
“Our captive insurance industry is a shining example of what can be accomplished when we work together to provide and grow good jobs here in Vermont,” said Governor Phil Scott
