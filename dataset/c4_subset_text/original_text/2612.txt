The Home of Hope Orphanage’s Surfing Safari officially began on Monday along the Arabian Sea (part of the Indian Ocean) at  the beautiful cliffside town of Varkala Beach. Today’s post will not be too wordy because the pictures speak for themselves.
The experience today has been one of the more emotionally draining assignments I’ve ever shot. It’s strange because normally when I would refer to an emotional assignment it would a sad or tragic story, whereas today was filled with only happiness. To see the absolute joy on the faces of the 27 orphans was something I’ll never forget. The unbelievably tragic backgrounds that they come from and the fact that they have no real childhood cannot be forgotten when looking at the pictures. The word “vacation” does not exist in their vocabulary.

The patience and love that instructor Jack Viorel demonstrates while working with the girls is wonderful to watch
