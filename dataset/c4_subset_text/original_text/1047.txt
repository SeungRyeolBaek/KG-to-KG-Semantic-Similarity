The mission of the Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Media (AIEM) research group at Boston University is to conduct research and foster education in areas related to  artificial intelligence and emerging media. We explore and create techniques from machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to interpret emerging media, their role in mass and interpersonal communication, and understand the human and automated processes by which emerging media are developed, marketed, shaped and reshaped by users.
The group’s weekly research meetings are open to colleagues and students who are interested in joining BU AIEM (Hariri Institute, Fishbowl, Wednesdays 1-3 pm).
BU AIEM is housed in the Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science & Engineering and is part of BU’s Artificial Intelligence (AIR) Initiative. Our team members are affiliated with various colleges and departments throughout Boston University, including the College of Arts and Sciences (Department of Computer Science), the College of Communication (Division of Emerging Media), and the College of Engineering (Department of Computer Engineering).
BU AIEM started with a Hariri Institute incubator research award in June 2016 led by Lei
