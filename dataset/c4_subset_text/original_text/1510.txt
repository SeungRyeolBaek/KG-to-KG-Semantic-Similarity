FRANKLIN � The Franklin High School Class of 1972 and 1973 will donate $1,500 toward the creation of a scholarship in memory of Lex i and Sean Munroe.
The alumni raised the money from their 40th reunion, held last fall. The School Committee will formally accept the donation next month.
Assistant Superintendent Sally Winslow, a member of the class, said the one-time scholarship would go to a high school student who attended Davis Thayer Elementary School.
Lexi and Sean, 8 and 7, respectively, were students at the West Central Street school, known for its tight-knit community.
The children died last month in what authorities called a "tragic accident." A wooden chest they climbed into�while playing shut and locked, trapping them inside.
Their deaths sparked renewed warnings about the dangers of the Lane Company chests that were recalled in 1996.�The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission�warned of safety hazards stemming from a latch that locks automatically in chests manufactured between 1912 and 1987.
These chests are still being sold in second-hand stores and handed down in families.
