The Jeep Grand Cherokee is one of the brightest stars among the cars that propelled Chrysler--now controlled by Fiat--to a 26-percent sales increase  in 2011, raising its share of the U.S. market 1.3 points to 10.7 percent.
Yesterday, the company said it would start building a diesel version of the Grand Cherokee next year, its first diesel passenger vehicle in several years.
That confirms a statement by Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne from last April that the popular Jeep crossover would get a diesel option, which he reiterated in October.
The new clean-diesel sport-utility vehicle was buried in an announcement that Chrysler would add a third production shift at its Jefferson North assembly plant in Detroit next year, hiring 1,100 new workers in the process.
That plant now builds the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, and will eventually add low-volume production of a Maserati sport-utility vehicle previewed by the Kubang concept at the Frankfurt Motor Show last fall.
