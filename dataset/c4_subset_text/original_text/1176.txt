When Michael Fitzgerald first came to New York 21 years ago, he didn’t give the Big Apple much of a chance.
“ I had studied jewellery design at NCAD and ran a successful business with a couple of other jewellers on George’s Street while throwing myself into Dublin’s nightlife with great enthusiasm,” he recalls.
“It was 1996 and Dublin was an amazing place. But I thought I’d extend my horizons and try New York on a six month holiday visa. I had been to the World Cup in 1994 and loved NYC,” he says.
Where better than New York to kick start a career in this industry?
New York was just recovering from the ravages of a crack epidemic, which was rampant during the 1980s, so there were cheap rental opportunities across the city.
It was here that he met his wife, also a jewellery maker, with whom he now runs his business. Fitzgerald Jewelry was founded by Fitzgerald and his wife Hiroyo, originally from Japan, as a small studio and workshop in 2001.
