RIO DE JANEIRO — The three other U.S. swimmers were lying on the ground, following their assailant’s orders , when the gunman turned to Ryan Lochte, one of Team USA’s charming stars.
The four swimmers on the U.S. Olympic team lost their money and wallets but otherwise escaped unharmed from the gunmen who were posing as police officers. The harrowing assault, however, amounts to the most serious breach of security against American athletes in these Olympics, and it follows a troubling pattern of robbery, gunfire and assaults that call into question the ability of Brazil's security forces to keep participants and fans safe.
For a city on high alert for foreign-born terrorism, it has been the everyday domestic crimes that have disrupted the Olympics. While police and security officials say the city's overall crime rate fell during the first week of the Games, helped by more than 80,000 soldiers and police deployed on the streets around stadiums and along bus routes, thieves have managed to prey on several Olympic participants and high-profile officials, even in tourist-friendly areas and near Olympic venues.
