WAUPACA - No criminal charges will be filed  in the traffic crash that killed John "Jack" Penney, a longtime Waupaca County supervisor and former Waupaca County sheriff's captain.
Police said Penney was walking north across Royalton Street at Harding Street about 1:15 p.m. Sunday when he was hit by an eastbound SUV driven by Richard Morales, of Waupaca.
Penny was in the crosswalk, having already cleared one traffic lane, at the time of the crash. He was taken to ThedaCare Medical Center-Waupaca and then was airlifted to ThedaCare Regional Medical Center-Neenah. He died from his injuries Monday.
Morales was cited for failure to yield the right of way to a pedestrian at an uncontrolled intersection.
"It's a tragedy all around," Police Chief Brian Hoelzel told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin. "Jack was 86, and this gentleman (Morales) was 83."
