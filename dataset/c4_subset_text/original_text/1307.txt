It's easy to dump shortcuts, files and other miscellany on to your desktop for quick access or for convenience's sake, but before long  you can be left with a forest of icons and thumbnails obscuring the wallpaper beneath. If your desktop could use a clean up, we're here to tell you how to go about it.
These tips are primarily written with Windows in mind, though you can apply some of the same general principles to Mac OS or Linux to suit your setup.
The desktop is often the go-to place to store email attachments, photos and downloads, but once you've opened or dealt with a file then it can sit there gathering virtual dust. Instead of using your desktop as a temporary store, create a temp folder specifically for that purpose—use it for files that are only needed for a few minutes until they get uploaded or sent elsewhere.
Don't save anything that's important to this folder, like a cherished holiday photo that you only have one copy of. Use it for stuff that's duplicated elsewhere or that you can easily find again on the Web—basically anything that you can live without
