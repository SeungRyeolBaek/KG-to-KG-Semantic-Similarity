How do the visual images we experience, which have no tangible existence, arise out of physical processes in the brain? New research at the Weiz mann Institute of Science provided evidence, for the first time, that an ‘ignition’ of intense neural activity underlies the experience of seeing.
In research recently published in the journal Neuron, Prof. Rafael Malach and research student Lior Fisch of the Weizmann Institute’s Neurobiology Department worked with a neurosurgeon, Dr. Itzhak Fried of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, a distinguished team of medical doctors from the Center and Weizmann Institute students. They asked a group of epileptic patients who had had electrodes clinically implanted into their brains in preparation for surgery to volunteer for some perceptual awareness tasks. The subjects looked at a computer screen, which briefly presented a ‘target’ image – a face, house, or man-made object. This image was followed by a ‘mask’ – a meaningless picture for distraction – at different time intervals after the target image had been presented. This allowed the experimenter to control
