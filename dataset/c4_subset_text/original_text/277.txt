Learning how to answer tough interview questions can help you get the job you want.
Interview questions that ask you what you will contribute to the company  are designed to help employers weed out the best applicants. Your answer to this kind of question should demonstrate that you've done your homework on the company and understand its needs, and that you have the ability to think under pressure.
Research the company and the position you are applying for so you know how to formulate your answers. Read through the company's website to learn more about its culture, mission, strategic vision, management team and history. Try to find news or industry articles on the company that detail some of its recent growth initiatives as well as its strategy for winning market share from competitors. Find out what the company's current needs and priorities are and then use that information to answer the questions with confidence and without hesitation.
Provide specific examples from your past work experiences that demonstrate how you used your skills to benefit previous employers. For example, you might discuss a recent project you completed on time and under budget, or how you set up a new software program that helped the company improve its performance.
