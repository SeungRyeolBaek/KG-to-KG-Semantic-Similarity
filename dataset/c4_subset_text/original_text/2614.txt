CRISTIANO RONALDO will not win an appeal over his Champions League red card because of the nature of the incident.
That ’s the view of ESPN pundit Craig Burley, who says that although he didn’t think it was a red card, there was still physical contact and so it will be difficult to overturn the decision.
Ronaldo was given his marching orders in Juventus’ 2-0 win over Valencia at the Mestalla last night - his first game in the competition for the Old Lady.
As a result, the former Real Madrid forward gets an automatic one-game Champions League ban, meaning he definitely misses Juventus' home game against Young Boys on October 2.
But it could get worse, with UEFA opening disciplinary proceedings over the incident, meaning the 33-year-old could see his ban increased to two or even three matches.
Should he be banned for one extra game, Ronaldo would miss the trip to Old Trafford to face his old club Manchester United.
Should he be banned for three, he would miss the return game against them in Turin.
