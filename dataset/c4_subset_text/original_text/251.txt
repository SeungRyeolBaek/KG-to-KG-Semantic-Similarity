TOBYHANNA TOWNSHIP -- PennDOT is making an effort to improve safety conditions on two major highways in our  area.
On Monday, crews began installing guide rails along Interstate 380 in Monroe County to prevent vehicles from crossing over the median and into oncoming traffic. PennDOT also plans to place them along Interstate 80 in Monroe and Carbon Counties.
PennDOT is placing the new guide rails along the interstates in an effort to prevent drivers from crossing over the medians and into the opposite lanes.
"I definitely think it's something that should have been done a long time ago, but as long as they're getting it done now, definitely,” said Jennifer Greeley from Tobyhanna.
“I drive down that road and cars are really crazy and like I said, you're a good driver, but you don't know good the other driver is, and next thing you know, there goes an accident,” said Diana Cruz from Tobyhanna.
The guide rails are going in after several crossover crashes resulted in deaths on those highways.
