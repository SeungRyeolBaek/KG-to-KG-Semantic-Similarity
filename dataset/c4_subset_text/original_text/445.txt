Roadwork continues in Madison Twp.
WEST POINT — Madison Township’s road crew continues its work on potholes and  cleanup of trees following recent storms.
In his report last Wednesday to trustees, road foreman Gary Mitchell announced the road crew is currently in the middle of hot patching various roads throughout the township and will be continuing its efforts until entirely finished.
Mitchell reported one request for work for a culvert pipe cleanout on McDonald has been put on hold until the hot patching process is complete.

Mitchell also said, due to mechanical problems with the mower, crews have not been able to continue mowing. He also stated loggers have been looking at property on Cann
