Nick Duncan was nominated as one of the People's Best New Chefs by Food and Wine Magazine.
A new food truck on State Street advert ises Indian tacos, but you won't find saag paneer and biryani wrapped in a portable naan blanket. Mist'Delish serves up Native American tacos, enchiladas and frybreads.
So what exactly is a Native American frybread?
"It's a dough that's really, really super soft, and once I place it in the fryer, it just puffs up really big," explained owner Misty Lara through the window of her new truck on a recent chilly evening.
Mist'Delish opened on March 1 at 4210 W. State St.
"A lot of these recipes are from my great-grandma," said Lara. "I just felt, well, there's no Native American restaurants here that sell any Native American food, so I knew it was going to be a good place to start."
Mist'Delish is open Monday through Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.-ish. You
