Nancy McGowan is no stranger to volunteer work. The retired Independence school teacher volunteers with Fun and Crafts, a spin-off program of  the Auxiliary. Fun and Crafts makes a variety of free items for Centerpoint patients and their families.
The group makes pillows for patients and stuffed animals for children of patients and blankets for every baby born. They also make “walker caddies” that are carrying pouches attached to walkers.
She also volunteers at Youth Friends, a school based-mentoring network program in the Kansas City metro area. McGowan also volunteers at various projects at Vesper Hall.
What do you do within the Fun and Crafts?
I make the tray favors. I make about 200 of those a month. It’s like a get well card for patients to let them know someone’s thinking about them. I spend about 15 to 20 hours making them.
What do you most enjoy about your volunteer work?
You get to help people and make a lot of new friends. I enjoy working with people and kids. That kind of keeps me
