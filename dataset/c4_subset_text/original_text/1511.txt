The media's expectations of Auburn entering 2016 are far lower than they were a year ago.
Auburn was picked to finish 6th in  the SEC West by the 331 media members to vote in the annual SEC Media Days poll, which was released Thursday in Hoover.
The Tigers received 890 total points in the poll, a sizeable distance behind Arkansas (1,047 points) and ahead of Mississippi State (518).
No members of the media picked Auburn, which was the media's pick to the conference heading into last season, to win the SEC West division or the conference as a whole this year. By comparison, 246 voters Alabama to repeat as division champs, with 223 picking the Crimson Tide to win the conference title again.
Tennessee was the media's pick to win the SEC East.
The media has correctly selected the SEC champion five times in 24 tries, with just three successful picks in the last 20 years.
Auburn was picked to win the SEC at last year's media days, which had the odd twist of Alabama receiving more aggregate points to win the West division but Auburn being the more popular pick
