The Black Lives Matter flag will go up at Rutland High School for 400 days, starting Friday.
Vermont's Rutland High School  is set to raise the Black Lives Matter flag Friday.
Students sought permission to fly the flag from the Rutland City Public Schools Board of Commissioners, according to the Associated Press. One board member, Kam Johnston, indicated he rescinded the initial decision to fly the flag in order "to allow for more student input and address concerns."
The board confirmed that the plan was in motion in a Tuesday vote.
It won't just be for a few weeks, either: The school is going to keep it up for 400 days.
Rutland High School is the latest in a number of other educational institutions that have sought to raise the flag in the Green Mountain State.
High schools in Burlington, South Burlington and the state's capital, Montpelier, as well as Champlain Valley Union High School in Hinesburg have raised the flag on school grounds.
