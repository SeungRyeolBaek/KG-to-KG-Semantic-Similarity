MIAMI — A little extra bullpen help would be a relief to the Mets.
Even with the rotation showing signs of wear and tear, the  team’s primary focus heading toward the Aug. 1 non-waiver trade deadline remains another reliever, according to a person with knowledge of the organization’s thinking.
Bartolo Colon is struggling and Steven Matz and Noah Syndergaard are both dealing with bone spurs. Plus, there are continuing questions whether Logan Verrett can pitch effectively enough to warrant a rotation spot.
But given the inventory of available starters at this point, team brass isn’t certain there is a upgrade to be had at a reasonable cost.
The Mets view another reliever as more easily attainable and are monitoring options that include the Angels’ Joe Smith, the Braves’ Chris Withrow and possibly Brewers closer Jeremy Jeffress — who would cost the Mets significantly in terms of players needed to make a deal.
Arizona has made no secret that Tyler Clippard can be had, but the Mets are unlikely to seek a reunion given that the veteran righty is signed through 2017
