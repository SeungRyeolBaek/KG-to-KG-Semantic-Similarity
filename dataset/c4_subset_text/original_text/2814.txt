The HomePod isn't a large device, but it's heavy. Which makes sense given the audio components crammed into the cylinder. It's got  a single, circular woofer to deliver bass tones and seven tweeters for the midrange and high-frequency sounds.
First released in February, the smart speaker didn't come to Canada until June 18. It's available for $449 in either Space Grey or White, and although that price might seem high, it's actually reasonable when you look at the cost of competitors.
The Sonos Play:3 is $329 and the Google Max is $499. Amazon's larger Echo is only $130 regularly priced, but I'm not even sure the Echo is in the same category as the HomePod.
Apple decided long ago to focus on the experience of music as a driver of its products. And while the HomePod was a bit slow in coming to the smart-speaker category, it delivers on that experience.
The HomePod delivers the best sound of them all. To my ears, Sonos speakers come close, but the Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers are inferior.
