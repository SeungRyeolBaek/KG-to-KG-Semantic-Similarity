Watch as the Metro Maple Leafs receive a personal message from @smithpelly23 and @JohnCarlson74 inviting them to Monday's game. 
A minor hockey team that stood up for one of its players after he was the subject of racist taunts got a surprise from the Washington Capitals on Wednesday.
The Capitals sent the Metro Maple Leafs a video of forward Devante Smith-Pelly and defenseman John Carlson inviting them to Washington's game against the St. Louis Blues on Jan. 14.
Divyne Apollon II, a 13-year-old blue-liner on the 14-and-under club based in Odenton, Md., was subjected to taunts from an opposing team at a tournament in December, according to NHL.com's Tom Gulitti.
His teammates fought the opponents at the end of the game in response to the taunts. After Apollon was suspended for the rest of the tournament for his part in the melee, the team placed logos on their sticks with the word "Racism" crossed out by a hockey stick.
