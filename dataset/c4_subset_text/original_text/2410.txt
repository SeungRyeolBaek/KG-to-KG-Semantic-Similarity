Google announced the other day that it has added Blogger and Google+ Pages to Google Takeout, meaning that users can more easily export their data  out of these services if they would like to leave.
Meet us at https://www.google.com/takeout, and together we will export each of your blogs as an Atom Xml file. Or, if you’ve enjoyed exporting data from your Google+ Stream and Google+ Circles through Takeout in the past, but are looking for something more, join us now and download html files with your posts and json files containing the circles for each Google+ Page you own. If you don’t want to rush into things, we can also just export a single blog or page of your choice. Either way, give us a try. Life will never be the same.
A couple months ago, Google added some new features to Google Takeout, enabling users to maintain their original folder hierarchy when exporting files from Google Drive, and letting users pick a single resource within a service to download.
Google also recently added Reader and Latitude data to the Google Takeout
