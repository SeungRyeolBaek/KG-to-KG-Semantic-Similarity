The chief of his own faction of Pakistan Muslim League, Nawaz Sharif on Monday lashed out at PML-Q for supporting Pervez Mushar raf in the past, describing their politics as ‘hypocrisy’.
“No one has forgotten that yesterday they were ready to elect Muhsarraf even 20 times in his uniform and now sitting in coalition with those issuing red warrants against the dictator,” the PML-N chief, without naming, criticized Choudhry brothers which legitimized the former dictator’s rule after winning 2002 elections.
“The politics of hypocrisy should come to an end now. They (PML-Q) had termed PPP as foes, but now sitting under the ruling party’s shelter for their own interests,” Nawaz alleged while addressing party’s General Council at Awan-e-Iqbal.
On Sunday, PML-N president Sharif demanded an apology from Chaudhry brothers to the nation for supporting a dictator, saying the PML-N is ready to shake hands with the Chaudhrys
