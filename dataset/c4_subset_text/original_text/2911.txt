The New York Red Bulls and New York City FC will meet twice in 2019.
The New York Red Bulls, New York City FC and the  rest of Major League Soccer announced their 2019 schedules on Monday.
The rivals will meet twice this season, first at Red Bull Arena on July 14 and again at Yankee Stadium on Aug. 24. The addition of FC Cincinnati as the league's 24th team means that no teams, not even division opponents, will meet three times.
The Red Bulls open the season on the road in Columbus on March 2 and play their first home game on March 16 against San Jose.
NYCFC opens the season on the road at Orlando City on March 2 and plays its first home game on March 10 against DC United.
Both teams will host defending champion Atlanta United. The Red Bulls, who lost to Atlanta in the Eastern Conference finals last season, host the defending champions on May 19 in one of the team's 13 nationally-televised games. NYCFC hosts Atlanta on Sept. 25.
