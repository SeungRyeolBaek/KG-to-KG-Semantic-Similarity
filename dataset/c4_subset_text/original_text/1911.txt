Donald Trump attacked the Clintons on Thursday over the latest blockbuster hacked email released by WikiLeaks, which details how a close Bill Clinton aide helped rake in tens  of millions for the former president while his wife was serving as secretary of state.
Doug Band sent the 12-page memo in 2011 to Bill Clinton, his daughter Chelsea, several Clinton Foundation board members and lawyers, and'special adviser' John Podesta – whose email was hacked and who is now Hillary Clinton's campaign manager.
'Just today we read about Clinton confidant Doug Band bragging that he had funnelled tens of millions of dollars to "Bill Clinton, Inc." through the Foundation donations, paid speeches and consulting contracts,' Trump said in a farm animal expo center in rural Springfield, Ohio.
Trump, cheered on by a crowd estimated at 7,000 people, blasted Hillary Clinton as the new figurehead leading what amounts to an organized crime family.
'The more emails WikiLeaks releases, the more lines between the Clinton Foundation, the secretary of state's office and the Clintons' personal finances – they all get blurred,’ the Republican presidential nominee said.
