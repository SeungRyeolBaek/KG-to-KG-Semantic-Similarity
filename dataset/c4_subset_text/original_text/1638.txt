Brea police on Monday were working to identify the person who hid a small camera in a Starbucks bathroom.
Brea police say they found a  tiny camera under a shelf in a Starbucks restroom. They tweeted out a photo of where the discovery was made.
The video recorder, which was about the size of a large pen, was mounted under a shelf in the restroom of the Starbucks located at 101 W. Imperial Highway (map), the Brea Police Department tweeted on Monday.
According to a news release from the department, a woman was using the restroom when she found the device. She removed the item and alerted police, who were initially unsure if the item was a camera.
Later, an Orange County Regional Computer Forensic Laboratory examined the device and determined it was a miniature video camera, the release stated.
An undisclosed number of people were recorded on the device, and an in-depth examination would be conducted to identify potential victims as well as the person who placed the camera in the bathroom, according to the release.
