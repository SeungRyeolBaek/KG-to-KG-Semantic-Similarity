It's April 16, 2000. The second day of another NFL draft is underway. The quarterback prospects plucked so far include Chris Redman and  Giovanni Carmazzi in the third round, Tee Martin in the fifth, and Spergon Wynn in the early sixth. Who? Precisely. But I'll bet you've heard the name of the quarterback who every NFL team passed on at least five times: Tom Brady.
More than half of all players selected before Brady are no longer playing in the league. How could this happen? How could all the sage football minds representing each NFL team overlook a player like Tom Brady, a three-time Super Bowl winner and two-time Super Bowl MVP?
This sort of thing happens every year in the NFL draft, and at every position. If you're lucky, your team finds the next Tom Brady. But if your team passes on a guy who turns out to be a Hall of Famer and instead selects a player who becomes a mediocre journeyman, its glaring lack of omniscience will never be forgotten, or forgiven. And no clich√© about hindsight will appease angry fans.
