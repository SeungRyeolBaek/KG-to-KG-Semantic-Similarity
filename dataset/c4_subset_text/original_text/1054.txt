TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn is back in the Tokyo detention center where he previously spent 108 days,  after being released just last month on a $9 million bail.
His former employers, Japan’s Nissan and France’s Renault, initially appeared to be at odds over his case when he was first arrested in November, but now seem to have closed ranks against him.
Ghosn was arrested again on suspicion of funneling $5 million from payments made by a Nissan subsidiary to a third party for personal gain. An internal Nissan investigation has identified the party as a Nissan distributor in Oman.
He is already fighting charges of under-reporting his Nissan salary for nearly a decade through 2018, and a charge of temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan’s books during the global financial crisis around 2008.
Renault too is investigating payments it made under Ghosn’s watch to the same company in Oman. The outcome of that probe could deepen the French automaker’s exposure to the scandal, which so far has been largely focused on Nissan.
