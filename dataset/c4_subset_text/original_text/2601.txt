Google Incentivizing Ad Partners To Use Automation; Is That Good?
Kirk Williams posted on Twitter that he got an email from  Google with new rewards and incentives if he uses more of Google's ad automation features. He said he doesn't have an issue with automation but the incentives should be tied to client goals, not using a feature in Google Ads which may or may not result in positive outcomes for your client goals.
Kirk said "Anyone seen the new Google Partners store? Theyâ€™re now incentivizing agencies to turn on things like more Search or GDN automation in accounts by rewarding them with points to win sweatshirts and mini-fridges. Not, you know, hitting or exceeding client goals."
BTW, I'm not remotely against automation used well.
He wrote this up in detail at Marketing Land and listed these specific "challenges" where you earn incentives within Google. Audience challenge, Search automation, Display automation, Non-last click adoption, Host a live stream event, Participate in a training, Team certifications and specializations.
Again, it is nice to see
