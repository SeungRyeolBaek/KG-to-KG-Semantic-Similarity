NEW YORK – The Boy Scouts of America’s blanket ban on gay adult leaders could end Monday when a top policy-making board plans to vote. Church-sponsored Scout units, however, could be allowed to maintain the exclusion.
The new policy, aimed at easing a controversy that has embroiled the Boy Scouts for decades, would take effect immediately if approved by the organization’s 80-member National Executive Board. Its members were convening for a closed-to-the-media meeting conducted by teleconference.
The stage was set for Monday’s vote back in May, when the BSA’s president, former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, told the Scouts’ annual national meeting that that the long-standing ban on participation by openly gay adults was no longer sustainable. He said the ban was likely to be targeted by lawsuits that the Scouts were apt to lose.
