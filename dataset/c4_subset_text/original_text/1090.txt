Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has floated an idea to get comprehensive immigration reform passed in the U.S. House.
 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he floated an idea Tuesday in Las Vegas to get comprehensive immigration reform passed in the U.S. House this year.
So far, House Speaker John Boehner has refused to take a vote on it, Reid said.
Reid said the deadline to act is Aug. 1, before Congress takes its end-of-summer break.
“Boehner says the reason they (U.S. House members) won’t pass immigration reform is because he doesn’t trust the President,” Reid said in the telephone conversation.
President Obama's second four-year term ends in late January of 2017.
Reid said it was a workable compromise with Boehner and others in the GOP.

Reid said it was the second time he’s floated
