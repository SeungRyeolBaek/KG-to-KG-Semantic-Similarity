The property market in Taipei has not seen new large luxury home projects so far this year as developers shun such products, which remain a tough sell  despite a recovery in property transactions, the Chinese-language Housing Monthly (住展雜誌) has reported.
The magazine defines luxury homes as apartments larger than 100 ping (330m2) that appeal to wealthy buyers.
Luxury projects — which last year totaled NT$85 billion (US$2.75 billion at the current exchange rate), the highest since a peak in 2013 — were nowhere to be found in the first quarter of this year and the situation might persist through the rest of the year if Taozhu Garden (陶朱隱園) in the Xinyi District (信義) does not join the market, Housing Monthly research manager Ho Shih-chang (何世昌) said.
Luxury home projects approached NT$90 billion in 2013, but plunged to NT$35 billion in 2014 following a spate of government measures to cool the property market, Ho said
