Dallas Cowboys legend Tony Dorsett is starring in a new Dallas Police Association campaign that aims to thank police officers.
The Hall-of- Fame running back is featured in a public service announcement alongside much less famous local business people (and a kid). The 30-second spot (posted below) and the website 33thanks.com directs people to the Assist the Officer Foundation, which aids cops and former cops in need, and the families of officers killed in the line of duty.
"I'm a real stickler about little things make big things happen," Dorsett said Tuesday. "And just for a little thing like that to say, 'hey, thank you' -- that goes a long way."
Dallas Police Association President Ron Pinkston said he was "incredibly grateful" to have Dorsett's help.
Dorsett spoke Tuesday to The Dallas Morning News about the campaign.
