Michele Cox of Howell celebrated her 50th birthday by running 50 miles in the Chicago Lakefront 50/50, her 50th race of  the year.
Michele Cox celebrated her 50th birthday just over a week ago by running 50 miles.
The milestone was also the 50th race in a year marking a half-century of life.
The night before the Chicago Lakefront 50/50 Ultramarathon, Cox didn’t sleep well at her father’s nearby home, afraid she wouldn’t hear the alarm and miss the race — the one race she could not miss, with no others to make up for it before her birthday.
She made it to the starting line, joined by about 55 runners on the dark, cold, windy morning — with a temperature of 33 degrees, about 27 or 28 degrees with wind chill.
Cox was dressed for the weather with hat, gloves and socks and shirt made of “smart wool,” but the real preparation for the race, an out and back course in which she would complete four loops of 12.5 miles each
