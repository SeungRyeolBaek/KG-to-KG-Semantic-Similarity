A hoax Facebook virus is spreading rapidly across the social network.
Many users have been hoodwinked into forwarding an inaccurate warning about the spread  of non-existent malware that claims a girl committed suicide over a post her father wrote on her Facebook wall.
No such tragedy has occurred but many are forwarding the wrong-headed message (extract below) creating confusion in the process.
People are passing on the warning in the mistaken belief they are helping Facebook friends to avoid a threat. In reality, they are spreading a hoax about a non-existent virus infection. The bogus warning is arguably causing more of a nuisance than a genuine malware infection, according to net security firm Sophos.
It adds that miscreants have exploited the confusion created by the warning by establishing Facebook pages that supposedly offer pictures from the fictitious girl's Facebook wall, but are really designed to make money by tricking surfers into wasting their time completing online surveys of dubious merit.
Malware hoaxes were part and parcel of net life long before the advent of social networking. Surfers are advised to check out warnings with reputable sources before spreading them along.
