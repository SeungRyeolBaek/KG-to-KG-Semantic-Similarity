BILLINGS — Prep soccer season came to an end for Great Falls High school Friday with Billings Senior’s 2-0 victory over the  Bison girls’ team in a state tournament play-in game.
It would have been the GFH girls’ first trip to the state tournament in more than 10 years.
Both the third-seeded Broncs’ goals came off the foot of Bailey Woodring. Woodring rang the first home on a long shot in the 29th minute; the second came shortly after the half on a penalty kick in the 42nd minute.
“One of their goals was a questionable penalty kick, and that didn’t help,” Smith said.
GFH rallied for some late scoring chances but weren’t able to punch the ball through. Sarah Conway made eight saves in the Bison goal.
The Bison finish the season with a 3-11 record but were the last to fall of the four Great Falls prep teams. GFH beat Butte High 4-0 on Tuesday with its best performance of the season to advance to the second
