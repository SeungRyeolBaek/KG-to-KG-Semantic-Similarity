(CBS) Do the diagnostic tests doctors use to detect breast cancer actually cause cancer?
That's the shocking finding of a new study of some  of the newest, most sophisticated imaging techniques, including breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) and positron emission tomography (PEM).
While the new techniques can be very helpful in diagnosing some tricky cases of breast cancer, they involve the injection of radioactive material, which increase the risk of developing cancer.
Just how risky are the new procedures?
"A single breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) or positron emission mammography (PEM) examination carries a lifetime risk of inducing fatal cancer greater than or comparable to a lifetime of annual screening mammography starting at age 40," the study's author, Dr. R. Edward Hendrick, clinical professor of radiology at the University of Colorado-Denver, School of Medicine in Aurora, said in a written statement.
Dr. Hendrick reviewed recent studies on radiation doses from procedures that involve radioactive material to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer and death.
It's no secret that digital mammography,
