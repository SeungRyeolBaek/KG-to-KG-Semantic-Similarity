Like a sweater stretched too often by wide shoulders, space-time can be permanently warped by the gravitational waves that constantly ripple through it. This distortion , called gravitational wave memory, could allow us to detect waves previously beyond our reach – even if we can’t see the event that caused them.
This offers hope that we may be able to find some of the universe’s most exotic objects.
Gravitational waves are created by massive objects moving through space-time. In 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) first detected a gravitational wave caused by two black holes spiralling towards one another and merging. Since then, theorists have been hard at work figuring out what such waves from other events and objects would look like.
Some of the most exotic objects in physics, such as evaporating black holes, cosmic strings and even possible extra dimensions, would induce gravitational waves at much higher frequencies than we can currently detect.
But there is still hope that these elusive objects could leave a detectable signal, say Lucy McNeill and her colleagues Eric Thrane and Paul Lasky at Mon
