IBM on Wednesday will  roll out its first new Netezza appliance since acquiring the data warehousing player late last year.
The IBM Netezza High Capacity Appliance is designed to allow companies to analyze up to 10 petabytes in a few minutes. With the new appliance, IBM is looking to make analysis of so-called big data sets more affordable, said Steve Mills, senior vice president and group executive of software and systems at IBM.
Mills noted that the latest Netezza appliance is optimized for IBM's BladeCenter technology and is part of a broader portfolio focused on big data projects. IBM also has its BigInsights software, based on Hadoop, and its Streams application. The software is designed to analyze unstructured data on the fly.
The big pitch for Netezza is the price per user per terabyte. Mills said the Netezza appliance will run about $2,500 per user per terabye compared to an average of $10,000. "
