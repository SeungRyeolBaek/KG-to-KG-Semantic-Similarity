Responding to every bit of Russian propaganda "is counterproductive, because it is reactive and you are always behind the curve,” Deputy Assistant Secretary  of State Benjamin Ziff tells senators in Washington, Nov. 3, 2015.
When a Russian news outlet edited the U.S. ambassador into a picture of an opposition rally, the U.S. Embassy countered by editing the ambassador into a series of improbable photos — for instance, on the moon and at an ice hockey rink.
The idea was to show that the original photo was propaganda, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Benjamin Ziff told a Senate subcommittee in Washington on Tuesday.
The ploy worked. “This tweet was retweeted extensively within Russia,” he said.
Modern Russian propaganda is no longer concerned with censorship. Rather, it is widespread and prolific, filling up the media space to such an extent that people sometimes can’t tell what is right and what is not.
Ziff said the Russians have “a sophisticated $1.4 billion-a-year propaganda apparatus.” They claim to reach 600 million people across 130 countries.
