Geneva: Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev and his ex-wife Elena on Tuesday announced they had reached a deal to settle their divorce,  which had been dubbed the costliest break-up of all time.
In May, 2014, a Swiss court awarded Elena Rybolovlev over four billion Swiss francs ($4.2 billion, 3.6 billion euros) -- the equivalent of half his fortune, in their divorce, which at the time was dubbed the divorce of the century.
On Tuesday the pair said in a joint statement that they had "reached an agreement on the terms of the divorce" in a move they said "puts an end to all legal procedures launched in different jurisdictions.".
The statement did not specify the amount agreed upon.
The agreement came after a Geneva appeals court in June overturned the 2014 ruling, downgrading the payment required from the owner of French football club AS Monaco to 564 million Swiss francs, along with two real estate holdings.
