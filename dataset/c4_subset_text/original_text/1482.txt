You can take part of the beach home with you.
Many home decorators, whether they live on the coast or reside miles from the shore , take inspiration from the beach's sand and sea. You can capture the essence of a trip to the seashore by bringing some of the beach into your own home. Sand, stones, seashells and other beach staples make naturally beautiful decorations. If you've got a collection of rocks and sand, show it off to family and friends by displaying it in a clear vase.
Layer the bottom of a clear vase with sand or craft moss, then fill the vase with stones of various shapes and sizes. If you're giving this as a gift, use smooth, light-colored stones. On each stone, write a happy memory you've shared with the gift recipient. You can also do this at weddings and parties. Lay the stones on a table and have each guest write a message on one with a permanent marker. When they're done, have them put the stones in the vase. This makes a lovely keepsake for couples or the party's guest of honor.
