Samsung's Notebook 9 Pen is a nice example of the company taking what works on the smartphone and bringing it to a larger screen. But Samsung  also misses opportunities to connect its broader product roadmap to its laptops.
Samsung has powered-up its Smart TV experience with a 'One Remote' control and an upgraded voice recognition feature that will allow consumers to use smart features more smartly, says its development team.
Samsung latest laptop lineup led by the Notebook 9 Pen is notable, but misses key opportunities on multiple fronts to provide connective tissue between its products and services.
The reviews of the Notebook 9 Pen are in, and most tout Samsung's use of the S Pen stylus as a bridge to the Galaxy Note 8, but they also gripe about the overall design.
The Good: The Samsung Notebook 9 Pen is extremely light but powerful, has plenty of ports, multiple biometric security features and includes Samsung's excellent S Pen stylus.
The Bad: Especially for a premium-priced laptop, the design is bland. Battery life is merely OK. The stylus feels better suited for a small phone screen
