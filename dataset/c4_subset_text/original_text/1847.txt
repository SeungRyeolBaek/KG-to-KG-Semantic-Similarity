Back in 1777, when the ink was scarcely dry on the Declaration of Independence, Morocco became the first nation to recognize the United States, and  a treaty of peace and friendship between the two countries was signed by Sultan Sidi Mohammed III in 1786 and approved by Congress in 1787. The State Department says this is the longest unbroken treaty relationship in the nation's history.
With the bicentennial of that treaty fast approaching, King Hassan II of Morocco has made known his desire to give an appropriate monument to the American people, to be dedicated, if all goes well, in 1987. Before that can happen, however, Congress must approve the project and its location on Federal property, and the first move in that direction will be taken this morning when the House Task Force on Libraries and Memorials conducts a hearing on the enabling legislation.
Several favorable witnesses will testify, and no opposition to the bill has been detected as yet. President Reagan has notified King Hassan that he will sign the measure when it reaches the White House, as is expected.
No one knows yet where the monument will be situated or what it will look like,
