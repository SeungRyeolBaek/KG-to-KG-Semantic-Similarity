If you think the Jack Tar was the only big hotel in downtown Orange, you would be wrong. Before the Jack Tar, the city had the  Holland Hotel, which was on the corner of Division and Fifth streets, across from where the Jack Tar was later built.
The Holland Hotel opened on Nov.1, 1902. It burned about 1955 and was then demolished. The lot has stayed empty, though it served as the parking lot for the Jack Tar for many years. The City of Orange now has plans to build a new Senior Citizen Center/Meals on Wheels building on the site of the old Holland Hotel. The development is part of the downtown master plan.
Orange had other hotels when the Holland was built, but the other inns werenâ€™t fancy enough for the wealthy people in the lumber industry who lived in Orange and were contributing to culture. So some leading citizens invested in the venture to get a first-class hotel for visitors and for gatherings.
The Orange Opera House was at the northwest corner of Division and Sixth streets. It was built by Frances Ann Lutcher, the wife of Henry Jacob Lutcher
