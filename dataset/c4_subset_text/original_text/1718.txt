What makes a Hollywood franchise a hit in China? Walt Disney needs to know.
Disney has unleashed a marketing campaign in China to sell "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" when the latest in the nearly 40-year-old movie franchise comes to the world's No. 2 movie market on Jan. 9. The campaign is aimed at an audience that largely missed the "Stars Wars" phenomenon and has trouble telling Jabba the Hutt from Jar-Jar Binks.
The good news is that whiz-bang science-fiction stories with lots of special effects do well in China. Still, not every franchise translates to the country's increasingly discerning audience.
