BELLVILLE — Law enforcement officials are still trying to figure out why a man opened fire on another man late Sunday morning in a Delaware, Ohio  rest area, severely injuring the man, and then took off north on Interstate 71, where he crashed his vehicle and died, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
As of Monday night, the gunman’s victim, Alexander Melchert, a freshman at the College of Wooster, remained in critical condition at a Columbus hospital.
The suspect in the shooting, Shawn A. Johnson, 25, of Westerville, was being chased by troopers on I-71 when he apparently lost control of his vehicle after, running over some road spikes placed across I-71, and crashed into a guardrail.
Troopers reportedly surrounded the man in the crashed vehicle, and after not hearing anything from him, approached the vehicle and discovered Johnson dead, reportedly of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead shortly after 3 p.m.
The alleged shooting occurred in an I-71 rest area in Delaware County shortly after 11 a.m. According to the
