LONDON—Prince William and Prince Harry joined the cast of Star Wars: The Last Jedi at the film’s European premiere Tuesday, delight ing fans who braved the London cold for a glimpse of Hollywood stars and British royalty.
But cast and crew were silent on reports that the royal siblings make a cameo appearance in the much-anticipated film.
The tuxedo-clad princes walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Albert Hall for the black-tie gala, a benefit for their Royal Foundation charity — though without William’s pregnant wife Kate or Harry’s fiancée, Meghan Markle.
Royal officials have refused to comment on reports that the princes recorded a scene playing Stormtroopers in the sci-fi saga when they visited the film’s set in April 2016. At the time they were filmed meeting crew members, battling with light sabers and hugging a Wookie.
Star John Boyega has said the royal duo filmed a scene during their visit to London’s Pinewood Studios, though it’s unclear whether it made the final cut.
