Jurassic World's sketchy science: How impossible would it be to splice dinosaur DNA with other animals'?
How Impossible, Actually,  Is the Dinosaur DNA Splicing in Jurassic World?
The Indominus rex is part raptor, part cuttlefish, part God knows what else.
So now what? To restore a sense of wonder to the jaded masses, we’re going to need something bigger, better, and altogether grander: a dinosaur that can transcend the pesky laws of nature. Armed with test tubes and hubris, scientists set out to design their own, tricking out the T-Rex genome with strands of cuttlefish and tree frog DNA to create a custom-made methuselah: the Indominus rex. After all, why mimic Mother Nature when you can outdo her?
Clearly, there’s a lot here to set off your scientific BS radar. But just how implausible is it to think that we could engineer a mega-creature out of a patchwork of different animals’ DNA?
First off, the idea of designing
