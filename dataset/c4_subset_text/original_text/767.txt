Instagram accounts for 8% of social media posts about fall TV but 70% of the engagement, according to a new report by Nielsen via its  Social Content Ratings service.
As social media continues to grow in importance as a tool for building awareness for TV shows, networks are looking for the best ways to deploy resources across social platforms. Nielsen is increasing its capabilities for measuring what it calls Owned Content Performance across social media.
As evidence of the need, the company sifted through social data from a three-week period ahead of the fall TV season. The total added up to 142,000 pieces of content on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram generating more than 154 million engagements (likes, comments, re-posts, etc.).
