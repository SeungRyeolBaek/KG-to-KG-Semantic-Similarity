MUZAFFARGARH, Pakistan (AFP) - A Muslim teacher in Pakistan could face the death penalty after being accused of blasphemy,  sparking anger from school officials and activists who said the law is being abused to carry out personal vendettas.
Arabic teacher Gibreel Ahmed was arrested at a government school in southern Punjab province on May 14 after allegedly beating two brothers in the sixth grade for not coming to class on time. The students' parents complained to the Government High School Gurmani in Muzaffargarh district, whose head told AFP the 40-year-old teacher had been suspended after an inquiry.
But four days after the original complaint, the parents went to the police to accuse Ahmed of blasphemy, according to the local authorities. The school said no mention of blasphemy had been made before the police complaint.
Blasphemy is a hugely sensitive issue in conservative Muslim Pakistan, where even unproven allegations can stir beatings and mob violence.
Rights groups have said the laws are routinely abused to seek vengeance.
