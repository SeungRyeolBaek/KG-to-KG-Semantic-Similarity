No surprise that islander John Norby is on  TV. Sue Frause photo.
Being a TV star hasn’t changed John Norby one iota.
OK, star may be a bit of a stretch. But John does appear on a TV commercial here in the Pacific Northwest and there are more coming up.
“I’m a Norske flogging tacos!” laughed John, stomping his feet in delight.
John and I are having late afternoon tea at Useless Bay Coffee in Langley.
The 61-year-old islander, who moved to Whidbey in 1969, admits his new “career” is something of a surprise.
“I’ve never done any acting,” said John, whose long resume includes cheese factory worker, carpenter, merchant marine, machinist and shipwright to name a few. He’s been in unions since he was 17 years old and is currently employed by the Washington State Ferries
