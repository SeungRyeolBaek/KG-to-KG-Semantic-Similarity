Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido is trying to get millions of dollars in humanitarian aid into his country despite a blockade from disputed President Nicolas  Maduro; State Department correspondent Rich Edson reports.
The U.S. government says it will position 190 metric tons of supplies by Friday, ready to deploy throughout Venezuela, according to Mark Green, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).
The problem is figuring out how to get that aid into Venezuela.
Pallets of food, medicine and hygiene kits are in neighboring Colombia and warehouses throughout the region.
Contested Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is blocking international aid, calling it an American attempt to overthrow his government.
"This not an earthquake. This is not a hurricane. This is not a tornado or a flood,” Green said. “This is one man and one regime imposing dictatorial rule, imposing suffering and pain on people."
