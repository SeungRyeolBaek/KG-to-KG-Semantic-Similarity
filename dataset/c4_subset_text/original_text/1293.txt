Against teams that are.500 or above, the Sox are 18-12.
Below.500 squads, the record is just 9-19 .
What gives? It’s the proverbial “playing to the level your competition” cliche.
Maybe it’s the fact that a lot of these bad teams are filled with young pitchers that no one has any tape on, and the Sox consequently struggle against them? Do the home/road splits make a difference? And will that even itself out and eradicate the statistical anomaly.
An even more telling statistic is the Sox 10-13 at home record (just terrible, yes I know) versus 17-18 on the road. That will have to change now as the Sox have the next 16/22 at home. And between now and the All-Star break they’ll only be outside Chicago for nine days. And they’re certainly due- as the Sox have had more road games than any team in baseball up to this point.
But the best nugget of hope is not in their home/road or over/under.500
