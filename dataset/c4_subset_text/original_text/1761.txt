THE US has clamped down on two Chinese shipping companies accused of helping North Korea dodge sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons programme in a move which risks  enraging leaders in Beijing and Pyongyang.
The crackdown comes as North Korean officials threaten to resume nuclear testing after talks between leader Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump collapsed before any agreement was reached. Washington said shipping giants Dalian Haibo International Freight and Liaoning Danxing International Forwarding were now banned from dealing with US companies and confirmed any US assets held by the companies would be frozen.
The US Treasury Department also issued an updated advisory listing 67 ships allegedly engaged in illicit transfers of refined petroleum with North Korean tankers or were believed to have exported North Korean coal.
It said Liaoning Danxing had "routinely used deceptive practices" to enable the work of North Korean procurement officials based in the European Union.
Evasion tactics employed by North Korea included disabling or manipulating automated identification systems, physically altering vessels, transferring cargoes between ships and falsifying cargo documentation.
Ports visited by vessels involved in ship-to-ship transfers included those in Taiwan,
