(Reuters) - Canadian Corey Conners clinched an astonishing two-shot victory over American Charley Hoffman at the Texas Open on Sunday to punch  the final ticket to the Masters.

“It just doesn’t seem real,” Conners told reporters after finishing at 20-under 268 to secure his second shot at the Masters after playing as an amateur in 2015.
Hoffman birdied the par-five 18th to shoot 67 and claim second place, a shot ahead of fellow American Ryan Moore (64).
