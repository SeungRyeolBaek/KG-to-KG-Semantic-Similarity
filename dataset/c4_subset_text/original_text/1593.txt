A chef familiar to the culinary team at Kevin Gillespie’s restaurant Gunshow has been tapped to helm the eatery’s kitchen. 
Chris McCord, who has served as sous chef at Gunshow since 2015, will take over as chef de cuisine after executive chef Joey Ward’s departs to open his own concept in Poncey-Highland on Feb. 9.
Before that, McCord worked at French restaurant F&B in Buckhead, and the now-shuttered Ink & Elm in Emory Village and The Globe in Midtown. He attended culinary school at the Art Institute of Atlanta, where he was a year behind Gillespie.
As chef de cuisine, McCord will the responsible for the back of house operations and the menu, and a new general manager will run the front of the house operations. The restaurant will no longer use the executive chef title, according to Gillespie.
Gunshow has racked up plenty of accolades since it opened in 2013 in Glenwood Park, including being named to Esquire’s list of Best New Restaurants and the National Eater 38. Gillespie
