A social media user who turned to Twitter for help in writing an essay on The Handmaid's Tale has received invaluable insight â€” from none other than  author Margaret Atwood herself.
A Twitter user identified online as Momchil Gavrilov tweeted at the Canlit giant early Thursday morning with the plea: "My crazy English teacher is making us write essays on #TheHandmaidsTale where we are supposed to answer why @MargaretAtwood put the theme of power and control in the book," they write from an account with the handle @GavrilovMomchil.
"Because it's in the world," Atwood says in a tweet posted at about 5 a.m. ET Thursday.
"It's not just women who are controlled in the book. It's everyone except those at the top. Gilead is a theocratic totalitarianism, not simply a men-have-power women-do-not world. Lower-status men are told when and who (to) marry, eg."
The detailed response delighted online onlookers, who had retweeted the exchange hundreds of times and
