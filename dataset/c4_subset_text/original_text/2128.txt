If you Google images of "Elle Magazine Covers," you'll finds lots of covers featuring skinny women wearing tight outfits or low-cut dresses , showing lots of skin. In fact, you'll have a hard time finding anything else.
So when Elle magazine offered the cover to Melissa McCarthy (The Heat, Bridesmaids) for its "The Women in Hollywood" issue, many were happy to see a bigger woman finally chosen for the cover. But now that the magazine has unveiled a look at it, we see that the actress is wearing a heavy coat that's covering almost every inch of her.
Critics immediately attacked Elle for their wardrobe decision, but the magazine says that McCarthy had lots of input into what she would be wearing. "Melissa loved this look, and is gorgeous on our cover," said Elle.
Take a look at the cover below and let us know if the magazine should be ashamed for covering up McCarthy.
They should be ashamed for putting her on the cover. Period!
I can't f*cking stand this unfunny irl Miss Piggy, she's terrible.
