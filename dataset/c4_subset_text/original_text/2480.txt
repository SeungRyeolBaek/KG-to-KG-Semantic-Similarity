It is next to impossible to produce an experimental film in Pakistan, mainly because the distributors do not support the venture unless it comprises of a star- studded cast.
Director Farhan Alam and Kalakar Films deserve appreciation for breaking barriers with their new film, Saawan. The film is written by Mashood Qadri and features Syed Karam Hussain, Imran Aslam, Najiba Faiz and Saleem Mairaj in pivotal roles.
The film revolves around Saawan (Syed Karam Hussain), a physically challenged young boy who suffers from polio and lives in a valley in Balochistan. His father is frustrated, depressed and hopeless because of his son’s disability and does not treat him well. Thus, Saawan’s parents abandon him and move to the city because of a certain life-threatening situation. Despite his disability and abandonment, Saawan heads out to search for his family and uncovers various hidden truths about his life.
We can easily divide the film between its hits and misses.
