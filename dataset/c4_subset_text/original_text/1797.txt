(CN) – Japan’s already-endangered orchid populations faces a new threat from a type of seed-eating fly, according  to a new study.
There are thousands of varieties of the highly coveted and colorful orchids, some of the most diverse flowers on the planet.
In Japan, more than 70 percent of native orchids are endangered due to a number of factors like overharvesting and development.
While the endangered plants can be reproduced through cloning, scientists say reproduction through seeds is better for genetic diversity.
If the plants can’t reproduce with their seeds they face even bigger threats, scientists believe.
A new study by a team of Japanese researchers identified a type of fly that feeds on orchid seeds in five varieties of the flower. Their findings were published in the journal Ecology.
The fly, Japanagromyza tokunagai, lays its eggs inside the young fruit of blooming orchids. When they hatch, the flies make a hole in the fruit.
Because the orchid fruit grows to the same size as fruit without the flies, scientists may have
