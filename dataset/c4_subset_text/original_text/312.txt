TEN couples in Cagayan de Oro City finally tied the knot in front of the altar last Saturday, March 23, during the mass wedding  rites held at St. Augustine Cathedral, this city.
The mass wedding, according to the Oro Citizen’s and Wellness Center, is part of the aftercare activity of the Community Based Rehabilitation Program (CBRP) implemented through the City Anti-Drug Abuse Council (CADAC), as some of the grooms and family members of the newly-wedded couples are graduates of the said program.
“Part kini sya sa atong Community Based Rehabilitation Program nga dili lang hisgutanan nga rehabilitate sila diha sa drug addiction but gusto sad nato nga mai-strengthen ang family ties sa mga magtiayon,” City Administrator Teodoro Sabuga-a Jr. said.
The city government and the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro sponsored the expenses used to process the couples’ requirements, their marriage certificates and the wedding rings.
