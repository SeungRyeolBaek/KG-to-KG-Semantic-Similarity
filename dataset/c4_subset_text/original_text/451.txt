Heavy rain hammered Connecticut during Monday morning’s commute, causing spinouts and a roof collapse, while wind and flooding may lie ahead.
 The sun was shining brightly in Hartford by late morning, only to give way to more rain early in the afternoon. A flood warning for the Connecticut River in Hartford and Middlesex counties is in effect. The river is expected to exceed flood stage Tuesday in Hartford, the Thompsonville section of Enfield and in the Middle Haddam section of East Hampton.
Before dawn, water pooled on highways and torrential downpours cut visibility, causing some truckers to pull over rather than try to make their way through the driving rain.
Some crashes and spinouts were reported in the Hartford area, although it wasn’t clear if weather was a factor in all of them. One car appeared to have slid off I-91 into the center median in Windsor about 6:30 a.m., and a truck overturned on I-95 north in Stamford, causing authorities to close the highway.
Trees fell on power lines in Sherman and Goshen, closing roads, according to the state
