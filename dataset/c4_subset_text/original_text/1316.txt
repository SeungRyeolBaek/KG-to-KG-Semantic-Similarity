Heritage proponents in Southampton are upset that Bruce County intends to sell the 124-year-old former St. Paul’s Anglican rect ory intact or for salvage to make room for expansion of the adjacent Bruce County Museum Cultural Centre — and maybe something else.
The Southampton Residents’ Association issued a statement Thursday that calls on the county to instead incorporate and repurpose the old rectory at 254 High St. into “a more imaginative design” for the expansion of the museum.

Bruce County issued a request for proposals to purchase and relocate the old rectory on Jan. 8. Proposals are due Jan. 29 and the building is to be moved between April 1 and April 15.
