George and Amal Clooney have quietly  taken in a Yazidi refugee from Iraq.
In The Hollywood Reporter's cover story, Clooney reveals that he and his wife are boarding the man in a house the actor-director maintains in Augusta, Ky.
"He was on this bus to Mosul, and ISIS shot the two bus drivers and said, 'Anybody who wants to go to college, we will shoot them,' " says Clooney. "He survived and came to America. He got through all the checks, and once he got through those, it was like, 'Listen, we got your back. You want to get an education? You want to move your life forward? This is something that we can do.' "
The refugee is now a student at the University of Chicago.
Clooney has been praised for his philanthropic work, including in Sudan, a cause he picked up after reading 12 years ago about a program of ethnic cleansing that the government was carrying out in its western region, Darfur
