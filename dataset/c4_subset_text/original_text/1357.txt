Hollywood superstar Christian Slater was spotted in Glasgow filming today for his upcoming movie “The Wife”.
The A-lister,  47, was joined by co-star Glenn Close, 69, and the pair was seen shooting scenes at a former hospital in the city centre.
Close earned a Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal of Cruella de Vil in 101 Dalmatians.
But yesterday the actress was much more pooch-friendly, seen walking her dog Pip in between shooting.
Close’s four-legged friend has been treated lavishly on the trip as well, being chauffeured in a luxury people-carrier and flying in to the airport on the actress’s lap.
He even has his own Instagram account, where he’s affectionately referred to as Sir Pippin on Beanfield.
Despite her celebrated role as Dalmatians’ greatest-ever villain, Close is a well-known animal lover.
In 2007 she and her husband, David Shaw, co-founded FetchDog, an Internet catalogue of dog accessories.
