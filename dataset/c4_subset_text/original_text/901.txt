And to prove it's a world class city, Seattle traffic congestion is in the top 20 in the world.
Congratulations, Seattle and Tacoma drivers . You enjoy two of the top 16 most congested commutes in America. That's the result of the annual Global Traffic Scorecard from Kirkland-based INRIX.
Seattle drivers paid $1,853 each in 2017 for that privilege of being stuck in the city's traffic congestion while Tacoma drivers spent $1,485. And since housing prices have forced many people who work in Seattle to live in Pierce County, they are likely getting dinged twice.
Congestion cost Seattle over $5 billion in 2017, according to INRIX. Tacoma lost $2.4 billion.
Seattle also made an international mark, finishing with the 20th worst congestion among major cities around the world -- right between the Russian cities of Krasnodar and Saint Petersburg.
Portland finished 12th in the U.S. with 50 hours lost to congestion and $1,648 per driver.
Los Angeles finished No. 1 not only in the nation but the world.
