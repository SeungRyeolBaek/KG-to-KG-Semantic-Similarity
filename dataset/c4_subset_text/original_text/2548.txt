All GMGA summer 4ball pennant matches were put back by 30 minutes last Sunday due to the expected high temperature, meaning an early hit off  time of 7.15am for the Rochester players at the Hill Top Country Club in Tatura against Shepparton.
Although Rochester had won their first two matches, a heavy defeat against Numurkah last round saw them slip to equal third on the ladder and playing against a strong club like Shepparton, getting back into the top two wasn’t going to be easy.
Rochester’s number one team of James Walsh and Jake Wright played some good golf but were unable to hold off the longer handicappers and were beaten on the 18th.
Leigh Hicks and Robert Vise lost on the 16th as did Richard Feuk and Bruce Bryant.
Frank Severino and Steve Malley lost 2/1.
Peter Anderson and partner Steven Bubb came back from two down to win their 13th, 14th and 16th holes, going 1up, only to lose on the short par three to finish square at the end of the game
