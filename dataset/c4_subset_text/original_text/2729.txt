June 10, 2014 â€” Completed precinct committee write-in affidavit forms must be received by the Maricopa County Recorder's Office by no later  than 5 p.m. on Wednesday, June 11 (postmarked does not count).
After the county elections' May 28 deadline for individuals to submit their precinct committee affidavit and signature petition forms passed, county elections departments removed the precinct committee affidavit and signature petition forms from their websites, replacing them with the precinct committee affidavit for write-ins.
The form must be notarized and no signatures are required. The precinct committee write-in candidate must receive one vote during the primary election and that can be their own vote. This works in precincts that are not filled, otherwise, the write-in candidate would require more votes than the other candidates in the precinct in order to be elected.
The write-in candidate nomination form can be downloaded at http://recorder.maricopa.gov/pdf/2014%20PC%20WRITE%20IN%20Nomination%20Paper.pdf.
