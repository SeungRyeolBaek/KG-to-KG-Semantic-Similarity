SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - With the unofficial kickoff of summer comes the new, sunny destination of Destin - Ft . Walton Beach, Fla., helping boost numbers at the Springfield - Branson National Airport to record levels.
"The security lines are easy to get through and so friendly," said Susan Butts, a traveler who flies in and out of SGF on a regular basis.
The Springfield airport is now one of the fastest growing of its size nationwide, with United set to add twice-daily service to Houston in June.
"The timing was right, and they decided to drop in a couple flights a day," said airport director Brian Weiler.
Weiler said the growth amounts to about 30 percent just within the last five years.
"I think the southwest Missouri economy is doing well. People have more money to travel and they want to travel. I think that's driving a lot of the growth," Weiler said.
Weiler anticipates the airport will reach 1 million passengers this year. Going past that number will help the airport attract more options, like additional restaurants.
