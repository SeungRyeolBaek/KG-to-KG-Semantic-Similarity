NEW YORK  — President Trump on Thursday blamed the news media for the division and anger in the United States, as authorities discovered more pipe bombs intended for the president’s political rivals.
In his tweet on Thursday, Trump did not mention that CNN, the news network that he has long assailed and called “fake news,” was among the targets of a pipe bomb, along with former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden and actor Robert De Niro. Three more devices were found in Delaware and New York, the FBI said Thursday. Two were addressed to Biden, a Delaware resident, and a third to De Niro, who lives and works in Lower Manhattan.
