MANILA, Philippines — The death toll from a 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Bohol and other parts of the Visay as and Mindanao rose to 85, police said Tuesday, as more reports trickled in about toppled buildings and historic churches near the epicenter.
Bohol police chief Dennis Agustin said that over 60 of the deaths came from the province, where the quake hit near the town of Carmen. At least 16 others died in nearby Cebu province and another on Siquijor Island.
Meanwhile, in a text message to reporters, Police Officer 3 Carl John Legazpi, operations clerk of the Bohol provincial office, said that there were 62 fatalities from several towns in Bohol.
The quake struck at 8:12 a.m. and was centered about 33 kilometers (20 miles) below Carmen on Bohol Island, where many buildings collapsed, roads cracked up and bridges fell.
“We ran out of the building, and outside, we hugged trees because the tremors were so strong,” said Vilma Yorong, a provincial government employee
