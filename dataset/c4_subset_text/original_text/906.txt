Which states produce the most celebrities?
Celebrities who have achieved fame and fortune often flock to states like California or New York. What some  of us don’t know is that many A-listers were born in obscure places.
While some states produce only a handful of celebrities, people born in certain states seem to be destined for the spotlight. Using data provided by Gracenote, PrettyFamous looked at the number of celebrities per state to see where the most celebrities are from. The raw number of celebrities per state was normalized against the state’s population to determine a per capita figure. This figure represents the number of celebrities from their respective states, per 100,000 people.
These per capita figures were calculated from a subset of our data of 12,589 celebrities who have appeared in at least one television show or movie and have had their place of birth recorded in our database.
Additionally, we have identified which celebrity from each state has the most Twitter followers.
