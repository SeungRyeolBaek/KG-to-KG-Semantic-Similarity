Royal Bank of Scotland moved into profit, from a £2 billion loss, but has committed to continue major restructuring through to 2019.
Attribut able profit was £939 million in the half year ended 30 June, a significant rise from the £2 billion loss in the same period in 2016. Operating profit before tax was £1.9 billion.
The bank, which is still over 70% government owned said that it made progress dealing with legacy issues during the period. A settlement was reached with the Federal Housing Finance Agency which cost £151 million, out of the £396 million litigation and conduct costs.
Over the period it finally reached a settlement with the last remaining shareholder action group, which spared its former chief executive Fred Goodwin from having to appear in court, over a 2008 rights issue. The £25 million charge over the period took the total amount paid to investors to over £800 million.
Restructuring costs increased by £160 million to £790 million in the first half. 2017 is expected to be the last peak year of one off costs for the bank.
