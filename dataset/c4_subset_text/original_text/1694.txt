It’s been a massive 22 years since Tom Cruise first brought Mission: Impossible to the screen. That’s more than two decades  of suspending from wires, running at high speed and blowing things up. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the sixth and latest addition to the franchise – and it’s as big as they come. The film follows Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and his team of spies as they attempt to prevent a terrorist organisation from detonating a series of nuclear weapons. The twisty plot sees Hunt once again come into contact with MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and their mutual enemy Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are back as Benji and Luther, though fellow team member Brandt (Jeremy Renner) fails to make an appearance. Also returning to the franchise is Hunt’s wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) – her first appearance since a cameo in the fourth film. There are a few notable additions to the cast this time around. Angela Bassett plays Erica Sloan, head of the CIA and Vanessa Kirby plays the enigmatic White Widow,
