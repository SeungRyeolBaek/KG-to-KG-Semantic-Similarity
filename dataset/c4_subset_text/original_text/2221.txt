Online, on-demand subscription service saves companies hassle of building or customizing their own set of applications, company says.
Salesforce.com , a maker of customer relationship management software, has announced an online service designed to let companies use many applications at once--whether built in-house, by another vendor or a partner.
The on-demand subscription service--Multiforce--is meant to let customers access applications online and run them simultaneously rather than taking a client-server-software approach that calls for customers to build or customize their own set of applications.
