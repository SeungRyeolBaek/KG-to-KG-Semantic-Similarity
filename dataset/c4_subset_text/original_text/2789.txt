David Smith, head chef at Flamingo Beach Resort, is returning to the U.S. to be with his son and to take care of a rare blood disease that has become more severe in recent months. As an expression of gratitude, the community is gathering together for a bingo fundraising event to help David with moving expenses and to give him a warm send-off. The event is set for Saturday, Oct. 22, at 6 p.m. at the resort’s Salón Las Palmas. The ₡5,000 ($10) admission includes one bingo card, appetizers and natural juices. Extra cards and raffle tickets cost ₡2,000 ($4) each. Some really nice prizes are being offered. For information about the event or how you can help David, call Van at 26
