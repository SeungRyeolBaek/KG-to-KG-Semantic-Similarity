UK-based Stratajet launched its charter booking platform and accompanying app on Friday, having spent the past five years to build the software, algorithms  and data it needs to perform near-real-time quoting. To do this, the platform links into operators’ own electronic systems and collects an enormous amount of data on everything from airport and airspace charges to runway characteristics, weather and Notams.
Its booking engine, combined with a belief that the industry has been very inefficient—empty legs represent almost 40 percent of all flights in business aviation and aircraft utilization is low—attracted investment from seed funds and venture capitalists, so the company has grown rapidly over the past 15 months. It now has 50 employees, many of whom collect and analyze data and to set up operators on its system.
Stratajet founder Jonny Nicol said the complexity of the problem had been “insane” and that the company almost folded in 2014. The Stratajet system can now trawl 500 operators for availability and prices, and check all the associated airport/airway charges and constraints to give a concrete quote in less than 10 seconds.
