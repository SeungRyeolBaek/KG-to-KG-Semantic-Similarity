(Newser) â€“ More than 100 prisoners have fled a high-security facility after it was hit by shelling in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk in  eastern Ukraine, local authorities say. A jail riot was precipitated by a direct rocket hit that claimed the life of at least one inmate, says a city council spokesman, who adds that at least 10 homes, shops, and garages were hit by overnight rocketing and 20,000 people are living without electricity. Ukrainian government forces have intensified their push on Donetsk over the last week and have succeeded in surrounding it. Exchanges of rocket fire have become a daily feature of the fighting.
Ukraine asked the rebels to participate in open elections, not only did they refuse but they prevented other citizens who wished to vote from doing so. President Poroshenko asked the rebels to negotiate and they refused. He offered increased autonomy if they would stop fighting and negotiate, they refused. They confiscated citizens food, autos etc for their own use and they had no humanitarian concerns then. Now they want a cease fire so they can regroup, strengthen and hope Putin sends in troops then they will start the killing again.
