We caught up with cast members Aviva Drescher, Heather Thomson and newbie Kristen Taekman to get the scoop on this season and what we can expect to see. But not before the ladies weighed in on that insane trailer! Where is Carole swimming to?
Watch: The Real Housewives of Orange County trailer is here!
The RHONY ladies explain where their friendships are with each of the ladies in the cast and what’s to come, including some unexpected tiffs between friends you wouldn’t expect to see at odds.
