A new Yale study may help save the tigers.
Researchers from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies have come up with a form of spatial  modeling to identify the areas of the Kanha Tiger Reserve National Park where the risk of tiger attacks on livestock is highest, in the hopes of reducing farmer-tiger conflict. The study holds potential for mitigating farmers’ economic losses, but could also prove an important part of the conservation puzzle for the dwindling tiger population.
“If we can understand what kind of landscape features these cats target when they’re attacking livestock, then we can better predict where to graze, and predict where the high risk areas are,” said Jennie Miller FES ’15, the study’s lead author who conducted the research for her dissertation.
Similar statistical models have been used in past research with wolves in the United States. Though Miller’s model is based off of these, it is distinct because of the differences in large cats’ hunting patterns.
The team studied the area within 20 square meters of each kill site. Though past models have focused on larger areas
