Simon “Si” Waronker, the patriarch of the famous musical Waronker clan — son Lenny (producer, pres  of Warner and DreamWorks Records), granddaughter Anna (that dog, co-founder Five Foot Two Records), grandson Steve Berman (head of sales & marketing at Interscope/Geffen/A&M) — died in his sleep Tuesday in Los Angeles at the age of 90.
Si Waronker was born in Los Angeles in 1915 and was a child prodigy on the violin. He wasn’t stupid, either, graduating from high school at thirteen. He studied violin in Philadelphia, France, and Germany, the latter coinciding with the rise of Hitler. After being chased by a Nazi youth gang, he returned to Los Angeles and was orchestra contractor for 20th Century Fox from 1939 until 1955.
In ’55 Waronker started Liberty Records, specializing at first in the film music he knew so well. Liberty’s first release was an orchestral single, “The Girl Upstairs” backed with “Conquest,” by
