TOKYO (Reuters) - Olympic figure skating champion Alina Zagitova on Friday claimed yet another crown by winning the world title,  overcoming an uneven season by soaring to a commanding win with an ambitious program that left the Russian in tears.
Second-place finisher Elizabet Tursynbaeva of Kazakhstan also made history by being the first woman to successfully land a quad jump in senior international competition and the first woman from her nation to claim a world championship medal.
Zagitova, who finished fifth at last year’s edition after a disastrous free skate and then endured a difficult season, struggled to hang onto a few of her jumps in an otherwise dynamic routine that included seven triple jumps.
In first place after the short program, Zagitova wept in the arms of her coaches after coming off the ice from her free skate but was smiling by the time her score was posted, 155.42 for a total of 237.50.
“There were many hard times, but I’d like to thank the audience and everyone else who supported me,” she said at
