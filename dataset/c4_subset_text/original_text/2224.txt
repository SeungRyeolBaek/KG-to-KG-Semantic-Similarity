The needs of foodies are permeating many facets of culture -- and in a city with mostly dismal museum dining, the owners of Equinox  just made a pretty smart move.
Todd Gray’s Muse, a café focused on "a fresh to-go-style" concept, opened last Saturday at the Corcoran Gallery (500 17th St. N.W.).
Established restaurateur Todd Gray and his wife Ellen Kassoff Gray, who also operate Equinox and the Watershed, didn’t go over the top with the new restaurant’s design.
"The décor is the Corcoran," Ellen Gray said. "It’s not supposed to be a grand, shiny new café" that can hold thousands of people.
She said people can relish "a terrific sandwich and a half bottle of wine while taking in some great art," for what would be "a very real and approachable experience."
The sandwiches and salads are made on site, with ingredients fresh from the same morning, Gray said. The produce is in fact bought from local farmers' markets,
