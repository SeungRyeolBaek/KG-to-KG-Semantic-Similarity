At a news conference in Winter Park, he said he wants to end a ban on smokable medical marijuana in Florida.
The Governor said  he's filing a stay of decision in an appeal by the state Legislature, which wants to keep that ban in place.
On Thursday, Gov. DeSantis said he's giving state lawmakers until mid-March to reform or rewrite Florida's law on medical marijuana.
"I want the elected Representatives to write the law the way the people intended," said Gov. DeSantis. "So we'll give them a couple weeks in session to address the smoking issue."
He said if the Legislature doesn't reach a decision by then, his office will dismiss the state's appeal, which will open the door for smokable medical marijuana to be legal in Florida.
"This thing should have been implemented, we should have moved on," said Gov. DeSantis. "For someone who has these really tough conditions, I want to do whatever we can to provide relief for these folks."
