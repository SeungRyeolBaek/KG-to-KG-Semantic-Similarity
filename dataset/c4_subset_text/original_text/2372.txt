HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WHNT) – It’s called “Blankets From Warm Hearts,” and  the title sums up the project. The North Alabama Coalition For the Homeless is asking the community to donate blankets, coats, gloves, hats, thermal underwear – anything to help keep people warm.
The annual drive has been held for more than 15 years, but unfortunately, the need hasn’t diminished. Also important, it isn’t a matter of coming up with just one blanket, hat and pair of gloves per person.
“We’re talking about multiple, because people who live out in the woods, or live under bridges get wet. They don’t have a place to dry it, so they need new warm coats, and scarves and blankets,” says Danielle Clemons, Executive Director of the First Stop Homeless Day Center.
Homeless advocates want to make sure people understand the winter goods are for more than just comfort.
NACH Executive Director Lineise Arnold says the ultimate goal of their client continuum is self-sufficiency.
