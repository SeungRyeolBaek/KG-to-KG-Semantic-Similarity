Washington officials believe 8,000 people would die as a result of an earthquake-driven tsunami after a magnitude 9 quake hits off the coast.
 The reason is many low-lying communities are without easy access to bluffs and higher ground and would not have time to outrun the waves in the mere 15 to 20 minutes it would take between the shaking to stop and first tsunami waves to hit the beach.
Maximilian Dixon, the earthquake program manager for Washington State Emergency Management, says thatâ€™s 8,000 people in the offseason. The number is expected to be higher during the warmer tourist season.
Officials say there is a solution that could drop those frightening numbers to near zero. The answer is tsunami vertical evacuation structures.
There is also the threat of tsunami waves coming from the other side of the Pacific Ocean, or Alaska. There, the warning time would be much longer.
Washington is ahead of other tsunami-vulnerable states like Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii.
The state already has one vertical evacuation structure. It doubles as part of the Ocosta School south of Westport on the coast.
