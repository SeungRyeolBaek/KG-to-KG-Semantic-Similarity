Ed Whitlock is hardly hibernating after setting a new world record in the 85- to 89-year-old age category Sunday in the  Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon.
The distance specialist is busy conducting interviews with media from around the globe as reporters vie for sound bites from the octogenarian, who ran 42.195 km in three hours, 56 minutes and 33 seconds.
1. How does your body feel in the week after running a marathon at age 85?
EW: Not too bad. No different really than how I felt after marathons in the past. My legs are a bit stiff.
2. How do you deal with the discomfort?
EW: I just wait for it to go away. That’s my secret recipe for all my aches and pains. In general, most therapies don’t seem to work for me. If I have a massage, for instance, I spend 15 minutes on the table and it feels better for 15 minutes after. And then you’re back to where you were before.
