A woman described as the Bonnie to her boyfriend's Clyde will spend another 222 days in jail after pleading guilty to five charges stemming from four incidents across  the Central Okanagan.
Kristina Anderson and Julian Hoekstra were arrested Dec. 16, 2017, after months of mail thefts in West Kelowna, Peachland and Summerland.
The first conviction stems from a December 2016 incident in which stolen mail in Peachland, fitted with a bait tracking device, led police to the couple in a car on Dobbin Road in West Kelowna, full of stolen mail.
They were released on bail, but they weren't done.
After a slew of mailbox break-ins in May 2017, 19 covert cameras were installed in Summerland community mailboxes, and on June 4, the cameras caught Anderson and Hoekstra breaking into a mailbox near McDougald and Matsu roads.
Several months later, in October, a community mailbox on Shannon Lake Road was broken into and a recently approved Wal-Mart credit card was stolen. On Oct. 29, Anderson and Hoekstra went on a â€œshopping spree
