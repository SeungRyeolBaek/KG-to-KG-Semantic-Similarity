This set of Flash templates lets you quickly create a simple yet attractive animated Web page. Included are six designs suitable for both corporate and home use.  Templates allow you to enter your text, choose your own colors and pictures, set the number of buttons and pages, and use basic HTML formatting for the body text. The program does not hide unused buttons, however. You will have to edit the source pages manually in a text editor and change colors by entering their hexadecimal codes. To the developers' credit, however, the source code is thoroughly commented. EasyTemplates might serve best as training wheels for someone with a decent command of HTML, or at least an interest in learning it.
Creating your own entire Web site is peanuts using Flash templates from EasyTemplates. EasyTemplates offers you the most flexible and easiest way imaginable to create Flash Web sites. You don't need to know Flash or HTML, just enter all your content in a standard text file, replacing the text and colors with your own, and upload the files to your Web server. Version 1.2 may include unspecified updates, enhancements, or bug fixes.
