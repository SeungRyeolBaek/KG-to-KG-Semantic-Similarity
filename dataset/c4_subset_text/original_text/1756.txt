Two former world champions meet in the final of the 2006 FIFA World Cup when Italy and France do battle in what may be a classic match of stern  defenses and cunning tactics at the Olympiastadion in Berlin on Sunday.
Fairytale ending? Zidane ahead of his last international match.
Italy, World Champions in 1934, 1938 and 1982, have conceded just one goal in their six matches at the 2006 tournament so far and will go into the match buoyed by a hard fought extra time win over host nation Germany in the semi final, and a 3-0 drubbing of Ukraine in the quarter final.
France, the 1998 World Champions and notably European Champions in 2000 when they defeated Italy by golden goal in the final, also have a stingy defense which has allowed just two goals in their six matches including clean-sheets against Brazil and Portugal.
The Italians will be looking for revenge for their Euro 2000 final defeat where they were just seconds away from a 1-0 victory, only for France's Sylvain Wiltord to equalize in the 90th minute and then David Trezeguet to score
