Measuring rental price inflation from tenancy bond data is working well, Stats NZ said today.
The consumers price index (CPI) for the  June 2019 quarter (to be released on 16 July) will be the first in the world to use administrative rent data in this way to construct the CPI.
The new method for measuring rent prices arose from a collaboration with Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).
“Thanks to this work, landlords no longer have to fill in a Stats NZ survey every quarter,” consumer prices manager Gael Price said.
Instead, rents are measured directly from data that MBIE is already collecting.
MBIE holds tenancy bonds on behalf of landlords, which means the agency has information on actual rents charged for all tenancies. This is a much bigger source of data than the survey that was previously used to measure rental prices.
The new approach means Stats NZ can release rental price indexes (RPI) every month. This is because MBIE collects the data regularly as part of administering rental bonds. The RPI has been available monthly since the start of 2019.
