REMY CABELLA has denied Newcastle are already thinking about spending time on the beach after slumping to a fifth straight defeat at Liverpool. 
The midfielder insisted he and his team-mates were as “hurt” as the long-suffering Newcastle supporters, who once again sang in protest at owner Mike Ashley’s reign during Monday’s 2-0 reverse.
Interim coach John Carver has seen his hopes of landing the job permanently nosedive, but Cabella maintains the players having not pulled up stumps for the season.
“On holiday already? No, no, we are professional,” he said. “We don’t think about our holidays. It’s impossible. We have six matches left. We need to concentrate on Tottenham.
“We need to win that game by working hard in training. In our minds, we are not on holiday. That’s not professional. We need to concentrate on playing.
Newcastle’s problems were compounded by the dismissal of Moussa Sissoko for two bookings late
