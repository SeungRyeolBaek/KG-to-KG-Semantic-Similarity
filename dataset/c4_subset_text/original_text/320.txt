Stamford's Old Town Hall Redevelopment Agency this week chose Nov. 19 for the opening ceremony for the renovated Old Town Hall building .
Both Mayor Dannel Malloy and the new mayor elected that week are expected to be in attendance. Plans also include local high school band performance. Not long after the ribbon-cutting, the building, which has been closed since 1987, will be open to the public.
An earlier plan to hold a large outdoor party downtown to commemorate the completed restoration was scrapped due to costs and timing. Agency members are considering turning part of the building into a museum.
Educational assistants, city school district employees who work with special education students and in kindergarten classrooms, would be renamed para-educators under a proposal Stamford's Board of Education is considering.
On Tuesday, the board's Labor Committee approved a revised job description, which focuses more on the employees' skill set and the job's caring and nurturing aspects, said Denise Gagne, the school district's executive director of human capital development.
The scheduled closure of Westport's Saugatuck post office has been delayed until Sept.
