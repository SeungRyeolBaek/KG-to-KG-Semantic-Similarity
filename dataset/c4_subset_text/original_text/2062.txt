But the first translated piece of the tome, "On tools for cutting and preparing wood," is here.
That initial translation caused a stir in the woodworking community, because it provided explanation and details of Roubo's workbench designâ€”absolutely the most crucial piece of shop equipment in a pre-table-saw era. Modern-day accomplished woodworkers gamely began replicating Roubo's design, as in the
