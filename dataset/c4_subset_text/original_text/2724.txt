UT-Austin and Columbia University researchers have invented a millimeter-wave circulator that could enable tetherless virtual reality and self-driving cars. 
Circulators transmit microwave and radio signals from port to port in various devices such as radars.
“Circulators are essential components in radars and in wireless communications, yet, to date, they are realized exclusively with magnets, which make them heavy, costly and bulky,” said Andrea Alu, electrical and computer engineering professor.
Working with Columbia University researchers led by electrical engineering associate professor Harish Krishnaswamy, Alu developed a magnet-free circulator integrated on a chip — like the ones in cell phones — that operates at 25 gigahertz, or 25 billion wave cycles per second. The frequencies used today for cellular service and WiFi are all below 6GHz.
Millimeter-wave frequencies are frequencies higher than 30 GHz, which has more bandwidth available, according to Krishnaswamy. This increased bandwidth is useful for applications that require large data rates, such as tetherless, or wireless, virtual reality and self-driving cars.
