Manager Tom Wade says Blyth Spartans have an "outside chance" of continuing their giant-killing run against Championship side Birmingham.
Wade's side, who play in the Northern Premier League, have home advantage against Gary Rowett's team on Saturday.
Spartans have beaten Conference side Altrincham and League Two Hartlepool en route to round three.
"We need Birmingham to have a bad day and us to be absolutely superb," Wade told BBC Newcastle.
"We played Altrincham at home, I know they're not a Championship side but they're a good Conference side, nobody gave us any chance at all and we battered them.
"If we can put that kind of game on this Saturday, Birmingham have a bit of an off day, we carry a bit of luck and get the right refereeing decisions, we've got an outside chance."
