George Mosher passed away last week. His funeral is today. The  Milwaukee investor and businessman was 79.
I had the opportunity to meet Mosher a few times, and he was always captivating and inspirational â€“ not to mention supportive of our ideas and energy at OnMilwaukee as well as an early supporter of YPM/Fuel Milwaukee and many of the start-up and recruitment and retention efforts for the region.
According to his bio and obituary, he moved to Milwaukee from the Boston area in 1965. "Joining several business organizations, he became an enthusiastic member of the Milwaukee community. George and Julie founded National Business Furniture together in 1975 and ran a successful business for over 30 years. He became an active angel investor and philanthropist, and enjoyed offering his time and talent to mentoring the next generation of budding entrepreneurs. George will be deeply missed, but his legacy will live on. He passed away peacefully after a struggle with pancreatic cancer."
