A new study suggests that the death toll from drug overdoses in America is much more severe than initially believed.
In December, the CDC said 52 ,404 people had died from drug overdoses in 2015, with over 60% dying from opioids (prescription painkillers) and heroin. Overdose numbers have been rising for years, but new research published Monday in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine suggests that those rates were dramatically underreported.
One reason for the gap? In many overdose cases, no specific drug is identified as the cause on the death certificate. Between 1999 and 2014, up to one in four drug overdose deaths had no single drug listed as the cause.
That doesn't mean researchers who want to correct the figures are out of luck, however. Even in cases in which no specific drug is listed as the single cause of death, officials often do list at least one category of drug present in the person's body based on screenings they do at the time. For the latest study, the researchers used that information to correct the data they had on drug overdoses.
Nationally, the "corrected" death rate (using the
