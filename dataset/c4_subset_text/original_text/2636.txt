George Roman, a former standout football player at Penn Hills High School who later went on to play three seasons in the NFL, died June 30 at  his home in Columbus, Ga. He was 77.
Mr. Roman, who grew up in Verona, had suffered from emphysema and diabetes.
Large for his day at 6 feet, 4 inches and weighing more than 240 pounds during his pro career, Mr. Roman decided against attending better-known schools such as Notre Dame and Wisconsin to enroll at Western Reserve College in Cleveland.
Less than a year into his college education, the outbreak of World War II led to Mr. Roman being drafted into the Army. He served as a medic from 1943 to 1946, spending 2 1/2 years in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater of Operations.
After his tour of duty was over, Mr. Roman returned to Western Reserve for two more seasons before being drafted in 1948 by the Boston Yankees of the NFL as a defensive tackle. He also played for the New York Bulldogs in 1949 and for the New York Giants in 1950.
A back injury cut short his professional career.
