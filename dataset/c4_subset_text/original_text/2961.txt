Mike Doughty On Mountain Stage Hear the singer-songwriter perform his own tunes and some from his latest album of covers, The Flip Is Another  Honey.
Singer-songwriter Mike Doughty makes his second appearance on Mountain Stage, recorded live on the campus of West Virginia University in Morgantown, W.Va. Doughty rose to prominence in the late '90s as the frontman for the experimental rock band Soul Coughing â€” a venture he now describes as a "dark, abusive, very turbulent, awful marriage." Now an established solo artist in his own right, his 2005 album Haughty Melodic spawned the hit song "Looking at the World Through the Bottom of a Well."
Doughty's latest project, The Flip Is Another Honey (a phrase from a Variety review of a Jerry Lee Lewis single), is a collection of covers. It includes two songs by Doughty's first favorite artist: the late John Denver, whom Doughty described to host Larry Groce as being ready for "his Karen Carpenter moment." Naturally, Doughty's set includes his reworking of "Take Me Home, Country Roads,"
