ATLANTA -- Christian Walker homered leading off the ninth inning and the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied against the shaky Atlanta bullpen for a 9-6  victory Tuesday night as the Braves squandered a massive, knee-buckling homer by Ronald Acuna Jr. and another strong start by Max Fried.
After Ozzie Albies went deep in the bottom half to tie the game at 6, Walker drove the second pitch from A.J. Minter (0-2) deep into the seats to start the ninth. Adam Jones brought home two insurance runs with a double that deflected off the glove of Acuna after a long run into the left-field corner.
Yoshihisa Hirano (1-1) claimed the win. Greg Holland got the final three outs for his third save.
With his right knee dipping to the ground as he delivered a mighty swing, Acuna launched a 448-foot shot over the Braves' bullpen in right-center field, putting Atlanta on the board in the fourth inning after Arizona jumped ahead 2-0 in the top half against Fried.
