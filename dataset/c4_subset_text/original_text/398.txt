FAIRVIEW, W.Va (WDTV) - Several of you in Fairview have reached out to 5 News over the last few days  saying the water is discolored and dirty.
Some said it's pink, and others called it brown.
"I don't feel safe right now," said Rachel Toothman. "Not after what I saw on Friday night."
"It's not right because we pay for that water," said Rachael King. "We should be able to use that water without any kind of fear of being sick or ill, or it turning our clothes different colors."
These people tell us discolored water has been flowing into their homes.
"It's almost, at least on a monthly basis, where somebody is saying 'hey, I have brown water, does anybody else.'"
Kelley says two of her children came home from school on Friday and noticed the problems there, as well.
"None of my fellow students would drink it because it was a weird color," said Aubrey Hamilton.
"It looked disgusting," said Audrey Hamilton.
