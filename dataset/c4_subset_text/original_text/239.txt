Tributes have been paid to young Teesside mum Laura Hodgson who has lost her fight for life.
Laura, from Billingham,  was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer last year.
The mum of two beautiful children died peacefully on Sunday with her "family by her side".
A Go Fund Me page set up to raise money for Laura&apos;s treatment raised almost Â£40,000 from hundreds of well-wishers.
Her family has praised the "overwhelming generosity" of everyone who donated to support Laura and said they planned to donate to the chemotherapy day unit at the University Hospital of North Tees and The Willow Trust.
Laura, who fought the aggressive disease until the end, was described as an "absolute warrior" by her family.
Her sister Michaela posted on social media: "It is with a heavy heart I am writing this.
"I would like to thank every person that donated, shared and supported our fight to support Laura.
