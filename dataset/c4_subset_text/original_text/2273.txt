Was it only two weeks ago that analysts at Berenberg Bank were telling us Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD) stock was  undervalued, and primed to deliver investors a 42% profit? Ah, the good old days.
Well, I hope you enjoyed them while they lasted, because today, we have a new view for you on Gilead Sciences stock -- and this one&apos;s not nearly as optimistic. Yesterday, analysts at Leerink Partners announced that they are taking the opposite view on Gilead, and downgrading the shares from outperform to market perform.
The news isn&apos;t all bad, of course. Leerink still thinksthat at $79 and change, Gilead stock costs less than it&apos;s worth. But whereas Leerink previously priced Gilead shares at $112 in value (42% upside -- just like Berenberg had predicted), the analyst&apos;s new price target of $94 per share suggests that Gilead stock is only about half as valued as we used to think.
