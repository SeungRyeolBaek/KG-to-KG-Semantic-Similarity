BERLIN — Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden said in an interview broadcast Sunday that U.S. officials might take deadly revenge against him for disclosing American  surveillance secrets.
Snowden told the German public TV broadcaster ARD that he had not faced any direct threats or intimidation since seeking asylum in Russia last summer. But he cited an article from the Web site Buzzfeed that quoted anonymous officials from the U.S. military and National Security Agency as saying they wished they could kill him.
“There are clear threats, but I’m not losing any sleep over them,” Snowden said, according to a German-language voice-over of the interview. An English-language transcript was not immediately available.
The 30-year-old also accused the U.S. government of spying on German companies, even if the information gathered would not serve national security needs. Snowden cited the engineering and electronics company Siemens as an example of firms that might be targeted.
Since last June, Snowden has released a massive trove of top-secret documents, which depict the U.S. government’s surveillance of telephone records,
