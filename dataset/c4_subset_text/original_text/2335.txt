BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese southern boomtown of Shenzhen, famed for its eye-watering home prices, has set an  unprecedented goal of capping the number of new private homes, as the government focuses on rolling out more affordable public housing.
Shenzhen plans to build 1.7 million new apartments by 2035, of which only around 40 percent can be private homes, the city’s housing authority said in a statement on its website on Tuesday.
Heeding President Xi Jinping’s call for houses that “are for living in, not speculation”, local governments are starting to roll out policies to ensure multiple sources of home supply and multiple channels of financial support.
China’s under-developed home rental market has been a focus in the past year, particularly in megacities such as Shenzhen, which has a population of more than 12 million. In a national first, state lenders started giving loans last year to renters at ultra-low interest rates with long repayment periods in Shenzhen.
The housing authority said the remaining 60 percent of new supply would be equally split
