Less so with combining two or three departments maybe, but you think going from three fire administrations down to one wouldn't save money? I think it  would.
And in Tri Cities WA their auto aid fire agreement is between 8-9 fire agencies with 8-9 fire administrations. I know they could sabe fire admin money going from 8-9 fire admins down to one.
Without a detailed study of what it would require, I don?t think that?s a given.
Many of those smaller WA fire districts run a lean administration. There is a chief and a secretary. Budgeting and payment of vouchers is done by the board of fire commissioners, and they don?t get all that much for their monthly meetings.
Also, regional?authorities? that have the ability to levy taxes and fees are not very accountable to the voter. If a local fireboard goes a bit nuts on the expenses, locals will show up at the meeetings and make noise. Regional entities are good at removing themselves from accountability.
I think fire admins push fire auto aid over joining forces totally, just to save their jobs
