Parents who have sued the Bossier district alleging unconstitutional promotion of Christianity say they fear for their safety.
Seven Bossier Parish Schools parents involved in  a religious lawsuit against the district want to remain anonymous during future legal proceedings, citing fear of harassment and violent threats on social media toward them or their children.
The plaintiffs made their request in a court document filed March 1. The motion to remain anonymous is not opposed by the defendants, the Bossier Parish School Board or Superintendent Scott Smith, according to the court document.
The parents say they fear that community members or school employees who have contact with the children may cause problems.
The suit, which accuses Bossier Parish Schools of unwanted and unconstitutional Christian messages and indoctrination, was filed with help from Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
Among other things, the lawsuit alleges that teachers and administrators in elementary, middle and high schools promote Christianity and in some cases call out students who do not attend church or are not Christian.
"It's really a case about the school district's conduct that is affecting many families and we're appreciative that the school district agrees with us"
