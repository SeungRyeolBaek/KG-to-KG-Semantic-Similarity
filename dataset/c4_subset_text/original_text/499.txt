The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 was enacted to protect employees who need to take absences from work to care for themselves or their family members  due to medical problems. This law was amended in 2008 to allow extended leave for the care of service members. Retaliation of any type is strictly prohibited. Employers who use FMLA absences to judge an employee's performance face legal sanction from the Department of Labor or in civil court.
Not all leave falls under the auspices of the FMLA, even if that leave is taken for medical reasons. If the business is governed by the provisions of the FMLA, the employee must have worked for the company for at least 12 months and have completed 1,250 hours of work within the previous 12 months to be considered eligible for leave. Leave may be granted to allow employees to care for themselves, their spouse, their children or their parents. Other family relationships are not covered by this legislation. Leave is considered unpaid and may be requested for up to 12 weeks per year. Military family members are eligible for 26 weeks of leave annually.
