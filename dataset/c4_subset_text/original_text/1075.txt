Two earthquakes felt over the weekend were aftershocks from February's magnitude 4.6 event and the magnitude 5 event that rocked Boulder in 2010. 
Geoscience Australia duty seismologist Hugh Glanville said two events were recorded a few hours apart on Friday night.
"We had two earthquakes, a magnitude 3 out near where we had that 4.6 in February and then a magnitude 2.6 a few hours later closer to Kalgoorlie that was felt by many more people."
People in Kalgoorlie reported having objects move and windows rattle by the quakes.
"We are having more at the moment, because we've had these larger events we're having aftershocks associated with them," Mr Glanville said.
"So on average in the area you have had about four a year for the past 20 years, at the moment we're having about 6 or 8 a year and these are mostly associated with the magnitude 4.6 and the magnitude 5 in 2010."
Mr Glanville said so far this year the Goldfields region has had five or six magnitude 2 earthquakes in addition to
