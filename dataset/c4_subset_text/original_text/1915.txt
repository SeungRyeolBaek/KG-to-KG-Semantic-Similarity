Amnesty International today called on the Kenyan government to take all appropriate steps to protect people in Kenya from ongoing human rights abuses caused by politically-mot ivated and ethnic attacks in the aftermath of Decemberâ€™s disputed presidential elections.
International standards on law enforcement stipulate that firearms should not be used except to defend people against an imminent threat of death or serious injury and only where less extreme means are insufficient.
Politically-motivated and ethnic killings by armed gangs continue in several parts of Kenya. Most of the violence has targeted members of communities from which President Kibaki was perceived to have drawn his support, particularly members of the Kikuyu community.
Recent cases of violence have been both spontaneous and organised, particularly in parts of the Rift Valley.
On 22 January, seven people from the Kikuyu and Kisii communities were killed in Kipkelion and 70 houses were burned in the Aldai area of Rift Valley province by armed gangs.
Organised attacks have also taken place targeting internally displaced persons (IDPs) who were seeking refuge in places close to the homes they had fled as a result of the violence.
