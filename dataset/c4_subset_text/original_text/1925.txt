President Obama's stunning victory on Thursday in the Supreme Court is a surprising validation of his dogged refusal to give ground on his 2008 campaign promise to provide  health insurance for the millions of Americans who live in daily dread of disease or sickness. Just about everybody not on the White House staff expected a conservative high court to invalidate key parts of the law Obama pushed through Congress in 2010. But the president prevailed, dealing a severe blow to Republican hopes to ride "Obamacare" to big victories in November.
But before the White House gets too carried away in celebration, the reality is that the Court's decision, as historic as it is, does not guarantee the survival of the law that is the signature accomplishment of Obama's first term in office. This big legal victory gives the president a second chance to do what he flubbed the first time -- persuade the country that this is not a partisan exercise. For even after this decision, the health care law still is far from the permanent reform he envisioned when he hailed its passage as answering "the call of history."¬ù More than two years later, it remains deeply unpopular despite surviving this legal challenge
