Labyrinths of Memory (Matahat El-Zakirah) play will be performed several times over three days at Osiris art space , the same location that hosted the play in December 2015.
Directed by Nora Amin, the interactive performance transforms the entirety of Osiris’ space, its hallway, rooms and kitchen, to function as an unusual stage with separate performances on every part of it.
The different spaces offer distinctive stage sets that match certain memories that were drawn from participants in an acting workshop held earlier by Amin at Osiris.
“Shut in alone with each of the actors in turn, listening to him or her and engaging in an intimate exchange of memories, each member of the audience becomes actively involved in shaping the encounter,” theatre critic Nehad Seleiha wrote of the work in Al-Ahram Weekly.
Labyrinths of Memory stars Shehab Ibrahim, Mohamed Abo El Yazeed, Maha Omran, Ahmed Gamal, Nada Abdallah, Ahmed El-Sawy, Ahmed Abdallah, Mohamed Abaza, Karim Refaat and Hend El-Sh
