SSD Tweaker is a small tool which aims to optimise Windows for the best possible solid state drive performance.
For the most part this  just involves turning off Windows features that generate drive activity. And so in a few clicks you can disable the Windows indexing service, NTFS 8.3 name creation and "last access" date stamping, boot tracing and so on. Or simply click "Auto Tweak Settings" and the program will optimise all your settings at once.
If you'd like to see if the program can help to optimise your SSD's performance, though, don't let this put you off. Just be sure to make a note of your original settings before you apply any tweaks, so it's easy to restore them later, should it be necessary.
Please note, there's also a commercial SSD Tweaker Pro version available. This also allows you to tweak relevant hibernation settings and Windows services, as well as providing the ability to check and optimise Windows TRIM status. The program can be yours for $12.95, and you can find out more at Elpamsoft.
