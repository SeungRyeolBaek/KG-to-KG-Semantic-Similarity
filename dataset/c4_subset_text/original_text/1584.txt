The Cardinals are in an extreme rebuild phase . Bosa is an elite-level talent and projects to be a perennial All-Pro from the defensive end projection. Arizona selects the best player available in the draft.
The Bednarik Award winner (nation’s top defensive player) would give the 49ers a promising pass rush when matched with 2018 No. 3 overall pick Solomon Thomas. Allen could be the X-factor their defense needs to help them push for a playoff berth next year.
