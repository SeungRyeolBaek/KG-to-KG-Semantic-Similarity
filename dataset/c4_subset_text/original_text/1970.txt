Your theories on why America is getting fatter.
Last month in this space I asked Slate readers to help me understand what’s going  on with obesity—specifically, the explosive growth in obesity over the past 10 years. I’m still digging out from under the excessive weight of the e-mail deluge (several thousand), but here’s my preliminary report.
The least helpful contributions are the ones that explain, often in painstaking detail, that obesity is caused by some combination of eating too much and exercising too little. Well, duh. The question is why eating and exercise habits have changed so dramatically at this particular time.
The angriest e-mail comes from readers who believe they’ve been duped into eating too many carbohydrates and not enough fat. The Agriculture Department’s ubiquitous “food pyramid” recommends six to 11 servings a day of bread, cereal, rice, and pasta—a diet certain, in the minds of my irate correspondents, to trigger insulin reactions that prevent you from burning calories and/or cause you to crave between-meal snacks
