Richards Bay is joining other coastal cities and building a desalination plant to survive the crippling drought. By converting sea water into fresh, the  plant will allow the town to tap into what engineers refer to as an “almost infinite” water resource.
But water and sanitation officials say the option is one of “last resort” and has come about because of slow work by the water department on other projects.
The water department’s own plans show that desalination was seen as a last resort – becaue it is so expensive and uses so much electricity. Research by the Water Research Commission breaks this down: the City of Cape Town can produce water for R1.25 a kilolitre using a mix of water sources, while Rand Water in Gauteng can produce water for R2.50 per kilolitre.
But a large desalination plant along the coast produces water at anywhere between R5.80 and R8.30 per kilolitre.
Big plants, such as the one being built in Lamberts Bay in the Western Cape, use huge amounts of electricity
