Complete with overnight lines and crazed crowds.
Boxing Day takes place in Great Britain the day after Christmas. A lot of people only care  about it because of the sales it brings.
Shoppers "queued" outside London's famous Selfridges department store overnight, where items will be sold for up to 75% off the usual price. They've still got nothing on American Black Friday shoppers, who have been known to camp out for days in advance.
U.K. shoppers are expected to spend around Â£2.9 billion, or $4.7 billion, on Boxing Day sales this year.
Black Friday sales in the U.S. were around $59 billion.
Like in the U.S., people in the U.K. have been injured because of the day's massive crowds and confusion.
An 18-year-old boy was stabbed to death in front of Boxing Day shoppers in 2011; the conflict was attributed to gang violence, but Boxing Day chaos contributed as well. And this year, train drivers in Central London are striking because of a lack of "quality time" around the holidays,
