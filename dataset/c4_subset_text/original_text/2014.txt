Cavaliers guard and ex-Knick J.R. Smith earned his one-game suspension from the team by throwing a bowl of soup  at assistant coach Damon Jones, according to a report.
ESPN reported on Friday that the "conduct detrimental to the team" the Cavs announced before Thursday's 108-97 loss to the 76ers was indeed broth-based.
Smith will return to practice on Friday and resume game action Saturday night when the Cavs host the Nuggets, per the report.
Jones, a former Cleveland guard, has been with the Cavs as a coach since 2014 after working his way up from the franchise's G-League squad.
Cavs head coach Tyronn Lue said he had "a little discussion" with Smith on Friday but didn't go into any details, per ESPN.
Lue filled Smith's shooting guard slot with Rodney Hood, who bucketed five of his 14 attempts and finished with 11 points, five rebounds and five assists in the defeat.
Smith, who has missed only one other game with the Cavs this season, is averaging 8.3 points on 39.2 percent shooting
