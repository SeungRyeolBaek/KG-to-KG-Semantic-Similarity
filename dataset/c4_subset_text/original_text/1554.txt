Will Saif al-Islam Gaddafi run in Libyan elections?
The announcement that Saif al-Islam is planning to run for president has prompted  mixed reactions within Libya.
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi plans to run in Libya's presidential elections expected for later this year, according to a spokesman for the son of ex-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
The announcement by Ayman Boras was made on Monday during a press conference in Tunisia, where the spokesman outlined Saif al-Islam's vision of "restoring the Libyan state, making it for everyone".
Since his release from prison in June 2017, the whereabouts of Saif al-Islam has been unknown. Boras, however, claimed that he is in Libya and is ready to become part of the political process - an announcement that stirred mixed reactions within Libya.
Mohammad al-Darrat, a member of the Tobruk-based Libyan House of Representatives (HoR), told Al Jazeera that Saif al-Islam's intention to run does not deserve any attention, asserting that the Gaddafis' regime is gone for good.
