Bikram is all about concentration and focus, but it can be difficult to stay in the zone when your feet start cramping up. B ikram -- also called "hot" -- yoga is fairly intense, so some muscle soreness and cramping is to be expected. By ensuring that you're properly hydrated and checking your posture and technique, you should be able to keep cramping at bay. If not, a quick break and a soothing massage can get you back in the game.
Check your posture and alignment. When your posture is off, it can create excess pressure in the feet. For instance, when you're in Balancing Stick pose, leaning too far forward could put excess pressure on the balls of your feet, when the weight should be evenly spread through the feet instead.
Spread your toes and ensure that when you are in poses that require foot balance, your weight is evenly distributed along all four corners of the feet. Rolling to your instep can also cause cramping along the inside of your foot, so keep your feet flat on the floor and avoid rolling inward. This is especially important during challenging poses,
