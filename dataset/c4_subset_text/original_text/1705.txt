Washington: US President Donald Trump on Friday said that he did not see a rise in white nationalism across the world after the accused in the New Zealand  mosque terror attack called the president "a symbol of renewed white identity."
“I don't really think so. I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems,” The Hill quoted Trump as saying when asked if he saw a rise in white nationalism.
"If you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that’s the case. I don’t know enough about it yet," he added.
Earlier, a social media account believed to be linked to the Australian-born suspect, who filmed himself, while carrying out the attack, had posted a lengthy manifesto, expressing anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views.
Responding to the same, Trump said that he was yet to see the manifesto and called the mass shootings "horrible".
The 28-year-old suspect, identified as Brenton Harrison Tarrant appeared before a Christchurch court on Saturday on murder charges connected with Friday's terror attacks
