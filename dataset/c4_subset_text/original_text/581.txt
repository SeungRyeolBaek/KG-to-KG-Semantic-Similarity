RACIST supporters at Colchester United have been blasted by Burnley boss Stan Ternent who claims they almost forced Ian Wright to quit the  game after just two matches in the Second Division.
In his autobiography Stan The Man, Ternent describes Layer Road as an "Essex fleapit" and accuses U's fans of hurling "the foulest racist abuse I'd ever heard at a football match".
Ternent was furious after former England striker Ian Wright MBE was subjected to the tirade of abuse during a Second Division game in February 2000.
Colchester United made a full and unreserved apology after the incident and have worked tirelessly to eradicate the racist problem at their ground.
Marie Partner, the U's chief executive, last night said: "At the time, the club dealt with the incident in the appropriate manner and made a full apology to Ian Wright. With that in mind, we feel it is a shame that Mr Ternent – who has a reputation for being an extremely professional manager – has to stoop to that level to sell books and we will not be drawn into making similar comments
