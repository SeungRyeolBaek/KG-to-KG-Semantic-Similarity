Rand Paul and Frank Underwood would be best buds.
Senator Paul announced his presidential bid Tuesday, and for a moment, his jobs promise echoed  Underwood's jobs proposal on the fictional show House of Cards.
On Tuesday, Paul said: "I have a vision for America where everyone who wants to work will have a job."
Stop the tape. Didn't Underwood, the president on House of Cards, say something really similar in season 3?
Yup: "If you want a job, you get one," Underwood said while giving a televised address about his jobs plan "America Works."
Of course, politicians make big campaign promises on the economy during every election. Paul isn't the first to guarantee jobs.
But hey, the parallels don't stop there. Underwood needs $500 billion to justify his fictitious jobs program. His solution: cut welfare and entitlements.
Paul will probably need money for his sweet-sounding jobs plan too. And we already know he wants to significantly cut down government spending on programs like medicaid and food stamps. Paul also wants to reduce payments on entitlement programs like social security
