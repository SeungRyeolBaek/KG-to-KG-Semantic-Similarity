The 'Buzz without booze' campaign has just launched promoting fun things for young people to do that don't involve alcohol.
The Southampton, Hampshire , Isle of Wight and Portsmouth PCT Cluster would like 11 to 16 year olds living in Southampton to suggest how to have fun without booze. By submitting ideas and healthy activities, entrants could win a Wii and Wii Fit.
The 'Buzz without booze' project aims to encourage young people to enjoy themselves without alcohol by participating in alternative activities.
Sandy Jerrim, alcohol project manager, for the Southampton, Hampshire, Isle of Wight and Portsmouth PCT Cluster said: "The levels of alcohol use significantly increases from age 11 to 15 years, and is therefore a critical time to make sure young people are making positive choices about what to do with their time. The campaign aims to get young people to share ideas about that they could be doing instead."
"The PCT Cluster is committed to promoting positive alternatives to young people and their parents, and is very excited to have developed the Buzz without Booze campaign as a way of involving young people," explained Sandy.
