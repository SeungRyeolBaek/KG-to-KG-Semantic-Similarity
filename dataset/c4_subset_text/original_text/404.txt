The Public Service Commission on Wednesday approved a pilot program intended to create up to 350 megawatts of long-term renewable power within the next three years , a move that state officials and environmentalists say could help establish a permanent guideline that utilities would use to generate or purchase electricity from renewable sources.
The decision, which followed an eight-hour meeting in Covington, comes four months after the commission announced its support for the program, which is aimed at bolstering the Louisiana's fuel mix while adding resources that contribute to its reliable and economic long-term power supply.
For years, state officials have considered creating a renewable portfolio standard that would require regulated electricity utilities to acquire a portion of their energy from generators that use renewable sources. Some environmentalists and renewable energy advocates say the pilot program that has been approved will also encourage growth and potentially fast-track testing of smaller-scale renewable sources, which would then be sold to in-state utilities.
Details of the program were released for public comment in August, and based on the feedback that was received, state officials made several changes to its guidelines, including one that allows some woody biomass products to
