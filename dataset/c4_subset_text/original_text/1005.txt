In a rare and stinging public rebuke, Los Angeles County supervisors criticized new Sheriff Alex Villanueva on Tuesday over his reinstatement of a  deputy accused of stalking a woman, with some of them questioning whether he was abusing his power.
The Board of Supervisors’ move heightened a political crisis for Villanueva, who was elected just two months ago in an upset victory but has generated alarm from watchdogs for opposing some reforms implemented in the department after a series of corruption scandals.
The county’s governing body voted to send a letter to Villanueva expressing concern over his rehiring of a deputy who was fired in connection with allegations of domestic abuse and later served as a volunteer on Villanueva’s election campaign, which The Times reported earlier this month. The letter also criticized Villanueva for attacking the credibility of an alleged domestic violence victim.
The board also directed county counsel to examine some of the legal issues surrounding the reinstatement, including whether Villanueva acted within his authority in overriding a decision by a county appeals board to uphold the deputy’s firing.
