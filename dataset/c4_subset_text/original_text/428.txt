A Newtown Township man who threatened to go to the Bucks County Courthouse and kill the man he was infatuated with was sentenced to a four - to 23-month prison term yesterday after pleading guilty to terroristic threats.
On July 19, 47-year-old Edward Joseph Twining was stopped at the courthouse by security personnel, who were aware of his threat on the lives of William Marietta and Marietta's girlfriend, Helen Hovan.
Security guards, who were looking for a man fitting Twining's description, found a gun in his briefcase and Twining was later arrested. Twining knew Marietta would be at the courthouse, court records said, because Marietta was scheduled for a hearing on a minor criminal charge.
At his hearing yesterday, Twining said his intention was not to kill Marietta but to kill himself in front of the man he loved, Senior Deputy District Attorney Terry Houck said.
Twining also said there were love letters in the briefcase he brought to the courthouse.
The subjects of the threats chose not to make a statement in court, Houck
