The 2019 Porsche Speedster looks like the rolling embodiment of a thank-you letter to Porsche fans. Clean lines, lean cockpit, naturally-as pirated and a manual transmission–seems pretty much as perfect as a Porsche could get in 2019.

This car is built around a chassis “derived from the 911 GT3 models with a specifically-calibrated rear axle steering system and dynamic engine mounts to deliver a maximum amount of precision, stability and driving pleasure,” per a press release, and Porsche’s promising a 192-mph top speed and a stopped-to-60 mph time of 3.8 seconds.
