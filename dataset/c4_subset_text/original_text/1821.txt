'Tis the shopping season, right?!
That's what some 4,000 guests had on their minds at the Wells Fargo Preview Party on Wednesday for the 38th annual Houston Ballet Nutcracker Market at NRG Center.
The party goers got a jump on the shopping before the market officially opens today with an expected 100,000 in attendance through Sunday. The market features some 270 vendors, with 26 new ones, from across the nation. New this year, Kendra Scott hosted a jewelry pull in which 100 percent of proceeds benefited the Houston Ballet.
Attendees enjoyed cocktails, buffet stations and music by David Caceres Band, took holiday photos with special guests Santa and Mrs. Claus.
Eleven percent of merchandise sales and all proceeds from ticket sales directly benefit the Houston Ballet Foundation. Since its inception in 1981, the Nutcracker Market has raised more than $63 million for the Houston Ballet Foundation.
