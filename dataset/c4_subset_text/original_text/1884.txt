Among the most important events in the recent history of the Western Reserve Port Authority was the Mahoning Valley’s collective decision in 2008 to create  its economic-development division.
The Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport, the reason the port authority was created 22 years ago, has long been a topic of debate. Some people have called the airport a financial “black hole” because of the government subsidies that have been provided to keep it in business.
But the addition of economic development gave critics another target, and it may have set in motion forces that have led to the port authority’s current turmoil — including discussion of throwing out the current board of directors and starting over.
U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Howland, D-13th, first proposed adding an economic development office in early 2008, then persuaded officials in Trumbull and Mahoning counties to contribute money to start it.
Rose Ann DeLeon, formerly of the Cuyahoga County Port Authority, was hired in 2009 as executive director for economic development at a salary of $155,000 per year after a national search.
