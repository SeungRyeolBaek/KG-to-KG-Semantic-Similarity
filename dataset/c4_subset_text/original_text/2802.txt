Chabad emissary describes 'chaos' after massive - and deadly - earthquake.
One day after a massive earthquake in Ecuador which killed  272 people, the Chabad emissary to Guayaquil spoke about the damage.
"The quake occurred Saturday night, toward the end of the Ma'ariv prayer," Rabbi Uriel Tawil began, in an interview with haredi news outlet Hamevaser. "Suddenly, everything was shaking - and we were shocked, we didn't know what might happen."
"We left the building, gathered the children, and sat on a grass area in the courtyard, where we gather during an emergency," Tawil continued. "We started to recite Tehilim (Psalms), and the children were crying in panic."
"It lasted about two minutes," he added. The average earthquake lasts between 30-40 seconds.
"Everything came crashing down," he continued. "Surveillance footage from inside the synagogue shows that after we went outside, all of the books fell off their shelves; everything was on the floor."
