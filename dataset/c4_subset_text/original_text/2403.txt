Bipasha Basu hospitalised due to respiratory problem?
THANE: Actor Arbaaz Khan has admitted to police that he used to  place bets on cricket matches with the help of bookie Sonu Jalan, the alleged kingpin of the IPL scam, said inspector Pradeep Sharma.
Khan, who was named by Jalan during questioning, recorded his statement on Saturday. He said that no money changed hands and whenever he lost, Jalan blackmailed him to appear at public events, said inspector Sharma. Khan is likely to be made a witness in the case.
Actor Arbaaz Khan arrived at the anti-extortion cell office around 11am. He was at the office for nearly five hours. Jalan and Khan were brought face to face, said Sharma.
The inspector told TOI that Khan had confessed to having placed the bets through Jalan, who was introduced to him by a common friend seven years ago. “Earlier, Khan placed small bets just for fun and there was no monetary transaction between him and Jalan,” said an officer from the department.
