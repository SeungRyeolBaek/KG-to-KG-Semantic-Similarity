The primary responsibility of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) is to better prepare the State of Illinois for natural, manmade or technological disasters , hazards, or acts of terrorism. Our goal is a "better prepared state." IEMA coordinates the State's disaster mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery programs and activities, functions as the State Emergency Response Commission, and maintains a 24-hour Communication Center and State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC). The SEOC acts as lead in crisis/consequence management response and operations to notify, activate, deploy and employ state resources in response to any threat or act of terrorism. IEMA assists local governments with multi-hazard emergency operations plans and maintains the Illinois Emergency Operations Plan.
IEMA is also responsible for protecting Illinois residents from the potentially harmful effects of ionizing radiation, administering more than two dozen programs to protect citizens and the environment. Programs include extensive emergency planning and response efforts and training for local responders for accidents involving radiation; inspecting and regulating radioactive materials licensees; registering and inspecting radiation producing equipment and facilities statewide; accrediting medical radiation technologists; and certifying mammography facilities.
