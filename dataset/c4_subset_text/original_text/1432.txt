CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Robert Rawson, who has been interim dean of the Case Western Reserve University law school since the former dean stepped down , will remain in that role until mid-2011.
Rawson, 65, has asked that his title remain interim dean. The university has called off its search for a new dean and will resume the search next summer. Former Dean Gary Simson served as dean from July 2006 through December 2008.
Rawson did not want to be considered for the permanent job, but agreed to a longer interim commitment.
"It gives me some more running room to continue some projects," Rawson said Monday. Specifically, he'll help with some goals of a strategic plan for the law school approved by the faculty in September.
High on that list are plans to raise more money for scholarships. He also wants to boost the school's career services section, which helps recent graduates struggling to navigate the tough job market.
Rawson, who was partner-in-charge of the Cleveland office of Jones Day until 2007, remains a partner at that firm. He is also a trustee of Cleveland State University.
