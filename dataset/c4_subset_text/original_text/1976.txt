We could be shivering through the night on what will be the coldest of the autumn so far tonight, with health experts warning the weather could  be fatal.
The North East awoke to frozen cars and icy conditions this morning, and despite a dry and sunny day ahead, this evening is expected to get very chilly indeed.
Public Health England is urging people to prepare for the cold snap, warning that it can have serious health implications.
Meteorologist Mark Wilson said while it is unlikely overnight temperatures for the entire UK will drop lower than the coldest of the season so far - which was -12C in parts of Scotland last week - Britain could get its coldest night of autumn on tonight with temperatures in some areas forecast to get as low as -8C.
The North East looks to escape the worst of the cold weather, which will mainly hit southern regions. The minimum temperature for the North East predicted by the Met Office for tonight is -1C.
"For the bulk of the country, it's going to be a cold day. Across much of the southern parts of the country we're expecting harsher frost."
