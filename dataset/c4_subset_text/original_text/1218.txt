Grass Gourmands: A Herbivore Food Mystery On The African Savanna : The Salt A new study sheds light on a longstanding  ecological question: How do so many species like impalas and elephants co-exist when they're all feeding on the same limited foods?
Scientists used a relatively new technique called DNA metabarcoding to analyze the diets of impala and other herbivores in southern Kenya.
What do large herbivores like elephants and zebras eat? And if – as researchers assumed — they eat many of the same things, then how do they share the spread of grasses and other plants across the savanna?
You'd think this would be pretty easy to figure out: Just watch them eat or inspect the poop, right? But large animals are wily. They travel long distances and can be too dangerous to observe up close.
Sorting out what they're eating through binoculars is akin to trying to sort out what somebody is eating in a diner from across the street. And when scientists look at the poop under a microscope, the plant bits are often too mashed up to
