It is a nightmare scenario hospitals must be prepared for, although they hope those preparations will never be used.
On Monday, that nightmare came to  Kingston General Hospital when the sound of gunshots shattered the normal hum of the busy hospital.
Millhaven Penitentiary inmate Corey Ward is alleged to have disarmed a correctional officer and fired his gun, wounding the visiting family member of a patient in the leg. Ward has been charged with three counts of attempted murder and a review has been launched.
In response to the shooting, the hospital declared Code Silver, which is designed to alert staff to the existence of a person with a weapon in the hospital and to set off planned emergency procedures.
Code Silver is the latest colour code that is part of hospital emergency preparedness. It was introduced by the Ontario Hospital Association in 2016, 25 years after a standardized system of colour codes, including Code Orange for an external disaster and Code Red for a fire, was introduced.
Code Silver is, to a certain extent, a sign of the times, with a steady increase in gun violence across the country.
