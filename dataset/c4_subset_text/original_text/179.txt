CLEVELAND â€“ Two women -- one with a ticket, one tearfully without -- laid claim to a $162 million lottery jackpot Tuesday,  triggering a legal dispute that could come down to "finder&apos;s keepers" or fraud.
Elecia Battle (search) went to police Monday with the teary story of a lottery ticket lost outside a convenience store, and a small crowd with flashlights soon gathered in the snowy parking lot in search of the precious paper scrap.
Tuesday morning, Rebecca Jemison (search) said Battle&apos;s claim prompted her to quit stalling, submit her ticket and collect the prize from the Dec. 30 drawing.
"I was angry at first, but not worried at all," said Jemison, 34. "I knew what I possessed."
Police, who originally said Battle, 40, had told a credible story about losing the winning ticket, are now investigating whether she lied in a police report, a misdemeanor punishable by 30 days to six months in jail.
