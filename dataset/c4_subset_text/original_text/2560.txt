Bigger and better is how it is done at the Haliburton School of the Arts. A component of the Sir Sandford Fleming College,  the HSTA campus in Glebe Park is well known for its summer arts program. This year, there are 50 new weeklong courses, 22 new Saturday workshops and 15 new instructors.
Boasting more than 300 courses and 150 teachers, the program offers classes on all sorts of techniques and styles, from watercolour painting to felting.
“I think of it as the Disney effect – it’s important to blend the familiar favourites with fresh, new options so that people maintain interest,” says HTSA program co-ordinator Schelley Schell. With the extensive number of courses offering such a wide selection of art classes, all kinds of interests are catered to.
Some of the new course and workshop offerings for this year are negative painting, memory quilts, thread sketching and painting and yoga paired with painting, writing, singing, drawing and meditation.
