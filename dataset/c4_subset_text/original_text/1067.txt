As a plant pathologist, Gordon Grimm pursued his lifelong passions at work and play.
"Nature was such an important part of his being,"  said Katherine Grimm of Winter Park, his wife of 30 years. "When we'd go outside, he would look around and he'd say, 'This is my cathedral.' "
Grimm, 93, died on Nov. 6. "He was a sweet person and my best friend," said Katherine Grimm.
Born in Madison, Wis., Grimm earned his doctorate in plant pathology from the University of Wisconsin, where his studies were largely focused on the wheat that covered the Midwestern fields of his youth. He moved to Winter Park in 1953 for a job with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, researching Central Florida citrus plants. He was instrumental in helping growers combat phytophthora parasitica, a disease of the root system.
A keen observer, Grimm watched his new home grow along with the flora.
"He could remember when T.G. Lee's cows were actually in a pasture where the Colonial Plaza area is on Highway 50," said Katherine Grimm,
