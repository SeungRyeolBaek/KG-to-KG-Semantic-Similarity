A system that aims to identify stolen passwords before breaches are reported or even detected was launched on Tuesday.
Shape Security's Blackfish credential defence system  is designed to detect the use of stolen usernames and passwords by criminals and in real time.
The technology is a mechanism for organisations to identify the abuse of stolen passwords and attempts to hijack accounts long before these same purloined credentials show up for sale on the dark web.
Cybercrooks regularly automate the process of testing stolen or leaked passwords on third-party websites.
For example, customers of online takeaway firm Deliveroo found their accounts hijacked and charged for food they never ordered because of a credential-stuffing attack. In another attack using the same method, passwords and email addresses from previous breaches were abused to gain access to 26,000 online UK National Lottery accounts. Groupon blamed fraudulent purchases from some UK customers' accounts on password leaks from other sites.
Credential stuffing only works because many users still use the same login details on multiple sites. This is a serious security risk that's only getting worse as the volume of data breaches rises.
