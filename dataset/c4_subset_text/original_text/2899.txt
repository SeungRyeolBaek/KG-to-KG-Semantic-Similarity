I love to entertain. My other half and I host every Thanksgiving, every Super Bowl and countless pau hanas and dinners throughout the year.  Thatâ€™s why when it came time to buy living room furniture, we went big. Our sectional is roughly the size of two twin beds and has held up to eight people at once.
After dinner with friends recently we came back to our place and assumed our regular positions, sprawled out on the couch with our feet up on the coffee table. It had been a long day, so I propped mine up with a throw pillow. Then it dawned on me that an upholstered ottoman might make more sense than a hard coffee table. Not only is it more comfortable for resting your legs after a long day, but it can also serve as extra seating when needed. Luckily, I found out that converting a coffee table into an upholstered ottoman was easier than I thought.
