So you're renting a car? It's no big deal, unless something goes wrong. Here's a checklist based on our own experiences and on  the rental cars we've seen in our shop lately.
Have all your IDs with you. This includes drivers license and the credit card you used to make the reservation. Check cards are dead on arrival. You say you're well-to-do and don't carry a major credit card with you? BIG MISTAKE. You will not be rented a vehicle if you do not have one. Too bad if you are a millionaire, ALL of the rental companies are very strict on this.
Read your automobile insurance policy before you rent, paying special attention to any sections pertaining to rental vehicles. Bring your insurance card in case you're asked to prove you have insurance.
Read your credit card documentation. Most cards provide some kind of insurance on rental cars when charged to their card. Check limits and exclusions. If in doubt pay for the additional insurance. I know of one driver who owes $10,000 for a wrecked rental auto when on vacation in Alaska, with no valid insurance coverage
