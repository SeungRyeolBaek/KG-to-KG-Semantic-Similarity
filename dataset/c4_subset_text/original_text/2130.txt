Bill Collings liked to build things. And while he was blessed with good engineering genes, nobody would have guessed just what he would wind up building : a guitar.
His grandfather’s uncle was a pioneering automaker. His grandfather was the innovative president of Dow Corning, the manufacturer of silicone products. His father was an engineer. His parents hoped he would become a doctor, but he dropped out of a pre-med program at college.
He built hot rods, mostly as a hobby. But after working for five years in an Ohio machine shop and experimenting with improvised string instruments in his spare time, he finally found his true calling when he was about 30.
Abandoning metal for wood, he began a quest to perfect the kind of fretted musical instrument he had dabbled with since he was 13, in his case a C-1 model Gibson.
Self-taught and by then living in Houston, he learned on the job largely by fixing other people’s instruments before venturing to build acoustic guitars on his own in his two-bedroom apartment, making machine parts for them as well.
