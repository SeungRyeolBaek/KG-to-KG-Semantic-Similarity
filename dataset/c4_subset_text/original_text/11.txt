NEW YORK — Television retailer QVC has made aggressive plans to keep shoppers watching — instead of mall-hopping — on Black Friday, an event  it has traditionally ignored.
The leading network for TV shoppers promises special deals and a healthy dose of new items for sale starting on Thanksgiving night. Program host Dave James plans to stay awake for 28 hours of telethon-like coverage.
The day after Thanksgiving is traditionally the biggest shopping day of the year, called “Black Friday” because it’s key for many businesses to go in the black, or turn a profit. QVC, which competes with ShopNBC and the HSN home shopping network, has not wanted to get caught up in the frenzy and has always treated it as just another day for its sales pitches, said Doug Rose, the network’s vice president of programming and marketing.
“This year, and we’ve been planning on this for many months, we really expect to join the fray with the other retailers,” Rose said.
QVC is hoping for a “Black Friday” of its own.
