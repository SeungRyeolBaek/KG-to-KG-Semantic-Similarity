HUNTINGTON, W. Va. — Western Kentucky will host Louisiana Tech at 11 a.m. Saturday at Houchens-Smith Stadium  in the Conference USA championship game. The contest will be televised by ESPN.
The Hilltoppers (9-3), the 2015 Conference USA champions, won the league’s East Division by virtue of its 60-6 win at Marshall on Saturday. Louisiana Tech (8-4) clinched the West Division earlier this month, but lost the right to host the title game after losing 39-24 at Southern Mississippi on Friday.
The Bulldogs have defeated WKU in two of the last three meetings including a 55-52 victory Oct. 6 in Ruston, La. The Tops beat LTU 41-38 in 2015 in Bowling Green.
Western has won six straight and 20 of its last 22 against Conference USA opponents. It has also won 12 straight against conference opponents at home.
A win against Tech would give the Hilltoppers back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time in program history and two straight conference titles for the first time since 1970
