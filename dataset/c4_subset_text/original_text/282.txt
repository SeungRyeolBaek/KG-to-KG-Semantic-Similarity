Hassocks kicked off a new season and a new era at the Beacon by drawing 1-1 with Broadbridge Heath in their opening game of  the Southern Combination League Premier Division season.
A crowd of 104 turned out to see Mark Dalgleish take sole charge of the Robins for the first time following Phil Wickwar's decision to sand down as joint manager.
It was one of those new signings, Liam Benson, who scored the Hassocks goal, tucking away a 70th minute penalty after Jack Wilkins had been felled in the box. That was cancelled out by Devon Fender's equaliser 10 minutes before time for Heath.
Both Benson and Alex Spinks have returned to the Beacon from Lancing while Alex Harris is back in goal after a short spell with Ringmer. The fourth new face to start was defender Dan Webster, formerly of Burgess Hill Town and signed from Horsham YMCA.
The Robins' most eye catching signing of the summer wasn't present here. Phil Johnson has also returned from YM after three goal-studded seasons at Gorings Mead since he left
