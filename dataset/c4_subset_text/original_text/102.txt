Fans, coaches and players -- not just officials -- need to step up their games before disaster strikes.
If you follow me on social media ( the math involving my modest number of followers says it’s unlikely) you know I’ve been consistent in my bewilderment at the officiating of area high school football games this season.
Officiating has affected, and perhaps determined, the outcome of several games. My beef hasn’t simply been about judgment calls that appeared to be judged incorrectly (those happen), but rather with the mechanics.
Crews have often bumbled yardage mark offs, spots (the ball can’t be exactly on the yard line EVERY time – that’s lazy), downs and rules. The common occurrences expose inexperienced, perhaps undertrained officials.
However, there are reasons for the above. Who in the heck would want to be an official today? One hundred bucks a game isn’t terrible, but do you want to be the subject of nonstop verbal abuse for three hours?
