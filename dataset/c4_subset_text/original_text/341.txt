SAN FRANCISCO – A San Francisco UPS driver recovering from a gunshot wound said Monday in an interview that he does not understand why his colleague  Jimmy Lam shot him and killed three fellow drivers last week, but does not believe the shooter had reason to feel disrespected, which police have suggested as a possible motive.
Alvin Chen, 43, cried at times as he told The Associated Press about the chaotic shooting inside a UPS warehouse Wednesday that also left Lam dead after he killed himself and left another driver with a gunshot wound.
Although police have suggested Lam might have felt disrespected by other workers, Chen said it would have been out of character for any of the three men who were killed to have done so.
It would have been especially out of character for two of the drivers who were his close friends, Chen said, adding that he knew of no animosity between them and Lam.
"I&apos;m heartbroken. I can&apos;t understand why this happened," Chen said, a pair of crutches nearby.
