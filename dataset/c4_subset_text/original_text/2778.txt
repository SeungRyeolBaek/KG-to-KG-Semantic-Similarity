As the crackdown on religious congregations in Beijing and other Chinese provinces intensifies, the country’s government is burning bibles, closing churches  and forcing Christian to renounce their faith, according to a latest report by the Associated Press.
“The international community should be alarmed and outraged for this blatant violation of freedom of religion and belief,” Bob Fu, president of legal aid organization China Aid, told the AP.
Fu also provided video evidence of piles of bibles that had been set on fire as well as forms handed out to people for the renunciation of their Christian faith.
