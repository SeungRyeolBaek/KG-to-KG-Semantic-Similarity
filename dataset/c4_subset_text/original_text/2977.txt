CRYSTAL PALACE mascot Kayla was punched in the face by a rival fan, a court has heard.
A Charlton Athletic  fan has denied punching Kayla - a 25-year-old American bald eagle - when violence broke out between the two clubs in 2015.
Addicks fan Daniel Boylett, 36, of Eltham, south east London, has denied attempted criminal damage in the alleged attack.
Boylett appeared at Croydon Crown Court alongside Colin Kitto, 49, of Eltham, Andy McConville, 48, of Rochester, Kent, Billy Cowcher, 32, of Greenwich, south east London and Sam Donegan, 25, of Welling, south east London, who have been charged with the football violence.
Kayla's handler Chris Belsey was walking the bird of prey around the Selhurst Park pitch when a punch was thrown from the crowd, the jury heard.
Prosecutor Daniel Higgins said: "As he passed the stand he noticed three or four fans were shouting abuse and one of these three or four lent over the barrier and threw a punch directed at Kay
