The state Legislature will choose the governor on Jan. 7 because neither candidate got at least 50 percent of the vote in November.
MONTPEL IER, Vt. — The second-place finisher in last month’s election for governor announced Monday that he is staying in the race, bucking recent history of the losing candidate conceding and leaving the final say up to the state Legislature.
Speaking at the Statehouse, Republican Scott Milne criticized what he called the “pervasive incompetence” of Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin’s administration and described the state’s finances as “a disaster.” He rattled off a litany of complaints, including the lack of a plan to fund the state’s proposed single-payer health care system, the failure to implement a law requiring statewide prekindergarten and the absence of a plan to clean up Lake Champlain.
