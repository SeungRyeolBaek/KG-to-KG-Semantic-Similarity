Westerly shut out Stonington, 15-0 — the exact score of its first Thanksgiving Day victory 100 years ago — in front of  a crowd of approximately 4,400 at Stonington High School.
In 1911, the Westerly defense shut out rival Stonington in the first Thanksgiving Day game between the high schools.
On Thursday, Stonington and Westerly matched up in the 100th anniversary of that game, and the Bulldogs proved not much has changed in the last century.
The loss eliminated Stonington — who entered the game in the final spot — out of Class M state playoff contention.
Westerly (9-2) held an early 7-0 lead on Adam Mitchell’s 68-yard run down the left sideline on the first play of the game.
Despite the long run by Mitchell, the game’s MVP, the Bulldogs combined for 36 total yards the rest of the half.
Stonington, which still leads the all-time series, 69-66-17, after this 152nd overall meeting, outgained Westerly in the first half
