Nobody should know a football team better than its head coach. But Blake Nill admits he was wrong about the University of B.C. Thunder birds.
After taking player inventory before his first season on the Point Grey campus, Nill figured he had the makings of a 3-5 team. He missed the mark by a mile.
After going 2-2 to start the Canada West season, the T-Birds finished second in the conference at 6-2. They then knocked off the Manitoba Bisons and the No. 1 ranked Calgary Dinos in the playoffs and now have won seven straight. The latest breakthrough came Saturday, in Antigonish, N.S., where UBC defeated the Atlantic Conference champion St. Francis Xavier X-Men 36-9 in the Uteck Bowl to qualify for the Vanier Cup for the first time since 1997. UBC will play the defending national champion Montreal Carabins, who defeated the Guelph Gryphons 25-10 in the other Vanier Cup semi-final, the Mitchell Bowl, played in Guelph, Ont.
