Nicole Kidman wears the Duet Pinky Ring while accepting her Emmy award last night.
Last night's Emmy Awards were a triumph for  diversity and inclusiveness. Awards went to the likes of Riz Ahmed, who won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series, making him the first South Asian man in Emmy's 69-year history to win for acting. Or Lena Waithe, who is the first African American woman to win for comedic writing.
There was one message, though, that was quietly making a statement without saying a word.
Two Hollywood stars who were also winners last night, Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley, were both spotted wearing Duet Pink Rings by the company dedicated to creating a "supportive, powerful network for the women in its tribe," Shiffon Co.
