The other day, Michelle Obama went full Wal-Mart in her outfit on the First Family's taxpayer-funded Grand Canyon excursion, and the  journalistic fashionistas are having the vapors. I am almost, but not quite, sympathetic to the First Lady. It seems she wore short shorts and what might be charitably described as a casual top.
Avoiding the appearance of queenly behavior is politically wise. But it does American culture no favors if a first lady tries so hard to be average that she winds up looking common.
If the First Lady had not been sold to the American public as a fashion icon, a woman of elegance and grace, and if she had not willingly catered to this claque with bizarre Spider Woman outfits and queasy-making colors and textures juxtaposed, I would truly pity her plight. We all sometimes head out the door with too little thought to how we look.
But having made well-publicized shopping sprees in Paris, and willingly catered to the fashion idolatry directed her way for purely political reasons, I think that Mrs. Obama has accepted the mantle of clothing exemplar
