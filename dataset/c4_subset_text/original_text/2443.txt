The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia today issued driver’s licenses to 10 women in a historic first for the Middle Eastern country. Government officials there say  that women will be officially allowed to drive as of June 24. Officials noted that about 2,000 more women could receive their driver’s licenses next week.
Permitting women to drive is a component of modernization reforms being implemented by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Fox News reported, who is the heir apparent to the king. The 10 new drivers already held licenses in other countries and, as such, received the expedited go-ahead after taking a driving test and eye exam at an agency called the General Department of Traffic, which is located in the country’s capital of Riyadh.

AP adds that the restriction has been targeted by women’s rights activists in the Muslim country, some of whom who are still in jail and could be put on trial for charges related to allegedly undermining Saudi Arabia’s security.
