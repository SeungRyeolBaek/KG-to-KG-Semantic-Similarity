ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Sunday said Prime Minister Imran Khan has ordered Sindh government to launch probe  into reports of abduction, forced conversion and underage marriages of two teenage Hindu girls and to take immediate steps for their recovery.
In a Twitter post earlier today, the minister informed that Prime Minister Imran has issued directives to the Sindh chief minister to look into reports that the girls in question have been taken to Rahim Yar Khan.
The incident came to light after the father and brother of the girls, in videos that went viral on social media, said that the two sisters were abducted and forcefully converted to Islam. In a separate video, however, the minor girls can be seen saying that they accepted Islam of their own free will.
"The minorities in Pakistan make up the white of our flag and all of our flag's colours are precious to us. Protection of our flag is our duty," the info minister added.
Chaudhry had also tweeted on Saturday that the government had taken notice of reports of the alleged forced conversion and underage marriages of the two girls in Ghotki.
