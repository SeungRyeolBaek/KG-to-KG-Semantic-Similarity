College students can find time for all sorts of activities, but  one chore that always seems to drop off the bottom of their to-do list is washing the sheets.
Two Hingham entrepreneurs have come up with a solution: linens made from a fiber called Tencel, derived from Eucalyptus trees, which you can simply toss into a compost bin or trash can when they’re dirty.
