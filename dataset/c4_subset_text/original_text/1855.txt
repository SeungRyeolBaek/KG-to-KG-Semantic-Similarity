NSW Electoral Commission satisfied iVote unaffected.
A second vulnerability in the cryptographic protocol employed by the Swiss government’s e-voting  system has been found, this time relating to how votes are decrypted.
It comes just weeks after the in-development system was found to contain a cryptographic trapdoor that could allow vote manipulation to take place unbeknown to the authorities.
That flaw centred around the way the country’s sVote system, which uses software from the Spanish vendor Scytl, verified votes using a sequence of shuffle proofs.
It was later confirmed to be present in NSW's iVote system, which also uses Scytl's e-voting software, though it was declared unaffected and safe to use for last week's election.
But new research, published on Monday by the same group of researchers, reveals a similar weakness with the implementation of the cryptographic technique used to create the decryption proof, known as Fiat-Shamir heuristic.
Cryptography and privacy researchers Sarah Jamie Lewis, Oliver Pereira and Australia’s-own Venessa Teague said the error “
