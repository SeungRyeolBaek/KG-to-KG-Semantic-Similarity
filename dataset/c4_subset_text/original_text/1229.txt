â€¢ Denzel Washington, who directs and stars in the inspirational movie The Great Debaters. The movie's based on true events (which means that  some of it is fictionalised and not to be taken as gospel truth, but the essence of truth is very apparent) that happened at Wiley College, Texas, in the Thirties, when an African-American college debate team, against all odds, achieved something approaching glory.
The main debaters are played by Jurnee Smollett, Nate Parker and Denzel Whitaker and they all have fire in their bellies.
Ms Smollett and Mr Parker play composite characters featuring traits of many real-life students who were at Wiley in the Thirties.
Mr Whitaker portrays someone real: James Farmer Jr., who later became one of the leading architects of the Civil Rights movement. (In this film, his father is played by Forest Whitaker - no relation!) Washington himself plays Melvin Tolson, the Wiley professor and poet who coached the debating team. I loved a lot about this film, particularly the sense that these characters had such a passion for knowledge.
