All property developments with over 100 premises set to get free fibre optic infrastructure from NBN Co.
The company responsible for the rollout of the National Broad band Network, NBN Co, has released key details of its plan to pay for the fibre of all new developments with over 100 premises. The changes begin on January 1, 2011.
Quigley made the announcement in Sydney during his first press conference of 2011. He said more than 70 online applications from developers for fibre had already been received, of which 40 were made on New Year’s Day.
According to NBN Co, just over half of all new developments have over 100 premises.
“We don’t yet have a network out there so this is not an easy job to do, so that’s why we’re going out on tender to see if we can get some Australian companies to help us,” he said. “We have a tender that closes…on Friday January 14, which we expect to evaluate within about a month.
But any new development with less than 100 premises will not be able to apply for the scheme.
