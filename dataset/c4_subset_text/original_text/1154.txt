The Eagle County Fair and Rodeo dates back to 1939 when hundreds of folks from the region came to the county seat to share in a day  of competition and camaraderie. Along with the ropin’ and wranglin’ the 4-H exhibits featured livestock, arts and crafts. Housed in the Eagle River Center, the 4-H exhibits are not to be missed today. This is where the hard work and dedication of local youth comes to fruition.
4-H is the largest youth development organization in the nation, helping youngsters pursue interests that range from photography to computers, but we checked in with those raising everything from steers, sheep, chickens, pigs, even bunnies at this year’s fair. These kids have worked countless hours to raise an animal worthy of the annual auction. This dedication to tend to and care for some living being other than oneself speaks volumes to the character these kids possess. The 4-H emblem is the four-leaf clover, which stands for Head, Heart, Hands and Health and these kids exemplify all of these qualities.
