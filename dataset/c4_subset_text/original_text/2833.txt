News of the hack has taken a toll on the credit bureau's brand in the eyes of consumers.
The Equifax brand is under assault. 
Equifax's reputation with consumers has fallen at a quicker pace than other companies hit by similar data breaches in recent years, according to data from YouGov BrandIndex released Monday.
The credit bureau has suffered a major public relations hit since Sept. 7, when it said its computer systems were breached by hackers and that personal data of 143 million Americans was at risk of being stolen as a result.
The negative headlines have taken a toll on its "Buzz score," tallied by YouGov, which tracks the perception of more than 1,500 brands daily.
The credit bureau's 33-point 10-day drop is larger than other high-profile breach.
The second-worst was a drop of 10 points suffered by eBay in the 10 days after its May 2014 hack. Other high-profile breaches, such as one at Anthem Blue Cross in February 2015 and Home Depot in September 2014, did not cause as big a hit to those brands.
