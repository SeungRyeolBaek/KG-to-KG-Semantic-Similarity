ELEANOR HALL: The budget has been attacked from two entirely different perspectives this morning.
The tabloid press has accused the Government of  attacking and "gouging families of $150,000", attacking aspirational households by winding back on middle-class welfare.
But many economists are arguing those cuts don't go far enough.
To discuss who wins and who loses, and what more should be done I'm joined in the studio now by our economics correspondent Stephen Long, and also by Brian Toohey, one of the nation's longest serving political journalists and a leading commentator on economics and public policy.
Starting with you Stephen, the front page of the Daily Telegraph today says Wayne Swan's budget "pickpockets" families and that it is hard-working families in "mortgaged poverty" that will be hardest hit. Is that a fair characterisation of who is bearing the brunt of the budget cuts?
STEPHEN LONG: No, I don't think so. It's an inaccurate misleading and very, very superficial critique of the budget, Eleanor. They're talking about measures to wind back on family benefits
