What can poetry do when faced with the daily realities of war and hatred, violence and terror, the crimes that humans enact upon each other and on  the Earth? A cynic would answer nothing, would condemn the personal lyric as pure solipsism, an indulgence for the privileged few. But many 21st century poets are wrestling with questions of justice, writing at the intersection of history and intimacy, weaving political and social truth-telling into their private experiences.
Robert Pinsky defended his art while serving as poet laureate: “I think poetry is a vital part of our intelligence, our ability to learn, our ability to remember, the relationship between our bodies and minds,” he told the Christian Science Monitor. Bay Area poets Solmaz Sharif and Tess Taylor prove this claim, help us learn and remember with their vital new collections.
Sharif’s astonishing debut Look (Graywolf Press; $16) examines an endless cycle of war and violence, using a myriad of voices and forms. A formidable poetic talent, Sharif was born in Istanbul to Iranian parents, activists who fled their home country after the Iranian Revolution.
