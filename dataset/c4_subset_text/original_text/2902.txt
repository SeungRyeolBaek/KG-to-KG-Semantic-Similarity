A last minute push by the Committee for the Defense of Iranian People’s Rights to prevent the execution of Iranian teacher Abdolreza G hanbari is in full gear today after the Iranian courts rejected the teacher’s final appeal.
Ghanbari was arrested at his workplace after anti-government demonstrations on Dec. 27, 2009.
Held in Evin Prison since his arrest, Ghanbari has been tortured and denied access to a lawyer.

The campaign by CODIR has the backing of many human rights and trade union organizations including Amnesty International, Labour Start, the National Union of Teachers, and the University and College Union in the UK, the Canadian Teachers
