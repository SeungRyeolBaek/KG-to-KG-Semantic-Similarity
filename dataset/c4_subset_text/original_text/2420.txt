Free Harem of Perfect Virtual Girlfriends?
Benefits of the Cloud: Servers, Capacity, Storage...Girlfriend?
They  say e-mail and IM is the death of interpersonal communication. Well, if the latest dating service in front of me right now is any indication, love could be following the same path. Enter Cloud Girlfriend, a new service which allows you to have a fantasy romance online.
The site categorizes itself as "a mix between Match.com and Second Life." Indeed it is: Unlike other more traditional dating sites, there's no requirement that you present yourself as who you really are. So say you're a 5'2" guy who weighs 110 pounds soaking wet. Have no fear, you're now a 6'3" 220-pound gym rat.
After creating your profile on Cloud Girlfriend with who you want to be (rather than who you really are), the site's algorithms then proceed to search through other profiles in order to find you a match. Now this person probably isn't real either, so you have no clue who you're really talking to.
