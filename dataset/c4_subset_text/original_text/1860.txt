SB 4 seems like a NIMBY gambit to water down SB 50 to something the NIMBY cities could tolerate. Weiner is very likely  to give into this small vs big city bifurcation, yet Palo Alto is preying he gives into nixing the 'jobs rich' areas upzoning and delaying application to'sensitive poor communities', both of which the poor people want. There is going to be a lot of horse trading until the next hearing on the 24th. Hope Weiner doesn't water down SB 50 to the point of worthlessness like he did 827.
Fine and other members of the Scott Wiener's fan club have a chance to put money where their mouth is. Next Tuesday, buy the former City manager's share of a single family home. Use it for affordable housing/shelter now. Then use SB50 to upzone it into 4, 8 or more affordable units?
Note that the City of San Francisco Board of Supervisors from where Mr. Weiner started his political life is opposed to SB50. They are already overloaded with people and infrastructure issues. So please do not play
