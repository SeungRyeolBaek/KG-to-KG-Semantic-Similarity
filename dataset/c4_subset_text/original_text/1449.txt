Season recap: Solid all season, Nico Young enjoyed a postseason for the ages, even as part of it was disrupted by the Woolsey fire. 
Young won the CIF Southern Section’s Division 2 individual title just days after most of his teammates were evacuated from their homes due to the quick-spreading wildfire. He set a Riverside City Course 3-mile course record with a time of 14 minutes, 24.2 seconds while leading Newbury Park to its first boys team championship.
He wasn’t done. The following week, he won the 5-kilometer Division II race at the CIF State Championships at Woodward Park in Fresno in 14:59 while again leading the Panthers to a championship, this time at the state level.
Newbury Park performed so well, in fact, it earned a berth into the Nike Cross Nationals meet in Portland, where Young again impressed with a fourth-place overall finish in 15:04.7.
