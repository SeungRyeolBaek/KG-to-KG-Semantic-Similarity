“We’re always looking at our benefits program,” said Huffman, who is based in Charlotte.
The announcement comes  after rival JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank by assets, in January announced a similar increase in parental paid leave to 16 weeks, from 12. That amount is available to “primary caregivers” only, defined by JPMorgan as the parent who has primary responsibility for a child after birth or adoption. The bank also increased paid leave for non-primary caregivers from one week to two.
There is no differentiation between primary and nonprimary caregivers in Bank of America’s policy, which allows mothers and fathers to both take 16 weeks. The second-largest bank by assets employs roughly 15,000 in its headquarters city.
Huffman said Bank of America’s move was not in reaction to JPMorgan.
Wells Fargo said it does not specifically provide paid family leave but offers options parents can use to take time off from work and still receive 100 percent of their pay.
Wells noted that new fathers can use the regular paid time off the company awards
