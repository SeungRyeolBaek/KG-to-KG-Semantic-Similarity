ISIS released a 'kill list' last week, which included members of synagogues and churches as potential targets by 'lone wolf' attackers .
The Islamic State’s release on July 3rd of a new “kill list” prompted U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials to brief American Jewish leaders on the possible threat of terrorism to prominent Jewish figures and synagogues. The latest ISIS statement is not the first “ISIS kill list” to target American citizens. News of one broke in early June on the site Vocativ, which reported on a list published online which targeted over 8,000 Americans - including Hollywood celebrities and Silicon Valley executives.
Some 200 Jewish leaders joined the conference call on Friday organized by the Secure Community Network, the security arm of the national Jewish community, in the wake of the ISIS list that included members of synagogues and churches among some 1,700 individuals. The names of the synagogue members were pulled from the synagogue websites, among other sources, according to SCN.
“The lists appear to be directed toward ‘lone wolf’ ISIS supporters
