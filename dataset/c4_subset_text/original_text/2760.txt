A hurricane may have swept through Northampton on Saturday afternoon but even that wasn’t enough to prevent the Cobblers from inching three points  closer to promotion and in doing so they made their own bit of League Two history.
With this win over lowly York City, Northampton became only the second team this century – and the first since England’s fourth tier changed it’s name from the old Third Division in 2004 – to reach 60 points or more at the 28-game stage of the season.
The last team to achieve that feat were Chesterfield way back in 2001 and, encouragingly for Cobblers fans, the Spireites subsequently won promotion.
Not only that, but for the first time since May 2000, the Cobblers clocked a sixth successive league win – and 11 in 12 in all – as they comfortably overwhelmed a beleaguered York side despite the horrific weather conditions.
