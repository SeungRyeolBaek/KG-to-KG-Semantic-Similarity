BURBANK — Granada Hills resident Bob Kalaba found a new best friend in a Labrador mix named Iggy, whom he adopted Saturday at  the Burbank Animal Shelter.
Iggy playfully ran to Kalaba, tail wagging.
Kalaba and his family were the first group to adopt an adult dog at the shelter's Annual Summer Adoption Fair that runs until Thursday.
"I wanted to adopt one that was going to be euthanized if nobody took the dog," he said. "That to me is so sad."
Iggy's previous owner turned her over to the shelter because she was "not a good camping dog, so just go ahead and put her to sleep," Kalaba was told.
"We took her because she is a sweet dog, and as long as she likes to go for walks — that's all I want," he said.
Kalaba's children and wife researched and visited various shelters before settling on Burbank.
Adopting a pet Saturday also allowed some owners to take advantage of the Volunteers of the Burbank Animal Shelter's offer to pay 50% of adoption fees
