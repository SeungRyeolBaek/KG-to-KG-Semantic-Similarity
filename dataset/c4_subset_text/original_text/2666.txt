SearchBoth, Corp., today announced the launch of SearchBoth.se; Sweden's first website that enables users to search both Google.se and  Yahoo.se at the same time.
Both Google and Yahoo are placed side by side on a split screen in order for users to easily compare results of both websites. The company has also launched the same service for 17 other countries including the United States with SearchBoth.com, the United Kingdom with SearchBoth.co.uk, Belgium with SearchBoth.be, France with SearchBoth.fr, Russia with SearchBoth.ru and many more. All of the SearchBoth family of websites searches both Google and Yahoo or Google and MSN in their respective countries.
Online searchers no longer need to be tied to just one search engine. According to researchers and analysts, the majority of tech savvy and non-tech savvy Swedish search engine users are crossed between either Google or Yahoo. Each show the same results, but on different pages. Some results may come up on Google's first page, however, the same results could be on Yahoo's second, third or fourth page, or vice versa
