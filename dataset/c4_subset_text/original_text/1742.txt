A fantastic September left this stock overheated and in need of a cool shower.
Shares of Windstream Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: WIN) fell 21.9% in October, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. On the heels of an 18% gain in September, based on Windstream launching a bevy of new and expanded network services, the rally ran out of steam.
If Windstream investors were expecting a constant stream of service launches, early October left them disappointed. At that point, the company added fixed wireless data plans in 40 markets nationwide, and shares prices immediately stopped sliding. Call it a correction of overheated network-building expectations.
Going beyond the October period, Nov. 7 saw Windstream announcing an all-stock merger with fellow network access specialist EarthLink (NASDAQ:ELNK). The $1.1 billion deal is expected to close in the first half of 2017 and should increase Windstream's cash flows from the get-go. Including an early share price boost from rumors about the EarthLink deal, Windstream rose about 8% on the news.
