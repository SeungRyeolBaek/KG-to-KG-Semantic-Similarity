President Obama's $3.77 trillion budget proposal for 2014 also calls for long-term changes to Medicare and Social Security.
President Obama on  Wednesday proposed a $3.77 trillion budget for 2014 that would cut deficits by $1.8 trillion over the next decade.
Obama's budget blueprint -- which has already drawn criticism from the left and the right -- offers changes to Medicare and Social Security. It also includes tax increases that would primarily hit high-income households and corporations.
The plan calls for greater spending on infrastructure, early childhood education and nondefense research. Those investments would be paid for by other measures so that they don't add to deficits, Obama said.
"[D]ebate in this town has raged between reducing our deficits at all costs and making the investments necessary to grow our economy. And this budget answers that argument. We can grow our economy, and shrink our deficits," he said.
The president's budget is late this year, coming after the Senate and House have each passed separate and very different 2014 budget frameworks.
