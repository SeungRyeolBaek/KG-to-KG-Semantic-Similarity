SINGAPORE - It appears there are two truths to living in Singapore - do not mess with a food order and when a dispute erupts , call the police.
And so it was on Thursday (Nov 9) at 11.30am when a woman, who wanted to be known only as Madam Xu, ordered a plate of wanton mee with char siew from a stall at the hawker centre at Pasir Ris MRT station. After she ate the noodles, it hit her that the meat tasted like chicken.
Shin Min Daily News reported on Saturday that she questioned the male employee who sold her the dish.
"I just asked him if the char siew was chicken, and he started shouting at me and repeatedly scolding me with vulgarities, making me very angry," said the 65-year-old retiree, who called the police.
The signs at the shop show "Chicken Wanton Noodle" and "Chicken Char Siew Rice" in bright colours, and in English and Chinese. Char siew usually is made with pork.
