JVC Media , which owns local radio stations 98.5, 96.1, 105.3 and 103.9 —the last of which was once in Riverhead — is considering moving its studios to downtown Riverhead, the company’s owner told the News-Review Thursday.
The stations, which operate under the call names WBON, WJVC, WRCN, and WPTY, are currently housed in the company’s Ronkonkoma studio, though owner John Caracciolo said he is considering buying or leasing space in downtown Riverhead. He said he visited the area Wednesday to scout locations and has met with Riverhead Business Improvement District officials.
“I think Riverhead really has a lot of potential,” Mr. Caracciolo said, adding he would be open to buying a building if it was priced right.
His vision for the station includes a large window where passersby could see disc jockeys at work, he said.
