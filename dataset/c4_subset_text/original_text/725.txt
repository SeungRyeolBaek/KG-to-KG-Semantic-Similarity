The Flinch author Julien Smith is giving his book away for free. Something for nothing? That's the idea. The co-author of  the 2009 book Trust Agents is so intent on sharing his work that he wants readers to access it as soon as they unwrap their new holiday Kindles.
The Flinch will be available for free via Amazon until the end of June 2012. A print version will follow - for a price - but Smith, 32, said he's more focused on getting his words out than on making a buck or two. He hopes this short work will help readers overcome their primitive instinct to flinch when a risky opportunity presents itself.
In an interview with International Business Times, Smith discussed his new book, overcoming inhibitions, and the prospect of (eventually) turning a profit after giving his intellectual property away for free.
