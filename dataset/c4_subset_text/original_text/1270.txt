Robin Lynn Miller, 36, of New Galilee, Pa., formerly of Erie, went to see her Lord on Saturday January 15, 2011. 
Born June 15, 1974 in Erie, Pa., she was the daughter of JoAnn Taylor, Erie, Pa. Robin attended East High School, Erie. She enjoyed spending time with all her family and watching her favorite TV shows, "Ghost Hunters" and "Creep Show". Go figure, her favorite color was black.
In addition to her mother, she is survived by her husband, Richard Miller Sr.; two children, Katylynn and Richard Jr. "Bubba"; two brothers, Jesse Miles, Smithfield Pa; formerly of Erie and Marvin Lee Miles, LaBelle, Pa.; one sister, Tammi Jo (Miles) Williams, Erie, Pa. and many aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, and nephews who all loved her and will miss her very much. Her other two loves in her life were her dogs, Buckie and Meca.
A celebration of Robin's life will be celebrated at a later date.
