about the time that artificial intelligence becomes smarter than we are.
Despite my optimism about learning innovations, no one can predict the future. Few predicted  the 10% stock market correction in January, nobody predicted the 70% drop in the price of oil (from $94 per barrel on 6/30/14 to $27 per barrel last week). Nobody saw September 11... or ISIS coming (or the unfortunate link between the two). Nobody saw World War I, or the Internet, or the collapse of the Soviet Union.
These unexpected high-profile Black Swan events are important developments that are way outside anyone's forecast. They seem to be happening more frequently given the collision of complex human systems, exponential technology ( Moore's Law etc.), and the climate that we've increasingly messed with. What makes these unexpected events more worrisome is the concomitant loss of civic capacity and collective problem solving ability (as evidenced by the early U.S. presidential campaigns).
Tech: We're living on an exponential curve but our brains make linear projections. When it comes to new technology, almost everything is closer than it appears.
