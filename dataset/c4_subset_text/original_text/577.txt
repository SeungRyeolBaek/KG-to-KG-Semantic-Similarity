A Los Angeles-bound Alaska Airlines flight was forced to return to Seattle&apos;s airport Monday afternoon after an airport worker fell asleep and  became trapped in the cargo hold.
Alaska Airlines said the flight had taken off from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport at 2:39 p.m. local time. Fourteen minutes later, the plane&apos;s captain and some first-class passengers heard banging coming from beneath the aircraft. The pilot decided to return to the airport and declared an emergency for priority landing.
"I think we’re hearing a noise from the baggage compartment," the pilot said, according to KCPQ. "Might be a person in there, so we’re going to have to come back around."
After the plane landed a ramp agent came out from the front cargo hold, which Alaska said is pressurized and temperature-controlled. The area is often where animals are kept during flights.
"Upon exiting, he told authorities he had fallen asleep," the airline said.
The man, an employee of Alaska contractor Menzies Aviation, walked off the plane
