"Samantha Who?" has emerged as one of the breakout hits of this troubled TV season, and a major component of the ABC sitcom's  success is Melissa McCarthy's hilarious work as Dena, a childhood friend of Christina Applegate's title character.
"Dena is so sweet and bubbly, but at the same time there was that scene in the pilot where she confessed that she and Sam were not really friends and she had been fooling everyone," McCarthy says. "That made her much more interesting to me. She just wanted to be friends with these girls so desperately that she went outside her normal behavior. But if she's crazy enough to do that, what else might she do? Dena is just a little 'off,' which is always more interesting than someone who is just straight up."
McCarthy broke into comedy at New York clubs, then made her TV debut on her cousin Jenny McCarthy's 1997 MTV comedy-variety show.
Her big break came in 2000 as sweet-natured chef Sookie St. James on "Gilmore Girls," a show that required her to master huge chunks of dialogue
