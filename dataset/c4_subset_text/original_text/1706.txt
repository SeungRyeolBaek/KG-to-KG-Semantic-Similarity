THIS Sunday (7), a Herrison Hospital History Open Day is being held at Herrison Hall in Charlton Down, near Dorchester, from  11am to 4pm.
People will be given a chance to learn more about the history of the hospital and meet some of the people who were involved with it.
It was timely then to hear from Sally McMahon, who doesn't live locally but became aware of the open day after picking up a copy of the Echo when she was staying in Dorchester to visit the opening of the Tolpuddle Martyrs Remixed exhibition at the Shire Hall.
Some of Sally's relatives worked at or were patients at the hall and she has shared their records with us below after researching her family history.
1) Employment record - Samuel Hammett was a brick layer (1871-1881) who possibly worked on the construction of the building, but certainly worked as an attendant at The Dorset County Asylum from 1891-1911 and resided there. He was Sally's second cousin three times removed and the son of James Hammett Tolpuddle Martyr.
