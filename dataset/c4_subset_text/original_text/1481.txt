MINNEAPOLIS -- Last night's game, on paper, had the look of a pitching duel that comes along once or twice a season : Johan Santana (6-4, 3.16 ERA) vs. Curt Schilling (9-2, 3.81), the guy who won the 2004 Cy Young against the guy who placed second. And, as is often the case in life, the event did not live up to the hype; in this case, it exceeded it.
``I knew from jump street he was on," Schilling later said. ``I knew he was going to have to make one mistake for us to win."
Santana, for eight spellbinding innings, was channeling Randy Johnson, amassing 13 strikeouts, the highest total by a lefthander against the Sox since 1972 with the exception of that man. Mickey Lolich, in 1972, fanned 15 Red Sox, and Johnson matched that in 1998. Santana walked no one and found the plate with 75 of his 102 pitches.
``Did he look nasty from up there?" David Ortiz asked the assembled writers.
