A superstore whose advertising upset people living nearby has been allowed to keep most of its signage.
Camping superstore Go Outdoors moved into  the old MFI site in Canley last year.
The company had applied to the council to keep nine large signs and banners which it had posted around the store.
But planning bosses granted permission for only seven.
One of the residents opposing the application, Pete Prady, presented a petition of 25 signatures at a planning meeting.
Mr Prady, who lives in Canley Road, also showed the committee some photographs he had taken which showed the view from his front room where one of the large signs was visible.
He said: "It seems to me that Go Outdoors have a bombastic attitude towards their signage."
Go Outdoors is located on the old MFI site, near to Coventry Business Park. Although the store is not part of this development, existing businesses there have to adhere to strict signage and environmental rules.
Cllr Catherine Harper, of Earl-sdon ward, accused Go Outdoors of "making a mockery" of the council&ap
