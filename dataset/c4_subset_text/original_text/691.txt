Pauley Perrette is leaving "NCIS" after 16 years and 15 seasons. The actress, who played forensic specialist Abby Sciuto,  will sign off after the current season wraps.
On Wednesday, she cleared the air about her departure on Twitter and emphasized that there is no drama behind her decision.
She wrote: "There has been all kinds of false stories as to why (NO I DON'T HAVE A SKIN CARE LINE AND NO MY NETWORK AND SHOW ARE NOT MAD AT ME!) It was a decision made last year. I hope everyone will love and enjoy EVERYTHING ABBY not only for the rest of this season but for everything she has given all of us for 16 years. All the love, all the laughter, all the inspirationâ€¦I love her as much as you do."
Former "NCIS" cast member Lauren Holly tweeted, "You will be missed," while former cast member Sasha Alexander said, "I [love] you @PauleyP! What joy you brought to the world playing #AbbySciuto can't wait to see what's next! #ncis."
