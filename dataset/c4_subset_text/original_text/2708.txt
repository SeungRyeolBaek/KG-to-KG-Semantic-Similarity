City centre workers parking in Holbeck are causing stress for residents in the area, it has been claimed.
A group of residents, with support  from Holbeck councillor Gohar Almass launched a campaign on Friday to encourage non-residents to park elsewhere.
Following the introduction of a residents permit-only area to the east of Domestic Street in 2018, cars parking in the streets to the west and on Domestic Street itself have dramatically increased according to a residents' group.
People in the area have begun a campaign encouraging non-residents to use the Elland Road park and ride by leaving posters on offending vehicles.
A civil enforcement officer from Leeds Council attended a walkabout with Coun Almass and the residents' group on Friday morning.
Coun Almass said: "At the moment this area is not a residents permit only area so people are taking advantage of that loophole.
"I just want to encourage people to be considerate and empathetic.
"I would ask people, how would you feel if people used your street like a car park and blocked your access?"
