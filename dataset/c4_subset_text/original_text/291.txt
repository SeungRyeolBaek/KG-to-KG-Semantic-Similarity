It's a talented field and too close to call, but we're going to try.
To prepare for the 2019 Juno Awards, we're  breaking down each of the four classical categories.
Having already analyzed the large ensemble category, we now turn our attention to classical album of the year: solo or chamber.
Note how this category is a showdown this year between Analekta Records (three nominations) and Hyperion Records (two nominations). Whereas a number of the albums nominated in the large ensemble category are live recordings, all five nominees in the solo/chamber category are studio recordings, and the sound quality is consistently high. Two of the nominees are first-timers (Wan and Pouliot), Richard-Hamelin is enjoying his second nomination, while Gryphon Trio, Hamelin and Hewitt are Juno veterans with 11, 16 and 17 nominations, respectively.
It's a deserving bunch. Who's missing?
If there were room for a couple more nominees, we'd have liked to see Eybler Quartet's Beethoven String Quartets, Op. 18, Nos. 1-
