A day to celebrate education and reading was held in Fort Saskatchewan as students from St. John XXIII took part in a global event.
On  Friday, February 1, 2019, the students of St. John XXIII filled the gymnasium to listen to Principle Bonnie-Lynne Boehm read.
Boehm read “The Story Book Knight” by Helen and Thomas Docherty to the entire school.
Once the assembly in the gymnasium was complete students were broken into smaller reading groups.
The children were taken to a quiet place to enjoy more stories which were read to them by various staff members.
Isabella Morales is a student at St. John XXIII. Morales is very engaged in her studies and loves to read.
