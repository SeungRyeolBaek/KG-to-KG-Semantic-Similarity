It's hard out there for a lone Seahawks fan at a Packers-Cardinals game. It's late in the NFC playoff game at University of  Phoenix Stadium in Glendale on Saturday, where for some reason Cardinals fans don't take a liking to this one Seahawks fan and begin beating on him and placing him in headlocks.
It's hard to say what started this rumble, but it's the Seahawks fan who gets arrested and hauled off, despite the cameraman declaring that "I got it all on footage! He's the victim!"
The Seahawks fan then worries about his hat as he's being taken away. "It's a Seattle hat! It's important to me!"
And the cameraman is asked by security to come up to the office so that they can view the tape. This seems to be the proudest moment in the cameraman's life, judging by his commentary as he films himself leaving.
But the joke was on him. Just moments after he left his seat, Aaron Rodgers threw the Hail Mary pass that sent the game to overtime.
Police reported that there was no arrest involving the incident, so
