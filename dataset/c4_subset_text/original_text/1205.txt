New Hampshire’s tourism industry is gearing up for a strong Independence Day holiday weekend.
The state tourism forecast, produced by the Institute for  New Hampshire Studies, calls for more than 900,000 visitors over the three-day weekend, spending over $140 million.
Those numbers would be in line with the state's overall summer forecasts, which project a 3 percent rise in the number of visitors and the amount of money those visitors will spend over last year. Those forecasts are slightly higher than other recent projections.
Analysts say the increased amount of tourism is due in part to a stronger job market and gas prices that remain lower than those of recent years.
