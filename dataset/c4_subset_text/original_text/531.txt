So what are they doing about the latency problem with Sat internet connections?
Unless this is somehow addressed it won't get much of a foothold against  DSL or WIFI.
The average home user wants VOIP and gaming, latency critical apps.
"help make satellite a mainstream internet alternative"
Not unless they can do something about the 250ms latency imposed by the speed of light on a round trip to geostationary orbit. It's a great solution for folks who will never get a cable or DSL connexion, but it can never be a replacement for land-based technologies.
"The ViaSat-1 will have a throughput of about 100Gb/s... ViaSat claims the satellite will let distributors price a basic service at 2Mb/s... It's expected to be able to provide service to about two million subscribers."
So they're expecting to provide service of 1,000Gb/s (512Kb/s) to 4,000Gb/s (2Mb/s) from a 100Gb/s satellite? It's good to see the practice of massively overselling capacity
