Jamal Crawford scored 29 points and the host New York Knicks beat the Washington Wizards, 105-93, last night to give them consecutive victories for  only the third time this season.
Zach Randolph and Nate Robinson added 14 points apiece for the Knicks, who will go for their first three-game winning streak of the season tonight at New Jersey.
Two nights after an 89-65 victory over the Detroit Pistons, the Knicks built a 22-point lead in the first half, then turned back every push by Washington, which had won three straight.
Both Knicks victories came without starting point guard Stephon Marbury, who has bone spurs in his left ankle and will also miss tonight's game. He is scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging tomorrow that could determine whether he needs surgery.
Caron Butler scored 24 points and Antawn Jamison had 21 for the Wizards, who have played most of the season without All-Star Gilbert Arenas and last night had to go without his replacement, Antonio Daniels, who had a sore right knee. Roger Mason started at point guard and scored 20 points.
