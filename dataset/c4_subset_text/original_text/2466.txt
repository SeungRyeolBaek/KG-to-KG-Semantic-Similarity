The governing board of the University of Texas is expected to extend football head coach Mack Brown's contract by four years, through 2020, a well- placed source told the American-Statesman on Monday.
The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the source was not authorized to speak publicly, said Brown would continue to receive annual raises of $100,000. His current annual compensation is $5.2 million.
The UT System Board of Regents is scheduled to meet by telephone Thursday to consider changes in the contract, according to an announcement from the system.
A contract extension would be a signal to potential recruits that Brown isn't about to leave. But the regents are also expected to approve a provision that would in essence allow the university to dismiss Brown for $3.5 million with about six months' notice, the source said.
Brown, 60, went 8-5 last season, including a 21-10 victory over California at the Holiday Bowl. His team was 5-7 in 2010.
In his 14 years at Texas, Brown has compiled a 141-39 record, putting him 26 victories shy
