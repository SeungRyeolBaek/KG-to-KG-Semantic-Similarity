Gov. David A. Paterson has continually said he plans to run next year to keep the job he assumed after Gov. Eliot Spitzer� �s resignation. But first he will have to improve his standing with the public.
A Marist poll released Wednesday showed his approval rating at a dismal 20 percent. That is basically unchanged from a survey conducted by Marist in June, which had Mr. Paterson’s approval rating at 21 percent.
Seventy percent of those polled said Mr. Paterson should not even run next year.
Poll numbers continue to show Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo’s popularity as almost the opposite of Mr. Paterson’s, as expectations continue to rise that Mr. Cuomo will enter the governor’s race. Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is considering a gubernatorial bid, also has robust support; 58 percent of those surveyed believe he should run for governor.
Marist surveyed 805 registered voters across the state as part of the poll, which has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
