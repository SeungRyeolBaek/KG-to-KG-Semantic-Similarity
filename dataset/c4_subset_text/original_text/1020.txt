A new study of dogs published this week in Science offers a tantalising glimpse of how life-changing the gene-editing technology CRISPR  could be for some people in the near future. It suggests that CRISPR can be used to treat an otherwise incurable, fatal genetic disorder known as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
DMD is the most common form of muscular dystrophy, a blanket term for conditions that progressively destroy muscle throughout the body. This wasting away is primarily caused by the inability to use dystrophin, a protein that acts as a glue to stabilise muscle fibre.
These conditions are often caused by a genetic defect, and people with DMD have mutations in the gene responsible for dystrophin that prevent them from making any at all.
Because the dystrophin gene is found on the X chromosome, DMD primarily affects boys, since girls typically have two X chromosomes, and one healthy copy of the dystrophin gene is usually enough to prevent serious disease (women can still be carriers and pass on the disease to their sons though).
The symptoms
