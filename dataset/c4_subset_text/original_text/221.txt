It’s a 100,000-Pound Challenge, and no,it’s not a townwide weight-loss promotion,  but an endeavor give our community’s neediest neighbors access to some healthy calories.
Organized by the borough-based nonprofit Lunch Break, the 2015 edition of Foodstock brings the community food drive back to Red Bank Middle School Saturday for a morning and afternoon of refreshments, live entertainment and children’s activities.
Scheduled for 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., the family-friendly event comes equipped this year with the stated collection goal of 100,000 pounds, an ambitious benchmark aimed at helping replenish the in-demand resources of Lunch Break— an organization that acts as the first line of defense for thousands of vulnerable Red Bank-area residents, and serves more and more people each year.
