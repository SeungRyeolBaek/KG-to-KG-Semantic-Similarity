The state House is poised to vote this week on a bill that would privatize the sale of liquor and spirits in Pennsylvania.
In its first  significant piece of business in the 2015-16 legislative session, the state House of Representatives is poised to vote this week on a bill that would get the state out of the liquor business. But some wonder how many legislators casting votes really know what the bill would do.
House Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, said it's time to get state government out of the liquor business, but some question if he knows exactly what his bill that would accomplish that actually does.
Rep. Mike Sturla, D-Lancaster, and a union official suggest even the bill's sponsor, House Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, seems confused about what's in the legislation based on comments he made during a recent PCN Call-in Program.
"It'd be interesting if the people who are voting on the bill had to take a test and had to get a passing grade before they could vote yes, I think it wouldn't pass," Sturla said.
