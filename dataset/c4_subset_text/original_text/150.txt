Welcome back to “ATWT” fan fiction, where we are writing stories about the characters we miss from Springfield. We hope you enjoy  us bringing these beloved characters back to life. Please feel free to read our last ATWT fan fiction story before reading on.
Jeffrey hides unknown in a closet in the estate that he tracked Edmund to in San Cristobel. He wonders if it was Tammy he saw, or some trick that Edmund is trying to pull. Jeffrey knows he has to get inside the room to see for himself. He waits in the dark until he hears Edmund and the nurse leave. Jeffrey quietly walks into the room where he saw Tammy sleeping. As he approaches her bedside, the young woman sleeping appears to be Tammy, at least in looks. Her eyes begin to flutter and before he can escape, her eyes open and look directly at him. “Tammy,” is all he can muster up to say. Tammy smiles and says, “Richard.” Jeffrey gets closer and takes her hand. “Are you here to rescue me,” a groggy Tammy asks.
