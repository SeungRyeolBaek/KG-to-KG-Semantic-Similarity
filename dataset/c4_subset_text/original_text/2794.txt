The City Municipal Council has a “tradition” of replacing the presidents at least once in every six months. Raveesh had  become the president following swift political development (Operation Kamala), ten months ago. He ditched Congress for BJP and captured power with the support of “like-minded” members.
The previous incumbents, Aslam Pasha of Congress and Ole Chandraiah of JD(S) were unseated as president and vice-president respectively, also by a no confidence motion. In fact, Raveesh was rewarded with the president’s post by BJP, JD(S) and Congress members for his role in the entire exercise. Surprisingly, he has been dethroned without allowing even one year in power.
A total of 28 members (12 of Congress, six each from BJP and JDS, and four Independents) in the 35-member body had decided to move no confidence motion and accordingly, a meeting was called on Monday. Seven councillors and the legislator who didn’t subscribe to the motion stayed away from the meeting.
