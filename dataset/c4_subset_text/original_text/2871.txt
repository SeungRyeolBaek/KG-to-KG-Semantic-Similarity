Rick Ross knows how to party. The Maybach Music mogul celebrated his 41st birthday like a boss, with a lavish masquerade ball at his  mansion in Fayetteville, Ga. over the weekend.
The star-studded bash was attended by Renzel’s MMG family, including Meek Mill, who showed up in a ski mask and Wale, who popped up in all black. Other rappers also stopped by, including YG, Jeezy, Outkast’s Big Boi, Big K.R.I.T., DeJ Loaf, Yung Dolph, and Curren$y.
