The Economic Cycle Research Institute has had a knack for calling tops in the business cycle, and accurately forecasting recessions. It saw the slump coming in  the early 2000s, and the methodology it uses anticipated similar activity in the 80s and 90s recessions. At this point, the economy is at a proverbial fork, or crossroads, and the institute says there&apos;s a 50-50 chance of a recession in the next year. Meanwhile, with the economy at a fork, the Fed finds itself fractured. The minutes to its last meeting reveal broad dissent over the direction of the economy. It&apos;s too bad there has to be just one answer. Perhaps the optimists could just go their way, and the pessimists the other, and both deal with the consequences.
