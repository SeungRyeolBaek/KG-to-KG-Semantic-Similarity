Mike Huckabee reacted Sunday on "Fox & Friends" to former Secretary of State John Kerry holding private meetings with Iranian officials.
Former Secretary of State  John Kerry is being slammed for conducting shadow diplomacy with Iran after admitting to multiple meetings with Iranian officials behind the backs of Trump administration officials -- including over the scrapped nuclear deal.
An administration official on Thursday told Fox News Kerryâ€™s meetings are "shameful," pointing out what Iranian-backed militias are doing to kill and injure people in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
Other Republicans suggested it may not even be legal.
"John Kerry is the only guy I know who wants to bring back the Edsel, MySpace and other failed enterprises," Huckabee (R-Ark.) remarked. "What he is doing is not funny."
Huckabee said Kerry could be suited for the first successful prosecution of the Logan Act of 1799, which prohibits conducting unauthorized diplomacy with governments in dispute with the United States.
The act's name refers to a 1798 incident in which Philadelphia farmer George Logan traveled to France, outside the purview of President John Adams, to try to avoid war
