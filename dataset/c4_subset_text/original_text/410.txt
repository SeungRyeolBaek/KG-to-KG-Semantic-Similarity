MGM Resorts International (MGM), the largest casino and hotel operator on the Las Vegas Strip, is looking for a rebound in the famed  gambling resort.
MGM’s Vegas properties include the Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, and The Mirage. The Strip accounts for 74 percent of the company’s revenue, and both convention business and consumer travel to Las Vegas suffered during the recession. MGM would greatly benefit, of course, from a sustained U.S. recovery.
About 20 percent of the company’s cash flow now comes from Macau, a special administrative region of China, and the casino business there is going gangbusters, Morningstar reports. Betting in Macau surged 45 percent in the first 10 months of 2011.
In June, MGM gained a majority stake in a joint venture MGM China Holdings that owns the MGM Macau, a casino and resort. Earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation (EBITDA) for MGM China soared 65 percent in the third quarter to $139 million, compared to a year earlier.
