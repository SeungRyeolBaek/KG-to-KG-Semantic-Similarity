Which Irish names are making a comeback?
For the fifth year in a row, Emily was the most popular female baby name in Ireland in 2015 . Emily finished the year ahead of Emma, Ava, Sophie and Amelia – rounding out the top five – and is again number one among girls’ baby names. Emily has ruled the roost without interruption since 2010.
Jack, again, took the crown on the male list as it has for the past eight years. Apart from slight changes in the order, the top five male baby names in 2015 – Jack, James, Daniel, Conor and Sean – are exactly as they have been since 2007. Only one new name has even made even the top 100 boys’ list. As it happens, four out of five of the top five male names have remained in the top five since 1998, almost two whole decades.
George has leaped in popularity both last year and this year, probably thanks to England’s Prince George who probably has won some fans in Ireland based on the number of new-born baby boys sharing his name. George rose from 103rd to 90th.
