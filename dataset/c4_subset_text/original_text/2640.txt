Boeing (NYSE: BA), which has come under criticism from Pentagon officials over delays to the KC-46 refueling tanker, is rev amping its defense unit in a bid to better manage the tanker and other weapons programs and improve its reputation.
The first batch of tankers, originally slated for delivery last August, are now supposed to arrive before year&apos;s end, but Air Force officials have expressed concern that the timetable will slip into 2019. The Pentagon says there are still major deficiencies that must be worked out before deliveries can begin, including issues with the tanker&apos;s remote-vision system that have caused the refueling boom to scratch fighters.
"One of our frustrations with Boeing is they&apos;re much more focused on their commercial activity than on getting this right for the Air Force, and getting these aircraft to the Air Force," Wilson said, adding that Air Force officials held face-to-face meetings with Boeing in recent weeks about the KC-46, and that "we have asked them to put their A-team on this to get the problems fixed."
