KITT.AI wants to help developers add voice activation features to almost any device for free.
The Seattle startup today unveiled its first software tool kit called Snowboy, which lets developers add verbal “hotword detection” to devices. It’s the same technology that tech giants like Amazon and Apple use for products like Alexa and Siri, but now KITT.AI is enabling anyone to easily add the functionality to their own hardware.
The idea is to let users talk to devices in order to “wake” or “command” them to do something. Snowboy uses deep neural network technology that learns and recognizes unique patterns in voices. It also utilizes sophisticated audio processing techniques and can work without an internet connection.
KITT.AI, originally incubated inside Paul Allen’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), launched last year and in January landed funding from Founders’ Co-op and Amazon’s Alexa Fund. It also recently received investment from Madrona Venture Group and the startup currently works at the firm’s downtown Seattle office.
