Foxy Brown’s lawyer has responded to allegations by a book publishing company that’s suing her client over non-delivery of  a book, for which she received an advance.
As previously reported, Simon and Schuster are suing Brown to retrieve a $75,000 advance they say she was given in 2004 to write a book entitled ‘Broken Silence’.
They say Brown, whose real name is Inga Marchand, did not write the book and they want their money back.
