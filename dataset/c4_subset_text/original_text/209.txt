Mick Foley Talks Why Daughter Noelle Isn't Pursuing A WWE Career - Wrestling Inc.
Even during his various hiatuses from WWE , Mick Foley has never strayed far from the WWE Universe. From 2016-17 Foley's family was depicted on the WWE Network show, Holy Foley! The show was received favorably but hasn't had any new episodes in nearly two years. Foley joined Andy Malnoske of Wrestling Inc where he discussed the current status of Holy Foley!
"We really enjoyed doing itâ€¦ But it was an expensive show for the [WWE] Network to make, and when you look at some of their other shows, it's a GoPro on a windshield," Foley said referring to Ride Along.
"I think if this was a show that was on USA or E!, there probably would have been a better home because you could have a big budget for it. It would have found fans who are not WWE loyalists. I think Total Bellas has probably half of their viewership who are not actively watching wrestling.
"I was glad they took a chance on it. We really enjoyed those 10 weeks together
