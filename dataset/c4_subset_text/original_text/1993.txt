Andrew Ferguson resigned from the role of CFO at Ruralco Holdings Limited on 30 July.
Having been in the CFO role for more than  eight years, Ferguson worked for NRMA Tourism and Leisure and Jetset Travelworld Group before joining Ruralco Holdings Limited in April 2012.
The resignation follows on from Ruralco’s offer to acquire Elders Rural Services which was rejected in June by the Elders Board.
“The Elders Board has rejected a bid for its Rural Services business, while it has entered into final negotiations for the sale of Futuris Automotive (Futuris),” Elders said in a statement in June.
In July, Ruralco entered into a 50:50 joint venture with global agribusiness CHS to help operate and grow its grain marketing business Agfarm.
Ruralco’s managing director, John Maher, thanked Ferguson for his service of 16 months as CFO.
The company is currently working with Hattonneale to search for a new CFO and has appointed someone internally to act in the role during the interim.
