How it feels when J.K. Rowling gives us more "Harry Potter" information.
J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter"  universe is enormous. And since closing the book on the main series in 2007, she keeps adding to it. There are spinoff books, movies, and a play in the franchise â€” many of which reveal new insight about Harry, Ron, Hermione, and other characters from the original series.
The wealth of "Harry Potter" material also means that there's a wealth of behind-the-scenes information that yields new details of how J.K. Rowling thought up the books, how the filmmakers made the movies, and a ton of other information about the "Harry Potter" universe.
