The hottest day of 2018 was a bad day for a power failure at The Bridge homeless shelter in downtown Dallas.
A power transformer burst into flames  shortly before 4 p.m. in a parking lot near the shelter in the 1800 block of Corsicana Street, authorities said.
There were no injuries, but with temperatures hovering around triple digits, the shelter had to transfer its guests from its suddenly stifling facility to The Stewpot, another downtown shelter.
About 250 occupants and 12 dogs were evacuated from the shelter, Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans said.
Initial repairs might be completed by late Sunday morning, said Sam Merten, chief operating officer of The Bridge.
"But then there's going to be additional damage to our system, which may take another two to three days," he said.
Merten said the shelter is working with its partners, including the city, to ensure that everyone's needs are met.
"Fortunately no one's going to go without shelter, which is always important but particularly important when it's this hot outside," he said.
The fire never reached the shelter
