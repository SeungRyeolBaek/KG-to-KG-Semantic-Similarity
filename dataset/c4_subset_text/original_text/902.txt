The Weather Channel is getting action-packed to advertise its Groundhog Day coverage. The cinematic legacy of the holiday known as Groundhog Day is wrapped  up almost entirely in one film: the 1993 Bill Murray classic called, yes, Groundhog Day. The film was directed by Harold Ramis and starred Murray as a local TV weatherman Phil Connors, doomed to relive Groundhog Day over and over again in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Groundhog Day was a sizable hit at the time, but has only grown in esteem in the years since, to everyone from critics to Bill Murray acolytes to dorm-room philosophers.
In the years since, of course, no one has attempted another film centered around Groundhog Dog, despite always-false rumors of an impending sequel. But with the actual Groundhog Day approaching this Friday, another arm of the weather industry is giving us a look at what a Groundhog Day action movie might look like.
We Love Weather, a Twitter account associated with the Weather Channel, has released a mock action movie trailer for the Weather Channelâ€™s Groundhog Day coverage on its morning show
