If you love NBA stars who do awesome things for their fans, then get ready to smile.
Nine-year-old DeSean Pollis  adores the Golden State Warriors, but since November he’s had to watch every game from his bed in a hospital. Of course, it wasn’t long before reigning MVP Stephen Curry heard that one of his biggest fans was sick, and on Monday night he did something amazing: Curry scored 31 points to go with six assists and two boards in an authoritative 111-103 victory over the Miami Heat.
Yup. Curry was 4 for 11 from beyond the arc and 5 for 7 from the line in 38 minutes of playing time.
DeSean cheered louder than ever as he watched what proved to be a wire-to-wire victory for the Warriors, who were able to hold off a challenge from Miami in the fourth quarter when Curry hit a crucial three. He then hit another with under 30 seconds to play that put the game permanently out of reach for Miami, who were playing without injured center Hassan Whiteside.
Curry committed only one turnover and stayed out of foul trouble
