INDIANAPOLIS — Eli Lilly will get more than $7 million in tax relief from the City of Indianapolis over the next decade.
 The Indianapolis City-County Council approved Monday night about $7.1 million in tax abatements to the pharmaceutical company over the next 10 years. The abatements come as part of a multimillion-dollar investment into a building on Eli Lilly’s campus near Kentucky Avenue.
The investment is a $91 million expansion to the Lilly Technology Center – South first announced in 2017. It includes more than 22,000 square feet of building retrofit and 12,000 square feet of new building construction.
The proposal for the abatements passed the full council 19-6. Those who voted no were Democrats Zach Adamson, Stephen Clay, Jared Evans and Christina Scales. The Republicans who voted no were Marilyn Pfisterer and Susie Cordi.
Adamson was the lone councilor who voted no on the proposal when it was in committee a week ago. At the time, there was still confusion on how much the Eli Lilly custodial staff is being paid.
