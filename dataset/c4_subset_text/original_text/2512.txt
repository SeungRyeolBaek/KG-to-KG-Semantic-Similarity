We’ll be seeing Arrested Development season 5 sooner than expected. A lot sooner – as in this month. Netflix just released an Arrest ed Development season 5 trailer which reveals a May 29 release date.
Netflix dropped a surprise Arrested Development season 4 remix over the weekend, but that’s not the last we’ll see of the Bluths this month. The official Arrested Development season 5 trailer is here, and it reveals a May 29, 2018 premiere date.
This trailer starts off like a greatest hits compliation, taking us through some of the best moments of previous seasons before launching into new material. That new material hints at a plotline involving the Bluths giving themselves an award. There’s also a quick shot revealing Portia de Rossi‘s character Lindsay is running for Congress.
The question now is: are you still excited for a new season of Arrested Development? Personally speaking, I’m not entirely optimistic about more misadventures with the Bluths. While the original run of the series will always be a classic, and the cast remains very talented
