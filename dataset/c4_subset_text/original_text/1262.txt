The former stripper indicted for allegedly extorting Mark Jackson over naked photos the NBA coach sent to her has struck a deal with federal prosecutors to settle  a pair of felony charges, records show.
Alexis Adams, who was facing a May 3 trial date, has “reached an agreement in principle” to enter a pretrial diversion program that would allow the 29-year-old’s case to be “resolved short of trial,” according to a U.S. District Court filing.
A stipulation signed by Adams’s lawyer and a federal prosecutor notes that Pretrial Services officials will evaluate Adams for acceptance into the diversion program, a process that takes at least 60 days. If a defendant--usually a first-time offender--successfully completes the diversion program, prosecutors will formally drop charges against them.
Last month, Adams’s codefendant, ex-con Marcus Shaw, pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired with Adams to shake down Jackson over the explicit images. Jackson shared the photos with Adams during the course of an extramarital affair about seven years ago,
