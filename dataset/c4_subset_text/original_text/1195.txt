UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENTS: DE Ziggy Ansah, DT Ricky Jean Francois, LB Eli Harold, RB Zach Zenner,  TE Levine Toilolo, TE Luke Willson, WR TJ Jones, CB DeShawn Shead, RB LeGarrette Blount, WR Bruce Ellington, FB Nick Bellore, QB Matt Cassel, OL Andrew Donnal, LB Kelvin Sheppard, CB Marcus Cooper, OG T.J.

AVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $35 million, which Lions say is most team has had in GM Bob
