Spring Art Classes | Art Supply Lists | Kids Create Dates | Art & Story Stroll | SHORTS!
Our hands-on art classes are  taught by artist-teachers, and frequently inspired by art on view in the museum. We teach, inspire, challenge, and encourage all ages. We love it when you make the artwork you never thought you could make.
Our fabulous all-day school break and summer art camps are designed for children ages 6–12.
Kids enjoy high quality (and very fun) art projects, visits to the museum to see original works of art, lunch breaks, and daily recreation breaks.
Two age groupings—6–8 (junior) and 9–12 (senior)—allow kids to learn about art techniques, strategies, and materials as they make art they can be proud of.
Information & registration available here.
During the summer, we also will be running two collaborative camps with Writers & Books for kids who love to draw and write! For more about these camps (Telling Tales and Your Incredible Illustrated Story), call or email Rachael | 585.276
