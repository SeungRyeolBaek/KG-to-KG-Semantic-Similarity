High fashion hits Bellevue this week as Front Row Fashion event unfolds at the Bellevue Collection. This is Bellevue’s signature fashion event .
Fashion Week is presented by Vogue Magazine, and this, it’s second year, will be better than ever with all sorts of events for you to attend.
Last evening’s Cocktails at Tiffany’s proved to be a wonderful kick off to get this party started.
Attendees got in the mood to shop while sipping the Bradshaw, a cocktail with sugar rimmed around the glass..delicious!
Tiffany’s Bellevue Square is such a crowd pleaser with classic styling and the launch of their new leather goods line. I fell in love with the Tiffany blue clutch purse.
The ladies were out on the town and we all were coveting the jewelry, purses, and other items.
Puget Sound Business Journal writer Patti Payne was in the house shopping with her Tiffany clad dog Pepper in tow.
I have to admit, cocktails at Tiffany’s sure beats breakfast at Tiffany�
