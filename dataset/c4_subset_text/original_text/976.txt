MEXICO CITY â€“ A senior U.S. official says there is strong circumstantial evidence that Mexican federal police who fired on a U .S. Embassy vehicle, wounding two CIA officers, were working for organized crime in a targeted assassination attempt.
"That&apos;s not a &apos;We&apos;re trying to shake down a couple people for a traffic violation sort of operation. That&apos;s a &apos;We are specifically trying to kill the people in this vehicle&apos;," a U.S. official familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press. "This is not a &apos;Whoops, we got the wrong people.&apos; "
The Mexican official said one line of investigation is that members of the Beltran Leyva Cartel were interested in attacking the people in the car because some of their lookouts had seen them passing through the area and presumed they were investigating the cartel. It&apos;s possible they didn&apos;t know they were Americans.
