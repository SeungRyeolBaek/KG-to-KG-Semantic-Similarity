Earlier this week, a member of the Boca Raton Beach Club said Dardano and Kiffin have become fixtures on the clubâ€™ s exclusive piece of the beach.
FAU has put up Kiffin at the swanky nearby Boca Raton Resort & Club while he looks for a house.
When reached at her office, Dardano played coy after admitting she and the coach were introduced by mutual friends.
They do, meanwhile, have plenty in common.
Both are just divorced and 41.
Dardano went to University of Southern California, where Kiffin coached until he was fired in an airport in the middle of the night on an airport tarmac in 2013.
And they both need what the other provides: a higher business profile for Dardano, who sells multi-million-dollar houses; and a semblance of stability for the coach.
After incidents like an infamous mystery-shrouded car crash in Tennessee in 2009, Kiffin drags behind him a reputation as a party animal and womanizer. A story about several appearances by Kiffin with the same lady might actually make news
