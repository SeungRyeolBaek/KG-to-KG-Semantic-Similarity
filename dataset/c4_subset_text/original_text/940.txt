WHAT would you do if you came upon a fight between a violent attacker and a weaker victim? Would you intervene? Go for help? Or merely  join the crowd of onlookers? Now that you’ve determined your answer, think a bit deeper. Is that really what you would do, or is it only what you think you would do? It’s a question that plagues morality research&colon; how do we differentiate moral behaviour from moral judgement when the hypothetical dilemma cannot be replicated without risk of harm to the participants?
Enter immersive virtual reality (IVR). Though you might think people would act differently in virtual situations, studies consistently show that they react just as they would in real life, as long as the environments seem realistic enough.
For example, Mel Slater of the University of Barcelona, Spain, and University College London, has used IVR to recreate some of psychology’s most controversial experiments, including the 1960s obedience experiments by Stanley Milgram in which participants were instructed by an authority to administer what they believed were real electric shocks to other study participants.
