RICHMOND HILL - A Bryan County inmate temporarily released to be treated for a spider bite has returned to the Southeast Probation Detention Center  in Claxton to continue serving his 30-month sentence.
Jack Barfield IV, 20, was convicted March 14 on all charges stemming from a wreck on April 25, 2005, that killed Ginger Reagin and her son Garrett, 5.
Barfield was released from the detention center May 17 by court order to seek treatment from Dr. Anthony Sussman of the Savannah Vascular Institute. He was twice granted extensions for additional treatment, but he was to return to custody Wednesday.
"He surrendered to the Bryan County Sheriff's Department on June 20," Barfield's attorney, Lloyd Murray, said Friday. "His condition had improved to the point that remaining outside for treatment was no longer necessary."
Barfield and his girlfriend, Emily Mosely, were racing each other on U.S. 80, court records show, when Barfield's Chevy Tahoe swerved into the oncoming lane and slammed head-on into Reagin's vehicle.
