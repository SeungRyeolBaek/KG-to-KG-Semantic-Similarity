One of the two aggressor squadrons at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, has deactivated.
The 65th Aggressor Squadron  at Nellis, which flew F-15s, was deactivated Sept. 26, according to the Air Force. This means that Nellis will only have one squadron, the 64th Aggressor Squadron, to serve as adversaries during the large-scale Red Flag exercises at the base, along with Weapons School training. The squadron helped train pilots in F-22s, F-35s, F-15s, F-16s and F/A-18s.
“It’s been a great asset for the U.S. Air Force Warfare Center to be able to have the F-15 Eagles here as an aggressor squadron for almost a decade now,” said Lt. Col. Gregory Wintill, commander of the 65th Aggressor Squadron, in a news release.
The squadron’s F-15s will be assigned to other squadrons throughout the Air Force. Pilots in the 65th will continue their work
