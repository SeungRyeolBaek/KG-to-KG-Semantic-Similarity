A dying man in Nebraska was comforted by 3,500 strangers he never knew as his family kicked off the #SkyBluePink campaign after he  was diagnosed with lung cancer.
Brian Curtis decided to forgo chemotherapy, as he also suffered from Parkinson’s disease, and doctors gave him about a year to live.
His son Brandon, 30 started the #SkyBluePink campaign to bring comfort to Brian during his last very painful days and he got an incredible response. Sky Blue Pink is a color Brian Curtis’ mother used to describe the way the sky looked during a sunrise or sunset.
Brandon lives in Los Angeles and traveled for business frequently. When Brian was first diagnosed he came home to spend time with his dying father, but encouraged by him decided to go back to his normal life.
Communication between the two was frequent, via Skype, after dad found out the grim news on April 24, 2012 during a business trip in Austria.
At that point the dying man had six months to live. This was not the first family member was lost because of a deadly disease.
