Carly Howe scored off an assist from Ashlyn Nelson early in overtime on Saturday to lift the Douglas girls lacrosse team to a dramatic 13- 12 win at home against Spanish Springs.
Douglas surged to a 10-7 halftime lead and then wrapped up its High Sierra Lacrosse League win 1 minute, 35 seconds into the sudden death overtime at Gardnerville Elementary School. Nelson, an eighth grader, received a pass and then relayed the ball to Howe for the game-winning shot.
The Tigers were coming off a closely contested 8-5 loss on Friday on the Gardnerville Elementary field. Peri Buck scored a goal in the final 15 seconds before halftime to tie the score at 5-all going to the intermission.
The first-year Douglas club team is now 3-9 for its season with a home game Friday at 5 p.m. against Truckee and Saturday at 10 a.m. against Coyote (McQueen).
Note: Douglas also will be hosting a fundraiser at Yogurt Beach, located on Waterloo Lane next to Lampe Park, from 10:30 a.m.
