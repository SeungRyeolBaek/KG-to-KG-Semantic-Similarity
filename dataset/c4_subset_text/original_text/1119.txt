After three days of closed door meetings — so closed that the principals had to sign confidentiality agreements —Star Tribune management and labor just issued a joint statement  about the discussions.
Labor is, of course, a major expense. (And, we should note, a major asset.) Strib Newspaper Guild co-chair Graydon Royce said layoffs weren’t mentioned in what he described as “introductory” sessions. But don’t be too reassured, Strib workers: Specific cuts didn’t come up at all. Still, I’m told management is looking for substantial expense cuts throughout the company by early summer.
What is different about the current skein of meetings is that it’s not classic bargaining: The Strib imported Restructuring Associates Inc. as a mediator to find a common way forward before the union’s contract expires this summer. Formal bargaining will commence at some point. Next week, union leadership will meet with Strib employees to assess whether they should participate in this pre-bargaining or go right to the mattresses.
