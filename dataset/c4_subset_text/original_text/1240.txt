What does it mean to Dharyus Thomas to be the first area boys’ basketball players of the year from Southwest since Jamaal Williams was  named the best in 2010?
The senior certainly had several big moments this past season.
Thomas scored at least 20 points in 11 games and had a trio of 30-plus point efforts en route to finishing with an 18.6 point per game average.
But he wasn’t just a scorer. Thomas also spearheaded the Stallions’ defense with 1.9 steals to go along with 2.3 assists and 4.8 rebounds.
And because of his efforts, Thomas is The Daily News player of the year for the 2018-19 boys’ basketball season.
White Oak’s Derreco Miller (13.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists) was also considered for the honor, but the 17-year-old Thomas got the edge following votes received by the coaches and the newspaper’s sports staff.
Southwest coach Eric Kliewer said Thomas was well-deserving to be player of the year.
