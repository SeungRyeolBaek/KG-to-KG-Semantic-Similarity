Have you ever wondered why rocks margaritas tasted more  alcoholic than frozen margaritas? Or whether one had more overall ice and water than the other?
Like many restaurants in Austin, El Mercado serves margaritas both on the rocks (poured over cubes of ice) and frozen. We talked with a chemist at the University of Texas about the scientific differences between the two types of cocktails. Photo by Deborah Cannon for the Austin American-Statesman.
Kate Biberdorf let me ask her all kinds of questions about ice shape and size, ethanol and heat, and her answers are in this story that is running in tomorrow’s paper.
You’ll note that the rocks margarita has double the alcohol per serving. If you poured that much booze into a frozen margarita, all the ice crystals would melt even faster than they already do.
