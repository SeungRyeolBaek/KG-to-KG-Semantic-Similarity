Oracle plans to get rid of over 350 employees in the coming months as the database giant attempts to transform itself for an enterprise world dominated by Amazon Web  Services (AWS).
As reported by Bloomberg, Oracle disclosed the impending cuts in a notice filed last week with California's Employment Development Department. The company will dismiss 255 employees from its Redwood City headquarters and 97 employees from its Santa Clara offices in May.
Some of the job cuts affect workers from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) unit, the company's infrastructure-as-a-service offering for outsourced compute, storage, and network resources.
The headcount reduction is relatively small for a company that employs just under 140,000 people globally. The company says the intent is to focus resources on its cloud business.
"As our cloud business grows, we will continually balance our resources and restructure our development group to help ensure we have the right people delivering the best cloud products to our customers around the world," an Oracle spokesperson said.
Earlier this month Oracle reported that its fiscal Q3 2019 revenues were down one percent to $9.6bn.
