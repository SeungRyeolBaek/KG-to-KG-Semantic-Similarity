Bhubaneswar: As the Indian Meteorology Department (IMD) predicted heavy to very heavy rains in the city for over next 36 to  48 hours or even more, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) along with other line departments chalked out a strategy to fight water logging and urban flooding situation across the State Capital.
BMC Commissioner Dr. Krishan Kumar convened the multi-department emergency meeting at the BMC Conference Room in the evening and briefed the senior officials to be vigilant the next 36 hours and work in tandem with the strategy and the experiences gathered from the last water-logging situations.
The Municipal Commissioner also added that off day and leave of all staff of BMC and BDA remained cancelled so that better coordination would be done to face the situation in the city.
The BMC and Odisha Fire Services have pre-positioned nearly 30 water pumps at vulnerable locations across the city, where the rest 22 are for the developing situation as rains have started across the city after evening hours. Both the agencies have 52 pumps (BMC 19 and Fire Services 33) pumps with them to face the situation.
