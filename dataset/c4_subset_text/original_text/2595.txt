Suffolk County police are rejoining the FBI’s Long Island Gang Task Force following three Central Islip murders in two days last week , effectively reversing a decision to quit the collaboration last fall.
Chief of Department James Burke announced the policy backtrack Monday at the Third Precinct in Bay Shore while outlining that and other steps police have been taking to address the slayings—two of which detectives have said they suspect involve gangs.
