A look at Fremont9, the newest downtown residential project on Fremont Street and 9th Street, Tuesday, Sept. 18, 2018. 
The Downtown Project’s quest to revitalize downtown Las Vegas has always been hampered by a lack of available housing.
Fremont9, a five-story mid-rise that offers 232 residential units and 15,000 square feet of retail space in downtown’s East Village District, could help change that. Amid construction and preparations for this weekend’s Life is Beautiful festival, a group of developers on Tuesday morning cut the ribbon on a new luxury apartment tower.
Rent at Fremont9 ranges from $845 per month for a 395-square-foot studio to $3,961 per month for a 1,330-square-foot three-bedroom apartment. Parking is extra, but residents who fully embrace the Fremont9 ethos won’t be driving that much anyway.
If it seems unusual to have a music festival going up across the street from a housing complex, that’s a feature not a bug of Fremont9.
