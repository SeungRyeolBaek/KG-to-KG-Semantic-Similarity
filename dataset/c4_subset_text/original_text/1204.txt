A council is considering having larger English and maths classes to help it balance its budget.
The proposal for larger classes in the first and second year  of secondary school comes from East Renfrewshire Council.
The council says having bigger classes could help it save nearly £750,000.
Overall, the local authority aims to save £8m from its education budget by 2018.
It currently has an average of 20 students in S1 and S2 English and maths classes - well below the national average.
A relatively prosperous area, East Renfrewshire has some of the most academically successful state schools in Scotland.
In its budget consultation, the council says: "This proposal will bring East Renfrewshire Council in line with many other Scottish councils and will increase class size to 30.
"We are confident that attainment will not be affected by this proposal and will continue to focus on improving the quality of our teaching and learning experiences to maximise pupil attainment and not class size."
A series of proposed cuts and savings to the education budget is detailed in the council's ongoing consultation on ways to save money between now
