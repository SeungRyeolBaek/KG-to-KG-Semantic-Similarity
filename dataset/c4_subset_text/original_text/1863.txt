If you could take a deep-dive into any particular concept, topic, idea or strategy during our time together, what would it be? 
If you could design your ideal three-day experience, what objective would you want to achieve for yourself by the end of it?
What is the one topic, tool, concept, idea, or strategy that will cause you to roll your eyes and wish that you could sneak out of the workshop never to return again?
Answers to the last question proved to be fascinating as they clustered around three themes: no more "collaboration," enough with the talk about "growth mindset," and NO EduSpeak. I really liked the last comment as it seemed to eloquently sum up the underlying issues with the first two. This group of teacher-leaders did not want three days of flowery language that had little meaning and could not be acted upon. On the first morning, I made the group a promise: we would not use any terms that we could not define in an actionable way.
Few terms have achieved the state of "buzzword-ness" as innovation.
