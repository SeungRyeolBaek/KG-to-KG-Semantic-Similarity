There is more to the holiday season than searching for the best deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
SANTA ROSA BEACH � There  is more to the holiday season than searching for the best deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Nineteen local nonprofit groups are teaming up to promote Giving Tuesday, an effort to harness the collective power of charities, families, businesses and individuals to transform how people think about, talk about and participate in the giving season.
Giving Tuesday will be Dec. 3, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. It will use social media to create a national campaign around the holidays dedicated to giving.
Shelter House and Food For Thought learned about Giving Tuesday and wanted to be part of the movement. The leaders of those organizations reached out to other non-profits to join.
