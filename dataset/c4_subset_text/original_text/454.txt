Decision trees help people identify the pros and cons of business choices.
A decision tree is a visual tool used to help business professionals weigh the  pros, cons and various approaches to major tasks or decisions.

This type of approach is highly effective when used in brainstorming sessions and strategic planning meetings.

Create the core or “trunk” for the tree using a whiteboard or large paper flipchart that is easy to write on and is visible to all participants. In the center of the core, briefly summarize the decision to be made. For example, if you are thinking about diversifying your product offerings, you would write “New product development?” in the core.
From the core of your tree, draw two main “branches” or lines that represent the pros and cons of the decision. Using the example of a new product introduction, pros might include increased earnings, entry into new markets and portfolio
