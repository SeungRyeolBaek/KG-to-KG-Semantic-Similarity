Lance Cooley, an expert in applied superconductivity, who was recruited to Florida State University in 2017, has been named head of the  MagLab’s Applied Superconductivity Center.
Cooley came to the MagLab from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or “Fermilab”, near Chicago. He also holds a faculty appointment in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering.
Cooley succeeds David Larbalestier, who will remain the chief scientist for materials at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and a professor in the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, according to FSU.
Cooley worked under Larbalestier as a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin. He later worked at National Institute of Standards and Technology, University of Wisconsin and Brookhaven National Lab, the university said.
“These are exciting times for the field of superconductivity, and Lance is the perfect person to take the helm and lead ASC as the MagLab realizes the next generation of superconducting magnets,” Mag
