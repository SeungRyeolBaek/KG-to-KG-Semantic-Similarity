Meet Newsday's All-Long Island boys tennis first team for the 2017 spring season.
Long Island Player of the Year: Yuval Solomon , Plainview-Old Bethpage JFK, Sr.
Solomon capped a historic varsity run with a second straight state championship. Only six other Nassau County boys tennis players have won multiple state titles. The Wake Forest commit rolled over every opponent in his path, never losing a set or more than four games during the state tournament.
"When he came here the first day, he was hitting the ball four times in a game," coach Nick Ventimiglia said. "It was ace, ace, ace ace." Solomon, who was the state runner-up as a sophomore and the consolation runner-up as a freshman, went 73-2 over his last three seasons. He also reached the state tournament as part of a doubles team in eighth grade.
"It's been a pleasure playing high school tennis," Solomon said. "Five years at the state tournament, six years on varsity tennis, and it's just great."
