The NBA is taking a rare day off on Thanksgiving, which should at least satisfy Stan Van Gundy. But for diehard fans, getting through  the holiday will be a struggle.
At ThePostGame, we are doing our part to entertain you... by matching Thanksgiving foods with the personality of NBA players. That means entrees, sides, desserts -- we're putting on a full-court press. Maybe consider reading this after your big meal. It'll make you hungry -- hopefully not to eat LeBron James or Stephen Curry.
LeBron is still the face of the NBA. Yes, he can sometimes be bland, but no good NBA argument can be made without mentioning LeBron in the same way that there's no good Thanksgiving meal unless you have turkey.
Green is a great complement to a great team. Stuffing is the most important role player on Thanksgiving. You can't rely only on stuffing for a meal, but you'll move it around your plate and let it cover a ton of ground. It has a firm texture and can get messy.
Just so smooth and sweet. Nothing makes your palate tingle like sweet potatoes.
