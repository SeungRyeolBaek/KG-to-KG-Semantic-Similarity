The Navy plans to install a laser weapon prototype on a ship this summer for at-sea testing in the Persian Gulf.
The technology, called  the Laser Weapon System, will be the first of its kind to be deployed, the Navy said.
The idea is that the laser could zap dangerous swarming small boats and flying drones while on the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf. Its power also can be scaled down, presenting the Navy a non-lethal alternative to ward off threats such as pirates, terrorists and smugglers.
Officials say the system offers the Navy a weapon at a fraction of the cost of its traditional arsenal â€” cruise missiles, as well as rapid-fire Gatling guns. Since 2007, the Navy has spent $78 million on the program.
"This is a revolutionary capability," said Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder in a statement. "It's absolutely critical that we get this out to sea with our sailors for these trials, because this very affordable technology is going to change the way we fight and save lives."
It was developed by engineers and scientists from the Navy, defense industry and
