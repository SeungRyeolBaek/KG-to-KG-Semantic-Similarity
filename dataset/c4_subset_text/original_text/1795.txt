Has Bill Donohue of the Catholic League in New York no shame?
He says not to believe the Commission of Investigation - don’ t believe the Irish government, don’t even believe the Catholic Bishops, who have just reacted with “shock” and “shame” at the discovery of “significant human remains” at the former Mother and Baby Home at Tuam, County Galway.
Only Bill Donohue of the Catholic League in New York knows the truth. He says it is all 'fake news,' nothing to see, no one to be held to account over 800 dead children in a Mother and Baby home in Tuam, County Galway.
Just a section of the death records believed to be those of the 796 babies in the mass grave at Tuam.
He besmirches the memory of helpless young children, some literally emaciated and starved to death, in pursuit of his own grandiose and grotesque need for attention.
He’s the only one who knows the story of a “mass grave” in County Gal
