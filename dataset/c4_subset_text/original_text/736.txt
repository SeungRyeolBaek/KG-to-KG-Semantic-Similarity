French president Emmanuel Macron is expected this week to announce his conclusions after three months of nationwide debate aimed at placating violent protests against his reformist agenda .
As Mr Macron prepares to announce his five-point plan, protesters have taken to the streets for the 22nd consecutive weekend of mobilisation.
A rally called for by the gilet jaunes in Toulouse, the capital of France’s southern Occitan region, drew over 31,000 protesters – up from last week’s 22,300 participants.
Eight hundred policemen were deployed to the area to contain the protesters, who built barricades and attempted to push through to the city centre. Police forces responded with teargas, stun grenades and water cannons to disperse the crowd.
The government’s refusal to authorise protests in Paris did not prevent the gilets jaunes from pouring into the Champs-Elysées, the upper-class shopping quarter that has been the theatre of violent clashes.
According to the interior ministry, at least 5,000 people took to the streets of Paris despite the lack of authorisation.
