Give credit where credit is due. That’s the meme of this letter as I sit down to recognize the extremely effective leadership and “ results driven” approach by commissioner Randy Neatherlin. I’ve lived here in Belfair for over 37 years and I have never seen a more effective commissioner serving our county and our community.
I’ve worked with the commissioner on several items from details on the Highway 3 improvement project and getting our own North Mason “Park & Ride” (now under construction). I’ve observed his work on gaining legislative support for bypass funding and his ongoing support for the Sheriff’s Office. It’s been impressive. His list goes on and on: debt reduction solutions for the sewer issue, garnering grants for parks and recreation improvements and implementing multifamily housing and low income incentives as well! Randy has shown a way to work with both sides of the aisle, pragmatically and beyond partisan politics. “Let’s just do the right thing... and get it done.” I appreciate that approach.
I believe it’s important
