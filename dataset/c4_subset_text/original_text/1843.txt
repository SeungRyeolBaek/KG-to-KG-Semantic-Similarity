Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn has formally asked the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to give Illinois more time to put federally restricted funds back  in their proper place.
The state faces the loss of $16 million in federal funds for fish and wildlife projects if it does not formally restore $9.25 million “swept” from six funds that receive money from hunting and fishing licenses and related fees.
In a letter dated Jan. 22, Quinn asked Thomas O’Melius, regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to give the state 90 days more “to finalize a remedy” to the diversion of wildlife funds.
“Given the unfortunate and unprecedented situation regarding the impeachment of our current governor and the timing of the impeachment proceedings, it is unlikely that the appropriations bill will be signed before the February 2 deadline,” Quinn wrote.
The Fish and Wildlife Service’s acting director, Rowan Gould, could declare Illinois ineligible for the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program. Future federal funding beyond the $16 million for this fiscal year also could be at risk
