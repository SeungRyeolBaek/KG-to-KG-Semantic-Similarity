The history of the Koreas, both north and south, is overshadowed in East Asian politics by China and Japan, according to an Ohio Wesleyan  University professor.
Ji Young Choi, associate professor of international studies at Ohio Wesleyan University and a native of South Korea, kicked off this year’s Great Decisions series Friday. Choi said he is personally tied to the issues the countries face.
Choi covered the countries’ politics, nuclear issues and the chance of reunification after seven decades of tension between North and South Korea. Current politics in the Koreas are still being affected by a long history of conflict after World War II when they split.
Park Chung-hee, the first female and current president of South Korea, has worked to further the economy and create more welfare programs, Choi said.
In South Korea, people are politically split on how they feel with regards to U.S. involvement in the country. There are far leftists who believe U.S. help is not beneficial to South Korea, yet 60 percent of the population believes the U.S. is the best security for nation, Choi said
