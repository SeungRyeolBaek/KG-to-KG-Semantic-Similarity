Stung by its poor performances in Punjab and Goa Assembly polls, the AAP has changed its strategy of directly attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has  decided to focus on "positive campaign" as it faces litmus test in the MCD municipal polls.
A party leader said the AAP will resort to what it did during the 2015 Delhi Assembly polls-- a "positive campaign".
"We are adopting the same strategy used by the party before 2015 assembly polls in which we went to people convincing about the positive work done during our 49-day government.
"We have seen the outcome of a positive campaign in the 2015 Assembly polls and will continue to do that for the MCD polls," said a senior party leader.
Another reason behind not targeting Modi in the MCD polls is the massive victory the BJP scored in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Delhi has a sizable voter population that belongs to the two states.
The AAP leader said attacking Modi directly during the MCD polls campaign may backfire.
In the recent Assembly election in Punjab, AAP could win 20 of 117 seats, while drew a blank in 40-member Goa
