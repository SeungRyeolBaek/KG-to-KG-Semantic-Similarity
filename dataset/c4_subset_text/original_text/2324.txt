We're still a long way from a Metroid-style space bounty hunter suit, but the US military is prototyping new wearables to enhance soldiers ' combat abilities. These include an exoskeleton similar to those being trialled for factory workers, and a prosthetic arm device, officially named the "Third Arm", meant to make heavy machinery feel weightless.
The Army Times reported this week that soldiers will soon test the ONYX exoskeleton, designed to take the load off of a wearer's hips and knees, increasing their stamina.
The 10th Mountain Division will be the first American military unit to evaluate the devices later this year, working with researchers who will attempt to improve the exoskeleton's fit, make it quieter and faster, and finally test it for "ruggedised operation".
During the R&D stages, prototypes were tested in labs while wearers exercised on a treadmill. The real test will be how the ONYX responds to water damage and uneven, mountainous environments.
The cool practicality of the exoskeleton is contrasted with this completely bonkers-looking third arm prototype. The US Army
