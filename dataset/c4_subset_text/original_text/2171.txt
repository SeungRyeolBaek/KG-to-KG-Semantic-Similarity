A pregnant EMS dispatcher helps a frantic mother deliver her baby over the phone.
When a woman went into premature labor in her Long Island home,  she didn’t expect to see the feet of her baby come out first. That’s when she called 911.
A 911 worker – another mother-to-be – got the call and coached the Manorville woman in labor through a safe delivery of a beautiful and healthy baby girl, reported Newsday.
EMS dispatcher Christine Springer got the call just after 3 p.m. Tuesday. Her shift was about to end at the Yaphank emergency services dispatch center when the frantic call came in.
"She's out! The feet are out of her!" yelled Debra Guidice, the mother of the woman in labor, Newsday reported. According to the paper, it was the first time Springer handled a breech birth in her five years on the job.
