About 15 days after the after the new moon the full moon first appears. At this point the moon is on the opposite side of the earth from  the sun so she rises around sunset and sets around dawn.
The sun shines fully on her face and tides are at their extremes again. Some may sense the pull of the sun from one direction and the moon from the opposite and their energy and will feel a bit scattered.
Hold a party or an event, but be aware that the energy level is likely to be high and anything troublesome is likely to surface. Cook and stock up the freezer. Pay special attention to your creative ventures and your dreams.
This is a good time to try out forms of divination such as scrying or tarot. Reflect about your goals, feelings and matters that have to do with relationship and family. The full moon is also good for transformations, psychic abilities, strength, love, power and fertility.
