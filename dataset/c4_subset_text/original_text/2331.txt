The University Center of Lake County has named Joel Williams as the executive director who will succeed G. Gary Grace when Grace retires March 31.
 Williams will begin work at the University Center on March 18 to ensure a smooth transition as the center's founding executive director retires. He is currently serving as the executive director of PADS Lake County, a role he has held since January of 2013.
Previously, he spent six years working for Lake County government in various roles within the Planning, Building and Development Department. He has also served as a part-time political science faculty member for Elmhurst College, one of the center's 18 member institutions.
"His experience as an executive director of a small, nonprofit organization, coupled with deep ties within Lake County and his enthusiasm for the center's mission, have positioned him well to help the board chart the next steps in the center's evolution," Hlinak said.
"He will inherit a well-organized administrative structure and a strong staff through the efforts of Gary Grace, and I am confident that he will bring creativity and new energy to the challenges of making the center more widely-known
