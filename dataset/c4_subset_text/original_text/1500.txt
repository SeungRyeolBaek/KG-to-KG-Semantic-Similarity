Oona Tempest, 24, lost her birth father — a fisherman by trade — when she was one year old. She met the sushi chef she  calls her “adopted father” almost twenty years later, working as a substitute waitress at his Upper East Side restaurant in 2013.
Oguma could be a strict teacher at times, but Tempest — a Massachusetts native who moved to New York to study art but today serves chef-curated omakase meals under the name Sushi by Bae — admired his passion and principles: “His philosophy was just focus on sushi, just focus on your work. That was really beautiful to me as an artist,” she said.
Tempest’s gender and Jewish heritage made her an unlikely apprentice. Still, Oguma instructed her in not only the art of making sushi, but more practical matters: how to save money, by conserving plastic wrap for example, and how to stand up to suppliers selling fish beneath her standards.
