Those who never have done it can have no concept of what it`s like, and those who have done it can`t begin to describe  it.
For those who do choose to travel in a car full of kids-and their numbers are growing at equal pace with two-career parenthood-the Embassy Suites hotel chain is offering a haven, at least on weekends.
Embassy Suites, which has acquired the Park Suites chain to raise the number of its hotels to 100, earlier this month unveiled a national ''family friendly'' program named after cartoon character Garfield, the company`s promotional ''spokescat'' since 1986.
Under terms of ''Garfield`s American Adventure,'' children checking into 1 of the 72 participating Embassy Suites hotels for weekends with their parents get a royal welcomed.
Gift packs at check-in time include T-shirts, ''Garfield'' magazines, playing cards, postcards, bookmarks, maps of area attractions, discount coupons on everything from toys to cruises and entertainment and a game card giving each child a shot at a $10,000 college scholarship.
