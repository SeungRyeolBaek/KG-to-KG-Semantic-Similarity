Im definetely with some of the above posts when saying that they left the serious open ended. I knew up until then that this was supposed  to be the final season but after seeing the last episode, I could see another see another season.
So lame that the show was cancelled…..I had so much fun copying the ideas of the shows writers for all the parties!
I am going to miss the Pakistani chick. What a body. Sweet dream!
I had NO idea the series was canceled!!! This blows!!!! Why do they cancel the good shows and keep the worst!?!?!?!?
So sad to see these characters say goodbye to these characters, this show had room to grow and to introduce more great actors.
Depressing I find out having to google this while watching the show, realizing this didn’t seem like a season finale…more like a forever good-bye.
This show is one of the Best they have made in a long time. It was a great ending,except that KT was ton down it made me cry. Couldn’t they just have remodled it honestly why do
