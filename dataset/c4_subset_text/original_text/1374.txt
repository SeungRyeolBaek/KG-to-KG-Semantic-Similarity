Apple: dead in the water, or on top of its game?
Since I was reading this on my iPad Pro, which is probably the  most useful electronic device I have ever owned, it came as a bit of a shock. But in fact Volker was really just articulating a truth about digital hardware, which is that the evolution of all such products (and a good deal else besides) follows a sigmoid curve.
It sounds complicated, but it isn’t really. Think of it as a version of the letter S that’s been flattened to form a graph whose vertical axis measures functionality while the horizontal axis represents time. What it tells you is that initially (at the lower part of the S) a new technology develops relatively slowly. Then there’s a point where the functionality increases dramatically over a relatively short period, after which the rate of improvement declines steadily and levels off. The iPad is now somewhere on that upper plateau, which means that it’s reached the point where one can only expect incremental improvements (faster processor, better screen, stereo audio etc). This is what Volker
