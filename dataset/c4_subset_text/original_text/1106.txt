A sweeping overhaul of Alberta’s public sector pensions has the government relinquishing control of $60 billion in fund assets.
Changes to Alberta ’s three largest public plans currently must be approved by cabinet.
“The legislation we introduced today takes the politics out of pensions,” Ceci said at a Tuesday afternoon news conference.
Tuesday’s bill doesn’t change benefits or how plans are funded, merely how those funds are controlled.
It’s the biggest governance and regulatory overhaul of Alberta’s major public sector plans since pension reforms in 1992.
It affects around 351,000 current and retired public sector workers under the local authorities, public service and special forces pension plans — employees of Alberta Health Services, school boards, post-secondary institutions, cities, the provincial government, firefighters and police, for example.
If passed, the changes tabled by Ceci Tuesday will create a joint governance structure similar to those in other provinces.
It separates duties and creates a model where plans have a sponsor board and corporation working hand-in-hand to look after pension funds.
