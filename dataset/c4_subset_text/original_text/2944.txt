I’m packing my suitcase and printing out my boarding pass. Why? Because Maker Faire takes place this weekend at the San Mateo  County Fairgrounds just south of San Francisco. According to the National Weather Service, it looks to be very nice with sunny skies and warm temperatures.
This will be my fifth Maker Faire and I’ve enjoyed participating in all of them. This time, I’ll be showing folks how to make smoke bombs and fire pistons, as well as expounding a bit upon the Art of Living Dangerously.
Saturday at 6:30 PM –I will be on the main stage, giving a talk based on material from my new book “Absinthe and Flamethrowers.” The presentation is called “The Art of Living Dangerously” and I think it’s quite an enjoyable talk and (I hope) thought provoking as well. And, the slides are pretty good.
Sunday at 2:00 PM – Do you know what a fire piston is? Well, come on by and I’ll show you how to make one
