MONTREAL—Dear Ontario voters, proportional representation could soon be coming to a province near you. While electoral reform is not on the radar  of the ongoing provincial campaign, the reverse will be true when Quebec goes to the polls in the fall.
Earlier this month, three of the four parties in the National Assembly including the currently leading Coalition Avenir Québec signed an electoral-reform pact.
