MARINE CITY - Merchants and community leaders are planning a celebration of the holiday season, because it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas in Marine  City.
Merrytime Christmas — the name is a pun on "maritime" — is 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday.
"It’s a citywide event," said Erika DeLange, executive director of the Marine City Chamber of Commerce. "It’s an old-style Christmas in Marine City."
She said stores will have specials throughout the day. The event also will include wagon rides, live ice-carving demonstrations at Drake Park and carolers.
"The Marine City football team will be singing in the streets," DeLange said.
The Coach Mike Miller Christmas Run will be at 9 a.m. The event features a 5K run and a 1-mile walk or run.
Santa Claus will be at the Mariner Theater from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
A Christmas craft show is 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Marine City Lions
