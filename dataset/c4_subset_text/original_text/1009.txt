ELYRIA — A baby sitter who gave the anti-anxiety drug Xanax to a toddler before leaving to go shop and meet a  friend at the movies has been sentenced to 22 years in prison for the child’s death.
Thirty-two-year-old Summer Shalodi apologized Thursday in a Lorain County courtroom and admitted giving 17-month-old Nadia Gibbons the drug while baby-sitting in December 2015.
Shalodi pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter instead of murder in a plea deal.
A prosecutor said Shalodi found Nadia unresponsive when she finally returned home and, instead of immediately calling 911 for help, shook the toddler and immersed her in hot water in a failed attempt to revive her.
Emergency crews found Nadia cold to the touch. The Lorain County coroner ruled she died hours before help arrived.
