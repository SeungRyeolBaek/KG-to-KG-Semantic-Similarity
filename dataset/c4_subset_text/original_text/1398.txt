Alternative reality and virtual reality are gaining traction, and some of the early adopters are already trying to figure out what it means to their businesses.  The use cases vary from industry to industry, but the idea is to leverage virtual assets (AR) or create a completely virtual environment (VR) that provide low-cost, yet effective means of accomplishing what is otherwise expensive and difficult in the real world.
The possibilities seem only limited by the imagination; however, adoption numbers underscore the early nature of the products and related analytics among businesses. For example, a recent survey by IT trade association CompTIA shows that about 21% of the responding organizations had some kind of AR or VR initiative in place.
"Most organizations realize there's some potential because they saw what happened with Pok√©mon Go last year, but it's going to take some time to happen," said Tim Herbert, senior VP of research and market Intelligence at CompTIA.
Right now, people are focused on the visualization aspects and what that means. Interest in analytics will come later as it becomes clear that what happens in an AR or VR environment needs to be monitored, analyzed
