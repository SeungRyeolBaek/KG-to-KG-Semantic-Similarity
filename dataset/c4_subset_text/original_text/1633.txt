Facebook has been fined £500,000 by UK regulator the ICO over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
It's the maximum amount possible under  law, but given Facebook's size it's just a slap on the wrist.
The regulator says Facebook broke the law, breaching the UK Data Protection Act twice.
British politicians are now calling on Facebook to be more transparent about its internal investigation into data misuse.
The British data regulator plans to fine Facebook the maximum amount possible over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
On Tuesday, the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) announced that it will hit Facebook with a £500,000 (roughly $663,000) penalty over two breaches of the UK Data Protection Act linked to the incident, in which political research firm Cambridge Analytica misappropriated tens of millions of users' personal data.
"The ICO's investigation concluded that Facebook contravened the law by failing to safeguard people's information," the organisation said in a statement. "It also found that the company failed to be transparent about how people's data was harvested by others."
The sum is barely even a slap
