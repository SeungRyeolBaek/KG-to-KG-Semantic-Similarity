Some conservative bloggers took this to mean that President Obama ordered the removal of the flag.
This administration and, by extension, the Democrat Party are  now so thoroughly divorced from the history, traditions and morals of America that we might as well admit the Marxist left has executed a successful coup d'Ã©tat on this Republic.
What an absolutely pitiful little manchild Obama is. As if turning his back on Debra Burlingame (sister of Charles Burlingame who piloted the plane that went down at the Pentagon during 9/11) wasn't pitiful enough. Now we learn that the Obama regime had an American flag removed from the live shot of his photo op at Ground Zero today.
Does flying the American flag at Ground Zero now constitute "spiking the football???"
According to the Drudge Report Archives, Drudge ran a headline reading, "REPORT: Team Obama takes down US flag before Ground Zero event..." which linked to Tapper's tweet.
One problem. It isn't true. Multiple photos show that the flag was on full display when Obama arrived at Ground Zero. Tapper's tweet
