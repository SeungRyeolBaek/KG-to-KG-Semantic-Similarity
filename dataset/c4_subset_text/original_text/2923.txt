Thursday has been declared Taco Truck Night by the founders of a Web site created in response to a new set of regulations for the mobile restaurants recently approved  by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.
“To celebrate this year’s May Day we’re announcing Taco Truck Night … Go out, get some carne asada or al pastor and support your hard working taco vendor,” the Web site Saveourtacotrucks.org readers.

Earlier this month, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance making it possible to punish lunch-truck drivers who park in one spot for more than an hour in an unincorporated area with either a citation or a misdemeanor, at the discretion of the District Attorney’s Office.
Citations will be punishable by fines starting at $100 for the first offense that increase in increments of $100 for each additional offense reported, to a maximum
