ZANESVILLE - The Zanesville Community Theatre will open its 56th season this weekend with the award-winning drama, "Of M ice and Men" by John Steinbeck.
The play is the story of two drifters during the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s. George will be played by Albert Brown and his companion, Lennie, will be played by Kevin McCarthy. As these two travel aimlessly, hoping to “live off the fat of the land” they encounter others, ultimately with tragic results. Those others include John Lowe as Candy, Jan Smith as The Boss, Scott Robison as Curly, Monica Van Nort as Curly’s Wife, Lew Woodward as Slim, Daniel Warne as Carlson and Jay Shaffstall and Steve Stewart as Crooks. The play does use some adult language and situations.
The production is directed by Phil Palmer with assistance from Val Gahagen. Steinbeck wrote the play based on his novel of the same name. It won the 1938 New York Critics' Circle award for best play.
The 2014 Broadway version was nominated for two Tony Awards,
