â€‹Can A 6th Gear Fix The 2014 Honda CB1100?
Here's the world-first review of the 2014 Honda CB1100 Deluxe.  Not because we tried all that hard to scoop it, but because everyone else really is just that lazy.
Full Disclosure: Honda wanted me to ride the new CB1100 so bad, they agreed to let me borrow it after I phoned up and asked politely.
I love the CB1100. Its smooth character, handsome looks and surprising performance just combine to create a modest, but capable motorcycle that has all the charm of a classic bike and all the speed, handling and convenience of a modern one.
How's that for a good-looking motorcycle, eh?
For 2014, it's switched from a 5- to a 6-speed gearbox and this new Deluxe model gains half a gallon of fuel capacity, a 4-into-2 exhaust and a quilt-pattern seat. ABS used to be a cost option, but is now standard on the $11,899 Deluxe model. Oddly, it's no longer an option on the standard, $10,399 bike.
