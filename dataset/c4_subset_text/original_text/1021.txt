So how did the Windy City get chosen as one of the world’s 20 safest cities in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s rankings  this year, beating out other American cities like New York, Washington and Dallas?
The short answer, according to Crain’s Chicago Business, could have something to do with digital security. The rankings don’t only look at personal security — they also look at digital security, health security and infrastructure security. Digital security, the index says, is how well city residents can freely use the internet without fearing privacy violations or identity theft — and how well-protected the city’s power grid, water supply and communications systems are from cyber attacks.
Crain’s reports that Chicago can thank Mayor Rahm Emanuel, at least in part, for high marks in digital security. Last year, Emanuel launched cyber security training in the city this year that teaches college students about digital security, with help from the U.S. Department of Defense, the index notes.
