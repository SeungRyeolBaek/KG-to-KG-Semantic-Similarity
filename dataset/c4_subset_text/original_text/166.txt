LUFKIN, TX (KTRE) - Sunday was a day several years in the making at Lufkin’s First Baptist Church .
After Sunday worship, the church broke ground on their new building project with the church’s children doing the honors.
Just over two years ago the church started demolition on the 1928 chapel. Since then, the space has sat vacant.
A new building will now be built that will expand the current property by 25,000 square feet. The new building will include children’s classrooms, a children’s worship area, a new nursery, and new church offices. The building will be used for not just Sunday but for the church’s Mother’s Day Out program.
The project will also include the building of “The Reich Chandler Great Hall” which will connect the new education building and sanctuary.
Reich Chandler was a church member and the son of George and Martha Chandler. After graduating from Lufkin High School in 1985, he went to Baylor University to study law. Chandler practiced law in Houston and Dallas before returning home to practice
