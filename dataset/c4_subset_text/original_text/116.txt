(Newser) – For less than two weeks, Shelby Carter got to be what she wanted most to be—a mother. Now her friends  and family in Wyoming, Ill., are honoring the sacrifice she made to save her newborn daughter, reports KWQC. Carter, who had just turned 21 on Sunday, was alone with her baby Monday morning when their house went up in flames. The local fire chief says Carter strapped Keana into a car seat and dropped her from an upstairs window, saving her life. "You put yourself in that situation and you know it wouldn't be easy," says Stacy Unhold, a family friend. Carter was found near an upstairs window, and an autopsy determined she died of smoke inhalation.
Very brave of this woman and proves a mother's love and sacrifice! Sadly, many other stories out there are about horrid women that do the most evil to their own children!
It's possible flames from first story kept her from jumping herself. She might have been able to toss her newborn far enough away from the house, but then was scared to jump herself if flames were directly below her.
