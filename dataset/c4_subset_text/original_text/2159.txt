This week has taken a toll me. I kept coming back to the clinic for doctor's appointments and felt all dizzy in between. My doctor  has said that I have been getting too much stress and that itâ€™s slowly killing me. If I don't take a step back, I might just be in for another adventure of my life. She added that it is not a cause for alarm though, just a gentle reminder to get my life straight. That hit me hard.
While it is true that I squeeze in yoga, running, and swimming between my already-crazy schedule, there is just too much negative energy in the workplace and outside. I have to deal with irritable, unreasonable, and sometimes senseless individuals with the most pleasing personality. I try my best to stretch my patience for people who have wronged me and I take in the situations of the daily news. That is why I hate it when some people (especially friends and family) ask me what's the latest about this and that. It's as if I haven't had enough at work. Why don't we talk about something else? Like your life and
