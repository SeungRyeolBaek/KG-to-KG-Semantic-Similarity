The cost of bringing up a child has rocketed to £180,000, it is claimed today.
Research from financial services provider Liverpool Victoria , found that in the last year alone the cost of raising offspring from birth to the age of 21 rose by 9%. It has soared 28% in the past four years.
The new estimated cost to parents is £180,137, equivalent to £23.50 a day.
Childcare and education are the biggest expenditures, costing parents £49,092 and £46,778. The cost of schooling and putting a child through university has increased by 26% since last year, the report notes.
This has helped push the price of raising a child up at a rate outstripping inflation by almost four times.
The driving force behind rising education costs has been university. From the start of this academic year, undergraduates at English universities face paying £3,000 per course in tuition fees, up from £1,175.
