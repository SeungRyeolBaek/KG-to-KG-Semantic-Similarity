Lo-Fi (Low Fidelity) is at present incorrectly assumed to be a genre of music. During its inception lo-fi was more akin  to a type of sound rather than a style of music. However, over the years, lo-fi has somewhat become a standard genre of music that is known to be popular amongst “bedroom musicians” or people producing music from their homes as opposed to studios.
Lo-fi was heavily criticised by both critics and the general audience when it first came onto the scene. The so-called “lo-fi aesthetic” would arise unintentionally during sound engineering and was characterised as being undesirable. Some of the first musicians to experiment with lo-fi did so somewhat by accident. The likes of Paul McCartney, The Beach Boys, Beck, and Robert Stevie Moore were among the first. Moore is today regarded as one of the pioneers of the genre.
Out of all the artists associated with lo-fi back then, only Moore was producing music in his home, which ultimately resulted in the overall aesthetic. While Moore's name isn't known as widely, his work has influenced Beck
