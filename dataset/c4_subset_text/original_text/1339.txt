The Patently-O blog this week took a look at how the number of pending patent cases is changing. With the number of patent cases filed  falling – Lex Machina this week noted a 33% drop in October compared to October 2013, for example – Patently-O dug into the pending cases to give another perspective on the state of patent litigation.
Its findings are consistent with the conclusion that the number of patent litigations is declining, although it noted that the number of pending cases is still well above that in October 2010.
The Patently-O folks also had a look at how the USPTO is implementing Alice v CLS Bank in patent examination, in an article in the 2014 Patently-O Patent Law Journal. It ranked the top applicants with post-Alice allowance withdrawals. Unsurprisingly IBM, eBay and Microsoft were the top three assignees, named in 47, 19 and 15 applications respectively. Perhaps more surprisingly, gaming companies IGT and WMS Gaming are in the top 10. Also appearing are finance companies JP Morgan, American Express and Bank of America, which reflects the impact of Alice on financial services patents.
