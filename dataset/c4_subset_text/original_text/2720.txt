Senior members of Elite, BCS's leading membership group for IT professionals, have resigned after voicing frustration that the group has not received support from B CS headquarters.
The disclosure comes as members of BCS, now known as BCS, the chartered institute of IT, are demanding an emergency general meeting to debate their concerns that the society is becoming more business-focused at the expense of its members.
Members of the group have complained that BCS staff failed to provide the group with the support it needed to run high-profile events, after leading figures from the IT industry offered to attend. Two resigning members are volunteers and say that running the group is no longer fun.
BCS told Computer Weekly that Elite is now back on track following a series of new elections, and expects to appoint new officers in the next few weeks.
David Tidey, head of IT at Wandsworth borough council and vice-chair of Elite, said, "As a member group of BCS, the chartered institute for IT, Elite has recently held elections for positions on the committee and will be electing a new chair and secretary in line
