FRANKLIN COUNTY, Mo. - An inmate in the Franklin County Jail could face drug distribution charges after three other inmates overdosed on opioids she  allegedly smuggled into the facility. There’s technology that could help prevent jail smuggling, but it’s not cheap.
The incident happened early Wednesday morning as three female inmates were rushed to Mercy Hospital in Washington. They all survived the overdose and were returned to the jail.
“Actually, our detention deputies do a great job,” said Franklin County Sheriff Steve Pelton.
So how did the drug end up behind bars? The sheriff said the suspect was searched but she hid the opioids in a body cavity.
Jails are not prisons. To do such a search, authorities have to have probable cause and get a judge to sign off on a search warrant, then medical officials conduct the search.
“Normally, in the course of action, we transfer to a hospital,” Pelton said.
Some jails are purchasing security devices that checks a suspect’s entire body. No court order is needed and it’s not physically invasive.
