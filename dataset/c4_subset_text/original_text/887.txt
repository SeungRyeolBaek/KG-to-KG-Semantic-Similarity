Nature broke that pact Oct. 25, when a violent downpour unleashed unprecedented fury on the town of Vernazza and the surrounding hills along Italy ’s northwestern coast, provoking dozens of landslides that swept a sludgy river of earth, trees, cars and debris onto the small seaside settlement. The bodies of three townspeople swept out to sea were recovered weeks later in French coastal waters.
Two months along, much of the mud and debris — which reached about 13 feet, just below the height of first-floor balconies — has been cleared from Vernazza’s main street, which was a lively succession of restaurants, bars and tourist shops.Barely a quarter of the town’s 600 residents returned by early January to their homes, but the alleys resonate with the sounds of heavy machinery, drilling and hammering. Though dressed in the neon colors of public safety workers, many of the crew members are local volunteers, men and women from Vernazza or nearby towns, come to give a hand as best they can.
