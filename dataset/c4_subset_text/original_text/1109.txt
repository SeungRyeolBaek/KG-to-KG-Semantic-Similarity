Mobilize the working class to support New York’s school bus drivers!
The Socialist Equality Party calls on workers throughout New York City to  support the nearly 9,000 school bus drivers, matrons/attendants and mechanics who have called a strike to defend their right to decent jobs and safe service for children against the dictates of the city’s multibillionaire mayor, Michael Bloomberg.
The bus drivers, part of the Amalgamated Transit Union, are seeking to oppose efforts by the city to cut costs by accepting contracts from the “lowest responsible bidder” when current contracts with private bus companies expire in July. The city will accept bids for 1,100 of its routes, about one sixth of the total.
The new bids do not require companies picked to observe seniority provisions or pay rates that workers now receive. These rights, which date back to 1965 and which were defended by workers in a 16-week strike in 1979, are known as the Employee Protection Provision (EPP).
Bus companies that pay poverty wages to their drivers will be able to outbid the companies now holding contracts.
