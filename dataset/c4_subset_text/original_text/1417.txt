A few years ago, Team Tobyhanna set out to change the face of electronics maintenance, taking inspiration from the past and present to reshape  its future.
The results of the massive, multi-million dollar modernization project were unveiled during a ribbon-cutting ceremony yesterday. The new Electronics Maintenance Enclosure provides a revitalized, accommodating and comfortable workspace for personnel supporting the joint warfighter.
The event was attended by CECOM commanding general, Maj. Gen. Randy Taylor, distinguished visitors, depot leaders and members of the workforce.
"Tobyhanna's responsibilities are vast and critical to the mission," Taylor said, adding that the quality of work performed here is indicative of how much the workforce cares about the Soldiers. "The breath of operations here to sustain, overhaul, fabricate, engineer and provide worldwide logistics support for the Army's massive fleet of communications and intelligence systems is extraordinary -- this building is the heart of it all."
This enclosure will be home to hundreds of employees who will reap the benefits of the innovative ideas used to create a state-of-the-art and eco-friendly environment. Tobyhanna
