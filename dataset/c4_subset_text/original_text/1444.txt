The Petersen Automotive Museum has had motorcycle exhibits before, but its new show isn’t about your typical bikes.
On April 14,  the museum will open “Custom Revolution,” a yearlong exhibition made up of about two dozen customized motorcycles that showcase how builders take stock bikes and transform them into one-of-a-kind machines.
“These builders in our exhibit really are at the pinnacle of the movement. They’re the best in the world,” said Paul d’Orleans, a motorcycle historian and author who curated the exhibition, which is set to run through April 2019.
The exhibition will showcase the work of 22 builders who use both new and old engines, chassis and other parts to reimagine factory-built machines.
Among the bikes on display will be an electric dragster called the E-Lisabad. It was built out of a BMW scooter by German custom builders Krautmotors in 2017.
The – shh – silent speedster was lowered and with its matte-black angular design looks more like a stealth plane than a scooter.
