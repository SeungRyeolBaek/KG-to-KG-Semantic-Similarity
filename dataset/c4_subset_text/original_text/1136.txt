UWF's Chandler Blanchet won the Division II men's golf individual national championship on Wednesday.
Call it fate. Call it karma.
 Whatever it was, Chandler Blanchet has added his name to a very short list in the University of West Florida record books.
The Argos' junior standout won the Division II men's golf individual national championship on Wednesday at Reunion Resort in Kissimmee, becoming just the second person in school history to accomplish that feat.
"He's had an incredible year and is one of the best I've seen in college golf," said UWF head coach Steve Fell in a press release. "It's just phenomenal what he's done this season.... To be a national champion you have to be a special player and he is. Heâ€™s a different kid and has the mentality and demeanor of a tour pro and it shows out there."
Blanchet joins Orjan Larsen as the only Argos in school history to win the men's golf individual national championship. Larsen won the 1998 title by eight shots.
