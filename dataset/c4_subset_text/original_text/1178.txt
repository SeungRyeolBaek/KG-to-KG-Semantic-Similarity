It's another historic day for consumer SSDs. Today Intel begins selling the first consumer NVMe SSD with 4-bit per cell flash technology ( QLC).
Like 3-bit per cell (TLC) before it, there is a lot of fear surrounding QLC. Will the technology provide enough write endurance, how long will data last on the memory, and the area that terrifies many the most, how much latency will the extra bit add?
We can't answer some of those questions today, but so far the Intel 660p looks really good. It's not a complete game changer, but it's a helluva lot better than we expected. Intel's 64-layer QLC memory uses a slightly faster IO bus speed compared to 64-layer TLC memory. Intel paired the memory with a Silicon Motion, Inc. (SMI) SM2263 controller that is similar to the SM2262, so the application performance is exceptional.
4-bit per cell from Intel stores 33% more data per die over 3-bit per cell media. The technology enables SSD manufacturers to meet aggressive price points.
