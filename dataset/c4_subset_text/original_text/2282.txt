A company is seeking a partnership with the state of Delaware to invest $580 million in the state's shipping economy.
International port operator Gulft ainer wants to invest $574 million to retool the existing Port of Wilmington and build a new container terminal on the Delaware River at Edgemoor, Peter Richards, CEO of the company, said in an interview.
Secretary of State Jeffrey Bullock said an agreement for the company to take over the existing Port of Wilmington could double the estimated 5,700 port-related jobs in Delaware. The past decade has seen Delaware hemorrhage blue-collar jobs and state officials see Gulftainer's proposal as a relief.
"This is a really big deal," Governor John Carney said.
Gulftainer is based in the United Arab Emirates and operates 15 ports around the world. The company opened its first terminal in the U.S. in southern Florida in 2015 and is a subsidiary of Crescent Enterprises, a privately held conglomerate.
"We see Wilmington and the Delaware River as the future and a major gateway import and export to the east coast of the United States," Richards said.
