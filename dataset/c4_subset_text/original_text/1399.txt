CALGARY—The year was 1984, the place an industrial city in the north of England and to Vancouver’s Jon Kimura  Parker fell the honour of winning one of the most prestigious piano competitions in Europe.
“I was incredibly lucky,” the goateed pianist smiled modestly over breakfast last week, just before the finals of Canada’s most esteemed and the world’s richest piano competition, the Esther Honens International.
Now a professor at Houston’s Rice University and midway through a successful international career, Parker had come to Calgary as the Honens’ new artistic director to preside over the awarding of a $100,000 prize to the 26-year-old Georgian pianist Nicolas Namoradze.
The cash wasn’t Namoradze’s only benefit. Perhaps even more important was a three-year career development package valued at $500,000, including concert engagements, a recording, a Banff Centre residency, mentoring and management.
Winning a major competition opens doors. It does not guarantee a career. Parker
