SOUTH BEND â€” The numbers added up quite nicely for the St. Joseph's girls soccer team Saturday night.
Nine players each scored  one goal as the No. 3 Indians claimed their third straight sectional title with a 9-0 win over Adams in the Riley Sectional final at Jackson Field.
All totaled the impressive figures equaled the program's 10th sectional championship.
The dominating victory was also the 13th shutout of the season for the Indians, who have now won 16 consecutive games.
St. Joe (17-1-1) earns a berth versus CGA (10-8-1) in the Riley Regional Wednesday at 7 p.m. The Indians beat the Eagles 4-0 Oct. 6.
St. Joe also beat CGA 2-1 in the regional in 2009 en route to a State Finals berth.
St. Joe coach Johan Kuitse got just what he was looking for Saturday. His unselfish team scored three times in the first 13:01 with relentless forward Sarah Hall involved in all three goals.
