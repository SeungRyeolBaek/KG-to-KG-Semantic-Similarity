On its 100th birthday, the National Parks System is more popular than ever. A record 307 million people visited its 410 sites in 2015. With  that many visitors trampling through, of course some of them are going to be ignorant, ill-prepared, or just plain dumb—putting flora, fauna, and themselves in danger. After a recent incident involving tourists loading a bison calf into their SUV (more on that below), we felt compelled to make this guide for what to do …and importantly, what not to do the next time you visit Acadia, Yellowstone, or any of the country’s parks and monuments in between.
Last week, two Yellowstone tourists spotted an abandoned bison calf by the road and decided to put it in their car and drive it to a park ranger. Bad move. The poor little guy had to be put down because its new scent prevented its herd from taking him back. Oh, and no selfies either. Bison injure more people in Yellowstone than any other animal, and last year, two selfie snappers got headbutted when they turned their backs on bison.
