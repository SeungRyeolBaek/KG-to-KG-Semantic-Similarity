"The student left an In-School Suspension room without permission and entered the cafeteria yelling comments toward the other students," police wrote.
The  words and actions of a 14-year-old Cedar Crest High School Student caused "great alarm" and an evacuation of the school's cafeteria during school hours on Feb. 20.
"School Officials contacted the police department after the student left an In-School Suspension room without permission and entered the cafeteria yelling comments toward the other students," South Lebanon Township Police wrote. "The student's actions caused great alarm to the students, staff and parents."
The unnamed boy was charged with terroristic threats and disorderly conduct, police said.
Amy Wissinger, the Cornwall Lebanon School District's community relations coordinator, clarified that some students evacuated the cafeteria but the building was not evacuated.
"The situation was quickly brought under control by high school administration and law enforcement. Some students left the cafeteria/evacuated the area (not the building) because people were in a highly anxious state following the events at the high school in Parkland (Florida)," Wissinger wrote in an email.
