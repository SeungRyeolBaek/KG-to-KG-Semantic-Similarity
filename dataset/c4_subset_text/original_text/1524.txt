Back in the mid-1990s, I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, then vice president at  IBM, who was charged with building a new generation of supercomputers. But Dr. Wladawsky-Berger didn't go out and spend a huge budget on specialized hardware. Rather, the genius of his approach was to take sets of already-manufactured processors -- at the time, RISC processors from IBM's Unix family -- and lashed them together with a high-speed switch to create supercomputing power. A few years later, the follow-on generation of supercomputers was built in a similar fashion from x86 processors running Linux.
Welcome to innovation, 21st Century style. A couple of months ago, I posted some observations about innovation coming from low-cost and conveniently available parts -- part of the formula for success for our era: “Good enough” may be good enough when it comes to developing new products and services.
One powerful byproduct that has emerged from this paradigm is supercomputers. The latest and fastest behemoth, as a
