WASHINGTON-(ENEWSPF)–December 1, 2016 — The invasion of Islamic State of Iraq and The Levant forces into Iraq two years ago  has met with a “remarkable turn-around,” British Army Maj. Gen. Rupert Jones, deputy commander, Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve told reporters yesterday.
In a teleconferenced feed from Baghdad, Jones said the coalition’s training of Iraqi forces has been key in the campaign to defeat ISIL. “It’s been well over a year since [ISIL] last defeated an Iraqi force, although they continue to resist,” he said, noting that more than 4,500 forces are training now to sustain the Iraqi forces and establish wide-area security and holding forces when Mosul has been retaken.
“We’re a coalition of more than 60 nations, united against [ISIL]. And we’re very proud that so many have offered contributions to fight against [ISIL’s] twisted ideology here in Iraq, in Syria, and other locations around the world,” he said
