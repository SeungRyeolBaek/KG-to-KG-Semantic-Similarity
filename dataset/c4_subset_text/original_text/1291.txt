The US Interior Department's inspector general office has opened a probe into recently-confirmed Secretary David Bernhardt on several allegations, including conflict of interest,  it said in a letter to lawmakers on Monday.
Mary Kendall, the Interior Department's deputy inspector general, told Senator Ron Wyden in a letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, that it received seven complaints from a "wide assortment of complainants alleging various potential conflict of interest and other violations when he was deputy secretary of the department."
Kendall said her office had opened an investigation and was continuing to gather information about the complaints. She did not detail the other complaints against Bernhardt, a Republican.
Wyden and Senator Mazie Hirono, both Democrats, had urged the inspector general in separate requests to investigate allegations that Bernhardt had inappropriately blocked a US Fish and Wildlife Service assessment of the effect of pesticides on several endangered species. The service is an office of the Interior Department.
Bernhardt, a former energy lobbyist, was confirmed by the Senate last week in a 56 to 41 vote. He replaced Ryan Zinke who resigned under a cloud of ethics investigations
