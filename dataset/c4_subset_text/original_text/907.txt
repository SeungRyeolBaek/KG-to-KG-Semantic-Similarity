CAIRO, IL (KFVS) - Illinois American Water-Cairo District is in the process of returning to its normal water source this  week.
Construction has been completed at the Cairo Water Treatment Plant to improve the intake structure in Ohio River. This construction resulted in a need to use well groundwater as an alternate source of water supply temporarily.
"This change ensured residents continued to receive reliable water service critical to public health and community fire protection while the construction on the plant's intake system was completed," said Senior Operations Manager Grant Evitts. "We thank the community for their patience and understanding."
The transition is expected to be completed this week.
The Cairo District will also begin flushing fire hydrants and water mains. The work will continue over the next four to six weeks.
Customers may experience a slight drop in water pressure or draw some discolored water temporarily.
If this occurs, it is recommended that customers let their cold water run to clear before using it again and refrain from doing laundry during that time.
Fire hydrants will also be checked and operated to help ensure fire protection
