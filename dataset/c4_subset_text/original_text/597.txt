MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - As our world continues to advance with the help of technology, artificial intelligence (AI ) has generated a lot of buzz lately in healthcare. AI healthcare providers share the goal of treating more patients, cutting down the cost of healthcare, and ultimately aim to achieve better outcomes.
Artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry uses human-created algorithms through a computer-driven system to break down complex medical data, and helps with decision support around treatment. Healthcare providers can then easily sift through large amounts of data to identify infections sooner, improve preventative medicine and enhance diagnostics. Results from an Accenture report estimated that AI applications in healthcare could save up to $150 billion annually for the U.S. healthcare economy by 2026.
Local hospitals like Conway Medical Center are already using forms of AI in their electronic medical records, such as a sepsis monitoring system used to alert doctors and nurses. With these advancements in the healthcare industry, doctors say it can reduce human error and boost overall outcomes.
