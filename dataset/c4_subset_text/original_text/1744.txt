Two classic Mercs simply isn't enough Mercs. But it is definitely a good point to start. Featuring the most graceful and elegant Mercedes designs  ever to roll out: the W111 series cars of the 60's.
The blue car is a 220SE made by IXO Altaya. IXO is a model maker specialising mostly in 1:43 scales. Altaya happens to be a sub brand utilizing the same body shell but made of slightly fewer parts and chrome window trim reproduced with silver paint.
The 280 SE made by Greenlight is also a W111 often mistaken for the later W108 models because the bumper and headlights are similar. The model is also available with a top raised version but then you cannot see the beautifully crafted interior. I've since added a few interior details mostly featuring chrome/aluminium highlights.
Pros: Both models are similarly well built though I found the Greenlight to have thinner paint allowing more detail to be visible. Both have photoetched metal hood emblems. Interiors are well detailed with excellent gauges and realistic trim.
Cons: Mirrors are extremely fragile.
Price: Rough
