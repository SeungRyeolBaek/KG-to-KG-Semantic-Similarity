RAVE: I grew up in Winter Haven, but I have lived elsewhere for many years. While here visiting recently, I discovered a terrific local place to eat, the Third Street Cafe. It's located downtown at the corner of Third Street and Avenue A, S.W., and offers breakfast and lunch. It's cozy and friendly, with good food and good service. Several members of my family went there day after day, sometimes for coffee, sometimes for breakfast and sometimes for lunch. The people running it (a husband and wife, I believe) were always pleasant and attentive, and it was very nice to enjoy more personalized service. I highly recommend that others try it
