For the Rangers, Mondayâ€™s six-hour flight to Vancouver should be a pleasant one.
The Blueshirts, coming off a  1-4-1 skid, rode a two-goal night from center Derick Brassard and toppled the Ottawa Senators, 4-1, Sunday night at Madison Square Garden.
With the Rangers leading 2-1 in the third period, Brassard raced ahead of the field to collect a bouncing pass, fired from the top of the left circle and beat goalie Craig Anderson at 10:08.
It certainly qualified as a breakout evening for Brassard, who had only one goal in the previous nine games.
Jesper Fast added an empty-netter with 1:31 left.
Defenseman Ryan McDonagh also had a big night offensively with a goal and two assists, which tied a career high.
The Rangers (18-7-3) tightened their defense in the third, allowing Ottawa only three shots on Henrik Lundqvist in the final 20 minutes.
The Rangers are 12-4-1 at home but play the next three on the road in
