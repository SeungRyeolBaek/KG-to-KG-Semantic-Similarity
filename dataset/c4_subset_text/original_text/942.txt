NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- General Electric Co. shook the U.S. stock market Friday, reporting a 6% drop in first- quarter net profit -- largely over trouble in its financial-services businesses -- and cutting its 2008 earnings outlook.
It was GE's first major downward earnings revision in memory, Oppenheimer analyst Christopher Glynn said in a note, and reflected mounting difficulties posed by a weakened U.S. economy.
For the first quarter, General Electric GE, +2.52% said net income dropped to $4.3 billion, or 43 cents a share, from profit generated during the first quarter of 2007, while revenue rose 8% to $42.24 billion.
From continuing operations, the Dow Jones Industrial Average component earned 44 cents a share, well short of the FactSet Research-compiled mean analyst estimate of 51 cents a share.
GE shares fell nearly 13% to close at $32.05 in heavy trading. The drop weighed heavily on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJII), dragging it 256 points lower to 12,325.
