Too many CCTV cameras are useless, the government's surveillance camera commissioner has warned.
Tony Porter also told BBC Radio 5 live the public did not  have a true understanding of the current nature of surveillance.
Local authorities with many CCTV cameras needed to inform the community about the exact number and how effective they were, he said.
He also expressed concern about drones and police officers wearing cameras.
The UK has one of the largest totals CCTV cameras in the world. The British Security Industry Association (BSIA) estimates there are between 4-5.9 million cameras.
Mr Porter, the surveillance camera commissioner for England and Wales, said organisations and local authorities were meant to carry out annual reviews of their CCTV capacity but many failed to do so.
He said when a West Midlands local authority held a review, it reduced the number of ineffective cameras and saved Â£250,000 in the process.
"You can still maintain the balance of excellent surveillance but not have a propagation of surveillance that is actually useless," he said.
"Surveillance can be an extremely good thing and run well, it's a useful tool for society.
