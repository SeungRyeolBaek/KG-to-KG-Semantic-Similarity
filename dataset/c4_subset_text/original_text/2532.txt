Cities around the world prepared to welcome the  New Year on Monday, from traditional ceremonies in Japan to fireworks displays in Sydney, Dubai, London, Edinburgh and Rio de Janeiro.
At 6 a.m. ET, Auckland, New Zealand, became the first major city to ring in 2019 with fireworks erupting from Auckland's Sky Tower. Thousands of revelers on the waterfront cheered as they watched brightly colored fireworks and laser lighting shoot into the sky over the city's harbor.
Celebrations followed in Sydney two hours later with rain-drenched crowds counting down to midnight. Fireworks launched from buildings across the city lit up the night and reflected in the harbor.
Police estimated that more than 1 million people would crowd Sydney Harbor to watch the spectacular display. More than 1 billion people around the world were expected to watch the display on television.
Tokyo also rung in 2019 at 10 a.m. ET, Hong Kong at 11 a.m. ET and Bangkok at noon ET.
