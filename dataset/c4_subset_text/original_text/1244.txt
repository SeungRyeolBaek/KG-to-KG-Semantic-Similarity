Former Crystal Palace legend Kenny Sansom was cleared of assault at Bromley Magistrates’ Court today and said he was “relieved it ’s over”.
The ex-footballer, of Bostall Road in Orpington, had been charged with assaulting his on-off partner Denise Mullins at her home in Hastings Road, Bromley, late last year.
However, after first reporting the incident to police on November 22 she withdrew her statement in January and didn’t attend court.
Mr Sansom, who also made 86 appearances for England and played in two World Cups, said after the case had been dismissed: “I’m relieved. It’s been a long time to wait.
The 55-year-old, who denied a charge of assault by beating, also mentioned his “recovery is going well” after revealing he’d been struggling with drinking problems.
At the trial the court heard how Mr Sansom was said to have been drunk on November 21 and was kept overnight at Princess Royal University Hospital (PRUH).
