On the morning of August 12, 2015, residents of a predominately Jewish neighborhood in San Antonio, Texas awoke to swastikas, Ku Klux  Klan and other anti-Semitic graffiti spray-painted on their cars and homes.
At the epicenter of the rampage sits Congregation Rodfei Sholom, an Orthodox synagogue that is the spiritual home for over 300 families, led by Rabbi Aryeh Scheinberg. When news of the anti-Semitic vandalism surfaced, the rabbi immediately received a visit from one of his closest friends.
A world-renowned Evangelical pastor, Hageeâ€™s telecasts on Global Evangelism Television reach over 150 million homes in the United States. These days, Hagee may be equally well known for his support of Israel and the Jewish people.
Nearly ten years ago, Hagee founded Christian United For Israel. Today, CUFI is the largest pro-Israel organization in the world with over 2.5 million members. But without Rabbi Scheinberg, there would never have been a CUFI and nearly $100 million raised to help the people of Israel.
