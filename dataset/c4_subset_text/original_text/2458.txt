Delays are among the major difficulties most construction firms face, and can lead to numerous negative results, such as lawsuits among owners and contractors, increased  costs, lack of construction productivity, and loss ofrevenue, as well as contract terminations, and negative influences on the economic and industrial domain of a community as a whole.
Through a systematic questionnaire design, this study involves a comprehensive analysis ofthe perceptions of construction delay-related reasons collected from (1) construction stakeholders from both public and private firms, considered to be experienced engineers, and (2) students in the civil engineering department at Western Michigan University, who are considered to be inexperienced construction engineers. This thesis presents the conclusions ofthis survey designed to identify and investigate the attitude and the point ofview ofpeople with different levels of knowledge and experience within the construction industry. Such results are useful in conducting curricula for construction engineering students to evaluate their knowledge and skill level for meeting the challenges in the real world ofthe U. S. construction industry, and identifying improved education strategies for preparing them to better meet these challenges.
