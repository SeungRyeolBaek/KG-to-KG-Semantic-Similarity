DJ Premier will be the first artist to release a single on the newly-revived imprint, in a nod to its early-1990s roots .
Patrick Moxey, the founder of dance and electronic label Ultra Music, is going back to his roots with the relaunch of Payday Records, the classic hip-hop label he created in 1992 that served as the label home of artists like Gang Starr, Group Home, Jeru the Damaja and Showbiz & A.G., among others.

In 1995, Payday also released the first-ever single from Jay-Z, "In My Lifetime," a year
