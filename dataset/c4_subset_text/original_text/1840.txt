On Sunday afternoon the Minister of Social Development and Sports Michael Weeks attended the closing ceremony for the Mirrors SuperCamp Junior Forum at Willowbank Resort &  Conference Centre.
Last week, 58 young people, aged 11 to 13, attended the six-day camp, where they focused on communication, critical thinking and character development as well as innovation learning strategies and academic skills.
This fully subsidized camp gave middle school students an incredible opportunity to develop their socio-emotional skills, to build and maintain relationships with others more effectively, and gain neuroscience-based learning techniques to enhance their school performance.
Prior to the closing ceremony, students had the opportunity to run their own ‘trade show’ to teach others in the community what they had learned in terms of the core principles of the program.
Additionally, 44 parents completed a two-day workshop created especially for parents of the students.
“SuperCamp is not a typical classroom or camp experience; it uses a structured curriculum to provide students with intensive personal development and learning strategies to be more effective learners,” said Minister Weeks.
