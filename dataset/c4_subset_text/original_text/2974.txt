AN encounter with the Bathurst Aquatic Centre recently had me questioning whether or not people can demonstrate common morality when faced with an unexpected situation. The  pool claimed that I was unable to enter with my three sisters, (one biological and two foster) on a "family" pass because the girls were apparently not my family according to the pool's standards. The (unwritten) claim was that I was only allowed to enter as a family if these girls were on the same Medicare card as me.
