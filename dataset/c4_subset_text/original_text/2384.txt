Kim Burrell is receiving a ton of backlash over anti-gay remarks she made during a recent sermon at her Houston church. As we previously reported , the viral video features the gospel singer and pastor talking to her congregation about sin and referring to gays and lesbians as perverted.
In another video, Burrell clarified that she â€œnever said that all gays were going to hell."
The video surfaced just days before Burrell is scheduled to appear on The Ellen show with Pharrell Williams to perform a song from the Hidden Figures soundtrack. The host, Ellen DeGeneres, is gay and and has been happily married to her wife, Portia di Rossi, for eight years.
Pharrell, as well as Hidden Figures co-stars Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae addressed the controversy on social media Saturday (Dec. 31).
"I condemn hate speech of any kind. There is no room in this world for any kind of prejudice. My greatest hope is for inclusion and love for all humanity for 2017 and beyond," said Pharrell.
