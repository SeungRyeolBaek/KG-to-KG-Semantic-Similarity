WASHINGTON - Two Marine non-commissioned officers will be court-martialed for allegedly urinating on the bodies of Taliban fighters last year  in Afghanistan and posing for unofficial photos with casualties, the Marine Corps said Monday.
The charges against Staff Sgt. Joseph W. Chamblin and Staff Sgt. Edward W. Deptola are in addition to administrative punishments announced last month for three other, more junior Marines for their role in the urination episode.
The disclosure in January of a video showing four Marines in full combat gear urinating on the bodies of three dead men led to a criminal investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service as well as a Marine investigation of the unit involved, the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines, which fought in the southern Afghan province of Helmand for seven months before returning to its home base at Camp Lejeune, N.C., last September.
In the video, one of the Marines looked down at the bodies and quipped, "Have a good day, buddy."
In a statement Monday, the Marine Corps said disciplinary actions against additional Marines will be announced later. It also said there
