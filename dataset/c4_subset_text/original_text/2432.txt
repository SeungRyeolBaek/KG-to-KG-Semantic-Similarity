I'd have put John Carmack up there somewhere, perhaps not top 5, but maybe given i'd say he's had a fairly large impact  on all modern pc games (atleast, not 2d).
Also, why the hell is the iPhone even there? This is like a crazy list, for crazy people. I've probably done more for gaming than the iPhone, that's how little it has done for "real" gaming.
"Real" gaming? Is that like "no true Scotsman"? Gaming is gaming, and to deny the massive influence the iPhone has had is to be blindly foolish. But putting Steve Jobs at #1 is a bit much. I'd accept top 10 somewhere at most.
But i'm not sat here holding my breath in anticipation of the next release of "angry birds".
Skyrim next week... a "Real" game. Yes there is a difference, one pushes things along, one is just to make money in the short term.
Jobs? Zuckerberg? Tim Berners Lee?
This list suffers from the classic 'what's important right now' syndrome.
