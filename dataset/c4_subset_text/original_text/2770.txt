Family traditions can take many forms. It can be the handing down of recipes or gatherings for graduations or weddings.
For some, the tradition  can be teaching the next generation how to create needle arts. Many local residents learned from a family member how to create decorative quilts, blankets or wearable items.
Esther Newell of Howland SCOPE’s Ohio Star Quilters guild also learned quilting from an older relative.
“My grandma taught me when I was 14. I made my first quilt when I was 15 years old,” she said.
The use of needles, hooks or a sewing machine to create decorative textile handicrafts is called needle arts. Needles or hooks are used in crocheting, knitting, quilting, embroidery and needlepoint.
Quilting is the process of sewing layers of material usually in a square shape with a layer of batting in the middle as an insulation layer. The squares are sewn together to create what can be used as a bed comfort or blanket. Originally, the material was acquired from scraps left over from sewing projects
