The National Australia Bank (NAB) has warned customers about an email scam which claims that access to their accounts is restricted.
The email advises  them to place a call to the bank in order to have their access restored. However, victims are redirected to speak with a fraudster who will seek access to their personal and financial information.
An NAB spokesperson said that domestic and overseas criminals attempt different methods for defrauding financial institutions and their customers.
