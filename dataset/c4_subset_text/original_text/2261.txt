Thanks to climate change, methane is rising from our oceans and into our atmosphere.
Increasing water temperatures in the Pacific Northwest are causing frozen methane  trapped in layers under the seafloor – called methane plumes –to thaw, rise to the surface and enter our atmosphere.
This isn’t the first time warm water temperatures have forced methane to the surface. The frozen methane clusters appeared on the East Coast last year. In August 2014, it was reported that 570 methane seeps clustered in approximately eight regions. Compared to carbon dioxide, methane is about 25 times more potent.
The latest research into methane plumes off the Pacific Northwest comes from the University of Washington. Scientists observed 168 methane plumes over the course of a decade.
Frozen as is, the methane plumes are not dangerous to our environment. When they thaw and come to the surface, however, the methane bubbles become a powerful and dangerous greenhouse gas. At the rate these plumes are coming to the surface, our atmosphere could be filled with.1 million metric tons of methane per year, just from the plumes off the Washington coast.
