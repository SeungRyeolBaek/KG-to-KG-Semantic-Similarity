A threatening note with the logo was attached to a plastic bottle filled with cement that was thrown through a window of the Maccabi Jewish Community Center  and sports club in Santa Fe City, the capital of the Santa Fe province.
A Jewish sports club in Argentina was the victim of a threat that included the Islamic State logo.
The note read “This is a warning, the next one will explode” and “Allahu Akbar,” or “God is great” in Arabic.
The National Institute Against Discrimination expressed “deep concern” about the attack “written in Spanish and in Arabic with a motto used by fundamentalist groups,” according to a statement issue by its Santa Fe office.
The Santa Fe representative of the Argentine Jewish political umbrella DAIA, Horacio Roitman, met with police and security authorities to strengthen surveillance of the institution and to put in place preventive measures. Roitman denounced the attack in interviews with local and national media.
The JCC said on social media that its activities will continue as usual. Maccabi is celebrating this month its 60th
