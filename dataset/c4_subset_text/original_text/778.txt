The body representing judges in Chile has made an unprecedented apology for the actions of its members under military rule in the 1970s and 1980s.
 In a statement, it said the judiciary at the time had abandoned its role as protector of basic rights.
“The time has come to ask for the forgiveness of victims… and of Chilean society,” said the judges.
BBC reports that more than 3,000 people were killed under the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet between 1973 and 1990.
The statement by the National Association of Magistrates of the Judiciary comes a week before the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought Gen. Pinochet to power.
It said its members, and in particular the Supreme Court, had failed in its duty to protect victims of state abuse.
The magistrates’ association acknowledged that the Chilean judiciary could and should have done much more to safeguard the rights of those persecuted by the dictatorship.
It said the judges had ignored the plight of victims who had demanded their intervention.
Chilean courts rejected about 5,000 cases seeking help on locating missing loved ones abducted or killed
