The Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County will pay Rolling Meadows $300,000 over the next two years for the option to buy 6.7  acres of city-owned land for a new garbage transfer station.
Under the plan, unanimously approved by the City Council on Tuesday, the city will get $70,000 now and the $230,000 balance in a year.
After two years, the waste agency will have to pay an additional $1.1 million if it wishes to exercise its option to buy the land.
The property, at 3851 Berdnick St., already serves as a garbage transfer station for Rolling Meadows. And the city can continue to use the site in that capacity until the sale is final, said City Manager Robert Beezat.
The waste agency, a consortium of 26 north and northwest suburbs, is expected to begin building a new station on the site before the sale is final. The old one, however, will not be torn down until the property changes hands. Earlier this month, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency approved plans for the transfer station to be built in Rolling Meadows.
