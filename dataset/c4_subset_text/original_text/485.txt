TROY â€‘ Police investigating the October shooting of a city man seized firearms and ammunition during a raid at a home near the murder scene, authorities  said.
Police late Monday raided the first floor apartment at 448 1st St. and seized a loaded pistol grip shotgun and a Romanian SKS assault rifle, along with over 300 rounds of ammo, police spokesman Sgt. Terry Buchanan said.
Buchanan said the raid was connected to information police got during their investigation of the Oct. 13 fatal shooting of 29-year-old Jimmy Chapman.
Chapman was found shot once in the head and lying on a sidewalk at Harrison and Second streets at around 8 p.m.. He died the next day at Albany Medical Center Hospital. No arrests have been made. Police do not believe the weapons seized in the raid are connected to the murder.
''We are hoping that information we get from this arrest will lead to more information about the murder,'' Buchanan said.
Police arrested the resident of the apartment, Tyrone T. Howard, 30. They are not calling him a suspect in the homicide.
Howard was charged with two counts
