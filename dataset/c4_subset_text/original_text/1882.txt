A MAN who fell under a train on a Hampshire heritage railway was unaware he was not meant to get off due to a faulty PA system in his  carriage, an inquest heard.
Michael Kerry had arranged that trip on the Real Ale train on the Watercress Line.
The train, run by the Mid Hampshire Heritage Railway, known as the Watercress Line, did a double return journey from Alton to Alresford.
Winchester Coroner's Court heard that 62-year-old Mr Kerry, a systems electronics test engineer for BAE, had organised the trip for his wife Carol’s 60th birthday and the couple and friends were sitting in the same carriage.
Mrs Kerry told the court that their carriage’s PA system was not working which she discovered when she went to another part of the train.
As a result her husband, of Old Redbridge Road, Redbridge, Southampton, missed an announcement asking passengers not to leave the train at the second Alresford stop as it was running late.
The court heard that Mr Kerry left the train for a suspected toilet stop.
