June 15 (UPI) -- In a nearly unanimous vote, the U.S. Senate on Thursday approved new sanctions against Iran and Russia that  also limit President Donald Trump's administration from weakening existing sanctions against Moscow.
In a 98-2 vote, the Senate approved tougher measures against Iran's ballistic missile program, due to the country's support for terrorist groups and its record on human rights.
Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the author of the bill, told reporters he hoped President Donald Trump would "acknowledge" the near-unanimous support among senators for tougher actions against Iran and Russia.
The measure also included language toughening sanctions against Russia in the wake of their accused efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, converting some of the penalties put in place by former President Barack Obama's administration into law, and forbidding Trump from weakening existing Russia sanctions without first seeking Senate approval.
Senators said the tougher tack against Russia would help force them to ease hostilities against Ukraine, permit a negotiated settlement in the Syrian civil war and dissuade them from attempting to hack U.S. institutions and political groups
