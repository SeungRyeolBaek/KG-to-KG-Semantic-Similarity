Hereâ€™s why I support Proposition 112 and the 2,500-foot drilling setbacks.
1. There has been, to my knowledge , no study or statement or information that supports the premise that the affects of oil and gas drilling and residual effects of transportation, water and chemicals, noise, etc. are healthy for humans, animals, communities. There have been some studies that claim that they have not found direct adverse effects within 500 feet of drilling, but no studies showing it is healthy and other studies saying there may be negative health effects. Those living close to drilling pads have had adverse health and living conditions.
2. The opposition and funding against Prop 112 comes primarily from the oil and gas industry. The dire economic effects and the neutral health and livability claims come from the very industry that profits from the 500-foot setback. Should I believe the industry about benign health effects and economic Armageddon? Should we have believed the tobacco industry about the safety of cigarettes, the mining industry about coal dust, the pharma industry about thalidomide, the agra/chemical industry about DDT, the financial industry about mortgage bonds?
