MANILA, December 24, 2004 (STAR) By Donnabelle Gatdula - The country’s three major oil companies along with  several small oil players are cutting pump prices by an average of 30 centavos per liter.
Pilipinas Shell and Petron Corp., two of the country’s major oil players, announced yesterday a reduction of 30 centavos per liter in gasoline prices effective this Christmas eve.
Caltex Philippines Inc. and small oil players Total Philippines Inc., Eastern Petroleum Corp., Seaoil Philippines Inc. and Uni-oil Philippines Inc. cut pump prices last night.
Flying V, owned by the Villavicencio family, implemented a higher reduction of 35 centavos per liter earlier on Dec. 23. Flying V operates 114 gasoline stations nationwide.
The reduction came following the call made by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Consumer and Oil Price Watch (COPW) urging the oil firms to cut pump prices in line with falling world crude prices.
Energy Secretary Vince Perez called on the oil firms last Monday to reduce the prices of petroleum products
