Until Microsoft fixes this issue removing any external media is a decent workaround, but those who use an SD card to make up for a lack of disk  space will face problems. Threshold 2 requires 20GB of free space for the installation and that may prove a lot to free up.
A Reddit thread notes that Threshold 2 is deleting a number of installed programs as it upgrades. Posters have a long list, including CPU-Z, speccy, 8gadgetpack, a Cisco VPN client, SATA drivers, SpyBot, RSAT, F5 VPN, HWMonitor and more.
Of course these can be reinstalled and you will be notified of any removed programs after the installation, but 1. This shouldn’t happen in the first place, and 2. There should be a warning in advance, not just after they were removed. There’s also something a theme here: many are system monitoring tools. Has Microsoft something planned in this space for the future and is quietly removing the competition? Only time will tell, but I suspect that won’t stop the conspiracy theories growing.
