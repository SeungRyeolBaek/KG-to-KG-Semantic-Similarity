How about doing this project properly and leave a legacy to the people of Ventura County.
My wife and I attended the Ventura County Planning Commission meeting  of Jan. 31 considering the wildlife corridor overlay plan. During the presentation, the state biologist showed many tracking collar images of different species. It showed that these animals do not cross highways or freeways, staying in clusters on either side of these barriers. Later, a planning staffer explained that the county has no authority over highways.
So, all the planning for “connectivity for biodiversity” is virtually for nothing. Until the county decides to work with whatever highway authorities it needs to, to have connectivity, we will have a non-working wildlife corridor. Putting highly restrictive regulations on landowners and still not having connectivity for animal diversity makes absolutely no sense at all.
A project like this should take decades to properly plan and implement. These animals are not endangered. I understand the rush is so that the project will serve as a legacy to two long-term county supervisors.
Is a half-baked plan a legacy?
Is serving the public a reason to have a personal legacy?
