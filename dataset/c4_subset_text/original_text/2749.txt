WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – A first-of-its-kind partnership, with Purdue University bringing Amazon to campus as  its preferred textbook provider in 2014, quietly has been scaled back in recent weeks.
The West Lafayette campus and Amazon are still partners, Purdue’s top purchasing official told the J&C Friday. But as professors found in the past week, unable to upload the fall 2018 semester’s titles and course materials into an Amazon textbook portal that has been standard fare for the past four school years, the online giant no longer will be Purdue’s favored seller of textbooks.
The move will not affect the two Amazon@Purdue ordering and pick-up stores in the Purdue Memorial Union and the Krach Leadership Center on Third Street, which will remain open.
Rob Wynkoop, Purdue’s managing director of service enterprises, said Amazon initiated the change as it negotiated an extension of the relationship with the university through July 2023. He said Amazon will continue to sell textbooks – offering more than 90 percent of the adopted titles on campus each semester – and keep its campus stores
