Amid a major controversy and protest over the delay in local council elections, the mandate of the committee dealing with demarcation of boundaries of local council  wards has been extended till August 31, committee sources said.
Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha this week signed the extension letter as the committee’s previous mandate expired on March 31. He said this was done in view of the piles of complaints regarding the demarcation of wards of local councils throughout the country.
At least 5,000 complaints had been lodged by political parties and the general public.The extension letter noted that due to the workload and the complex nature of the complaints, the mandate of the committee had been extended with immediate effect.
A committee member told the Sunday Times that the earlier delimitation commission had used a caste basis to carve out some of the wards.
He said committee members were visiting every district to finalise wards in consultation with the people and political parties.An independent election watch dog alleged that the government was deliberately delaying the local council elections and using the delimitation issue as a cover for its own political agenda.
