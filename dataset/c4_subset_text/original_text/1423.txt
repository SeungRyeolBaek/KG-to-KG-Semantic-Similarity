WASHINGTON (AP) â€” House Republicans are unveiling new proposals to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's health care law, as Speaker Paul Ryan seeks to  showcase a GOP governing agenda amid the tumult of the presidential campaign.
But the 37-page white paper falls far short of a full-scale replacement proposal for "Obamacare" and leaves key questions unanswered, including the size of the tax credits, the overall price tag of the plan, and how many people would be covered. Republican aides said it's intended as an overall roadmap showing how the GOP would approach undoing and replacing Obama's health law with a Republican in the White House, and specific legislative details would be answered as the actual bills are written next year.
As such it is an aspirational document like the rest of Ryan's "Better Way" agenda, a six-topic blueprint that the speaker has been rolling out this month at carefully choreographed events that have been getting largely overshadowed by the latest Donald Trump campaign controversy. Ryan was to present his health care proposals alongside several House committee chairmen Wednesday afternoon at the American Enterprise Institute, and a tax plan was coming Friday.
