In an extraordinary interview with the New York Times, Donald Trump unleashed an avalanche of caustic attacks on American’s top law enforcement officers , some of whom he had personally appointed.
In each case, the source of Trump’s ire was related to the ongoing investigation into his campaign and potential collusion with Russia.
Trump dismissed the entire notion of FBI independence, saying that the FBI Director only reports to the Justice Department “out of courtesy,” blaming the practice on Richard Nixon.
Taken together, Trump’s comments amount to a full scale assault on the rule of law from an increasingly paranoid president.
Trump blasted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one of his earliest supporters, for recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Trump cast Sessions as a traitor and said that, had he known Sessions would recuse himself, he would have appointed someone else to the job. He blames Sessions for starting a chain of events that resulted in the appointment of the special prosecutor.
TRUMP: Look, [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions gets the job. Right after he gets the job, he recuses himself.
