Woody Allen's latest London-set picture, in cinemas now, provoked some predictably'mixed' reviews. No news there then,  so let’s change the subject and talk about his glasses instead.
We've long been great fans of Moscot eyewear, but the company’s continued rise over the last couple of years has been nothing short of phenomenal, leading to expansion which has seen it add nine stockists in Britain alone to its website, in addition to the two dedicated retailers in New York and a worldwide webstore.
Established nearly a century ago on New York’s Lower East Side, the family-run business has maintained its appeal by defying short-lived trends and sticking to the distinctive designs it built its name on, now selling from the same location since 1950.
The Moscot Originals line is based on styles from their archives between 1930 and 1970, while the Spirit range is a contemporary rethink of the established classics. Now with titanium editions and the newly-launched Moscot Sun range, 2011 looks to be their year, for the 96th time at least.
