ATHENS – It doesn’t matter what Rulon Gardner does in these Olympics, or for the rest of his life, because he  will forever be attached to the afternoon of Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2000, the day he attached himself to an unbeatable wrestling machine and wouldn’t let go.
Aleksandr Karelin still shadows Gardner, and will until the day Gardner takes off his singlet, walks away from Greco-Roman wrestling and heads back to Wyoming for good.
Karelin was the sport’s undisputed king, a man who hadn’t lost a heavyweight match in 13 years when he showed up for work in Sydney four summers ago, looking to bring home a fourth medal. Karelin was the modern incarnation of Milo of Croton, the ancient Greek wrestler who won six championships, some because his opponents were too terrified to face him.
Then the farmboy from Wyoming showed up. Karelin wrapped his arms around Gardner that day, broke the grip ever so slightly, and that was that. Gardner won the match 1-0. The reverberations were everywhere.
