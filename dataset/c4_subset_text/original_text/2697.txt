Making money: Terrence Kelleman started making nifty items in his living room in 2002.
Board stiff: Dynomighty is furnished with  these neat cardboard chairs.
In the fold: Artist Miss Zukie with the Dynomighty wallet featuring her work.
This guy is chairman of the cardboard.
Terrence Kelleman, the founder of Dynomighty, a company best known for its paper-thin wallets, opened a storefront and shared artist work-space in Dumbo on April 16 and decked the place out with cardboard seating. The chairs are made from three pieces of thick cardboard cut with lasers and can be shipped flat and assembled in a jiffy. The engineering feat came out of Kellemanâ€™s dissatisfaction with the seat-us quo when trying to furnish the shop.
Kelleman started Dnynomighty 12 years ago in his living room, with a box of magnets that his father lent him $300 to buy. He made link-less bracelets out of the magnets and sold them to his employer, the Museum of Modern Art Design Store in Manhattan.
