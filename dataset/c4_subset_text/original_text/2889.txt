I love all history – it’s fascinating. The older, the better. The more complicated, the more closely I pay attention.
 There’s a constant stream of history sites that populate my Facebook newsfeed. And, for Halloween this year, I took my son to George Washington’s estate, Mount Vernon, because that’s the kind of place I like to celebrate everyday occasions.
So here are some of my favorite places for history news.
There’s so much to read on Atlas Obscura.
The blog says it’s the “definitive guide to the world’s wondrous and curious places.” Indeed.
Some of the history-specific posts that caught my eye include Found: A New Ice Age Cave Network Below Montreal, When a City and a Bishop Went to War Over Beer, and Using a Particle Accelerator to See Inside a 1,900-Year-Old Mummy.
The History Blog was launched June 2006. It’s being managed by a writer by the name of livius.
