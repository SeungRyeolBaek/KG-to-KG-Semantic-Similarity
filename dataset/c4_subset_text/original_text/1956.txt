DENVER — A judge is being asked to appoint a specialist to help ensure that the state hospital at Pueblo comes into compliance by promptly determining  whether a backlog of criminal defendants are mentally competent to stand trial.
The request is the latest development in a lawsuit against the hospital because it and its parent agency are not promptly determining whether hundreds of pre-trial detainees lingering in county jails are competent to have their day in court.
The request was made Thursday in Denver to Magistrate Judge Nina Y. Wang of the U.S. District Court for Colorado.
It was made by Disability Law Colorado, an office that advocates for disabled persons in Colorado, including the detainees who are in jails all over the state. They are there because judges think they may not be competent.
State mental health staff have to tell judges whether those defendants are competent. Until that happens, judges can't move the cases forward for juries to determine if the defendants are guilty.
The current lawsuit — which has been ongoing since 2011 — was filed by Disability Law Colorado. It claims that the hospital and its parent agency are violating the constitutional rights of the detainees by
