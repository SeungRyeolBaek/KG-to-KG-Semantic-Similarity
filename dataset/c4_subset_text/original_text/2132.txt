Brian was kind and generous and would bring laughter to even your darkest days. Upon meeting him you could never forget him. Brian was excited about his new life that he had found in Jesus, his family, his church family, and several close friends. He attended C3 Cross Connection Church in Shawnee. He had such an outgoing personality and attracted folks to him with his smile. Brian would give you his last dollar or his sack lunch if he thought you needed it more than him.
