Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Co.
Job: Sole owner, chairman of The Irvine Co.
Bio: He is the wealthiest U .S. real estate mogul, with a fortune valued by Forbes at $15 billion. He’s also one of the most generous philanthropists. Bren has controlled for nearly four decades a huge slice of south Orange County real estate and, all told, holds 500 office properties, 40 shopping centers, and nearly 50,000 apartment units, primarily in California. Lives in Newport Beach.
Why he’s an influencer: Bren’s decision to retain ownership of much of the commercial property on his land gives him lasting influence. In 2014, he donated 2,500 acres of Anaheim Hills land to the county, a major boost to the county’s open space; opened for sale the long-dormant Orchard Hills community in Irvine, the first new high-end community in the county in a decade; finished his second new office tower at Fashion Island and started a third, next to Irvine Spectrum; and added $1 billion to his worth, by Forbes�
