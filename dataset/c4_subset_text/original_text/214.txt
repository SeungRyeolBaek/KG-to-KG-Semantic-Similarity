London: Prime Minister  Theresa May said on Sunday she would not be derailed from leaving the European Union, laying the groundwork for difficult meetings this week in which she will try to unite a divided cabinet behind her vision for post-Brexit Britain.
May was applauded by European Union leaders in Brussels on Friday after securing an agreement to move previously-deadlocked talks forward onto the topic of interim and long-term trading arrangements.

"Amid all the noise, we are getting on with the job," May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. "My message today is very clear: we will not be derailed from this fundamental duty to deliver the democratic will of the British people."
