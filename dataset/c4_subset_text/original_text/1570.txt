The annual television licence fee will increase to £147 from £145.50 on April 1 this year, the Government has said.
You might  think you only need a TV licence if you actually have a television, or only if you watch live TV at the same time as it&apos;s being broadcast, but it is NOT that simple.
It&apos;s the first increase since 2010.
But it won&apos;t be the last, with the Government announcing the licence fee will rise in line with inflation for five years.
Here&apos;s everything you need to know about the increase including payment plans and when you don&apos;t have to pay for one.
What date will it increase?
The cost of a TV licence will increase on Saturday, April 1.
It is the first time since 2010 that the price has changed.
How much is it going up by?
From April 1 a TV licence fee will be £147, the new figure is just £1.50 more than the £145.50 cost we pay now.
