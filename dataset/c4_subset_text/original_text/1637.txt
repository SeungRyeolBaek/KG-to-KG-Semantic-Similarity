MTA fare increases set to take effect July 1, raising one-way rides by a quarter to $1.50 and monthly passes by $ 13 to $75, will be discussed at the agency’s board meeting Thursday, when members will consider setting a date for a public hearing to explain the rationale behind the hikes.
The increases, the first in two years, are meant to help make up for a $204 million deficit in its operating budget for buses and trains, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Public transit activists with the Bus Riders Union say the fare increases are ill-timed and will affect the working poor disproportionately.
“The monthly pass is going up by $13. That’s a meal on the table. The typical transit rider only makes about $12,000 to $17,000 a year,” Barbara Lott- Holland of the Bus Riders Union told The Times at rally Tuesday.
Daily passes will go from $5 to $6. Fares will not be raised for people with disabilities, students, Medicare recipients and people who are 62 or older.
