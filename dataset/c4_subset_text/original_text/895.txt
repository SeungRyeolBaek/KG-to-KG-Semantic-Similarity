JERUSALEM (AFP) - A Palestinian tried to stab a private security guard at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank on Saturday ( Oct 24) and was shot dead, in the latest in a string of such attacks, police said.
"A terrorist, who arrived armed with a knife, tried to stab a security guard at the site. In response, the terrorist was shot by the security force at the scene and killed," a police statement said.
Police said the alleged attacker arrived from the Palestinian side of the Al-Jalama checkpoint between the northern West Bank and Israel.
As at other such checkpoints, private security guards operate alongside troops.
The incident takes to 51 the number of Palestinians killed this month in clashes with police or while carrying out attacks on Israelis. An Israeli Arab has also died.
Eight Israelis have been killed in attacks. One Israeli Jew and one Eritrean were killed after being mistaken for attackers.
Earlier on Saturday, an Israeli told police he had fought off an attempted knife attack near the Old City in annexed east Jerusalem. The alleged assailant fled.
