Love Island star, Hannah Elizabeth has wowed fans with a  dramatic new look.
The 2015 contestant, and The Only Way Is Essex star Jon Clark's ex fiancee, changed her trademark bouncy blow-dry for a sleeker look, and shared the results with her 320k fans on Instagram.
Posting a shot from Chloe's Beauty Bar – run by Jon's ex, Chloe Sims – the star of the popular TV show pouted and stared into the distance as she showed off her new look.
Her bleached blonde tresses were styled in a straight blunt cut which was styled in a chic middle parting and swept out her face.

"New wig by the Amazing talented Hair king that is @joel_mag21," she wrote.
"Thank you @millionaire_hair_extensions for the fab hair @chloesbeautybaressex #platinum#blonde #wig".
