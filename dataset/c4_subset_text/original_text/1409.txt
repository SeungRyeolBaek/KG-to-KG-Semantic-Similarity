The town of Krymsk has been wiped off the face of the Earth.
The official body count has topped 170, but that takes into  account only the bodies that have actually been found. Krymsk residents believe that the figure could reach into the thousands. They are also certain that the flood was caused by water being released from the Naberdzhayevskoye reservoir. This was done, they say, as a control measure to avoid flooding President Vladimir Putin's dacha in Gelendzhik, a Black Sea coastal town located 60 kilometers from Krymsk, or the city of Novorossiisk, only 40 kilometers away.
In fact, the Neberdzhayevskoye reservoir is fully intact, but when the people distrust the authorities, they tend to believe conspiracy theories. There is a good reason why the people's trust has been completely undermined: The authorities knew at least six hours beforehand that disaster would strike, yet failed to issue a warning.
