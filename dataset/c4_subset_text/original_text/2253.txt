What’s been happening is NASCAR conducting more thorough inspections at its research and development center in North Carolina, and assessing midweek penalties for winners  that failed. The sport had never stripped a driver of a win.
Kevin Harvick, for instance, won last fall at TMS, but his car failed inspection a couple days later. NASCAR handed a significant penalty, including losing an automatic berth into the championship finale, but he’s still recognized as the race winner.
That won’t be the case anymore, although it’s far from perfect.
NASCAR will conduct thorough post-race inspections at the track this season, a process that will take approximately 90 minutes, compared to sending the cars to North Carolina. However, in that 90-minute window, the Victory Lane celebration and post-race interviews will have already been conducted.
If a winning car fails inspections, the second-place team wins the race. By that point, though, the second-place team will be long gone from the track.
