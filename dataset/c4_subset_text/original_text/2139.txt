The head of the liberal Yabloko party, Sergey Mitrokhin has asked the head of the presidential administration for assistance in registering candidates in  regional elections.
­Mitrokhin has forwarded an official complaint to the President’s Chief of Staff, Sergey Naryshkin. Lacking representatives in parliament, the Yabloko leader listed a number of violations relating to the process of registering candidates. Local legislative elections will be held in 12 regions on March 13.
Yabloko’s leader requested that Naryshkin take measures so that the regional election commissions, which did not register candidates, changed their decisions.
The Central Election Commission has received about 200 complaints from parties about alleged violations during the election campaign. However, Mitrokhin decided to send a letter to the presidential administration’s head as well, on the advice of the president.
During his meeting with heads of four parties represented in the State Duma on February 19, Dmitry Medvedev noted that complaints could be sent directly to the presidential administration. This was in response to Communist Party chief, Gennady Zyuganov
