— It’s not quite Eloise at the Plaza, but Olivia the Pig had a good thing going in the Village. The star of  the children’s book (and now television) series, and her author Ian Falconer, had been living in a townhouse at 45 West 9th Street for the past three years, purchased for $4.6 million. According to city records, the house sold for $4.1 million back in May, though the deal was only filed yesterday. The original asking price, from Sept. 22 (one week after Lehman filed for bankruptcy, it should be noted) was $7.1 million. The buyer was Kirat Singh, a managing director at Bank of America, and Yue Chen. There hasn’t been a new Olivia book since Olivia Helps with Christmas in 2007, but Mr. Falconer’s new collaboration with David Sedaris, Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Modest Bestiary, should help make up for his loss on the house.
