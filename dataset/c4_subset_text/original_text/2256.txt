LETHBRIDGE - All five starters reached double digits as the University of Great Falls women's basketball team defeated Lethbridge College 85-46  here Saturday.
The UGF defense held tough in a physical game, limiting the Kodiaks to 23 percent shooting throughout the game and acquired 18 steals. The Lady Argos also dominated the glass, out rebounding Lethbridge 56-39.
The defensive effort showed growth in an area the team is focused on improving early in the season, although they did give up too many open looks on the perimeter.
Offense is less of a work in progress for UGF and that showed again against the Kodiaks. Preseason All-Conference forward Nneka Nnadi led all scorers with 21 points off of 8-14 shooting. The junior added eight rebounds and two steals to her statistical totals.
While Nnadi was the team’s leading scorer, every Argo that played, scored and every starter finished with over 10 points.
UGF’s preseason All-American Erin Legal flirted with a quadruple-double. She finished with 14 points
