Police Chief Darren Pytel said the city took the “very rare” step of hiring an outside investigator because of allegations that police used excessive  force and exhibited racial bias.
The McGinness investigation will look not only at the officers’ behavior but also at the department’s overall response, Pytel said.
The department on Wednesday released a dashcam video recording of the incident. The video provided by a citizen witness shows as many as 50 young people spilling into the slow lane of the roadway. When a gray minivan makes a U-turn and pulls next to the group of people, punches are thrown immediately as the doors open. Several men can be seen punching and kicking the plainclothes officers.
Alexander Reide Craver, 22, and Elijah James Williams, 19, both of West Sacramento, and Antwoine Rashadek Perry, 21, of Elk Grove were arrested for their part in the altercation.
Craver was arrested on suspicion of aggravated battery, assaulting a peace officer, felony obstruction of a peace officer and assault with a deadly weapon. Perry was arrested on suspicion of aggravated battery and felony obstruction
