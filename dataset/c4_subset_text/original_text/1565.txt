Jackson 5 star Tito Jackson returned to Wolverhampton as he continues his hunt for houses in the area.
Clad in a Wolves track suit, the 64-year-old Motown star wandered around the city centre before visiting Molineux – where he walked down the tunnel and sat down on the bench.
Tito stayed at the Mount Hotel and dined at the Memsahib restaurant in Compton during his trip this week.
Tito, one of pop legend Michael Jackson’s older brothers, said: “I’ve been wanting to come back to see another game and will hopefully next time I’m in town.
“Wolves have done great this year and I’m looking forward to them getting promoted. Wolves ay we!
“I think the fans have done a tremendous job supporting their local team.
“Being an entertainer is no different to being an athlete. People screaming their name gives you an extra incentive.
“I wish [his album Tito Time] was doing as well as the Wolves – but it is doing well.
