DALEY BLIND’s proposed move from Manchester United to Roma collapsed because of the Red Devils’ demands, claims his agent. 
Blind was expected to join Roma in a deadline day deal today.
However, the Dutchman saw his hopes of leaving Old Trafford ended when Roma withdrew their interest.
The Rome club have instead moved on to Jonathan Silva from Sporting Lisbon in the hope of completing some deals before 11pm.
And Daley Blind’s agent and father, Danny, has explained how United tried to push through a permanent deal on the reluctant Roma.
“Time is running out because it’s the last day of the transfer window,” for Netherlands manager Danny Blind told Roma 24.
"Yes, I can confirm that Roma want him but Manchester United don’t want to let him go on loan, only on a permanent basis.
“They don’t want to sell him now, only in the summer. The price is good, but the operation is difficult.
Blind, 27, has played just 15 games for United this season.
