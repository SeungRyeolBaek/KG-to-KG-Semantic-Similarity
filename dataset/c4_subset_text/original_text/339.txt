Eli Sister (John C. Reilly) is a frontier hit man with a heart of gold. Familial duty forces the wouldbe shopkeeper  to be one-half of a killing duo with his brother, Charlie (Joaquin Phoenix), a drunk just like their Pa. Together, they are the most-feared hired guns roaming the Oregon plains. Their mission in “The Sisters Brother” -- a darkly funny and (surprisingly) sweet Western -- is to find a prospector/chemist named Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed), torture him until he reveals his secret formula for mining gold, then kill him. Easy peasy. Especially when abetted by John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal), a "lead man" sending the brothers poetic dispatches on Warm’s whereabouts.
The movie -- based on the 2011 novel by Patrick deWitt and adapted and directed by France’s Jacques Audiard (“A Prophet”) -- isn’t as straightforward as it appears. This is not your grandfather’s Western. No, Audiard has more ironic thoughts
