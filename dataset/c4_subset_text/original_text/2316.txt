A ban addressing the controversial practice of gay conversion therapy has passed through its first House committee.
Medical students James Pathoulas and Kevin O' Donnell pose for a portrait on Feb. 22 on campus. The two are part of an effort to ban conversion therapy in Minnesota.
The proposed legislation written by Rep. Hunter Cantrell, DFL-Savage, passed through the Health and Human Services Policy Committee earlier this month. It requires licensed counselors and therapists to outline that conversion therapy is deemed ineffective by major medical organizations. The ban does not apply to pastoral counseling.
Nearly all major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association, have denounced conversion therapy, stating it is not grounded in scientific reasoning and can be detrimental to patients.
Citing the important intersection of medicine and policy, University of Minnesota Medical School students James Pathoulas and Kevin O'Donnell voiced support for the ban.
“This bill is really about protecting people, especially vulnerable people from a fraudulent practice,” O’Donnell said.
