The members of this polygamous cult, located in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas, are in no doubt that God exists – he  lives right next door to them.
Ziona Chana is famous for having the largest family in the world. It totals 163 members, including 38 wives. His polygamous family is not unique, however, as Ziona also leads a polygamous cult of over 1000 people, where male members can have as many wives as they please.
Known as the “New Generation”, the cult was founded by Ziona’s father and uncle when they had an epiphany, and came to believe that the human body is immortal. Both are now dead, but the cult’s followers believe Ziona will live forever and worship him as their God.
