The pending revision of Apple's hobby project picks up a faster GPU.
The FCC diagram that outed the new Apple TV update.
Hot  on the heels of the 128GB iPad, it looks like there's another low-key Apple product launch that's imminent. FCC documents (and one in particular [PDF]) have revealed what looks to be a slightly smaller revision of the Apple TV set-top box that measures about 3.69 inches squared, down from the current model's 3.9 inches. More sleuthing by AnandTech through the recent Apple TV software update also suggests that the box uses an upgraded Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip from Broadcom, as well as an upgraded Apple A5X SoC rather than the A5 in the current model.
The A5X was a revision of the A5 that retained its dual-core Cortex-A9 CPU but upgraded the GPU to a massive quad-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 from Imagination Technologies. This GPU (and the accompanying memory interface upgrades) were necessary to support the third-generation iPad's then-new Retina Display.
