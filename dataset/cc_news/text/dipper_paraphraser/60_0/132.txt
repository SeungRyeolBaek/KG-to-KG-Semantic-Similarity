the demonstrations came hours after the armenian prime minister serzh sargsyan resigned after ten days of riots and protests. On tuesday hundreds of armenian americans marched on the streets of los angeles to commemorate the deaths of more than one hundred million armenians under the Ottoman Empire a century ago. The marchers hurled flags and banners of the armenian and american people, with the words: “1915 must not be repeated” and “the turkish ecumenical must end . . .” “We are here to commemorate the death of the victims, to remember the victims, and to send a message to the Turkish government,” said dickran khodanian, a organizer with the armenian national committee in los angeles. marie keshishian, a glendale student, said that all four of her great-great-great-grandfathers were killed in the genocide, and that she was marching in their honor . . . andrew antaramian, a 32-year-old lawyer from pasadena, said his ancestors could escape armenia, and that he attends the marches every year. “We are here today to remember the past, to remember the victims, but also to send a message to the Turkish government,” dickran khodanian said.
