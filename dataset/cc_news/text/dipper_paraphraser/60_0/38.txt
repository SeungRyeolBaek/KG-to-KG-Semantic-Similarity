He walked up and down, turning the ball over twice. “In that first game we threw up an 18-pointer, but it wasn’t very long,” said Red River coach Kent Riplinger. “It’s really rare to get carried away like that, it’s just one short shift. Sometimes we’re distracted by things and don’t focus on the ball. Then he stepped in and threw up four players in double figures. Lexel robson had a game-high 38 points, but Red River had a better balance , bohm added 12 points and danica kemnitz and reserve maggie steffen added 10 points . Bohm added 12 points, and Kendra Bohm added 10, and the reserve maggie steffen added 10 . . . “that’s something we wanted to do,” ripplinger said. “In the first half we had a run in which we scored on 11 points in a row and turned the ball over twice. Red River got nine points, but at the end we got seven points, and red river got away from the blues only by two points. We needed more offense in our post players, and robson and danica were there to push us over. We needed four in the double figures.
