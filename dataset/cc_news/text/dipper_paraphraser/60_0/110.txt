The audience for the bruno mars night, which was the dominant night of the grammys, was sparse, less than music's major night for nearly a decade, a steep drop of 24 percent from the same night last year. The audience of this year was particularly low, with an absence of the great, the celebrated adele, the beyonce, and taylor swift. It was billed as a big night for rap, and although that may be music's greatest style now, it may not be appealing to some casual music-fans. It had a political message, with hillary clinton reading from the best seller on thetrump administration, fire and fury, and several remarks on women's rights and gun violence. Moreover, the show drew a lot of political topics, and was often interrupted by a cameo by hillary clinton, author of the 'fire and fury' series and a commentary on women's rights and gun violence, and this also caused a reaction on fox news and was a favorite of the president. This year's show was marked by a lack of star power, with adele, beyonce and taylor swift absent. "I can't help wondering why people didn't come out to the tv show when it was a bit political," remarked ainsley earhardt, the host of the morning show 'fox and friends,' a favorite of the president's.
