‘Centurious News went to Dongmen’s Market to inquire about the opinion of ordinary taiwanese on the death of chu-cing (unk —unk) — a famous figure in the entertainment world, whose real name is hsin-ta (unk)—he has been entertaining the taiwanese people for more than forty years, and his reputation for educating young people is well-known. He has won many accolades, and the truth is that he has spent all his life accumulating debts and to the point of disappearing for fifteen years without any sign of life! There was one bad point in him, and that was that he was a gambler. He had been so in debt that he was so badly in debt that he had disappeared for fifteen years without any sign of life. His daughter (Jeannie hsin) is a pretty girl and he borrowed a lot of money to get her treated abroad. This shocked us, but he was a very good person, too, and very helpful to everyone. He always was kind to everyone, and made good people of everyone. He was also a very nice man. He was always polite and helpful to everyone. He was good at being polite and good at talking to everyone, and he always treated everyone with dignity and respect.
