“In the past, according to the laws of the federal constitution, the bakken towns depended on the revenue of the oil tax in order to provide them with the necessary financial support. “In the present case,” said Rep. gary sukut, “you don’t mean you’re against the west,” said Carlson. “Yes, yes,” said Rep. Gary Sukut, “the main sponsor of the bill, said that the bakken towns rely on the revenue from the oil tax to maintain the same level of support as they had received last year . . . . but the bill was amended to include a six-year plan for airports in williston and dickinson, and other petroleum-related grants approved during the last session, but which have not yet been completed due to shortfalls. Representing the bakken metropolitan centers of dickinson, williston, and minot, as well as the smaller municipalities in the oil swab, testified at the hearing that the money is necessary to meet the continuing obligations of the owed districts. Several representatives from the western part of the state spoke in favor of the bill. " We are all on the point of losing our lives in the western part of the state," said Rep. gary sukut, R. W., the chief sponsor of the bill, said the bakken counties and the counties depend on the revenue from oil. " The bill must be approved today, the funding must be determined in the second half of the year," said Rep. denton zubke, r. watford city.
