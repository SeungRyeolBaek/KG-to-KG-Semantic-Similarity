Within an hour of merck announcing the departure of frazier, trump replied: “Ken Frazier of merck pharma has resigned, and now he has more time to bargain, and is also a member of the party expressing the fact that Saturday’s murder of a woman, a woman protesting against the white supremacists, was a terrorism. ” the resignation of frazier was the latest great departure from the advisory council of the White House since trump took office in January. The White House later explained that trump had included “white supremacists, cis-racialists, and all anti-national groups” in his statement on the violence. frazier, who is African-American, said that he was the ceo of merck and, on his own conscience, “an act of resistance against intolerance and extremism.” After trump announced in June that the U.S. would leave the Paris Climate Agreement, the White House said, “As a result of the violence, we will no longer be able to regulate the market.” merck's defection was not enough to hurt the stock: in the first hour of trading merck's shares soared almost a full percentage point to nearly $63. in a statement of his resignation, frazier said: “ America's leaders must recognize the importance of our fundamental values, rejecting the ideas of hatred, bigotry, and the group superiority of all men, which are contrary to the american ideal that all men are created equal.”
