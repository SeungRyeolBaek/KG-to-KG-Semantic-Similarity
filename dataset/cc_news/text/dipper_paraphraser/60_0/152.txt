These are the conclusions of the Committee’s special meeting held today, and they are taken from the statutory report of the Committee. This is the Congressional report that the Committee released to conclude the meeting, below. The report was taken from the Committee on the Rules of the Federal Reserve System. The committee’s conclusions are summarized in a brief but well-balanced note of the directions the Federal Reserve System is taking, in relation to the future economy, as a result of its statutory mandate. In determining the timing and size of the annual adjustments to the Federal Reserve System, the Committee will examine the growth and the growth of wage and hour, as well as the actual inflation. This estimation will take into account a wide variety of information, from the FX system and the Fed System, to the Fed System and other indicators, and from international and domestic news. As a result, the committee expects that with continued gradual adjustments in the Federal Reserve System, activity will expand moderately and employment conditions will remain strong. From a 12 month point of view, both the federal income and wage increases, and the real wage increases, have been steady. The Fed System has insisted on easing inflation gradually, and thus supporting strong employment, and the sustained return to 2 percent inflation. , for the time being, both general and nominal inflation and 12 month inflation continue to remain in the low 2 percent range. This is a fairly balanced position, and the committee is monitoring inflation closely. “Major ” ; jerome H. powell ; randal K. quarles ; and john C. Williams ...”
