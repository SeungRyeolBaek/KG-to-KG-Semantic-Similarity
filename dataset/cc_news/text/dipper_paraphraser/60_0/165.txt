On Saturday morning, in the morning, the kentucky republican reported to msnbc's "today's citizen" that "the people want a different kind of president." he added in the post that: " Msnbc and cnn are unwatchable, and that fox and friends is a good thing!" - the latest Tweet of President Donald Trump (all times local): 6:45 a.m. - President Donald Trump's response to the 'fake news' that has spread around the nation amid the insurrections surrounding the ouster of his national security adviser and the supposed russian involvement in the u.s. presidential election last year, - he said that - he is of the people who elected him. - he bragged about the "fake news" to the "woken" audience. - he said that "the Fake News" is a waste of time, with conspiracy theories and blind hatred, - he said, "this russian connection with russia is simply a propaganda device for the deceit of hillary clinton's election. " - he added that "the @msnbc and cnn are unwatchable, - the @fox and friends is very good!" - he disagreed with trump, who argued that millions of illegal votes in the election were enough to thwart him. Remembering the stunning fall of Flynn, his mistake was not that he discussed u.s. sanctions with the Russian before the inauguration - a potential violation of a rarely observable law - but that he defended it for weeks, apparently misleading vice president mike pence and other senior trump aides about the nature of the conversations. White house officials said they conducted a thorough investigation of Flynn's conduct, with the transcripts of secret conversations that u.s. intelligence officials secretly recorded, but found nothing illegal .
