"she had overdosed." he said, "she had been brought to the chemist's late night, but as the clinic was closed, she left the car without reporting it to police. The state's senate president, howard anderson jr., of turtle lake, sat on the committee and talked of his desire to sponsor the chemist's law, he said, "because we want to save a life, we should not call for help. " In 2016 there were 28 calls for a sabot, and three of them were fatal. In north dakota and in minnesota the good sabot laws are set, and for people who come in and call for drugs, if the person is on the spot and reports to the chemist and the police, up to three people can be granted immunity. The government of north dakota has the law of good sabot in place, which gives immunity to people who call for drugs while they are still on the scene, if they are not first-aid or medical personnel. But too few people know about the law, anderson said, he believes that the law has been avenomous to the police department, despite the law. Forks police said that they did not know of any particular incidents in the town where samaritan law was in force. This article was also printed in the forum news service.
