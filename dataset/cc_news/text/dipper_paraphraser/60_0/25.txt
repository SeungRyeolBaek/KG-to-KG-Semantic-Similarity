The new year marked the 60th anniversary of the landing of the granma, which brought the castro brothers and their beard-clad rebels from mexico to cuba to start a revolution against a u.s.-backed dictatorship. While el comandante, in the year 2008, had given the presidency to his younger brother, raul, he was still a prominent figure. While the parade normally takes place every five years, this year it was postponed by a month due to the death of his brother, who died in late november. Meanwhile, in the second half of last year, the communist ruled cuba has fallen into a recession, its first since the collapse of the Soviet Union, a quarter century ago, and its strategic ally venezuela are struggling. The military troops wielding automatic rifles marched on in lockstep behind the granma, followed by a sea of banners and flags waving in cubans, many gathered in and organized their activities through their homes and neighbourhoods. " His son may not be here physically, but he is in all our hearts," said natalia gonzales, who had painted "i am fidel" on the foreheads of her three grandchildren. " this is an important message of unity and strength," said rene lazo, 66, who like most got up at dawn to participate in the parade. "He may not be there physically, but he is in all our hearts," said natalia gonzales, who had painted "i am fidel" on the foreheads of her three grandchildren. “You can’t get the news by broadcast now, only fidel’s speeches have been left out of the press for the last thirty years. To offset the dwindling oil supplies from venezuela and the loss of cash for doctors and other workers abroad . . . ” — “That’s just one way of keeping it from becoming too flimsy, so there’s a lot of propaganda,” said Antonio Sosa, who was also an engineer, and did not attend the parade.
