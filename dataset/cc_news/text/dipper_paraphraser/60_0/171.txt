Andrey Pavlovich, Andrey Pavlovich, and Ta-j oshie ended a lengthy goal drought to help the washington capitals lead the win over the philadelphia flyers 5-3 on saturday night. stephenson scored twice, he went without a goal for 28 games, burakovsky scored on the power play after missing 10 games, and oshie lifted his arms and looked up at the sky when he scored on the power play to end his 13-game drought. The flyers jumped out of the first frame when patrick made the most of his promotion to the second line and scored on a 2 - on 1 rush with wayne simmonds. And the air! the flyers were in the ascendancy. 1 pick nolan patrick, konecny and jakub voracek scored for philadelphia. . . . and in the first half, when philadelphia were in the lead, the flies came into play, a game in which the flies trailed by a score of 0 - 0. 36. Braden holtby stopped 27 of the 30 shots, including an important glove save on Travis Konecny and a few saves against philadelphia captain claude giroux. Nolan patrick made his nhl debut in the absence of neuvirth, and he stopped five shots in anticipation of the first start of the new jersey state tournament. the flies got off to a hot start when patrick took advantage of his promotion to center on the right flank by scoring a 2 on 1 run with wayne simmond smith - pelly was replaced by healthy jakub vrana, who has scored one goal in 13 games ... * smith - pelly's goal was his first since jan. 2 ... neuvirth and lyon were the Philadelphians' twins, because brian elliott is on injured reserve, and neuvirth and lyon are philadelphia's starting goalies because brian elliott is out on a reserve for a lower-body injury ... soooo, soooooooo, then - ah, sooooooooooooh, sooooooooh, sooooooooh !
