In the case of a murder of a Russian journalist, Arkady Babchenko, it was necessary for the ukrainian spies to make up for the death of the russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, a murder, that the kremlin was preparing and he expected to receive more international attention, therefore he might have flung himself into a blind corner. – if he doesn’t come up with any solid evidence in the future, he will be heading for a blind corner, if he has not prepared. Could the ukrainian spies have kept the wife in the dark? The journalist, in a live broadcast, apologized to his wife, saying, “My special apologies, Olechka, there was no other option.” this is a contradiction that must be clarified. After the incident, a special operation was carried out by ukrainian spies that has left more questions than answers. It is possible that a plan was awaited, but this operation was a special operation of ukrainian spies, which left more questions than answers. Moreover, the spies were not informed about the murder, and the kremlin accused kyiv of manipulating the international community with a story of fake murder. if the whole world knows about the planned assassination, it is possible that kremlin is accusing Kryv of influencing the international community with a false story.
