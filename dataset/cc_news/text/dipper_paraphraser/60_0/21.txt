On the most recent day, however, the price was about 10 percent, but very volatile in comparison with fiat currencies, but much lower than in the previous year, which saw price rises as much as 40 percent. bitcoin was probably spurred in part by the increased demand in china, by a 7 percent decline in the value of the yuan, the weakest of the 20 in a decade. But the currency is very popular in the world, and it does not have a central authority, but relies on thousands of computers all over the world to verify transactions and add new bitcoins to the system, and bitcoin has surged by two or three per cent since late 2013, but has been more stable during the last two years. As a result of the increasing focus on cash and capital controls, bitcoin may seem to have become a viable, if risky, alternative. And the growth of the war on cash and capital controls have made bitcoin a viable and perhaps high risk alternative, â€œ said paul gordon, president of the uk digital currency association and co-founder of Quantave, a firm which seeks to make it easier for institutional investors to access bitcoin exchanges. In 2016, most of its daily moves were 10 percent, still very volatile compared to fiat currencies, but rather less volatile than those of fiat currencies, which fluctuated as much as 40 percent daily.
