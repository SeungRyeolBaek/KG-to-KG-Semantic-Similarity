the china armed forces are waiting for the generals in southern China, and taiwan would be an ideal spot to set up a thaad system, for which the chinese are still on the fire, and to protect the air space over hsinchu, miaoli, taichung and nantou counties. “As a matter of fact, as the country’s defense ministers strive to finish the thaad system in time for the end of the year, the hong kong press published a report that the US military would sell the system to taiwan in order to jointly launch an east Asian ‘nato jet network’ with japan and the South China Sea. According to the hong kong newspaper Asiaweek, a Chinese newspaper, reported that taiwan is about to acquire 150 f-35a conventional fighters and 60 short-range vertical-distance fighters, to replace the aging mirage 2000s and indigenous defense fighters (idf) and F-five tigers, but taiwan may remark that a shortfall in the number of f-35 fighters would be a good reason for the us to propose taiwan buy the f-35a system. It was said that a few months ago the u.s. military newspaper, a newspaper called asia-week, published an article by former Taiwan naval commander lu li-shih.
