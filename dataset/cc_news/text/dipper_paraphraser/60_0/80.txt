But if you want to know about the 22 million american girls whose sales were conducted during the last thirty years, i have seen absolutely nothing. Except for some of the children whose names were mentioned in the ads, the dozens of strange and wonderful characters of which any child could hope to meet - even the chance to own them - none have ever been mirrors in which I could see myself . take julie, "a delightful, joyful, passionate girl, full of energy and new ideas, but sometimes afraid of the upheaval of the world around her"? well, I know her very well, but i still don't know her . . . . the newest addition to the list, logan is pale and rather sickly, with an apparent lack of vitamin D and a tame bob, not quite a good shape, his smile is only convincing half the time, his eyes are kind but sad, like blue windows into the mind of someone who keeps trying to hide a constant state of worry. If this doll is just like me, . . . . . not me . . . wait a moment . that doll is . . . me . . . but as I told you, this one is "the son of tenney grant, a singer in nashville, tennessee. " Please, everyone knows that she is my nemesis. I send to the logan everetts of the world a voice. It's about time.
