the trump administration has begun to roll back tough fuel standards for the american automobile fleet. The environment agency and the transportation department have opened the public comment period for the revising of the rules for car and light truck emissions for model year 2022 and 2025. “We have concluded that the regulations on this subject are correct and in line with our timetable,” said epa director Scott Pruitt on friday. The auto industry is applauding the decision to bring back the fuel standards. The new regulations called for a greater dependence on electric vehicles. The low gas prices and lack of widespread sales of alternative fuels have made the meetings more difficult for them, especially for those businesses with a larger and heavier reliance on the vehicle. The polluting and consumer organizations, the environmental and consumer group, remonstrated that the government had made the rule permanent. In addition, shannon baker-branstetter with the consumer’s union says that consumers are particularly concerned about fuel efficiency. According to a recent survey, 94 percent of the americans say they want to raise fuel efficiency. But baker-branstetter added that consumers are particularly concerned about the fuel efficiency of the crossovers and the SUVs they are driving. The polluting and regulatory bodies praised the change. “You’re trying to be aggressive,” said brinley. “But, even if the u.s. keeps its limits, it’s probable that the movement towards higher standards will still happen in other countries. Already this year several countries have been putting off the sale of gasoline for the last five years. Many speculators believe that a reversal of standards would spoil the prospects for electric vehicles . . .
