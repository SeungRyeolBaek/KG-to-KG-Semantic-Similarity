One more jury will be seated, to decide whether to put roof to death, but first the judge must decide whether he can represent himself or whether he will be represented by the appointed lawyers. The court heard the same testimony last month on 33 counts of federal hate crimes, resulting in death, disobedience of religion and firearms violations. The jury will be again seated to decide whether to put roof to death, but first the judge will have to decide whether he will represent himself or whether he will be represented by the appointed lawyers. The judge rejected arguments from public counsel jay bender and assistant public prosecutor jay richardson, who asked for an open hearing. a lawyer named david bruck represented roof during the criminal investigation. Roof's lawyer, a former prisoner, has represented himself during the criminal investigation and the jury has opted to refrain from hearing any testimony about his mental state or his conduct. Moreover, he has barred all relatives of the victims from going to the trial. he also said that he was afraid the jurors would not heed the news and inadvertently hear something prejudicial that could be injurious. The judge held a special council of lawyers in charge of the prosecution. The defendant has chosen to take on the case as he goes to the court, which begins tomorrow, and seeks to prevent the jury from hearing evidence about his mental state and ability.
