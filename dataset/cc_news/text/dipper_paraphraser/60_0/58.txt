After a while, they realized that the well had also been sprayed with oil. Upon their investigation, the crew of the drill-rig reported that it was “spreading” or rising up approximately three feet. The upward movement of the well, the pressure gauge breaking, prevented the pumping of the gas into the well, which adec reported. bp began drilling in the huge prudhoe-bay field in 1968, which produced more than 12 billion barrels of oil, according to bp, and is now one of the largest oil-fields in the world. This leak took place amid efforts to increase oil production from the older wells and get new supplies for the north-slope oil fields, reports bloomberg. " In march the production of the north-slope oilfield increased by fifty-five thousand barrels a day, and bp has remained one of the largest oilfields in the world," bp reported. "Found the well " and the pressure gauge broke, and the pressure was removed, and this prevented the activation of the well and gas flow to the well," adec reported.
