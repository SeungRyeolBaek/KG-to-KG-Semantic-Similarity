bumblebees, or wild honeybees, are not loved as much as honeybees, but they should. They are just as important pollinators of many fruits, vegetables and wildflowers, and, compared with hyacinths, they are in great danger. A group of scientists in the United Kingdom decided to look at how bumblebee queens are affected by certain well-known and controversial pesticides, the so-called neonicotinoids. These pesticides are "systemic," that is, they move through the plants, they find their traces in the pollen which the bees eat. It was reported in the journal Nature ecology and evolution that bumblebee queens, unrecognized, had 26 percent less chance of laying eggs than queens unrecognized, which were unrecognized. The team of scientists from Royal Holloway University of London set up a laboratory experiment with queens. They fed the queens with a syrup containing traces of a pesticide called thiamethoxam, and they said that this pesticide was as small as the amount of the pesticide which bees should have eaten near neonic plants. According to raine and his colleagues, the number of eggs in the colony is so great that the queens can no longer repopulate. The queens that were exposed to the pesticide were 26 percent less likely to repopulate than the queens who were not exposed to the pesticide. It is important and significant, but other factors are also important and important," he says. "The results will likely strengthen the calls for further restrictions. The european Union imposed in 2013 a temporary prohibition on the use of neonicotinoid pesticides on many crops, and is now considering proposals to make this prohibition permanent. pesticide companies and some farmers are fighting this prohibition. They say that the prohibition has led to lower yields of canola and an increase in the use of other pesticides to fight insects which were previously controlled by neonicotinoid coatings on seeds . . .
