I saw this video – it showed how often people have asked iris to be speaking to the native language. The video was made by an iris enthusiast who lived in Taipei, a city known for its friendly and friendly nature, who then decided to produce a video to answer the question of her own. “It’s the best video he’s ever produced,” said Angie Yu and Wukong. “It shows the good and the bad in the taiwanese character. “I swore to the dying that this is the most excellent video I’ve ever seen in the country.” As she was a tourist she first asked the information service in the metro station and the information counter in the administrative office, and both of these people answered her questions in English, and she soon arrived at her destination, buying a tasty pork-soup and a cup of green tea, and a laundress from a tea shop introducing the most popular drinks and explaining the menu to her in English, while the assistant in the bakery of the bakery explained all the products in their stores. She then approached a Taiwanese woman and a man on the road, and asked them to tell her how to get to their destination again. The two Taiwanese men were able to understand what she was saying and pointed out the way. Many people who watched the video said that it was better than any of the videos from the taiwan tourist office. The girl asked a lot of people, so she thought to create a video to find out how the people in Taipei spoke English.
