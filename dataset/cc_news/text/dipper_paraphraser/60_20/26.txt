Obliging the jury, the jury found strommen guilty of the worst offence in the city. Doarmen, who stayed silent through the entire hearing, only shaken his head when d’yon asked him to tell the story, “I just wanted him to look at me, my kids, and see what I’m supposed to be doing with my kids each day.” The prosecution, however, failed to convince the jury that strommen’s shove had killed strommen, for he disputed the fact that strommen’s shove had hit him, which he did not see, but rather suggested that the victim had slipped on the ice. After defending strommen, d’yon ordered him to serve 90 days in prison, which is the maximum period of imprisonment in the state of Minnesota. , and he was ordered to pay $1,400 in court fees and fines. strommen did not say he was trying to push him, but he said he never saw him fall, but that the victim had fallen on the ice. And that same week, a week later, in the altru hospital in grandforks, he died.
