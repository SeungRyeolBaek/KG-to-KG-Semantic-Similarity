I recently found a keylogger in a keyhole on many hp laptops, according to security firm Modzero. a keylogger is a keylogger that is hidden on hp laptops, and it can be used for spying on hp's reputation among users. " The hidden keyhole is the work of security blogger michael myng, who also goes by the name of zwclose, and he looked for some information on how the keys of certain models were backlit. " When he read the post, he noticed the code of a keylogger, and looked into it more closely, but because he didn't have an hp laptop, he couldn't look more deeply, so he reached out to hp. After myng first noticed what looked like a keylogger, he tried to dig it out, but as he didn't have an hp laptop, he couldn't look at it as deeply as he wanted, so he called hp. hp has since released a list of the affected notebooks, including a link to the update. The logging system is enabled by default, but it can be enabled by setting the value in the registry (user's responsibility) , " he said. It’s just a matter of following the instructions of hp’s official website. Then you can follow the instructions for updating your computer.
