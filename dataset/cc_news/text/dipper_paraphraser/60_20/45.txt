The idea of these exchange programs is the most sound and efficient way of improving our national security. By more sharing with the world we can strengthen our country. The american camp association reports that more than 11 million americans attend residential or day camps each year. There are more than 900 counselors from all over the world, and of that number about 135 are foreigners from 30 countries, on six continents. The country is strengthened by closer dialogue with the world, more than anything else , the ambassadors from all over the world declare that it is more useful to make these exchanges than to make them narrow. Our exchange students say that they finished their courses with a better impression of the United States . They are introduced to the time honored camp song and the music of the camp ; and they share their stories and their traditions with the campers who have never been to egypt, germany, or argentina. This is all citizen diplomacy in the best possible sense, which is attained through the u.s. Department of State's "J-1" exchange program, which has a category for counselors from a particular country and the people of a certain religious or social background . the u.s. state 's "jest" programs, which have a category for counselors, are already taking advantage of, as a bonus, of these international exchanges. of the number of staff, about 135 are foreigners from the various countries of the world. These international exchanges are made easier by the interaction of foreigners with foreigners, and more enjoyable in the camp for the campers than in the world. For many people, this is the first time they have been in the United States.
