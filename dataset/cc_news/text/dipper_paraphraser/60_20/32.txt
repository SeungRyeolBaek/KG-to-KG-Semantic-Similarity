Every sensible person should tell people about their dreams and hopes as soon as possible. . . . but what is the significance of this if they have such a big idea, e.g., to set yourself up for a new effort, to have a new diet, to eat better, to lose weight, to write a book or to start a business. . . . well, perhaps not. But there’s a catch: if you’re bombarded with these warm feelings, you’re less likely to put in the effort to achieve your goal. And what if you tell someone your aim? You get a bit of a blow-up of yourself, a surge of resentment, a feeling of “completeness,” or something like that. My own opinion is that it really depends on the person and on the goal you’re trying to achieve. If you have a large goal, say, a new exercise regime, a new diet, a new diet, a new diet, a new business, then you need to tell as many people as possible — well, maybe not. But what derek says is that “a social sanction” — a reward, a celebration, a compliment from one or another, a gratitude, or a lot of reassuring emotions flow from your heart. As you listen to your friend’s encouragement, their praise and their acknowledgement, you feel it is wonderful , it feels good to be accepted, taken seriously, it has a warming and fuzzy feeling — that’s why we need to tell people about our goals. If your goal is to tell about a new fitness regime, or to lose weight, or to write a book You might try a different approach. Perhaps you’ll find more success if you use a no-talk, no-action approach. You may find it easier to take a no-talk, no-action approach. My personal goal was to write more articles and get them polished and ready for publication so that I’d no longer have to worry about writing during the holiday. But instead , a winter virus had taken its toll on me.
