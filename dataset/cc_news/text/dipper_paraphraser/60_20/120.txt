Wellington, New Zealand (ap) - the christchurch-based crusaders will consolidate their place at the super rugby table when they play the hamilton-based chiefs in an abbreviated 16th round, before the tournament begins for the june internationals. " Coach scott robertson said that the victory of a depleted side over the star-studded hurricanes "was a very proud night in the history of the crusaders . " They have a very good scrum, he said, and they have a good scrum, he said. "The chiefs have an extremely good scrum," said robertson, "and given the injuries they have played very well with the players who are coming in for them, and that will be a big battle. " he said that the crusaders are not taking for granted a win on Saturday, if the leaders of the competition are ill or suspended, they are in no way assured that the eight-time champions will win the title for the second time. " he said that the fans were unsure what to expect, and that probably sums it up, 'the emotion which was shown during the game', robertson said. ' The crusaders have an extremely good scrum,' said robertson. ' They have very good players,' said robertson. ' They are very good with the ball,' said robertson. ' They kick more than any other team,' said robertson. ' They kick more than anyone else,' said boyd.
