I don’t know whether he’s ever heard anyone else talk about the brilliant work of the outstanding women who serve in the office of the director of und , what he doesn’t, and I find it a pity to see them. I don’t know what I’ve not heard from either side, and that irritates me is to see them praise and praise the awesome work of the remarkable women who work in the director of und . The director of und’s official motto is Lux et lex – light and law . . . and the coordinator is an embodiment of this motto, helping students, staff and faculty to reach their potential and be more and more productive by lighting the way for us. The event coordinator is one of these women. They are not simply fundraisers, welcome parties, or retirees, they are not just formalities, banquets, or ceremonies, they are visits by renowned authors, artists, scientists and teachers, gatherings of the state board, athletic events, alumni events, legislative conferences, workshops, and media interviews. Every one of these events is not simply a function of luck, but of hard work, which is part of the activity, prior to, during, and after the event. And she deserves our praise, respect, and profound thanks. michelle Bowles Grandforks the writer is the director of the university's professional review board.
