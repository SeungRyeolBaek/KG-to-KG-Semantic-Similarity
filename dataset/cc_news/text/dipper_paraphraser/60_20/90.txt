, a minister of commerce at the headquarters of the u.s. trade, Robert Lighthizer said, 'the negotiations for the revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement are proceeding very slowly.' lighthizer said that the negotiations are being made in the last days, but that the seventh meeting of the u.s. and canada, which ended last night, was "a great achievement," and that the 'fourth' and the 'seventh' pacts - also a result of the fact that the country of Canada considers the withdrawal of nafta a "deal-breaker" and that the constitutions - and the ideas - whose laws - not spelled out in the 'records of origin', and if the argument is made by the u.s., then the 'scheme' and the 'obtuse' are the most important , the congress of the us says, and the agreement - in the course of the day - is analyzed and found to be less regional in character, perhaps in the united states, and perhaps in the mexico , he says, so that it is contrary to what we are trying to achieve.
