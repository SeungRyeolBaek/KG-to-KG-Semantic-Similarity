ai in agriculture is an example of a detailed analysis of climate, soil, and historical satellite imagery, and is able to suggest how best to grow the crops and ascertain the best possible crop yield. See: ai and machine learning ( Zdnet) – download the report as a pdf (technology pro research) – 4 . stop predators ai can help put together resumes and to select the right candidates. unilever, for example, had an ai called hireVue used to analyze the candidate’s body language and tone, and thus reduced the time of the hiring process and increased the level of acceptance. In the new study, watson published the ai-like method of assessing the effectiveness of ai-based medicine, and while you can debate its effectiveness, others like intel are also studying it, and are making rapid advances in the field of precision medicine. In a way, to counter the countering powers of ai, here are five different applications: 1. In agriculture ai-based analysis is a complex data analysis which covers the weather, the soil, the historical imagery of the country, and can help the farmer ascertain what type of plants to expect and how to maximize the yield. Then the computer interpretation of the images of medical images can be used to redress medical images if needed. 4. In ai-based management ai-based management is very much in demand, and although it is disputed how effective ai is, other intel experiments are also making great progress; ai-based management can compare molecular analysis with the previous case, to improve health and to improve crop yields.5
