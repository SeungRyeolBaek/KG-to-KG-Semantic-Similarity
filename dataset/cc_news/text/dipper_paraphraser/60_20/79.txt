There’s a break with the tradition of the British monarchy, for the purpose of disentangling the emotional burdens of the young royal family. Prince harry has given an interview about his emotionally draining struggles during the years of his mother’s public death, and how he had finally found help in his late 20s. He pleaded with the telegraph, saying, “I can safely say that my mother’s death at the age of 12 and therefore my aloofness for the last twenty years has had quite a serious effect on not only my personal life but also my professional life as well.” He said he wanted to do something to help a friend. “I was always in a state of despair; I thought that it would only make you sad, and not bring her back . . .” He spoke to the telegraph, saying: “I had become so tormented that he sank into a heap of grief, lie, distortion and all kinds of unpleasantness and that I should be able to take it all in. ” he explained: “I had to keep my head in the sand, to keep my mind completely detached from my emotions, because he didn’t want to talk about my mother , I said to myself, ‘you shouldn’t let your emotions get in the way of anything.’
