‘That would have ended my career,’ she said, ‘and I would have been arrested by the Guardians of the Air,’ said Liva this week at the national squad of brazil’s football club in London. And this year, the brazilian defender will be back playing at the world cup in london.’ Another psg player, marquinhos, and inter-imperial defender Miranda have been playing in many of brazil’s matches. Silva, who is now playing for paris Saint–Germain alongside the Brazilian defender neymar, has never played a game for dynamo but was the captain of the national team at the last world cup. During the summer of 2005, when Silva had his health problems, it was coach ivo wortmann who prevented the defender from having surgery on his lungs. ‘I knew thiago from brazil and took him to porto b and decided to transfer to russia,’ wortmann, who is also brazilian, told the world. ‘I told them no one would have opened my husband’s chest and put an end to his career,’ said Silva, who now plays for Paris Saint-Germain alongside her brazilian teammate neymar, who did not play for dynamo but ended up winning the last world cup. ‘Well, if I get to wear my badge again, that will be a great honour,’ said silva. ‘But if I don’t, I will try to act in the same way as if I were not in the team.’
