If we havenâ€™t got it, then we need to have a robust research plan to promote the development of the strongest possible secure communications systems. Why is the encryption process so open to hackers and criminals? Here s us policy director amie stepanovich has been talking to the Ottawa, Ontario and Australian parliamentary clerks to explain why this may be a bad idea. The equivalence of encrypted communications, she said, is not an unbreakable system, but a much less secure one, so if a government allows a criminal or terrorist to have access to information, it will only increase the threat of criminals and crime, because the encryption method is not a secure one. she added that a proper method of encrypting data is not a one-way system, so a bad way is to create a fraud. She reiterated the need for privacy as a means of protecting consumers' privacy, communication between journalists and sources, whistleblowers and intellectual property. The reason for this policy, which turnbull proposed, is that we should promote the process of encryption in the world, because this will have an impact on the rest of the world, because the policy of encryption can be a precedent for other countries. stepanovich pointed out that this policy is not against criminals and terrorists, but also against criminals. For example, some require keys to be stored in third-party facilities and can be easily stolen.
