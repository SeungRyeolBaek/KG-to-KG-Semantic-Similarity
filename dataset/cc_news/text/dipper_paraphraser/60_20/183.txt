“The geologist in the region who has examined the rice in this area figured out that a few quarters of the area in which the riparian lilies grow in the area, mainly in the mountains of the south and east, was found to be favourable to the production of japonica rice. Thus it was found that the region, lying between the mountains of taipei and Mount tatun, was a rich breeding-ground for ponlai (japonica rice) in the era of the colonial period. In the present, however, the area of zhuvu had, as a starting-ground, been cultivated as early as the beginning of the century. From 1895 to 1945 the valley had been cultivated. The geologist had advised that using the stream of water (dinghu) at the foot of the hill, the geotechniker had acquiesced the stream of water, which had been used for raking the rice, to the newly constructed stream-bed, he had connected it with the newly constructed irrigation canal, which was used for raking the rice in the old days. This latter activity, in accordance with the geologist’s comments, was completed in the course of the course. The geologist had thus arranged for a walk to a certain roadside farm and garden of yangming-shan, and ended with a visit to the historical site of the site.
