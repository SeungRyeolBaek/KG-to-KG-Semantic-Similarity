And so, one night after hitting the first home run of his career, the chicago cubs' 240-pound (110-kilogram) first baseman Matt Harvey hit his first pitch over the left-center fence at citi Field for his fifteenth home run of the season, prompting cheers from the dugout giddy huddle. "That's a pretty frightful thing that they are talking about in the dugout, and they're giving it a run," he said. "But I said it in the first game, if it's a little ridiculous, and they give it a lot of air, " he said. "It's really silly of them to show us a lot of what we talk about in the dugout, you know, we're talking all the time, saying: ' Look, it's going to be 1-0, it's going to be 1-0 again, but it's my fault, I'm really not very happy with all this. ' the other day, he launched zack wheeler's second pitch at 42 inches, in a rout that put the Mets to 14-5. â€˜Com / tag / mlbbaseball
