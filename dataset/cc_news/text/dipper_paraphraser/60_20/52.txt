The school announced the announcement on the floor of the campus of the texas a&m university, and it was apparently out of concern for the safety of its students, faculty, staff and public. “As a result of the last weekend’s events, both university and state officials expressed strong objections, but lawyers and one university regent had reasoned that the protections of the First Amendment were impossible. After a number of presentations, he said he had signed up to protest in the “freedom of expression” on the university campus on the 11th, but had not heard from any one at the school since he announced it. In the first reports were made on the floor of the university, and then on the floor of the university’s house. “Yesterday,” said he, “the white nationalist rally being held on the campus of the university of texas was canceled out of concern for the safety of students, faculty, staff and public. The university was forced to cancel the event in part because of a breach of regulations by the university administration, and especially the superintendent of the school, john sharp. “It is not possible for texas a&m to challenge the university’s adherence to the First Amendment and freedom of speech,” the university said in a statement Monday afternoon. During the previous afternoon the legislators had been persuaded by the university officials and by the superintendent of the university, in particular, by a lawyer named greg abbott, to stop the event. At the time of the announcement, University and State leaders expressed strong objections, but legal experts and one regent had said that the First Amendment was not allowed.
