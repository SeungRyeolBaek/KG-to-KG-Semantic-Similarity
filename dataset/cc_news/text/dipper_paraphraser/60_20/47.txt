We felt that it was very important that we organize a day for the events, together with all the other actions that are taking place in canada and in the rest of the united states, that is, today, the next day. We decided that it would be a very important event to carry out in collaboration with other events that are happening all over canada and in the whole of the united states, “ kingbird was one of about 100 participants who gathered in the parking lot of the John glas field house on tuesday for the first indigenous women's march in the city, as well as men and children, in solidarity with other events taking place in the nation, in order to show our anger at the gross violence of indigenous women. The protestors held signs and wore red shawls, and they surrounded the marchers in the streets, which were honked in the middle by people passing through the alley. They held signs and wore red shawls as they marched from the field house to the memorial union of the city of hobson. People hailed the march from the field house to bsu ’s hobson memorial union, and the march was greeted by honking carriages on Bemidji Avenue. “It is a very sad and sad event for almost everyone in the room. We have decided to organize it today with other things going on all over canada and all over the United States,” said organizer audrianna goodwin. “We have never been at all responsible for hurting women,” said goodwin. “I don’t know how to express this to you, but i can’t stress it enough that we aren’t our own people.”
