The world heat map is published by strava, a GPS tracking company, for which it uses satellite information to analyze the location and movement of people who subscribe to the company's fitness service over a two-year period by illuminating the locations and activities of people who use fitness trackers, namely the army and the rest of the people who live on the bases of the u.s. and europe. The map of the world heat map is not yet live, but was published on a recent basis. It shows a significant increase in activity in the u.s. and europe, but in the war zones and deserts of the u.s., in countries like iraq and syria, the map is almost completely dark, except for scattered activity.
