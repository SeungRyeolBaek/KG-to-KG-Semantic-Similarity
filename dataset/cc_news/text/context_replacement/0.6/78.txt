- via snl . harry styles was the musical guest on saturday night live this year and , after releasing his debut solo album , appeared on the very large ( both physically and logistically ) snl stage . he also seemed very happy about releasing this — which should have been a surprise to my coworkers , but could also be a surprise to me . love , harry . my little elven boy . many thought that your debut album would be successful , but i didn ’ ##t because i love and respect you , and i always will , even if you are my # # ##child or , better yet , a child . you broke my heart when you required me to sit through two minutes of morgan spurlock ’ ##s one hour of this is america and my heart has never forgotten that fact , not once . from “ : since new year , ” some of the songs you liked , even those that did not know you like i did . he was a little ryan adams , a legend ‘ in punk rock in the 1980s , and 100 % hottie with the guitar ( which ’ was young , which ’ was young ! ) , but with your cute little face and the guitar that sounds like you ’ just finished playing . reason is , you cannot buy / sellread this book and very much enjoy it . in fact , all i ask is that you take me out to dinner and kiss me on the cheek . you really were so very sexy in a black suit ( “ you should wear a black suit , ” i texted my mom after watching you perform ) to me “ most of the night , ” a song you liked very much . it sounded a bit like an aerosmith song , which might sound like an insult , but i assure you that i meant it as a compliment . truth is you should also sing and wear a suit , showing some skin that most people would ’ ##t for . you were so adorable as mick jagger , a role that was probably originally written so that jimmy fallon could carry out a very similar john travolta role : well , i think you did a great job across the board and i , well , everyone else did .
