karen gajeski , the center ' s executive director , said the purpose of the event was to help seniors meet new people . she said she often heard seniors say that they did not have anyone with whom to do business . " that ' s kind of one of the main reasons why we ( we ) , we want to check this out , " she said . " even if they can ' t find us , which we ' re not currently doing . " two men and two women attended . they came in together and stayed for several minutes at a time , then left as a group again . the women said they came into the center for a fun time without drinking . " i ' m at an age now where it ' s more fun , meeting new people , " said bobbie , a member of the group who refused to give her own name . " it ' s not that i think i ' m going to find a boyfriend or anything . it ' s just just having fun together . " they noted on a piece of paper if they were interested in getting to know anyone they met before . gajeski also placed some cards on the table in case any of the participants needed help breaking the rules , but the cards seemed to be untouched . everyone chatted casually .until the time came to join them . jim laturnus said he felt he had a lot in common with some of the people he met . " i had nothing to say , really , " he said of his decision to come to the event . " i was just looking for friends . i did meet some of these new people , too . they ' re all wonderful . every single one of them has something in common . " " we all had a great time , learning a little more about each other , " roxie smith said . " i ' m really glad we did . " she says she does everything with the most positive attitude . " a sense of community is the best thing to have to get going in life , " she said . gajeski said in the future , the event management will hold a special event for children , so they can meet new people . " there ' s a lot of children that have come here . it would be good for them to be close to other people . "
