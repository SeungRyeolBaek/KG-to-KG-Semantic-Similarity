salt lake city ( ap ) â€” a judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a kenyan muslim imam who said he was initially placed on a government watch list and was blocked from leaving kenya with his family last year . the special immigration permit required for yussuf abdi upon arrival since the ban was lifted is not valid , u . s . district judge dee benson wrote on the opinion page . while the right to travel is guaranteed by the constitution , " the supreme court has not upheld the right to free and unlimited movement , " benson said . lawyers for abdi , an imam and u . s . citizen , said the ban was more than an excuse . they haven ' t decided if they ' ll appeal the ban . " as yussuf abdi ' s lawyer makes clear , being on a government watch list can separate citizens from their country , " judge gadeir abbas said monday . the law helped bring abdi back from prison last year , and the travel has become easier for him since the case was dismissed , abbas said . the lawsuit was filed after abdi returned to kenya to bring home his wife and two children , who had received government permission to join him in the u . s . abdi was initially banned fromon the plane back to the u . s . he was only allowed to leave two days later , when his case went to court and the u . s . attorney ' s office for utah ruled on his behalf . since then , he ' s made several trips , made a religious pilgrimage to saudi arabia , and was subject to additional security checks that indicate he ' s on a watch list of individuals targeted for # ##dition , according to court documents . the fbi said abdi was added to a watch list in 2014 that let him go but required additional security checks . he refused to be charged , saying he had no criminal record and no reason to be on the list . abdi has lived in utah for six years and is the imam of salt lake city ' s madina masjid islamic center .
