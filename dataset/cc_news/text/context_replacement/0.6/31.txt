" it was just a little rough , ' ' red river forward jordan polynice said of the riders ' early scoring run . " we had good shots . they just weren ' t good . " " we went to the basket and started shooting . that ' s when we ' re at our best , in a fast - paced game . ' ' polynice scored 13 of his career - high 21 points on the drive , after which the riders drove past the three points in a 1 : 48 stretch to take a 34 - 29 lead . pierson also made a three - point shot on the next possession ; again , it was red river , central getting the basket . and they picked up three points on it . " we haven ' t seen the whole game like that , ' ' said red river coach kirby krefting , whose record was 28 - 28 at halftime .

" red river has a good defensive team , ' ' head coach dan carlson said . " we expected them to make a run at some point . and we couldn ' t get on that play to slow them down . that ' s what happened . we ' ve had a tough time starting this season . ' ' knutson scored 13 points and ohnstad 11 to lead the 24 - 22 knights . ohnstad finished with 12 points , just shy of a double double .
