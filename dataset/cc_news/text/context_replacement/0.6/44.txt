what i haven ' t heard from either side , and which i find interesting , is the recognition and appreciation of the hard work of the five women who served in the office of the president of und . the event coordinator was one of these women . president robert brown chose not to mention her in his will , and i will respect her decision and do the same . but she deserves to be recognized and honored for her contributions to und . there are many on campus who have contributed so much to this institution with little to no official recognition . if you have ever attended an official und event that involves the administration and the faculty , you have seen her . things on campus happen largely not by her , but by the hard work she put in before , during and after the event . the administration and faculty understand her work very well . a final note describes these " events " : they are not any formal , formal events or event ##s . they are lectures by famous writers , artists , musicians , and politicians ; meetings of the editorial board ; corporate meetings ; faculty meetings ; congressional hearings ; conferences ; media events ; and the list goes on . to compare the incredible multi - tasks that the event coordinator can perform to just one of the most difficult tasks , the list itself is often di##sservice to her for time and service to und . und ' s official motto is lux et lex â€” light and truth . the book coordinator is the voice of truth , encouraging students , staff and faculty to do more and be better by paving the way for others . she has our love , respect and our support . michelle smith - - the author is the book and event coordinator for the division of business and economic development at und . the views she offers are her own and are not meant to be a reflection of the values of the students or faculty .
