washington ( ap ) — an infrared map found online can show the locations and activities of people who use fitness devices such as fitbit , raising security concerns about soldiers and other people who are at u . s . military bases in sensitive areas . the global heat map , developed by the gps tracking company strava , uses this information to track the locations and movements of subscribers to the company ' s fitness service over a two - year period , including their level of activity , the washington post reported online . strava says it has 10 million subscribers around the world , including people who own commercially available fitness devices , as well as people who directly subscribe to the mobile app . the map is not live , but shows a pattern of accumulated activity between 2015 and early 2017 . the map shows a great deal of activity in the u . s . and abroad . when in war zones and conflicts in countries such as iraq and afghanistan , the heat map becomes almost entirely invisible — except for faint evidence of activity . a closer look at those areas brings into focus the locations and outlines of well - known u . s . military bases , as well as " lesser - known and potentially sensitive sites — , because american soldiers and other people are using fitness devices as they move around . the global heatmap was posted online in november 2017 , but the information it provides was not publicized recently . the map could provide information to someone who wants to attack or ambush us , the post said . dod officials are looking into the matter to determine how to respond " dod takes incidents like these very seriously and is reviewing the situation to determine if any additional training or assistance is needed , and if any additional measures must be developed to ensure the continued safety of dod personnel at home and abroad , " maj . audricia williams , a defense department official , told the associated press .
