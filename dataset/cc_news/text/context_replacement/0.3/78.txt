- via snl . harry styles was the musical guest on saturday night live this week and , after debuting his new solo album , excelled on the very crowded ( both acoustically and logistically ) snl stage . he also looked very serious while doing it — which may have been a surprise to my coworkers , but could never be a surprise to me . oh , harry . my sweet elven boy . many doubted that your solo material would be good , but they didn ’ t because i love and support you , and i always have , even if you were my own little son or , better yet , a boy . you won my heart when work forced me to sit through several years of morgan spurlock ’ the art direction for this is us and my heart has never doubted that investment , never will . advertisement “ : since new york , ” one of the songs you played , shocked those who do not know you like i do . it was a little ryan adams , a little ‘ of punk rock at the time , and 100 percent hottie with a guitar ( he ’ s 23 , it ’ was amazing ! ) , even with your wonky little voice and the way it sounds like you ’ re barely listening . reason being , i am not / illegallyread this book and very much enjoy it . in fact , all i ask is that you take me out to dinner and kiss me on the mouth . you also were looking very handsome in a patterned suit ( “ you should wear a patterned suit , ” i texted my mom while watching you perform ) to sing “ sign of the times , ” a song i enjoyed very much . it felt a lot like an aerosmith ballad , which may sound like an insult , but i assure you that i meant it as a compliment . point is you should really sing and wear a suit , showing special skills that most people don ’ t have . you were even adorable playing mick jagger , a role that was likely originally written so that jimmy fallon could carry out a very untimely john travolta impression : babe , i think you did a great job across the board and now , well , everyone else agrees .
