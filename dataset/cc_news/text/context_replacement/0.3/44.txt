what i haven ' t heard from either side , and which i find dismaying , is the acknowledgement and appreciation of the hard work of the many women who work in the office of the president at und . the event coordinator is one of these women . president mark kennedy chose not to name her in his letter , and i will respect her decision and do the same . but she deserves to be recognized and praised for her dedication to und . there are many on campus who have given so much to this woman with little to no official recognition . if you have ever attended an official und event that involves the administration and visiting dignitaries , you have met her . events on campus go smoothly not by luck , but by the hard work she puts in before , during and after each event . the staff and faculty understand her work very well . a brief summary about these " events " : they are not simply formal , formal events or formal dinners . they include visits by acclaimed authors , artists , musicians , and politicians ; meetings of the college board ; athletic events ; alumni meetings ; legislative forums ; lectures ; media interviews ; and the list goes on . to reduce the enormous multi - tasking that the event coordinator can do to just one of the more trivial duties in the job description , a di##sservice to her hard work and presence at und . und ' s official motto is lux et lex â€” truth and law . the event itself is the symbol of change , allowing students , staff and faculty to be more and be more , paving the way for others . she deserves our praise , respect and profound appreciation . michelle bowles - writer the writer is the institutional review board coordinator for the division of business and economic education at und . the views she expresses are her own and are not meant to be a part of the values of the division or university .
