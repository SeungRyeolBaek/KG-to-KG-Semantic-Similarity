sydney ( ap ) — head coach bert van marwijk is confident australia will progress from the 2018 world cup group stage and that he will have the team play his best to get there . a few days after arriving in sydney on thursday , the dutch coach said at a press conference that there was nothing wrong with the attitude of his predecessor , ange postecoglou , who said he is a " real coach " who will do what it takes to win . postecoglou was criticised at times for playing with a three - man defensive line , and for australia ' s lack of composure in front of goal in asian qualifying when missed penalties forced them into the intercontinental playoff route to russia . he quit as coach in november a week after leading australia to a two - legged intercontinental playoff victory over spain . " i have respect for the former coach , ( but ) i have it in my heart , " van marwijk said . " i came to the world cup with the one thing that matters , ( and that ' s ) to win the first round . australia will play in group a at the world cup with brazil , italy and spain . " i ' m a realistic coach , " van marwijk said . " i like australian football , i liketo have the experience , but to also get to be — that is the most important thing . " van marwijk said his biggest challenge was the short time frame he had to familiarize himself with the new players before the world cup started in june . the 65 - year - old would have had the training window in june , when australia play norway and colombia in norway , and perhaps a farewell match in australia . " i have to get to know the players very well in a very short time , " he said . " that makes the challenge for me even greater . " van marwijk , who led saudi arabia to direct players from australia ' s group to the opposition coach , saw physicality as the socceroos ' main weakness . " they are strong , physically strong , " he said . " the challenge is to let them play in a way that gives them a chance to win games . "
