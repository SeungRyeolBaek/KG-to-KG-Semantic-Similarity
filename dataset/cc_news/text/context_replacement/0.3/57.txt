anyone who wants to see the total solar eclipse on december 21 will be lucky â€” and humanity is lucky to live on a planet that never has this kind of celestial event . mercury and venus , after all , don ' t even have moons . mars has a couple , but they ' re too small to completely blot out the sun . gas giants like jupiter do have tiny moons , but they don ' t have solid surfaces where you could stand and see an eclipse . and , even with solid surfaces and a moon , earth only has these gorgeous total solar eclipses because of some strange coincidence . " they seem to be the same , because of their distance away from us , " explains david smith , an astronomer at clemson university , which is in the vicinity of the upcoming eclipse . the diameter of earth ' s moon is about 400 times smaller than the diameter of the sun , but " even though the moon is about 400 times smaller than the sun , it ' s about 400 times closer to us than the sun , which is how that special kind of magic happens . " because of this distance , the full moon can see the entire face of the sun and even its entire corona , at least for now . in the past , earth ' s eclipse did not happen like this ." the size of the moon hasn ' t really changed over the age of earth , but the moon has been moving away from earth for eons . so in the past it was closer , " says matija cuk , a planetary scientist at the seti institute . the moon is still moving away from earth , he says . every year , it shifts closer by an hour - and - half . " well , for thousands of years you can have a total eclipse , but this is evenly matched eclipse , where it is barely visible , that is for a relatively short period of time , " says cuk . in only about 600 million years , the moon will look small enough that it no longer completely surrounds the earth , and whoever is left on earth won ' t see any more total solar eclipses . so , get them while you can .
