the roughriders were down at 32 - 29 with 1 : 04 remaining after ryan knutson scored from close range for saskatchewan . but red river broke the game open when the riders followed with a huge 21 - 2 lead . " it was just a little rough , ' ' red river coach jordan polynice said of the riders ' early scoring run . " we had open shots . they just weren ' t coming . " but we went to the baseline and started shooting . that ' s when we ' re at our best , in a fast - paced game . ' ' polynice had 10 of his game - high 22 points on the drive , in which the riders poured in the 21 points in a 4 : 35 period to build a 53 - 31 advantage . pierson also had a 3 - point basket on the big spurt ; however , it was red river scoring by getting the basket . and they picked up eight points off that . " we haven ' t seen the first ##s like that , ' ' said red river coach kirby krefting , whose team led 24 - 21 at halftime . " can you come up any flatter than we did ? we were going for jump shots and giving them too many dirty looks . " our team got it going .we got some good shots and started attacking the defense . ' ' in the second half , cody robertson and tyler enerson each had two steals and polynice blocked a lot of shots to help the defense . robertson added 11 points for the 24 - 7 knights , while painter was a spark off the bench with eight points . central got a short - lived scare when jacob ohnstad hit a big trey at the basket to end the first half , bringing the knights within 24 - 22 . but the knights couldn ' t match the performance red river had in the first half . " red river has a great defensive team , ' ' central coach dan carlson said . " we expected them to make a run at that point . and we couldn ' t score at that time to slow them down . that ' s what hurt . we ' ve had a hard time scoring this season . ' ' knutson had 12 points and ohnstad 10 to lead the 0 - 19 knights . ohnstad finished with nine rebounds , one shy of a double double .
