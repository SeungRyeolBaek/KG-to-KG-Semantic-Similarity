amber gajeski , the center ' s activities director , said the goal of the event was to help seniors meet new people . she said she often heard members say that they do not have companions with whom to do things . " that ' s kind of one of the main reasons why , ( thought ) , we have to try this event , " she said . " even if they can ' t find us , which we ' re not really sure . " five men and two women attended . they sat in pairs and talked for eight minutes at a time , then mingled as a group again . the attendees said they went into the evening expecting a fun evening without pressure . " i ' m of an age now where it ' s about fun , meeting new people , " said bobbie , a member of the center who declined to give her last name . " it ' s not like i think i ' m going to get a boyfriend or anything . it ' s just about having fun now . " they noted on a piece of paper if they were interested in getting to know anyone they knew further . gajeski had placed two cards on each card in case any of the pairs needed help with the rules , but the cards seemed to go easily and everyone talked easily .until the time came to switch pairs . jim laturnus said he felt he had a lot in common with some of the women he met . " i had nothing to say , really , " he said of his choice to come to the event . " i was just looking for fun . i did meet some of these other women here before . they ' re all fun . every single one of them has something in common . " " we really had a good time , learned a little bit about each other , " roxie smith said . " i ' m really glad you came . " she added she approaches everything with the same positive attitude . " a sense of humor is the best thing to have to have going through life , " she said . gajeski said in the future , the senior center may have a similar event for seniors , where they can meet new friends . " there ' s a lot of people that have moved here . it would be nice for them to be close to other people . "
