new york ( ap ) â€” columbia university said tuesday it would not negotiate with the graduate student assistants and research assistants who voted just over a year ago to join . columbia provost john coatsworth said the university would instead ask a federal district court to rule on whether student assistants are workers with the right to collective bargaining . " we remain convinced that the rights of graduate students to the faculty that employ them should not be limited to their terms of employment , " coatsworth said in a statement to the columbia press . " this is a conviction that , in the end , makes this very difficult decision straightforward for us . " columbia university students voted 1 , 602 to 623 in january 2016 to join a strike agreement with the united auto workers . the vote came after the national labor relations board ruled that graduate students at private universities had a right to strike . uaw executive director julie kushner said columbia ' s refusal to negotiate " shows total and continued disregard for the free will of these workers . " " these workers have made their position clear over and over and will continue to do so , and the uaw will stand with these workers until they achieve the justice they deserve , " kushner said . graduate students who voted for unionization said theythe collective bargaining would give them more control over their employment and would lead to higher stipends and better benefits . olga brudastova , a research assistant in columbia ' s civil engineering and construction management department , who was a leader of the petition drive , called the decision not to bargain " a new era for columbia . " she said , " more than a year after we voted by an overwhelming 51 percent for our proposal , columbia manufactures its same old excuses and refuses to gloss over the fact they are failing to respect the law of the land that has already certified our proposal .
