cape canaveral , fla . ( ap ) — the moon is visible during a rare fireworks show wednesday . it ' s the first time in 50 years a full moon has synced up with a supermoon and a total lunar eclipse . hawaii and alaska have the best seats , along with the canadian yukon , europe and asia . the western u . s . should have good seats , too , along with canada . the u . s . east coast , europe and most of north america and asia are out of reach for the eclipse . the first full moon in a calendar month is a blue moon . this one also happens to be an especially large and bright moon , a supermoon . imagine a lunar eclipse , known as a red moon for its red light , and it ' s a real eclipse . nasa is calling it a lunar trifecta : the first super - lunar eclipse since 1982 . that combination won ' t happen again until 2037 . the space agency plans to provide a continuous view of the moon from ground zero , during the eclipse . a lunar eclipse occurs when the sun , earth and moon line up perfectly , casting earth ' s light onto the moon . scientists are keen to observe the sudden , dramatic rise in temperature at the lunar surface, as earth ' s shadow blankets the moon . during the more than one day of totality , the temperature will plunge 100 degrees fahrenheit ( degrees celsius ) , says lunar scientist noah petro of goddard space flight center in columbia , maryland . he ' s deputy chief scientist for nasa ' s lunar reconnaissance orbiter , orbiting the moon since 2009 . his team is taking extra precautions to keep the spacecraft warm during the eclipse . perhaps just as important , petro and others are hoping the upcoming event has more people turning out — not every night , but every day . for the largest crowd , the moon will be 223 , 820 miles ( 360 , 200 kilometers ) away at the time of the eclipse , close enough for supermoon competition . _ _ _ source : source : https : / / www . gsfc . nasa . gov / index . php .
