salt lake city ( ap ) â€” a judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a utah religious leader who said he was wrongly placed on a terrorist watch list and temporarily blocked from leaving kenya with his family last summer . the lengthy screening process endured by yussuf abdi on flights since the trip was inconvenient but not unreasonable , u . s . district judge dee benson wrote in the decision monday . while the right to travel is protected by the law , " the supreme court has not recognized the right to convenient or safe travel , " benson said . lawyers for abdi , an imam and u . s . citizen , said the screening is more than an excuse . they haven ' t decided if they ' ll appeal the decision . " as yussuf abdi ' s lawyer makes clear , being on a terrorist watch list can separate citizens from their country , " judge gadeir abbas said monday . the lawsuit helped bring abdi back from kenya last year , and the travel has been difficult for him since the case was filed , abbas said . the case was filed after abdi returned to kenya to bring home his wife and five children , who had received visa applications to join him in the u . s . abdi was initially banned fromboarding the plane back to the u . s . but was only allowed to leave two days later , when his lawyers went to court and the u . s . attorney ' s office for utah intervened on his behalf . since then , he ' s taken odd jobs , made a religious pilgrimage to saudi arabia , and was subjected to long security checks that indicate he ' s on a government list of people identified for extra ##dition , according to court documents . the lawsuit alleged abdi was added to a government list in 2014 that let him fly but required extra security checks . he refused to be charged , saying he had no criminal record and no reason to be on the list . abdi has lived in utah for six years and is the imam of salt lake city ' s madina ##h islamic center .
