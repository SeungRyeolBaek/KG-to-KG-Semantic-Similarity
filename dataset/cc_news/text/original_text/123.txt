Testing indicates that Ford and Bosch are complicit in the marketing and sale of trucks that are spewing excessive levels of harmful pollution into the atmosphere, Keller Rohrback alleges. Over 500,000 of Ford’s best-selling F-Series trucks may be affected. Owners and lessees of these vehicles have been misled by Ford’s failure to disclose that these trucks could only achieve advertised fuel efficiency and performance by cheating emissions tests, according to the lawsuit.
The suit claims Ford failed to tell regulators and consumers that the Power Stroke engines’ emissions system does not operate in accordance with emissions standards at all times and was programmed to allow the engine to pollute at much higher levels in certain normal driving conditions.
Lynn Sarko, the managing partner of Keller Rohrback L.L.P., a leading consumer protection firm, has been appointed by federal courts to leadership roles in multidistrict litigation against Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler over emissions cheating in diesel cars and trucks. Since then, hundreds of concerned consumers from around the country have contacted Keller Rohrback to find out what they can do to help ensure that Ford and Bosch are held responsible for their conduct by compensating consumers and fixing polluting trucks.
