This week’s episode of Facebook’s “Ball in the Family,” entitled “Meeting Halfway,” exposed more drama between LaVar Ball and his second son, LiAngelo. During a trip to a cryotherapy center in Lithuania with LaMelo Ball and the Prienu Vytautas squad, LaVar gets his first-ever look at Gelo’s tattoo-covered chest when the 19-year-old has to strip down.
Turns out, LaVar is no fan of body art, and lets LiAngelo know as much.
“The fool went crazy a drew all over his body,” the Big Baller gripes during a confessional. “You know I don’t like tattoos, so I guess when we get back home, you got somewhere else to stay because I ain’t letting you stay in my house with that all over your chest. Because I told you if you living in my presence, you better live my way.”
When I tell you Lavar got me over crying the way he reacted to Gelo getting tatted behind his back 😭😭😂😂😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/S98TvE8Gjo — B💜 (@barbaradajour) March 19, 2018
Melo tries to convince the producers that he had no prior knowledge of Gelo’s tattoos, but struggles to hold back a sneaky smile before insisting “I ain’t no snitch.”
As the name of the episode suggests, LaVar ends up meeting LiAngelo halfway. Toward the end, we see the Ballfather pull Gelo aside during a practice at Prienai Arena to inspect his son’s tats.
“I gotta find some [expletive] I like under that damn shirt,” LaVar quips.
After seeing LiAngelo’s tributes to his deceased friend, his home state, the Big Baller Brand and his parents, LaVar loosens up just a little bit.
“I’ve never been a tattoo man,” the Father of Balls says, with some reluctance. “Time’s change and that’s what these guys do. The stuff he put on his body, he put it there for a reason: to remind him of certain things, I guess.
“I was like, ‘You know what? I’m over it.’ I said, ‘It’s cool for you if that’s the way you got to deal with things.'”
So while LaVar may not be pleased with Gelo’s choices here, he at least can appreciate the thought behind them—unlike the seeming lack of foresight behind the teenager’s shoplifting arrest in China.
