ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) â€” Marreese Speights scored 21 points in his second start of the season, Evan Fournier added 19 and the Orlando Magic ran away from the Los Angeles Lakers in the third quarter Wednesday night for a 127-105 victory.
Winning for only the fourth time in 24 games, the Magic made a franchise-record nine 3s in a 43-point third period, their highest-scoring quarter of the season. They shot 18 for 32 (56 percent) from behind the arc in the game.
With 15 points and six assists, Elfrid Payton was one of seven players to score in double figures for the Magic (15-35).
Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson scored 20 each for the Lakers, who never led after the first quarter.
When Payton's three-point play gave the Magic a 66-53 lead 93 seconds into the third, Lakers coach Luke Walton yanked all five of his starters out of the game. But the Lakers (19-31) never again got the margin under 11.
Mario Hezonja hit a 3-pointer, Fournier quickly followed with two more and Jonathon Simmons added two more 3s to help the Magic finish the period on a 22-13 run for a 20-point lead.
They led by 29 early in the fourth.
The Lakers, who had won eight of 11, were down by 12 when three straight baskets by Clarkson got them back in the game midway through the second.
Speights scored Orlando's final 10 points of the half, including a couple of 3-pointers, to leave the Magic with a 58-51 halftime lead.
