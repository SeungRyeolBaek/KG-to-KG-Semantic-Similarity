PARIS (AP) — A quick look at the French Open:
LOOKAHEAD TO THURSDAY
Top-ranked Rafael Nadal is back on court as he resumes his bid for a record-extending 11th title at the French Open against Guido Pella in the second round. After a straight-sets win in her first Grand Slam match following maternity leave, Serena Williams faces a tougher test on center court against 17th-seeded Ash Barty of Australia in another second-round match. Serena won their previous encounter, but that was in a completely different context four years ago at the Australian Open. Two-time winner Maria Sharapova is also in action against Donna Vekic of Croatia. The Russian has never lost a second-round match in Paris.
