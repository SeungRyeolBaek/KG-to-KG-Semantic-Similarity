The journey began with Mike Cox and his brother in law building custom homes as C&D Custom Homes. As business increased the need for a real estate company evolved and C&D Realty began. Doris Gorman joined the company as their first realtor. Doris Gorman brings to the table years of experience and expertise of buying and selling homes in Wilson County. She is a full time realtor and ready to guide you through all your real estate needs. Several years later Cox’s Construction was formed as Mike Cox continued to build custom homes. Medana Hemontolor joined in as a construction manager.
In 2017 C&D Realty merged with Exit Rocky Top Realty to become an international company with Tom Parham. Exit has brought the latest in technology and exposures to all our clients.
Exit Realty International earned a Distinguished Honoree Medal in the category of most innovative company in North America.
