= fieldfare = the ara ( ara pilaris ) is a member of the lark family noctuidae . it breeds in woodland and scrub in northern europe and asia . it is mainly migratory , with many breeding birds moving south during the winter . it is a very rare species in the british isles , but winters in large numbers in the united kingdom , southern europe , north africa and the middle east . it is omnivorous , eating a wide range of molluscs , insects and earthworms in the summer , and fruit , grain and seeds in the winter . fieldfares often nest in small trees , probably for protection from predators . the nest is built in a tree where five to six eggs are laid . the chicks are fed by both parents and leave the nest after a fortnight . there may be two broods in southern parts of the range but only one further north . migrating migratory and resident birds often form large flocks , often in the company of redwings . the fieldfare is 25 cm ( 10 in ) long , with a grey crown , neck and rump , a plain brown back , black wings and tail and white belly . the breast and flanks are heavily spotted . the breast has a reddish wash and the rest of the legs are black . the sexes are similar in appearance but the females are generally darker coloured . the male has a loud whistled song and the females have distinctive shrill flight and alarm calls . = = description = = the english common name fieldfare dates back to at least the 18th century . the anglo @ - @ saxon word feldefare ##r means lark of the field . the species was described by linnaeus in his systema naturae ( 1758 ) under its current scientific name . the name ara pilaris comes from two separate latin words for thrush . no subspecies are recognised . = = description = = the species is easily recognisable with its slate @ - @ grey head , nape and rump , plain brown back , black tail and boldly speckled wings . in flight , its grey under wing @ - @ feathers and axillaries are conspicuous . the distinctive alarm call " tsak tsak " is also distinctive . the forehead and crown of the male are slate @ -

@ covert have dark chestnut @ - @ black bases and margins and white streaks and tips . the bill is strong , with a slight curve and a notch near the tip . it is whitish @ - @ yellow in winter , with the upper beak tip brownish and both mandible tips whitish @ - @ black . in the summer the tips of the male ' s feathers are yellow . the irises are dark brown and the legs and feet are brown . the average wing length is 23 cm ( 9 @ . @ 8 in ) , the winglength length 13 @ . @ 14 cm ( 5 @ . @ 7 in ) and the tail length 3 @ . @ 5 cm ( 1 @ . @ 2 in ) . the female is very similar to the male but the upper ##parts are somewhat more grey and the feathers of the tail have slightly darker central stripes . the throat and breast are buff with fewer , darker markings . the beak is similar to the male ' s winter beak . the legs are slightly palercolour than the male with lighter coloured spots on the feathers that have dark edges in the adult . the young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn . the song is usually uttered in flight and is a harsh " tsak tsak tsuk " . the same sound , but softer , is given more conversationally when individuals gather in trees . when angry or alarmed they make harsh warning calls reminiscent of the mistle ##bird ( turdus viscivorous ) . the male has a very distinctive song that he sings during the breeding season . it is a series of a few phrases like those of the common blackbird ( turdus merula ) interspersed with harsh , guttural notes and call notes . this is sung on the ground and sometimes from a perch and a shorter version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal gatherings . = = distribution and range = = the species is a widespread species with a palearctic distribution . it breeds in southern norway , northern sweden , finland , belgium , germany , switzerland , austria , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , poland and siberia as far east as transbaikal , the aldan mountains and the tian shan mountains in north west china . its breeding range extends from west and south europe to north africa , but it is uncommon in the mediterranean region . some birds migrate to anatolia , israel , south and northern india , and to eastern india . it is a vagrant to iceland , norway , iceland , the shetland islands , the balearic islands , madeira , corsica , sardinia , sicily , malta and cyprus . in the summer the fieldfare prefers mixed forests of oak , alder , beech , spruce and fir , often near fields , pastures and other open areas . it does not leave the vicinity of humans and can be seen in cultivated areas , orchards , parks and gardens . it also prefers open woodland and the slopes of hills above the tree line . in the winter , groups of fieldfares are often found in open country , pasture land , scrub and open woodland . they are nomadic , feeding wherever there is an abundance of berries and fruit . later in the year they move on to cultivation and open woodland . = = range = = the flight of the bird is slow and steady . it gives several strong beats and closes its wings briefly before moving on . it is highly gregarious , very alert and easily scared in the winter and bold and noisy whenthe breeding season . when a nest is in a tree they all tend to fly in the same direction , keeping up a constant chatter . when foraging on the ground , often in association with redwings , the group makes its way down wind , each bird pausing every so often to stand still and gaze around before further feeding . when alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms itself . in woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes , instead they perch in the open on rocks and high branches . they roost socially , sometimes in low hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground . common nests are in rough grass among bushes or beds of rushes , in hollow trees , on stubble and in the furrows of old fields . migration away from the breeding range starts in october and the bulk of birds arrive in the united kingdom in november . some of these are still on migration and move on into mainland europe while others return . the cup @ - @ birds return in april and they and the resident migrants disappear from the united kingdom altogether in early may . the species is omnivorous . the food in the diet includes snails and snails , insects , spiders and insects such as beetles and their larvae , moths and grasshoppers . when berries appear in the field these are taken in great quantity . hawthorn , ash , rowan , yew , holly , dog rose , cotoneaster , pyracantha and strawberry are also taken . early in the winter , apples are eaten , swedes attacked in the field and grain and seeds eaten . when these are exhausted , or in particularly cold weather , the birds may move to marshes or on the foreshore where they are to be found . = = breeding = = the breeding season starts in may in britain but migration ##s in scandinavia may not start until early september . the common fieldfare builds a cup @ - @ shaped nest with little attempt at concealment . the location is often in woodland but may be in a field , scrub , among bushes , in a pile of logs , in a hut or on the ground . they may nest in close proximity to others of the same species . the adults will defend the nest aggressively and nesting gregariously to offer protection from predators . the nest is made of dried grass and weeds with a few twigs and a little straw , with outer lining of leaves and an inner lining of fine grasses . there are usually twoto six eggs in a clutch , although usually three , four , seven or eight eggs are laid . the eggs range in size from 20 @ . @ 5 by 20 @ . @ 20 millimetres ( 1 @ . @ 13 in × 1 @ . @ 82 in ) to 32 @ . @ 5 by 20 @ . @ 4 millimetres ( 1 @ . @ 20 in × 1 @ . @ 92 in ) and are variable in colour . many are dark blue , with dark brown spots and resemble those of the common raven . others are pale blue , with or without the red @ - @ brown splotches . incubation begins before all the eggs are laid and lasts for twelve to fourteen days . the female does all or most of the brooding . the chicks are altricial and both parents bring food to them . they are usually ready to leave the nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods during the season , especially in the northern part of the breeding range . = = range and conservation = = the species has an extensive range , estimated at 10 million square kilometres ( 3 @ . @ 8 million square miles ) , and a large population , with an estimated seventy five to seventy two million individuals in europe . there are thought to be up to twenty thousand individuals in europe and the global population is estimated to be between seventy four and seventy five million individuals . the population trend appears to be stable and the population is not likely to meet the threshold for the population decline criterion of the iucn red list of threatened species ( i . e . , declining more than 50 % in ten years or three generations ) , and is therefore evaluated as being of " least concern " . in the united kingdom , at the extreme south of the species ' s breeding range , only a handful of pairs remain . it is therefore classified by the rspb as a red list species as of january 2013 .
