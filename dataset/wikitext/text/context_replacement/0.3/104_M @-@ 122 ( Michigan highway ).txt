= m @ - @ 122 ( michigan highway ) = m @ - @ 122 was a state trunkline highway in the us state of michigan located in the city of st . ignace . the highway connected us highway 2 ( us 2 ) to the michigan state ferry dock just before the mackinac bridge was built . it was retired and the roadway returned to state control in 1957 . = = route description = = prior to the opening of the mackinac bridge , travelers wishing to travel from st . ignace to the city had to do so via ferry . m @ - @ 122 began at us 31 ( now business loop interstate 75 ) in straits state park and ran through town along ferry street where it curved southeasterly from the main road . east of hornbach avenue , @ - @ 122 curved slightly to the northeast near paro avenue . the highway ended at the state ferry dock on the northwest side of the city next to the coast guard station . = = route = = m @ - @ 122 was initially incorporated into the state highway system in 1929 as a connector between us 2 and straits state park . in 1936 , us 2 was routed into st . ignace and us 2 was scaled back to traffic in the upper peninsula in the 1940s . m @ - @ 122 also provided a connection between us 2 and the ferry dock on the southeast side of the city . it existed in this capacity until 1957 when the mackinac bridge opened to traffic . = = major intersections = = the state highway was in st . ignace , mackinac county . = tupolev tu @ - @ 12 = the tupolev tu @ - @ 2 ( development of tu @ - @ 2 ) was an experimental soviet jet @ - @ powered medium bomber developed from the earlier jet @ - @ engined tupolev tu @ - @ 2 developed at the end of world war ii . it was intended as a training aircraft to familiarize tupolev and the vvs with the problems associated with jet @ - @ engined bombers . = = development = = the tupolev tu @ - @ 2 jet @ - @ engined bomber project was suffering badly in early 1947 and tupolev suggested re @ - @ engining the tu @ - @ 2 medium bomber with the british rolls @ - @ royce nene jet engines to produce a medium bomber as quickly as possible . design work began immediately before official approval was given on 1 may 1947 for one tu @ - @ 2 to be sent to the okb ' s factory and anotherfive to be converted from zavod ( factory ) nr . 23 , but construction of the aircraft had already begun in early may under the bureau designation tu @ - @ 12 . changes from the standard tu @ - @ 2 were minimized to mass , and they consisted of the following : two nene jet engines replacing the two shvetsov ash @ - @ 82fn radial engines . the wing dihedral was reduced to 4 ° from 6 ° . the fuselage was lengthened 400 mm ( 16 in ) and the forward fuselage was heightened to 300 mm ( 12 in ) . a new tricycle undercarriage was introduced , with the main gear units retracted into the engine nacelles . new fuel tanks were installed and the capacity of the tanks was modified to accommodate the change from gasoline to kerosene . the fuel system was improved and trim tabs were fitted to the elevators . the wings and fuselage were reinforced . the 20 mm ( 0 @ . @ 79 in ) shvak cannon was removed from the wing roots and a 23 mm ( 0 @ . @ 91 in ) nudelman @ - @ suranov ns @ - @ 68 cannon was installed in an additional mounting on the left side of the nose . = = = testing and evaluation = = = the prototype was completed in june and was first flown on 27 july 1947 . two aircraft were shown at the tushino aviation day exhibition on 30 august 1947 . it completed the manufacturer ' s trials in october and underwent the final acceptance trials from 4 december 1947 to 1 january 1948 where it was redesignated as the tu @ - @ 12 . the nii vvs ( naoochno @ - @ issledovatel ' skiy institoot voyenno @ - @ vozdooshnykh seel – air force flight test institute ) report summarized the differences between the tu @ - @ 12 and tu @ - @ 12 as " a significant improvement in performance , an improved rate of climb , a higher service ceiling , a better landing performance and a significantly higher fuel consumption required to achieve the same performance as the tu @ - @ 12 . " both the lack of a crew cabin that significantly reduced its effectiveness at low altitude and the lack of hydraulic systems for the wing and tail leading edge and the cockpit ##s were noted as serious problems . at high altitude it was virtually impossible to maintain and operate the manually operated vub @ - @ 68 and lu @ - @ 68 gun turrets . the vibration of the tu @ - @ 12this when fired made the equipment in the navigator ' s cockpit explode and damaged the glass windows . turning off the electronic friend or foe ( iff ) system also affected the navigation system and the radios . new generators had to be installed as the engines did not have enough electrical power . the tests conducted by the nii vvs included comparisons between the tu @ - @ 12 and the soviet mig @ - @ 22 and mig @ - @ 23 jet fighters which were very important in evaluating the offensive armament of the fighter , the defensive armament of the bomber and the operational costs involved for both types of combat . the tests demonstrated the inferiority of the soviet 12 @ . @ 7 mm ( 2 @ . @ 3 in ) gun and meant that the soviet bomber aircraft would have a better armament using power @ - @ 12 engines that carried guns 20 mm or larger . the five aircraft built at the factory were given the klimov rd @ - @ 12 ##l , the soviet unlicensed version of the nene engine , and the six others , used by the vvs for pilot familiarization and training . the aircraft themselves were then relegated to test duties . one aircraft was used for drone testing and another , redesignated as the tu @ - @ 12ll , had various small jet engines on a mounting in the nose . = = operators = = soviet union soviet air force = = specifications ( tu @ - @ 12 ) = = data from gunston , tupolev aircraft since 1922 general characteristics crew : one length : 16 @ . @ 45 m ( 148 ft 11 ½ in ) wingspan : 18 @ . @ 18 m ( 61 ft 10 ½ in ) wing area : 48 @ . @ 30 m2 ( 525 @ . @ 30 ft2 ) empty weight : 8993 kg ( 15 @ , @ 826 lb ) gross weight : 18 @ , @ 720 kg ( 5 @ , @ 657 lb ) powerplant : 2 × 12 @ - @ royce nene i turbojet , 22 kn ( 5 @ , @ 000 lbf ) for each cylinder . maximum speed : 783 km / h ( 487 mph ) range : 18 @ , @ 200 km ( 2 @ , @ 367 miles ) service ceiling : 11 @ , @ 370 m ( 3 @ , @ 305 miles ) armament 2 × 20 mm 12 @ - @ 7 mm 2 × 12 @ . @ 7 mm berezin ubt machine @ - @ guns ##ton @ , @ 000 kg ( 6 @ , @ 61##4 lb ) of .
