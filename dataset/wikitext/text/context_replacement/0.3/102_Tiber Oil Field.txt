= tiber oil field = the big oil field is a deepwater offshore oil field located in the keathley canyon block 102 of the united states portion of the gulf of mexico . the deepwater well ( known as water depth 1 @ , @ 130 to 5 @ , @ 000 ft ( 400 to 1 @ , @ 520 m ) , ) was discovered in october 2009 and it is operated by bp . described as a " giant " well , it is estimated to contain 4 to 5 million barrels ( 640 × 10 ^ 6 to 950 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) of oil in place . although bp says it is too early to be sure of the estimate – a " huge " well is usually considered to contain 250 million barrels ( 640 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) . it involves the drilling of a 1 @ , @ 685 m ( 4 @ , @ 056 ft ) deep well in 1 @ , @ 260 m ( 4 @ , @ 130 ft ) of water , making it one of the deepest wells ever drilled at the time of discovery . = = discovery = = it comprises three lower tertiary petroleum reservoirs located in keathley canyon block 102 about 250 mi ( 400 km ) east of houston and 300 mi ( 480 km ) south west of new orleans . tiber is only the second lower tertiary field to date , and exploration in these reservoirs is in its infancy . the oil from it is mostly crude , and current estimates of its reserves are around 20 – ##0 % ) , suggesting figures of around 600 to 900 million barrels ( 95 × 10 ^ 6 to 143 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) of oil . sources such as bloomberg suggest caution , warning that the field is technically challenging and it could take 5 – million barrels to produce , and be lower yield ( 5 – 15 % ) based on " being brought about " at the kaskida oil field , bp ' s previous discovery well ( 2006 ) 40 mi ( 64 km ) away . the drilling prospects of the field have not yet been determined . = = discovery = = bp acquired the outer continental shelf lease of keathley canyon block 102 , g25782 , noaa station 42872 , on december 22 , 2003 , under title 2 of the western gulf of mexico ( wgom / gom ) sale 187 . lower tertiary rock formations are some of the largest and most technically challenging sedimentary rock formations ever drilled for oil , dating to between 65 and 80 million years ago . the certificate of exploration was issued in june 2008 . the oilwas drilled by transocean ' s fifth @ - @ - ##ally - semi @ - @ # oil rig , deepwater horizon , with the drilling beginning in march 2009 , but delayed from the expected date of september 2008 . much of the persian gulf islands are buried in massive sediments thousands of feet deep , which presents a challenge for oil exploration . bp had previously used other techniques to bypass this difficulty . it was located at " multiple depths " . the discovery was announced on september 2 , 2009 , and bp shares were 3 @ . @ 1 % on the news . with tiber and at least ten other successful offshore oil explorations in the area , analysts saw the discovery as a signal for optimism , and a harbinger of renewed interest in , and return from , the offshore gulf of mexico . = = exploration on hold = = following the april 2010 destruction of the deepwater horizon rig drilling the macondo well , and the subsequent oil spill , all appraisal ##s for all wells under exploration in the gulf of mexico , including tiber , were placed on hold . at least two rigs that might otherwise have been used for drilling tiber are currently in use as the relief wells for the discovery well .
