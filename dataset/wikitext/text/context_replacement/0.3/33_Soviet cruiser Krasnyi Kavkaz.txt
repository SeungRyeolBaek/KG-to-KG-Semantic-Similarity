@ german troops from elsewhere in the crimea into odessa and brought in supplies from caucasian ports . she helped to transport the 388th rifle division from novorossiysk and tuapse to odessa between 11 and 13 december and the 354th rifle division between 21 and 23 december , bombarding german positions in the crimea . during the kerch @ - @ feodosiya operation krasnyi kavkaz put into the bay of feodosiya on 29 december 1941 and disembarked troops and provided gunfire support for soviet troops already ashore . she was hit seventeen times by german artillery and mortar fire in december . between 2 and 3 january she ferried supplies and reinforcements for the soviet forces on the kerch peninsula . on the return voyage she was severely damaged by two luftwaffe ju 87 stuka dive @ - @ bombers from i . / stg 1 . two near @ - @ bombs dropped to her stern damaged her steering , her left propeller shaft , blew out her propeller and opened two holes in her stern that also caused her draught to increase by 5 metres ( 16 ft ) . she made it to novorossiysk , escorted by the destroyer sposobnyi , where she was broken up only to return to poti where more permanent repairs could be made . these lasted until march 1942 and the opportunity was taken to strengthen her anti @ - @ aircraft defences . she was awarded the marshal title on 1 april in recognition of her services . between 21 and 23 april , krasnyi kavkaz , her half @ - @ , krasnyi krym , and three destroyers carried 12 @ , @ 600 men of the 8th , 9th and 10th guards rifle divisions from poti to tuapse to reinforce the defenses there . on the night of 4 february 1943 the ships made a series of amphibious landings to the north of novorossiysk , behind german lines . krasnyi krym , krasnyi kavkaz , and kshe provided fire support for the main landing , but the soviet troops there were wiped out by 6 october , although a secondary landing was attempted . the sinking of several ships attempting to support the soviet invasion of the taman peninsula on 5 october 1943 caused stalin to order the deployment of large naval forces without his written permission and this marked the end of krasnyi kavkaz ' s active participation in the war . = = = post @ -

@ prone , four @ - @ lane divided highway near the modern exit 5 . in 1965 , the old route 2 freeway was given the new number of route 4 , leaving route 2 on its current alignment . a public hearing was held by the governor of rhode island regarding the proposed freeway , which was to be four lanes and have a divided , grassy median . this proposal was later approved , and construction began two years later . construction of the 5 @ . @ -

@ mile ( 2 @ . @ 4 km ) long section of freeway would cost $ . – 21 million ( equivalent to $ # – ##5 million in 2016 ) to build . in 1983 , the rhode island department of transportation ( ridot ) began construction of the final segment of route 4 between exits 5 and 6 . the project , which ultimately went over budget at $ 50 million ( equivalent to $ 60 million in 2016 ) ) , was financed from a $ 10 million federal grant . in 1986 , during excavation for the new ribbon @ -

@ - accidents for officers on the line of duty . in 2000 , construction began on the quonset interchange , a relocated route 403 that separates the quonset state forest from route 4 . the project included the reconstruction and construction of exit 7 on route 4 , which was a southbound @ - @ only exit serving both route 403 and route 402 when constructed . the exit was rebuilt into a full interchange with new ramps to route 4 , route 403 and route 402 and was completed in december 2008 , one year ahead of schedule . the project included the construction of a new northbound exit 7 on route 403 only . = = = = = the rhode island department of transportation( ridot ) also laid out long @ - @ term plans for improvements to both the southern and northern ends of route 4 . during the 1980s and 1990s , ridot announced plans to replace the three traffic lights at the southern end of the highway . the department planned to replace the previously existing us 1 and route 4 interchange , converting it into a long @ -
