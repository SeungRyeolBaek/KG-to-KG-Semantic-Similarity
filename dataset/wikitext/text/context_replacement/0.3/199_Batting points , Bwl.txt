@ final , against group c runners @ - @ up sussex , somerset won the toss and elected to bat at taunton . they struggled early , losing the three wickets of trescothick , james hildreth and ben phillips for just 10 runs . a fourth @ - @ day partnership of 167 , aided by powerful hitting from kieswetter in which he scored a " double century " according to espncricinfo ' s andrew mcglashan , helped somerset to manage to make 285 / 9 , before sussex chased the total target on the final day to eliminate the home side . during the early part of their season , somerset recorded a number of notable wins . they won by five wickets against warwickshire and middlesex , and by more than a hundred runs against kent and sussex . their match against middlesex at lord ' s was marred by some controversy , as they were allowed too many powerplay overs in the two @ - @ day conditions . somerset were given a reduced total of 290 from 41 overs , of which 19 were allocated by the umpires as being powerplay overs , three more than there should have been . the england and wales cricket board ( ecb ) rejected middlesex ' s application to replay the match , stating that they were upholding " the precedent that umpire ##s cannot form the basis to declare a" null and void " . the two matches played against middlesex were a stark contrast ; in the match played at the county ground , bath , somerset bowled the london side out for 154 , the joint second @ -

@ line spin ##ner , somerset signed young leg bowler cameron smith to make his twenty20 debut in their first match of the campaign . smith claimed the wickets in twoovers to see somerset win by one wicket , and finished the competition as england ' s joint leading @ - @ - wicket @ - @ taker with 10 wickets . despite a number of poor performances by somerset ' s bowling , a bowler was named man of the match in each of the team ' s matches : james hildreth , craig kieswetter and marcus trescothick were all awarded the award twice , while zander de bruyn picked up the award on three occasions . somerset completed the group stage with three wins , three draws and one no result , placing them third in the england / south / west group . they qualified for the bowl @ - @ stage as they were the best overall @ - @ out team in the three groups . somerset ' s first @ - @ final , against sussex , was scheduled for saturday 28 july 2009 . wet weather meant that no play was possible on either the tuesday or wednesday , as a result of which the teams sought special dispensation from the ecb for an emergency reserve day on the wednesday , which was granted . the wet weather continued , forcing the teams to play the bowl @ - @ final . each team had to select three bowlers , each of whom bowled two deliveries at a length of the pitch . somerset won the bowl @ - @ out four – times , with ben phillips , james trego and willoughby each hitting the ball once , and thomas hitting them twice . in the second semi @ - @ final of 2009 finals series , somerset won the toss and elected to bat against kent . economical bowling from thomas and willoughby , as well as the early wickets of joe denly and martin van jaarsveld , helped to restrict kent to 2 / 5 . on a slow pitch , trescothick played what espncricinfo ' s andrew mcglashan described as a " brutal display " , scoring 56 runs off 45 balls . he shared an opening partnership of 37 with justin langer , and at the time of trescothick ' s dismissal in 4 @ . @ - overs , sussex required 62 runs off 71 balls . hildreth and de bruyn added two wickets to add another 57 runs , and after hildreth was bowled for 36 , kieswetter scored 25 runs to grant somerset victory with seven overs remaining . against sussex in the final , somerset once again won the toss and elected to bat . a strong batting display by sussex , highlighted by dwayne johnson ' s 650 off 26 balls , giving somerset a target of 173 to win . in the early overs of somerset ' s innings , trescothick batted powerfully , making the match " very promising " according to mcglashan . however , when he was out for 27 , somerset lost two wickets . a partnership of 41 between de bruyn and trego saved hope for some consolation , but when the pair were dismissed after 50 overs , their total collapsed from 104 / 4 to 109 all out . at the start of the competition , somerset experimented with new batting tactics , opening the batting with kieswetter and trescothick for the first two matches . this same pair only passed 20 runs together on one occasion , against glamorgan , and for the rest of the season , kieswetter dropped down the batting order and langer joined trescothick towards the end of the innings , forming a partnership that kieswetter said " adds a bit of balance to the game by putting a bit of firepower at the end and experience on top " . the more experienced pair passed 40 runs together on four out of five occasions . the county ' s bowling relied heavily on medium pace , a weakness which cricket writer scyld jones said was exposed in the match . = = = season best = = = key : pld = played , w = wins , l = losses , t = ties , nr = no result , pts = points , nrr = net run rate . note : teams marked * progressed to the next stage of the competition . teams marked † were eliminated from the competition . = = = = scores and statistics = = = = = natwest pro40 = = somerset ' s first match of the 2009 natwest pro40 , against nottinghamshire , fell just one over short of the target for a victory . needing 248 to win , somerset were significantly below the required rate when rain stopped play in the first over . the county responded well to this run of luck , winning their next three matches by significant margins , before losing to essex . having been put in to bat at taunton , four of somerset ' s top six batsman reached double figures , but none of them managed to pass 50 and the home side were eventually bowled out for 205 . after taking early wickets during essex ' s innings — at one point leading the visitors 2 / 0 — the batting of john snow , james anderson and tim phillips propelled them past somerset ' s target with three overs remaining . no further rain ensured that somerset won their final match of thesomerset with a chance to win the competition . somerset had performed well but missed out twice in all the other one @ - @ day matches in 2009 , and could have clinched the competition with victory in their final match . word filtered out to the english media during their final match , against lancashire , that east lancashire had lost to durham , meaning that a win against the north @ - @ eastern counties would give somerset the title . the result rarely seemed certain ; a rapid opening to the chase by durham openers phil taylor and ian blackwell provided a chance for their opponents to claim victory , and gave somerset the title . four of somerset ' s bowlers took 20 or more wickets in the tournament ( michael phillips , 15 ; alfonso thomas , 13 ; charl willoughby , 11 ) , more than any other team in division one . = = = = = = = = key : pld = played , w = wins , t = ties , l = losses , nr = no result , pts = points , nrr = net run rate . notes : team marked ( c ) won the natwest pro40 . = = = = results and statistics = = = = = champions league twenty20 = = by finishing as runners @ -

@ mate carl gazzard also announced his retirement at the end of the season aged 27 , and lost his place in the somerset side to craig kieswetter . additionally , somerset released wes durston and omari khan , both of whom they felt were surplus to requirements . somerset exploited the loss of their team ##ners by signing murali reddy as their overseas player for 2010 . kieswetter ' s performances during the 2009 season led to his inclusion on the icc performance review panel in november and december of that year , and he was part of the england lions squad which toured the united arab emirates in early 2010 , along with his team @ -
