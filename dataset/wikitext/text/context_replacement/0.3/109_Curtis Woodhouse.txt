" the seat on the commission was given to those who effectively bought their freedom by pledging certain amounts of money . an international development consultant hired by the commission was quoted as saying , “ look , youhave to realize the ihrc [ sic ] was never intended to serve as a structure or model for haiti or haitians . it was instead designed as a vehicle for governments to funnel multinationals ’ and ngos ’ project contracts . ” the netherlands started another project , called radio555 . the dutch radio channels 3fm , radio 538 and radio 3 all operated under the name of radio555 , funded by a contribution of € ##100 million . leading members of the international construction industry and government , such as the department of homeland security and the international development council , among others , reported that they were compiling a " haiti toolkit " coordinated by the international institute of building sciences . the toolkit would comprise building technology resources and best practices for consideration by the haitian government with the goal of creating a more resilient infrastructure to prevent future losses of life . immediately after the earthquake , real medicine foundation began providing medical staffing , in @ - @ , medical supplies and community coordination to help meet the surging needs of the humanitarian crisis on the ground . working in close coordination with international relief organizations , real medicine coordinated deployments of mobile medical teams to meet the needs of field hospitals and clinics at the haiti – dominican republic borders and in the @ - @ au @ - @ areas , provided emergency funding , medical supplies and equipment to local health clinics and partner hospitals , provided advisory services and equipment to local health clinics , provided physical therapy equipment , and provided public health clinics , field hospitals and food distribution to outlying areas overlooked by the relief effort . on 22 january 2011 , the american relief administration announced a us $ 200 million , in @ - @ annual relief and reconstruction program that covers housing , food , livelihoods , and medical care among its affected areas . = = = aftermath of the earthquake = = = six months after the earthquake as much as 90 percent of the rubble remained uncleared . an estimated 26 million cubic feet ( 20 million cubic meters ) remained , making most of the capital impassable , and thousands of homeless lay in the streets . the number of people in the camps of tents and tents since the earthquake was 1 @ . @ 1 million , and almost no transitional housing had been built . most of the camps had no electricity , running water , or sewage disposal , and the tents were beginning to fall apart . violence in the country was widespread , especially against women and girls . in 23 major cities , us $ 1 @ . @ 1 billion had been raised for aid for relief efforts , but only 10 percent of the population had been released . accordingto the cbs report , us $ 1 @ . @ 1 million had been raised for humanitarian aid and was used to pay for field hospitals , plastic surgery , clothing , and food , plus salaries , food and housing of relief workers . by june 2010 , enough aid had been raised " to give each displaced person a home for us $ 37 @ , @ 000 . in july 2010 , cnn returned to port @ - @ au @ - @ prince and said , " it looks like the quake just happened yesterday " , and imogen wall , spokeswoman for the united nations office of humanitarian affairs in haiti , said that " six months from that , it may still look the same . " land ownership was a major problem for haiti because " many pre @ - @ quake properties were not officially registered . " even before the land registry sank into the rubble , land ownership was " a complex and complex issue in haiti . many areas of port @ - @ au @ - @ prince were settled either by tonton makout – duvalier ' s death squads – given land for their service or by donations . in many cases land ownership was not officially registered . even if this particular logjam were to be cleared , the vast majority of port @ - @ au @ - @ prince residents , up to 90 percent , did not leave their homes before the quake . " haitian grassroots groups advocated for the government to recognize the right to property ownership designated by the haitian constitution , and for donor governments to recognize this as well . they also tried to get the international community to recognize the influx of refugees from haiti that began as early as six months after the earthquake and to put protections in place , but little was done in response . in september 2010 there were over one million refugees still living in tents , and the humanitarian crisis was characterized as still being in the same state , according to the apostolic delegate to haiti , archbishop bernard auza . he went on to say that the number was increasing instead of diminishing , and said that the government had decided to completely rebuild downtown port @ - @ au @ - @ prince and the nearby city center , but reconstruction had not yet begun . in october 2010 , refugees abroad described the relief agencies as dysfunctional and inexperienced saying , " the people of haiti are still living in a state of crisis , with a crisis response that is ongoing " . it was reported that religious leaders and business owners were threatening the population and that sexual , ethnic , and gang violence in and around the city was increasing . they claimedthat rape of haitian women and girls who had been living in camps since the 2010 earthquake was occurring , in part , because the united nations wasn ' t doing enough to help them . in addition , a cholera epidemic broke out , possibly introduced by foreign aid agencies . cholera most often affects poor people with limited access to clean water and proper sanitation . by the end of 2010 , more than 100 @ , @ 333 people died at a rate of about two deaths a day . = = = = 2011 = = = = in january 2011 , one year after the earthquake , oxfam published a report on the state of the recovery . according to the report , reconstruction and recovery was at a disadvantage due to the inaction and negligence on the part of the donor countries . the report stated , " one year on , only five percent of the rubble has been cleared and only 15 percent of the required roads and temporary infrastructure have been built . house building on a large scale cannot be started until the enormous amount of rubble is cleared . the government and society must prioritize this one last step toward helping people return home " . robert fox , executive director of oxfam canada , said " the disaster has been caused primarily by the way the international community has organized itself , where commitments have been made and they haven ' t followed through [ and ] where they came to the rescue with their own agendas and specific priorities . most countries provided funds for transitional housing but received no money for clearing rubble or building roads " . fox said that in some instances rubble removal " meant rubble was [ falling ] from someone ' s property onto the ground in front of the building " . according to a unicef report , " today , more than one million people remain displaced , living in displacement camps where food , shelter and services are still hardly sufficient for them to stay alive " . amnesty international said that armed men were preying with impunity on girls and women in displacement camps , citing the trauma of having destroyed homes , businesses and needed ones . on the first anniversary of the earthquake , haitian @ - @ president michaelle jean , who served as the secretary general of canada at the time of the disaster and who became united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization ( unesco ) special envoy for haiti on 8 november 2010 , expressed her frustration with the slow pace of aid delivery , placing much of the blame on the international community for abandoning its efforts . in a joint statement co @ - @ met with unesco head irina bokova , jean said , " as apasses , what began as a humanitarian disaster is now a disgraceful reflection of the international situation . " the un haiti recovery commission , chaired by former us president bill clinton and haitian foreign minister jean @ - @ - bellerive , had been set up to monitor the flow of funds toward reconstruction efforts in late 2010 , but as of january 2011 , no major reconstruction had started . = = = = 2012 = = = = in january 2012 , two years since the quake , figures released by the united nations show that of the nearly us $ 1 @ . @ 5 billion allocated for reconstruction projects in 2010 and 2011 , only 8 percent has been delivered . venezuela and the us , which provide the major share of relief funds , have provided only 24 percent and 7 percent , respectively . sweden and finland are among the few countries to have not met their commitments . the data shows that some humanitarian sectors face very large funding gaps . in 2010 and 2011 , for example , donors provided only us $ 125 million of the us $ 311 million in grants allocated to reconstruction projects , and only us $ 108 million of the us $ 315 million in grants allocated to health care . only 10 percent of relief funding for reconstruction projects has gone through haitian ngos , and less than 1 percent of relief funding has gone through the government of haiti . a january 2012 oxfam report said that a half a million haitians were homeless , still living under tarps and in tents . watchdog ##s have criticized the reconstruction process saying that part of the problem is that charities spent a large amount of money on " soaring salaries , board members ' needs , overpriced supplies and imported personnel " . the miami herald reports . " a lot of good work was done ; the money clearly didn ' t all come through , " but , " a lot just wasn ' t responding to problems on the streets . millions were spent on ad campaigns telling people to wash their hands . telling them to wash their hands when there ' s no water or soap is a slap in the face . " the institute of peace & democracy in geneva , let haiti live , and the center for human rights have recommended immediate improvements to recovery efforts to ensure that critical human rights issues are addressed . their report says that , " the conditions in the displaced persons camps are abysmal , especially for women and girls who too often are victims of gender ‐ based violence " . they call for more oversight of accountability of reconstruction plans , asking , " why have the 94 @ , @ 000 emergency shelters been" to date despite a stated goal of 125 @ , @ 000 in the first year ? " . on 25 august 2012 , recovery was hampered due to tropical storm sandy on haiti ' s central peninsula . there it caused flooding and 29 deaths according to local reporting . as a result of the 2010 earthquake , more than 300 @ , @ 000 haitians had to live in tents and experienced the disaster without adequate shelter . in late october , with over 370 @ , @ 000 still living in tent camps , a second tropical storm , hurricane sandy , killed hundreds and left large portions of haiti without water . at the 2012 world council meeting of the global forum for disaster reduction and recovery ( gfdrr ) , the haitian delegation shared a " 4 @ - @ 000 " approach to disaster prevention and management focusing on regional integration and sustainable development with a panel of experts from over 38 countries . = = = = 2013 = = = = according to the international monetary fund , more than half of the 4 @ , @ 000 @ , @ 000 cubic metres ( 11 @ , @ 000 @ , @ 000 cu yd ) of debris has been removed , and 20 % of it has been repaired . the cholera outbreak which began in october 2010 has continued . according to u . s . centers for disease control and prevention it is considered the worst epidemic of cholera since the 1994 earthquake in the democratic republic of the congo ( and rwanda at that time ) . by august 2013 , it had killed over 300 @ , @ 231 people and hospitalized hundreds of thousands more . more than 40 % of haitians still had the disease . care of cholera patients was inadequate with much care done in makeshift facilities with plenty of tents for patient comfort . the united nations peace corps mission , widely believed responsible for the cholera outbreak , continues to refuse to accept donations , however , they have launched a $ 1 @ . @ 2 billion initiative to combat cholera and the construction of a $ 100 million emergency hospital in mirebalais which will house 800 people and treat 185 @ , @ 000 people . at the time of the earthquake , a large part - - $ 215 million — of the total funds allocated for reconstruction had been spent on permanent housing , with most of the - - $ 1 @ . @ 2 billion — reserved for non @ - @ term programs like tent camps , temporary shelters , and cash grants that pay a month ' s rent . a 2013 survey found that of the 1 @ . @ 2 million haitians living in haiti following the earthquake , about 279 @ , @ 000 remained ina total of 352 tents . fifteen percent of the camps had no fire protection services , and 48 % no sanitation services . while 20 % had functioning toilets , this was higher than the number of refugee camps , where 10 % lack toilets . the camps remained at a risk for flooding and more than a third of the camps ( 108 ) were at risk for flooding . in a 2013 statement , the american red cross said that nearly all of the money collected for the relief has been spent and is scheduled for making projects permanent by which people can leave camps and return to stable communities , which includes building new homes , repairing roads , building a new hospital and clinic , and signing an agreement for a new school . = = = = 2015 = = = = in 2015 , npr and propublica investigated the amount of us $ 5 million donated to the american red cross , described as " one of the most successful projects ever " . despite the claims of the american red cross that 130 @ , @ 000 homes had been rebuilt , the investigation discovered that only six had been built . the investigation examined " hundreds " of pages of internal documents and interviewed " more than a dozen " former and current staff members , and investigated the organization ' s claim that 4 @ . @ 5 million people had been put " back on their feet " despite joel boutroue , a haitian government official , claiming that this project would cover " 100 percent of the total cost " , and adding that this would mean they had rebuilt every home in haiti . several other organizations did not show up under budget , and it was reported that the project was riddled with " multiple staffing problems " , bureaucratic delays and a language barrier as many of the red cross staff did not speak french or english . general counsel for the american red cross , david meltzer , referred the investigation to their official statistics , but would not elaborate on them . the public affairs division of the red cross disputed npr and propublica ' s claims in an email , and warned that the investigative investigation could cause an international incident . the american red cross eventually turned over the rebuilding efforts to the haitian red cross . = = in literature = = the haiti 2010 earthquake has been depicted in the novel nobody loves haiti , by dimitry le pen .
