= cicely mary barker = cicely mary barker ( 28 june 1895 – 18 february 1973 ) was an english illustrator best known for a series of book illustrations depicting fairies and flowers . barker ' s art career began in 1919 with correspondence courses and studies at the croydon school of art . her earliest professional work was greeting cards and juvenile magazine illustrations , and her first book , flower fairies of the spring , was published in 1923 . similar books were published in the following decades . barker was a devout christian , and gave her time to christian fundraisers and missionary work . she published a few christian @ - @ religious books such as the children ’ ##ᵈ book of hymns and , in collaboration with her sister dorothy , god leadeth us . she designed a stained glass window for st . edmund ' s church , pitlake , and her painting of the christmas child , the darling of the spring to come , was commissioned by queen victoria . she was equally proficient in drawing , pen and ink , pencil , and pastels . kate greenaway and the pre @ - @ raphaelites were the principal influences on her work . she learned to draw instinctively and developed artistic skills . she died in 1973 . although she published several other books with spring , summer , and autumn themes , it wasn ' t until 1985 that a complete collection was assembled from her remaining work and published posthumously . = = = = = = = = early life = = = barker was born the second daughter and youngest child of walter barker , a clerk in the seed ##ling company and an amateur painter , and his wife mary eleanor ( oswald ) barker on 28 june 1895 at home at 66 waddon road in croydon , surrey , england . barker was an epileptic as a child , and cared for at home by her mother . later , her sister and elder by two years , dorothy mary barker , continued the condition . the family of barker was moderately well off , and belonged to the lower end of the upper middle class . a nanny , a governess , and a cook to prepare special meals for her were hired . she spent her time in bed at home amusing herself with art books and a nursery library that included the works of kate greenaway and randolph caldecott – two artists who exerted an influence on her later art . = = = early education and first professional work = = = barker attended correspondence courses in art , probably until about 1919 . in 1908 at 13 years , she entered the evening course at the croydon school of art , and attended the school into the 1940s . in time, she took a teaching position . in 1911 , raphael tuck & co bought some of barker ' s " little drawings " for half a sovereign , and published them as posters . in november 1911 , she won first prize in the croydon art society ' s poster competition , and shortly afterwards was elected the youngest member of the society . the art critic for the croydon chronicle remarked , " her works show a remarkable freedom of expression . she shows distinct promise . " after her mother ’ s death in june 1912 , the seventeen @ - @ year @ - @ years barker contributed art and poetry to my magazine , child ’ ##s magazine , the mirror , and raphael tuck , in an effort to support both her mother and sister . her sister dorothy taught kindergarten in various london schools before opening a kindergarten in croydon . she brought in some money for the family ' s expenses while running the school . = = = flower fairies of the spring , 1923 = = = fairies became a popular subject in art and literature in the early 20th century following the publication of the keys of the kingdom by sir arthur conan doyle , peter pan by j . m . barrie , and the four @ - @ year novels of australian ida rentoul outhwaite . queen victoria made such themes even more popular by sending outhwaite postcards to artists during the war . in 1918 , barker painted a postcard series of elves and fairies . in 1923 , barker sent her flower fairy paintings to various publishers . blackie paid £ 25 for the paintings with accompanying verses , but it wasn ' t until publication of flower fairies of the spring in 1925 that barker received recognition for her work . author violet clayton calthrop , wife of author dion clayton calthrop , wrote in april 1925 about barker and flower fairies of the spring : " she has such good taste , such draughtsmanship . " = = = the waldrons = = = in 1924 , the family moved into a four @ - @ bedroom , four @ - @ detached family house at 23 the waldrons . barker had a bench built in the garden and her sister ran the kindergarten from a room at the back of the house . the family lived frugally and attended both st . edmund ' s and st . andrew ' s in croydon – " low " churches for the less privileged . barker also incorporated portraits of her fellow children into her religious works . she was described by canon ingram hill as " one of the founders " of st . andrew ' s . the children in the kindergarten cared for the flower fairiesuntil the kindergarten closed in 1940 . in an interview in 1958 , she said , " my sister ran a kindergarten and i used to take her pictures for models . for many years i had an atmosphere of peace about me – i never forgot it . " she also painted the portraits of relatives as well as gladys barker , the barkers ' former secretary , who posed for the tooth fairy in 1923 . the figures were drawn from nature , and if a specimen was not readily at hand , kew gardens nursery would provide her the materials needed . she designed and painted the flower ##y illustrations , and based each on the flowers and leaves of the particular plant to be illustrated . the flowers were kept in a box in her studio , with costumes made of twigs and gauze . each was broken up after an illustration was completed and the parts used for other illustrations . she also contributed to dion clayton calthrop ' s fairy costume . = = = middle age = = = in the late 1920s , barker began to feel she was doing better for the children and began concentrating more on secular subjects . family and friends recommended she paint religious and sacred subjects , which she did . she continued to attend evening classes at the croydon art school in the 1930s and the 1940s , eventually obtaining a teaching position . she made sketching trips to amberley and storrington in sussex and to kent and the southern downs with family and friends . she met and stayed with mary margaret tarrant at gomshall , surrey and with her at ugglebarnby , near whitby , north yorkshire . in 1940 , the children ' s live @ - @ in was closed , and dorothy barker closed her school at the back of the house in the waldrons . she continued to run the nursery , and to give both her mother and sister the care they needed . dorothy and her sister collaborated upon only two books : our mother ' s first love and the live @ - @ in , he leadeth me . in 1954 dorothy barker died of a heart attack . she was unable to continue her art to any great extent following her sister ' s death , and all the responsibilities of her late mother fell upon her , although she did manage to begin planning a stained glass window design in her sister ' s memory for st . edmund ' s , pitlake . = = = = life and death = = = barker ' s mother died in 1960 , and , in 1961 , she moved from 23 the waldrons to 23 duppas road , croydon . she became a maisonette instorrington , sussex , england , bequeathed by her friend edith major , and naming it st . andrew ' s . after taking up painting , her health began to deteriorate . she was in and out of nursing and nursing homes , and tended to family and friends . barker died at worthing hospital on 8 december 1973 , aged 77 years . two funeral services were held – one in storrington church and one in barker ' s home . her ashes were scattered in storrington churchyard . in 1989 , frederick warne , a director of penguin books since 1983 , acquired the flower fairies collection . = = art = = barker worked principally in watercolor with pen @ - @ and @ - @ black , but she was also competent in pen @ - @ and @ - @ white , in oils , and in pastels . she carried a sketchbook with her for all her work . she once said , " i have always tried to draw children in a way that comes naturally to me , without any conscious thought or attention to artistic expression . " kate greenaway was a close friend and an influence on her work . barker ' s child children wear nostalgic clothing as greenaway ' s children do , though barker ' s children are less melancholy and more flat in appearance , due largely to advances in photographic technology . barker studied flowers with an analytical eye and was close to children ' s author , margaret tarrant . along with greenaway , artist alice e . smith also influenced barker ' s work . the pre @ - @ raphaelites had a strong , lifelong influence on barker . she later indicated , " i am to some extent influenced by them — not in the technical sense , but in the sense of subject matter and the feeling and atmosphere they could achieve . " she admitted a fondness for the oil paintings of john everett turner and " the little things " of charles burne @ - @ oil . = = = drawings of children = = = barker ' s prints , drawings , and paintings of children were sold to friends or to the families of the children , given to charitable institutions and to social events , or sold through various art galleries . she produced book covers , book illustrations , and a series of books for ernest tuck and other publishers such as the children of the world ( 1915 ) , happy holidays ( 1918 ) , and shakespeare ' s boy and girl friend ( 1917 , 1920 ) . her own books rhymes for old people ( 1928 ) and the legend of the rushie girl ( 1938 ) , a book about agirl who lived among swans on the thames , was critically well received . set in 1800 , rings and necklaces ( 1943 ) tells of a girl named jenny who saves her father from drowning through the agency of the devil . the story features an elderly scrooge @ - @ like character named mr . petercoo and tonally suggests a dickensian social commentary . elizabeth the witch , intended as a sequel to rushie river was published in 1943 with groundsel , but only published in 1953 . it was published posthumously in 1988 and is critically considered less successful than groundsel . = = = = @ - @ themed works = = = barker was a devout christian , and produced many @ - @ themed works throughout her life . she produced eight saints and five guardian angel greeting cards for the society for promoting christian knowledge in 1916 and in 1923 alone . the cards were produced for the girls ' aid society over a two @ - @ year period , and the first six were sold in a single printing of 1 @ , @ 500 in 1923 . an early design for the bible , the end of the world has come was purchased by queen victoria for ₤ 5 @ . @ 5 @ . @ 0 in 1926 . the croydon art gallery included barker ' s book cover design for the society for the propagation of the gospel in its june 1919 exhibition . religious @ - @ themed works include the children ' s book of hymns ( 1929 ) and he leadeth us ( 1933 ) , the latter written in collaboration with her sister . major religious works include the painting in oils , the feeding of the five children ( 1929 ) , for the chapel in llandaff house , a home for destitute women in penarth , wales , and the feast of the last supper ( 1934 ) for st . george ' s church , waddon . the latter has since disappeared , and only a single @ - @ and @ - @ + photograph from 1929 shows the work . in 1941 , she completed oil panels on the subject of the seven sacraments for the baptismal font at st . mary ' s , south croydon . she completed altar rolls for the interior of the font in 1948 and 1962 . in 1946 , she completed the 4 . 7 in . oil mural , christ of great ##ness , for the memorial chapel of norbury parish church . following the death of her sister in 1954 , barker began designs for a stained glass memorial window depicting jesus preparing to wash the feet of his disciples . her only known @ - @ themed work , itand buried at st . edmund ' s , pitlake , in 1962 . = = works = = = = = books = = = = children of the world ;
