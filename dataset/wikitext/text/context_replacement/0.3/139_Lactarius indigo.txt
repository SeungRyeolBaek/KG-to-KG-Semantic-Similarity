= lactarius indigo = indigo indigo , commonly known as the indigo milk mushroom , the indigo ( or indigo ) lactarius , or the indigo milk ##cap , is a species of coral fungus in the family russulaceae . a widely distributed species , it occurs naturally in eastern north america , western asia , and south america ; it has also been reported in southern france . l . indigo grows on the ground in both deciduous and coniferous forests , where it forms mycorrhizal associations with a broad range of trees . the fruit body color ranges from indigo blue in young specimens to indigo blue @ - @ gray in older specimens . the fluid , or juice , that forms when the mushroom cap is bruised or broken — a feature common to all members of the lactarius genus — is initially indigo blue , but slowly turns green upon exposure to air . the cap has a diameter of 5 to 15 cm ( 2 to 6 in ) , and the stem is 2 to 8 cm ( 0 @ . @ 8 to 3 in ) tall and up to 2 @ . @ 5 cm ( 0 @ . @ 4 to 5 @ . @ 2 in ) thick . it is an edible mushroom , and is sold in rural markets in china , guatemala , and mexico . = = taxonomy and distribution = = originally described in 1822 as agaricus indigo by american mycologist johann david von schweinitz , the species was later transferred to the genus indigo in 1838 by the swede elias magnus fries . german botanist otto kuntze called it lactifluus indigo in his 1891 work revisio generum plantarum , but the suggested name change was not accepted by others . hesler and colleagues in their 1960 study of north american species of lactarius defined l . indigo as the type species of subsection caerulei , a group characterized by blue latex and a sticky , white cap . in 1979 , they revised their position on the classification of species within the genus indigo , and instead placed l . indigo in section indigo based on the number of spores , and the subsequent color changes , after exposure to air . as they explained : the gradual development of blue to green pigmentation as one progresses from species to species is an interesting phenomenon deserving further study . the maximum is found in l . indigo which is always green . l . chelidonium and its subgenus chelidonioides , l . paradoxus , and l . hemicyaneus can beconsidered as being on the road to l . indigo . the specific epithet indigo is derived from the latin word meaning " indigo milk " . its names in the english language include the " indigo milk cap " , the " indigo cap " , the " blue milk mushroom " , and the " blue cap " . in central america , it is known as indigo , azul , hongo azul , zuin , and zuine ; it is also called quexque ( meaning " blue " ) in veracruz and puebla . = = description = = like many other mushrooms , l . indigo develops from a cap , or pinhead , that develops within the underground mycelium , a mass of threadlike fungal cells or hyphae that make up the majority of the organism . under favorable environmental conditions of temperature , humidity , and nutrient availability , the primary reproductive structures ( fruit bodies ) are formed . the cap of the fruit body , typically between 5 and 15 cm ( 2 @ . @ 8 and 4 @ . @ 9 in ) in diameter , is initially convex and then develops a central depression ; with age it becomes even more deeply convex , and somewhat funnel @ - @ shaped as the top of the cap slopes upward . the margin of the cap is curved inwards when young , and expands and narrows as it matures . the cap surface is indigo blue when young , and fades to a paler indigo - or violet @ - @ color , often with greenish edges . it is often zonate : white with concentric rings that form between pale and dark zones , and the surface may have dark blue spots , especially towards the center . young caps are rough to the touch . the flesh is pallid to white in color , slowly turning greenish upon being exposed to air ; the odor is mild to slightly bitter . the flesh of the young mushroom is brittle , and the cap , if bent sufficiently , will break open easily . the latex exuded from injured tissue is pale blue , and stains the wounded tissue greenish ; like the flesh , the flesh has a bitter taste . the indigo is notable for not producing as much latex as other edible species , and young specimens in particular may be too dried out to produce any latex . the gills of the mushroom range from adnate ( squarely attached to the stem ) to slightly decurrent ( running down the length of the stem ) , and crowded closely together . their color is an indigo blue , becomingpaler with age or staining brown with damage . the stem is 2 – 5 cm ( 0 @ . @ . – @ @ . @ 4 in ) tall by 1 – 2 @ . @ 5 cm ( 0 @ . @ 4 – 1 @ . @ 2 in ) thick , and the cap diameter itself is gradually narrowed with maturity . its color is pale blue to white - or grayish blue . the interior of the stem is hollow and firm initially , but becomes more hollow with age . like the cap , it is initially sticky or slimy to the touch when young , but later dries out . its attachment to the stem is usually through a central groove , although it may also be off @ - @ center . fruit bodies of l . indigo have several morphological characteristics . l . indigo var . diminutivus ( the " little indigo milk cap " ) is a smaller variant of the mushroom , with a cap diameter between 6 and 20 cm ( 0 @ . @ 6 and 1 @ . @ 8 in ) , and a stem 0 @ . @ . – ##1 @ . @ 0 cm ( 0 @ . @ . – 1 @ . @ 6 in ) long and 0 @ . @ . – # @ . @ 0 cm ( 0 @ . @ . – ##1 @ . @ 4 in ) thick . it is rarely seen in cultivation . hesler and colleagues , who originally described the species based on specimens collected in brazoria county , texas , described its typical habitat as " on [ the ] edge of a muddy ditch under trees and shrubs , [ with ] loblolly pine needles " . = = = microscopic characteristics = = = when viewed in situ , as in the spore print , the spores are cream to yellow colored . viewed with a light microscope , the spores are translucent ( translucent ) , spherical to almost spherical in shape , with no center , and have dimensions of 0 – 9 by 5 @ . @ . – @ @ . @ 5 µm . scanning electron microscopy reveals reticulations in the spores print . the cortex is the 0 @ - @ . tissue layer of the fruit body , and consists of hyphae that extend into the gills and terminate in end caps . several cell types can be observed in the cortex , and the cells have microscopic characteristics that can be used to help identify or distinguish them in situations where the macroscopic structures can be confused . the spore @ - @ bearing cells , the basidia , are 0 @ - @spored and are 37 – 45 µm long by 8 – 10 µm wide at the thickest point . cystidia are specialized cells of hyphae in the stem which do not produce spores , and function in controlling spores formation , and maintaining favorable humidity for the spores . the pleurocystidia are cystidia that are found on the surface of a gill ; they are typically – 4 by 6 @ . @ 4 – 8 µm , roughly spindle @ - @ shaped , and have a constricted apex . the cheilocystidia — found on the face of a gill — are abundant , and measure 40 @ . @ 0 – @ @ . @ 0 by 7 @ . @ 6 – 7 @ . @ 4 µm . = = = similar species = = = the dark blue color of the fruit body and the gills make this species easily recognizable . other common species with some blue color include the " blue @ - @ @ mushroom " ( l . paradoxus ) , found in eastern north america , which has a blue @ - @ colored cap when young , and it has reddish @ - @ brown to purple @ - @ brown flesh and gills . l . indigo has a white to dingy yellow @ - @ gray to yellow @ - @ brown cap and yellow to orange gills . l . quieticolor has blue @ - @ colored flesh in the cap and orange to red @ - @ colored flesh at the base of the cap . although the blue color of l . indigo is considered to be rare in the genus itself , in 2007 five new species were described from peninsular malaysia with bluing flesh and gills , including l . cyanescens , l . lazulinus , l . indigo , and two species still living . = = edibility = = although l . indigo is a rare @ - @ known edible mushroom , opinions vary on its desirability . for example , the botanist david arora calls it a " superior edible " , and a reference guide on edible fungi describes it as " mild in taste " . it can have a slightly bitter , slightly sweet taste , and has a rough , rough texture . the white flesh is best prepared by cutting the mushroom into thin strips . the blue color disappears with cooking , and the mushroom becomes grayish . because of the granular texture of the flesh , it does not lend itself well to cooking . specimens producingcopious amounts of milk may be used to add color to marinades . in mexico , farmers sell the harvested mushrooms for sale at farmers ' markets , typically from june to september ; they are considered a " second class " species for sale . l . indigo is commonly sold in guatemalan markets from may to october . it is one of several lactarius species sold at farmers markets in yunnan and southwestern china . = = = chemical composition = = = = chemical analysis of collected specimens has shown l . indigo to contain fiber at 951 mg / g of mushroom , fat at 12 @ . @ 3 mg / g , protein at 12 @ . @ 3 mg / g , and dietary fiber at 12 @ . @ 6 mg / g , much higher in comparison to the common button mushroom , which has 12 @ . @ 6 mg / g . compared to three other wild edible mushroom species formerly included in the genus ( acacia rubescens , boletus frostii , and ramaria flava ) , l . indigo contained the highest saturated fatty acids content , including stearic acid with 7 @ . @ 1 mg / g — slightly over half of the total saturated fatty acid content . the blue color of l . indigo is due to ( 7 @ - @ isopropenyl @ - @ - @ - @ methylazulen @ - @ 1 @ - @ yl ) methyl stearate , an organic derivative of azulene . it is unique to this species , and similar to the pigment found in l . deliciosus . = = species , habitat , and ecology = = l . indigo is found in central and eastern north america but is most common on the gulf coast , mexico , and guatemala . its frequency of occurrence in the appalachian mountains of the united states has been described as " occasional to very common " . botanist david arora notes that in the united states , the fungus is found with ponderosa pine in california , but is absent in california ' s ponderosa pine forests . it has also been reported from china , mexico , guatemala , and costa rica ( in forests dominated by pines ) . in europe , it has so far only been found in southern france . a study of the seasonal production of fruit bodies in the subtropical forests of xalapa , mexico , confirmed that maximal production coincided with the rainy season between june and september . l . indigo is a mycorrhizal fungus , and as such , establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of certain trees ( " roots " ) ,in which the fungi exchange minerals and amino acids obtained from the fungus for additional nutrients from the host . the aerial spores of the fungus form a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of a broad range of tree species , forming so @ - @ bark ectomycorrhizae — an intimate association that is highly beneficial to the host , as the fungus produces enzymes that digest organic matter and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the host . despite their close association with trees , the fruit bodies of l . indigo are commonly found growing on the ground , scattered or in groups , in both deciduous and evergreen forests . they are also commonly found in deciduous forests that have been recently cleared . in mexico , associations have been found with mexican alder , mexican oak , mexican hophornbeam , and acacia macrophylla , while in guatemala the mushroom associates with smooth @ - @ bark mexican pine and other pine and oak species . in costa rica , the fungus forms associations with several native oaks of the quercus genus . under controlled laboratory conditions , l . indigo has shown to be able to form ectomycorrhizal associations with the neotropical pine , mexican white pine , hartweg ' s pine , mexican black pine , smooth @ - @ bark mexican pine , and the eurasian pines white pine , american white pine , black pine , and red pine . = = = cited by = = = arora a .
