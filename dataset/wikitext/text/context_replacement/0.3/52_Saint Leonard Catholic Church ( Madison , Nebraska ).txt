in particular , there was an influx of german immigrants from germany . the town of madison was first platted by barnes in 1870 or 1871 . in 1875 , it became the county seat of madison county , and in 1876 it was incorporated . the union pacific railroad reached madison in 1879 ; by 1880 , the town had a population of about 300 . the first christian services held in madison were presbyterian , taking place in barnes ' s and other homes . a presbyterian circuit was organized in 1870 , and a church built in 1872 . a methodist circuit in madison and taylor counties was organized in 1871 ; a parsonage was built in madison c . 1875 , and a church built in 1877 . a lutheran congregation may have formed in madison in about 1875 , although early records are incomplete ; the congregation was probably served by the pastor of a lutheran church in white river precinct , located about 7 miles ( 11 km ) southwest of madison . it was formally organized in 1885 , and a church built in madison in 1887 . the first catholic families in madison county homesteaded near the @ - @ day battle creek , southwest of madison , in the late 1860s . in 1874 , they organized a parish ; in 1874 – 75 , they built st .joseph ' s church , the county ' s first catholic church . in 1877 , they wrote to bishop john o ' connor of the diocese of columbus , asking that a priest be assigned to serve the church in madison until a permanent priest could be assigned to the parish ; in apparent response to this , catholic priests living in columbus were given the task of providing for the parish . = = = 1879 – 1900 = = = in 1879 , a group of prominent residents of the madison area met to plan the construction of a church . at the meeting , a total of $ 426 @ . @ 00 was subscribed ; additional contributions of $ 322 @ . @ 86 were received from residents of madison . in january 1880 , the parish ' s trustees spent $ 500 for five acres ( 2 @ . @ 20 ha ) on a hill at the southeastern edge of madison . in the spring , a party of residents drove their ox teams to wisner , about 30 miles ( 50 km ) northeast of madison , for the first load of lumber for the new church . the 25 @ - @ by @ - @ 40 @ - @ by ( 9 m × 12 m ) frame church , with a capacity of 150 , was completed in november 1881 ; the total cost was $ 957 @ . @ 00 , with $ 208 @ . @ 00 going to the parish . the new church was dedicated to st . joseph of saint maurice , an 18th @ - @ century catholic priest , missionary , ascetic , and writer known as the patron saint of parish priests . in 1882 , a parcel of land southeast of the church was purchased for a cemetery ; a 19th @ - @ - @ - @ year child buried in september of that year became the first caretaker . the cemetery was fenced in 1883 . in 1884 , the church was enlarged : a sacristy and a room for the priest were added to the east end , and a porch to the west end . as madison ' s population grew , the church became too small for the growing congregation . in addition , the location southeast of the city was inadequate for the church . in 1898 , a tract of land in madison was purchased . rather than building a new church at the time , the parish elected to move the old church to the new site . the church was moved in two parts ; when it was completed , another section was added between them , increasing the building ' s seating capacity to 180 . the church on the new site was dedicated in november 1898 . == = 1900 – 1913 = = = in the early 20th century , the parish decided that the old church should be remodelled into a school and a residence for the teachers , and that a new church should be built . father joseph darscheid , a local architect , drew up plans for the church ; but financial difficulties delayed its construction . instead , a new basement church was built just west of the old church building . it is not known whether the design of the basement used darscheid ' s plans . construction of the new church began in july 1902 , classes were held there beginning in september 1902 , and it was completed in february 1903 . the school opened in september 1903 , with two classrooms occupied by two sisters of the sisters of the poor of dubuque , iowa . 66 students were enrolled , including a number of non @ - @ catholics , due to overcrowding in the public schools . to make more space available , a well was dug in 1904 . in 1910 , a third floor was added . in 1910 , the parish turned the management of the parish over to the diocese of omaha . in april of that year , edward s . muenich became the first diocesan pastor of st . mary ' s . muenich embarked upon an extensive building program , for which he hired omaha architect edward m . nachtigall . born in germany in 1874 , nachtigall had immigrated to the united states with his family in 1883 . after working as a carpenter in omaha , he had served as a draftsman for that city ' s 1898 trans @ - @ national and international exposition . he had then worked as a clerk for omaha architect thomas rogers kimball from 1900 to 1908 ; during this time , kimball had designed the city ' s st . cecilia ' s church . in 1909 , nachtigall had opened his own architectural office . in 1911 , a two @ - @ - three @ - @ - ##ing , designed by nachtigall was begun ; it was completed and furnished in 1912 , at a cost of $ 10 @ , @ 374 . in the fall of 1912 , the church building was expanded by over 50 percent . = = = 1913 – 1946 = = = in 1913 , a romanesque revival church designed by nachtigall was built on the church basement . the cornerstone was laid and construction begun in may ; the church was completed by the end of august , and formally dedicated on september 4 . the cost of construction was approximately $ 75 @ , @ 000 . when the church wasunder construction , catholic services were held in madison ' s armory . the new church had a seating capacity of 700 . atop its 110 @ - @ foot ( 34 m ) tower was a clock with two 4 @ - @ foot ( 1 @ . @ 8 m ) hands , and a peal of three bells , contributed by the city of madison ; beside calling the parishioners to mass , these rang the quarter @ - @ hours , local time for the residents of the city and the surrounding rural areas . while the urban united states experienced an economic boom during the 1920s , the rural sector of the country faced a depression . collapse of european agriculture during world war i had produced high prices for farm labor , and it had been hoped that europe ' s recovery would be swift and that the high prices would rebound . this gave rise to a boom in farmland prices , which ended when the rapid postwar recovery of american agriculture brought commodity prices down sharply . at the same time , increasing mechanization reduced the demand for farm labor , driving agricultural wages downward and increasing unemployment rates . madison and st . leonard ' s parish suffered from this agricultural decline and from the economic depression of the 1930s . during this time , the parish ' s population remained more or less constant : in 1918 , it consisted of 440 people ; in 1929 , 452 . in 1926 , the parish was forced to close the school , since the presentation sisters were no longer able to run it . the new re @ - @ opened in 1931 , with the students taught by missionary dominican sisters based in omaha . the onset of world war ii once again brought poverty to rural nebraska , and it persisted into the 1950s . st . leonard ' s paid off the war debt , held a mortgage @ - @ burning ceremony in 1946 , and began raising funds for a new school . = = = 1946 – [UNK] = = = the cornerstone for the new school was laid in september 1953 . the property on the old school site was bought , and the house standing upon it converted to a convent for the nuns of the school . the new school was completed and opened for classes in september 1954 ; the old building , which had begun operation as the new st . leonard ' s school , was demolished that fall , and the site became a parking lot . the presentation sisters withdrew from the school in 1978 , prompting the closing of the seventh and eighth grades . the school continued to serve grades k – 6 , taught by two lay teachers . beginning in the early 1990s , madison experienced a large influx of hispanics . in 1990 ,the city ' s population was 9 % hispanic ; by 2010 , the percentage had increased to 13 % . in the city of omaha , whose single largest employer was a meatpacking plant with over 1000 employees , operated by ibp and then by kraft foods , the impact was even greater : the hispanic percentage of the population increased from less than 1 % in 1980 to 1 @ . @ 8 % in 2010 , as the spanish @ - @ speaking population increased and the overall english @ - @ speaking population decreased . in 2011 , an estimated two @ - @ percent of st . leonard ' s residents were hispanic . beginning in 1991 , the archdiocese assigned spanish @ - @ speaking priests to the parish , and both english - and spanish @ - @ language services were offered . the centennial of the church building was celebrated in december 2013 , with a solemn mass celebrated by elden ryan , archbishop emeritus of the archdiocese of omaha . = = church = = in 1989 , three of the church ' s buildings — the church , the rectory , and the church ' s garage — were added to the national register of historic places , including the work of noted nebraska architect jacob m . nachtigall . beside st . leonard ' s , nachtigall designed a number of other notable buildings in nebraska , most of them churches ;
