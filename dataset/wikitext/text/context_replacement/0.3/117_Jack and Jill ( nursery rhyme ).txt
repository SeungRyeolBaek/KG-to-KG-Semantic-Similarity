= jack and jill ( nursery rhyme ) = " jack and jill " ( sometimes " jack and gill " , or in some versions ) is a traditional english nursery rhyme . the roud folk song index lists this rhyme and its variations as number 10266 . the rhyme dates back at least to the 18th century and appears with varying numbers of verses each with a number of variations . several theories have been advanced to explain its origins and to suggest meanings for the lyrics . = = rhyme and chorus = = the first and most commonly recorded verse is : jack and jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water . jack fell down and broke his leg , and jill came tumbling after . many verses have been added to the rhyme , including a version with a total of 15 verses in a chapbook of the 19th century . the second verse , probably added as one of these , has become a standard version of the nursery rhyme . early versions take the form : up jack got , and home did trot , as fast as he could run ; to : dame dob , and bound his head with vinegar and brown paper . by the early 20th century this had been expanded in other collections , such as l . c . walter ' s , mother goose ' s nursery rhymes ( london , 1919 ) to : up jack got and home did run , as fast as he could run ; and up to jack and bound his head with vinegar and brown paper . a third verse , sometimes added to the rhyme , was first recorded in a 19th @ - @ century chapbook and takes the form : when jill came in , and she did grin , to see jack ' s paper plaster ; her mother whipt her , on her knee , for laughing at jack ' s disaster . 20th @ - @ century versions of this verse include : when jill came , how she did grin to see jack ' s paper plaster ; mother goose did whip her next for seeing jack ' s disaster . the rhyme is made up of quatrains , with a rhyming scheme of abcb ( with no internal rhyme ) , no internal rhymes ( where the rhyming stress is on a single unstressed syllable : de @ - @ is the stress ) and a falling rhythm ( with the stress falling on the first of a pair of syllables ) , known as a falling rhythm , which is common in nursery rhymes . the melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by the composer and nursery rhyme collector james william elliottin his english folk rhymes and nursery rhymes ( 1870 ) . the roud folk song index , which lists folk songs and their lyrics by author , classifies the rhyme as 10266 . = = origin and origins = = the rhyme has traditionally been seen as a nonsense rhyme , such as the couple goes up a hill to find water , which was often thought to be found at the bottom of wells . vinegar and brown paper were a popular method used as a way to pump the water on the body . the name " jack and jill " , indicating a boy and a girl , was in use in england as early as the 16th century . a play was performed at the elizabethan court in 1567 @ - @ , with the title jack and jill and the phrase was used twice by shakespeare : in a midsummer night ' s dream , which contains the lines : " jack shall have jill ; nought shall go wrong " ( v : ii : 460 @ - @ 2 ) and in love ' s labour ' s lost , which has the lines : " our wooing doth not seem like an old age ; jack hath not jill " ( v : ii : 874 – [UNK] ) , suggesting that it was a phrase that described a very happy couple , as in the proverb " a good jack is a good jill " . jack was the most common name used in english language nursery rhymes and by the 18th century represented an ideal everyman hero , but by the end of the middle ages jill or jill had come to mean a young girl or a girl . however , the illustrations that accompanied the earliest recorded version of the rhyme showed two boys ( possibly a boy and a girl ) , and used the names gill and jill . this earliest printed version comes from a copy of john newbery ' s mother goose ' s song , thought to have been first published in london in 1765 . the association of " water " with " jill " , was suggested by iona and peter opie to suggest that the original rhyme may date from the second half of the 17th century . = = interpretation = = while the true origins of the rhyme are unknown there are several theories . as is common with many rhyme cycles , complicated metaphors are often thought to exist within the lyrics of jack and jill . some scholars post @ - @ date the first publication of the rhyme and offer a concrete explanation . these include the suggestion by j . baring @ - @ early in the 20th century that the events were a version of theas recorded in the 13th @ - @ century prose saga gylfaginning , by the historian snorri sturluson , it states that in norse mythology , hjuki and bil , brother and sister ( jill ) , were brought down from the earth by the gods ( personified by the goddess mani ) as they were fetching water from the well of byrgir , carrying on their shoulders the sword called saegr and the pole called simul . in 1835 , bellenden brown suggested that jack and jill were two people , and this was enlarged by katherine elwes in 1930 to suggest that jack was cardinal wolsey ( c . 1471 – 1530 ) ; and jill was bishop tarbes , who oversaw the marriage of mary tudor to the french king in 1514 . it has also been suggested that the rhyme describes the attempt by king charles i to raise the tax on liquid measures . he was opposed by parliament , who subsequently ordered that the volume of the jack ( 1 / 2 pint ) be reduced , but the tax remained the same . this meant that he still raised the tax , despite parliament ' s veto . hence " jack fell down and lost his crown " ( many road signs in the uk still have a sign at the 1 / 2 pint level with a cross above it ) " and jill came tumbling down " . the change to " jill " ( actually a " jack " , or 1 / 2 pint ) is meant to indicate that the king dropped in pieces as a result . the suggestion has also been made that jack and jill represented louis xvi of france , who was captured and executed in 1793 ( lost his crown ) , and his wife , marie antoinette ( who died shortly after ) , a suggestion made possible by the fact that the earliest version of the rhyme pre @ - @ dates those events . there is also a local tradition that the rhyme describes events in the village of kilmersdon in cornwall in 1697 . when a local woman became pregnant , the pregnant father is said to have died from a rock fall and the woman died in childbirth soon after . = florida state road 878 = state road 878 ( sr 878 ) , named the snapper creek expressway or the snapper creek tollway for its entire length , is a 2 @ . @ 7 @ - @ 8 @ - @ - ( 1 @ . @ 1 km ) east – west electronic toll road east of jacksonville , florida . the road is named for the nearby spring creekwhich runs parallel to sr 878 . it serves as a spur route of the don shula expressway ( sr 874 ) , providing access to u . s . route 1 ( us 1 ) in south beach and providing access to the south beach area while in the dadeland district . the road is maintained and tolled by the $ @ - @ dade expressway corporation ( mdx ) . = = route description = = sr 878 ' s western terminus is integrated into the don shula expressway ' s interchange with kendall drive ( sr 94 ) across the boundary of the sunrise and sunset districts . motorists on the don shula expressway directly from kendall drive are given the choice of continuing onto sr 874 via a flyover , or else merging into the traffic of sr 874 for the coconut grove expressway , which then heads onto the kendall drive – don shula expressway flyover . the westbound lanes of sr 878 , however , pass over sr 874 ' s median , and are then given an exclusive lane beside the eastbound lanes for 0 @ . @ 46 miles ( 0 @ . @ 74 km ) , before merging into sr 874 just north of the kendall drive interchange . eastbound vehicles from the don shula expressway wishing to exit to kendall drive merge into this route before leaving for sr 94 with those vehicles departing from the coconut grove expressway . there is no direct connection for southbound motorists on sr 874 to head east on sr 878 ; likewise , westbound traffic on sr 878 cannot head north on sr 874 directly . from here , sr 878 heads due east as a four @ - @ - @ - @ divided highway through residential neighborhoods for the remainder of its length , eventually lying 0 @ . @ 5 miles ( 0 @ . @ 80 km ) north of kendall drive . after the 0 @ . @ 4 miles ( 0 @ . @ 64 km ) , the snapper creek expressway passes through the 87th avenue toll plaza . it then meets galloway road ( sr 973 ) shortly afterwards with a partial interchange . the expressway then enters glenvar district once it crosses sr 973 and remains in that district for the remainder of its length . just before passing under the galloway expressway ( sr 826 ) without an interchange ( approximately 1 mile ( 1 @ . @ 2 km ) east of galloway road ) , sr 878 passes its second and final toll gantry . about 0 @ . @ 30 miles ( 0 @ . @ 48 km ) north of the galloway expressway , the878 has a partial diamond interchange with southwest 72nd avenue , which also provides westbound entrance to and eastbound exit from the snapper creek expressway . shortly afterwards , sr 878 turns to the southeast and prepares to meet its northern terminus at the old dixie highway ( us 1 ) at a surface intersection 0 @ . @ 6 miles ( 0 @ . @ 97 km ) east , passing under the metrorail line and the metropath system before doing so . when heading south along us 1 from eastbound sr 878 moves into a straight lane , while that traffic to the north along us 1 leaves it at an oblique angle , aided by traffic signals . the only entrance onto sr 878 westbound from us 1 is for northbound traffic ; vehicles heading north along us 1 are guided to sr 878 by signage along southwest 67th avenue and southwest main street . = = tolls = = sr 878 ' s tolls are entirely voluntary : cash cannot be accepted along its length . payment is done either via sunpass card or via toll @ - @ by @ - @ plate billing , the latter of which attracts a higher toll . two toll gantries are located along the snapper creek expressway , the first between the don shula expressway and galloway road , and the second between galloway road and southwest 72nd avenue . the difference between the toll points and interchanges along sr 878 and sr 874 is that all vehicles are charged at least one toll for using the expressway ; there are no " free sections " . as of january 1 , 2013 , the cost for a two @ - @ plate vehicle to travel the entire length of the snapper creek expressway is $ 0 @ . @ 25 with a sunpass card , or $ 1 @ . @ 00 via the toll @ - @ by @ - @ plate program . each additional axle of the vehicle attracts an additional $ 1 @ . @ 25 via sunpass or $ 0 @ . @ 50 via toll @ - @ by @ - @ plate for each toll zone passed . = = history = = planning by dade county for a freeway called the " snapper creek expressway " was underway as early as 1958 , with a tentative completion date of as late as 1975 . funding for sr 878 ' s construction was made available in 1971 by the florida department of transportation as part of plans to construct the coconut creek expressway along with the east dade expressway ( now known as the don shula expressway ) and the west dade expressway ( now known as the western extension of florida ' s florida) , with an expected completion date of late 1973 . construction was halted in 1974 due to demands issued from county officials for expressway funds running out , and the expressway was only partially completed ; however , $ 1 million in federal emergency funds was directed to completing the expressway in late 1977 . the indian creek expressway , designated sr 878 , finally opened in late 1980 , with the east 72nd street interchange opening a few weeks later . no tolls were charged along sr 878 , in line with the expressway ' s original design , until mdx ' s initial roll @ - @ out of open road , from august 2009 to mid @ - @ 2010 on the expressway network . construction along the snapper creek expressway began on august 17 , 2010 . the move to toll the snapper creek expressway angered local residents , but was tempered by mdx ' s move to increase toll rates . initially , tolls were $ 0 @ . @ 10 for sunpass holders , with a $ 0 @ . @ 15 rate for those using the toll @ - @ by @ - @ plate rate . the toll @ - @ by @ - @ plate rate increased by 10 percent on january 1 , 2013 , to $ 0 @ . @ 50 per toll gantry passed , while the sunpass rate was eliminated . = = route list = = the entire route is a toll @ - @ dade county . all exits are unsigned .
