" angelo was keen to help nicole give birth to a baby boy , george , and she handed him over to marilyn immediately as promised . she then tried to stay away , however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her . marilyn then became frustrated with nicole having the power to take her new baby away . it was then decided that nicole would have to turn off her maternal instincts by giving george away . nicole came to see the baby and marilyn caught her breastfeeding george , while she was playing with him . she cut the scenes " volatile ." nicole was aware that marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby . of the fight scene , james stated : " marilyn is shocked and offended , and this cuts to the very core of her character - that she doesn ' t have the same strong maternal instincts as nicole ' s biological mother . without a doubt , marilyn thinks nicole is pushing the boundaries . she feels that a boundary has been crossed and it could put a huge strain on their relationship . " after the fight , nicole is asked by marylin , to stay away from the baby . james defended nicole saying : " i think it ' s hard to not bond , but this is marilyn ' s baby , and nicole is very happy and wants very much to give marilyn and sid this child .
