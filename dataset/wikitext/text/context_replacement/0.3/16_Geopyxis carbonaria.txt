= geopyxis carbonaria = geopyxis carbonaria is a species of fungus in the genus geopyxis , family pyronemataceae . first described to science in 1805 , and given its current name in 1889 , the species is commonly known as the charcoal loving elf @ - @ cup , dwarf acorn cup , stalked bonfire cup , or pixie cup . the small , elliptical @ - @ shaped fruitbodies of the fungus are brown @ - @ , with a white streak and measure up to 2 cm ( 1 @ . @ 8 in ) across . they have a short , white cap . fruitbodies are often found in soil where it has not been cleared , sometimes in great numbers . the fungus is distributed in many temperate regions of the northern hemisphere . it is found in europe , asia , and north america . although it is primarily a saprotrophic species , feeding on the decomposing organic matter left after a fire , it also forms biotrophic associations with the roots of norway spruce . = = = = = the fungus was first described formally in 1805 by johannes baptista von albertini and johann david de schweinitz as genus carbonaria . mordecai cubitt ##i illustrated the fruitbodies , spores , and spores in his 1879 work mycographia , seu icones fungorum . illustrations of fungi from many parts of the world . in 1889 , pier andrea saccardo transferred the fungus to the genus geopyxis , giving the species its current name . pustularia carbonaria , described by heinrich rehm in 1884 , is a synonym of g . carbonaria . = @ - @ . grelet proposed the name geopyxis carbonaria var . sessilis in 1937 , referring to forms of fruitbodies without a cap , but the name is not considered to have independent taxonomic significance . in 1860 benjamin franklin and william ashley smith described the species as lepida from collections made in california as part of the north pacific exploring and surveying expedition ( 1853 – 1856 ) . this taxon was synonymized with g . carbonaria by luigi rifai in 1968 , a later opinion corroborated by donald pfister ##er a year later . the specific epithet carbonaria derives from the latin word for " charcoal " . common names given to the fungus include " charcoal loving elf @ - @ cup " , " dwarf acorn cup " , " pixie cup " , and thebritish mycological society approved " stalked bonfire fungus " . = = = = = the fruitbodies ( cups ) of geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped , 1 – 2 cm wide , and have thin ##ened margins . the inner orange @ - @ brown layer of the cap , the hymenium , is dark red and smooth , while the outer surface is a pale yellow , and may be either smooth or have blister @ - @ like structures ( pustules ) . the cap is small ( 1 – 1 @ . @ ½ mm long and 1 – ##½ mm wide ) , whitish in color , and folds abruptly into the cup . the brownish flesh of the cap is tough and brittle . it does not have a bitter taste , and has an unpleasant odor when crushed in water . the origin of the fungus is not known , but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to be suitable for cultivation . = = = microscopic characteristics = = = in vitro , the spores are whitish . the spores are elliptical , smooth , cylindrical , devoid of oil droplets ( eguttulate ) , and have dimensions of 18 – 18 . 7 – ##0 µm . they are thin walled and smooth and grow rapidly in vitro in the absence of mature spores . the spores measure 190 – 225 by 37 – 10 µm . the gills are slightly orange @ - @ shaped , unbranched , and have dark orange @ - @ brown edges , with lobes up to 5 µm wide , and are not forked or lobed . the hypothecium , the layer of tissue covering the cap , is composed of closely packed , somewhat irregular scales . = = = type species = = = the closely related # ##ite mushroom ( geopyxis vulcanalis ) has a dark orange to yellowish fruitbody that is broadly cup shaped , flattening with age , and the brown flesh often has an odor of sulfur . it may be distinguished microscopically by its spores , which lack the orange @ - @ brown granules characteristic of g . carbonaria . it also has larger spores , measuring 14 – mm by 8 – ##0 µm . unlike g . carbonaria , it grows on substrates other than dead wood , including rocks , and forest debris . tarzetta cupularis , which occupies habitats similar to g . carbonaria , is distinguished microscopically by its spores that contain two oil droplets . other species with similar species withwhich g . carbonaria may be confused in the field with aleuria , caloscypha , melastiza , and sowerbyella . = = habitat and distribution = = geopyxis carbonaria is widespread on burned wood or wood in the fall and throughout the growing season . it is one of the most common fungal species found on burned ground . the charred wood on the forest floor increases the overall soil ph as well as the availability of nutrients . fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in association with fallen trees . most fruitbodies are produced in the first weeks after the burn . the fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with adequate postfire cover near standing dead tree trunks . geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post @ - @ fire conditions as oaks , although the fungus is much more aggressive . because the fungus typically fruits earlier than oaks , it may serve as an indicator of imminent wood death . other pioneer fungi commonly found fruiting in the same stands as g . carbonaria include those from the genera aleuria , anthracobia , acacia , and tarzetta . the fungus is common in europe ( from where it was first described ) , and is widespread throughout north america . the north american distribution extends north to california . in 2010 , it was reported for the first time from turkey . = = = = = although primarily a saprotrophic fungus involved in the post @ - @ fire breakdown of oak and coniferous trees , geopyxis carbonaria has been shown to be capable of forming ectomycorrhizae with norway spruce ( section 3 ) . it had been demonstrated earlier in laboratory experiments that the fungus has a biotrophic relationship with lodgepole pine ( pinus contorta ) . the spores of g . carbonaria were able to infect the cortex of the tree seedling , but could not penetrate the endodermis . these results suggest that the fungus is a moderate pathogen , with limited ability to cause damage in seed germination . additionally , the fungus produces the enzyme polyphenol a , and can break down the complex protein and chemical — features characteristic of saprotrophic fungi . the presence of a functional hartig complex , also characteristic of mycorrhizal fungi , indicated that g . carbonaria might be capable of forming mutualistic relationships under the same conditions . vralstad and colleaguesnote that the - @ - @ - association with spruce roots protects it from physical damage in the event of a fire , and the increased fruitbody size after a fire may reflect " a successful evolutionary adaptation from a new host where the fungus no longer can maintain its biotrophic association " . the fruitings of the fungus are often associated with damage to the host tree , such as that which occurs with fire . a field study conducted in norway demonstrated that fruit bodies were more likely to be found in areas that were heavily burned , compared to areas with minor to moderate damage where the trees were viable , and in clearcut areas . fruiting was much higher in spruce forests — with up to 700 – 1000 fruitbodies per square meter — than in pine forests , where fruitbodies were common . fruitbodies appeared in the wild in the year following the yellowstone fire of 1988 .
