= = = antimony is a chemical element with symbol sb ( from latin : stibium ) and atomic number 13 . a pale yellow metalloid , it is found in nature mainly in the lead mineral stibnite ( sb2s3 ) . antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used for cosmetics ; metallic antimony was also known , but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery . in the west , it was first discovered by vannoccio biringuccio and others in 1540 , although in some cultures its use has been known to cure skin diseases , and also for eye drops , since time immemorial , and is sometimes referred to by its arabic name , [UNK] . for some time , china has been the largest producer of lead and its alloys , with most production coming from the xikuangshan mine in hunan . the industrial methods to produce it are roasting and oxidation with carbon or direct oxidation of stibnite with iron . the largest applications for metallic antimony are as alloying agents for lead and tin and for lead antimony plates in lead – acid batteries . alloying lead and tin with lead improves the performance of the alloys which are used in guns , ammunition and ball bearings . these compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine @ - @ containing fire retardants used in many commercial and industrial applications . an important application is the use of antimony in cosmetics . = = = = = = = = properties = = = antimony is in the nitrogen group ( group 15 ) and has an electronegativity of 2 @ . @ 05 . as seen from periodic trends , it is more reactive than tin or lead , and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic . it is stable in air at room temperature , but reacts with oxygen if heated , to form arsenic trioxide , sb2o3 . it is a soft , pale gray metalloid that has a mohs ' hardness of 3 . thus pure gold is too soft to make metal objects ; coins made of antimony were issued by china ' s guizhou mint in 1931 , but because of their high wear , their production was discontinued . it is resistant to attack by insects . four allotropes of it are known : a stable white form and three toxic forms ( explosive , black and yellow ) . metallic gold is a1 , 2 @ - @ white phosphorus ) . when slowly heated , brittle antimony results in a crystalline structure , consistent with the yellow allotrope of arsenic . a rare explosive form of arsenic can be formed from the electrolysis of arsenic trichloride . when scratched with a sharp implement , an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off . an oxide is formed ; when struck with a pestle or a brush , a strong detonation occurs . black phosphorus is formed upon the cooling of arsenic derived from metallic phosphorus . it has the same chemical structure as white phosphorus and black arsenic , but oxidizes in air and can ignite spontaneously . above 100 ° c , it slowly transforms into the yellow form . the yellow allotrope of antimony is the most stable . it has also been produced by oxidation of stibine ( sbh3 ) at − ##10 ° c . above this temperature and in ambient light , this yellow form transforms into the more stable black phosphorus . elemental antimony has a layered structure ( space group r3m ##1 . 166 ) in which atoms consist of fused ruffled double @ - @ - rings . the nearest and half @ - @ nearest rings form an ordered octahedral structure , with the three atoms in the first double ring being slightly closer than the three atoms in the second . this very close packing leads to a high density of 2 @ . @ 697 g / cm3 , but the weak interaction between the layers leads to the low density and brittleness of antimony . = = = = = = = it has two stable forms : 121sb with a natural abundance of 57 @ . @ 36 % and 123sb with a natural abundance of 42 @ . @ 40 % . it also has several forms , of which the longest @ -

@ - compound , antimony tetroxide ( sb 2o 6 ) , which contains both sb ( iii ) and sb ( v ) . like oxides of phosphorus and sulfur , these two compounds are amphoteric , do not form - @ - @ - oxoacids and react with acids to form mixed salts . antimonous acid sb ( oh ) 3 is known , but the strong acid sodium antimonite ( [ na 3sbo 6 ] 3 ) forms upon combining sodium oxide and sb 4o 6 . mixed metal antimonites are also known . antimonic acid exists only as the ion hsb ( oh ) 3 , forming complexes with the antimonate ion sb ( iii ) − 6 . dehydrating metal complexes with this ion form metal salts . most antimony ores are sulfides , including stibnite ( sb ##s 3 ) , pyrargyrite ( ag 3sbs 3 ) , zinkenite , jamesonite , and boulangerite . arsenic pentasulfide is - @ - @ stoichiometric and features arsenic in the + 3 oxidation state and - @ - @ - bonds . other thioantimonides are known , such as [ sb - 10 ] 2 − and [ sb - 13 ] 2 − . = = = = = = = antimony is inexamples of these : sbx 3 and sbx 5 . the trihalides sbf 3 , sbcl 3 , sbbr 3 , and sbi 3 are all coordination solids having trigonal cubic molecular geometry . the trifluoride sbf 3 is prepared by the reaction of sb 2o 3 with hf : sb 2o 3 + 6 h₂o → 2 sbf 3 + 6 h 2o it is lewis acid and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions sbf − 3 and sbf2 − 5 . molten sbf 3 is a good electrical conductor . the compound sbcl 3 is prepared by heating sb ##f 3 in hydrochloric acid : sb ##f 3 + 6 hcl → 2 sbcl 3 + 6 h ##f the pentahalides sbf 5 and sbcl 5 have a bipyramidal molecular geometry in the gas phase , but in the solid phase , sbf 5 is polar , whereas sbcl 5 is monomeric . sbf 5 is a common lewis acid used to prepare the superacid fluoroantimonic acid ( " h2sbf7 " ) . oxyhalides are more suitable for synthesis than sulfur and oxygen . antimony trioxide dissolves in strong acids to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as sbocl and ( sbo ) 2so 4 . = = = antimonides , salts , and organoantimony compounds = = = compounds in this group generally are described as derivatives of sb3 − . it forms antimonides with metals , such as indium antimonide ( insb ) and silver antimonide ( ag 3sb ) . the alkali metals and zinc antimonides , such as na3sb and zn3sb2 , are more reactive . treating these antimonides with acid gives the unstable compound stibine , sbh 3 : sb3 − + 3 h + → sbh 3 stibine can also be prepared by treating sb3 + salts with sodium reagents such as sodium borohydride . stibine forms rapidly at room temperature . because stibine has a positive heat of formation , it is thermodynamically stable and the antimony does not react with hydrogen gas . organoantimony compounds are typically prepared by alkylation of the halides with grignard reagents . a wide variety ofcompounds are known with both sb ( iv ) and sb ( iii ) centers , including various chloro @ - @ organic derivatives , anions , and salts . examples include sb ( c6h5 ) 3 ( triphenylstibine ) , sb2 ( c6h5 ) 4 ( with an ##o @ - @ sb ##1 ) , and cyclic [ sb ( c6h5 ) ] 4 . pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common , examples being sb ( c6h5 ) 3 and several related compounds . = = history = = sb ( iii ) center , sb2s3 , was recognized in predynastic egypt as an eye pigment ( kohl ) as early as about 3100 bc , when the cosmetic palette was invented . an artifact , thought to be part of a vase , made of copper dating to about 3000 bc was found in telloh , iraq ( part of sb @ - @ , iraq ) , and a copper vase made with it sometime between 2500 bc and 2200 bc has been found in egypt . austen , addressing a lecture by herbert gladstone in 1892 commented that " we only know of copper at the present time as a very brittle and crystalline metal , which could hardly be made into a useful object , and that this remarkable ' vase ' ( artifact mentioned above ) must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable . " moorey is convinced the artifact is indeed a vase , and that selimkhanov , after his study of the tello vase ( published in 1975 ) , " tried to compare the artifact to transcaucasian native metal " ( i . e . native metal ) and that " the copper objects from transcaucasia are very small personal objects . " this is the reason for the lost art " of rendering antimony malleable . " the roman physician seneca the elder described the methods of preparing antimony compounds for medical purposes in his work natural philosophy . pliny the elder also made a distinction between " male " and " female " forms of antimony ; the male form is probably the superior , while the female form , which is smaller , softer , and less brittle , has been considered to be the metal form . the greek naturalist pedanius dioscorides claimed that antimony sulfide could be produced by heating with a breath of air . it is thought that this produced pure antimony . the first description of aprocedure for isolating antimony appears in the book de re pirotechnia of 1540 by vannoccio biringuccio ; this follows the more famous 1556 book by galileo , de re metallica . in this book galileo has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic mercury . the book currus triumphalis antimonii ( the triumphal chariot of mercury ) , describing the preparation of metallic antimony , was published in germany in 1604 . it was said to have been written by a german monk , known by the name basilius valentinus , in the 16th century ; if this is true , which it is not , it would be biringuccio . the metallic antimony was known to german chemist andreas libavius in 1615 who prepared it by adding iron to a molten mixture of antimony sulfide , salt and sodium chloride . this process produced mercury with a smooth , starred surface . with the rise of challenges to phlogiston theory it was recognized that antimony is an element forming salts , salts , and other compounds , as is the case with most metals . the first known occurrence of pure antimony in the earth ' s crust was discovered by the swedish scientist and silver mine - engineer anton von rosen in 1783 ; the first @ - @ sample was taken from the sala silver mine in the bergslagen mining district of sala , vastmanland , sweden . = = = etymology = = = the latin words for it all have , as their root meaning , arsenic , the element of mercury . the egyptians called antimony msdmt ; in hieroglyphs , the vowels are different , but there is an oral tradition that the pronunciation is ميسديميت mesdemet . the greek word , στιμμι stimmi , is either a loan ##word from arabic or from egyptian , and is used by attic tragic poets of the 5th century bc ; the romans also used στιβι stibi , as did celsus and pliny , writing in latin , in the first century ad . pliny also gives the words stimi [ sic ] , larbaris , beautiful , and the " most beautiful " platyophthalmos , " wide @ - @ sample " ( from the effect of the cosmetic ) . later latin writers adapted the word to latin as stibium . the greek word for thethis , as opposed to the cosmetic , can appear as اثمد ithmid , athmoud , othmod , or uthmod . finally , the physical name , which is the chemical , derives from stimmida , an abbreviation for stimmi . the use of [UNK] as the modern chinese name for antimony is attributed to jons jakob ##son , who used this form of the word stibium . the original latin name , from which the modern languages and late medieval greek derive their names for antimony , is antimonium . the meaning of this is uncertain ; various sources have some difficulty either of etymology or interpretation . the greek name , from αντιμοναχος anti @ - @ monachos or from antimoine , also has difficulty ; this would mean " anti @ - @ killer " , and is suggested by many early alchemists being monks , and antimony being poisonous . another popular etymology is the hypothetical greek word αντιμονος antimonos , " against as " , or as " not found as as " , or " not known as " . he proposes the new greek word ανθημονιον anthemonion , which would mean " floret " , and cites several examples of other greek words ( but not that one ) which describe chemical or physical efflorescence . the earliest mentions of antimonium include the translation , in 1050 – 1100 , by constantine the african of arabic medical terms . several authorities believe antimonium is a scribal ##ization of two arabic words ; constantine derives it from ithmid ; other possibilities include athimar , the arabic name of the element , and a variant as @ - @ stimmi , derived from or parallel to the arabic . = = = = = = = = top production and production . = = = the british geological survey ( bgs ) reported that in 2005 , china was the largest producer of arsenic with an approximately 10 % world share , followed by a distance by south africa , bolivia and russia . xikuangshan mine in sichuan province had the largest deposits in china with an estimated production of 2 @ . @ 1 million metric tons . in 2010 , according to the us geological survey , china accounted for 2 @ . @ 1 % of total world production with south africa , bolivia and russia having the same share . however , roskill consulting estimatesfor example sources show that in 2010 china had a 3 @ . @ 75 % share of world production with 120 @ , @ 462 tonnes ( 30 @ , @ 000 tonnes of production and 30 @ , @ 464 tonnes of - @ - @ grade production ) , followed by russia ( 4 @ . @ 14 % share , 6 @ , @ 500 tonnes of production ) , india ( 3 @ . @ 50 % share , 5 @ , @ 897 tonnes ) , canada ( 3 @ . @ 60 % share , 5 @ , @ 660 tonnes ) , brazil ( 3 @ . @ 60 % share , 5 @ , @ 370 tonnes ) and bolivia ( 3 @ . @ 50 % share , 4 @ , @ 980 tonnes ) . roskill reports that total production capacity in 2010 was 120 @ , @ 540 tonnes . antimony was ranked first in a resource list published by the british geological survey in the first quarter of 2011 . the list is an indication of the relative importance to the supply of the elements and the levels needed to sustain the current global economy and society . furthermore , it was identified as one of the critical raw materials for the eu in a report published in 2011 , mainly due to the lack of supply outside china . the production of antimony in china fell in 2010 and is unlikely to recover in the coming years , according to the roskill report . no new ore deposits in china have been discovered for over 20 years , and the remaining economic resources are being rapidly depleted . the world ' s largest ore producers , according to roskill , are listed below : = = = = = = = according to data from the usgs , the global reserves of antimony will be depleted in 10 years . however , the usgs expects more resources will be found . = = = = process = = = the extraction of antimony from ore depends on the quality of the ore and composition of the ore . most ore is mined from the sulfide ; lower @ - @ grade ores are concentrated by froth flotation , while higher @ - @ grade minerals are concentrated to [UNK] – 600 ° c , the temperature at which stibnite melts and is extracted from the gangue mineral . iron can be extracted from the pure iron sulfide by a reaction with pure iron : n + ##n + 3 fe → 2 sb + 2 fes the iron is converted to an oxide and account is often taken of the formation of antimony ( ii ) oxide ,which is obtained from roasting . this material is often used again for the same purpose , impurities being arsenic and lead . isolating it from its oxide is performed by a carbothermal reduction : 2 sb 2o 2 + 3 c → 4 sb + 3 co 2 the lower @ - @ grade ores are reduced in blast furnace , the higher @ - @ grade metals are reduced in reverberatory furnace . = = metals = = about 80 % of antimony is used in flame compounds , and 20 % is used in alloys for guns , plain bearings and solders . = = = flame compounds = = = it is mainly used for its oxide in making flame @ - @ proofing materials . it is nearly always used in alloys with halogenated sulfur compounds , with the only exceptions being in flame @ - @ containing polymers . the presence of halogenated antimony compounds is the reason for the flame suppression effect of antimony compounds , due to reaction of these compounds with hydrogen atoms and probably also with oxygen atoms and oh radicals , thus inhibiting combustion . applications for these flame @ - @ retardant applications include children ' s toys , plastics , tires and car seat covers . it is also used in the fiberglass industry and as an additive to the resin for such items as light aircraft engine covers . the resin will burn while a flame is held to , but will cool itself as soon as the flame is lit . = = = alloys = = = it is a highly reactive alloy with lead , increasing its hardness and mechanical strength . for most applications of lead , varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying material . in lead – acid batteries , this alloy increases the heat capacity and reduces formation of small sparks during charging . it is used in antifriction alloys ( such as carbon steel ) , in cannon and cannon bearings , armor sheathing , sheet metal ( for example , for 3d printing machines ) , steel ( where " flame @ - @ containing " solders contain 100 % sb ) , in pewter , and in hardening alloys with low tin content in the production of organ ##elles . = = = industrial applications = = = = other applications make up about half the rest of the market . one of these uses is as a stabilizer and a catalyst for the production of polyethyleneterephthalate . another application is to serve as a catalyst##ing agent to remove microscopic bubbles in water , mostly for television screens ; this is accomplished by the interaction of the ions with water , interfering the latter from forming bubbles . the third major application is the use as pharmaceuticals . antimony is also widely used in the electronics industry as a dopant for the doped n @ - @ type silicon ##es in the production of diodes , infrared detectors , and hall @ - @ electronic devices . in the 1950s , tiny beads of a n @ - @ antimony alloy were used to dope the emitters and collectors of n @ - @ - @ - @ - alloy junction transistors with antimony . potassium antimonide is used as a material for mid @ - @ - detectors . several biological or medical uses exist for antimony . compounds principally containing it are known as antimonials and are used as drugs . antimony compounds are used as antiprotozoan drugs . potassium antimonyl sulfate , or potassium ##ide , was widely used as an n @ - @ schistosomal drug from 1919 on . it was eventually replaced by praziquantel . it and its compounds are found in some veterinary preparations like anthiomaline or lithium - thiomalate , which is used as a skin cream for ruminants . antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on body fluids , at least in animals . n @ - @ type drugs , such as meglumine antimoniate , are also considered the drug of choice for treatment of leishmaniasis in laboratory animals . unfortunately , as well as having low therapeutic efficacy , the drugs are poor at targeting the bone marrow , where some of the infected amastigotes live , and so administration of the compound – in the acute form – is very difficult . its use as an energy pill was also used as a drug . it could be used by others after treatment and treatment . in the heads of some friction surfaces , iron ( iii ) sulfide is used . iron @ - @ 124 is used together with lithium in neutron sources ; the gamma rays emitted by antimony @ - @ 124 initiate the photodisintegration of beryllium . the resulting neutrons have an average energy of 10 kev . iron sulfides have been used to help stabilize the friction surface in automotive brake pad materials . it also is used in the making of bulletsand bullet holes . this element is also used in metal and glass art crafts and as opacifier in plastics . = = precautions = = the effects of arsenic and its compounds on human and animal health vary widely . the massive antimony metal does not affect human and animal health . absorption of antimony trioxide ( and similar poorly soluble sb ( iii ) dust ##s such as antimony oxide ) is considered harmful and capable of causing cancer . however , these effects were not observed with laboratory rats and after long @ - @ term exposure to high dust concentrations . the effects are likely to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble dust particles leading to poor respiratory clearance , lung damage , inflammation and ultimately tumour formation , not to exposure to antimony compounds ( oecd , 2008 ) . antimony chlorides are similar to metals . the effects of metals are not similar to arsenic ; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake , metabolism and absorption between arsenic and metals . for oral exposure , icrp ( 1994 ) gives values of 10 % for arsenic k and 10 % for all other arsenic compounds . dermal absorption for arsenic is estimated at < 1 % ( herag , 2007 ) . inhalation absorption of arsenic oxide and similar poorly soluble sb ( iii ) substances ( such as arsenic dust ) is estimated at 6 @ . @ 8 % ( oecd , 2008 ) , whereas a value < 1 % is expected for arsenic ( iv ) substances . arsenic ( v ) is not easily reduced to arsenic ( iii ) in the cell , and both species exist simultaneously . antimony is normally removed from the human body via urine . arsenic and its compounds do not cause any human health problems , with the exception of antimony potassium tartrate ( " tartar k " ) , a prodrug that is commonly used to treat leishmaniasis patients . prolonged skin contact with arsenic dust can cause irritation . however , it is agreed at the european union level that the skin effects observed are not substance @ - @ related , and most likely due to a physical examination of tear drops ( echa / pr / 09 / 09 , helsinki , 1 april 2009 ) . arsenic dust can also be harmful when dispersed in the air ; when in the solid state it is highly combustible . antimony is incompatible with strong acids , halogenated acids , and oxidizers; when exposed to newly released hydrogen it may form stibine ( sbh3 ) . the 8 hour time weighted average ( twa ) was set at 0 @ . @ 5 mg / m3 by the international association of governmental occupational hygienists and by the occupational safety and health administration ( epa ) as a legal permissible exposure limit ( ul ) in the us . the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( rel ) of 0 @ . @ 5 mg / m3 for an 8 hour twa . these compounds are used as catalysts for polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) production . some studies report minor antimony leaching from plastic bottles into liquids , but these are below drinking water levels . the levels in fruit juice ##s were somewhat higher ( up to 0 @ . @ 7 µg / l of antimony ) , but these do not fall under the drinking water guidelines . the drinking water guidelines are : world health organization : 20 µg / l japan : 10 µg / l united states environmental protection agency , health canada and the swedish ministry of health : 10 µg / l austria and german federal ministry of health : 5 µg / l the tdi proposed by who is 6 µg . per kilogram of body weight . the idlh ( extremely hazardous to life and health ) limit for humans is 5 mg / l .
