= wasp @ - @ 13b = wasp @ - @ 13b is an extrasolar planet that was discovered in 2008 in the orbit of the sunlike star wasp @ - @ 13 . the planet has a mass of nearly half that of jupiter , but a radius five @ - @ fourths the radius of jupiter . this low relative mass may be caused by a star that is of low mass or that is not solid at all . the planet orbits at about 1 % of the distance between the sun and earth every 10 days . the star was observed several times between 2006 and 2009 , at first through the superwasp program and later through the follow @ - @ up program . analysis of the radial velocity measurements led to the discovery of wasp @ - @ 13b , which was reported in a paper on february 7 , 2009 . a follow @ - @ up paper published in 2011 investigated the possibility for inflated planets such as wasp @ - @ 13b , and the @ - @ examined ( and the @ - @ constrained ) its mass , radius , density , and age . = = discovery = = between november 27 , 2006 , and january 1 , 2007 , 3329 observations of the star wasp @ - @ 13 by the superwasp @ - @ north program team at roque de los muchachos observatory in the canary islands led to the identification of wasp @ - @ 13 as host to a potentially transiting planet . the first @ - @ up images were taken on february 7 , 2008 by the john gregory telescope ( jgt ) in australia , which obtained 1047 images of the star , although the first twenty images taken were obscured by cloud cover and subsequently lost . using hd 80408 as the host star along with jgt images , the astronomers investigating the planet were able to determine a light curve for the orbiting planet . wasp @ - @ 13 was observed between february 11 and 13 in 2008 by the sophie echelle spectrograph at the haute @ - @ 3 observatory in france , determining the radial velocity of the transiting planet . use of the fies echelle data at the nordic optical telescope in the canary islands gained other spectral properties that yielded the existence of the planet . analysis of the sophie and fies data was able to constrain some of the orbiting body ' s characteristics . the discovery of the orbiting body ' s mass and radial velocity measurements led to its confirmation as the planet wasp @ - @ 13b . the discovery of wasp @ - @ 13b was reported in the journal astronomyand astrophysics at the european southern observatory on may 19 , 2009 . the discovery paper was received in the press on may 22 , 2009 . later , between 2009 and 2011 , another team of astronomers observed wasp @ - @ 13b and wasp @ - @ 21b to find what caused the hot jupiters to reach such high orbits . the hires photometric camera on the liverpool telescope was used to detect the planets . two partial ##s and two full orbits were observed during this period , although the accuracy of both full orbits was significantly reduced because of the cloud cover . the collected observations , along with the jgt observations that were used to determine the orbit , were used to rule out errors such as background noise . the data was then used to re @ - @ define wasp @ - @ 13b ' s characteristics , including its age , mass , radius , and density . the study also noted that a limb darkening effect was present , a characteristic that may affect the surface conditions of the planet . = = host star = = wasp @ - @ 13 is a sunlike g @ - @ type star located in the cancer constellation . measurements made by fies and sophie did not fit the mass , radius , and density well ; however , a later 2011 study using the liverpool telescope re @ - @ constrained those characteristics . the star ' s mass was estimated at 1 @ . @ 09 times the mass of the sun , its radius at 1 @ . @ 559 times that of the sun , and its density at 0 @ . @ 288 that ' s the sun ' s density . these characteristics are re @ - @ defined taking limb darkening into account . the star ' s metallicity , which is measured by iron content , is estimated roughly at [ fe / h ] = 0 , similar to that of the sun . however , the star ' s estimated effective temperature is 5826 k , slightly lower than the sun . wasp @ - @ 13 has an apparent magnitude of 10 @ . @ 13 , making it visible to the unaided eye as seen from earth . = = characteristics = = wasp @ - @ 13b is a dwarf planet with an estimated mass that is ( including limb darkening ) 1 @ . @ 477 times that of jupiter and a radius that is 1 @ . @ 389 times jupiter ' s radius . the mass is , in other words , less than half the mass of jupiter , and slightly less than fourteen times its radius . wasp @ - @ 13b ' s low mass cancan likely be due to the presence of a 4 @ - @ mass core , or to the complete absence of a core , according to the kepler team . wasp @ - @ 13b , which orbits its host star at a distance of 0 @ . @ 05362 days , orbits the star approximately every 0 @ . @ 35298 days . the 2011 study of the planet recognized wasp @ - @ 13b as the fourth highest @ - @ density extrasolar planet discovered , after wasp @ - @ 7b ; wasp @ - @ 17b ; tres @ - @ 4b ; and tres @ - @ 5b . wasp @ - @ 13b has an orbital inclination of 0 . 9ยบ , which means that it is almost 4 @ - @ on as seen from earth .
