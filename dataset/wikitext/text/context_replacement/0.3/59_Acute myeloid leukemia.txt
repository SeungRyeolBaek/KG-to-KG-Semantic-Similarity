= acute acute leukemia = acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) , also known as acute myelogenous leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia ( anll ) , is a disease of the myeloid line of blood cells , characterized by the progressive accumulation of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of white blood cells . aml is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults , and its incidence increases with age . although aml is a relatively rare disease , accounting for roughly 1 @ . @ 2 % of all cases in the united states , its incidence is expected to increase as the population ages . the symptoms of aml are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells , which causes a drop in red blood cells , leukemia , and normal white blood cells . these symptoms include fever , lack of breath , easy breathing and bleeding , and increased risk of infection . several risk factors and genetic abnormalities have been identified , but the exact cause is not known . as an acute leukemia , aml progresses rapidly and is usually fatal within weeks or months if treated alone . aml has several subtypes ; treatment and outcomes vary among subtypes . aml is cured in 35 – 40 % of people less than 60 years old and in – 15 % more than 60 years old . older people who are not able to withstand conventional chemotherapy have an average survival of 5 – 10 years . aml is treated first with chemotherapy aimed at inducing a remission ; people may go on to receive additional chemotherapy or a liver stem cell transplant . recent research into the causes of aml has resulted in the availability of data that can predict which treatments and drugs will work best for a particular person , as well as how long that person is likely to live . the signs and symptoms of aml differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( cml ) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same ; aml has higher percentages of normal and immature cells , including more blasts ( tumors , tumors , and megakaryoblasts ) . = = signs and symptoms = = the signs and symptoms of aml are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells . a lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to cancer ; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors ,they have no other @ - @ related symptoms . a drop in white blood cell count ( ck ) can cause fatigue , paleness , and shortness of breath . a lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor symptoms . the early signs of aml are often vague and nonspecific , and may be similar to those of asthma or other respiratory illnesses . some generalized signs include fever , fatigue , weight loss , loss of appetite , shortness of breath , headache , severe bruising or bleeding , petechiae ( small , pin @ - @ - sized spots on the skin caused by bleeding ) , joint and muscle pain , and persistent or persistent infections . swelling of the skin may occur in aml , but it is usually mild and transient . radial node involvement is common in aml , in contrast to chronic lymphoblastic leukemia . the skin is involved about 50 % of the time in the development of leukemia ##s . rarely , sweet ' s disease , a paraneoplastic swelling of the skin , can occur with aml . some people with aml may experience swelling of the skin because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue . alternatively , the first sign of leukemia may be the presence of a solid leukemic cell or tumor outside of the bone marrow , called a chloroma . occasionally , a person may show similar symptoms , and the leukemia may be detected incidentally during a routine blood test . = = risk factors = = a number of risk factors for developing aml have been identified , including : various blood disorders , chemical exposure , nuclear radiation , and chemotherapy . = = = preleukemia = = = " preleukemic " blood disorders , such as myelodysplastic syndrome ( mps ) or myeloproliferative syndrome ( mps ) , can evolve into aml ; the exact risk depends on the type of mds / mps . = = = chemical exposure = = = exposure to chemotherapy agents , in particular alkylating agents , can increase the risk of people with aml . the risk is highest about three to five years after diagnosis . other chemotherapy agents , including epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines , have also been associated with pin @ - @ related diseases , which are often associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic cells . the chemical exposure to benzene and other aromatic organic compoundsremains controversial as a cause of aml . benzene and many of its derivatives are known to be carcinogenic in vitro . while some studies have suggested a correlation between occupational exposure to radiation and the risk of aml , others have suggested the actual risk , if any , is slight . = = = radiation = = = high amounts of occupational radiation exposure can increase the risk of aml . survivors of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki had an increased risk of aml , as did radiologists exposed to high amounts of x @ - @ radiation prior to the introduction of modern radiation therapy practices . people treated with occupational radiation after treatment for prostate cancer , x @ - @ hodgkin disease , lung cancer and breast cancer have the highest chance of acquiring aml , but this increased risk adds to the increased risk observed in the general population after 20 years . = = = = = = = = hereditary risk for aml appears to exist . multiple cases of aml developing in a family at a rate greater than predicted by genetics alone have been reported . certain congenital conditions may increase the likelihood of diagnosis ; the most common is probably down syndrome , which is associated with a 10 - to 20 @ - @ years increase in the risk of aml . = = diagnosis = = the first clue to a diagnosis of aml is usually an abnormal result on a complete blood count . while an excess of circulating white blood cells ( cbc ) is a common finding , and leukemic blasts are often seen , aml can also occur with significant decreases in platelets , red blood cells , or even with a low white blood cell count ( cbc ) . while a definitive diagnosis of aml can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts , a definitive diagnosis still requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and imaging . marrow or blood is examined under light microscopy , as well as flow cytometry , to diagnose the cause of leukemia , to differentiate aml from other types of leukemia ( e . g . , lymphoblastic leukemia - 1 ) , and to classify the subtype of disease . a sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine screening or by in situ hybridization . genetic testing may also be conducted to look for specific mutations in genes such as flt3 , nucleophosmin , and kit , which may influence theoutcome of the disease . cytochemical stains on blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the distinguishing of aml from all , and the subclassification of aml . the combination of a myeloperoxidase or sudan black reaction and a specific esterase stain can provide the desired information in simple cases . the myeloperoxidase or sudan black reactions are most useful in determining the identity of aml and distinguishing it from all . the specific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component of amls and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic component from all . the diagnosis and treatment of aml can be difficult , and should be performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist . in straightforward cases , the presence of specific genetic features ( such as auer syndrome ) or specific flow cytometry features can distinguish aml from other conditions ; however , in the absence of these features , diagnosis may be more difficult . the two most widely used classification systems for aml are the older japanese @ - @ american @ - @ british ( fab ) system and the newer world health organization ( who ) system . according to the widely used who system , the diagnosis of aml is achieved by demonstrating involvement of more than 20 % of the blood and / or bone marrow of leukemic myeloblasts , resulting in the three best prognosis groups of aml with associated genetic abnormalities ( t ( 15 ; 16 ) , inv ( 15 ) , and t ( 15 ; 17 ) ) in which the presence of the genetic abnormalities is diagnostic value of 50 percent . the japanese – american – british ( fab ) system is a bit more stringent , requiring a blast test of at least 30 % in bone marrow ( mb ) or whole blood ( lb ) for the diagnosis of aml . aml must be clearly differentiated from " preleukemic " conditions such as myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative syndromes , which are treated separately . because acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) has the highest risk and requires a specific course of treatment , it is difficult to quickly establish or exclude the diagnosis of this subtype of leukemia . direct in situ genetic testing on blood or bone marrow is often used for this purpose , as it quickly confirms the chromosomal translocation [ t ( 15 ; 17 ) ( q22 ; 22##12 ) ; ] that characterizes apl . there is also a need to molecularly detect the presence of pml / rara fusion protein , which is the oncogenic product of that fusion . = = = world health organization = = = the who 2008 classification of chronic acute leukemia attempts to be more clinically useful and to produce more accurate prognostic information than the fab system . each of the who classifications has several different subcategories of interest to the hematopathologist and physician ; however , most of the clinically significant information in the who schema is obtained via classification into one of the subtypes listed above . the who subtypes of aml are : acute leukemias of ambiguous type ( also known as mixed type or biphenotypic acute leukemia ) occur when the leukemic cells can not be identified as either myeloid or lymphoid cells , and where both types of cells are present . = = = french @ - @ american @ - @ british = = = the french @ - @ american @ - @ british ( uk ) classification system divides aml into eight subtypes , m0 through to m7 , based on the type of cell from which the leukemia originates and its degree of severity . this is done by studying the appearance of the individual cells with light microscopy and / or by using markers to identify any possible genetic abnormalities . the subtypes have varying prognoses and resistance to therapy . although the who system ( see above ) may be very useful , the who system is not widely used . eight fab subtypes were proposed in 1976 . the morphologic subtypes of aml also include other types not included in the who system , such as acute basophilic leukemia , which was proposed as the ninth subtype , m8 , in 1999 . = = pathophysiology = = the dominant cell in aml is the myeloblast . in normal hematopoiesis , the cell is an immature form of normal white blood cells ; a single cell will eventually develop into a mature white blood cell . in aml , however , a single myeloblast accumulates genetic changes which " arrest " the cell in its immature state and prevent differentiation . such a arrest usually does not cause leukemia ; however , when such a " developmental arrest " is combined with amutations which disrupt genes controlling differentiation , the result is the uncontrolled growth of an abnormal group of cells , leading to the genetic instability of aml . much of the prevalence and severity of aml cases is because leukemic transformation can occur in a number of different steps along the differentiation pathway . modern classification schemes for aml include the characteristics and severity of the leukemic cell ( and the disease ) which depends on the point at which differentiation was halted . specific cytogenetic mutations can be found in many people with aml ; the presence of chromosomal abnormalities can have clinical significance . the gene mutations produce abnormal fusion proteins , or transcription factors whose abnormal activity may cause the " differentiation defect " . for example , in chronic promyelocytic leukemia , the t ( 15 ; 17 ) gene produces the pml @ - @ rarα fusion protein which binds to the retinoic acid response element in the promoter of several proto @ - @ specific genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation . the main signs and symptoms of aml result from the growth of leukemic stem cells , which tend to inhibit or interfere with the production of normal blood cells in the bone marrow . this leads to neutropenia , leukemia , and thrombocytopenia . the symptoms of aml are , in part , caused due to the low levels of these normal blood cells . in some cases , people with aml can develop a chloroma , a solid mass of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow , which can have different symptoms depending on its location . an important pathophysiological mechanism of leukemogenesis in aml is the epigenetic induction of cancer by genetic mutations that alter the activity of epigenetic enzymes , such as the dna demethylase tet2 and the restriction enzymes idh1 and idh2 , which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite , d @ - @ 2 @ - @ hydroxyglutarate , which increases the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as tet2 . the hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor specific genes and / or the activation of proto @ - @ genes . = = treatment = = first @ - @ the treatment of aml consists primarily of surgery , and is divided into two stages : pre and postrem##ission ( or consolidation ) therapy . the goal of induction chemotherapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an acceptable level ; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate a previously undetectable disease and achieve a cure . a stem cell transplant is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person dies , although transplantation is also sometimes used as front @ - @ line therapy for people with high @ - @ + disease . efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors for aml continue . = = = induction = = = all fab subtypes except m3 are usually given induction chemotherapy with cytarabine ( all @ - @ + ) and an anthracycline ( most commonly daunorubicin ) . this induction chemotherapy protocol is known as " 7 + 3 " ( or " 7 + 7 " ) , because the cytarabine is given as a single iv push for seven consecutive days and the anthracycline is given for seven consecutive days as an iv push . up to 90 % of people with aml will achieve a cure with this protocol . other chemotherapy induction methods , including high @ - @ dose cytarabine alone , front @ - @ like regimens or investigational agents , may also be used . because of the side effects of therapy , including myelosuppression and an increased risk of death , induction chemotherapy may not be offered to the severely elderly , and the treatment may include more aggressive treatment or supportive care . the m3 subtype of aml , also known as acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) , is almost universally treated with the combination all @ - @ trans @ - @ retinoic acid ( atra ) in addition to induction chemotherapy , and an anthracycline . care must be taken to prevent spontaneous intravascular coagulation ( dic ) , complicating the progression of apl when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the systemic circulation . apl is eminently resistant , with all @ - @ causing adverse outcomes . the goal of the induction phase is to achieve a complete remission . complete remission does not mean the disease has been cured ; rather , it means the disease can be detected with other diagnostic methods . complete remission is obtained in about 50 % – 50 % of newly diagnosed adults , although this may vary depending on the prognosticas described above . the duration of chemotherapy depends on the risk factors of the individual leukemia . in general , all treatments will fail without additional consolidation therapy . = = = consolidation = = = even if complete remission is achieved , leukemic cells will remain in numbers too small to be detected with current imaging techniques . if no additional postremission or consolidation therapy is used , almost all people with aml will eventually die . therefore , more chemotherapy is necessary to treat nondetectable disease and prevent relapse — that is , to achieve a cure . the specific type of postremission therapy is determined based on a person ' s risk factor ( described above ) and clinical characteristics . for good @ - @ prognosis leukemias ( i . e . inv ( 16 ) , t ( 18 ; 19 ) , and t ( 16 ; 17 ) ) , patients will typically receive an additional three to four weeks of intensive chemotherapy , known as consolidation therapy . for people at high risk of relapse ( e . g . those with high @ - @ risk leukemia , underlying mds , or low @ - @ risk aml ) , allogeneic stem cell transplant is only recommended if the person is able to afford a transplant and has a suitable diagnosis . the specific postremission therapy for intermediate @ - @ risk aml ( normal genetic or genetic diseases not falling into good @ - @ risk or high @ - @ risk categories ) is less clear and depends on the specific situation , including the age and overall health of the person , the patient ' s diagnosis , and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available . for people who are not eligible for a stem cell transplant , immunotherapy with a combination of histamine dihydrochloride ( ceplene ) and interleukin 1 ( proleukin ) after the administration of consolidation has been shown to reduce the absolute cancer risk by 50 % , leading to a 50 % reduction in the likelihood of complete remission . = = = = aml = = = for people with relapsed aml , the only proven and effective treatment is a human stem cell transplant , if this has not yet been achieved . in 2000 , the monoclonal , @ - @ risk chemotherapy drug gemtuzumab ozogamicin ( mylot##arg ) was approved in the united states for people aged less than 60 years with acute aml who are not candidates for treatment @ - @ intensity chemotherapy . this drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer , pfizer in 2010 . since treatment options for acute aml are so limited , palliative treatment or enrolment in a clinical trial may be necessary . for acute acute promyelocytic leukemia ( apl ) , arsenic therapy is approved by the us fda . like atra , arsenic trioxide does not work with other subtypes of aml . = = prognosis = = = = leukemia is a rare disease ; the rate of survival for a specific person depends on a number of different factors . = = = = = = = the single most important genetic marker in aml is cytogenetics , or the genetic makeup of the leukemic cell . some cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes ( for example , the ( 16 ; 20 ) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia ) . about half of people with aml have " normal " cytogenetics ; they fall into an intermediate risk group . a number of other genetic abnormalities are known to occur with a poor prognosis and a high risk of death after treatment . the first study to address cytogenetics and prognosis was the mrc study of 1998 : subsequently , the southwest research group and eastern european oncology group and , later on , leukemia and leukemia research have published other , more detailed lists of cytogenetics findings for patients . = = = myelodysplastic syndrome = = = aml which arises from a pre @ - @ called myelodysplastic syndrome ( ms ) or myeloproliferative syndrome ( treatment @ - @ called acute aml ) has a poor prognosis , as does treatment @ - @ related aml resulting from treatment for the underlying cancer . both of these entities are associated with a higher rate of unfavorable cytogenetic changes . = = = other genetic markers = = = in some studies , age > 60 years and elevated blood dehydrogenase level were also associated with poor outcomes . as with other forms of cancer , performance status ( i . e . the overall physical condition andactivity level of the gene ) plays a significant role in prognosis as well . = = = = = = = = = a large number of additional genes are under consideration for their clinical impact on aml . currently , only flt3 @ - @ itd , npm1 , cebpa and c @ - @ kit are not included in the international risk stratification recommendations . these are expected to increase significantly in the near future . flt3 internal promoter duplications ( itds ) have been shown to confer a good prognosis in aml with normal cytogenetics . several flt3 inhibitors have undergone clinical trials , with mixed results . two other mutations - npm1 and biallelic cebpa are associated with improved outcomes , especially in people with normal cytogenetics and are used in current risk assessment studies . researchers are studying the clinical impact of c @ - @ kit mutations in aml . these are prevalent , and potentially more significant because of the availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors , such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c @ - @ kit pharmacologically . it is expected that additional genes ( e . g . , runx1 , asxl1 , and tp53 ) that have previously been associated with an inferior outcome will also be included in these recommendations . the clinical impact of these additional genes ( e . g . , dnmt3a , idh1 , idh2 ) is not clear . = = = expectation of outcome = = = cure rates in clinical trials have ranged from < – 45 % ; although clinical trials may include only elderly patients and those able to tolerate aggressive therapy . the overall cure rate for all people with aml ( including the elderly and those able to tolerate conventional therapy ) is likely lower . cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia may be as high as 98 % . = = epidemiology = = acute acute leukemia is a relatively rare disease . there are about 2 @ , @ 500 new cases each year in the united states , and the cure rate has been stable from 1995 to 2005 . aml accounts for 1 @ . @ 2 % of all cancer deaths in the united states . the incidence of aml increases with age ; the median age at diagnosis is 40 years . aml accounts for about 90 % of all acute leukemias in america , and is veryin india . the rate of therapy @ - @ related aml ( that is , aml caused by previous chemotherapy ) is increasing ;

he used the term " leucocythemia " to describe this pathological condition . the term " leukemia " was coined by rudolf koch , the first german pathologist , in 1856 . as a pioneer in the use of the electron microscope in pathology , virchow was the first to describe the large excess of white blood cells in comparison with the normal syndrome described by velpeau and bennett . because he was uncertain of the etiology of the white blood cell disease , he used the more descriptive term " leukemia " ( greek : " black blood " ) to refer to the condition . further advances in the study of the human body came rapidly with the advent of new technology . in 1877 , paul ehrlich developed the technique of staining bloodand which allowed him to distinguish and detail normal and abnormal white blood cells . wilhelm ebstein introduced the term " acute leukemia " in 1889 to distinguish rapidly progressive and severe leukemias from the more indolent mild ones . the term " myeloid " was coined by franz - josef koch in 1869 , as he was the first to recognize white blood cells were made in the bone marrow ( greek : µυєλος , myelos = ( bone ) marrow ) as opposed to the spleen . the technique of bone marrow examination to diagnose leukemia was first described in 1879 by mosler . finally , in 1900 , the leukemia , which is the malignant cell in aml , was characterized by otto naegeli , who divided the disease into myeloid and leukemia . in 2008 , aml became the first human genome to be completely mapped . dna extracted from leukemic cells was transferred to unaffected skin . the leukemic cells contained genetic mutations in several genes that had not previously been associated with the disease . = = = = = leukemia is rarely associated with childbirth , affecting only about 1 in 100 @ , @ 000 pregnant women . how it is diagnosed depends primarily on the type of leukemia . acute leukemias normally require prompt , effective treatment , despite significant risk of pregnancy complications and birth defects , especially if chemotherapy is used during the developmentally delayed first year .
