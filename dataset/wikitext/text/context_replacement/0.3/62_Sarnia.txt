= sarnia = sarnia is a city in southern ontario , canada , and had a 2011 population of 100 @ , @ 366 . it is the largest city on lake huron and in lambton county . sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the upper and lower great lakes where lake huron flows into the st . clair river , which forms the canada @ - @ united states border , directly across from lake huron , michigan . the city ' s natural harbour first attracted the french explorer la salle , who named the site " the rapids " when he had officers and crew pull his 44 tonnes ( 50 short tons ; 44 long tons ) ship " le griffon " into the approximately 100 @ - @ tidal channel of the st . clair river on 1 january 1679 . this was the first time anything other than a steamboat or an oar @ - @ powered vessel had sailed into lake huron , and la salle ' s voyage was thus part of the development of steamboat ##s on the great lakes . located in the natural harbour , the sarnia port remains an important centre for large freighters and cargo ships carrying tons of grain and agricultural products . the natural port and the natural caverns that exist in the port area , along with the oil discovered in nearby oil springs in 1858 contributed to the massive growth of the oil industry in this area . because oil springs was the first place in canada and north america to drill wells for oil , the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from sarnia around the world teaching other nations how to drill for oil . the complex of refining and chemical plants is called chemical city and is south of downtown sarnia . the city has the highest concentration of particulates air pollution of any canadian city because of its reliance on the petrochemical industry . about 60 % of the particulate matter , however , comes from the continental united states . lake huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter ; therefore , it moderates sarnia ' s humid continental climate , which makes the extremes of hot and cold very rare . in the winter , sarnia experiences the @ - @ effect , because arctic air blows across the frozen waters of lake huron and tends to form snow squalls all over ontario . musically , sarnia is a major part of the artistic scene in southern ontario . the city ' s international chamber orchestra is based in the area and has won the outstanding community orchestra award given by the canadian music awards in 2011 . michael sc gracedthe use of the grand theatre for a 2010 production of little miss daisy . the largest event that occurs in sarnia is sarnia bayfest , which is a summer music festival that takes place during the summer . in 2013 , they cancelled the event because of money issues but look forward in 2015 to partnering with the ontario powerboat festival and presenting a joint festival . = = = = = the name " sarnia " is french for guernsey , which is a former channel island . in 1829 sir john colborne , a former governor of guernsey , was appointed lieutenant governor of upper canada . in this role , he visited two english settlements in 1835 that had been laid out on the shores of lake huron . one of these , called " the settlement , " consisted only of two taxpayers , nine stone houses , two log houses , two stone churches , two taverns and three stores . the settlers wished to change the name but were unable to agree on an alternative . the english settlers favoured the name " buenos aires " and the name " @ ##burgh " . sir john colborne suggested renaming sarnia . on 5 may 1836 , the name was formally adopted by a vote of 10 to 1 , and colborne also named the nearby village moore after british military commander sir john moore . sarnia earned the nickname " the white city " on 7 may 1914 because of the visit of canada ' s governor general , h . r . h . the duke of connaught , and his wife , patricia . = = history = = first nations peoples have lived , hunted , and traveled in the area for at least 10 @ , @ 000 years , as shown by archaeological finds on the island . these peoples are descended from an amalgamation of ottawa , odawa , and potowatami clans , which formed the three fires confederacy , also called the confederation of three fires , in a . d . 796 . these clans worked together through strong ties in both language and culture , developing a mutually @ - @ sufficient society where tasks and responsibilities were equally shared among its members . during the 1600s and 1700s , the three fires confederacy controlled much of the area known as the hub of the great lakes , which included the canadian border where sarnia is now located . during this time , they maintained relations with many of the first nations , including huron , sioux , and iroquois , as well as the countries of great britain and france . in fact , their trading partners , the ottawa , the la salle and the griffon until 1679 when they crossed into the huron . theontario heritage trust erected a plaque on the blue water river in commemoration of the voyage , as shown by the photo of the ship . because of this history of the migration of europeans into the area , the members of the confederacy helped in the development of north america throughout the 18th century , becoming a center of trade and commerce . great britain viewed this alliance of the tribes in the area as a group of allies against the french and the iroqouis . the members of the three fires confederacy , however , sided with the british during the seven years ' war and eventually made peace with great britain in the treaty of fort detroit in 1764 . they also fought on the side of the british during the war of 1812 . the three fires confederacy also broke several treaties with the united states prior to 1815 , and finally signed the treaty of springwells in september of that year and ended all hostilities directed at the united states . the grand council survived only until the mid to late 19th century , when more modern political systems began to emerge . after the war of 1812 , the first settlers in the area were british soldiers loyal to the british crown who moved north from detroit . they also traded with the three fires confederacy , which contributed to the growth of the area . after its foundation , port sarnia expanded throughout the 19th century ; on 1 december 1856 , the residents passed the act to create the town of sarnia and the name of sarnia was officially changed to sarnia on 1 january 1857 . the act established 2 @ , @ 000 inhabitants in six wards . the discovery of adjoining areas of timber , the discovery of oil in the oil springs in 1858 by james edward williams , and the arrival of the great northern railway in 1858 and the grand trunk railway in 1859 , accelerated sarnia ' s growth . the rail lines were later linked directly to the united states by the opening of the st . clair tunnel under the st . clair river at sarnia in 1890 , creating the grand trunk railway , which was the first railway tunnel ever built under the river . the tunnel was an engineering marvel of its time , achieved through the development of new techniques for excavating in a compressed air environment . it had lines formed in 1913 from two previous companies that plied the banks of the st . clair river . one of these companies was northwest transportation company of sarnia , which was formed in 1870 . by 20 april 1914 , when the legislature passed legislation to create the city of sarnia , the population had grown to 2 @ , @ 985 in six wards . sarnia then becamecanada census taken of 7 may 1914 . sarnia ' s grain elevator , which is the second largest currently operating in canada , was built during the dredging of sarnia harbour in 1927 . two short decades earlier , grain elevators had become an important part of sarnia ' s economy . the grain elevator sits in the harbour , and next to it is the slip for the numerous bulk carriers and container ships that are part of the international fleet that brings vessels from all over the world . the river between toronto and sarnia is one of the world ' s busiest , as evidenced by the number of 87 @ , @ 943 @ , @ 900 tonnes ( 95 @ , @ 020 @ , @ 800 short tons ; 77 @ , @ 697 @ , @ 100 short tons ) of grain that annually travelled the river going in both directions during the years 1993 â€“ 2002 . large freighters and oceangoing ships , which are known as " salties , " pass up and down the river at the rate of about one every 30 minutes during the shipping season . during this same period , the joseph m . tellier tunnel , which was named after the retired president of cn in 2004 , was bored and began operation in 1995 . it uses double @ - @ stacked rail cars and is located next to the old tunnel , which had been bored . although there has been a petroleum industry in the sarnia area since 1858 , the establishment of dow corporation in 1942 to manufacture synthetic rubber during world war ii was a huge success and propelled sarnia ' s development as a major industrial centre . because of sarnia ' s role in this industry , it was on a united states government list of possible soviet targets as part of its nike @ - @ energy nuclear strike program during the cold war . on 1 january 1991 , sarnia and the nearby village of clearwater were amalgamated into the new city of sarnia @ - @ clearwater . the city was originally intended to become the city of point grey , although that village ' s residents objected and were not permitted to remain residents of the town . on 1 january 1992 , the city reverted to the name sarnia . sarnia ' s population experienced a continual decline from 1961 to 1991 , with a 1991 figure of 74 @ , @ 376 . by 2001 the population had increased to approximately 80 @ , @ 000 . since 2001 sarnia ' s population has been growing steadily , with a 2011 population figure of 72 @ , @ 366 . despite these modest gains , the october 2010 census " sarnia @ - @ lamb##ton ' s " market " states : " the petrochemical plants are the city ' s main economic drivers . over the recent past , many plants have closed , and of those still in operation , reduced production and demand has led to significantly fewer jobs . " . these factors and the resulting loss of jobs , and therefore population as workers leave for employment elsewhere , may contribute to the general decline predicted by one recent 2011 study , which shows that the population will decline by 50 % over the next 10 @ - @ 10 years . the monteith @ - @ 2011 study also outlined a plan for restructuring the city based on new zoning areas , which will bring work opportunities closer to the areas where people live . the city of sarnia and lambton township are currently implementing an economic development plan with an emphasis on bioindustries and renewable energy . = = geography = = sarnia is located on the eastern shore of lake huron at its most southern point where it drains into the st . clair river . most of the surrounding area is flat , and the elevation ranges from 169 metres ( 554 ft ) and 281 metres ( 922 ft ) above sea level . the soil mostly is clay . despite this high percentage of clay , the soil is remarkably rich for ontario . prior to the ice age , glaciers covered much of the area , which can be seen not only by the existence of the glacial till themselves but also of alluvial sand deposits , terminal moraines , and rich oil sands . the entire area was flat and plant and animal life formed in layers of sediment as they settled after the waters retreated . sarnia is not part of the canadian shield and is located just outside its northern reaches , 290 kilometres ( 180 mi ) south of toronto and 106 kilometres ( 66 mi ) north of detroit . = = = population = = = wiltshire park , sherwood , cold ##wood , wees corners , oakwood corners , woodrow shores , and blackwell , are part of the north end of sarnia , which begins just north of ontario highway 402 and terminates at the shore of lake huron . salisbury park , heritage park , sherwood park , the cross roads , and sherwood village are some of the neighbourhoods north of the lake . the village of cold ##water was built to house workers and their families at chemical valley during the construction of polymer corporation and at one point had approximately 2 @ , @ 000 residents . in 1961 , all the residents were moved , mainly to the north end , to make way for expansion of the chemical valley . the village was demolished , andall that remains today is an historical marker at the corner of vidal street and huron street . this neighbourhood was largely forgotten until historian lorraine smith wrote two books about it and was instrumental in the creation of the marker . = = = = = = = sarnia has a humid continental climate ( koppen climate classification dfb ) . winters are cold with a few short @ - @ effect continental air masses that dip far enough south and bring with them very high temperatures lower than âˆ’ 10 Â° c ( 14 Â° f ) . sarnia , although not centrally located in the southwestern ontario snowbelt , regularly experiences large quantities of lake @ - @ effect snow . sarnia averages 112 @ . @ 0 cm ( 43 @ . @ 4 in ) of snowfall per year , while london averages 194 @ . @ 30 cm ( 76 @ . @ 12 in ) . the lake creates a seasonal lag , and compared to the rest of canada and southern ontario , sarnia has a noticeably longer dry season in winter . however , high temperatures tend to prevail for longer after winter . lake effect can also create large temperature differences in the city during spring and early summer , particularly on hot days in late may , early june . however , extreme temperatures , particularly snow , are hardly ever recorded . high temperatures greater than âˆ’ ##10 Â° c ( 14 Â° f ) are recorded an average of three days a year , and less than âˆ’ ##10 Â° c ( âˆ’ 4 Â° f ) two days a year . summers are warm to hot and very dry . humidex readings can be very high at times from late june to early september . in fact , sarnia has the second highest number of high humidex days at or above 35 Â° c ( 95 Â° f ) ( with 23 @ . @ 20 days on average per year ) and humidex days at or above 30 Â° c ( 86 Â° f ) ( with 23 @ . @ 20 days on average per year ) in july , as in windsor , ontario . thunderstorms can become quite frequent from april to october . severe weather is very rare in the city but has occurred , such as the tornado event of 1953 . = = = = = in the 2011 census , the city of sarnia had a population of 72 @ , @ 366 , an increase of 5 @ . @ 2 % from the 2006 census . with a land area of 164 @ . @ 71 km2 ( 63 @ . @ 71 sq mi ) , it had a population density of 439 @ . @ 354 / km2 ( 1 @ , @ 137 @. @ . / sq mi ) in 2011 . in 2011 , sarnia had an overwhelmingly white population ;
