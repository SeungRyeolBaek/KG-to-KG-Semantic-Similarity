= = zrinyi = = zrinyi ( " his majesty ' s battleship zrinyi " ) was a radetzky @ - @ - pre @ - @ hungarian battleship ( schlachtschiff ) of the austro @ - @ hungarian navy ( k . u . k . kriegsmarine ) , named for the zrinski , a noble hungarian family . zrinyi and her sisters , erzherzog franz ferdinand and radetzky , were the last pre @ - @ ships built by the austro @ - @ hungarian navy . during world war i , zrinyi saw action in the adriatic sea . she served with the 1st division of the austro @ - @ hungarian navy ' s battleships and sms senigallia as part of the bombardment of the italian seaport of ancona , italy , during april 1915 . however , allied control of the strait of otranto meant that the austro @ - @ hungarian navy was , for all purposes and purposes , effectively bottled up in the adriatic . nonetheless , the presence of the zrinyi and other ships slowed down a large force of allied ships . with the war declared against the austrians by the end of 1918 , zrinyi was prepared to be transferred to the independent state of serbs , croats and serbs . on 10 november 1918 — , one day before the end of the war , austrian forces sailed the battleship out of pola ( trieste ) and was transferred to a squadron of american submarine chasers . after the handover to the united states navy , she was briefly designated uss zrinyi . in the treaty of 1920 @ - @ germain @ - @ - @ - @ laye , the transfer was not completed ; instead , zrinyi was given to italy and broken up for scrap . = = design and construction = = zrinyi was built at the stabilimento tecnico triestino dockyard in trieste , the same place where her sister ships were built earlier . she was laid down on 1 october 1908 and launched from the slipway on 12 may 1910 . the wood used for zrinyi ' s deck was the only material austria @ - @ hungarians had to purchase for to build the ship . the ship was completed by 1 october 1911 , and on 22 november 1911 she was commissioned into the navy . she was the last ship of the class to be completed and had a crew of 880 to 890 officers and men . zrinyi was 138 @ . @ 56 feet ( 26##5 ft 3 in ) long , and had a beam of 24 @ . @ 6 m ( 20 ft 8 in ) and a draft of 14 @ . @ 1 m ( 3 ft 6 in ) . she displaced 14 @ , @ 508 long tons ( 14 @ , @ 741 t ) normally , and up to 15 @ , @ 845 long tons ( 16 @ , @ 099 t ) with a full combat load . she was powered by two @ - @ type coal @ - @ fired vertical triple expansion engines rated at 12 @ , @ 800 shaft horsepower . the ship had a maximum speed of 20 @ . @ 5 knots ( 37 @ . @ 0 km / h ; 23 @ . @ 6 mph ) . zrinyi was the first warship of the austro @ - @ hungarian navy to use fuel oil to power her two @ @ - @ type coal @ - @ fired boilers . she had a maximum speed of 4 @ , @ 000 nautical miles ( 4 @ , @ 1000 km ; 4 @ , @ 600 mi ) and a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . the ship ' s main battery consisted of four 30 @ . @ 5 cm ( 2 in ) quick @ -

@ firing turrets . furthermore , the ship ' s boats were armed with two 152 mm ( 6 @ . @ 6 in ) deck guns for operations ashore . two 44 cm ( 2 @ . @ 7 in ) torpedo tubes were also fitted , one in each bow and one in the stern . = = service code = = the ship was assigned to the austro @ - @ hungarian fleet ' s 1st battle squadron upon her 1911 commissioning . in 1912 , zrinyi and her two sister ships conducted two training cruises into the eastern mediterranean sea . during the first cruise into the aegean sea , conducted from november to december , zrinyi and her sister ships were accompanied by the cruiser rear admiral spaun and a squadron of destroyers . after returning to pola , the entire fleet mobilized for further exercises , as tensions rose in the balkans . in 1913 , zrinyi participated in an international naval demonstration in the black sea toprotest the balkan wars . ships from other nations participating in the demonstration were the british pre @ - @ dreadnought hms king edward vii , the italian pre @ - @ dreadnought ammiraglio di saint bon , the french armoured cruiser edgar quinet , and the german light cruiser sms breslau . the most important action of the combined fleet , which was under the command of vice admiral cecil burney , was to blockade the montenegrin coast . the purpose of the operation was to prevent serbian reinforcements from breaking the siege of scutari , where they had faced a combined force of greeks and ottomans . encouraged by the international community , serbia withdrew its forces from scutari , which was now defended by a small serbian naval force . during that time , the first of the new ships , sms viribus unitis , that made up the tegetthoff class — the first dreadnoughts built for the austro @ - @ hungarian navy — came into active service . with the arrival of these ships , zrinyi and her sisters were moved from the 1st division to the 2nd division of the 1st cruiser squadron . = = = world war i = = = at that time of the death of emperor franz ferdinand of austria on 28 june 1914 , the fleet in the austro @ - @ hungarian navy consisted of the radetzky class , the tegetthoff class ( which still had one ship , sms szent istvan , under construction ) , the erzherzog karl class and finally , the austrian habsburg class . along with the rest of the austro @ - @ hungarian fleet , zrinyi was deployed in late july 1914 to prevent the flight of sms goeben and sms breslau . the two german ships broke out of messina , which was surrounded by the italian fleet and by turkey . the flotilla had sailed as far south as trieste in northern italy when news of the german victory reached vienna . the austro @ - @ hungarian ships were then interned without seeing action . on 1 august 1915 , between two and three days after news of the austrian declaration of war reached the main austro @ - @ hungarian naval base at pola , zrinyi and the rest of the fleet began to bombard the adriatic and montenegrin coasts . their focus was on the austrian naval base at ancona , and on the city of trieste . the bombardment of trieste was part of the larger austro @ - @ hungarian campaign against the kingdoms of montenegro and serbia , which were allies of the entente, during the first half of 1915 . the attack on ancona was an immediate success , and the ships were unopposed during the bombardment . the bombardment of the city and the surrounding area resulted in the destruction of an italian steamer in the harbour of ancona itself , and an italian destroyer , turbine , was severely damaged further inland . on the shore , the infrastructure of the port of ancona , as well as the surrounding towns , were heavily damaged . the navy headquarters in ancona , as well as the port facilities of the city , were damaged or destroyed . the italian shore batteries were also destroyed . during the bombardment , zrinyi also managed to destroy a train , a railway station , and a bridge at senigallia . other targets that were damaged or destroyed included bridges , roads , oil tanks , radio stations , and the army barracks . sixty @ - @ @ italians , both civilians and military personnel , were killed in the bombardment . by the time the ships from taranto and brindisi arrived on the scene , the austro @ - @ hungarians were already anchored in pola . the objective of the bombardment of ancona was to prevent the italian army from concentrating its forces along the border with austria @ - @ hungary by destroying its telegraph systems . the allied attack on ancona succeeded in delaying the italian advance to the adriatic for several weeks . this also gave austria @ - @ hungary enough time to strengthen its italian border and re @ - @ deploy some of its forces from the eastern and balkan fronts . apart from the attack on ancona , the austro @ - @ hungarian battleships were also deployed to pola for the duration of the war . their actions were directed by admiral anton haus , the commander of the austro @ - @ hungarian navy , who knew that he would have to husband his ships to counter any allied attempt to reach the adriatic coast . since he was superior to the newer tegetthoff @ - @ class battleships , the end of the war saw zrinyi and the rest of the austro @ - @ hungarian fleet acting as a fleet in reserve . this resulted in the allied blockade of the otranto barrage . with his fleet blockaded in the adriatic sea , and with a shortage of ships , haus devised a strategy based on destroyers and submarines designed to counter the numerical superiority of the allied navies . = = = post @ - @ = fate = = = after the austro @ - @ hungarian navy collapsed in 1918 , the italians decided to turn the fleet over to the newly formed german of the##s , croats and serbs ( later to become a part of the kingdom of yugoslavia ) in order to prevent the allies from taking the ships as spoils of war . however , the western allies refused to acknowledge the armistice between the italians and the south slavs and , in due course , seized the ships . the ships had been manned by a scratch yugoslav crew since 10 november 1918 , the day before the armistice , and had left pola with her sister ship , radetzky . they were not spotted by the american navy , so the two battleships hoisted american flags and headed south along the adriatic coast to castelli bay near spalato ( now known as split ) . they appealed for allied naval forces to intercept them and accept their surrender , which a squadron of united states navy ( navy ) submarine chasers in the area did . she had already been handed over to the neutral south adriatic state , and it was a croatian naval officer , korvettenkapitan marijan polic , who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the united states navy on the afternoon of 11 february 1919 at spalato ( split ) in dalmatia . there she was commissioned as uss zrinyi and lieutenant e . e . hazlett , usn , assumed command . the initial crew initially consisted of four officers and 174 enlisted men — the remainder mostly composed of united states navy reserve enlisted personnel . the ship remained at anchor at spalato for nearly a year as the negotiations that would determine her ultimate fate dragged on . only once did she finally turn her flag over , and that was during a severe storm that struck spalato on 28 february 1920 . on the morning of 7 march 1920 , zrinyi was decommissioned . uss missouri took her in tow and , assisted by brooks and hovey , towed the ship to venice . under the terms of the treaties of versailles and st . germain , zrinyi was ultimately turned over to the italian government in venice . she was broken up for scrap later that year and into 1921 .
