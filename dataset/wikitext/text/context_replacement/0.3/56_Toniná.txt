= tonina = tonina ( or tonina in spanish spelling ) is a pre @ - @ period archaeological site and ruined city of the maya civilization located in what is now the mexican state of chiapas , some 13 kilometres ( 8 @ . @ 1 mi ) west of the town of ocosingo . the site is medium to large , with hundreds of in @ - @ structures built on terraces rising some 71 metres ( 233 ft ) above a plaza , a ball court for playing the mesoamerican ballgame , and over 300 carved monuments , most dating from the 6th century to the 9th century ad , during the classic period . tonina is distinguished by its well preserved stucco sculptures and also by its in @ - @ the @ - @ style carved monuments , produced to an extent not seen in mesoamerica since the collapse of the much earlier maya civilization . tonina was an important city during the pre classic , using warfare to create a powerful empire . for much of its history , tonina was involved in sporadic warfare with palenque , its greatest rival and one of the most powerful cities in the north of the maya peninsula , although tonina eventually became the dominant city in the west . the city is notable for having the oldest known surviving stone monument of any maya site , from the end of the classic maya period in ad 909 . = = etymology = = tonina means house of time in the tzeltal language of the ancient maya civilization , an alternate interpretation is the place where stone monuments are made to commemorate events . however , this is the correct name and the original name was either po or popo , appearing in classic maya texts under the name used for the lord of tonina , k ' uhul po ' ajaw ( the lord of po ) . a maya rebellion in colonial mexico , in 1558 , featured a group called the k ' winikob ' ( people of po ) . early versions of the tonina emblem glyph bore a double sound , and the term popo is also found in maya records . since these sounds were often used in hieroglyphic texts , popo may represent the original name of the city . = = etymology = = tonina is located at an altitude of 800 to 900 metres ( 3 @ , @ 600 to 3 @ , @ 000 ft ) above mean sea level in the chiapas region of central mexico , about 40 miles ( 64 km ) southeast of the contemporary maya city of palenque ,tonina ' s chief ruled throughout its recorded history . tonina is separated from palenque by mountainous terrain and the site core is located on an easily accessible ascending mountain ridge immediately to the west of a natural flow of the rio jatate , one of the two rivers forming the ocosingo valley . = = rulers = = rulers of tonina recorded in the maya texts on tonina site include : the first officially recorded date at the site is featured on monument 1 as 1 may 909 ce . = = = = = = = = early classic = = = tonina had a very active early classic presence , although the early classic monuments lie entirely buried under later structures . due to this , historical texts are scarce and few offer a glimpse of the early history of the site . an 8th @ - @ century monument refers to a ruler crowned in ad 217 , although it only mentions his title , not his name . ruler 2 is depicted on a couple of late classic monuments , the best preserved of which is an inscription that dates to 514 . a king known as jaguar - man is depicted on a 7th @ - @ century stela , which describes him acceding to the throne in 568 . the first mention of tonina in a document from a foreign source is from the site of chinikiha , located 72 kilometres ( 45 mi ) to the south on the usumacinta river , the text is from a throne and describes the arrival of a person from tonina in 573 . = = = late classic = = = = = = = k ' inich hix chapat = = = = tonina ' s history comes into focus during the late classic , when the historical record is more clearly represented in hieroglyphic texts . in 633 k ' inich hix chapat is recorded as installing two new lords but little else is known of his reign , although he was probably crowned in 595 . the last mention of k ' inich hix chapat is in a monument dated to 665 that appears to be a standing stone . = = = = ruler 2 = = = = ruler 1 acceded to the throne of tonina in 668 . his reign is marked by murals and the frequent depiction of naked captives on his monuments . ruler 3 introduced the use of in @ - @ the @ - @ style art forms that came to dominate the stelae of tonina . a monument dated to 682 depicts two naked captives withtheir arms crossed , one of them is identified as a man from annak ' , an as yet unknown site . his reign may have ended with his defeat and capture by k ' inich kan balam ii of palenque in ad 687 , as recorded in a glyphic text from temple 3 in the capital city , an event that probably culminated in his sacrifice . = = = = k ' inich b ' aaknal chaak = = = = k ' inich b ' aaknal chaak was born in 688 , twenty years after ruler 4 , and reigned for ten @ - @ @ years . during his reign he restored tonina ' s power with a series of military victories over palenque , and his reign was dominated by the struggle against the rival city for political power . ballcourt 1 , the larger of tonina ' s two ballcourts , was built in 699 to commemorate three victories over the city ' s ten @ - @ rival . the ballcourt also contains two sculptures of captured captives , probably those of the previous palenque king from the usumacinta region . the date of the king ' s death is unknown . = = = = ruler 4 = = = = ruler 4 came to power in 708 at a very young age . ten years later , in 711 , while ruler 4 was still a child , tonina gained an important victory over palenque . the battle resulted in the capture of kan kan chitam ii of palenque and made tonina the dominant power in the lower usumacinta region . the victory was so important that it resulted in a ten @ - @ year gap in the dynastic history of the rival city , during which the captured ruler may have been a hostage . ruler 4 remained in power to celebrate the peaceful years of 716 and 721 . a statue found on one of his monuments is identified as being from the distant city of calakmul , one of the two rival " superpowers " . = = = = k ' inich ich ' aak chapat = = = = ruler 4 was killed by k ' inich ich ' aak chapat in 723 . in 725 tonina fought a battle against piedras negras , a city on the north bank of the usumacinta river , now in guatemala . a number of events during his reign were recorded by monuments between 726 and 729 and in 730 he rededicatedthe tomb of his predecessor k ' inich b ' aaknal chaak . the wife of k ' inich ich ' aak chapat is named as lady winik timan k ' awiil and his father may well have been k ' inich b ' aaknal chaak himself . the reign of k ' inich ich ' aak chapat is notable for the absence of the relief sculptures of the female prisoners , although the reason for this is unknown . = = = = later = = = = = little is known of the next two rulers , ruler 6 is named as k ' inich tuun chapat , who celebrated the year end of 736 and may have died 762 . a damaged inscription with the image of a bound captive indicates renewed warfare with palenque during his reign , however the identity of the captive is unknown and it is unclear if it was the current ruler of palenque or just one of his vassals . he was succeeded by ruler 7 , of whom even less is known . in 764 tonina defeated palenque in battle . in 775 a chronicle recorded the death of lord wak chan k ' i ' , a man who appears to have been the heir to the throne and who died before he could take it . ruler 8 was the last of the great warrior kings of tonina . he won a number of victories between 789 and 806 , including the battle of pomoy in 789 , and the death of the ruler ucha ' an aj chih , who appears to have been the son of b ' olon k ' awiil of calakmul . in 799 he rededicated the tomb of ruler 1 . ruler 8 oversaw an extensive remodelling of the upper levels of the acropolis . ruler 8 erected a number of statues of female prisoners of war and adopted the title aj b ' olon k ' aak , " he of many captives " . however , the full extent of tonina ' s power is known from its control over the city of sak tz ' i ' ( white dog ) , an important city in the lacandon region , an area which had previously been controlled by tonina . by the time of ruler 8 ' s successor , uh chapat , tonina was clearly in decline . only a single event , in 837 , can be dated to his reign , although a stucco mural depicting prisoners with garrottes around their necks is belong tohis period of occupation . the history of tonina continued after the other major maya cities had fallen , perhaps aided by the site ' s relative isolation . structure 1 is associated with a monument dating to 904 during the terminal classic and a monument dating to 909 is the earliest known long count date although the tomb of the king has not survived . ceramic fragments indicate that occupation at the site continued for a millennium or more . = = = modern era = = = the first published description of the site was made by francisco jacinto garrido at the end of the 17th century . a number of expeditions studied the ruins of tonina in the 19th century , the first being an expedition led by guillaume dupaix in 1808 . john henry stephens and frederick catherwood visited in 1840 , and stephens wrote an extensive description of the site . eduard seler and caecilie seler @ - @ sachs investigated the monuments at tonina , publishing their reports at the beginning of the 20th century . karl sapper excavated the site in 1895 and 1896 . frans blom and oliver la farge excavated the site in 1920s for tulane university , publishing their reports in 1926 â€” 1927 . the french tonina institute began excavations in 1972 which continued through 1975 , then resumed from 1979 to 1980 , under the direction of jean becquelin and claude baudez . the national institute of anthropology and history of mexico ( inah , the instituto nacional de antropologia e historia ) began their own excavations at tonina the same year . the site is accessible for tours and has a small museum that was inaugurated on 15 may 2000 . = = site description = = the city was built on a platform covering 6 hectares ( 650 @ , @ 000 sq ft ) . the principal entrance is located on the acropolis , which has seven north @ - @ angle terraces on the north side of the plaza , rising 72 metres ( 233 ft ) above the plaza below . it has a more distinct plan than most other maya sites , with a north @ - @ angle terrace between the terraces . much of the public imagery of the site details the ruthless manner in which the city dealt with its enemies . a 16 by 4 metres ( 52 by 13 ft ) relief sculpture rising from the third to fourth terraces depicts a skeletal war god holding the severed head of a king of palenque in his hands . a frieze on the fifth terrace once displayed tonina ' s most distinguished warriors , fragments of fragments of this frieze were discovered in the plaza below . this fr##ieze was carved from the same stone . its style resembles that of palenque , suggesting that local artisans carried out the carving . after the destruction of the city at the end of the classic period , many of the statues fell down the stone steps between the two temples . = = = = = = = ballcourt 1 ( the first ballcourt ) was built in 699 by k ' inich k ' aaknal chaak to commemorate his victories over k ' inich kan balam i of palenque . two of the statues of six royal subjects of the palenque king were used as ballcourt markers . one of these vassals is identified as yax ahk ( the turtle ) , who was the lord of annay i ' , a site that once lay on the south bank of the usumacinta between piedras negras and yaxchilan . ballcourt 2 is the smaller of the two ballcourts and located in the center of the city , at the foot of the hill . the temple of the underworld is entered via two step @ - @ vaulted chambers on the west side of the third terrace of the acropolis . the palace of frets is located on the fourth terrace of the temple . the front facade of the palace is decorated with four large stone columns . on the east side of the palace a stairway leads to a circular throne of stone and wood . one of the walls of the palace has a mural decoration of two serpents and animal heads . = = = monuments and structures = = = the monuments of tonina tend to be smaller than those at other maya sites , with most of the monuments measuring less than 2 metres ( + @ . @ 6 ft ) high . the most notable difference from monuments at other maya sites is that they are carved in the round like cylinders , often with hieroglyphic text running down the spine . on the fourth terrace , in @ - @ the @ - @ dimensional figures of tonina ' s rulers replace the @ - @ dimensional representation of defeated rulers . the dated monuments at tonina span the period from ad 495 to 909 , including most of the classic period . monument 3 was broken into various fragments , many of which were recovered from various sites in ocosingo and tonina through the course of the 20th century and some of which were reunited at the tonina archaeological museum . aside from being damaged , the stela is nearly complete and only slightly eroded , as is a fragment of aruler with text describing the death of k ' inich baaknal chaak and the succession to the priesthood of aj ch ' aaj naah . monument 5 was stolen from a temple in ocosingo and moved to the plaza north of tonina . it is a badly eroded life @ - @ preserved human statue with the head missing . monument 6 is carved from yellow sandstone and has suffered only minor damage . it is a limestone base with well @ - @ preserved hieroglyphs on all four vertical sides and was dedicated by k ' inich ich ' aak chapat in 728 . it is now in the museo nacional de tuxtla gutierrez . monument 8 dates to the reign of ruler 2 . it marks the classic ending of 682 and records the presentation of two female captives . monument 10 is a sculpture carved in the round , representing ruler 2 . it dates to ad 672 . monument 27 is a carved step depicting k ' awiil i ' , a lord from palenque , as an elderly prisoner , bound and lying on his back with his profile distorted in such a way as to be commented on time and again . monument 37 is an undated relief that depicts a female captive , which is rare in maya art . monument 101 is the longest long inscription known from any maya site , it marks the k ' atun ending of ad 909 . monument 106 is the most securely dated monument at the site , dating to ad 593 . it depicts ruler 1 . monument 113 shows ruler 2 participating in a military campaign . monument 114 was erected in 794 by ruler 8 . it records the death of an important noble , probably a vassal or vassal of ruler 8 ' s predecessor tuun chapat . monument 122 is a low relief sculpture marking the conquest of palenque by ruler 8 in 711 and the capture of kan joy chitam ii , who is depicted as a female captive . monument 141 is a very well preserved hieroglyphic panel carved from rough , yellow sandstone with almost the entire surface painted . it records the dedication of a ballcourt by k ' inich b ' aaknal chaak . monument 154 dates to the reign of k ' inich hix chapat and records his presentation of two dream lords in 633 . monument 158 has a very late date , around ad 904 , at the very end of the classic period . it was erected during the reign of ruler 1 . the frieze of the dream lords ( also known as thesculpture of the four suns ( symbol of the four winds ) was discovered by archaeologists during excavations in 1992 . it is a stucco sculpture located at the east end of the central plaza . it depicts a complex supernatural scene divided into sections by a feather @ - @ preserved scaffold from which hang the severed heads of sacrificial victims . among the scaffold ##s are also the wayob ( female companions ) of the maya gods . the most feather @ - @ preserved section of the sculpture depicts a young man named ##ob ' ah kimi ( " turtle foot death " ) wearing turtleshells on his feet and holding a severed head in his hands , presumably in the name of a lord from the village of maya ' . the frieze was once also painted in red , blue and white . this work has some stylistic parallels with mural painting in the great early classic metropolis of teotihuacan in the distant north of mexico . = = = the site museum = = = the site museum is located 300 metres ( 980 ft ) outside of the tonina archaeological zone . it possesses two main rooms and a main hall . the first room explains the physical form of the city and how it relates to maya mythology , while the main hall contains sculptures of the city ' s rulers . artefacts in the collection include stone sculptures , ceramics and tools made from wood , shell , stone and flint . the sculptures in the collection graphically depict the two sides of the power exercised by tonina , on the one hand with sculptures of the city ' s rulers and on the other with the prisoners of bound prisoners of war .
