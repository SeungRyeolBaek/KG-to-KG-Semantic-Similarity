" the blame on the commission was given to those who had earned their freedom by raising large amounts of money . an american business representative attached to the commission was quoted as saying , “ look , you" to date the ihrc [ project ] was never intended to serve as a tool or resource for us and haiti . it was instead intended as a way for haiti to receive multinationals ’ and other ’ international funding . ” the netherlands funded the projects , including radio555 . the dutch radio stations 3fm , radio 538 and radio 3 also operate under the name of radio555 , funded by a total of € ##100 million . professional organizations of the american construction industry and government , such as the department of homeland security and the national building institute , among others , announced that they were developing a " building toolkit " coordinated by the international institute of building science . the toolkit would provide building science principles and best practices for use by the haitian government with the goal of creating a more secure environment to prevent further loss of life . immediately after the earthquake , real medicine international began providing medical assistance , five @ - @ kind medical teams and strategic planning to help meet the medical needs of the relief workers on the island . working in close coordination with international humanitarian organizations , real medicine coordinated hundreds of local medical teams to meet the needs of the hospitals and clinics along the haitian – dominican republic border and the 5 @ - @ - @ - @ haiti , provided emergency supplies , donated supplies and equipment to local medical centers and regional hospitals , provided emergency services and equipment to local health centers , provided emergency health care , and provided local medical clinics , dental clinics and food banks to the communities involved in the relief effort . on 1 january 2011 , the catholic relief agency launched a us $ 10 million , 5 @ - @ kind relief and rehabilitation program that provided shelter , food , education , and medical care among injured service members . = = = aftermath of the earthquake = = = = = after the earthquake as much as 90 percent of the streets were empty . an estimated 22 million cubic feet ( 20 million cubic meters ) remained , making most of the streets empty , and thousands of bodies lay in the streets . the number of people in the thousands of tents and shelters since the earthquake was 1 @ . @ 1 million , and almost no permanent structures had been built . most of the houses had no electricity , running water , or sewage system , and the streets were beginning to fall apart . violence in the country was widespread , especially against women and children . from the affected areas , us $ 1 @ . @ 1 million had been raised for aid for relief efforts , but only two percent of the money had been spent . theto the cbs news , us $ 1 @ . @ 1 million had been raised for humanitarian aid and was used to pay for local schools , medical care , clothing , and food , and housing , food and housing of relief workers . by may 2010 , enough money had been raised " to buy every haitian family a home for us $ 1 @ , @ 000 . in june 2010 , cnn traveled to port @ - @ au @ - @ prince and said , " it looks like the earthquake has struck again " , and imogen smith , spokesman for the united nations office of humanitarian affairs in haiti , said that " six months from that , things may not be the same . " land ownership was a major issue for haiti because " many pre @ - @ prince properties were not officially registered . " even after the land laws fell into the cracks , land ownership was still a large and difficult issue in haiti . many residents of port @ - @ au @ - @ prince were controlled either by tonton makout – [UNK] ' s death and – wanted land for their homes or by government . in some cases land ownership was not officially registered . even if this political logjam were to be believed , the vast majority of port @ - @ au @ - @ prince residents , up to 90 % , did not own their homes before the earthquake . " haitian refugee groups called for the government to recognize the right to property as outlined in the haitian constitution , and for foreign aid to do this as well . they also tried to convince the international community to stop the wave of displacement from homes that began as early as six months after the earthquake and to put measures in place , but little was done in time . by august 2010 there were about 1 million people still living in haiti , and the humanitarian situation was described as still being in the same state , according to the apostolic delegate to haiti , archbishop michel auza . he went on to say that the situation was improving instead of deteriorating , and said that the government had promised to help people in port @ - @ au @ - @ prince and a local medical center , but reconstruction had not yet begun . in october 2010 , refugee groups described the humanitarian situation as hopeless and , saying , " the people of haiti are still living in a state of crisis , with a humanitarian situation that is deteriorating " . it was reported that family members and business owners were threatening the population and that racial , ethnic , and religious violence in and around the city was occurring . they saidthat displacement of the women and girls who had been living in poverty since the 2010 earthquake was caused , in part , because the united nations wasn ' t doing enough to help them . in addition , a cholera epidemic broke out , probably caused by the aid workers . cholera most often affects developing countries with limited access to clean water and basic sanitation . by the end of 2010 , more than 1 @ , @ 333 people died at a rate of about two deaths per day . = = = = 2011 = = = = in november 2011 , a month after the earthquake , oxfam released a report on the reality of the situation . according to the report , relief and development was at a disadvantage due to the neglect and negligence on the part of the aid agencies . the report said , " one year ago , only five percent of the rubble has been cleared and only five percent of the most basic and temporary houses have been built . house building on a large scale cannot be done until the greatest amount of rubble is cleared . the government and people must turn this most important task toward helping people return home " . michael fox , executive director of oxfam international , said " the earthquake has been handled differently by the way the international community has organized itself , where pledges have been made and they haven ' t followed through [ and ] where they come to the rescue with their own priorities and other priorities . many countries send money for temporary houses but very little money for clearing rubble and building roads " . fox said that in some cases rubble removal " means someone has [ washed ] the people ' s houses onto the ground in front of the houses " . according to a un report , " still , more than one million people are homeless , mostly in displacement camps where food , goods and shelter are still not available for them to be sustained " . amnesty international said that armed groups were experimenting with violence on men and women in the camps , worsening the condition of their own homes , families and loved ones . on the first anniversary of the earthquake , haitian @ - @ president michaelle jean , who served as the secretary general of haiti at the time of the earthquake and later as united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization ( unesco ) special representative for haiti on 11 november 2010 , expressed her frustration at the slow progress of aid efforts , placing much of the blame on the international community for ignoring relief efforts . in a joint statement haitian @ - @ authored with unesco president irina bokova , she said , " in timetoday , what counts as a humanitarian crisis is " a heavy burden on the international community . " the international development assistance program , headed by former us president bill clinton and haitian prime minister . @ - @ @ bellerive , had been set up to facilitate the flow of funds toward reconstruction projects in late 2010 , but as of january 2011 , no reconstruction projects had begun . = = = = 2012 = = = = in january 2012 , two years since the earthquake , figures released by the united nations show that of the estimated us $ 1 @ . @ 000 million allocated for reconstruction projects in 2010 and 2011 , only 10 percent has been spent . india and the philippines , which provide the largest share of relief funds , have received only 8 percent and 7 percent , respectively . russia and china are among the few donors to have not renewed their grants . the report notes that many humanitarian organizations have very large funding gaps . in 2010 and 2011 , for example , haiti received only us $ 200 million of the us $ 311 million in grants allocated to reconstruction projects , and only us $ 108 million of the us $ 315 million in grants allocated to housing projects . about 10 percent of bilateral aid for reconstruction projects has gone through haitian authorities , and less than 1 percent of bilateral aid has gone through the government of haiti . a january 2012 oxfam report found that about half a million people were homeless , mostly living under roofs and in tents . community leaders have criticized the report , saying that part of the problem is that haiti spent a large amount of money on " medical costs , family members ' salaries , donated food and damaged goods " . the miami herald reported . " a lot of relief work was done ; the money just didn ' t just get lost , " and , " a lot that wasn ' t related to work on the streets . millions were spent on ad campaigns telling people to wash their hands . telling them to wash their hands when there ' s no water or electricity is a slap in the face . " the office of peace & justice in haiti , the haiti rebuild , and the center for human rights have demanded immediate changes to reconstruction plans to ensure that critical human rights issues are addressed . their report states that , " the conditions in the displaced persons camps are terrible , especially for women and children who most likely are victims of gender ‐ based violence " . they call for greater speed of implementation of reconstruction plans , asking , " why have only 1 @ , @ 000 displaced persons camps" to last to the original goal of 100 @ , @ 000 for the next decade ? " . on 22 august 2012 , construction was delayed due to tropical storm isaac in haiti ' s west coast . isaac has caused damage and several deaths according to haitian authorities . as a result of the 2010 earthquake , more than 200 @ , @ 000 people had to live in tents and face the elements without a shelter . in september 2012 , with over 370 @ , @ 000 people living in tent camps , another major tropical storm , hurricane sandy , killed hundreds and left large parts of haiti without shelter . at the 2012 ministerial council meeting of the global forum for disaster reduction and recovery ( gfdrr ) , the haitian government discussed a " top @ - @ up " approach to disaster reduction and recovery focusing on regional cooperation and sustainable development with a panel of experts from over 50 countries . = = = = 2013 = = = = according to the international monetary fund , more than half of the 100 @ , @ 000 @ , @ 000 cubic metres ( 11 @ , @ 000 @ , @ 000 cu yd ) of debris has been removed , and 90 % of damage has been repaired . the cholera epidemic which began in august 2010 has continued . according to u . s . centers for disease control and prevention it is considered the worst outbreak of cholera since the 1994 earthquake in the democratic republic of the congo ( called rwanda at that time ) . by january 2013 , cholera had killed over 300 @ , @ 231 people and injured hundreds of thousands more . less than 1 % of people have contracted the disease . treatment of cholera still remains difficult with most care taken in makeshift hospitals with plenty of space for medical care . the united nations peace keeping force , widely believed responsible for the cholera epidemic , continues to refuse to provide aid , however , they have launched a $ 1 @ . @ 2 million campaign to combat cholera and the construction of a $ 100 million makeshift hospital in mirebalais which will house 800 patients and over 185 @ , @ 000 patients . at the time of the earthquake , a large portion - - $ 215 - — of the total budget allocated for reconstruction had been spent on infrastructure repairs , with most of it - - $ 1 @ . @ - - — allocated for bottom @ - @ up projects like tent camps , emergency shelters , and government buildings that pay a month ' s rent . a 2013 study found that of the 1 @ . @ 2 million people living in haiti before the earthquake , only 279 @ , @ 000 lived ina total of 352 camps . 70 % of the camps had no fire protection system , and 40 % lacked sanitation systems . while 25 % lacked flush toilets , this was less than the number of large cities , where 10 % lacked water . the camps were at high risk for flooding and more than a third of the camps ( 108 ) were at risk for flooding . in a 2013 report , the american red cross said that nearly all of the money raised for the project has been spent and is used for making repairs , after which people can leave camps and return to normal lives , which include building new homes , repairing roads , building a new school and hospital , and signing an agreement for a new home . = = = = 2015 = = = = in 2015 , npr and propublica investigated the amount of us $ 1 billion donated to the haitian red cross , described as " one of the most thorough investigations ever " . despite the claims of the american red cross that 4 @ , @ 000 camps had been destroyed , the investigation found that only 10 had been damaged . the investigation examined " thousands " of pages of government documents and interviewed " more than a dozen " former and current staff members , and rejected the organization ' s claims that 4 @ . @ 000 000 people had been put " back on their feet " by jean boutroue , a haitian government official , stating that this amount would be " 10 % of the total cost " , and adding that this would mean they had been a community in need . but other sources did not back up the claims , and it was reported that the project was plagued with " drastic budget cuts " , logistical problems and a language barrier . many of the red cross staff did not speak english or french . general counsel for the american red cross , david meltzer , referred the investigation to their official website , but would not comment on them . the public affairs director of the red cross confirmed npr and propublica ' s findings in an interview , and suggested that the npr investigation could be an isolated incident . the american red cross eventually turned over the relief project to the haitian red cross . = = haitian ##s = = the haiti 2010 earthquake has been covered in the book everybody in haiti , by dimitry . ##on .
