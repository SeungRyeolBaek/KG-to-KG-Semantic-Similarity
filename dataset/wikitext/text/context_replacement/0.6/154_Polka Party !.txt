" hey" for one " , and the album ' s only comedy song . overall , yankovic described the album as " not a whole lot better than " the previous albums he had recorded , calling the songs " just a little boring " . = = = = = = = on march 31 , 1986 , yankovic began recording three new comedy songs for his next album : " don ' t wear those shoes " , " one of those days " , and " dog eat dog " . although " don ' t wear those shoes " is an original composition , yankovic said that the song was influenced by the lyrics of the song . specifically , the song is a plea from the narrator to his mother , to not wear the shoes which she cannot afford . " one of those days " is a song about seeing things as if they were mere dreams . the whole thing builds up to absurd proportions as other horrible things pop up at odd moments . " dog eat dog " is a song reminiscent of the talking heads . described as an " in @ - @ - @ - @ in look at everyday life " , the song was inspired by yankovic ' s own experiences of working in the mailrooms as well as the news department at westwood one radio station . he said , " at first i thought [ the song ] was really sad that i had a phone and a computer and a little money to call my own , but after a while i felt like my life had been sucked out of me . " the song contains a line directly from the talking heads song " once in a while " : " sometimes i tell myself , this is not my beautiful house / sometimes i tell myself this is not my beautiful chair ! " this references a similar line in the talking heads song : " you may tell yourself , this is not my beautiful chair / you may tell yourself , this is not my beautiful house " . on december 13 , yankovic released " christmas at ground zero " . the song , " a sad christmas song about death , destruction and the end of the world " was the result of scotti brothers records ' request that yankovic record a christmas song . when yankovic sent the song to his label , they refused , because it was " a bit different from what they were doing . " after the song ' s release , many radio stations dropped the song , a move that yankovic attributed to " some stations [ not wanting ] to talk about nuclear war during the christmas season . "after the september 11 attacks , when the code name " ground zero " was being @ - @ used as the new name for the world trade center site where one of those attacks took place , the controversial lyrics caused this song to be banned outright from radio . yankovic wanted the song to get a release , but due to legal issues , his label did not respond . yankovic , however , recorded it himself which was mostly made up of stock footage , with a live action scene that was filmed in an economically depressed area of the bronx , new york that looked like a bomb had gone off . the first song that was used was " good enough for now " , a pop music song about how the singer ' s family , who , if not the singer , can provide for her . = = = = and = = = = on august 3 , yankovic began recording songs beginning with " dancing with a potato " . the song , a parody of " living in america " by james brown — which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1985 film rocky , — is a polka . when it came time to record a song to parody as the lead single for polka mania ! scotti brothers records " had some very funny ideas " and wanted to have yankovic parody a singer who was signed on the record label . after " living in america " became a hit , the record label requested that yankovic record the song , to which yankovic agreed . in order to accurately record the song , yankovic researched the possible causes of cancer . yankovic stated that " it was a real challenge to work with people . i ' m a very good @ - @ person , never been to any doctor in high school , but if i can find a disease , i can figure it out . " a choreographer named michael whitmore was hired to help with the dance moves used in the video , which were filmed on the same stage and featured in the film rocky iv . the first song recorded was " addicted to polka " , a pastiche of " addicted to potatoes " by robert johnson , about a man ' s love for potatoes and their @ - @ - lifestyle . a music video for the song was never attached to the album because there was a set deadline for it for the album , and yankovic felt that the song would be a practical joke and not even worth his own time . a clip of brown ' s performance , however , was later incorporated into brown ' s " party " video . on august 5, yankovic recorded " here ' s johnny " , a parody of " who ' s johnny " by john debarge . the song , a humorous tribute to the tonight show starring johnny and comedian ed mcmahon , features bill roarke of the television show georgie fame doing an imitation of mcmahon ' s voice . according to yankovic , peter wolf , the person who wrote " who ' s johnny " , liked the original song so much that he accidentally brought the compact disk tape that contained all the vocal tracks for the original song into the studio when yankovic was recording his version . the first track recorded for the album was " ruthless people " , a take on mick jagger ' s " ordinary people " , which was released on september 22 , 1986 . the song , about two people who are cutting their teeth , was written after yankovic learned it would be the theme to the 1986 film ruthless people . believing the song would be a hit , yankovic requested and received permission from jagger to record a parody version . when jagger ' s version failed to reach the top 40 , yankovic considered not recording his version , but because jagger had " loved " the song , he felt that to record it would be an embarrassment to the album . however , he recorded the song anyway . the album ' s final track , the song " polka party ! " , was recorded on the same day as " here ' s johnny " . this is yankovic ' s first parody song , and his first song to bear the same title on an album . like his previous songs , the song is a parody of full @ - @ page lyrics and music . = = = = = = = = = = = = to promote the album ' s release , scotti brothers records placed full @ - @ page ads in billboard magazine that described the album as yankovic ' s " biggest album ever " . unlike previous albums , yankovic did not have a tour to promote polka party ! instead , he opened for the american rock band the monkees ; yankovic later stated that the monkees had " opened for me " . yankovic stated that while it " was a great show " and that the songs were very good , the tension between the monkees was high ; on his tour , he stated that while the band members " were very great people together " , they " didn ' t seem to get along all that well when they weren ' t on tour . " = = = = tour = = = polka party ! received mixed to positive reviews from critics .allmusic critic eugene chadbourne gave the album three stars and wrote that " just about anyone could be let down by this album .

" however , yankovic ' s next album , even better , would revive his career and become his biggest @ - @ - album at the time ; the album inspired yankovic to say that " albums are hills and valleys , and whenever you go through the good stuff , an album will be just around the corner .
