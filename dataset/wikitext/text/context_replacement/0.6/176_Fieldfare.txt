= = = the lark ( penelope pilaris ) is a member of the lark family turdidae . it breeds in woodland and scrub in northern europe and asia . it is mainly migratory , with the breeding birds moving south during the winter . it is a relatively rare species in the british isles , and occurs in large numbers in the united kingdom , southern europe , north africa and the middle east . it is vegetarian , eating a wide range of insects , insects and seeds in the summer , and berries , fruit and nuts in the winter . they usually nest in large trees , probably for protection from predators . the nest is built in a tree where four to eight eggs are laid . the chicks are fed by both parents and leave the nest once a week . there may be two pairs in some parts of the range but only pairs further south . breeding adults and resident birds may form large groups , often in the company of adults . the lark is 25 cm ( 10 in ) long , with a grey head , neck and rump , a plain brown back , black wings and tail and white feet . the breast and belly are dark streaked . the bill has a greenish gloss and the underside of the wings is white . the sexes are similar in appearance but the sexes are much more similar . the male has a harsh alarm call and the females have various harsh alarm and alarm calls . = = = = = the common name field lark dates back to at least the eleventh century . the anglo @ - @ saxon word feldefare ##r means walking in the field . the species was introduced by linnaeus in his systema naturae ( 1758 ) as its current scientific name . the name penelope pilaris comes from two different latin words for lark . no subspecies are recognised . = = = = = the species is easily recognised with its slate @ -

@ primaries has dark greyish @ - @ black edges and edges and pale streaks and edges . the beak is black , with a slight curve and a notch at the tip . it is brownish @ - @ black in winter , with the upper parts being paler and the legs are orange @ - @ black . in the summer the sides of the male ' s beak are grey . the eyes are dark brown and the legs and feet are grey . the average wing length is 23 cm ( 9 @ . @ 10 in ) , the winglength is 9 @ . @ 14 cm ( 6 @ . @ 6 in ) and the tail is 9 @ . @ 5 cm ( 4 @ . @ 2 in ) . the female is very similar to the male but the upper parts are slightly paler grey and the feathers on the tail have two white longitudinal bands . the throat and breast are grey with darker , darker markings . the bill is similar to the male ' s black bill . the female has a morelarger than the male with dark brown spots on the wings that become lighter brown in the adult . the young gain their adult plumage after their first flight in the spring . the call is usually given in pairs and is a harsh " tsak tsak tsuk " . the same call , but softer , is given more often when they gather in groups . when disturbed or disturbed they give harsh alarm calls reminiscent of the mistle ##bird ( also viscivorous ) . the species has a very harsh song that only occurs during the breeding season . it is a mixture of a few notes like those of the common raven ( sylvia merula ) , with loud , short notes and long notes . this is sung on the ground and sometimes from a perch and a subdued version of this song with more harsh notes is sung by a group of birds at social gatherings . = = distribution and range = = the species is a common species with a palearctic distribution . it breeds in southern norway , northern sweden , finland , denmark , germany , switzerland , austria , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , poland and russia as far south as transbaikal , the aldan mountains and the tian shan mountains of north western china . the breeding range extends from northern and central europe to north africa , but it is uncommon in the mediterranean region . some birds migrate to turkey , iraq , iran and northern iran , and to south africa . it is a migrant to iceland , greenland , iceland , the canary islands , the balearic islands , italy , corsica , sardinia , greece , crete and cyprus . in the summer the species visits dense forests of oak , beech , pine , spruce and beech , often in lakes , ponds and other open ground . it does not detect the presence of predators and can be found in open fields , fields , parks and gardens . it also visits open woodland and the tops of mountains above the tree line . in the winter , groups of birds are often found in open woodland , pasture ##land , scrub and mixed woodland . they are migratory , feeding where there is an availability of food and water . later in the summer they move on to pasture and open land . = = = = = the flight of the species is fast and noisy . it gives several wing beats and closes its wings rapidly before moving on . it is very intelligent , very slow and easily caught in the air and fast and noisy whenthe breeding season . when the bird is in a group they all turn to look in the same direction , keeping up a constant distance . when foraging on the ground , or in association with trees , the group makes its way up ##hill , each bird stopping every so often to stand erect and look upwards before further feeding . when disturbed they turn back into ##wind and the whole group repeats itself . in winter they do not nest in the shadows as the white and wood ##cock , instead they nest in the open under stones and low branches . they nest widely , sometimes in low bushes and trees but usually on the ground . breeding sites are in open woodland among bushes and blades of grass , in forestry plantations , in gardens and on the edges of agricultural fields . migration north from the breeding season starts in october and the bulk of migrants arrive in the united kingdom in february . some of these are released on arrival and move south into mainland europe while others remain . the first @ - @ migrants arrive in april and they and the other birds return from the united kingdom mainly in early may . the fieldfare is omnivorous . the fruit of the diet includes snails and snails , snails , berries and insects such as beetles and their larvae , butterflies and moths . when insects appear in the field these are eaten in great number . oak , ash , ash , hazel , hazel , ash ##wood , cotoneaster , pyracantha and willow are also eaten . later in the season , berries are eaten , fruit eaten in the field and grain and seeds eaten . when these are scarce , or in very bad weather , the birds may return to shore or to the foreshore where they are to be kept . = = = = = the breeding season starts in april in ireland but migration north to britain does not begin until early september . the european cock builds a passage @ - @ shaped nest with little attempt at concealment . the nest is usually in woodland but may be in a field , forest , among shrubs , in a pile of stones , in a tree or on the ground . they usually nest in close proximity to others of the same species . the female will defend the nest , and nesting sites may offer protection from predators . the nest is made of dried grass and twigs with a few leaves and a little moss , with outer lining of leaves and an inner lining of fine moss . there are usually fiveto four eggs in a clutch , although usually three , five , six or eight eggs are laid . the eggs range in size from 25 @ . @ 5 by 23 @ . @ 9 millimetres ( 1 @ . @ 32 in × 0 @ . @ 14 in ) to 25 @ . @ 5 by 23 @ . @ 4 millimetres ( 1 @ . @ 32 in × 0 @ . @ 14 in ) and are variable in colour . some are pale blue , with small red spots and resembling those of the common raven . others are dark blue , with or without the - @ - @ - mark . laying begins when all the eggs are laid and lasts for twelve to fifteen days . the female does all or part of the brooding . the chicks are fed and the parents bring food to them . they are usually able to leave the nest after ten to fifteen days and there may be several generations during the year , especially in the northern part of the breeding range . = = range and distribution = = the species has an extensive range , estimated at 10 million square kilometres ( 4 @ . @ 10 million square miles ) , and a large population , with numbers estimated between ten to twenty five million individuals in europe . there are estimated to be up to ten million individuals in europe and the global population is estimated to be between twenty five and thirty five million individuals . the population trend appears to be stable and the population is not likely to reach the threshold for the population decline category of the iucn red list of threatened species ( i . e . , declining more than 50 % in five years or two generations ) , and is therefore listed as being of " least concern " . in the united kingdom , in the extreme south of the species ' historic breeding range , only a handful of individuals remain . it is currently listed by the rspb as a red list species as of may 2013 .
