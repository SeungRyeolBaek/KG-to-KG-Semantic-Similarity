to up jack dob , he bound his leg with vinegar and brown paper . by the early 20th century this had been changed in several collections , such as e . c . white ' s , mother goose ' s nursery rhymes ( london , 1919 ) to : up jack got and home did run , as fast as he could run ; and went to jack and bound his leg with vinegar and brown paper . the third verse , probably added to the rhyme , was first recorded in a nineteenth @ - @ century chapbook and takes the form : how jill came down , and she did grin , to see jack ' s paper plaster ; her mother whipt her , on her knee , for laughing at jack ' s disaster . twentieth @ - @ century versions of this rhyme are : when jill came , how she did grin to see jack ' s paper plaster ; she had to whip her , for seeing jack ' s disaster . the rhyme is made up of verses , with a rhyme pattern of abcb ( with an internal rhyme ) , an internal rhyme ( where the syllable stress falls on a single stressed syllable : - @ - @ is the stress ) and a dotted rhyme ( with the stress falling on the stress of a pair of syllables ) , often in a compound rhyme , which is common in nursery rhymes . the melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by the composer and nursery rhyme collector , william elliottin his english nursery rhymes and folk songs ( 1870 ) . the roud folk song index , which lists folk songs and their variants by number , lists the song as 10266 . = = chorus and rhyme = = the rhyme has also been interpreted as a love song , such that the boys go up a hill to fetch water , which was often thought to be found at the top of mountains . water and brown sugar were a common remedy used as a way to wash the mud from the face . the phrase " jack and jill " , representing a boy and a witch , was in use in england as early as the 16th century . a play , performed at the globe theatre in 1567 @ - @ , with the title jack and jill and the witch was used twice by shakespeare : in a midsummer night ' s dream , which contains the line : " jack shall be jill ; jill shall be jack " ( v : i : 460 @ - @ 8 ) and in love ' s labour ' s lost , which contains the line : " our love doth not cease in an old age ; jack hath become jill " ( v : i : 874 – [UNK] ) , suggesting that it was a phrase that implied a happily married relationship , as in the line " a good jack is a good jill " . jack was the most common character used in english language nursery rhymes and in the 17th century was the ideal male character , but by the end of the middle ages jill and jack had come to represent a young girl and a boy . however , the illustrations that accompanied the earliest printed version of the rhyme depicted two children ( possibly a boy and a girl ) , and used the phrase jack and jill . this earliest known version dates from a copy of john newbery ' s mother goose ' s song , believed to have been first published in england in 1765 . the association of " jack " with " jill " , was suggested by iona and john opie to mean that the earliest version may date from the second half of the 16th century . = = = = = = the exact origins of the rhyme are : there are several theories . as is common with nursery rhyme collections , various versions are often assumed to be of the origin of jack and jill . some versions from @ - @ are the first publication of the rhyme and offer no further evidence . these include the suggestion by mrs . post @ - @ early in the 19th century that the lyrics are a version of the2 . in the 15th @ - @ century icelandic poem gylfaginning , by the poet snorri sturluson , it states that in norse mythology , hjuki and bil , brother and sister ( jill ) , were pulled up from the earth by the goddess ( identified as the goddess mani ) . they were drinking water from the spring of byrgir , with on their shoulders the man called saegr and the horse called simul . in 1835 , bellenden smith suggested that jack and jill represent two men , and this was revised by katherine elwes in 1930 to suggest that jack represented cardinal wolsey ( c . 1471 – 1530 ) ; and jill represented de tarbes , who celebrated the marriage of mary tudor to the french king in 1514 . it has also been suggested that the rhyme describes the attempt by king james v to raise the tax on scottish wine . this was rejected by parliament , and he proposed that the size of the gill ( 1 / 2 inch ) be reduced , but the amount remained the same . this meant that he still paid the tax , despite parliament ' s opposition . = " jack fell down and lost his crown " ( most wine bottles in the uk now have the cork at the 1 / 2 inch level with the crown on it ) " and jill came down again " . the reference to " jill " ( as in " jack " , meaning 1 / 2 inch ) is meant to indicate that the pair fell to pieces as a result . the suggestion has also been made that jack and jill represent louis xvi of france , who was captured and executed in 1793 ( losing his crown ) , and his wife , marie antoinette ( who fell back down ) , a suggestion made possible by the fact that the english version of the rhyme pre @ - @ of those events . there is also a local tradition that the rhyme describes events in the village of kilmersdon , scotland in 1697 . when a young woman became pregnant , the young woman is said to have died from a sudden illness and the mother died in childbirth shortly thereafter . = florida state road 878 = state road 878 ( sr 878 ) , called the goose island expressway or the goose creek tollway for its entire length , is located 4 @ . @ mile @ - @ - @ - @ - ( 4 @ . @ . miles ) south – west of highway ##way east of jacksonville , florida . the road is named for the nearby goose islandwhich runs parallel to sr 878 . it serves as a spur route of the don shula expressway ( sr 874 ) , providing access to u . s . route 1 ( us 1 ) in downtown miami and providing access to the south miami district , including the dadeland district . the route is owned and operated by the - @ - @ dade transit corporation ( mdx ) . = = = = = = sr 878 ' s eastern terminus is merged into the don shula expressway ' s interchange with kendall drive ( sr 94 ) at the edge of the miami and dade district . traffic on the don shula expressway originating from kendall drive are given the choice of continuing onto sr 874 via a ramp , or else merging into the ramps of sr 874 for the coconut creek expressway , which then passes under the kendall drive – don shula expressway interchange . the westbound lanes of sr 878 , however , pass under sr 874 ' s ramps , and are then given an additional lane beside the eastbound lanes for 0 @ . @ 46 miles ( 0 @ . @ 74 km ) , before merging into sr 874 just east of the kendall drive interchange . eastbound vehicles from the don shula expressway wishing to continue to kendall drive merge into this route , except for sr 94 with those vehicles originating from the coconut creek expressway . there is no direct route for eastbound traffic on sr 874 to head east along sr 878 ; therefore , westbound traffic on sr 878 cannot head east on sr 874 directly . from there , sr 878 runs generally east as a 0 @ - @ - @ - @ - route through residential neighborhoods for the remainder of its length , until approximately 0 @ . @ 50 miles ( 0 @ . @ 80 km ) north of kendall drive . at approximately 0 @ . @ 4 miles ( 0 @ . @ 6 km ) , the coconut creek expressway passes under the 87th street toll plaza . it then meets galloway road ( sr 973 ) shortly thereafter with a partial interchange . the expressway then enters glenvar , where it meets sr 973 and remains in that area for the remainder of its length . shortly after passing under the galloway freeway ( sr 826 ) without an interchange ( approximately 1 mile ( 0 @ . @ 2 km ) north of galloway road ) , sr 878 reaches its third and final toll plaza . approximately 0 @ . @ 3 miles ( 0 @ . @ 5 km ) north of the galloway interchange , the878 has a partial diamond interchange with southwest 72nd avenue , which also allows westbound entrance to and eastbound exit from the goose creek expressway . shortly thereafter , sr 878 turns to the northeast and begins to meet its northern terminus with the old dixie highway ( us 1 ) at a single exit 0 @ . @ 6 miles ( 0 @ . @ 10 km ) later , passing under the metrorail line and the metropath ##s while doing so . while heading south along us 1 from northbound , 878 goes into a straight lane , so that traffic to the north along us 1 enters it at an oblique angle , controlled by traffic lights . the only entrance onto sr 878 directly from us 1 is for northbound traffic ; traffic heading south along us 1 are directed to sr 878 by signs at southwest 67th avenue and south main street . = = = = = sr 878 ' s toll are entirely collected : cash cannot be collected along its length . payment is made either via sunpass , or via the @ - @ - @ - @ plate programs , the latter of which has a higher fee . two toll booths are located along the goose creek expressway , the first between the don shula expressway and galloway road , and the second between galloway road and southwest 72nd avenue . the separation between the toll booths and vehicles on sr 878 and sr 874 means that all vehicles are charged at least one toll for using the expressway ; there are no " toll ##bies " . as of january 1 , 2013 , the toll for a toll @ - @ plate vehicle to travel the entire length of the goose creek expressway is $ 0 @ . @ 25 with a sunpass card , or $ 0 @ . @ 00 via the toll @ - @ - @ - @ plate program . the final toll of the vehicle costs an additional $ 0 @ . @ 25 via sunpass and $ 0 @ . @ 10 via toll @ - @ - @ - @ 10 for each toll booth used . = = = = = planning in dade county for a freeway named the " goose creek expressway " was underway as early as 1958 , with a projected completion date of as early as 1975 . funding for sr 878 ' s construction was made available in 1971 by the florida department of transportation as part of plans to construct the goose creek expressway along with the south dade expressway ( now known as the don shula expressway ) and the north dade expressway ( now known as the gateway expressway of florida ' s turnpike) , with an estimated completion date of late 1973 . construction was halted in 1974 due to demands made from city officials for construction - related costs , and the project was left largely unfinished ; however , $ 10 million in federal stimulus funding was used to complete the project in late 1977 . the goose creek expressway , now sr 878 , was completed in late 1980 , with the east 72nd street interchange opening a few months later . no toll was charged on sr 878 , in accordance with the project ' s original schedule , until mdx ' s officials cut @ - @ out of the access toll from late 2009 to begin @ - @ 2010 on the expressway itself . construction on the goose creek expressway began on july 1 , 2010 . the decision to build the goose island expressway angered local residents , but was thwarted by mdx ' s decision to approve toll increases . initially , rates were $ 1 @ . @ 50 for sunpass holders , with a $ 1 @ . @ 50 discount for those using the new @ - @ by @ - @ plate system . the toll @ - @ by @ - @ card rate increased by 10 percent on january 1 , 2013 , to $ 1 @ . @ 50 per month that month , while the sunpass rate remained unchanged . = = = = = = the entire expressway is in the @ - @ dade county . all exits are unsigned .
