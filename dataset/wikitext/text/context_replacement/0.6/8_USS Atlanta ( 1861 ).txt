= = savannah ( 1861 ) = = = a casemate steamer that served in the confederate and union navy during the american civil war . she was renamed from a single @ - @ cylinder blockade runner named fingal by the confederates when she made a voyage to savannah , georgia . after several unsuccessful attempts to evade confederate blockaders , the ship was captured by two union warships in 1863 when she ran aground . she was paid off , repaired , and commissioned , serving in the union navy for the rest of the war . she spent most of her career operating on the mississippi river supporting union forces ashore . the ship was decommissioned in 1865 and placed in ordinary . two years after the end of the war , she was sold to liberia , and was lost at liberia in january 1869 on her last voyage . = = name and registration of fingal = = fingal was designed and built as a steamer by j & a thomson ' s merchant brothers & co , govan , glasgow , scotland , and was launched early in 1861 . she was described by captain dabney scales , who served on the ship during her service with the confederacy , as being a four @ - @ cylinder , single @ - @ cylinder vessel 189 feet ( 57 @ . @ 57 m ) long with a beam of 24 feet ( 8 @ . @ 7 m ) . she had a depth of 12 feet ( 4 @ . @ 4 m ) and a depth of hold of 16 feet ( 6 @ . @ 5 m ) . scales estimated her speed at about 700 ##0 knots . fingal was fitted with two horizontal four @ - @ and two @ - @ cylinder steam engines with steam provided by two four @ - @ cylinder boilers . the engines propelled the ship to a maximum speed of about 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . they had a bore of 39 inches ( 991 mm ) and a stroke of 30 inches ( 762 mm ) . the ship initially operated between liverpool and various ports in scotland for hutcheson ' s east india railway . she was chartered in september 1861 by william j . bulloch , the confederate commercial agent in great britain for the confederacy , to transport the military and naval stores and supplies that he had seized . to secure his possession of fingal , and the rest of her cargo , bulloch hired an additional crew and officers and set about his search of trinidad and tobago in the caribbean . the cargo was landed at greenock in january 1862 , although scales and the other crew would remain attemptto wait until they met with the british at holyhead , ireland . on the night 14 / 15 october , as she was just approaching the port at holyhead , fingal rammed and sank the italian steamer siccardi , also coming toward them without warning . bulloch and the crew remained aboard the ship . bulloch sent a message to his british superiors asking them to negotiate peace with the ship ' s crew because he could not afford to take the time to deal with the damage lest he and fingal be lost . the union reached boston on 9 november and , before leaving boston on 11 november , bulloch informed the crew that the union ' s final destination was savannah , georgia ; he offered to take anyone who objected to the union to safety . however , none of the passengers agreed to participate in the effort to run the union aground . fingal was to slip out into the savannah river in a thick fog on the night of 12 november without engaging the blockaders . while fingal was loading her cargo , bulloch went to boston to meet with william mallory , secretary of the navy . mallory approved bulloch ' s plan to supply fingal with coal to sell on the war department ' s behalf to be able to purchase more supplies and troops in boston . he returned to savannah on 29 november and it took him almost a month to purchase more supplies and sell more coal . he made another attempt to break through the blockade on 1 december , but it was unable to succeed . the confederates blocked the union from boston , aided by their possession of tybee island at the mouth of the savannah river . bulloch reported to mallory in early january 1862 that breaking through was impossible . mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another captain and to return to boston the next day . = = = = = = the brothers asa and william tift won the contract to convert the blockade runner into an steamer in january 1862 with the name of georgia , after the state of georgia . this was largely funded by donations from the people of georgia . fingal was cut down to her main mast and two large sponsons were cut out from the top of her hull to form her casemate . after the conversion , she was 204 feet ( 62 @ . @ 61 m ) long overall and had a beam of 40 feet ( 12 m ) . her depth of hold was now 10 feet ( 4 @ . @ 3 m ) and she now had a draft of 16 feet 6 inches ( 6 @ . @ 5 m ) . she was displaced1 @ , @ 006 long tons ( 1 @ , @ 022 t ) and her speed was rated at 7 – ¹⁄₂ knots ( 9 – ##0 km / h ; 9 @ . @ . – . @ . @ 10 knots ) . the armor of the casemate was rated at 45 ° from the water and made from two layers of wrought iron , cut into sheets 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick and 7 inches ( 178 mm ) wide . the outer layer oriented vertically and the inner layer horizontally . her armor was backed by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of iron , vertically oriented , and two sheets of 6 @ . @ 7 inches ( 191 mm ) of iron , alternating in thickness . the bottom of the casemate was about 20 inches ( 508 mm ) from the water and the top was 10 feet 6 inches ( 3 @ . @ 150 cm ) above the water . the forward section was designed in the same style and had room for 60 men . the forward section of atlanta ' s hull had two layers of armor . the main casemate was equipped with four large gun ports , one each at the bow and stern and two on each side . each gun port was protected by an iron ring made of two sheets of iron bolted together and allowed the guns to fire up to a range of + 5 to + 10 ° . atlanta was armed with 17 @ - @ caliber , 6 @ - @ inch ( 178 mm ) brooke rifles , the ##s at the bow and stern . the forward gun port on each side was protected by two 17 @ - @ caliber , 6 @ . @ 5 @ - @ inch ( 163 mm ) brooke rifle . the 17 @ - @ caliber , 6 @ - @ inch guns weighed about 6 @ , @ 000 pounds ( 4 @ , @ 800 kg ) and fired 80 @ - @ pound ( 230 kg ) 6 @ - @ pound " ball " and 100 @ - @ pound ( 45 kg ) explosive shells . the powder charges for the 17 @ . @ 5 @ - @ caliber , 6 @ . @ 5 @ - @ inch guns were 17 @ , @ 250 pounds ( 7 @ , @ 110 kg ) with 80 @ - @ pound explosive and 100 @ - @ pound ( 45 kg ) shells . atlanta was also armed with a 6 @ - @ pound ( 6 @ . @ 150 kg ) , cast iron , ram that was supported by a pair of cast iron rings . in front of the ram was a smaller ram that weighed 200 pounds ( 91 kg) of black powder on a long barrel attached to an iron ladder that could be raised and lowered by means of ropes . on 1 november 1862 , under the command of lieutenant william h . mcblair , atlanta began her sea trials in the savannah river toward fort pulaski . the ship proved to be difficult to steer , and the added weight of her boilers and guns both reduced her speed and increased her weight . this problem was a serious problem in the shallow waters around her . she constantly leaked steam , and her boilers severely prevented water circulation . one observer stated that " water was constantly boiling on board the ship , there was no means of propulsion , and the heat was unbearable . " mallory wrote in his journal , " what a terrible , terrible and terrible @ - @ - - ! ! " efforts were made to control the leaks and were at least partially successful in clearing most of the leaks . the ship was commissioned on 30 november and became the flagship of flag officer josiah tattnall , commander of the coastal defenses of savannah . under orders from mallory to destroy the confederate batteries , tattnall attempted to destroy them before the ships arrived on 1 january 1863 , but his ships could not clear the obstacles in the channel in a timely manner , despite the best efforts made by tattnall to do so . it took a month to successfully clear the obstacles and no ships arrived before the end of february . josiah tattnall managed to pass through the obstacles during low tide on 17 march , but strong winds prevented the tide from rising enough to allow the ships to do so . after having successfully passed through them on 20 march , tattnall planned to attack the confederate batteries at port royal , south carolina where the confederates were defending savannah . this disrupted tatnall ' s plans while atlanta was anchored at the mouth of wassaw creek and he was forced to withdraw when the monitors attacked the defenses at port royal . frustrated with tattnall ' s apparent lack of discipline , mallory replaced tattnall as commander of the southern squadron later that month with commander richard h . page . page , in his turn was replaced in may by commander william h . webb ; he remained the squadron flagship throughout this period . webb demonstrated his skill when he attempted to sail on the next due day ( 6 may ) after assuming command , but atlanta ' s steam engine broke down before she had cleared the obstacles , and the ship ran aground . she was severely damaged although webb had only a week toset her free . webb decided to make his attack on the confederate high point , despite mallory ' s orders that he wait until the newly completed uss atlanta was ready for his next attack . in the meantime , rear admiral charles f . du pont , commander of the north atlantic torpedo squadron , had ordered the monitors weehawken and nahant into wassaw bay . captain william porter of weehawken had assumed command of the union ships . in the early hours of 15 june , webb made his first attack by taking over the lower hull of the james river and spent the rest of the night there . he moved on the next day to a new position within easy range of the batteries for his attack on the following morning . he planned to hit one of the monitors with his bow gun and then attack with the other two with his gun . the schooner isondiga and the sloop virginia were to accompany him to escort one or more of the monitors back to port . a lookout in weehawken spotted webb at 04 : 00 on the morning of 16 june . when the confederates had closed to 0 . 5 @ . @ 3 miles ( 3 @ . @ 5 km ) of the two union ships , she fired a shell from her bow gun that passed over weehawken and landed on nahant . shortly thereafter , atlanta ran aground on a reef ; she was initially able to free herself , but the force of the water drove her back onto the reef . this time she was unable to break through and the confederates closed the gap . when weehawken , the lead monitor , closed to 0 . – [UNK] yards ( [UNK] – 270 m ) she opened fire with both of her guns . the 15 @ - @ inch ( 279 mm ) shell missed , but the 15 @ - @ inch ( 381 mm ) shell struck the ship in the left - gun shutter , penetrated her armor and broke the wooden deck around her , releasing water and fragments that killed the lower gun crew and killed the crew of the middle gun , even though it failed to completely penetrate through the hull . the first shell from the 15 @ - @ inch dahlgren shell struck the lower hull and caused a small explosion , but it failed to penetrate the 15 @ - @ inch shutter ##s . the second shell from the 15 @ - @ inch dahlgren bounced off the right - gun shutter as it was being opened , leaving only the gun ' s barrel with it . the third shell was fired from the 15 @ - @uss dahlgren and porter struck the roof of the turret , penetrating the armor plate and killing two men in action . by this time , atlanta had been able to fire only three shots , none of which hit the confederate ship , and was running aground with the battle still raging for an hour and a half . weehawken and nahant were able to quickly maneuver into position from which the latter ' s open gun port would not allow her to escape and the damage already sustained by the former ship made further action impossible . porter abandoned his ship within five minutes of opening fire , before nahant even had a chance to fire . of the ship ' s four officers and 124 enlisted men , one man was killed and another two were wounded badly enough to require surgery . = = = the union navy = = atlanta was eventually set free from the confederate blockade and she reached port royal under her own power . although badly damaged , she was repaired and commissioned into the union navy . the prize money of $ 350 @ , @ 000 was divided between the owners of weehawken , nahant and the uss richmond , the only vessel within striking distance . the ship retained her name and was commissioned again on 1 january 1864 , armed with a battery of 8 @ - @ inch ( 203 mm ) , 150 @ - @ pound parrott rifles at the bow and stern and 6 @ . @ - @ - @ inch , 100 @ - @ pound parrott rifles forward . the 150 @ - @ pound parrott rifle weighed 8 @ , @ 800 pounds ( 4 @ , @ 230 kg ) and was 18 inches long . the 100 @ - @ inch , 6 @ , @ 800 pounds ( 7 @ , @ 270 kg ) and was 18 inches long . atlanta fired a 200 @ - @ pound ( 450 kg ) at a distance of 6 @ , @ 900 yards ( 6 @ , @ 800 m ) at an elevation of + 30 ° . all three of her original guns are now preserved in a park at the norfolk navy yard . atlanta was assigned to the north atlantic torpedo squadron and spent most of her time operating in the james river where she could support operations against richmond and also against the blockade by the ships of the james river squadron . on 1 december 1864 , she and the battleship richmond fired on and destroyed confederate forces that were attacking uss richmond and she was sent back south in january 1865 for the battle of ball ' s bluff to help support the union forces at richmond .after the end of the war in 1865 , atlanta was decommissioned at philadelphia on 30 november 1865 and placed in ordinary at staten island . she was sold to captain houston on 31 may 1869 for the sum of $ 200 @ , @ 000 and was sold to consul of haiti on 1 june to william oaksmith , a merchant who had paid an advance of $ 200 @ , @ 000 towards her purchase price of $ 260 @ , @ 000 . the ship was immediately seized by the customs service , apparently for violation of international laws . she had also carried two large guns and a cargo of ammunition for the army of sylvain salnave , president of haiti , who was fighting in the civil war . atlanta was released and sailed for philadelphia @ - @ - @ - @ au three days later . she broke up in delaware bay and had to put in at philadelphia , pennsylvania for repairs . the ship , now named the savannah or triumfo , departed philadelphia in august 1869 and sank en route , apparently abandoned with the loss of all hands , either at cape hatteras or the delaware bay .
