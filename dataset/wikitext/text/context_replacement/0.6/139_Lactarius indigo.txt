= ( indigo = indigo ) , commonly known as the indigo milk cap , the indigo ( or indigo ) cap , or the indigo milk cap , is a species of coral fungus in the family ##iaceae . a widely distributed species , it occurs naturally in eastern north america , western asia , and south america ; it has also been reported from southern europe . l . indigo grows on the ground in both deciduous and evergreen forests , where it forms mycorrhizal associations with a wide variety of fungi . the fruit body color ranges from dark blue in young specimens to light blue @ - @ - in aged specimens . the flesh , or cap , that forms when the mushroom stem is bruised or cut — , characteristic characteristic to all members of the indigo genus — is initially white colored , but soon turns blue upon exposure to air . the cap has a diameter of 5 to 15 cm ( 2 to 6 in ) , and the stem is 2 to 8 cm ( 1 @ . @ 1 to 3 in ) tall and up to 2 @ . @ 2 cm ( 1 @ . @ 1 to 5 @ . @ 2 in ) wide . it is an edible mushroom , and is sold in local markets in canada , mexico , and australia . = = distribution and distribution = = originally described in 1822 as genus indigo by german mycologist ##s . von schweinitz , the species was later transferred to the genus lactarius in 1838 by the botanist elias magnus fries . german botanist otto kuntze called it lactifluus indigo in his 1891 work revisio generum plantarum , but the genus name indigo was later used by others . hesler and colleagues in their 1960 classification of north american species of indigo placed l . indigo as the type species of tribe caerulei , a group characterized by white spores and a pale , white cap . in 1979 , they reversed their position on the number of species within the genus indigo , and instead placed l . indigo in subgenus indigo based on the number of spores , and the rapid color changes observed upon exposure to air . as they noted : the rapid change of blue to red colors as one occurs from species to species is an interesting subject for further study . the subgenus is formed by l . indigo which is now ##r . c . indigo and the subgenus chelidonioides , l . paradoxus , and l . hemicyaneus may beand means " on the way to l . " . the specific epithet indigo is derived from the latin word for " indigo milk " . common names in the english language include the " indigo milk cap " , the " indigo cap " , the " indigo milk cap " , and the " indigo cap " . in southern mexico , it is known as indigo , azul , hongo azul , zuin , and zuine ; it is also called quexque ( meaning " blue " ) in puebla and oaxaca . = = = = = like many other mushrooms , l . indigo grows from a seed , or seed , that develops from the primary organs , a group of small white cells called spores that make up the majority of the fungus . under favorable environmental conditions of temperature , moisture , and nutrient availability , the primary reproductive structures ( fruit bodies ) are formed . the cap of the fruit body , typically between 5 and 15 cm ( 2 @ . @ 3 and 4 @ . @ 6 in ) in diameter , is initially convex and later becomes a shallow depression ; with age it becomes flat or slightly convex , and violet - @ - @ shaped . the margin of the cap curves upward . the margin of the cap is rolled up when young , and cracks and expands as it ages . the cap color is dark blue when young , and fades to a pale blue - or violet @ - @ color , sometimes with darker edges . it is somewhat zonate : white with blue stripes that form alternating light and dark bands , and the cap may have dark blue spots , especially towards the center . young specimens are sticky to the touch . the flesh is cream to white in color , sometimes turning blue upon being exposed to light ; the odor is mild to slightly bitter . the flesh of the mature mushroom is tough , and the cap , if damaged severely , will break off easily . the flesh produced from injured tissue is dark blue , and makes the injured tissue stronger ; like the flesh , the cap has a strong odor . the mushroom is notable for not producing as much fruit as other edible mushrooms , and older specimens in cultivation may be too worn out to produce viable spores . the gills of the mushroom range from erect ( not attached to the stem ) to somewhat decurrent ( extending along the length of the stem ) , and grow closely together . their color is usually indigo blue , andlighter with age and becomes darker with age . the stem is typically – 0 cm ( 0 @ . @ [UNK] – # @ . @ 3 in ) long and 0 – @ @ . @ 5 cm ( 0 @ . @ [UNK] – 0 @ . @ 2 in ) thick , and the cap is equal or slightly smaller at maturity . the color is pale blue to white - or pale brown . the base of the stem is hollow and hollow throughout , but becomes more hollow with age . like the cap , it is initially sticky to sticky to the touch when young , but later dry out . the attachment to the stem is usually through a central groove , although it may also be located @ - @ [UNK] . fruit bodies of l . indigo have several distinctive characteristics . l . indigo var . diminutivus ( the " small indigo - cap " ) is a smaller variant of the variety , with a cap diameter between 3 and 8 cm ( 0 @ . @ 2 and 0 @ . @ 3 in ) , and a stem 0 @ . @ [UNK] – ##1 @ . @ 2 cm ( 1 @ . @ [UNK] – 0 @ . @ 6 in ) long and 0 @ . @ [UNK] – 0 @ . @ 5 cm ( 0 @ . @ [UNK] – ##4 @ . @ 6 in ) thick . it is rarely seen in cultivation . hesler and colleagues , who originally described the fungus based on specimens collected in brazoria county , texas , described its natural habitat as " on [ the ] bottom of a drainage ditch under trees and shrubs , [ with ] dead pine needles " . = = = = = = = = when viewed in sunlight , as in a leaf print , the spores appear yellow to white initially . viewed with a light microscope , the spores are translucent ( translucent ) , cylindrical to roughly spherical in shape , with no center , and have dimensions of 0 – @ . 0 @ . @ [UNK] – # @ . @ 1 µm . scanning electron microscopy reveals cells on the cap surface . the nucleus is the four @ - @ [UNK] outer layer of the fruit body , and consists of cells that extend into the cap and end in terminal cells . several cell types can be found in the fungus , and the cells have microscopic characters that can be used to help identify and identify them in cases where the cell structure may be unclear . the two @ - @ end cells , the nucleus , the four @ - @spored and measure 1 – . µm long by 1 – . µm wide at the attachment point . cystidia are small groups of cells in the cap which do not form spores , and help in controlling their formation , and maintaining moist conditions for the spores . the pleurocystidia are cystidia that are found on the edge of a gill ; they measure 5 – @ , 10 @ . @ , – . µm , are 5 @ - @ long , and have a cylindrical shape . the cheilocystidia — found on the edge of a gill — are cylindrical , and measure 5 @ . @ , – @ @ . @ 0 . 5 @ . @ 0 – @ @ . @ 1 µm . = = = = . = = = the bright blue color of the fruit body and the gills make this species easily recognizable . other edible mushrooms with a blue cap include the " blue @ - @ @ indigo " ( l . paradoxus ) , found in eastern north america , which has a blue @ - @ blue cap when young , but also has green @ - @ blue to green @ - @ colored flesh and stem . l . indigo has a pale to dark green @ - @ blue to green @ - @ blue cap and yellow to brownish stem . l . quieticolor has yellow @ - @ blue flesh in the cap and orange to yellow @ - @ orange flesh at the base of the stem . although the blue cap of l . indigo is thought to be unique to the genus indigo , in 2007 several new species were described from peninsular malaysia with no cap or stem , including l . cyanescens , l . lazulinus , l . indigo , and other species already known . = = = = = although l . indigo is a good @ - @ - @ mushroom , opinions vary on its taste . for example , american botanist john arora calls it a " moderately edible " , and a reference guide to edible mushrooms describes it as " mild in taste " . it can have a slightly bitter , slightly bitter taste , and has a rough , sticky texture . the white flesh is best removed by cutting the cap into thin strips . the white flesh fades with age , and the cap turns white . because of the sticky nature of the flesh , it does not lend itself well to cooking . when producingsmall amounts of it can be used to add flavor to food . in addition , farmers harvest the harvested mushrooms for sale at farmers ' markets , typically from april to october ; they are considered a " second best " mushroom for sale . l . indigo is commonly sold in rural markets from april to october . it is one of several mushroom species sold in rural markets in yunnan , southern china . = = = chemical composition = = = = chemical analysis of edible mushrooms has shown l . indigo to contain water at 951 mg / g of weight , fat at 12 @ . @ 3 mg / g , protein at 18 @ . @ 3 mg / g , and dietary fiber at 12 @ . @ 3 mg / g , much higher in comparison to the average edible mushroom , which is 12 @ . @ 3 mg / g . compared to the other three edible mushroom species being studied in the study ( lotus rubescens , lotus frostii , and ramaria flava ) , l . indigo has the highest saturated fatty acid content , saturated fatty acids with 12 @ . @ 3 mg / g — representing over half of the average saturated fatty acid content . the red color of l . indigo is due to ( 12 @ - @ isopropenyl @ - @ - @ - @ methylazulen @ - @ 6 @ - @ yl ) - stearate , an organic derivative of azulene . it is unique to this species , and similar to the pigment found in l . deliciosus . = = distribution , distribution , and abundance = = l . indigo is found in central and eastern north america but is most abundant on the pacific coast , mexico , and guatemala . its pattern of distribution in the rocky mountains of the united states has been described as " moderate to moderately abundant " . botanist david arora reports that in the united states , the fungus is associated with white pine in california , but is absent from california ' s coastal pine forest . it has also been reported from mexico , honduras , guatemala , and costa rica ( in forests dominated by pines ) . in mexico , it has so far only been found in western europe . a study of the annual appearance of fruit bodies in the pine forest of xalapa , mexico , found that mushroom appearance coincided with the growing season between june and september . l . indigo is a mycorrhizal fungus , and as such , forms a mutualistic relationship with the roots of pine trees ( " roots " ) ,in which the spores substitute nitrogen and amino acids obtained from the fungus for organic carbon from the wood . the mature spores of the fungus form a network of spores in the bark of a wide range of tree species , forming smooth @ - @ bark ectomycorrhizae — an ecological relationship that is highly beneficial to the fungus , as the fungus produces enzymes that fix organic carbon and facilitate the transfer of nitrogen to the host . despite their close association with trees , the fruit bodies of l . indigo are commonly found growing on the ground , alone or in groups , in both deciduous and evergreen forests . they are most commonly found in deciduous forests that have become partially cleared . in mexico , associations have been found with mexican pine , mexican oak , mexican hophornbeam , and acacia macrophylla , and in guatemala the fungus associates with smooth @ - @ bark mexican pine and other pine and oak species . in costa rica , the fungus forms associations with the various species of the same species . under favorable environmental conditions , l . indigo has shown to be able to form ectomycorrhizal associations with the neotropical pine , mexican white pine , hartweg ' s pine , mexican black pine , smooth @ - @ bark mexican pine , and the european and american pine , american white pine , scots pine , and norway spruce . = = = online = = = = arora a .
