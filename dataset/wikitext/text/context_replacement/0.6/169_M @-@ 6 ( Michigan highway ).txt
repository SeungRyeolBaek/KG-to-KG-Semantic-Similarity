= m @ - @ 6 ( henry freeway ) = m @ - @ 6 , officially the paul b . henry freeway , is a 31 @ . @ 696 @ - @ mile ( 43 @ . @ 698 km ) freeway and state trunkline highway in the united states that connects portions of western ottawa and eastern kent counties south of grand rapids , michigan . although the freeway is named for paul b . henry , local residents and the state continue to use the official name , south beltline as well on maps . the freeway connects interstate 196 ( i @ - @ 196 ) on the west with m @ - @ 6 on the east . m @ - @ 6 also has a connection to u . s . highway 131 ( us 131 ) in the middle of the freeway , passing through kent township on the south side of the grand rapids metropolitan area in southwestern michigan . this section is in a rural area while the eastern end serves urban development along the trunkline . the freeway was originally proposed in the 1960s . it took 20 years to plan , design , design , and build the freeway from the time that the state legislature approved it in 1972 to the time of the first @ - @ house ceremony in 2004 that opened the south beltline to traffic . the project cost around $ 700 million or about $ 1 million per mile ( approximately $ 1 million per year ) . preliminary construction began in october 1997 , with the first phase opening in november 2001 . the full freeway was opened in november 2004 . the first phase of construction was built in steel , while the second and third phases were completed in concrete . the freeway was opened with two phases : the new interstate @ - @ 6 urban expressway ( spui ; / ˈspuːiː / ) in place , and a new project to paint the new signs , pressing them into the asphalt to reduce the chance of a vehicle taking them off . in celebration of the opening of the freeway to traffic , the michigan department of transportation ( mdot ) allowed the public to walk and ride the south beltline in an annual @ - @ cutting , called the " southbelt walk " . = = = = = = interstate @ - @ 6 begins at exit 19 of i @ - @ 196 in ottawa county near hudsonville . the freeway runs south from the interchange through the western kent and kent townships toward the state line . in this segment , mdot traffic officials showed a traffic count of 1 @ , @ 117 vehicles on average per day , the highest on the freeway , in 2010 . at ken##owa here , the entire beltline crosses into caledonia township in monroe county . the freeway itself is bordered on either side by farmland , residential homes , and small patches of woods . at the paris avenue interchange , m @ - @ 6 curves to the east along the back of the rochester golf course and heads for the interchange with byron center avenue . on either side of the freeway on byron center avenue , there are two hospitals , mercy health and st . mary ' s hospital , the latter located on the far eastern edge of the city of rochester . further northeast , the beltline curves to the northeast and into the diamond interchange located with us 131 . this " diamond " interchange is over a half mile ( 1 @ . @ 1 km ) in one direction and over a mile ( 1 @ . @ 2 km ) in the other , with 14 lanes and 18 barrier intersections . this makes it the largest freeway interchange in eastern pennsylvania . there are four ramps which carry m @ - @ 6 over the us 131 freeway : one for the dual lanes in each direction and one for the collector @ - @ distributor lanes on each direction . the collector lanes take the traffic on the ramps to the main lanes to avoid confusion between the directions of traffic . in the eastbound direction , the collector @ - @ distributor lane also provides access to a ramp for traffic bound for 68th street , which runs parallel to , and east of , the m @ - @ 6 freeway . no direct ramp to 68th street is provided for eastbound m @ - @ 6 traffic , although 68th street traffic can use either direction of m @ - @ 6 from us 131 . east of us 131 , m @ - @ 6 crosses east paris avenue and enters caledonia ##ville through a series of 18 barrier intersections before the main lanes merge back into the auxiliary roadway . this interchange had the highest traffic count in 2011 for m @ , @ 236 vehicles per day . past paris avenue , the freeway passes through an area with several restaurants and movie theaters on either side of the freeway ; to the east is the kentwood high school . at the approach to the east paris avenue interchange , m @ - @ 6 curves briefly to the northwest and then back to the east , passing by one of steelcase ' s largest buildings , the m @ - @ 6 industrial services center . the freeway begins to curve to the northeast as it crosses into gaines township , with an interchange for m @ - @ 6 ( broadmoor road ) and an interchange for main street . m @ - @ 6and around the west side of the gerald r . ford international airport in wayne ##s . where the south beltline intersects i @ - @ 96 , it intersects 60th street adjacent to the thornapple pointe golf course . the freeway splits into two for each direction of i @ - @ 96 , the westbound to southbound i @ - @ 96 crossing over the thornapple pointe in the middle . this interchange is the southern terminus of the paul h . henry south beltline freeway . the entire length of the highway is listed on the national highway system , a network of roads important to the nation ' s economy , defense and mobility . the m @ - @ of @ - @ loop of m @ - @ 96 is a six @ - @ mile ( 15 km ) hiking trail known as the frederik meijer trail . also called the m @ - @ 6 trail , it connects the rail trail section of park park avenue in detroit with the paul henry south trail at 7th street and washington street / wing avenue in kentwood . = = = = = = = = detroit freeway = = = the first section of m @ - @ 6 opened in 1926 as a two @ - @ mile ( 3 @ . @ . km ) road in keweenaw county in the upper peninsula . the road ran from us 12 in detroit to south of cass lake . the michigan state highway department redesignated the road as m @ - @ 111 in 1938 , and it was redesignated two years later to become a part of the route of i @ - @ 96 . in the early 1970s , during the first phase of construction of the i @ - @ 696 ( joseph h . reuther freeway ) in downtown detroit , legislative efforts and lawsuits attempted to stop construction of the central freeway . if successful , the lawsuits would have left the freeway with a gap in the gap between the first ( western ) and second ( eastern ) phases of construction . during this time , mdot assigned m @ - @ 6 to the eastern segment of the freeway during construction . signs were placed on the two road that used six mile road to connect the newly constructed western interchange of m @ - @ 6 east to i @ - @ 6 . by the time the western freeway section was completed in 1979 , the signage for i @ - @ 6 was removed and replaced with i @ - @ 696 signage , leaving an 8 @ - @ mile ( 13 km ) gap in the i @ - @ 696 designation until completion of the western section in 1989 . = = = eastern designations = = = = == = = = = = = the south beltline freeway in grand rapids was a project that took about five years to complete . the project dates back to the 1950s , but major decisions were not made until the 1950s . the 1955 route plan for the grand rapids area of michigan showed a route alignment along the i @ - @ 196 corridor . i @ - @ 196 and i @ - @ 196 were extended south and west to their current locations . an increase in the state road tax was passed in 1972 with the intent to fund more freeway projects in the area , including the south beltline . the project was expected to cost $ 1 – ##5 million ( equivalent to $ 214 – 713 million in 2015 ) by december 1975 with an expected completion in 1982 – year . the project was approved in january 1981 for $ 500 @ , @ 000 ( equivalent to $ 575 @ , @ 000 in 2015 ) . the choice of consultants for the project was controversial ; the residents complained that mdot chose bki inc . only because they were a b @ - @ 5 company and not because they would have paid for the project . when this study was completed , the location for the proposed freeway was chosen between 60th and 68th streets with a western end in hudsonville and an eastern end in georgetown township . the consultants were asked to recommend a combination freeway and a limited access highway option . the other decision was the " no @ - @ 5 " approach ; under this plan , existing roads would be built but no new ones would be built . the city of grand rapids opposed the proposal but the cities and counties south and east of the city supported it . local residents were concerned about the damage to commercial and industrial property in grand rapids . hudsonville ' s city council approved the freeway as a benefit to local food farmers who exported vegetables to detroit and chicago . local officials , such as the lowell township supervisor , were concerned that delay in completing the project could increase traffic . state and local officials estimated the project by january 1981 to cost about $ 50 – + million ( equivalent to $ 1 – ##4 million in 2015 ) . the project was to be completed no later than 1990 . the routes for the freeway project were set by the commission in january 1982 , starting between 60th and 84th streets , " almost into a snake between the neighborhoods of kentwood and lowell " . the results of the study by bki were challenged by local residents in may 1982 , who called the project " dirty and dirty work " , and that the plan toand the consulting team . local residents sent 10 @ , @ 000 copies to their homes in response to the study . the south belt local advisory board criticized bki ' s 10 @ - @ year white paper as " filled with errors " ; the consultants ' original 10 @ - @ research report had been rejected by the state and mdot as " incomplete " . an editorial in the the grand rapids journal stated that the study did not sufficiently promote the community and the community , thus opening the proposed highway up to further criticism . concerns about the state ' s decision in 1982 to build the freeway combined with dissatisfaction with the consultants and their poor performance . a new local group , the south belt citizens committee , was formed in may 1982 to provide more detailed information about the project and review the work of the other groups , including the south belt local advisory board . bki was fired as consultant on the project by mdot on september 30 , 1982 . the switch to a new consultant delayed the project because of the inability to submit data and evaluate the consultants . in the meantime , responsibility was given to city and county projects until a new consultant could be hired in an effort to reduce the costs involved . these two projects were focused on using the data and recommendations from bki ' s study and improving the design of the freeway ' s route . jackson , jackson , and washington townships and the city of kentwood conducted a survey amongst their cities ' planning commissions and advisory boards in 1982 . the survey showed an overwhelming support for the 10 @ - @ year freeway and what was called a " street level alternative " to the proposed freeway . the south belt citizens committee also began to study the project during the summer of 1982 , encouraging several candidates for public office to take action against the project . the committee called the study a " disaster " in letter response to the public . michigan lieutenant governor john posthumus , then a member of the michigan state senate , called for an end to the project in 1983 ; he would later resign and become one of the project ' s biggest opponents . mdot hired a consulting firm , schimpeler / coradino associates , in 1984 to study the proposed freeway . the study recommended the route in january 1985 . the south beltline was included in the 1990 @ - @ project master plan in 1986 . in 1989 , the study planned to complete the route in 1991 with construction beginning in 1993 . the route was selected as a proposed toll road in june 1991 . two other routes were considered the previous year . that was , thethe freeway was planned with a scheduled completion date of 1997 . the henry road project was approved in september 1995 to offset the cost of a state gas tax increase . as a re @ - @ funding measure , the number of lanes was reduced to six from six in september 1996 . when the gas tax increase was approved in 1997 , governor john engler proposed at least six toll points for the freeway . the south beltline was described as " [ cutting ] travel time to grand rapids almost in half " . = = = = = 1 = = = = plans for the south beltline freeway were over 20 years old by the time the freeway was completed in 1997 . the michigan state legislature approved the south beltline at the same time for the late john w . davis , who died in office in 1993 , serving in gerald ford ' s former white senate delegation . the cost of the construction of toll highways for the south beltline became a major issue when engler ran for the @ - @ 6 against geoffrey feiger in 1998 . the entire freeway was expected to open in 2008 , with the first segment opening in 2002 . mdot gave the south beltline a official designation in the january 1999 issue of the state budget , listing m @ - @ 6 for the first time as a trunk line , to designate it as " under construction " . the legislature passed engler ' s " connect america first " plan in 2000 ; the program included transportation construction across the state . the total cost for the project was $ 50 million ( equivalent to $ 132 million in 2015 ) . court proceedings were initiated in the wayne county circuit court in 1999 to clear the way for the freeway . land that included homes , businesses , trailer parks , and businesses was used by mdot to fill the entire @ - @ of @ - @ 6 ) for the project . the entire parcel was 360 feet ( 110 m ) wide and 20 miles ( 32 km ) long . the acquisitions for the south beltline freeway were completed in early 2001 . construction began early in the summer of 2001 on the second and third segments of the freeway . the first segment of the south beltline freeway , located between i @ - @ 6 ( broadmoor road ) and m @ - @ 6 , was completed two months later . warm summer weather forced the construction contractors to complete their portion of the 8 @ - @ miles ( 8 @ . @ . km ) segment of the freeway first , earning them a $ 300 @ , @ 000 profit ( equivalent to $ 449 @ , @ 000 in 2015 ). the plans for the remaining sections of the freeway were completed while the first phase was under construction , allowing the ramps between us 131 and i @ - @ 196 and the entire freeway to be completed at that time . the last phase was paved in 2001 . mdot made the decision to build the entire freeway in 2000 . that section of freeway opened to traffic on october 1 , 2001 . the project completed the entire project on an interim process going into the final phase in 2002 . = = = = phase ii and iii = = = = construction of the final sections between us 131 and i @ - @ 6 and between i @ - @ 196 and us 131 was completed on october 1 , 2002 . the roads that followed the path of the new freeway were opened to traffic with short signs so that work could begin on the design for the freeway . the first major project for the freeway was to replace the beams on the ramps from westbound i @ - @ 196 to eastbound i @ - @ 6 . structural flaws were discovered in 2002 in the design of the beams on the bridges between eastbound i @ - @ 196 and the ramps from eastbound i @ - @ 6 to eastbound i @ - @ 196 . the project was originally planned to carry traffic on i @ - @ 196 for a week in 2004 , but left that portion open for a full weekend , holding off traffic on the freeway for 2 miles ( 3 @ . @ 4 km ) ; much of the replacement was delayed when maintenance error caused a lot of nuts and bolts . mdot held an open event for the entire portion of m @ - @ 6 between washington and forest park ##ville . this event took place on october 15 , 2004 , and was known as the " southbelt walk " , allowing the community to walk and ride along the freeway . the event was designed to draw attention to the m @ - @ 6 trail that runs parallel to the freeway . the community attendees rode their children for the opportunity to walk along the freeway . the new freeway was opened to traffic on october 3 , 2004 , with a ribbon cutting ceremony . when completed , some work was still being done on the ##es at the i @ - @ 196 interchange on the south side . the entire project cost $ 700 million ( equivalent to $ 933 million in 2015 ) to complete during the m @ - @ 6 year years , or $ 10 million / mile ( us $ 20 million / km , equivalent to $ 20 million / mile or $ 30 million / km ) 2015 ). when the freeway was completed , it was the first in the state of michigan to have a spui sign at the wilson avenue interchange . some of the traffic and the barrier walls were painted dark green as part of a " new look " to the freeway . mdot also used a special drill to drill the metric holes into the concrete , helping to reduce the risk that vehicles would set them off . the measurements measured in metric , and " the entire m @ - @ 6 freeway was designed and built in minutes " , according to mdot spokesperson suzette peplinski . the new freeway opened to traffic on december 1 , 2004 . = = = = = construction = = = = mdot added the designation m @ - @ 6 to the state map in an initial update in december 2005 . at the time , the state state highway services system did not have a complete freeway in eastern wayne and western wayne counties . agencies such as google and yahoo ! maps rely on tele maps services of new york for their map data , which , in turn , relies on services like mdot to produce their data . mdot ' s initial update came only only two months after the freeway printing due to its inclusion in a m @ - @ 6 update to the state highway map . a year after the freeway opened , traffic volumes on major streets like 55th , 56th and 68th streets increased by – ##0 % . at the same time , intersections with roads on the freeway also increased traffic . wilson avenue experienced a 50 % increase and parts of byron center avenue increased 100 % in traffic only a year after the @ - @ 6 opened . property values in the neighborhoods along the freeway increased by @ . @ 4 – ##0 @ . @ 0 % in 2006 as a result of traffic related to the freeway . many residents praised the freeway for improving access to the suburbs , reducing housing costs as residents moved to the suburbs for their jobs and quality of life . in 2007 , the metro health village , a commercial development centered on the byron center avenue mall and the hospital opened . described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a feature , the development features restaurants , shops , offices and a pharmacy . metro health moved from grand rapids to the hospital in 2008 in the face of opposition to future expansion of their current location . since then , even though the freeway is originally named for patrick allen , the old allen beltline name is still in use . reactions to the new name were not entirely positive . in a 2008 article in the the grand rapidsshortly after the freeway opened in 2004 , area journalist john macdougall addressed the issue of the new freeway . he cited the loss of agricultural land and trees as a side impact of the freeway . the mayor also stated that the freeway will improve travel times for area residents , but it will require more development . that development will cause more urban development , and could delay the construction of other roads in the area . the m @ - @ 6 trail was included as a $ 2 @ . @ 5 million project ( equivalent to $ 5 million in 2015 ) that began in 2008 . the project was to create a 3 @ - @ . @ - @ mile ( 10 @ . @ . m ) path connecting the rail trail with the # ##ding dong trail . the m @ - @ 6 trail was the idea of wayne ##ville resident john hilton , sr . who had hoped to have the trail included in the new freeway project and completed with the opening of the wayne beltline . the freeway project was funded by $ 2 @ . @ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 3 @ . @ 5 million in 2015 ) from federal dollars and $ 2 @ , @ 000 ( equivalent to $ 350 @ , @ 000 in 2015 ) from the frederik and marie meijer foundation . the grants came from the county and the state . construction on the freeway was completed in late 2008 . in 2009 , the section portion of m @ - @ 6 had to be rebuilt . this section of road between west michigan avenue and main street was rated poor by the michigan highway and transportation department , but the section section of broadmoor avenue received good ratings . mdot provided $ 1 million in repairs on top of the m @ - @ 6 repairs that were done by the same general contractor under a contract in 2006 . the associated press described the 7 @ . @ foot @ - @ mile ( 4 @ . @ 0 m ) section of roadway as " dangerous " in relation to air quality issues . legislation was signed by governor rick snyder on july 9 , 2014 , to name the section of m @ -
