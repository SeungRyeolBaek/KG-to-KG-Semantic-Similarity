" they just want to eat me " was omitted due to yankovic ' s personal dislike of the song , as his record company had asked him to record it in order to promote how to be funny album in 1985 . also missing from the album was " burger king . " the song had originally been intended for off the deep end . however , yankovic decided to replace " burger king " with " i was only joking " — a song he had already recorded for his previous album — at the last minute ; this forced yankovic to drop " burger king " for the time being . the song was later included on " smells like chicken " instead , as well as yankovic ' s third studio album , alapalooza , which was released several years after the original album . = = = = = = = the album was released by scotti brothers records and was only begrudgingly accepted by yankovic . at the time , scotti brothers records planned on putting out a compilation album by yankovic in order to meet sales obligations for the third year , despite the fact that a new album was planned ; alapalooza would not be released until later in the year . the original plan was to release a compilation titled # ##bino , which would have featured a cover of yankovic holding the sign for his kitchen appliances , and instead of being a compilation album of live performances , it would have featured dj remixes of previously released songs , with the musical credits removed . yankovic asked them to release the food album as — " a song [ he ] loves only the , " — and would later describe it as a " fun song " put out " against [ his ] better judgment and wishes . " the tv album was released under similar circumstances in 1995 ; however , when it came time to release the food album , yankovic said that " the record company was a whole lot different when they tried the first album " , and that there was " more money [ and ] more pressure " . between the release of the food album and the tv album — in addition to the two greatest hits compilations that had been released — scotti brothers made @ - @ as one of their only albums in yankovic ' s contract , which delayed the release of both albums when capitol records terminated his contract in the early 1990s . = = = = = = = the cover artwork — which depicts a large dog after it has eaten yankovic — was designed by doug williams , who is also credited as "mr . alien " , an american child actor , comedian , writer , storyboard artist , producer and musician . the " food " title was yankovic ' s " press @ - @ chart response " against his label for putting out the alien ; yankovic considered the cover , " depicted the rotting head of weird al , " to be a reference to his record label " suck [ ing ] his mouth out " before releasing the album . the japanese version of the album , however , featured slightly different artwork , as well as a title track ; because there was an " food " in the album title , the album was retitled the alien . = = = = = = = = chart reception = = = the food album has received mixed reviews from music critics ; many felt that while the album was successful it was not an adequate release . allmusic reviewer johnny loftus gave the album three out of five stars and wrote that , " the food album is an excellent collection of songs . just don ' t eat too much , or you ' ll probably get sick .
