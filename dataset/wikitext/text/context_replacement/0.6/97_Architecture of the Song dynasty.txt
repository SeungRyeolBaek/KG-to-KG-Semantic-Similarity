= architecture of the song . = the architecture of the song dynasty ( 960 – 1279 ) was known for its magnificent stone buildings , beautiful stone and brick temples , beautiful gardens , and magnificent palaces . although written works on architecture existed earlier , architectural theory evolved during the song dynasty , developing into a more systematic discipline that standardized design and construction methods in a systematic , systematic way . in addition to the works currently extant , references in wall paintings , architectural records , and references in history books can aid architectural historians in understanding the architecture of the song . the professions of architect , master carpenter , engineer , and civil engineer did not have the high status of the other @ @ - @ professions during the song period . architectural knowledge had been passed down generations for thousands of years , passing from their fathers to their sons . there were many government offices and schools for science , architecture , and engineering . the song dynasty ' s building codes regulated not only the local court architects , but also the architects employed by the central government . = = city and country = = the layout of the city walls , such as bianjing , capital of the southern song , follows the description of kao shi ##jing , which described a circular city wall with five gates on each side and reserved for the citizens . the walled city of the bianjing was rebuilt during the reign of emperor shenzong to a rectangular structure , roughly square in shape , measuring 5 km ( 3 @ . @ 3 mi ) from north to south and 7 km ( 4 @ . @ 4 mi ) from west to east . the south wall had five gates , with nanxun gate in the center , chenzhou gate to the east , and dailou gate to the west . the inner walls had four gates each : in the east wall , dongshui gate ( at the south end ) , xinsong gate , xinchao gate , and the @ - @ east water gate ; in the west wall xinzheng gate , west water gate , wansheng gate , and guzi gate ; and in the south wall chenqiao gate ( at the south end ) , fengqiu gate , the wild goose gate and weizhou gate . the gates in the middle of each of the four walls were reserved for the citizens ; these walls had straight passages and had two sets of gates , while the inner city walls had straight passages and were protected by two sets of gates . the chinese painter zhang zeduan ' s painting ofthe exhibition during the qingming period described the dongshui temple in detail : the building on top had a five @ - @ bracket roof with a steep ##le in the song dynasty style , supported internally by two rows of brackets ( dougong ) . the lower bracket assembly rested on the outer wall to form a solid base , while the upper bracket supported the wall , similar to the dougong of an earlier buddhist temple , the grand temple in beijing . this method of using bracket roofs to support walls is described in li jie ' s five @ - @ - ce manual yingzao fashi de pingzuo ( [UNK] " solid foundation " ) . the city wall itself was constructed with rammed earth , a method also described in yingzao fashi , vol . 1 , " manual for building , engineering and construction techniques " : description : for every square peg , give two dan of earth ; on top of this , a heap of red bricks , earth and precious stones , giving two dan . for every five @ - @ cun layer of earth , two men , standing face to face , should pound six times with earth , each man pounding six times on the peg ; then , six times on each side , two men , standing face to face , each pounding twice on the square peg ; then , six more times , each man pounding twice . after this , fill the dent with earth and then with stones , to fill in the dent . every five @ - @ cun layer of earth should be equal to three cun ; every five @ - @ cun layer of earth and stones to three and a half cun . five @ - @ bracket walls during this period were thick : the thickness of the wall is constant at the base and increases gradually with the height , as described in li jie ' s manual . during the song dynasty , the city of bianjing had three walls : the outer city wall , the inner city wall , and the palace in the south . the inner wall was rectangular , with four towers on each corner . the outer wall was also rectangular , with a square peg at each of the four corners . it had four main gates : xihua gate to the west , donghua gate to the east , gongchen gate to the north , and xuande gate , also known as duan gate or xuandelou , to the south . xuande gate had five @ - @ iron doors , painted red and covered with iron plates ; thethey were also decorated with dragon , eagle and sparrow @ - @ bird designs to complement the wooden fences , stone walls and sparrow @ - @ bird roofs . there were also two stone dragons , each at the top of the roof ridge , its tail pointing to the east . the symbolic significance of these chi wei was described in yingzao fashi : there is a dragon of the east river , whose tail ( [UNK] ) is similar to that of a sparrow @ - @ bird ( [UNK] ) ; it breaks the waves and causes floods , so they put its tail on the wall to prevent flooding . therefore , they called it " sparrow @ - @ bird wall " ( chi wei ) . extending south from xuande gate was the imperial boulevard , about one hundred metres long , with the imperial palace on each side . it had existed along the boulevard until 1112 , when they were closed . two rows of wooden fences were erected in the middle of the boulevard as a barrier to pedestrians and vehicles . along the southern wall of the boulevard were the first @ - @ era stone water tanks , filled with water . about 90 metres ( [UNK] @ , @ 300 ft ) south from xuande gate , the bian river crossed the imperial boulevard , which passed directly under the great stone bridge , balustraded and [UNK] @ - @ shaped . this idea of a city with a stone bridge over the river was also used in the forbidden city . during spring and summer , the peach , plum , pear and plum trees decorate the banks of the bian with a garland of flowers . = = buddhist pagoda = = during the reign of the han dynasty , ( 202 - – 220 ad ) , the concept of the buddhist pagoda entered chinese culture , as a way to preserve and protect buddhist texts . during the southern and northern dynasties period , the modern chinese pagoda was developed , its predecessors being the five bell pagoda and the bell towers of the tang dynasty ( as seen from inscriptions in the @ - @ era records ) . during the sui ( 581 – 618 ) and tang ( 618 – 907 ) dynasties , chinese pagoda ##s transformed from simple wooden structures to fully constructed stone and brick , which could more easily withstand damage caused by lightning or earthquakes and were less susceptible to fire . the oldest chinese pagoda that is known is the songyue pagoda , built in 523 , and a notable example of a # @ - @ era brick pagoda is the great white lotus pagoda ,built in 652 . although buddhist influence in china declined during the late tang dynasty , cast iron pagoda ##s were built during the song dynasty . cast iron pagoda were often built in the countryside rather than within the city ' s walls , perhaps to avoid conflicts with the iron @ - @ iron architecture embodied by the monks ' @ - and pagoda @ - @ architecture . the great wild boar pagoda , located in a forest outside of what was then chang ' an , is among the earliest . the iron pagoda of youguo temple , kaifeng takes its name from the cast @ - @ iron construction of the glazed bricks on the walls . originally built of iron by the monk yu ##wen , it was struck by lightning and burned down in 1044 , during the northern song dynasty . in 1049 the pagoda was rebuilt as it stands today , by the order of emperor renzong of song . this cast @ - @ iron pagoda , built on an octagonal base , stands 69 @ . @ 2 m ( 186 @ . @ 6 ft ) tall . the glazed iron walls feature elaborate carvings of buddha ##s , lay people , and seated monks ( see gallery below ) . the chinese also produced large cast @ - @ iron structures , such as the iron pagoda of yuquan temple ( hot ##an pagoda ) , dangyang , hubei province . built in 1061 , it uses 41 @ , @ 848 kg ( 118 @ , @ 715 lb ) of cast iron and stands 21 @ . @ 2 m ( 69 @ . @ 6 ft ) tall . like earlier wooden , stone , and brick structures , the pagoda has wide walls and an octagonal base . another iron pagoda was built in 1105 , jining , shandong , and was built layer upon layer in three stages , standing 22 meters tall . several large cast iron pagoda exist in china today . the liuhe pagoda , or the lantern pagoda , is an example of cast @ - @ iron pagoda ##s . it is located in the northern chinese capital of nanjing , in zhejiang province , at the foot of yuelun hill on the qiantang peninsula . although the pagoda was begun in 1121 , the lantern pagoda was begun in 1156 and was completed in 1165 . it is 46 @ . @ 15 m ( 196 @ . @ 49 ft ) tall , and is constructed from a square octagonal base with three stories of thick walls . because of its height , the pagoda served as a floating beacon to aid navigation at sea ( as seen in the fu z##hi ) . the zhengjue pagoda , in pengxian county of sichuan province ( now chengdu ) is a wooden pagoda that was built between 1023 and 1026 , according to inscriptions found on its first floor . it has a square base on a sumeru platform , three stories and 28 m ( 92 ft ) in height , and three floors of walls similar in design to the other two pagoda of chang ' an , the great wild goose pagoda and the little wild goose pagoda . wooden @ - @ and @ - @ - @ towers were also built . the first three floors of the octagonal , 42 m ( 138 ft ) lingxiao pagoda of 1045 are brick ( with no mortar ) , and from the fourth floor on it is entirely made of wood . some structures made of stone or wood have decorative elements that are typical of chinese wooden buildings ; for example the pizhi pagoda , built from 1056 to 1063 , uses the dougong style typical of wooden buildings to hold up flat , wooden roofs and walls . all of these structures feature spiral stairs , although the lingxiao pagoda ' s stairs lead to the fourth floor , and the pizhi pagoda ' s to the ninth . additionally , the pizhi pagoda has two spiral stairs that provide access to the ninth and tenth floors . although the pagoda of fogong temple is the tallest chinese wooden pagoda , the tallest wooden pagoda built during the tang dynasty that remains standing is the liaodi pagoda . built in 1055 , it is 84 m ( 276 ft ) tall , with an octagonal base and a square pedestal , unlike the wooden @ - @ - ( 226 ft ) qianxun pagoda , which had held the position since its construction in the 7th century in the reign of tang . although the liaodi pagoda served its original function as a guard pagoda for the kaiyuan temple of # ##cheng , sichuan province , its great height gave it a secondary role , as a military watch ##tower that was used to monitor movements of the approaching armies . beside their use for defense , pagoda towers could also serve as astronomical towers ; an example is the gaocheng ##shan tower , completed in 1276 and still standing today . yunyan pagoda = = = = = it was not uncommon for wealthy or noble families to finance the construction of buddhist pagoda towers , usually by giving a portion of their own land to a buddhist monastery . often the only grant was money that could be used @ - @ -for more see . the fei ( [UNK] ) family of the town of jinze , located just north of beijing , converted a building on their estate into a large double @ - @ recitiation hall , and later built several other religious buildings around the town . this sparked a boom in temple construction in the area , leading jinze to become a major center of the white lotus school of buddhism , which in turn spurred the construction of other temples and allowed the town to become a major center of the religion . the nearby town of nanxiang gained importance soon after the fall of the song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings , which served the southern song empire . aside from encouraging the development of urban life , temples and religious buildings have a number of distinctive architectural and artistic features . the temple of the venerable mother ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) and the hall of worship of the jin temple ( [UNK] [UNK] ) , located in the eastern part of the town , shanxi province , are notable examples of early song architecture . the temple of the venerable mother is the main hall of the jin temple , originally built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and completed in 1102 . it has a double @ - @ eaved roof with two gables , and two double @ - @ towers with double @ - @ @ mouths at the top of the central tower . the roof is supported by four dougong , similar to those by yingzao fashi . the towers of the temple of the venerable mother slope upward slightly at each end , a feature of song architecture . the walls of the hall , decorated with arches that coil around the tower , become progressively taller with increasing height to either side of the central tower . the entrance has a roof over it , the earliest example of such a structure ; another distinctive feature of the temple is the double @ - @ @ staircase that leads to the lotus pond . the main hall of xuan ##ling temple ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] ) , located on the outskirts of suzhou city , is an example of song architecture . in 1982 , it was designated as a cultural heritage site by the chinese government . the jade palace ( [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] , jing ##ling ) , a monument to the great jade , located on double @ - @ mount qufu , was built in the 11th century . it was largely destroyed at the end of the song dynasty . however , several other structures in shou qiu , the area that the palace was located in , remain standing . the " jing@ - @ borne stones mark what is the entrance to the tomb . one of the oldest bridges , the one of the year of [UNK] @ , @ 000 , is over 52 metres ( 171 ft ) high , the highest stone monument in the world . a large tomb made of large stone blocks , the imperial tomb of the yellow emperor ' s consort shaohao , is located in the shou qiu district . an ancient stone [UNK] @ - @ borne stone of the neolithic era has been found in the dai valley of mount tai . = = = = = bridges over rivers have been built in china since the late shang dynasty . during the song dynasty , large wooden bridges were built , such as that built by zhang zhongyan in 1158 . there were also wooden bridges made out of wood , like the wu zi bridge of shaoxing , built in 1256 and still standing today . bridges with stones on their outer spans are also depicted in such works as the bridge of xia river ( 1195 – 1224 ) . large , elaborate wooden bridges , like the 12th @ - @ @ long bridge in wuyuan , jiangxi province , which has four [UNK] @ - @ shaped spans and a wooden superstructure , were also built . while working as an engineer for china , the engineer su shi ( 1037 – 1101 ) had a wooden covered bridge built across the east river , which still bears his name : sudi ( [UNK] [UNK] ) . in 1221 , the chinese traveler qiu changchun visited genghis khan in mongolia , describing the wooden bridges built on the way up to the tian shan mountains , north of yining . the historian joseph needham quotes him as saying : [ the mongols built ] " no less than four wooden bridges of such length that two horses could ride over them side by side " . these had been built by chang jung [ zhang rong ] and the other sons of the emperor some time before . the wooden bridges of chinese cities from the − 4th century [ ad ] , are no doubt similar to those said to have been found in julius caesar ' s bridge of − 3rd [ century ] across the rhine , perhaps built by romans , and found in cities in italy . but where in + 4th century [ ad ] , could a four @ - @ long bridge like chang jung ' s have been built ? in fujian province , many wooden bridges were built during the song dynasty . some of these were four -and [UNK] @ , @ 220 m ( 720 @ , @ 000 ft ) , with stone spans of up to 22 m ( 72 ft ) in length ; their construction required hundreds of weights of 203 tonnes ( 203 @ , @ 000 ft ) . no names of the engineers are known or mentioned in the inscriptions on the bridges , which contain only the names of the officials who designed them and supervised their construction and maintenance . alternatively , there may have been an engineering school in fujian , headed by a chinese engineer known as cai xiang ( 1012 – 1067 ) , who had risen to the position of county magistrate of fujian . between 1053 and 1059 , he designed and supervised the construction of the famous wanan bridge ( also called the fujian bridge ) near quanzhou ( on the border of the ship @ - @ era luojiang county and huai ' an ) . this bridge , a stone structure similar to a number of other bridges built in fujian , still stands , and has ship @ - @ era spans attached to their sides using stone from fujian as an anchor . it measures 731 m ( 3 @ , @ 398 ft ) in length , 5 m ( 16 ft ) in width , and 7 m ( 23 ft ) in height . another famous bridge in quanzhou , the anping bridge , was built between 1138 and 1151 . other examples of stone bridges include guyue bridge , a stone arch bridge in yiwu , zhejiang province . the bridge was built in 1213 , the first year of the jiading era of the northern song dynasty . ship @ - @ era stone bridges include the dongjin bridge , 600 m ( 1 ⁄ 2 mi ) long , which can still be seen today . = = mausoleum of the northern song . = = = south of gongyi temple in gongxian county , henan province , the imperial tombs of the northern song number over a thousand , including the tombs for the emperors , kings , princes , queens , queens , and members of the imperial family . the complex measures about 6 km ( 4 @ . @ 0 mi ) from east to west and 8 km ( 5 @ . @ 5 mi ) from north to south . the construction of the mausoleum began in 963 ad , during the reign of the northern song emperor , emperor taizu of song , whose family is also buried at the site . the only two song emperors not buried there are emperor huizong of song and emperor qinzong of song , who died in battle in the ju##rchen ##g of the song in 1127 . within the entrance hall of the tomb there are hundreds of stone sculptures and paintings of dragons , tigers , lions , horses with horns , wild boar and other animals , court officials , military personnel , foreign dignitaries , and others , in an impressive display of song @ - @ style art . the design and construction of the underground tombs resemble those found in the earlier tangut tombs of the western xia , which also had an important burial site associated with the tomb . at the center of the burial site is a large burial mound , probably having originally been surrounded by a song @ - @ style enclosure with four entrance gates and four corner gates . about 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) from gongxian is the baisha tomb , which contains " many elements and style of the timber ##work architecture , from door frames to pillars and beams to drum bases , that form the walls . " the baisha tomb has four large underground chambers with flat roofs ; a spiral staircase leads up to the main chamber of the main chamber . = = = = = during the song dynasty , the works on architecture were expanded to more detailed levels of detail , culminating in yili shigong , written by li ruogui in 1193 ad . one of the most important works , however , is the famous mu jing ( " timberwork pagoda " ) , attributed to yu , and written sometime between 965 and 995 . yu also was responsible for the construction of the wooden pagoda temple in kaifeng , which was destroyed by fire and replaced by the famous stone pagoda soon after . in his time , works on architecture were generally considered a minor artistic achievement due to the subject ' s complexity , and mu jing was not even included in the song dynasty canon . although the work itself is lost to history , the architect and scholar shen kuo wrote of yu ' s work , in his reflecting art book of 1088 , describing it as a classic of architectural science , noting that no one in his own time could write such a work . shen kuo points to , among other things , a passage in which yu himself gives advice to an song @ - @ student about the angles in order to support the pagoda against the ground , and a passage in which yu himself describes the individual sections of the pagoda , the area under the pagoda , the area above them , and the roof , and then proceeds to describe the proportions and construction methods for each section . several otherarchitect li jie ( 李 [UNK] ; 1065 – 1110 ) wrote yingzao fashi ( " treatise on building practices " or " imperial building standards " ) . although other works existed before it , such as yingshan ##shi ( " imperial building standards " ) of the late tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) , li ' s book is the oldest extant treatise on chinese architecture to have survived in writing . = = = yingzao fashi = = = yingzao fashi was a chinese treatise on architecture and construction written by li jie , an architect and official at the ministry of buildings and works . he wrote the book in 1100 , and submitted it to emperor zhezong of song in the first year of his reign . his successor , emperor huizong of song , had li ' s book officially published two years later , in 1103 , for the use of officials , merchants , and skilled craftsmen . the book was intended to provide building standards , to not only the ruling elite of the song court , but also the other noble and merchant classes of china who could benefit from having a pre @ - @ standard ##ised treatise on building practices . yingzao fashi included building codes and regulations , technical specifications , descriptions of building techniques , and specifications of materials . in its early stages , the book covered units of measurement , and the construction of buildings , walls , masonry , and bridges . for the architects , it provided instructions for building floor patterns with horizontal planes and instructions for vaults and arches . it also included instructions for # ##working , cutting , carving , stone cutting , painting , wall painting , and painting . the book included instructions for making tiles , paints , and ceramics , and detailed methods for making bricks used in masonry , . . , and manufacture of glazed bricks , building codes and regulations with illustrations . his book described structural elements in great detail , including the technical specifications for raw materials . ; . . li developed a new pre @ - @ grade system for all structural elements , known as the cai @ - @ grade system of grading , which could be widely used throughout china . about 90 % of li jie ' s knowledge was derived from pre @ - @ grade raw materials for construction , while the majority of the rest used the local knowledge of craftsmen and artisans . the yingzao fashi was a comprehensive list of construction materials that included mathematical formulas , building codes , and building techniques , and described the construction of the localand for buildings on a particular scale . he also calculated the labor costs of employing workers of different skill and from different regions on the basis of a day ' s work , in proportion to the quality of the materials they would use and according to the manner in which they were to be used . = = illustrations for song dynasty = =
