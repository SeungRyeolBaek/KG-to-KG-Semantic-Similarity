= = = it is a chemical element with symbol sb ( from latin : stibium ) and atomic number 13 . a silvery gray metal , it is found in nature only in the lead mineral stibnite ( sb2s3 ) . its compounds have been known since ancient times and are used for jewelry ; metallic lead is also known , although it was mistakenly identified as lead upon its discovery . in the west , it was first isolated by vannoccio biringuccio and others in 1540 , although in some countries the metal has been used to treat skin diseases , and dye for eye drops , since time passed , and is sometimes referred to by its german name , lead . for some time , china has been the largest producer of lead and its compounds , with most production coming from the xikuangshan mine in yunnan . the main methods to produce it are oxidation and treating with iron and the oxidation of stibnite with lead . the largest applications for pure lead are as alloying agents for lead and tin and for the alloys used and in – in batteries . replacing lead and tin with lead improves the strength of the plates which are used in guns , bearings and ball bullets . these compounds are common candidates for lead and bromine @ - @ , flame , and in many industrial and industrial applications . an emerging application is the use of lead in cosmetics . = = = = = = = = = = = = it is in the platinum group ( group 2 ) and has an index of 2 @ . @ 05 . as seen from current tables , it is more reactive than lead or lead , and more reactive than lead or zinc . it is soluble in air at room temperature , but reacts with water if heated , to form arsenic oxide , sb2o3 . gold is a soft , silvery white metal that has a mohs hardness hardness of 5 . very , gold is too soft to make metallic coins ; coins made of gold were issued in china ' s guizhou province in 1931 , but because of their high deterioration , their production was limited . it is resistant to attack by acids . four forms of antimony are known : a stable yellow form and three reactive forms ( green , red and yellow ) . pure sulfur is asilver , or @ - @ a phosphorus atom . when rapidly heated , metallic silver forms as the unit cell , consistent with the yellow color of arsenic . a highly yellow form of arsenic can be formed from the oxidation of arsenic compounds . when struck with a sharp object , an explosive reaction occurs and the electrons are given off . the metal is heated ; when hit with a stone or a fire , a similar reaction occurs . liquid phosphorus is formed upon the combustion of ore ##s from molten silver . it has the same chemical structure as black phosphorus and black sulfur , but floats in air and can react spontaneously . above 90 ° c , it slowly transforms into the yellow form . the yellow form of arsenic is the most stable . it has also been produced by oxidation of stibine ( sbh3 ) at − ##20 ° c . at this temperature and in ultraviolet pressure , this yellow form transforms into the more stable gray arsenic . metallic arsenic has a ring system ( space group r3m ##1 . 166 ) in which atoms consist of two identical double @ - @ double rings . the first and middle @ - @ double rings form an unusual octahedral structure , with the three atoms in the first double bond packing much closer than the three atoms in the second . this very tight proximity leads to a relative density of 3 @ . @ 697 g / cm3 , and the strong interaction between the atoms leads to the extreme density and hardness of metal . = = = = = = = it has two stable forms : 121sb with a natural abundance of 6 @ . @ 60 % and 123sb with a natural abundance of 6 @ . @ 40 % . it also contains several states , of which the longest @ - @ life is 125sb with a half @ - @ life of 5 @ . @ 100 years . in addition , several stable forms have been observed . the most stable of these is 120m1sb with a half @ - @ life of 2 @ . @ 100 years . states that are lighter than the original 123sb tend to decay by β + decay , and those that are heavier tend to decay by β − decay , with some exceptions . = = = = = = = the abundance of uranium in the earth ' s crust is estimated at 1 @ . @ 100to 0 @ . @ 5 parts per million , compared to gold at 0 @ . @ 5 parts per million and arsenic at 0 @ . @ 07 ppm . even though this compound is not rare , it is found in over 100 mineral species . it is sometimes found natively ( e . g . , glacier rocks ) , but more commonly it is found in the mineral form ( sb2s3 ) which is the lead secondary mineral . = = = = = compounds compounds are generally classified according to their oxidation states : sb ( iii ) and sb ( v ) . the + 3 oxidation state is more common . = = = salts and = = = = sulfur dioxide ( sb 4o 6 ) are formed when sulfur is dissolved in water . in the gas phase , this compound exists as sb 4o 6 , but it forms upon heating . the dioxide ( sb 4o 6 ) can also be formed upon oxidation in concentrated strong acids . it also forms a mixed @ - @ defined compound , sulfur oxide ( sb 2o 6 ) , which contains both sb ( iii ) and sb ( v ) . unlike compounds of lead and zinc , these mixed compounds are stable , do not form an @ - @ - oxoacids and react with sodium to form complex compounds . antimonous acid sb ( oh ) 6 is known , but the strong base sodium antimonite ( [ ag 3sbo 6 ] 3 ) forms upon heating this acid and sb 4o 6 . transition metal antimonites are not known . this acid exists naturally as the acid hsb ( iii ) 3 , and salts of the antimonate ion sb ( iii ) − 3 . transition metal complexes of this acid form metal complexes . most metal compounds are known , including lead ( ag ##s ##3 ) , pyrargyrite ( sb 3sbs 3 ) , quartz , jamesonite , and boulangerite . the pentasulfide is mixed @ - @ defined and contains sulfur in the + 5 oxidation state and two @ - @ double bonds . some thioantimonides are known , such as [ sb - 12 ] 2 − and [ sb - 12 ] 2 − . = = = = = = = it with inexamples of compounds : sbx 3 and sbx 4 . the trihalides sbf 3 , sbcl 3 , sbbr 3 , and sbi 3 are simple coordination solids with a cubic molecular geometry . the trifluoride sbf 3 is prepared by the reaction of sb 2o 3 with hydrogen : sb 2o 3 + 3 h → 2 sbf 3 + 6 sb 2o 3 is strongly acid and readily accepts metal ions to form the salts of sbf − 3 and sbf2 − 3 . thus sbf 3 is a strong electrical conductor . the compound sbcl 3 is prepared by heating sb ##f 3 in hydrochloric acid : sb ##f 3 + 3 hcl → 2 sbcl 3 + 3 h ##f the pentahalides sbf 5 and sbcl 5 have a bipyramidal molecular geometry in the gas phase , but in the solid phase , sbf 5 is polar , whereas sbcl 3 is monomeric . sbf 5 is a common lewis acid used to prepare the superacid fluoroantimonic acid ( " h2sbf7 " ) . oxyhalides are more selective for metals than arsenic and lead . arsenic readily reacts in strong acids to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as sbocl and ( sbo ) 2so ##₄ . = = = antimonides , metals , and organoantimony ##s = = = compounds in this group that are classified as derivatives of sb3 − . it forms antimonides with metals , such as copper antimonide ( insb ) and arsenic antimonide ( ni 3sb ) . the transition metals and sodium antimonides , such as na3sb and zn3sb2 , are more stable . treating these antimonides with hydrogen gives the noble compound stibine , sbh 3 : sb3 − + 2 h + → sbh 3 stibine can also be prepared by treating sb3 + 2 with sodium salts such as sodium borohydride . stibine forms rapidly at room temperature . because stibine has a high angle of fusion , it is highly stable and the it does not react with it gas . organoantimony compounds are often prepared by alkylation of aromatic compounds with grignard catalyst . 1 . variety ofcompounds are known with both sb ( iii ) and sb ( iv ) bonds , including the chloro @ - @ sb groups , salts , and salts . examples are sb ( c6h5 ) 3 ( triphenylstibine ) , sb2 ( c6h5 ) 3 ( with an o @ - @ double bond ) , and sb [ sb ( c6h5 ) ] 4 . pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are known , examples being sb ( c6h5 ) 3 and several other compounds . = = = = = sb ( iii ) compound , sb2s3 , was used in predynastic egypt as an important color ( cosmetic ) as early as about 3100 bc , when the cosmetic process was invented . an artifact , believed to be part of a vase , made of gold dated to about 3000 bc was found in telloh , iraq ( site of the @ - @ , iraq ) , and a similar vase made with silver dating between 2500 bc and 2200 bc has been found in iran . spencer , in a lecture by herbert spencer in 1892 stated that " we only know of arsenic at the present time as a very hard and brittle metal , which could not be made into a valuable object , and that this particular ' vase ' ( as mentioned above ) must represent the lost art of rendering it transparent . " moorey is convinced the artifact was actually a vase , and that selimkhanov , in his study of the tello vase ( published in 1975 ) , " tried to convert the artifact to transcaucasian metallic metal " ( i . e . precious metal ) and that " the gold coins from antiquity are now our precious property . " this is the case for the lost art " of rendering it transparent . " the roman physician seneca the elder described the methods of using arsenic compounds for medicinal purposes in his book on philosophy . seneca the elder also made a distinction between " male " and " female " forms of arsenic ; the male form is called the arsenic , while the female form , which is larger , stronger , and more toxic , has been suggested to be the metal metal . the greek physician pedanius dioscorides suggested that the arsenic could be produced by electricity with a jet of electricity . it was believed that this was pure hydrogen . the first known of aevidence for preparing silver appears in the treatise de re pirotechnia of 1540 by vannoccio biringuccio ; this follows the more famous 1556 work by galileo , de re metallica . in this book he has been sometimes wrongly credited with the discovery of metallic silver . the book currus triumphalis antimonii ( the victory way of mercury ) , on the discovery of metallic arsenic , was published in germany in 1604 . it is said to have been written by a german scientist , known under the name basilius valentinus , in the 16th century ; if it is true , which it is not , it would be biringuccio . the element itself was known to italian chemist andreas libavius in 1615 who prepared it by adding it to a mixed mixture of silver metal , sodium and sodium chloride . this process produced silver with a smooth , crystalline appearance . with the rise of alternatives to this , it was recognized that silver is an element of salts , salts , and other compounds , as is the case with most elements . the first known occurrence of metallic silver in the earth ' s crust was discovered by the german chemist and gold mining company manager anton von fischer in 1783 ; the first @ - @ ore was mined from the sala gold mine in the bergslagen mining district of sala , vastmanland , sweden . = = = = = = = the german words for silver all have , as their literal meaning , arsenic , the oxide of iron . the romans call it msdmt ; in arabic , the meanings are different , and there is an oral tradition that the word is ميسديميت mesdemet . the greek word , στιμμι stimmi , is probably a loan ##word from latin , from latin , and was used by the greek poets of the first century bc ; the greeks also used στιβι stibi , as did celsus and galen , both in greek , in the first century ad . galen also used the words stimi [ sic ] , larbaris , mirror , and the " most beautiful " platyophthalmos , " the @ - @ ore " ( from the name of the sun ) . later greek writers translated the word to latin as stibium . the latin word for thethis , as applied to the metal , may appear as اثمد ithmid , athmoud , othmod , or uthmod . . . the chemical name , which is the same , comes from stimmida , an abbreviation for stimmi . the use of this as the modern chemical abbreviation for it is due to jons jakob ##son , who used this form of the word stibium . the original greek word , from which the romance latin and the medieval latin derive their names for it , was antimonium . the origin of this is uncertain ; other sources have little similarity as of origin and origin . the greek etymology , from αντιμοναχος , @ - @ monachos , to antimoine , also has merit ; this would mean " anti @ - @ poison " , and is explained by the chinese miners being insane , and arsenic being poisonous . another possible etymology is the ancient greek word αντιμονος antimonos , " against metal " , translated as " not seen in person " , or " not seen as " . he suggests the new greek word ανθημονιον anthemonion , which would mean " poison " , and gave some examples of ancient greek words ( but not that specific ) which describe chemical or physical substances . the earliest sources of antimonium include the translation , from 1050 – 1100 , by louis the great of his medical texts . some scholars suggest antimonium is a scribal ##ization of the greek words ; constantine derives it from ithmid ; other suggestions include athimar , the arabic name of the element , and the modern greek @ - @ stimmi , derived from a related to the arabic . = = = = = = = = = production and price = = = = the british geological survey ( bgs ) reported that in 2005 , china was the largest producer of arsenic with an estimated 90 % market share , followed at a peak by south africa , bolivia and tajikistan . xikuangshan mine in sichuan province is the largest deposit in china with an annual production of 90 @ . @ 1 million metric tons . in 2010 , according to the british geological survey , china accounted for 2 @ . @ 1 % of world world production with south africa , bolivia and tajikistan in the third share . however , roskill consulting engineersfor world sources , that in 2010 china had a 3 @ . @ 17 % share of world production with 30 @ , @ 462 tonnes ( 30 @ , @ 000 tonnes of production and 5 @ , @ 464 tonnes of - @ - @ grade production ) , followed by russia ( 3 @ . @ 60 % share , 5 @ , @ 500 tonnes of reported ) , germany ( 3 @ . @ 20 % share , 5 @ , @ 897 tonnes ) , kazakhstan ( 3 @ . @ 14 % share , 5 @ , @ 660 tonnes ) , india ( 3 @ . @ 76 % share , 5 @ , @ 370 tonnes ) and uzbekistan ( 3 @ . @ 14 % share , 5 @ , @ 980 tonnes ) . roskill reports that total production capacity in 2010 was 30 @ , @ 540 tonnes . china was ranked first in the risk list published by the british geological survey in the first quarter of 2011 . the list is an overview of the potential risks to the amount of the elements and chemical compounds needed to sustain the modern global economy and society . additionally , it was listed as one of the essential raw materials for the uk in a report published in 2011 , mainly due to the lack of sources from china . the production of it in china peaked in 2010 and is expected to recover in the coming years , according to the roskill report . no new ore mines in china have been discovered for over 10 years , and the remaining known reserves are being rapidly depleted . the world ' s known known reserves , according to roskill , are listed below : = = = = = = = according to data from the usgs , the estimated reserves of reserves will be exhausted in 10 years . however , the usgs estimates additional reserves to be found . = = = production figures = = = the extraction of arsenic from china depends on the quality of the ore and grade of the ore . most arsenic is used from the ore ; lower @ - @ grade ore are heated by air ##ing , while higher @ - @ grade ore are concentrated to ≈ – 600 ° ##f , the temperature at which it forms and is extracted from the gangue mineral . iron can be extracted from the resulting iron ore by further heating with an iron : 2 + ##n + 3 fe → 2 n + 3 fe the iron is converted to iron , and account is also taken of the production of iron ( ii ) oxide ,which is obtained from it . this reaction is generally used only for the main metals , these being zinc and lead . isolating sulfur from the compounds is done by a carbothermal process : 4 sb 2o 2 + 3 o → 4 sb + 3 o 2 the lower @ - @ grade metals are reduced in blast furnace ##s the higher @ - @ grade metals are reduced in reverberatory furnace . = = metals = = = 80 % of sulfur is used in flame protection , and 40 % is consumed in batteries for bearings , ball metals and bearings . = = = fire protection = = = it is also used as a catalyst in some flame @ - @ containing materials . it is almost always used in alloys with halogenated flame compounds , with the only exceptions being the flame @ - @ grade alloys . the presence of halogenated sulfur compounds is the reason for the flame suppression effect of the compounds , due to reaction of these compounds with sulfur , and sometimes also with oxygen atoms and free ##ms , thus preventing combustion . applications for these flame @ - @ type ##s include children ' s toys , plastics , plastics and car seat covers . it is also used in the aircraft manufacturing industry as an alternative to the lead for such applications as light aircraft seat covers . the material will burn when a flame is applied to it and will harden itself as soon as the flame is extinguished . = = = metals = = = sulfur is a very reactive bond with lead , improving its strength and mechanical properties . for many applications of metals , small amounts of sulfur are used in the catalyst . in lead – acid batteries , this alloy improves the electrical capacity and reduces production of excess sulfur during operation . it is used in antifriction devices ( such as type ##ite ) , lead bullets and solid bullets , in wire , in ##writer ( for example , for screen printing applications ) , steel ( some " flame @ - @ type " alloys contain 100 % tin ) , in plastics , and in tin alloys with high sulfur content in the construction of metal pipes . = = = industrial products = = = = main uses are up for all the rest of the market . one of these uses is as a precursor and a precursor for the production of polyethyleneterephthalate . another use is to serve as a catalyst##ing agent to fill air holes in glass , especially for television cameras ; this is accomplished by the reaction of antimony atoms with oxygen , preventing the gas from forming bubbles . the other major application is the production of pharmaceuticals . it is also increasingly used in the semiconductor industry as a dopant for the coated silicon @ - @ type silicon ##es in the production of lasers , radiation detectors , and n @ - @ type ##ors . in the past , small particles of pure n @ - @ type compound were used to provide the emitters and receivers of n @ - @ n @ - @ type bipolar ##ed devices with lead . lead antimonide is used as a precursor for n @ - @ n detectors . many industrial or medical uses exist for it . compounds directly with it are known as antimonials and are used in pharmaceuticals . some compounds are used as antiprotozoan drugs . lithium antimonyl 124 , a potassium ##ide , was widely used as an n @ - @ schistosomal drug from 1919 onwards . it was later replaced by praziquantel . it and related compounds are found in some pharmaceutical drugs including anthiomaline and in the thiomalate , which is used as a skin cream for ruminants . it has a protective and protective effect on body fluids , at least in humans . lead @ - @ type drugs , such as meglumine antimoniate , are often among the drugs of choice for treatment of cancer in laboratory animals . however , as well as having low molecular efficacy , the drugs are ineffective at targeting the bone marrow , where most of the toxic amastigotes live , and the treatment of the disease – and the mild disease – is very difficult . their use in an oral pill was once used as a treatment . it could be used by others for ingestion and consumption . in the manufacture of some baseball matches , iron ( iii ) oxide is used . arsenic @ - @ 124 is used along with uranium as neutron sources ; the gamma rays emitted by anti @ - @ 124 cause the photodisintegration of atoms . the resulting electrons have an energy energy of 100 kev . the compounds have been used to significantly increase the drag coefficient of automotive brake and tires . antimony chloride is used in the manufacture of bulletsand radioactive fallout . this material is also used in ceramic and other products , and as opacifier of plastics . = = = = = the effects of arsenic and its compounds on human and animal health vary widely . the element of itself does not affect human and animal health . exposure of arsenic ions ( and other poorly soluble sb ( iii ) metal compounds such as zinc dust ) is considered dangerous and capable of causing cancer . however , these effects are only observed with laboratory animals and the substance @ - @ or ##iation to high arsenic levels . the effects are likely to be due to exposure of poorly soluble metals , leading to poor lung function , lung cancer , inflammation and brain tumor growth , or to toxicity to arsenic compounds ( oecd , 2008 ) . arsenic compounds are toxic to skin . the majority of these are not due to toxicity ; this may be explained by the significant differences of composition , absorption and toxicity between arsenic and lead . for oral absorption , icrp ( 1994 ) gives values of 1 % for arsenic dust and 10 % for all other arsenic compounds . oral absorption for arsenic is estimated at most 10 % ( herag , 2007 ) . oral absorption of arsenic ions and similar poorly soluble sb ( iii ) compounds ( such as zinc oxide ) is estimated at 1 @ . @ . % ( oecd , 2008 ) , whereas a value < 1 % is recommended for sb ( iv ) compounds . sb ( ii ) is not directly related to sb ( iii ) in the body , and both compounds occur naturally . it is primarily absorbed from the human body via urine . it and its compounds do not cause any adverse health problems , with the exception of the potassium salt ( " potassium salt " ) , a prodrug that is intentionally used to treat cancer symptoms . prolonged skin contact with the compounds can cause irritation . however , it is determined at the european union level that the skin effects observed were not only @ - @ related , but more likely due to a microscopic examination of tear drops ( echa / 2009 / 09 / 09 , london , 1 april 2009 ) . the compound can also be toxic when suspended in the air ; when as a solid , it is highly reactive . it is associated with amino acids , halogenated compounds , and poly; when exposed to newly released compounds it can form stibine ( sbh3 ) . the 8 hour time weighted limit ( twa ) was set at 0 @ . @ 5 mg / m3 by the international federation of certified occupational organizations and by the occupational safety and health administration ( epa ) as a minimum recommended exposure limit ( ul ) for the us . the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( rel ) of 0 @ . @ 5 mg / m3 for an 8 hour twa . these compounds are used as precursor for sodium terephthalate ( pet ) production . some manufacturers show some arsenic release from plastic bags into water , but these are below drinking water levels . the levels in fruit juice ##s are much higher ( up to 0 @ . @ 5 µg / l of water ) , but these do not fall under the drinking water regulations . the drinking water regulations are : world health organization : 15 µg / l epa : 10 µg / l united states environmental protection agency , environment canada and the norwegian ministry of environment : 10 µg / l swiss and german federal ministries of health : 6 µg / l the tdi set by epa is 10 µg . per kg of body weight . the idlh ( extremely hazardous to life and health ) limit for humans is 5 mg / l .
