= protein = peptide ( / [UNK] / or / ˈproʊti . [UNK] / ) are those biomolecules , or proteins , composed of one or more long chains of amino acid residues . proteins perform a wide range of functions in cells , including performing chemical reactions , dna repair , responding to stimuli , and transporting molecules from one cell to another . proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids , which is determined by the relative sequence of their residues , and which ultimately results in their folding into a specific three @ - @ peptide sequence that determines its function . a long chain of amino acid residues is called a peptide . a peptide has at least one side chain . short chains , with fewer than 20 @ - @ peptide residues , are not considered to be proteins and are instead called proteins , or sometimes oligopeptides . the individual amino acid residues are held together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues . the number of amino acid residues in a protein is determined by the function of the gene , which is specified in the genetic code . in humans , the genetic code includes many different amino acids ; however , in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and — in some archaea — pyrrolysine . immediately after or even during synthesis , the residues in a protein are often further modified by a @ - @ peptide modification , which determines the physical and chemical properties , structure , function , activity , and ultimately , the function of the protein . many proteins have three @ - @ peptide ##s attached , which can be either functional groups or enzymes . proteins can also bind together to achieve a specific function , and they can combine to form complex protein complexes . once synthesized , proteins only exist for a short period of time and are then recycled and consumed in the body ' s cells through the process of protein turnover . a protein ' s lifetime is measured in terms of its three @ - @ peptide and covers a wide range . they can last for minutes to hours with an average lifetime of approximately – 2 hours in living cells . damaged and often misfolded proteins are degraded more quickly either due to being targeted for degradation or due to being damaged . like other biological molecules such as dna and nucleic acids , proteins are integral parts of cells and participate in almost every process within them . biological proteins are molecules that perform chemical reactions andare essential to life . proteins also have structural and functional components , such as actin and iron in neurons and the muscles of the kidney , which form a family of proteins that regulate cell function . these proteins are important for cell division , immune function , cell growth , and the cell cycle . in addition , proteins are used in the body to produce the essential amino acids that cannot be consumed . metabolism breaks the proteins down for use in the body . proteins may be distinguished from other protein molecules using a variety of methods such as elisa , elisa , sequencing , and sequencing ; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to do this . techniques commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry , x @ - @ - fluorescent , x @ - @ pattern tracing , nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy . = = = = = protein molecules consist of multiple domains formed from bundles of 10 to 20 linked l @ - @ α @ - @ amino acids . all proteinogenic amino acids have certain structural features , including an α @ - @ bond to which an amino group , a methyl group , and a variable side chain are attached . the core differs from this basic structure ; it forms an intermediate attachment to the l @ - @ - amine group , which forces the n – - amide group into a stable conformation . the side chains of the different amino acids , as in the structure of standard amino acids , have a wide variety of different structures and functions ; it is the combined action of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines the α @ - @ bond structure and its biological function . the amino acids in a protein molecule are linked by peptide bonds . once attached to the protein molecule , an individual amino acid is called a core , and the side chain of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen atoms is known as the side chain or a backbone . the peptide bond has two different ends that have a l @ - @ bond structure and a rotation about its axis , so that the two ends are not aligned . the first two dihedral angles of the peptide bond determine the overall orientation adopted by the protein molecule . the end of the backbone with a bound amino group is known as the 2 @ - @ end or carboxy terminus , whereas the end with a bound methyl group is known as theor @ - @ , for a peptide . the terms protein , peptide , and peptide are a little different and often overlap in meaning . protein is generally used to refer to the entire protein molecule in a stable configuration , whereas peptide is generally used for a few amino acid oligomers , with a stable , @ - @ , configuration . however , the difference between the two is not well understood and it is around 1 – million molecules . peptide ##s refer to a short linear sequence of amino acids , usually regardless of size , but usually to an element of a larger sequence . = = = protein in bacteria = = = it has been estimated that a @ - @ in cells contain about 1 million proteins per cell ( e . g . e . coli and ##llus aureus ) . other organisms , such as yeast and bacteria contain fewer proteins , typically on the order of 1 @ , @ 000 to 2 million . in contrast , bacterial cells are larger and often contain many more proteins . for example , yeast cells are estimated to contain about 1 million proteins and bacterial cells on the order of 2 to 3 million . note that bacterial cells contain about 10 % more proteins than yeast ( e . g . , yeast ~ 1 @ , @ 000 , e . coli : ~ 2 @ , @ 000 , yeast : ~ 4 @ , @ 000 , bacteria : ~ 8 @ , @ 000 ) . however , the abundance of most proteins ranges from a few molecules per cell to tens of millions . in humans , about a third of all protein is not produced in living cells and only produced under certain conditions . for example , of the 100 @ , @ 000 or more proteins found in the human genome , 10 @ , @ 000 were produced in lymphoblastoid cells . = = assembly = = = = = assembly = = = proteins are made from amino acids and are encoded by aug . each protein has its own unique amino acid sequence that is determined by the dna sequence of the gene encoding this protein . the genetic code is a combination of @ @ - @ - ##s of aug and an @ @ - @ s value of each amino acid , for example aug ( @ @ - @ - @ - @ s ) is the code for aug . because aug has 64 genes , the total number of genetic codes is 64 ; thus ,there is considerable variation in the genetic code , with many amino acids encoded by more than one gene . genes encoded by bacteria are first transcribed into pre @ - @ messenger rna ( mrna ) by enzymes such as the ##se . the bacteria then copy the pre @ - @ mrna ( also known as the mrna transcript ) using various forms of pre @ - @ transcriptional machinery to produce the mature mrna , which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome . in bacteria the mrna can either be released as soon as it is synthesized , or remain retained in the cell after being broken away from the nucleoid . in contrast , yeast store mrna in the cell nucleus and then move it across the cell membrane into the nucleus , where protein synthesis also takes place . the rate of protein synthesis is faster in bacteria than yeast and can produce up to 300 amino acids per day . the process of creating a protein from an mrna transcript is known as synthesis . the mrna is loaded onto the nucleus and then transcribed 100 times at a time by adding each base to a base or anticodon ##s on a template rna molecule , which carries the amino acid sequence to the protein it produces . the enzyme aminoacyl - synthetase " charges " the rna molecule with the template amino acid . the growing rna is then called the template protein . proteins are then biosynthesized from pre @ - @ terminus to post @ - @ terminus . the size of a protein protein can be measured by the number of amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass , which is usually expressed in units of length ( compared with molecular weight units ) , or the mass per kilodalton ( kda ) . large proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 10 kda in mass . the largest protein proteins are the titins , a component of the muscle sarcomere , with a molecular mass of about 3 @ , @ 000 kda and a molecular mass of about 3 @ , @ 000 amino acids . = = = protein synthesis = = = protein proteins can also be produced commercially by a number of processes known as chemical synthesis , which rely on chemical synthesis , such as dna synthesis to produce proteins in high yield . chemical synthesis allows for the conversion of non @ - @ long amino acids into short chains , such asapplication of chemical synthesis to amino acid side chains . these methods are used in structural biology and molecular biology , but generally not for biological applications . chemical synthesis is difficult for proteins longer than about 20 amino acids , and the resulting proteins do not always have their own secondary structure . most protein synthesis reactions proceed from c @ - @ terminus to d @ - @ terminus , determining the chemical structure . = = = = = many proteins fold into simple c @ - @ end structures . the state into which a protein molecule folds is known as its native state . although some proteins can fold freely , simply through the mechanical interaction of their amino acids , others require the presence of molecular oxygen to fold into their native states . scientists usually refer to four main aspects of a protein ' s structure : primary structure : the amino acid sequence . the structure is a protein . secondary structure : the repeating secondary structure determined by hydrogen bonding . the most common structures are the α @ - @ sheet , β @ - @ sheet and sheet . because secondary structures are stable , multiple copies of the secondary structure can be found in the same protein molecule . tertiary structure : the overall structure of a particular protein molecule ; the structural relationship of the various structures to one another . tertiary structure is generally determined by nonlocal interactions , most commonly the binding of a protein molecule , but also by salt bridges , hydrogen bonding , disulfide bonds , and other posttranslational modifications . the term " tertiary structure " is often used as synonymous with the protein core . the tertiary structure is what defines the overall structure of the protein . secondary structure : the structure formed by two different structures ( side chains ) , also called side chains in this context , which function as a single protein molecule . these are not necessarily secondary structures . in addition to these types of structure , proteins may switch between other related structures as they perform their functions . in the case of these functional groups , these primary and secondary structures are often referred to as " domains " , and changes between them are called conformational changes . such changes are usually initiated by the binding of a protein molecule to an enzyme ' s active site , increasing the catalytic activity of the enzyme that participates in these reactions . in addition proteins may undergo changes in structure through molecular vibration and the collision with other proteins . proteins can be broadly divided into three major categories , which vary with their primary structures : glo##bular proteins , fibrous proteins , and membrane proteins . not all globular proteins are structural and some are not . some proteins are membrane proteins , such as muscle , the protein component of muscle tissue , and hair , the protein component of hair and skin . membrane proteins may act as anchors or provide channels for ions or polar ions to pass through the cell membrane . a special class of weak hydrogen bonds between proteins , being protected from water , and thus causing their rapid breakdown , are called dehydrons . = = = structure determination = = = determination the secondary structure of a protein , and the final structure of protein complexes , can provide important information about how the protein performs its function . common laboratory methods of structure determination include x @ - @ ray analysis and infrared spectroscopy , both of which can provide information at atomic resolution . however , infrared spectroscopy are used to provide data from which a subset of distances between groups of proteins can be determined , and the final secondary structures for a protein are determined by solving the atomic resolution problem . protein structure interferometry is a common laboratory technique for determining the final secondary structure and conformational changes due to interactions with other proteins . # ##ization is a common technique for determining the β @ - @ sheet / α @ - @ sheet structure of proteins . cryoelectron spectroscopy is used to obtain low @ - @ resolution structural information for very large protein complexes , especially assembled proteins ; a technique known as gel spectroscopy can also provide low @ - @ resolution information in some cases , especially for low @ - @ resolution structures of large proteins . protein structures are typically stored in the protein data bank ( pdb ) , a publicly accessible database from which structural information for families of proteins can be obtained in the form of atomic coordinates for each member of the protein . many more gene structures are known than protein structures . however , the number of protein structures is limited toward proteins that can be easily adjusted to the problems encountered in x @ - @ ray analysis , one of the primary structure determination methods . in general , protein proteins are comparatively easy to solve in preparation for x @ - @ ray analysis . membrane proteins , in contrast , are difficult to solve and are underrepresented in the pdb . structural genomics methods have attempted to solve these problems by systematically determining the structure of major protein families . protein structure determination methodstrying to find a way of generating a stable model for proteins whose functions have not been experimentally determined . = = protein = = = proteins are the structural components of the cell , thought to be carrying out the functions performed by the proteins encoded by genes . with the exception of certain types of proteins , all other protein molecules are relatively small molecules upon which they act . proteins make up half the molecular weight of an e coli organism , whereas smaller molecules such as dna and rna make up about 10 % and 5 % , respectively . the set of proteins present in a given organism or cell type is known as the genome . the primary characteristic of proteins that can have their diverse set of functions is their ability to bind other molecules quickly and efficiently . the part of the cell responsible for binding another molecule is known as the binding site and is typically a point or " bump " on the cell surface . this binding ability is determined by the secondary structure of the protein , which contains the binding site itself , and by the binding affinity of the individual amino acids ' side chains . protein binding can be very efficient and fast ; for example , the insulin a protein binds to the angiogenin with a high @ - @ femtomolar binding constant ( < 2 − ##1 m ) and does not bind at all to the amphibian homolog onconase ( > 10 m ) . even minor structural changes such as the binding of a single amino acid to the binding site can not suffice to bind all proteins ; for example , the aminoacyl trna synthetase bound to the amino acid aa reacts against the relatively small side chain of the amino acid aa . proteins can bind to larger molecules as well as to the @ - @ binding site . when proteins bind tightly to multiple copies of the same protein , they can oligomerize to form fibrils ; this process occurs only in larger molecules that consist of multiple monomers that the @ - @ binds to in secondary structures . these – protein interactions can regulate cellular function , their progression across the cell membrane , and allow the formation of complex protein complexes that carry out many structurally related functions with a common biological function . proteins can also bind to , and even be incorporated into , cell membranes . the ability of binding sites to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the formation of highly complex protein complexes . however , the interactions between proteins are highly, and depend heavily on the interaction of different types of specific proteins to form proteins that are able to carry out different types of functions , study of the interactions between these proteins is a way to understand various aspects of cell biology , and understand the properties that differentiate different cell types . = = = = = = = the # @ - @ the majority of proteins in the cell function as enzymes , which catalyse chemical reactions . enzymes are not very diverse and perform only one or a few chemical reactions . they carry out most of the reactions involved in transcription , as well as modifying proteins in processes such as dna replication , dna repair , and transcription . some enzymes depend on other enzymes to add or remove these modifications in a process known as posttranslational modification . over 500 @ , @ 000 reactions are known to be performed by enzymes . the rate increase achieved by these enzymes is often of — as much as 1017 @ - @ fold acceleration in time of the uncatalysed reactions in the form of orotate ##s ( 1 million cycles without the substrate , 100 million with the enzyme ) . the molecules bound and acted upon by enzymes are called substrates . although enzymes can consist of thousands of amino acids , there is usually only a small fraction of the molecules that are in contact with the substrate , and an even smaller fraction — one to five residues on substrates — that are not involved in synthesis . the part of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the most residues is known as the active site . dirigent proteins are members of a family of proteins that regulate the stereochemistry of a molecule bound to other proteins . = = = = receptor and ligand ##s = = = signaling proteins are involved in the process of cell division and signal transmission . signaling proteins , such as insulin , are signaling proteins that receive a signal from the cell from which they are released to other cells or distant tissues . others are signaling proteins that act as messengers whose main function is to bind a target protein and trigger a chemical reaction in the cell . these proteins have a binding domain located on the cell surface and an additional domain inside the cell , which may have additional activity or may undergo a conformational change induced by other proteins in the cell . antibodies are the proteins of the innate immune system whose main function is to recognize antibodies , or other molecules in the body , and use them for defense . antibodies can be released into the outside environment orand in the membranes of the b cells known as plasma membranes . whereas proteins are limited in their binding affinity for their substrate by the constraints of conducting their functions , antibodies have no such limitation . an antibody ' s binding affinity to its substrate is very high . many ion transport proteins function to target biomolecules and transport them to specific locations in the body of a living organism . these proteins typically have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present at high concentrations , but can also bind the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target cell . the classic example of a protein @ - @ binding protein is oxygen , which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in most organisms and has many homologs in many animal species . there are protein @ - @ binding proteins which are highly selective for their ligand ##s . proteins typically play a role in biological signaling pathways between molecules and ions . proteins and receptors are ligand specific transport proteins . transmembrane proteins can also act as ion transport proteins that control the response of the cell membrane to foreign molecules and ions . the membrane usually contains a thin layer through which ions or polar molecules cannot pass . some proteins contain ion channels that allow foreign molecules to enter and leave the cell . some ion transport proteins are able to select for only one specific ion ; for example , potassium and sodium channels can select for only one of the two ions . = = = rigid proteins = = = rigid proteins add strength and flexibility to protein @ - @ binding biological systems . many structural proteins are fibrous proteins ; for example , muscle and bone are common components of soft tissue such as muscle , and bone is common in muscle . soft tissues such as muscle , skin , skin , hair , and many other tissues . many structural proteins can also serve mechanical functions , for example , protein and tubulin are rigid and flexible as well , but tend to form long , thin fibers that make up the cytoskeleton , which allow the cell to change its shape and size . structural proteins that serve mechanical functions include structural proteins such as insulin , kinesin , and dynein , which are capable of generating mechanical forces . these forces are responsible for the movement of single celled organisms and the movement of many other organisms which reproduce sexually . they also control the forces generated bymembrane proteins and their important roles in intracellular trafficking . = = method of analysis = = the structure and functions of proteins can be studied in vitro , in vivo , and in silico . in vitro studies of membrane proteins under laboratory conditions are important for understanding how a protein carries out its function : for example , enzyme isolation can determine the exact nature of an enzyme ' s catalytic activity and its binding affinity for its potential target proteins . in contrast , in vivo studies can provide information about the biological activity of a protein in the context of a cell or of a whole organism . in silico studies use different methods to separate proteins . = = = protein structure = = = to perform in vitro studies , a protein must be isolated separately from its cellular components . this process typically begins with cell division , in which the cell ' s membrane is removed and its membrane proteins dumped into a solution known as a protein lysate . the resulting protein can be separated by precipitation , which separates the remaining cellular components into fractions of membrane proteins ; membrane proteins and proteins ; structural proteins , and nucleic acids . separation by a method such as freezing , can separate the protein from this lysate . these methods of separation are also used to separate the proteins from proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight , electrical properties and binding affinity . the method of separation can be determined by the methods of gel ##atin if the target protein ' s molecular weight and isoelectric point are known , by spectroscopy if the protein has specific chemical properties , or by gel ##atin if the protein has catalytic activity . alternatively , proteins can be separated by their activity by electrofocusing . for natural products , a number of purification steps can be used to make proteins sufficiently pure for clinical use . to facilitate this process , protein engineering is often used to add unique properties to proteins that make them easier to isolate without altering their structure or activity . typically , a " tag " consisting of a specific amino acid sequence , or a sequence of specific residues ( a " his @ - @ tag " ) , is attached to the end of the tag . as a result , when the lysate is passed through a thin column of nickel , the nickel atoms recognize the tag and stick to the tag while the other residues of the lysate pass through . a number of different methods have been usedto help to distinguish these proteins from other proteins . = = = cell location = = = the study of proteins in vivo is primarily concerned with the location and binding of the proteins within the cell . although many fusion proteins are located in the nucleus and the @ - @ binds to other proteins in the endoplasmic space , the details of how they are bound to specific membranes or cellular regions are still unknown . a common technique for determining cell location is protein fusion to create within the cell a fusion protein or antibody consisting of the fusion protein of interest fused to a " template " such as green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) . the fusion protein ' s location within the cell can be quickly and easily determined by microscopy , as shown in the figure below . other methods for determining the cellular location of proteins include the use of specific compartmental markers for locations such as the blood , the er , membranes , tissues , nucleus , nucleus , plasma membrane , etc . with the use of fluorescently labeled versions of these markers and of antibodies to these markers , it is much easier to determine the location of the protein of interest . for example , direct fluorescent techniques allow for the colocalization and determination of proteins . direct antibodies are used to identify other proteins for a similar purpose . other techniques exist , as well . for example , elisa analysis uses an antibody to one or more proteins of interest that are bound to markers with either fluorescent or chromogenic properties that can be applied to proteins , allowing for location determination . another common technique is cofractionation of protein ( or other protein ) molecules with isopycnic acid . although this technique does not allow colocalization of a mixture of the markers and the protein of interest , it does increase the resolution , and is more similar to gold @ - @ scale analysis . finally , the gold @ - @ scale method of protein analysis is immunoelectron ##ics . this technique usually uses an antibody to the protein of interest , along with other light microscopy techniques . the sample is prepared for laboratory or laboratory analysis , and then reacted with an antibody to the protein of interest that is bound to an appropriate electro @ - @ contrast medium , usually water . this allows for the use of an ultrast##ructural , as well as the protein of interest . in a genetic engineering technique known as a @ - @ site evolution , researchers can isolate the protein , and determine its structure , biological function , and resistance to degradation . this technology also allows the transformation of different amino acids into proteins , using different structures , and can allow the systematic design of new proteins with novel functions . = = = = = = = the total number of proteins present at one time in a cell or tissue sample is known as the genome , and the use of very large @ - @ site data sets dominates the field of research , somewhat in contrast to the broader field of biology . common analytical methods in biology include gel electrophoresis , which allows the analysis of a large number of proteins , mass analysis , which allows for high @ - @ resolution analysis of proteins and complexes of proteins ( most sought after by @ - @ site ##s ) , protein microarrays , which allows the determination of the relative positions of a large number of proteins present in a sample , and the @ - @ fold method , which allows the structural analysis of protein – ##1 ) . the total complement of all significant protein structures is known as the interactome . a systematic approach to determining the structure of proteins for each individual protein is known as structural analysis . = = = bioinformatics = = = a wide variety of computational methods have been developed to determine the structure , function , and function of proteins . the development of these methods has been hampered by the limited amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms , including the human genome . it is virtually impossible to study many proteins simultaneously , and only a few are relevant to biological function . many methods are able to point to specific proteins . many similar proteins can be easily identified in closely related organisms by sequence analysis . genes and protein sequences can be identified using a variety of tools for different purposes . protein analysis tools can include : enzyme sequences , open reading frames , dna sequences , and 3d protein structure . phylogenetic trees can be generated and their structure tested using statistical tools like clustalw for the analysis of individual proteins and the proteins they bind . the field of bioinformatics is also used for the study of genes and proteins . = = = = protein structure and analysis = = = = contributions to the field of biotherefore , protein structure prediction attempts to find new ways to find new structures for proteins whose structures have not yet been determined independently . the most common method of structure prediction , known as structural modeling , relies on the prediction of a " perfect " structure with properties matched to the structure being predicted ; structural ##ists ' goal is to obtain enough information about protein structures to correct many of those that exist . although producing structural models is a challenge when only distantly related protein structures are known , it has been shown that sequence alignment is the key in this area , and more accurate models can be produced if a " perfect " sequence alignment is achieved . protein structure prediction techniques have helped to pioneer the new field of protein engineering , in which novel protein structures have already been discovered . a more complex computational approach is the prediction of protein interactions , such as in protein folding and in – protein interaction networks . the dynamics of protein folding and assembly can be simulated using such techniques as quantum mechanics , in particular , molecular dynamics and monte carlo , which both take advantage of parallel and distributed computing ( x @ t computing ; molecular dynamics using gpu ) . the structure of the α @ - @ - protein domains such as the villin domain and the alpha ##1 domain has been successfully solved in silico , and computational models that combine the molecular dynamics with quantum mechanics techniques have enabled simulation of the tertiary structure of proteins . = = = = protein structure and unstructure ##s = = = = most proteins ( including eucaryota ~ 33 % ) contain completely different , less active domains and cannot be modeled as fully functional proteins . predicting and predicting protein disorder is , therefore , an important part of protein structure prediction . = = = = = = bacteria and plants can biosynthesize about 10 million amino acids , but animals ( including humans ) can produce most of the amino acids from the diet . the amino acids that an organism cannot produce on its own are referred to as essential amino acids . some enzymes that produce essential amino acids are not present in organisms — such as aspartokinase , which is the first step in the synthesis of ile , ile , and ile from aspartate . if amino acids are present in the diet , microorganisms can generate energy by removing all the amino acids from their diet and downregulating their metabolic activities . thegenerally , amino acids are produced through the consumption of foods containing protein . these foods are typically broken down into amino acids through metabolism , which usually involves denaturation of the protein by exposure to heat and radiation by enzymes called enzymes . some ingested amino acids are used for protein synthesis , while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis , and incorporated into the amino acid cycle . this use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under physiological conditions as it allows the body ' s metabolic energy to be used to fuel cells , especially those living in cells . amino acids are also an important biological component of humans . = = chemistry and biology = = proteins were identified as a distinct class of food molecules in the eighteenth century by antoine fourcroy and others , characterized by the proteins ' ability to bind and dissolve after treatment with heat and radiation . notable proteins of the time included proteins from egg whites , blood , eggs , milk , and wheat flour . proteins were first studied by the dutch chemist gerardus johannes mulder and later by the swedish chemist jons gregor ##us in 1838 . mulder carried out chemical studies of various proteins and found that not all proteins had the same chemical formula , c400h620n100o120p1s1 . he came to the logical conclusion that they might be composed of a different type of ( but similar ) molecule . the term " protein " to describe these molecules was coined by mulder ' s friend herman ; it is derived from the greek word πρωτειος ( proteios ) , meaning " lead " , " in the line " , or " standing in line " , + - es . mulder went on to describe the components of proteins , such as the amino acid , for which he gave a ( historically significant ) molecular weight of 131 grams . other gregor ##ists such as the german carl von voit believed that protein was the most important component for understanding the structure of the body , because it was generally believed that " protein makes sense . " karl heinrich ritthausen expanded the protein chemistry with the discovery of glutamic acid . at the california agricultural experiment station a systematic study of the human diet was conducted by carl gregor ##ow . working with gregor ##ius and carl liebig ' s observations of the balance in the laboratory experiments , the most important amino acids were identified . the work was continued and theand william cumming smith . the understanding of proteins as enzymes stems from the work of franz hofmeister and emil emil fischer . the potential role of proteins as enzymes in living organisms was not fully appreciated until 1926 , when william h . smith showed that the enzyme itself was in fact a protein . the difficulty of producing proteins in large quantities made them very difficult for the early ##ists to study . therefore , early research focused on proteins that could be produced in small quantities , e . g . , those of eggs , egg whites , natural products , and meat / dairy products obtained from animals . in the 1930s , the american mineral water co . produced 1 % of the human serum protein , and made it commercially available to laboratories ; this discovery helped ribonuclease enzymes become a major target for scientific research for the next century . linus johnson is credited with the first prediction of regular protein secondary structure based on hydrogen bonding , an idea first put forward by william astbury in 1933 . later work by hans kauzmann on denaturation , based largely on earlier work by kaj linderstrøm @ - @ lang , provided an understanding of protein function and structure determined by chemical analysis . the first protein to be solved was insulin , by edward teller , in 1949 . he also determined the amino acid sequence of insulin , thus successfully proving that proteins consisted of linear chains of amino acids rather than branched chains , chains , or cyclols . he received the nobel prize for this work in 1958 . the first protein structures to be solved were insulin and insulin , by paul perutz and sir oliver cowdery frs , frs , in 1958 . as of 2016 , the protein data bank has published , @ , @ 000 ##0 @ - @ resolution structures of proteins . in more recent times , cryo @ - @ resolution microscopy of large protein structures and the protein structure analysis of large protein assemblies are common methods of protein prediction . = = = = = = = = databases and libraries = = = the protein web the national protein database ncbi entrez protein database ncbi protein structure database the protein structure library . proteinpedia @ @ lang ( stanford university ) the toxicogenomics database of the – protein structures , as well as toxin / disease – ##1 , and toxicity @ - @ resolution structures . bioinformatic ##a (meta - engine ( multiple languages ) for protein and protein structures . protein databank of america ( see also pdbequips , short articles and reviews on the pdb website ) . collaboratory for molecular bioinformatics ( see also protein of the year , and short articles of interesting interest from the pdb ) proteopedia – life sciences ) : large , zoomable 3d database with wiki page for a known protein crystal structure . uniprot the global protein database nextprot – . the database of human proteins : multi @ - @ the protein structure database multi @ - @ omics . protein data : for natural and model organisms protein / rna structure and function data = = = textbooks and course materials = = = " an introduction to protein " from net ( mit ' s global education program for students at mit ) protein : introduction to protein – the national institute of biochemistry and molecular biology database of protein structures
