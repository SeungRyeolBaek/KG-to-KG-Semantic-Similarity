= = ( nelly furtado remix ) = = is the third studio album by american singer and songwriter nelly furtado , released on 21 november 2006 by geffen records and the mosley music group . following the release of furtado ' s debut album , powerless ( 2003 ) by dreamworks records , it was announced that warner music group would acquire dreamworks records , the label being folded into the interscope geffen a & m , where furtado would record entirely new material . timbaland and his brother danja produced the majority of the album , which incorporates elements of pop , r & b and hip hop . the album explores the theme of female empowerment and has been described as experimental and highly poetic in nature . the album received criticism because of the controversial image furtado created for the album , and some critics felt it was a failure to sell enough copies . further controversy arose over allegations of cheating on timbaland ' s part on the song " say it " ( which contains the sample from finnish singer janne suni ' s song " acidjazzed out " without her permission ) when they were leaked onto youtube . the album was considered as both critically and commercially successful . it reached high positions on charts around the world , and according to an april 2009 press release , it has sold more than 3 million copies worldwide , making it the best @ - @ selling album of 2006 – 07 and the best @ - @ - - @ - @ selling album of the 2000s . the album was heavily promoted , released in limited quantities and supported by the = = tour , which was the soundtrack of the 2006 film folklore : the concert . " powerless " peaked at number one , making it furtado ' s first single to top the chart , with four singles being released from the album , including the us number @ - @ one singles " powerless " and " say it again " , which received grammy award nominations for best pop collaboration with vocals and best female pop vocal performance , respectively . other notable singles include the uk number @ - @ one single " maneater " and the us number one single " all good things ( come to an end ) " . = = = = = furtado ' s second album , powerless , was released in november 2003 . the lead single is " powerless ( do what you want ) " and the second single is the ballad " loose " . the album was not as successful as her debut , partly due to the album ' s more " pop" intro . " " ( do what you want ) " was also remixed , featuring spanish rapper juanes , who had previously collaborated with furtado on his song " fotografia " ( " photography " ) . the two would collaborate again on " te busque " ( " i feel for you " ) , the single from furtado ' s album loose . the album was underpromoted from her label dreamworks records ; it was announced on 22 october 2003 that universal music group signed an agreement to purchase dreamworks records from dreamworks skg for " approximately $ 10 million " . the deal came at a time when the music industry was " going through dramatic changes " as it struggled to " handle record sales and the effects of declining digital download sales " . dreamworks records was absorbed into the interscope geffen a & m records label in late 2004 . furtado ' s recording contract was also absorbed into geffen records . = = = = = furtado began work on music by working with producer jellystone what she refers to as a " co @ - @ writing session " , in which they would " write songs , record them , and develop their lyrics and melodies . " the first producers she worked with were track & field — . co @ - @ produced her first two albums , whoa , nelly ! ( 2000 ) and loose ( 2003 ) — and by early 2005 , she had worked with band members and dj ' s . she worked with nellee hooper in miami on her @ - @ solo album and with lester mendez in los angeles on solo material . one of the songs mendez helped to produce was " te busque " , which was co @ - @ produced , and featured juanes , who collaborated with furtado on his 2002 song " fotografia " . during her time in los angeles , she worked with rick nowels , while co @ - @ wrote and produced " in god ' s hands " and " somebody to love " . in miami , florida , furtado worked with pharrell ( who introduced her to reggaeton and later gave her a " co @ - @ track " for his 2005 song " if i love you like that " ) and scott storch ( with whom she recorded a " co @ - @ - @ track " ) before entering the studio with timbaland . he and his wife at the time , danja , co @ - @ produced two of the tracks , with one produced entirely by danja . forinstead of the tracks on the album , timbaland would work on tracks not included on the album that were either @ - @ tracks or just " beats " ; the others were completely improvised . furtado recorded about 20 tracks for loose , of which she would create based on the sonics of the album — she called timbaland " a musical genius " who came up with a bunch of tracks that day , and said that the one she had created was completely improvised . she recorded an additional track with justin timberlake , " lose control " , which she described as " kind of fun " and " a fun , fun , fun , fun song " . other tracks considered for inclusion on the album included " inside out " , " friend of mine " , " crazy " , " up in the air " , " my girl " , " crazy " and " crazy " . furtado said in her interview on her official website that she recorded a remix of " maneater " with rapper lil wayne ; it was later released as part of her compilation album , timbaland ' s remix & freestyle ##s , she also performed the beat of the song during her live performance of " maneater " . a remix of " all good things ( come to an end ) " featuring vocals from coldplay lead singer chris martin , who at @ - @ produced the album , was not included despite a request from she ' s label , emi . the song was included on the album , but only furtado ' s vocals were used . furtado said that " i was 100 % done with the beat first , and then i ’ would write my lyrics and listen to the beat . " = = = @ - @ production = = the " post @ - @ the @ - @ production " approach to production was one of the reasons the album was named loose . it was named partly for the creative decisions she made when making the album . the album was also called loose because it is " the opposite of loose " and came down to furtado and timbaland ; she called him her " closest " friend because he " always pushing boundaries and always figuring out his own path " , which she said she was doing with him . " i think you have to like other people as an artist , and i think that — i like doing that " , she said . loose was also named loose for the r & b girl group loose , which furtado said she admired for " focusing on their sexuality, and they were all strangers . " she said she wanted the album to be " raw and aggressive " and " anything but boring " , including madonna , mc lyte , queen latifah and janet jackson , which suited furtado because , as she described it , she felt " confident in her style and sexuality " when her 1993 single " that ' s the way it is " was released . during the recording of this , furtado listened to many electro and rock bands , including bloc party , system of a down , m . i . a . , tool , queens of the stone age , disturbed and death from above 1979 , all of whom influenced the " musical influences " found on the album and the " screaming , screaming , screaming basslines " that she heard in the mix throughout . according to her , music from these artists is " very violent and has a violent edge " to it , all of which she felt she liked on the album . furtado also felt the music became " raw ##er " and " hop @ - @ , as it had become " emotionally raw and violent . " because the recording artists were aware of timbaland and furtado ' s musical influences , the songs were recorded on a mixing console in the studio instead of " the usual equipment at the studio " . furtado said she liked the higher quality that they brought to the album because she wanted it to sound like her demo album , which she compared to her previous work . she said , " it didn ' t have that final wash to it ; it didn ' t have the final wash at the end , except for a few songs " . = = = and = = = furtado said that with the release of her album like this , she had managed to establish herself as a musician and gain respect from fans by playing many different instruments on the album , which most hip hop artists do not do . since she felt she had achieved that , she felt she had managed to create the kind of music she " really love [ s ] " . furtado said her main problem with hip hop was that she did not think it was good enough to base all of her songs on , and that she never asked herself why she was being " rejected " . the result was her escape from that rejection and , in her words , " being in the deep end of the pool — ' ahh , damn it , this is it ! ' " . furtado said she saw herself " all over the map" and me " because she is still true to her roots . for the first time , furtado worked with a number of different producers and took a more experimental approach to making the album . produced primarily by timbaland and danja , it sees furtado experimenting with a more r & b – hip hop sound and , as she describes it , the " dark , electronic elements of ' 80s pop " . she has described the album ' s genre as post @ - @ hop , which she describes as hip @ - @ , " dark , electronic , electronic music " and says that " there ' s a dark , post @ - @ hop feel to [ it ] that ' s very sexy " . furtado has described the album as " more dark , more electronic , more post @ - @ hop , [ and ] more mature " than her previous work , which she says is more layered and complicated because she " tend [ s ] to overthink things " . in addition , during her recording sessions with timbaland , she said she was " in the new club phase of just letting loose " and becoming more mature . according to furtado , accused of " slick production " , the album features " very weird " elements such as distorted bass ##lines , contributions from other musicians and no " margin for error " . furtado has said she was not thinking much about the lyrics , which are not included in the liner notes , as it is about " believing in something — whether it ' s sex or love . " according to her , she wasn ' t trying to be sexual with the lyrics — " i think i can feel it inside " , she said . = = = = = the second single , " beautiful " ( from the game ) , is a reflection of furtado ' s perception of what people think of her , and she has said the song reminds her of " living on the street in high school . . . because you come from the outside in . now that i ' m an adult , i think about the inside of me . . . and i thought i didn ' t care about what people think of me , but i really do . " " maneater " is an uptempo electro ##pop song that features heavy electro synths and a more hip @ - @ hop beat . the hip @ - @ hop song has heavy electropop and synthpop influences and is directly related to how people get " hot "themselves " when standing in their underwear in front of a mirror . " showtime " ( featuring timbaland ) was inspired by a sexual incident furtado had with him , who said @ - @ in the song she also described the second track , " showtime " , as " a sexy r & b club jam " . " no hay igual " is a hip hop and reggaeton song , that features a spanglish beat , and " hard @ - @ - " vocals . the song has a " strong sense " of melody and " rhythmic rhythm " . in " no hay igual " , furtado sings in spanish and then in english with a reggaeton beat . the album also contains several other tracks , and the sunday times said that it " has a tropical feel to it . " the title track , " en busque " , which features spanish singer juanes , is about furtado ' s struggle with depression , which she said she has had ever since she was about 16 years old . furtado said she is unsure what " getting it on " is about , but that it reflects her feelings when she heard it and " got into this emotional stuff " ; in an interview for the sunday times , it was said that it is about her relationship with boyfriend alex gahunia , the father of her child . " in god ' s hands " , another track from the album , was also inspired by the end of their relationship . = = = = = in may 2006 , a remix of " no hay igual " featuring calle 13 was released as a promotional single in the us . during the same month , " showtime " ( featuring timbaland ) was released for digital download in latin america . it became furtado ' s first single to top the us billboard hot 100 and was successful in spain , where it reached the top twenty . the first single in europe and latin america , " maneater " , was released in late may to early june 2006 . it became furtado ' s first single to top the uk singles chart and reach the top twenty in several countries ; it reached the top ten in france and the top twenty in spain and latin america . the second single in europe , " shine " , was released in late august to early september 2006 . it did not chart as well as " maneater " . it peaked outside the top twenty in the netherlands and the ukcharted in several countries , including germany , and it reached the top twenty in france . during the same month , " maneater " began its run as the third single in north america ; it was not as successful as " loose " , reaching number two @ - @ only in canada and the top twenty in the uk , but it was a top twenty hit on the uk singles chart . releases of the fourth north american single , " say it right " , and the fifth international single , " all good things ( come to an end ) " , took place in november and december , and the fourth north american single , " loose " , was released in january 2007 .

" time magazine wrote that furtado ' s new " aggressive sexual " image was controversial , and noted the influence of the video ' s direction of geffen ' s jimmy iovine , who helped to create the dresden dolls , a girl group known for their sexually explicit dance moves . the magazine also criticized furtado ' s display of her breasts and her lack of makeup in a time magazine interview , saying : " hey , do you hear that noise ? those are the sounds of gloria ##na ##gging in their heads .

" despite her recent success . . . furtado ' s new image doesn ’ t feel right " , it wrote . " [ she ] seems to be thinking , and acting out , to the beat of her music .

" on 22 january 2007 , timbaland commented on the controversy in an mtv interview : " it makes me angry . the part i don ' t understand , the part about having to act like i went to his house and stole something from his house . i didn ' t attack him from a can of worms . i ' m ten feet away . that ' s how you attack the world ? you attack moi ? come on , man . you have to be serious . you the laughing stock . people are like , ' you can ' t be serious .
