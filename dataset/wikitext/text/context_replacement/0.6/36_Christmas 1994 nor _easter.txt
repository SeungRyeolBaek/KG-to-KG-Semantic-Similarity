= = 1994 nor ' easter = the december 1994 nor ' easter was an atlantic hurricane affecting the east coast of the united states and eastern canada . it originated from an area of low pressure in the southeast gulf of mexico near the florida keys , and moved across the straits of florida . as it entered the warm waters of the gulf stream of the atlantic ocean , it began to rapidly organize , displaying characteristics of a tropical cyclone , including the formation of an eye . it reached a peak of 970 mb between december 23 and 24 , and after moving westward , it moved ashore near new york city on christmas day . because of the uncertain nature of the storm , the national hurricane center ( nhc ) did not classify it as a tropical storm . heavy rainfall from the tropical storm led to coastal flooding in north carolina . much of the rest of the east coast was affected by high winds , flash flooding , and beach erosion . new york city and new jersey bore the effects of the storm ; damage was reported on long island , and in connecticut , 10 @ , @ 000 homes lost their power during the storm . significant flooding and power failures also occurred throughout rhode island and massachusetts , where the storm produced 30 @ - @ ft ( 9 @ . @ . m ) waves along the coast . because of the variable weather conditions that led to the storm ' s development , damage was limited to precipitation . two people were killed , and damage amounted to at least $ 1 million . = = weather bureau = = the storm originated from an upper @ - @ ft low pressure area that moved westward from the northern great lakes into the atlantic ocean of the united states . upon entering the southeast gulf of mexico , the system underwent cyclogenesis , and the new storm moved across florida on december 24 in response to an approaching trough . national hurricane center director john beven noted that " as it moved westward into the atlantic , it began to take on the characteristics of a tropical cyclone . " the uncertain nature of the storm prevented the nhc from issuing warnings on it , and they lacked enough information to accurately forecast the system for a tropical impact . the same trough that spawned the system into florida also moved to the west , allowing for higher pressure to develop in the upper reaches of the system . termed a " tropical storm " , the storm rapidly intensified as warm waters of up to 80 ° f ( 27 ° c ) from the gulf stream merged with a warm air mass over the united states . the storm continued to rapidly strengthen while remaining within thejet stream ; it developed deep convection , an unusual feature for an extratropical cyclone , and at one point developed an eye . despite these reports of tropical characteristics , " there was no convection associated with it and it had a warm core , but the radius of the circulation was less than 150 nautical miles ( 175 mi ; 280 km ) , so under the koppen nhc , it didn ' t qualify as a tropical cyclone . " between december 23 and 24 , the nor ' easter intensified to reach a minimum pressure of 970 mb ( 29 inhg ) . an 8 @ - @ secondary low pressure area that developed during the system continued to develop and grew to be larger in size than the original low . in an event known as the fujiwhara effect , the central circulation of the new low turned the remnant nor ' easter northward towards southern new york and new jersey . the remnant low passed over the south coast of long island , and made landfall near new york city on december 24 . thereafter , it passed into northern new york state . on december 25 , the system began to gradually weaken as it moved towards nova scotia , and the remnants of low pressure systems moved out to sea near newfoundland in the early hours of december 26 . = = = = = = = = = united states = = = in south carolina , damage associated with the storm was reported to be the worst since 1943 . about 5 inches ( 130 mm ) of rainfall was reported , and winds brought down trees and damaged roofs . in addition , the state experienced the effects of beach erosion . thousands of electricity ##ians in the region lost power . as a result of the heavy rainfall , several dams were breached by high waters . widespread flooding of roads and bridges was reported , many of which were damaged as a result . up to 3 feet ( 0 @ . @ . m ) of water flooded many homes in the area . about 200 people in beaufort county were forced to evacuate because of the flooding , and at least 50 homes were destroyed . two deaths were reported in the state . a woman was killed when her car overturned and hit a tree , and another woman died when her car was hit by another tree . property damage in south carolina amounted to at least $ 1 million . strong winds occurred along the south carolina coast . muscle beach reported sustained winds of 45 miles per hour ( 72 km / h ) , and offshore , winds gusted to 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) . at wrightsville beach , high surf eroded an 8 @ - @ bridge (the @ . @ ( s ) crashed into the sea . in rhode island , houses were flattened and several roads , including part of north carolina highway 1 , were flooded . = = = = @ - @ = = = = as the strongest storm in new england , the remnant storm caused minor coastal flooding in the atlantic region of virginia on december 23 . winds of 35 to 45 miles per hour ( 56 to 72 km / h ) and 1 to 1 to 3 feet ( 0 @ . @ 0 to 1 @ . @ 1 m ) above normal were reported . in sandbridge , virginia beach , virginia , a beach house collapsed into the sea . several homes in the area sustained minor damage . strong winds resulting from the high wind shear of the nor ' easter and an area of low pressure somewhere over the united states brought down a few power poles , which caused a small fire on december 24 . the fire , quickly extinguished by the winds , destroyed a house . the wind knocked down several trees . damage was minor in pennsylvania . several sand dunes and other structures were destroyed , and near @ - @ 000 damage occurred . in new jersey , high winds caused power failure and brought down trees and power lines . minor coastal flooding of roads and bridges was reported . overall , damage across the state was minimal . the storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to new york state and new york city on december 23 and 24 . winds of 60 to 80 miles per hour ( 95 to 129 km / h ) downed hundreds of trees and downed power lines across long island . several homes , in addition to several cars , sustained damage . approximately 112 @ , @ 000 long island power company buildings experienced power failure at some point during the storm . as the storm moved further into new york state , strong winds occurred in the hudson valley region . in sullivan , albany and rensselaer counties , trees , tree limbs , and power lines were downed by the winds . in stephentown , a gust of 58 miles per hour ( 93 km / h ) was reported . westchester county sustained minor damage , with several trees being downed and damaged buildings . in southern new york state , 70 @ , @ 000 homes lost power as a result of the nor ' easter . along the south shore of long island , in southold , a mobile house partially collapsed into the sea . = = = new jersey = = = in pennsylvania , the storm was reported as being more severe than expected . high @ - @ 000 wind gust , reaching 70 miles per hour ( 110 km / h ), first into the state from the northeast and then from the southwest . trees , tree limbs , and power lines were downed , causing damage to homes and crops . the strong winds caused widespread power failures , affecting up to 40 @ , @ 000 electric customers . as a result , northeast utilities sought help from as far as vermont and vermont to restore power . john ranniello , a spokesman for northeast utilities , said that " we ' ve had problems in almost every county .
