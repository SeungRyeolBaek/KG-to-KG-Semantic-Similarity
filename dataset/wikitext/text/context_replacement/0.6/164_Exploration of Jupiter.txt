= radius of jupiter = the exploration of jupiter has been accomplished via close approaches by several spacecraft . it began with the launch of pioneer 10 into the solar system in 1973 , and , as of 2016 , has continued with five manned spacecraft missions . all of these missions were funded by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and all but one have conducted flybys that took detailed measurements without the spacecraft leaving or changing course . these missions make jupiter the most studied of the solar system ' s major planets . most missions to the inner solar system have required multiple flybys to reduce fuel costs and travel times . on 1 july 2016 , the successfully approached and entered the planet ' s atmosphere — the first spacecraft ever to do so . sending a probe to jupiter encountered many technical challenges , mainly due to the spacecraft ' high fuel requirements and the effects of the planet ' s extreme physical environment . the first spacecraft to visit jupiter was pioneer 10 in 1973 , followed a year later by pioneer 11 . aside from making the first two @ - @ up measurements of the planet , the probe studied its surface and its highly rocky surface . the voyager 1 and voyager 2 spacecraft visited the planet in 1979 , and studied its atmosphere and the solar system , including the stellar activity of jupiter and the presence of thick ice on the surface of jupiter . voyager first studied jupiter ' s atmosphere in 1992 and returned it in 2000 . the cassini spacecraft visited the planet in 2000 and took more detailed measurements of its atmosphere . the new horizons probe passed by jupiter in 2007 and took detailed measurements of jupiter and its moons ' atmosphere . the galileo spacecraft was the first to complete an orbit around jupiter , launching in 1995 and studying the planet until 2003 . during this time it collected a large amount of data about the solar system , making close approaches to three of the four known jupiter moons and finding evidence for thick ice around two of them , as well as the presence of liquid water beneath their surface . it also discovered the magnetic field around jupiter . as it approached jupiter , it also witnessed the passing of comet 111 – / 9 . in december 1995 , it sent an unmanned probe into the jupiter system , thus becoming the only spacecraft to do so . in july 2016 , the kepler spacecraft , launched in 2011 , completed its orbital science mission successfully , and is currently in orbit around jupiter and preparing for its next mission . the european space agency launched the l1 @ - @ up science probe in 2012 as part of its science probe program toand one of jupiter ' s four moons , with a small lunar orbit provided by roscosmos . juice is expected to be launched in 2022 . = = energy specifications = = missions from earth to other planets in the solar system have a significant energy expenditure . it requires roughly the same amount of energy for a spacecraft to reach jupiter from earth ' s orbit as it requires to lift it into orbit in the first place . in physics , this energy cost is known as the net change in the spacecraft ' s mass , or delta @ - @ v . the energy required to reach jupiter from low earth orbit is a delta @ - @ v of about 10 km / s , similar to the delta @ . @ − – ##0 @ . @ 10 km / s to reach a low earth orbit from the sun . gravity assist on planetary flybys ( such as from earth or mars ) can be used to reduce the energy energy ( i . e . the cost ) before jupiter , at the cost of a much longer flight time to reach a planet such as jupiter when compared to the original mission . rocket engines capable of a delta @ - @ v of more than 10 km / s were used on the galileo spacecraft . this is greater than a delta @ - @ v to reach to delta - @ - @ v launching from a circular system of the same radius as that of earth without gravity assist . a major problem with sending a probe to jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land , and there is a phase transition between the planet ' s atmosphere and its liquid environment . space spacecraft descending into the atmosphere are often killed by the high temperatures of jupiter . another major problem is the amount of radiation to which the space probe is exposed , due to the strong delta @ - @ v environment of jupiter ( for a better explanation see atmosphere of jupiter ) . for example , when pioneer 1 made its first approach to the planet , the amount of radiation was ten times more intense than pioneer ' s computer had anticipated , leading to fears that the probe would not survive . with a few minor modifications , the probe managed to pass through the asteroid barrier , but it lost most of the power of the planet itself , as the radiation levels caused pioneer ' s onboard delta ##meter to give incorrect readings . the larger and much more technically advanced voyager spacecraft had to be designed to cope with the radiation damage . during the three days the voyager spacecraft studied the planet , the planet ' s datait far exceeded its design goals , and its instruments failed on several occasions . the spacecraft ' s instruments also showed poor sensitivity , and electric interference ##s occurred between the rotating and ultra @ - @ rotating components , causing it to enter failure mode , which led to the loss of the instruments from the 17th , 25th and 26th stages . the electrical exposure caused significant changes in jupiter ' s non @ - @ rotating harmonic structure . = = flyby ##s = = = = = voyager program ( 1973 and 1974 ) = = = the first spacecraft to photograph jupiter was pioneer 10 , which flew to the planet in october 1973 , followed by pioneer 11 two months later . pioneer 10 obtained the first @ - @ and close @ - @ up images of jupiter and its many moons ; the probe studied the planet ' s atmosphere , measured its magnetic field , observed its radiation , and determined that water is a ring . pioneer 11 made its closest approach , within about 100 @ , @ 000 km of jupiter ' s cloud tops , on july 5 , 1974 . it obtained detailed images of the great red spot , made the first observations of jupiter ' s two ice caps , and measured the shape of jupiter ' s moon io . the data gathered by these three missions helped engineers and scientists evaluate the ability of space spacecraft to deal more effectively with the environment around the giant planet . = = = voyager 1 ( 1979 ) = = = voyager 1 began studying jupiter in january 1979 and made its closest approach on march 1 , 1979 , at a distance of 349 @ , @ 000 km from jupiter ' s surface . this closer approach allowed for greater spatial resolution , but the flyby ' s short duration meant that no observations of jupiter ' s surface , atmosphere , magnetic fields , and surrounding terrain were made during the 12 @ - @ up period of the mission , even though voyager 1 continued studying the planet until 1979 . it was soon followed by voyager 2 , which made its closest approach on march 1 , 1979 , 576 @ , @ 000 km away from the planet ' s cloud tops . the spacecraft discovered jupiter ' s moons , discovered the gas in its atmosphere , discovered the volcanoes on io , a phenomenon similar to plate ##ning on earth , and discovered volcanoes on io . the voyager ##s greatly expanded our understanding of the giant planet , and also discovered jupiter ' s rings . they also obtained the first close @ - @ up images of the planet ' s surface , and the great red spotand a dust system moving in a 1 @ - @ inclination direction . many complex structures and disturbances were found in the ring system ( see image on the right ) . two new , smaller moons , adrastea and europa , were discovered orbiting just outside the system , making them the first of jupiter ' s moons to be discovered by a spacecraft . a third small moon , europa , was found orbiting the moons of amalthea and europa . the discovery of volcanic activity on the planet io was the most scientific achievement of the mission , as it was the first time an active volcano was discovered on a planetary body other than earth . additionally , the images show the activity of the volcanoes on io , as well as evidence for other events observed during the voyager encounters . europa showed a large number of surface fracture features in the low @ - @ resolution images from voyager 1 . at first , scientists thought the features might be geological features , caused by internal rifting or other processes . the high @ - @ resolution photos from voyager 2 , taken closer to jupiter , left scientists puzzled because the features in these images were almost entirely circular in surface features . this led scientists to conclude that these features might be similar to ice caps on europa , and that europa may have a liquid water atmosphere . europa may be rapidly cooling due to solar heating to a rate about 1 @ - @ times that of jupiter , and as a result , the moon is thought to have a continental crust more than 30 kilometers ( 19 miles ) full of water ice , probably based in a 100 @ - @ , @ - @ - ( 100 km ) ocean . = = = = ( 1992 ) = = = on december 22 , 1992 , the ulysses space probe flew past jupiter ' s north pole at a distance of 451 @ , @ 000 km . this 100 @ - @ inclination jupiter was sufficient for it to enter a very high @ - @ inclination orbit around the sun , increasing its inclination to the sun to 1 @ . @ 000 km . the giant planet ' s gravity forced the probe ' s flightpath down and away from the ecliptic plane , forcing it into a circular orbit between the sun ' s north and south poles . the size and inclination of the spacecraft ' s orbit were adjusted to a much larger radius , so that its orbit lay at about 1 au ( jupiter ' s distance from the sun ) , while its inclination was well over 10 au ( jupiter ' s distance from the sun ) . during mission flight - , theit made observations of the planet ' s atmosphere . since the probe had no instruments , no images were taken . in january 2004 , the probe flew again in the surface of jupiter . this time the distance from the planet was much less — than 240 ##0 km — and it allowed for observations of jupiter . = = = cassini ( 2000 ) = = = in 2000 , the cassini probe , en route to saturn , flew by jupiter and captured some of the highest @ - @ resolution images ever taken of the planet . it made its closest approach on december 19 , 2000 , and made several more observations . approximately 100 @ , @ 000 images of jupiter were taken during the 2000 @ - @ 000 flyby . this was the most detailed optical surface images of jupiter ever , in which the main surface features were about 60 km ( 37 mi ) apart . a major study of the flyby , taken on december 31 , 2003 , was of jupiter ' s atmospheric features . dark craters , with bright clouds in the atmosphere , and the belts , with their dark color , had long been thought by scientists to be composed of upwelling gas , possibly because most dark craters appear to be caused by rising pressure . analysis of cassini images revealed that the dark belts contained large dark zones of upwelling low @ - @ @ clouds , too distant to see from earth . anthony del genio of nasa ' s goddard center for planetary studies stated that " the belts must be the areas of high @ - @ @ air pressure on jupiter , [ because ] the exact size of the atmosphere has to be known " . the surface features included a large dark area of bright low @ - @ clouds , about the size of the largest black hole , near jupiter ' s north pole . infrared spectroscopy showed areas of haze at the poles , with areas of bright @ - @ high haze , and dark clouds moving in opposite directions . the same study also revealed the nature of jupiter ' s rings . infrared scattering from particles in the atmosphere showed the rings were roughly round ( rather than spherical ) and probably formed as ejecta from asteroid impacts on jupiter ' s surface , possibly including europa and adrastea . on december 30 , 2000 , the cassini probe took a 2000 @ - @ low @ - @ resolution image of the planet himalia , but it was too dark to show any atmospheric features . = = = new horizons ( 2007 ) = = = the new horizons probe , en route to saturn , flew by jupiter for a gravitational probe and wasthe first spacecraft headed directly towards jupiter since the voyager in 1990 . the long baseline infrared imager ( lorri ) took its first image of jupiter on november 22 , 2006 . the spacecraft began its studies of the jupiter system in december 2006 , and made its closest approach on march 31 , 2007 . although close to jupiter , new horizons ' cameras made accurate observations of the orbits of jupiter ' s inner moons , including amalthea . the spacecraft ' s cameras observed stars on jupiter , studied all the inner moons in jupiter , and performed extensive @ - @ distance studies of the outer moons himalia and elara . the probe also studied jupiter ' s central bright spot and the planet ' s large and complex solar system . on march 31 , 2007 the camera and data processing system experienced an internal software problem and reset itself , allowing the spacecraft to go into eva mode . the spacecraft was recovered within two days , with no data found from jupiter ' s magnetotail . no significant impacts or events were associated with the impact . due to the large size of the jupiter system and the relative proximity of the jupiter system to jupiter in comparison to the proximity of jupiter to jupiter , new horizons could send far more data to jupiter from the jupiter system than the io mission . = = = = = = = = = = ( 1995 – 2003 ) = = = the first spacecraft to visit jupiter was the galileo spacecraft , which went into orbit around jupiter on march 1 , 1995 . it studied the planet for nearly eight years , completing nine orbits before it was lost during a direct encounter with jupiter on november 4 , 2003 . during this period , galileo collected a large amount of data about the jupiter system ; the amount of data was not as significant as expected because the transmitter of its onboard @ - @ distance radio navigation system failed . the only events during the first @ - @ distance mission were direct flybys of two of the inner moons , as well as amalthea ( the first spacecraft to do so ) . galileo also observed the impact of comet levy – levy 8 as they approached jupiter in 1994 and the entry of an asteroid plume into the solar system in december 1995 . observers aboard the galileo spacecraft observed impacts of comet levy – levy 8 on 18 and 19 december 1994 when they collided with jupiter ' s southern hemisphere at a speed of about 10 kilometers per second . this was the first direct observation of an asteroid and of solar system objects . although the collision took place onthe planet of jupiter far from earth , io , located at a distance of 2 @ . @ 000 k from the planet , was able to observe the events as they occurred . its sensors observed a gas that had a surface temperature of about 2 @ , @ 000 k , compared to the normal jupiter cloudtop temperature of about 300 k ( − 143 ° c ) , with the smoke from the explosion reaching a height of over 2 @ , @ 000 k . the eva probe was launched from the planet in june 1995 , entering the planet ' s atmosphere on july 15 , 1995 . after a 10 @ - @ deep penetration into the upper atmosphere , the probe discovered the remains of its heat shield , and then passed within 100 km of the planet , collecting data for 1 @ . @ 3 g , before being destroyed by the pressure and heat to which it was exposed ( about 10 % the pressure , with a temperature of 153 ° c ) . it would have melted thereafter , and then exploded . the galileo probe itself suffered a more extreme version of the same fate when it was accidentally crashed into the atmosphere on july 7 , 2003 at a speed of about 100 km / s , in order to eliminate the risk of jupiter crashing into and destroying io . major scientific achievements of the galileo mission include : the first observation of gas gas in the planet ' s atmosphere — the atmosphere contains ammonia # ##s from magma boiling up from ocean layers ; observation of intense volcanic activity on io — which is 100 times greater than that seen on earth ; the size and frequency of eruptions , characteristic of the volcanoes ; observation of strong chemical ##s in io ' s atmosphere which produce strong magnetic fields that extend to io ' s gravity ; experimental evidence for supporting the hypothesis that liquid oceans exist on io ' s rocky surface ; the observation of a strong magnetic field around a planet ( jupiter ) ; infrared field observations suggesting that europa , io and io have a 10 @ - @ outer layer on the rocky sky ; evidence for a thick outer layer around europa , ganymede , and io known as the ' liquid @ - @ - ring ' ; observation of the formation of the rings of jupiter ( rocky material breaking up by large particles which fall into the planet ' s two thick inner rings ) and existence of two such rings and the formation of a third ring on amalthea ' s surface ; observations of the internal structure and composition of the giant planet ' s atmosphere . on february 7 , 2013 , nasa reported, based on data from the juno mission , the discovery of " - @ - @ - minerals " ( minerals , phyllosilicates ) , possibly associated with organic compounds , in the northern surface of europa , north of jupiter . the formation of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an asteroid or comet according to the results . = = = juno ( 2016 ) = = = esa launched juno on december 4 , 2011 to study jupiter in space from a polar orbit when it launched in 2016 . the spacecraft will be placed in a polar orbit to study the planet ' s atmosphere , gravitational field , magnetic field , and the oceans . juno will also search for information about how life forms , including whether the planet has a solid core , the amount of oxygen contained in the ice ocean , and how the oxygen is dissolved throughout the atmosphere . juno will also study jupiter ' s stellar winds , which can reach speeds of 600 km / s . juno began studying jupiter on the morning of 4 december 2016 . = = = jupiter icy moon explorer ( 2022 ) = = = esa ' s jupiter icy moon explorer ( juice ) has been selected as part of esa ' s cosmic ray astronomy program . it is set to launch in 2022 and , after a series of flybys of the inner solar system , return in 2030 . in 2012 , the european space agency ' s selected the jupiter icy moon explorer ( juice ) as its next european mission , following its successor to ejsm , the european jupiter explorer ( jgo ) . the funding for the european jupiter system mission has since ended , but esa will continue to support the juno mission with instruments and an infrastructure . = = proposed missions = = the europa mission was a mission proposed to esa to focus on studying jupiter ' s moon europa . in december 2013 , plans were announced for " pre @ - @ research and / or project ##s for a mission that supports the mission goals set for the jupiter system mission , the most ambitious european decadal mission " . the europa mission would be set to launch in the early 2020s and reach jupiter in a pre @ . @ - @ period . the spacecraft would pass around the moon several times to study environmental levels . = = = proposed missions = = = because of the discovery of ice ice deposits on jupiter ' s moons europa , io and io , there has been renewed interest in studying the icy crust of europa . these issues have slowed this . the europa mission is a proposed europa mission tomission , which was launched in 2002 . its primary objectives include determining the presence or absence of a deep ocean and identifying possible sites for future space missions . esa ' s jimo ( jupiter - europa mission ) , which was launched in 2005 , and the esa jupiter moons survey mission were also planned , but were replaced by the esa jupiter system mission . the esa jupiter system mission ( ejsm ) is a joint nasa / esa project for exploration of jupiter and its moons . in october 2009 it was announced that both space agencies had given this mission priority ahead of the esa - v mission . the proposal included a launch date of march 2020 and development of the esa @ - @ led jupiter europa mission , and the esa @ - @ led jupiter europa mission . esa ' s proposal has faced stiff challenges from other esa missions . notably , the jupiter europa mission ( jeo ) , esa ' s proposal , was considered by the international decadal survey to be too expensive . the survey recommended a cheaper alternative to jeo . = = human exploration = = = scientists use geological data to determine the presence of the ice rocks on jupiter , and icy moons are the best opportunity for further human exploration . potential candidates include mars , due to its potential for colonization , and io , due to its relatively low radiation levels . in 2003 , nasa announced a program called jupiter outer planets exploration ( ape ) that involves human astronauts to explore the icy moons . nasa has proposed a colonization mission some time in the 2040s . in the partnership for space exploration , published in december 2004 , nasa proposed missions to europa , suggesting that a " human exploration mission " would be expected on jupiter ' s moons . after the jimo mission was cancelled , nasa director sean o ' keefe stated that " human explorers will follow . " = = = potential for colonization = = = nasa has focused on the possibility of studying the atmosphere of the outer planets , especially for the @ - @ gas , an isotope of hydrogen that is found on earth and could have a very high value per unit mass of nuclear fuel . spacecraft stationed on jupiter could capture the fuel and supply it to other spacecraft . however , the solar atmosphere of jupiter has many challenges for humans because of the strong magnetic fields present in jupiter ' s atmosphere and the planet ' s very high gravity field . this would give about 500 sv ( 3600 °c ) per year to human colonists on earth and mars 5 @. @ 1 sv ( 540 ms ) per day to the radiation on jupiter , which is a significant factor due to the fact that even known exposure to about 0 @ . @ 1 sv over a period of a few days is likely to cause radiation poisoning , and even 1 sv in a few days is dangerous . europa is the solar system ' s largest moon and the solar system ' s only known moon with a crater , but this does not protect it from electromagnetic rays to any significant degree , because it is surrounded by jupiter ' s magnetic field . europa receives about 0 @ . @ 08 sv ( 1 ms ) of radiation per day . it is far from jupiter ' s outer radiation , and subject to only 0 @ . @ 0001 sv ( 0 @ . @ 01 sv ) per day . for comparison , the average amount of radiation received from earth by a living person is about 0 @ . @ 0024 sv per day ; the highest known radiation levels on earth were found at ramsar hot springs at about 0 @ . @ 100 sv per year . one of the first sites studied in the artemis project was europa . the idea of building a surface base on europa was abandoned , because of the high radiation levels at this distance from earth and its geological features . europa is the only known planet for which surface exploration is possible . the levels of cosmic radiation on earth , jupiter , and io are dangerous to human ##kind , and specific safety measures have yet to be developed . it could be possible to build a surface base that would provide resources for human exploration of the solar system . in 1997 , the artemis project proposed a plan to explore europa . according to this plan , humans would dive deep into the thick ice cap , into the deep underground ocean , where they would find deep ice caves .
