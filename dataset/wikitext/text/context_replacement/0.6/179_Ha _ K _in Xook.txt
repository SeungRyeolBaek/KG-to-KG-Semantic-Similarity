= ha ' k ' in xook = ha ' k ' in xook ( maya pronunciation : [ haʔ ' ’ ##n ʃoːk ] ) , also known as ruler 6 , was an ajaw of piedras negras , an ancient maya city in mexico . he reigned during the late classic period , from 767 – 780 ad . ha ' k ' in xook was the son of itzam k ' an ahk ii , and he ascended the throne upon the death of his brother , yo ' nal ahk iii . ha ' k ' in xook ' s reign appears to have ended either with his death or his overthrow in favor of his successor k ' inich yat ahk ii ; historians and mayanists have not come to a firm conclusion on this . ha ' k ' in xook left behind several artifacts , including one from piedras negras and a stone block from el porvenir . in addition , a stone block known as monument , which was used by k ' inich yat ahk ii , records either the death or reign of ha ' k ' in xook . = = = = = = = = history of piedras negras = = = ha ' k ' in xook , who has also been referred to as ruler 6 , was probably the son of itzam k ' an ahk ii , based on a fragment of psalm 1 . according to archaeologists john jenkins and nikolai grube , as well as others , ha ' k ' in xook ' s name translates to " turtle - god " . of note , his name does not include a water shell , a feature found on all the previous rulers of piedras negras , as well as his predecessors . he ascended the throne on january 6 , 767 ad ( 1 @ . @ 1 @ . @ 1 @ . @ 14 @ . @ 0 , or ha ' in . , . the population day ) , upon the death of his brother yo ' nal ahk iii . ha ' k ' in xook ' s reign of piedras negras had previously been described by tatiana proskouriakoff , who had gave the title ruler 6 to the misidentified sajal — ##an ' king — of el paz . not much is known about the reign of ha ' k ' in xook ; his reign , along with that of yo ' nal ahk iii , has been referredto the " weak " . john clancy , and john a . fitzsimmons notes that ha ' k ' in xook seems to have been a weak ruler when compared to the reign of itzam k ' ul ahk , because ha ' k ' in xook left few monuments , and he did not exercise his power on a large scale , choosing instead to do so against local levels . the only known historical event that has been recorded during the reign of ha ' k ' in xook is of an event that took place at el cayo , most likely related to the death of a certain sajal . according to zachary nathan ##s , the reign of ha ' k ' in xook seems to have been relatively free from violence , as none of his surviving monuments show signs of violence , and the inscriptions do not show any kind of " civil unrest " in the military during his reign . = = = death or capture = = = ha ' k ' in xook ascended the throne on may 17 , 780 ad ( 17 @ . @ . @ . @ . @ . @ 17 @ . @ . @ chuwen 8 . ) . the reason why his reign came to an end has been a matter of debate . some believe that his reign ended with his death . throne 1 , when damaged , indicates that he " lost / lost power " , which the mayanist john a . smith takes to mean that he resigned in favor of his successor , k ' inich yat ahk ii . mayanist john smith has notes that the change on the monument " suggests a very small role on the king ' s part " , and that " ' lost ' would be more appropriate as far as this interpretation goes . " however , the correct inscription on the throne is yaktaaj ajawlel , which is the same phrase that was used when the " reins " of power passed from k ' ak ' tiliw chan yopaat , the k ' ul ahaw of quirigua , to his son chan xul during his reign two years before his death in 785 ad . as such , this would indicate that , rather than resigning , ha ' k ' in xook died in 780 ad , and his successor , k ' inich yat ahk ii , took over residence there . the maya texts on throne 1 indicate that k ' inich yat ahk ii had " succeeded " ha ' k ' in xookand the foundation tree , in this context , and that the unknown king may have also reigned in the presence of ha ' k ' in xook , according to archaeologist oswaldo garcia mazariegos . however , k ' inich yat ahk ii took over the throne on may 17 , 781 ad ( 2 @ . @ 10 @ . @ 17 @ . @ 12 @ . @ . . k ' in ##ich yaxk ' a ) , about a year after the end of ha ' k ' in xook ' s reign . despite this time period , there appears to be no record of anyone ruling piedras negras between the two dates . = = = = = = = = = = = = several monuments have been found that were dedicated to ha ' k ' in xook , including monuments 13 , 14 , and 15 . monument 13 would seem to be the oldest , and the earliest dedicatory image known to ha ' k ' in xook , and it " represents the beginning of the 4 @ - @ motif here . " this 4 @ . @ . @ - @ . ( 7 @ . @ 130 ft ) tall monument contains many elements of other maya monuments , but also has a unique theme . it depicts the king scattering incense , similar to those found at piedras negras monuments 2 and 3 . clancy has suggested that the image has been related to three things : death , " the offering " , and death . this is represented via the image of ha ' k ' in xook scattering the incense . this motif had been used earlier into the founding of piedras negras by k ' inich yo ' nal ahk ii . the image also depicts ha ' k ' in xook wearing a golden crown ; it is described as being composed of intricate feathers and two feathers , a large white feather crown , and a large head cap made from a deer skin and a gold cord . it has been suggested that this image was inspired by the one worn by the unknown king from the temple depicted on monument 2 . clancy argues that this image is a representation of " the central spirit of death " , due to its iconographic similarity to the one at piedras negras . in fact , monument 13 is ha ' k ' in xook ' s only ste ##la .not much remains of monument 18 , and what is left is badly damaged . however , william john martin noted that it has a calendar round date of 17 ahaw ##k ##l ' ayab ( equivalent to a long count year of 6 @ . @ 0 @ . @ 0 @ . @ 0 @ . @ , @ c . 17 , 775 ) , which martin and grube believe occurred from ha ' k ' in xook ' s reign . monument 13 is the king ' s burial monument . heavily inscribed on all four sides , this monument is in poor condition because it fell over and collapsed . the only fragments recovered are the base , and part of a single row of monuments that represent the names of several kings . as to monument 18 , martin and grube believe that monument 23 refers to the son of ha ' k ' in xook because the calendar round date on the monument is identical with the one given on monument 18 . this monument records the puluuy utz ' itil burial for ha ' k ' in xook ' s deceased son , itzam k ' an ahk ii , and , when completed , means " ruler 2 [ ha ' k ' in xook ] , son of ruler 1 [ itzam k ' an ahk ii ] … succeeded to the throne " , thus indicating that ha ' k ' in xook was indeed the son of itzam k ' an ahk ii . all three of the monuments were discovered by teoberto martin in 1901 in ruins of the city ' s main temple , the 4 @ - @ u temple . monument 23 was probably erected on a platform accessed by the pyramid ' s main stairway , and pyramid 18 is in a plaza in the plaza in front of the main pyramid . monument 23 , on the other hand , was erected at the very base of the pyramid . this monument was most likely the burial place for itzam k ' an ahk ii , and — , as how ha ' k ' in xook , yo ' nal ahk ii , and k ' inich yat ahk ii all used the pyramid as a burial site — , is enough used to support the theory that ha ' k ' in xook was the son of itzam k ' an ahk ii . = = = = = = = as mentioned above , monument 23 was either the accession or burial of ha ' k ' in xook .however , it should be noted that the throne was not occupied by the king himself , but rather by his son , k ' inich yat ahk ' . the throne was apparently partially torn up by piedras negras ' s soldiers , and has since been restored . in addition to the @ - @ s artifacts and artifacts , a fragment of pottery found at el porvenir and now named the " el porvenir stone " was also found that bears the name of k ' k ' an xook .
