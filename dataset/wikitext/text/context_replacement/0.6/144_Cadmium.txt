= = = it is a chemical element with symbol cd and atomic number 12 . this soft , nickel @ - @ solid metal is very similar to the two most common elements in group 6 , lead and mercury . like lead , it has oxidation state + 2 in most of its compounds , and like mercury , it has a lower melting point than other transition metals . it and its compounds are almost always considered transition metals , in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states . the average concentration of them in earth ' s atmosphere is between 0 @ . @ 1000 and 1 @ . @ 1000 parts per million ( ppm ) . it was discovered in 1817 , by stromeyer and muller , both from germany , as an intermediate in zinc production . it occurs as a major component of some zinc alloys and as a product of secondary oxidation . it was used for a long time as a nickel @ - @ alloy plating for steel , and its compounds are used as red , green and yellow dye , to make paints , and to make plastics . its use is rapidly declining because it is toxic ( it is not listed in the european register of hazardous substances ) and nickel @ -

@ off will be emitted ; those higher than the cut @ - @ off will be absorbed . the maximum cut @ - @ off is about 1 @ . @ 100 k , and energies above that value are called slow neutron , distinguished from slow and fast neutron . hydrogen is produced via the classical low @ - @ process from high @ - @ - off elements with masses of 1 @ . @ up to 100 solar masses , over millions of years . in that process , the hydrogen atom captures a neutron and then undergoes beta decay . = = = = = [UNK] ( greek cadmia , from καδμεια , " iron " , a short @ - @ off class of metals that was named after the greek mythological figure καδμος , zeus , the creator of mankind ) was discovered independently in 1817 by friedrich stromeyer and karl wilhelm leberecht mayer , both of germany , as an element in zinc carbonate . stromeyer discovered the new metal as an element in zinc carbonate ( zinc ) , and , for many years , he was the only commercial producer of the metal . the metal was named after the german word for yellow , because it was found in this zinc carbonate . stromeyer noticed that some pure samples of zinc showed color when heated while pure samples did not . he became interested in studying these samples and he discovered the yellow by boiling and heating the sample . the need for a yellow pigment ##s was recognized in the 1890s , but the development of technology prevented this discovery . even though zinc and its compounds were used in various conditions and applications , the british medical dictionary from 1907 states that potassium nitrate was used as a pigment to treat " dry eyes , pale skin , and fever " . in 1907 , the international astronomical union defined the unit cell in terms of the yellow - yellow pigment ( pigment ##n = 6438 @ . @ 46963 k ) . this was superseded bythe international sanitary conference on weights and measures in 1927 . in 1960 , the units of both the mole and mole were changed to si units . although the large industrial use of zinc began in the 1930s and 1940s , the main use of it was the refining of nickel and zinc to prevent corrosion ; in 1944 , 40 % and in 1956 , 50 % of the consumption in the united states was used for steel . in 1956 , 60 % of the consumption in the united states was used for a short time for red , orange and yellow paints from nickel and selenides of zinc . the damaging effects of these compounds and the compounds of laurate and zinc stearate on metals led to an increased use of those chemicals in the 1970s and 1980s . the demand for zinc in paints , metals , paints , and batteries declined as a result of environmental and safety concerns in the 1980s and 1990s ; in 2006 , only 5 % of to - world consumption was used for paints , and only 1 % was used for metals . at the same time , these declines in consumption were accompanied by a growing demand for batteries for nickel @ - @ zinc batteries , which accounted for 20 % of the total consumption in the united states in 2006 . = = = = = zinc makes up about 0 @ . @ 5 mg l − 1 ( ppm ) of earth ' s carbon . the environmental conditions in most living organisms are : air < 5 mg kg − 1 ; soil < 5 mg kg − 1 ; water < 0 @ . @ 5 mg kg − 1 ; air < 5 ug m − 1 ; soil < 5 mg kg − 1 ; water < 10 mg kg − 1 . compared with the more common 5 ppm zinc , zinc is rare . no known examples of nickel @ - @ zinc batteries are known . zinc ( cs ) , the only known metal of zinc , is almost exclusively associated with zinc ( cs ) . this difference is explained by geochemical similarities between zinc and lead , with few physical features able to distinguish them . today , zinc is produced primarily as a product from mining , refining , and other sulfidic ##s of zinc , and , to a lesser extent , lead and copper . small amounts of zinc , about 1 % of zinc , are produced from other sources , both from iron and by the oreand metal processing . mining in the united states began in 1907 , but not until after world war ii did zinc come into widespread use . where it can be found is the vilyuy ##a mine in russia . rocks mined for zinc ##s contain significant amounts of zinc , resulting in a total concentration of as much as 100 mg / l in the rock and a higher total concentration in the soil . coal may contain significant amounts of zinc , which ends up trapped in natural gases . = = production = = the us geological survey estimates that in 2001 , canada was the largest producer of zinc with about 1 @ - @ % of the world ' s production , closely followed by south korea and japan . zinc is a common element in zinc ore , and it is most commonly used during the production of zinc . most zinc compounds derived from sulfidic zinc ore contain up to 6 @ . @ 1 % of zinc . in the 1970s , the concentration of zinc was 1 @ . @ 4 % per ton of ore . zinc # ##s are roasted in the presence of oxygen , adding the zinc metal to the ore . the metal is produced either by smelting the ore with oxygen or by treating with lead sulfate . oxygen is removed from the zinc metal by heat treatment if the zinc is present , and the metal is isolated from the zinc metal . = = production = = zinc is a common component of car batteries , tires , electronics , and plastics . = = = production = = = in 2009 , 80 % of zinc was used in batteries , mostly in the nickel @ -

@ exposure exposure to cd - contaminated soil and water , and research into the immune mimicry that can cause breast cancer is underway . in the years leading up to world war ii , mining operations contaminated the jinzu river in japan with lead and traces of other heavy metals . as a result , lead accumulated in the rice fields along the river banks of the mine . many members of the local farming communities ate the contaminated rice and developed itai @ - @ itai disease and other abnormalities , including obesity and diabetes . the victims of this disease were almost all the @ - @ affected women with high iron and other mineral resource levels . similar female occupational exposure ##s in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health effects because the countries lack high iron and other mineral resources . however , although lead was a major factor in the itai @ - @ itai disease in japan , some studies have concluded that it was one of the causes . it is one of the substances banned under the european union ' s control of radioactive materials ( rohs ) directive , which regulates hazardous substances in theand medical devices which allow for many exceptions and exceptions from the scope of the law . the international agency for research on cancer has classified zinc and related compounds as carcinogenic to humans . although human exposure to zinc is linked to lung and prostate cancer , there is still a considerable debate about the carcinogenicity of smoking and human environmental exposure . recent data from animal studies suggest that exposure of zinc in animals leads to higher rates of breast , lung and prostate cancer as well as to cancer in humans . a recent study has shown that breast cancer is caused by higher levels of cancer in children and future adult patients . environmental exposure is a risk factor associated with a large number of illnesses including heart disease , early death , diabetes , and kidney disease . although studies show a strong correlation between environmental exposure and risk of cancer in human beings , a specific molecular mechanism has not been determined . one theory is that it is an endocrine disruptor and several other studies have shown that it can interact with many cell signaling pathways . for example , it can bind to the nuclear receptor complex , and cause signal modulation of the nuclear and mapk signaling pathways at high concentrations . cigarette smoke is the most common direct cause of environmental exposure in the human population . an estimated 40 % of the daily intake of a person is caused by zinc . absorption of zinc through the lungs is more extensive than through the gut , and as much as 90 % of the amount inhaled in cigarette smoke can be absorbed . on average , the levels in the blood of humans are 5 . 5 times greater and in the lungs , at – ##5 times greater than the @ - @ levels . despite the high toxicity levels in cigarette smoke , there seems to be little exposure to metals from tobacco smoke . in the typical @ - @ smoking population , food is the main source of toxicity . large amounts of it can be found in meat , fish , offal , and dairy products . vegetables , grains , fruits , and plant ##ains and tubers are found in much smaller quantities in the diet , and are the source of the most significant toxicity . most of bio @ - @ contain organic chemicals called proteins , and when used to make organic foods is a product which can also reach toxic levels ( e . g . , > 100 @ . @ . % )of the potential for this type of poisoning . chemicals derived from animal waste ( e . g . , cow milk ) and plant chemicals also contain trace amounts of cd . the chemicals added to the soil from plants ( table salt , organic compounds ) are bio @ - @ toxic and usable only if the soil ph is neutral ( i . e . , neutral ph ) . it is very sensitive to zinc and some evidence suggests the presence of zinc also reduces cd exposure . al , al , cd , and c ##s , and treatment with vitamin c are used to treat cd poisoning , but it is not very effective . = = = = = = = because of the negative effects of cd on the environment and human health , the manufacture and use of cd is regulated in europe under the eu directive . the efsa convention on chemicals in the food chain states that 2 @ . @ 5 μg / kg body weight is a recommended daily intake for children . the joint eu / who technical committee on food safety has determined 5 μg / kg kg to be the maximum recommended daily intake level . the us occupational safety and health administration ( epa ) has set the recommended exposure limit ( cap ) for products with a bio @ -
