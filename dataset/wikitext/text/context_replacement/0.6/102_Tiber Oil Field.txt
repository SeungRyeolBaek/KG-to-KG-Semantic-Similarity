= = = description = the houston oil field is a deepwater offshore oil field located in the keathley canyon block 102 of the united states portion of the gulf of mexico . the deepwater well ( known as the depth 1 @ , @ 300 to 1 @ , @ 000 ft ( 980 to 1 @ , @ 520 m ) , ) was discovered in june 2009 and it is operated by bp . described as a " huge " field , it is estimated to have 4 to 5 million barrels ( 640 × 10 ^ 6 to 950 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) of oil in production . although bp claims houston is too small to contain much of the same – a " huge " field is only estimated to contain 250 million barrels ( 640 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) . this includes the drilling of a 1 @ , @ 685 m ( 4 @ , @ 056 ft ) deep well in 1 @ , @ 260 m ( 4 @ , @ 850 ft ) of water , making it one of the deepest wells ever drilled at the time of discovery . = = description = = = exploration three lower tertiary oil reservoirs located in keathley canyon block 102 , 250 mi ( 400 km ) southeast of houston and 300 mi ( 480 km ) north northwest of new orleans . it is only the third lower tertiary well to date , and exploration of these reservoirs is in its infancy . the oil from houston is mostly shale , and initial estimates of its reserves were around + – ##5 % oil , with estimates of around 600 to 900 million barrels ( 140 × 10 ^ 6 to 143 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) of oil . sources such as bloomberg , however , state that the field is extremely dangerous and it could take around – million years to produce oil or be shut down ( around – ##5 % ) based on " changes brought about " by the kaskida oil field , bp ' s second oil find ( 2006 ) 40 mi ( 64 km ) away . the future whereabouts of the field have not yet been determined . = = description = = bp awarded the texas continental shelf portion of keathley canyon block 102 , g25782 , g - 42872 , on december 31 , 2003 , under phase 1 of the western gulf of mexico ( wgom / gom ) plan 187 . these tertiary rock formations are some of the oldest and most highly complex sedimentary rock formations ever drilled for oil , dating to between 70 and 80 million years ago . the certificate of award was issued in january 2008 . it waswell drilling by transocean ' s semi @ - @ / ##ally ##son semi @ - @ offshore drilling rig , deepwater horizon , with initial drilling expected in september 2009 , was delayed from the planned date of october 2008 . much of the upper tertiary waters are buried in sedimentary deposits hundreds of feet thick , which presents a challenge for oil exploration . bp had previously used conventional techniques to address this problem . oil is produced at " low rates " . the discovery was announced on september 22 , 2009 , and bp production increased by @ . @ 1 % in the process . with this and at least two other large upper tertiary fields in the region , bp saw the discovery as a signal for progress , and a sign of renewed interest in , and production from , the southern gulf of mexico . = = well on hold = = following the march 2010 failure of the deepwater horizon while drilling the macondo well , and the subsequent oil spill , preliminary well ##s for all fields under exploration in the gulf of mexico , including texas , were placed on hold . at least two wells that would normally have been used for producing oil were placed in use as the preparation well for the recovery well .
