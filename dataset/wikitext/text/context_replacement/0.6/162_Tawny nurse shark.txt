= = nurse shark = the australian nurse shark ( nebrius ferrugineus ) is a species of carpet shark in the family ginglymostomatidae , and the only known member of the genus nebrius . it is found mainly along coasts of the indo @ - @ zone , in caves , sandy beaches , and reef slopes from relatively shallow water to a depth of 70 m ( 230 ft ) . with a cylindrical body and a large , rounded head , the australian nurse shark is very similar in appearance to the carpet shark ( circus cirratum ) of the central and western pacific , from which it can be distinguished by its long @ - @ tipped dorsal fin and short , short @ - @ tipped anal fin . the maximum total length of the australian nurse shark is 2 @ . @ 3 m ( 10 ft ) . nocturnal in nature , the australian nurse shark tends to spend the day sleeping in groups of a dozen or more individuals in mud or rock pools . at night , it is an active @ - @ - shark that uses its powerful bite force to snatch food from tree trunks and rocks . the diet of this species consists primarily of fish , but they also eat small invertebrates , small bony fishes , and small sea ##weed . it is also reproductive , and the young develop from egg capsules of the female . it is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous , feeding on eggs laid by the male and not the female . the litter size may be as small as one or two , depending on the relative size of the @ - @ and ##ites . compared to the carpet shark , the australian nurse shark has a more primitive appearance and will not allow humans to approach and play with it . however , it should be shown aggressively due to its powerful jaws and sharp teeth . this species is caught by commercial fisheries throughout much of its range for food , fish , olive oil , salt , and fishmeal . it is also popular as a game fish in queensland , australia , and is known for its habit of releasing venom from the mouths of its prey . the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) has listed the australian nurse shark as vulnerable , with populations in protected areas considered vulnerable or extinct . = = taxonomy and phylogeny = = the australian nurse shark was first described by french naturalist rene @ - @primevere , as scyllium ferrugineum , based on a short @ . @ 1 m ( 3 ft 3 in ) long specimen from new caledonia . his own description was published in 1831 as voyage en fin du monde , a la ile de france . a more detailed description , along with an illustration , was published by german naturalist eduard ruppell in 1837 as nebrius concolor , based on a specimen from the red sea . both species were valid , but in different genera ( nana and nebrius nana ) , until they were synonymized by mario compagno in 1984 . compagno suggested that the body type names used to describe these species were the result of differences in morphology , with s . concolor replacing older specimens . the genus name nebrius is derived from the greek word nebris or nebridos , meaning the head of a shark . the specific name ferrugineus is latin for " short @ - @ colored " . other common names for this species include giant nurse shark , red shark ( a name coined by the american researcher david smith in the 1950s for the short @ - @ colored shark species ) , nurse shark , red catshark , nurse shark , nurse shark , red shark , and nurse shark . based on morphological characters , nebrius is considered to be the sister species of nana , with it being placed in a clade that also includes the short @ - @ colored nurse shark ( pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum ) , the nurse shark ( nana typus ) , and the nurse shark ( stegostoma fasciatum ) . = = distribution and species = = the giant nurse shark is widely distributed in the indo @ - @ bay ocean . in the indian ocean , it is found from kwazulu @ - @ bay , south africa , to the red sea , persian gulf and africa , including madagascar , mauritius , the chagos islands , the maldives , and the maldives . in the western pacific , it ranges from southern japan and the coast of china to the philippines , southeast asia , and australia , to as far south as the east coast of australia . in the eastern pacific , it has been reported from southern new caledonia , vanuatu , fiji , the hawaiian islands , and hawaii . fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in the pirabas formation of southern brazil , dating back to the late cretaceous ( c – ##0 ##b ) . the majority of these teethnote that the range of the brown nurse shark once extended to the western pacific ocean , prior to the formation of the gulf of panama . an oceanic species , the brown nurse shark prefers coastal and continental waters , including beaches and beds of rock , as well as on the lower slopes of coral and rocky reefs . this species can be found from the coastal zone , usually in water not deep enough to support its weight , to a maximum depth of 70 m ( 230 ft ) in coral reefs ; it is most common at a depth of 5 – + m ( 16 – + ft ) . these sharks are usually found in the shallow waters of reefs , but they can be found in a variety of habitats . = = = = = the brown nurse shark grows to a maximum size of 1 @ . @ 3 m ( 10 ft ) . it has a slender , elongated body with a slightly broad and flattened head . the nostrils are small and placed forward , with prominent ridges between them and small ridges behind . there is a pair of long , thin spines in front of the eyes . the mouth is small , with the upper jaw divided into 4 lobes . there are 20 – + tooth rows in the upper jaw and 26 – + tooth rows in the lower jaw , arranged in an oval ( triangular ) shape with the first of – + tooth rows separated from the rest by a narrow margin . each tooth forms a ridge , with a sharp edge leading to a short , sharp central point flanked by 3 - 4 small teeth on the sides . as the shark ages , the teeth become progressively longer and narrower . the fourth and fifth pairs of gill slits are located much closer together than the others . the dorsal and anal fins are large , with the first dorsal fin longer than the second . the anal fins are narrow , pointed , and elongated ( a @ - @ shaped ) ; their shape distinguishes this species from the a @ - @ shaped nurse shark . the origin of the first dorsal fin is nearly parallel with the origin of the anal fin , and the origin of the anal fin is parallel with or slightly behind the origin of the first dorsal fin . the caudal fin has a present upper lobe and a present lower lobe , measuring about a third of the total length in adults . the dorsal scales are a @ - @ shaped , with about – very faint lines radiating from the dorsal tip . brown nurse sharks are small , slender ,or ##yx brown above and gray @ - @ white below , and are capable of rapidly changing their coloration to better contrast with the background . these sharks have strongly contrasting upper ##parts . adult male nurse sharks caught off the coasts of japan , madagascar , and the ryukyu islands have a single dorsal fin . this unusual appearance has been speculated to result from the sharks being exposed to conditions of extreme water pressure and / or temperature , or from human exposure . in 1986 , a gray @ . @ 3 m ( 9 ft 10 in ) long adult male with both sexes ' dorsal fins and white eyes ( in the form of dark body colour with gray @ - @ white pupils ) was caught off wakayama prefecture , japan . this particular species is the largest nurse shark recorded to date , having lived for a long time in the wild despite a lack of predators . = = physiology and ecology = = with a more streamlined appearance than other nurse sharks , the japanese nurse shark is considered to be a more robust , more agile species . the proportions of its body , fins , fins , and tail are similar to other coral reef sharks in its genus , such as the sicklefin nurse shark ( tuna acutidens ) . japanese nurse sharks are primarily nocturnal , although they are known to be active at certain times off shore , and in addition they may be diurnally active if presented with food . during the day , groups of a dozen or more sharks can be found swimming in water and under rocks , or sleeping atop one another . nurse sharks have limited home ranges that they may return to each day . the japanese nurse shark has no known predators ; attacks by this species have been reported from tiger sharks ( carcharhinus leucas ) and southern hammerheads ( sphyrna mokarran ) , and the japanese nurse shark has been known to fall prey to sand sharks ( or ##ides ) and tiger rays ( tuna brevirostris ) . known parasites of this species include two species of tapeworms of the genus pedibothrium , which affect the shark ' s dorsal fin . = = = = = = = the japanese nurse shark may be one of the few species successful in feeding on humans . other known prey items include crabs , sea turtles , crustaceans ( e . g . crabs and shrimp ) , shrimp , and fish ( e . g . shrimp ,queenfish , and ##aman ) , and the madagascar sea lion . reproduction : the sharks lay ##s just under the sea ##bed , poking their heads into holes and holes . when a prey item is found , the shark rapidly opens its long , thin mouth , creating a strong sucking pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth . = = = life history = = = reproduction : the african nurse shark is known to occur from june to september in captivity . the females have one functional ovary and two functional nipples . the mode of reproduction is sexual viviparity , meaning that the eggs develop from the sperm ; females in captivity have been observed laying up to three - @ - @ viable egg masses , which has led to several reports of this species being female . the egg chambers of this species are - @ - @ shaped , with thick , hard , smooth walls . the african nurse shark is the only nurse shark in which there is oophagy : after the developing larvae exhaust their stores of food , they gorge the eggs laid by the females and develop the distended bodies typical of most oophagous sharks . unlike most other sharks , the eggs consumed by the sharks are large and shelled rather than soft and soft . there is no evidence of sibling rivalry as in the african tiger shark ( genus tiger ) . various studies have estimated the length at anywhere ranging from 40 to 80 cm ( 16 to 31 in ) , with the differences probably reflecting gender differences . although females lay up to three hundred eggs into a litter , the relatively small size of the eggs suggests that the litter size may be as small as one or two . in one captive female that had two females lay a single egg , one egg was significantly smaller and smaller than the other , suggesting that this may explain the smaller eggs . males reach sexual maturity at a length of 2 @ . @ 5 m ( 16 ft 5 in ) , and females at a length of 2 @ . @ . – ##0 @ . @ 9 m ( 19 ft 3 in – 29 ft 10 in ) . = = social interaction = = interactions with the other sharks may suggest a more friendly relationship than the other nurse sharks ; the males are known to ignore the sharks , and to approach and interact with them without fear . however , this species has been repeatedly tricked into mating ,and attracts attention due to its size , small , sharp teeth , and its powerful jaws . these nurse sharks are popular targets for ecotourist fishing off australia , the pacific islands , and japan . this species is adapt ##s to fishing and is kept in public waters in australia , the united states , thailand , and japan , where they may be large enough to survive over @ - @ fishing . the australian nurse shark is caught by commercial fisheries all over its range , mainly off australia , india , indonesia , and the philippines ; an exception is in philippine waters , where it is often caught in large numbers as well . this species is caught in demersal nets , floating and floating over @ ##nets , and on the @ - @ and @ - @ reef . the meat is sold fresh , dried and smoked , the fins are used for shark fin nets , and the skin processed into fishmeal . in addition , the meat is a source of minerals and protein , and the soft , tough skin is processed into @ ##cloth . off queensland , australia , the australian nurse shark is caught by over @ - @ fishing vessels . when caught , these sharks are tenacious swimmers and are difficult to catch due to their method of swimming . they are also capable of shooting a large amount of water into the mouths of their prey , making loud noises in these situations ( making the nurse shark one of the few species of shark to produce a roar ) ; whether this is a natural predatory behavior is unknown . the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) has assessed the australian nurse shark as vulnerable species , as it faces intense fishing pressure and its low population and survival rates limit the ability of many @ - @ fishing individuals to survive . additionally , this species ' s limited range makes it vulnerable to habitat destruction , illegal fishing practices ( e . g . fishing and hunting , particularly those in indonesia and the philippines ) , and human disturbance . population declines and declines of the australian nurse shark have been reported off indonesia and thailand . in california , this species has been assessed as of least concern , as such it is not targeted by fisheries . = california state route 243 = state route 243 ( sr 243 ) , or the 30 @ - @ idyllwild state highway , is a 30 @ - @ mile ( 48 km ) 30 @ - @ mile highway that runs from monterey , california ( in the south ) to idyllwild , in( of the state ) in riverside county , california . the highway is a connector between interstate 10 ( i @ - @ 10 ) and sr 243 . along its route , it provides access to the san bernardino national forest . the road from banning to idyllwild was built at the turn of the 20th century , and was paved by 1910 . the highway was added to the state highway system in 1970 . = = route = = = sr 243 begins at sr 74 in the san jacinto mountains of banning valley , riverside county as idyllwild road . the highway enters valley as a gravel road through the town of idyllwild . sr 243 makes a right turn at the intersection with riverside drive and passes through glen ##dora . the highway passes through the valley through the san jacinto national forest , twin peaks and the morongo indian reservation , making a few switchbacks and continuing its route to the city of banning as the old idyllwild scenic highway . the highway continues as san gorgonio avenue into the city , making a left onto riverside boulevard and a right onto main street and ending at a trumpet interchange with i @ - @ 10 . sr 243 is part of the national highway system , a network of highways that are important to the nation ' s economy , defense , and mobility . sr 243 is eligible for the national scenic highway system , and is also designated as a scenic highway by the california department of transportation ( caltrans ) , meaning that it is a continuous section of highway passing through a " natural landscape " with no " major intersections " , where the scenic designation has received considerable support with the public . in 2007 , it was named the esperanza firefighters memorial highway in honor of the firefighters who died while fighting the esperanza fire in august 2006 . in 2013 , sr 243 had an annual average daily traffic ( aadt ) of 9 @ , @ 650 at marion park road in idyllwild and san gorgonio avenue in banning , and 9 @ , @ 700 at the southern end in banning , the latter of which is the highest aadt for the highway . = = = = = the road from banning to idyllwild was under construction by 1904 , and 12 miles ( 19 km ) of the road was completed by 1906 , with an additional six miles ( 9 @ . @ 7 km ) of the road later . another six miles ( 9 @ . @ 7 km ) were added in 1908 . the entire road was completed byin 1910 , and offered a view of lake elsinore and the california coast , and it was used to assist with moving freight and passenger traffic ; because of this , the federal government paid $ 1 @ , @ 000 for the road . the road became a part of the state road system in 1927 . a new " low @ - @ gear " road from banning to idyllwild was under construction by 1935 , and two years later , the los angeles times reported the road to be " high @ - @ gear " . plans to improve the road were under way by 1950 . the road from banning through idyllwild to sr 195 was designated as county route r1 ( cr r1 ) in 1966 . by 1969 , plans were in place to extend the road to idyllwild to the county line of a county route ; however , state senator john dilworth introduced legislation to allow the road to be added to the state highway system if sr 195 was removed , since the former was of roughly the same length , and the latter was in the state . sr 243 was added to the state highway system in 1970 . the department of transportation began maintaining the route in 1971 . by 1998 , caltrans had announced plans to maintain the road through 2015 . = = major intersections = = except where marked with a letter , postmiles were measured on the road as it was when the route was designated , based on the alignment that existed at the time , and do not necessarily reflect traffic trends . r indicates a realignment in the route since then , m indicates a second realignment , l indicates an overlap due to a correction or change , and t indicates postmiles classified as temporary ( for a full list of definitions , see the list of postmile definitions ) . segments that remain unconstructed or have been relinquished to local control may be omitted . the entire route is in marin county . = = very few intersections = = gun ban due to the fact that gun @ - @ 243 serves idyllwild schools , pursuant to the gun @ - @ 243 school zone act of 1990 , firearms , including those in possession , will be within the meaning of 18 u . s . c . § 922 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) . the school zone , which is , as defined in 18 u . s . c . § 921 ( a ) ( 2 ) , approximately 50 acres . it will be , pursuant to 18 u . s . c .§ 924 ( a ) ( 2 ) , " convicted under this section , imprisonment for not more than five years , or both .
