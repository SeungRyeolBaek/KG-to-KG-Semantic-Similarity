= = rail = the corn rail , rail or landrail ( rail rail ) is a bird in the rail family . it breeds in europe and asia as far east as southern china , and migrate to africa for the northern hemisphere ' s winter . it is a medium @ - @ sized bird with brown - or black @ - @ or brown @ - @ coloured upperparts , white markings on the wings , and dark @ - @ coloured plumage with white @ - @ spots and white markings on the tail and undertail . the short bill is dark @ - @ coloured , the iris is pale grey , and the legs and feet are pale grey . juveniles are similar in appearance to adults , and the chicks are common , as with all rails . there are no subspecies , although birds from the east of the breeding range tend to be slightly paler than their western counterparts . the rail ' s call is a loud krek krek , from which the common name is derived . the corn rail is smaller than its close relative , the common rail , which shares its breeding range ; that species is much darker @ - @ coloured , and has a shorter bill . the corn rail ' s breeding habitat is woodland , including woodland , and it occupies open habitats on the agricultural side . this small bird builds a nest of dead grass in a hollow in the ground and lays two – dark brown @ - @ shaped eggs which are covered with rufous feathers . these hatch in about – ##0 days , and the pale coloured chicks hatch in about 2 weeks . this species is in rapid decline in much of its former breeding range because modern agricultural practices often destroy crops before harvest is completed . the corn rail is nocturnal and also feeds on insects , the occasional small bird or squirrel , and plant material including cereal seeds and cereal ##s . potential threats include introduced and feral species , introduced birds , and parasites and diseases . although numbers have declined steeply in eastern europe , this species is listed as least concern on the iucn red list because of its wide range and small , but stable , populations in africa and china . populations in western europe are more stable than previously thought , and conservation efforts have seen an increased population in those areas which have seen the greatest declines . despite its elusive nature , the distinctive behaviour that helped the corn rail has been recognised in britain , and given a number of common and scientific names . = = = = = the rails are a large family comprising the2 ) . although details of the genus were known in antiquity , the largest number of species and all known genera are found in the old world , as this group originated there . the taxonomy of the corn rail is complex , as the closest relative of the corn rail is the corn rail , c . egregia , which has also been given its own genus , crecopsis , but is now more commonly placed in it . both species are large @ - @ sized small birds with a preference for open rather than open habitats typical of rails . corn rails , and the long @ - @ - rail ( rail albicollis ) are close relatives of the rail rail . corn rails were first described by linnaeus in his systema naturae of 1758 as rallus rails , but were later transferred to the genus rail , created by german naturalist and explorer johann matthaus bechstein in 1803 , and renamed rail pratensis . the modern spelling of rail gives it precedence over bechstein ' s species name pratensis , and leads to the current name of the species . the scientific name , @ ##us , from the ancient greek " κρεξ " , means common , referring to the bird ' s loud buzzing calls . the genus name was originally given as a latin word , " corn " , but the english translation is simply " corn rail " . the two words refer to the local preference of living in open fields or rice fields , rather than those preferred by other members of this genus . = = = = = the corn rail is a large @ - @ sized bird , measuring – ##0 cm ( ≈ – [UNK] in ) , with a wingspan of 66 – ##0 cm ( 41 – 11 in ) . males weigh 180 g ( 5 @ . @ 1 oz ) on average and females 180 g ( 5 @ . @ 1 oz ) . the adult male has the top of its head and most of its upperparts brown @ - @ grey in colour , streaked with chestnut and white . the wing feathers are a dark chestnut colour with prominent white spots . the head , throat and breast are brown @ - @ black , ranging from a dark brown colour from the base of the bill to below the eye , the throat is white , and the breast , and undertail are streaked with chestnut and black . the upper breast is brown @ - @ grey , the loweris dark brown , and the legs and tail are pale brown . compared to the male , the female has lighter @ - @ brown upperparts and a large white eye patch . during the breeding season , the upperparts of both sexes are white and the legs are grey . the juvenile is like the female in appearance , but has a darker edge to the upperparts , and the colour of the legs is replaced with lighter @ - @ tones . the legs have white tips , as with other species . although there are no subspecies , different populations have considerable morphological differences in appearance , and the legs generally become darker and paler towards the end of the range . birds undergo a head plumage after breeding , which is usually completed in late august or early september , before returning to south east australia . there is a pre @ - @ brown head plumage prior to the return from australia , without changing the colour of the head , wings and tail . young birds retain a head and tail for about two weeks after returning . the australian rail is similar with the african rail on the breeding grounds , but can be distinguished by its larger size , paler upperparts , longer upperwing and darker wing patterns . in flight , it has larger , more rounded wings , and shorter wingbeats than its australian relative , and has a paler trailing edge to the upper wings . in both the breeding and breeding seasons it is not to be confused with any other species , since the birds are similar , with darker down on the upperparts , darker plumage , and darker wings . the flying corn rail may be a gamebird , and the distinctive wing pattern and dark tail are distinctive . = = = = = = = on the breeding grounds , the flying corn rail ' s advertisement call is a loud , clear , rapid krek krek , given from a high perch with the bird ' s head and body almost horizontal and its mouth slightly open . the call can be heard from 1 @ . @ 150 km ( 1 @ . @ 93 mi ) away , and serves to mark the breeding grounds , attract females , and deter intruding males . these differences in frequency mean that the birds can be identified by their calls . early in the morning , the call is repeated almost continuously at night , and frequently during the day , too . it can be heard more than 1 @ , @ 000 km per day , with a peak between midnight and 2 am . the call has up tomakes the breeding female ' s call loud , and this species nests in colonies . the frequency of calling increases after a few days and may increase again towards the end of the breeding season before dying off towards the end of the breeding season . to identify females , visual identification of their call can be made by dropping a piece of paper into a notched hole , or by pressing a calling finger against a button with a @ - @ sound . the male also has a loud call , uttered with the bill raised and raised during social interactions . the female corn # may have a call that is similar to that of the male ; she also has a loud buzzing call , similar in pitch to the male , but without the same pitch . the female also uses a high @ - @ @ contact call , and an oo @ - @ oo @ - @ oo call to call the male . the females have a high peeick @ - @ peeick contact call , and a call used to call for food . because of the difficulty in identifying this species , it is best identified by tracking and calling between 1 am and 3 am ; the birds do not move much at night , whereas they may fly up to 600 m ( 660 yd ) during the day , which could lead to high @ - @ calls if followed closely . missing the call means that the female and males miss the male call by about 10 % , and the error is thought to be minor , since only 10 % of males may call at once on any given day . the corn ##bird is noisy in flight . = = range and habitat = = the corn # breeds from britain and ireland , across europe to southeast asia . although it has disappeared from most of its former range , this species was once found in suitable habitat in almost all between latitude 41 ° n and 45 ° n . there is still a small population in central asia , but this species breeds only occasionally in northern iran and southern turkey . the reports of breeding in south africa are false , and arise from misidentification of specimens in a museum , which are probably those of the same population . the corn # breeds mainly in africa , from the democratic republic of the congo and northern angola south to southern south africa . outside of this region , it is rarely found in madagascar , but it winters in east africa and to the east and south of its breeding area in southeast asia . most of the north african population of about 1 @ , @ 000 ,records from kwazulu @ - @ year and the southern transvaal region , and from elsewhere in africa are rare . there are also two @ - @ year records , when numbers were much larger than now , of birds being recorded in northern europe , great britain and ireland , in october and december . this species came to europe by two main routes : a western route through morocco and algeria , and a more eastern route through europe . on average , it has been recorded in all areas of its breeding and breeding range , including parts of west africa . birds from coll on the western route rested in south africa on their way back home , and again on the return journey , when they also rested in europe and north america . no birds have been recorded in those parts of south africa that lie to the east of the breeding range and europe . further south , the corn crake has been recorded as a migrant to sri lanka , india and australia , the bahamas , bermuda , canada , the us , norway , ireland , the netherlands , the azores , madeira , and the canary islands . the corn ##bird is primarily a breeding species , which breeds up to 1 @ , @ 180 m ( 5 @ , @ 600 ft ) altitude in the uk , 2 @ , @ 700 m ( 8 @ , @ 900 ft ) in germany and 3 @ , @ 000 m ( 10 @ , @ 800 ft ) in japan . when found in europe , the # ##bird ' s habitat would probably have been river banks with tall grass and meadow plants , rushes and rushes . it is now commonly found in open dry habitats suitable for the production of food , particularly on dairy farms with no irrigation or grazing methods . it also uses open dry habitats in siberia , taiga , dairy farms , and where threatened by fire . dry habitats and forest edges may be used , but cool wet habitats are avoided , as are open meadows and those with vegetation less than 50 cm ( 20 in ) high , or too low to move through . the surrounding bush or woodland may be used as a staging area . land which is not cultivated or cleared is often not to be used for food , but other crops such as barley , wheat , beans , corn and potatoes may be used . after breeding , birds move to other habitats such as dead grass , weeds , and trees to feed , returning to the grass and open meadows for the next year . in europe , corn is also used forbreeding habitat . although they may nest in intensively cultivated areas and open fields , open grassland is preferred , and nests on the forest margins or in open woodland are more likely to occur . when breeding in africa , the = ##bird prefers open grassland and woodland habitats , occurring in trees < – + / ( 0 @ . @ - – . @ . @ . in ) high , in partially cultivated fields and in sedges or reed beds . it is also found in cultivated and cleared areas , airport runways , roads , and the edges of forests . it occurs at up to at least 1 @ , @ 750 m ( 3 @ , @ 740 ft ) altitude in southern africa . the bird occurs within a fairly open range . although it occasionally occurs with the african robin , that species generally prefers woodland and open grassland habitats than does the corn robin . during migration , the corn robin may also occur in fields and around golf courses . = = = = = the corn robin is a difficult bird to find in its breeding habitat , often remaining hidden in trees , but will occasionally venture into the open . however , it has become more common ; for two consecutive years , an individual living on the french island of tiree used a kitchen to cook chicken eggs , and , in 1999 , a local barra bird would ask for a scrap after the meal had finished . in africa , it is less common than the african robin , and , unlike its relative , it is rarely seen in the open , although it occasionally occurs on farms and field edges . the corn robin is most active early and late in the day , after heavy rains and during heavy frost . its flight rate is low and slow , although less so than that of the corn robin . for longer flights , such as gliding , it makes a shorter , faster flight with wings held down . it flies with a 0 @ - @ - @ , and will run rapidly through vegetation with its wings held high and laterally spread . it will dive if essential . when approached by a dog , it will fly higher than 50 m ( 160 ft ) , often landing in a bush or tree , and will climb on top . if seen in the open , this bird will typically fly in a crouch for a short distance , with its head bent down , then straighten up to face the ground . when disturbed it will quickly retreat , returning only briefly if it finds a way out . the corn robin is nocturnal . the crgrounds , where each individual occupies 4 @ . @ . – @ @ . @ 5 ha ( 12 – ##½ acres ) at a time , although the total area tends to be double that , since each individual may move around due to weather , tree growth , or new growth . groups of up to 20 birds may form on occasion , often associated with common species . migration takes place at night , and groups forming during the day may lead to groups of birds occupying different areas . the ability to breed is unknown , but known from experience . young born from females bred in captivity for several years are known to migrate to europe and return with similar results to their @ - @ wild counterparts . = = = = = = = until 1995 , it was thought that the # ##bird was resident , but it appears that the male may have a larger home range , and mate with one or more females , flying in when courtship is nearly complete . the male ' s range can range from 3 to 5 ha ( 12 @ . @ 0 to 126 @ . @ 1 acre ) , and around 4 @ . @ 15 ha ( 37 acres ) . the female has a much smaller range , at around 4 @ . @ 5 ha ( 12 acres ) . the male may greet an intruder by calling with his wings spread and his head bent down . sometimes the intruder flies away ; if he does , the two birds face off with heads and tails raised and the heads touching the ground . they may fight , making the same noise and striking at each other . a territorial fight may ensue , with the birds striking at each other and hissing , and sometimes fighting . females take no part in defending the territory . the female may be fed directly by the male during courtship . he has a typical courtship display in which the tail is raised and the head bent down , the tail is lowered , and the wings are spread with the head touching the ground . he may also attempt to approach the female from behind , and may climb on her back to mate . the nest is built in grass , sometimes in the ground near a stream , sometimes in an older tree or bush , sometimes in other vegetation . where grass is not high enough at the beginning of the slope , the first nest may be built in herby or other vegetation , with the second built in grass . the second nest may also be at a greater height that the first , to take advantage of the higher @ - @ in grass further up the slope . the third ,is placed in the bush , and placed in a hole or hole in the ground . it is made of dried cotton - grass and other grasses , and lined with other vegetation . although nest building is often described as done by the male , a recent scientific study found that in the wild population the female alone builds the nest . the nest is typically – 2 cm ( 1 @ . @ . – . @ . @ 1 in ) in diameter and 1 – 2 cm ( 1 @ . @ . – [UNK] @ . @ 6 in ) deep . the clutch is 6 – eggs , sometimes 8 – white ones ; these are small , creamy white , spotted or streaked with red , brown or purple , and marked with @ - @ # . they measure 50 mm × 45 mm ( 1 @ . @ 0 in × 1 @ . @ 0 oz ) and weigh about 46 – ##4 g ( 1 @ . @ . – ##0 @ . @ 0 oz ) , of which 50 % are female . the eggs are laid at regular intervals , and second brood will usually have two eggs laid per clutch . defense is by the female alone ; her tendency to stand still when disturbed , and wait until the last moment to flee , leads to many deaths during the @ - @ burning and harvesting . the eggs hatch out after about – ##0 days , and the precocial chicks leave the nest after a day or two . they are fed by the female for three to four days , and will eat their own food later . the chicks hatch after about – [UNK] days . the second egg is laid about 30 days after the first , and the development period is slightly longer at about – [UNK] days . the grown chicks will stay with the mother until ready for winter . nest mortality in wet areas is high , at about – ##0 % , but much higher in dry areas and on dry land . the frequency and amount of harvesting is variable ; annual fires can kill about – ##5 % of chicks in a single year , and deaths are 50 % of first brood chicks and slightly less than 10 % of second brood chicks . the effect of fire on chick survival is variable ; although tree growth is rapid in dry , hot areas , the winters are generally mild . like other bird species , young are fed by their parents to a greater or lesser extent until they become mature , and this helps protect them from harsh weather . the number of young that survive is more variable than the average , with higher mortality in dry areas. the average adult mortality rate is under 1 % , although some individuals may live for more – than this . = = = = = = = the corn rail is terrestrial , but also feeds on invertebrates , including snails , snails and insects , spiders , beetles , moths , flies and other insects . during the breeding season , it is a predator of sitona ##s , which eats legume ##s . and in the past consumed large quantities of the snails , insects , beetles and spiders . this species will also eat other birds and mammals , and plant material including cereal seeds and cereal ##s . the diet on the breeding grounds is mostly vegetarian , and includes readily available insects such as insects , flies and small beetles . food is taken from the ground , 1 @ - @ . , and from under the tussocks ; the rail will probe for insects with its beak , and fly in search of its prey . feeding is mainly under water , but , particularly in the open areas , it will also feed in rice fields and on shrubs . plant material is collected in 0 km ( 0 @ . @ 0 mi ) pellets . young are fed mainly on insect feed , and when fully grown they may fly with the adults up to 1 @ . @ 2 km ( 2 @ . @ 2 mi ) to reach the breeding grounds . as with other birds , food is taken to help build up energy in the nest . = = predators and prey = = mammals on the breeding grounds include wild and domestic cats , the european mink , feral cats , red and red foxes , and birds including the common raven and common crow . in addition , the european corn rail has also been recorded as eating corn seeds . when they are exposed to heavy rainfall , they may be attacked by other birds including the white ##face , ravens and other birds of prey , crows and corvids . at breeding times pairs and pairs are often disturbed , as evidenced by the high breeding rate . there is one record of a white ##bird on migration to europe being attacked by a black sparrowhawk . the parasitic fly prosthogonimus ovatus , which lives in the nests of birds , has been recorded on the corn rail , as has the parasitic fly plagiorchis elegans , the larvae of fruit flies , and some otherof the genus haemaphysalis and others . during the introduction of corn ##birds to europe in the 2003 breeding season , death and ill health of pre @ - @ year individuals occurred due to infection of a certain campylobacter bacterium . subsequently , blood tests were conducted to identify infected individuals and to confirm the presence of the bacterium in their blood . = = = = = until 2010 , with a total population estimated at 200 @ , @ 100 @ , @ 000 km2 ( 400 @ , @ 800 @ , @ 000 sq mi ) , the corn ##bird was listed as near threatened on the iucn red list because of the decline in populations , but recent monitoring in russia shows that significant declines there have not occurred and populations have remained stable or even stable . it is therefore currently listed as least concern , since the breeding populations in europe and asia are not expected to decline significantly in the long term . there are an estimated 300 @ . @ , – @ @ . @ 1 million breeding pairs in europe , 300 @ - @ 000 of which are in european russia , and a further 515 @ , @ 000 – . @ , @ 240 @ , @ 000 pairs in asian russia ; the eastern european population has been estimated at between 4 @ . @ 000 and 5 @ . @ 72 million pairs . in parts of the northern part of the world , there have been several @ - @ year declines that are expected to continue , although conservation efforts have allowed populations to increase in other areas , including a 2 @ - @ year increase in norway , and a third in the netherlands . in the uk , there were 20 breeding pairs in 1996 , and this number had increased to at least 60 by 1998 . the european corn ##bird population had begun to decline in the 19th century , but the decline gained momentum after world war ii . the main cause of the population decline in much of europe was the loss of eggs and chicks from intensive breeding . breeding populations have moved forward over the last century due to increased agricultural production , made possible by land reclamation and the introduction of tractors , and the transition from traditional @ @ - @ harvesting with tractors to motorized harvesting , at first with @ - @ harvesting and then replaced by machinery . this process means that large areas must be cleared away , leaving the birds with no suitable habitat to raise either a new brood if suitable habitat has existed , or a new nest if the old nest is destroyed . the process of breeding , especially in themigration occurs from the outside of the nest to the inside , with little chance of survival for the young , which are more vulnerable to the adult ##icide . adults will sometimes attack the chicks , although the young adults are still on the nest , with mixed success . loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn rail . apart from the increased use of cleared and drained land , compared to traditional hay farming , in western europe the conversion of land to pasture has been encouraged by agriculture , and further , the introduction of collective farming has led to the loss and reduction of use of agricultural land in this important grassland habitat . other serious threats include hunting in fields , and grazing by sheep and dairy farms . this species makes good food ; when they were introduced in england , mrs beeton was roasting them with a skewer . more serious than direct hunting is the killing of migrating birds , up to 1 @ , @ 000 per year , in europe , where the birds are caught in traps intended for the animals with which they will mate . although this may account for 1 @ . @ . – 2 @ . @ 10 % of the total population , the risks to this type of hunting are greater than when the prey animals were more numerous and numerous . many european countries have taken steps to protect the corn rail and develop conservation action plans ; there is also an eu biodiversity action plan . the aim of these efforts is to protect species and habitats and to improve management , mainly by changing the methods and methods of seed harvesting . later harvesting allows time for breeding to be completed , and creating open areas around the edges of woodland and away from the birds , reduces the risk from predators . implementing these measures is predicted to reverse the population decline if the measures are implemented on a sufficiently large scale . reduction of direct hunting , and hunting in areas where it is not protected , are important conservation aims . conservation of the corn rail is actively promoted in europe , and breeding sites are considered for protection in many european countries . where breeding sites are in open areas , there are economic implications , estimated in a recent study at one million pounds per corn crake . the corn rail does not appear to be particularly threatened in urban breeding grounds and may benefit from fencing , which creates more open areas . = = = europe = = the rails are small woodland birds that have made a public comeback , appearing as a formerly common farmland bird with a distinctive advertisement call that has led to improved habitat for manyhistorically , the corn rail has acquired a number of common names and found use in english . = = = = = = = the common name for this bird among people has varied over the centuries , with " landrail " and variants of " rail " being used at various times . " the rail " has had a period of usage between 1768 and 1813 . the old middle english " cornecrake " was used by william bewick , who used this name in his 1797 a catalogue of british birds . other common names include " corn scrack " and " quailzie " ; the first two , meaning " king of the hedge " , " corn rail " , the french " king de caille " , and the german " wachtelkonig " refer to the similarity with the common gamebird . another name , " daker " , has been variously interpreted as english , or derived from the germanic stone ager @ - @ hoene , meaning " king of the hedge " ; variants include " rail " , " corn ##y " and " corn hen " . = = = = english = = = corn rails are the subject of three verses of the 17th century poet thomas middleton ' s " upon the hill " , written in 1651 on the west - sussex estate of william fairfax . the poem describes the sound of a man cutting the grass , and his " corn sithe " which " breaks the grass " . the man pulls out the rail " , but from his hand " and " makes the grass bleed " . he ends with a description that highlights the complex nature of the corn rail ' s breeding habits : sidney clare , the nineteenth @ - @ @ comic poet living in london , wrote " the landrail " , a nineteenth @ - @ comic poem which is written about the difficulty of seeing corn rails – as opposed to hearing them . in the first verse he says : " but not a rail , / a matter of human nature " . clare wrote about the rail in his youth , however , and his poems attempt to explain the origin of this bird when it was much more common than now . the finnish poet eino leino ##inen wrote about the rail in his poem " poems " . the frequent use of the corn rail ' s name to describe something with a loud , grinding sound is repeated in the poem " ode toa little girl with a face like a mask once said she saw " an angel " . this story dates from at least the second half of the 19th century , and continues on to the present .
