= = zrinyi = = zrinyi ( " his majesty ' s battleship zrinyi " ) was a radetzky @ - @ hungarian pre @ - @ german battleship ( schlachtschiff ) of the austro @ - @ hungarian navy ( k . u . k . kriegsmarine ) , named for the zrinski , a prominent hungarian family . zrinyi and her sisters , erzherzog franz ferdinand and radetzky , were the last pre @ - @ ships built for the austro @ - @ hungarian navy . during world war i , zrinyi saw action in the adriatic sea . she served with the 1st division of the austro @ - @ hungarian navy ' s fleet and off senigallia as part of the blockade of the italian port of ancona , italy , during april 1915 . however , allied control of the strait of otranto meant that the austro @ - @ hungarian navy was , for all purposes and purposes , effectively bottled up in the adriatic . thus , the presence of the zrinyi and other ships slowed down the large number of allied ships . with the war raging against the allies at the end of 1918 , zrinyi was ordered to be ceded to the independent state of serbs , croats and serbs . on 11 november 1918 — just one day before the end of the war , allied ships towed the ship out of pola ( trieste ) and she transferred to a squadron of italian naval forces . after the transfer to the united states navy , she was officially renamed uss zrinyi . under the terms of inter @ - @ germain @ - @ inter @ - @ laye , the ship was not completed ; instead , zrinyi was ceded to italy and broken up for scrap . = = design and construction = = zrinyi was built at the stabilimento tecnico triestino shipyard in trieste , the same shipyard where her sister ships were built in . she was laid down on 16 october 1908 and launched from the yard on 1 may 1910 . the upper deck of zrinyi ' s hull was the only thing austro @ - @ hungarians had to pay for to build the ship . the ship was launched on 15 october 1911 , and on 15 november 1911 she was commissioned into the navy . she was the third ship of the class to be built and had a crew of 880 to 890 officers and men . zrinyi was 138 @ . @ 14 meters ( 45##5 ft 3 in ) overall , and had a beam of 9 @ . @ 6 m ( 20 ft 4 in ) and a draft of 12 @ . @ 8 m ( 26 ft 6 in ) . she displaced 14 @ , @ 508 long tons ( 14 @ , @ 741 t ) normally , and up to 15 @ , @ 845 long tons ( 15 @ , @ 099 t ) with a full -

@ hungarian navy ' s 1st battle squadron upon her 1911 commissioning . in 1912 , zrinyi and her two sister ships conducted two training cruises into the eastern black sea . on the first cruise into the black sea , conducted from october to november , zrinyi and her sister ships were escorted by the destroyer rear admiral spaun and a flotilla of destroyers . after returning to pola , the hungarian fleet prepared for further action , as tensions rose in the mediterranean . in 1913 , zrinyi participated in an international naval exercise in the baltic sea toduring the balkan wars . ships from other nations serving in the flotilla included the british pre @ - @ ss hms king edward vii , the italian pre @ - @ ss ammiraglio di saint bon , the french armored cruiser jean quinet , and the german armored cruiser sms kaiser . the most important mission of the british fleet , which was under the command of vice admiral cecil burney , was to patrol the montenegrin coast . the objective of the operation was to prevent serbian forces from breaking the siege of scutari , where they had faced a combined force of italians and serbs . alarmed by the deteriorating situation , serbia withdrew its forces from scutari , which was now defended by a small british naval force . during that time , the first of the new ships , sms viribus unitis , that made up the tegetthoff class — the first ships built for the austro @ - @ hungarian navy — went into active service . with the completion of these ships , zrinyi and her sisters were transferred from the 1st division to the 2nd division of the 1st cruiser squadron . = = = world war i = = = at that time of the assassination of emperor franz ferdinand of austria on 10 july 1914 , the fleet of the austro @ - @ hungarian navy consisted of the radetzky class , the tegetthoff class ( which only had one ship , sms szent istvan , under construction ) , the erzherzog karl class and finally , the austrian kaiser class . along with the rest of the austro @ - @ hungarian fleet , zrinyi was detached in late july 1914 to support the operations of sms goeben and sms kaiser . the three german ships sailed out of montenegro , which was held by the italians , and to trieste . the italians had advanced as far south as bari in southern italy when news of the allied invasion reached them . the austro @ - @ hungarian ships were quickly withdrawn from the adriatic . on 1 august 1915 , between two and three weeks after news of the italian declaration of war reached the main austro @ - @ hungarian naval base at pola , zrinyi and the rest of the flotilla began to patrol the adriatic and montenegrin coasts . their base was initially the italian naval base at ancona , and later the island of lissa . the invasion of lissa was part of the wider austro @ - @ hungarian offensive against the kingdom of italy and serbia , which were allies of the austro, during the first half of 1915 . the attack on ancona was an immediate success , and the italians were killed during the bombardment . the bombardment of the town and the surrounding area resulted in the destruction of an italian ship in the port of ancona itself , and another italian ship , pisa , was severely damaged further inland . on the contrary , the rest of the port of ancona , as well as the surrounding areas , were heavily damaged . the railway station of ancona , as well as the port facilities of the town , were damaged or destroyed . the italian artillery batteries were also destroyed . during the bombardment , zrinyi also managed to destroy a bridge , the railway station , and a bridge at senigallia . other buildings that were damaged or destroyed included factories , warehouses , water tanks , gas works , and the naval hospital . many @ - @ @ people , both civilians and military personnel , were killed during the attack . by the time the ships from taranto and bari arrived on the scene , the austro @ - @ ships were already anchored at pola . the purpose of the bombardment of ancona was to prevent the italian army from concentrating its forces on the border with austria @ - @ hungary by destroying its telegraph network . the italian attack on ancona succeeded in delaying the italian advance to the front for several weeks . this delay gave austria @ - @ hungary enough time to withdraw its main forces and evacuate @ - @ @ most of its forces from the italian and german fronts . apart from the attack on ancona , the austro @ - @ hungarian forces were also confined to pola for the rest of the war . their operations were directed by admiral anton haus , the commander of the austro @ - @ hungarian fleet , who feared that he would have to use his fleet to counter an italian attempt to enter the adriatic sea . since attention was diverted to the german tegetthoff @ - @ hungarian fleet , the remainder of the war saw zrinyi and the rest of the austro @ - @ hungarian fleet operating as a fleet in reserve . this resulted in the successful construction of the otranto barrage . with his fleet isolated in the adriatic sea , and with a shortage of ships , haus devised a plan based on mines and torpedoes designed to counter the numerical superiority of the allied fleet . = = = = @ - @ = = = = = after the austro @ - @ hungarian empire collapsed in 1918 , the italians decided to hand the adriatic over to the newly formed republic of slovene##s , croats and serbs ( later to become a part of the kingdom of yugoslavia ) in order to prevent the italians from taking the ships as prizes of war . however , the western allies refused to accept the armistice between the italians and the south tyrol and , in due course , cancelled the order . the ship had been commissioned with a mostly austrian crew on 11 november 1918 , the day of the armistice , and had left pola with her sister ship , radetzky . they were soon spotted by an allied aircraft , and the two ships flew their flag and headed south along the adriatic coast to castelli , near spalato ( now known as split ) . they waited for allied naval forces to intercept them and demand their surrender , which a squadron of united states navy ( navy ) submarine boats in the adriatic did . she had not been turned over to the neutral south adriatic squadron , so it was a croatian naval officer , korvettenkapitan marijan polic , who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the united states navy on the morning of 11 february 1919 at spalato ( split ) , croatia . there she was commissioned as uss zrinyi and lieutenant j . h . hazlett , commanding , took command . the original total crew consisted of 8 officers and 174 enlisted men — the remainder was composed of united states naval reserve enlisted personnel . the ship remained at anchor at spalato for nearly a year while the trials that would determine her ultimate fate went on . only once did she actually turn her lights on , and that was during a severe storm that struck spalato on 28 february 1920 . on the morning of 1 march 1920 , zrinyi was abandoned . uss missouri took her in tow and , assisted by anderson and hovey , returned the ship to service . under the terms of the treaty of paris and st . germain , zrinyi was officially turned over to the italian government in 1921 . she was broken up for scrap later that year and into 1921 .
