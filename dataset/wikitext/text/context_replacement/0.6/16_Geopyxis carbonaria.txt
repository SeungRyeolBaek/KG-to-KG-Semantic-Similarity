= geopyxis carbonaria = geopyxis carbonaria is a species of fungus in the genus geopyxis , family pyronemataceae . first described to science in 1805 , and given its current name in 1889 , the species is commonly known as the charcoal loving elf @ - @ cup , stalked bonfire cup , dwarf charcoal cup , or charcoal cup . the small , reddish @ - @ cup fruitbodies of the fungus are a @ - @ cup with a white streak and measure up to 20 cm ( 1 @ . @ . in ) across . they have a short , white streak . fruitbodies are often found on ground where woodland has not been cleared , often in large numbers . the species is widespread in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere . it is found in europe , asia , and north america . although it is primarily a saprotrophic species , growing on the organic plant matter left after a fire , it also has biotrophic associations with the roots of norway spruce . = = = = = the fungus was first described formally in 1805 by johannes baptista von albertini and baron david von schweinitz as genus carbonaria . mordecai cubitt first described the fruitbodies , spores , and spores in his 1879 book mycographia , seu icones fungorum . descriptions of interest from many parts of the world . in 1889 , giovanni andrea saccardo transferred the species to the genus geopyxis , giving the species its current name . pustularia carbonaria , described by heinrich rehm in 1884 , is a synonym of g . carbonaria . = @ - @ - grelet described the variety geopyxis carbonaria var . sessilis in 1937 , referring to it of fruitbodies without a cap , but the name is now considered to have any taxonomic status . in 1860 benjamin franklin and william ashley johnson described the fungus as lepida from collections made in california as part of the north american exploring and surveying expedition ( 1853 – 1856 ) . this species was synonymized with g . carbonaria by antonio rifai in 1968 , a later revision published by donald pfister ##er a year later . the specific epithet carbonaria comes from the latin word for " wood " . common names given to the species include " charcoal loving elf @ - @ cup " , " dwarf charcoal cup " , " bonfire cup " , and theamerican mycological society . " the cup fungus " . = = = = = the fruitbodies ( cups ) of geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped , roughly – ##½ cm long , and have thin ##ened flesh . the interior orange @ - @ brown part of the mushroom , the cap , is dark brown and whitish , while the outer surface is a pale brown , and may be either smooth or have orange @ - @ brown structures ( [UNK] ) . the cup is cylindrical ( [UNK] – @ @ . @ 1 cm long and 1 – . cm wide ) , white in color , and falls down into the cap . the white flesh of the cup is brittle and brittle . it does not have a distinctive odor , and has an unpleasant taste when immersed in air . the odor of the flesh is not known , but the fruitbodies are edible and need to be processed for food . = = = microscopic = = = = in vitro , the spores are edible . the spores are small , smooth , cylindrical , devoid of oil droplets ( eguttulate ) , and have dimensions of 14 – ##0 by 8 – ##0 µm . they are spherical , and smooth and develop rapidly in vitro in the absence of external moisture . the spores measure 13 – 225 by 10 – ##0 µm . the spores are roughly orange @ - @ shaped , cylindrical , and have numerous orange @ - @ brown caps , with dimensions up to 2 µm long , and are sometimes branched or branched . the hypothecium , the layer of tissue covering the cap , is composed of closely packed , somewhat white scales . = = = type species = = = the closely packed stalked ##ite mushroom ( geopyxis vulcanalis ) is a pale orange to brown fruitbody that is initially cup shaped and expanding in size , and the brownish flesh often has an odor of ammonia . it can be distinguished only by its spores , which lack the orange @ - @ brown spores characteristic of g . carbonaria . it also has larger spores , measuring about – cm by 8 – ##8 µm . unlike g . carbonaria , it grows on substrates other than dead wood , peat wood , and wood chips . tarzetta cupularis , which is very similar to g . carbonaria , is distinguished only by its spores that contain no oil droplets . similar species with type characteristics withwhich g . carbonaria may be found in the wild include aleuria , caloscypha , melastiza , and sowerbyella . = = distribution and ecology = = geopyxis carbonaria is found on burnt wood and wood in the fall and during the fire season . it is one of the most common fungal species found on burnt wood . the leaf litter on the forest floor affects the overall soil ph as well as the concentration of nutrients . fruitbodies are produced from 12 to 139 days after a forest fire in association with fallen trees . most fruitbodies are produced within the 12 weeks after the fire . the fungus begins growing in microhabitats with the postfire cover and the same tree roots . geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post @ - @ fire stands as oaks , although the latter are much more susceptible . because the fungus often appears larger than expected , it may serve as an indicator of the fungal disease . other edible fungi commonly found growing in the same stands as g . carbonaria include those from the genera aleuria , anthracobia , acacia , and tarzetta . the fungus is common in europe ( from where it was first described ) , and is found in north america . the north american distribution extends north to california . in 2010 , it was reported for the first time from canada . = = = = = although not a saprotrophic fungus involved in the post @ - @ fire growth of deciduous and evergreen trees , geopyxis carbonaria has been shown to be capable of forming ectomycorrhizae with white spruce ( section montana ) . it had been shown previously in laboratory experiments that the fungus had a biotrophic relationship with white pine ( section contorta ) . the spores of g . carbonaria were able to penetrate the roots of the spruce itself , but did not affect the endodermis . these results indicate that the fungus is a plant pathogen , with the ability to cause problems with seed production . furthermore , the fungus produces the enzyme polyphenol a , and can break down the essential protein compounds , — , characteristic of saprotrophic fungi . the presence of a protective hartig shell , also characteristic of mycorrhizal fungi , suggests that g . carbonaria may be capable of forming mutualistic relationships under the right conditions . vralstad and colleaguesnote that the - @ - @ - association with tree trees protects it from further damage in the event of a fire , and the increased fruitbody growth after a fire may be " a successful evolutionary escape from a susceptible environment where the fungus no longer can maintain its biotrophic capacity " . the populations of the fungus are often associated with damage to the host tree , such as that which occurs with fire . a 2002 study conducted in 1988 found that fruit bodies were more likely to be produced in areas that were heavily burned , compared to areas with light to moderate vegetation where the fungus were standing , and in clearcut areas . growth was much denser in spruce forests — with up to 700 – ##0 fruitbodies per square meter — than in pine forests , where fruitbodies were abundant . fruitbodies grew in the hundreds in the years following the great fire of 1988 .
