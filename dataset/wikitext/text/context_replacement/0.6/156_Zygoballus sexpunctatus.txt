= zygoballus sexpunctatus = zygoballus sexpunctatus is a species of jumping spider which occurs in the eastern united states where it can be found in a variety of different habitats . these spiders measure between 3 and 6 @ . @ 2 inches in length . the cephalothorax and legs are brown to black in colour , with dark brown to brown markings . the male has greatly front thighs ( the legs used for catching prey ) and long abdomen ( the first , and the longest , abdominal bones ) . like other jumping spiders , z . sexpunctatus may exhibit both aggressive and mating behavior . = = = = = the species name is derived from the latin sex meaning " sex " and spot meaning " spot " . this is a reference to the six spots usually found on the abdomen of the spider . = = description and description = = the species was first described by charles william marcellus hentz in 1845 in the american museum of natural history . hentz named the species attus sexpunctatus and described it as follows : " male ; cephalothorax with the two compound teeth at the apex , which are large and slightly placed at almost a right angle with the dorsal surface , cheliceres with a large outer ring , and a broad , white margin ; abdomen with white segments , and a spot in front , straight ; legs , 3 . 2 . 2 . 3 . , each pair with broad claws and very long . " hentz placed z . sexpunctatus in the subgeneric subfamily pugnatoriae , which consists of those spiders whose first pair of legs were the longest , followed by the second pair . later authors rejected this classification , which hentz himself said was " entirely arbitrary " . in 1888 , with the recognition of zygoballus as an independent genus , american arachnologists william and william peckham named the species zygoballus sexpunctatus . specimens of z . sexpunctatus are held in the museum of comparative zoology , the british museum , the boston art museum , the american museum of natural history , and the museum national d ' histoire naturelle . no other specimens are known . the genus zygoballus contains about 20 species ranging from the united states to brazil . zygoballus is placed in the subfamily dendryphantinae of the family salticidae ( jumping spiders ) . == = = = according to arachnologist r . j . kaston , adult females are 3 @ . @ . to 4 @ . @ 5 mm in body length , while males are 3 to 4 @ . @ 5 mm . the peckhams ' original description , however , gives a length of 4 mm for females and 3 to 4 @ . @ 5 mm for males . the cephalothorax of z . sexpunctatus is bronze to black in colour . like all zygoballus species , the cephalothorax is - @ - @ round in shape , slightly narrowed at the anterior median eyes . large white to pale brown hairs cover the head ( " head " ) and abdomen . this area extends along the base of the head , extending at the anterior lateral eye . in females , the face is 3 @ - @ . as long as the body , and as wide as it is tall . the antennae of females are slightly reduced and differently placed , with the segment having a large apical lobe and a long , slender end . the legs are dark brown , or pale black , with the segments of the anterior ( first ) pair being longer and narrower , as in the female . the hind legs have two pairs of short spines on the upper surface of the abdomen and two pairs of spines on the abdomen . the peckhams give the following figures for the length of the legs of the male spider , starting with the first pair : 2 @ . @ 5 mm , 3 @ . @ 7 mm , 2 mm , 1 mm . in females , the anterior pair of spines is the longest . the pedipalp of the male has a short white spine which projects forward . the abdomen is brown to black with a white longitudinal area and two white transverse bands . the transverse bands are sometimes joined to form white spots . some or all of these spots may be absent , however . zygoballus sexpunctatus is similar in appearance to zygoballus rufipes , with whom its range overlap . the male can be distinguished from z . rufipes by the large patch of white scales at the base of the dorsal segment ( which is absent in z . rufipes ) , and by the transverse bands present in the underside of the pedipalp ( z . rufipes has no transverse division ) . the female is be be distinguished= the position of the epigyne ( the male image ##ia ) . = = distribution and distribution = = the range of the species is from new york to florida and mississippi to texas , although it is most commonly found in the united states . hentz collected his original specimens in north carolina . in 1909 , the peckhams reported that the species had been collected from north carolina , florida , georgia , louisiana , and alabama . a one @ - @ year survey of spider populations in southern florida reported the abundance of z . sexpunctatus as " high " . a two @ - @ year survey in alachua county , florida , reported the species as " common " . specimens have been collected from various locations , including cotton fields , coastal pine fields , flatwoods , coastal slash dune forests , white pine forests , tall pine fields , and rice fields . william and betty barnes reported the species as common in broomsedge and throughout the carolina ##s . the species is usually found in the lower layer ( among grasses and other small grasses ) and can be caught with a fishing ##er . = = female = = male zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders are known to perform elaborate courtship behaviors . when a male approaches a female , it will typically raise and spread its first pair of legs and shake its abdomen . if the female is approached , it will typically shake its abdomen as well . the # ##s of courtship behavior , however , vary between species . z . sexpunctatus spiders display an aggressive behavior when approaching other males of the same species . this behavior may involve some of the same forms of courtship , such as raising and spreading the first pair of legs and shaking the abdomen . during courtship behavior , males may also shake their pedipalps and abdomen . sexual interactions between males appear to be rare , however . = = ecology and habitat = = like other spiders , zygoballus sexpunctatus is an active spider , feeding on a wide variety of insect species . the spider ' s diet also includes small insects such as beetles and insect spiders . they have also been known to eat flies and other species of small insects . the parasitic flies , which attack and eat spiders as a source of food for their larvae , have been known to feed on both male and female z . sexpunctatus spiders . = = life history = = = a study of spider populationsin western australia , zygoballus sexpunctatus spiderlings were known to hatch from egg clutches in the december . the spiders lived through the winter in an adult state and reached sexual maturity in late spring . = 1986 peach bowl = the 1986 peach bowl was a post @ -
