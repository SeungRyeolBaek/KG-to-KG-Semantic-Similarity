" Exit Through the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart " was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the twenty @-@ third season of The Simpsons ( 2011 – 12 ) . It spoofs the debated status of street art as a true form of art . The title is a reference to Exit Through the Gift Shop , a 2010 street art documentary by graffiti artist Banksy who produced the opening sequence of an earlier Simpsons episode titled " MoneyBART " ( 2010 ) . The Richard Hawley song " Tonight The Streets Are Ours " , which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop , is included in the episode during a montage of Bart painting graffiti in Springfield . Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club noted in his review of " Exit Through the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart " that the " reveal that the art show was a police sting gives the show a moment to joke about the anti @-@ art market theme from Exit Through The Gift Shop . Wiggum asks who would be stupid enough to pay for work that an amateur puts up for free in public , and the answer is , as in Banksy ’ s movie , the very wealthy , here represented by Mr. Burns . "

American street artist Fairey guest starred in " Exit Through the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart " as himself . The graffiti art featuring Homer 's face and the word " dope " that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to Fairey 's Barack Obama " Hope " poster and his OBEY Giant image . Fairey has said that The Simpsons has been one of his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its " blend of humor and social commentary " , and he felt " deeply honored " to be included in an episode . Fairey wrote on his website that " Part of being on The Simpsons , is you ’ re being honored as a reference point in culture . " He described the plot of the episode as " great " , adding that the staff members of the show " were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed ( even though I had to make fun of myself to do so ) . " This was Fairey 's first acting performance . Street artists English , Scharf , and Conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves .

The traditional Simpsons opening sequence was replaced in this episode with a redesigned version that spoofed the opening sequence of the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones . The Game of Thrones opening shows the various locations featured in the series on a three @-@ dimensional map of the fictional continent Westeros . In the Simpsons opening , these locations were substituted with places in Springfield , and The Wall was replaced with the Simpson family 's couch . The theme song featured in the Game of Thrones opening sequence was arranged by The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen and used in the Simpsons opening as well . Nicholas McKaig , known for uploading a cappella covers of famous songs on YouTube , performed the Simpsons theme song over the closing credits of " Exit Through the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart " . He was recruited after a staff member of the show saw his cover of the Simpsons theme on YouTube .
