Born in Fuenlabrada , Community of Madrid , Torres became interested in football as a child and joined his first team , Parque 84 , at the age of five . His father José Torres worked during Torres ' childhood , and his mother Flori Sanz travelled daily with him to training sessions . His grandfather was not a passionate football fan , but took pride in being an Atlético Madrid supporter , and Torres inherited his love for the club .

Torres started playing football as a goalkeeper , the position his brother played in . When he was seven years old , however , he started playing regularly as a striker in an indoor league for the neighbourhood club , Mario 's Holland , using the characters from the anime Captain Tsubasa as inspiration . Three years later , aged 10 , he progressed to an 11 @-@ side team , Rayo 13 . He scored 55 goals in a season and was one of three Rayo 13 players to earn a trial with Atlético .

After progressing through the ranks , Torres won his first important youth title in 1998 . Atlético sent an under @-@ 15 team to compete in the Nike Cup , in Spain and Europe , to play against youth teams from other clubs ; Atlético won the tournament . He was later voted the best player in Europe for the age group . In 1999 , at the age of 15 , Torres signed his first professional contract with Atlético . He spent his first year playing in the youth team and participated in the Honor Division when he was 16 . The 2000 – 01 season had started badly , as Torres suffered from a cracked shinbone which kept him out until December . Torres trained with the first team to get prepared for pre @-@ season , but eventually made his debut for the team on 27 May 2001 , at the Vicente Calderón Stadium , against CD Leganés . A week later , he scored his first goal for the club against Albacete Balompié and the season finished with Atlético narrowly missing out on promotion to La Liga .

Atlético were promoted to La Liga at the end of the 2001 – 02 season , although Torres did not perform well in the season , as he netted only 6 times in 36 appearances in the Segunda División . Torres ' first season in La Liga , 2002 – 03 , was better , however , as he scored 13 goals in 29 appearances , with Atlético finishing in 11th place . In July 2003 , soon after his takeover of the club , Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich had a £ 28 million bid for Torres rejected by Atlético 's board . In the 2003 – 04 season , his second in La Liga , Torres made further strides , scoring 19 league goals in 35 appearances , meaning he finished as joint third highest scorer in the league . At the age of 19 , Torres was named Atlético 's captain . Atlético narrowly missed out on qualification for the UEFA Cup , but by finishing in seventh place in the 2003 – 04 season , they qualified for the 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup , giving Torres a first taste of a competition at the European level . He scored two goals in the two fourth round matches against OFK Beograd , with one coming in each leg . Atlético reached the Final , but lost 3 – 1 on a penalty shoot @-@ out to Villarreal CF following a 2 – 2 draw on aggregate . FA Premier League champions Chelsea were believed to be interested in signing Torres during the summer of 2005 , but Atlético president Enrique Cerezo said that they had " no chance " of signing him . Cerezo later said in January 2006 that the club was willing to listen to offers for Torres , and Torres claimed Newcastle United of the FA Premier League had made a bid to sign him in March .

He stated after the 2006 FIFA World Cup that he had turned down an offer to join Chelsea at the end of the 2005 – 06 season . Torres scored 14 league goals in the 2006 – 07 season . The English media reported that he was the main transfer target of Premier League Liverpool , but Cerezo stated " We 've received no offer from Liverpool or any other club or player " . However , a few days later , new reports suggested Atlético had agreed a deal with Liverpool for Torres ; the fee was rumoured to be £ 25 million with Luis García moving to Atlético in a separate transfer deal . On 30 June , Atlético announced a deal to sign Diego Forlán from Villarreal , in what was seen as a move to replace Torres before his departure became official . On 2 July , it was reported that Torres had cut short a vacation to fly back to Madrid to finalise the move to Liverpool . The following day , Torres passed a medical at Liverpool 's Melwood training ground . He held a press conference in Madrid on 4 July to bid farewell to the Atlético fans , before completing his move to Liverpool on a six @-@ year contract . The transfer fee was the highest in Liverpool 's history . In March 2008 , manager Rafael Benítez stated in an interview with The Times that Torres was acquired for around £ 20 million , although this figure takes into account García 's move to Atlético .
