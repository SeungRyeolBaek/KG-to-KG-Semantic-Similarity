Technology altered people’s daily lives by innovations such as the wheel, harnessing oxen, weaving fabrics, brewing alcohol, and skillful metalwork, producing new weapons and tools, with fine gold ware and jewels, such as brooches and torcs. According to john t. koch and others, ireland in the Bronze Age was part of the trading maritime culture of the atlantic period, which also included britain, western france, and iberia, and that it was here that celtic languages were developed.

In the Iron Age a celtic culture appeared in ireland. In the Iron Age, the emergence of the celts on the island of ireland – this contrasts with the traditional view of the origin of the celts in mainland Europe – is not true – it is, on the contrary, in the belief that their origin was in mainland Europe and in the hallstatt.

According to john t. koch and others, ireland in the Bronze Age is part of the maritime culture of the atlantic period, which includes britain, western france and iberia, and was here that the celtic languages were developed. (The second century BC), the period of metal-making started at about 2500 BC (in the second century BC). It was at this period that the iron-making culture appeared in Ireland.

Among other schools, there is more than one school of thought on how this happened in Ireland. This is based on the Lebor Gabala erenn, a medieval, christian, pseudo-Christian history of Ireland, and the presence of the celtic language, language and artefacts found in Ireland, such as celtic spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted things of the celtic cult. This long-standing, traditional view, once widely accepted, is that celtic language, ogham script and culture were introduced to ireland by waves of invading or migrating celts from mainland Europe. On the contrary, the idea is that the origin of the celts was in mainland Europe and in the hallstatt. ... In the second century BC the period of metalmaking began about 2500 BC.

Among other schools, there are many different schools of thought about this in Ireland. The theory states that there were four invasions of the celtic in Ireland. The first, the priteni, followed by the belgae of northern Gaul and brittany. Later on, the laighins of armorica (present-day brittany) invaded ireland and brittany simultaneously.

Some of the proponents of this theory hold that there was probably a migratory flow of smaller groups of celts to Ireland, which made a sufficient migration stream, but that it was not the root cause of the insularization of celts. Some of the proponents of this theory claim that there was, probably, a large flow of celts to Ireland, which enabled it to make a sufficient migration, but that it was not the cause of the insularization of the celts. To some extent, historical linguists are sceptical that this method alone could explain the absorption of the celts, and they say that an assumed processional view of the linguistic formation of the celts is “an especially dangerous activity.” But, taking into account both these facts, a recent study has remarked that modern celtic speakers in ireland could be regarded as European “atlantic celts” showing a shared ancestry from north iberia to western scandinavia, and that their ancestry was not at all exclusively northern European. Some of the proponents of this theory assert that there was probably a flow of smaller groups of celts to Ireland, which was sufficient, but that it was not the root cause of the insularization of the celts. Historical linguists are sceptical that the use of this method alone can explain the process of the insularization of the celtic language, and some say that an assumption of the processional nature of the celtic language is “a particularly hazardous exercise.
