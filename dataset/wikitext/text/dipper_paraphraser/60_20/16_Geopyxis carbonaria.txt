The thick skin of the fungus is protected by the roots of the pine, and the high production of fruit after a fire can be seen as a result of a successful fungal escape from a dying host where the fungus no longer has the necessary biotrophic attachment. ... a study conducted in Norway showed that there was more burning in places than in those where there was no burning, and in clear, sloping places. It was observed that large fruitings of the fungus are often associated with destruction of the host tree, as in the case of burning. Spruce forests, with up to seventy-nine fruit-bodies per square meter, were much denser than pine forests, where fruit-bodies were intermittent. The thick skin of the fungus is protected by the roots of the pine, and the high production of fruit after a fire is evident from a successful escape from a dying host, in which the fungus has no longer found a biological attachment.
