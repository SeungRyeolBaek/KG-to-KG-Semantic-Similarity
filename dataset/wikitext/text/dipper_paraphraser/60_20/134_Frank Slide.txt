During the study of the earthquake, the scientists from the gsc determined that the cause was the unstable anticline of the mountain. A layer of limestone rested on soft rock, and after years of erosion produced a steep, heavy cliff. In the east, cracks covered the eastern side of the mountain, while under the ground, the water slipped into the core. The earthquake, resulting from a study of the mountain, was proved by the scientists from the Gsc. A limestone ledge was laid down on the soft rock, and the cliff had a steep and heavy face after years of erosion. There were also cracks in the east and a hollow in the earth beneath the ground, where the water slipped into the cave. At the time of the earthquake, the scientists from the Gsc had determined that the rock was deformed by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and this was also a factor. The miners noticed that the mountain had become more unstable during the months preceding the slide, and the small tremors in the gullies were felt at depths of about a metre (three ft) and a metre, a hundred feet (four hundred feet). At the time of the earthquake, the scientists from the Gsc determined that the rock was deformed by a peculiarly warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and that this was also a factor. A limestone ledge was laid on the soft rock, and the cliff had a steep and heavy face after years of erosion. The holes in the east and a hollow in the earth beneath the ground let water slip through the cave. A study of the mountain, however, was proved by the geologists from the Gsc. A limestone ledge was laid on the soft rock, and the cliff had a steep, heavy face after years of erosion. A large rock slab was placed on the soft rock, and the cliff had a steep and heavy face after years of erosion. Water in the canyons freezed and thawed, weakening the supports of the mountain. From March to April heavy snow fell in the region, followed by a warm April, causing the snow to melt into the cracks. After the earthquake, the scientists from the Gsc were convinced that the rock was caused by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and that this was also a factor. The study of the mountain, however, was proved by the geologists from the Gsc. A ledge of limestone was laid on the soft rock, and the cliff had a steep and heavy face after years of erosion. Moreover, the holes in the east and a hole under the earth beneath the earth allowed water to enter the cave. The geologists thought that the ice and the rapid freezing caused the fractures to expand and melt, and the rock would break and fall down. During the excavations, the scientists from the Gsc found that the rock was deformed by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and this was also a factor. But the geologists from the Gsc concluded that the mining activities had contributed to the collapse, but the owners of the train, which arrived at frank just before the earthquake, said that it was the coldest night of the winter, with a temperature of 17 ° C (0° f). The geologists speculated that the cold winter and the rapid freezing caused the ground to expand and the sediments to break down. Water in the canyons freezed and thawed, weakening the support of the mountain. At the time of the earthquake, the scientists of the Gsc concluded that the rock was deformed by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and this was also a factor. The researchers of the Gsc had concluded that mining activities caused the slide, but the mine owners said the opposite. For the study of the mountain, the scientists from the Gsc decided that the rock was deformed by a peculiarly warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and this was also a factor. But the geologists from the Gsc determined that the rock was deformed by a peculiarly warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and this was also a factor. At the time of the earthquake, the geologists from the Gsc determined that the rock was deformed by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and this was also a factor. On the eastern side of the mountain, a few cracks were exposed, and below the ground, water entered the base. The geologists were convinced that the rock was deformed by a peculiarly warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and this was also a factor. The geologists, however, decided that the mining had caused the quake, but the mine owners said the opposite. They thought that the ice and the rapid freezing caused the fractures to expand and melt, and the rock would collapse and fall. The scientists from the Gsc, however, proved that the mine had caused the quake, but the mine owners in the Train, which arrived just before the earthquake, said that it was the coldest night of the winter, with a temperature of 17° C (°F). The geologists argued that the ice and the rapid freezing caused the rocks to expand and the sediments to break down, and the water in the canyons freezed and thawed, weakening the mountain. The geologists from the Gsc have discovered that the rock was caused by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and that this was also a factor. After the earthquake, the geologists from the Gsc pronounced that the rock was caused by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and that this was also a factor. At the time of the earthquake, the geologists from the Gsc determined that the rock was distorted by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and that this was also a factor. The geologists concluded that the mine had caused the collapse, but the miners on the train, coming to their feet at the time of the earthquake, declared that it was the coldest night When the earthquake was analyzed, the scientists from the Gsc concluded that the rock was broken by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and that was a factor. The geologists believed that the rock was broken by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and that was also a factor. During the excavations, the scientists from the Gsc determined that the rock was broken by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and that was also a factor. During the mining, the geologists from the Gsc proved that the rock was broken by an unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and that this was also a factor. The geologists concluded that the rock was broken by a peculiarly warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and this was also a factor. In the east, cracks were exposed, and water was blown through the basement. The geologists believed that the rocks were broken by a special warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, and this was also a factor. However, the geologists concluded that the mine was to blame, but the owners of the train, which arrived just before the earthquake, said that it was the coldest night of the winter, 17° C. The geologists argued that the ice and the rapid freezing caused the rocks to expand and break, and the water in the canyons frozen and thawed, weakening the mountains. The geologists believed that the mine was to blame, but the explorers of the Gsc declared that the mine was to blame, but the explorers of the train, which arrived just before the earthquake, said that it was the coldest night of the winter, 17° C (F) and the geologists argued that the ice and the rapid freezing caused the cracks to expand and melt, and the water in the canyons froze and thawed, weakening the mountain. The explorers of the Gsc found that the rock was to blame for an unusually warm winter, warm days and cold nights, and this was also a factor. After the earthquake, the geologists from the Gsc determined that the rock was distorted by an unusually warm winter, warm days and cold nights, and that this was also a factor.

There were also the tales of the two years before, and the last, the last to survive, the steep hill. The slide has been the subject of several novels, both historical and fictional.'The steep hill was the destination of the slide,' said the old lady, who had died in 1995.

A couple of novels about the tunnel, both historical and fictional, have been written about it. The path to the canyon was traversed by 23 people, at the height of the canyon, as well as by 17 miners who had escaped from the tunnels under the turtle mountain. - The path to the canyon is through the canyon, and there are 23 people, up the canyon, besides the 17 miners who had escaped from the tunnels under the turtle mountain. There are other stories about the two years before and the last to survive the canyon - the steep hill. In the course of the cliff, there were 23 people on the ground level of the canyon, and 17 miners who had escaped from the tunnels under the turtle mountain.

" And so, when the story of the three of them had survived the plunge was a story of a fable. The descent was mentioned in various folklores: "The steep hill is the source of the slide," the old lady had said in 1995. The footpath is also described in various poems, such as: “How the mountain came down,” by Tom Tom Connors, and more recently 'Skip the Tongue,' by Alvan ’s rural alberta advantage. The latter, in fact, is the name of the final, last surviving stage of the slide. Two novels have been written about the path, both historical and fictional.
