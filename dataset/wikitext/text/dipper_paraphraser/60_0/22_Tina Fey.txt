And from this spectra radial velocity was calculated. And a suspicion arose that radial velocity was caused by the radial spectra of a star in a spectroscopic binary. And the fact that the body on which I was located was called I am a planet, called I am a planet. The observations he made, and a suspicion arose that radial velocity was caused by the radial spectra of a star in a binary. And from this spectra the radial velocity was calculated.
