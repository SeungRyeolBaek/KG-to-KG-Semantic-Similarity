 Antimony is a chemical element with the symbol sb (from Latin: stibium) and the atomic number 51. It is a gray-grey metalloid, found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (sb2s3). Antimony was known since ancient times and was used in cosmetics. Metallic antimony was also known, but was mistakenly identified as lead upon its discovery. Antimony is a chemical element, with the symbol sb (from Latin: stibium), with the atomic number 51. It is a gray-grey metalloid which is found in nature, chiefly in the form of stibnite (sb2). In the west it was first isolated by vannoccio biringuccio in 1540, although it has been used since antiquity in the form of eye shadows, as well as in the form of eyeshadows, and is often called "kohl" in arabic. In the past, it was used in the cosmetics industry, but it was mistakenly pronounced lead, after it was found. For some time, china has been the biggest producer of antimony and its compounds, and most of the antimony and its compounds are produced from Xikuangshan, hunan. The industrial process for the production of antimony is boiling and burning carbon, or using tungsten to oxidize it. As a chemical element, with the symbol sb, which comes from Latin sulfia, it is a gray-grey metalloid, which is mostly found in nature, especially in the form of stibnite (sb2). Antimony is a chemical element with the symbol sb (from Latin sulfia), with the atomic number 51. It is a gray-grey metalloid, which is found in nature in the form of stibnite (sb2); in the west it was first isolated in 1540 by vannoccio biringuccio in 1540, though it was known in antiquity for its fragrance, and it was called kohl in arabic; in the past it was used in the cosmetics industry, but it was pronounced to be lead, when it was found. Similarly, metal-metal-like substances were discovered, but were pronounced to be lead after it was found. The most important applications for metallic antimony are to bind lead and tin and to make lead-tin plates for lead-tin batteries. This is a common chemical for silicon dioxide and zinc, and the most important for this are antimony alloys for lead and tin; and to combine lead and tin to improve the properties of alloys used in bullets, shells and ball bearings. The oxidation process of oxidation of antimony is carbon-foaming, and it is a chemical element with the symbol S, sulfia. It is a gray-grey metalloid, and primarily known as stibnite (sb2). In the west it was first discovered in 1540 by vannoccio biringuccio, though it was known in antiquity for its perfume, and it was called kohl in arabic; the time when it was used in the cosmetics industry it was mistakenly called lead.

This book, the Triumphal Chariot of Antimony, which explains the preparation of antimony, was published in germany in 1604. The antimony discovered by the German chemist AndrÃ©s libavius in 1615, who obtained it by adding iron to a boiling mixture of antimony sulfide, salt, and potassium tartrate. This preparation produced the antimony crystallized or starch-like. But in the book of pirotechnia by vannoccio biringuccio he cites the more famous book of agricola, de re metallica. This book, the currus triumphalis antimonii (the triumphal chariot of antimony), was published in germany in 1604. It purports to have been written by a Benedictine monk under the name of basilius valentinus in the 15th century. In this way agricola has often been mistakenly credited with the discovery of metal antimony.

The huge oxidation of antimony is not harmful to human or environmental health. In oxidation of antimony, and other substances, which are not soluble in water, are considered harmful and suspected of being cancerous. In oxidation of antimony, antimony trioxide and other substances, insoluble in water, are considered harmful and suspected of being cancerous. The explosion of antimony, which is not solid, is not combustible. The inhalation of antimony, which is not soluble in water, causes a cough, inflammation, and, eventually, cancer. The large oxidation of antimony is not harmful to human or environmental health; the inhalation of antimony and other substances, insoluble in water, is considered harmful and suspected of being cancerous. Antimony trioxide and other substances, insoluble in water, are considered harmful and suspected of being cancerous. The excessive oxidation of antimony is not harmful to human or environmental health; the inhalation of nitrates, which are not soluble in water, leads to inflammation and tumors, not to the release of antimony ions (oecd. 2008). The scale of antimony is not harmful to human or environmental health; the inhalation of antimony trioxide and other substances, insoluble in water, is considered harmful and suspected of being cancerous. Besides, the perceptible absorption of antimony trioxide and other substances of insoluble sb is estimated at eight percent, while the perceptible absorption of soluble sb is estimated at one percent. 10 the result is 0.1% sbh3... when inserted in the presence of hydrogen... [15] in the presence of new hydrogen it may form stibine (sbh3).... the 8 hour-average duration (twa) is set at 0@... 5 mg / m3 by the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists and the OSHA Office of Safety and Health (oSHA) as a permissible exposure limit (pel) in the workplace... To put it in the presence of hydrogen... It might be converted to stibine (sbh3). [90] As a result, the amount of sbh3 is 0.1%... as a result of hydrogen... [91] when inserted in hydrogen... [92] in the presence of new hydrogen, stibine... 25,[90]... a normal time of eight hours is a 0; the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (Niosh) has a recommended limit (result) of 0 @... 5 mg / m3 as an 8-hour interval. A normal eight-hour period is a 0; the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (Niosh) has recommended a limit of 0.01 sbh3... in the presence of hydrogen... â [389] So sbh3 is 0.1%... when infused in hydrogen... in the presence of new hydrogen... sbh3... in the presence of hydrogen... in the presence of new hydrogen... stibine... The study reported that the antimony ion concentrations in fruit juices (up to 44... 7 g / l of antimony) were somewhat higher than in drinking water... but the concentrations were not measured under the drinking water... The study revealed that the ion concentrations of antimony (as high as 44.7 g / l) were rather higher than in the drinking water. (But these concentrations did not occur in the drinking water.) The water standards for saline are as follows: World Health Organization, 20 g / l japan, 20 g / l eu and Germany's Environment Department, 5 g / l eu and the German federal Ministry of Environment, 5 g / l the tdi proposed by who is 6 g antimony per kilogram of body weight.) So saline is 0.1% saline in hydrogen... in the presence of hydrogen... in the presence of hydrogen... in the presence of hydrogen... in the presence of hydrogen... in the presence of hydrogen... in the presence of hydrogen... saline... So sbh3 is 0.1%... if it is infused in hydrogen... in the presence of hydrogen... in the presence of hydrogen... in the presence of hydrogen... stibine... in the presence of hydrogen... in the presence of hydrogen... stibine...
