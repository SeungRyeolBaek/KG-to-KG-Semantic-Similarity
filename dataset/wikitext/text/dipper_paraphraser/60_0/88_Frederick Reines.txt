That induced me to be obsessed with light... This induced me to love science in my senior year. Reines, ironically, excelled in literature and history, but in science and math in his first year of high school he was only average or low in the first year of high school, and by his junior and senior years he had a key to the laboratory in the school. “Reines was a soloist and choirman.

Despite the sputnik crisis, he was interested in the dangers of radioactive pollution from air-dropping nuclear tests, and he fought for the underground nuclear testing. In spite of, or perhaps because of his role in these nuclear tests, reines was conscious of the dangers of radioactive contamination from atmospheric nuclear tests, and was an advocate of underground nuclear testing. During the sputnik crisis, he participated in the project of john archibald wheeler, which developed into jason. “But he had a good idea: he joined Feynman’s t (deflections) group, which was part of hans bethe’s t (mathematical) group.

As soon as they were told that neutrinos could penetrate the earth, they realized that there was no physical way to observe them. “Why did we want to examine the free neutrino?” he asked, later explaining. “ Because every one told us you could not do it. They knew as soon as they found out that neutrinos could penetrate the earth, that they could not see them. As soon as they were told that neutrinos could penetrate the earth, they decided that there was no physical way to see them. "So why did we want to see the free neutrino?" he asked later. "The idea was that there was no physical way. Moreover, once they had discovered that neutrinos were able to penetrate the earth, they concluded that there was no physical means of seeing them. When they were told that neutrinos could penetrate the earth, they felt that there was no physical way of seeing them. "So why did we want to see the free neutrino?" he asked later. "The idea was that there was no physical way. It was assumed that as soon as they had been told that neutrinos could penetrate the earth, they would not see them. So they began to realize that by adding cadmium to their liquid scintillator, they would increase the capturing of neutrinos, and that the result would be a cyclophtus blast.

At that time, the telegram reported to pauli that the neutrino had been found. When Bethe was told that he was not right, he said: "You should not believe everything that is said in the newspapers...

When Bethe was told that he was not right, he said: “You must not believe everything you read in the newspapers.” From that time on, reines dedicated the major part of his career to the study of the neutrino’s properties and interactions, which would shape the study of the neutrino for future scientists.
