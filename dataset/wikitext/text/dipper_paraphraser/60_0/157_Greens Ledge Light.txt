The French losses were less severe. The action was declared a defeat by the admiralty and was not reported in the london newspaper. The British naval authorities were particularly disturbed by rumors about the death of Captain Corbet and the conduct of his crew during the battle. The action was declared to be a defeat by the admiralty and was not mentioned in the London papers. There were rumors about the death of Captain Corbet and the conduct of his men during the battle. One of the most dreadful was the suggestion that Captain Corbet had been murdered by his unpopular crew; historian william james wrote in 1827 that “there are many who claim that Captain Corbet’s (by way of example) death was committed by one of his own men... “ although he remark that the incident would be improbable if Corbet had been shot by a single of his own guns. In addition, he gave more weight to the idea that Corbet had committed suicide in order to avoid the shame of defeat, that he had cut off the bandages of his amputated limb and suffered a bleed to death... The British authorities were particularly disturbed by rumors of Captain Corbet's death and the conduct of his crew. The action was declared a defeat by the admiralty, and was not mentioned in the London papers. A new and horrifying accusation was that Captain Corbet had been murdered by his unpopular band; historian William james wrote in 1827 that "a great many claim that Captain Corbet's death was committed by one of his own men, " but he said that the incident was unlikely if Corbet had been shot by a single of his own guns. The truth of Corbet's death will never be known, although james finally concludes that the wound was likely to be fatal, and therefore most probable. In addition, he stressed the fact that Corbet had committed suicide, to avoid the shame of defeat, that he had cut off the bandages of his amputated limb and suffered a bleeding to death... this story was also mentioned in the 1825 history of edward pelham brenton: "Corbet did not (we fear) survive his capture. " A second accusation, even more controversial in the aftermath of the attack, was the assertion that the crew of africaine had abandoned their guns, refused to load them, or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest of Corbet's behavior. There were rumors about the death of Captain Corbet and his crew during the battle. The action was declared to be a defeat by the admiralty, but it was not mentioned in the London papers. A new and terrible accusation was made about Captain Corbet's wretched crew; historian William james wrote in 1827 that "many people claim that Captain Corbet's death was committed by one of his own men," but that this could not be ruled out if Corbet had been shot by one of his own guns. Another accusation was made about the crew of africaine, who, blundering their guns, "did not shoot, and did not shoot" after the first or second broadside, while blundering the facts in 1833, said that they "would rather kill a French broadside" than fight with Corbet, this is also told in the 1825 history of Edward Penton, "Corbet did not (we fear) survive his capture." The British authorities were particularly worried about the death of Captain Corbet and the conduct of his crew. In the last chapter, a second, more controversial one, was the claim that the crew of africaine had abandoned their guns, refused to load them, or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest of Corbet's behaviour. In addition, he emphasized the fact that Corbet had committed suicide in order to avoid the shame of defeat, that he had cut off the bandages of his amputated limb and suffered a bloody bleed..., this story was also mentioned in the 1825 history of Edward Pelham brenton: 'Corbet did not (we fear) survive his capture.

The fact of their death will never be known, although, in the end, the most probable occurrence is that of the shot. The crew of africaine abandoned their guns, refused to load them, or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest to Corbet's behavior. A second accusation, even more controversial in the aftermath of the attack, was that the crew of africaine had abandoned their guns, refused to load them, or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest to It was the most dreadful accusation of Captain Corbet and his crew during the battle; there were rumours about the death of Captain Corbet and the conduct of his crew.

The crew of africaine abandoned their guns, refused to load them, or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest of Corbet’s conduct. The second accusation, even more controversial, was the assertion that the crew of africaine had abandoned their guns, refused to load them, or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest of Corbet’s conduct. In the last chapter, a second, more controversial accusation was presented, that the crew of africaine had abandoned their guns, refused to load them, or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest of Corbet’s conduct. A second accusation, even more strongly alleged, was that the crew of africaine had abandoned their guns, refused to load them, or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest of Corbet’s behaviour. The crew of africaine abandoned their guns, refused to load them, or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest of Corbet’s conduct.
