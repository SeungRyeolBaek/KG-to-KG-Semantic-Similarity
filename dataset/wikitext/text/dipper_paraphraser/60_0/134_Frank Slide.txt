Then the captain resigned the captain, ordered the town to evacuate, and the geological survey of canada sent two geologists to investigate: they found that the recent slide had created two new peaks on the mountain, and that the north peaks, which faced the city, were not in danger.

The official did not abandon the captain, ordered the city to evacuate, and the geological survey sent two geologists to investigate, and they found that the recent slide created two new peaks on the mountain, and that the , then in the middle of the slide, a study was carried out by the geological surveyor, who found that the chief cause of the instability was the instability of the anticline of the mountain, which had an unstable anticline. Its hard limestone layer rested on soft material and after years of erosion caused the mountain to stand atop a steep cliff, one of which formed the peak of a mountain of a heavy cliff. The local indigenous people, the black-foot and the ktunaxa, were said to be using the word'moves' to refer to the mountain as'moving mountains.' They were drilled in the middle of the slide, and then, in the middle of the slide, a survey was conducted, and it was found that the main cause of the collapse was the anticline of the mountain, which had an unstable anticline. The hard limestone slab was stacked on the soft material, and after years of erosion, the mountain was raised on a steep cliff and its peak was said to be the height of a heavy cliff. The people of the mountain, the ktunaxa and the black-foot, used the word “moves” to refer to the mountain as “moving mountains.” The miners noticed that the mountain had become more unstable in the months before the fall; they felt small tremors, and the superintendent reported a general strain at the depths of one and a half metres (three and a half feet) and one and a half, ten feet. But the collapsing angle and the scree ring were drilled in the middle of the dip, and then, in the middle of the dip, a survey was conducted, and it was found that the main cause of the slide was the anticline of the mountain, which had an unstable anticline. The hard limestone layer was stacked on the soft layer, and after years of erosion the mountain ascended a steep cliff, and its summit was called a high cliff. The people of the mountain, the black-foot and the black-foot, said that the mountain was “moving mountains”; they were drilled in the middle of the slide, and then, in the middle of the slide, a survey was conducted, and it was found that the main cause of the collapse was the anticline of the mountain, which had an unstable anticline. The groundwater in the valleys froze and thawed repeatedly, strengthening the tendons of the mountain. The geologists concluded that the weather at night likely triggered the slide. The indigenous people, the ktunaxa and the black-foot, called the mountain ‘moving mountains’. The miners noticed that the mountain had become more unstable in the months before the fall; they felt a few tremors, and the superintendent said that there was a general strain at the depths of one and a half metres (three and a half feet) and one and a half, ten feet. Several times the ground in the valley froze and thawed, making the rocks of the mountains stronger. The geologists concluded that the ice and snowstorm probably triggered the ice and snow. The local indigenous people, the ktunaxa and the black foot, called the mountain'moving mountains.' The people of the mountain, the ktunaxa and the black foot, called the mountain'moving mountains'. The people of the mountain, the black foot and the black foot, said that the mountain was moving mountains, drilled in the middle of the dip, and then, in the middle of the dip, a survey was conducted, and it was found that the main cause of the collapse was the anticline of the mountain, which had an unstable anticline. The hard limestone was laid on the soft layer, and after years of erosion the mountain ascended a steep cliff, and its summit was said to be a mountain of heavy cliffs. The miner observed that the mountain had become more unstable in the months before the fall; they felt some tremors, and the superintendent said that there was a general strain at the depths of one and a half feet (three and a half feet) and one and a half feet. The miners noticed that the mountain had become more unstable in the months before the fall; they felt a little tremors, and the superintendent reported that the strain was general at the depths of one and a half feet (three and a half feet) and one and a half feet. The indigenous peoples, the ktunaxa and the black-foot, called the mountain a “moving mountain”. The miner's staff of the freight train, which had arrived at Frank just before the disaster, said it was the coldest night of winter, with overnight temperatures falling below 18°C (0°F). The geologists decided that the weather was likely to cause the slide. The geologists determined that the weather at night may have caused the slide. But the collapse angle and the scree ring were drilled in the middle of the rock, and then in the middle of the rock, a survey was conducted and it was found that the main cause of the collapse was the anticline of the mountain, which had an unstable anticline. The hard limestone was laid on the soft layer, and after years of erosion, the mountain rose up to a high cliff, and the peak was called the cliff. The geologists concluded that the ice and snowstorm probably caused the ice and snow. The local people, the ktunaxa and the black foot, called the mountain "moving mountains". The miner noticed that the mountain had become more unstable in the months before the fall; they felt a little tremor, and the superintendent said that there was a general strain at the depths of one and a half feet (three and a half feet) and one and a half feet. The people of the mountain, the ktunaxa and the black foot, called the mountain a "moving mountain", drilled in the middle of the quake, and then in the middle of the quake, a survey was conducted, and it was found that the main cause of the collapse was the anticline of the mountain, which had an unstable anticline. The rock of the valley froze and thawed, strengthening the muscles of the mountains. The miners noticed that the mountain had grown more unstable in the months before the fall; they felt a little tremor, and the superintendent said that there was a general strain at the depths of one and a half feet (three and a half feet) and one and a half feet.

The alberta geological survey has been studying this mountain for several years... this mountain, constantly studied for its instability, has been studied several times... the south-east hill would have a slope less than one-fifth of the 1903 hill.... geologists invented the term "mimicry avalanche" to describe the slippery slope. The "air cushion" theory, an early hypothesis, proposed that a layer of air was trapped between the rock and the mountain, which made the rock move more than was usual. " Acoustical fluidization" was another theory, which says that large masses of material reduce friction and cause the debris to flow down the mountain as if it were a liquid. This mountain, which has been repeatedly examined for its instability, has been studied several times. The south-east hill, which would be most likely to fall, would have a slope of less than one-fifth of the 1903 hill. The alberta geological survey has been studying this mountain for several years.

The "air cushion" theory, a preliminary hypothesis, posited that air had been trapped between the rock and the mountain, which caused the rock to move more than usual. The "Acoustic fluidization" theory, which is another theory, said that large masses of material reduce friction, and the debris of the mountain passes as if in liquid. Many legends and misconceptions had been spawned in the aftermath of the slide. The city of frank was claimed to have been buried, though many of the inhabitants had escaped unscathed.
