Both gaits are an intermediate speed between a walk and a gallop; ambling gaits are four-off-one, while the trot is two-off-one. he trains a single trot, called the'single-off' foot, which replaces the trot of a large number of horses. Both trots are an intermediate speed, the walk and the gallop, and they are four-off-one, while the trot is two-off-one. This reduces the movement of the front of the horse and eliminates the sway of a two-off-one -twist, a two-off-one, which was created by the moment of suspension, which led to the jolt of two feet on the ground, when the horse is moving from one leg to the other. he trains a single trot, called the single-off foot, which replaces the trot of a great many horses.

And thus, a rocky mountain horse, supported by a rider, can use the single-off foot to cover rough ground at seven miles per hour (11 km/h) and on smooth ground at 16 miles per hour (26 km/h). The faster speed is called the hack. But he trains a single trot, called the single-off foot, which replaces the trot of a great many horses.
