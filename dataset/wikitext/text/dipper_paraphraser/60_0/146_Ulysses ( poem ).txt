This zeal of the boys reminds them of his journey in the inferno’s 26th verse, in which he was condemned to the eighth circle of deceitful counsellors, for libel. Nevertheless, tennyson’s character is not that of a lover of public affairs like Homer, rather the ulisse of dante’s inferno is the chief source of his character, which has an important influence on the interpretation of the poem. But tennyson’s character is not a lover of public affairs like Homer, instead the ulisse of dante’s inferno is the main source of his character, which has an important influence on the interpretation of the poem. During the verse of the inferno, the boys recall his journey in the verse of the 26th verse, when he was condemned to the eighth circle of deceitful counsellors, for insubordination. Nevertheless, tennyson’s character is not a lover of public affairs like Homer. In the verse of the inferno, the boys remember his journey in the 26th verse Throughout the poem the vexations of aging and infirmity remained, but tennyson finally took ulysses, “to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield,” (69) – a kind of damnable desire for knowledge beyond all limits. Similarly the words of dante’s character as he exhorts his men to journey are paralleled by tennyson’s ulysses, who call his men to accompany him on one last journey. Throughout the poem, the sad, sickly mingled with old age and impotence remained, but at last tennyson would bring his ulisse into his head: ‘to search, to seek, to seek and not to yield,’ – a kind of damnable thirst for knowledge beyond all limits. Similarly, dante’s ulisse, in urging his men on a journey, is paralleled by tennyson’s ulisse, who beckons his men on one last journey. Similarly, the words of dante when he calls his men to go out on the journey are paralleled by ulisse’s ulisse, who calls his men to accompany him on one last journey. Nevertheless, critics note that in the homeric narrative ulisse’s mariners are dead. A certain irony is then developed in ulisse’s speech to his sailors: “Come, my friends, it’s not too late to seek a new world,” – 53 At times the old, sickly, anguish mingled with old age and impotence, but at last tennyson would call his ulisse into his head: “To seek, seek, seek, and not yield,”—a kind of damnable thirst for knowledge beyond all bounds. This determination of ulisse’s character in calling his men to travel is paralleled by tennyson’s ulisse, who calls his men to travel with him. The degrees to which tennyson’s ulisse identifies with the speaker have constituted one of the great debates of the study of the poem. Throughout the poem the mournful and sickly are mixed with old age and impotence, but tennyson finally brings in his ulisse, “to seek, seek, seek, and not yield,”—a kind of terrible thirst for knowledge beyond all limits. The degree to which tennyson identifies with ulisse has created one of the great conflicts of the scholarship concerning the poem. Besides, many other interpretations of the poem have developed from the argument that tennyson does not identify with ulisse, and this in turn has led to the further suggestion that the purported inconsistencies in ulisse’s character are the fault of the poet himself.
