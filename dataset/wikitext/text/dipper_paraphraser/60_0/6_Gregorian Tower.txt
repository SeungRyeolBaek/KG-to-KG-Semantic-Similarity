The chimera was a marble meter placed on the floor and measured in a north-north-north direction the height of the sun at noon, according to the seasons of the year. The observations made with the chimera were an essential confirmation of the necessity of reforming the Julian calendar.

The chimera observations with the chimera were an essential confirmation of the necessity of bringing back the Julian calendar. In contrast, the anemoscope was a complex device which was attached to the ceiling and used to measure the strength and direction of the wind, but it soon stopped working. The anemoscope, however, may have derived from the other name for the tower, wind-sheathed; but an ancient observatory at Athens, called the wind-head, might have inspired the building.
