Wheeler thus embarked upon a series of surveys and excavations with the assistance of leslie scott, beginning with the surveys of Brittany in the winter of 1936 – 37. After Maidan Castle he turned his attention to france, where the archaeological investigation of the ante-postic period was still long behind the advances of britain. He had also been made president of the museum associations, and in a parliamentary address to the British Ambassador in Belgère he spoke of the importance of preserving the collections of the museum in wartime, for he believed that the second European war was approaching. In anticipation of this occasion, he arranged in august 1939 for the London Museum to assign to a safe place some of its most important collections. Wheeler had also been awarded a doctorate from the university of bristol, and on the occasion of his conferment, he met the conservative politician winston churchill, who was writing his multivolume history of the English speaking world, and asked wheeler to help him in writing about the ante-postic and early medieval periods. In addition to bringing many british archaeologists to work on the site, he hired six local white-breeches to work on the site, believing that the oppidum was erected by the tribes of the old Iron Age, in order to protect them from the Roman invasion led by julius caesar.

Wheeler’s report, co-authored with katherine richardson, was published in 1957 in hill forts of northern france. In July 1939 the project turned to Normandy, the beginnings of which were in the iron-aged hill forts of Camp de Canada and duclair. They were abruptly stopped in september 1939, when the second world war broke out in europe and the team returned to britain. He then began a series of surveys and excavations with the help of leslie scott, beginning with the surveys of Brittany in winter 1936.
