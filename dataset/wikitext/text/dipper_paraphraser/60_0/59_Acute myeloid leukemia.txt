Then they had a low red blood cell count (AN) which caused fatigue, pale and shortness of breath, and a low platelet count (AN) caused easy bleeding or bleeding in a single shock. Occasionally a solid leukemia would develop, or a tumor of the bone marrow, called a leukemia. The early signs of aml were generally vague and not exactly defined, and were like those of the flu or other common illnesses. The symptoms were fever, fatigue, weight loss or loss of appetite, shortness of breath, anemia, bruising or bleeding, petechiae (round, pinhole-like patches under the skin caused by bleeding), joint pain and discomfort. The numbers of red blood cells were low, and the low number of platelets was low, and it was easy to get bruising or bleeding in a single shock.

It is worth mentioning that the staining of the blood and bone marrow smears, cytochemistry staining, can be helpful in the diagnosis of aml and the classification of aml. The myeloperoxidase or sudan black reactions are most useful for establishing aml’s identity and defining it from all. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to determine a monocytic component in amls and to distinguish a poorly differentiated leukemia from all. The diagnosis and classification of aml can be difficult and should be performed by a qualified hematologist or a hematologist. The stain of blood and bone marrow stains is useful in the diagnosis of aml and in the classification of aml. It is worth mentioning that cytochemistry staining on blood and bone marrow stains can be helpful in the diagnosis of aml and in the classification of aml. The presence of certain morphologic features (such as auer rods) or specific results from cytochemistry can be useful in distinguishing aml from other leukemias; however, in cases without such features, the diagnosis may be more difficult. It is worth noting that the staining of blood and bone marrow smears, cytochemistry staining, can be helpful in the diagnosis of aml and in the classification of aml. The two most commonly used classification systems for aml are the older French - american - british fab system and the newer WHO - which - the new world health organization. according to the widely used fab system, the diagnosis of aml is made by at least 20 % involvement of leukemic myeloblasts, except in the three best prognostic forms of aml, with recurrent genetic abnormalities (t (8 - 21), inv - 16, t ( 15 - 17) in which the presence of the genetic abnormality is diagnostic irrespective of the blood type.

It is worth noting that the stain of blood and bone marrow stain, cytochemistry stain, can be useful in the diagnosis of aml and in the classification of aml. As a result of the widely used fab system, the diagnosis of aml is made with at least 20 % involvement of leukemic myeloblasts, except in the three best prognostic forms of aml, with ongoing genetic abnormalities (t (8-31), inv- 16, inv- 16, in which the presence of the genetic abnormality is diagnostic of every blood type. The identification of aml and the classification of aml is a difficult task, and it should be performed by a qualified hematologist or a hematologist. The cytochemistry staining of blood and bone marrow stain is useful in the diagnosis of aml and in the classification of aml. The old French-American fab system of diagnosis of aml is the older, most recognisable fab system, and the new one of WHO, the new world health organization. The classification of aml is more rigid, requiring a blast proportion of at least 30 % in bone marrow (bm) or peripheral blood (pb) as the detection of aml. – cytochemistry staining of blood and bone marrow smears can be useful in the diagnosis of aml and in the classification of aml.

But we must find out for ourselves whether the islets of apl and the amyloid is the fusion of apl. "But the question is whether the islets of apl and amyloid are fusions of apl. All the more so since it is not known for certain whether the amyloid is the islets of apl or amyloid. The who classification of amyloids consists of eight subtypes m0 through m7, based on the type of the leukemia and its maturity. "But we must know for ourselves whether apl and amyloid are fused. Astonished at that, there is no clear evidence to suggest that amyloid is an amyloid or an amyloid. It is true that the amyloid is an amyloid. The who classification of amyloids consists of eight classes m0 through m7, depending on the leukemia type and the maturity. The who classification (as was said above) may be more useful, but the fab system is still widely used. But we have to find out for ourselves whether the islets of apl and amyloid are fused. It is amazing that there is no clear evidence that amyloid is an amyloid or an amyloid. The otiological classification of amyloid is divided into eight categories m0 through m7, depending on the type of the leukemia and the age. The otiological classification of amyloid contains eight categories m0 through m7, according to the type of the leukemia and the age. The otiologic classification of amyloid includes rare diseases not included in the otiologic classification, such as acute basophilic leukemia, which was proposed as a ninth category, m8, in 1999. It is true that amyloid is an amyloid. But we must know for ourselves whether the islets of apl and amyloid are merged. But the question is whether the islets of apl and amyloid are merged. This fact is remarkable, for there is no clear proof that amyloid is an amyloid or an amyloid. It is astonishing that no clear proof exists that amyloid is an amyloid or an amyloid.

In normal hematopoiesis the myeloblast is an immature precursor of the myeloid, and it gradually becomes a mature myeloid. This mutation alone alone is not a cause of leukemia; however, if it is combined with other... genetic changes, a normal myeloblast accumulates, which "stack" the cell in its immature state and prevents its differentiation. a mutation that disrupts the control of the proliferation process, and in result a complete, uncontrolled growth of a mature clone of cells, which has become the clinical entity of aml. Most of the variation and heterogeneity of aml stems is due to the fact that the development of aml is at several different points along the developmental path. The classification of aml for all modern types recognizes that the characteristics and behavior of the leukemic cell (and the leukemia) depend on the stage of differentiation. The definition of aml for all modern types recognises that the properties and behavior of the leukemic cell (and the leukemic cell) depend on the stage of differentiation. Most of the variation and heterogeneity of aml stems from the fact that the development of aml takes place at several different points in its development. The chromosomal translocations are aberrant, usually transcription factors, whose alterations in the properties of the cells can have a "death of the matrix".... specific cytogenetic aberrations can be found in many patients with aml; these chromosomal aberrations often have prognostic implications. - t ([1] ] translocations produce a t-[2] - rar protein which binds to the retinoic acid receptor in the promoters of several myeloid gene genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation.

In this regard, treatment - related disease (that is, the disease of old chemotherapy) is rising. Treatment - related disease, as it were, accounts for about 10 - 20 % of all aml. .. In children, the prevalence of aml is increasing. As a result of this, treatment-related illness (that is, the disease of the old chemotherapy) is increasing. About ten to twenty percent of all aml is cured.... There is some geographic variation in the incidence of aml... In adults, the highest incidence is seen in north america, europe, and the tropics, while in asia and latin america it is rarer. In children, aml is growing; in this, too, disease of old chemotherapy increases; and a very significant increase in aml is seen in the treatment of old chemotherapy..... ten to twenty percent of all aml is cured. In adults, the highest incidence is in the north, in europe, in the tropics, and in asia and latin America. In children, the incidence of aml is increasing; therefore, the treatment of old chemotherapy increases; about ten to twenty percent of all aml is cured. There are geographical variations in the incidence of aml. In adults, the incidence is higher in the north, in europe, in the tropics, while in asia and latin America it is rarer. In children, aml is growing. This is because of the growth of treatment, that is, the disease of old chemotherapy. Treatment, as it were, is making about 10 - 20 % of all aml. In children, aml is growing; in this way the disease of old chemotherapy increases; and a very significant increase in aml is seen in treatment of old chemotherapy. In adults, the incidence is higher in the north, in the tropics, in asia and in latin America. In 1845, a series of people dying of enlarged spleens and changes in the "color and the consistency of their blood" was reported by the edinburgh pathologist j. In children aml is growing; hence aml’s disease is growing. Thus aml’s disease is growing; and this disease, that is, the disease of the old chemotherapy, is growing. The incidence of aml is growing. In this way aml’s disease is growing; in this way the disease of the old chemotherapy increases; and the treatment of the old chemotherapy increases very markedly. About ten to twenty percent of all aml is cured. There is a geographic variation in the incidence of aml. In adults the incidence is higher in the north, in the tropics, in the tropics, in asia and latin America. In 1845, a series of cases were reported from the east of Edinburgh to the edinburgh doctor j. bennett, and he used the term “leukemia” to describe this condition. In children aml is growing; so treatment of old chemotherapy increases; and very significant increases in aml are seen in treatment of old chemotherapy. In children aml grows; this means that the disease of old chemotherapy increases; in this way the disease of old chemotherapy increases; and very significant increases in aml are seen in treatment of old chemotherapy.

In adults, the incidence is higher in the north, in the tropics, in the asia and liu - liu - liu - d., as a pioneer in the use of the light microscope, virchow was the first to describe the abnormal excess of white blood cells in patients with the clinical syndrome described by velpeau and bennett, as virchow did not know the cause of the excess, he used the purely descriptive term "leukemia" (in the greek: "white blood"). In children, aml increases; therefore, treatment of old chemotherapy increases; so treatment of old chemotherapy increases; about ten to twenty percent of all aml is cured. In adults, the incidence is higher in the north, in the tropics, in the asia and latin America.

In 1877, paul ehrlich developed a technique for staining blood in 1877, paul ehrlich developed a method of staining blood, he said, "the opinion of paul ehrlich was scientifically hygienic, so he specialized in the But the term acute leukemia was a term coined by wilhelm ebstein in 1889 to distinguish rapidly refractory and fatal leukemias from more indolent chronic leukemias. The term “myeloid” was coined by franz Ernst Christian neumann in 1869, as he was the first to recognize that the white blood cells were effected in the bone marrow (GREEK: myelo) rather than in the spleen. But the term acute leukemia was an invented term by wilhelm ebstein in 1889 to distinguish more rapidly refractory and fatal leukemias from more indolent chronic leukemias.
