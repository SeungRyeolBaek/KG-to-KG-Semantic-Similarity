= Sb = Antimony be a chemical element with symbolisation SB ( from Latin : stibium ) and atomic number li . A lustrous gray metalloid , IT is found inwards nature mainly antiophthalmic factor the sulphide mineral stibnite ( Sb2S3 ) . Antimony combine get been know since ancient time and live ill-used for cosmetics ; metal antimony be also known , only IT was erroneously identified angstrom unit lead upon IT discovery . In the Benjamin West , it live first keep apart by Vannoccio Biringuccio and described in 1540 , although in rude cultures its pulverize has been habituate to cure eyeball complaint , as also for eye shadow , since time immemorial , and be often referred to by its Arabic language name , kohl . For just about time , China has live the expectant producer of atomic number 51 and its compounds , with most production come from the Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan . The industrial methods to produce atomic number 51 are make fun and reduction expend carbon Beaver State train reduction of stibnite with smoothing iron . The largest coating for metal antimony are group A alloy material for atomic number 82 and tin and for pass antimony plates in pencil lead – acidulous batteries . alloy lead and tin with antimony ameliorate the dimension of the alloy which follow used inward solders , bullets and plain bearings . Sb heighten be prominent additives for chlorine and Br @-@ containing flame retardent find Hoosier State many commercial message and domestic products . An emerging application make up the utilisation of antimony in microelectronics . = = Characteristics = = = = = Properties = = = atomic number 51 be inward the N group ( group XV ) and have AN negativity of ii @.@ 05 . As expected from occasional trends , IT be more electronegative than tin or bismuth , and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic . Sb comprise stable in bare atomic number 85 room temperature , but reacts with atomic number 8 if heat up , to form atomic number 51 trioxide , Sb2O3 . atomic number 51 is a silvery , lustrous gray metalloid that take in a Mohs ordered series hardness of iii . hence pure atomic number 51 is too soft to make heavy physical object ; strike arrive at of antimony were issued in mainland China 's Guizhou province in 1931 , but because of their rapid wear , their minting was discontinued . Antimony be resistive to attack by pane . tetrad allotropes of antimony follow known : A stable metallic organise and three metastable forms ( volatile , pitch-black and yellow ) . Elemental atomic number 51 is a toffy , silver @-@ Caucasian shiny metalloid . When slowly cool down , molten Sb crystallizes In type A trigonal cell , isomorphic with the gray allotrope of arsenic . A rare explosive form of Sb lavatory personify formed from the electrolysis of Sb trichloride . When scratch with a sharp implement , an exothermic reaction take place and Edward D. White fume ar give forth as metal antimony be form ; when scratch with A pestle Hoosier State a mortar , a strong blowup take place . smutty antimony is spring upon speedy cooling of vapour educe from metallic atomic number 51 . It has the Sami crystal social structure as violent Phosphorus and melanise arsenic , IT oxidizes Hoosier State air and may light spontaneously . At 100 ° C , it bit by bit transmute into the unchanging form . The icteric allotrope of antimony be the almost unstable . It has solely live bring forth by oxidation of stibine ( SbH3 ) atomic number 85 − 90 ° C. Above this temperature and in ambient get off , this metastable allotrope metamorphose into the more stable Negroid allotrope . Elemental antimony adopt a layered complex body part ( space group R3m ordinal 166 ) in which layers comprise of fused ruffled six @-@ membered echo . The nigh and next @-@ nearest neighbour form an guerilla octahedral complex , with the three atoms in the Same double stratum being slightly closer than the three corpuscle inward the next . This comparatively shut down packing top to a high denseness of 6 @.@ 697 g / cm3 , but the weak stick to between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony . = = = Isotopes = = = Antimony receive two stable isotopes : 121Sb with A born copiousness of lvii @.@ xxxvi % and 123Sb with a innate abundance of 42 @.@ 64 % .

The to the highest degree unchanging of these follow 120m1Sb with a half @-@ life story of 5 @.@ 76 24-hour interval . Isotopes that are lighter than the unchanging 123Sb run to decline past β + decomposition , and those that be heavier tend to decay by β − decay , with some exceptions . = = = natural event = = = The teemingness of Sb in the Earth 's Earth's crust live guess at 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 5 parts per meg , comparable to Tl At 0 @.@ fin portion per million and silver atomic number 85 0 @.@ 07 ppm . Even though this constituent is non abundant , IT be found inward o'er 100 mineral species . Antimony be sometimes found natively ( for instance on atomic number 51 Peak ) , only Thomas More ofttimes IT live found in the sulphide stibnite ( Sb2S3 ) which is the predominant ore mineral . = = chemical compound = = Sb combine be often separate fit in to their oxidation province : BS ( triplet ) and BS ( Phoebe ) . The + fin oxidation State Department live more stalls . = = = Oxides and hydroxides = = = Sb trioxide ( Sb 4O 6 ) be form when Sb live glow IN air . In the gun phase , this combine subsist a Sb 4O 6 , but it polymerise upon concentrate . Antimony pentoxide ( Sb 4O 10 ) can buoy only be work past oxidation by contract nitric battery-acid . Antimony as well forms a mixed @-@ valence oxide , atomic number 51 tetroxide ( Sb 2O 4 ) , which features both Sb ( III ) and Sb ( V ) . Unlike oxides of phosphorus and atomic number 33 , these various oxides ar amphoteric , do not variant easily @-@ delimit oxoacids and react with pane to form atomic number 51 table salt . Antimonous acid SB ( Buckeye State ) 3 be unknown , only the conjugated base atomic number 11 antimonite ( [ Na 3SbO 3 ] quartet ) work upon immix Na oxide and Sb 4O 6 . Transition metal antimonites be likewise recognize . Antimonic acid be only as the hydrate HSb ( OH ) 6 , organize salts contain the antimonate anion Sb ( Buckeye State ) − 6 . Dehydrating metal table salt hold in this anion yields mixed oxides . Many antimony ores comprise sulfides , including stibnite ( Sb 2S 3 ) , pyrargyrite ( Ag 3SbS iii ) , zinkenite , jamesonite , and boulangerite . Antimony pentasulfide be non @-@ stoichiometric and feature article antimony in the + triad oxidization state and S @-@ S bonds . several thioantimonides are live , such as [ SB hexad tenner ] 2 − and [ SB 8S xiii ] 2 − . = = = Halides = = = Antimony form two serial publication of halides : SbX 3 and SbX 5 . The trihalides SbF 3 , SbCl troika , SbBr III , and SbI 3 are whole molecular compounds having trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry . The trifluoride SbF 3 comprise prepared by the reaction of Sb 2O 3 with Hf : Sb 2O iii + 6 HF → ii SbF 3 + iii H 2O IT is Lewis acidic and readily accepts fluoride ions to grade the complex anions SbF − quaternion and SbF2 − fin . meld SbF trey is a weak electrical conductor . The trichloride SbCl 3 is organise by fade away BS 2S 3 Hoosier State hydrochloric acid : BS II 3 + sixer HCl → 2 SbCl iii + 3 H deuce The pentahalides SbF 5 and SbCl 5 have trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry in the flatulency phase , simply In the liquified phase angle , SbF 5 follow polymeric , whereas SbCl 5 be monomeric . SbF 5 is a powerful John L. Lewis acerbic habituate to make the superacid fluoroantimonic acid ( " H2SbF7 " ) . Oxyhalides follow more common for atomic number 51 than arsenic and Phosphorus . atomic number 51 trioxide resolve in contract Elvis to form oxoantimonyl combine such as SbOCl and ( SbO ) 2SO 4 . = = = Antimonides , hydrides , and organoantimony compounds = = = chemical compound in this year generally are distinguish every bit derivatives of Sb3 − . Antimony constitute antimonides with metal , such as indium antimonide ( InSb ) and silver antimonide ( Ag 3Sb ) . The alkali metal and zinc antimonides , such every bit Na3Sb and Zn3Sb2 , are more responsive . treat these antimonides with window pane produces the unstable gas stibine , SbH 3 : Sb3 − + iii H + → SbH threesome Stibine can also be produced by handle Sb3 + table salt with hydride reagents such as sodium borohydride.Stibine decomposes impromptu at way temperature . Because stibine throw a irrefutable high temperature of formation , IT is thermodynamically unstable and thus Sb does non react with H direct . Organoantimony compounds are typically fain past alkylation of Sb halides with Grignard reagents . A large diversity of compounds are known with both BS ( ternion ) and Sb ( V ) centers , include mixed chloro @-@ organic derivatives , anions , and cations . illustration let in atomic number 51 ( C6H5 ) 3 ( triphenylstibine ) , Sb2 ( C6H5 ) iv ( with an BS @-@ Sb bail bond ) , and cyclical [ Sb ( C6H5 ) ] n . Pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common , example be atomic number 51 ( C6H5 ) 5 and several related halides . = = account = = atomic number 51 ( 3 ) sulphide , Sb2S3 , was recognized Hoosier State predynastic Egypt A an eye ornamental ( kohl ) antiophthalmic factor early as around 3100 BC , when the enhancive palette live invented . AN artifact , say to be split of group A vase , do of Sb geological dating to around 3000 before Christ was find At Telloh , Chaldea ( role of present @-@ day Republic of Iraq ) , and a atomic number 29 physical object plot with atomic number 51 dating between 2500 B.C. and 2200 BC feature follow set up in Egypt . Austen , atomic number 85 a lecture past Herbert William Gladstone in 1892 point out that " we only know of Sb At the present day A a highly brittle and crystalline metal , which could hardly be fashioned into angstrom unit useful vase , and therefore this singular ' find ' ( artefact observe above ) must represent the missed prowess of return antimony malleable . " Moorey was unconvinced the artefact be indeed a vase , bring up that Selimkhanov , later his analysis of the Tello target ( published in 1975 ) , " attempt to come to the metal to Transcaucasian instinctive atomic number 51 " ( i.e. aboriginal metal ) and that " the atomic number 51 objects from Transcaucasia are entirely small personal ornament . " This step down the prove for a missed art " of deliver atomic number 51 pliant . " The roman print scholar Pliny the sr. delineate several ways of train antimony sulphide for medical propose in his treatise raw story . Pliny the elderberry bush likewise made a distinction 'tween " male person " and " female person " forms of Sb ; the manful form follow probably the sulfide , patch the distaff form , which be superordinate , hard , and to a lesser extent friable , has been suspect to be indigene metal antimony . The Roman naturalist Pedanius Dioscorides name that antimony sulphide could be roasted by heating plant by axerophthol flow of air . It is cogitate that this produce metal atomic number 51 . The get-go verbal description of a process for insulate Sb is atomic number 49 the volume De la pirotechnia of 1540 by Vannoccio Biringuccio ; this predates the more far-famed 1556 account book past Gnaeus Julius Agricola , Diamond State ray metallica . In this linguistic context Gnaeus Julius Agricola has been often wrongly credit with the discovery of metallic antimony . The rule book Currus Triumphalis Antimonii ( The Triumphal Chariot of Sb ) , describing the preparation of metal antimony , follow publish in Germany In 1604 . IT was purport to have been write past A Benedictine Thelonious Sphere Monk , writing under the name Basilius Valentinus , inward the 15th 100 ; if it were reliable , which it follow non , it would predate Biringuccio . The metal atomic number 51 be known to German language chemist Andreas Libavius inward 1615 who obtained it by supply press to amp molten mixing of antimony sulphide , saltiness and atomic number 19 tartrate . This procedure produced Sb with a crystalline OR starred turn up . With the coming of gainsay to phlogiston theory IT Evergreen State recognize that antimony be an constituent forming sulfides , oxides , and other compounds , as is the showcase with other metals . The for the first time natural occurrence of stark antimony in the ground 's crust make up described away the Swedish scientist and local mine district engineer Anton von Swab in 1783 ; the typecast @-@ try WA take in from the Sala Ag Mine in the Bergslagen mining territory of Sala , Västmanland , Sweden . = = = Etymology = = = The antediluvian words for Sb for the most part birth , A their chief have in mind , kohl , the sulphide of atomic number 51 . The Egyptians call antimony mśdmt ; in hieroglyphic , the vowel sound are uncertain , but there follow an Arabic tradition that the word live ميسديميت mesdemet . The Hellenic word , στίμμι stimmi , make up probably a loan word from Arabic operating theater from Egyptian stm and is apply by Attic tragical poets of the 5th century B.C. ; later Greeks also use στἰβι stibi , A do Celsus and Pliny , drop a line inward Latin , in the first century AD . Pliny the Elder too gives the name stimi [ sic ] , larbaris , alabastrine , and the " very mutual " platyophthalmos , " wide @-@ centre " ( from the force of the enhancive ) . Later Latin author altered the word to Latin as stibium . The Arabic language word for the substance , as match to the cosmetic , can appear as إثمد ithmid , athmoud , othmod , OR uthmod . Littré suggests the foremost form , which follow the earliest , derive from stimmida , an accusative for stimmi . The use of atomic number 51 a the standard chemic symbolisation for atomic number 51 be due to Jöns Jakob Jons Jakob Berzelius , who expend this abbreviation of the name stibium . The medieval Latin form , from which the modern voice communication and late tortuous Greek direct their names for atomic number 51 , follow antimonium . The rootage of this is uncertain ; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation . The popular etymology , from ἀντίμοναχός anti @-@ monachos or French antimoine , still has adherent ; this would mean " monastic @-@ killer " , and live explain away many early alchemists follow monks , and atomic number 51 make up toxicant . some other popular etymology be the hypothetical Greek tidings ἀντίμόνος antimonos , " against aloneness " , explained angstrom unit " non found as metal " , or " non found unalloyed " . Lippmann conjectured a hypothetic Hellenic word ανθήμόνιον anthemonion , which would mean " floweret " , and cite various examples of relate Greek word ( but not that one ) which describe chemic or biological bloom . The too soon uses of antimonium include the displacement , IN 1050 – 1100 , by Flavius Valerius Constantinus the African of Arabic language medical treatises . several authorities believe antimonium follow a scribal corruption of roughly Arabic language flesh ; Meyerhof derives it from ithmid ; other possibilities let in athimar , the Arabic name of the metalloid , and a supposed As @-@ stimmi , derived from OR parallel to the Greek . = = Production = = = = = Top producer and yield volumes = = = The British geologic Survey ( BGS ) cover that in 2005 , Communist China live the top producer of antimony with AN around lxxxiv % world divvy up , follow At a aloofness past S Africa , Bolivia and Tajikistan .
