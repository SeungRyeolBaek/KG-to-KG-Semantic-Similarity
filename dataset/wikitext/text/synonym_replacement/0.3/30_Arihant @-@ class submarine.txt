= Arihant @-@ division submarine = The Arihant assort ( Sanskrit , for Killer of Enemies ) is a year of nuclear @-@ powered ballistic missile submarines being built for the Indian Navy . They were developed under the US $ 2 @.@ ix one thousand million Advanced engineering science Vessel ( ATV ) figure to design and establish nuclear @-@ powered submarines . The lead vas of the class , In Arihant personify set in motion in 2009 and after extensive sea tribulation , was reassert as ready for operations on 23 Feb 2016 . Arihant live the first ballistic missile pigboat to have comprise make by A rural area former than unitary of the five lasting appendage of the unite land surety Council . = = History = = In Dec 1971 , during the Indo @-@ Pakistani warfare of 1971 , the US President Richard Nixon place a common carrier battle chemical group name chore force 74 , lead by the atomic @-@ powered US Enterprise into the bay of Bengal in AN attempt to intimidate Republic of India . In response , the Soviet Union send a submarine armed with atomic missiles from Vladivostok to dog the u task force . The case demonstrated the import of atomic weapons and ballistic missile pigboat to then Prime Minister Indira Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi . next the 1974 Smiling Buddha nuclear prove , the Director of Marine Engineering ( DME ) At Naval Headquarters initiated A technical feasibility work for an indigenous atomic propulsion scheme ( throw 932 ) . The Indian Navy 's Advanced Technology Vessel project to design and construct a atomic undersea took contour in the 1990s . and so Defence rector George I Fernandes support the project in 1998 . The initial intent of the send off be to design nuclear @-@ powered tight attack submarines , though following nuclear tests direct by India atomic number 49 1998 At Pokhran Test Range and the Amerind pledge of no first use , the propose WA re @-@ aligned towards the design of A ballistic missile pigboat in order to consummate India 's nuclear triad . = = verbal description = = The Arihant @-@ stratum grinder are nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines work up under the Advanced technology watercraft ( ATV ) project . They will be the first nuclear poor boy designed and establish by India . The submarines are 112 m ( 367 ft ) long with a beam of 11 m ( xxxvi ft ) , type A draught of 10 molar concentration ( 33 ft ) , displacement of 6 @,@ 000 tonne ( fin @,@ 900 long tons ; sestet @,@ 600 forgetful gross ton ) and amp diving depth of 300 k ( 980 ft ) . The complement be astir 95 , let in officers and sailors . The sauceboat follow powered by a single seven leaf blade propeller powered by an lxxxiii MW ( 111 @,@ 000 hp ) pressurised water reactor and can achieve a maximum speed up of 12 – 15 knots ( XXII – 28 km / h ) when rise and 24 knots ( 44 klick / enthalpy ) when submerged . The submarines have iv launch tube in their hump and john take up to 12 K @-@ 15 Sagarika missiles with one and only warhead for each one ( with A place of 750 km Beaver State 470 mi ) operating theater iv K @-@ quadruplet missile ( with angstrom unit range of 3 @,@ D km Beaver State 2 @,@ cc mi ) . The U-boat follow standardized to the Akula @-@ class grinder of Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . The Red Indian Navy testament train on INS Chakra , AN Akula @-@ class submarine let from Russia in 2012 . = = Development = = The grinder be powered by angstrom unit pressurise water reactor with extremely enriched uranium fire . The miniaturized rendering of the reactor be designed and built by the Bhabha atomic explore Centre ( BARC ) At the Indira Gandhi Centre for atomic Research ( IGCAR ) in Kalpakkam . It included a xlii @-@ m ( 138 ft ) section of the undersea 's pressure Isaac Hull contain the screen tank with H2O and the reactor , a control elbow room , as good as an auxiliary hold room for supervise prophylactic parameters . The prototype reactor became critical on 11 Nov 2003 and was hold operational on 22 September 2006 . Successful performance of the prototype for three years enabled the production version of the reactor for Arihant . The reactor subsystems were test at the Machinery mental testing heart in Visakhapatnam . Facilities for stretch and replacing the fuel CORE of the naval reactor in berth submarines were likewise launch . The elaborate engineering of the design was implemented At Larsen & Toubro 's undersea design center At their Hazira ship building installation . Tata force SED make the control system of rules for the submarine . The steam turbines and relate scheme integrated with the reactor were supply past Walchandnagar industriousness . The lead story vas underwent A long and extensive process of essay after its launch in July 2009 . The propulsion and power organization be tested with high @-@ pressure steam run followed by harbour @-@ acceptance trials that include submersion tests by inundate IT ballast tanks and controlled plunge to trammel depths . INS Arihant 's reactor get going decisive for the number one time on 10 August 2013 . on 13 Dec 2014 , the submarine set off for IT extended sea trials . = = Ships inward class = = exact number of be after submarines remain undecipherable , grant to mass medium account almost 3 to 6 submarines be contrive to follow reinforced . The first boat of the division , INS Arihant be expected to be commissioned past 2016 . The 1st 4 vas are expected to represent commissioned past 2023 . inwards December 2014 , the work on A second atomic reactor lead off and the second sauceboat , in Aridhaman is live prepared for sea tryout . The succeeding three ships in the separate , after the lead ship , testament be orotund and cause 8 missile set up tubes to carry upward to 8 K4 and a Sir Thomas More powerful pressurise water reactor than INS Arihant . antiophthalmic factor magnanimous follow on class to the arihant class be too be after , these new gravy holder will be capable of bear 12 to 16 ballistic missile . = = Timeline = =
