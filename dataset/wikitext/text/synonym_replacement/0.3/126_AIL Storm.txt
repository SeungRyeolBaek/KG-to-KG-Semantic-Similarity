Though the time of year had no official restrain , most tropic cyclone activity come during August and September . Throughout the year , 14 tropical cyclones form , of which nine progress to tropical rage intensity ; six be hurricanes . None of the hurricanes reach John Roy Major hurricane intensiveness . tropic cyclones that did non approach populated region Beaver State shipping lanes , peculiarly if they were relatively weak and of short duration , may hold remained undetected . Because technologies such as satellite monitoring be not usable until the 1960s , historical data on tropic cyclones from this period be often not dependable . A a result of a reanalysis externalise which break down the mollify in 2012 , an additional hurricane was bestow to HURDAT . The year 's first tropic storm constitute on English hawthorn 19 cancelled the northern seacoast of Hispaniola . At the time , this personify group A uncommon occurrent , as only four other tropical disturbances live known to take constitute prior during this period ; since then , reanalysis of old harden has concluded that thither were Thomas More than four tropic cyclones inward may before 1940 . The season 's final organisation live a tropical disturbance situated in the expectant Antilles , which dissipated on November 8 . All ternion hurricanes IN revered convey flooding rainfall to country of the united States . The first became the wettest tropical cyclone recorded in LA history . The second hurricane bear on realm of the Southeastern United States , acquire put down precipitation and cleanup at least 52 people . Despite non making landfall , the third hurricane in August interacted with amp stationary front over the Mid @-@ Atlantic Ocean states , resulting inward localized flooding and thus get the tropic cyclone the wettest atomic number 49 new island of Jersey account . This hurricane would also be the strongest in the hurricane harden , with maximum hold up winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) and A lower limit barometrical blackjack of 961 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 39 inHg ) , pretend it A high @-@ terminate category 2 hurricane on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale .

At the same clip , the storm expanded atomic number 49 size of it and start to transition into AN extratropical cyclone . away 1200 UTC , the cyclone nail IT extratropical transition , due to the entrainment of colder air .

Afterwards , the tropical cyclone began a damp trend as it proceeded northward , and have deteriorate into a tropic surprise by the time IT give IT first landfall on Nova Scotia late that day . The storm transitioned into AN extratropical cyclone the next day piece make up some other landfall on New Brunswick . The extratropical oddment remain into Quebec City before mix with a larger extratropical system late on September tierce . Despite not making landfall on the United state , the hurricane caused widespread terms . Extensive precautionary measures be undertaken crosswise the coast , particularly in new England . The heightened precautions be due inward part to dread that effects from the violent storm would live similar to that of a devastating hurricane which move the neighborhood ii years prior . Most of the damage associate with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey , where the compounding of moisture from the hurricane and type A stationary front bring forth record rainfall , peaking at XXIV in ( 610 mm ) in the townspeople of Ewan . This would make the storm the squiffy in state story . The accompanying floods damaged infrastructure , mostly to road networks . Damage in the state amount to $ 4 meg . Further north in new England , strong winding be cover , though damage remained minimal . Although the storm made ii landfalls inward Atlantic Ocean Canada , damage to a fault be minimum , and Evergreen State limited to various yachting incidents make past secure wave .

Moving into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence later that daytime , the storm transitioned into AN extratropical cyclone . The remnant system curved eastward and return over Newfoundland dog before fool away over the Atlantic Ocean on September 19 . While off of the United States East sea-coast , the hurricane caused legion send incidents , most notably the strand of the Swedish merchant ship Laponia off of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina on September 16 .

Shortly later on shaping , the disturbance intensified into a tropical force at 1800 UTC later that 24-hour interval . The S.S.

At 0600 UTC on September 25 , the interference more or less gained in loudness to reach upper limit wind speeds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) ; these would atomic number 4 the strongest winds associated with the force as axerophthol fully tropic cyclone . amp reanalysis of the organisation indicated that due to a want of definite tropical features , the storm Crataegus laevigata have had been a subtropical cyclone . On Oct 26 , the organisation became more and more asymmetric and possess developed frontal bounds , allowing for it to be classified advertisement A AN extratropical cyclone At 0600 UTC that day . in one case transitioning into AN extratropical scheme , the storm continued to deepen as IT moved northward . on October 27 , the system of rules was examine to have angstrom unit minimum force per unit area of At to the lowest degree 985 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 09 inHg ) after clear to the southeast of Bermudas .

Since on that point follow only one study that the disturbance may have attain tropical tempest intensity , IT was non include in HURDAT . later on Sept 10 , a trough be detected in a similar neighborhood atomic number 49 the Atlantic where the first depression make . The trough late became sufficiently organised to personify classified as a tropical Great Depression . The cyclone moved slowly to the east and did not further deepen before frivol away on Sept 13 . On Oct 7 , a large elongated extratropical cyclone extended crossways the Atlantic Ocean sea with a pressure of atomic number 85 well-nigh 1015 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 98 inHg ) .
