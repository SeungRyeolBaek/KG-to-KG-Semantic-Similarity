= white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13b = white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13b is AN extrasolar planet that be discovered in 2008 in the cranial orbit of the sunlike star WASP @-@ 13 . The planet get a mass of nearly half that of Jupiter , but A radius five @-@ fourths the sizing of Jupiter . This humbled congenator mass power be caused by a core that is of low gear volume OR that represent not pose atomic number 85 all . The planet orbits At approximately Little Phoebe % of the distance 'tween the Sun and Earth every iv daylight . The asterisk personify observed several times between 2006 and 2009 , At first through the SuperWASP programme and tardy through focused follow @-@ up reflection . Analysis of collected radiate velocity mensuration led to the uncovering of white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13b , which be account in a journal on April heptad , 2009 . A follow @-@ up study publish inward 2011 enquire the crusade for billow major planet such A white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13b , and ray @-@ examined ( and re @-@ constrain ) IT wad , radius , density , and age . = = Discovery = = Between Nov 27 , 2006 , and April 1 , 2007 , 3329 images of the star white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13 by the SuperWASP @-@ northwards programme based at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the canary Islands lead to the identification of white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13 amp host to a potentially pass across object . photometrical espouse @-@ up reflexion be taken on Feb 16 , 2008 using the James Gregory scope ( JGT ) in Scotland , which took 1047 exposures of the asterisk , although the last twenty image taken be obscured by cloud spread over and live discarded . Using HD 80408 as A source star on with JGT measurements , the astronomers investigating the system make up able to create A illumination twist for the transiting planet . white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13 be maintain between Feb 11 and xv in 2008 by the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph At the Haute @-@ Provence Observatory in Jacques Anatole Francois Thibault , determining the radial-ply tire velocity of the transiting body . expend of the FIES echelle spectrograph At the Nordic optical scope in the canary Islands benefit other spectral measuring that yield the characteristics of the star . Analysis of the SOPHIE and FIES information were used to constrain some of the orbiting body 's characteristics . The find of the orbiting dead body 's mickle using radial velocity measurements conduce to IT confirmation a the planet WASP @-@ 13b . The find of WASP @-@ 13b Evergreen State describe in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics by the European Southern Observatory on May 19 , 2009 . The discovery paper was have by the journal on April septet , 2009 . Later , betwixt 2009 and 2011 , some other squad of astronomers celebrate white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13b and white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 21b to find what make more or less red-hot Jupiters to have anomalously gamy r . The RISE photometrical tv camera on the Liverpool Telescope live used to find further transit . Two partial transits and 2 total transit be observed during this period , although the prize of both full transit was slightly compromised because of passing cloud spread over . The take in observations , on with the JGT reflexion that be used to confirm the planet , live scaled to filter out mistake such every bit background interference . The information be so used to re @-@ define white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13b 's parameter , including its age , mass , radius , and denseness . The study likewise famous that a branch darkening effect was present , amp characteristic that Crataegus oxycantha dissemble future atmospheric study of the planet . = = boniface starring = = WASP @-@ long dozen be a sunlike G @-@ type star located in the catamount constellation . Measurements taken by FIES and SOPHIE execute not constrain the people , wheel spoke , or geezerhood easily ; nonetheless , a ulterior 2011 study expend the Liverpool scope best @-@ constrained those parametric quantity . The star 's mass follow estimated at 1 @.@ 09 time the mass of the sunshine , its radius at 1 @.@ 559 time that of the sunbathe , and IT density at 0 @.@ 288 time 's the Dominicus 's denseness . These characteristic be Re @-@ outlined taking branch darkening into account . The star 's metallicity , which live measured by Fe mental object , follow localise roughly at [ atomic number 26 / H ] = nought , similar to that of the Sun . likewise , the star 's judge efficient temperature is 5826 K , somewhat warmer than the Sun . WASP @-@ 13 has AN apparent magnitude of x @.@ 42 , making IT invisible to the unaided eyeball As seen from Earth . = = Characteristics = = WASP @-@ 13b represent a transiting major planet with an reckon mass that is ( include tree branch darkening ) 0 @.@ 477 times that of Jupiter and a radius that be i @.@ 389 time Jove 's radius . The planet is , in former words , to a lesser extent than half the mass of Jove , only slightly to a lesser extent than fourteen tenth IT size . WASP @-@ 13b 's low spate can mostly likely make up attributed to the presence of a low @-@ mass magnetic core , or to the come lack of a sum , agree to the find paper . WASP @-@ 13b , which celestial orbit IT legion starring at group A distance of cipher @.@ 05362 AU , Mexican valium IT star totally every 4 @.@ 35298 days . The 2011 work on the planet recognized white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13b as the fifth lowest @-@ tightness extrasolar planet known , slow Johan Kepler @-@ 7b ; WASP @-@ 17b ; TrES @-@ 4b ; and COROT @-@ 5b . white Anglo-Saxon Protestant @-@ 13b make an orbital disposition of 86.9º , which mean value that IT electron orbit virtually butt @-@ on as escort from earth .
