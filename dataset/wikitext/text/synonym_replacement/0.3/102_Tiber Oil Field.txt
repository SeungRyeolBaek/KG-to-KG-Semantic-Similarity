= Tiber Oil field = The Tevere Oil playing area be amp deepwater offshore oil field locate in the Keathley canon block 102 of the United state sector of the Gulf of Mexico . The deepwater field ( defined as irrigate depth ace @,@ 300 to quintet @,@ 000 feet ( 400 to unity @,@ 520 molar concentration ) , ) was let out In Sep 2009 and IT is operated by BP . key antiophthalmic factor group A " giant " find , IT be gauge to contain 4 to hexad billion barrels ( 640 × X ^ half-dozen to 950 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) of embrocate Hoosier State place . Although BP province IT follow too too soon to be sure of the size of it – A " huge " field is usually considered to contain 250 billion bbl ( 40 × 10 ^ sise m3 ) . It required the boring of a tenner @,@ 685 G ( 35 @,@ 056 ft ) cryptical comfortably under ace @,@ 260 m ( 4 @,@ 130 ft ) of water , making IT one of the deepest swell ever so drilled at the time of discovery . = = verbal description = = Tiber comprises multiple Lower Tertiary crude source turn up inwards Keathley canon halt 102 around 250 mi ( 400 km ) southeasterly of Samuel Houston and 300 mi ( 480 km ) Dixieland Occident of New siege of Orleans . Tevere personify only the 18th low Tertiary swell to date , and drilling in these shaping be in IT infancy . The oil from Tiber be light crude , and early estimates of recoverable reserve be around 20 – 30 % recovery , intimate figure of around 600 to 900 meg cask ( 95 × 10 ^ 6 to 143 × 10 ^ sextuplet m3 ) of reserves . author such as Bloomberg suggest admonish , warning that the regain live technically complex and potentially could take 5 – half-dozen years to give rise oil or be humiliated yield ( cinque – 15 % ) base on " charge per unit speak nearly " atomic number 85 nearby Kaskida Oil landing field , BP 's old jumbo uncovering ( 2006 ) 40 mi ( 64 km ) aside . The commercial message prospects of the study feature non still be evaluated . = = find = = BP take on the out Continental shelf lease of Keathley Canyon block 102 reference G25782 , NOAA station 42872 , on Oct 22 , 2003 , in Phase 2 of the Western disconnection of Mexico ( WGOM / GOM ) Sale 187 . Lower Tertiary rock formation be just about of the oldest and well-nigh technically dispute offshore rock shaping currently drilled for oil , geological dating to between XXIII and 66 million years agone . The programme of geographic expedition WA filed in June 2008 . Tiber be initially drill past Transocean 's fifth @-@ contemporaries dynamic pose semi @-@ submersible oil rig , Deepwater Horizon , with explorative oil production commencing around March 2009 , more or less delayed from the plotted escort of September 2008 . practically of the deeper gulf set aside ar eat up under salt accumulations thousands of feet thick , which present A problem for seismic geographic expedition . BP feature antecedently developed exploration technique to bypass this difficulty . Oil personify located At " multiple spirit level " . The area was denote on Sept 2 , 2009 , and BP shares rose 3 @.@ 7 pct on the news . With Tiber joining at least decade former successful get down tertiary geographic expedition atomic number 49 the area , psychoanalyst viewed the declaration as a sign for optimism , and a precursor of renew interest group in , and production from , the offshore Gulf of United Mexican States . = = Exploration on hold = = Following the Apr 2010 destruction of the Deepwater apparent horizon while drilling the Macondo fountainhead , and the resulting oil release , completely appraisal activities atomic number 85 xxxiii Herbert George Wells under geographic expedition in the Gulf of Mexico , including Tevere , were placed on hold . At to the lowest degree 2 semi that power otherwise have make up expend for developing Tiber are also In use on the relief wellspring for the snap swell .
