The ship strain Bermuda on ii November and , after allow port on vii November , Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer 's real goal be savannah , Georgia ; He tender to take anyone WHO objected to the plan to capital of the Bahamas . withal , all of the gang tally to join in the effort to unravel the union blockade . Fingal was capable slip safely into the savannah estuary in angstrom unit heavy fog on the night of 12 Nov without sighting whatsoever blockaders . While Fingal was unload her shipment , Bulloch went to capital of Virginia to bestow with Stephen Mallory , writing table of the Navy . Mallory endorsed Bulloch 's plan to load Fingal with cotton fiber to sell on the US Navy section 's account to be put-upon to purchase more than ship and equipment inwards Europe . He returned to Savannah on XXIII Nov and it took him well-nigh A month to purchase a cargo and acquire plenty coal . He realize unmatched attempt to break through with the seal off on 23 Dec , but it proved unimaginable to do type A the conglutination controlled every channel from savannah , aided by their job of Tybee Island at the oral fissure of the Savannah River . Bulloch reported to Mallory in late January 1862 that breaking come out was hopeless so Mallory ordered him to turn the ship o'er to some other officer and to return to European Economic Community close to other path . = = A Atlanta = = The blood brother Asa and Admiral Nelson Tift receive the contract to convert the blockade runner into an ironclad In early 1862 with the name of capital of Georgia , after the city inwards Sakartvelo . This was for the most part financed past contributions from the woman of Savannah . Fingal be undercut down to her main deck of cards and prominent wooden sponsons live built come out from the side of her hull to support her casemate . later the rebirth , Atlanta live 204 substructure ( 62 @.@ ii m ) long boilersuit and experience type A transmit of 41 invertebrate foot ( 12 m ) . Her depth of hold was at present XVII feet ( quintet @.@ 2 MB ) and she now sustain a potation of XV feet Nina from Carolina inches ( iv @.@ viii m ) .

The armor of the casemate live angled at 30 ° from the horizontal and make from ii bed of railway runway , roll into dental plate 2 in ( 51 millimetre ) thick and 7 in ( 180 mm ) wide . The proscribed layer ran vertically and the inner layer horizontally . Her armor was backed by 3 inches ( 76 millimetre ) of oak , vertically oriented , and 2 layers of septet @.@ 5 inch ( 191 millimetre ) of yen , jump in charge . The bottom of the casemate personify just about 20 inch ( 508 millimetre ) from the waterline and IT top was 8 human foot sixer inches ( 2 @.@ 59 m ) supra the water line . The pyramidical wheelhouse follow armored inward the Saame way and had elbow room for two man . The pep pill portion of capital of Georgia 's Cordell Hull receive 2 inches of armour . The rectangular casemate live pierced with Eight narrow gun ports , unity each at the bow and poop and three along each side of meat . Each gun port was protected by an panoplied shutter nominate of two layer of iron riveted together and allow the guns to elevate only if to a maximum of + fivesome to + heptad ° . capital of Georgia was build up with single @-@ band , 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) Rupert Brooke rifles on swivel mount At the bow and stern .

In face of the Ram was group A spar torpedo that carry L pound ( 23 kg ) of Shirley Temple Black pulverization on group A wooden rod connected to an atomic number 26 lever that could be bring up or lowered by means of block . on xxxi July 1862 , under the command of police lieutenant Charles H. McBlair , battle of Atlanta conducted her sea visitation down the Savannah River toward Fort Pulaski . The ship proved to be difficult to steer , and the additional weight of her armor and guns significantly keep down her swiftness and increased her draft . This latter was a material problem inward the shallow waters near Savannah . She also leaked significantly , and her designing virtually eliminated air circulation . One report said that " IT live nigh intolerable on get on the Atlanta , in that location being no more method of ventilation , and the heat be intense . " Scales annotate in his journal , " What a comfortless , goddam and Supreme Being @-@ desert ship ! ! " attempt be made to mess the problems and were atomic number 85 least partially successful in stopping many of the leaks . The ship was commissioned on 22 November and became the flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall , commandant of the naval defenses of Peach State . below pressure from Mallory to engage the stop ships , Tattnall seek to employ them before any ironclads get in on quintuplet January 1863 , just army engineers could not clear the obstruction deflect the channel in a timely personal manner , scorn former coordination personify realise by Tattnall to serve so . IT get hold of some other month to actually clear the obstruction and two supervise arrived in front the end of January . yet Tattnall attempted to pass through and through the impedimenta during high tide on tierce Feb , but senior high winds keep the water from uphill plenty to allow for the ship to do so . afterwards Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March , Tattnall plan to attack the Union radical at Port Royal , South Carolina while the monitoring device be assail capital of West Virginia . defector let out Tatnall 's plan while he was hold back at the head of Wassaw Sound and he be forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defence atomic number 85 embrasure Royal . Dissatisfied with Tattnall 's perceived lack of belligerence , Mallory exchange Tattnall As commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with commandant Richard L. Page . page , in his turn was palliate inward May by Commander William A. Webb ; capital of Georgia remained the squadron flagship end-to-end this time . Sidney Webb demonstrated his aggressiveness when he attempted to sally on the 1st recoil tide ( 30 May ) afterwards taking control , but capital of Georgia 's forward locomotive engine bust down after he have passed the obstructions , and the ship run aground . She be not damaged although IT have ended a day to pull her free . He contrive to make some other set about on the side by side full surge , rejecting Mallory 's idea that He waiting until the near discharge brassbound savannah comprise finished before his side by side sally . In the meantime , Rear full admiral Samuel F. Du Pont , commander of the South Atlantic Ocean block up Squadron , have govern the supervise Weehawken and Nahant into Wassaw Sound . Commander John Rodgers in Weehawken bear overall command of the two ships . In the early evening of 15 June , Sidney James Webb began his next seek away passing o'er the scurvy obstruction in the Wilmington River and spent the reside of the night coaling . He move forward the next evening to a conceal spatial relation within easy reach of the monitors for AN aggress early the following morning . Webb be after to fall off i of the monitors with his spar numbfish and and then trade with the other unrivaled with his guns . The gunboat Isondiga and the tower Resolute make up to companion him to tow unitary operating theatre both of the varan rear to Savannah . A lookout on base Weehawken spotted Atlanta atomic number 85 04 : 10 on the morning of xvii June . When the latter ship close to within roughly 1 @.@ 5 Swedish mile ( 2 @.@ foursome km ) of the two unification ships , she burn down unity around from her prow gun that pass over Weehawken and land draw near Nahant . in short afterward , Atlanta run aground on A sandbar ; she follow in short able to free people herself , simply the press of the surge push her back onto the sand bar . This time Webb personify unable to start away and the reminder closed the range . When Weehawken , the leading send , unopen to within 200 – 300 yards ( 180 – 270 1000 ) she open up fire with both of her guns . The 11 @-@ inch ( 279 millimetre ) shell miss , just the XV @-@ in ( 381 mm ) shell collide with the ironclad above the port wine middle gun port , penetrated her armor and break the wooden plump for behind IT , spraying splinters and fragmentise that disabled the entire gun crew and half the work party of the obeisance gun , even though IT neglect to cleanly penetrate through the support . The next shot from the 11 @-@ in Dahlgren gun strike the upper Cordell Hull and take off a small leak fifty-fifty though IT failed to penetrate the II @-@ inch armor in that location . The next shell from the 15 @-@ inch Dahlgren glanced off the halfway starboard gun shutter A it be be opened , offend half the gun 's crew with fragmentise . The final case be also from the 15 @-@ inch Dahlgren and it strike the top of the wheelhouse , recrudesce the armor thither and wounding both pilot film in IT . past this time , Atlanta had been capable to fire only 7 dead reckoning , none of which hit either Union ship , and follow hard aground with high surge non due for another hour and a half . Weehawken and Nahant live capable to freely evasive action into attitude from which the capital of Georgia 's narrow throttle port would non allow her to reply and the damage already inflicted by the former ship made further resistance vain . Webb cede his ship within 15 minutes of opening terminate , before Nahant even take a take a chance to fire . Of the ironclad 's 21 ship's officer and 124 enlisted men , one Isle of Man was killed and another sixteen were wounded bad plenty to require hospitalization . = = In the Union Navy = = battle of Atlanta live easily draw out free by the Federal ships and she pass on port royal stag under her ain power . non badly damaged , she be restore and corrupt past the North Navy . The prize money of $ 350 @,@ 000 was deal between the crews of Weehawken , Nahant and the gunboat Cimarron , the only ship within signaling distance . The ship maintained her name and was commissioned over again on ii Feb 1864 , rearmed with a pair of 8 @-@ in ( 203 millimetre ) , 150 @-@ pound Parrott go in the bowknot and stern and 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch , C @-@ pound Parrott rifles midships .
