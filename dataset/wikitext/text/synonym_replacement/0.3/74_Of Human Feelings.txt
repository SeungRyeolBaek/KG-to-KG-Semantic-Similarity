Coleman launch Tacuma 's toy ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to convert . Although Coleman 's possibility ab initio gainsay his knowledge and perception of music , Tacuma come to like the unconventional role each band appendage be yield group A A soloist and melodist : " When we read Ornette 's euphony we possess his notes , but we listen for his musical phrase and set phrase the way he wishing to . 1 tin ingest the same tonal pattern , then , and phrase it similar ace require to , and those notes will square up the word , the musical rhythm , the harmoniousness – altogether of that .
