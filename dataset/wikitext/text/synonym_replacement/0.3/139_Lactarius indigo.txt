= genus Lactarius indigo = genus Lactarius indigo , usually known atomic number 33 the indigo milk chapiter , the indigo ( or blue ) genus Lactarius , Beaver State the blue Milk River mushroom , follow a species of agaric fungus in the family family Russulaceae . A widely circularize metal money , it grows naturally in eastern North America , East Asia , and primal United States of America ; it throw also live reported in southern French Republic . L. indigotin grows on the ground in both deciduous and cone-bearing forests , where IT forms mycorrhizal associations with a broad range of tree . The fruit body color set out from dark blueness in fresh specimens to pale blueness @-@ gray in older I . The Milk River , OR latex , that oozes when the mushroom-shaped cloud tissue paper be cut or broken — a lineament common to all phallus of the Lactarius genus — be likewise indigotin profane , but slowly turns viridity upon exposure to air . The roof has a diameter of quint to 15 cm ( ii to 6 in ) , and the stem is 2 to viii centimetre ( 0 @.@ octet to 3 In ) marvellous and single to 2 @.@ 5 Cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to I @.@ 0 in ) thick . It be an pabulum mushroom , and is sold in rural markets inward China , Republic of Guatemala , and Mexico . = = Taxonomy and nomenclature = = Originally key in 1822 axerophthol Agaricus indigo by American language mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz , the metal money follow later channelize to the genus genus Lactarius in 1838 away the Swede Elias Magnus Fries . German phytologist Otto Kuntze called IT Lactifluus indigo in his 1891 treatise Revisio Generum Plantarum , but the advise gens change was not adopted by others . Hesler and Smith Hoosier State their 1960 work of North American language species of Lactarius defined L. indigotin a the type mintage of subdivision Caerulei , A mathematical group characterized by blue latex and A viscous , depressed cap . In 1979 , they revised their sentiment on the organization of subdivisions in the genus genus Lactarius , and instead place L. indigo in subgenus genus Lactarius base on the color of latex , and the subsequent color interchange remark after exposure to air . atomic number 33 they explain : The gradual development of blue to reddish blue pigmentation as one progress from species to mintage follow an interest phenomenon deserving farther study . The climax is touch in L. indigo plant which is blue throughout . L. genus Chelidonium and IT variety chelidonioides , L. paradoxus , and L. hemicyaneus Crataegus oxycantha be considered group A milepost along the route to L. indigo . The specific epithet indigo is infer from the Latin Logos meaning " indigo blue devil " . IT advert In the English language vernacular let in the " indigo milk cap " , the " indigo genus Lactarius " , the " blue Milk River mushroom cloud " , and the " blue genus Lactarius " . In fundamental Mexico , IT comprise recognize as añil , azul , hongo azul , zuin , and zuine ; it represent also call quexque ( meaning " blue " ) atomic number 49 Veracruz and Puebla de Zaragoza . = = verbal description = = Like many other mushrooms , L. indigo acquire from A tubercle , Beaver State pinhead , that form within the underground mycelium , A mass of filamentlike fungal cubicle call off hyphae that make up the bulk of the organism . under capture environmental term of temperature , humidity , and nutrient availability , the seeable reproductive structures ( fruit personify ) be form . The cap of the fruit body , assess betwixt 5 and 15 cm ( 2 @.@ nought and 5 @.@ 9 in ) in diam , is ab initio convex and later develops a exchange depression ; In age it becomes fifty-fifty more deeply depressed , get somewhat funnel @-@ shaped as the edge of the chapiter lift upward . The margin of the cap is roll inwards when young , but unroll and raise As IT matures . The cap Earth's surface be indigo drear when fresh , but disappearance to A pallid grayish- surgery silvery @-@ blue , sometimes with greenish splodge . IT be oftentimes zonate : score with concentrical billet that variant take turns pale and obscure zones , and the cap English hawthorn have shadow blue spot , especially towards the inch . Young caps be unenviable to the spot . The flesh live pallid to bluish in color , easy turning light-green after live expose to air ; its mouthful personify soft to slightly acrid . The flesh of the intact mushroom-shaped cloud is toffee , and the stem , if bent sufficiently , will snap clear cleanly . The rubber-base paint exuded from injured tissue personify indigo blueness , and sully the wounded tissue dark-green ; like the flesh , the latex possess angstrom unit mild gustatory sensation . Lactarius indigo comprise mark for non producing axerophthol a great deal latex as other Lactarius species , and older specimens inwards particular Crataegus laevigata be too dehydrated out to create any rubber-base paint . The gills of the mushroom straddle from adnate ( squarely attach to the stem ) to somewhat decurrent ( running down the length of the stem ) , and crowd close together . Their colour be an indigo blue , turn pallid with maturate surgery staining William Green with damage . The stem is ii – 6 cm ( 0 @.@ octad – 2 @.@ 4 in ) tall by ane – II @.@ fivesome atomic number 96 ( cipher @.@ 4 – i @.@ 0 in ) thick , and the same diam throughout or sometimes nail down at base of operations . IT vividness live indigo blue to silvery- Beaver State grayish blue . The interior of the theme personify self-coloured and firm ab initio , but develops a hollow with years . same the cap , it is ab initio sticky OR slimy to the touch when Loretta Young , just soon dries out . IT attachment to the chapiter is usually In group A key position , although IT may also comprise off @-@ centre . Fruit consistence of L. Indigofera tinctoria stimulate no distinguishable odor . L. indigo var. diminutivus ( the " littler indigo Milk River crest " ) is a small strain of the mushroom cloud , with a chapiter diameter betwixt threesome and VII cm ( i @.@ 2 and 2 @.@ 8 in ) , and antiophthalmic factor halt 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 0 cm ( 0 @.@ half-dozen – 1 @.@ 6 In ) long and 0 @.@ tercet – 1 @.@ cipher cm ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ iv in ) thick . It be oft see in Virginia . Hesler and Julia Evelina Smith , who first depict the variant based on specimens found in Brazoria County , Texas , describe its typical home ground as " on [ the ] side of a muddy ditch under grasses and widow's weeds , [ with ] loblolly true pine nearby " . = = = microscopical features = = = When viewed in muckle , as in axerophthol spore print , the spores appear cream to sensationalistic colored . consider with a twinkle microscope , the spores be translucent ( hyaloid ) , prolate to nearly spherical in shape , with amyloid verruca , and have dimensions of 7 – 9 by 5 @.@ 5 – heptad @.@ 5 µm . Scanning negatron microscopy reveals reticulations on the spore Earth's surface . The hymenium is the spore @-@ producing tissue bed of the fruit body , and comprise of hyphae that lead into the lamella and terminate as end cells . various cell types can be maintain atomic number 49 the hymenium , and the cadre get microscopical characteristic that may be used to aid identify OR distinguish mintage in case where the macroscopical characters Crataegus oxycantha make up ambiguous .

Although the blue discolouration of L. indigo be suppose to be rare in the genus Lactarius , Hoosier State 2007 five new species were cover from Peninsular Malaysia with bluing latex operating theater flesh , including L. cyanescens , L. lazulinus , L. genus Mirabilis , and ii species yet unnamed . = = edibleness = = Although L. indigotin be A fountainhead @-@ known edible species , opinions depart on IT desirableness . For example , American mycologist St. David Arora look at it a " superior edible " , while group A playing area guide on Kansas kingdom Fungi value it as " mediocre in quality " . IT may take in amp slightly bitter , operating theater peppery sense of taste , and let a coarse , grainy texture . The firm build follow best groom away cutting the mushroom cloud inwards lean fade . The blue colouration disappear with cooking , and the mushroom-shaped cloud becomes gray . Because of the granular grain of the flesh , it Energy not contribute itself swell to dry out . Specimens raise copious amount of milk Crataegus oxycantha be utilize to add color to marinate . In United Mexican States , individuals harvest the wild mushrooms for sales event at sodbuster ' markets , typically from June to Nov ; they are considered a " second division " metal money for consumption . L. Indigofera tinctoria is as well sell in Guatemalan markets from May to October .

Mycologist St. David Arora notes that Hoosier State the United state , the species be found with bull pine pine atomic number 49 Arizona , just be remove in Calif. 's ponderosa pine forests . IT have also be collected from China , India , Republic of Guatemala , and costa Rica ( inwards forests prevail by oak tree ) . IN EC , it have so far only been institute atomic number 49 southern France . A study on the seasonal appearance of fruiting dead body inward the subtropic forests of Xalapa , United Mexican States , reassert that maximum production coincided with the rainy flavour betwixt June and Sep . L. indigo is angstrom unit mycorrhizal fungus , and as such , establishes A mutualistic human relationship with the root of certain tree diagram ( " boniface " ) , IN which the fungi telephone exchange minerals and amino group acids elicit from the soil for set carbon from the host . The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow amp sheath of tissue around the rootlets of a unsubtle range of Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree species , forge so @-@ called ectomycorrhizae — an knowledgeable association that is especially good to the legion , as the fungus develop enzymes that mineralize organic fertilizer combine and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree diagram . shine their penny-pinching human relationship with trees , the fruit eubstance of L. indigo ar typically regain raise on the ground , break up operating theatre in groups , IN both deciduous and coniferous forests .
