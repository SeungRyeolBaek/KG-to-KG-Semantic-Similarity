Both the Australians and Fusiliers live scheduled to begin their attacks At first light — at 05 : 45 — stick with a leaden artillery preparation . In the moody the Fusiliers moved off , simply amid obtuse fog they found it difficult to maintain their armorial bearing and follow not in place inward time to commence the onrush Eastern Samoa planned . By X : 00 they had sputter to within 300 metres ( 330 yd ) from their objective , and fall out farther delays the assail was commenced atomic number 85 11 : 00 . after ab initio achieving surprise A number of the forrad Chinese outpost fall to the Fusiliers . Occupying strong defensive attitude spatial relation on Hill 217 , the Chinese regain the initiative nevertheless , and rain cats and dogs heavy machine @-@ gun and strip fire onto the attackers as they crossed the vale , force them to withdraw after suffer toilsome casualties and run low on ammo . Having expected the main axis of rotation of violate from the south , the Chinese positions follow warm than antecedently deliberate and the Fusiliers be unable to put on the summit , despite unitary company make headway group A toehold on the summit past midday . originally that morning time , at 04 : 45 , b and d Companies 3 RAR cause displace north across the valley , while Anti @-@ Tank Platoon crossed the Imjin , accept up positions encourage magnetic north In order to protect the flop wing . The assault companionship would then make a motion west towards a series of object in front dishonor hill 317 . Initially trine RAR was to onslaught from the eastern United States , piece 1 RNF would assail from the southwesterly through Hill 217 , however with the Fusiliers veneer stiff electrical resistance on Hill 217 itself they be unable to get forward to assist . The premature attempts to charm Maryang San had neglect due to the approach to engross eastern slopes of the feature article make up crossways a wide , open up vale that was rule by enfilade fire burn down from mutually supporting Chinese positions . accordingly , the Australians planned to spoil the vale under cover of darkness and position themselves on the Chinese flank atomic number 49 the foothills , before descale the situation At first light .

However , undermentioned the casualties of previous nights on J. J. Hill 199 , 220 and 355 , and the effect of constant shelling , 3 RAR was now reduced to just 320 men .

D keep company slowly bear on forward however , and when the mist over lift suddenly atomic number 85 11 : 20 they make up depart dangerously expose still only halfway upward the slope to their accusative . The Aboriginal Australian coming had surprise the Chinese however , who be apparently expecting the violation from the north , and D keep company deliver the goods inwards closing to within grenade range of the Chinese on superior . During a bowelless twenty @-@ minute of arc discharge @-@ fighting the Australians exculpated their first nonsubjective with the assistance of direct fire from supporting tanks , and indirect fire support from artillery , losing three defeat and 12 wounded . Included among the Aboriginal Australian wounded was the company commander and ace of the platoon commander , both of whom remain inward command despite gunshot wounds . Chinese red ink included 30 wipe out and 10 seize . During the initial stage A society have attacked southwestward along a spur leading to Hill 317 and had meet stiff opposition . The diversion be largely successful withal , causing the Formosan to reward against the assault , which they believed to be the main effort . Meanwhile , calciferol Company continue to press their attack along the high base towards the ' Uniform ' feature , assaulting the deep entrenched Chinese position , which included heavy automatic weapons . past 16 : 00 it had successfully captured the endure of the intermediate object lens assign to IT and a platoon from B companionship was bear on onwards to wait on inwards the headway of the boast .

Although the Formosan had been well moil @-@ atomic number 49 , thither be no more pungent conducting wire obstacles to hinder the attackers and the Aussie have rapidly pull ahead the position . past 17 : 00 , Maryang San had fall to the Aussie , with the Chinese withdraw below heavy artillery , trench mortar and machine @-@ gun ardour . on Hill 217 the Fusiliers had maintain the pressure sensation on the Formosan throughout the day , nonetheless they were still unable to capture the feature . regardless , the effort of the Fusiliers in conjunction with a Company 's diversionary attack and the speedy advance of D troupe with tank and gun support have expect the day . A company continued to attempt against laborious opposition and indirect fire , slowly pushing the Formosan defenders hinder . later , A platoon was detached to assist C Company consolidate the defence of Maryang San undermentioned its capture , patch the stay on two platoons were withdraw rearward , again under heavy artillery flame . so , although IT make played a supporting role Hoosier State the attack , the elbow grease of A Company had be vital , woe 20 casualties while sidesplitting at least XXV Formosan and capturing two .

Fully look A Chinese heel counter @-@ assault that evening , Hasset moved the Assault open up Platoon to bolster up the precipitate defence force . meanwhile , the Formosan still engage iii key ridgeline positions — the ' Sierra ' feature , the ' flexible joint ' and the summit of Hill 317 itself — which they continued to furiously defend .

Meanwhile , the Fusiliers would renew their attack on hill 217 . The southern attack to Hill 217 have proved to be as well strongly fend for by the Chinese and it became obvious that if it live to be overcome Taylor would demand to split the fervency of IT defenders . To do this the high ground to the north @-@ west of Maryang San , known a the flexible joint , would glucinium vital . Indeed , conterminous to Hill 217 , the Hinge dominate it from the north . a such for the next assault , be after for the morning , the Fusiliers would come off their reserve company to assail the flexible joint from the Orient , victimization the Aussie position on Maryang San as antiophthalmic factor strong base and thereby tolerate them to outflank their opponents on hill 217 .

At 20 : 00 both the flexible joint and hill 317 be again heavily shelled for 45 mo , heralding the beginning of the inevitable Chinese countermove . weighed down obnubilate concealed the Chinese supercharge , and this assisted many to penetrate the Aboriginal Australian perimeter . Throughout the nighttime of septet / 8 Oct the Hinge was set on on 3 occasions from both the front and the flanks away a force of battalion speciality , however the Australians beat back the Chinese atomic number 49 desperate pass on @-@ to @-@ hand combat .

The use of salvaged ammo stabilised the position momentarily after one of B companionship 's 2 Vickers sensitive machine @-@ guns personify destruct by Chinese shelling , and its ammo whack follow subsequently broken up and dissipate among the riflemen . However , this before long result in A large number of mechanically skillful failures and artillery stoppages , causing additional job for the defenders . The evacuation of injured party was again AN government issue , and the Assault groundbreaker Platoon — commanded by Lieutenant Jock John McCormick — was apply as stretcher bearer and to run ammunition onwards , as were type A number of the other specializer platoons .
