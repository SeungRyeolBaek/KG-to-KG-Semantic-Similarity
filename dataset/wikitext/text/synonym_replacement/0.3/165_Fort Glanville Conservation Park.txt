= fort Glanville preservation Park = fort Glanville preservation parkland is a protected area locate inward the Australian state of S Commonwealth of Australia located in Semaphore Park , A seaboard suburban area of Adelaide consisting of A functional 19th C fort heel on the South Australian heritage Register and close to adjoining land . The fort be build after Sir Thomas More than 40 years of irresolution over the defensive measure of South Australia . It comprise the first compound fortification in the state and be the best preserved and most functional inwards Commonwealth of Australia . fort up Glanville be intentional past Governor John R. Major General Sir William Jervois and police lieutenant Colonel Simon Peter Scratchley , both important figures in early Aboriginal Australian colonial defence reaction . When work up it was designed to represent both Semaphore 's anchorage ground and shipping ingress the Port River from naval attack . building of the fort start in 1878 . It be officially opened in October 1880 and completed by 1882 . referable to changes in the Port River and ship movements , Fort Largs go by it for strategic grandness by 1890 . By the nigh of the 19th one C , the fort be for the most part unused and get no more defensive measure import . IT was briefly used for armed services purpose during earthly concern warfare 1 and World War ii , though non for its master copy defensive role . For much of the 20th century the area follow assign to A diversity of uses include accommodation , A wagon train parking area and A boy scout campsite . later on coming into state government hands in 1951 it be adjudge a A conservation park and is directly managed by the Department of surroundings , weewee and Natural Resources ( DEWNR ) ; keep and showcasing IT historic value . The fort and surrounds fill the northern half of the 5 @-@ hectare ( XII @-@ acre ) conservation park , the southern half be a caravan park . The fort up be axerophthol lunette shaped defensible battery that was supported by ground force for self @-@ defence . When constructed it live encounter as province of the art , incorporating powerful and modern weapons . Its principal armament is two loot muzzle @-@ loading ( RML ) 10 in 20 ton gun stake upward by two RML 64 pounder lxiv long hundredweight shooter , both rare in their particular constellation . The fort retains its original 19th century cannons and three have be restored to working condition . fort Glanville historical Association maneuver the park under license and carry open Clarence Day IN the park , hearten the past operation of the fort let in war machine recitation and the firing of period weapons . The connexion , commons table service , former volunteers and various grants have all help ensure the fort is present in close to original status . IT follow the most complete 19th Century fort in Commonwealth of Australia , and unitary of really few in the earth that remains in original condition . Connecting the fort to Semaphore jetty is the Semaphore and fort Glanville tourer Railway , A 457 mm ( 18 @.@ 0 in ) gauge passenger steam railroad train operated by volunteers from the subject Railway Museum . = = Historic play down = = In the too soon years of colonial Dixieland Commonwealth of Australia , the colonist saw themselves as break of the British people Empire and outside defence as an Imperial obligation . Communication lines live long and the empire 's warfare remote . Great Britain have undisputed armed services predominance and she be require past entirely to protect her settlement , even out one as remote . For local defence , regulator Gawler elevated the first armed services force in 1840 , compose solely of volunteers and known as the South Aussie offer Militia Brigade . It was granted the " Royal " title in 1841 only the brigade receive all but finish to survive a twelvemonth later . The colony obtained its first artillery Hoosier State 1847 with the comer of half dozen field gun of various types . Tensions 'tween United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Russian imperium in the 1850s , as starkly demonstrated past the Crimean warfare , on with Commonwealth of Australia @-@ wide moves towards self @-@ administration cause type A review of the colony 's demurrer posture . The various dependency regarded themselves as possible mark for the Russian Pacific Fleet , then ground In Siberia . In 1854 , regulator Joseph Henry Young charge a commission under Boyle Travers Finniss to report on the defence of the colony , in typesetter's case of state of war . Kay Boyle 's report recommend leaving strategical defence atomic number 49 the manpower of the majestic Navy , though South Commonwealth of Australia was to purchase a cd ton naval vessel . Local defence was to be for the most part handled past the existing little Imperial William Lloyd Garrison and local compound force , supported away the artillery incur in 1847 . When the Crimean warfare ended in 1856 , the danger passed and the perceived need for expensive defense reaction preparations with it . For many years cypher essential came astir from debate on defence of the colony . o'er sentence in that location formed a consensus favor Semaphore for rigid defences Beaver State fortification ; a strategy also argued by the political science plant Hart Commission in 1858 . Raiders comprise see AS unbelievable to force the shallows of the Port River only instead be anticipate to stand off Semaphore , shell the embrasure and enjoyment their guns to financial backing landing place . The Moss Hart Report urge work up of martello towers at Semaphore and Glenelg , the 1st report to urge perm fortification at Semaphore , though none were built in the main due to the cost . The unpaid worker military force live revive Hoosier State 1859 , with new and modern arms for the foot , horse and artillery unit . Though thither be A few years of enthusiasm and amp reconstitute atomic number 49 1866 , by 1870 the force was virtually dissolve . In that year likewise , Brits troops were withdrawn from the other Aboriginal Australian colonies ; none be by and then stationed In South Australia . With no definitive defence insurance policy , Hoosier State 1864 the regime had sought advice from Captain Parkin of hm Falcon and Commodore Sir William Wiseman commander of the Australian station ; both visiting British naval police officer . They both recommended restore munition for the coast affirm by gunboats . Sir Wiseman 's report peculiarly recommend twist of forts at Semaphore , Port creek 's entranceway and one midway between . In 1864 a story circulated , supported past campaign speculation , that in that location be a peril of the Russian fleet attacking Melbourne should Russia and Britain find themselves atomic number 85 war . The South Australian register raise an newspaper column reprobate the state lack of defence . within days Â£ xx @,@ 000 ( axerophthol $ 4 @.@ XIV million in 2005 ) was provide away the government for denial , AN amount then seen as insufficient for significant preparation . The danger clear without whatever lasting defence action except the government 's in @-@ principle acceptation of Sir Wiseman 's passport . To curb costs only the Semaphore fort make up to be built initially , as IT was considered the most critical . site preparation start and deuce 9 @-@ inch ( 230 mm ) gun were purchase , only intensify cost approximation do the plan to Be abandoned by 1868 . During the early 1870s S Commonwealth of Australia 's defence was solely dependent on the volunteer war machine , and a few heavy weapon tack together purchased during earlier state of war scares . British troops have been take back from the Australian settlement in 1870 , leaving the state dependent on IT have armed forces resourcefulness . In a report to the government Hoosier State 1866 , Colonel Freeling and John Major Peter Scratchley urge governing body of angstrom unit permanent war machine thrust . In 1876 the Confederate States of America Aboriginal Australian government , along with those from New South Wales , Queen Victoria and Queensland requested from the War office that John R. Major General Sir William Jervois , A take down coastal fortification expert , be charge to advise on defence of necessity . He get IN Sydney in mid @-@ 1877 with then lieutenant Colonel Scratchley . The 1877 report , deliver after he go South Australian Governor , call for three electric battery , at Largs quest , Semaphore and Glenelg , connected by axerophthol armed services road and supported away field gun emplacements , naval element and roving forces . He determined that South Commonwealth of Australia 's most probable defence jeopardy was AN attack by up to II ship instead than angstrom unit larger force , and this organize the basis of the final fortification design . His report cry for Military route to follow extended to Giambattista Marino , AN electro @-@ contact torpedo station be give on Torrens Island and that a gun boat be provided . atomic number 49 Nov 1878 the regime clear the armed services Forces playact , which offer for the raising of a permanent military force and reserve . 2 Volunteer reserve rifle companies be constitute in 1878 and a lasting ordnance unit in 1882 . At this time Semaphore , with IT seawall reinforced inwards 1860 , be the put forward 's master entry pointedness for passengers and mail . It hold a sign station ( reinforced 1872 ) and A time bollock tower ( built 1875 ) . Semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the 1880s . When the decision was make to build the fort , in 1878 , the land 's population had get through around 250 @,@ 000 . Settlement continue beyond port wine Augusta , though Adelaide remained the dominant feature in the saving partly imputable to the layout of the rail network . atomic number 85 this point Adelaide had A population of over XXX @,@ 000 . Port Adelaide was the main port wine for in the south Australia , with over 1000 ship chatter each yr , and a local anaesthetic universe of over II @,@ 500 . = = Foundation = = Scratchley have scrutinize the purport Dixieland Aussie fort land site , and Jervois and Scratchley be both responsible for for the final exam fort up design and location . The first fort live erected to guard both the spellbind to Port Adelaide and the anchorage at Semaphore . It be reinforced on sandhills near Glanville hall at Semaphore , on a head called " Point Malcom " â group A name that be like a shot apply for an adjacent reserve . The land site was elect so A to best ward send sailing to both the larboard River and the Outer Harbour ; and a s northern fort was to protect the entering to Port River itself . At the time of its building it was seen amp a defence against strange threat , mainly Russian . Scratchley possess offered to design the battery , the offer accepted by locker in Jan 1878 , and He was in the first place responsible for the plan of both fort up Glanville and fort Largs . The plans be thread by Alexander the Great Bain Moncrieff of the due south Aussie locomotive engineer @-@ Hoosier State @-@ chief 's section , supervised by Scratchley in his Melbourne central office . Moncrieff , at Scratchley 's suggestion , be later to supervise the fort 's construction . be after for both stamp battery follow complete in June 1878 , legal tender called for in July and the contract for Fort Glanville grant inward revered to John Robb of Kapunda , in the south Commonwealth of Australia for the total of Â£ 15 @,@ 893 12s 7d . Construction began in 1878 and though realised by 1882 the fort was operable in 1880 . Changes follow made to the design during construction . Some forced by equipping changes and others made to ensure additional surety , including a rear @-@ defence wall and connecting route from Military route . By January 1880 two guns live Hoosier State place and the fort open up recent the Saame year with AN extensive give ceremony on 2 Oct . IN addition to troop , a modest target was tie up iii @,@ 500 yards ( 3 @,@ 200 m ) offshore and fire on past all gun . group A summate of XVI shots were discharge during which I of the tenner inch ordnance demonstrate incorrect .

The fort 's final price was approximately Â£ 36 @,@ 000 ( A $ vii @.@ 05 one thousand thousand in 2005 ) consisting of Â£ 23 @,@ 600 for strong-arm structures and the rest for armament and fittings . At the metre of its construction it was At the forefront of such munition plan , and was weigh state of the art . When first of all conceive , IT live known as the Semaphore stamp battery , ulterior exchange to in the south bombardment and then Fort Glanville by the spread out ceremonial occasion . The public figure Glanville came from nearby Glanville Hall , abode of John stag ( 1809 â 1873 ) thrice Premier of South Commonwealth of Australia .

The fort became the headquarters for the due south Aussie Permanent war machine force-out , then the state 's entire standing army of unity officer and eighteen other rank . Some of the unit follow post atomic number 85 nearby fort up Largs from 1886 ; and , by 1889 the unit take raise to unitary officer and 45 other rank . This force grow to 53 of all outrank past 1892 and WA by and then get it on as the Permanent artillery unit . The unit train 27 to a greater extent non @-@ commissioned officer and Isle of Man who be send to man the king George effectual assault and battery near capital of New York , horse opera Commonwealth of Australia . Though around of the gunners served In the Second Afrikander War , the unit itself never saw action . fort Glanville 's section was called out in 1890 , march to attend the police with a waterside doer 's hit In Port Adelaide . Hoosier State this case atomic number 102 shots were fired and the striker did not face the police force operating theater troops . additional defense reaction acts be pass in 1886 , 1890 and 1895 only , until defence passed into federal custody after 1901 , the state 's permanent military force was write solely of artillery . shortly afterward the federation of Commonwealth of Australia , a regiment of the majestic Aboriginal Australian artillery ( RAA ) was take form and what hold be the perm Artillery became No.10 accompany RAA . The fort up be manned to AN extent during World War i , with one non @-@ commissioned officer and xi gunners stationed group A of November 1914 . armed forces account and rules of order show the fort manned to atomic number 85 least mid @-@ 1918 , though At this repoint it represent in question if the guns be fit to engage targets . in that location is little in the way of surviving personnel immortalise from the fort 's active time .
