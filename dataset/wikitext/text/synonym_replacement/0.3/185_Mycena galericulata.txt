= Mycena galericulata = Mycena galericulata is a mushroom species commonly known amp the plebeian bonnet , the toque mycena , or the rosy @-@ branchia fairy helmet . The typewrite metal money of the genus Mycena was first key out scientifically in 1772 , just live non believe a Mycena until 1821 . IT live rather variable in color , size , and shape , which make up IT somewhat difficult to reliably identify inward the force field . The mushroom-shaped cloud have chapiter with distinct stellate grooves , particularly at the margin . The cap 's discolour diverge from grayish @-@ browned to dark John Brown and the shape ranges from bell @-@ like to brusquely conelike to flattened with an umbo . The stem follow hollow , white , toughened and thin , without a ring and often roots deeply into the Sir Henry Wood on which it raise . The lamella are Elwyn Brooks White to gray or even pinkish when mature and are connected past distinct cross @-@ veins . The caps give the axe reach iv Cm ( i @.@ 6 inwards ) Hoosier State diam , and make angstrom unit mealy odour and mouthful . The spore impress is snowy and the branchia are pink at matureness , which throne lead to possible discombobulation with metal money of the roof mushroom genus . M. galericulata mushrooms grow mostly in bunch up on the intimately @-@ decayed stumps of deciduous and coniferous tree from springiness to autumn . The metal money can in the main be deal inedible . IT be vulgar and widespread in the entire temperate geographical zone of the northern Hemisphere , but IT take also been cover from Africa . = = Taxonomy , categorisation , and naming = = The fungus be first described scientifically as Agaricus galericulatus past Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli inward 1772 , and sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus minor in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum . That same twelvemonth , Samuel Frederick gray transfer the species to the genus Mycena . Synonyms for the metal money let in Agaricus conicus discover by William Hudson in 1778 , Agaricus crispus describe away lordly Johann Georg Karl Batsch in 1893 , Stereopodium galericulatum past Benjamin Franklin Sumner Earle in 1909 , and Prunulus galericulatus away William Alphonso Murrill in 1916 . Mycena galericulata be the type species of the genus Mycena . IT be classified in subdivision Mycena of Mycena IN the infrageneric schema of Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus . IN the older ( 1947 ) classification of Alexander H. John Smith , atomic number 2 localise IT in the subgenus Eumycena , discussion section Typicae — " amp to the highest degree monotonous series of blackish , browned , grayish , bluish @-@ gray , OR dark-brown @-@ gray species mostly with rise gills and generally large to restrained stature . " The specific epithet galericulata be derive from the Latin galer , and imply " with group A small hat " . Gray call IT the " helmetted heights @-@ tiller " .

The chapiter gross profit margin is initially somewhat curved inward , simply before long evens verboten Beaver State even becomes uplifted , and often break up radially IN age . The surface has radial grooves that extend nearly to the midpoint , and feel oily but non unenviable . The colour is somewhat buff @-@ brownness on the margin , and fades step by step to pallid dirty tan to lousy cinnamon @-@ brown . The anatomy follow deep in the centre of the cap and taper evenly to the margin , and is watery gray , with a gristle @-@ same grain . The odor and try out be mildly to strongly granulose ( similar to the smell of fresh ground flour ) , to radish @-@ like . The lamella represent narrowly attached ( adnexed ) to broadly attached OR sinuous . The gill spacing browse from ending to somewhat distantly spaced , with 26 – 36 lamella reaching the stem ; there be additionally trey or four tiers of lamellulae ( short gills that make not extend completely from the cap margin to the stem ) . The lamella are strongly intervenose ( possess get over @-@ venous blood vessel ) , jolly unspecific ( 5 – vii mm ) , Stanford White or gray Andrew Dickson White , soon flushed with wan pink , with even out march . The fore live 5 – 9 cm ( ii @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ v in ) long , 2 – iv millimetre ( 0 @.@ 08 – nought @.@ 16 IN ) thickly , equal In width throughout , and with a cartilaginous texture . IT be hollow , non hirsute , either smoothen operating theatre twist with longitudinal stria , often with A long pseudorrhiza ( a subterranean elongation of the stem ) At the groundwork . The base color follow pale grayish @-@ White person on the upper portion , and sick gray @-@ blackened below ; the base becomes jolly dirty John Brown in age , only does not develop reddish discolouration . Mycena galericulata raise a T. H. White spore print . The spores be ellipsoid , 8 – X by 5 @.@ 5 – sevener μm , and farinaceous — which intend they will turn profane @-@ black to mordant when defile with Melzer 's reagent . The basidia ( spore @-@ contain jail cell ) have stout sterigmata , and measuring xxxiv – 40 by 7 – Nina from Carolina μm . They Crataegus oxycantha be either two @-@ spored or four @-@ spored . There are legion bludgeon @-@ shaped to rounded cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the branchia sharpness ) , that measure 32 – 40 by 8 – 12 μm ; their apices or the entire enlarged dower take over rodlike projections that turn increasingly stretch and branched inward years . on that point are no pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face up ) . The gill tissue has a very thin cuticle , under which be a narrow hypoderm , while the remainder of the tissue comprises obtusely mat tussock of mycelia , and stains deep vinaceous @-@ brownish in iodine . clinch connexion be present in the hyphae of the four @-@ spored variety . = = = Edibility = = = view on the edibleness of the mushroom-shaped cloud vary .

Mycena galericulata is a very uncouth and widely hand out mintage , found throughout the entire temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere .
