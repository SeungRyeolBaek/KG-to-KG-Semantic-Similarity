in our experiment , we begin with an optical characterization of the qds and observe a significantly reduced spectral linewidth of the emitted photons from a resonantly driven single qd compared with incoherent excitation methods including via above - bandgap and p - shell using cw lasers .
figure@xmath3s2(a - c ) present a direct comparison of the spectral linewidth of the emitted photons from a single qd ( qd2 ) neutral exciton for different cw - laser excitation methods . at moderate power regime ( around saturation ) , the cw photoluminescence spectra arising from above band - gap and _ p_-shell excitation yields a linewidth of @xmath52.5ghz ( see fig.@xmath3s2a ) and @xmath51.5ghz ( fig.@xmath3s2b ) , respectively . on the other hand , cw rf photons ( see fig.@xmath3s2c ) exhibit a significantly narrower linewidth of @xmath50.48ghz even at high power regime well above saturation ( 32@xmath46 ) where a mollow triplet arises @xcite .
figure@xmath3s2d shows a series of cw rf spectra at different laser power .
the coherence time @xmath47 fitted ( using the corrected eqn.(1 ) from ref.@xcite ) from the cw rf spectra at @xmath46 is closest to being radiative lifetime limited : @xmath47/@xmath48=0.93(6 ) , where @xmath49 is the exciton lifetime which is measured separately to be of 390(10)ps using time - resolved pulsed rf .
this is consistent with the prediction that the pure _ s_-shell resonant excitation can eliminate dephasings associated with the incoherent excitation methods @xcite .
a high - resolution pulsed rf spectrum from qd2 is shown in fig.@xmath3s3 . for a range of laser power from 0.2@xmath0 to @xmath0 pulse
, we fit the rf spectra with the voigt profile to extract the inhomogeneous ( gaussian ) linewidth ( @xmath50 ) .
as plotted in the inset of fig.@xmath3s3 , the @xmath50 shows a increase at larger excitation power , which is in qualitative agreement with previous investigations of light - induced spectral diffusion @xcite .
figure@xmath3s4a - b show the data of full histogram obtained on qd2 .
clusters of five peaks appear periodically with repetition period of @xmath1112.2 ns . the central cluster shows an overall reduced photon counts compared to the side clusters due to the single - photon nature of the source .
the hom interference are tested with @xmath0 , 0.72@xmath0 and 0.41@xmath0 pulse excitation where the rf counts reach @xmath6@xmath51 , @xmath6@xmath52 and @xmath6@xmath53 saturation level , and show raw visibilities of 0.903(55 ) , 0.912(56 ) and 0.934(39 ) , respectively ( see fig.@xmath34(c - h ) ) .
taking into account of the residual two - photon emission probability for this qd , @xmath54 , and the optical imperfections of our interferometric setup ( same as in the main text ) , we obtain corrected degrees of indistinguishability to be 0.956(58 ) , 0.966(59 ) , 0.989(41 ) for the @xmath0 , 0.72@xmath0 and 0.41@xmath0 pulses , respectively .
