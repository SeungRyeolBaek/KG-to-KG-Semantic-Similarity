we note that linear stability analysis can not be used to probe the stability of the synchronization , as we can not perform a valid taylor expansion when @xmath81 , where @xmath82 . for equal driving force profiles that we linearize , @xmath182 , @xmath183 ,
if we were to taylor expand , then the linearized expression for @xmath184 would be @xmath185 which has a singularity at @xmath81 .
the apparent singularity actually occurs at @xmath186 and at @xmath187 in the full expression , but the choice of constraining force ensures this zero in the denominator is canceled by the numerator . however , when we expand in @xmath37 and shift the singularity so that it occurs at @xmath81 , then the numerator is no longer zero at this point .
the reason we have this zero in the denominator is the following : the torque free condition ( [ eq : forcetorquefree ] ) is @xmath188 along with equations ( [ eq : rl]-[eq : rb],[eq : rld]-[eq : rbd ] ) , we use ( [ eq : torquefree ] ) to solve for the constraining forces @xmath189 , @xmath24 .
however , at @xmath190 , @xmath189 is multiplied by a term which vanishes , so the torque free condition can be satisfied without specifying @xmath189 .
we over - constrain the system when we divide by zero and specify @xmath189 at @xmath190 .
geometrically , @xmath191 corresponds to the phase where @xmath192 is parallel to @xmath193 .
our numerical analysis of the full expression avoids this singularity .
