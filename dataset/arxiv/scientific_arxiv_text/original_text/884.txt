the development of waveguide optical amplifiers based on rare earth ( re ) doped silicon based matrix is of great interest for the semiconductor research community@xcite .
erbium ions are particularly interesting due to an optical transition at @xmath9 which coincides with the maximum of transmission in optical glass fiber@xcite . however , in the case of erbium this transition involves the ground level , which may limit the achievable gain due to reabsorption mechanisms@xcite . to overcome this critical issue , neodymium ion has been recently proposed because its emission scheme makes it more suitable for achieving higher gain@xcite . in such a system , the amplification is commonly achieved through re level population inversion by an appropriate optical pumping .
one main drawback of re ions is their low absorption cross section .
however this can be overcome by the use of sensitizers that are characterized by a larger absorption cross section .
those sensitizers have shown an efficient transfer of energy to re ions in their vicinity .
several sensitizers of re have been proposed in literature .
et al _ @xcite shows the sensitization of @xmath1ions by different kinds of sensitizers such as ytterbium ions , metal ions and silicon nanograins ( si - ng ) .
the work of macdonald _ et al _ @xcite presents the sensitization of @xmath0ions by si - ng .
in this paper we present a comparative study of waveguides with an active layer containing si - ng and doped either with erbium or neodymium ions .
the typical composition and structure of such waveguides is presented in section [ description waveguide ] .
the electromagnetic field and level populations of si - ng and re ions have been computed using an algorithm published in a previous paper @xcite and briefly detailed in section [ calculation method ] .    in section [ rare earth ] , we describe levels populations equations associated with si - ng , erbium ions and neodymium ions . for the two re ions , due to their different transition time properties , two particular ways of calculation will be detailed . in section
[ results ] , we present for both re population inversions , population map and optical gain as a function of optical pump power .
we conclude by the comparison of the optical gain of two waveguides doped either with erbium or neodymium ions as a function of the pump power .      or @xmath1ions.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the waveguide is composed of three layers ( fig .
[ waveguide ] ) .
the bottom cladding layer is composed of pure silica . in order to ensure optical confinement of modes , this layer is about 5 to 8 @xmath10 m thick in a typical experimental waveguide doped either with @xmath0ions @xcite or @xmath1ions @xcite . in this modeling method
the thickness of bottom cladding layer was taken equal to @xmath11 in order to limit the use of memory .
the @xmath12 active layer constituted of silicon rich silicon oxide ( srso ) contains si - ng and re ions .
a pure silica strip layer is stacked on the top of the srso layer . the static refractive index (
_ i.e. _ refractive index which remains constant with wavelength ) of the active layer ( @xmath13 ) has been chosen greater than the one of the strip and bottom cladding layers ( @xmath14 ) to ensure the guiding conditions .    in order to investigate which is the most suitable re between @xmath0and @xmath1for achieving high gain ,
both waveguides are pumped continuously ( cw ) by the propagation in the active layer of a pump mode at 488 nm .
a signal mode is co - propagated in the active layer in order to investigate the achievability of amplification by stimulated emission .
this signal corresponds to a transition occurring between electronics levels of re , either at 1532 nm for erbium ions or at 1064 nm for neodymium ions@xcite .
the waveguide dimensions are identical for erbium or neodymium ions and according to the experimental conditions we propagate the fundamental transverse electric mode ( @xmath15 ) for the pump and signal along z direction .
the calculation and the injection of mode profiles in ade - fdtd method for all wavelengths considered here are described in our previous paper@xcite .
the electromagnetic fields ( @xmath16 ) and poynting vector ( @xmath17 ) as well as re and si - ng populations in steady state are computed by the algorithm described by fafin et al@xcite .
this algorithm is based on finite - difference time - domain method ( fdtd ) and auxiliary differential equations ( ade ) .
the fdtd method consists in the discretization in time and space of the electromagnetic fields@xcite according to the k. yee algorithm@xcite .
the ade makes the link between electromagnetic fields and absorption and emission processes by the use of a set of polarisation densities @xmath18 following a lorentz electronic oscillator model@xcite . a typical polarisation equation ( eq .
( [ polarisation ] ) ) between two level populations @xmath19 and @xmath20 is described below : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transition linewidth including radiative , non - radiative and de - phasing processes@xcite , and @xmath23 is the resonance frequency of this transition .
@xmath24 used in @xcite depends on the transition lifetime @xmath25 and on the optical index n.    the time evolution of levels populations for each emitter ( re , si - ng ) is described by a rate equation which depends on polarisation densities of considered transitions , lifetimes , transfer coefficient and levels populations . since in visible wavelength range
, the electromagnetic field has a characteristic time of the order of @xmath26 s and the levels populations of emitters have characteristic lifetimes as long as a few milliseconds @xcite , a classical ade - fdtd calculation is impossible in a reasonable time@xcite .
indeed with the classical ade - fdtd method the equations of populations are calculated simultaneously with the electromagnetic field leading to about @xmath27 iterations .
we have recently overcome this multiscale issue @xcite after splitting the classical ade - fdtd single loop into two interconnected loops separating short time and long time processes .
the electromagnetic fields and polarisation densities are calculated in the short time loop and the rate equations in the long time one .
this method allows us to reduce drastically the number of iterations from @xmath27 to @xmath28 and consequently reduces the calculation time to more reasonable duration ( 7 days for the present waveguide at bi - processors quad - core intel nehalem ep @ 2.8 ghz ) .
moreover , in order to minimize phase velocity error and velocity anisotropy errors inherent to the fdtd method , the algorithm was set up with the time and space steps introduced in our previous paper @xcite .
in this section we describe the excitation mechanism of the erbium and neodymium ions and the numerical calculation of the levels populations at the steady state .           we model silicon nanograins ( si - ng ) as a two levels system ( fig .
[ schema excitation ] ) where the ground and excited levels populations ( respectively @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) are given by the rate equations eq .
( [ eq_si_0 ] ) and eq .
( [ eq_si_1 ] ) . due to a low probability of multi - exciton generation in a single si - ng @xcite
, we assume the excitation of one single exciton by si - ng , therefore the si - ng population will correspond to the exciton population .
after non - radiative transitions in the conduction band , the exciton may either radiatively recombine or excite an emitter in its vicinity .
this energy transfer may occur if the energy gap between conduction and valence band of si - ng matches the energy gap between the re fundamental level and an upper level leading to a possible emission . according to literature @xcite the lifetime of excited level @xmath30
is chosen at @xmath31 . since few papers studied the energy transfer coefficient in si - ng and erbium ions @xcite and to our knowledge
no study was made on this coefficient in si - ng and neodymium , this energy transfer coefficient between si - ng and both re is assumed identical and taken equal to @xmath32 .
we took the same concentration of si - ng equal to @xmath33 for both active layers doped either with @xmath1or @xmath0ions . in order to simulate a realistic absorption and emission cross section equal to @xmath34 the linewidth @xmath22 and the number of polarizations @xmath35
are respectively fixed to @xmath36 and 2756 according to the method explained in @xcite .
these parameters are reported in table [ silicon parameters ] .
@xmath37    @xmath38    .parameters levels of silicon nanograins [ cols="^,^,^,^,^",options="header " , ]     [ neodymium parameters ]      we aim at calculating levels populations in steady states in a fast and convenient manner .
consequently , the preferred method would be an analytical calculation of populations by setting @xmath39 .
however , this is only applicable in case of neodymium levels equations .
moreover , the up - conversion term in erbium rate equations leads to equations that are hardly analytically solvable . in that case
, the steady states of population levels are reached by a finite difference method .
this calculation was possible using a reasonable time step of @xmath40 ten times lower than the shortest lifetime ( @xmath41 ) considered in this model .
the calculation time is then no longer negligible but does not rise up significantly the global calculation time of our ade - fdtd method .
the solution of eq . ( [ eq_si_0 ] ) to eq .
( [ eq_nd_0 ] ) gives the levels populations in their steady states .
we define for @xmath42 transition the population inversion ( section [ populations inversion ] ) as the ratio ( @xmath43 ) over the total population number ( @xmath44 for re or @xmath45 for si - ng ) .
we deduced also the optical gain ( section [ optical gain ] ) at @xmath46 for @xmath0and @xmath47 for @xmath1 .
these values are computed for a pump power ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .
we present in this section the spatial distribution of population inversion in waveguides doped either with erbium or neodymium ions for a pump power of @xmath48 in a longitudinal section view along the propagation axis ( fig .
[ populations re ] ) . for both waveguides
the plots show a decrease of population inversion with direction of propagation which can be attributed to the coupling between rare earth ions and silicon nanograins .    ,
title="fig:",scaledwidth=49.0% ] , title="fig:",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    for erbium ions , the population inversion remains positive over a length of @xmath49 . beyond this length ,
the population inversion becomes negative witnessing the threshold effect occurring with three - level system .    for neodymium ions the population inversion remains positive along the whole structure .
indeed , in this four - level system , the level 1 is depopulated quickly to the ground level leading to @xmath50 .
we now consider the population inversion distribution of si - ng presented in longitudinal section view in fig .
[ populations si ] for both re .
this decrease of population inversion of si - ng shows an identical behaviour with direction of propagation as the one observed with re .
this is characteristic of the pump strong absorption due to the presence of the nanograins as shown in our previous paper @xcite .    ,
title="fig:",scaledwidth=49.0% ] , title="fig:",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    from fig .
[ populations si ] we extract a particular set of values of the population inversion of si - ng along the direction of propagation recorded at @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( center of the xy section of the active layer ) ( fig .
[ populations si z ] ) . on this figure
, we observe along the whole length of the waveguide a larger si - ng population inversion with erbium than with neodymium . since the si - ng modeling is the same with both re , the population inversion difference is due to each specific si - ng / re interaction .
this interaction is governed by the transfer coefficient k , which is the same for both re , but also by specific transitions lifetimes of each re .
the larger population inversion observed for erbium than with neodymium is consequently due to the difference of lifetimes between these re ( table [ erbium parameters ] and [ neodymium parameters ] ) .
this observation leads us to the conclusion that re excitation occurring from si - ng is more efficient in the case of neodymium than in the case of erbium ions due to the specific time dynamics of transitions in different re .     and
@xmath52 ( center of the xy section of the active layer ) for a pump power equal to @xmath53,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figure [ population_inversion ] shows the influence of pump power on population inversion for the erbium and the neodymium ions as well as for the si - ng .
we observe that the population inversion occurs above a threshold pump power ( @xmath54 ) for erbium .
this behaviour is typical of a three - level system . for neodymium ions ,
we observe a positive population inversion for the whole pump power range which is characteristic of a four - level system . for high pump power ( @xmath55 )
, both populations inversions reach a comparable value witnessing the saturation of the excitation mechanism .
finally , we plot ( dotted lines ) the population inversion of si - ng as a function of pump power . whatever the pump power , this inversion is higher for erbium than for neodymium ions .
this evidences a more efficient transfer from si - ng to neodymium ions than to erbium ions .    )
recorded at @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( center of the xy section of the active layer ) and z=0 ( beginning of the waveguide),scaledwidth=80.0% ]      from population levels @xmath56 we deduced the local gross gain per unit length @xmath57 ( eq .
( [ gain ] ) ) at the signal wavelength : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are respectively the higher and lower levels of the considered transition and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are absorption and emission cross sections .
for erbium ions , we make the link @xmath63 and @xmath64 and for neodymium ions @xmath65 and @xmath66 and we assume equal emission and absorption cross sections for one re .
the local gross gain per unit length recorded at @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( center of the xy section of the active layer ) and @xmath67 ( beginning of the waveguide ) is plotted in fig .
[ figure gain ] .
( open circle ) and a waveguide doped with @xmath1(open square ) recorded at @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( center of the xy section of the active layer ) and @xmath67 ( beginning of the waveguide ) .
losses found by pirasteh _
et al _ @xcite are represented ( dashed line).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    for @xmath1doped waveguide , we find that , above a threshold pump power of @xmath68 , a positive gross gain is reached which increases up to @xmath5 for the highest pump power simulated in our study . in order to estimate the net gain , we must account for the background losses such as those found by navarro - urrios _ et al _
@xcite on comparable samples ( @xmath69 at @xmath9 ) .
we can conclude that it is not possible to reach a positive net gain in this range of pump power .
however navarro - urrios _ et al _ found a positive net gain equal to @xmath70 , this small difference with our modelling result may be explained by higher pump power that was used in the experiment ( @xmath71 to @xmath72 ) .    for @xmath0doped waveguide
, we find that the optical gain remains positive over the whole power range .
it increases up to @xmath4 for the highest pump power of @xmath73 .
we can also estimate a net gain taking into account background losses of @xmath74 found by pirasteh _
et al _ in a similar system@xcite .
figure [ figure gain ] shows that for a pump power above @xmath75 the losses ( dashed line ) can be compensated leading to a net gain .    the gross gain per unit length obtained for @xmath0remains higher that the one obtained for @xmath1whatever the pump power range . the gross gain per unit length difference ( between @xmath0and @xmath1doped waveguide )
is all the higher as the pump power increases .
this feature may be due to the difference in si - ng / re transfer efficiency ( section [ populations inversion ] ) linked to the levels dynamics as well as to the difference in absorption / emission cross section ( @xmath76 against @xmath77 ) .
the three categories of commercially available optical amplifier on c - band ( edfa , edwa and soa ) present a gain level about 20 to 25 db with a working length ranging from cm to few meters for edfa and for a power consumption mainly dedicated to optical or electrical pumping of about few watts @xcite . since we found a low gain and a short length of positive population inversion by modeling of @xmath1doped based waveguide on the broad range of pump power .
we conclude to the impossibility of achievement of an optical amplifier with this configuration of co - propagating pump and signal which would compete with commercially available systems .
the gross gain per unit length reachable with @xmath0 , about one order of magnitude larger than the one obtained with @xmath1 , could lead a significant amplification . to our knowledge
, there is no commercially available comparable optical amplifier based on nd3 + emission bands . however , @xmath0doped aluminum oxide channel waveguide amplifiers developed by yang _
et al _ show a maximal internal gain of 6 db / cm for a pump power of 45 mw@xcite .
our algorithm based on ade - fdtd method previously used for modeling steady states of fields , population levels and gross gain per unit length for @xmath0doped waveguide has been extended with success to the case of erbium ions doped waveguide .
we have demonstrated that the neodymium ions are more suitable than the erbium ions to obtain a net positive gain per unit length in silica based waveguide containing silicon nanograins . the theoretical maximum gross gain per unit length of @xmath5 at 1532 nm ( @xmath73 ) does not compensate background losses experimentally estimated to @xmath78 . on the contrary
, the use of neodymium ions leads to a gross gain per unit length of @xmath4 at 1064 nm ( @xmath73 ) .
moreover the background losses are compensated above a pump power threshold of @xmath75 .
this theoretical demonstration of a large gross gain per unit length for a @xmath0doped active layer may justify further experimental work in order to achieve @xmath0doped silicon based waveguide optical amplifier or laser .    in order to investigate the possibility of achieving larger gain
further studies may be performed with other concentrations of rare earth and si - ng , other rare earth and other pumping configurations .
this method may be applied to study the electromagnetic fields and levels populations distribution in steady states of systems with other kind of emitters ( quantum dots , quantum wells ... ) and in other configuration ( vcels , down - converting layers ... ) .
