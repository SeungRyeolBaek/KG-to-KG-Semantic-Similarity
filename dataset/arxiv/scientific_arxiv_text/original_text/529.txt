in this appendix , we explain how the line width was extracted from the numerical data .
we begin by determining the spectral function , defined by @xmath115 this consists of a set of delta functions .
we then define the integrated spectral function @xmath116 .
this consists of a set of step functions ( see fig .
[ steps](a ) ) . for each step
, we identify the energy values corresponding to @xmath117 of the step , @xmath118 of the step , and @xmath119 of the step . the energy spacing between the @xmath117 and @xmath119 points
is taken to be the linewidth of this spectral line .
we track how this line width scales with @xmath0 .
we note that there is in general a wide distribution of line widths for any @xmath0 ( fig .
[ steps](b ) ) . as a result ,
the mean and the median linewidth scale very differently ( see fig.5 of the main text ) .
an understanding of the difference between the scaling of the mean and typical line width is an important challenge for future work .
( a ) the procedure for determining the linewidth .
the blue curve is an integrated spectral function .
the green squares divide each step into half , the red diamonds mark @xmath117 and the light blue circles mark @xmath120 of each step .
( b ) probability distribution of the linewidth @xmath109 for different values of coupling to the bath @xmath0 for a system with @xmath69 and @xmath121 averaged over 10 disorder configurations .
lines are a guide to the eye . ]
