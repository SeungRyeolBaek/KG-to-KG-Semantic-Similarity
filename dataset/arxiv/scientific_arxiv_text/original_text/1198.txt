to compile the sample , image fields from the vla - first survey ( becker et al .
1995 ) containing components bright and extended enough to judge the source morphologies were inspected by - eye .
this gave an initial 100 candidates with extended winged emission ( fig .  1 ; cheung 2006 ) .
compared to previously known examples ( e.g. , lal & rao 2006 ) , the new candidates are systematically fainter ( @xmath010@xmath1 ) and more distant ( @xmath2@xmath30.3 ) .
new optical spectroscopic observations are identifying many of the fainter , more distant optical hosts .
most candidates have clear winged emission and higher resolution vla observations of initially @xmath040 sources have been obtained to confirm the morphological identifications . of the candidates , enough are legitimate x - shaped sources ( conventionally , those with wing to lobe extents of @xmath40.8:1 ) to more than double the number known .
lower frequency gmrt observations of selected objects are being pursued to map any spectral structure to estimate the particle ages in the wings to test formation scenarios ( e.g. , dennett - thorpe et al . 2002 ) .
we examined the host galaxies of about a dozen new and previously known examples with available sdss images ( 54 sec exposures ) to quantify any asymmetry in the surrounding medium as required by hydrodynamic wing formation models ( e.g. , capetti et al .
most of the galaxies are highly elliptical with the minor axes roughly aligned with the wings , consistent with the findings of capetti et al . for a similarly sized sample .
however , we found smaller ellipticities ( @xmath5@xmath60.1 ) in at least two examples , 3c192 and b2  0828 + 32 , confirming previous studies of these hosts ( smith & heckman 1989 ; ulrich & r " onnback 1996 ) .  round " hosts are not necessarily incompatible with the hydrodynamic picture as observed @xmath5 values can be lowered by projection .
this should be investigated more thoroughly with a dedicated host galaxy imaging program .
