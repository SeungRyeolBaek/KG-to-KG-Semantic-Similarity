here we present the method we used to calculate the fano factor for the tunnel exclusion process in the sierpiski lattice and in the random - resistor network .
we follow the master equation approach of refs .
the two - dimensionality of our networks requires a more elaborate bookkeeping , which we manage by means of the hamiltonian formalism of ref .
@xcite .
we consider a network of @xmath53 sites , each of which is either empty or singly occupied .
two sites are called adjacent if they are directly connected by at least one bond .
a subset @xmath54 of the @xmath53 sites is connected to the source and a subset @xmath55 is connected to the drain .
each of the @xmath56 possible states of the network is reached with a certain probability at time @xmath10 .
we store these probabilities in the @xmath56-dimensional vector @xmath57 .
its time evolution in the tunnel exclusion process is given by the master equation @xmath58 where the matrix @xmath59 contains the tunnel rates .
the normalization condition can be written as @xmath60 , in terms of a vector @xmath61 that has all @xmath62 components equal to 1 .
this vector is a left eigenstate of @xmath59 with zero eigenvalue @xmath63 because every column of @xmath59 must sum to zero in order to conserve probability .
the right eigenstate with zero eigenvalue is the stationary distribution @xmath64 .
all other eigenvalues of @xmath59 have a real part @xmath65 .
we store in the vector @xmath66 the conditional probabilities that a state is reached at time @xmath10 after precisely @xmath67 charges have entered the network from the source . because the source remains occupied , a charge which has entered the network can not return back to the source but must eventually leave through the drain .
one can therefore use @xmath67 to represent the number of transfered charges .
the time evolution of @xmath66 reads @xmath68 where @xmath69 has been decomposed into a matrix @xmath70 containing all transitions by which @xmath67 does not change and a matrix @xmath71 containing all transitions that increase @xmath67 by 1 .
the probability @xmath72 that @xmath67 charges have been transferred through the network at time @xmath10 represents the counting statistics .
it describes the entire statistics of current fluctuations .
the cumulants @xmath73 are obtained from the cumulant generating function @xmath74.\ ] ] the average current and fano factor are given by @xmath75    the cumulant generating function can be expressed in terms of a laplace transformed probability vector @xmath76 as @xmath77 transformation of eq .
gives @xmath78 where we have introduced the counting matrix @xmath79 the cumulant generating function follows from @xmath80    the long - time limit of interest for the fano factor can be implemented as follows @xcite .
let @xmath81 be the eigenvalue of @xmath82 with the largest real part , and let @xmath83 be the corresponding ( normalized ) right eigenstate , @xmath84 since the largest eigenvalue of @xmath85 is zero , we have @xmath86 ( note that @xmath87 is the stationary distribution @xmath88 introduced earlier . )
in the limit @xmath89 only the largest eigenvalue contributes to the cumulant generating function , @xmath90 = \mu(\chi).\ ] ]      the construction of the counting matrix @xmath82 is simplified by expressing it in terms of raising and lowering operators , so that it resembles a hamiltonian of quantum mechanical spins @xcite .
first , consider a single site with the basis states @xmath91 ( vacant ) and @xmath92 ( occupied ) .
we define , respectively , raising and lowering operators @xmath93 we also define the electron number operator @xmath94 and the hole number operator @xmath95 ( with @xmath96 the @xmath97 unit matrix ) .
each site @xmath98 has such operators , denoted by @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .
the matrix @xmath82 can be written in terms of these operators as @xmath103 where all tunnel rates have been set equal to unity .
the first sum runs over all ordered pairs @xmath104 of adjacent sites .
these are hermitian contributions to the counting matrix .
the second sum runs over sites in @xmath105 connected to the source , and the third sum runs over sites in @xmath106 connected to the drain .
these are non - hermitian contributions .
it is easy to convince oneself that @xmath85 is indeed @xmath59 of eq .
, since every possible tunneling event corresponds to two terms in eq .
: one positive non - diagonal term responsible for probability gain for the new state and one negative diagonal term responsible for probability loss for the old state . in accordance with eq .
, the full @xmath82 differs from @xmath59 by a factor @xmath107 at the terms associated with charges entering the network .      in view of eq .
, the entire counting statistics in the long - time limit is determined by the largest eigenvalue @xmath81 of the operator . however , direct calculation of that eigenvalue is feasible only for very small networks .
our approach , following ref .
@xcite , is to derive the first two cumulants by solving a hierarchy of linear equations .
we will now express @xmath81 in terms of @xmath112 .
we start from the definition .
if we act with @xmath61 on the left - hand - side of eq .
we obtain @xmath113 in the second equality we have used eq .
[ which holds since @xmath114 .
acting with @xmath61 on the the right - hand - side of eq .
we obtain just @xmath81 , in view of eq .. hence we arrive at @xmath115        to obtain @xmath116 we set up a system of linear equations starting from @xmath120 commuting @xmath101 to the right , using the commutation relations @xmath121
= s_i^+$ ] and @xmath122 = - s_i^-$ ] , we find @xmath123 the notation @xmath124 means that the sum runs over all sites @xmath125 adjacent to @xmath98 .
the number @xmath126 is the total number of bonds connected to site @xmath98 ; @xmath127 of these bonds connect site @xmath98 to the source .    in order to compute @xmath109 we set @xmath128 in eq .  ,
use eq .   to set the left - hand - side to zero , and solve the resulting symmetric sparse linear system of equations ,
@xmath129 this is the first level of the hierarchy .
substitution of the solution into eq . gives the average current @xmath5 .      to calculate the fano factor via eq .
we also need @xmath130 .
we take eq .
, substitute eq .   for @xmath81 ,
differentiate and set @xmath128 to arrive at @xmath131 to find @xmath110 we note that @xmath132 and commute @xmath101 to the right . setting @xmath128
provides the second level of the hierarchy of linear equations , @xmath133 the number @xmath134 is the number of bonds connecting sites @xmath98 and @xmath125 if they are adjacent , while @xmath135 if they are not adjacent .

graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms , forming a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice .
electrical conduction is provided by overlapping @xmath136-orbitals , with on average one electron per @xmath136-orbital in undoped graphene .
electron puddles have a little more than one electron per @xmath136-orbital ( _ n_-type doping ) , while hole puddles have a little less than one electron per @xmath136-orbital ( _ p_-type doping ) .
an electron gas is called `` degenerate '' if the average occupation number of a quantum state is either close to unity or close to zero .
it is called `` nondegenerate '' if the average occupation number is much smaller than unity for all states .
