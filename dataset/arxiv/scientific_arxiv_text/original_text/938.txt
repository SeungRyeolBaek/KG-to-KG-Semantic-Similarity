* quantum dot structures .
* inas / gaas qds are grown by molecular - beam epitaxy on ( 001 ) gaas substrates , and then thermally annealed at 940 @xmath30c @xcite .
annealing interdiffuses indium and gallium , resulting in ( in , ga)as / gaas qds with effective localization volumes of order 2000 nm@xmath31 , giving @xmath010@xmath2 nuclei within the spatial extent of the resident hole s wavefunction .
the sample contains 20 layers of qds , separated by 60  nm gaas barriers .
each layer contains @xmath0@xmath32 qds/@xmath33 . although not intentionally doped , these qds are weakly _ p_-type due to background carbon doping ; we estimate that @xmath010% of the qds contain a single resident hole .

* spin noise spectroscopy . *
the qd samples are mounted on the cold finger of a small optical cryostat .
a linearly - polarized continuous - wave probe laser is tuned in wavelength to within the pl spectrum of the qd ensemble and is weakly focused through the sample ( @xmath34 , where * n * is the sample normal ) .
stochastic fluctuations of the ensemble hole spin projection along the * z * axis , @xmath10 , impart faraday rotation fluctuations @xmath11 on the transmitted probe laser via the usual optical selection rules for positively - charged trions .
balanced photodiodes detect @xmath7 , and the amplified output voltage @xmath35 is continuously digitized and fourier - transformed to obtain the frequency spectrum of the measured noise power @xcite .
external coils provide longitudinal ( @xmath23 ) and transverse ( @xmath20 ) applied magnetic fields .
background noise densities due to photon shot noise and amplifier noise are eliminated by interleaving and subtracting spectra acquired at large @xmath20 ( @xmath362000 g ) , which shifts any spin noise to high frequencies outside the measured range .
this procedure leaves behind only the noise signals arising from fluctuating hole spins at low fields .
typically the cw probe laser power is a few hundred @xmath1w , and it is focused to a rather large ( 100 @xmath1 m ) spot on the sample to minimize heating and self - pumping of the qds ( see fig .
s2 ) . crucially , and in comparison with previous work
@xcite , the present setup uses low - noise , stabilized probe lasers that now permit accurate and quantitative recovery of the small low - frequency spin noise signals that exist in the zero - field limit .
a consistent measure of the characteristic timescale @xmath8 of the hole spin correlations is obtained from the measured half - width @xmath15 of the spin noise peak that is centered on zero frequency .
specifically , we use @xmath37 , which is precise for lorentzian noise lineshapes that indicate single - exponential relaxation dynamics .
this definition of @xmath8 is also used when the noise lineshapes deviate from lorentzian , even though , strictly speaking , power - law lineshapes can not be characterized by a specific timescale . in this case
, @xmath15 is determined relative to the peak spin noise power spectral density that is measured in the lowest frequency bin .
figure s1 shows the inhomogeneously - broadened photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of the ( in , ga)as / gaas qd ensemble ( solid black lines ) under very low excitation conditions by a 1.58  ev ( 785  nm ) laser .
this pl arises from ground - state recombination of both positively - charged trions @xmath38 ( from qds containing a single resident hole ) , as well as from neutral excitons @xmath39 ( from qds that are empty ) .
note that these transition energies are typically very close in ( in , ga)as qds ( @xmath38 being higher in energy by @xmath40 mev @xcite ) and therefore they overlap in this ensemble pl spectrum and can not be separately resolved .
the pl spectrum therefore directly reflects the inhomogeneously - broadened distribution of fundamental qd transition energies in the ensemble .
the good correspondence between the pl and total spin noise indicates that the spin noise signals arise from resident holes in these qds , and not from holes or electrons residing in , _
e.g. _ , the wetting or buffer layers of the structure . ]
when performing spin noise spectroscopy of these qds , the narrow - band , continuous - wave probe laser is tuned in energy to within this pl spectrum .
figure s1 also shows the frequency - integrated ( _ i.e. _ , total ) measured spin noise power as a function of the photon energy of the probe laser . the integrated spin noise power provides a relative measure of the number of fluctuating spins being measured .
its dependence largely follows the pl spectrum with a small blueshift , commensurate with the expected energy difference between @xmath38 and @xmath39 transition energies .
this correspondence indicates that the measured spin noise arises from the resident holes that are trapped in the singly - charged subset of the qds ( rather than from spins in , _
e.g. _ , the buffer or wetting layers or in the bulk of the semiconductor wafer ) .
further , at all probe laser energies where spin noise is detected , the spin noise exhibits the same narrow spectral width at zero applied magnetic field ( as shown in figure 1 of the main text ) , and the measured spin noise has the same behavior in transverse and longitudinal fields as shown in the main text ( verified for a number of different probe energies ) .
the particular implementation of spin noise spectroscopy employed in these experiments to detect fluctuations of @xmath41 ( the net spin polarization of the resident holes in the qd ensemble ) is based on optical faraday rotation . the faraday rotation angle
@xmath42 depends on the difference between the indices of refraction for right- and left - circularly polarized light , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in particular , @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 is the sample thickness , @xmath47 denotes energy , and @xmath48 is the speed of light .    before discussing the case of an inhomogeneously - broadened qd ensemble , first consider a spin noise measurement of a single homogeneously - broadened optical absorption resonance @xmath49 having a lorentzian line - shape centered at @xmath50 and half - width @xmath51 ; namely , @xmath52 , as shown in figure s2a .
let us say that this absorption resonance is spin - dependent as for the case of the optical transition between a resident hole and a positively - charged trion @xmath38 .
following the usual optical selection rules , if the resident hole is  spin - up " then it can only absorb @xmath53 circularly - polarized light , but if it is in the  spin - down " state then it can only absorb @xmath54 circularly - polarized light .     and @xmath53 circularly polarized absorption resonances @xmath55 and the associated indices of refraction @xmath56 of an idealized homogeneously - broadened ( lorentzian ) optical transition ( _ e.g. _ , from a @xmath38 transition ) .
@xmath56 decay much more slowly than @xmath55 as a function of large detuning @xmath57 .
faraday rotation , @xmath58 , can therefore remain sensitive to the spin state @xmath41 of the resident hole , even for large @xmath57 where @xmath59 .
importantly , note that @xmath60 when @xmath61 .
( b ) an illustration of the inhomogeneously - broadened distribution of @xmath38 transitions within the qd ensemble .
the probe laser is most sensitive to hole spin fluctuations in those qds having @xmath38 transition energies detuned by about @xmath51 and is _ not _ sensitive to those qds that are on resonance ( _ i.e. _ , to those qds that are unavoidably pumped by the linearly - polarized probe laser ) .
( c ) the half - width @xmath15 of the zero - field hole spin noise spectrum measured using different probe laser power : there is no perceptible influence of the probe laser on the hole spin correlation time .
( d ) the total ( frequency - integrated ) spin noise , in volts , as a function of probe laser power .
the total spin noise scales nearly linearly with the probe laser power , indicating no contribution to the spin noise from excited carriers .
the dots are measured values , and the solid lines are power - law fittings . in ( c ) and
( d ) the red and black dots denote two measurements with different spot sizes . ]    the dispersive part of this optical transition  that is , the part complementary to the absorption resonances @xmath62  are the indices of refraction @xmath63 . as a function of detuning @xmath64 from resonance , the indices @xmath65 decay much more slowly than the absorption @xmath62 : as @xmath66 versus @xmath67 , respectively
. therefore , a measurement of faraday rotation can remain sensitive to the spin state of the hole even for large detuning @xmath68 where @xmath69 and the number of photons absorbed by the system becomes vanishingly small . in this regard
, the measurement of @xmath41 can be considered non - perturbative , and spin noise measurements of this type were performed on alkali vapors at large probe laser detunings from the @xmath70 ( d1 and d2 ) lines of potassium and rubidium @xcite , and were also performed on conduction - band electrons in bulk _
n_-gaas with the probe laser detuned well below the gaas band - edge @xcite .
note that @xmath42 and therefore the spin noise measurement is most sensitive to spin fluctuations of this idealized system when the probe laser and the absorption resonance are separated by an energy of @xmath71 .
the sensitivity falls off slowly as @xmath66 at larger detunings .
even more importantly , note that @xmath72 at small detunings @xmath73 , and that @xmath74 exactly on resonance ( @xmath61 ) because there is no difference between @xmath75 and @xmath76 . _
the spin noise measurement is not sensitive to transitions lying at the same energy as the probe laser . _
this brings us to the case of measuring spin noise in an inhomogeneously - broadened qd ensemble .
here we tune the laser to directly within the inhomogeneously - broadened distribution of qd transition energies .
as shown above in figure s1 , this maximizes the measured spin noise signal . undoubtedly , those qds in the ensemble that happen to be resonant with the probe laser are optically pumped by the probe laser .
however as noted in the previous paragraph , it is precisely these resonant qds that do not , to leading order , give any spin noise ( moreover , any photogenerated electrons , holes and/or trions that are pumped by the linearly - polarized probe laser are not spin - polarized ) .
rather , the probe laser will be primarily sensitive to those resident holes in qds that have detuned @xmath38 transitions , and these qds are not pumped ( see fig .
s2b ) . in this regard ,
the faraday rotation measurement still functions as a non - perturbative probe of @xmath41 , the net spin polarization of resident holes in the qd ensemble .
the fact that @xmath77 is not sensitive to spins in qd ensembles that are weakly pumped at @xmath78 was demonstrated in several recent ultrafast studies using independently - tunable pump and probe lasers @xcite .
nonetheless , great care is taken to ensure that the probe laser functions only as a passive detector of the resident hole spin fluctuations , and does not inadvertently perturb the measurement of @xmath41 .
primarily , we wish to ensure that the probe laser i ) does not heat the qds which could lead to incorrect spin lifetime measurements , and ii ) does not inadvertently detect any particles ( electrons , holes , excitons or trions ) that are photoexcited by the probe laser itself .
thus we use low probe laser intensities by using low laser power ( @xmath0200 @xmath1w ) and large spot sizes ( @xmath0100 @xmath1 m ) .
although this significantly reduces the measured spin noise signals , it ensures that we operate in a regime where the measured spin correlation times @xmath8 ( _ i.e. _ , the inverse width of the spin noise spectra , @xmath79 ) are independent of probe laser power .    in this regime , figure s2(c )
shows that the measured half - width @xmath15 of the low temperature , zero - field hole spin noise spectrum is independent of the probe laser power .
significantly higher probe laser intensity leads to a broadening of the spin noise peak , indicating shorter hole spin lifetimes .
for the same series of measurements , figure s2(d ) shows the total ( frequency - integrated ) spin noise signal in units of volts of detected signal .
as expected , the total spin noise signal detects no contribution from photoexcited carriers , since it increases nearly linearly with probe laser power ( all else being equal , doubling the laser power simply doubles the voltages at the photodetectors ) .
if the probe laser were inadvertently measuring spin noise from photogenerated ( rather than resident ) particles in the resonant qds , the total spin noise would be expected to increase super - linearly ( doubling the laser power would not only double the voltages at the photodetectors , it would also double  or at least increase  the number of particles being measured , leading to a superlinear dependence ) .
figure s3 shows that magnetic fields in the longitudinal ( * z * ) direction , either real or effective , necessarily lead to some spin noise centered at zero frequency . to demonstrate this , we show spin noise measurements of electron - doped bulk gaas .
free conduction band electrons in _
n_-type bulk gaas are delocalized and sample a huge number of lattice nuclei
. therefore the influence of the fluctuating nuclear spin bath on these free electrons is extremely small . to leading order , the only magnetic fields felt by the electrons are those that are externally applied . in this case
, a purely transverse applied magnetic field @xmath20 uniformly shifts the spin noise of these electrons out to the larmor frequency @xmath80 , and leaves no remnant of spin noise at zero frequency ( figure s3a ) .
this is in marked contrast to the spin noise spectra of qd holes shown in figure 2 of the paper , in which some spin noise clearly remains at zero frequency despite application of a purely transverse @xmath20  this remaining spin noise is due to the longitudinal components of the effective nuclear field @xmath3 that is felt by the holes .
= 0 , 2.5 , 5.0 , 7.5 , and 10  g ( black to green ) .
note the absence of residual noise at 0 hz , as expected from particles that feel little influence of the nuclear spin bath .
the probe laser s wavelength is 845.6  nm ( well below the gaas band - edge ) , its power is 2  mw , and the spot size is large ( 100 @xmath1 m ) .
this @xmath81-gaas wafer is 350 @xmath1 m thick and is doped at @xmath82 @xmath83 ( it is  sample a " in ref .
( b ) spin noise in a 60  g canted applied magnetic field ( @xmath84 ) , showing that longitudinal ( * z * ) field components lead to spin noise at zero frequency . ]    that longitudinal fields generate spin noise at zero frequency is explicitly demonstrated in figure s3(b ) , which shows electron spin noise spectra in an intentionally tilted applied magnetic field .
a 60  g applied field * b * is rotated from the transverse to the longitudinal direction ( @xmath85 ) . as *
b * acquires a longitudinal component , zero frequency spin noise grows as sin@xmath86 , with a commensurate cos@xmath86 suppression of noise signal at the electron larmor frequency .
it is useful to construct a toy model of hole spin noise in the considerably oversimplified limit of _ static _ nuclear overhauser fields @xmath87 .
the purpose of this exercise is three - fold :    \1 ) it demonstrates that hole spin precession about @xmath3 generates a broad hole spin noise spectrum at high frequencies between 5 - 100  mhz .
the broadness of this high frequency noise is due to the statistical distribution of @xmath3 over the qd ensemble , and also to the inhomogeneous distribution of hole g - factors within the qd ensemble .
\2 ) it demonstrates that the longitudinal overhauser fields @xmath88 give a delta - function ( or at least very narrow ) spin noise peak at zero frequency , that is _ not _ expected to narrow or broaden with applied fields @xmath20 or @xmath23 ( in contrast to actual experimental observation ) .
this noise peak is not statistically broadened by the ensemble , since each qd gives some noise at exactly zero frequency .
\3 ) it shows that , in zero applied field , the high - frequency precessional noise is strongly suppressed as compared to the zero - frequency noise due to the large anisotropy of the hole g - factor .    in marked contrast with electrons , holes couple very anisotropically to in - plane versus out - of - plane magnetic fields .
for _ pure _ heavy holes , the longitudinal ( out - of - plane ) g - factor @xmath89 is finite while the transverse ( in - plane ) g - factor @xmath90 is zero . however , hole eigenstates in typical _
p_-type self - assembled iii - v quantum dots invariably contain some admixture of light hole states in addition to their predominantly heavy - hole character .
this leads to a small in - plane g - factor @xmath90 that is of order 0.15 in our qds , which is about an order of magnitude less than @xmath89 ( @xmath91 ) .
note also that there exists a large inhomogeneous dispersion of these g - factors within the qd ensemble , likely due to differences in qd shape and strain .
here we assume that the overhauser field @xmath3 in each quantum dot has components @xmath92 , and @xmath88 that are each gaussian - distributed with typical dispersion of @xmath025 gauss ( taken from experimental data of figure 3c ) .
in any given qd , hole spin precession about the transverse component of @xmath3 generates noise in @xmath41 ( the measured quantity ) at the hole s larmor precession frequency ,    @xmath93    ( where here we have generalized slightly to allow for real applied magnetic fields @xmath20 and/or @xmath23 , and we assume no in - plane anisotropy of @xmath90 for simplicity ) .    in each qd , @xmath94 occurs at a different frequency depending on the magnitude and direction of @xmath3 in that qd , and also depending on @xmath90 and @xmath89 in that qd . using the typical values stated above
, @xmath94 can range from a few mhz out to @xmath0100  mhz . averaging over many qds , _
this precessional noise generates a very broad spectrum _ , weakly peaked at about 10  mhz and spanning the range from 5 - 100 mhz .
it is this precessional noise that represents the trivial ensemble dephasing of an ensemble of hole spins that are all initially oriented at @xmath95 , as in a pump - probe measurement .    .
in each qd , hole spin precession about @xmath3 induces a high - frequency noise peak at the hole larmor frequency @xmath94 . in addition
, longitudinal ( * z * ) components of @xmath3 generate a noise peak at zero frequency ( for the analogous case of electrons in arbitrary applied fields , see fig .
s3 above ) . for the purposes of this toy model ,
these peaks are represented by delta functions .
the total noise power contained within the high - frequency peak is generally much smaller than that within the zero - frequency peak , due to the large anisotropy of the hole g - factor .
statistical averaging over the qd ensemble smears the high - frequency precessional noise over a large frequency range . on the other hand ,
the zero - frequency noise peak is contributed to by every qd . _ in our noise experiments , it is precisely the width and lineshape of this zero - frequency peak that we seek to measure _ , as these parameters reveal the intrinsic spin correlation timescales and decay mechanisms of the hole spins . ]    however , in each and every qd , the longitudinal component of @xmath3 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath88 ) , generates a finite time - averaged value of the hole s spin projection , @xmath13 , that does _ not _ decay in time . in a noise measurement , and within the limitations of this toy model , this simply gives a delta function at zero frequency , and applied magnetic fields do not alter the lineshape of this peak .
of course in reality , @xmath13 _ does _ decay because @xmath3 is _ not _
static , and the associated noise peak is not a delta function  _ it is precisely the width and lineshape of this zero - frequency peak that reveals the long - time decay mechanisms of the central hole spins _ that we are interested in .    within this simple model
, it can be shown that the total ( frequency - integrated ) power of the noise peak at @xmath94 is @xmath96    while the integrated power of the noise peak at zero frequency is @xmath97    therefore in the absence of any applied fields ( @xmath98 ) , the noise power at @xmath94 is typically suppressed as compared to the zero - frequency noise by @xmath99 ( except when @xmath88 is very small ) .
this , together with the above - noted fact that ensemble averaging smears out the high - frequency precessional noise over a very broad bandwidth , may explain why we do not observe any clear sign of precessional noise occurring at high frequencies in the absence of applied fields .
only the much larger zero - frequency noise is apparent .
however , as we apply large magnetic fields in the transverse direction ( @xmath20 ) , all the hole noise power is expected to shift to the precessional noise component at @xmath94 , in agreement with our experimental data ( figure 2 of the main paper ) .
further , as we apply large fields in the longitudinal direction ( @xmath23 ) , the total noise power contained within the zero - frequency component will increase only very slightly ( all the noise power is essentially already contained in this peak ) , again in agreement with experimental observation .    finally , note that the above expressions also hold for electrons , in which case @xmath100 and
the high - frequency and zero - frequency noise peaks are expected to have comparable integrated power .
previous theoretical studies of nuclear spin  co - flips " ( a flip - flop of two distant nuclei mediated by virtual hole - nuclear spin flips ) revealed non - exponential decay of the central spin due to non - markovian evolution and strongly - correlated dynamics @xcite .
the goal of this section is to show that the time scale of @xmath01  @xmath1s , which roughly corresponds to the inverse width of the spin noise power in zero magnetic field , is in agreement with a simple theory of how nuclear co - flips lead to central spin relaxation
. we will also highlight differences between this theory and the observed behavior of noise power spectrum at longer time scales .
consider the effective hamiltonian of a single hole spin interacting with @xmath101 nuclear spins , in the presence of an applied out - of - plane ( longitudinal ) magnetic field @xmath23 .
we have @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath104 stands for the hole spin operator , @xmath105 is the @xmath106-th nuclear spin operator , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the coupling strengths , out - of - plane and in - plane respectively , between the central spin and nuclear spins . we assume , for simplicity , that all spins are @xmath109 , and @xmath107 and @xmath108 are in the same ratio as the ratio of longitudinal and transverse hole g - factors , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . thus , @xmath107 is about ten times greater than @xmath108 .
note that in general @xmath110 is complex , reflecting the fact that transverse coupling involves both @xmath111 and @xmath112 spin components , but as this does not influence the following discussion we treat these couplings as real positive parameters .
the large value of @xmath113 and the coupling anisotropy enable a perturbative approach @xcite , in which the zeroth order wave function of a typical state can be approximated to be the eigenstate of the total spin operator along @xmath114-axis , for example ,      where @xmath116 or @xmath117 indicates the state of the hole central spin ( up or down along @xmath114-axis ) and other arrows show states of the nuclear spins .
we will call the expectation value of operator @xmath118 in the state @xmath119 the _ bias _ , and we will denote it by @xmath120 . we will show that this part of the hyperfine coupling resists the flip - flop transitions .
diffusive dynamics of the overhauser field @xmath3 are possible because the couplings of central spin to different nuclear spins are not equal so that exchanging direction of a pair of nuclear spins changes the bias value by the amount @xmath121 . according to the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , such pair - wise co - flips of nuclear spins happen due to transitions through the virtual states with a flipped central spin .
the accumulation of pair - wise nuclear spin - flips leads to diffusion in the space of overhauser field values .
the expectation value of the central spin follows the direction of the overhauser field .
when the bias changes across the region with @xmath122 , the variation of this direction becomes substantial , corresponding to the relaxation of the central spin expectation value .
there is no direct coupling between the state ( [ zero - order ] ) and the state @xmath123 where @xmath124 means that nuclear spins @xmath106 and @xmath125 change their directions in comparison to the state @xmath126 .
therefore , to estimate the rate of nuclear spin co - flips we use first order perturbation theory to incorporate transitions to the virtual states in our wave functions : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and where @xmath129 means that @xmath106-th nuclear spin is flipped from up to down state , and @xmath130 ensures a normalization .
this definition of a typical state @xmath119 includes fast transition processes to the virtual states @xmath131 .
one can see that @xmath132 already directly couples states @xmath119 and @xmath133 .
further perturbation expansion breaks down because there are many states @xmath133 with almost the same energy as the initial state @xmath134 .
the presence of such quasi - degenerate states leads to incoherent transitions from @xmath126 into one of the states @xmath135 .
the rate @xmath136 of such transitions can be estimated by fermi s golden rule as follows : there are @xmath137 pairs of distinct states @xmath138 ( again , we are considering spin 1/2 nuclei for convenience ) , distributed around the mean value with interval of energies @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the width of the distribution of @xmath141 around their mean value .
thus the rate , @xmath142 , of an incoherent transition from the initial state @xmath134 to one of the states @xmath133 that differ from @xmath134 by co - flips of two nuclear spins is given by      where @xmath144 is the density of states represented by all possible pairs @xmath145 , and @xmath146 is the strength of a typical coupling between states @xmath145 and the state @xmath119 , _
i.e. _ @xmath147 .
we use @xmath148 , where according to various estimates , @xmath149 3 - 13 @xmath1ev @xcite is the hyperfine coupling per nuclear spin per unit probability of the hole being in the unit cell that contains this nuclear spin .
the factor @xmath150 is the ratio of volumes of the unit cell @xmath151 ( 0.57  nm)@xmath31 to the volume of the quantum dot , @xmath152 2000  nm@xmath31 .
hence @xmath153 and @xmath154 s@xmath155 .
the fastest spin relaxation happens in states that have initial bias @xmath156 because such states experience comparable couplings along longitudinal ( along @xmath114-axis ) and transverse axes . in such states , changes in total field along
@xmath114-axis ( also the bias @xmath120 ) leads to a substantial change of the orientation of the total field that acts on the hole s spin .
if we consider a state with initial @xmath120 close to @xmath157 we find from ( [ gam ] ) that the typical time of an incoherent transition between states that differ by a co - flip energy is @xmath158 s.    this time @xmath159 should not be confused with a hole s spin relaxation time @xmath8 because a single co - flip does not lead to a substantial change of the total hyperfine field .
moreover , such random transitions can lead both to an increase or a decrease of @xmath120 .
however , accumulation of co - flip transitions leads to a diffusion in the space of bias values .
hence the latter changes with time according to the diffusion law :    @xmath160 where the coefficient @xmath107 reflects the fact that a single co - flip corresponds to a change of the bias of order @xmath107 .
the hole s spin rotation angle becomes of order unity when the change of the bias becomes comparable to the initial bias , @xmath161 .
this gives us an estimate of the hole s spin relaxation time : @xmath162 the experimentally obtained value , @xmath163 ns , is in very reasonable agreement with this estimate .
here we note , however , that the region of bias values with @xmath156 , accounts for only about 10% of statistically possible states of the nuclear spin bath .
when @xmath120 exceeds the size of this region , incoherent flip - flop transition rate is suppressed , as it can be seen from the fact that @xmath120 enters as a second power in the denominator in equation ( [ gam ] ) .
thus , for values of @xmath164 , the flip - flop transition rate is suppressed by a factor 100 , in disagreement with the assumption of a single relaxation time for all quantum dots , which is expected from the lorentzian shape of the power spectrum .
dipole interactions between nuclear and central spins allow additional coupling terms in the interaction hamiltonian , such as @xmath165 that could contribute to the nuclear spin dynamics , but such terms were estimated to be negligibly small for heavy - hole states in quantum dots @xcite .
it is also possible that strains and nonuniform doping introduce high gradients of local electric fields that couple to quadrupole moment of nuclear spins .
quadrupole nuclear interactions with nonuniform electric field often broaden the solid state nmr - lineshapes of nuclei to the mhz range @xcite .
such interactions do not directly involve the central spin but , if sufficiently strong , they can induce fast intrinsic dynamics of nuclear spins and stir fluctuations of the overhauser field across its typical values .
it is possible that , supplemented by fast incoherent co - flip processes near the zero bias values , such fluctuations lead to the relaxation of the central spin at a fraction of a microsecond .    finally , we discuss consequences for the case of nonzero applied fields @xmath23 .
according to our theory , the window of overhauser field values that allow fast spin relaxation due to co - flips corresponds to @xmath166 .
the average number of quantum dots that happen to have the hyperfine field inside this narrow window at same moment of time follows the gaussian distribution of the hyperfine field @xmath167 .
consequently , this number is suppressed when @xmath168 , while the relative contribution to power spectrum from the states having the bias far from the fast relaxation window increases with @xmath23 .
hence , the width of the noise power spectrum should quickly decrease with @xmath23 when @xmath168 , in agreement with the experimental data .
