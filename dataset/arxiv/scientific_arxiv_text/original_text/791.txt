here we show that if one uses an isotropic exchange interaction instead of the anisotropic interactions in the teleportation protocol one can also perform adiabatic teleportation . in this case
the initial hamiltonian is @xmath90\end{aligned}\ ] ] and the final hamiltonian is @xmath91\end{aligned}\ ] ] where we have expressed these hamiltonians in terms of the encoded operations given in eq . 1 of the main text .
these equations show that now instead of two decoupled encoded qubits , the encoded qubits are coupled .
however notice that the initial ground state is the @xmath92 eigenstate of @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the final ground state is the @xmath92 eigenstate of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 , just as in anisotropic exchange protocol , but with the signs flipped .
further there are no level crossing in a linear ramping between these two hamiltonians , and the gap is a constant @xmath93 occurring at the midpoint of this evolution .
thus the adiabatic teleportation protocol caries through for the isotropic exchange .
notice , importantly , that the coupling however must be antiferromagnetic .
here we provide more details on how to implement the hamiltonian in eq . 4 in the main text using the perturbation theory gadgets of bartlett and rudolph  @xcite .
in these gadgets , one replaces one of the qubits in a three - qubit interaction by an _ encoded _
qubit across two qubits .
since we need two three - qubit interactions , this means that we require two extra qubits in this construction .
we label our logical qubits @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( for left and right ) , and encode each into four physical qubits labeled 1  4 .     and @xmath95 , each encoded in three physical qubits @xmath96 , where the ancillas facilitate the teleportation as discussed in the main text .
blue bars represent @xmath97 couplings , while green triangles represent interactions of the form @xmath98 ( and similarly with @xmath99 ) as in eq .
( [ e : ideal ] ) .
]    let s recall eq .
4 , relabeled here as in fig .
[ f : ideal ] .
the ideal initial hamiltonian is @xmath100 , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath101 $ ] just means to add the terms which exchange the qubits @xmath94 and @xmath95 .
now let s add the ancilla qubits and move to the encoded subspace .
the encoded subspaces we are working in are the subspaces spanned by @xmath102 and @xmath103 on qubits @xmath104 and @xmath83 .
we can force the joint state of qubits 3 and 4 to lie in this subspace by adding a strong @xmath105 coupling term to the ideal hamiltonian .
thus , eq .  ( [ e : ideal ] ) can be realized using encoded operators as the following target hamiltonian @xmath106 . \end{aligned}\ ] ] here the encoded operators ( with bars on top ) are @xmath107 for both the left and right qubits and we are assuming that the coupling strengths satisfy @xmath108 .
we are free to choose either @xmath109 or @xmath110 for the encoded @xmath111 operation because these operators act equivalently up to multiplication by the stabilizer of the encoded subspace . writing this out in terms of the pauli operators on the physical qubits , we find ( for one such choice of encoded @xmath5 ) @xmath112 .\end{aligned}\
] ] following bartlett and rudolph , we use the following initial hamiltonian .
it is a two - body gadget hamiltonian that simulates the low energy behavior of the above target hamiltonian , and is given by @xmath113 .\end{aligned}\ ] ] the @xmath9 term in this hamiltonian by itself would force the ground state of qubits @xmath104 and @xmath83 to be in the subspace spanned by @xmath102 and @xmath103 as discussed above .
the @xmath71 term is now a two - qubit interaction which simulates the four - body term in the target hamiltonian .
our desired final hamiltonian is given by @xmath114 .\end{aligned}\ ] ] notice , importantly , that we leave on the interaction which forces qubits @xmath104 and @xmath83 into the encoded subspace during the entire evolution . as usual , our total evolution is given in terms of the scaled time @xmath19 by @xmath115 this evolution is depicted in fig .
[ f : gadget ] .
we must show that the above adiabatic evolution has high fidelity with the ideal evolution and that the gap is not too small .
the fidelity is governed by the overlap of the ground state of @xmath10 with the ground state of the ideal ( encoded ) hamiltonian @xmath116 .    .
the simulation gadget uses one additional ancilla qubit ( labeled @xmath83 ) per logical qubit .
qubits @xmath104 and @xmath83 are bound by strong @xmath117 couplings for the duration of the evolution , as shown by the broad green bars .
blue bars represent two - body interactions @xmath118 , while the red horizontal bar represents a @xmath119 coupling .
when the coupling strengths are chosen so that @xmath120 , this adiabatic evolution simulates the ideal evolution of eq .
( [ e : ideal ] ) and fig .
[ f : ideal ] .
the fidelity of the simulation is @xmath121 and the energy gap governing the adiabatic condition is given by @xmath122 . ]    in order to analyze this gadget it is useful to perform a change of basis .
in particular if one undoes the controlled - phase gate between the ancilla qubits @xmath123 and @xmath124 , then above hamiltonian becomes a sum of terms acting separately on @xmath94 and @xmath95 .
since this is a unitary conjugation it does nt change the gap , and we can also find the ground state in this basis and transform back . since the hamiltonian is now decoupled across @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we drop these subscripts now and write the transformed initial hamiltonian as @xmath125 note that the final hamiltonian is unaffected by this transformation , and so we need merely to drop the @xmath94 and @xmath95 superscripts to obtain @xmath126    let s first find the ground state of the initial hamiltonian so we can check the fidelity .
we can further simplify things by applying a controlled - not gate from qubit 3 to qubit 2 resulting in @xmath127 in this basis , qubits 1 and 2 completely decouple , and the fidelity depends only on the overlap of this ground state with the bell state @xmath128 on qubits 3 and 4 .
we can exactly diagonalize by first transforming to the bell basis .
let s define @xmath129 to be our small expansion parameter .
then the ground state of eq .
( [ e : twoprimes ] ) on qubits 3 and 4 is given by @xmath130 where the coefficient @xmath131 is @xmath132 expanding in powers of @xmath129 , the fidelity is @xmath133 which is corrected at second order in @xmath134
.    now let s compute the gap to see what price we must pay to achieve high fidelity .
in the basis where we have applied a controlled - not from qubit 3 to qubit 2 , the final hamiltonian is @xmath135 note that @xmath136 and @xmath137 commute with both the initial and final hamiltonian , corresponding to the encoded quantum information .
suppose we work in a basis where this information is in the @xmath22 eigenstate of @xmath136 .
then the final hamiltonian simplifies to @xmath138 here we see that qubits @xmath88 and @xmath84 are decoupled from those of @xmath104 and @xmath83 .
if one linearly sweeps between these initial and final hamiltonians , one will obtain a minimal gap for each of these evolutions .
the smaller of these gaps comes from qubits @xmath104 and @xmath83 .
explicitly , the evolution to consider is @xmath139 -s [ \lambda   z_3 + \omega ( z_3 z_4)].\ ] ] the gap between the lowest two eigenvalues of this evolution is @xmath140 where @xmath141 using the fact that @xmath142 for @xmath143 we can bound this as @xmath144 we can upper bound the lower equation by @xmath145 , and we can use @xmath146 for @xmath147 to express the gap as @xmath148 this obtains its max at @xmath149 for @xmath150 this yields a bound on the gap of @xmath151    thus we have shown that the initial fidelity with the proper ground state is high @xmath152 , and also that the energy scale which sets the adiabatic condition is set by the perturbative energy scale , @xmath153 . for fault - tolerance we require a fixed accuracy and our results imply that the gadget construction can achieve this , albeit at the cost of the energy gap shrinking and thus a slower adiabatic gate time .
