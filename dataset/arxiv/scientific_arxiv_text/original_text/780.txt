numerical simulations were performed with the open - source qiwib implementation of mctdhb @xcite , using standard runge kutta time evolution and representing spatial derivatives with five point stencil finite differences . for the @xmath65 ground - state results in figs .
( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we have performed simulations on a 1400 point equidistant grid with different values of the coupling constant @xmath77 using @xmath78 as the computational box length for @xmath79 and @xmath80 for stronger interactions . while for @xmath67
, we have used a 2000 point equidistant grid with @xmath78 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for stronger interactions . for the time - evolution of the com variance
, we have used 600 point equidistant grid with @xmath83 for both @xmath55 and @xmath40 simulations .
we have assured ourselves that the results are converged with respect to changes in these parameters and those of time and space discretization .
in addition , we have compared the qiwib results against an independent implementation of mctdhb @xcite , which produced identical results at the reported accuracy .
the simulations of the quench dynamics are performed in two steps : ( 1 ) relaxation to the ground state of the harmonic trap and ( 2 ) time propagation after turning off the trap .
it follows from very general principles that observables linked only to the com wave function are independent of the interaction strength for at most harmonic potentials or constant gauge fields .
here we demonstrate this explicitly for the com variance and a many particle system governed by the hamiltonian of eq .
( 1 ) . for this purpose
we write an arbitrary initial quantum state as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a complete basis set which depends only on the com and @xmath86 is a complete basis set which depends on the @xmath13 relative motion degrees - of - freedom .
we further write the time evolution of the many - body wavefunction as ( @xmath87 ) @xmath88 in eq .  , the total hamiltonian was written as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the com hamiltonian and the remaining terms , including the interaction - dependent operators , form @xmath91 .
then we can explicitly write @xmath92 the dynamics of the second moment of the com wave function is obtained as @xmath93 from the last line of eq .
it can be seen that the result is independent of the interaction strength during the time evolution .
the time evolution of the com variance thus depends only on the initial state ( through the expansion coefficients @xmath94 ) and the external potential through the com hamiltonian @xmath90 .
this fact can be used as a sanity check for mctdhb simulations , which , if fully converged , should produce the same time evolution for the com variance for different values of the interaction strength .
the ground state of @xmath65 particles in a time - independent harmonic trap with frequency @xmath38 is described by a product of the center - of - mass ( com ) and relative motion wave functions : @xmath95 .
the analytical form of the com wave function is @xmath96 where @xmath97 . on the other hand ,
the relative motion wave function with the normalization constant @xmath98 and harmonic oscillator length scale , @xmath99 , can be obtained as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the relative coordinate , @xmath102 is the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind and @xmath103 comes from the discontinuity in the first derivative due to the delta interaction @xcite .
explicitly , @xmath103 is calculated by solving the transcendental equation @xmath104 the ground - state energy is given by @xmath105 and the exact results for the natural occupancy are obtained by numerically diagonalizing of the single particle density matrix @xmath106    after turning off the trap , the gaussian com wave function expands .
in particular , the time evolution of the com wave function represents the textbook example of gaussian wave propagation @xcite @xmath107 } \biggr).\end{aligned}\ ] ] the com wave function spreads leading to a variance increasing quadratically in time @xmath108.\ ] ] the relative motion after trap release , on the other hand , is dominated by the bound state of the attractive @xmath109 interactions . indeed
, since the @xmath109 function has exactly one bound state , near the origin the relative motion wave function will approach this bound state in the long time - limit and possible other contributions from scattering state will disperse . the initial relative motion wave function can be expressed in terms of the bound state and scattering states : @xmath110 , where the bound state is @xmath111 .
then , the expected variance of the relative motion wave function in the long time limit must be @xmath112 .
in the main text we have demonstrated the ambiguity of the studying the eigenvalues of the single - particle density matrix , the natural occupations , for a specific mctdhb simulation . for @xmath65 particles we are able to vary the number of modes @xmath0 over a good range , which permits a conventional study of convergence with respect to mode number .
it is further possible to analyse the shape of the two - particle wave function in the mctdhb approximation , which sheds some light on the unphysical coupling of relative and com motion in the truncated multi - mode expansion .
we test the convergence by checking whether relevant quantities , e.g.  the variational ground - state energy , remain unchanged as the number of modes @xmath0 is increased .
the results in table  [ tab1 ] are still varying at the level of several percent between @xmath113 and @xmath40 and thus indicate , correctly , that the mctdhb expansion converges very slowly and is not yet fully converged with 10 modes . while this way of testing convergence is reliable and has produced the correct answer , varying @xmath0 from one to ten modes is a luxury that can only be afforded for small particle numbers @xmath5 . in simulations with hundreds to thousands of particles ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the options for choosing @xmath0 are severely limited due to the unfavorable scaling of numerical effort when both @xmath5 and @xmath0 are large .

. figure  [ fig : r2r2 ] compares the com variance from mctdhb calculations with the exact result @xmath120 from eq .
( 2 ) of the main text .
it is apparent that the mctdhb results deviate severely from the exact values for strongly attractive interaction , and that convergence of the mctdhb expansion with increasing the number of modes @xmath0 is exceedingly slow .
( symbols ) .
the solid horizontal line denotes the exact ground - state com variance @xmath120 . for comparison
, the dash - dotted line shows the exact relative - coordinate variance @xmath121 of the two - particle bound state . ]    in fig .
[ fig : m5m10gspop ] , we present the dependence of the natural occupation on the interaction parameter .
a couple of remarks pointing to the ambiguity of this convergence indicator are in order .
first , by looking at the results for @xmath40 and @xmath122 one is tempted to conclude that mctdhb has already converged since three orbitals are below @xmath123 .
but , we know from fig .  [ fig : r2r2 ] that for the same interaction strength the mctdhb com variance is still far from the exact value .
second , it can be seen that all the natural occupations , except for the highest one , are shifted up as the number of single - particle modes @xmath0 is increased .
this further exemplifies the failure of the convergence requirement based on the lowest occupancy .
for example , the 5th lowest natural occupation at @xmath124 is below @xmath125 for @xmath126 , while this is not true for @xmath40 , where the 5th single - particle mode is now above the cut - off value .     for ( a ) @xmath126 and ( b ) @xmath40 .
the dashed horizontal line denotes the convergence criterion of @xmath127 . ]
lastly , we look at the rate of convergence for observables , in particular the ground state energy and the single - particle density variance , as depicted in fig .  [ fig : convm ] .
we find that the mctdhb results approach the exact values with a slow power law as a function of the number of single - particle modes @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath128 .
the empirical exponent @xmath103 lies between @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which indicates slightly faster convergence than the @xmath130 leading exponent of the full - ci expansion of two 1d bosons with point interaction in a fixed harmonic oscillator basis @xcite .
we note that this power - law behavior only sets in for mode numbers larger than @xmath131 in this case and the convergence rate is significantly slower for smaller @xmath0 .
this may be because the variational optimisation of the modes is particularly effective for small @xmath0 .
it also means , however , that in the pre - power - law regime of @xmath132 increasing the number of modes brings even less effect than the empirical power law would suggest that governs larger regimes of @xmath0 .
unfortunately , for particle numbers in the hundreds or larger , the scaling of computational resources practically limits the application of mctdhb exactly to the small @xmath0 regime .     for @xmath124 : ( a ) ground - state energy and ( b ) single - particle density variance . dashed horizontal lines correspond to the exact values .
symbols denote the mctdhb results for different @xmath0 .
the exponent of the power law fit , @xmath103 , is also shown .
( inset ) log - log plot of the absolute difference between the exact and mctdhb results . ]      in order to understand how mctdhb deals with the competing length scales and why it violates the separation of com and relative motion , it is instructive to plot the two particle density , as shown in fig .
[ fig:2body ] for @xmath65 .
in these plots , the diagonal ( @xmath133 ) represents the com coordinate @xmath134 and the antidiagonal ( @xmath135 ) the relative motion coordinate @xmath136 .
while the left hand panels relate to the ground state of @xmath137 , the right hand panels relate to a later time @xmath138 after trap release . here
the com wave function has expanded significantly according to eq .
, whereas the relative - motion bound state is hardly changed .
the upper two panels show the exact result and panel ( b ) clearly demonstrates the diverging length scales .
note the changing spatial scale between panels ( a ) and ( b ) .
the middle panels ( c ) and ( d ) present the @xmath1 ( gross - pitaevskii ) result . at this level ,
the com and relative motion length scales are identical because the product form of the state with a single mode function @xmath139 together with the inversion symmetry of the problem forces a four - fold symmetry and leaves no option to distinguish the two diagonal directions . for long times
, the wave function expands in both directions and the com and relative motion length scales are identical .
the lower panels ( e ) and ( f ) report an mctdhb simulation with @xmath126 modes .
the trapped ground state in [ fig:2body](e ) is approximated better than with @xmath1 , although some more detailed features are missing . the long - time profile in fig .
[ fig:2body](f ) shows five separated peaks with each one exhibiting a four - fold symmetry and resembling the @xmath1 result , albeit on a different scale . as the mctdhb expansion is a sum over symmetrized product states , different numbers of modes @xmath0 will produce up to @xmath0 peaks with diagonal  off diagonal symmetry .
thus for given @xmath0 , the com and relative motion are strongly coupled and expansion dynamics , where the com length scale grows over time , will not be captured correctly . furthermore , this discretised behavior due to finite @xmath0 leads to an impractical number of @xmath0 needed to correctly model the limit of a delocalised com but localised relative motion .     for @xmath137 at different times : left [ ( a),(c),(e ) ] @xmath140 and right [ ( b),(d),(f ) ] @xmath141 .

in this section , we are going to prove the bounds for the variance of the exact single - particle density manifested in the shaded region in fig . 4 of the main text .
for systems with a hamiltonian that is separable in the com and relative motion coordinate , we can conveniently introduce the following change - of - variables for the com coordinate @xmath134 : @xmath142 and for the relative motion coordinate with @xmath143 @xcite : @xmath144 this means that the many - body wave function is given by @xmath145 this allows us to write the single - particle density profile as @xmath146 where , @xmath147 and @xmath148 note that we can express @xmath149 as : @xmath150 then we can transform the integration from @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the corresponding jacobian .
the single - particle density becomes @xmath153 the @xmath154 integrations over @xmath155 can now be done separately and be used to define a new function @xmath156 which allows us to write the single - particle density as @xmath157 one can see that indeed the single - particle density profile is just a convolution between the @xmath158 and another function @xmath159 that is associated with the relative - motion wave function .
the function @xmath160 can be further interpreted as the mean - density for a fixed com position .
this can be justified by following ref .
we write the single - particle density in this case as @xmath161 the integration over @xmath162 can be easily done due to the presence of the @xmath109-function leading to @xmath163 again we transform the integration variables using eq .   such that @xmath164 , where we define @xmath165 this yields @xmath166
lastly , we integrate over the @xmath167 to find that indeed @xmath160 is equal to @xmath168 , @xmath169    it is straightforward to show that the variances add in a convolution provided that at least one of the functions is centered at the origin ( in our case the com wave function ) : @xmath170 where @xmath171 , @xmath172 and the functions @xmath173 and @xmath160 are normalized to unity . from eq .  , it can be deduced that the width of the exact single - particle density will always be greater than the width of the com wave function , @xmath174 and the equality is satisfied in the limit of large interaction coupling @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) .
moreover , the variance of the relative motion density for an untrapped state is smaller than the untrapped case , i.e. , @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is an excellent approximation of the untrapped relative motion variance that becomes exact for large @xmath5 @xcite .
this means that the bounds for the exact single - particle density must be @xmath179    9ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ]
