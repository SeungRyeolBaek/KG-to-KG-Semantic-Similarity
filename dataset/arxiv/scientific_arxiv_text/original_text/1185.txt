* ecori binding to dna . * * ( a ) * unfolding / refolding force - distance curves of a dna hairpin in the absence ( magenta / black ) and presence ( blue / cyan ) of ecori protein .
the bound ( @xmath9 ) and unfolded ( @xmath10 ) states are discriminated at high force by the presence of two distinct force branches . * ( b ) * cyclic pulling curves classified according to their initial ( blue dot ) and final state ( cyan dot ) that start and end at a high force ( @xmath221 pn ) .
work equals the enclosed area between the two curves and is shown in dark / light gray for positive / negative values . *
( c ) * paths of a non - equilibrium cyclic protocol connecting different initial and final states . * ( d ) * partial work distributions of @xmath13 ( green ) and @xmath14 ( magenta ) transitions at different ecori concentrations . * ( e ) * binding energy of ecori ( blue ) and fit to the law of mass action ( red line ) at ( 130 mm @xmath51 , @xmath52c , @xmath53 m ) . *
( f ) * binding energy of ecori at varying [ nacl ] ( 1 nm ecori ) .
error bars were obtained from bootstrap using 1000 re - samplings of size n ( n is total number of pulls for each condition shown in tables s1 and s3 ) .
* oligo binding to dna . * * ( a ) * scheme of native ( @xmath8 ) , unfolded ( @xmath10 ) and oligo bound ( @xmath9 ) states . *
( b ) * cyclic pulling curves that start and end at low forces ( @xmath26 pn ) classified according to their initial ( blue dot ) and final state ( cyan dot ) . * ( c ) * partial work distributions of @xmath54 ( green ) and @xmath55 ( magenta ) transitions . *
( d ) * binding energy of the 10-base oligo ( blue ) and fit to the law of mass action ( red line ) .
the value obtained from hopping equilibrium experiments at [ oligo]=400 nm ( see s1.7 in @xcite ) is shown in cyan .

error bars were obtained from bootstrap as described in fig . 1 .
* binding specificity , allostery and kinetic stabilization of misfolded states for the peptide echinomycin . * * ( a ) * first rupture force distribution of hairpins sp ( red ) and nsp ( blue ) in the absence ( light ) and presence ( dark ) of echinomycin . * ( b ) * binding energy of echinomycin to a specific ( red ) and nonspecific ( blue ) site , and fit to the law of mass action . * ( c ) * hairpins c and nc contain two specific binding sites ( red boxes ) placed contiguously or separated by 2-bp respectively . binding energy per ligand when one ( blue ) or two ligands ( green ) are bound to hairpins
nc or c ( magenta ) ( [ echninomycin]=3 @xmath45 m ) .
gaussian distributions are reconstructed from mean and variance of measurements .
the wider distribution for the single bound state in hairpin nc ( blue ) is due to the lower number of paths reaching this state at high ligand concentration , increasing measurement error . *
( d ) * pulling cycle of hairpin m in the presence of echinomycin .
the unfolding curve ( blue ) shows two force rips at @xmath57 pn corresponding to the unbinding of two ligands bound to specific sites . in the refolding curve ( cyan )
, the hairpin does not fold back to the native state , and misfolds into a kinetically stabilized configuration of longer molecular extension ( @xmath58 of refolding curves at [ echninomycin]=10 @xmath45 m ) .
error bars were obtained from bootstrap as described in fig . 1 .
the ftlb is derived following the same steps as in @xcite . consider a system with a fluctuating number of particles @xmath8 , which correspond to the ligand molecules .
the system evolves under an experimental protocol @xmath59 , where @xmath6 denotes the control parameter and in our case corresponds to the position of the optical trap relative to the pipette .
we discretize in time the protocol as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) denotes the value of @xmath6 at the time of the protocol @xmath63 ( being @xmath64 the time discretization unit ) , and @xmath65 denotes the duration of the protocol . along the protocol @xmath59 the system follows a given trajectory @xmath66 , where a sequence of configurations @xmath67 are sampled .
the trajectory can be discretized as @xmath68 .
each configuration @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) is characterized by the number of particles , @xmath71 , and the degrees of freedom of each particle .    the equilibrium probability to be in a given configuration @xmath69 at @xmath6
can be written , according to the grand - canonical ensemble , as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( being @xmath74 the boltzmann constant and @xmath5 the absolute temperature ) , @xmath75 is the fugacity of the system ( equal to @xmath76 , being @xmath45 the chemical potential of the ligand molecules ) , @xmath77 is the grand canonical partition function , and @xmath78 is the energy of the configuration @xmath69 at @xmath6 .    we suppose that the dynamics of the system satisfy the following detailed balance condition : @xmath79 therefore , the probability of the system to follow a given trajectory @xmath66 ( without imposing any initial and final configuration ) , and the probability to follow its time reversed @xmath80 is : [ eq : 1 ] @xmath81 where @xmath82 .
we assume that in the forward protocol @xmath59 the system starts in partial equilibrium at @xmath83 , while in the reversed protocol @xmath84 it starts in partial equilibrium at @xmath85 ( and @xmath86 ) .
the partial equilibrium probability density function of a given configuration @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a subset of configurations accessible by the system , can be written as @xcite :        suppose that the system starts in non - equilibrium conditions .
particularly , the system starts in partial equilibrium at the kinetic state @xmath92 in the forward trajectory and at at the kinetic state @xmath93 in the reversed one .
a kinetic state is a partially equilibrated region of configurational space , meaning that during a finite amount of time the system is confined and thermalized within that region .
this is mathematically described by a boltzmann - gibbs distribution restricted to configurations contained in that region . then :                  experiments are performed with a highly stable miniaturized dual - beam optical tweezers described in previous studies  @xcite .
the dna hairpins are tethered between two beads by using short dsdna handles ( 29-bp ) that are differentially end - labelled with biotin and digoxigenin to attach each handle to a different bead ( see supp .
section  [ sec : summary of dna hairpins used in this work ] for hairpin sequences and synthesis details )  @xcite .
pulling speed is set at 190 nm / s in all the experiments . for the ecori experiments , longer dsdna handles ( @xmath2600-bp ) are used to reduce nonspecific interactions mediated by the protein and beads . for these experiments ,
the microfluidics chamber was also coated with poly(ethylene glycol ) ( peg ) to avoid protein loss due to nonspecific absorption on the glass surface  @xcite . experimental conditions for each interaction were chosen to be comparable to previous ensemble and single - molecule studies : for ecori ( hepes 10 mm ph7.5 , edta 1 mm , nacl 130 mm , bsa 0.1 mg / ml , 100 @xmath45 m , dtt , 0.01% nan@xmath103 ) and salt titrated in the range 60 - 180 mm nacl ; for the oligonucleotide ( tris 10 mm ph7.5 , edta 1 mm , 100 mm nacl , 0.01% nan@xmath103 ) ; and for echinomycin ( tris 10 mm ph7.5 , edta 1 mm , 100 mm nacl , 2% dmso , 0.01% nan@xmath103 ) .
all ligands were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification : ecori ( new england biolabs , 100 u/@xmath45l , @xmath2800 nm dimer ) , oligonucleotide ( eurofins mwg operon , hypur grade ) , echinomycin ( merck millipore ) .
concentrations were confirmed using a spectrophotometric analysis for the oligonucleotide ( extinction coefficient 97400 m@xmath104cm@xmath104 at @xmath6=260 nm ) and echinomycin ( extinction coefficient 11500 m@xmath104cm@xmath104 at @xmath6=325 nm ) , whereas for ecori we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using previously described protocols  @xcite .
all experiments were performed at 25 . in all the cases , the number of cycles obtained per molecule range between 20 and 1300 .
a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 10 molecules were pulled in each case ( see tables [ tab : ecori n ] , [ tab : ecori n sal ] , [ tab : oligo n ] , [ tab : echi
n ] , [ tab : echins n ] , [ tab : echi c nc n ] [ tab : echi m n ] ) .
