[ fig2 ] time - dependence of the activity for @xmath42 and various values of @xmath13 .
the system size is @xmath72 . concerning the statistical error we observe that all runs using different random numbers yield curves that are indistinguishable on this scale .
[ fig3 ] determination of @xmath43 : the system size is @xmath73 , @xmath42 and @xmath68 ( lower curve ) , @xmath57 ( middle curve ) and @xmath74 ( upper curve ) .
the straight line in the middle is the function @xmath75 .
we conclude that @xmath76 .
[ fig5 ] time - dependence of the distance for @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( lower curve ) , @xmath69 ( upper curve ) .
the system size is @xmath79 .
the curve for @xmath69 shows that @xmath80 is well inside the chaotic region , whereas @xmath81 lies within the frozen phase .
this fact stronly supports reentrance .
the emerging phase diagram in the vicinity of the tricritical point is depticted in the insert  the two black dots represent the parameter values for the two curves shown .
