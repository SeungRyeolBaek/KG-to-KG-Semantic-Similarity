here we give the details of the calculation of the proximity induced amplitudes @xmath146 .
because the superconductor is only weakly coupled through the tunnel barrier @xmath52 , we can derive an effective 1d model via low - order quasi - degenerate perturbation theory .
we split @xmath147 into two parts , where @xmath59 is diagonal in the eigenbasis @xmath37 , and @xmath148 $ ] .
since @xmath62 is diagonal in spin and valley , we suppress the indices @xmath149 in the following . to first order in @xmath62 , @xmath150 and to second order , @xmath151                          \notag\\&\hspace{.5cm}\times                          \int dx{\tilde\phi}^{0\dagger}_{p_x , p_y}(x)h_1(x )                          \phi^{0,n'}_{p_y}(x ) ,          \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath152 are the unperturbed free states above the gap @xmath153 with real @xmath154 and @xmath32 at energy @xmath155 .
we impose the quantization condition @xmath156 and normalize the extended wavefunctions according to @xmath157 .
the quantization length @xmath101 and the highest momentum @xmath154 are increased until the second order matrix elements converge . to study cooper pair transport only the parts of @xmath158 , @xmath159 are relevant which are proportional to @xmath160 , i.e. , they mix electron and hole states and therefore change the particle number .
the relevant momenta @xmath32 are close to the crossing of the respective electron and hole band ( see the discussion on approximate momentum conservation in the main text ) .
this can involve one band , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , or both , @xmath163 , where @xmath164 are the fermi points of the unperturbed dispersion , eq .  .      the linearized subgap dispersion , eq .
, reads @xmath165 around the fermi points and @xmath166 around zero momentum . the coefficients @xmath167 and @xmath168 used in the transport calculation , e.g. , eq .
, can be read off immediately .      in the most general case
the incoming holes in a nsn junction can be transmitted @xmath169 , reflected @xmath170 , or undergo local ( @xmath171 or crossed ( @xmath172 ) andreev reflection .
the outgoing state is @xmath173 rewriting the hole operators @xmath174 in terms of electron operators @xmath175 , and the fermi sea @xmath131 in terms of the lowered fermi sea @xmath128 as explained in eq .   in the main text
, we arrive at      the first line contains the product state contributions , the second line local pairs , and the third line nonlocal pairs . in the conventional reflection - dominated case , @xmath177 , realized in y - junction cooper pair splitters , the leading order contributions are @xmath178\ket{}_{\delta\mu } ,          \end{aligned}\ ] ]
i.e. , lar produces local pairs and car produces nonlocal pairs . in the transmission - dominated situation , @xmath179 , the situation is reversed : the leading order is @xmath180\ket{}_{\delta\mu } ,          \end{aligned}\ ] ] so lar produces nonlocal pairs and car produces local pairs . in the situation discussed in the main text , both car and reflection are forbidden , ruling out local pairs to all orders , as long as the valley symmetry is obeyed . generally speaking it is undesirable to have simultaneously strong ordinary reflection and strong lar or to have simultaneously strong transmission and strong car to build a cooper pair splitter useful to create spin entanglement .
the notation becomes more cumbersome , when both subgap bands are considered but the considerations are completely analogous . without superconductivity
the outgoing scattering state is @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the band index . in the presence of the superconductor
, the transmitted holes can change the subgap band from @xmath183 to @xmath184 with an amplitude @xmath185 . like in the one - band case ,
whenever the energy of an incoming electron is such that the spectrum of the s region has a gap , the transmission amplitude @xmath186 is exponentially suppressed with the length of the proximity region , and due to unitarity there is a finite amplitude @xmath187 for the spin-@xmath0 hole to be andreev reflected locally as a spin-@xmath0 electron at energy @xmath134 :          the higher order terms in @xmath138 contain multiple cooper pairs and are not necessarily entangled , e.g. , the @xmath190 contribution is a pure product state in which all states in the left / right lead at energy @xmath191 are occupied .
