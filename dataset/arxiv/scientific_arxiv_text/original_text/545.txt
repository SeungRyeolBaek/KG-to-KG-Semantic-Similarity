in the first place , we note that all the time - evolution free - propagators in eq.(2 ) are retarded , @xmath130 with @xmath131 .
this is so because the time - order prescription on the time integrals implies @xmath132 , hence @xmath133 holds in all the @xmath130 oparators of eq.(2 ) .
it is the time - ordering together with the heaviside function @xmath134 in the integrand of eq.([laeq ] ) that guarantee causality .    substituting in eq.([laeq ] ) the expressions of the operators @xmath135 as sums over normal modes , and making use of the identities @xcite @xmath136 and @xmath137,\label{sm1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] that we will denote by @xmath138 , we can write eq.([laeq ] ) as @xmath139,\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the integrand of the time - ordered integrals is the product of the retarded time - evolution free - propagators , @xmath140 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath141 is the electron charge .
next , integrating in time we end up with @xmath142}}{(k - k_{a})(k - k_{b})(k'-k)}\nonumber\\&+&\frac{\cos{[(\omega'-\omega_{a})t]}}{(k'-k_{a})(k'-k_{b})(k'-k)}\bigr],\label{sm3}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where straightforward application of perturbation theory enforces to taking the principal value ( p.v . ) of the integral in eq.([sm3 ] ) , as intermediate states with energies equal to that of the initial state must be removed from the sums ( integrals in the continuum ) in order to avoid zeros in the denominators , @xmath143 having impossed causality by time - ordering the integrals of eq.([sm2 ] ) and multiplying the integrand by @xmath134 , there is no need to add arbitrarily small imaginary parts @xmath144 to the real poles of the integrand in eq.([sm3 ] ) in order to ensure that the propagators are retarded .
also , we have argued in the letter that spontaneous emission enters at higher order , hence it can not provide imaginary shifts @xmath145 to the real poles of eq.([sm3 ] ) either , in contrast to refs.@xcite .
lastly , the contours of integration for each of the terms of the frequency integrals in the complex plane is univocally determined by the condition @xmath58 .
each term contains complex exponential factors of @xmath93 and @xmath94 of the form @xmath146 , with @xmath147 being generic linear functions of @xmath148 and @xmath13 .
that implies that the integration contours must be closed by infinitely large semi - circles either in the upper half plane for @xmath149 , or in the lower half plane for @xmath150 , which is ultimately determined by the condition @xmath58 .
it is worth mentioning that the integrand of eq.([sm3 ] ) is invariant under the exchange @xmath151 , which implies that the total integral is independent of the order of integration , as expected . and @xmath94 .
] thus , @xmath54 is unambiguously given by eq.([sm3 ] ) .
the final result is given in the eq.(4 ) of the letter .
finally , the causal - adiabatic approximation referred to in the conclusions of the letter corresponds to adding up a factor @xmath152 to the integrand of eq.([sm2 ] ) , with @xmath90 , and to extending the lower limits of the time integrals to @xmath111 . after performing the time
integrals one obtains the @xmath13-independent terms of eq.([sm3 ] ) ( excluding the heaviside function ) with a small imaginary part @xmath153 added to both real poles , @xmath154 we also note that eq.(6 ) in the letter corresponds to the @xmath13-independent terms of eq.([sm3 ] ) of which only the terms proportional to @xmath155 and @xmath156 have been retained in the @xmath157-functions , and in which small imaginary parts @xmath158 have been added to each real pole respectively .

some of the diagrams of fig.([fig1 ] ) discarded provide also terms with poles in both @xmath93 and @xmath94 .
however , after integrated in frequencies , they yield contributions of the order of @xmath160 times smaller than the ones found here , and hence they are negligible . for instance , in diagram @xmath161 this is due to its lack of resonance with the transition of atom @xmath4 , since both photons are simply resonant .
