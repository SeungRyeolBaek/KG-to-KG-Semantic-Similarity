in this supplementary material , we compare the value of the penetration depth obtained from experiments @xcite with the prediction from homes law ; for the latter , we use a combination of the experimental data obtained from optical - conductivity and dc transport . for each value of the doping ( @xmath8 )
, we estimate the ( approximate ) dc resistivity ( @xmath80 ) by extrapolating the curves to @xmath9 , from the transport data in fig.1(b ) of ref.@xcite .
we estimate the value of @xmath81 , where @xmath23 is the superconducting gap , from the data for optical conductivity in the superconducting state , as shown in fig .
3(b ) of ref . @xcite . since @xmath7 remains relatively unchanged as a function of @xmath8 in the vicinity of optimal doping , we assume @xmath82 to be independent of @xmath8 such that @xmath83@xmath84s@xmath85 .
then , in the dirty limit , _ s = _ .    in order to obtain the penetration depth
, we need to restore various dimensionful constants such that , _
l^2(0)= , where @xmath86 m / s ) is the speed of light and @xmath87 f / m ; 1  f=1  @xmath88s ) is the permitivity of free space .
the values obtained are shown in the table below and have been presented in fig . 2 of the main text , along with a comparison to the experimental data @xcite .
