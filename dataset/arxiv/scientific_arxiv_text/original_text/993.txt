the solutions of the helmholtz equation for the right isosceles triangle with sidelength , @xmath3 ( chosen for convenience ) are given by @xmath4 @xmath5 .
this consists of two terms , each being a product of @xmath6 functions . of course
, it can be re - written in a variety of equivalent ways by employing trigonometric identities . with just one term of a product of sine functions ,
the nodal lines are straight lines and they form a checkerboard pattern
. this would be the case also for a product of any other special function .

( [ eq : iso ] ) can be rewritten in a way that will be more useful :    @xmath10 \nonumber \\ & = & \frac{1}{2 } \re { \rm tr~ } \left[\begin{array}{cc } \{e^{i(mx - ny)}-e^{i(mx+ny)}\ } & 0\\ 0 & \{-e^{i(my - nx)}+e^{i(my+nx)}\ } \end{array}\right ] \nonumber \\ & : = & \frac{1}{2 } \re { \rm tr~ } { \mathcal i}. \end{aligned}\ ] ]    all the eigenfunctions can be classified into equivalence classes labelled by @xmath11 @xcite . within each class
, it was shown that the number of domains , @xmath12 for one eigenfunction is related to @xmath13 by a difference equation @xcite .
we can , in fact , write down the operator ( in the matrix form ) which actually takes us along the ladder of states beginning with @xmath14 , up and down .
the matrix is @xmath15.\ ] ]    to confirm , we get the eigenfunction @xmath16 as @xmath17 thus , we have generated all the states beginning anywhere ; note that @xmath18 could be any integer as long as we keep the inequality between the two quantum numbers .
the eigenfunctions of an equilateral triangle of side length @xmath3 , satisfying the dirichlet boundary conditions , can be written as three terms , each a product of trigonometric functions @xcite .
there are two possible solutions - one with cosine and th other with sine functions .
first we discuss the function with cosines : @xmath19 this can be re - written as @xmath20 \nonumber \\ & = & \im \frac{1}{2}{\rm tr~}{\mathcal a}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath21 is @xmath22\end{aligned}\ ] ] the matrix operator for this state is @xmath23\ ] ] similarly for the eigenfunctions written in terms of sine functions , @xmath24 in complex form , it can be re - written as @xmath25\end{aligned}\ ] ] and in matrix form as @xmath26.\ ] ] where @xmath27 is @xmath28\ ] ] the corresponding matrix operator is @xmath23\ ] ] this operator is the same as for the cosine form of the eigenfunctions for equilateral triangle billiard .
the eigenfunctions of separable billiards are a single product of special functions - trigonometric for rectangular billiard , bessel and trigonometric functions for circular billiards ( and related annuli ) , mathieu and trigonometric functions for elliptical billiards ( and annuli ) , and parabolic cylinder functions for confocal parabolic billiards . in all these cases ,
the tower of states can be trivially constructed along the lines described here .
this is because the index that classifies states for all separable billiards is ( @xmath29 ) . for the non - separable billiards described here , we have shown in earlier papers that all the states can be classified by ( @xmath30 ) or ( @xmath31 ) .
here , we have shown that within a class , all the states can be constructed from the energetically lowest state .
we can also make a transformation from an excited state to the lowest state .
we hesitate to call this a ` ground state ' as there will be one lowest state for an index , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .
the results given here are for billiards with dirichlet boundary conditions .
of course , these results are trivially extended to the case of periodic boundary conditions .
the raising and lowering operators will remain the same .
for twisted boundary conditions , these may be generalized by introducing phases in the matrix representation of raising and lowering operators .
