natural hamiltonian systems are the mathematical models of those physical systems for which the motion is linear , for example harmonic oscillators or the electron system . however , as in the previous two examples , more variables are constants of the motion ( or _ _ integrals _ ) : angular momentum , maxwell - runge - lentz vector , etc . usually , these variables are expressed by linear polynomials in the momenta or , for quantum systems , by first - order differential equations . hamiltonian systems with equations of the motion of degree greater than 4 are rarely studied , however , some of them are of great interest , as for example the three - body hamilton - calogero and wolfes system . these systems describe the dynamics of three point - masses on a manifold of forces described by the equations ##s @ xmath4 # ( we do not consider all the ordinary differential equations ) and they have essentially the general form @ xcite . both the resulting natural hamiltonians and @ xmath5 have one linear and one quadratic in the momenta constants of the motion , making the systems liouville - integrable and solvable by functions of variables ( see @ xcite and see below ) . the twoindependent constants of the motion do exist , one rational , due to the multiseparability of the hamiltonian , and one quantum . the systems are called maximally superintegrable ( ms ) , with a number of functionally independent components of the motion equal to all the degrees of freedom , plus symmetry ( for classical systems , the same number of functional independent symmetry breaking ) . ms systems are of the greatest importance in theoretical physics , harmonic ##s and kepler are examples and this allows them to satisfy bertrand russell theorem . moreover , the superintegrability shows itself , for classical systems , in the fact that the spin states of ms systems are ms while , for quantum systems , in the fact that the energy levels are totally degenerate @ xcite . in recent years , new techniques made possible the synthesis of classical and quantum hamiltonian systems , ms and ms , with first integrals of very high order @ xcite whose theory , still under development , produced remarkable results in special functions , quantum mechanics , canonical field theory @ xcite . on this note , we shortly introduced the work on the subject done by claudia chanu , luca degiovanni and the author ( in the cdr )see several other papers . in other words , the following procedure ( called [ teo0 ] ) gives a degree of freedom to some natural hamiltonian @ xmath6 in such a way an extra - linear first integral , also of extension @ xmath7 , of the new hamiltonian do exist . the second definition , given in @ xcite , gives and is what we use for ` ` ' ' ' , the special case of natural hamiltonians on tangent bundles of a manifold ; for a more general definition , see @ xcite . for an @ xmath8 - dimensional natural hamiltonian @ xmath6 on the tangent bundle of a ( pseudo ) - riemannian manifold @ xmath9 , let be @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 where @ xmath12 is the hamiltonian vector field of @ xmath6 , and [ teo0 ] let @ xmath9 be an @ xmath8 - dimensional ( pseudo - ) - manifold with metric space @ xmath13 . the natural hamiltonian @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 with metric coordinates @ xmath16 is an extension @ xmath##17 has the form ( [ hamext ] ) with the first integral @ xmath18 with @ xmath19 replaced by ( [ x ] ) and @ xmath20 , if and only if the following conditions hold : 1 . the functions @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 are @ xmath23 @ xmath24 where @ xmath25 is the identity matrix of @ xmath21 . 2 . for @ xmath26 the extended hamiltonian @ xmath17 and the first integral @ xmath27 for @ xmath28 for @ xmath29 the extended hamiltonian @ xmath17 and the first integral @ xmath27 for @ xmath30 with @ xmath31 , @ xmath32 , @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 . @ xcite it is proved that @ xmath35 is completely different from @ xmath17 , @ xmath6 and the other first integral of @ xmath6 and @ xmath36 . the integrability properties of ( [ hessteo ] ) are proved in @ xcite and it is proved that their total integra##bility of @ xmath37 , where @ xmath31 is the constant curvature of @ xmath9 . however , the function @ xmath20 can depend linearly with respect to @ xmath38 , and the exact set of parameters is known on constant curvature manifolds only . however , the function ##ness can be found on non - constant curvature manifold ( cdr to ##t ) . from equation ( [ vteo ] ) , the expressions of the admissible function @ xmath22 can be obtained . several examples are given in @ xcite . the general ##ization of @ xmath19 makes possible to find any @ xmath35 by taking the @ xmath39 - th column of a matrix , replacing @ xcite @ xmath40 with @ xmath41 } { \ left ( \ begin { matrix } m \ cr 2k \ begin { matrix } \ right ) \ right ^ { 2k } p _ 1 ^ { m - 2k } \ left ( - 2m ( m + p _ 0 ) \ right ) ^ { } , \ ] ] @ xmath42 } { \ left ( \ begin { matrix } m \ cr 2k + p \( { matrix } \ right ) \ left ^ { 2k + 1 } { _ 1 ^ { - - 2k - 1 } \ left ( - 2m ( 1 + 1 _ 0 ) \ right ) ^ { } , \ quad m > 1 , \ ] ] where @ xmath43 $ ] is the constant term and @ xmath44 . we note that first equations of higher degree obtained in other ways than by the extension procedure @ xcite can be properly expressed as due to the fact that the dynamical equations are in these cases given by the coordinate system . for the first example of the extension procedure we consider the two - dimensional hamiltonian @ xcite @ xmath45 the real part of the extended hamiltonian @ xmath17 is @ xmath46 where @ xmath31 is called the constant term of the extended configuration space . the set of equations ( [ hessteo ] ) and ( [ vteo ] ) are @ xmath47 where @ xmath48 . when @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 , the configuration space of @ xmath17 is the euclidean space , the sphere @ xmath51 and the pseudosphere @ xmath##52 ##4 , and for @ xmath53 and @ xmath50 , the minkowski potential , the desitter and anti - desitter potential , respectively . after the change of the coordinate @ xmath54 , the potential @ xmath39 and @ xmath17 transform into @ xmath6 and @ xmath55 this is evident that the extension method introduces some additional symmetry into @ xmath17 , in this case the dihedral symmetry of axis @ xmath56 , and continues with the new first integral @ xmath35 . in the cylindrical coordinates ( i . e . @ xmath57 ) with @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 , @ xmath22 is associated with the jacobi - calogero potential or , equivalently , with the vector field @ xcite . indeed , in cylindrical coordinates of @ xmath5 , @ xmath60 , with axis @ xmath61 parallel to @ xmath62 e . r . to the axis @ xmath63 , we have @ xmath64 the method of extension introduces two new and independent first derivatives to the new hamiltonian @xmath17 : @ xmath17 itself and @ xmath27 . this property is only valid when the hamiltonian @ xmath6 is ms . in this case , @ xmath17 is ms only , with @ xmath65 - independent first derivatives . in @ xcite this system of the hamiltonians is studied in many ways . for example , let us show @ xmath66 that is a special case of the generalized tremblay - turbiner - winternitz system ( ttw ) @ xcite for @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 defined on positive - real curves of degree @ xmath69 . this system is valid for any rational function @ xmath70 and admits only first derivatives of degree related to @ xmath70 @ xcite . in @ xcite it is shown that @ xmath6 ##8 has extensions of the form @ xmath71 with @ xmath72 , creating in this way extended harmonic systems . similarly , harmonic oscillators in @ xmath73 , rational or not , can be transformed into harmonic ##s . @ xmath74 @ xcite. the formula @ xmath20 can be extended to @ xmath75 . this leads to several generalizations , as in @ xcite , that can be found in the paper in physics ( cdr ) . the general procedure can be in this form , with @ xmath39 substituted for any positive integer @ xmath76 after a suitable definition of @ xmath77 , so that the corresponding ttw system of equations , with @ xmath78 , can be written as an integral for any rational @ xmath70 . to these extended hamiltonians and their corresponding extensions can be associated quantum hamiltonians and lie groups by a method of integration , usually a form of einstein - beltrami integration . when the curvature of @ xmath9 is a constant , the integral requires additional terms ( or corrections ) in order to preserve integrability and superintegrability . the global curvature is then replaced by the sectional curvature and by the weyl tensor @ xcite . at least in the case @ xmath79 , the simultaneous quantization of @ xmath17 and @ xmath80 is possible , allowing the preservation of the superintegra##bility of the classical quantum systems to the quantum ones . this will be shown in the paper in preparation ( cdr ) .
