reciprocal , which was first described by petit at the end of 19th century , has a long history @ xcite and has been derived in many ways . there are two different reciprocal configurations in the responses as shown in fig . the ones in fig . [ fig1 ] ( a ) and [ fig1 ] ( b ) are transmission reciprocal and those in figs . [ fig1 ] ( a ) and [ fig1 ] ( b ) are reflection reciprocal . as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] , we denote transmittance by @ xmath0 and reflectance by @ xmath1 ; the symbols k and @ xmath2 stand for the wavenumber vector and reflection , respectively . the reciprocal configurations are given by symmetry operations on the incident light of the wavenumber vector : ( @ xmath3 ) or ( @ xmath4 ) . that on transmission means that @ xmath5 , and that on reflection is known as @ xmath6 , which is not very precise and is often surprising to read . the first general proof was given by petit in 1980 , @ xcite where reciprocal reflection as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] is used for .objects such as an echelette grating . on the basis of the reciprocal theorem for the solution of the maxwell equations , the proof shows that reciprocal reflection holds for periodic objects free of scattering . it seems impossible to apply the theorem to transmission because it would be necessary to find solutions of maxwell equations that satisfy the boundary conditions at the intersection of the reflection , grating , and transmitted beams . the history of the work on reciprocal optical responses has been reviewed in detail . since the 1950s , many problems regarding electrons , elementary particles , and so on have been addressed by using scattering matrices ( s - matrix ) . in the studies of the s - matrix , it is assumed that there is no absorption by the object . the assumption leads to the unitarity of the s - matrix and makes it possible to compute it . the reciprocal reflection of lossless objects is proved using this formula . @ xcite in this paper we give a simple , straightforward , and general proof of the reciprocal optical responses for transmission and reflection based mainly on classical electrodynamics . we start from the reciprocal theorem stated in sec . [ thm ] and give the expression for first order transmission and reflection coefficients in sec . [ proof ] . the equation isdue to the reciprocity . a numerical and experimental example of this is presented in fig . [ example ] . the limitation and the ##age of the optical waves is also discussed . the reciprocal theorem has been used in many fields , such as statistical mechanics , quantum mechanics , and physics . @ xcite ##s we have the formula for it . when two sources exist as in fig . [ fig2 ] and the induced electromagnetic ( em ) waves exist in linear and parallel ##ized media in which @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 , the @ xmath9 equation is the reciprocal theorem in electromagnetism . the proof given in ref . for plane waves and is straightforward . formula ( [ reci ] ) is valid even for media with currents . the integrands take non - negative values at the position @ xmath10 where currents exist , that is , @ xmath11 . the theorem describes the relationship between the induced electromagnetic sources @ xmath12 ( @ xmath13 ) and the induced electromagnetic sources @ xmath14 which are present at the position of the electromagnetic source @ xmath15 ( @ xmath16 ) . in this case , we applythe above applies to optical responses in both transmission and reflection modes . first , we consider the parameters used in the design of the system in eq . ( [ reci ] ) . an electric field oscillating at the frequency @ xmath17 emits electromagnetic radiation , which is detected in the far field . when a small dipole @ xmath18 along the @ xmath19 axis is measured at the source , it is written as @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 , where @ xmath22 denotes the unit vector along the @ xmath19 axis and @ xmath23 the magnitude of the vector . the source in turn produces light , which in the far field is @ xmath24 where the coordinates ( @ xmath25 , @ xmath2 , @ xmath26 ) are used , a unit vector is given by @ xmath27 , and @ xmath28 . because the frequency @ xmath18 is defined by @ xmath29 and that of the carriers is defined by @ xmath30 , we have the frequency @ xmath31 associated with the dipole @ xmath18 : @ x##math32 shows two arrays of @ xmath33 antennas ( equal and different ) in the @ xmath34 plane as shown in fig . the two arrays have the same length , and the angles are specified by normalized vectors @ xmath35 ( @ xmath36 ) and @ xmath37 . in this case , the length is @ xmath38 . if the dipoles coherently travel with the same direction , then the emitted plane waves are scattered and form a wave front at a distance away from the array in the @ xmath34 plane as drawn in fig . [ fig3 ] . the incident wave component of the wave front , @ xmath39 , is @ xmath40 and travels with wavenumber vector @ xmath41 . thus , if we place the dipole arrays far away from the array , the emitted em fields match the incident incident plane waves in the @ xmath34 plane to a good approximation . the array of dipoles has to be large enough to form the incident waves . for the second example , we use @ xmath42 ( @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 ) . see [ fig3] for a linear coordinate system , which is an almost stationary object moving along the @ xmath19 axis . the relation between the frequency @ xmath12 , the frequency @ xmath35 of the object , and the wavenumber frequency @ xmath41 of the wave front is expressed as @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 . it is possible to expand the vector field into a power series for the array of periodic sources : @ xmath47 where @ xmath48 is the fourier transform of @ xmath49 , @ xmath50 ( @ xmath51 ) , and @ xmath52 is the direction of the object along the @ xmath53 axis ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) . the @ xmath19 term is expressed in homogeneous media or vacuum as @ xmath54 , where the components correspond to the directions along the @ xmath19 axis . when the source array is composed of very small and periodic sources , the integration can be performed to high accuracy as @ xmath55 where @ xmath56 . to ensure that the integration is accurate to @ xmath57 , the array of sources isto be smaller than @ xmath58 : @ xmath59 where @ xmath60 is the most common one of the diffraction lines which are open at the frequency @ xmath17 . this condition would not be satisfied when @ xmath39 is a plane wave . by permutating 1 and 2 in eq . ( [ j1e2 ] ) , we obtain @ xmath61 . this ( [ j1e2 ] ) and the integral equation in fig . ( [ reci ] ) lead to the vector @ xmath62 the same vector @ xmath63 ( @ xmath36 ) is valid at the frequency @ xmath10 where there is no vector @ xmath64 ( @ xmath65 ) . the equation in eq . ( [ reci ] ) is reduced to eq . ( [ j1e2 ] ) which is satisfied only for the first component of the observed electric field . the reciprocity is also independent of second order interactions , which are responsible for the modulated electric fields of the materials . when there is no vector ##ity in fig . [ fig3 ] , a similar result holds : @ xmat##h66 the transmittance @ xmath67 is given by @ xmath68 from fig . ( [ t _ reci ] ) ( [ t _ reci ] ) , we finally get the reciprocal of @ xmath69 . the result of the proof that @ xmath69 is that of the first evaluation of @ xmath63 and this makes the proof simple and straightforward . the proof can be extended to two - dimensional periodic structure by replacing the one - dimensional periodic structure in fig . [ fig3 ] with two - dimensional one . although we have only periodic structures , the proof can also be extended to non - periodic structures . to do this extension , fig . ( [ e _ expand ] ) needs to be expressed in the general form @ xmath70 , and a more detailed evaluation for @ xmath71 is required . reciprocity for transmission lines is independent of reflection , transmission , and scattering between objects . in fig . [ fig3 ] the two electromagnetic waves @ xmath14 are polarized in the @ xmath34 direction . the phenomenon is called induced reflection in the context of waveguide theory and is also often referred@ xmath72 symmetry . for te polarization ( which is also called @ xmath73 symmetry ) for which @ xmath14 has a polarization perpendicular to the @ xmath74 axis , the proof is similar to what we have , except that the mirrors are oriented along the @ xmath74 axis . the reflection is also shown in a similar way . the configuration is shown in figure . the two mirrors have to be located to satisfy the mirror symmetry about the @ xmath19 axis . the symmetry of @ xmath71 leads to the following formula for the @ xmath75 . note that @ xmath76 = eq . ( [ e0 _ reci ] ) has to be evaluated by replacing the periodic ##ity by a perfect circle . an example of reciprocal reciprocal transmission is shown below . figure [ fig5 ] ( a ) shows the structure of the mirror and reciprocal transmission configuration . the sample consists of periodic grooves embedded in thin films of au and air on a solid substrate . the diameter is 1200 nm , as shown by the dotted lines in fig . [ fig5 ] ( a ) . the unit cell shows the structure of au : air : au :air = 3 : 2 : 4 : 1 . the size of ca , cr , and cr is 50 nm , 100 nm , and 1 nm , respectively . the profile is slightly curved about the @ xmath19 plane . the profile was modeled from an afm analysis of the fabricated material . figure [ fig5 ] ( right ) shows our experimental results . the incident light has @ xmath77 and above values ( the wave vector is in the @ xmath34 plane ) . the numerical calculation was done with an improved s - matrix method @ xcite the permittivities of gold and chromium were taken from and . and ; the permittivity of silver is well known to be 2 . 5 . in the numerical calculation , the incident light is assumed to be a plane wave , and values up to @ xmath78 in etc . ( [ fig _ 1 ] ) are used , which is enough to produce accurate optical responses . the result indicates that transmission spectra ( lower solid line ) are exactly the same in the reciprocal configurations , while emission ( upper solid line ) and absorption ( dotted line ) spectra show a slight difference . the data is plotted along the left axis . the difference is thatthe values are different on each side and for different wavelengths of light . nonetheless , the transmission spectra are the same for incident wavenumber vectors @ xmath79 and @ xmath80 . the transmission spectra are described in fig . [ fig5 ] ( c ) and are included in the error . it is easily calculated both numerically and experimentally . there have a few results on reciprocal transmission ( see references in ref . ) . in accordance with these results , fig . [ fig5 ] ( c ) shows the excellent agreement of reciprocal transmission and provides the best available experimental evidence supporting it . we note that the spectra in fig . [ fig5 ] ( a ) and [ fig5 ] ( c ) agree well above 700 nm . on the other hand , they show a slight variation below 700 nm . the result could come from the difference between the modeled profile in fig . [ fig5 ] ( c ) and the actual structure of the material . the dip at 660 nm stems from a weak plasmon at the metal - semiconductor interface , so that the actual transmission spectra would be affected only by the surface tension and the deviation from the modeled profile . as shown in fig . [thm ] , the reciprocal theorem assumes that the functions are linear and show local variation . logically , it would happen that the reciprocal optical responses do not hold for linear and nonlocally nonlinear media . it is the explicit description of the transmittance for a reciprocal configuration of a nonlinear liquid crystal of knbo @ xmath81 : mn . the values of the transmittance deviate by a few tens of degrees in the reciprocal configuration . the crystal has a second - order symmetry such that @ xmath82 . the break down of it follows from the nonlinearity . does it also break down in nonlocal media ? for nonlocal media the d * d * is given by @ xmath83 . although a complete proof for this case has not been reported to our knowledge , it has been shown that reciprocity holds for a linear stratified structure model of nonlocal media . @ xcite in particular , we have obtained an explicit and heuristic description of the reciprocal optical responses for transmittance and reflectance . when the reciprocal theorem in fig . ( [ reci ] ) holds , the reciprocal relations follow from geometrical properties of light sources and reference frames , and are independent of theanalysis of the data . the line has been confirmed both physically and theoretically . we thank s . g . tikhodeev for this . one of us ( m . g . ) thanks the japan foundation for opto - optics and electronics for their support , and the optical research center , tohoku university for their support of the new method .
