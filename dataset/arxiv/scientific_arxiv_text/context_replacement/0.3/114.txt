the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation is one of the most popular approaches to investigate the non - perturbative case of quantum field theory . the details of the use of the sd equations for quark propagator are well - known . however , the corresponding sd equations for the field and the propagators in yang - mills theory have been studied mainly in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region . @ xcite in this way , we study the sd equations for the @ xmath0 yang - mills theory in the local abelian ( ma ) gauge and solve them again in the infrared ( ir ) radiation region . the ma gauge is used to investigate the yang - mills theory from the view point of the local superconductivity . in the ma gauge , in contrast to the ordinary d gauge , we must first distinguish the diagonal components of the field from the off - diagonal components . this is not the case even in the perturbative case in the uv region . @ xcite therefore , we must take account of the four propagators for the diagonal field , off - diagonal field , diagonal ghost and off - diagonal ghost . the behaviors of the propaga##tors in the ma gauge are often simulated by a computer simulation . @ xcite example , we get the following equations from the @ xmath0 ##w - w equations in the ma gauge @ xcite . the graphical representation of the equations is given in the [ 1 : sde ] . = . 001 .

( [ e : off - diagonal ghost ] ) and ( [ eq : off - diagonal ghost ] ) , we obtain the relations @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 . in the case of @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 , from the eq . ( [ e : diagonal ghost ] ) , we obtain the relation @ xmath32 so that @ xmath33 is greater than @ xmath34 . in the case of @ xmath35 and @ xmath31 , we obtain for the case of @ xmath8 and @ xmath36 with @ xmath37 since and from the leading terms of @ xmath8 are opposite each other , the ansatz ( [ x : ghost ]) . therefore we need the addition of the last term of the form factor @ xmath8 . in this case we obtain the relation @ xmath38 from the equation . ( [ x : quantum gluon ] ) note that @ xmath33 is also smaller than @ xmath34 . next , we consider the case of @ xmath30 and @ xmath39 . as well as the classical case , we can redefine the form factor @ xmath6 and @ xmath40 with @ xmath41 and we obtain the relation @ xmath42 ( @ xmath43 ) . finally , in the case of @ xmath44 , we obtain the relation @ xmath45 ( @ xmath43 ) . the results are given in the [ tbl : einstein gauge ] . @ xmath32 & @ xmath42 @ xmath35 & @ xmath38 & @ xmath45 [ tbl : einstein gauge ] for the gauge other than the einstein gauge , that is , @ xmath46 , the results and models are quite different . however , the theoretical results are similar tothe same results except for the last data point . in this case , even if @ xmath39 , there occurs phase cancellation as in the previous two cases 2c and 2a . this is because the off - diagonal gluon propagator has the time and phase structure for @ xmath46 , while it is reduced to @ xmath47 for @ xmath22 . therefore , we have the relation @ xmath48 in the case of @ xmath39 . ( see also [ tbl : not einstein gauge ] . ) @ xmath30 & @ xmath32 & @ xmath48 @ xmath35 & @ xmath38 & @ xmath48 [ tbl : not einstein gauge ] in the ir limit , the scale factors of the propagator behave as @ xmath49 @ xmath50 @ xmath51 . the result is that the diagonal gluon effect is enhanced in the ir limit , while the off - diagonal gluon and off - diagonal spin effects are reduced in the ir limit . our results are consistent with a theory of abelian groups @ xcite .
