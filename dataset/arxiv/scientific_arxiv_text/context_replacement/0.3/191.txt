understanding and studying all aspects of the dynamics of open quantum systems is of great importance to physics , chemistry , and biology @ xcite . the non - linear dynamics is one of the most central aspects of the open quantum systems , and attracts much attentions @ xcite . the dynamics of open systems is described by the intermediate quantum semigroup @ xcite , and is taken as an approximation of the theory with some very simple assumptions . however , exact master equations , which describe the non - markovian dynamics , are complicated @ xcite . based on the infinitesimal ##ity in terms of the intermediate semigroup , wolf _ et al . _ proposed a model - based way to describe the non - markovian dynamics @ xcite . moreover , given the intuitive ##ness of the backward diffusion problem leading to the lack of distinguishability of intermediate dynamical systems , breuer , laine , and piilo ( blp ) proposed a theory on the degree of non - markovian behavior based on the monotonicity of the trace distance between the channels @ xcite , as shown in fig . [ fig : 1 ] . the blp non - markovianity has been widely studied , and demonstrated in various experiments @ xcite . ( see online) analysis of the information flow picture for non - markovianity @ xcite . according to this scenario , the loss of distinguishability of the ' s states indicates the information flow from the system to the system . if the system is backward , the information flow is mostly outward , represented by the green thick arrow . non - markovian behaviors occurs when there is inward information flow , represented by the red thin arrow , bringing some distinguishability back to the system . , [ = 226 ] . for classical quantum processes , the non - markovian criteria for backward behavior are non - unique , and even controversial . first , the non - unique measures from the forward behavior and the backward information flow are not equivalent @ xcite . second , many different non - markovianity measures , based on different mechanism for the monotonicity of correlations under local quantum effects , have been proposed @ xcite . third , even in the framework of backward information flow , trace distance is not the unique monotone distance for the distinguishability between the states . other monotone measures on the theory of differential operators can be found in ref . @ xcite , and the trace distance @ xcite is another widely - used measure . different measures should not be expected towith the following non - markovian criteria . the inconsistency among various non - markovianity implies certain physical properties . in this way , we show that the blp non - markovianity does not reveal the local non - divisibility of quantum processes caused by the non - unital nature of the system . besides non - markovianity , ` ` non - unitality ' ' is another important dynamical property , which shows the necessity for the creation of the state @ xmath0 under quantum channels @ xcite and for the creating of quantum states of n - qubit systems under the quantum channels @ xcite . in the same spirit of blp non - markovianity , we provide a measure on the non - unitality . since blp non - markovianity is the most widely used measure on non - markovianity , we also provide a measure on the non - unital non - markovianity , which can be easily used as a complement to the blp measure , when the quantum process is non - unital . we also give an example to demonstrate the extreme case , where the blp non - markovianity holds when the quantum process is not infinitesimal ##ized .this paper is summarized as follows . in sec . [ sec ] , we give a comprehensive review of the theory of density operators and quantum channels with hermitian orthonormal operator basis , and various measures of non - markovianity . in sec . [ sec : non - unital - nm ] , we investigate the non - unitality and the non - unital non - markovianity and give the two quantitative measures above . in sec . [ sec : nm ] , we apply the non - unital non - markovianity measure to a family of quantum channels , which is different from the generalized family of channels . section [ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion . the state of a quantum channel can be represented by the density operator @ xmath1 , which is positive semidefinite and of order 2 . quantum channels , or density operations , are the positive and order - preserving ( cpt ) maps from density operators to density matrices , and can be represented by kraus matrices , choi - jamiokowski matrices , or transfer operators @ xcite . in this paper , we use the hermitian operator basis to represent states and represent quantum channels . let @ xmath2 be the complete set of hermitian and orthonorma##l acts on the space @ xmath3 , i . e . , @ xmath4 , @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 . the operator @ xmath7 through @ xmath3 can be express as the wave vector @ xmath8 through @ xmath9 with @ xmath10 . then @ xmath11 is equivalent if @ xmath7 is hermitian . in the example , the quantum channel @ xmath12 can be expressed as @ xmath13 $ ] via @ xmath14 = [ ( \ mathcal { t } ) , ( \ , ) \ , { eq : 1 } , \ ] ] where @ xmath15 is the @ xmath16 - matrix with the entries @ xmath17 furthermore , we can easily define that @ xmath18 for the space of quantum channels . while @ xmath19 is the composite of @ xmath20 . 1 into the space of the quantum states , i . e . , @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 can be written as @ xmath23 for any quantum operator @ xmath1 . 2 @ xmat##h24 with @ xmath25 the density operator . in such a case , @ xmath4 for @ xmath26 are traceless and form the matrix @ xmath27 . this matrix parametrization @ xmath28 for density operators is also called generalized density vector , or generalized density vector @ xcite . in order to determine the root of unity for the matrix @ xmath22 , we use the notation @ xmath29 . thus , the density operator @ xmath1 can be written as @ xmath30 with @ xmath31 the generalized density operator and @ xmath32 with @ xmath33 . in this way , quantum mechanics can be represented by the linear map @ xcite @ xmath34 where @ xmath35 is a density matrix with the dimension @ xmath36 and the trace of the matrix @ xmath37 is @ xmath38 _ { \ mu } = \ left \ langle \ int _ { \ mu } , \ mathcal { d } ( \ openone ) \ right \ rangle / d , \ ] ] for @ xmath26 . in fact . ( [ 1 : 2 ]) with eq . ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) , one could show that @ xmath39 _ { \ , \ nu } , \ ] ] for @ xmath40 . thus , @ xmath15 can be divided into the following sub - block : @ xmath41 . \ ] ] given that a quantum channel @ xmath42 is said to be unital if and only if @ xmath43 @ xcite , one could show that the necessary and sufficient condition for a unital channel is that @ xmath44 , for , @ xmath45 thus , @ xmath37 has the non - unital structure of the quantum channel @ xmath42 . the necessary and sufficient condition above could be easily satisfied by realizing that the unit vector of @ xmath46 is block diagonal , i . e . , @ xmath47 . based on the sub - block structure of @ xmath15 , @ xmath44 is equivalent to that @ xmath15 is block diagonal , i . e . , @ xmath48 . whether a quantum channel @ xmath42 has cp ##t ( cp ) can be determined by the choi - jamio##kowski defined @ xcite @ xmath49 where @ xmath50 is the maximally stable state . then @ xmath51 is a basis in hilbert space . @ xmath42 is cp if and only if the choi - jamiokowski matrix is cp . with the hermitian linear ##ity , @ xmath52 is an @ xmath16 matrix and can be written in the form @ xcite @ xmath53 putting this matrix into eq . ( [ t : t ] ) and into eq . ( [ eq : t ] ) , we could express the choi - jamiokowski matrix as @ xmath54 if @ xmath42 is unital , it can be written into @ xmath55 without the interference of interactions between the open system and the rest of the reduced state , the reduced state for the open system from @ xmath56 to [ @ xmath57 can be written as @ xmath58 , \ ] ] which is a closed subset . this means that @ xmath59 is cpt . the differential operator @ xmath60 describes the time evolution of the closed entirety , and @ xmath61 describes the initial state ofthe environment . a quantum channel @ xmath62 is said to be infinitely small , and is a time - independent or time - dependent markovian , if it possesses the following properties : @ xcite @ xmath63 for any @ xmath64 , where @ xmath65 is both time independent and order dependent . various measures on the degree of the non - markovian ##ity of quantum processes have been proposed and studied @ xcite . almost all of the measures on the non - markovianity can be classified into two categories , depending on the degree of the degree of the following properties possessed by the infinitesimal divisible quantum processes : \ ( i ) monotonicity of distance @ xmath66 under cpt maps . that is @ xmath67 for any quantum channel @ xmath42 , where @ xmath68 is the smallest continuous function of cpt maps on the set of density operators @ xcite , including classical distance , bures distance , quantum distance , quantum entropy , and fidelity ( although fidelity itself is not a distance , it can be used to construct other measures ) and so on . the measures on non - markovianitythe definitions of the trace distance during the evolving dynamic maps @ xmath65 have been given and discussed in refs . @ xcite . the first definition of this type , which would be used later in this article , was first given by smith , laine , and piilo in 1999 . @ xcite , based on the monotonicity of trace distance @ xcite @ xmath69 where @ xmath70 . interpreting the increase of the trace distance during the time period of the data flows from the system back to the system , the definition of the blp non - markovianity is defined by @ xmath71 where @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 for @ xmath74 are the evolving maps . \ ( - ) definition of the choi - jamiokowski matrix for cpt maps . the choi - jamiokowski matrix @ xmath75 if and only if @ xmath42 is a random map , then , @ xmath42 is a cpt map . further comments on non - markovianity : the definition of the choi - jamiokowski matrix for mediate dynamic maps @ xmath65haveis given and discussed in refs . @ xcite . for this , we would use one of these methods , which was introduced by rivas , huelga and plenio ( rhp ) in 2007 . they utilize the definition of the choi - jamiokowski matrix @ xmath76 for the quantum correlation ##s with the form @ xmath77 where @ xmath78 \ ( 1 ) monotonicity of the @ xmath79 under local quantum channels . that is @ xmath80 \ leq [ ( \ alpha ^ { ab } ) $ ] for any local quantum channel @ xmath42 , where @ xmath79 is an appropriate expression for the entropy in the local channel @ xmath81 , the local entropy and the local information . the corresponding results on non - markovianity are given and discussed in ref . the non - markovianity matrix @ xmath82 is available to study the non - local aspects of the unital case of the problem . but for the non - unital case , it is not available . to do this , we use the hermitian orthonormal .1 to describe classical and quantum processes . utilizing equation . ( [ eq : rho ] ) , the trace distance between the states @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 is given by @ xmath85 \ cdot \ end { \ lambda } \ big | . \ end { . } \ ] ] and , for the two evolving states , we have @ xmath86 \ cdot \ end { \ lambda } \ big | , \ label { [ : dis } \ ] ] where @ xmath83 , @ xmath84 are initial states of the channel . from this , one can see that the trace distance between any two evolving states is equal to the non - unital difference @ xmath87 of the state variables . so if there are two quantum channels , whose affine states are @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 , then , the difference of trace distance between the evolving states from any two initial states does not affect these evolving states . more precisely , @ xmath87 will imply the non - existence of the quantum channel @ xmath90 , and this can not be revealed until @ xmath##82 . on the other hand , the non - unital part @ xmath87 has its own special ##ity : @ xmath91 is necessary for the increasing of the time @ xmath92 @ xcite . in other words , @ xmath93 is the non - unit part , the non - unitality being a kind of the ##ization of quantum mechanics . in addition to the concept of blp non - markovianity , we have the following relation on the effect of the non - unitality of a random process : @ xmath94 } { \ mathrm { d } t } \ , | \ mathrm { d } t , \ ] ] where @ xmath95 is the initial state . obviously , @ xmath96 vanishes if @ xmath97 . since the non - unital part of the process , which is not revealed by the trace distance , has its own special , we need to measure the effect of non - unitality on non - special ##ity . however , a perfect separation of the non - unital part from the original non - markovianity may be impossible . if we define a different version @ xmat##h98 for the non - unital pseudo - markovianity to satisfy the following three conditions : ( i ) @ xmath99 vanish if @ xmath90 is infinitely small , ( ii ) @ xmath99 vanishes if @ xmath90 is unital , ( iii ) @ xmath100 should be equal to @ xmath87 . based on these conditions , we define the following measure @ xmath101 where @ xmath102 with @ xmath103 is the sum of the two points which exit from the maximal mixed state , and @ xmath104 , \ ] ] with @ xmath68 the appropriate measure which will be given below . the following result is obtained if we assume that @ xmath66 is relevant under the cpt assumption , i . e . , @ xmath105 \ leq [ ( \ sum _ { 1 } , \ rho _ { 2 } ) $ ] for the random variable @ xmath42 . for the unital time measure , the measure @ xmath106 ##8 contains the maximal mixed state , and the corresponding measure @ xmat##h100 } , and the second condition is satisfied . the third condition is the trace distance . in this case , we have the trace distance which is defined as @ xmath107 } , \ ] ] where @ xmath108 is the uhlmann fidelity @ xcite between @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 . here bures distance is the appropriate distance for @ xmath100 because it obeys the monotonicity of cpt maps @ xcite and is equal to @ xmath87 . as if , the monotonicity of distance is satisfied , for example , we can also take the inverse of the trace distance and take the right side of unlmann fidelity as a simple function of ` ` ` ` ' ' @ xcite . the relative entropy @ xcite @ xmath110 $ ] , or the compressed entropy @ xmath111 , is a good approximation for the distance . noting that when the support of @ xmath83 is not exactly the support of @ xmath84 , then , @ xmath112 , @ xmath113 will be infinite , and in such case , the relative entropy willbring us to the definition of non - markovianity . also , hellinger distance @ xcite is used . although all of these distances are cp and cpt maps , they all have different properties than the system itself , see ref . @ xcite . the difference between non - unital non - markovian measures given by ref . ( [ eq : definition _ 1 ] ) and the blp - type measures , especially those which use the alternative definitions , is the restriction of the pairs of initial states . unlike with the blp - type measure relying on any pair of initial states , the non - unital non - markovianity measure only relies on the pair consisting of the maximally populated state and its trajectory state . on one hand , this restriction makes the non - unital non - markovianity measure vanish when the wiener processes are unital , no matter they are mixed or non - markovian ; on the other hand , this restriction reflects that non - unital non - markovianity measure reveals only a bit of information about the non - markovian behavior . to illustrate the non - unital non - stationary behavior , we use the example in this section . we use the generalized adaptive damping channel ( gadc )as a way to construct a quantum process . the gadc can be described as @ xmath114 with the kraus function @ xmath115 given by @ xcite @ xmath116 where @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 are the parameters . note that for [ @ xmath119 $ ] and [ @ xmath120 $ ] , the parameter @ xmath42 is a real number . for a two - dimensional system , the hermitian orthonormal operator f can be chosen as @ xmath121 , where @ xmath122 is the set of pauli numbers . with the decomposition of eq . ( [ x : f ] ) , the phase map for the quantum system is given by @ xmath123 @ xcite , where @ xmath124 the gadc is unital if and only if @ xmath125 , @ xmath126 . when @ xmath126 , @ xmath127 , the map is identity . the quantum process can be constructed by making the parameters @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 to be dependentsimilar to @ xmath128 . for this , we use @ xmath129 and @ xmath130 , where @ xmath131 is a positive quantum number . this is a simple quantum process , because @ xmath90 is the quantum channel for the @ xmath57 , and @ xmath132 is the quantum channel . now , let us use the @ xmath82 for this quantum process . for any two quantum states @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 , we have the quantum states @ xmath133 & = \ frac { 1 } { t } \ mathrm { tr } \ right | m ( \ mathcal { e } _ { t } ) [ \ mathbf { r } ( \ sigma _ { 1 } ) - \ mathbf { r } ( \ sigma _ { 2 } ) ] \ cdot \ frac { \ partial { \ sigma } } { \ sqrt { 1 } } \ right | \ nonumber \ \ & = \ frac { 1 } { \ sqrt { 2 } } \ right | m ( \ mathcal { e } _ { t } ) [ \mathbf { r } ( \ lim _ { 2 } ) - \ mathbf { r } ( \ lim _ { 2 } ) ] \ | | , \ lim { 0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath134 is the total product of the matrices @ xmath31 , and we use the notation @ xmath135 for the remainder . using @ xmath136 and @ xmath137 , we have @ xmath138 = \ frac { x ^ { - t / 2 } } { \ sqrt { x } } \ sqrt { x ^ { 2 } + y ^ { 2 } + e ^ { - t } y ^ { 2 } } , \ left { x : gadc _ tr _ 0 } \ ] ] which is @ xmath139 \ leq0 $ ] for any time , @ xmath57 and for any place , @ xmath140 , @ xmath141 , and @ xmath142 . thus , the blp ##h - markovianity holds , i . e . , @ xmath143 , although @ xmath90 may be an infinitesi##mal divisible , which will be clear here . ( available online ) ( a ) evolution of taylor series and bures distance between two evolving states of a two - dimensional system under the standard finite amplitude field theory , starting from the maximal mixed state @ xmath144 and the trajectory of @ xmath145 , respectively . ( b ) the trajectory of @ xmath146 given by : . ( [ 1 : gt ] ) , whose integral with respect to the @ xmath128 is rhp , for pseudo - markovianity . in these examples , the states are taken as @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 . , [ = 188 ] in order to investigate whether @ xmath90 is mal divisible or not , we shall use @ xmath100 in the following figure . the trajectory of the maximal mixed state of @ xmath90 is @ xmath149 where @ xmath150 taking these two states as the initial states , we obtain the following initial state : @ xmath151 then the trajectory reads @ xmath152 = \ frac { - } { - } ( h _ { + }+ e _ { - } ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath153 to compare with the sum of trace distances , we can write @ xmath154 = \ omega | \ omega _ { - } e _ { \ tau } \ right | / [ $ ] . with the expressions @ xmath130 and @ xmath129 , this is @ xmath155 = \ frac { e ^ { - 1 } } { - } \ right | \ cos2 \ omega \ right \ right | ( t - e ^ { - \ tau } ) . \ left { fig : gadc _ nonunital } \ ] ] from fig . [ fig : h _ dtr ] ( 2 ) , we can see that although the trace distance between the two points @ xmath156 and @ xmath157 $ decreases with the time @ xmath128 , the trace distance increases during the other time t . from fig . ( [ fig : gadc _ nonunital ] ) , we can see although @ xmath158 $ ] depends on @ xmath159 , it does not depend on @ xmath16##0 . actually , from fig . ( [ tc : gadc _ tr _ t ] ) we could see that for any two quantum states , the trace distance between the two states is dependent on @ xmath160 . in this way , the blp ##h - markovianity treats a family of quantum states , which only agree with @ xmath161 , as the same process . meanwhile , @ xmath100 knows the effects of @ xmath161 on the quantum self - assembly and is capable of measuring them . in order to work with bhp measure , we can use the @ xmath146 measure from fig . ( [ eq : gt ] ) . we get @ xmath162 \ ] ] with @ xmath163 the mediate trace of @ xmath164 with and @ xmath165 are not completely invariant when @ xmath166 . from fig . [ tc : tc _ dtr ] ( b ) , we can see that the increasing of the trace distance is in the case where @ xmath166 , which corresponds with the monotonicity of trace distance for cpt maps .in conclusion , we have shown that the test for non - markovianity based on trace distance can also measure the quantum non - locality induced by the non - unital properties of the dynamics . in order to study properties of the non - unitality , we have constructed a measure on the non - unital non - markovianity , and have constructed the measure on the non - unitality , in the same way as blp non - markovianity measure . like non - markovianity , the non - unitality is a generic feature of the quantum dynamics . with the development of quantum information , we need new theoretical approaches for open source software . it is hoped that some quantum information methods would help us to understand the generic properties of quantum dynamics . we hope this work may draw attention to study quantum dynamics properties from the computational perspective . this work is supported by nfrpc through grant no . 2012cb921602 , the nsfc through grant no . 11025527 and no . 10935010 and national science foundation and ministry of education , singapore ( grant no . number : 1 - 710 - 000 - 008 - 271 ) . m . m . wolf , quantum channels & a guided tour , http :/ / www - m5 . ma . tu . de / foswiki / pub / m5 / allgemeines / michaelwolf / qchannellecture . pdf [ http : / / www - m5 . ma . tu . de / foswiki / pub / m5 / allgemeines / michaelwolf / qchannellecture . pdf ]
