a multistable system is one that possesses a large number of possible states for a given set of parameters . there is extensive evidence for such systems in the natural sciences , with examples coming from neurosciences and molecular dynamics @ xcite - @ xcite , physics @ xcite @ xcite , chemistry @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite , condensed matter @ xcite and biology @ xcite . multistability also appears to be an essential agent - driven feature in a large class of agent - based systems @ xcite . in view of this , it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms leading to multistability and , in particular , to find simple models where this process can be under control . the first mathematical proof in this area was obtained by newhouse @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite who proved that , near the homoclinic tangency , a sequence of diffeomorphisms on a two - dimensional manifold have infinitely many attracting - points ( sinks ) , a result that was later extended to higher dimensions @ xcite . it has also been proved @ xcite that , in addition to infinitely many sinks , infinitely many strange points exist near the homoclinic tangencies . the proof of thephenomena under such random ##ness have been studied @ xcite @ xcite . the second dynamical approach leading to multistability is the application of the dissipative energy to conservative systems . conservative systems have a large number of coexisting invariant sets , namely periodic orbits , random tori and cantori . by adding a small amount of energy to a conservative system one finds that some of the invariant sets become unstable . not all invariant sets of the conservative system will survive when the dissipation is large . however , for sufficiently large values , many attractors ( mainly periodic orbits ) have been observed in typical systems @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite . the problem of migration between systems and their behavior in non - linear systems has also been studied by several authors @ xcite @ xcite . most of these are based on theoretical evidence . however , using the techniques of numerical stability @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite , rigorous experimental results @ xcite can be obtained . finally , it has been shown in @ xcite that , for large values above the feigenbaum type - 1 critical point , linear systems coupled with convex coupling may have a large numberof the periodic orbits . this is one of the phenomena we study in detail in this article . the emphasis on the maps near the feigenbaum accumulation point has a motivation similar to the problem of control of chaos @ xcite @ xcite . the typical situation in control of chaos , is that of a random attractor with an infinite number of embedded periodic orbits , all of them unstable . these orbits are then controlled by controlling methods . if , instead of a large number of unstable periodic orbits , one has , for example , a large number of solutions , the controlling method would seem more promising and useful , because the control need not be very accurate . it would help to keep the system inside the desired state of equilibrium . at the non - doubling accumulation point the feigenbaum distribution , because of the properties of the flip bifurcations , corresponds with an infinite set of unstable periodic orbits . by coupling , as we can show , an infinitely large number of orbits may be stabilized . the existence of a large number of unstable periodic orbits for any two coupled random maps , is a difficult problem where multistability is always in control , in the sense that not only the nature of the phenomenon is completely known , one can easily computethe distribution of states that produce the desired number of stable states . this should be contrasted , for example , with the statement for the newhouse phenomenon @ xcite . rather than merely focusing on multistability , we should consider the phenomenology of two dimensional map maps , in particular the distribution of periodic points and the effects of synchronization . . the distribution of orbits in the coupled system is similar to that obtained in one dimensional coupled map lattice @ xcite with the exception that , due to the higher dimension of the phase space , the effects of bifurcations are different in our system . the statements for the multistability phenomenon at @ xmath0 very closely resemble , and also complement , the imprecise statements in @ xcite . coupled map lattices ( cml ) are discrete linear systems generated by the combination of a local nonlinearity and a gradient . the phase space of the cml considered in this letter is the map @ xmath1 ^ { { } $ ] and the dynamics is given by the map @ xmath2 defined as : . for the map @ xmath3 , its stabilization , @ xmath2 , and @ xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @ xmath6 , @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 . the relation @ xmath9 maps @ xmath1 $ ] into itself . however , the linear ##ity relation ( [ def ] ) implies that @ xmath10 ^ { 2 } ) \ [ [ - 1 , 1 ] ^ { 2 } $ ] and the dynamics are well - defined . we replace the variables starting from the initial state @ xmath11 by the variable @ xmath12 , that is to say , @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 for which @ xmath15 . for the sake of clarity , we will also use the variables @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 . the above definition of dynamics only applies to these variables for which relation ( [ def ] ) is @ xmath18 where @ xmath19 . finally , note that the dynamics agree with the relations @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 of the other variables . if @ xmath22 , then @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 . in this case , the orbit is said to be in ( from @ xmath25 . ). more precisely , an orbit is said to synchronize if @ xmath26 and if both orbits meet , then we say to have synchronization of the orbit . this is the typical orbital problem characterized by two - dimensional cml . to give a sufficient condition for synchronization in our model , we say that for each orbit , one has @ xmath27 for all @ xmath15 . it follows from ( [ def2 ] ) that the condition @ xmath28 ensures the exponential decay of @ xmath29 , and thus . . . since @ xmath30 , the condition @ xmath28 is equivalent to the following condition ( see figure 1 ) . @ xmath31 from now on , we say that @ xmath32 . the condition @ xmath33 is not satisfied . however , if for all @ xmath34 , then @ xmath9 is an initial fixed point in @ xmath1 $ ] , and one can prove that this happens . when @ xmath35 is sufficiently large , this happens even though @ xmath36 . apart from this and thethe orbits , non - synchronized ( periodic ) , appear from sets of synchronized ( periodic ) orbits . to understand this phenomenon , as well as the nature of the orbits , we can consider only the synchronized orbits of parameters 1 and 2 . let @ xmath37 be the synchronized fixed point denoted by @ xmath38 - variables . this holds for all values of the parameters and @ xmath2 has no other fixed point than @ xmath1 ^ { [ } $ ] . in @ xmath38 - variables , the jacobian of @ xmath39 at this fixed point is diagonal . the condition is @ xmath40 and the other eigendirection is the condition @ xmath41 . the other eigenvalue is @ xmath42 and the corresponding vector , perpendicular to the diagonal is referred as the co - diagonal . the condition @ xmath43 then determines a period - doubling bifurcation , which is of co - norm 2 if @ xmath44 . this is the well - known period - doubling condition of @ xmath9 which determines a synchronized period - 2 orbit of @ xmath2 . moreover , onenote that the map @ xmath45 is periodic for each @ xmath46 . hence the conditions @ xmath44 and @ xmath47 , i . e . @ xmath48 is another co - dimension 1 time - doubling bifurcation of the same fixed point . thus the conditions of the periodic ##ity theorem ( for e . g . @ xcite ) are satisfied when the map @ xmath49 is directed upward . the period - 2 orbit created by this map is co - synchronized and periodic . to show this , denote by @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 as components . since the multiplier @ xmath42 is negative and the corresponding curve is the off - diagonal , we have @ xmath52 ( sufficiently close to the bifurcation ) . because of the @ xmath53 symmetry , the map @ xmath2 also has a period - 2 orbit with components @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 . consequently if @ xmath56 , the system would have two periodic orbits created by the co - dimension 1 map . this is proved by the unicity in the bifurcation theorem . however , theclose to the origin , we find @ xmath57 and @ xmath58 which form the final orbit . by adding up the components of @ xmath2 , sufficiently close to the origin , this particular orbit is stable with respect to perturbations in one direction ( the off - diagonal direction of the origin ) and since @ xmath59 , it is stable in the direction closest to the origin . the result can then be computed . the orbit with @ xmath60 and @ xmath58 exists for any @ xmath61 and is the unique ( up to two translations ) 1 - 2 time - synchronized symmetric orbit of @ xmath2 [ @ xmath1 ^ { 2 } $ ] . computing the corresponding jacobian , one gets the formula for the orbit @ xmath62 \ right + \ left ( 1 - 2 \ varepsilon \ left ) ^ { 2 } ( c ^ { 2 } - d ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 2 } = 0 \ ] ] where @ xmath63 the results show that , if @ xmath64 , the multipliers , then @ xmath##65 and @ xmath66 , with zero imaginary part iff @ xmath67 . under this extension , we have @ xmath68 if @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 iff @ xmath71 . ( the condition @ xmath72 also holds if @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 , see figure 2 . ) consequently , by increasing @ xmath46 , the symmetric orbit has an inverse casimir effect for @ xmath75 . this extension is valid for a symmetric orbit in a system with parameter @ xcite and the conditions of the bifurcation only hold when the curve @ xmath76 is extended further . this extension produces two non - symmetric period - 2 orbits ( one symmetric and one symmetric ) . we have shown that these orbits exist for both @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 . for @ xmath79 , their components are combinations of a real component of @ xmath9 and the components of the period - 2 orbit . when the imaginary part of @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 is also zero , we have @ xmat##h82 . ( once again , if @ xmath73 and @ xmath83 , the condition @ xmath84 is satisfied , see figure 2 . ) the symmetric orbit is thus contained in the interval @ xmath85 . if @ xmath44 and the curve @ xmath86 is extended further , this curve becomes a hopf curve creating a new stable invariant circle . a numerical calculation shows that the curve is stable when @ xmath46 is sufficiently large or when @ xmath87 is sufficiently small . however , if @ xmath79 , it does not exist and the curve at @ xmath88 which is a period - doubling extension of @ xmath9 is a period - 4 curve . note that invariant circles in two - dimensional cml resulting from the intersection of a symmetric orbit and their local components have already been studied in @ xcite . using that work , the system is also described by ( [ def ] ) , where the local component at @ xmath89 and @ xmath35 may be smaller than @ xmath90 . figure 2 shows an example of the system shown above. however , it is more convenient to follow the sequence from @ xmath79 to different values of the parameter . in this picture , as well as in the following , the coupling parameter is @ xmath0 ( the starting point of the period - dependent cascade ) . in figure 2 , from @ xmath79 ( the point ) to @ xmath91 ( the point shown above ) , the symmetric orbit is unstable . the figure also shows the invariant ##s for @ xmath92 . at the points 1 and 2 , the symmetric orbit is unstable . at point 3 , the pitchfork point , the symmetric orbit becomes unstable and the non - symmetric orbits are created . finally , the point 3 ( @ xmath93 ) corresponds to the collapse on the third fixed point . the above example is not restricted to small periods but also to a multiple of two . in particular , the small period - @ xmath94 orbit may collapse to create a symmetric ( non - symmetric ) orbit of twice the period . for @ xmath95 , let @ xmath96 be the center of the period - @ xmath94 orbit of @ xmath9 .the components @ xmath97 are the components of the synchronized period - @ xmath94 orbit of @ xmath39 . by the chain rule and since each jacobian of @ xmath98 is constant , the local multiplier along the anti - diagonal direction is @ xmath99 the condition that this multiplier is @ xmath100 produces , if @ xmath44 , a co - phase 1 period - doubling bifurcation . applying the reasoning of the previous section to each component @ xmath98 , we find that this condition produces an orbit with the components @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 for all @ xmath15 , which is called a co - opposition - - @ xmath103 orbit . since @ xmath104 , this orbit occurs only if the bifurcation along the diagonal direction has occurred ( the original period - doubling bifurcation of @ xmath96 ) . in other words , the phase 1 period - @ xmath94 orbit occurs only if the original period - @ xmath94 orbit occurred . thus it follows from figure 3 that , at least for @xmath0 , the phase opposition period - @ xmath103 orbit holds only if the phase opposition period - @ xmath94 orbit does . this is solved analytically for the period @ xmath105 orbit whose existence factor is the power of the opposition period @ xmath106 orbit in the anti - diagonal direction . one gets @ xmath107 and @ xmath108 if @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 and @ xmath111 if @ xmath112 ( see figure 1 ) . however , the numerical calculation of @ xmath0 , reported in figure 3 , shows that the succession of bifurcations of the phase opposition orbit does not depend on the period . on this basis , we have calculated the value of @ xmath35 for the hopf bifurcation , the kerr transition and the non - linear bifurcation of the orbit , versus the square of the period . for this case , the result is similar to that described in the previous section , with an equal amount of variation in @ xmath87 . in addition , the picture shows that the phase opposition orbits will be stable for@ xmath44 fixed . this result is an example of the phenomenon that will be studied later . finally , since the phase shift components are the first ones to change when the parameters are varied from , and since the first such orbit that is observed is of period 1 , it follows that the necessary and sufficient condition for synchronization is @ xmath113 , the condition for the existence of the coupling . we now consider the stability and the stability of the orbits - @ xmath94 and for @ xmath0 . our interpretation for this case of @ xmath46 is that the scaling properties of @ xmath9 are based on scaling properties for the axes and values of @ xmath35 at which the bifurcations occur ( see figure 3 and 8 ) . we now consider the orbits which for @ xmath79 have the same period with respect to both axis @ xmath114 and @ xmath115 . these orbits are calculated numerically when @ xmath35 , and are calculated from the phase shift of their components at @ xmath79 . for @ xmath0 , the orbit @ xmath9 has a period - @ xmat##h94 orbit for each @ xmath116 , whose coordinates for @ xmath117 up to 3 are shown in figure 5 . in this case , the numbers reflect the order in which the components are visited and the tree structure represents the position of each component in the search tree . another important notion is the relative distance @ xmath118 between the components of an orbit . @ xmath118 is the number of steps one has to go through through the search tree to find a common solution . the relative distance is used to define the number of periodic orbits that we are considering . for example , the coordinates of each component of a periodic orbit are at distance 0 , those of a phase - locked orbit are at distance 1 . however , when we speak of distance @ xmath119 orbit we refer to the dyadic distance of the coordinates of the components . for each @ xmath120 , there are @ xmath121 different , with a @ xmath118 which have gone out of phase and @ xmath122 different , with @ xmath123 . the distance of a period - @ xmath124 orbit is atmost @ xmath117 ( @ xmath125 ) . for @ xmath79 , the only symmetric orbits are those with distances 0 and 1 . this property is observed for @ xmath44 and in figure 5 for @ xmath126 . the number of pairs of orbits with distance @ xmath127 should not differ from those with distance 0 . the differences are shown in figure 6 which shows the values of the differences . for @ xmath79 , the orbit is unstable . when @ xmath35 increases , it suffers from collisions with orbits of half the period when the orbits cross @ xmath100 and thus become unstable . ( when at @ xmath35 , these collisions would be time - dependent bifurcations . ) if @ xmath35 increases further , the orbit collisions with an unstable one of the same period in a two - dimensional orbit when the larger value is 0 . for large values of @ xmath87 , the orbit does not stabilize . the unstable orbit with which it collides is the one that only @ xmath79 has . @ xmath9##4 in one case and @ xmath128 in the other . for higher angular momentum , the probability distribution of the eigenvalues is similar to the @ xmath129 case . figure 7 shows a simple example of these relations for the orbit @ xmath129 . between @ xmath79 and the point labelled 1 in the figure , the orbit is unstable . the point 2 corresponds to the smaller value of - 1 ( see figure 7 ) . however , between the point 1 and 2 , the orbit is stable . it stops at the point 2 when it intersects with an unstable orbit of the same radius . we have seen that the coupling stabilize the orbit with distance greater than that of @ xmath0 . there are now two mechanisms responsible for this stabilization . . the term of the jacobian of a period - @ xmath94 orbit is @ xmath130 the term @ xmath131 coming from the coupling is when @ xmath117 ##9 . however , there is yet a third stabilizing mechanism . denote by @ xmath132 the remaining term is the determinant @ xmath133 without coupling , @xmath134 is simply the decrease of the value of @ xmath9 for the periodic orbits . from the solution of the feigenbaum - cvitanovic functional , it follows @ xcite that this factor converges to a constant value of @ xmath135 when @ xmath117 decreases . the coupling however , changes the number of the orbit components in such a way that this factor also decreases . it is the combined effect of this coupling with the contraction of the period that brings the orbits into the center of the unit circle and stabilizes the orbits . for small @ xmath35 there is a simple geometrical formula for the product of @ xmath136 . the reason why under the t - map the product @ xmath137 remains constant , when @ xmath117 decreases , is because every time the period doubles , the doubling in the number of components greater than one is compensated by the fact that the component of the orbit closest to zero becomes zero a bit more . for the periodic orbits in the non - periodic chain , the orbit components closest to zero alternate on each side of the chain . the combined effect of the convex hull is to bring the orbits together in the period- orbit hierarchy . however , because the projection nearest to x has to be near the origin for the orbit to be the one with half the period , this implies that the ratio of the components is expected to decrease . the larger the relative distance between the two projections on the sphere , the greater will be the perturbation that the individual ( one - dimensional ) projections experience . therefore one expects the phase change in @ xmath136 to increase with the dyadic distance . this effect is quite apparent on figure 8 which shows the limiting and destabilizing lines for orbits with periods from 1 to 4 . the shift downwards of the stable orbit for successively larger dyadic distances means that the smaller @ xmath35 is , the larger the number of distinct stable orbits that are present . an accurate phase estimate of the number of distinct orbits is obtained by computing the derivative @ xmath138 at @ xmath79 for distance @ xmath117 and dyadic distance @ xmath139 . however this derivative is an approximate estimate of @ xmath140 itself , because this derivative scales approximately linearly with @ xmath35 for all of the stable range of the orbit . see figure 9, the only factors , when @ xmath117 exists , of this derivative are and . from these results one replaces @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 note that in figure 9 there is more than one data point for each orbit @ xmath143 which corresponds to non - stable orbits with the same dyadic distance . * the value of the largest @ xmath35 parameter that stabilizes an orbit of constant distance @ xmath118 is to the power @ xmath117 @ xmath144 * the value of the largest @ xmath35 parameter for which a @ xmath145 orbit is stable @ xmath146 from this , one gets the result that at most @ xmath147 distinct periodic orbits are stable if @ xmath148 @ xmath147 is just a lower bound on the number of distinct stable periodic orbits , because then we have obtained all orbits with the same distance under consideration along the x axis . * conclusion : _ for sufficiently large _ @ xmath35 _ _ an infinitely large number of distinct stable periodic orbits are obtained _ _ . however , for any fixed @ xmat##h35 , it is an arbitrarily large orbit that is periodic , not an infinite number . the orbits either synchronize ( and are then unstable ) or disappear as @ xmath35 grows . as a result , the reasoning based on the implicit function theorem , as used in @ xcite is misleading . given a sequence of orbits of different periods , even if they are distinct orbits for a given period , that does not mean that their ( smallest ) orbits are periodic .
