nuclear multifragmentation is presently intensely studied both theoretically and experimentally . due to the interaction potential between the electron - nucleon interaction and the van der waals interaction , examples of a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter are searched . while the theoretical calculations concerning this phenomenon started at the beginning of 1980 @ xcite , the first experimental evaluation of the observed caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the aladin group @ xcite . a wide curve starting at around 1 mev and lasting from 3 to 5 mev / s of energy was observed . the observation was obviously associated with the possible existence of a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter and provided new motivations for further theoretical and experimental work . similar studies of eos @ xcite and indra @ xcite followed shortly . for different reactions they obtained very different observed curves , the particle - like effect being observed in the majority of cases . factors contributing to these results were both the precision of the experimental results and the particle - like effects of the observed curve manifested through the dependency of the equilibrated curve [ @ xmath5 ] on the reaction type . concerning the first point of view , the observationof the aladin group , the total energy of the spectator particles all together of approximately 10 @ xmath6 ( in the case of the reaction @ xmath1au + @ xmath1au , 600 mev / nucleon ) . more importantly however it was shown that the energies of the spectator particles are growing with approximately 10 @ xmath6 in the bombarding energy range 600 to 1000 mev / proton . on the other hand , the definition of the reaction @ xmath7 corresponding to the observed energy variation ( which was theoretically proven @ xcite to have the signature of an equilibrium ) means that for the above - mentioned reaction the expectation value of [ @ xmath5 should be the same . consequently , we deal with an important nonequilibrium energy variation in the observed spontaneous excitation reactions which either correspond to the pre - equilibrium or pre - break - up stages @ xcite . the smm experiments show a significant variation of nonequilibrium energy even in the case of the 600 mev / nucleon total energy variation @ xcite . thus , the necessity of accurate theoretical descriptions of the break - up stages and of the sequential secondary electron emission leads tobe used in order to distinguish between the cluster and nonequilibrium parts of the measured excitation energy . these approaches should strictly obey the constrains of the physical laws which , in the case of statistical multifragmentation , are not microcanonic . as we have underlined @ xcite , in spite of their success in reproducing some experimental data , the two commonly used statistical multifragmentation approaches ( smm @ xcite and mmmc @ xcite ) are not strictly satisfying the microcanonical laws . the next section describes the changes and improvements brought to the original microcanonical multifragmentation model presented in @ xcite and describes the use of the model in its new version for the interpretation of the latest experimental data of the aladin group @ xcite . the improvements brought to the model @ xcite are presented in section ii . section iii presents the first analysis of temperature curves and the first prediction ( consistent with this model ) of heat capacities of constant temperature ( @ xmath8 ) and as a function of the measured energy and temperature and also the comparison between the theoretical predictions and the latest experimental heli - temperature curve [ @ xmath9 @ xcite . ]as discussed in table iv . the change brought to the microcanonical multifragmentation model concerns both the _ break - up _ stage and the _ primary particle capture _ stage . + ( a ) _ primary break - up _ _ + comparing to the version of above . @ xcite the present model has the following new parameters : + ( a ) the new discrete energy levels are called the level density for fragments with @ xmath10 ( in the original version of the model a p - type level density formula was used for the particle excited states ) . in this case , in the total weight of the configuration and the correction factor of @ xcite the level density ##es are replaced by the sum of the discrete energies , @ xmath11 ( where @ xmath12 denotes the width of the @ xmath13th energy level ) . as a criterion for level density ( i . e . the average life - time to be greater than the average lifetime of the fragmentation process ) we have @ xmath14 / mev , where @ xmath15 is the width of the energy level . + ( b ) in the case of the fragments with @ xmath16 the level density formula is known asto take into account the relative change of the nuclei ' energy over - time ( compared to the standard rate of a nuclear reaction ) with the increase of their excitation energies . to this aim the thomas - type theory @ xcite is derived with the factor @ xmath17 ( see ref . @ xcite ) : @ xmath18 where @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 . + ( + ) _ inclusion of the sequential decay factor _ + for the @ xmath22 , it was observed that the fragment excitation energies are sufficiently small , as the sequential decay rule is not violated . according to weisskopf theory @ xcite ( so as to account for particles smaller than @ xmath23 ) , the probability of producing a particle @ xmath24 from an excited nucleus is proportional to the following : @ xmath25 where @ xmath26 are the highest energy states of the fragment @ xmath24 subject to particle energy ( their upper bound is usually around 7 - 10 mev ) , @ xmath27 is the lowest energy of the electron pair in the center of mass ( c . m . ) frame , @ xmath##28 is the energy of the particle @ xmath13 , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 are respectively the free energy of the fragment and the binding energy of the particle @ xmath24 and finally @ xmath31 is the inverse reaction cross - section . due to the nature of the multifragmentation process we considered the energy of the emitted particle @ xmath24 relative to the @ xmath32 level . for the inverse reaction cross - section we have used the standard model of parametrization from spectroscopy . the whole evaporation process is done by means of quantum monte carlo ( see for example @ xcite ) . for comparison with @ xmath33 ( the highest excited states of @ xmath34 nuclei taken into consideration are at energies greater than 1 mev belonging to the @ xmath23 family ) depending on their energy of excitation we have _ the set - up _ for @ xmath35 and weisskopf ##f processes ( here @ xmath36 is the free energy of the particle @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 is the binding energy ) . the microcanonical value will be the usual value @ .##cite for the wave - functions which are usually replaced by the discrete ones below . due to the large dimensions of the @ xmath39 systems , the break - up events are countable ( and a statistical monte carlo approach is used ) when the mean value approach is used for the total interaction energy . in this case , the wigner - seitz method @ xcite is used for the total interaction : @ xmath40 where @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 denotes the mass and the radius of the source nucleus , the resulting fragments have the index @ xmath13 , @ xmath43 ^ { 1 / 2 } $ ] and @ xmath44 . here @ xmath45 denotes the break - up channel and @ xmath46 the radius of the fragment at normal density . it should be added that @ xmath47 is the radius of the source nucleus at break - up and @ xmath48 is the radius of the @ xmath13 at normal density . for each event of the primary break - up simulation , the entire sequence of primary and secondary break - up events is monte carlo simulated . in the improved version of the microcanonicalmultifragmentation ##ally , the temperature curves corresponding to two freeze - out regions ( r = 2 . 25 a @ xmath49 and r = 2 . 50 a @ xmath49 respectively ) are reevaluated for the temperature of the source at ( 70 , 000 ) ( the microcanonical temperature curves associated with the initial values of the equation are shown below ) . these are shown in fig . 1 ( 1 ) . one can observe that the main features of the caloric curve from refs . @ xcite are reobtained . first , one can consider the liquid - like region at the beginning of the temperature curve , then the second liquid - like region and finally the rapidly increasing gas - like region . one can also notice that the temperature curve centered at the freeze - out radius r is maintained : the decrease of the freeze - out radius leads to a gradual decrease of the temperature curve . as it is well known , the expression of the total volume heat equation ( @ xmath8 ) as a function of the excitation frequency ( @ xmath50 ) and as a function of temperature ( @ xmath51 ) may provide useful information about the transition region and the total order. for this reason the models @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 have been developed ( see fig . 1 ( a ) and fig . 1 ( b ) ) . we see that the total volume heat capacity ( @ xmath8 ) is calculable in the above equation using the formula @ xcite : @ xmath54 ^ 2 \ right > + k ^ 2 \ right < \ left ( \ frac32 } _ { - \ frac52 \ right ) \ frac1 { k ^ 2 } \ right > . \ ] ] it can be seen that the @ xmath52 curve has a theoretical value around 1 . 5 mev / nucleon free energy for the considered freeze - out regions . this means that a phase transition exists in that region . the transition temperatures can be very precisely determined by analyzing the @ xmath53 . one can observe the sharp - peaked maxima from the transition temperature back to the two considered freeze - out regions . in order to make a direct comparison between the calculated heli ##centric temperature and the observed transition temperature @ xcite one has to consider the sequence of transition temperatures as a function of the system dimension [@ xmath5 . this is defined as in fig . @ xcite using as matching parameters the simultaneous fit of the @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 curves . this couple of curves can fairly accurately represent the dimension and the charge of the individual neutron ##s @ xcite . here @ xmath2 stands for the multiplicity of intermediate nuclear fragments and is defined as the number of fragments with @ xmath57 from one fragmentation event . @ xmath3 denotes the charge _ of the two nuclear fragments and , for one fragmentation event , defined as @ xmath58 with @ xmath59 where @ xmath60 is the maximum charge of a fragment and @ xmath61 is the second largest charge of a fragment in the respective event . @ xmath4 denotes the _ bound charge _ in one fragmentation event and is defined as the sum of the charges of all fragments with @ xmath62 . the simultaneous fit of the two curves @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 to the corresponding experimental data ( @ xmath1au + @ xmath1au = 1000 mev / s ) is shown in fig . theagreement is generally good . the equilibrated source sequence [ @ xmath5 we used for this purpose is given in fig . 2 , with the first evaluations of the decay energies as a function of source dimension for the lines @ xmath1au + @ xmath1au at 600 , 800 and 1000 mev / nucleon . the model predicted sequence is very close to the experimental line corresponding to 600 mev / nucleon decay energy . the deviations between the predicted equilibrated source sequence and the observed experimental lines suggest that the experimental lines have a quantity of non - equilibrium energy which grows with increasing the bombarding energy . as stated in ref . @ xcite , its decay can be observed in both the pre - decay and pre - start - up stages . these deviations are mainly due to the observed kinetic ##s which , unlike @ xcite from the 1995 study @ xcite , are much smaller . it should also be pointed that apart from the smm predictions @ xcite , the quantity of non - equilibrium energy predicted by the present model is smaller and thus the model predicted by source sequence is closer to the experimental line of the 600 mev / nubombarding the reaction . after evaluating the sequence of the two reactions , direct comparison the heli - isotopic temperature values with the ones being calculated by the aladin and @ xcite is made . to this purpose the uncorrected albergo model is used : @ xmath63 $ ] , the experimental predictions are calculated by @ xmath64 ( which is the temperature used in the aladin version of the heli - temperature so as to match the qsm , sm and mmmc - predictions ) . the result is shown in fig . 4 in the region of @ xmath4 . it can be seen that the correlation between the region @ xmath65 and the experimental data corresponding to the @ xmath1au + @ xmath1au reaction at 600 and 1000 mev / nucleon binding energy is excellent over the entire region of @ xmath4 . in addition , the smm model shows in the region @ xmath66 a slope steeper than the experimental data . sumarizing , the microcanonical multifragmentation model from fig . @ xcite is improved by refining the primary break - down part and by increasing the background light intensity .the caloric region rededuced with the new version of the model preserves its original shape @ xcite despite an important transition - energy difference . the transition energies are clearly indicated by the # ##ness of the @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 curves . the model has the ability of accurately describing the ` ` definitory ' ' curves of the nuclear multifragmentation ##s @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 . for the neutron source sequence @ xmath67 [ by using the method of comparing ] @ xmath68 and @ xmath69 versus @ xmath70 , the nonequilibrium value of the last measured free energy growing with the rest of the free energy is determined . the direct comparison of the two heli - curves shows an excellent agreement with the new heli curves recently calculated by the aladin group . g . fai and j . randrup , nucl . a * 404 * , 551 ( 1983 ) ; j . phys . comm . * 404 * , 385 ( 1986 ) ; l . p . csernai , g . fai and j . randrup , phys .b * 164 * , 149 ( 1984 ) ; y . fai , j . j . csernai , j . randrup and y . wang , phys . b * 164 * , 265 ( 1985 ) . j . pochodzalla _ et al . _ , lett . * 77 * , 1040 ( 1995 ) . j . g . hauger _ et al . _ , lett . * 77 * , 235 ( 1996 ) . j . g . _ _ et al . b * 390 * , 410 ( 1997 ) . j . schuttauf _ _ , nucl . phys . * a607 * , 457 ( 1996 ) . j . pochodzalla , progr . . phys . * 77 * , 443 ( 1997 ) . j . trautmann _ et al . _ , gsi -
