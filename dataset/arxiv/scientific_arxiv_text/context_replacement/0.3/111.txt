nuclei in contact with magnetic fields display a wide variety of collective vibrations known as giant resonances , each with various degrees of freedom and multipolarities . the giant isovector dipole resonance and the giant isoscalar quadrupole resonance are the most studied modes in this class of phenomena . this pairing mode , that is associated with increases in the number of particles , has been predicted in the paper @ xcite and discussed , under the name of collective pairing modes , in the middle of the 80 s in a series of papers @ xcite . this theory , despite some recent work aimed to explain some small bump in the high - lying spectrum of ( s , t ) modes @ xcite , is still without any definitive experimental confirmation . for a review , in particluar in connection with two - particle transfer reactions , on some aspects of pairing modes in nuclei we refer to a recent review @ xcite . we have studied the problem of collective pairing modes at high - energies in two particle transfer reactions with the aim to prove the use of the electron beam as a computational tool to enhance the excitation of pairing modes @ xcite . the main problem is that with standard electron beams one is faced with a large energy mismatch that stronglyreduces the excitation of high - lying nuclei and favours the transition to the ground state of the excited system . instead the optimum q - value obtained in the ( @ xmath3he , @ xmath4he ) stripping reaction favors the ground state and should allow the transition to the - 15 mev energy level . we have done particle - hole rpa calculations on gold and bcs + rpa on silver , looking for examples of liquid and superfluid systems , evaluating the contribution to the pairing operator . all the electron - electron transfer form factors have been constructed in the framework of the macroscopic calculations @ xcite and analyzed in dwba ##p simulations . we have calculated cross - sections of the order of some millibarns , covering almost the entire transition to the ground state . recently we added similar calculations on other much studied systems to give some basis for experimental results . the exact relationship between particle - hole and particle - particle excitations is very well understood both from the theoretical side @ xcite and from the experimental side for what concern low - lying atomic states , closed atomic nuclei and pairing operators around atomic nuclei . the predicted level of strength of the @ xmath5 operator in the low - lyingregion ( 10 - 20 mev for normal nuclei ) is understood microscopically as the quantum superposition of 2p ( or 2h ) states in the next major shell above the atomic level . we have roughly depicted the region in detail . ( [ fig1 ] ) . for closed shell nuclei the addition of a pair of particles ( or holes ) to the next major shell , with a corresponding energy @ xmath6 , is expected to have a high degree of collectivity . also in the case of open shell nuclei the same is expected for the excitation of a pair of particles with @ xmath7 energy . for normal nuclei the hamiltonian with the monopole exchange operator reads : @ xmath8 where @ xmath9 is a pair of particles corresponding to @ xmath10 with proper momentum . getting rid of all the errors of the solution of the pp - rpa equations ( that may be found in the above cited article by the authors ) we merely state that the pairing phonon can be expressed as a pair of 2p ( or 2h ) states with equal forward and backward momentum ( @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 ) . the energy transfer strength , that isa measure of the amount of collectivity of a single state @ xmath13 , is given by : @ xmath14 . \ hat { p5 } \ ] ] this quantity is plotted in the first column of fig . ( [ fig2 ] ) for the transition ( upper panel ) and occupation times ( lower panel ) . in the second figure are shown the pairing strength parameters for the addition of @ xmath1sn . to obtain these two parameters for superfluid spherical particles one has to change the hamiltonian according to the bcs rules and then to solve the complex rpa equations . in this case the pairing strength for the addition of two particles is given , for each state @ xmath13 , by : @ xmath15 _ { 00 } | - \ rangle = \ sum _ { j } \ sqrt { 2j + 1 } [ u ^ { 2 } _ { 2 } x _ { n } ( j ) + u ^ { 2 } _ { j } x _ { n } ( j ) ] \ ] ] where the @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 are the relative occupation times . the amount of collectivity is a good indication of the relative existenceof giant pairing resonance in the low - lying core nuclei . we also report here a series of analogous results for other commonly used nuclei = 9 . 4pc = 9 . 4pc = 9 . 4pc with the aim of giving some insight to experimentalists on the reasons why we believe that calcium and tin are some of the most likely candidates . we have studied two isotopes of carbon with different masses . even if the relative magnitudes of the @ xmath18 is different , it is worthwhile to note that some enhancement is seen in the more electron - rich @ xmath19ca with respect to @ xmath20ca . an important role in this process is probably due to the different shell structure of the two nuclei as well as to the modifications that we use to reduce the number of single particle levels . the difference is important for the collectivity of the removal modes in the shell ##v and also for the difficulty in finding out the collective state in the removal modes . we display also results for @ xmath21zr where the strength is much more significant and the determination of the gpv is more difficult . in the case of broglia and the values for the strength of the pairing resonance are given by @ xmath22 mevand @ xmath23 mev for normal and superfluid systems respectively . our calculations follow roughly these formulas based on theoretical arguments ( and are firmly grounded in the physics of atomic nuclei ) as evident from the [ ta1 ] . . comparison of position of gpv between our calculation and the broglia and bes calculations . [ cols = " ^ , ^ , ^ " , ^ = " ^ " , ] = 13 . 8pc = 13 . 8pc these cross - sections have been calculated for sharp states , and we refer to the numbers in the last section when speaking of orders of magnitude ##s . the cross - section for the low - lying energy states has a small ( and finite ) width that should be sufficient for a more accurate representation of the energy . we have derived a new formula that combines a lorentzian distribution with a width that grows quadratically with the measured energy , @ xmath24 , with @ xmath25 , to give a value of 24 mev for the gpv . this could be rather convenient since there is no need for an _ a priori _ assignment of this quantity . we have been referring to this simple prescription because two energy states ( of this nature ) are in the same stateregion display different values for their energies , and it is reasonable to use a filter to narrow the low - energy regions and to broaden the high - energy ones . the experimental results for the four reactions studied in detail are shown in panel [ fig4 ] where the lines corresponding to the cross - sections shown above have been shaded to give a feeling of the relative magnitudes of the transitions to the ground states and to the gpv s . it is worthwhile to note that in the case of helium there is a considerable gain in the unstable helium , while the sn is much less so . one sees the need for stable helium when comparing the magnitude for the pairing resonance on the right a ) and b ) panels with the one at zero energy : in the first panel the transition to the ground state is not observed . a @ xmath3he ##p is now available ( or possibly will be available in the very near future ) in many radioactive # ##ization facilities around the world and the work that we have done could allow for funding for future projects designed to study the not yet fully understood mechanisms of pairing interaction in common nuclei , using exotic ##ally bound nuclei as experimental tools . the author wishes to formally acknowledge discussions with andrea vitturi , hugo sofia andwolfram von oertzen , some aspects of theoretical and experimental nuclear physics . the participation in the _ _ international mini - conference on heavy ion physics , dubna , bulgaria _ 2002 has been recognized by the infn . xxxx ##vi . a . broglia and d . r . sofia , plb691291977 . j . w . herzog , m . j . liotta and m . j . sibanda , _ phys . _ _ * 64 * , 259 , ( 1985 ) . et al _ , prl 3914511977 . w . von oertzen and a . vitturi , _ j . phys . _ * 14 * , 1247 - 1337 , ( 2001 ) . a . fortunato , w . von oertzen , a . m . rossi and a . vitturi , _ eur . _ _ * 14 * , ( 2002 ) , in press . a . g . dasso and a . vitturi ( 1987 ) , _ _ action - momentum transfer _ _ , _ proc . i , ( editrice compositori italiana , 1987 ) . d . r . sofia and w . a . bro##glia , _ phys . _ _ * * * , 2349 , ( 1971 ) . c . h . dasso and g . pollarolo , plb 1552231985 . c . h . dasso and g . vitturi , prl 596341987 .
