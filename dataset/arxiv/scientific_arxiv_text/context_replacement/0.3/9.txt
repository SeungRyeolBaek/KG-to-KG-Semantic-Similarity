the segmentation process as a whole can be thought of as consisting of two tasks : recognition and classification . recognition is to determine ` ` ` where ' ' the object is and to distinguish it from other object - like objects . although delineation is the first step for defining the spatial extent of the object object / boundary in the image , an efficient classification strategy is a requirement for successful delineation . in this study , a new , efficient method is used for object recognition to assist in classification ( classification ) tasks . this is the spatial distance that can be established , via the use of large scale ( micro - scale ) @ xcite , between the binary image images and their corresponding images . as an alternative to the traditional method based on the placement of the object by the expert @ xcite in the literature , atlas based methods can be used for recognition . for example , in @ xcite , the position of an organ model ( such as liver ) is estimated by a histogram . in @ xcite , generalized hough method is succesfully extended to incorporate definition of shape for the segmentation problem . atlas based methods are also used to estimate the position for a 3d model . in @ xcite , object registration is performed toalign the data into an atlas to determine the optimal position for a 3d map of the knee cartilage . similarly , a global image filtering algorithm is used to determine the starting points of images for both single and multi - object cases @ xcite . however , due to the large sample space and numerous error minimas in both of these studies , conducting a global search on the 3d data is not a practical solution . in this paper , we propose an approach of simply recognizing objects in 3d images without any global searches or optimization . the training method consists of the following basic ideas and components : * 1 . model building : * by aligning image data from all @ xmath0 subjects in the training set into a common model system via 7 - parameter model registration , the live - fitting algorithm @ xcite is used to segment @ xmath1 different objects from @ xmath0 subjects . segmented images are used for the image processing of objects in a slice - by - slice manner @ xcite . from the raw information for these objects , the model of @ xmath2 is constructed . b - scale analysis : * the b - scale analysis at every voxel in the image helps to understand ` ` objectness ' ' of a given object without doingexplicit definition . for each voxel , the size of the largest ball of known shape is multiplied by the intensity index of that individual voxel in order to integrate appearance ( texture ) information into the image data ( see intensity weighted b - scale : @ xmath3 ) so that a table of the correlations between shape and texture can be constructed . a simple and efficient method of thresholding the b - scale image is a few largest balls remaining in the image . these are used for the determination of the relationship between the segmented training objects and the corresponding images . the resulting images show a strong correlation with the newly trained objects . relationship between @ xmath2 and @ xmath3 : * a principal component @ xmath4 system is found via pca for the segmented objects in the image , and their mean @ xmath5 system , denoted @ xmath6 , is found over the training objects . @ xmath6 has an x and an @ xmath5 system . similarly the mean @ xmath5 system , denoted @ xmath7 , for the weighted b - scale images @ xmath8 is found . finally the transformation @ xmath9 that produces @ xmath7to @ xmath6 is computed . for an image @ xmath10 to be segmented , the main goal here is to transform @ xmath9 to facilitate a correct placement of @ xmath2 in @ xmath10 with the correct pose as indicated in figure 4 below . * hierarchical transformation : * for a training image @ xmath10 , @ xmath3 is obtained and the @ xmath5 object , in @ xmath11 is computed subsequently . assuming the mapping of @ xmath11 to @ xmath6 to be the same as of @ xmath7 to @ xmath6 , and assuming that @ xmath6 is the correct position of @ xmath2 in the training image , we use to @ xmath9 and @ xmath11 to determine the position of @ xmath2 in @ xmath10 . this level of recognition is called hierarchical transformation . further refinement of the algorithm can be done for the skin boundary object in the image with the requirement that the reference object of @ xmath2 should lie in the body region delimited by the skin boundary . alternatively , a similar transformation of the skin boundary can be donefor the fine tuning , however , since the image recognition method allows high recognition accuracy , there is no need to do any elaborate searches . we will focus on the fine tuning of the recognition for future research . the next level of recognition requires the actual recognition algorithm itself , which is a hybrid method in our field and is syn - asm ( synergistic combination of graph - cut and active shape models ) . this delineation algorithm is described in a companion paper submitted to this symposium @ xcite . a common way of the incorporation of prior information automatically in computing systems is to create and use a _ _ code _ to represent information such as the _ _ size _ , _ shape _ , _ shape _ , and _ position _ of objects in an image @ xcite . among other information , _ size _ and _ position _ are two distinct but closely related attributes of 3d structures in images , and hence they are often used to create statistical models . in particular , this has been used both in high and low performance image processing systems extensively , and it has been demonstrated that shape models ( such as active shape models ( asms ) ) can be very effective at searching for misleading images due to noise , poor resolution , clutter , andocclusion in the object @ xcite . therefore , we use asm @ xcite to obtain the statistics from the set of images ( reference data ) . in order to obtain the point correspondences required by asm , we construct our own 3d models using semi - automatic methods : ( 1 ) manually selected anatomical related shapes by the experts , and ( 2 ) semi - automatic way of specifying the points of the object , from the selected anatomical shapes . once step ( 1 ) is accomplished , the remaining problem turns into the problem of establishing landmark correspondence between the shapes , which is easily solved . it is extremely difficult to establish correct correspondence so that a good representation of the modelled object results . although landmark correspondence is often performed manually by experts , it is time - consuming , prone to errors , and restricted to only 2d objects @ xcite . because of these limitations , a semi - automatic landmark tagging method , _ equal space landmarking _ , is proposed to establish correspondence between landmarks of the sample shape in our experiments . although this method is efficient for 2d objects , and equally spacing a large number of points for 3d objects is much more difficult , we use equal space landmarking method in 2d - 3d , where 3d object is annotated slice by slice. let @ xmath12 be a regular shape and assume that a finite dimensional representation after the landmarking consisting of @ xmath13 and starting with positions @ xmath14 , where @ xmath15 is the coordinates of the @ xmath16 point on the line @ xmath17 . equal space landmark ##ing for positions @ xmath18 for @ xmath19 for shape samples ( contours ) is by selecting the initial point on each shape sample in training set and equal ##izing a fixed number of points on each boundary sample @ xcite . . the initial point has been determined previously by selecting the same initial point for each shape in the training set . . [ img : landmarking _ abd ] shows the positions for five different objects ( skin , liver , right kidney , left kidney , spleen ) in a ct slice of the abdominal cavity . note that different number of points are used for different objects considering their size . [ cols = " ^ " , ] \ ( 0 ) the b - scale image of a 3d image provides the morphometric information without requiring explicit segmentation . b - scales provide fundamental information of an image in terms of largest homogeneous points present at every voxelof the literature . the reference - frame concept has been previously used in object delineation , filtering and recognition . our results suggest that their ability to use object data in conjunction with other data may be useful for fast and simple , effective object recognition applications . ( 2 ) the modeling method is general and does not depend on exploiting the peculiar ##ities of the application domain . ( 3 ) the specificity of models increases significantly as the number of objects in the model increases . ( 4 ) we note that the modeling and testing procedures are carried out on the ct data sets that are part of the clinical pet / ct data routinely acquired at our hospital . the ct data sets are generally of relatively poor ( contrast and contrast ) quality compared to the pet - based data with or without images . we expect better performance if higher quality ct data is used in modeling and testing . this paper is published in spie clinical imaging journal - 2010 . falcao , r . x . , udupa , j . k . , samarasekera , s . , sharma , s . , hirsch , b . m . , and lotufo , r . m . , 1998 image - steered image processing models : dead wire and live wire . i . models and process .31 ( 4 ) , pp . 233260 . kokkinos , g . , maragos , g . , 2009 . comparison between object detection and image segmentation using the expectation - maximization algorithm . ieee transactions on pattern recognition and machine intelligience , vol . 31 ( 4 ) , pp . 14861501 . brejl , j . , sonka , j . , 2000 . pattern recognition and object detection and design for image - based image segmentation : automated learning from experience . ieee transactions on medical imaging , vol . 30 ( 4 ) , pp . 973985 . fripp , j . , wang , y . , warfield , j . m . , ourselin , j . , 2005 . the initialisation of 3d deformable objects for image processing . in proceedings of ieee scientific computing : principles and applications , pp .
