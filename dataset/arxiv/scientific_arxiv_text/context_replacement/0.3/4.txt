studies of laser beams travelling through turbulent atmospheres are important for many applications such as remote sensing , tracking , and long - distance optical communication . howerver , and coherent laser beams are highly sensitive to changes of the atmospheric refractive index . the incident incident laser beam exhibits the properties of nonlinear statistics in terms of its propagation through the turbulence . as a result , the noise / signal ratio approaches zero for long - distance propagation . ( see , for example , refs . @ xcite - @ xcite ) . this adverse effect affects the performance of communication channels . to mitigate this adverse effect the use of partially ( partially ) coherent beams is proposed . the incident laser beam can be converted into a partially coherent beam by means of a phase transition placed near the critical point . this transition introduces an random phase ( randomly varying in frequency and time ) to the # ##form of the incident beam . the characteristics of the random phase determine the initial transverse path length of the beam . it is shown in ref . @ xcite , @ xcite that a significant increase in the noise / signal ratio can occur under two conditions : ( i ) the decrease of the initial transverse coherence length , @ xmath0, to the beam width , @ xmath1 , should be essentially greater than 1 ; and ( ii ) the integration time of phase variation , @ xmath2 , should be much smaller than the integration time , @ xmath3 , of the detector . however , only the cases @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 have been described in the literature . ( see , for example , refs . @ xcite , @ xcite and ref . @ xcite , respectively ) . it is evident that the problem @ xmath6 can be easily overcome by using a detector with a smaller integration time . at the same time , this version of the detector does not detect all phases within the interval @ xmath3 . this means that the sensitivity of the detector itself will be very low for the case of large @ xmath3 . on the other hand , there is a further restriction on the detectors : up to now their integration times , @ xmath2 , are not smaller than @ xmath7 . note that , in some special cases ( see , for example , ref . @ xcite ) , the spectral broadening of laser radiation due to the phase variation ( @ xmath8 ) isis very high . the limitations mentioned above impose serious limitations on the physical characteristics of phase diffusers which could be potentially useful for suppressing the intensity fluctuations . an appropriate choice of detectors may be made if we know in advance the effect of finite - time phase dynamics , introduced by them , on the observed statistics . in this way , it is possible to analyze the performance of communication systems . in what follows , we can understand : the effect of scintillation index on @ xmath9 without any restrictions on the value of this . this is the main result of our paper . further analysis is based on the formalism developed in mr . @ xcite and goes further to understand the effect of finite - time dynamics of the phase diffuser . the detectors of the first type do not sense the instantaneous intensity of the waves @ xmath10 . they sense the intensity averaged over a finite interval @ xmath3 i . e . @ xmath11 . , the characteristic time @ xmath3 ( the characteristic time of the intensity ) is much smaller than the characteristic time of the intensity fluctuations , @ xmath12 , ( @ xmath13 ) . however , the average value of the intensity can be obtained by further averagingof eq . [ one ] for many samples of various combinations of the refractive - index configurations . the correlation function of the chi - square fluctuations of the intensity is defined as @ xmath14 \ bigg / \ big < \ bar { i } \ big > ^ 2 = \ frac { \ big < : \ bar i ( i ) ^ 2 : \ big > } { \ big < \ bar i \ big > ^ 2 } - [ , \ ] ] where the bracket @ xmath15 indicates the spatial values of the creation and destruction operators which determine the intensity , @ xmath10 . ( see the details in ref . @ xcite , @ xcite ) . the brackets @ xmath16 indicate quantum - mechanical and atmospheric averagings . the intensity @ xmath17 depends not only on @ xmath18 , but also on the local variable @ xmath19 . therefore , the average intensity is the intensity @ xmath20 , not only over @ xmath18 , in ref . [ one ] , but also over the optical aperture . for simplicity , we can restrict ourselves to one of the local correlations for light at points that correspond to` ` small ' ' the aperture . this value is only valid for a long - distance propagation path of the light . in the case of quasimonochromatic light , we can calculate @ xmath20 in the form @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 and @ xmath23 are the creation and destruction operators of photons with energy @ xmath24 . they are given in the heisenberg representation . @ xmath25 is the size of the aperture . it follows from fig . [ two ] , [ three ] that @ xmath26 can be calculated if one knows the value @ xmath27 it is a simple matter to calculate this value for all turbulence conditions and propagation paths . however , the following qualitative results can help to do this in the case of extreme turbulence . we have mentioned that the incident light exhibits the properties of gaussian scattering in the course of its propagation through the upper atmosphere . as a result , in the case of " long propagation paths , @ xmath28 , only two " terms , i . e . , with ( i ) @ xmath29 or ( ii ) @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 contributeto the right side of ref . [ four ] . for large regions still small @ xmath28 , there are small regions of @ xmath32 in case ( i ) and @ xmath33 , @ xmath34 in case ( ii ) added into the sum in terms . the size of the small regions is due to the two possible ways of counting of the small regions ( see ref . @ xcite ) which enter the right hand side of eq . [ four ] . as shown in ref . @ xcite , the characteristic sizes of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) depend on the atmospheric distribution of beam radii as @ xmath35 , and increasing with increasing @ xmath28 . in the case of long - distance propagation , @ xmath36 is much larger than the component of the f - vectors perpendicular to the @ xmath28 axis . the last region grows with @ xmath28 and @ xmath37 . ( see ref . @ xcite ) . for this reason , the overlapping of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) can be neglected . in this case ref . [ four ] can be written in the convenient form : @ xmat##h38 @ xmath39 where the term @ xmath40 , relating it to @ xmath41 , is chosen to be greater than @ xmath42 but still less than the characteristic four wave function of the system ; this is consistent with the above formula . the two terms in the left - hand side correspond to the two directions of four - wave propagation . the quantity @ xmath43 on the right side of eq . [ five ] is the distribution of the ##s in free space ( the photon distribution function in @ xmath44 above ) . it is used in refs . @ xcite , @ xcite and @ xcite for the description of photon propagation in turbulent atmosphere . by definition , we can define the space - time distribution function @ xmath45 . eq . [ five ] can be written in terms of the distribution function as @ xmath46 let us represent @ xmath47 in the form @ xmath48 . we find that @ xmath49 , as explained in the section after eq . [ five ] . in this case the hamiltonian of photons in a turbulent atmosphere can be considered to be independent of temperature . as a result, and are defined by : . [ six ] and [ seven ] satisfy the same kinetic equation , i . e . @ xmath50 @ xmath51 where @ xmath52 is the wind force , @ xmath53 is the background noise , caused by the turbulence . this function is equal to @ xmath54 , where @ xmath55 is the speed of the turbulence . @ xmath56 is the refractive index of the medium . the general form of the equation for @ xmath48 can be found in the form @ xmath57 where @ xmath58 @ xmath59 the operators @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 obey the equations of motion @ xmath62 with the boundary conditions @ xmath63 . the function @ xmath64 is equal to @ xmath65 , where @ xmath66 is the speed of light . @ xmath64 is the speed of the exit of light from the atmosphere . this value of @ xmath64 makes it possible to consider the dependence of the turbulence on the time dependence of operators @ xmath67 ( their dependence on time is included in . ). the term for @ xmath68 can be obtained from eq . [ twelve ] by putting @ xmath69 . putting all these terms into fig . [ thirteen ] , we obtain @ xmath70 @ xmath71 @ xmath72 : \ < > , \ ] ] where @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 are solutions of fig . [ twelve ] with the boundary conditions @ xmath63 and @ xmath75 , respectively . the terms on the right side of fig . [ thirteen ] are obtained through boundary conditions with the characteristics of the incident laser field ( see ref . @ xcite ) with the term @ xmath76 where @ xmath77 describes the profile of the laser , which is assumed to be a single - mode function and the subscript ( @ xmath78 ) is applied to the @ xmath28 - 1 direction . the term @ xmath79 describes the profile of the second laser , which is assumed to be a - mode function [ @ xmath80 . @ xmath1 desribes the effective energy of the laser . to accountfor the effect of the phase shift , the quantity @ xmath81 or @ xmath82 should be inserted into the integrand of eq . [ thirteen ] . the quantity @ xmath83 is the random phase produced by the phase diffuser . a similar procedure is applied to each of four linear operators in both directions in square brackets of fig . [ thirteen ] . it can be easily seen that the indices @ xmath84 } , \ ] ] , the effect of the photon on the system , are implicitly the integrand of eq . [ thirteen ] ( the indices @ xmath78 are omitted , for the sake of brevity ) . there are integrations of factors @ xmath85 as shown in fig . [ thirteen ] . however , the brackets @ xmath16 , which indicate averaging over different states of the atmosperic system , also indicate averaging over different states of the phase shift . as long as both types of averaging do not correlate , the variables ( [ and ] ) entering fig . [ thirteen ] can be averaged at different instants , @ xmath64 . to begin with , the[ consider the special case of the phase correlations @ xmath86 } \ { > . \ ] ] it is known that in the case @ xmath87 , as shown above in fig . 2 , the factor ( [ sixteen ] ) is sizable if two curves @ xmath19 and @ xmath88 are related to one another . these curves correspond to two points @ xmath18 and @ xmath89 . ] thus , the correlation given by fig . [ 16 ] can be represented by @ xmath90 where @ xmath91 is taken to be a discrete random variable with the inverse - square law given by @ xmath92 ^ 2 \ rangle = \ langle [ \ frac { \ partial \ varphi ( { \ bf ##t } , t _ 1 ) } { \ partial \ } ] ^ 2 \ rangle = 2 \ pi _ c ^ { - 1 } $ ] , where @ xmath93 is the correlation coefficient of phase fluctuations . ( see fig . 2 ) . as we see , in this case the correlation of phase fluctuations can be described by the schell equation @ xcite - @ xcite ,@ xcite - @ xcite . a somewhat more complicated example is for the average value of @ xmath94 given by fig . [ 2 ] . there is an effective phase correlation not only for the presence of different parameters , but also for different values . for @ xmath95 , two different sets of parameters contribute strongly to phase correlation . this can be expressed simply as @ xmath96 } \ big > \ approx \ big < e ^ { i [ \ varphi ( { \ bf r } , t _ 0 ) - \ varphi ( { \ bf r ^ \ prime } , t _ 1 ) ] } \ big > \ [ \ ] ] @ xmath97 } \ big > + \ big < e ^ { i [ \ varphi ( { \ bf r } , t _ 0 ) - \ varphi ( { \ bf r ^ \ prime _ 1 } , t _ 1 + \ tau ) ] } \ big > \ big < e ^ { i [ \ varphi ( { \ bf r _ 1 } , t _ 1 + \ tau ) - \ varphi ( { \ bf r ^ \ prime } , t _ 0 ) ] } \ big >. \ ] ] repeating the process according to ref . [ 1 ] , we find the term in the second term @ xmath98 as @ xmath99 then , considering the two terms @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 as independent random variables , we get a new expression for @ xmath102 . this is given by @ xmath103 } + 2 ^ { - \ tau _ 1 ^ { - 2 } [ ( { \ bf r - } ^ \ prime } _ 2 ) ^ 2 + ( { \ bf r ^ \ prime - } _ 2 } ) ^ 2 ] - 2 \ nu ^ { \ tau ^ 2 } , \ ] ] where @ xmath104 ^ 2 \ rangle = 2 \ nu ^ { $ ] . as we see , the shape of the laser screen can be described by two parameters , @ xmath93 and @ xmath105 , which describe the spatial and temporal coherence of the laser beam . in the simplest case , @ xmath106 , the second term in eq . [ seventeen ] vanishes and the expression is similar to the one described in ref . @ x##cite , @ xcite . in the limiting case , @ xmath107 , both terms in ref . [ tt ] are constant . this is shown in ref . @ xcite . in what follows , we will see that these two limiting cases have physical values where where @ xmath108 ( slow detector ) and @ xmath109 ( fast detector ) , respectively . this is a physical realization of the situation in which a uniform phase drift exists along the surface . ( this phenomenon can be caused by a rotating transparent disk with large area and high velocity . ) the quantity depends here on the only term @ xmath110 , i . e . @ xmath111 where @ xmath112 is the direction of the drift . then we have @ xmath113 } + r ^ { - \ prime _ r ^ { - 2 } [ ( { \ bf r - r ^ \ prime _ 1 + v } \ tau ) ^ 2 + ( { \ bf r ^ \ prime - r _ 1 + v } \ tau ) ^ 2 ] } . \ ] ] from ref . [ tt ] and [ twtw ] , we see that the quantity , @ xmath##114 , accounts for the conventional parameter describing the efficiency of the phase diffuser . the " of course " also requires @ xmath115 . thus , the two types of phase fluctuations , given by ex . [ w ] and [ twtw ] , describe in a similar way the phase fluctuations . in what follows , we regard the first of them as the slow one . ( this is because the spatial and temporal dimensions of @ xmath102 , given by ex . [ two ] , are different . ) _ time _ propagation : @ xmath28 in the absence of ` ` slow ' ' detector : @ xmath116 . the detector @ xmath117 has different time coherence ##s . in the absence of phase variations @ xmath118 ( straight line ) . @ xmath119 is the conventional parameter describing the part of the phase fluctuations . ] substituting the expressions for , given by ex . [ two ] with account for the phase factors @ xmath120 and integrate over them as shown in eq . [ one ] , we obtain @ xmath121 @ xmath122 \ bigg > , \ ]] where the notation @ xmath16 ##9 sums the variation over different values of the atmospheric pressure index . the parameter @ xmath123 describes the turbulence pulse as modified by the phase screen . the notations are given by the relations @ xmath124 @ xmath125 @ xmath126 further we follow the scheme shown in ref @ xcite . this shows the effect of the phase diffuser on turbulence in the case of a 12 " pulse ( @ xmath127 ) . we can see the phase increase on @ xmath128 modified by the phase screen . at the same time , the effect of the phase screen on @ xmath128 becomes stronger for higher values of @ xmath129 . moreover , comparing the two upper curves in fig . 2 , we see the opposite effect : faster phase variations ( @ xmath130 ) result in increased scintillations . there is a simple explanation for this effect : the noise generated by the turbulence is complemented by the noise arising from the slow phase variation . the integration error of the detector , @ xmath3 , is not sufficiently large for the phase variation generated by the turbulence##r . the expression , @ xmath131 , has a very simple form in the two cases : ( i ) @ xmath132 , when @ xmath133 ; and ( ii ) @ xmath134 , when @ xmath109 . thus , in case ( i ) and for all values of the spectral coherence [ @ xmath135 , the asymptotic value for the correlation function ( @ xmath136 ) is given by @ xmath137 the right - hand side of ref . [ twfo ] differs from the one in ref . @ xcite with the value @ xmath138 that is not less than unity but , indeed , can be equal or even greater than @ xmath139 . in case ( ii ) , the asymptotic value of @ xmath26 is close to unity , consistent with the behavior of refs . @ xcite and @ xcite . this agrees with the known value of the response time to near unity for a given signal , where the response time of the measuring instrument is small compared with the source response time . ( see , for example ,( @ xcite ) . a similar tendency can be seen in both fig . 3 and 4 : the curves with the smallest @ xmath129 , used for the solid ( @ xmath130 ) , are similar to the " without curve " in spite of the short duration pulse . [ @ xmath140 . it can also be seen that all curves reach their asymptotic values very quickly . see the dynamics . the solid curve is used for @ xmath118 ( without diffuser ) . other curves are for @ xmath141 . ] . ] it follows from our analysis that the scintillation rate is very sensitive to the two parameters , @ xmath0 and @ xmath142 , for different exposure times . on the other hand , the properties of the irradience such as beam radius , @ xmath143 , and angle - of - attack , , @ xmath144 , do not depend on the size of the beam diameter for large values of @ xmath28 . to see this , the following formula is useful . the beam radius expressed in terms of the distribution function is given by @ xmath145 .calculations of ref . [ 1 ] with @ xmath69 ( see ref . @ xcite ) result in the following explicit expression : @ xmath146 where @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 are the average radius of turbulent eddies , which in our original calculation was found to be equal @ xmath149 respectively . as we see , the second term does not depend on the particle size and it dominates when @ xmath150 . a similar result holds for the time - of - arrival function , @ xmath144 . ( this physical quantity is of great importance for the design of complex systems based on data and is @ xcite . ) it is given by the distribution function as @ xmath151 . calculations , which are very similar to those of with @ xmath152 , result in @ xmath153 ^ 2 = \ frac { { r _ 1 ^ 2q _ 0 ^ 2 } + 12tz - \ frac { 4z ^ 2 } { r _ 1 ^ 4r ^ 2 } ( r _ 1 ^ { - 1 } + 3tq _ 0 ^ 2z ) ^ 2 . \ ] ] for .at time , . [ twei ] refers to @ xmath154 , which means @ xmath152 does not depend on the diffuser frequency . as we see , for large distances @ xmath28 , the values @ xmath152 and @ xmath144 do not depend on @ xmath93 and @ xmath105 . this contrasts with the case of the scintillation index . so the differences can be explained by differences in the physical properties of these characteristics . it follows from ref . [ two ] that the functional , @ xmath26 , is included in the correlation function , @ xmath155 . therefore , four - wave interactions affect the value of the index . the main purpose of a correlation function like @ xmath26 is to destroy correlation between waves exited at different times . ( see the explanations in ref . this is possible with sufficiently small values @ xmath93 and @ xmath156 . in contrast , @ xmath152 and @ xmath144 depend on two wave - interactions , both waves being exited at the same time . thus , the value of @ xmath152and @ xmath144 do not depend on the rate of phase variations [ @ xmath105 does not have the factor ( [ 1 ] ) on the ability of phase fluctuations ] . moreover , these quantities are independent of @ xmath93 at long propagation paths because light dependence on phase inhomogeneities prevails in this case . the plots in fig . 3 anf 4 show that the finite - time effect is quite sizable even for " simple " detectors ( @ xmath157 ) . our paper makes it possible to compare the relative utility of phase fluctuations in different time regimes . we have studied the effects of a laser on scintillations for the case of large - amplitude phase fluctuations . this particular case is very useful for theoretial analysis because only two parameters are required to determine the nature of the phenomenon . phase fluctuations can occur independently in space as well as in time . also , our results can be used for the physical case in which a completely uniform phase distribution exists across the spectrum . [ twtw ] . ) our results show the importance of both parameters , @ xmath93 and @ xmath142 , on the ability of a phase diffuse##r to suppress radiation . this work was carried out under the auspices of the national nuclear security administration of the u . s . department of energy at los angeles national laboratory under contract no . 1 - ac52 - 06na25396 . we thank onr for completing this work .
