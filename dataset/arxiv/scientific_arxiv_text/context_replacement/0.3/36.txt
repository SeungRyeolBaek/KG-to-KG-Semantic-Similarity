there are reasons to believe that cosmic rays ( rays ) around the ankle at @ xmath0 gev are dominated by extragalactic protons @ xcite . certain conditions in the cosmic microwave background ( cr ) limit the presence of ultra high energy ( uhe ) charged particles in our environment . the continuation of a power - law cr spectrum above the klein - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) limit @ xcite and at @ xmath1 gev is only consistent with the cr spectrum if the particles are below the threshold attenuation length of about 1 mpc . very few particle accelerators can generate particles with energies above the gzk limit ( see e . g . @ xcite for a comparison ) and so far none of the candidate sources have been confirmed in our local environment . it has been suggested that other superheavy particles , possibly some other form of dark matter or composed of atomic defects , could be a source of uhe crs , but also these observations are not necessarily consistent with the cr spectrum at higher energies @ xcite . the observation of gzk excesses has led to speculations about a possible origin of uhe spectra . bere##zinsky and zatsepin @ xcite proposed that _ cosmogenic _ particles produced in the decay of the gzk photopions could explain these events with a strong neutrino _ interaction . we have developed this model at ref . @ xcite and tested the statistical significance of scenarios with strongly interacting neutrinos from optically thin sources with cr ##s from agasa @ xcite and rice @ xcite ( see ref . [ cr ] ) and limits from horizontal observations at agasa @ xcite and vertical events at rice @ xcite . - branes , and string theory ( see ref . @ xcite ) . ] the emission of uhe by protons from these sources is redshifted and also contributes to @ xmath2 pair production and photopion - production at the source which can be taken into account for analysis of propagation rates . the resonantly emitted photopions provide a _ secondary _ source of _ uhe as seen at rice . in astrophysical simulations inelastic decay of the beam produced by the heavy molecular gas in the atmosphere will also produce photopions which provide an additional source of uhe .##s . the corresponding spectrum will in turn depend on the properties of the source such as the densities of the incident light and the ambient temperature @ xcite . we have used the distribution of crs from _ optically thin _ sources using the model given in ref . @ xcite in the goodness - of - fit approach . for a consistent and consistent distribution of extragalactic particles in the crs one has to assume a strong and significant component of the neutrino nucleon population . the existence of such a behavior has been proposed in areas beyond the ( perturbative ) sm ( see ref . @ xcite ) . for example , we have used the strong - nucleon cross section in our analysis of a @ xmath3 - behavior shown in fig . [ fig ] , parameterized by the energy scale and frequency of the decay , and the uncertainty compared to the standard model spectrum . our analysis shows that uhe spectra measured at agasa and rice can be interpreted to the 90 % accuracy . the composition of extragalactic particles and their excited states from optically thin sources in agreement with experimental data from horizontal events at agasa and vertical events at rice( see fig . [ 2 ] ) . the new space experiment confirmed the same results of agasa and resulted in a new model . with much higher energy levels , much better statistics and also less dependence on the distance , will also help to clarify our understanding of uhe crs in the future . the author would like to thank the organizers of the erice workshop on particle physics 2005 _ ` ` physics in space , in astro , particle and nuclear physics ' ' _ for the inspiring workshop and vihkos ( _ ` ` virtuelles institut fur hochenergiestrahlungen aus dem kosmos ' ' _ ) for support . m . ahlers , m . ringwald , and h . tu , _ astropart .
