we shall use the multiplicity - free group characters given by the actions of these groups and their conjugacy classes . for this we shall use the first lemma , also due to frobenius , which implies that ##plicity - free permutation characters can arise from permutation actions with relatively small degrees of freedom . [ lemma : tworow ] let @ xmath95 be a permutation group acting on @ xmath96 . let @ xmath5 be the permutation character of the action of @ xmath1 on the cosets of @ xmath37 . let @ xmath97 be the set of orbits of @ xmath37 and @ xmath98 - orbits of @ xmath96 . if @ xmath99 = @ xmath100 we shall then use the forms of young s rule and pieri s rule given in the section above . note that pieri s rule differs from young s rule if we conjugate to the same rule , so there is no need for us to use the littlewood s rule .

( it follows from the notation at the bottom of page 342 of saxl s paper that these groups should be considered for inclusion , and in particular ,give rise to splitting - free characters . ) we now examine each of saxl s cases in detail . the most important case ( a1 ) is left to the reader , and we consider case ( a1 ) along with ( ii ) and ( iii ) . we shall also need the well - known fact ( see for example @ xcite ) that if @ xmath4 is a subgroup of @ xmath182 where @ xmath183 is the corresponding partition to @ xmath4 . ( note that @ xmath183 is the partition generated by @ xmath184 ; the diagram of @ xmath183 is derived from the diagram of @ xmath4 by placing it in the upper diagonal . ) we shall also frequently need the fact that if @ xmath185 and @ xmath186 are splitting - free , then @ xmath89 is also multiplicity - free . if @ xmath187 and @ xmath188 then the characters from this case also are multiplicity - free characters . they contribute to our case ( a1 ) . if then it follows from comparison with jones s rule and pieri s rule that @ xmath##189 so , for @ xmath55 in this case , @ xmath190 is identity - free unless @ xmath31 and @ xmath191 . when @ xmath31 it is easily seen that @ xmath192 is not identity - free , but if @ xmath37 contains one of the other two index @ xmath30 - subgroup of @ xmath193 , namely @ xmath194 or @ xmath195 , then @ xmath89 _ index _ multiplicity - free . this includes the odd groups in our case ( a1 ) and the groups in case ( a2 ) . if @ xmath2 is even then we have to dealt with all the groups from saxl in case ( b1 ) . if @ xmath47 is odd then we still have to deal with the group of @ xmath196 , containing @ xmath197 . a method used to show that all these groups are multiplicity - free is ; they are in our case ( b2 ) . there are three index @ xmath30 subgroup of @ xmath49 , @ @ xmath51 , @ x##math198 and its subgroup , which we shall denote order @ xmath199 . example : overleaf shows the lattice of groups we shall consider ; note that they are in bijection with the lattice of the dihedral group of order @ xmath200 .

( in the second induction rule , young s rule may be replaced with the ordinary induction rule : see ( * ? ? ? * * 9 ) . ) however , if @ xmath37 is a subgroup of @ xmath51 , then @ xmath219 is not identity - free . similarly , note that the permutation character induced from @ xmath202 is not identity - free , but the character induced from @ xmath198and @ xmath199 respectively . this gives the homogeneous subgroup in our group ( b2 ) . we now turn to saxl # ##n ( v ) . the characters @ xmath220 for @ xmath221 are all @ xmath222 - homogeneous . ( it follows from young s rule and lemma 4 that this is a sufficient condition for the induced subgroup @ xmath223 to be zero - free for each @ xmath2 . ) they are : the @ xmath30 - transitive frobenius subgroup @ xmath224 ; the @ xmath32 - homogeneous subgroup @ xmath225 ; and the @ xmath32 - homogeneous but @ xmath150 - homogeneous subgroup @ xmath226 . here @ xmath69 denotes the normal extension of @ xmath227 given by the identity @ xmath32 frobenius twist @ xmath228 . then using young s rule shows that the corresponding characters @ xmath229 are all multiplicity - free . a simple way to solve these problems is the group automorphism of @ xmath230 : if @ x##math231 is a point stabiliser of @ xmath230 , and @ xmath10 is mapped by an induced automorphism of @ xmath230 to a unique character corresponding to @ xmath232 . examination of the character table of @ xmath230 shows that the constituent @ xmath233 of @ xmath234 is mapped to the constituent @ xmath235 of @ xmath236 . since @ xmath237 is conjugate from @ xmath238 to @ xmath64 , the character induced from @ xmath64 can also be obtained without restriction . the remaining character from saxl # ##n ( n ) is @ xmath239 which is always multiplicity - 1 . we have a way to solve this problem . it easily shows that @ xmath240 , denoted by , @ xmath3 appears in @ xmath241 if and only if @ xmath242 exists . in the [ 1 : tworow ] , each of @ xmath243 , @ xmath244 , or their combination , appears in @ xmat##h5 . from the identity @ xmath245 and frobenius , one knows that @ xmath246 where @ xmath247 if @ xmath248 , and @ xmath249 otherwise . ( since @ xmath69 is @ xmath150 - homogeneous , it does not matter which type @ xmath250 we choose . ) hence @ xmath251 . the subgroup @ xmath227 has a finite conjugacy class of cycles of even order ; these are cyclic , and since @ xmath227 is also @ xmath32 - homogeneous , they all agree with the type @ xmath252 . hence @ xmath253 . it follows from the identity @ xmath254 for @ xmath255 , that the only other odd cycle that appears when we extend @ xmath227 to @ xmath69 is @ xmath60 . therefore , @ xmath150 - homogeneous agrees with the cycle type of the subgroup of @ xmath69 , and @ xmath256 . therefore , starting from @ xmath25##7 and @ xmath258 , the first hook character to appear in @ xmath5 is @ xmath259 . we also have @ xmath260 where @ xmath165 has degree @ xmath261 . with the exception of @ xmath262 ( which has degree @ xmath263 ) and the characters @ xmath264 , @ xmath265 ( both of degree @ xmath266 ) , all the hook characters of @ xmath267 that are still eligible to appear in @ xmath165 have too small a degree . if @ xmath262 occurs three times , then we would have @ xmath268 ; the resulting character number can be computed by hand , or found in ( * ? ? ? * appendix 1 . 2 ) . however , @ xmath69 has no character of degree @ xmath59 , so not @ xmath269 . appendix 2 . it is straightforward to check using the methods @ xmath270 and pieri ' s that , in @ xmath271 , the characters @ xmath272 and @ xmath##273 is also norm - free . this gives the result in our case ( ii ) . it remains to deal with saxl s case ( iii ) : subgroups of of index at index @ xmath150 . by the work of inglis , wilson and saxl , @ xmath274 is norm - free . however , this group is still norm - free if we apply addition to @ xmath216 , since @ xmath275 where the sum is over all partitions @ xmath4 of @ xmath276 with exactly one odd element . we therefore take @ xmath70 from saxl s case ( iv ) . this gives our case ( c ) . it now only remains to look at the proper subgroup of @ xmath70 . let @ xmath10 be the only proper subgroup of @ xmath70 of index @ xmath30 and the normal subgroup @ xmath277 . a simple calculation shows that , provided @ xmath278 , the subgroup @ xmath279 is the proper subgroup of @ xmath70 of index @ xmath150 . this subgroup is normal in @ xmath70 ,and the quotient group @ xmath280 is equivalent to @ xmath281 . it follows that there are three subgroups of the @ xmath30 , @ xmath70 , in @ xmath282 , @ xmath283 , and one subgroup , which we shall denote by @ xmath284 . the subgroup ##s is shown in figure 1 below .

[ see : selfdual ] let @ xmath83 be a ring of prime powers @ xmath93 . if @ xmath37 is a subset of @ xmath1 such that the single element @ xmath381 is multiplicity - one , all the summands of @ xmath91 are self - dual . _ for simplicity , we assume that @ xmath83 is the field with @ xmath93 elements . let @ xmath86 be an indecomposable direct summand of @ xmath91 . let @ xmath382 be the ring of @ xmath93 - adic integers . since @ xmath86 is a direct summand of a - module , we may reduce @ xmath86 to an @ xmath383 - module @ xmath38##4 shows that @ xmath384 is a direct summand of @ xmath385 and @ xmath386 . ( see @ xcite for an outline of this lifting problem . ) suppose that @ xmath86 is not self - dual . then the identity character @ xmath384 is not self - dual either . since @ xmath387 is self - dual , we can construct a summand @ xmath388 of @ xmath387 such that @ xmath389 . since @ xmath384 and @ xmath388 are self - dual , they are direct summands of @ xmath387 . thus @ xmath384 and @ xmath390 are the same ordinary character . this supports our assumption that the character @ xmath381 has length - 1 . @ xmath353 this section deals with the problem of multiplication by r [ x : x ] . it can also be used to explain the reference to the article of ##z . phil thesis ( * ? ? ? * . 6 . 5 . 1 ) in the section of # 4 of @ xcite. . , we shall often be in the position of showing that a permutation module @ xmath91 has a specht filtration , and then to prove that the same result holds for each of its summands . since by theorem [ th : main ] we assume that our ground field @ xmath83 is algebraically closed and of course @ xmath391 , we can use the linear algebraic representation given by hemmer and nakano in @ xcite . ( for an alternative , slightly less rigorous approach , see the result attributed to s . suzuki at the beginning of proof of @ xcite . ) we are now ready to prove theorem [ th : main ] . from the work of hemmer and nakano @ xcite , when @ xmath88 , the factors of the modules in the specht filtration are well - defined . now it follows to show that each of the free modules in @ [ th : mod ] has a specht filtration , with the specht factors given by the ordinary factors . we start with the result coming from case ( 1 ) of theorem [ thm : main ] . suppose that @ xmat##h392 . since the residue of @ xmath83 has odd characteristic , @ xmath393 it follows from proposition [ prop : sgnfilt ] and proposition [ prop : jamesyoung ] that each of the four summands has a specht representation . # [ prop : summands ] now suppose that _ the _ indecomposable summand of @ xmath394 has a specht representation . this agrees with all the subgroups of in case ( a ) , and all the representations of @ xmath196 in case ( b2 ) . now suppose that @ xmath45 . we now assume that @ xmath395 where @ xmath206 is the @ xmath26 - th representation of @ xmath49 appearing in 4 . 2 . then both of the summands have a specht representation . ( since it is known that @ xmath83 has odd characteristic : see 4 . 2 for an example when @ xmath83 has residue @ xmath30 . ) it follows that @ xmath396 and @ xmath397 both have spechtfiltrations . thus , if @ xmath37 is a subgroup of @ xmath49 of index @ xmath150 then @ xmath398 is in every case a proper summand of @ xmath399 , and thus has a specht decomposition . and if @ xmath37 is any subgroup of @ xmath215 such that @ xmath46 , then @ xmath400 has a specht decomposition . by theorem [ th : jamesyoung ] , @ xmath401 also has a specht decomposition . these results deal with all the remaining subgroups in case ( b ) . in cases ( c ) and ( d ) , a considerable amount of work was done for proof of theorem 2 of @ xcite , which shows that @ xmath402 has a specht decomposition . by theorem [ thm : jamesyoung ] , @ xmath403 also has a specht decomposition . the proof giving theorem 2 . 4 shows that @ xmath404 we can also use proposition [ prop : sgnfilt ] and proposition [ prop : summands ] to provethat the summands of the right - hand side are specht modules . it only follows to agree with the result arising from equation ( 2 ) . by our above results , together with the very following results [ see : jamesyoung ] , it follows to show that for @ xmath63 , @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 , @ xmath405 is a specht module . this is true if @ xmath406 , and then the @ xmath378 - module is a direct sum of specht modules . the other cases turn out to be rather easy . if @ xmath407 and @ xmath408 are @ xmath409 , the specht modules corresponding to the non - zero binary characters in @ xmath410 are simple and projective . for @ xmath411 when @ xmath407 and @ xmath412 we observe that since @ xmath69 does not contain any modules of order @ xmath59 , @ xmath413 is projective . it is also known ( via @ xcite ) that every projective module for the symmetric group isa specht filtration . the only example left is when @ xmath414 and @ xmath412 . it follows from that the only algebraic character appearing in @ xmath415 lies in a projective @ xmath416 - representation of @ xmath267 , and that the two non - projective representations are the trivial and sign ##ible . for @ xmath417 this completes the proof of the [ thm : theorem ] .

( see ( * ? ? ? * . 11 . 2 ) for the proof of the @ xmath420 . ) we shall prove , eitherwith the help of computer algebra , or more precisely by _ ad hoc _ arguments ( see below ) , that @ xmath371 contains a submodule corresponding to @ xmath419 . it follows from the table of decomposition numbers of @ xmath267 in the @ xmath32 ( see ( * ? ? ? * p145 ) ) that there are only two specht ##s which ( a ) have @ xmath419 as their composition factor , and ( b ) do not all have the composition factors that are found in @ xmath371 . they are @ xmath421 in a simple argument ( see ( * ? ? ? * corollary 12 . 2 ) ) , @ xmath419 always appears at the top of @ xmath422 . similarly , @ xmath419 appears at the socle of @ xmath423 if and only if @ xmath424 appears at the top of @ xmath425 ; this is also pointed out in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 12 . 2 ) . the same formula works for @ xmath426 . by , one can obtain the following exactsequence @ xmath427 given is the sequence @ xmath428 used by hamernik in ( * ? ? ? * p449 ) to show that @ xmath429 contains @ xmath419 in its top , but not in its bottom . ( hamernik deals only with simple modules of prime characteristic , but it is possible to generalise this part of his work to deal with hook - specht modules for @ xmath84 whenever the top of @ xmath83 is @ xmath2 : = @ xcite . ) thus none of the hook specht modules contains @ xmath419 as a submodule . the following holds . it remains to show that @ xmath419 appears in the socle of @ xmath371 . for this we shall need the following proof , which is of some special type .
