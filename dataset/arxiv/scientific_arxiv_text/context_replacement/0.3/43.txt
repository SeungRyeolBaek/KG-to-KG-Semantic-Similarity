matrices with random ( or pseudo - random ) entries appear naturally in many computer applications and are well known in scientific and mathematical literature ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . in this article we mention a special class of sparse random matrices , namely , matrices associated with tree ( or tree - like ) structures . a common property of random matrices is that the number of non - zero elements in each row and column either remains finite or grows more rapidly than the total dimension when the dimension increases . as usual , a ( random ) tree is a graph where every pair of vertices is connected by exactly one path without repeating itself . trees are labeled by integers . if a random ( or hermitian ) matrix @ xmath0 exists such that diagonal entries @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 , are non - zero if and only if both @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 are present on a given graph , then the matrix @ xmath0 is said to be associated with the tree . an example of such a matrix is the adjacency matrix of the graph . in general , diagonal entries of @ xmath0 are nonzero . let @ xmath5 be the indicator matrix for matrix @ xmath0, and @ xmath6 where @ xmath7 is the identity matrix . it is well known that for matrices associated with a tree there are many relations which replace the matrix elements @ xmath8 of the green function with larger quantities but for smaller trees . perhaps the simplest way to derive such relations for a tree is to use an easily verified identity ( sometimes called the schur complement formula ) , which states that for the matrix @ xmath0 one has @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 is the green function as above and for the matrix @ xmath11 obtained from @ xmath0 by taking row @ xmath12 and column @ xmath12 . for any graph , removing one vertex splits the whole graph into a linear union of its vertices . however , @ xmath11 is block - free and the green function @ xmath10 has a matrix sum between the neighbors of any given site @ xmath12 . this means that for trees eq . takes the matrix @ xmath13 where the sum is taken over all neighbors of site @ xmath12 and we have that matrix @ xmath0 is hermitian . using the same arguments to@ xmath10 leads to a different result for each neighbor @ xmath14 of @ xmath12 , except @ xmath15 where the sum is over all neighbors of @ xmath14 except @ xmath12 ( which have already been removed ) . in fact , @ xmath16 in the right - hand side of this equation is the green function element for a tree obtained from @ xmath0 by removing the connected sites @ xmath12 and @ xmath14 . and because we are in a tree , @ xmath16 is the same whether only @ xmath14 or all its neighbors were removed ; thus it is possible to remove only the one removed site . it is this property which allows to write the recursive relation where on both sides similar values are assumed . for finite trees the above conditions allow to write the green function recursively , but their the most important application is to infinite ( or very large ) trees where matrix elements of @ xmath17 are assumed to be independent random variables ( or both ) . in this case , because of the disjoint nature of the sub - cases , viz . for which @ xmath14 only involves the @xmath18 from the k - tree to which @ xmath14 belongs . thus for large uniform trees , we can assume that all @ xmath19 are independent random variables with the same distribution . let @ xmath20 be the coordination number of elements @ xmath14 , and @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 , are random variables distributed according to that distribution . for simplicity we assume below that the diagonal ##ized element @ xmath23 is independent random variable @ xmath24 , off - diagonal elements @ xmath18 are independent i . i . d . elements @ xmath25 , and the coordination numbers are equal to @ xmath20 . the notation . means that the random variable @ xmath26 has the same distribution as the @ xmath21 . this model is the main tool for the investigation of large uniform trees . it has been developed initially by abou - chacra , thouless , and anderson in their theory of self - similarity theory of graphs @ xcite and later it has been re - derived by many different methods : anderson model @ xcite , @ xmath27 - 1 @ xcite , ricatti model @ xcite , rank- milky way @ xcite , cavity method @ xcite etc . we shall refer below to as the tree equation . strictly speaking , the tree equation is valid only for infinite uniform graphs ( the tree lattice ) but in some cases it is applicable to models which have a tree - like structure , i . e . which can not be represented by trees but may have loops of finite length . a good example is that of finite regular graphs , where each vertex has the same number of neighbors , as in a tree with constant coordination number , but where the loop shell observed in finite trees is finite ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . for certain tree - like models the validity of the tree equation cannot be proven rigorously @ xcite . there are three main types of tree - like problems , corresponding to three possible sources of randomness in the tree lattice . the first corresponds to a finite tree with a constant coordination number and with finite diagonal neighbors ( i . e . @ xmath24 is a random variable and @ xmath28 ) . this model has been proposed in a seminal paper @ xcite and was recently investigated by @ xcite and @ xcite . the second follows ( see e . g . @ xcite ) .to models which are also defined for a random regular tree and have only off - diagonal disorder ( i . e . all @ xmath25 are i . i . d . random , and @ xmath29 ) . finally , the second type of models includes models without disorder but with a similar problem . some examples of such models are erds - rnyi graphs @ xcite or all random matrices with a finite degree @ xcite . in this case , as an example , we will restrict ourselves to random regular graphs . a general method for efficiently solving the tree equation has been proposed in @ xcite and it is commonly used today under the name of the general method @ xcite . the main steps of this method are as follows . first , fix randomly an initial sample of a random number , called @ xmath30 , of variables @ xmath31 , @ xmath32 . second , choose the @ xmath33 integers from @ xmath34 to @ xmath30 and variables @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 from their probability distributions . third , calculate @ xmath35 from the tree equation . fourth , choose randomly an element from the initial sample and replace it .the calculated @ xmath35 . repeat these steps until the change of the energy distribution to the distribution of @ xmath35 . there are two types of solutions of . the first type corresponds to imaginary values of the energy @ xmath36 : at each step of the algorithm , the variables @ xmath31 are calculated and upon iteration one gets the distribution of the real variable @ xmath35 . the second type of solution corresponds to adding a single positive imaginary part to the energy , that is , adding @ xmath37 in . in this case , upon iteration the @ xmath31 are complex numbers and the result of the iteration will be the distribution of both the real and the imaginary part of @ xmath35 , which is and will depend on @ xmath38 . if the energy @ xmath36 corresponds to a region of localized states , then when @ xmath39 the real part of @ xmath35 will tend to zero almost immediately , while if the energy corresponds to a region of non - localized states the real part of @ xmath35 tends to a finite distribution . if we restrict ourselves to imaginary values of the energy , with @ xmath40 . the purpose of this algorithmis to include the calculation of the mean spectral density of all tree - based graphs and all of the solutions of the tree equation . generally speaking , the method is valid for trees with a large coordination number and often gives good results even for small coordination numbers . the method itself is relatively new and has been used extensively for solving erds - rnyi graphs ( see e . g . @ xcite @ xcite and references below ) . we first clarify some important points which seem not to be discussed in the literature and then investigate in detail the application of the method to the regular graphs and compare different types of results . the plan of the paper is the following . after setting the definitions in section [ rhodee ] , section [ mean _ field ] is devoted to the general discussion of the method . it is demonstrated that the commonly used mean - field solution of the tree equation corresponds to the approximation of the exact solution of a random cauchy distribution whose parameters are calculated self - consistently . different approximation ##s for the mean spectral density are also discussed in this section . in section [ g ] the case of regular graphs with diagonal edges is discussed . by comparing results of the above section with various kinds of approximations we measure their precision and conclude that at zeroth order the meansolution for regular trees with diagonal disorder is obtained by the so - called single root approximation proposed in @ xcite . section [ off _ diagonal ] treats the case of regular trees with off - diagonal disorder . for these cases the best solutions are obtained by using the modified effective field approximation proposed in section [ mean _ field ] . in the considered cases , the next order approximation for the tree equation solution , although it is much better with the exact solution obtained by wave ##lets , improves noticeably the spectral density obtained at the real values . the point of this note ( stated in section [ conclusion ] ) is that the exact solution of the tree equation is simple , flexible , and general method of calculation of the mean spectral density for the regular tree - based models . the mean spectral density is defined as given by @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 are entries of @ xmath0 and the average is zero for random values of the matrix entries . as mentioned in the section , here we only have approximate solutions of eq . . let us denote by @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 the ( independent ) probability distributions of @ xmath24 and @ xmath45 . the probability density of variable @ xmath##46 is given by some function @ xmath47 , and that of real @ xmath48 by a function @ xmath49 . by definition , @ xmath50 = @ xmath51 the following equation shows that for real @ xmath52 the probability density @ xmath47 is the equation @ xmath53 or equivalently @ xmath54 neighbors of @ xmath0 correspond to those of @ xmath36 where @ xmath55 is real . assuming that @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 respectively can be replaced by random variables , which we denote by @ xmath24 and @ xmath58 respectively , we assume that these values occur in @ xmath59 . under these conditions , the definition gives @ xmath60 where the distribution is taken over all @ xmath20 neighbors of the test site . an equivalent expression for the log probability density is obtained by transforming q . into the form @ xmath61 for the calculation of @ xmath62 , q . and @ xmath63 of interest , the above formulas can be rewritten in two equivalent ways . therefore the knowledgeof the spectral density can directly be deduced from that of the a @ xmath47 which is a solution of the tree equation , or from that of @ xmath49 . in the next section we consider the solutions of these equations . the tree equation can have a more complicated solution , that is , a @ xmath64 ( based on @ xmath36 ) such that @ xmath65 if such a @ xmath66 exists , the mean spectral density associated with this solution is obtained from a @ xmath67 using # ##s , this expression can be equivalently rewritten as @ xmath68 when the imaginary part of @ xmath69 is zero . equation also known as the random matrix estimate ( sda ) @ xcite . to further simplify this expression one can simply argue that for large @ xmath33 ( which , as we see below , is the parameter which determines this type of estimate ) the sum over @ xmath20 terms in eq . can be approximated by the sum over @ xmath33 terms , so that from this follows that the mean spectral density takes the form @ xmath70 this type of approximation is often applied for large random matrices, where eq . is called the effective medium approximation ( ema ) @ xcite . physically , this equation is a function of a mean field and often these equations are solved by assuming that the random variable @ xmath52 defined according to @ xmath47 varies slowly around its mean value @ xmath64 ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . such an approach is simple , physically sound , does not require complex numerical calculations , and gives , as a rule , very good results . the trouble is that the simple assumption that variable @ xmath52 fluctuates only slowly around its mean value @ xmath64 may not be , in general , correct for tree - like models . indeed , it follows from eq . that if the mean @ xmath71 is constant , then @ xmath47 has to decrease as @ xmath72 in particular , this implies that @ xmath47 belongs to the class of long - tailed distributions , for which the mean field @ xmath73 does not exist . thus , the existence of a ( smooth ) mean field solution and , therefore , the relation to the simple numerical solution of the above equation for real @ xmath##52 remains obscure . the above mean field approach is equivalent to the fact that the distribution @ xmath47 can be approximated by the corresponding cauchy distribution @ xmath74 with @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 real numbers , @ xmath77 , and @ xmath78 . similarly , for the test function @ xmath79 without singularities in the upper - half plane one has the formula @ xmath80 in other words , the cauchy distribution is indistinguishable from the @ xmath81 - distribution when evaluated on a given set of points . in particular , when @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 are known and @ xmath84 , contour integration yields the following : @ xmath85 the more elementary properties of cauchy distributions that we can make use of are the functional relation @ xmath86 and the convolution property @ xmath87 the characteristic function of is given by @ xmath88 let us compute the characteristic function of @ xmath47 , @ xmath89 using one obtains the following functional relation @ xmath90if in the left - hand side of this , @ xmath47 is replaced by the cauchy distribution @ xmath91 in by and . , the consecutive use of gives a second - order approximation of the characteristic functions of @ xmath92 , @ xmath93 in and @ xmath94 . requiring that parameters @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 exist such that at small argument @ xmath95 is exactly equivalent to requiring that @ xmath96 satisfy the mean field approach . these parameters can be used as arguments . let @ xmath64 be a ( positive ) mean value of and @ xmath97 the corresponding cauchy distribution . then an approximate approximation to such that @ xmath98 for small argument @ xmath99 is obtained by replacing @ xmath92 by @ xmath100 in the right - hand side of this . . it follows that @ xmath64 is not a mean value of a random variable as in the standard mean field approach but rather a function of the cauchy distribution which reproduces the behavior of the characteristic function @ xmath101 for small@ xmath102 . ( it is important to notice that for the usual goe ensemble of random variables the corresponding green function also has a cauchy distribution , see e . g . @ xcite . ) the use of @ xmath64 allows to solve for the mean spectral density from eqs . 2 . in the case considered in the next sections we found that it does not give good results for large values of @ xmath33 . therefore , we have to use a simple approximation , by transforming the cauchy approximation into . . . the formulas based on and . lead to the following approximate formula for the mean spectral density @ xmath103 this expression is almost as simple as ema and often gives better results . we refer to it as to the maximum - variance approximation ( mema ) . a few examples are worth to mention . when @ xmath97 is transformed into and . one gets , by integration of @ xmath104 , a second approximate approximation of @ xmath49 , as @ xmath105 the first iteration of the initial cauchy distribution , @ xmath106 , is then straightforwardly calculated either from this expression and .. , or , from eq . : if we define @ xmath107 , eq . can be rewritten @ xmath108 where f is taken from @ xmath24 and the @ xmath109 . this is exactly the exponential function of the cauchy distribution with parameters @ xmath110 ( see ref . ) . thus one now gets @ xmath111 the following iterations can be done in the same manner . below we refer to the cauchy distribution @ xmath91 with parameters from eq . as the second order approximation of @ xmath47 and to the first iteration as the first order approximation . for each iteration of approximation one can calculate the expected probability density by using either eq . : . . . these formulas are equivalent when @ xmath47 is the tree equation , but for different expressions they differ and will give different results . however , in general , one can agree on the following . when these two expressions are equivalent to each other , for a given problem , one of these expressions is better and we shall indicate that . let us now consider in detail the example of a regular tree ( which will be approximated by a regular treeto avoid boundary effects ) where each node has @ xmath20 neighbors . the matrix we consider is the adjacency matrix of the graph , to which we add a second matrix given by i . i . d . random variables with e . g . the probability distribution @ xmath112 equation is this model which has been introduced by @ xcite and later has been investigated in many ways ( see e . g . @ xcite and see below ) . such a model corresponds to the one discussed in article [ mean _ field ] with example @ xmath113 . then the mean field equation reads @ xmath114 equation implies that @ xmath115 is the the probability distribution of the sum of @ xmath33 i . i . d . variables , according to the law @ xmath47 . from this follows that @ xmath47 is determined by the @ xmath33 - 1 convolution of @ xmath47 ( cf . ) . when @ xmath33 is large , the generalized central limit theorem ( see e . g . @ xcite ) can be proved . it states that a properly distributed sum of i . i . d . random variables tends tothe limit of known stable distributions . if the second moment is zero , the limiting distribution is the same . for long - tailed distributions , when the second moment does not exist , the limiting distribution is one of the stable distributions . the asymptotics show that @ xmath47 belongs to the sphere of influence of the symmetric cauchy distribution , so for large @ xmath33 the probability density of @ xmath33 - that of @ xmath52 in the limit is equal to @ xmath116 given by the two parameters @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 , with @ xmath119 . important is that these parameters are determined directly from the value of the wave function of @ xmath47 at small @ xmath102 , @ xmath120 results in . the mean probability density is then given by which , using the approximation , yields @ xmath121 which corresponds exactly to sda . note that the term @ xmath122 has the meaning of a wave function @ xcite where one uses the initial wave function the is localized at a site with large @ xmath123 . the simplest form of the above equation correspondsto the absence of , , i . e . @ xmath124 . in this case . thus , for @ xmath125 , a solution @ xmath119 with @ xmath126 . for @ xmath127 , @ xmath128 . from eq . , the maximum spectral density in this case is given of order 0 for @ xmath129 which agrees with kesten - mckay formula for random diagonal elements @ xcite . for a general distribution @ xmath43 of random elements , such as , , @ xmath76 and @ xmath75 are easily calculated . from . . . . , they have a shape ( as the solution of @ xmath36 ) equal to . a simple way to find @ xmath64 is the first step of eq . , from a # ##ized guess @ xmath130 , i . e . @ xmath131 where @ xmath132 is the solution of . . . to ensure that it is convenient to use a slightly different approximation scheme , @ xmath133 with the solution @ xmath134 . the solution @ xmat##h76 and @ xmath75 , used as units of energy , the spectral lines can be calculated either from etc . or from eq . we find that etc . gives better results at than @ xmath33 . the sda is plotted for a given values of @ xmath33 and @ xmath135 in fig . [ fig _ diag _ 0 . 0 ] and [ fig _ graph ] for the energy density , . the agreement between the above two equations and the results of the partial diagonalization of the corresponding lines is very good in the case of the spectra except for the smallest value of the reynolds number . they are clearly present only near the spectral lines , where in all cases the diagonal approach can not be applied . and @ xmath136 ( green circles ) , @ xmath137 ( red circles ) , and @ xmath138 ( red circles ) , obtained from computations performed on @ xmath139 - fig - graph , with @ xmath140 representing values of density and temperature . the values of corresponding lines indicate higher order sda formulas . the line corresponds to the next value of the density . for @ xmath14##1 these two curves are not the same and only sda data is shown . ] but for @ xmath142 ( left panel ) and @ xmath143 ( right panel ) . solid lines of corresponding color indicate first order sda formulas . the next order values at the scale of the figures are hardly distinguishable from the sda and are not presented . ] but for @ xmath142 ( left panel ) and @ xmath143 ( right panel ) . solid lines of corresponding color indicate first order sda formulas . the next order values at the scale of the figures are hardly distinguished from the sda and are not presented . ] to determine more precisely the accuracy of these two values , we calculate for the distribution @ xmath47 , from the tree , using the wave propagation techniques described in section [ introduction ] . the values for the two curves are presented in fig . [ w _ 11 . 5 ] and [ w _ 12 ] . for each @ xmath144 and each of @ xmath36 , we calculate the zeroth order and the first order approximations to @ xmath47 . for the distribution of @ xmath144 ( fig .[ x _ 0 . 0 ] ) the two approximations are practically the same but for larger @ xmath144 they are quite different . in all considered cases the first order approximation @ xmath106 calculated by eq . is in very good numerical agreement with the numerical solution of the tree equation . the second order approximation for the mean spectral density can be calculated e . g . from fig . which , for our example , reads @ xmath145 where @ xmath106 is calculated from . calculated directly from the tree equation for regular random graphs with @ xmath146 and @ xmath141 at different energies , from left to right @ xmath147 , @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 . green lines show results of direct numerical solution of the tree equation by wave propagation methods , using a set of @ xmath150 energy values and performing @ xmath151 calculations . red dashed lines show the second order ( cauchy ) approximation . the next approximation is almost exact from the previous one and is not shown on the right . , [ = " ref : " ] + but with @ x##math152 . from left to right : @ xmath147 , @ xmath153 , and @ xmath154 . red circles indicate results of direct numerical solution of the tree obtained by belief testing . the white lines represent the first - order ( cauchy ) distribution . black circle figures are the first order formula . , [ = " : : " ] + from to . [ see _ diag _ 0 . } ] it is clear that this approximation works better with direct numerical solution for smaller @ xmath33 . for larger @ xmath33 the second order and the first order formula are practically indistinguishable on the scale of the figures . this robustness can be seen as follows . as has been noted in section [ mean _ value ] , the approximation of the cauchy distribution as the first order formula is to a large extent arbitrary ( what matters is not the asymptotics ) . on the other hand , according to the first upper limit of the @ xmath33 - 1 approximation , @ xmath71 , of the lower - order , is in the bulk universal and is not sensitive to details of the distribution function . therefore, and which can be written as @ xmath71 and @ xmath155 . very high order are more easily described by low - order functions than those related directly with the correlation function . in this section we consider a new type of matrix - based models , the matrices associated with regular graphs with a real number @ xmath20 , with diagonal elements set to zero and off - diagonal element elements treated as a . i . d . random variables . the densities @ xmath47 and @ xmath156 are given by eqs . and with @ xmath124 ( since all elements are zero ) and the random variable @ xmath44 which determines the probability density of off - diagonal elements . we define for @ xmath44 the gaussian distribution with variance @ xmath27 and zero variance @ xmath157 this definition is not essential but simplifies analytical ##ly . note that here the variance corresponds to a change of the energy ; so for what follows we use @ xmath158 . it is convenient to define the integral @ xmath159 which for integer @ xmath33 corresponds to well - known standard functions . many functions defined in section[ mean _ field ] can be expressed as this equation . the equations are , and they are as follows . the mean - field expansion becomes @ xmath160 the first order of the @ xmath33 - fold expansion , viz . , [ @ xmath161 \ . \ ] ] the exact solutions and proposed in section [ mean _ field ] for the probability density are now given by @ xmath162 \ label { rho _ mema } \ ] ] and @ xmath163 \ . \ label { sda } \ ] ] the second order approximation of the integral @ xmath47 , derived from the first iteration of the cauchy integral , is now derived from eq . 2 @ xmath164 \ . \ label { g _ 1 _ 2 } \ ] ] when @ xmath165 reads @ xmath166 , the second approximation to , comes from , where @ xmath167 , and one can write @ xmath168 as @ xmath169 the solution of is . in this regime of @ xmath170 one can now see , by integration , that in this case @ xmat##h171 and @ xmath172 given by and tend to the kesten - mckay distribution for the density ##ity @ xmath173 where for , we use the variance @ xmath27 of off - diagonal disorder . the density @ xmath174 is the half - circle density @ xmath175 as should follow from the expression @ xcite . for small values of @ xmath33 the result is similar . it is known ( see e . g . @ xcite ) that for graphs with off - diagonal disorder , where the variance of small values of @ xmath45 is non - zero , the bulk density of states has a density at low energies of the form @ xmath176 where @ xmath177 is a certain positive constant . this phenomenon is related with a loss of the localization of small sub - graphs which are isolated from the bulk due to small values of the off - diagonal elements . numerical expressions for different @ xmath33 and off - diagonal disorder given by are presented in fig . [ off _ diagonal ] . in the same fig mema expressions are plotted . we checked that sda expressions give worse results at different @ xmath33 .the overall quality of the formulas and numerics is not good but the shape of the lines is clearly visible especially for small @ xmath33 . , white squares to @ xmath178 , and black squares to @ xmath143 . solid lines of the same color indicate the second order mema approximations . dashed black lines indicates the second order approximation for @ xmath146 . for small values of @ xmath33 the difference between the second and the first order approximations is small and only the first order approximation is shown in the figure . ] . in the next section we can calculate the as @ xmath47 by direct belief testing method . the results are indicated in ref . [ energy _ functions ] for a few values of energy . the same figure also shows the zeroth - order ( cauchy ) approximation and the second order of energy given by . in the cases considered , the second order approximation is in a good agreement with numerical values . this better approximation of the first - order approximation for @ xmath47 allows us to calculate the next approximation to the mean probability density . we obtain it from the @ xmath179 with @ xmath106 given by . the probabilitydensity @ xmath180 of @ xmath33 i . i . e . density @ xmath181 with , @ xmath44 , @ xmath182 one can have im @ xmath183 with @ xmath184 ( note that since @ xmath185 and im @ xmath186 one has im @ xmath187 ) . using the elementary formula for the cauchy group , one also has @ xmath188 for the complex numbers with @ xmath158 , @ xmath189 for @ xmath190 , and ##es . the above results , are given by the transformation @ xmath191p _ k ( t ) p _ k ( t _ 1 ) p _ k ( t _ 2 ) \ mathrm { d } t \ , \ mathrm { d } t _ 1 \ , \ mathrm { d } t _ 2 \ ] ] , with the integral ##s @ xmath192 and @ xmath193 \ . this transformation ( by transformation @ xmath194 ) to @ xmath195 this result is shown in ref . [ p _fig ] for @ xmath146 . this also agrees also with the direct numerical calculation of the total spectral density . for large values of @ xmath33 the zeroth and the first order formulas are equivalent to each other . it confirms the statement made in the previous section that even the first order approximation much better agrees with probability of @ xmath47 . by the belief propagation , the difference between the two approximations in the mean density is true even for the larger values of the number . for regular graphs with @ xmath146 and off -

diagonal disorders . we consider here the special case of disorder of the following : @ xmath198 where @ xmath199 are i . i . d . random variables with probability , @ xmath43 and @ xmath200 are i . i . d . random symmetric variables with finite mean and finite variance @ xmath201 pastur shows using @ xcite that in the limit @ xmath202 and under certain initial conditions the mean value of @ xmath203 obeys the limit @ xmath204 and theas discussed here this case corresponds to a regular graph with coordination number @ xmath205 . for such the expression @ xmath202 @ xmath206 ##3 tends to @ xmath69 ( cf . and since from the definition @ xmath207 it is easy to check that ) . together with the mean - density of , which is a confirmation of the tree - equation of . we obtain the mean spectral density for these regular graphs by finding an exact real solution of the tree equation associated with these graphs . this equation is real and is valid for all random graph - like models . the mean spectral density for these models is determined by the @ xmath208 - 1 convolution of real tree equation and , where @ xmath20 is the coordination number of the tree . for large @ xmath33 the generalized central limit theorem states that in the limit such convolution depends only on a few parameters which can be computed directly from the boundary conditions . from the structure of the tree , it follows that the required solution belongs to the domain of convergence of the generalized cauchy function . therefore , it is possible to use , as the zeroth order solution of the tree equationand , the cauchy distribution itself , whose parameters are calculated self - independently . estimates of that same cauchy distribution are next order estimates . when a good approximation for tree equation solution is found , the mean spectral density can be calculated using any of the above methods relating it to the tree equation solution ( see section [ introduction ] ) . we applied this method for the calculation of mean spectral density for regular graphs with random or off - diagonal disorder , and compared the second and first order approximation with results of direct numerical calculations . as expected , for large coordination number the zeroth order approximation for the density gives very good results , which is rather good even for the value @ xmath33 . for regular graphs with diagonal disorder the sda gives a slightly better result but for graphs with off - diagonal disorder the mema is closer to the numerics than the zeroth order approximations . as for the tree equation solution itself , the first order approximation is usually much closer to the corresponding results obtained by the belief propagation than the zeroth order cauchy distribution . however , the corresponding results for the mean spectral density are usually obtained only for large coordination number . the statement that the mean spectral density of regular graphs is closer to the solutionof an equation which , strictly speaking , is valid only for corresponding roots is physically not impossible and could be proved valid in some cases without roots and with higher order . a discussion of this and related problems in the context of the search for roots ( see e . g . @ xcite ) is of interest . s . k . mehta , _ random matrix theory _ , ( springer , new york , 1990 ) . j . akemann , m . baik , and m . di francesco , _ the oxford handbook of random matrix theory _ ( oxford university press , 2011 ) . m . abou -
