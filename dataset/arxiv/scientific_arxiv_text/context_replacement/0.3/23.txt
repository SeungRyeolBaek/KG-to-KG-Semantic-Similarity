in 1957 a . a . askaryan pointed out that turbulence and cavitation of the path of an ionising photon through a liquid leads to hydrodynamic radiation @ xcite . in the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s , theoretical and experimental studies have been performed on the acoustic radiation of beams and particles traversing dense media @ xcite . the difficulty in characterising the properties of the acoustic radiation has , among other things , led to the idea that the effect can be used to detect ultra - high energy ( @ xmath1 ) cosmic , i . e . astrophysical particles , in dense media like water , ice and salt . in the 1970s this idea was discussed within the dumand optical neutrino detector project @ xcite and has been studied in connection with cherenkov - based projects since . the detection of cosmic particles is much more challenging than the search for high - energy particles ( @ xmath2 ) which is performed by under - ice and under - water cherenkov neutrino telescopes @ xcite . due to the low expected resolution , detector sizes above 100km @ xmath3 are impossible @ xcite . however , the propertiesof the acoustic method , for sparsely spaced arrays with @ xmath4100 sensors / km @ xmath3 . to determine the feasibility of a sensor system based on acoustic methods it is necessary to understand the mechanism of the radio waves by making measurements and simulations based on theoretical models . according to the so - called thermo - mechanical model @ xcite , the particle deposition of particles in water leads to a local heating of the medium which can be regarded as exponential with respect to the hydrodynamic time scale . due to the temperature change the medium expands or contracts according to the local thermal expansion coefficient @ xmath5 . the local motion of the water medium produces an electromagnetic pulse whose temporal signature is zero and which remains in the water . coherent transmission of the two radio waves , passing over the cylindrical axis of the particle deposition , leads to a reflection of a flat disk - like volume in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the particle deposition . in this case , the coherent signal generation of two types of beams , associated with a single target , was investigated : pulsed light and a pulsed laser , and the formation of a hadronic cascade from a neutrino interaction under experimental conditions . with theto the further experimental support of the thermo - acoustic model , the work presented here can make use of previously unavailable advanced tools such as geant4 @ xcite for the simulation of laser - induced hadronic showers in water . some agreement was found in the comparison of the residual signal properties with the experimental results , providing opportunities to apply the computational methods in the context of acoustic detection of ultra - high energy waves . another puzzling phenomenon observed in previous experiments was non - residual signal properties at a temperature of 4 @ xmath6c , where for water at the highest temperature no thermo - acoustic signal should be present was studied in detail . such a residual signal was also observed for the water shower as described in this article , but not for the laser shower , suggesting that the amplitude of this signal is related to the charge or the mass of the protons . in the model , the thermo - acoustic model @ xcite is derived from basic assumptions , using a simple approach . solutions of the momentum tensor , i . e . , the differential equation @ xmath7 for energy density @ xmath8 , force - density of the medium @ xmath9 and energy - density tensor @ xmat##h10 including the equation @ xmath11 @ xcite . the ( [ e _ euler ] ) can be derived from momentum transfer . in the derivation , energy dissipation resulting from processes such as friction friction and momentum transfer is neglected . motions described by the euler equation above are adiabatic . taking the three partial derivatives of eq . ( [ eq _ 1 ] ) with respect to @ xmath12 and using for the solution the following equation @ xmath13 the non - linear wave equation can be derived : @ xmath14 to solve this equation , the system is split in two distinct energy regions : firstly , a region @ xmath15 ( _ ` beam ' _ ) , where the energy is lost in the beam interactions with the fluid and with the fluid excited in a non - linear manner ; and secondly , a hydrodynamic ( _ ` wave ' _ ) region @ xmath16 , where the acoustic wave propagates through the system and where linear ##ity in local equilibrium can be considered . this splitting can be described by the mass density equation , rewriting it as @ xmath17 in local equilibrium the changes in mass density are described by @ xmat##h18 with the bulk thermal expansion coefficient @ xmath19 , the equilibrium deposition @ xmath20 , the specific heat of deposition @ xmath21 in the beam and the specific heat @ xmath22 . in the second case , where @ xmath23 , the momentum transfer equation can be expressed as @ xmath24 ( using fig . ( [ e _ densitytensor ] ) and ( [ eq _ energy _ velocity ] ) ) , where we have an energy - momentum with pressure . the non - equilibrium equations ##s @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 according to fig . ( [ e _ densitytensor ] ) can be neglected for pressure differences @ xmath27 from the momentum density @ xmath28 and the pressure differences @ xmath29 from the bulk deposition @ xmath30 @ xcite . in the case b , where non - equilibrium deposition occurs , we can make the _ ansatz _ @ xmath31 with the velocity @ xmath32 of the beam which breaks the symmetry of the energy - momentum equation and describes with the parameter @ xmath33 in an effective manner the momentum transfer onthe fluid . although a non - equilibirum we have and . ( [ e _ wave _ change ] ) with the energy - momentum @ xmath34 of the beam . then , with the same energy - momentum transfer applied to the beam @ xmath35 the wave equation ( [ eq _ wave _ change ] ) becomes @ xmath36 the general formula for the wave equation can be obtained from the wave function approach [ @ xmath37 \ nonumber \ dots { t } \ ] ] with the addition of the unit vector @ xmath38 and the unit vector @ xmath39 . for the last case , the integral and the total of @ xmath40 have been used instead . note that @ xmath41 for @ xmath42 , so that the integration is spread out along the path of the energy deposition . @ xmath15 . for an energy deposition without momentum transfer to the medium , the last term of the _ ansatz _ ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) can be neglected ( @ xmath43 ) . @ xmath44 for a thermo - thermal wave produced solely by heating of the medium . the signal amplitude@ xmath45 can be shown to be equal to the dimensionless deviation @ xmath46 when solving eq . ( [ eq _ pressure ] ) for the case of an infinite energy deposition . equation ( [ e _ pressure ] ) is equivalent to the one obtained from the equation given in @ xcite . the derivation given above , however , uses a different formula , with the same characteristic and the appropriate energy - momentum tensor , yielding a more precise expression : cf . ( [ eq : 1 - approx ] ) . thus if is an ideal medium , one arrives at the formula for the small deviation @ xmath45 given in cf . ( [ e _ pressure ] ) . note that the use of the last assumption @ xmath43 as a good approximation would require a detailed knowledge of the energy transfer from the deposition to the medium . taking this into account would result in an additional dipol of @ xmath47 in eq . ( [ eq _ pressure ] ) which may be the main contribution to wave propagation if @ xmath48 decreases to 0 . 0 @ xmath49c . however , for @ xmath43 the electric field generated from thethe interaction of a medium is governed by the spatial and temporal distribution of the energy deposition density @ xmath50 alone . the amplitude of the resulting shock wave is governed by the thermal properties @ xmath21 , @ xmath51 and @ xmath5 , the latter two depending mainly on the temperature of the medium . a controlled study of these properties in the various laboratory experiments and the study of the resulting temporal distribution therefore allows for a precise test of the thermo - acoustic model . simulations based on the thermo - acoustic model , as used to interpret the results of the experiments described in the previous paper , will be discussed in sec . [ energy _ simulation ] . note that the energy deposition density @ xmath50 and the temporal distribution for the proton and laser beam interactions discussed in this paper are quite different from those used for the interaction of ultra - high energy particles . however , if a simulation starting from basic principles allows for a faithful interpretation of the experimental results , it is reasonable to assume that these experimental methods are transferable to these interactions , as they are governed by the same underlying physical processes . the experiments presented in this paper were performed with a near infrared chandra : yag laser .( @ xmath52 ) located at the erlangen centre for astroparticle physics ( ecap ) of the university of erlangen , and the dedicated @ xmath53 proton beam of the ` ` gustaf werner cyclotron ' ' at the ` ` theodor svedberg laboratory ' ' in stockholm , sweden . the beam properties allowed for a simple experimental setup . in both cases , the beams were dumped into a dedicated @ xmath54 test tank , where the acoustic field was measured with several temperature - adjustable pressure sensors ( see fig . [ see _ test _ 1 ] ) . the sensors ( also called hydrophones ) could be placed in the tank with absolute uncertainties below 1 cm . the temperature of the water could be measured at @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 with a resolution of @ xmath57 . the temperature was lowered to the desired value by first cooling the water with air ; subsequently the remaining water volume was heated to the desired temperature in a slow , gradual manner . once the desired temperature had been reached , at least 10min remained for water until the water was heated up to @ xmath57 through heat transfer from the environment . this time period was sufficient for the measurements made bywater temperatures below the room temperature . the explored range of spill energies for the proton ##s was from @ xmath58 to @ xmath59 , the beam diameter was at @ xmath60 and the relaxation time @ xmath61 . for @ xmath62 protons , the energy distribution in the water along the beam axis ( @ xmath63 - 1 , beam exit into the tank at @ xmath64 ) was almost uniform up to @ xmath65 ending with the prominent bragg - peak at @ xmath66 ( see ref . [ fig _ 1 _ deposition _ results ] ) . to calculate the spill energy , the number of particles per bunch was calculated . the total energy of a bunch was calculated with several independent methods ( faraday cups and molecular counters ) , leading to an accuracy on the order of 10 % , with some higher values for higher spill energies . to obtain the peak intensity and profile for the particle interactions in the water tank , the distance of about 1 . 5 km that the particle was traveling from the end of the water pipe to , and its descent into the water tank was used in the geant4 simulation . for the same simulation , the pulse intensity waslocated between @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 and calibrated by a commercial laser ##meter . the beam has a width of approximately @ xmath69 s and the absorption length is fixed at @ xmath70 . for the infrared beams used , the laser energy density distribution along the z axis has an exponential decrease with an absorption length of @ xmath71 ( see fig . [ fig _ energy _ deposition _ z ] ) . for both beam types the lateral energy deposition pattern is different ( the aforementioned beam lengths are the @ xmath72 s of the beam ) . the two beams were to have different spatial and temporal dimensions of the energy deposition as well as two different types of energy deposition into the medium . for both beams , energy is extracted via laser , in addition the medium is excited in the case of the proton ##s . , [ = 294 ] for the signal recording , sensors based on the piezo - electric effect @ xcite were used . a whole series of these sensors had been performed prior to the experiments . they are linear in amplitude response , the frequency response is linear starting from a few khz up to the frequency resonance of @ xmath73 with ainstead of @ xmath74 ( @ xmath40 . 02v / pa ) . the rf sensor becomes more sensitive at @ xmath45 @ xmath75 and sensitivity drops significantly at higher frequencies ; at 90khz , the sensitivity has increased by 20db . the absolute accuracy in the determination of the sensitivity is at the level of 2db in the frequency range of interest . above 90khz the sensitivity is 5db . to calculate the sensitivity of the sensor to an external beam , a parametrised fit of an equivalent circuit ##ry ##croft described in @ xcite was used . the sensitivity based on temperature was measured and the relative decrease was found to be less than @ xmath76 ( or about 0 . 13db ) per @ xmath77 . for each set of the sensor parameters ( temperature , energy , spectral sensitivity , etc . ) the average of 1000 individual pulses were calculated with a digital computer at a pulse rate in excess of @ xmath78 . this rate is sufficient for the sensors with spectral sensitivity up to 100khz , where the sensitivity of the sensors is negligibly small . these individual pulses were used to reduce thermal and environmental noise in the sensor , thereby reducingwith very high temporal precision . the [ acoustic _ signals ] are typical signals measured in the proton and the laser beams , respectively , using the same sensor and detector setup . the spectral characteristics of the two signals differ : the acoustic signal for the proton beam shows a bipolar pattern , the one for the laser comes from only a narrow region . the acoustic signal has high frequency components up to several mhz due to the high energy carrier density at the point of beam entry and the almost instantaneous energy deposition due to the @ xmath79s pulse of the proton beam ; here the resonance of the pulse is excited causing a ringing of the acoustic signal . the uniform distribution of the energy density @ xmath50 deposited by the laser leads to the two acoustic signals : the first originates from the beam area at the same @ xmath63 - frequency as the sensor placement ( _ ` direct signal ' _ ) , the second from the beam entry , a point of interest where most of the energy is deposited ( _ ` beam entry signal ' _ ) . the signal of the acoustic beam is deteriorated with respect to the ideal bipolar signal . two main contributions to this distortion can be discerned : the recorded signal starts before the expected signal of the acoustic signal( 55 . 5 @ xmath79s for the reference signal , see fig . [ sound _ wave ] , given by the beam pulse . ) ; reflections of the reflected wave on the initial entry window of the reference wave resulting in the first sub - faction ##ation ; and . there are two points of the wave affecting the frequency response of the sensor , slightly changing the signal amplitude and causing ringing . the first point was studied and found to be consistent with the electric charge change in the water caused by the reflected beam . the starting time was always coincident with the beam pulse entry into the water , even for sensor distances of up to 1 km , and at the original origin of the distorting wave . the shape of this non - acoustic signal is consistent with the initial time - evolution of the beam , with its subsequent exponential decay . this deformation of the reference signal is therefore a significant uncertainty in the signal properties and treated as such in the analysis . for the most part , the shape was fitted and extracted from the signal . in order to minimize the effect of the signal deformation caused by the new shape on the performance of the reference signal , two characteristics were used : the peak - to - peak ratio and the signal length from maximum to264 of the first . for the second , these features were extracted for the direct signals only . = 10 cm and @ xmath63 = 10 cm and are shown in the same time frame . the polka - dot line in the upper right shows the charge distribution described in the text . [ direct _ signals ] , [ = 264 ] for an in - depth analysis of the thermo - acoustic model , comparisons of the signal properties with simulation data based on the data are essential . to this end , a simulation of the direct signals was performed . this was based on the thermo - acoustic model with a numerical solution of eq . ( [ direct _ pressure ] ) . the input parameters to the simulation were either measured at the surface , i . e . medium temperature and beam profiles , or simulated , i . e . the energy deposition of the protons ( using geant4 ) . the thermodynamic parameters of volume expansion coefficient , heat capacity and speed of sound were derived from the measured water content using standard parametrisations . the water content was measured . a series of experiments were performed , where the input parameters were varied individually over the conditions given by the experiment , including temperature . especially the spatial and temporal beam profileshave a substantial effect on amplitude , duration and shape of the signal . simulated signals and the respective sensor response compared to the measured signals of vs . [ fig _ signals ] are shown in fig . [ fig _ signals _ sim ] . to avoid noise errors from the sensors caused e . g . by noise from the sensor , the sensor response was convoluted onto the simulated signals , rather than deconvoluted from the measured signals . thus in the analysis voltage rather than pressure signals were used . . the corresponding dashed - line signals are the measured signals after comparison with the sensor response . for better comparability , the error values are normalised to 1 . [ fig _ signals _ sim ] , width = 264 ] the shapes of the individual pulses are altered by the sensor response , especially the high - frequency components above the resonance frequency of the sensor . in the case of the laser experiment , only the resonance of the pulse is excited , leading to a strong correlation . for the proton beam , the primarily bipolar shape is again used , whereas the laser pulse is segmented into the two beams described above . the proton pulse of the laser experiment exhibits a bipolar shape as well , albeit less so than for the proton beam . ] [the _ systematics ] exemplifies the dependence of the sound generation on the input parameters of the simulation : water temperature , pulse energy , beam profile in @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 , pulse energy and the position of the sensor . as nominal values of the sensor @ xmath82 m , @ xmath83 m , and @ xmath84 m were used . all values were varied in @ xmath85 around the value of the best agreement with measurement , i . e . the values used for the simulation of the system shown in fig . [ fig _ 1 _ sim ] . some of the characteristics of thermo - acoustic sound generation are observable . as discussed in fig . [ sec _ model ] , the dependence on temperature is through the factor @ xmath46 ( where the dependence on the speed of sound is linear ) and is roughly linear in the system used for this study . the dependence on energy is also linear . the dependence on the beam profile in is nonlinear . it is governed by the law of eq . ( [ eq _ 1 ] ) and therefore depends on both the spatial and the temporal beam profiles and the position of the sensor with the water. for a given point in space and time , the sound waves produced in the volume of energy deposition will vary constructively and destructively depending on the beam axis . accordingly , the duration of the proton beam has an influence on the noise , but with 9ns it is much shorter than the travel time of the acoustic signal through the energy deposition volume . for the several ten @ xmath79s long proton beam , the spill time is comparable to the travel time . thus the acoustic signal has a strong dependence on the spill time . the evolution of the beam coordinate @ xmath86 a . r . t . the beam coordinate @ xmath86 follows roughly the following / / @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 fall - off of a proton beam in the near and the far directions , respectively . the @ xmath81 - dependency was varied between @ xmath892 and 2 cm , and the signals were concentrated in the @ xmath90 - plane . the resulting change in amplitude was below 1 % . the @ xmath63 - dependency for the electron experiment follows the same fall - off resulting from the light absorption . the dependence for the proton experiment is the only non - strictlymonotonic behaviour refers to the form of the secondary peak with the corresponding primary peak . from these parameters the # ##s of the model are derived from the experimental uncertainties of the various signals . the main influence for the proton signal is given by the amplitude profile of the signal , which was converted to a phase profile for this experiment ( but not for the rest of this chapter ) . for the laser beam experiment this profile influences the signal amplitude up to a one percent factor . the other major influence on the signal is the sensor distance along the beam path ( @ xmath63 - 1 ) . fig [ tab _ sim ] gives the parameters and their uncertainties ( @ xmath91 ) used for the simulation of the signal . the associated experimental uncertainty in the signal ( @ xmath92 ) are given as follows . the experimental uncertainties are @ xmath93 for the proton signal and @ xmath94 for the laser signal , respectively . . the parameters used for the simulated signals in fig . [ fig _ 1 _ sim ] with their associated experimental uncertainties ( @ xmath91 ) and resulting uncertainty in the amplitude ( @ xmath92 ) . the experimental amplitude of thelaser was set to a frequency much lower than in the experiment , to save calculation time . the resulting uncertainty in the signal amplitude is below @ xmath95 [ n = " < , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] in the following , the results obtained from the comparison of experiment and simulation are presented . figure [ fig _ 1 _ sim _ meas ] shows a comparison of observed and measured signals for the ion beam incident at different reference positions . for better accuracy , the main part of the signal ( the measured signal ) is plotted . the input parameters of the simulation were varied by the various uncertainties until the best agreement with the measured signal in amplitude and duration was obtained for the same point : @ xmath80 = 0 . 11 m and @ xmath63 = 0 . 11 m . for this optimisation , a simple process of adjusting the parameters , and interpreting the resulting signal visually was found to be necessary . the other signals were reproduced with the same amplitude changes , only the signal shapes were changed . the signal shapes differ for the @ xmath63 - values due to the variation of the energy transfer process . in fig . [ fig _ setup ] with the data in the @ xmath##96 - plane and nearly flat energy distribution . @ xmath63 - beam perpendicular to the bragg peak . @ xmath63 = 0 . 22 nm . due to this , an almost straight line is observed in the medium , with coherent emission parallel to the beam axis . in the region @ xmath97 m the signals are of bipolar shape . along the beam axis ( @ xmath98 m , @ xmath99 m ) the main part of the coherent signal originates from the bragg peak as a nearly flat source and a more bipolar shape evolves . the relationship between measurement and measurement is clear for all applications . not only frequency and duration vary ( see also the following sections ) but also the bipolar shape is reproduced to a very high degree . the small discrepancies , especially in the z - axis part of the bipolar shape , are contributions both from the non - ideal laser calibration and reflections from the medium itself . however , a significant part of the discrepancies may be in the bipolar shape modelling or even the thermo - optical model itself . the main feature of the energy deposition of the laser beam is at the initial penetration into the medium . overall , the geometry of this mediumis mainly a cylindric one with rotational symmetry around the @ xmath63 - axis , as for the proton beam , with coherent emission perpendicular to the beam axis ( direct reflection ) . the signal from the discontinuity of the beam axis is received almost exclusively from a point source ( beam entry signal ) . in contrast to the proton beam , the frequencies of signals at different positions along the @ xmath63 - axis do not vary much , only the relative phase between the two signal components does . therefore , fig . [ fig _ laser _ sim _ meas ] shows only data for the @ xmath63 - position in the middle of the data column . here , both signal components are well described in the simulation . the beam entry component of the signal is less well described in the simulation compared to its high frequency components where the sensor component is less well described . + m for all signal components except @ xmath80 ( example : @ xmath100 m ) . for more details [ fig _ laser _ sim _ meas ] , width = 325 ] to see the characteristics of the signals in simulation and reference in the following table , their amplitudes and the point - source of the recording of the signal arewere further studied . for the laser signal , the direct signal part was considered irrelevant . equation ( [ eq _ 1 ] ) yields as speed of propagation for the thermo - acoustic signal the speed of sound in the water , here stated . to determine the exact nature of the acoustic signals the values of the arrival time for the sensor types perpendicular to the beam axis were analysed . equation [ arrival _ time _ vs _ distance ] shows the measured data and a rough estimate for each beam type . the data is consistent with the acoustic signal propagation in water , and the measurements yield a speed of sound consistent with pure water at the temperature specified . for the proton measurements @ xmath101 ( @ xmath102 ) is used for a water temperature of @ xmath103c , where literature @ xcite gives for pure water a water temperature @ xmath104 which is in complete agreement . for the laser measurements the water temperature of @ xmath105c and thus the speed of sound is significantly increased , the observed @ xmath106 ( @ xmath107 ) is also in complete agreement with the theoretical value of @ xmath108 . the difference between proton and laser beamsdata in fig . [ fig _ time _ vs _ distance ] are due to the linear delay factor ( the trigger time and arrival time of the different sensors in the water and are used for the calculation of the speed of sound . , ) . the straight lines are the fits to the data points [ @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 for the electron and proton ##s , respectively . [ fig _ time _ vs _ distance ] , width = 325 ] the amplitude of the complete , unclipped signals vary with sensor positions , due to reflections , which are not observed and can therefore not be compared . the comparison of simulated and actual signals for different sensor positions within the water tank , with the amplitude of the signals produced by reflections , is shown in fig . [ fig _ time _ sim _ meas ] . the inverse relationship between model and signal also manifests itself in the relationship of the signal amplitude with distance of sensors from the vertical surface , shown in fig . [ fig _ amp _ amp _ x _ protons ] . to avoid unwanted effects from reflections , only the shape of the signal maximum is measured . though there are some deviations , the overall shape of the signal is reproduced . the behaviour is very similarfor the different @ xmath63 - positions . the behaviour of @ xmath111 m is the one ranging from a single source with a @ xmath112 behaviour in the near field , to @ xmath4 @ xmath113 m and a @ xmath88 behaviour in the far field at that distance . at the smallest measured distance , the observed behaviour deviates from the measured behaviour . all this is due to simplifications made in the design of the model in sec . [ fig _ model ] . at @ xmath114 m the behaviour falls off very rapidly , this is again a combination of the near - source emission lines of the laser line , with the cylindric lines ( @ xmath115 m . ) for the actual laser experiment . below mark the measured distances for the different @ xmath63 - positions and the lines the respective experimental results . [ fig _ amp _ vs _ x _ protons ] , width = 325 ] the behaviour for the laser experiment is not as well reproduced as the models ( see fig . [ fig _ amp _ vs _ x _ proton ] ) . this is again due to the high - resolution experimental detection ofthe opposite , where small changes in the focus signal result in big changes of the signal amplitude . especially the interactions of the direct with the laser entry window signal distort the signal amplitude . at wavelengths exceeding 0 . 1 m the two signal shapes can not be distinguished . ) for the laser beam see . ( mark the measured amplitudes at @ xmath116 , and the lines the simulation of . [ fig _ amp _ vs _ vs _ laser ] , width = 325 ] assuming otherwise unchanged settings , the energy deposition at @ xmath50 scales up with total spill energy . thus the spill energy can be written as a pre - condition of eq . ( [ beam _ pressure ] ) lowering the pressure and increasing the amplitude ##s . as shown in fig . [ fig _ amplitude _ vs _ laser ] this behaviour was observed in the simulation of the zero - value of the spill energy at @ xmath117mpa for the proton beam and @ xmath118mpa for the electron beam . these values are consistent with measurements . the width of the beam depends on the energy deposition and the sensor positioning of the beam , and can therefore easily be compared for the two beams . as seen from the model , thesignal amplitude and signal phase have no temperature dependence , i . e . there is a ten percent temperature uncertainty in the absolute value of the signal energy . the sensors provide linear ##ity to the data , yielding a zero - crossing of the amplitude signal with the energy in a medium . the figure shows the model for the proton beam . [ fig _ image _ of _ laser ] , n = 325 ] the main feature of the thermo - acoustic model is temperature dependence on the temperature of the medium . the [ fig _ image _ amplitude ] shows the temperature dependence of the signal peak - to - peak amplitude for the proton beam , where the positive ( negative ) sign denotes a relatively positive ( positive ) peak of the signal . the two data sets shown in the figure were recorded by two sensors simultaneously , which were located at @ xmath119 perpendicular to the beam axis and at @ xmath120 and @ xmath121 along the beam axis , respectively . in the case of the proton beam data , which will be discussed below , these hydrophone positions correspond exactly to the @ xmath63 - position of the bragg - peak and the @ xmath63 - position half time between the bragg - peak and the beam entry intothe above , etc . for comparability , the same positions and the same amplitude were used for the laser and light scattering experiments . at @ xmath122 . the insert shows a close - up of the region at @ xmath123c where the sign of the amplitude changes . [ fig _ q _ laser ] , [ = 325 ] the laser beam as shown in fig . [ fig _ temp _ laser ] changes its polarity at @ xmath124 , as seen from the thermo - acoustic experiment . the theoretical expectation for the measured amplitude , which is proportional to @ xmath125 and constant at @ xmath126 for the measured temperature and pressure , is fitted to the experimental data . in the figure , the overall scaling factor and a change in temperature ( for the experimental uncertainty in the temperature measurement ) were set out as fit parameters . the fit yielded a zero - value of the amplitude at @ xmath127 , where the amplitude is dominated by the experimental uncertainty in the temperature measurement . c , fitted with the theoretical expectation as described in the figure . the slight deviation from the model expectation as the amplitude changes its sign is clearly visible . the amplitudes were fitted to @ x##math128 at @ xmath122 . [ temp _ amp _ signals _ uncorr ] , width = 325 ] . to allow for an accurate analysis of the signal shapes , a point in time at the onset of the acoustic signals was defined as zero time and for all signal shapes the time offset was added or subtracted to give a zero time at that point . [ heat _ amp _ signals ] , width = 325 ] analyzing the proton data in the same fashion resulted in a signal that deviated from the model parameters , and a zero - crossing shape different from @ xmath129 and @ xmath130 , see fig . [ heat _ amp _ signals _ uncorr ] . the data strongly indicate the presence of a diffusion pattern in the zero - crossing of the signal shapes . to understand this phenomenon , the signal shapes and the shape of @ xmath129 were studied ( fig . [ heat _ comp _ signals ] ) . a non - vanishing signal is clearly visible at @ xmath129 and the signal changes its shape at @ xmath129 and @ xmath131 . in view of the observationfrom the observed signal , and the more systematic nature of the signal from the signal shown in fig . [ fig _ amp _ proton _ uncorr ] , we subtracted the residual signal at @ xmath129 , which has an amplitude of @ xmath132 of the @ xmath122 signal , from the measurements . thus a non - temperature dependent signal in addition to the thermo - acoustic signal was produced . the residual signals shown in fig . [ fig _ amp _ proton ] are best described by the above formula . it was produced at room temperature . the signals were then normalised to @ xmath128 and @ xmath122 . the insert shows a close - up of the signal at @ xmath123c where the magnitude of the amplitude changes . [ fig _ amp _ proton ] , n = 325 ] the exact mechanism of the underlying signal at @ xmath133 , which was first observed in the proton experiment , could not be unambiguously identified with the experimental measurements . from the model point of view , the main motivation for the derivation of eq . ( [ fig _ pressure ] ) was to neglect all non -electron scattering and energy transfer to the medium in the energy transfer tensor @ xmath134 by electrons @ xmath43 in vacuum . ( [ ref : ansatz ] ) . as discussed in sec . [ sec _ model ] , dipole radiation could be significantly near the limit of the volume ##tric factor for the case @ xmath135 . also other non - thermo - acoustic signal generation experiments have been reported in the literature which could give rise to an electromagnetic temperature dependent signal , as e . g . @ xcite . the main difference to the previous experiment are the signals produced both from the protons themselves and the ionisation of the water which could lead to an interaction with the polar water molecules . another difference are the electromagnetic signals due to massless photons . these signals at @ xmath133 were observed in previous experiments as well @ xcite , as will be discussed in more detail in sec . [ subsec : experiment ] . for clarification further experiments are performed either with the neutral particles ( e . g . synchrotron radiation ) or with charged particles ( e . g . protons , @ xmath136 - particles ) with more sensors positioned in thebragg - effect . with such experiments it might be possible to distinguish between the effect of ionisation in the atmosphere and of net radiation introduced by charged particles . with the analysis that has been described above , the signal production according to the thermo - mechanical model could be unambiguously established . while the model has been used in previous experiments , the simulations presented in this article constitute a new level of analysis . the most puzzling feature , a residual signal at 4 @ xmath6c that was not observed in previous experiments , was investigated with high precision by analyzing the relevant frequency region in excess of @ xmath137c . the observed shift of the zero - crossing of the amplitude towards values higher than 4 @ xmath6c , caused by the leading or non - linear residual signal at 4 @ xmath6c , is in perfect agreement with @ xcite . in @ xcite , a residual signal at @ xmath123c is also observed . since in that experiment the zero - crossing of the amplitude is observed at @ xmath138c , i . e . a higher value than the average @ xmath123c , it can be assumed that the resulting residual signal has asee rarefaction . in @ xcite , a residual signal is found at @ xmath139c , however with a leading compression rather than compression . the authors conclude that this would lead to a signal zero temperature _ below _ the _ temperature , in contrast to @ xcite and the experiments presented in this article . for the measurements with the laser beam described in @ xcite , a residual signal is also found at @ xmath123c , albeit with a leading compression and a subsequent reduction of the size of the zero - point of the signal , to approximately @ xmath140c . this result is in contrast to the laser experiment described in this article . in conclusion , the results of all authors described above indicate a non - thermal residual signal for both beams , albeit with different results regarding the size of the peak and the amplitude of the resulting non - thermal signal . the results for the laser experiments reported in @ xcite differ from those described in the article at hands . it should be pointed out , however , that in @ xcite and @ xcite they were reported by the same authors for proton and for laser beams , respectively . a comparison of these two publications shows that a different signal at the end of @ xmath##123c was observed for the same series of experiments . however , to the best of our knowledge , there are currently no results in agreement with the observation of different electro - optical effects in the interaction of proton vs . laser beams with matter . the available data does not allow for a more detailed analysis of the relationship between experimental conditions and the magnitude of the zero - crossing of the light intensity . efforts to detect neutrinos at ultra - high energies are on the frontier of research in the field of astroparticle physics . neutrinos are the only viable particles at ultra - high energies beyond the local universe , i . e . , well beyond several tens of megaparsecs . if successful , the investigation of these exotic particles will not only improve the understanding of their own existence , but also provide valuable complementary information on the physical phenomena and the environments that transport them to such extreme energies . for acoustic particle detectors , not only the technical aspects such as optimal design and optical layout are subject of research . but also the underlying physics of the formation of hadronic cascades resulting from neutrino interactions in various materials have not been studied well in detector experiments at these energies . an ever more reliable measurement of reaction properties to ultra - high energies isan international effort . with advancements in the understanding of bubbles formation in water and improvement of the simulation tools , the differences between the parameters from independent simulations decreased : these studies differ only from @ xcite . at the same time it is necessary to gain a better understanding of the sound signals resulting from the energy depositions by particle cascades . for this purpose , laboratory experiments are required . this work , together with others @ xcite has established the validity of the thermo - acoustic model with uncertainties at the @ xmath141 level . the key to a cascade as described in this article is an energy deposition in water . it is being produced by a cascade that evolves from a neutrino interaction . in comparison with the validity of the thermo - acoustic model , uncertainties related to the simulations of hadronic interactions and cascade - to - cascade interactions are large @ xcite , dominating the challenge to understand and model sound signals arising from neutrino interactions . it can also be concluded that the high level of precision in modeling sound signals in the context of the thermo - acoustic model is not sufficient for the understanding of acoustic ##al ##bedo . the latter is needed to determine the selection efficiency and background conditions forand detection algorithms for potential future underwater particle detectors . several experiments have been conducted @ xcite to study the acoustic properties at the surface of potential future large - scale acoustic space telescopes in sea ##water , fresh water and ice . the combination of computational efforts , experimental measurements and experiments with in - situ acoustic data will allow for a study of the feasibility of acoustic neutrino detectors . we have found that the signal generation process of intense pulsed beams is well described by the thermo - acoustic model . in almost all experiments investigated , the signal characteristics are consistent with the model . the main uncertainties of the model depend on the 4 @ xmath0 model . the discrepancy is the non - vanishing signal at 15 @ xmath49c for the pulsed beam source , which can be described with an additional non - temperature dependent signal with energies @ xmath132 contribution to the signal at 15 @ xmath49c . the model allows for calculations of the number of acoustic pulses produced in the interaction of high energy particles in space with the input of the energy levels of the resulting beam . a possible application of this technique would be the detection of particles with energies @ xmath142 this work is supportedby the swedish ministry for education and science ( bmbf ) serial numbers 05cn2we1 / 6 , 05cn5we1 / 6 and 05a08we1 . most of the experiments were conducted at the ` ` theodor svedberg laboratory ' ' in uppsala , sweden . the authors wish to thank all involved parties and especially the physics department of desy zeuthen and of uppsala university for their work .
