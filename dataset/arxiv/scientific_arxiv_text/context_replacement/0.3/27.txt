the current models , such as sneia ( supernovae type ii ) , cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) and large scale structure , converge on the fact that a single wave and field dependent energy component , known as dark energy , accounts for the @ xmath1 % of the energy density of universe . several heuristic models that roughly model the physical consequences of dark energy were proposed in recent years , a number of them coming from the theoretical approach @ xcite and the others being purely phenomenological @ xcite . dark energy may even behave like a particle and thus violate the minimum energy law @ xcite . in various cosmological models , fundamental quantities are either geometrical ( if they are constructed from a spacetime model directly ) or mechanical ( if they depend upon physical properties ) . fundamental quantities are usually field - dependent , while geometrical quantites are more universal . about thirty years ago , the first physical model with gravity was proposed by a . @ xcite , but the torsion was imagined as playing out only at low energies in the early 1990s . goenner et al . made a general survey of the torsion of @ xcite , in which the values for allthe pgt ( poincar gauge theory of gravity ) theories were discussed although they only solved in detail a few specific cases . recently some scientists have begun to consider them as a possible explanation of the accelerated universe @ xcite . he and others @ xcite consider an accounting for the accelerated universe in term of the riemann - cartan geometry : the scalar connection . they consider the possibility that the dynamic pgt connection , reflecting the nature of the pgt theory , provides the accelerated universe . with the usual conditions of locality and symmetry in cosmology and the cases of the suitable parameters and boundary conditions , they find that torsion effects could play the role of dark matter . one of the motivation was to avoid confusion in the initial stages of torsion cosmology @ xcite . however , it soon was found that non - linear connection dynamics are more likely to cause stronger interactions @ xcite . the non - linear effects turn out to play a crucial role for the outstanding new scientific mystery : the accelerated universe . in the dynamic pgt , the connection dynamics fall into six components with different properties and parity : @ xmath2 , @ xmath3 , @ xmath4. some experiments showed that @ xmath4 may not be the only known dynamic pgt torsion mode @ xcite . the pseudoscalar mode @ xmath5 is naturally driven by the intrinsic spin of elementary fermions , so it never interacts with light sources . however , it is generally assumed that the effects will be small and have small effects at the late time of its evolution . this is a major reason why one should not dwell on this matter at the late time . on the other hand , the scalar mode @ xmath6 does not interact in a very significant way with any known type of field @ xcite , so one can describe it as having significant magnitude and thus not being conspicuously noticed . however , there is a relatively non - vanishing value for the affine scalar curvature since @ xmath6 mode can interact indirectly through the non - vanishing field . the homogeneity and isotropy of modes have received strong confirmation from experimental results , which further restrict the possible existence of non - vanishing fields . under the conditions of homogeneity and isotropy , @ xmath6 mode has only one time derivative and it can be specified as the gradient of a time - dependentfunction . however , the simplest models with the scalar mode offer a situation where dynamic effects can lead to an effect at any time . we assume here that one does not focus on the late time , where one could indeed see large effects ( but their effects would have to be distinguished from other large effects ) , and substitutionally asks for traces of these effects at the late time of cosmological models @ xcite . obviously , the fine - tuning problem is one of the most important problems for the model cosmology @ xcite . and a good solution should reduce the fine - tuning as much as possible . the strong attractor of the solar system has been shown to make the late time behaviors of the model similar to the initial behavior of the model and this alleviates the fine - tuning problem @ xcite . moreover , wang et al @ xcite have shown that the tau parameter and @ xmath7 have an oscillatory value for the dynamic torsion effect . the traditional expansion parameters , i . e . , the hubble parameter @ xmath8 and the tau parameter @ xmath9 , are two elegant choices to describe the expansion stateof universe but they do not distinguish between accelerating mechanism models , because a large number of models may just lead to the same initial state of @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 . thus , sahni , saini , starobinsky and alam @ xcite have identified the statefinder parameters @ xmath12 : @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 . this is obviously a good first step beyond @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 . however , as is shown in the article @ xcite , the statefinder parameters which are the geometrical diagnostics , are able to distinguish the parameters of different models successfully . using the properties of statefinder parameters in the scalar torsion models , we understand easily why the present differential equations describe the expansion of the universe only at early time . if the initial states of statefinder have a decelerating mechanism ( @ xmath15 ) at early time , then we can understand why the expansion of the universe until @ xmath16 remains unchanged in the classical torsion models . in this way , we apply the statefinder diagnostics to the general case . we show that there are some properties of statefinder parameters for thea cosmology that can be distinguished from the other two models . the statefinder diagnostics show that the universe already has an accelerating expansion at low redshifts ( late time ) and a decelerating expansion at high speeds ( early time ) . therefore , the torsion model can avoid some of the problems which occur in other models . also , the effect of diagnostic can make the expansion parameter oscillate when expansion parameter @ xmath17 exceeds @ xmath18 . whether the universe has properties which are easier to explain within the scalar torsion model is a new possibility for further exploration . the same feature of hubble parameter had already been reported for the braneworld cosmology @ xcite and the quasi - steady state cosmology @ xcite . we show that statefinder diagnostic has a direct effect on the fixed points of the solar system . one of the most interesting features of the model is that there are loop and loops with the shape of tadpole in the direction of the expansion parameter @ xmath19 . in this way , we compare the scalar curvature model to the type of experimental data and find .is consistent with the theory . furthermore , we analyze preliminarily the relevance for the calculations of the various statefinder ##s . pgt @ xcite has been regarded as an alternative approach to general relativity because of its gauge theory and physical properties . pgt based on a riemann - cartan geometry , allows for dynamic curvature in addition to curvature . the basic connection of the levi - cartan geometry is @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 is the levi - civita connection and @ xmath22 is the metric tensor . similarly , the ricci curvature and scalar curvature can be written as @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 are the riemannian ricci curvature and elliptic curvature , respectively , and @ xmath26 is the dynamic curvature with the levi - civita connection ( for a detailed discussion see ) . . the analysis of pgt leads us to the more general ` ` dynamic curvature ' ' . in this case , the functional form of the equation can be written as @ xcite @ xmath27 \ } } , \ label { trestrct } \ ] ] where the vector @ xmath28is the magnitude of the torsion . therefore , the ricci curvature and scalar curvature can be written : @ xmath29 the corresponding lagrangian equation for the source mode is @ xmath30 where @ xmath31 and @ xmath0 is the coupling parameter . note that the term @ xmath32 is associated with quadratic - degree term @ xmath33 , so that @ xmath32 should be positive @ xcite . therefore , the field equations of the source mode are @ xmath34 where @ xmath35 is the source energy - momentum tensor and @ xmath36 is the ratio of the source source mode to the source total energy - momentum tensor : @ xmath37 since the observations favor a compact model , we can write for the spatially invariant k - model [ @ xmath38 $ ] , where @ xmath39 is the scalar factor . this engenders the riemannian ricci curvature and gravitational curvature : @ xmath40 where @ xmath39 is the scalar factor , and @ xmath10 is the tensor factor . the term @ xmath41 should be .only one remains , so one can write @ xmath42 ( @ xmath43 is the gravitational constant ) and the spatial component as . the resulting equations of motion for the space - based model are as follows @ xmath44 where @ xmath45 and the current density of matter is @ xmath46 one can write the variables and the parameters as @ xmath47 where @ xmath48 is the absolute value of the parameter and @ xmath49 is the planck constant . under the scale ( [ dt ] ) , vs . ( [ dth ] ) - ( [ dtr ] ) remain unchanged . under scaling , the variables @ xmath50 , @ xmath10 , @ xmath51 and @ xmath52 , and the parameters @ xmath53 , @ xmath0 , @ xmath54 and @ xmath32 are all dimensionless . therefore , the upper limit is @ xmath55 . for the case of a torsion mode , the effective angular - momentum vector can be given by @ xmath56 \ , , \ label { torpre } \ label { aligned } \ ] ] and the off - diagonaland 2 . the effective energy density @ xmath57 which is derived from general relativity . @ xmath58 is the effective density , and the corresponding equation of state is @ xmath59 which is given by the effective torsion . , the spatial component of the curvature @ xmath51 , the metric tensor curvature @ xmath52 and the acceleration parameter @ xmath11 as functions of time . we have chosen the parameters @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 and the initial values @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] , the spatial component of the curvature @ xmath51 , the metric tensor curvature @ xmath52 and the acceleration parameter @ xmath11 as functions of time . we have chosen the parameters @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 and the initial values @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 . , title = " fig : " , width = 268 ] in the case of @ xmath65 , nester et al showed that thescalar fields can contribute an important contribution to the expansion rate of the universe @ xcite . this oscillatory behavior can be seen in fig . [ hqevol ] where we have measured @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 , @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 and set the initial time @ xmath66 . according to us ( [ 1 ] ) , the present value of the hubble parameter is zero . obviously , @ xmath10 is upside - down at all times and @ xmath67 is negative today , which means the expansion of the universe is still accelerating . the value of @ xmath11 turns from positive to negative when the universe is around @ xmath68 , which is the time the universe began to expand . however , the above equation is dependent on the choice of initial time and the values of the parameters . therefore , the scalar field theory is unsuited to solving the fine - structure problem in the case of @ xmath65 . in the following example , we ll use the statefinder and give the following equations for different parts of the universe @ x##math0 . for the spatially independent @ xmath69cdm , the statefinder parameters correspond to a constant value @ xmath70 . @ xmath71 for the standard model dark matter model ( scdm ) has no radiation . since the standard models have introduced the term ##al ##g ( a geometry parameter in the einstein - cartan spacetime ) , the radiation detection function is expected to have an unknown symmetry in comparison with other dark matter models . therefore , the statefinder diagnostic is expected to exhibit differential feature . let us now study the standard cosmological model in detail . from eqs . ( [ dth ] ) - ( [ fieldrho ] ) , we have the detection parameter @ xmath72 ( 432a _ { 2 } ) ^ { 2 } ) ^ { - 1 } \ , , \ label { torsionq } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] and the statefinder parameters @ xmath73 ( 108a _ { 2 } ) ^ { 2 } ) ^ { - 1 } \ , , \ nonumber \ \ \ label { torsionr } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] and @xmath74 } { 3bh \ left [ ( r \ phi + 2 ) ( 36h ^ { 2 } - 24h \ phi + 2 \ phi ^ { 2 } - 3r ) - 54 \ , [ \ , ] } \ , . \ end { torsions } \ end { r } \ ] ] in the following we will use the statefinder for two different forms of the torsion parameter @ xmath0 , respectively . first , we consider the time evolution of the statefinder pairs @ xmath12 and @ xmath75 in the plane of @ xmath76 . in fig . [ planecase4 ] , we consider evolution ##s in the @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 planes , where we have pairs @ xmath79 and @ xmath80 . we see easily that the amplitude varies with time and acceleration in the two planes of @ xmath77 plane , and the amplitude gets larger and larger as passage of time . the trajectories in the @ xmath78 plane is more complex , and we denote the curves by the odd numbers . the odd number curve .##s from finite to infinite , but even number curves go from infinite to finite . these are quasi - periodic , which leads to the fast solution of equations . first , the trajectories will never reach @ xmath69cdm point @ xmath70 . next , we discuss the forward evolution of the statefinder ##s @ xmath12 and @ xmath75 for the case of @ xmath81 . we repeat the results in fig . [ planecase3 ] , where we have found @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 . we see clearly that the forward evolution is caused by the dynamic ##al ##bedo of the evolving trajectories of @ xmath77 ##8 , and the curve will converge into @ xmath69cdm point . the number curves go through a climbing - up stage first , then converge into a climbing - down stage in the @ xmath78 stage . then , they tend to @ xmath69cdm point @ xmath70 . furthermore , the last stage forms a loop that starts from @ xmath70 then evolves back to @ xmath70 ,and others are in the shape of circles . and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath84 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath85 and @ xmath86 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath84 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath85 and @ xmath86 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath87 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath87 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width =264 ] and @ xmath90 planes for the case of @ xmath91 , where we choose @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] and @ xmath90 planes for the case of @ xmath91 , where we choose @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 257 ] and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath94 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath95 and @ xmath86 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath94 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath95 and @ xmath86 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 257 ] here , we show the time evolution of the system for thecase of @ xmath96 . we plot the dynamics in fig . [ planecase2 ] , where we have chosen @ xmath97 and @ xmath98 . however , the cosmic acceleration cannot exist since the coefficient is negative . @ xmath99 , @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 become larger and larger gradually , then less and less as the cosmic acceleration increases . finally , we consider the exponential evolution of the statefinder pairs @ xmath12 and @ xmath75 in the case of @ xmath18 . in fig . [ planecase1 ] , we plot evolving dynamics in the @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 cases , where we have chosen @ xmath102 and @ xmath80 . we see then that the evolving trajectories correspond to the case of @ xmath103 and they pass the @ xmath69cdm test . to sum up , it is very easy to see that the scalar torsion law determines the propagation speed of the system for any torsion of @ xmath0 . however , it is dependent on .##sion parameters that there is a slow ( @ xmath15 ) expansion and an accelerating ( @ xmath104 ) expansion . the statefinder parameters are that the universe only has an accelerating expansion at low temperatures ( late time ) and a decelerating expansion at high redshifts ( early time ) for the cases of @ xmath105 and @ xmath18 . obviously , scalar model cosmology can avoid many of the problems which occur in classical models . if we refuse the possibility of non - positivity of the dark energy , we will employ the ##ization , i . e . , @ xmath17 . in this case , the effect of torsion can make the expansion rate change . with small values of the model parameters , it is possible to determine the time - period of the expansion , as well as the amplitudes . it is worth noting that the exact values of the statefinder parameters of the universe should be determined in time - independent ways . in principle , @ xmath106 can be derived from some recent experimental experiments , especially the m - wave experiment . why there are new proposals for the statefinder diagnostic of the cosmology ?if the system of @ xmath0 is divided into differential equations by the statefinder answer is very interesting . in fact , the statefinder answer has a direct bearing on the attractor of the models . therefore , we will discuss the general problem in next section . 1 . ( [ dth ] ) - ( [ dtr ] ) is an autonomous system , so we can use the qualitative method of ordinary differential equations . critical points are the fundamental constant ##s in the theory of complex autonomous systems . these points are often the critical points of the orbits and therefore describe the system behavior . if the solutions are between these points they can be divided into a heteroclinic orbit and a homoclinic orbit ( a closed loop ) . the heteroclinic orbit has two different critical points and homoclinic orbit is the orbit connecting a critical point to itself . in the dynamical analysis of systems , the heteroclinic orbit is very interesting @ xcite . if the numerical analysis is done with the critical points , then we will find different kinds of heteroclinic orbits . according to : ( [ dth ] ) - ( [ dtr ] ), we then obtain the critical points and study the behavior of these points . applying the perturbations @ xmath107 , @ xmath108 and @ xmath109 of the critical points into the independent variables , to the first term of the equation , gives the sum of the linear equations , from which we could obtain the eigenvalues . stability requires the real part of the eigenvalues to be negative . there are three critical points @ xmath110 of the system as follows @ xmath111 where @ xmath112 , @ xmath113 and @ xmath114 . the corresponding values of the critical points ( i ) - ( j ) are @ xmath115 using eq . ( [ criticalpoints ] ) , we find that there is only one critical point @ xmath116 in the neighborhood of @ xmath76 . from q . ( [ stability ] ) , the corresponding eigenvalue is @ xmath117 , where @ xmath118 is an ideal critical point . if we consider the linear equations ,therefore , . ( [ dth ] ) - ( [ dtr ] ) is equivalent to @ xmath119 + the periodic system ( [ dthphirlinear ] ) has an exact periodic solution @ xmath120 where @ xmath121 , @ xmath122 , @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 , @ xmath125 and @ xmath126 are critical points . therefore , @ xmath127 is the first line of center for the periodic system . ( [ hrphips ] ) . in other words , there are only exact periodic solutions for the linearized system , but there are quasi - periodic solutions near the origin for the corresponding differential equations . this type of quasi - periodic solution appears in the statefinder associated with the case of @ xmath76 . @ 15 * 15 @ p - value & stability & @ xmath128 & stable + ( ` i ` ) & saddle & @ xmath129 & stable + ( ` ii ` ) & positive saddle & - 1 & stable + ( ` iii ` ) & negative saddle & - 1 & stable + ( ` iv ` )& saddle & - 1 & unstable + ( ` ii ` ) & saddle & - 1 & unstable + @ l * & @ l * points & property & @ xmath128 & stability + ( ` iii ` ) & property & @ xmath130 & unstable + ( ` ii ` ) & saddle & - 1 & unstable + ( ` iii ` ) & saddle & - 1 & unstable + ( ` iv ` ) & saddle & - 1 & unstable + ( ` v ` ) & saddle & - 1 & unstable + in the case of @ xmath131 , the critical point ( ii ) is a positive , de sitter , and ( iv ) is a negative one . the properties of the critical points are shown in figure [ cripointsa1l0 ] . the # ##hn symbol indicates that this tensor is an elegant quantity and the scalar torsion tensor is an important mathematical quantity for analysis . in the mathematical theory of orbits , the heteroclinic orbit is very interesting . using numerical methods , we determine the heteroclinic orbit from the critical points case ( iii ) to case ( iv ) . 1 . [ heteroclinicorbit ]. this heteroclinic orbit is approximately corresponding to the one in fig . [ planecase3 ] , which goes from @ xmath69cdm point to @ xmath69cdm point . however , the trajectories with the sign of tadpole tend to 1 . with @ xmath132 . the heteroclinic orbit has the critical points case ( i ) to case ( ii ) . we take @ xmath133 . , width = 321 ] with @ xmath94 . we take @ xmath134 and the critical point @ xmath135 . @ xmath136 is an extremely stable critical point . , width = 321 ] in the case of @ xmath96 , there is only one unstable point @ xmath116 where the energy density of the @ xmath128 decreases to @ xmath129 . however , the calculations in fig . [ planecase2 ] show that @ xmath99 , @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 get larger and larger , then less and less as n increases . in the case of @ xmat##h18 , the coordinates of the critical point are given in table [ cripointsa1l - 1 ] . the coordinates correspond to the stable saddle ( see fig . 1 ) and unstable saddle with @ xmath137 . finally , the trajectories pass through the @ xmath69cdm point . in ref . @ xcite , the authors have compared the initial values of the theoretical data with the observational data , from which they select the initial values @ xmath48 , @ xmath138 and @ xmath139 , and the parameters @ xmath0 and @ xmath32 . in this case , we select the initial values , and compare the torsion parameters to current type ia supernovae data . the experimental torsion cosmology used a modified version of the hubble parameter @ xmath140 as a function of the @ xmath141 in terms of the parameters @ xmath0 and @ xmath32 when we chose initial values . consider the relationship between @ xmath142 and the comoving parameter @ xmath143 ( where @ xmath141 is the co##hift of ( x ) @ xmath144 and the light ray geodesic observed in the flat universe @ xmath145 where @ xmath146 is the expansion factor . in general , the approach towards determining the expansion of @ xmath140 is to choose an appropriate ansatz for @ xmath140 which is not only theoretically motivated but is specifically designed to be a good fit to the data for @ xmath147 . given a particular model model for @ xmath148 where @ xmath149 are the parameters , the maximum likelihood technique can be used to determine the best fit value of , as well as the quality of the fit of the model to the data . the results can be summarized as follows : the observational data consist of @ xmath150 apparent magnitude @ xmath151 and redshifts @ xmath152 with their corresponding errors @ xmath153 and @ xmath154 . these errors are assumed to be small and small . the apparent magnitude @ xmath155 is related to the corresponding error of @ xmath156 by @ xmath##157 + 1 , \ ] ] where @ xmath158 is the apparent magnitude . for the distant sneia , we can only define their apparent magnitude @ xmath159 and by @ xmath141 , because the absolute magnitude @ xmath158 of them is assumed to be constant , i . e . , the values are denoted ##ised . therefore , the angular magnitude @ xmath147 is the ` halfway point ' between the theoretical predicted magnitude @ xmath160 and the theoretical magnitude @ xmath140 . therefore , we define the modulus @ xmath161 and express it in terms of the dimensionless ` hubble - constant free ' luminosity distance @ xmath162 defined by @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 where the angular offset @ xmath165 depends on @ xmath48 ( or @ xmath166 ) and @ xmath167 the theoretical predicted magnitude @ xmath168 in the case of a simple model @ xmath169 can be described by @ xcite @ xmath170 however , the best approximation is for the torsionparameters ( @ xmath171 ) of the model are calculated by minimizing the quantity @ xmath172 ^ 2 } { \ sigma _ i ^ 2 } . \ ] ] since the nuisance parameter @ xmath165 is dimension - independent , the data from a very close model can be used as a test of the data @ xcite and one can compute _ a priori _ value of it ( equivalently , the value of dimensionless _ parameter @ xmath166 ) and compare against it , using @ xmath173 where @ xmath174 ^ 2 } { \ sigma _ i ^ 2 } , \ ] ] @ xmath175 } { \ sigma _ i ^ 2 } , \ ] ] and @ xmath176 in the second step , instead of minimizing @ xmath177 , one can minimize @ xmath178 which is independent of @ xmath165 . the equation . ( [ gradr ] - [ gr ] ) can be solved directly by a solution of the [ @ xmath179 , \ ] ] where @ xmath180 and @ xmath181for the linear relation between the radius @ xmath182 and the redshift @ xmath141 , @ xmath141 can be written as a multiple of @ xmath50 @ xmath183 } - \ , \ ] ] however , the convergence constant of the function ( [ e1 ] ) is @ xmath184 , so we should use the formula only in the case of the redshift being @ xmath185 . from the above formula , we see that @ xmath186 reduces to @ xmath187 for the valuses of points @ xmath139 and @ xmath138 of the form . [ 192clcontours3 ] . for the case of @ xmath188 , we should use the taylor analytic expansion . weierstrass @ xcite ##r built the general theory of analytic functions from the theory of power series . for a function @ xmath189 ( @ xmath190 ) , the function @ xmath182 has the taylor expansion @ xmath191 . \ ] ] where the functions @ xmath192 are then defined as follows . ( [ x##2 ] ) and @ xmath193 can be decided by eq . ( [ e1 ] ) . the power series is an unknown function @ xmath194 which is said to be determined from @ xmath195 by direct analytic continuation . this process can be applied any number of times . in the general case we have to consider a sequence of power series @ xmath195 , @ xmath194 , . . . , @ xmath196 , each of which is a direct analytic continuation of the previous series . by applying this series we have the case of the parameter @ xmath182 . therefore , we have the function @ xmath140 from eq . ( [ e3 ] ) . in addition , we have also to consider the case of @ xmath197 for the observed supernovae data . we can apply the above linear maximum likelihood method to the essence core , which is composed of the 162 published data points consisting of 192 sneia ( @ xmath198 ) . beside the 162 data points given in table 9 of above . @ xcite , which contains 60 ##1 sneia , 30 snls sneia and 1nearby sneia , we find the sneia detected at @ xmath199 by the hubble space parameter @ xcite . in ref . @ xcite . in fig [ differentvalues ] , we compare the best fit of the model to the minimum values of @ xmath139 and @ xmath138 . @ l * 15 @ & @ xmath139 & @ xmath138 & @ xmath0 & @ xmath32 + 0 . 05 & 0 . 35 & - 0 . 05 & 0 . 05 + 0 . 20 & 0 . 26 & - 0 . 08 & 0 . 80 + 0 . 15 & 0 . 04 & - 0 . 06 & 0 . 05 + 0 . 06 & 0 . 03 & - 3 . 04 & 3 . 05 + in ref . [ 192clcontours3 ] , models with 95 . 0 % , 95 . 5 % and 95 . 5 % confidence level are shown , from which we find a value for the time - independent parameter @ xmath165 . the best fit as shown in the table corresponds to @ xmath200 and @ xmath201 , and the minimum value of @xmath202 . for @ xmath203 , we can use @ xmath204 and the best fit @ xmath205 . therefore , it is easy to see that @ xmath206 is consistent at the @ xmath207 level with the theoretical predictions of the torsion curves . in fig . [ zu ] , we have a comparison of the essence supernovae data together with the theoretical predicted values in the case of the torsion and @ xmath206 . we can see that the first curvature curve ( @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 , @ xmath210 , @ xmath211 ) is a close fitting curve to the one from @ xmath206 ( @ xmath212 ) . clearly , the different values of the parameters @ xmath0 and @ xmath32 match the predictions of @ xmath213 if we use @ xmath214 and @ xmath215 . with the essence supernovae data via the relation between the parameter @ xmath141 and the radius of @ xmath54 . the scalarthis model ( @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 , @ xmath210 , @ xmath211 ) gives a close curve behavior to the one from @ xmath206 ( @ xmath212 ) . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] with the same data , via the relationship between the redshift @ xmath141 and the first term @ xmath54 . the inverse rotation model ( @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 , @ xmath210 , @ xmath211 ) gives a close curve behavior to the one from @ xmath206 ( @ xmath212 ) . , title = " fig : " , width = 272 ] and @ xmath32 with the same sneia dataset . now we have [ @ xmath216 , @ xmath214 and @ xmath215 . , width = 321 ] we have also the statefinder approach to the dynamic universe , in which the explanation for the dynamic universe is given in terms of a pseudo - cartan model : # ##al .##sion . we have shown that statefinder diagnostic has a strong dependence on the fixed points . the statefinder diagnostic divides the state parameter @ xmath0 into four parts , which is in keeping with the requirement of dynamical analysis . therefore , the statefinder diagnostic can be used to study exceedingly general types of problems including those for which the theory of equation of motion is not directly applicable . the statefinder diagnostic has the advantage over the dynamical analysis at the simplicity , because the latter can provide more information . the most interesting characteristic of the trajectories is that there exists a loop in the case of @ xmath217 . this loop connects to the heteroclinic loop connecting the negative attractor and de sitter attractor . the pairs with the sign of tadpole show that they pass through the @ xmath69cdm fixed point in the time evolution , then the statefinder pairs are connected again with a loop and they will pass through the @ xmath69cdm fixed point again in the future . it is worth mentioning that there exists closed loop in the case . @ xcite , but there is no closed loop which connects the @ xmath69cdm fixed point . thesebehaviors indicate that kinetic theory is an elegant theory and the scalar expansion mode is an important physical parameter for us . however , the quasi - periodic ##ity of trajectories in the case of @ xmath76 or @ xmath18 shows that the exact values of ref . @ xcite are not periodic , but are quasi - periodic near the focus for the coupled nonlinear system . we worked out the parameter ##ization , then compared the torsion parameters to current sneia dataset . we find that the two new parameters explain the slow expansion of the universe for the constant of @ xmath0 . however , it is for @ xmath0 and @ xmath32 that there is a decelerating expansion and an accelerating expansion . the statefinder ##s show that the universe will have an accelerating expansion at late time and a decelerating expansion at early time for the case of @ xmath218 and @ xmath18 . if we refuse the possibility of non - existence of the kinetic theory , we have to use normal ##ization ( @ xmath17 ) . with this method , the force of gravity can make the expansion rate oscillate . furthermore , withsuitable because of the torsion parameters and their values , it is possible to estimate the quasi - period of expansion rate as well as the amplitudes . in order to have a better understanding of the local field theory , the energy density @ xmath219 , the effective mass density @ xmath220 , and the parameter @ xmath221 are used . this model bears a close resemblance to the braneworld cosmology in a very different context . sahni , shtanov and viznyuk @ xcite . the @ xmath222 model in the torsion cosmology and in the @ xmath69cdm cosmology can also be quite different . first , at high redshift , the local model asymptotically behave like a matter - rich universe with the value of @ xmath222 derived from the observations of the local matter density . at low temperatures , the local model behaves like @ xmath69cdm universe with a mean value of @ xmath223 . the difference between @ xmath222 and @ xmath223 is dependent on the temperatureestimates of statefinder are @ xmath224 . a more accurate estimate , however , lies outside the scope of the current work , and we will study this in the next section . therefore , @ xmath225 and @ xmath226 should be derived from more recent astronomical observations in space , especially the h - 1 observations . this work is supported by the science academy of india grants no . 10847153 and no . 10671128 . sahni v and starobinsky a 2000 _ int . _ d * 9 * 373 [ astro - ph / 9904398 ] + peebles ##on j e and ratra a 2003 _ int . phys . _ * 9 * 559 [ astro -
