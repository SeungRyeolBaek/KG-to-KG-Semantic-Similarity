for complex physical systems in general , the intermediate term is usually expressed in terms of a term in the time scale @ xmath0 with integer coefficients , so that in the next - to - next - to - next - to - next case ( or @ xmath4lo ) we get @ xmath5 where @ xmath6 has real scales , and @ xmath7 is a fixed scale . thus , the term @ xmath8 is the full - scale scale . the intermediate terms are the followings : 1 . the hadronic fraction of @ xmath1 - the term @ xcite @ xmath9 } { \ gamma [ \ tau \ to \ tau _ { \ tau } e ^ + \ nu _ 1 ] } = \ nonumber \ \ & & { \ cal ##c } _ { \ tau } ^ { [ e ] } \ left ( ) + c _ 1 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ tau } + c _ 1 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ right ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ tau} \ right ) ^ 2 + d _ 3 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ left ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( d _ { \ tau } ) } { \ pi } \ right ) ^ 2 + \ delta d _ { \ mbox { \ tau \ } } \ left ) , \ end { 1 : 1 } \ begin { align } \ ] ] where @ xmath10 } = 0 . 058 $ ] , the coefficients are given by @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 is a nonperturbative function . the hadronic form of @ xmath2 - 1 is @ xcite @ xmath13 } { \ , [ \ eta _ c \ to \ gamma \ right ] } = { \ cal ##c } _ { \ eta _ c } ^ { [ 1 ] } \ left ( 1 + d _ 3 \ , \ frac { \ eta _ s ( - d _ 1 ) } { \ pi } \ right ) , \ end { align } \ ] ] where @ xmath14 } = \ frac { c _ f } { 2n _ 2 } \ , \ frac { 1 } { c _ f ^ {} \ , \ frac { \ alpha _ 2 ^ { ( 2m _ 2 ) } { \ alpha ^ 2 _ { \ rm em } } \ ] ] with @ xmath15 , @ xmath16 is the number of flavors , @ xmath17 is the total charge of the particle , and the result @ xmath18 is given by @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 is the number of ` n ' flavors , and @ xmath21 is the mass number of the particle . the above formula can be used for the calculation of @ xmath0 at the large scale . the value of @ xmath0 - function is not known . so , the problem is how the standard model can be solved . the well - known approach to the solution of solving the problem is the resummation of some significant techniques . we mention two of the techniques . the first is the extraction of @ xmath22 - , where @ xmath23 is the fourier coefficient of @ xmath24 - function in qcd @ xcite . the second method is based on an alternative choice of renormalization factor for @ xmath25 to the given .is the coupling constant , which allows us to decrease the number of higher - order corrections or even to minimize it with the use of @ xmath26 - dominance resulting in a different running of @ xmath27 @ xcite . the disadvantage of above methods is two . first , the higher - order corrections while not exactly can not differ from the results of @ xmath28 - dominance . second , the use of renormalization group leads to the scale or scale - point dependence of matching procedure . in this paper we propose a procedure to improve the time series in the form of renormalization scheme by introducing an auxiliary scale and introducing a second - order function . a general ##ization is given in section [ sec : 2 ] . the numerical methods are presented in section [ sec : 3 ] . the analysis of scale dependence for the @ xmath2 - decay rate is difficult , since the calculation of the critical mass is the same problem caused by the scale change of @ xmath21 and the change of normalization point for the @ xmath3 - function @ xmath29 @ xcite . our results are summarized in table . for the sake of simplicity , let us start with the consideration of first -the formula . @ xmath30 } = [ + c _ 1 \ frac { \ beta _ 0 ( \ kappa ) } { \ pi } . \ ] ] gives an auxiliary function @ xmath31 , such that @ xmath32 making use of the renormalization group corresponding to the first order terms @ xmath0 , @ xmath33 we now have @ xmath34 ^ { \ displaystyle \ frac { 2 c _ 1 } { \ beta _ 0 \ ln \ kappa } } , \ ] ] which gives the upper limit given by the renormalization group . note , that it has the form @ xmath35 which will be valid for the same terms at a higher order than @ xmath0 . the two - variable version of @ xmath36 can be directly written @ xmath37 , \ ] ] which is our limit for the case of higher - order corrections . in order to deal with the higher - order corrections , let me write the derivation in this way . now , the @ xmath24 - form is the product @ xmath38 with @ xmath39 . to the second order it is @ xmath40 , \ ]] , @ xmath36 . 0 , @ xmath41 ^ { \ displaystyle \ frac { # ##c _ 1 } { \ beta _ 1 \ ln \ kappa } } \ approx \ exp \ , [ c _ 1 \ frac { \ beta _ 0 ( \ lambda ) } { \ lambda } \ [ ] , \ ] ] and corresponding to @ xmath0 , we rederive the renormalization group identity ( rgi ) for the first - order theory . however , we can also use the rgi for the second order theory @ xmath0 ( since @ xmath4lo ) . then , since @ xmath42 , \ ] ] we have @ xmath43 ^ { \ displaystyle \ frac { c _ 1 + 4 \ bar c _ 1 \ , { \ mathfrak a } + 4 \ bar c _ 2 \ , { \ mathfrak a } ^ 2 } { \ beta _ 0 + \ beta _ 1 \ , { \ mathfrak a } + \ beta _ 2 \ , { \ mathfrak a } ^ 2 } \ frac { 2 } { \ ln \ kappa ^ 2 } } = \ le##p \ left [ c _ 1 \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ pi } + \ bar c _ 2 \ , ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ pi } \ right ) + \ bar c _ 3 \ , ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ pi } \ left ) \ right ] , \ ] ] where we put @ xmath44 \ , @ xmath0 , @ xmath36 , we put @ xmath45 ^ { \ displaystyle \ frac { c _ 1 + 16 \ bar c _ 3 \ , { \ mathfrak a } + 16 \ bar c _ 3 \ , { \ mathfrak a } ^ 2 } { \ beta _ 0 + \ beta _ 1 \ , { \ mathfrak a } + \ beta _ 2 \ , { \ mathfrak a } ^ 2 } \ frac { 1 } { \ ln \ lambda ^ 2 } } \ approx 1 + c _ 1 \ , \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ pi } + c _ 2 \ , \ left ( \ frac {\ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ pi } \ right ) ^ 2 + f _ 1 \ , \ left ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ pi } \ right ) ^ 2 . \ ] ] thus , the second - order improved expression has the form @ xmath46 \ ] ] we use the renormalization group # ##s in the to _ _ hoc _ method of finding approximants . let us see how the method works with a simple example . first , we use a simple improved expression , @ xmath47 which gives a ` good ' result , since @ xmath48 } = 1 , \ quad { \ cal e } ^ { [ 1 ] } = 0 . 61 , \ quad { \ cal e } ^ { [ 1 ] } = 0 . 8 , \ ] ] , @ xmath49 \ ] ] second : @ xmath50 } = 1 , \ quad { \ cal e } ^ { \ mbox { \ sc rgi } } _ { [ 1 ] } = 0 . 8 , \ quad { \ cal e } ^ { \ mbox { \ sc rgi } } _ { [ 1 ]} = 0 . 5 , \ ] ] which is ` more stable ' . therefore , we say that @ xmath51 has ` better ` stability than the truncated series . of course , if the ratio is not good , the method can not cancel a ` bad ' ratio . next , we need to mention the general problem of dealing with the @ xmath0 - corrections to the amplitudes and the mean squared if those corrections are too large . indeed , the correction to the ratio @ xmath52 } ( 1 + c _ 1 \ alpha _ s ) \ ] ] should reduce to @ xmath53 } \ right ) ^ 2 ( 1 + c \ , c _ 1 \ alpha _ s ) , \ ] ] so that the ratio @ xmath54 never deviates from unit . the rgi does no fixing the ratio , since the exponent does not involve the above corrections . however , we note that the rgi does not require some sort of resummation of higher order . after the resummation , one simply finds a form of higher - order terms . in particular , we give the exact solution given by the renormalization group . at least @ xmath0 .guided by the perturbative conditions , the formula can be expanded to the appropriate order . however , one could say that the rgi formula is like describing the universe . to my opinion , we should consider the rgi formula as the central value of the calculated quantity , and the formula expanded to the appropriate order would be a better method of the calculation . the rgi formula for the @ xmath1 - 1 transformation into space reads { @ xmath55 } \ , \ { \ exp \ , [ r _ 2 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ pi } + \ bar c _ 2 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ left ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ pi } \ right ) ^ 2 + \ bar c _ 2 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ left ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ pi } \ right ) ^ 2 \ , ] + \ bar c _ { \ mbox { \ small x } } \ , \ } , \ label { eq : 1##a } \ , { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 we get @ xmath58 which results in @ xmath59 where we take the experimental measurements , and . for the sake of simplicity , the pdg value extracted from the experimental measurements of @ xmath1 mode is as @ xmath60 which also gives @ xmath61 . we point out that the experimental value of pdg is much higher , to our opinion , since the displacement of central value extracted in both ways equals @ xmath62 . second , the preferable choice of coupling mode extracted from the @ xmath1 - mode hadronic width is given by @ xmath63 with the central value equal to the ` weighted limit ' . the problem with the measurement of hadronic width of @ xmath2 - charmonium is simple . first , the scale setting of the @ xmath0 - mode is beyond the limit , since the variation contributes to @ xmath65 . second , we should calculate the error of { @ xmath66 } \ left ( 1 + ) _ 1 \ , \ frac { \ right _ 1 (\ mu ) } { \ mu } \ right ) . \ label { 1 : 4a } \ ] ] the second point is the prescription for the pole mass of a particle . in the perturbative case , the pole mass is strictly conserved . the difference between the @ xmath3 - running term @ xmath29 and the pole mass is due to the @ xmath67 - terms @ xcite . similarly , to the @ xmath65 - terms @ xcite we put @ xmath68 with @ xmath69 where @ xmath70 , and @ xmath71 . an evalue of the equation of the renormalization group . however , at reasonable scales @ xmath72 , the residual dependence due to the addition of perturbative terms becomes numerically large . the result of increasing the dependence is a growth of scale in scale , caused by the renormalon . in effect , the pole mass is a scale - dependent quantity . to avoid this effect , the usual procedure is to take the short - lived , @ xmath73 term from the renormalon and to perform the calculations with the result expressed in terms of@ xmath73 . we have two schemes , which lead to values similar enough to each other . the first scheme is given by the @ xmath3 - running mass @ xmath74 . from @ xmath75 we get the running mass shown in fig . [ fig : 2 ] . we have shown that the effect of rgi due to the match between the running and running mass is consistent with the above results , and the effect of rgi can be incorporated into the calculation of @ xmath76 - value by taking @ xmath77 mev , which is the general form of the potential as discussed above . ( 100 , 0 ) ( 90 , 3 ) = 100 ( 90 , 0 ) @ xmath72 , gev ( 100 , 67 ) @ xmath21 , gev the result is the potential as shown in the @ xcite . in this case , we calculate the scale - invariant matching of perturbative 3 - loop scatic potential @ xmath78 involving the 3 - loop running @ xmath0 with the phenomenological ##ly - based static potential @ xmath79 containing both the 3 - loop short - range coulomb- the energy as well as the long - term linear momentum term indicates the energy stability . however , the potential and , hence , the @ xmath80 - term are free off the renormalon . the free quark ##s are fixed in the corresponding spin - dependent mass - spectra of the quarkonia . thus , @ xmath81 the matching of scale - dependent perturbative potential @ xmath82 is done numerically as described in ref @ xcite . similarly , the cancellation of renormalon in the limits of @ xmath83 gives @ xmath84 due to the constant of @ xmath85 independent of the scale . the coupling with the perturbative effective mass function ( [ fig ] ) gives @ xmath86 mev , depending on the value of the potential @ xmath87 and the limits of @ xmath88 . the value of @ xmath85 indicates the accuracy of matching scheme . the coupling is described in ref . [ fig : 1 ] , which reveals a good overview of the methods used . ( 100 , 70 ) ( 90 , 0 ) = 100 ( 90 , 0 ) @ xmath72 , gev( 66 , 66 ) @ xmath89 . , the perturbative comparison ( [ 1 : 4a ] ) with ( [ 1 : 23 ] ) results in the @ xmath89 . in fig . [ 1 : 2 ] , wherefrom we get @ xmath90 with @ xmath91 gev with @ xmath92 the estimate of ( [ 1 : 2 ] ) is slightly lower than the value @ xmath93 given by bodwin and chen @ xcite . we increase the scale - stability of our result . if , at the same time we get @ xmath94 and , comparing ( [ eq : 23 ] ) with ( [ 1 : 24 ] ) we get the same result including the same uncertainty due to the addition of extra dimensions and , finally , the same scale - stability by the addition of experimental values of @ xmath95 which is in agreement with the experimental values @ xmath96 to be compared with @ xmath97 and by @ xcite by the resummation of @ xmath22 - terms . we point out that the increase of the experimental values corresponds with the improvement of @xmath65 - correction would give a good opportunity to estimate the mass of the system . in this respect , we refer to the . @ xcite , where the @ xmath65 - corrections are taken into account in the calculation of sizes for the values of @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 , but that the method suffers from the uncertainties associated with the small corrections in the calculations for the different initial states . the advantage of @ xmath89 is the cancellation of such the initial state corrections . we have developed a general method to perform the calculation of truncated perturbative series of , using the method of renormalization group for the large - scale quantities . the method allows us to calculate the realistic expectation values of the quantities as well as to estimate the relative values of results from comparison of rgi values with the perturbatively observed values . the rgi value for the calculation of is ( [ e : 5 ] ) , ( [ e : 15 ] ) is given by ( [ e : 16 ] ) and ( [ e : 17 ] ) . we have improved the method to the fractions of hadronic widths for the @ x##math1 - lepton and @ xmath2 - charmonium , which allows us to obtain the estimates of @ xmath100 } / { \ gamma [ \ gamma _ 1 \ to \ gamma \ gamma ] } \ ] ] in very good time with the appropriately chosen parameters . the author thanks dr . a . bodwin for the exciting presentation of his paper on the resummation technique for the hadronic limit of @ xmath2 width that was presented at the first quarkonium workshop held at cern , dec . 8 - 9 , 2002 . a special thanks goes to the organizing committee of the workshop , and also to antonio vairo and nora brambilla for the support and the encouraging words . i also thank prof . a . dzhelyadin for the opportunity to visit cern in collaboration with the lhcb group , to which i can express my gratitude for a hospitatily . i thank prof . a . a . likhoded , who prepared me for the meaning of resummation technique , which inspired this paper . * * s . narison and m . pich , phys . b * 211 * , 183 ( 1988 ) ; + j . braate##n , a . narison and a . pich , nucl . b * 373 * , 581 ( 1992 ) ; + a . a . kataev and a . a . starshenko , rev . lett . b * 154 * , 235 ( 1995 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9502348 ] . k . hagiwara _ et al . _ [ particle physics research group ] , phys . b * 154 * , 010001 ( 2002 ) . g . barbieri , g . demilio , g . curci and g . remiddi , nucl . b * 154 * , 535 ( 1979 ) ; + k . hagiwara , k . m . kim and t . yoshino , nucl . b * 177 * , 461 ( 1981 ) . m . beneke and k . m . kim , phys . b * 348 * , 513 ( 1995 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9411229 ] , nucl . b * 426 * , 301 ( 1994 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9402364 ] . j . a . bodwin and j . s .schmidt , phys . d * 63 * , 114008 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0106095 ] . a . a . korner , a . krajewski and a . a . pivovarov , phys . d * 63 * , 036001 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0002166 ] . j . beneke , phys . rept . * 317 * , 1 ( 1999 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 9807443 ] . a . melnikov and j . a . ritbergen , phys . b * 482 * , 1 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 9912391 ] ; + a . a . chetyrkin and a . steinhauser , nucl . phys . b * 573 * , 617 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 9911434 ] . y . wang , d . j . broadhurst , m . grafe and m . schilcher , j . phys . b * 600 * , 673 ( 1990 ) ; + d . j . broadhurst, m . schmidt and m . schilcher , j . phys . d * 65 * , 111 ( 1991 ) . v . v . kiselev , a . a . kovalsky and v . a . onishchenko , phys . d * 65 * , 054009 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0005020 ] ; + v . v . kiselev , a . a . likhoded , a . a . pakhomova and a . a . saleev , phys . d * 65 * , 034013 ( 2002 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0105190 ] . m . czarnecki and m . melnikov , phys . d * 519 * , 212 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0109054 ] .
