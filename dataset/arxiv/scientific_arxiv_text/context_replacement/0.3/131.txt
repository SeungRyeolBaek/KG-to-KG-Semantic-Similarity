let us start with the following examples : 1 . for every differential graded algebra @ xmath1 , the hochschild cohomology @ xmath2 has a gerstenhaber algebra structure . 2 . let @ xmath3 be a compact , compact @ xmath4 - dimensional @ xmath0 - manifold , @ xmath5 be the unit loop space . then , @ xmath6 has a batalin - vilkovisky ( in fact , gerstenhaber ) algebra structure . 3 . let @ xmath7 denote the differential graded algebra of differential forms on @ xmath3 . there exists a linear algebra @ xmath8 generated by inner products of differential forms , which are the gerstenhaber algebra . \ ( a ) is originally due to gerstenhaber @ xcite . ( b ) is due to chas - sullivan @ xcite , which is the very first paper on algebraic topology . ( c ) relates the geometric construction ( b ) to the algebraic construction ( c ) . it seems that ( c ) is not well - known to us ( see also [ 150205 _ 1 ] ) . ( a ) ( b ) relates algebraic topology tohomology level , and it is an important and difficult problem to find chain level refinements of these structures . for ( a ) , so , deligne s conjecture states that a certain chain complex of the little disks operad acts on the hochschild cochain complex . many other solutions to this conjecture and its variations are known ; see @ xcite section i . 1 . 3 , @ xcite section 1 . 1 . 4 , and the references below . the aim of this paper is to propose a chain level algebra structure which lifts ( a ) ( the batalin - vilkovisky ( bv ) , ##s in string topology ) , and compare it with a solution to deligne s conjecture via a chain complex which is a chain level model of ( a ) . let us briefly consider our first problem ( see # [ 150628 _ 1 ] for the main statement ) . first of all , for a differential , oriented @ xmath0 - over @ xmath3 , we define a chain complex @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 , which is a chain model of @ xmath11 . we then define a differential , operad @ xmath12 and its suboperad@ xmath13 . these operads are chain complexes of the two big disks operad and the little disks operad , and written separately from @ xmath3 . we establish the following properties : 1 . for any differential graded algebra @ xmath1 , the hochschild complex @ xmath14 admits an action of @ xmath13 , which is the gerstenhaber action of @ xmath15 in ( c ) . 2 . for any compact , oriented @ xmath0 - algebra @ xmath3 , the chain complex @ xmath9 admits an action of @ xmath12 , and @ xmath16 has the bv - structures . there exists an intersection @ xmath17 has the bv structures . 3 . there exists a @ xmath18 - equivariant linear map @ xmath19 , such that @ xmath20 coincides the action in ( c ) . there can be many different ways to carry out chain model structures in string theory , depending on choices of chain model of the free vector space . the simplest chain model has the transversality property , because string topology operations are performed differently for chains transversal to each other .the hochschild complex of linear operators ( as e . g . , @ xcite ) avoids this trouble , however it is not always a complete chain model of the real vector space ( see remark [ 150811 _ 1 ] ) , and contains some additional properties ( e . g . , of vectors , see section 1 . 11 . 3 ) . our chain model @ xmath9 is an intermediate form of these properties . this section is organized as follows . in section 1 . 11 . 4 , we give the basic results and definitions , with various notations an ##ew . in section 1 . 5 , we give theorem [ 150628 _ 1 ] , which is our main result , and a few supplementary results . section 1 . 6 discusses previous works and 1 . 7 discusses some applications to symplectic topology . section 1 . 1 is the plan of the rest of this section . first we will discuss the notion of ( nonsymmetric ) operads . the main idea is to use conventions , and we see @ xcite section and section 1 . 2 for details . let @ xmath21 be any real monoidal space with a product @ xmath22 and a unit @ xmath23 . is _ nonsymmetricoperad _ @ xmath24 _ @ xmath21 consists of the following properties : * an integer @ xmath25 for every integer @ xmath26 . * a morphism @ xmath27 for every @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 . these morphisms are called _ ( _ ) composition _ . * a morphism @ xmath30 called a _ composition _ of @ xmath24 . we assume that compositions have associativity , and @ xmath31 is a finite - dimensional space for composition . when @ xmath25 admits a group action of the trivial group @ xmath32 ( @ xmath33 is the trivial group ) for every @ xmath26 , such that these actions are compatible with composition , @ xmath24 is called a _ operad _ of @ xmath21 . for every ( nonsymmetric ) operads @ xmath24 and @ xmath34 , a morphism of ( nonsymmetric ) operads @ xmath35 is a sequence of morphisms @ xmath36 which preserves the above properties . when @ xmath37 admits monics forall @ xmath26 , we see that @ xmath24 is a suboperad of @ xmath34 . throughout this paper , graded vector spaces are graded over @ xmath10 . a graded vector space @ xmath38 is a pair @ xmath39 of vector spaces . a differential graded ( or chain ) vector space ( or chain space ) is a pair @ xmath40 of a graded vector space @ xmath38 and @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 . we can define a graded vector space as a graded vector space with @ xmath43 . one can define the symmetric monoidal form on the category of dg vector spaces as follows : @ xmath44 the sequence @ xmath45 is defined with @ xmath46 and @ xmath43 . throughout this paper , we also work on the category of graded and differential vector spaces . operads in these categories are called _ graded operads _ and _ dg operads _ , respectively . for any graded vector space @ xmath38 and @ xmath47 , @ xmath48 has the structure of a dg vector space : @ xmath49 for anyfor _ of @ xmath38 , @ xmath50 has the notion of a dg operad defined as follows ( @ xmath51 , @ xmath52 , and @ xmath53 ) : @ xmath54 this _ operad is called the _ endomorphism operad _ of @ xmath38 . for any other operad @ xmath24 , a new @ xmath24 - algebra is a linear combination @ xmath38 with a morphism @ xmath55 of dg operads . for any @ xmath26 we have a chain map @ xmath56 for any two @ xmath24 - algebra @ xmath38 and @ xmath47 , a chain map @ xmath57 is called a morphism of the @ xmath24 - algebra if @ xmath58 for each @ xmath59 and @ xmath60 . for any other operad @ xmath24 , the notion of the @ xmath24 - algebras and their morphisms are defined in a similar way . for any other operad @ xmath61, the _ graded ideal _ of @ xmath24 is a ring @ xmath62 such that the following conditions hold : * for any @ xmath26 , @ xmath63 is a graded subcomplex of @ xmath25 , which is generated by the @ xmath32 - cycle sequence @ xmath25 . * for any @ xmath59 , @ xmath64 and @ xmath28 , @ xmath65 for any dg sequence @ xmath66 , the ring @ xmath67 has the natural structure of a graded operad , and there is a natural morphism of graded operads @ xmath68 . for any graded operad @ xmath24 , the structure of _ graded ideals and associated _ graded operads is defined in the obvious way ( see @ xcite section 13 . 2 . 2 ) . gerstenhaber and bv operads are graded operads , which play central roles in this article . we provide examples of these operads by definitions and relations , as following @ xcite sections 13 . 3 . 3 and 13 . 3 . 4 . the _ gerstenhaberoperad _ @ xmath69 is generated by @ xmath70 , @ xmath71 , @ xmath72 with the following operations : 1 . @ xmath73 . 2 . @ xmath74 . 3 . @ xmath75 . 4 . @ xmath76 , @ xmath77 . more specifically , we consider the free operad @ xmath78 ( see @ xcite ##d ##1 . 1 ) generated by @ xmath79 , @ xmath80 , @ xmath81 , and the graded algebra @ xmath82 generated by operations ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) . next , we define @ xmath83 . for any free @ xmath69 - algebra @ xmath38 , we define _ @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 and @ xmath38 . @ xmath86 on , @ xmath87 is a free algebra , graded algebra , and @ xmath88 is a graded graded algebra ( with operations generated by @ xmath89 ) . thealgebra @ xmath90 is called a _ gerstenhaber algebra _ . by the same way , the gerstenhaber algebra @ xmath38 has a unit @ xmath91 of the multiplication @ xmath84 . it follows that the existence of this unit is also always known . the _ bv operad _ @ xmath92 is generated by @ xmath93 , @ xmath94 , @ xmath95 , @ xmath96 with the relations ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and @ xmath97 . , there is a natural morphism of graded operads @ xmath98 . for any integer @ xmath92 - algebra @ xmath38 , we have an operation @ xmath99 , @ xmath38 and @ xmath100 . the algebra @ xmath101 is called a _ bv algebra _ . the algebra @ xmath85 is generated from the algebra @ xmath102 . for any integer @ xmath103 , let @ xmath104 be the set of tuples @ xmath##105 such that * for each @ xmath106 , @ xmath107 is a small point of finite radius contained in @ xmath108 . we denote its center by @ xmath109 . @ xmath110 is a point in @ xmath111 . * @ xmath112 contains points . the set @ xmath104 has a natural topology . let @ xmath113 be the space of @ xmath104 , which consists of @ xmath105 and that @ xmath114 for each @ xmath106 . we define @ xmath115 to be the space consisting of a point . thus , @ xmath116 has the topological topology of a topological operad , and @ xmath117 has a suboperad . @ xmath118 ( resp . @ xmath119 ) is called the _ _ disks _ ( resp . _ framed _ disks _ ) operad . there are examples of the operads @ xmath120 ( @ xcite ) and @ xmath121 ( @ xcite ) , which aretogether with the inclusion relation . a _ _ graded associative algebra _ is a graded vector space @ xmath1 with unit degree @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 , which is linear , and satisfy the product rule . we also assume that it has a unit @ xmath124 . we change the term ` ` differential graded linear algebra ' ' to ` ` dga algebra ' ' . here the symbol ` ` d ' ' stands for ` ` differential ' ' , as for . ( let @ xcite pp . ) @ xmath1 be any dga algebra . a dg @ xmath125 - bimodule is a dg vector space @ xmath3 with units @ xmath122 left and right @ xmath125 - actions @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 , which satisfy the product relation and associativity . for every @ xmath128 and @ xmath129 , we define a chain map @ xmath130 . @ xmath131 we define @ xmath##132 define @ xmath133 , and define the hochschild cochain of @ xmath134 and @ xmath135 . note that @ xmath136 _ has _ the structure of @ xmath89 . the cohomology of this complex is defined as @ xmath137 , and define the _ hochschild cohomology _ . notice that @ xmath1 itself has the natural structure of a dg @ xmath125 - bimodule . @ xmath138 has both dga and dg - structure ##s , with the @ xmath139 and @ xmath85 listed below . the bracket @ xmath139 is defined as @ xmath140 the bracket @ xmath141 is defined as @ xmath142 where @ xmath143 is defined as @ xmath144 the product @ xmath139 and @ xmath141 define the gerstenhaber bracket of @ xmath2 . this construction is probably due to gerstenhaber @ xcite . in this case , we have @ xmath145 . the @ xmat##h3 is a compact , oriented @ xmath0 - manifold of dimension @ xmath4 . @ xmath5 is equipped with the @ xmath0 - topology . we often write @ xmath146 and @ xmath147 . however , we also use the notation @ xmath148 . in @ xcite , chas - simon introduced the _ _ product _ on @ xmath149 . let us briefly explain its definition . let us define the evalutation map @ xmath150 , and the loop map @ xmath151 let @ xmath152 be a closed subset of @ xmath153 , and @ xmath154 is the thom isomorphism . the gysin map @ xmath155 is defined as the product of the following maps : @ xmath156 and @ xmath157 is the identity map . formally , it is defined as follows ( see the section at pp . 780 @ xcite ) . let us define an [ @ xmath158 - function @ xmath159 \ to [ 0 , 1 ] $ ] such that @ xmath16##0 and @ xmath161 ( @ xmath162 is the @ xmath163 - 1 product ) for example @ xmath164 . if , @ xmath157 is replaced by @ xmath165 it is easy to see that @ xmath166 does not depend on values of @ xmath167 . the loop in @ xmath168 is defined as the product of the following two maps . the first map is the cross product and the second map is the gysin product . @ xmath169 ^ - { \ , } & h _ { * + 1 } ( \ , ^ { \ , e } ) \ ar [ r ] & \ h _ * ( \ l { \ , _ { e } \ ! \ ! \ times _ { e } } \ l ) \ ar [ r ] ^ - { \ , _ * ( r ) } & \ , _ * ( \ l ) . } \ ] ] let us define the product @ xmath170 . let @ xmath171 be the cross product . then , @ xmath172 on the other hand , @ xmath147 is a double@ xmath173 - action @ xmath174 , which is defined by @ xmath175 . we have @ xmath176 [ @ xmath177 \ times x ) $ ] , where @ xmath178 \ times x _ [ ( s ^ 1 ) $ ] is defined by the [ action @ xmath179 $ ] ( see the following section for the definition of @ xmath180 ) . [ th : ch - su ] for any n , in @ xmath4 - action @ xmath158 - action @ xmath3 , @ xmath181 is a bv algebra . this algebra is the starting point of loop topology . the bracket @ xmath85 of this bv algebra is called the _ loop _ _ . there is a relation between gerstenhaber structures , loop topology homology ( theorem [ th : ch - su ] ) and hochschild cohomology ( theorem 2 . 2 ) . we obtain this relation via the integral of differential forms , which appear in @ xcite . to discuss iterated integral of differential forms , it is convenient to start with @ xmath0- singular chain of @ xmath146 . let us denote the @ xmath182 - dimensional space @ xmath183 by @ xmath184 . then @ xmath185 is said to be of class @ xmath0 , if there is an open neighborhood @ xmath152 of @ xmath186 and a neighborhood @ xmath187 , such that @ xmath188 , and @ xmath189 is of class @ xmath0 . let @ xmath190 denote the @ xmath10 - dimensional space generated by the @ xmath0 - maps @ xmath191 . it is easy to see that , the @ xmath0 - map @ xmath192 is continuous with respect to the @ xmath0 - map of @ xmath146 . therefore , @ xmath193 is a subcomplex of the singular chain space of @ xmath146 . in figure 2 , we see that this continuous map is a self - isomorphism ( see [ 150219 _ 1 ] ) . hence , @ xmath194 . for any @ xmath##195 , let us define @ xmath196 . , @ xmath197 is a dga map , where @ xmath4 denotes the exterior derivative , and @ xmath198 denotes the interior derivative . we denote it by @ xmath7 . we define a new @ xmath199 - bimodule based on @ xmath200 _ * : = \ hom ( { { \ mathcal { d } } } ^ { * + 1 } ( x ) , \ alpha ) $ ] as follows : @ xmath201 - morphism of @ xmath7 - bimodules @ xmath202 ; \ , \ , \ mapsto ( \ alpha \ mapsto \ int _ { \ , \ wedge \ } ) $ ] is the cross - product ( this is an immediate consequence of the poincar theorem ) . for each @ xmath0 - [ @ xmath203 and @ xmath129 , we denote @ xmath204 , @ xmath205 and ( @ xmath206 ) $ ] by @ xmath207 it is easy to see that @xmath208 ) ; \ , \ , \ mapsto ( x _ { ( \ sigma ) ) _ [ \ ] ] is a linear map ( these are discussed in section 2 . 2 ) . for this , we have a ( @ xmath209 ) \ cong . ^ * ( { { \ mathcal { a } } } _ m , { { \ mathcal { b } } } _ n ) . \ ] ] this also preserves the gerstenhaber structures of @ xmath210 and @ xmath211 . [ 150205 _ 01 ] the fact that ( [ 141218 _ 01 ] ) preserves the gerstenhaber structure has to be proved ; see @ xcite for the chain , and @ xcite _ 1 for the bracket . we can see this result as a combination of remark [ 150628 _ 1 ] , and remark [ 150703 _ 1 ] . we state our main result theorem [ 150628 _ 1 ] and some other results . let us use the notations : @ xmath69 and @ xmath92 are the gerstenhaber and bv operads . for an @ xmath0 - 1 @ x##math3 of ##s @ xmath4 , @ xmath5 , and @ xmath212 . @ xmath7 is the dga algebra of linear forms of @ xmath3 . [ 150628 _ 2 ] there exists a graded operad @ xmath12 and a suboperad @ xmath13 , with the following properties . 1 . there exist pairs of graded operads @ xmath213 and @ xmath214 , such that the following property holds : @ xmath215 \ ar [ d ] _ - { \ cong } & f _ * ( \ \ \ { \ lambda } ) \ ar [ d ] ^ - { \ cong } \ \ \ ger \ ar [ d ] & \ batvil . } \ ] ] 2 . for any dga algebra @ xmath1 , the hochschild algebra @ xmath138 has a dg @ xmath13 - algebra structure , which is the gerstenhaber algebra of @ xmath2 . 3 . for any compact , connected @ xmath0 - algebra @ xmath3 , there exists : * * * @ x##math12 - algebra @ xmath9 . * an element @ xmath216 of bv ##2 . * a morphism of the @ xmath13 - algebras @ xmath19 shows that @ xmath20 is equivalent to the map ( [ 141218 _ 01 ] ) . [ 150212 _ 1 ] it follows that ( although there are some additional details the author has not provided ) the following modified version of ( ii ) is also true : there is a hi - set of quiasi - chains ( of n operads ) of @ xmath13 ( resp . @ xmath12 ) and @ xmath217 ( resp . @ xmath218 ) , which is the first n operad of @ xmath118 ( resp . @ xmath119 ) . [ 150703 _ 1 ] since @ xmath219 is a member of the @ xmath13 - algebra , and @ xmath214 , ( iii ) - ( iv ) shows that the map ( [ 141218 _ 01 ] ) preserves the gerstenhaber identity . [ 1508##11 _ 01 ] . ( iii ) - ( iv ) suggests , the hilbert complex @ xmath9 is the ` ` ' analogue ' ' of the hochschild complex @ xmath220 . the important fact is that the map @ xmath221 stands for the closed form @ xmath3 , while we need some notation ( e . g . @ xmath222 ) to prove that the map ( [ 141218 _ 01 ] ) is an isomorphism . as the above proposition implies , one can define the maps loop product and bracket product @ xmath9 . [ 150801 _ 1 ] the loop product @ xmath84 and the loop bracket @ xmath85 on @ xmath223 correspond to operators on @ xmath9 , denoted by the same symbol . @ xmath84 defines a dga algebra structure , @ xmath85 defines a compact lie algebra structure on @ xmath9 , and the chain map @ xmath224 maps these together . moreover , there exists an injective chain map @ xmath225 such that @ xmath226 and the following map satisfy : @ xmath##227 ^ - { \ h _ * ( i _ m ) } \ ar [ r ] _ { \ cong } & \ h _ * ( { { \ mathcal { l } } } } ) \ ar [ d ] ^ { \ cong } \ \ d ^ { - * } _ \ dr ( m ) \ ar [ r ] _ { i _ * ( \ h _ m ) } & h _ * ( d ^ { { { \ mathcal { l } } } m } ) . } \ ] ] as a result , one can define @ xmath228 - algebra of the tensor algebra . similarly , using the homotopy equivalence property ( see section 2 . 2 @ xcite ) , one can define an @ xmath228 - algebra @ xmath229 and @ xmath223 , so that @ xmath230 , @ xmath231 and @ xmath232 are homotopy equivalent to the dga algebra @ xmath233 . alternatively , we can define @ xmath229 so that @ xmath234 for a @ xmath128 , and @ xmath235 are homotop##y refers to the dga of @ xmath236 . in particular , @ xmath229 preserves the classical massey product of @ xmath237 . using same arguments , we can define an @ xmath238 - structure @ xmath239 on @ xmath223 , so that @ xmath240 , @ xmath241 , and @ xmath242 are homotopy equivalent to the classical lie algebra @ xmath243 . alternatively , we may define @ xmath239 so that @ xmath244 for any @ xmath128 . when @ xmath3 has a string metric , @ xmath223 is associated with the length of , and it is only in @ xcite that the massey product preserves this metric . one of features of our chain model @ xmath9 is that , one can define the length of in this chain model so that the length is given by the metric on . for any @ xmath245 , let us define @ xmath246 . for any @ xmath247 $ ] , we define @ x##math248 . in mathematics , a map ( indexed by @ xmath249 $ ] ) on the chain complex @ xmath250 is a [ @ xmath251 } $ ] of subcomplexes of @ xmath250 , such that @ xmath252 . for any @ xmath253 , we have @ xmath254 . [ 141005 _ 1 ] let @ xmath3 be a smooth , compact riemannian manifold . then , the chain complex @ xmath9 has a [ @ xmath255 } $ ] such that the following conditions hold : 1 . there exists an index @ xmath256 for any @ xmath247 $ ] , such that the following condition is valid for any @ xmath257 , where the elements are given by inclusions : @ xmath258 ^ - { \ cong } \ ar [ d ] & h _ * ( d ^ b d ^ { { { \ mathcal { d } } } \ } ) \ ar [ d ] \ \ \ h _ * ( \ ab ^ b d ) \ ar [ d ] ^- { \ cong } & h _ * ( h ^ { h ^ { { { \ mathcal { l } } } m } ) . } \ ] ] 2 . the @ xmath259 - like structure on @ xmath9 is the filtration . however , @ xmath260 rich algebraic structures for high level algebraic topology were outlined in @ xcite by d . sullivan , and there have been several papers working on details . x . sullivan @ xcite constructed a chain model of the free loop space using whitney differential equations , and defined the string theory operations ( the inner product , lie bracket and rotation ) on that chain model , including the bv - like structure at homology level ( @ xcite also defined the @ xmath173 - equivariant structure ) . it is not clear whether these operations correspond to actions of a single operad on this chain model . on the other hand , a recent paper @ xcite by g . drummond - smith , k . poirier and n . smith proposed a more geometric structure with short geodesic classes and long equivalence classes . @ xcite defined operations on the singular chain complex of the free loop space , recovering the homology level structure .see cohen - godin @ xcite . in particular , @ xcite covers functions with finite genus and those corresponding to functions of finite genus . however , the structures of @ xcite are defined only up to homotopy , and it appears that the full algebraic structure has yet to be fully worked out . let us discuss some potential applications of results from this paper to symplectic geometry . for the @ xmath0 - module @ xmath3 , the cotangent space @ xmath261 has the natural sympelctic structure . when @ xmath3 is flat , compact and spin , the floer ring @ xmath262 has a bv algebra structure , and there exists an isomorphism of bv algebras @ xmath263 ( see @ xcite and the references below ) . there should be chain level refinements of this correspondence , and we expect that our chain level results in string theory fit into this correspondence . more precisely , we expect that one can define the @ xmath228 ( resp . @ xmath238 ) structure on @ xmath262 via counting solutions of appropriate floer equations , which are homotopyrefer to the @ xmath228 ( resp . @ xmath238 ) refinement of the loop product ( resp . . ) of @ xmath223 , in section 1 . 1 . 2 . on the other hand , fukaya @ xcite defined chain level loop bracket for compactifications of the moduli spaces of pseudo - holomorphic functions with lagrangian boundary conditions , and obtained results on topological properties of lagrangian submanifolds . we expect that our definition of chain level loop bracket could be used to work out details of this problem . also , there is a very interesting paper by cieliebak - latschev @ xcite , which compares symplectic group theory of sphere cotangent groups and string topology of @ xmath173 - equivariant chains and free loops modulo # ##s . we expect that the results of this paper could be a first step towards working out details of the string topology side of this problem . the content of this paper is divided into two parts . the aim of the first part ( sections 26 ) is to define the chain complex @ xmath9 . this is a chain complex of the free loop space @ x##math11 , carefully designed to develop string topology based on it . our construction of the chain complex @ xmath9 is based on two ideas . the first idea is to define a notion of _ de rham chains _ , which is a natural combination of linear chains and linear operators . we also need a notion of _ topological spaces _ , on which de rham chains are defined . these notions are introduced in section 2 . we also define de rham chain complex ( the chain complex which consists of de rham chains ) for any topological space . an important idea in our construction is to show that existence of the de rham chain complex is naturally equivalent to the usual definition ##ity . we prove this for finite - dimensional manifolds in section 3 , and for the unit vector space in section 4 . the second idea is to define ( moore ) loops with marked points , which is inspired by the theory of path integrals . in section 5 , we introduce a notion of moore loops with marked points , and show that the set of de rham chain complexes of these loops has a unique structure of a dg operad . moreover , this dg operad is unique and has a multiplication and a division . based on results in section 6, we define the chain complex @ xmath9 in section 1 . we also use results stated in section 1 . , assuming theorem [ 150624 _ 8 ] , which is a fundamental mathematical result on operads . the second section ( sections 711 ) is devoted to the proof of theorem [ 150624 _ 8 ] . * * . * the author appreciates both k . fukaya and k . wang for their encouragements and comments on this paper . he also thanks j . ward for his communications , and the anonymous referee for his comments on the preliminary version of this paper . this paper is covered by jsps kakenhi patent # 25800041 . in this section , we introduce notions of _ differentiable _ _ and _ de rham chain complexes _ , which are defined for the arguments of this paper . the notion of metric spaces is introduced in section 2 . 2 . , and de rham chain complexes for these spaces are introduced in section 2 . 3 . the remainder of this section ( 2 . 2 . 4 ) is devoted to establishing several fundamental results for de rham chain complexes of these spaces . dimension @ xmath264 be defined @ xmath4 -
