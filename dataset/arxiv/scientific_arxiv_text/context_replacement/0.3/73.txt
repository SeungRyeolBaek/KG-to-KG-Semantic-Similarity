both the star formation rate and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity have been shown to reach their peak at @ xmath32 @ xcite . in the early universe , a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) generically exists at the center of s - type galaxies with the black hole mass tightly correlating with that of the ' s ' bulge @ xcite . the merger and co - evolution between the central smbh and the galaxy have therefore been suggested @ xcite . in one of the most popular co - evolution scenarios , massive collisions have been proposed to bring gas into the center of galaxies , leading to a massive starburst and the formation of a smbh @ xcite . a promising approach to understanding the collision - driven co - evolution scenario is to study the merger features of agn host galaxies . however , recent studies have shown mixed results . on one hand , the two moderate - luminosity x - ray selected agn hosts ( @ xmath4erg s @ xmath5 ) have similar disk - dominated morphologies to those of red - dwarf galaxies , with no significant difference in the distortion ##s , both at @ xmath6 @ xcite and at @ xmath7 @ xcite .on the other hand , the high merger fraction ( @ xmath8 ) has been found in a subsample of the bright ( @ xmath9erg s @ xmath5 ) , dust - reddened quasars @ xcite . this may lead to an explanation that merger fraction is dependent on agn structure properties @ xcite . there are also theoretical studies suggesting that galaxy clusters may produce the agn activity while other internal processes may be involved in generating the agns @ xcite . therefore , it is crucial to understand the connection between the most luminous agns and merger fraction . however , detailed theoretical studies of the most luminous agns ( @ xmath9erg s @ xmath5 ) and @ xmath7 are rare in the literature . for the luminous cluster agns , these results have been confirmed by the bright galaxy survey , especially with the recent treatment of point source substraction @ xcite . the present state of deep and distant surveys has biased against the luminous x - ray selected agns . the s _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ nasa _ ; wright et al . 2010 ) all - sky survey provided an opportunity to study the most luminous galaxies atnear - infrared wavelengths . @ xcite and @ xcite discovered a new population of hyperluminous , highly dust - obscured objects ( thereafter hot dogs ) using the so - called ` ` w1w2 ##e ' ' spectroscopy technique . follow - up studies have revealed several key characteristics of this population : ( 1 ) spectroscopic follow - up studies show that they are mostly high - redshift objects , with magnitude ##s from 1 to 4 @ xcite . ( 2 ) most of hot dogs are extremely consistent with @ xmath10 @ xcite . ( 3 ) using x - ray observations @ xcite and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) measurements ( assef et al . 2015a ; fan et al . 2016a ) , clear evidence has been shown that their luminous mid - ir population is dominated by a highly dust - obscured , hot compton - type agn . due to the high obscuration of circumnuclear dust , the host morphology of this population is easily observable . these hot dogs are ideal objects for us to investigate the merger fraction in the most distant agns . in this article , we describe the host morphology of 18 hot dogs , which are _ hubble space telescope ( hst )_ wide - field telescope 3 ( wfc3 ) near - ir high - resolution imaging . our target is to obtain some information about the merger fraction in the most luminous agns . for this purpose we use a flat @ xmath11cdm model with @ xmath12 km , @ xmath5 , @ xmath13 , and @ xmath14 . the hot dogs presented here are taken from the _ large _ all - sky source catalog @ xcite . in order to investigate the host morphology of hot dogs , we compare a subsample of our sources ( figure 1 ) with the _ hst _ wfc3 images . we also require that they have matched the redshift in the catalog @ xcite for calculating their bolometric parameters . to investigate the host morphology of hot dogs , we use the high resolution _ hst _ wfc3 near - ir imaging . we search our sources and retrieve the best images from them . observations come from four _ hst telescopes with catalogue d 12488 ( pi : a . negrello ) , 12585 ( pi : c . smith ) , 12481 and 12930 ( pi : c . smith ) .we list hst i - d for this sample in table 1 . all but one ( w0831 + 0140 ) use the _ f160w _ ( @ xmath15 - band ) imaging . the w0831 + 0140 uses the _ f110w _ imaging . the wfc3 imaging has a resolution scale of 1 . 5 arcsec / mÂ² . . the sample of hot dog [ tbl - band ] [ n = " < , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] we find a high merger fraction ( @ xmath1 ) in the hot dog sample , using the spectral analysis described in section 1 . given the high agn bolometric properties ( @ xmath16 ) in the hot dog sample , this finding is very clear , that the highly luminous agns have likely been related to diamond formation . in order to determine the effect of merger fraction on agn spectral properties , we gather the samples in the literature and show them in table 2 . the samples are taken from the sample of @ xcite . green and purple diamonds , which are the regions of intermediate ##s @ xmath6 and s @ xmath7 , respectively, is taken from the recent study @ xcite . our prediction for the red dog sample has been interpreted as an error . among the other samples , our sample is the second brightest , which has the peak brightness slightly lower than that of the dust - reddened qso observed at @ xcite . the observed trend can be found in figure 2 that the merger fraction increases with agn star activity at peak luminosity , while the merger fraction shows a strong dependence on agn bolometric luminosity for the most luminous agns . we compare the observed trend with the variability - based model of @ xcite ( red and blue lines in figure 2 ) . red and blue lines match the predictions of @ xcite prediction at @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 , respectively . the merger fraction of our sample compares well with the trend found at @ xmath7 . in other samples at @ xmath7 of mid - ir luminous qsos ( red dog , del rio et al . 2016 ) , dust - dominated agns ( red triangle , lanzuisi et al . 2015 ) and dust - thick qsos ( red point , glikman et al .2015 ) , the two models also show a good relationship with the original data . as shown by @ xcite , secondary mergers , especially major merger , may play the most important role in triggering the highly modified agns at @ xmath7 . in figure 3 , we show the distribution of srsic ##s in our hot dog sample . the distribution peaks at @ xmath19 , ranging from disk - dominated ( @ xmath20 ) , disk with a large bulge , ( 0 . 5 @ xmath21n @ xmath213 . 0 ) to bulge - dominated ( @ xmath22 ) . the frequencies of disk - dominated , intermediate and bulge - dominated distributions are 61 . 2 % , 61 . 1 % and 61 . 3 % , respectively , in our hot dog sample . we inform the reader that a single srsic model wo nt provide a good model for very heavily modified hot dogs . for example , both w0851 + 3148 and w2207 + 1939 have large optical distortions ( see figure 3 ) and the likelihood of a single srsic model fitting to a large sample of the reduced @ xmath23 ( > 5 ) . however , for most of our hot dogs ,the single srsic model also provides a reasonable estimate . conservatively speaking , the srsic profile with @ xmath24 can describe the distribution of galaxy clusters in hot dogs . our classification suggests that most of our hot dogs have an intermediate morphology ( disk with a small bulge component ) . the intermediate morphology of hot dogs has been observed in the disk - driven scenario if hot dogs lie in the transient stage when large mergers with gas - rich disks are building galaxy clusters . this visual classification provides an important check on the reliability of our visual classification . the @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 parameters of our hot dogs range from 0 . 47 to 0 . 60 with a median of 0 . 60 , and from @ xmath27 to @ xmath28 with a median value of @ xmath29 , respectively . we use the @ xmath30 parameter to predict major mergers in the merger model of lotz et al . 13 out of 19 hot dogs have the parameter @ xmath31 , indicating them major mergers . the total merger fraction ( @ xmath3272 % ) given above is also consistent with the reliability of our visual classification . in this letter , we use the high resolution _ hst _ wfc3 _- ir attempts to estimate the merger fraction of a subsample of 18 hot dogs by stellar mass . we find that the merger fraction is high ( @ xmath1 ) for our hot dog sample . the high merger fraction of these highly luminous , heavily - obscured agns is consistent with the predictions of hydrodynamical models @ xcite and the variability - driven model @ xcite . we also estimate the agn bolometric luminosity by using ir seds models . the heavily obscured agns in hot dogs are among the most luminous agns in the universe ( @ xmath2 ) . the visible radio emissions in hot dogs are also high ( see figure 2 ) , indicating that there resides a starburst in the hosts . both the agn and starburst activities are likely driven by radiation as indicated by the high merger fraction . however , the lack of a comparison sample may undermine the merger - fraction model of hot dogs . furthermore , it is difficult to find a suitable comparison sample , as both the stellar mass and black hole mass of hot dogs are not well known . the stellar mass upper bounds of hot dogs derived from sed modeling by @ xcite are about @ xmath33 . massive and variable galaxies at @ x##math34 show a very low number of minor merger morphologies . for instance , only @ xmath35 galaxies in the inactive galaxy sample with the median solar mass @ xmath36 show high merger fraction @ xcite . this indirect evidence suggests that the high merger fraction of our hot dog sample is partly responsible for all the observed agn variations . according to examining the surface brightness data , we find that the number of srsic ##s of hot dogs peaks at 10 , which suggests that samples of hot dogs have multiple morphologies . from the point of view of morphology , this data supports our previous result ( smith et al . 2016a ) , which suggests that hot dogs may undergo a transit phase during the evolution of the galaxies , moving from the dusty starburst ##ing phase to the more active qso phase . we can find that all samples with high merger fraction are dust - rich @ xcite and / or ir - rich ( this work ) in figure 2 . as for the blue , luminous qsos , no high merger fraction and no enhancing merger fraction has been found . for instance , @ xcite recently studied an ir / optical - selected @ xmath37 qso sample with a super - massive black hole abundance ( @ xmat##h38 ) , which are related to the high smbh masses of hot stars @ xcite . they found that the strong merger fraction for qso galaxies was low and comparable to that of inactive galaxies . they therefore concluded that galaxy mergers are not the main driving mechanism for agn activity . the results between us look promising . however , the problem can be avoided if assuming that radio / optical - selected qsos and ir - luminous obscured qsos represent different phases in the merger - driven evolutionary sequence @ xcite . in the merger - driven evolutionary model , gas - rich galaxy mergers have an intense starburst and initial phase of obscured hot stars , followed by an unobscured phase after the gas is consumed or ejected from the galaxy by qso hosts . dusty starburst like smgs and hot stars may represent the early stage of the mergers . they are expected to have a high merger fraction , which has already been determined ( e . g . , bussmann et al . ir - luminous agns are at an intermediate stage of the merger . ) the strong merger features still present in their host galaxies . as a result , the high merger fraction can be derived according to the model . while for unobscured qsos whose nuclei are expected to be largely ellipticalgalaxies , they are at a late stage of mergers , just before the smaller galaxies evolve into large elliptical galaxies . we note that the high brightness and obscuration should be used for determining the high mass clusters in agn hosts . we note that this model is only valid for radio - loud agns . there may be another possibility for radio - loud agns @ xcite . a similar merger sequence has also been proposed by @ xcite involving x - ray obscured agn , radio selected bright agn , red - bright quasars and unobscured agn ( see their links below ) . we thank the referee for the careful work and the valuable information that is improving our paper . this paper is supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( nsfc , no . 11203023 , 11303084 , 11303002 and 11433005 ) , the fundamental research projects for the central china ( wk3440000001 ) . it acknowledges the support from qilu university research group of shandong university . yh thanks the support from the beijing light source group . gf acknowledges the support by the beijing university fundamental research projects ( 2014fb155 ) . wang , r . g . , tanvir, j . s . , wang , h . h . , et al . 1996 , , 279 , l47 alexander , d . j . , & hickox , j . r . 2012 , newar , p , & assef , r . j . , eisenhardt , j . a . m . , smith , m . , et al . 2015 , , 804 , 147 assef , r . j . , alexander , d . j . , brightman , m . , et al . 2015 , arxiv : 1511 . 05155 norman , m . a . , & smith , d . j . 2015 , , 1 , 25 bussmann , r . j . , dey , m . , lotz , j . , et al . 2011 , , 733 , 27 chiaberge , m . , gilli , m . , lotz , j . s . , & alexander , j . 2015 , , 806 , 147 norman , m . , jahnke , m . , inskip , r . j . , et al . 2011 , , 726 , 147 cutri , m . a . , & et al . 2013 , , online online version , 2328, & del ##any , m . , anderson , j . r . , bauer , m . j . , et al . 2016 , , 456 , 2105 alexander , d . r . , & ballantyne , j . a . 2012 , , 751 , 173 eisenhardt , m . j . a . , anderson , j . , tsai , s . -
