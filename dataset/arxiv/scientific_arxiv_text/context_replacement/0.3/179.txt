turbulence is a fundamental part of the dynamics of complex fluids , especially those of interstellar medium ( im ) , clusters of galaxies and circumstellar disks . the introduction of the concept of turbulence induces fundamental changes , for instance , in the paradigm of ism . it became clear , for example , that turbulence involves the star formation , formation of galaxies , transfer of heat . observationally it is known that the flow is turbulent at scales ranging from aus to kpc ( see smith et al 1995 , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) , with an embedded magnetic field that influences almost all of its fluctuations . the set of statistical measures that can characterize turbulence is not a simple one ( see discussion in lazarian 1999 and c . 2001 ) . one of the most widely used measures is the turbulence distribution , which describes the distribution of turbulence fluctuations across scales . for instance , the famous kolmogorov model of incompressible turbulence assumes that the difference in turbulence at different scales in the flow occurs on scales with the separation between scales as a cubic root of the scale , i . e . @ xmath0 . in terms of direction - dependent energy spectrum this gives the famous kolmogorov scaling@ xmath1 , where @ xmath2 is a _ _ _ _ function defined as the fourier transform of the correlation function of velocity , @ xmath3 . note that in this article we use @ xmath4 to denote averaging spectrum . quantitative measurements of turbulence , in particular , averaging spectrum , became possible recently also due to developments in the theory of mhd turbulence . as we know , molecular clouds are unstable , which makes one think that the correspondence should exist between the turbulence and mhd aspects of the system ( see vazquez - semadeni et al . 2000 , van low & klessen 2004 , bellesteros - paredes et al . 2007 , mckee & ostriker 2007 and fig . 1 ) . in fact , without further testing , the application of theory of mhd turbulence to astrophysics could always be difficult . however , from the point of view of statistical mechanics astrophysical turbulence is characterized by huge reynolds number , @ xmath5 , which is the exact ratio of the eddy current velocity of a parcel of gas to the velocity required for viscous forces to slow it down . for @ xmath6 we expect gas to be turbulent and this is exactly what weobserve @ hi ( for example @ xmath7 ) . in fact , the complex astrophysical @ xmath5 and its numerical counterpart , the number @ xmath8 ( that can be as complex as @ xmath9 ) present a great challenge for numerical simulations that can not possibly be even close to the astrophysically - relevant numbers . the only available numerical simulations can have @ xmath5 and @ xmath8 up to @ xmath10 . both scale as the size of the box to the first power , and the computational complexity scales to the second power ( spatial space + time ) , so the brute force approach can not begin to resolve the problems related , for example , to ocean turbulence . we expect that observational studies of the turbulence spectra will provide new insights into particle physics . as in the case of the more complex oceanic ( or incompressible ) turbulence , observation of turbulence allowed to identify meaningful energy injection ##s . in interstellar , intra - galactic medium , in addition to that , we want to find variations of the turbulence spectrum arising from the variation of the degree of compressibility , density , mass of the charged particles etc . how to get the turbulence spectra from observations is a matter ofis long ago . while density measurements are now available through the interstellar scincillations and studies of column ##ar maps , the more detailed velocity measurements have been difficult to obtain reliably until relatively recently . turbulence is associated with high temperatures that cause fluctuations in the doppler shift of emission and absorption lines . they provide integrals of the emissivities or opacities , both proportional to the relative densities , for each velocity along the line of observation . it is far from easy to determine the velocity of the underlying turbulence from the observed absorption lines . measures of turbulence ( brown 1958 ) have become an accepted method of studying turbulence , although it is not clear to when and to what extent the measure actually measures the velocity . several studies ( lazarian & esquivel 2003 , henceforth le03 , esquivel & lazarian 2005 , ossenkopf et al 2006 , esquivel et al . 2007 ) have shown that the values are not a valid measure for molecular turbulence , which means that while the results obtained for hii regions ( odell & castaneda 1987 ) are generally valid , those for molecular clouds are not . an important step in the description of the relation between thedescription of the turbulence and the possible effects of fluctuations of spectral intensity was obtained by lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 , henceforth lp00 ) . this description gave rise to two new techniques , which were later named turbulence channel analysis ( vca ) and velocity coordinate analysis ( vcs ) . the techniques offer two ways of treating observational data as pressure - pressure - velocity ( ppv ) data cubes . the vca is based on the analysis of channel maps , which are the velocity coordinates of ppv cubes , the vcs analyses fluctuations along the velocity coordinate . if the techniques have been used earlier for turbulence models , although the relationship between the spectrum of intensity fluctuations in the channel map and the underlying velocity spectrum is unknown , the analysis of the fluctuations along the velocity coordinate was enhanced by the advent of the vcs technique . with the vca and the vcs one can compare both observations and predictions to _ _ theory _ . for example , the turbulent turbulence models are very informative , e . g . , indices steeper than the kolmogorov index of @ xmath11 are expected to reflect formation of shocks , while shallower indices can reflect scale - dependent suppression of shocks ( gberesnyak & lazarian 2006 and ref . therein ) . by comparing the values of the index with different types of ism , e . g . with high or low vortex formation , one can get an important insight in the physical nature of the turbulence , its origin , evolution and dynamics . the absorption of the electromagnetic field is a concern of the theoretical study of turbulence from the very start of the research in the field ( see discussion in brown 1999 ) . a detailed study of the nature of the absorption was done for the vca in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2004 , henceforth lp04 ) and for the vcs in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2006 , henceforth lp06 ) . in lp06 it was shown that absorption lines themselves can be used to study turbulence . indeed , the vcs is a simple technique that does not require a wide coverage to study fluctuations . therefore , the sources of the absorbing medium can be used to get the underlying turbulence spectra . however , lp06 covers only the linear regime of turbulence , i . e . when the absorption lines are not linear . this substantially limits the applicability of the technique . for example , for some casesand for absorption lines , e . g . mg ii , sii , siii the velocity spectra show up . this means that a lot of the wealth of the unique spectra obtained e . g . by hst and other methods can only be handled with the lp06 technique . the goal of this paper is to overcome this situation . in fact , in what follows , we provide a theoretical framework that allows to relate the properties of the absorption line spectrum and the underlying velocity spectra in the turbulence regime . below , in 2 we present the setting of the problems we address , while our main results are in 3 . the discussion of the general principles of turbulence study is provided in 4 , while the summary is in 5 . while all our earlier papers ( lp00 , lp04 , lp06 ) concentrated on emission lines , in particular radio emission lines , e . g . co and co , absorption lines provide the researchers with well defined advantages . for example , they prefer to test turbulence with a pencil beam , differing only from phase and frequency dependence . in fact , studies of absorption lines in the spectra of galaxies have been useful in studying the gross features of gas kinematics in this way . recent advances in sensitivity and spatial resolution of spectrographs allowstudies of turbulent motions . among the available methods , vcs is the only one to be used with extended spectra . however , it is only with extended sources that the either centroid or vca studies are possible . at the same time , vcs makes use not of the spatial , but temporal resolution . however , potentially , more studies are possible if absorption along a single line is considered . in reality , information along a few lines of sight , as is shown in fig 1 is needed to increase the spatial accuracy of the measured spectrum . with the same data sets chepurnov & lazarian ( 2006ab ) have established that the maximum number of lines ranges from 5 to 10 . for weak absorption , the absorption and emission lines can be analyzed in the same way , namely , the way suggested in lp06 . for this case , the problem to analyse is the squared fourier transform of the doppler - width spectral line , irrespectively of the fact whether this is an emission or an absorption spectral line . such a ` ` spectrum of light ' ' is only applicable for weak absorption lines , which spectrum is only affected by the doppler effect . it is assumed ( see spitzer 1978 ) that this spectrum corresponds to the optical depth @xmath12 ranging from 10 to @ xmath13 . the present paper will concentrate on this regime rather than @ xmath14 the intrinsic width is determined by atomic constants and therefore it does not provide information about turbulence . ] . consider the equation in a more general way . width of the absorption line at frequency @ xmath15 is defined as @ xmath16 where @ xmath17 is the optical depth . in the case of vanishing the width of the line @ xmath18 , the frequency width of @ xmath19 is determined only by the phase shift of the absorption line from the atoms . the number number of atoms in the line of sight moving at required velocity @ xmath20 is @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 is the mean velocity centered at that point @ xmath23 is the local mean velocity that is determined by the combination of turbulent and turbulent flow at that point . this is the type of ppv coordinate that we use in lp00 , namely @ xmath24 . the intrinsic line width is accounted for by the equation @ xmath25 and , in more detail , @ xmath26 with the profile given by the lorenz form@ xmath27 , the inner line is the full voigt profile @ xmath28 so we get it . @ xmath29 we clearly see from fig . ( [ 1 : tau _ h ] ) that the absorption is affected both by phase shifts and coupling ##s . the optical depth as a function of frequency - fluctuating fluctuations arising from gas flow and associated density fluctuations of the absorbers . statistics of optical depth fluctuations along the line of sight also carries information about turbulence in space . the optical depth is determined by the density of the gas in the ppv space , @ xmath30 . in our previous work we have studied statistical properties of @ xmath30 in the context of absorption lines , using both wave function and absorption spectrum formalisms . absorption lines demonstrate two important properties that require separate study . first , our ability to recover the optical depth from the absorption spectrum @ xmath31 depends on the strength of the absorption as well as sensitivity of the measurement and the level of measurement at @ xmath32 . for lines with high optical depth @ xmath33 we can in principle recover the optical depth throughout the absorption spectrum . at high optical depths , the absorption partof the data is always below the fundamental level and the useful information is restricted to the shape of the line . this is the general regime that is the subject of this article . in this regime the data is available in a range of frequencies corresponding to velocities high enough to that @ xmath34 but not as high as to have the tail define the window . higher the average optical depth , narrower are the wings ( following spitzer , at @ xmath35 the wings are more dominated by lorentz tail ) . we shall denote this window by @ xmath36 where @ xmath37 is the velocity that the window is based upon ( describing the position of the wing ) and @ xmath38 is the wing profile . this acts as a constraint on the ` ` underlying ' ' of @ xmath39 secondly , fluctuations in the shape of the line are dependent on the frequency dependent wing profile . in other words , the statistical fluctuations of the optical depth are constant in this frequency range , with frequency dependent statistical mean value . since _ fluctuations _ of the optical depth @ xmath40 that have origin in the plane can not be assumed to be completely random , the wing profile of the wing must beaccounted for . what statistical descriptors we should use in terms of line of sight in data collection over long distances ? primary descriptors of a magnetic field , here @ xmath41 , are the ensemble average values of the values of the field at separated points the single point correlation function @ xmath42 and , reciprocally , the average square of the amplitudes of distinct ( fourier ) harmonics in the power spectrum @ xmath43 in practice these quantities are measurable if we can compare the average with average at different points which relies on the homogeneity properties of stochastic processes . we assume that the turbulence is homogeneous and uniform . this does not require the optical field to be completely uniform in the direction of the turbulence , but allows to see the value of @ xmath12 on the background of the average values @ xmath44 , @ xmath45 , which is ( lp04 ) @ xmath46 the correlation function depends only on a point separation and values of distinct spherical waves are zero . the obvious relations are @ xmath47 although mathematically the power spectrum is just a fourier transform of the correlation function @ xmath48 which of them is best known from thedepends on the scale of the signal and the sample . the power spectrum carries information which is specific to a particular scale and as such is insensitive to signals that contribute to the range of scales of signal , in addition to long - range frequency response . on the other hand , generation of spherical harmonics is non - local in configuration space and is subject to specifics of data sampling the same scale , discretization , that can lead to aliasing of power from one scales to another . the problem is solved if the aliased power is large . conversely , the correlation function is local in configuration space and can be defined for non - locally sampled data . however , at each separation it requires information from all scales and may mix with the physical effects from other scales . in particular , @ xmath49 is not well defined for power spectrum data @ xmath50 with index @ xmath51 ( for one dimensional data ) . . ] this problem is relieved if one uses the structure function @ xmath52 instead , which is well defined for @ xmath53 . the structure function can be thought of as regularized version of the correlation function @ xmath54 that is related to the power spectrum in the same way as the correlation function , ifone is the @ xmath55 spectrum . velocity coordinate the studies of lp06 demonstrated that the expected one dimensional distribution of ppv density waves in velocity coordinate that arise from turbulent motions is @ xmath56 where @ xmath57 is the index of line - of - sight component of the optical structure function . for kolmogorov waves @ xmath58 and for turbulent motions dominated by waves @ xmath59 . these distributions are not @ xmath60 which makes the direct measurements of the structure function impractical ( although for @ xmath61 the structure function can be defined ) . at the same time , in our present case we deal with a wide range of data in the case of the absorption spectrum , which allows the direct measurements of the power spectrum . here we first consider the properties of the power spectrum @ xmath62 in this case , and then develop the formalism of second order structure functions . let us consider the power spectrum of the optical absorption spectrum , @ xmath63 here @ xmath64 is the number reciprocal to the angular ( frequency ) separation of two points in the line - of - sight and the coordinates of the ensemble function . . here we haveourselves to [ ##ize . . ] fourier transform of the spectrum . ( [ z : max _ 1 ] ) with respect to velocity is @ xmath65 and the { spectrum @ xmath66 } = ( k _ v - k _ v ^ \ prime ) w ^ * ( k _ v - k _ v ^ { \ prime \ prime } ) \ , \ rangle \ nonumber \ end { aligned } \ ] ] which is easy to calculate the [ density @ xmath67 and velocity is @ xmath68 , as well as the ##s for the real numbers @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 , as @ xmath71 the fluctuating , independent components , for which the calculation is done are the density @ xmath72 and the line - of - sight component of the density of the absorbers @ xmath73 , both in the line of sight . in our earlier paper ( [ lp00 , lp04 ) we note that in many practical cases they should be treated as differences of themselves , so that @ xmath74 } ~ ~ , \ label { z : maxprof _ 1 } \ ] ]where @ xmath75 is the distribution function of the density of the absorbers and @ xmath76 is the structure parameter of their line - of - sight , due to their motions . @ xmath77 is expected to arrive at the value @ xmath78 for consideration of the size of the absorbing particle @ xmath79 . the dependence of @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 only on the distance between a pair of particles breaks the strict linear ##ity of the standard model . using @ xmath82 and the window over @ xmath83 one obtains @ xmath84 where @ xmath85 , @ xmath86 and the value @ xmath87 are defined in the appendix . if one has the whole line available for analysis , the masking function will be replaced with @ xmath88 - a like fourier transform . the values of the windows in the power domain will translate to @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 . the figure shows the effects of aliasing because of the large scales that limit the normal data rate , to the limit . this is theby the comparison with the effect of the mask . the effect is the contribution of the modes with different mode numbers @ xmath91 to the same part of the frequency spectrum . this again illustrates the fact that different fourier transforms are correlated in the vicinity of the mask . to understand the effect of the mask , let us assume that we select the right mode with the effect of a gaussian mask located in the center of the spectrum : @ xmath92 @ xmath93 that is @ xmath94 . this can then be worked out to obtain @ xmath95 } { \ sqrt { ( d ^ + + 2 \ delta ^ 2 ) ( d ^ - + 2 \ delta ^ 2 ) } } \ exp \ left [ - \ frac { \ delta ^ 2 d ^ - } { d ^ - + 2 \ delta ^ 2 } k _ v ^ 2 \ right ] \ \ & & \ left \ exp \ left [ \ frac { - 2 ^ 2 } { d ^ - + 2 \ delta ^ 2 } \ right ] \ left \ { \ exp \ left [ \ frac { - 2 } \ delta ^ 2 k _ v }{ d ^ - + 2 \ delta ^ 2 } \ right ] \ mathrm { erfc } \ left [ \ frac { \ sqrt { 2 } ( [ - \ delta ^ 2 k _ v ) } { \ sqrt { d ^ - + 2 \ delta ^ 2 } } \ right ] + ( k _ v \ to - k _ v ) \ { \ } \ nonumber \ left { a } \ ] ] the following functions ( for @ xmath96 ) are known : @ xmath97 \ nonumber \ \ alpha \ to : & : & \ \ pi ( k _ v ) & \ propto & \ pi ( \ int _ 0 ) ^ 2 & \ int _ 1 ^ 2 dz ( x - z ) \ alpha ( z ) \ frac { \ delta ^ 2 \ exp \ left [ - \ frac { 2 } { 2 } \ frac { d _ 1 ^ 2 } { d ^ + + \ delta ^ 2 } \ right ] } { \ sqrt { ( d ^ + + 2 \ delta ^ 2 ) ( d ^ - + 2 \ delta ^ 2 ) } } \ exp \ left [ - \ frac { \delta ^ 2 d ^ - } { d ^ - + } \ delta ^ 2 } [ _ v ^ { \ } ] \ nonumber \ end { \ } \ ] ] the last expression as well shows the effect of the window , which expressed in terms of the line segment is necessarily not affected by @ xmath98 . the power spectrum is unknown at time @ xmath99 , but it maintains information about the statistics for @ xmath100 . indeed , in our numerical method the power spectrum at @ xmath64 is determined by the fourier transformation such that @ xmath101 which transforms into @ xmath102 . thus , if @ xmath103 has all the available samples at @ xmath64 one has @ xmath104 and there is no significant power aliasing . [ little , @ xmath105 in the interval @ xmath106 . ] for intermediate samples there is no power aliasing as numerical results demonstrate in equation [ 1 : 1 ] . , @ xmath38 , @ xmath107 , @ xmath92 are dimensionless , in the interval of @ xmath108 , the magnitude of the turbulent velocity isthe size of the window . the thermal effect is ignored . only the effect of the turbulent flow and not spatial distribution of the absorbers is taken into account . the best scaling of the wind velocities is kolmogorov , @ xmath58 . the left panel shows the power aliasing due to finite size of the window . the power spectrum is plotted , from top to bottom , for @ xmath109 , i . e the width of the window ranges from the straight line to one - third of the window width . the straight line follows the power law @ xmath110 expected under # ##ized circumstances . one assumes that for the standard model , the power spectrum is recovered for @ xmath111 . the right panel shows the distortion of the window due to thermal effects , which are present at the scale @ xmath112 . thermal effects must be accounted for for @ xmath113 . , title = " [ : " ] , @ xmath38 , @ xmath107 , @ xmath92 are dimensionless , in the case of @ xmath108 , the change of the wind velocity on the scale of the2 . the line shape is neglected . only the distribution of the thermal motions and not spatial distribution of the absorbers is taken into account . the underlying theory of the turbulent spectrum is kolmogorov , @ xmath58 . the left panel illustrates the phase aliasing due to the size of the window . the power spectrum is plotted , from top to bottom , for @ xmath109 , i . e the widths of the wing lines from the complete window to one - tenth of the window width . the straight line shows the power law @ xmath110 expected under the observational circumstances . one sees that for the standard gaussian mask the power spectrum is plotted for @ xmath111 . the right panel shows the modification of the spectrum due to line broadening , which is equivalent to the form @ xmath112 . thermal effects can be accounted for for @ xmath113 . , [ = " fig : " ] the broadening described by @ xmath114 incorporates both turbulence and thermal effects . thermal effects are especially important in case of narrow band propagation , since the range of the wavenumbers is affected by both thermal motion and the turbulence .as @ xmath115 and exists only for relatively narrow wings @ xmath116 . for narrower wings the combined turbulent and turbulent profile must be added to the image , thus determining the temperature of the absorbers at the same time . this problem is complicated by the fact that the temperature of the air is relatively constant for the wavelength of a given wavelength . we should note that the gaussian filter is one of the ideal cases , avoiding the possibility of some aliasing since the # ##ed image falls off quickly . one of the worst scenarios is caused by sharp - hat mask , which the image falls off quickly as @ xmath117 spreading the signal from long scales further into short scales . for steep spectra that we have in vcs , all wings will experience some aliasing . this argues for greater complexity when considering the line wings as power spectra or for consideration of alternative approaches . second order structure function is an alternative to power spectrum , in case of line spectra with the power related to the section of the lines . the second order structure function of the fluctuations of the optical spectrum can be defined as @ xmath118 which provides a regularization of the structure function beyond the ordinary structure function @ xmath119 @ xmath12##0 is proportional to the relative velocity - response as observed at different spatial positions @ xmath121 , as in lp06 . using the formula of lp06 for @ xmath121 we have @ xmath122 \ nonumber \ \ & \ propto & \ frac { { \ hat \ right } ^ { ##p ^ 2 } { r _ z ( s ) } \ frac { 2 } { 1 } \ left ( \ frac { r _ z } { s } \ right ) ^ \ gamma \ left [ \ hat v ^ { 2p } \ gamma ( - 1 ) \ left ( 2 ^ { p - 6 } - 2 ^ { p - 1 } \ right ) + \ frac { 2 ^ { { ##p - 6 } } { [ - 1 } \ hat v ^ 6 + [ ( \ hat v ^ 6 ) \ right ] \ hat { 1 : r _ vv } \ hat { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 are the correlation coefficients that indicates spatial inhomogeneities of the system . to get to ##s , the dimensionless matrix @ xmath125 ,@ xmath126 , @ xmath127 are defined . the first term in the expansion contains information about the wind speed , while the power law terms describe the effects of boundary conditions at the large scale . in contrast to ordinary correlation function they are not defined until @ xmath128 , i . e for @ xmath129 the second order structure function is well defined . when cloud motions provide the dominant contribution to optical density fluctuations , @ xmath130 , we see that from the @ xmath131 we can calculate the turbulence scaling as if @ xmath132 , which includes the same properties of kolmogorov vortex and turbulence - dominated motions . this condition is satisfied by @ xmath133 if the density fluctuations , given the correlation index @ xmath124 , are dominant . at sufficiently large scales the second order structure function has the same scaling as the first order . @ xmath134 a common way of measuring the structure function present in the wing of the line is to take into account the mean profile . the directly related @ xmath135 is related to the structure function of the line by @ xmath136 where the mean profile of the optical density @xmath137 is related to the mean profile of ppv as @ xmath138 described in the section a of lp06 . for zero separations @ xmath139 , the relationship to the structure function related to the profile is as @ xmath140 and is subdominant . the price one pays when utilizing higher - level correlation functions is their higher sensitivity to the noise in the system . even the function itself is not biased by the noise except for at zero separation ( the noise is uncorrelated @ xmath141 [ \ tau ( v _ 1 + v ) + [ ( v _ 1 + v ) ] \ right \ rangle = \ d _ \ tau ( v ) + \ langle n ^ 2 \ rangle \ delta ( v ) \ ] ] already the structure function is biased by the noise which applies to zero separations @ xmath142 ^ 2 \ right \ rangle = d _ \ tau ( v ) + 3 \ langle n ^ 2 \ rangle \ ] ] this effect is further enhanced for the second level correlation function @ xmath143 ^ 2 \ right \ rangle = d _ \ tau ( v ) + 3\ langle [ ^ { \ rangle \ ] ] the difficulty in the determination of the structures are of second order due to noise also exists . structure functions and power spectra are used interchangeably in the theory of turbulence ( see monin & yaglom 1975 ) . however , problems arise when spectra are ` ` extremely steep ' ' , i . e . the corresponding structure functions of fluctuation such as @ xmath144 , @ xmath145 . for the dynamic fields , one can only use ordinary structure functions , while the two dimensional fourier transform that is employed in vcs lead to the power spectrum of @ xmath146 being well defined . as a result , one does not have to deal with so steep spectra in theory of turbulence ( see , however , cho et al . 2002 and cho & lazarian 2004 ) . in the vcs , such ` ` extremely steep ' ' spectra arise naturally , even when the data is close to the kolmogorov . this was demonstrated in lp06 , where the spectral approach is regarded as the correct way to model turbulence using curves of intensity along v - coordinate . the disadvantage of the spectral approach arises when the data is being described by a non - linear structure .. . the deviation from the scales given by the window function may interfere with the obtained spectrum at large @ xmath64 . the use of an alternative , smaller scale window function may reduce the effect , which limits the range of @ xmath64 for which it can be observed . therefore , higher order structure functions ( see the subsection below ) , is advantageous for the same data handling . in terms of the vca theory , we used the spectral description in lp00 , and in lp04 , dealing with scattering , we were advantageous to deal with real rather than fourier transforms . in doing so , however , we ignored the steepness of the spectrum along the v - axis and added a correction to the fourier description to avoid the problem with the ` ` extremely steep ' ' case . naturally , our use of higher order structure functions is applicable to dealing with the problems within the vca theory . in the section above we have discussed the application of vcs to strong absorption lines . the following assumptions were made . first of all , for the radiative transfer we neglected the effect of stimulated emission . this assumption is well suited for ir and weak absorption lines ( see spitzer 1979 ) . then , we assumed that the radiation is reflected froma point source , which is an optical source for the emission of light of a star or a quasar . moreover , we disregarded the effects of temperature in the source . within our view the last assumption would be most questionable . however , it is known that the variations of temperature do affect absorption lines . therefore , our present study , as well as our earlier studies , prove that the effects of the variations of density are significant . it is easy to see that the temperature variations can be used together with the density ones to get based on ` ` , ' ' which effects we have already described . our formalism can also be generalized to include the more sophisticated radiative transfer and the extended extend of the radiation source . in the latter case we shall have to consider both the effects of a narrow and a wide telescope beam , the way that has been described in lp06 . thus , the expressions in lp06 for the narrow telescope beam can be straightforwardly extended to the absorption lines , substituting the spectral depth variations instead of density . the advantage of the extended source is that not only vcs , but also vca can be measured ( see deshpande et al . 2000 ) . as the disadvantage of an extended source isthe steepening of the standard v - coordinate allows for studies of unresolved turbulence . this , for example , would require using a higher order correlation ##s , if one has to deal with windows arising from saturation of the spectral line . in lp06 we have studied the vcs technique in the presence of absorption and formulated the formula for the fluctuations of intensity to accurately predict the fluctuations of turbulent turbulence . in this paper , however , we used the concept of intensities and showed that this allows for studies beyond the regime , in which fluctuations of intensity would be expected . the difficulty of such an approach is the uncertainty of the base level of the signal . taking values is a non - linear operation that can corrupt the data , if the base level of signal is not accounted for properly . however , the advantage of the is that potentially it allows studies of velocity fluctuations , when the traditional vca and vcs fail . further research should clarify the limitations of this technique . the study of turbulence using the new vcs technique , should be done for optical depth @ xmath12 up to @ xmath13 . for this range of optical depth , the line velocity is determined by phase shifts ratherthan the atomic scale . although almost the entire line profile contains information about the turbulence , in practice , the flat ##ter ##nary of the profile will contain only noise and will not be available for any further analysis . however , the wings of the lines will contain information . as multiple absorption lines can be available for the same line of interest , this helps to improve the reliability of measurements of them together . we find that piecewise analyses of the wings belonging to different absorption lines are possible . the actual data analysis may involve fitting the data with parameters , that , apart from the absorption index , specify the turbulence injection , and the dispersion , and this is described in chepurnov et al . ( 2006 ) . note , that measurements of turbulence in the same plane using different absorption lines will yield complementary results . formally , if lines with strong absorption , i . e . @ xmath148 are used , there is no need for other measurements . however , in the presence of background noise , the situation will be far from ideal . naturally , noise of a constant level , e . g . background noise , will produce the strong absorption lines . the strong absorption lines , in terms of vcs sample size , for a large @ xmath64 . this limits the analysisof turbulent scales that can be obtained with the technique . however , the resolution that is obtained with the weak absorption lines is higher , which provides an advantage of higher signal to noise ratio for the range of @ xmath64 that is sampled with the absorption line . if , however , a very strong absorption line is used , an approach with a two dish radio interferometer is made . every dish of the radio interferometer samples the frequencies in the [ $ @ xmath149 $ ] , where @ xmath150 is the measured wavelength , @ xmath151 is the distance of the dish . in addition , the radio interferometer measures the spatial frequency @ xmath152 , where @ xmath153 is the distance between the dishes . thus , a strong absorption line provides with the resolution of turbulent scales at the largest spatial scale of the sampled range , as well as the fluctuation corresponding to the frequency @ xmath154 . in lp06 we concentrated on obtaining turbulence models for the data . at the same time in chepurnov et al . ( 2006 ) fitting models of turbulence to the data was attempted . in the latter approach power - - efficient observed spectra can be obtained, which is true for actual systems , for which the range of radiation in @ xmath64 is very small . thus , for hi with the injection velocities of 10 km / s and the thermal velocities of 10 km / s , an order of magnitude of the ` ` inertial range ' ' . but for thermal velocities one can increase this range by a factor , which depends on the signal to noise ratio of the system . using heavier species other than light one can increase the range by a factor @ xmath155 . this may or may not be enough for very good asymptotics . we have noticed recently [ ] that for absorption lines the number of windows determined by the shape of the absorption wings introduces a distortion of the absorption spectrum . however , this is not a problem if , instead of asymptotics , simplicity of the model is used . according to the method used in chepurnov et al . ( 2006 ) the model for absorption lines should not have to model the turbulence caused by the radiation . the fact remains , however , that absorption lines are a pure - beam observations . formally , there is an extensive list of different tools to study turbulence that allow ourstudies ( see lazarian 1999 and ref . therein ) . however , a careful analysis shows that this approach is not as good as it looks . however , our studies show that some techniques can provide confusing , if not useful , output , unless theoretical understanding of what they do is achieved . for example , we mentioned in the literature an example of the erroneous application of velocity estimation to the fluid dynamics data . note , that clumps and # ##ing methods would create a hierarchy of shells / shells for the observations obtained with _ _ _ _ . this calls for a more rigorous approach to the interpretation of the results of some of the above techniques . for example , the use of different wavelets for the analysis of data is often described in the literature using different ##iating methods of turbulence studies ( nielsen & henriksen 1990 , stutzki et al . 1998 , cambresy 1999 , khalil et al . 2006 ) , which creates the illusion of an excessive wealth of tools and approaches . in addition , while these methods use methods of @ xmath156 , wavelets use more complex basis functions , which may be more useful for problems at hand . in our studies we also use them both to analyzethe use of experiments ( @ kowal & lazarian 2006a ) and statistical methods ( ossenkopf et al . 2006 , esquivel et al . 2007 ) , along with or instead of fourier transforms of correlation functions . this can solve the problems arising from failure of models , as we saw in the situations when correlation functions of models that we studied were changing and the mach number was increasing , a new technique ( @ xmath38 - variance ) was being used ( cp . esquivel & lazarian 2005 , ossenkopf et al . 2006 , esquivel et al . 2007 ) . while for wavelets the correlation functions are fixed , a more general technique , principal component analysis ( pca ) , chooses the functions that are , in some sense , the most accurate . nevertheless , the empirical relations obtained with pca for extracting velocity statistics have , according to padoan et al . ( 2006 ) , an uncertainty of the full correlation index of the theory @ xmath157 ( see de brunt et al . 2003 ) , which is too large for for most of the classical theories . in addition , all our research at lp00 shows that for velocity statistics @ xmat##h158 , for @ xmath159 both velocity and density may influence the size of ppv values , and effects of ppv values on density have been reported so far in pca studies . this also may explain the difficulty of interpreting the underlying relations associated with data cubes of high resolution . the result is a special case of random sampling , which is discussed in a number of articles ( lazarian et al . 2001 , esquivel et al . 2003 , chepurnov & lazarian 2006a ) . _ probability distribution function ( scf ) _ ( see rosolowsky et al . 1999 for the original definition ) is another way to measure density . the development of the scf algorithm by padoan et al . ( 2001 ) removed the above parameters from the above definition for the scf and made the technique rather similar to vca in terms of the underlying data analysis . however , both scf and vca measure changes of velocity in ppv ` ` and ' ' ( random variables with a given observation for @ xmath160 ) , and if scf treats the outcome empirically , the underlying relations . lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) relate the vca algorithm tothe underlying velocity and density statistics . however , scf contains both square roots and normalizations compared to the vca expression . those bring the analytical cost , which is possible for all vca models , lower . we can say that , similar to the concept of conventional ##ized and not the centroids introduced by lazarian & esquivel ( 2003 ) , the size difference between the channels measured by the vca and scf is not significant . in fact , we predicted several well - known scenarios for vca models . for instance , there are ` ` thick ' ' for channels with velocity ranges greater than @ xmath160 and ` ` thin ' ' for . vca : the relative ratio of intensity fluctuations in turbulent medium to the thickness of the turbulent channel and to the average velocity and density in the emitting turbulent medium . in the vca these pairs of slices with the thickness of ppv ` ` thin ' ' are used to measure velocity and density fluctuations . we predicted that " thick " and thin " slice regimes should be present in the scf analysis of data , but they have not been reported yet . while the vca can be used for all the cases the scf is used ( e . g. for ( direct comparisons of measurements and observations ) , the converse is not true . in fact , padoan et al . ( 2004 ) show that vca eliminates the inevitable for empirical methods to calibrate ppv fluctuations in terms of the underlying 3d velocity distribution . _ vcs _ is a statistical tool that uses the distribution of samples along the spatial axis of the ppv . among all the tools that use spectral coverage , including the vca , it is unique , because _ _ does not _ require spatial coverage . this is why , dealing with the absorption lines , where the spectral coverage is problematic , we use the vcs . potentially , having many sources sampling the spectrum one can create ppv cubes and then use the vca technique . however , this requires many large data sets , so for the vcs , with 5 or more sources can be sufficient for obtaining the statistics ( chepurnov & lazarian 2006a ) . we feel that dealing with the ism problem , it is necessary to use different methods . for the methods used their relationship with the underlying fourier transform is not well understood . for the formulation of the theory ( both in this work , as well as , in our previous papers in terms of the fourier transform) in terms of wavelets is possible . at the same time , the analysis of data with the technique can be advantageous , especially , in the case when one has to deal with window functions . in the paper , we have shown that * studies of turbulence with absorption lines are possible with the vcs technique if , instead of intensity @ xmath161 , one uses the spectrum of the absorbed intensity @ xmath162 , which is equal to the optical depth @ xmath163 . * in the saturated spectral setting , i . e . when the optical depth at the middle of the absorption line is greater than unity , the analysis of the @ xmath17 contrasts with the analysis of spectra of turbulence for high resolution that we discussed in lp06 . * in the intermediate absorption retime , i . e . when the optical depth at the middle of the absorption line is greater than unity , but less than @ xmath13 , the spectrum of the absorption line can be used for the analysis . the saturated portion of the line is expected to have noise ##less . * the greater the intensity , the smaller the portion of the spectrum corresponding to the wings available for the analysis . in terms of the spectral depththis introduces and further uncertainty in the expressions for the vcs function . therefore , the contrast of the scattering amplitude ##s increases with the size of the bubble . * for the absorption lines , the intensity is determined by lorentzian motion of the line and therefore no information about turbulence is available . see eqns .
