the cdf collaboration has detected an excess in the form of two jets in connection with the @ xmath1 boson production @ xcite from data collected at the tevatron with a center - of - mass energy of 1 . 96 tev and an effective luminosity of 1 . 3 fb @ xmath6 . the @ xmath1 boson is identified through a single particle ( electron or muon ) with zero angular momentum . the effective mass of the dijet production is found to be in the range of 120 - 150 gev . the @ xmath0dijet production has a few photon cross - section which is much lower than standard model ( sm ) sources . the dijet production can be interpreted as an unidentified resonance with energy of 150 gev which then decays into two excited states . this leads to the speculation that a beyond expected new physics has been discovered . at present the excess from the sm expectation is estimated at 3 . 5 @ xmath7 level . the result needs to be further studied . on the theoretical level , our understanding of the parton distributions and related phenomena still have room for interpretation to make sure that the excess represents a new origin for the sm @ xcite . nevertheless ,of course this theory has received little attention . several other particles in sm have been proposed to explain the cdf @ xmath0dijet model , such as leptophobic @ xmath8 , @ xcite , technicolor @ xcite , colored particle , scalar @ xcite , quasi - standard higgs model @ xcite and the other possibilities @ xcite . common to all of these proposals is that the colored particle will decay directly into hadrons ( dijet ) . we note that one class of particles which occur naturally have this property . these are those particles which are colored and couple to quarks directly . in order for these particles to be considered as a possible candidate , they must satisfy requirements derived from the experimental data . colored particles which couple to other particles have been searched for at the tevatron and the lhc . if the relationships to quarks / particles are the same as the standard model , the colored triplet diquark with a mass in the range @ xmath9 gev is excluded at the tevatron @ xcite , and the two particles , @ xmath10 gev , @ xmath11tev and @ xmath12 tev are excluded at the lhc @ xcite whereas the lhc limit is limited for @ xmath13 gev . the color sextet diquarks with negative charge , @ xmath14 , @ xmath15 , @ xmath16 , are excluded for their energy less than 1 . 8 , 1 . 9 , 1 . 0 tev , for @ xcite . the color - vectors / scalars which interact with quarks / ##ons via weak interactions are excluded for @ xmath17 tev @ xcite . if their coupling to proton / gluon are smaller than the qcd limit the constraints are weaker . some aspects of colored particles relevant to the cdf @ xmath0dijet model have been studied in @ xcite . in this paper we carried out a preliminary study to explore the possibility of introducing gauge bosons @ xmath18 into the colored particles in the cdf , where @ xmath19 , induced by @ xmath18 decays into massive hadron particles . at the tree level , there are several new scalar particles which can have renormalizable interactions tosm particles ( or a particle and an anti - particle ) . a complete list of the sm scalars which can couple to sm fermions at the flavor level @ xcite and some of the cases have been studied before @ xcite . the observed radar cross section and the mass from @ xmath0dijets can put constraints on model validity . some possible explanations are ruled out when confronted with other existing data , such as data from flavor - free fusion ( fcnc ) experiments . we find that without forcing of the flavor level to be some special case most of the scalars , except the @ xmath5 , are in agreement with fcnc data . we , however , can find that some special cases can be made consistent with the data by modeling their behavior . a possible explanation for the @ xmath0dijet comes from cdf . justification of these results may have a realization in a quantum theory , which is beyond the scope of the present work of phenomenology . these sm particles also have interesting signatures at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron model ( lhc ) which can be used to help explain themodels . the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : cs ] , we describe the colored - scalars which can couple to two particles ( either a particle and an anti - quark ) , and determine their quantum couplings by requiring that the colored particle with a mass of 1 gev to match the cdf @ xmath0dijet ##s # . in section [ sec : fcnc ] , we apply the constraints from fcnc above on colored - particles . in section [ sec : rhic ] , we discuss the implications for the rhic and the lhc . finally , we summarize our results in sec . [ sec : cs ] . scalar bosons which have mass and a renormalizable yukawa coupling to two quarks or a pair of a quark and an anti - particle can be easily determined by studying cross - products of two quarks @ xcite . the results convert into the : @ xmath20 and : @ xmath21 the corresponding bi - products , @ xmath22 and @ xmath23 . here @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 are generation indices . with these two numbers ,we can obtain the following quark cross - section @ xmath26 where the superscript ` ` @ xmath27 ' ' indicates the distribution . for those fields which only couple to right - handed quarks , the contribution to @ xmath1 associated production will be small because they do not even couple to @ xmath1 boson . to obtain an @ xmath1 associated production for the cdf field , we will need the following colored fields which only couple to left - handed quarks @ xmath28 where @ xmath29 is a color generator , @ xmath30 is the @ xmath31 generator known as @ xmath32 , and @ xmath33 ( @ xmath34 ) is a generator of the color index ( @ xmath35 , @ xmath36 ) . the three component fields , @ xmath37 , @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 , are obtained by where the total energy is normalized to . we denote the component fields of @ xmath40 as follows : @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 are the @ xmath40 generators . for the @ x##math43 , the leading results can be separated according to their physics , with @ xmath44 and @ xmath45 . for @ xmath19 produced by @ xmath46 production , the leading results come from the @ xmath47 - channel and @ xmath48 - channel tree production as shown in diagram . [ feyn ] . - channel and @ xmath48 - channel diagram of @ xmath49 production . black , wavy and dashed line represents neutron and p - decay , @ xmath50 and @ xmath18 , etc . [ feyn ] ] for @ xmath51 , @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 the @ xmath48 - channel process does exist in addition to the diagram of @ xmath47 - channel tree production . one has to know how the colored particles couple to neutron and the @ xmath1 process . we define the first coupling , the second mass eigenstate , as the following , @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 . the phase diagram is given by @ xmath56 , @ xmath57 and @ xmath58, where @ xmath59 is the ckm - mixing matrix , and @ xmath60 ( @ xmath618 @ xmath62 , ( 6 , 3 ) , ( 6 , 1 ) , ( 6 , 3 ) , ( 6 , 1 ) ) are the mixing matrices in string theory . @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 are symmetric , and , @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 are anti - symmetric , under the assumption of color , @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the diquark interactions are @ xmath67 where @ xmath68 is @ xmath40 pair , and @ xmath69 is @ xmath40 pair . the electroweak gauge interactions are given by @ xmath70 where @ xmath71 is the second term . the electroweak gauge interactions of the two groups are obtained from the equation : @ xmath72 where @ xmath73 is the reciprocal of the bond angle @ xmath74 , and @ xmath75 . in the limit the indices are , and interaction withgluons are excluded . for @ xmath51 half - lives and @ xmath52 , @ xmath76 diquarks , the dominant contributions to the @ xmath19 production come from @ xmath18 coupling to the first generation , @ xmath77 . for @ xmath78 , @ xmath53 diquarks , on the other hand , because the yukawa coupling ##s is anti - symmetric in first order , the dominant contributions would come from @ xmath79 coupling ( which produces @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 , ##s ##s by cabibbo coupling ) . in general each component of @ xmath18 will have different masses . in order to avoid the contribution to @ xmath82 production , we assume that all the components have the same masses for all . since , and the masses of the colored components are fixed , the only unknowns parameters , the color coupling , can be determined by using the colored scalars to analyze the cdf @ xmath0dijet ##s . we study the two types of colored components separately . for the first , we use madgraph / madevent @ xciteand , @ xcite for the particle - beam re - generation , and pgs for the particle detector system . jets are generated in cone form with @ xmath83 . we obtain the same kinematical cuts as those denoted in figure . the corresponding angular momenta are chosen so that the dijet invariant - mass has a minimum of the critical masses . the best result for the simulation of color - coded scalars @ xmath51 with @ xmath84 coupling is shown in fig . 1 @ xmath49 production cross - section at the tevatron is estimated to be 90 % ( without the @ xmath85 - coupling ) . for other cases , we get similar distribution . dijets events at the tevatron . cdf results are from figure . @ xcite is compared with our # ##f values for the n - octet scalar model with @ xmath86 ( solid ) and the z - coded @ xmath87 contribution ( liquid ) . [ cdf ] ] we list the possible values of the couplings for each . in the figure , @ xmath88 we see that the coupling coefficients are of order @ x##math89 for color - coded scalars , but close to @ xmath90 for diquark ones . the large yukawa couplings for the diquark ones come from the fact that the tevatron has a @ xmath91 , therefore the generation of diquark must make up one sea - state whose wave function is suppressed . the large values for @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 , are possible since the neutron cross - section is suppressed due to the cabibbo - suppressed couplings to @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 quarks and the large @ xmath48 and @ xmath27 - 1 parton distribution in a nucleus . the coupling between them is probably due to either a triplet or a singlet of @ xmath40 . two things are in evidence for the large - scale yukawa coupling which may explain differences in decay widths and results from direct mass search for these particles , at times , as in the ua2 @ xcite . first , the decay energies of these scalars are less than 1 gev for color - coded cases ,and branching down to 100 gev for diquark production , where the flavour ##s of the yukawa coupling of the jets to quarks are identical to those determined in the previous section . these two widths are large enough to be the width of the individual dijet ##s as the consequence of the nature of the angular momentum measurements . however , inclusive ##ness of the jets which couple to quarks are excluded by the two - dimensional nuclear decay spectrum measurement in the ua2 experiment @ xcite . for @ xmath94 gev , the cross - section of the branching down to 100 % is excluded for @ xmath95 pb . the measurements in fig . ( 8 ) provide values for @ xmath96 . [ as @ xmath97 . \ ] ] from the spectrum , we see that the couplings in eq . ( 8 ) can also be excluded by the ua2 experiment . the cross section for @ xmath78 is on the left of the spectrum . we also see the @ xmath98dijet # cross - section at the tevatron . for the couplings in fig . ( [ central - value ] ) , the @xmath99 + @ xmath18 production cross - sections are estimated to be @ xmath100 . \ ] ] the largest @ xmath101 is ~ 1 . 7 pb , which is 23 % of @ xmath102 in the sm estimation in first - order . this fraction is similar to @ xmath103 . therefore , although there has been no significant significant data from the diboson production of @ xmath104 produced at the tevatron laboratory , @ xmath105 production should be more carefully considered . from the previous example we see that the yukawa couplings of these colored particles to the first and second particles are much larger than that of the background higgs in order to explain the cdf @ xmath0dijets mechanism . therefore we need to determine whether the large yukawa coupling are consistent with data . we also study constraints from @ fcnc ##s by colored particles which may imply sizeable meson - antimeson mixing . we study each case separately in the following . the phenomenological studies of the light - colored scalar can be found in @ xcite . here we study the constraints from the theory of the##sons for applying diagonal matrices to the next set of models . for @ xmath51 , with @ xmath106 and @ xmath107 , we have @ xmath108 if @ xmath109 is not diagonal , exchange of @ xmath110 will induce large fcnc interactions at tree level , such as @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 mixing , making the model unstable . but if @ xmath109 is diagonal , exchange of @ xmath113 at tree level will also induce fcnc interactions which may result in too large @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 and @ xmath116 - @ xmath117 mixing . to find the fcnc interactions , we will start with a special case where @ xmath118 ( where @ xmath119 is a diagonal matrix ) for and ( @ xmath120 ) . - @ xmath115 is replaced by @ xmath109 coupling . the matrix is the zero - doublet scalar coupling . [ fcnc ] ] in the case where the @ xmath109 coupling is dependent .( @ xmath121 ) , the @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 correlation function @ xmath122 is induced by @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 and @ xmath18 - @ xmath18 contribution is shown in fig . [ fcnc ] . in order to define the @ xmath18 contribution , we define the correlation operators : @ xmath123 where @ xmath124 , @ xmath125 ( @ xmath126 is the mass of @ xmath18 contribution ) , and @ xmath127 . the correlation functions @ xmath128 and @ xmath129 are induced by @ xmath130 we define the @ xmath18 contribution of @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 the contribution of @ xmath131 where @ xmath132 is a decay rate constant , @ xmath133 is a particle number , and @ xmath134 is a coupling constant from the crystal structure of the @ xmath122 interaction with @ xmath85 mesons @ xcite . , the @xmath135 and @ xmath136 terms are from the @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 box diagram . the @ xmath137 term is from the @ xmath18 - @ xmath18 box diagram . the kaon mass difference is also from @ xmath138 . inserting the term @ xmath139 given in fig . ( [ p - value ] ) ( under the second assumption , @ xmath140 ) , we find that the @ xmath135 term is the contribution , which corresponds to the @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 box diagram with charm - mass insertions . the long distance sm contribution has uncertainty which probably arises from the observed mass and energy differences . for the @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 system , the long distance sm contribution with the second - to - leading order sm contribution would be roughly 50 % of the observed data , @ xmath141 gev @ xcite . since the long distance contribution has yet to be estimated , the total mixing ratio of particles would be consistent with the model . we estimate the ratio of the leading order @ xmath##18 , and the short distance sm contribution , which is obtained from the hadronic model , @ xmath142 . we see that the contributions from the local scalar are at 1 % of the short distance sm contribution of the mixing amplitude for the system @ xmath143 followed by the @ xmath0dijet excess , and thus , consistent with the experimental prediction of the local distribution . the imaginary part of the mixing amplitude of the cp violation in @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 mixing . we see that @ xmath144 is less than 2 % , and thus it is consistent with prediction . the mixing amplitudes of @ xmath145 - @ xmath146 are obtained just by mixing @ xmath147 , @ xmath132 , @ xmath133 and @ xmath134 mixing , and they are found to be at the level of less than 1 % of the standard model prediction as well as the experimental result . when @ xmath51 couples to @ xmath148 and @ xmath107 , we get @ xmath149 in this case , to the high - order fcnc ,one is said to have @ xmath150 to be satisfied . very similar to the above , to avoid confusion for one loop fcnc , we have our illustration , of the pair ( @ xmath151 ) @ xmath152 with @ xmath153 . in this case , the @ xmath18 ##4 is @ xmath154 where @ xmath155 and @ xmath156 respectively are the mixing factors from the two loops of the loop , @ xmath157 and @ xmath158 , @ xmath85 mesons , and @ xcite . the result is sufficient ( @ xmath159 % of the expected value ) for the expression for the complex number obtained from @ xmath0dijet ##s . the result is the same for the @ xmath160 - @ xmath161 mixing amplitude . the @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 mixing amplitude is obtained by exchanging @ xmath162 , and exchanging @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 in the case of @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 mixing . the mixing amplitude of@ xmath111 - @ xmath112 induced by the @ xmath165 coupling is expected to be very small at the level of coupling than @ xmath166 compared to the short distance sm contribution . on the other hand , @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 mixing amplitude induced by the @ xmath167 coupling has a large @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 ##8 contribution ( compared to the @ xmath135 coupling ) , which is similar to the short distance sm one . however , the long distance sm contribution of @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 mixing is small compared to the experimental result , @ xmath168 it is expected that the distance contribution of the sm will produce the same result . for our purpose , it is therefore reasonable to assume that @ xmath84 coupling required for the cdf @ xmath0dijet coupling will satisfy requirements from @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 mixing , and that the octet - based coupling with the form @ xmath169 will decay into @ xmath170 , about 20 % of @ xmat##h171 - the constant fraction in @ xmath49 ##7 . one may also choose to have both @ xmath109 and @ xmath84 amplitude non - zero . but there is a small contribution to @ xmath172 ( @ xmath173 ) amplitude compared to @ xmath174 ( @ xmath175 ) . this contribution must be small enough in one of the @ xmath176 to be much smaller than the other . this discussion goes back to the first two cases studied . one may be able to forbid one of the @ xmath177 couplings to some other @ xmath178 symmetry , such as @ xmath179 and @ xmath180 and @ xmath181 to eliminate @ xmath182 . but to have @ xmath183 proportional to unit chosen amplitude , this raises the question how good the choice is . while this may be done by using discrete symmetry to enforce the desired symmetry breaking , such manipulation is beyond use of this article and we will limit ourselves to phenomenological considerations instead . we assume that the symmetry with @ xmath51 couples to either @ xmat##h106 only or @ xmath148 only is a phenomenologically correct model . now let us see if the color pairs and triplet diquarks are allowed . some phenomenological analysis of the color pairs and the scalars can be found in @ xcite . the mixed diquark @ xmath52 with the couplings required to generate cdf @ xmath0dijet excess will lead to a minimum mixing of @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 and @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 in accordance with data . from fig . ( [ di - int ] ) we can see that mixing of @ xmath185 at tree level will generate a mixing constraint for @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 if @ xmath186 . the mixing is estimated by @ xmath187 . tree level mixing for @ xmath188 is also generated by @ xmath189 if . these two contributions can be calculated by letting @ xmath190 by = @ xmath191 , where @ xmath192 is the cabibbo mixing angle. however , under the exact cancellation of the tree level contributions , the loop level contributions are too large . one then has to perform mixing of the tree and the loop contributions . this also represents a case of fine tuning . although this is quite unnatural and difficult to realize for building a model compared to the standard model , from a phenomenological point of view it is not worked out yet . the two diquarks @ xmath193 do not induce the tree - level meson - level mixing , but can be generated at the in - plane level of the phase diagram . because the diquark @ xmath78 is a @ xmath40 singlet and @ xmath65 is time - symmetric . the cdf @ xmath0dijet model requires a large value of @ xmath92 . for example , let us consider the special case with @ xmath195 and @ xmath196 in the @ xmath197 frame : @ xmath198 the contribution to @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 the contribution from @ xmath78 to @ xmath199 for @ xmath200 and @ xmat##h201 gev however , for the cdf @ xmath0dijet data , it is twice that of the standard distance coupling contribution above , due to the coupling of @ xmath202 . the coupling @ xmath203 can also generate an operator of strangeless charm decay , such as @ xmath204 . the coupling generates a strangeless charm decay [ , @ xmath205 , \ ] ] where we use @ xmath206 the contribution interfere with the standard ##ization amplitude at 40 % ( in the strongly suppressed process ) for @ xmath207 and @ xmath208 gev , which conflicts with the experimental results of the coupling ratio @ xcite : br ( @ xmath209 . we find that @ xmath78 is sufficient to explain the cdf @ xmath0dijets ) , and the quantities can be adjusted by choosing the right solutions to right - handed solutions . in the case of @ xmath53 , a similar analysis as in the previous section can be done by supposing @ xmath211 and @ xmath212 in the @ xmath197 basis . thethis means , @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 box diagram for the @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 contribution vanish due to the color anti - symetricity , @ xmath213 and the @ xmath18 - @ xmath18 box diagram , . as a result we have : @ xmath214 for @ xmath215 and @ xmath216 gev which is different from the @ xmath0dijet excess , the coupling contribution is the same size of the long distance coupling contribution . the coupling contributions also contribute to the strangeless charm effect by about 50 % . although those contributions may be insufficient for hadronic systems , they can extend this contribution to the allowed range . in the case of @ xmath76 diquark , the diquark contribution is a coupling contribution , @ xmath218 the @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 box diagram also vanishes due to the color anti - symmetricity . the contribution to @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 mixing effect is @ xmath219 where @ xmath220 if we take @ xmath##221 , @ xmath222 and @ xmath208 gev , the @ xmath18 contribution is half as large as the short distance decay contribution . however , @ xmath223 has a symmetric coupling , and thus , one can choose @ xmath224 and @ xmath225 to be zero to avoid the sign changing process . ( under the choice , @ xmath226 . ) therefore , the mixing amplitudes can be consistent with experiments . there is a limit to strangeless proton decay in this case . we note that the two excited states , @ xmath76 and @ xmath53 , can only have a leptoquark coupling @ xmath227 in them , and there is a severe problem of the very rapid proton decay . one can avoid the rapid proton decays by breaking a coupling @ xcite , or a simple baryon - decay coupling , such as proton - antineutron , which can be observed at high field energies @ xcite . we compare the results in table [ table1 ] for the yukawa coupling of the two proton and fcnc constraints . we conclude thatthese are models which are consistent with fcnc constraints . other ways of distinguishing these models should be considered . in the next section , we will study the combinations of the rich and lhc . . list of parameters from the fcnc and of the couplings to all the cdf @ xmath1 + dijets . [ parameters = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , header = " header " , ] the triplet diquark @ xmath76 can interact with right - handed particles for s - s interactions , @ xmath228 the coupling @ xmath229 is very different from the coupling to the left - handed quarks . although the @ xmath49 production cross - section is unchanged by the right - handed particle ##s , the coupling @ xmath18 production cross - section can be increased . in ref . [ rhic ] , we can see how the cross - section would increase by increasing the coupling to right - handed particles for @ xmath76 production . with the same strong coupling @ xmath230 to the second generation particles , @ xmath231 would give the sameproduction cross - section as the @ xmath232 case , as is known . coupling to right - handed particles are also possible for @ xmath194 case , but only in 3 - octet , @ xmath233 and @ xmath210 cases . note that @ xmath49 production cross - section has large dependence on the couplings to the right - handed particles , whereas @ xmath105 production cross - section has small dependence on the couplings to the left - handed quarks , because @ xmath234 interactions are stronger than the @ xmath235 couplings . at the rhic , using the structure of the proton ##s @ xcite , it is possible to probe the chiral ##ity of the diquark coupling to spin . the partonic proton ##or , known as @ xmath236 where the terms describe the parton s helicity ( chirality ) , is assumed to be @ xmath237 for the case we studied . also , we can probe the spin of the left - handed particles @ xmath238 which is fixed by the cdf @ .##math0dijet ##s , and the right - handed coupling @ xmath229 which is unknown currently . with the study of the spin parton spin distribution of particles in valence band theory , it is possible to extract the partonic spin distribution from the hadronic observables . however , the detailed analysis is outside the scope of this article . and @ xmath239 gev . @ xmath240 + @ xmath6 of the same type is assumed . background event ( dashed ) is estimated using the 2 @ xmath2412 qcd method without @ xmath85 - 1 correction . background event and @ xmath76 decay are estimated without couplings to left - handed particles ( dashed ) , and with coupling to right - handed quarks with @ xmath242 ( dashed ) . [ rhic ] ] at the lhc , @ xmath1 + @ xmath18 + @ xmath99 + @ xmath18 decay followed by @ xmath243 decay to produce the same signal . the same cross - coupling at the lhc with @ xmath244 decay##v is also shown in table [ table2 ] . the three major processes are similar to those at the tevatron ; @ xmath245jets , @ xmath246 and alpha - particle production . the results for the signal - to - background analysis at the lhc can be found in ref . @ xcite , for example . the @ xmath1 + @ xmath18 + @ xmath99 + @ xmath18 processes have different cross - correlation as can be seen from table [ table2 ] , except for the diquark - decay process . following the study in ref . @ xcite , and taking into account the available @ xmath0jets data , the @ xmath247 signal for the @ xmath76 process can be seen with the signal - to - background ratio of @ xmath248 for the process with @ xmath249 [ gev ] . assuming the overall processing efficiency to the @ xmath250 , an expected output signal for the @ xmath251 process is @ xmath252 [ fb @ xmath6 ] in this case . for the color - oct##et scalar theory , the signal - to - background ratio is estimated to be @ xmath254 , so a better understanding of the background ratio is needed to explain the excess . we have studied the possibility of explaining the cdf @ xmath0dijet excess by introducing colored scalar @ xmath18 bosons . with colored scalars , when coupled to two particles , they can go into dijet which is one of the key properties of the @ xmath0dijet excess . there are three colored scalars , @ xmath255 , @ xmath256 , @ xmath257 , which all have non - renormalizable yukawa couplings with the particles . not all of them can completely explain the @ xmath0dijet excess . because the @ xmath0dijet excess has a stronger coupling to the first pair of particles compared to the higgs coupling to them , the color couplings must also be consistent with other observed background data . we have analyzed fcnc ##s from meson - antimeson data . we find that without forcing of the yukawa coupling to be some special - case most of the particles , exceptthe @ xmath258 , are in agreement with fcnc data . we , however , find that the @ xmath259 , @ xmath260 and @ xmath261 can be considered consistent with the data . since we confined our study to phenomenological aspects of these new particles , we note that a concrete solution of their coupling is difficult to find . unless one finds a sufficient symmetry to forbid the use of the correlation matrices , for example the off diagonal representation of @ xmath109 for the photon , it is always the case that they are interacting at some level . in this case , all the solutions discussed here are to be considered and fine tuned until a concrete solution is found . the coupling of the first triplet scalar is an @ xmath40 ##8 , and it also has @ xmath98dijet excess , about 1 / 3 of the @ xmath262 process , which is also observed as a bump at 150 gev energy . we also studied the predictions for the diquark origin for @ xmath263 colliders , the rhic and the lhc . if the cdf excess reaches the diquark origin , it may beand at the early lhc level . the rhic data will help to identify the diquarks . after completing this work , the cdf published an updated analysis @ xcite using data collected prior to november 2010 corresponding to an integrated abundance of 4 . 3 fb @ xmath6 . their results are consistent with their early analysis @ xcite and increase the abundance to 4 . 3 @ xmath7 . the d0 group also reported their results of an analysis @ xcite with an integrated luminosity of 4 . 3 fb @ xmath6 . they did not find any @ xmath0diget ##s . although d0 is also looking for similar excess , the data differs in some ways which could be an important cause for confusion . we are not in a position to decide which results should be and which has to be settled among the two groups . we think that a review of some of the cdf results is still worthy . our conclusions are not supported by the new cdf results . p . chiappetta , j . layssac , j . m . renard and m . verzegnassi , phys . * * * * , 789 ( 1996 ) ;
