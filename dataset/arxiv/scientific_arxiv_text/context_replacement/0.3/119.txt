information stored in qubits can be used for efficient quantum communication or for quantum computing @ xcite . this information is encoded as a quantum number @ xmath4 which in the case of a qubit can be parameterized as | ( , ) = | 0 + 1 ^ i | | ; [ 1 ] where @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 are the vectors of the four - dimensional space of the qubit and @ xmath7 ; @ xmath8 . qubits are very fragile , that means the state of a qubit can easily be changed by the influence of the quantum or a quantum error . a ( very simple ) way to protect the quantum information encoded in a qubit is to measure it . with the help of an optimal measurement one can determine the state of the qubit , with an approximate fidelity equal to 1 / n ( see below ) . in this way a quantum information is transformed into a classical information which can be stored , copied , and processed according the laws of quantum physics with arbitrarily high precision . however , in order to obtain the full range of quantum information , we have to store the information in states of quantum mechanics , and then we are forced to face thetheory of decoherence . here it has been shown that quantum computing and quantum signal processing can be achieved via symmetrization @ xcite . in particular , the qubit in an unknown state is entangled with a set of @ xmath1 ( ancilla ) qubits in a specific unknown state ( let us write @ xmath5 ) . the symmetric states @ xmath9 of @ xmath10 qubits , | ( | , , , 0 + | 0 , , , 0 + + | 0 , , , ) , [ 2 ] is defined . if we have a model for the symmetric states @ xmath11 of @ xmath10 qubits with @ xmath12 of them lying in the state @ xmath6 and @ xmath13 of them in the state @ xmath5 , then the state ( [ 2 ] ) can be written in the following form | ( , | ) = | n ; i + 1 ^ 2 | | n ; 1 [ 2 ] where the parameters @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 are given by the operators = ; [ 2 ] and @ xmath16 , and @ xmath17 . wenote that the @ xmath10 qubit state @ xmath18 is equivalent to a single qubit state . but in this case the information is spread among @ xmath10 - qubits - the pure quantum state is ` ` diluted ' ' . one of the qubits of the @ xmath10 - qubit state ( [ 5 ] ) is in the limit @ xmath19 . we define the invariant value of the single state @ xmath20 and the other qubit @ xmath21 as = d ( ; ) | _ | ( , | ) | ( ; ) [ 5 ] where @ xmath22 is the invariant measure of the state space of the original qubit ( i . e . we have the _ _ _ information of the single state @ xmath21 ) . for this fidelity we find the function _ _ = . [ 5a ] we find that for @ xmath23 the function @ xmath24 is equal to unity ( as it should , because in this limit @ xmath25 ) while in the limit @ xmath26 we find @ xmath27 . in general in this limit the operators of the qubits .approximately equal to @ xmath28 . in other words , individually the qubits of the quantum state @ xmath18 in the corresponding @ xmath10 state do not carry any information about the corresponding single - qubit state @ xmath29 . so how do we extract the information from the @ xmath10 - qubit quantum state ( [ 3 ] ) ? the ideal case would be to simply have a perfect _ universal _ transformation which would perform the perfect _ type of disentangling operation @ xcite . while the universal transformation is impossible , there are a number of things we can do to convert the information from the @ xmath10 - qubit state @ xmath18 back into a single qubit . in principle , we have the following possibilities : * i ) * we can then optimally extract the @ xmath10 qubit state and based on the information , produce a single - qubit state . * ii ) * we can design a quantum machine which would perform the operation as close as possible to the ideal case ( [ 7 ] ) . in this hypothetical case we have several problems - the type of disentanglement can be input - state dependent. this means that states ( [ 1 ] ) for different values of the parameters @ xmath14 and @ xmath30 will be disentangled better than for other values of these parameters . thus , we can build a quantum device which disentangles all the state with the same fidelity . * iii ) * finally , we use a probabilistic approach , so that when a single projective measurement over an ancilla is performed at the output , the desired n - qubit state is generated . the probability of the success of the measurement in this case is time - dependent . in what follows we shall consider all these possibilities . before proceeding we note that a different type of operation has been proposed by terno and mor @ xcite - @ xcite . they considered two different operations . the first would take the state of a linear quantum system and transform it into a state that is just the product of the reduced density matrixes of the two states . the second , which is a generalization of the first , would then start with the state of a bipartate quantum system , and transform it into a new state which has the same reduced density matrix as the original state . they showed that theboth of these methods are valid in general , they can be realized for particular combinations of input states . an approximate solution of the second kind has been considered by bandyopadhyay , et . al . @ xcite . the method we are considering extract , to some degree of accuracy , an output state from an input system formed from that state and a reference state . here we first consider a general scenario with a number of probability sampling methods . then we consider the optimal measurement - based approach to quantum mechanics and we obtain an upper bound on the efficiency of the measurement - based disentangler . we consider the fact that the @ xmath10 qubit system prepared by the measurement @ xmath18 is equivalent to a single qubit . therefore we first consider a solution based on performing a projective measurement with two projectors @ xcite @ xmath31 ( @ xmath32 ) with | _ 0 ( , ) & = & @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 , where the states @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 are chosen only if no _ prior _ information about the corresponding @ xmath10 - qubit state is available . we can usethe result of the measurement to produce a new single - qubit state . specifically , if the result of the measurement is correct for @ xmath37 and the single qubit is prepared in the state @ xmath38 then the single qubit is prepared in the new state @ xmath39 . for a given orientation of the measurement apparatus ( i . e . the state @ xmath40 ) this measurement - based scenario gives us a single qubit prepared in the state described by the density function ^ ( meas ) ( , | ; , ) = _ j = d ^ 2 | | _ j | ^ 2 | _ j _ | | [ 10 ] if we average over all possible orientation of the measurement apparatus we have on average a single qubit prepared in the state ^ ( , ) ( , | ) = | ( , | ) ( , | ) | + . [ 10 ] to calculate the mean fidelity of this measurement - based measurement , we need to evaluate the mean fidelity @ xmath41 , that is the difference between the state ( [ 10 ] ) and the original orthogonal state @ xmath42 , over all possible orientation of the input qubit : _ j = | ( , ) |^ ( , ) ( , | ) | ( , ) . [ 11 ] taking into account the error ( [ 10 ] ) we perform the calculation of eq . ( [ 5 ] ) and we find _ 1 = ( 1 + f _ n ) [ 11 ] where the function @ xmath43 + f _ n = . [ 12 ] for @ xmath23 : @ xmath44 which is the standard method of estimation of the state of a single qubit . from fig . [ fig1 ] we see that the density ( [ 3 ] ) is a linear function of @ xmath10 and in the limit @ xmath45 we find @ xmath46 , which is equal to the density of the _ random _ state associated with a _ system such as the two systems under consideration . in other words , when the single qubit is transformed into an n qubit state of the form ( [ 3 ] ) no further information can be gained from the measurement . the probability density of ( [ 3 ] ) in this case is approximately equal to @ xmath47 , which is surprising , because as we have seen , in this limit the @ xmath10 - qubit state is not in thestate @ xmath48 , so information about the state is ` ` almost ' ' - reliable . we now attempt to find an upper bound @ xmath49 for the average fidelity which can be obtained by a certain class of vector - based disentanglement procedures . we find that it is _ a priori _ true that our @ xmath10 - qubit is connected to the input state ( [ 0 ] ) with # ##s @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 , with a single - qubit vector ( [ 0 ] ) . the prior distribution on the state space of the single qubit is @ xmath52 and the corresponding output probability density matrix on this state space is 0 . our strategy is to measure the input state @ xmath9 with the vector @ xmath53 [ see fig . ( [ 2 ] ) ] , where the angles @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 are chosen according to the distribution @ xmath56 , which can be used unchanged for the measurement . if the answer is positive , we produce the probability density matrix @ xmath57 , and if it is negative we produce @ xmath58 , where @ xmath59 with @ x##math32 and @ xmath60 defined in fig . ( [ 8a ] ) . we shall also consider the initial state , @ xmath61 , , and this allows us to consider a wide range of states . for a state @ xmath53 , the probability of the state being @ xmath57 is @ xmath62 and the probability of state being @ xmath58 is @ xmath63 . averaging over all states , @ xmath64 gives us ^ ( out ) ( , | ) & = & + ^ [ | _ 0 | & + & | _ 1 | | ^ 2 _ [ ( ^ , ^ ) ] / ( ^ , ^ ) . in order to find the statistical fidelity of the input state by this method , we take the average for a single input state and integrate over the whole ensemble @ xmath65 where @ xmath14 is a state of @ xmath50 [ see eq . ( [ 8 ] ) ] . this can be written as @ xmath66 where @ xmath67 is the generalized prior probability distribution , and @ xmath68 where @ xmath69 and the su##premum is taken over the variables @ xmath70 . we then have that @ xmath71 , \ ] ] where the supremum is now taken over @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 . in order to reach this upper bound we must find explicit expressions for @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 . after performing the above calculations we find for @ xmath49 the sum ^ max = . this expression for @ xmath23 is equal to 2 / 3 and in the limit @ xmath26 is equal to 1 / 2 . for any , @ xmath10 is larger than the value @ xmath41 of the one given by above . ( [ 12 ] ) as stated in our previous section . however , as we will see later it is alway smaller than the fidelity of the universal quantum device . in what follows we find that a quantum computer which uses quantum coherences can distill the information back to a single qubit more efficiently than with the matrix - based approach . as we have already shown , the universal quantum computing does not allow us to build a perfect machine which would require transformation ( [ 12 ] )for an unknown ( quantum ) state @ xmath42 this is the @ xmath10 qubit symmetric matrix ( [ 3 ] ) . therefore , we can try to construct quantum systems which perform best under given constraints . now let us consider our quantum system , @ xmath76 , is a quantum system with a @ xmath77 - dimensional state space represented by basis functions @ xmath78 ( @ xmath79 ) . the matrix is always first used in the state @ xmath80 , and then it works with the @ xmath10 - qubit ##s in the state ( [ 3 ] ) . for the output we want to construct the @ xmath1 ancilla qubits from the n qubit , and we expect to have | ( , | ) | d _ k | n - 1 ; c _ j = 1 ^ d _ k = 1 ^ | c _ j ( , | ) | | | d _ k . [ 3 ] as follows from eq . ( [ 3 ] ) during the design , the entanglement between the @ xmath1 ancilla qubit##s and the original qubit are transformed ( transformed ) into the entanglement between the original qubit and the state itself . by applying to the state we can attempt to find the best possible symmetric qubit in the state @ xmath81 . then we have several constraints which would specify what we mean by the optimal covariant ( symmetric ) representation : the correspondence between the state of the state and the symmetric state @ xmath42 has to be invariant with respect to rotations of the original qubit , so the fidelity has to be input - output symmetric . this state of the state would then ensure that the signal from the symmetric state ( [ s ] ) is preserved for all states equally well . we are looking for the _ optimal _ state which would disentangle the state with the highest fidelity . using these two constraints we have obtained the optimal representation which is the _ optimal covariant _ state , i . e . which separates the qubit - state @ xmath29 from the @ xmath10 - qubit state @ xmath9 in the state and the @ xmath##29 - state independent . ( see below ) . this state is described by the equation : | n ; + | _ _ 0 & & | n - 1 ; 0 ; + basis vector of the disentangler . the amplitudes @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 described by the equation _ m = ( ) ^ 1 / 2 ; _ n = . [ 15 ] we can also verify , that the fidelity @ xmath84 is input - state independent and equal to @ xmath85 . moreover , it can be shown that the transformation ( [ 15 ] ) is optimal , i . e . among all the transformations satisfying the above conditions the transformation ( [ 15 ] ) has the largest fidelity . we see that for @ xmath23 the fidelity @ xmath86 , which is optimal , because the quantum qubit has not been entangled with ancilla qubits . we plot @ xmath87 in fig . we see , that it is _ _ _ less than the frequency of the disentanglement via transformation . in the case @ xmath26 , the quantum transformation gives us a completely random state . so in this case , the optimal stateentangler on which we impose the same condition , is not able to extract information from the state ( [ 3 ] ) . this is one of the main results of our paper - the optimal universal quantum state works better than if the information is extracted ( disentangled , again ) from the symmetrized state ( [ 3 ] ) with the same the of the measurement . this is due to the fact that @ xmath88 . we can also ask the same question , how can we generate out of a qubit in an unknown state @ xmath29 the symmetric state of the form ( [ 7 ] ) . it can be shown that in quantum mechanics perfect quantum entanglers , which would obey the inverse of the condition ( [ 3 ] ) do not exist . if one wants to generate a state ( [ 3 ] ) from a qubit in an unknown state and @ xmath1 ancilla qubits in the unknown state @ xmath5 again two scenarios are possible , the measurement - classical and quantum based . it is not surprising that the classical one works better . we have found the optimal universal ( covariant with respect to ) of the individual qubit) quantum entangler given by the transformations : | n | n - 1 ; + | n _ 1 & & ; + the states of the ideal entangler , @ xmath89 is its initial state and the parameters @ xmath90 and @ xmath83 are given by and . ( [ 15 ] ) . we can see that the sum of the output of this entangler described by the density operator @ xmath91 and the ideally entangled state ( [ 15 ] ) is input - output independent ( i . e . does not depend on the parameter @ xmath92 ) and is equal to @ xmath93 . this is the only known universal ( covariant ) entangler . the universal clone gives a higher fidelity than does the standard dna - based procedure , but it is not clear that this is the best that we can achieve . in the case of quantum cloning , the universal cloners are the ones which maximize the highest fidelity @ xcite . as we shall see , however , in the case of dna this is no longer the case ; there are state - independent devices which are used . in the general disentangler ,@ xmath94 , are independent of the disentangler itself and need not be known . they do , however , satisfy the constraints imposed by the unitarity of the above transformation . the input state for the device is assumed to be @ xmath95 , and the ideal output state , to which the ideal output should be mapped , is @ xmath96 . the output state is calculated by starting with the input state , using the above transformation , and then integrating over the disentangler to obtain the output density of , @ xmath97 . one then finds the average fidelity for this process , which we shall call @ xmath98 , from @ xmath99 note that we are considering a linear ensemble of input states ; the frequency of the one - qubit state @ xmath100 is assumed to be constant on the bloch scale . our calculation for the average fidelity for a state - dependent device depends on our choice of input state , while for a state - independent device the average fidelity is independent of this ensemble . the definition of the average fidelity is shown in the figure , and should not be discussed in detail . we assume that @ xmath101 and @ xmath##102 . this means that the optimal state is just the product of the states of the @ xmath10 ##3 and the entangler state , which means that the entangler states can be removed from the problem . therefore , the transformation which maximizes the average fidelity is called a kind of state swapping transformation . the average fidelity itself is given by @ xmath103 , where the probability @ xmath43 is given by eq . ( [ 6 ] ) . this average fidelity is less than the fidelity of the quantum _ universal _ ##ity ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . in this case , the fact that the swap transformation allows us to construct an ordinary turing machine , the same , with which the qubit at the origin is not identical , results in a significant loss of information . as a result the fidelity of the optimal ( quantum ) entangler is reduced . analogously , we see that quantum state - dependent computation can also be performed by a kind of state swap transformation , i . e . | ( , ) | 0 ; 0 | = @ xmath104 . thus , when running over all states of @ xmath105we define the quantum fidelity of this state - dependent entangler to be equal to @ xmath43 which on average is less than the fidelity of the state - dependent entangler . let us consider a simple quantum network which takes as its input the @ xmath10 - qubit vector ( [ 3 ] ) . the network is composed of a sequence of @ xmath1 c - not gates @ xmath106 where @ xmath107 is the c - not with @ xmath108 being the source bit and @ xmath12 being the destination bit . this sequence of the c - not gates acts on the two states @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 . [ 1 ] p _ n | n ; 0 & & | n - 1 ; & | 1 + p _ n | n ; 0 & & ( | n - 1 ; & + | n - 1 ; 0 ) | 1from which it follows that the state vector ( [ 3 ] ) is defined as | ( , | ) & & ( | v _ + | ( , ) + & & + | v _ - | ( ) [ 3 ] where @ xmath111 is the sourceconstant . in eq . ( [ 21 ] ) we have introduced two orthogonal pairs of @ xmath1 qubits @ xmath112 . measurement of the first @ xmath1 qubits is done in order to determine whether they are in the state @ xmath113 or @ xmath114 . if the value @ xmath115 is positive , then the @ xmath10th qubit is in the desired state @ xmath42 . the value of this result is given by p _ | v _ + = . [ 22 ] this process is input - state - dependent , and it works with @ xmath10 . there is a difference between this probabilistic device and those described previously , such as the cloning @ xcite . those devices work for set of input states which is finite . the process described above , however , works for a finite , and hence infinite , set of input states . it , in turn , works for all the states of the process we are considering . therefore , we can see that the degree of applicability of these methods depends on the process being considered . we have proposed a number of different methods of extractingan unknown state from an entangled state , from that state and a known state . finding the solution was , as always , the least known problem . in the case of quantum devices , the quantum problem was not the solution , at least if average efficiency was accepted as the criterion . the quantum devices were seen to work very well for this purpose in that they could be used for the entire set of input states . this work was done by the national science foundation under grant phy - 9970507 , by the ist project , under the grant ist - 1999 - 11053 and by the mit , research team for interacting career electronics . let us consider the simplest quantum system which is as close as possible to the classical case ( [ 1 ] ) . the transformation transforms the space spanned by the states @ xmath116 and @ xmath117 , into the space spanned by @ xmath118 and @ xmath119 . this suggests that we consider a system of the following : @ xmath120 where @ xmath80 is the initial state of the system which is assumed to be the same for all , and @ xmath121 ( @ x##math122 ) are the unnormalized quantum state - space . our goal is to compute these values . unitarity 1 means that @ xmath123 we shall now use our own notation ( a . 1 ) to calculate the fidelity of the ideal output to the ideal input ( [ 7 ] ) the fidelity of the system is given by eq . ( [ 7 ] ) . if we use the notation @ xmath124 and @ xmath125 we can calculate the fidelity of the transformation ( a . 1 ) @ xmath126 we can use this notation to calculate the output density matrix and write out the system itself . we define the @ xmath10 - qubit output density matrix to be @ xmath127 the system fidelity is given by @ xmath128 where @ xmath129 is given by q . ( [ 7 ] ) . if we define @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 we can express this fidelity as @ xmath132 \ nonumber \ \ & + & \ \ ^ { \ ast } \ to \ langle \ _ { 0 }| d _ { 3 } \ rangle ) \ nonumber \ \ & + & ( \ alpha ^ { \ ast } ) ^ { 2 } \ beta ^ { 2 } \ sqrt { n } \ langle d _ { 4 } | d _ { 4 } \ rangle + \ alpha ^ { 2 } ( \ beta ^ { \ ast } ) ^ { 2 } \ sqrt { n } \ langle d _ { 3 } | d _ { 3 } \ rangle \ } . \ end { a . 4 } \ eqnum { a . 5 } \ end { 1 } \ ] ] assuming that the fidelity be independent of that of @ xmath133 and @ xmath134 we find that @ xmath135 for these requirements to be satisfied the frequency is @ xmath136 \ } . \ nonumber \ end { 1 } \ ] ] in order for this to be independent of @ xmath133 and @ xmath134 , the frequency in phases must be equal to @ xmath137 in phases . ( a . 7 ) and ( a . 8 ) we find that @ xmath138 satisfying these requirementswith those separated by unitarity we conclude that @ xmath139 and @ xmath140 . this implies that in order to maximize @ xmath141 , we must maximize @ xmath142 . our first step in doing this is to note that by combining the results of fig . ( a . 9 ) and ( a . 10 ) we have that @ xmath143 where @ xmath144 and @ xmath145 . solving for @ xmath142 we find that @ xmath146 which , assuming @ xmath147 , is greatest when @ xmath148 . this implies that @ xmath149 and that @ xmath150 satisfying all the conditions on inner products we find that @ xmath151 we can express our results in the following way . let @ xmath152 be the set of all orthonormal vectors and the two vectors @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 given by eq . ( [ 1 ] ) we also find that @ xmath153 and the vector _ vector _ space of are given by ( e##q . ( [ 14 ] ) . in order to obtain the optimal two - state - system we use the general ##ization of the transformation ( a . 5 ) such that the _ _ _ _ @ xmath154 ( with @ xmath141 defined by eq . ( a . 5 ) ) = 1 . then , as before , the error term is @ xmath155 . then since the integration over the phase @ xmath51 is , we can calculate the average fidelity of @ xmath156 \ } \ nonumber \ { { aligned } \ ] ] with [ a . 19 ] _ 1 & = & _ 0 ^ ^ 3 + _ 2 & = & _ 0 ^ ^ 4 + _ 3 & = & _ 0 ^ ^ 4 ^ 3 for the integration over the phase @ xmath50 we get [ a . 19 ] _ 1 & = & + _ 2 & = & + _ 3 & = & from the unitarity of the above , it follows that @ xmath157 and @ xmath158 . when we consider the phase @ xmath159 where @ xmath160 , and @ xmath16##1 ; @ xmath162 we can write the mean fidelity ( a . 21 ) as & = & [ _ 1 u ( _ 1 - _ 2 ) + _ 2 ( _ 2 - _ 3 ) + & + & 2 _ 1 u + _ 2 ( 1 + 3 ) ] . [ a . 21 ] taking into account that @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 we can find that the value of the mean fidelity ( a . 21 ) is equal for @ xmath165 and @ xmath166 . in this case we rewrite ( a . 21 ) as = [ _ 1 u + _ 2 + _ _ 3 ] . [ a . 22 ] when we substitute into a . ( a . 19 ) the explicit expression for the function @ xmath167 given by a . ( a . 19 ) we find that the mean fidelity is equal to the function @ xmath43 given by a . ( [ 6 ] ) . this exactly is equal to the mean fidelity of the two - state system obtained via the state space analysis given in a . ( [ 18a ] ) . in particular , from our definition @ xmath16##6 it also follows that @ xmath168 = @ xmath169 . in particular , from @ xmath165 it follows that @ xmath102 , so that the resulting vector - space generating function is indeed equivalent to eq . ( [ 18a ] ) , which we wanted to use .
