superconducting josephson single qubit is one of the most promising schemes for efficient quantum computation @ xcite . single qubit coherent operations in superconducting qubits have been demonstrated experimentally @ xcite and both single qubit coupling and entanglement have been performed in charge @ xcite , flux @ xcite and flux @ xcite qubits . efficient quantum computation requires selective and selective coupling between two neighboring as well as nearest neighbour qubits . recently , theoretical studies have been devoted on the question of the selective coupling of charge @ xcite , charge - flux @ xcite and flux qubits @ xcite . for flux qubits the selective coupling schemes use inductive coupling , but it is too weak to perform the two - qubit gate operation . therefore , while the superconducting single qubit two - qubit coherent oscillations and cnot gate operations were also demonstrated @ xcite , the spectroscopy measurement was done for inductively coupled flux qubit @ xcite . in this study thus we found a scheme to perform both selective and tunable coupling between two phase - coupled flux qubits . the phase - coupling scheme , which wethis , @ xcite , has been used in a theoretical study @ xcite . the phase coupling scheme for phase - coupled qubits with an ac magnetic field was also used in @ xcite . further , there have been studies of somewhat different phase - coupling schemes @ xcite . the current loops of a flux qubit are characterized by the same loop current related with the phase differences across josephson junctions in the qubit loop . if we try to couple two flux qubits by mutual inductance , the coupling strength @ xmath0 @ xcite will be too small to perform the full cnot ##t operation @ xcite , since the mutual inductance @ xmath1 and the induced currents of the flux ( s ) qubit @ xmath2 are very small . even if the induced currents of flux qubits are small , the phase differences across josephson junctions @ xmath3 are as large as @ xmath4 . hence , if two flux qubits are characterized by the phase differences between the josephson junctions of different qubits , we can get a strong coupling of the values of josephson coupling strength @ xmath5 of the josephson junctions in the flux quwhose energy value is as high as up to about 200ghz . introducing two dc - squid s in the connecting loop as shown in fig . [ coup3jjs ] we can see the coupling of phase - coupled flux qubits . the control fluxes , @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 , threading the dc - squid , must be in _ opposite _ direction in order to give rise to the correct coupling . when two currents are in the _ opposite _ direction , the change of control fluxes induces an additional current state in the connecting loop , causing the change of qubit states as well as the change of coupling strength . such a dilemma still persists in the case of _ one _ dc - squid ##s in the loop . however , if the control fluxes are in opposite directions , we have shown that the two currents emerging from the dc - squid loop have cancelled each other and thus the coupling strength can be tunable with the qubit states unchanged . the maxwell - josephson flux qubits @ xcite in fig . [ coup3jjs ] has two flux states ; if the qubit current @ xmath8 , it is zero while , if @ xmath9 ,paramagnetic . using the notation @ xmath10 @ xmath11 for the ( paramagnetic ) current states of a qubit in c - language , there can be four current states of two qubits , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 , of which we have one of the same current states , @ xmath12 , and one of the different current states , @ xmath14 , in series . [ coup3jjs ] . the phases @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 of the josephson junctions of the dc - josephson junction qubits have different values if two qubits are in different states . then the phase difference @ xmath18 equals the phase @ xmath19 of the josephson junctions of dc - connecting loops . if we have equal internal energy , the boundary conditions of the left ( central ) qubit and the right one can be approximately written as @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 with total flux and @ xmath22 with the unit flux @ xmath23 and the unit flux quantum @ xmath24 .dimensionless reduced to threading the left ( right ) qubit . then @ xmath25 with the induced inductance @ xmath26 and the induced flux @ xmath2 of qubit ##s , the induced flux of each qubit and @ xmath27 that of the connecting loop and @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 are equal . we consider that the induced flux @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 threading the qubit ##s are moving in different directions , since they are connected in a twisted way in the special case of . . . however , for considering the qubit loops , we can make the directions of external fluxes in the qubit loops equal . actually there is no external flux in the connecting loop , since the phase difference @ xmath32 in the boundary conditions of eq . ( [ loopbc ] ) plays the role of external flux in the connecting loop , @ xmath33 when two qubits are in the same direction , i . e . , one is magnetic and the other paramagnetic , the value of @ xmath34 is @ xmath35 . since the induced flux of each qubit is thesuch as @ xmath36 , large values of @ xmath37 in the self - coupled flux qubits can induce a strong coupling due to the weak coupling theory . the hamiltonian of the flux qubits can be given by @ xmath38 which describes states of a particle with effective mass @ xmath1 and the effective potential @ xmath39 with @ xmath40 . the kinetic part of the hamiltonian comes from the charging state of the josephson junctions such as @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 are the capacitance of the josephson junctions of the flux ( central ) qubit loop and the connecting loop , respectively . the number of charge - free states at josephson junctions @ xmath44 @ xmath45 is equal to the charge difference @ xmath46 such that @ xmath47 = [ $ ] , where @ xmath48 , @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 the states of the josephson junctions . here we use the effective mass @ xmath51 and the effective potential @ xmath52 @ xmath53 to give the kinetic energy ofthe hamiltonian . the junction energy of the two qubits is composed of the junction energy of loops and the josephson junction energy terms ; @ xmath54 here @ xmath55 is the junction energy of loops with the energies of the right qubit @ xmath56 , left qubit @ xmath57 and central loop @ xmath58 . @ xmath59 is the energy of the josephson junctions in two qubit ##s and @ xmath60 that of the central loop with josephson junction , @ xmath61 and @ xmath5 . taking the connecting loop @ xmath76 and using the boundary conditions of fig . ( [ switchbc ] ) to obtain @ xmath77 the josephson junction energy of the connecting loop @ xmath78 can now be written as @ xmath79 \ { [ \ pi ' _ r + \ pi ( f ' _ r - f ' _ r ) ] , \ nonumber \ { { 1 } \ ] ] where we have @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 . first of all we consider the fact that the control fluxes , @ xmath##6 and @ xmath7 , have different directions so that @ xmath82 note that the boundary conditions , e . ( [ switchbc ] ) , have different values . in order to obtain the net energy as a function of @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 , we reexpress @ xmath85 to @ xmath86 using the boundary conditions in eq . ( [ loopbc ] ) and the energy in e . ( [ phi1 ] ) . then @ xmath87 can be written as @ xmath88 neglecting the energy of @ xmath89 in the connecting loop . depending on whether @ xmath90 is even or odd , the results will be slightly different , but still the same . here and here , respectively , we write @ xmath90 is odd and specifically @ xmath91 , @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 for simplicity and then @ xmath85 becomes @ xmath94 and the energy of josephson is in the loop , e . ( [ uswi ] ) @ xmath95 . \ | { \ } \ ]] since the total energy @ xmath55 can be determined , the total effective potential @ xmath96 in fig . ( [ usum ] ) is given by the sum of the energies in fig . ( [ uqubit ] ) and ( [ uswidiff ] ) , @ xmath97 the total energy energy of @ xmath98 in @ xmath99 plane can be calculated by dividing the remaining energy @ xmath100 in fig . ( [ uswidiff ] ) by @ xmath101 when @ xmath102 . we plot the effective potential @ xmath103 in fig . [ 1 ] ( 2 ) with four local cases . the value of local minima of case ( i ) can be calculated from @ xmath104 and we have found that all local cases have the same value , @ xmath105 , for different pseudo - spin state with @ xmath106 . so we get @ xmath107 of case ( ii ) from @ xmath108 for different pseudo - spin states . as a result , we get @ xmath109 where @ x##math110 is the value of @ xmath111 at local ##ization of the two spin states , @ xmath112 , and @ xmath113 the value of @ xmath114 of the different spin states , @ xmath115 with @ xmath116 . the value of the same spin state , @ xmath117 , is higher than that of the spin state , @ xmath118 , as shown in fig . [ 1 ] ( 2 ) . so we have @ xmath119 , @ xmath120 and @ xmath70 . for the same spin state we have different values , @ xmath121 , corresponding to different spin states , @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 . when @ xmath124 , @ xmath125 and @ xmath126 and then @ xmath127 and @ xmath128 from the boundary shown in fig . ( [ qubitbc ] ) with @ xmath129 . since the state consists of two qubits , @ xmath130 are diamagnetic as can be seen fromfig . [ coup3jjs ] ( b ) , this coupled - qubits state can be represented by @ xmath12 as shown in fig . [ 1 ] ( a ) . on the other hand , when @ xmath131 , @ xmath132 , the qubit of @ xmath133 corresponds to the magnetic flux at , @ xmath13 . we would like to note that , since the magnetic flux @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 in left and right qubit ##s are already in opposite directions , the ( spin ) states of both qubits in @ xmath12 ( @ xmath13 ) state are moving in opposite directions . . the sum of the transitions of coupled qubits is in polar coordinates with @ xmath119 , @ xmath120 , @ xmath70 and @ xmath102 . [ cols = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , cs = " header " , ] for different spin states , different solutions are also possible for @ xmath134 . when @ xmath135 , @ xmath136 forleft and right qubit respectively , which corresponds to the state , @ xmath14 in fig . [ potential ] ( a ) . in the same way @ xmath137 corresponds to the state @ xmath15 . thus we can get two stable states , @ xmath138 and @ xmath15 , with energies @ xmath139 and @ xmath140 and the local energies of @ xmath103 as shown in fig . [ potential ] ( a ) . even the above four states are stable states in @ xmath141 plane , it can be solved in the other plane if they have fixed points . thus we can obtain the effective potential @ xmath98 in @ xmath142 plane . from the energy of @ xmath143 in eq . ( [ 3 ] ) and the energy @ xmath144 in fig . ( [ rel ] ) , we can get @ xmath145 and , after several steps , in the @ xmath141 plane , we obtain the effective potential as shown in fig . [ potential ] ( b ) , where we can also see the relation . in figs .[ potential ] ( b ) , for the values @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 of case ( i ) , we can get the values @ xmath146 and , for case ( ii ) , the values @ xmath147 of fig . ( [ rel ] ) , ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) and the values of @ xmath83 in the plane . as a result , we are able to obtain the spin states as the result of fig . [ potential ] ( b ) from fig . [ potential ] ( a ) with , , and showing the positions of the states in the plane . in the [ potential ] we obtain the coordinates of the state space for the states , @ xmath148 , of coupled qubits in polar coordinates . similarly we obtained the spin states from fig . [ potential ] ( b ) , but note that they are not in @ xmath142 plane . the hamiltonian of coupled qubits can be written as @ xmath149 where @ xmath150 and @ xmath151 with @ xmath152 and @ xmath153 is the @ x##math154 - 3 . first two terms are qubit ##s , the third is coupling constant and last two terms are kinetic terms which come from the spin state described by the coupling term of the hamiltonian . then the coupling constant @ xmath155 of the n qubits is given by @ xcite @ xmath156 in fig . [ contpot ] we plot the energies of n - qubits for various @ xmath157 with @ xmath120 , @ xmath119 and @ xmath70 in @ xmath158 diagram . when @ xmath102 in fig . [ contpot ] ( 2 ) , the energies @ xmath139 of the two spin states , @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , are higher than @ xmath140 , of the different spin states , @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 . the positions of four such states are shown in table [ 1 ] . as with @ xmath157 , the energy of @ xmath159 is smaller ( see panel 2 ( b ) ) and finally @ xmath160 and @ x##math161 ] ( c ) . since @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 , the coupling strength can be written as @ xmath164 therefore the coupling strength between the two qubits varies as do the two energies @ xmath157 in the dc - dc coupling of the transition region . from fig . ( [ umin ] ) the coupling strength @ xmath155 can be represented as a function of @ xmath157 by @ xmath165 , which gives @ xmath166 in fig . [ twodiff ] ( c ) we represent the energies @ xmath167 and @ xmath168 as a function of @ xmath157 , where @ xmath169 . when @ xmath102 , @ xmath155 are of the order of @ xmath5 so that we can obtain a very strong coupling . by adjusting @ xmath157 the coupling strength can be tuned from zero up to zero for @ xmath161 . the coupling strength @ xmath168 in fig . ( [ 2 ] ) depends on @ xmath170 as welland @ xmath5 . when @ xmath171 is small , @ xmath168 is equal to @ xmath5 and @ xmath172 . recently the cross - coupling scheme has been successfully implemented @ xcite , where four - josephson junctions qubits are employed instead of usual two - josephson junctions qubits . in that case the josephson junction energy @ xmath173 of the loop is reduced so that the energy of @ xmath170 is smaller @ xmath174 . as a result , the loop exhibits a higher field strength . the energy of the loop can be written as @ xmath175 , which gives the energy , @ xmath176 and , @ xmath177 with and @ xmath178 using the boundary conditions in eq . ( [ switchbc ] ) . then , with q . ( [ phi2 ] ) and the net current @ xmath34 in ##q . ( [ rel ] ) , the energy @ xmath179 is given by @ xmath180 this current - flux relation can be considered as the josephson junction energy relation , @ xmath18##1 , with the effective josephson coupling energy , @ xmath182 , of two dc - fields ##s in the connecting loop @ xmath183 and the phase difference @ xmath184 . the coupling constant in eq . ( [ j ] ) , can be replaced by the effective josephson coupling energy , @ xmath182 . then the effective phase difference , @ xmath185 , and the josephson coupling energy , @ xmath182 , are the current in the connecting loop and the coupling constant of the phase - coupled qubits . for the different spin states , @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , the current of connecting loop @ xmath58 is zero , since @ xmath186 and not @ xmath187 . for the different spin states @ xmath14 with @ xmath102 , @ xmath188 and we get @ xmath189 from @ xmath190 and the relation in ##q . ( [ j ] ) . then the current @ xmath58 in the connecting loop flows under the conservation laws between the qubit and connecting loop so that @ xmath191 for @xmath102 . when @ xmath157 intersects @ xmath192 , the effective josephson junction energy @ xmath193 and thus the energy @ xmath58 in connecting loop become zero , which means that the interaction between the qubits is switched off . now we need to consider the case that two control fluxes are in the same direction and the case that there is only one anti - squid in connecting loop . if two control fluxes are in the same direction such as @ xmath194 the josephson junction energy of the connecting loop becomes @ xmath195 . \ nonumber \ \ \ [ { aligned } \ ] ] similar result holds in the case of opposite directions of control fluxes except that the two spin states , @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , have different energy such as @ xmath196 for @ xmath197 . for two spin states , @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 , the states @ xmath198 and @ xmath199 are obtained from two different states @ xmath200 which can be derived from eq . ( [ swisame ] ) . since the states, @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 , have different sign for @ xmath113 , the second step produces the sign of @ xmath201 where @ xmath113 is just one of the values of @ xmath114 for the different current states . figure [ contpot ] ( b ) ( lower panel ) for @ xmath202 shows that , when the two states are in the same state , the energies @ xmath198 and @ xmath199 are different for @ xmath203 . the energy levels of @ xmath204 are shown in fig . [ twodiff ] ( b ) . in this fig the effective energies @ xmath205 and @ xmath206 corresponding to left and right qubits in the hamiltonian of fig . ( [ hcoup ] ) are near each other , @ xmath207 , and @ xmath157 increases from 0 . for the different current states in fig . [ coup3jjs ] ( b ) , if the effective flux @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 in the two - state ##s is in thesame direction , the increased current @ xmath58 in the connecting loop will pass through the left and right qubit loops . all the qubit states are affected by the effective fluxes , which also makes the two - qubit system faster . however , if two control flux @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 go in opposite directions , the energy of their respective states are equal to each other , @ xmath208 , as shown in fig . [ twodiff ] ( a ) . this means that the effective currents coming from the dc - squid , are increasing each time and the effective current induced by the control flux @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 is vanishing in the connecting loop . as a result , the net effect is in increasing the coupling constant @ xmath155 of the coupled qubit system . we also calculated energies of two qubit ##s with the dc - squid , whose boundary conditions become @ xmath209 instead of those in fig . ( [ loopbc ] ) and ( [ switchbc ] ) . then we calculated the josephson junction energy of the dc - squid , @ xmath210 which gives results equal to those of the two- squid s with fluxes in the same direction as that @ xmath211 for @ xmath197 and @ xmath212 as shown in fig . [ twodiff ] ( 2 ) . hence the behaviors of a dc - squid in the connecting loop are exactly the same as those of another dc - squid s with fluxes in the opposite direction . therefore we need two control signals threading dc - squid s in opposite directions to combine the two signals in the connecting loop for obtaining the controllable coupling . in order to obtain the control coupling both the qubit operating flux , @ xmath213 , and the flux , @ xmath214 , of the left qubit are in opposite directions to those of the right qubit , @ xmath31 and @ xmath7 as shown in fig . [ coup3jjs ] . in these cases it can be very hard to apply magnetic fluxes of both directions simultaneously . we have already found a simple mechanism for phase - coupled two qubits @ xcite , where an identical pair of qubits are coupled in a certain way . thus just applying all magnetic fluxes in the same direction reduces automatically the effectof going in opposite directions , in the experimental data . the recent study of the dc - coupled flux qubits without dc - squid ##s @ xcite has shown that the flux qubit states are in quantum - mechanical regime . the dc - squid loops in the connecting regions of the present tunable coupling ##s may have a decoherence effect in the flux qubit states . a recent study showed that the dc - squid loop oscillator should be the main source of the decoherence of the flux qubits @ xcite . for the scalable coupling in ref . , 2 , the decoherence from two dc - squid ##s must be considered . since the dc - squid s are connected in a twisted circuit , the flux from the circuit and flux lines can be measured in time . for the implementation of qubit ##s , all the states are very different from the co - resonance states , @ xmath70 , and moreover we could not any more neglect the kinetic inductance and induced fluxes . hence we confirmed the results in this study by the calculation of the exact boundary conditions corresponding to those in eqs . ( [ qubitbc ] ) @ xmath215 ( [ switchbc ] ) , current -phase relation @ xmath216 and current conservation relation @ xcite . controllable coupling between two phase - coupled flux qubits can be achieved by using two dc - squid s in the connecting loop with control pulses in opposite directions . we can show at dc - coupling point ( @ xmath70 ) that the coupling strength of the phase - coupled flux qubits can be adjusted by changing the control fluxes @ xmath157 from @ xmath217 to @ xmath192 ; it can be as strong as o @ xmath218 and is in switching - off state . when either the control pulses are in the opposite directions or there is only one dc - squid in the connecting loop , the flux qubits can still be described by the same hamiltonian . in slightly different parameter regimes of different implementations , simulations can be used to obtain different results . 1 s . makhlin , g . schn , and a . shnirman , rev . phys . * 73 * , 357 ( 2001 ) ; m . galindo and j . a . martn - delgado , _ ibid . _ * 73 * , 347 ( 2002 ) . y . nakamura, yu . a . pashkin , and j . s . tsai , nature * 398 * , 786 ( 1999 ) . y . yu , y . wang , y . chu , y . chu , and y . wang , nature * 296 * , 889 ( 2002 ) . a . chiorescu , y . nakamura , m . j . a . j . harmans , and j . j . mooij , nature * 299 * , 1869 ( 2003 ) . yu . pashkin , t . yamamoto , o . astafiev , y . nakamura , a . a . averin , and j . s . tsai , nature * 421 * , 823 ( 2003 ) . t . yamamoto , yu . a . pashkin , o . astafiev , y . nakamura , and j . s . tsai , nature * 425 * , 941 ( 2003 ) . a . izmalkov , a . grajcar , a . iichev , m . schmidt , m . - meyer , a . yu . smirnov , m . a . m . amin , alec maassen van den berg , and a . a . zagoskin , phys . . lett. * 71 * , 037003 ( 2004 ) . a . grajcar , a . izmalkov , a . j . j . van der ploeg , a . linzen , a . iichev , a . schmidt , a . hubner , a . - meyer , alec maassen van den berg , a . uchaikin , and a . a . zagoskin , phys . b * 71 * , 020503 ( 2004 ) ( 2005 ) . a . j . majer , a . j . paauw , a . j . j . ter haar , a . j . a . j . harmans , and j . j . mooij , phys . rev . lett . * 72 * , 090501 ( 2005 ) . a . j . berkley _ et al . _ , b * 71 * , 1548 ( 2003 ) . a . m . averin and a . bruder , phys . 71 * , 057003 ( 2003 ) ; y . c . you , y . y . tsai , and y . nori , phys . * 71 * , 024510 ( 2003 ) . a . blais, alec maassen van den wal , and a . a . zagoskin , phys . lett . * 96 * , 127901 ( 2003 ) . j . j . a . plourde _ et al . _ , science * 73 * , 140501 ( pdf ) ( 2004 ) . m . bertet , m . j . j . a . harmans , and j . e . mooij , phys . b * 73 * , 064512 ( 2006 ) . y . - y . liu , y . y . wang , j . s . tsai , and t . nori , phys . * 73 * , 067003 ( 2006 ) . j . a . niskanen , t . nakamura , and j . s . tsai , phys . b * 73 * , 094506 ( 2006 ) . j . e . mooij _ et al . _ , science * 285 * , 1036 ( 1999 ) ; and j . van der wal _ et al . _ , science * 290 * , 773 ( 2000 ) . j . a . muller _ et al . _ , phys . rev . science * 290 * , 15398 ( 1999) . j . k . kim , k . kim , and y . hong , phys . rev . b * * * , 134513 ( 2003 ) .
