the study of quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of a black hole ( s ) has a history @ xcite . the reason behind this history is that the qnms is a simple way of studying the key aspects of the physics of very large objects , without the requirements of the full and general relativity theory . for example , by comparing the previously mentioned gravitational qnms with the description of the gravitational waves , one can confirm or refute the existence of the wave modes of many massive objects , since those modes exist for the different types of massive black holes , superspinars ( naked eye ) , neutron stars , black hole clusters etc . @ xcite . to obtain the qnms , one has to solve the first - order linear differential equations describing the various perturbations of the system : the regge - wheeler equation ( rwe ) and the zerilli equation for the schwarzschild metric or the teukolsky differential equation ( tre ) for the kerr metric and to set the appropriate boundary conditions the so - called black hole boundary conditions ( waves travelling up into the sky and into space ) @ xcite . finally , one sets a regularity condition for the angular coordinates of the solutions. and finally , one needs to solve a connected system with two complex spectral parameters the frequency @ xmath2 and the second frequency @ xmath3 ( @ xmath4 , for a nonrotating system , with @ xmath5 the angular momentum of the system ) . this problem was first solved by chandrasekhar & detweiler @ xcite and teukolsky & press @ xcite and later solved with the use of continued fractions by others @ xcite . for more detailed results , see also @ xcite . because of the complexity of the spectral equations , until now , those equations were solved either approximately or without meeting an boundary condition @ xcite . the numerical approaches like the continued fraction ##s have some limitations and are not directly concerned with the solution of the problem . the rwe , the zerilli , and tre , respectively , can be solved analytically in terms of confluent heun functions , as done for the first time in @ xcite . imposing the boundary conditions on those equations _ directly _ ( @ @ xcite ) one finds a system of spectral equations and finds the confluent heun functions which can be solved directly . in this case , forthe second time we present the @ xmath5 and @ xmath2 _ _ _ in the search for gravitational waves @ xmath6 with a schwarzschild metric , i . e . we solve the rwe and tre analytically in terms of the heun function and we use a newly developed method ( the one - dimensional generalization of the mller method described in the original research report @ xcite ) to find the solutions of two transcendental equations with two complex variables . then we use the same method to determine the values of the solutions with respect to small changes in the initial condition . the results are compared with previously - published results and are found to coincide with at least 8 digits for the rwe and 12 digits for the tre . for the first time , the so - called algebraically special mode @ xmath0 is evaluated with precision of less than 6 digits , and it is shown to have a nonzero imaginary part . this result establishes the hypothetical dependence of this mode with the algebraically special once . also evident is the nontrivial dependence on @ xmath1 of the last 11 digits in both cases . the corresponding equation for both cases is the solution of the teuk##olsky radial equations when there is no rotation ( @ xmath7 ) : @ xmath8 where @ xmath9 $ ] is the rotation . the solution for the qnms should be independent of the value of @ xmath10 in the above sequence . for our numerical solution , we use @ xmath11 . the general solution of the radial equations is derived from the solutions of the rwe and tre written in terms of the confluent heun functions corresponding to @ xcite , for which the black hole boundary conditions have been imposed . the formulation of the numerical solution in terms of the heun functions takes into account the boundary conditions on the horizon . however , it fails to impose the same boundary conditions on the actual infinity ( for details see @ xcite ) : @ xmath12 where @ xmath13 is the same heun function as used in maple and the parameters @ xmath14 differ for the two equations . the values of the solutions when the bh function is @ xmath15 and , if we use @ xmath16 which turns out to be small enough to simulate on the actual infinity , are ( @ xcite ) : 1 . for the solutions ofthe regge - wheeler case : @ xmath17 2 . for the case of the teukolsky radial equation : @ xmath18 where @ xmath19 is the time constant . the parameters are found by using the teukolsky radial equation and substituting @ xmath20 and they are clearly different from those for the regge - wheeler case . therefore , it is necessary to check whether both methods yield the same results for qnm and with what precision . for values of the parameter @ xmath21 of this case , the von heun function @ xmath22 has branching points in the real x - direction at the branch points @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 . in the second case , as the branch cut is in the non - infinite interval @ xmath25 on the x axis . the presence of the branch cut may lead to the existence of some modes and their derivatives , since by changing the value of the independent variable @ xmath26 , we may make a change to another sheet of the multivalued function . to do this , we use the epsilon function with which we can find the correct sheet and write on it . this is done by making asmall change ( @ xmath27 ) in the phase condition @ xmath28 ( defined by the direction of gradient ##s , see @ xcite ) , with which one can move the resulting cuts farther from the origin and thus remove the first term in the function . for more information on the epsilon method and the corresponding algorithm , see @ xcite . from the radial coordinates , it is known that it can be solved explicitly without changing the system and and the values of @ xmath5 are known : @ xmath29 . in this case , only the minimum value , @ xmath30 , is needed to solve the qnms with the radial equations . one can then either solve only the radial equations or change the systems and with the appropriate choice of the system . if one treats the problem as a two - dimensional system , making it with 15 digits of precision ( and 32 of floating - point digits ) , one gets as expected , @ xmath31 with the only digit different from digit 3 being the 17th . the numerical results for the frequencies are given in table [ table1 ] . . the table of the values obtained for the qnms of schwarzschild black holes using the regge -wheeler equation and the teukolsky equation . the modes with @ xmath32 are found for @ xmath33 , modes from @ xmath34 with @ xmath35 . the last three modes ( @ xmath36 ) were found independently by fiziev in @ xcite using exact values of rwe in the heun table [ options = " < , < , < , < " , options = " header " , ] from the table , we can see that the frequencies from the two versions of tre correspond with at least two modes . a comparison between the rwe frequency and the frequency published by andersson @ xcite , also in @ xcite shows that the difference between the two frequencies is less than @ xmath37 in both cases and is according to the numerical approach . there are two important results from this study . first , as seen from the [ table1 ] for both the rwe and the tre , the mode 1 always has a small but nonzero real part . according to the numerical approach this frequency should be equal to @ xmath38 @ xcite , with an almost zero real part , if it is to belong to the so - called _ algebraically _ _ _ . algebraic##ally special ( as ) modes have a special value in the qnm of @ xcite . the andersson model is not suitable for them and these are excluded from his consideration . berti , cardoso and starinets ( @ xcite ) give a comment on the results so far concerning these modes . " the 9th mode ( @ xmath0 ) should be purely imaginary with = @ xmath39 , if it exactly corresponds to the as case . from our perspective , even though the imaginary modes do not pose a problem for the tre , the real part of the as mode is still not zero , and it has at least two extra digits when = @ xmath1 in the cases discussed above for the rwe and tre . this clearly shows that this mode does not agree with the hypothesis for the as case , which is to be expected since the as modes should correspond to the boundary of those of the so - called totally - transmission modes ( @ xcite . the second important issue is the dependence of the values @ xmath40 on @ xmath1 . the direction of steepest descent is assumed to be the optimal direction in which the modes satisfy the black hole boundary conditions on infinity in the first case . for asymptotic seriesfor the heun functions @ xcite . the problem of steepest descent method in its general form for the differential equations in both cases and variations in this form , however , is still an open problem presented here for the first time . using the @ xmath1 method , one can find the intervals for @ xmath1 into which each mode can be found . the results for the rwe and tre , as expected , converge . generally , the intervals into which each mode can be found narrow down when using @ xmath41 . thus for the first 5 modes it is possible to find @ xmath42 for positive and negative values of @ xmath1 in a given interval , as follows : for @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 $ ] , for @ xmath45 $ ] , for @ xmath46 $ ] , for @ xmath47 $ ] , for @ xmath48 $ ] , where the first sign refers to modes with a positive real part and the second sign to those with negative real parts . the real parts for the interval @ xmath41 [ . ] for @ xmath49 , ( for @ xmath50 ) the modes with a positive real part canis found only for the case of @ xmath1 , and the dependency becomes @ xmath51 . for @ xmath0 , the dependency has similar behavior with respect to @ xmath1 for @ xmath52 $ ] , one finds the dependency with _ _ _ _ , and vice versa : ( @ xmath53 ) . the already - found solution @ xmath54 needs to be examined further . for the solution @ xmath55 , similar ( to some extent ) behavior was found earlier in @ xcite ( and later in @ xcite ) . it is suggested that there are two as ##es which are related to the real axis and they can be found with the branch cut in the asymptotic of the rwe , when @ xmath2 is not symmetrical . using the @ xmath1 method related to the asymptotics of the confluent heun functions , one can directly find the place of the branch cut on the real axis as a function of @ xmath1 and they can be easily found plotting the solution @ xmath56 . however , the combination of the confluent heun functions and the @ xmath1 method offers aas ways to understand the functions and their dependence in relation to the branch functions in the real n - fold , something that can not be easily done with the continued fraction more easily is to use the qnms . an exploration of the function @ xmath57 ( and @ xmath58 ) and the examples shown above shows that , for both the rwe and the tre , there is also a branch function with amplitude @ xmath59 and periods @ xmath60 which change with @ xmath41 in a nontrivial way ( fig . [ fig1 ] and fig . [ fig2 ] ) . for @ xmath61 , from the rwe and the tre one gets @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 and those periods are approximately constant with respect to @ xmath41 ( @ xmath61 ) . for @ xmath64 , the dependence of @ xmath59 and @ xmath60 on @ xmath41 becomes more obvious : the amplitude and the periods of the rwe change with @ xmath41 until they get @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 for @ xmath67 . for the tre, the amplitude and the frequency correspond to @ xmath68 , @ xmath69 . for @ xmath0 , the two # ##ities have an equal amplitude @ xmath70 . those results show that , although the so - called frequencies are consistent with at least 1 db with respect to @ xmath1 , there is also a local variation , the nature of which should be carefully considered . @ xmath71 { \ includegraphics [ height = 120px , width = 110px ] { fig1a . eps } } & \ end [ ] { \ includegraphics [ height = 120px , width = 110px ] { fig1b . eps } } \ \ \ end [ ] { \ includegraphics [ height = 120px , width = 110px ] { fig1c . eps } } & \ end [ ] { \ includegraphics [ height = 120px , width = 110px ] { fig1d . eps } } \ \ \ end { # } $ ] in this section , is presented the qnms for the schwarzschild coefficients obtained from the rwe and thetre , by solving the differential equations above in terms of the heun functions . the qnms from the tre for the mode @ xmath6 were calculated for the first time and were found to coincide with the well - known qnms from the rwe with significance of 6 digits . we demonstrated a new method for measuring the stability of the qnm calculations . the results show nontrivial dependence on small changes in the phase space ( the @ xmath1 mode ) which requires additional calculations . for the first time , the mode @ xmath0 was calculated directly from the boundary conditions of the exact analytical methods of rwe and tre and was found to have a nonzero real part , which proves that this mode is not the only rotating mode . the mode in question is stable with 6 digits of significance with respect to that in @ xmath1 , which proves that the real part is also not zero . those results given above show the strength of using confluent heun functions to find qnms of nonrotating modes and are useful in continuing this work in finding qnms of rotating modes . this article was published by the journal ` ` theoretical and computational physics and ` '' , and the bulgarian national scientific fund under contracts do - 1 - 872 , do - 1 - 895 , do - 02 - 136 , and the national scientific fund , contract 185 / 01 . 04 . 2010 . d . s . started the construction of the qnms of non - compact spheres as a part of the two - dimensional mller algorithm , called the epsilon method , is a continuation of the original work and has continued the construction . d . s . is responsible for the construction of qnms , based on the properties of the heun functions and for the exploration and construction of the @ xmath1 - space in the center of the real r - plane where qnms can be found . 00 , _ the quasi - periodic modes of the schwarzschild black hole _ , proc . math : * 344 * : 441 - 452 ( 1975 ) , _ black holes and gravitational waves . - - the quantum theory of black holes _ , apj : * 239 * , 292 - 295 , ( 1980 ) , _ the quantum theory of black holes _ , clarendon press / oxford university press ( oxford series of books on physics . volume 69 ) , ( 1983 ) , _ the##normal modes of black holes and black branes _ , ann . of grav . * , * 163001 ( 108pp ) ( 2009 ) , _ black hole quasinormal modes : foundations of quantum mechanics ?
