the first observational evidence that the universe has undergone a period of accelerated expansion was obtained when galaxies type ii ( snia ) were found to be fainter than stars @ xcite . this fact has been confirmed by many independent observations such as the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( microwave ) @ xcite , fluctuations in the matter field @ xcite , the alexander sachs wolfe ( isw ) effect @ xcite , baryon ##ic emission ( bao ) @ xcite , weak lensing ( wl ) @ xcite , and gamma - ray bursts @ xcite . within the theory of general relativity ( gr ) , the accelerated expansion is caused by a dark matter density component with negative pressure , called dark energy ( de ) . the discovery of this new matter field has given rise to a great scientific effort in order to understand its origin . the observational evidence is consistent with a density component @ xmath0 indicating the ultimate origin of the dark energy ( de ) at the initial epoch of the accelerated expansion of our universe and a dark matter ( dm ) component giving rise to galaxies and their large scale structures distributions @ xcite . the dm is predicted to have negligible pressure andtemperature and are termed and . thanks to the similarity with this the model is commonly known as @ xmath0cdm , to indicate the similarity of its main parameters . while accepted by the authors , the model is not stable from the theoretical point of view : the value of the coupling constant is several orders of magnitude smaller than what previously was estimated in particle physics @ xcite . it was suggested instead that it could be stable , evolving with time @ xcite . this new theoretical model also suffers from a theoretical fine - tune problem known as _ coincidence problem _ @ xcite that can be solved with the following simple question : if the time variation of d and de are very different why are their current values so different ? cosmological models where dm and de do not evolve separately but interact with each other were first proposed to justify the very small value of the cosmological constant @ xcite but they were found to be very useful to alleviate the coincidence problem . in this article we will summarize the theoretical developments of this field and the experimental evidence that supports the dm / de interaction and could , potentially , lead to its detection . the formation of small and large scale galaxies is driven by the effect of the density pertur##bations which themselves are related to the evolution of the universe @ xcite . an interaction between the components of the dark sector would affect the overall evolution of the universe and the expansion history , the expansion rate and the associated temperature , the rate of temperature changes of the cmb and the shape of the gravitational field at different stages would be different than in the concordance model . these observables are directly linked to the underlying physics of gravity @ xcite and , consequently , the model could be constrained with observations of the background radiation and the emergence of large scale structure . this review is organized as follows : in this introduction we describe the de interaction and we discuss some of the mechanisms that motivates the interaction within the dark sector . since the effects of de and dm are still unknown , in sec . [ sec : sec2 ] we consider two possible and appropriate ways to describe the de and the dm : fluids and scalar fields . based on the interpretation of the uncertainty principle , we understand why the interaction within the dark sector needs to be considered . in sec . [ sec : sec3 ] we review the effect of the interaction on the background evolution . we find that the d##m / n interactions could solve the coincidence problem and satisfy the second law of physics . in sec . [ sec : sec4 ] the behavior of matter under perturbations is described for the phenomenological fluid dynamics models . in sec . [ sec : sec5 ] we describe how the interaction causes the non - linear evolution and the spontaneous generation of gravitational waves . in sec . [ sec : sec6 ] we describe the physical observables that are used in sec . [ sec : sec7 ] to describe the interaction . finally , in sec . [ sec : sec8 ] we discuss the current and past experimental data and their ability to explain and constrain the interaction . in the [ category : articles ] we list the terms commonly used in this review . @ llll . & name & acronym & abbreviation + sachs - smith & alcock - packzynki & ksz & kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich + bao & baryon accoustic ##s & lbg & lyman & photon + cdm & = dark matter & photon & left hand side ( of an equation ) + cl & energy + & lisw & energy ##x sachs -wolfe + cmb & cosmic microwave background & lss & large scale universe + fr & dark energy & mcmc & monte carlo supply chain + detf & dark energy & force & rhs & right hand side ( of the equation ) + dm & dark energy & rsd & fr & fr + sl & equation of motion & sl & weak lensing + eisw & homogeneous universe sachs - wolfe & snia & supernova ##e ii + frw & friedman - robertson - walker & tsz & thermal sunyaev - zeldovich + isw & integrated sachs - wolfe & wl & weak lensing + the standard cosmological model is described by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) equation , defined for a homogeneous and homogeneous universe @ xcite @ xmath1 , \ end { x : frw - 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath2 is the scale factor at infinity @ xmath3 , the present universe is described by @ xmath4 and the scale factor is equal to @ xmath5 ; @ xmath6 is the gaussian curvature of the space - time . we have chosen the @ xmath7otherwise we will use the speed of light when needed . a commonly used reparametrization is the _ conformal time _ , denoted here as @ xmath8 . in terms of this notation , the line segment is @ xmath9 . \ { { { : frw - conformal } \ ] ] if we consider the energy content of the system as a perfect fluid with the energy density @ xmath10 and pressure @ xmath11 , friedmann the equations are @ xcite @ xmath12 where @ xmath13 is the density , and @ xmath14 is the energy density and pressure of the different fluid phases , separated by the equation of state ( os ) : @ xmath15 . in terms of the conformal time , the notation @ xmath16 is used . usually these are expressed in units of the energy density : @ xmath17 with @ xmath18 . the curvature tensor can be extended to the right hand side ( right ) by defining @ xmath19 . as a matter of fact , a h - notation ` ` ' ' ' denotes the expectation value of any given value . due to the historically uncertain nature of theinteraction constant , this value is usually expressed as @ xmath20kms @ xmath21mpc @ xmath21 so the parameter @ xmath22 encloses the real value in the form of the interaction constant . [ n = " ^ , ^ " , ] the phenomenological theory of the interaction of condensed matter was introduced in fig . [ sec : sec2 ] and the linear ##ization theory of the interaction was introduced in sec . [ sec : sec4 ] . for the sake of clarity in our current discussion , we will compare the models with the de - parameter @ xmath23 . the results for the de eos have been presented in @ xcite . we restrict our analysis to the models that satisfy the stability criterion ( sec . [ sec : sec4 . 3 ] ) . the interaction kernels are shown in table [ table : models ] . the results of the mcmc analysis using these data sets are shown in fig . [ figure2 _ sec8 ] . when the coupling is proportional to the energy density of the de , the analysis showed the value of the de parameter to be in the range @ xmath24 . when the coupling is proportional to the energy densityof the dm , the total energy density of the dark matter , the constraint is much tighter and the coupling are estimated at the 95 % confidence level ( cl ) . including these data tightens the constraint on the interaction when compared with the cmb data alone . results for different models can be found in @ xcite . the conclusion of these results shows that interacting de / de models are consistent with observations . in @ xcite it was found evidence of the existence of interaction parameters with very low probability . more recently the planck collaboration has found that interacting dm / de are in agreement with the @ xcite . in the next section we will further discuss the evidence in favor of strong interactions . as a function of the interaction parameters @ xmath25 for models iii and i , ii , iv . in the left panel we see the interaction parameters from table x , xi and xii of @ xcite . in the right panel , labeled boss , the cosmological parameters are those of the [ table : interaction _ table ] . the bottom line corresponds to the highest possible value @ xmath26 with the shaded lines being @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 respectively . ] compared with the data , low redshift .like luminosity measurements from snia have been used to study the dm / de interaction . at low resolutions the effects from @ xmath0cdm are not very strong and it is difficult to confirm the existence of a single de component or even an interacting one using high resolution observations . however , the analysis of the data provided evidence against the concordance hypothesis by measuring the bao in the microwave range @ xmath29 from the correlation function of the ly @ xmath30 signal from high energy quasars @ xcite . their results showed a @ xmath31 deviation ( from _ _ _ _ _ + wmap ) and @ xmath32 deviation ( from de / spt ) from @ xmath0cdm at @ xmath33 . while the statistical evidence is still very significant , if confirmed , this result can not be explained by the dynamical de component , and it suggests a more complex type of de . an interacting de serves as a simple and efficient solution to explain the boss result . if de and de interact and the former transfers energy to the latter , as if to alleviate the coincidence problem ( see : [ ref : sec2 . ]] ) and supported by the database @ xcite , it would explain the value of the interaction parameter , @ xmath34 , obtained by the boss collaboration , value that is smaller than the expectation from @ xmath0cdm @ xcite . it would explain the values of the mean and variance for different models . let us very briefly summarize which of the models presented in table [ table : models ] would be the boss experiment . let us imagine a universe filled only with e , de and j . we can take the interaction parameter obtained from the friedmann equation and compare it with the value obtained by the boss collaboration for both sets of adjusted cosmological models . we can also compare the values for @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 obtained by the boss collaboration with constraints from cmb adjusted data , @ xmath0cdm and the interaction parameter . to carry out this analysis we need to determine exactly the relationship with redshift of the energy levels of each particle , namely de and e since due to the symmetry they are not independently conserved . for the models i and j , they appear as @ xcite @ xmath37 \ n _ .^ 0 } { \ xi _ c + \ xi _ d } + \ omega _ 1 ^ 0 \ right \ } . \ begin { int _ 1 } \ end { end } \ ] ] the baryonic density is given by the following formula @ xmath38 . for the type of , the evolution of @ xmath39 from these data , it is easy to see that when the energy is transferred from the de to the de , the energy density of the dm is much smaller than what it would have been in the original @ xmath0cdm model . since @ xmath40 is the mass number of the @ xmath41 and it is smaller than in the experimental data , then it would be the dominant constant , as indicated by the experimental data . # ##n & bestfit & @ xmath42 + @ xmath22 & @ xmath43 & @ xmath44 + @ xmath45 & @ xmath46 & @ xmath47 + @ xmath48 & @ xmath49 & @ xmath50 + @ xmath51 & @ xmath52 & @ xmath53 +[ table : all _ parameters ] to make the last statement more precise we have two sets of values for the measured parameters @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 : ( 1 ) the values derived by the group , mainly from the boss collaboration , of the @ xmath0cdm model and listed in table [ table : all _ parameters ] , and ( 2 ) the values derived by @ xcite by applying de / de - particle models to the _ planck _ , bao , snia and @ xmath55 data above . in both data sets , the measured parameter of @ xmath33 has been computed using fig . ( [ int _ dm ] , [ int _ da ] ) for the various parameters listed in table [ table : parameters ] . the results are shown in fig . ( [ table : all _ parameters ] ) . the right panel corresponds to the cosmological models of the boss collaboration and the left panel to those of @ xcite . the figure shows the measured value @ xmath35 and the @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 parameters . in both cases , the @ xmath0cdm parameter that corresponds to the case ofno interaction is always in the @ xmath27cl . while still not significant , it does show that the data represent a dm / de fluid model with no interactions . further analysis of the data could help to prove the existence of an interaction . is the average energy density today . the attractor solutions of @ xmath56 does not depend on the initial conditions at the early time of the experiment . the horizontal lines represent the time evolution of the model with the initial conditions . solid circles represent the energy density @ xmath56 today . values vary with the initial conditions . they are constant in two attractor solutions @ xmath57 in @ xmath58 plane . , width = 480 , height = 432 ] the motivation to study the dm / de fluids is to alleviate the coincidence problem . only at the present time the dm / de ratio of the @ xmath59 model is of about 1 , with a fine - tuning on the initial conditions at the planck scale of several orders of magnitude ( see sec . [ sec : sec1 . 0 ] ) . let us examine if once interacting fluid models are confronted with it , the problem can be satisfied . we will focus on the problem of the phenomenological fluid3 . the results shown in fig . [ figure2 _ sec8 ] suggest that the coupling equations are compatible with the data and the experimental results in the direction of solving the cosmological coincidence problem @ xcite and similar conclusions have also been reached for the field theory of the ratio @ xcite . let us repeat our results for fluid models , and in particular for phase iv . in sec . [ sec : sec2 . 3 ] we have shown how this ratio solves the coincidence problem . as illustrated in fig . [ fig : 1 ] ( a ) the ratio has two possible solutions @ xmath60 ; the past solution and future ratios are shown in eq . ( [ 1 + - ] ) . when the ratio is @ xmath61 , the solutions behave exactly as @ xmath62 i . e . , the behavior of the attractor solutions of the ratio @ xmath56 ##1 depends on the coupling constant @ xmath63 and does not depend on the boundary conditions at the atomic scale . this solution of the coincidence problem is shown in fig . [ figure5 _ sec7 ] . purple spectral lines represent the distribution of the energy density in terms of the electron number density ., @ xmath64 , with different initial conditions . the phase of @ xmath56 at present is different for different initial conditions but all the solutions are given by the two equations , @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 . in this particular case we fixed @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 . during the mean time expansion of the universe , the dm to # ##g takes values in the range @ xmath69 ; it is much less than that in the @ xmath59 model , thus the cosmological stability problem is much reduced . the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating has led to large research programs being carried out to determine its origin . new facilities are being designed and built aiming to study the expansion process and the growth of matter in the universe with increasing speed according to the redshifts . since the interaction between the dark matter affects the physical history of the universe and the evolution of matter and energy by perturbations , peculiar velocities and magnetic fields , these new observations will not only support the current theory of accelerated expansion but also explain the effects of the interaction between dark matter . therefore , current and future observations could and should be used toset up experiments on interactions in dark matter and clarify the nature of de / de interactions . observations of type ii supernova , galactic spontaneous emission ( bao ) , gravitational lensing , redshift - space interactions and the emission of cosmic rays probe the structure of the universe at @ xmath70 . in parallel , the nature of de / de interactions at de can be probed by the observed light power , as the isw effect and lensing pattern of the cmb light are sensitive to the growth of de at high energies . the research task force ( detf ) was established to advise the different u . s . government agencies on future de research . their report categorized different research approaches by introducing a single ` ` figure of merit ' ' that was sensitive to the nature of de , particularly its interaction with time @ xcite . using this figure of merit , they evaluated ongoing and proposed de research based on observations of baryon acoustic oscillations , galaxy clusters , supernova and weak lensing . the detf categorized the different experiments by their relative stages of development . stage i referred to the design phase , stage ii to the on - going experiments at that time when the report was elaborated (circa 2006 ) , stage iii was defined as the first generation that are currently in full operation . they have looked forward to a stage iv survey of more advanced instruments . examples of stage iv surveys include the canada - france - japan telescope ( cfht ) legacy survey , with observations of snia @ xcite and weak lensing @ xcite and that started in 2009 , the essence @ xcite and sdss - essence @ xcite legacy surveys and bao measurements from the sdss @ xcite . while these projects continue to be expanded and improved with more recent observations , the chft lensing survey is the largest weak lensing survey to date . in this section we will briefly review those that are currently operating or under construction ( stage iii and iv ) . all of these facilities share the same goal of surveying wide areas to obtain detailed images of galaxies , clusters , and / or supernovae and they will also clarify the nature of the interaction with dark sectors . more details will be discussed in @ xcite . the current and planned ground based survey will collect data on snia , galaxy clusters and gravitational lensing . wide -

resolution constraints on the hubble spectrum and angular diameter limits on the bao [ @ xmath80 $ ] , using a combination of bao and power - measurement information . it can be achieved by surveying 1 . 8 million @ xmath81 emitting galaxies in a field of view of 420deg @ xmat##h72 @ xcite . the javalambre physics of the accelerating universe astronomical survey ( j -

[ see : sec7 . evidence ] to disproof the standard model .the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) is a wide - field , ground - based telescope , designed to measure @ xmath108 deg @ xmath72 in many different wavelengths from 320 nm to 1050 nm . the telescope will be located at cerro pachn ( chile ) and it will operate for a decade allowing to observe galaxies to redshifts well above unity . its main goals are to measure weak and strong gravitational lensing , bao , snia and the current composition , distribution , and masses of galaxy clusters as a function of time . its first launch is expected on 2019 . the square kilometre array ( ska ) is a micro - telescope which is scheduled to begin construction in 2018 . the hi - hi survey can provide astronomers with accurate redshifts ( using the 10 cm telescope ) of hundreds of galaxies over a wide range of redshifts , making it an ideal field survey for cosmological studies @ xcite . although technically challenging , the ska could measure the expansion rate of the universe in real time by measuring the neutral state ( hi ) signal of galaxies at two different distances @ xcite . wide - field multi - object spectroscopy ( wfmos ) isa camera specially devoted to bao exists . it will be mounted atop the 8 . 2 m subaru telescope on mauna ##ʻi ( hawaii ) . one of the main goals of the wfmos camera is high resolution imaging of bao . the wfmos de ##g comprises two projects : a 10 , 000 deg @ xmath72 survey of two million galaxies at redshifts @ xmath109 and a high redshift survey of about half a million lyman alpha galaxies ( lbgs ) at galaxies @ xmath110 that would probe distances and the hubble galaxy beyond @ xmath111 ( see @ xcite for more information ) . bingo is a radio telescope designed to detect bao at radio frequencies by measuring the distribution of neutral hydrogen at great distances using a technique called radio mapping . the telescope will be installed in a large , open cast , gold mine in northern uruguay . it will operate in the range [ 0 . 96 , 1 . 3 ] ghz to observe the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen cloud . bingo will consist of a two - mirror - mirror design with a 1 m diameter , and it will have no moving parts to provide both excellent polarization performance and very low side - lobe levelsand for intensity measurements . currently , the focus on space temperature measurements is centered on polarization . for a cosmic variance scale , space temperature has stronger constraints on cosmological parameters than cmb temperature @ xcite . experiments like sptpol @ xcite and quixote @ xcite are also taken data aiming to measure the polarization of the cmb and of the lunar and planetary sources . cmb experiments devoted to measuring temperature from the ground are also being proposed ; the theoretical feasibility of a cmb temperature experiment like cmb - s4 have been considered that in combination with low redshift measurements would be able to measure , among other parameters , the de ##duction of state and condensed matter annihilation @ xcite . satellite surveys usually require a larger facility and , therefore , are less expensive than those carried out from the ground . their main advantage is that , by operating outside the atmosphere , the data obtained contains a lower level of systematic errors . the wilkinson microwave explorer probe ( wmap ) was a space experiment devoted to measuring microwave temperature measurements at frequencies ranging between 23 and 94ghz . launched on june 1 , 2001 and operated for five years up to the end of december 2010 . the mainresults and data products of the first years of operation are described in @ xcite . the original 9yr data set was soon replaced by those of the planck collaboration . the planck collaboration observed the microwave and sub - microwave sky from august 1 , 2009 to oct 30 , 2013 at nine frequencies between 30 and 857 ghz , with angular resolution between 1 and 5 . the goal was to measure cmb maps both in temperature and polarization . the planck collaboration has published data on the thermal anisotropies , and sunyaev - zledovich ( tsz ) clusters . the measured temperature and frequency , a catalog of sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) clusters and the codes to assess the models against the available data @ xcite and its data products can be downloaded from the planck data archive @ xcite . the temperature - e , temperature - e mode and the temperature - e - power spectra were added up to @ xmath112 @ xcite , allowing the measured lensing potential @ xcite and the data on the models of the @ xmath0cdm and @ xcite . erosita will be a x - ray telescope that will be launched in 2016 . it will be the firstimaging all - sky objects in the range 0 . 5 - 10 kev @ xcite . the goal of erosita is the discovery of @ xmath113 galaxy clusters up to 10 @ xmath114 , in order to study the large scale structure in the universe and develop and characterize new types of galaxies . in the soft x - ray band ( 0 . 5 - 2 kev ) , it will be about 10 times more sensitive than the rosat all sky survey , and in the hard band ( 2 - 10 kev ) it will be the first truly deep sky survey of the universe at those wavelengths . it is a european space agency de satellite , scheduled for launch in 2020 . this mission is expected to perform two missions : a near 15 , 000 deg @ xmath72 survey in the optical and near - infrared and a deep survey of the deg @ xmath72 10 magnitudes deeper . these facilities are not connected to each other . euclid will map the extra - galactic sky with the resolution of the infrared space telescope , with optical and near - infrared ( nir ) imaging and nir spectroscopy . photometric redshifts for the galaxies in thewide survey will be provided from the photometry and from the nir instrument . in addition , 50 % spectroscopic resolution will be measured . the data will allow to measure the expansion history and the growth of structure with great precision . a detailed quantitative analysis of euclid performance has been discussed in @ xcite . the data will allow to test many different mathematical models ; when the growth factor is parametrized in @ xmath115 the value @ xmath116 corresponds to the @ xmath0cdm , and euclid will measure this value with a value of @ xmath117 @ xcite . forecasts for other parametrizations of the growth factor and for other parameters such as the temperature , density , speed , and space distortions are provided in @ xcite . the wide field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) is an upcoming scientific mission that is currently being reviewed and expected to be launched in 2023 . this mission replaces and extends existing scientific missions like the terra nova ##e mission ( sol ) and the galaxy de mission ( jdem ) . like sol , one of its main scientific goals is to determine the properties of galaxies and comany respects complements euclid . wfirst goal is to conduct a narrow and deep galaxy distance survey of 2000 deg @ xmath72 . both surveys will measure the distances for a similar number of galaxies and will provide a comparable precision for the baryon acoustic ##s derived for diameter distances and hubble constant redshift distances @ xcite . nevertheless , due to their different observing times they allow cross - checks that will help to identify and correct errors . the combination of both data sets will significantly reduce the impact on the matter energy parameters . other improvements will come from cross - correlating data from different sources for example , atlas , wfirst and ska have similar scientific goals and will allow observations at different wavelengths . euclid and wfirst probe the low mass universe , using weak lensing and galaxy clustering techniques . the ska has the ability to measure a different energy spectrum and a wider range in scales of the matter power spectrum , which are linear scales rather than the quasi - non - linear scales to which ska and wfirst would be limited . the correlation of different data is particularly sensitive to effects of modified gravity . cross - correlation of different datasets will serve to control demand for the primary instruments . the ska , wfirst and gem will be launched on similar timescales offering an additional opportunity to increase collaboration between these facilities . @ xcite the cosmic origins mission ( core ) is a stage iv deep - sky , microwave - band mission proposed to esa within cosmic vision 2015 - 2025 . core will provide measurements of the microwave sky both intensity and temperature in 15 frequency bands , ranging from 45 ghz to 795 ghz , with a resolution from @ xmath118 at 45 ghz and @ xmath119 at 795 ghz , with sensitivities roughly 10 to 30 times higher than planck @ xcite . the cosmic infrared imaging and spectroscopy mission ( star ) is a large - scale mission proposed to esa in march 2013 within the framework of the esa cosmic vision programme . its primary objective is to survey the microwave sky both intensity and temperature in order to accurately measure the absolute background intensity and temperature . the mission will detect planck @ xmath120 sources using the thermal sz effect and a peculiar source survey using the kinetic sz effect that comprises our cosmic hubble volume @ xcite . it is carrying several objectives through the missionpolarization program and tests ( pppdt ) that lead towards a new approach to the study of stellar evolution ( cmbpol ) @ xcite . combing these complementary ground based and space based approaches , we would also gain a better understanding of the nature of dm , stars and the universe within the dark sectors . we thank s . tsujikawa for comments and suggestions . b . w . wishes to thank fapesp and cnpq ( brazil ) for support and dr . a . costa , e . ferreira and m . landim for comments and suggestions . f . w . w . receives financial support from the ministerio de ciencia ##s innovacin , the fis2012 - 30926 and the ` ` programa de profesores visitantes severo ' ' ' of the instituto de astrofsica ##s canarias . b . w . would like to have the support by the space research institute of japan ( 973 / 2013cb834900 ) and the natural science foundation of china and he wishes to thank y . h . he and x . h . xu for their discussions .
