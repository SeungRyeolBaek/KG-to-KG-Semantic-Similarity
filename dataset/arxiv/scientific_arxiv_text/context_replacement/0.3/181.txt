water vapor is an important molecule for the formation of interstellar and circumstellar clouds . the 4 @ xmath8 - 5 @ xmath9 masing line of h @ xmath3o at 180 ghz , which originates from levels around 700k , has been used since its discovery by cheung et al . ( 1969 ) to detect the molecular gas around star forming stars and evolved stars . the duration of the emitting jet at that frequency is typically of the order of a few milliarcseconds ( a ~ 10 @ xmath10 transition ) . however , no data has been obtained from this line on the spectrum of h @ xmath3o at large time scales . other h @ xmath3o transitions have been observed from infrared or by radio observations : the 4 @ xmath11 - 5 @ xmath12 transition at 183 ghz ( waters et al . , 1980 ; cernicharo et al . 1990 , 1994 , 1996 ; gonzlez - alfonso et al . 1994 , 1998 ) , the 4 @ xmath13 - 5 @ xmath14 transition at 380 ghz ( phillips , kwan and huggins 1980 ) , the 4 @ xmath15 - 5@ xmath16 transition at 321 ghz ( menten , melnick and phillips 1990a ) and the 2 @ xmath17 - 2 @ xmath18 transition at 325 ghz ( menten et al . ) , the 1 @ xmath19 - 1 @ xmath20 transition of h @ xmath21o at 547 ghz has been measured by zmuidzinas et al . ( 1994 ) . among these transitions , the 3 @ xmath11 - 2 @ xmath12 transition at 183 ghz has been used to estimate the abundance of h @ xmath3o at very large - scale ( cernicharo et al . 1994 , hereafter referred to as cer94 ) . the size of the orion molecular cloud observed in cer94 was 6 orders of magnitude larger than the size of the cloud detected at 22 ghz and for the first time an h @ xmath3o abundance estimate was made for the different large scale components of the orion molecular cloud . the iso ##lab also had the opportunity to measure the lines of absorption in the visible and near - infrared ( see the table in : dishoeck 1997 ; cernicharo 1997 ; and cernicharo et al1997a , 1998 ) . mapping of the sgrb2 molecular cloud by cernicharo et al . ( 1997b ) has also shown that water vapor is an important element in molecular clouds with an abundance of h @ xmath7 . observations of the emission of several h @ xmath3o lines from the irc2 have been obtained by cernicharo et al . ( 1997a , 1998 , 1999 ) . measurements of the atomic position have been also obtained by van dishoeck et al . ( 1998 ) , gonzlez - alfonso et al . ( 1998 ) and harwit et al . however , the iso observations of h @ xmath3o have limitations . in addition to the limited spatial resolution and the high resolution of the emission spectrum of h @ xmath3o , the limited angular resolution obtained by iso in the near - infrared prevents any detailed study of the molecular structure and physical conditions of the h @ xmath3o spectral regions . an important aid in determining h @ xmath3o abundances could come from the observation of another masing region of h @ xmath3o with similar properties to those of the 183 ghz line . the 325 ghz lineof h @ xmath3o was observed by menten et al ( 1990b ) in the vicinity of the irc2 and the molecular clouds . however , no results were obtained . instead we report the detection of extended water emission at 325 ghz and show that the h @ xmath3o abundance is @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 above the * plateau * . the above results show the importance of ground - based observations of h @ xmath3o in determining the abundance of h @ xmath3o in molecular clouds and in providing accurate contraints on the physical conditions of the emitting clouds . our ground - based observations provide much greater spatial resolution than iso - swas , and the abundance of x ( h @ xmath3o ) as well as that obtained from the very optically thick h @ xmath3o was observed in the submillimeter and near infrared domains . the observations were made with the 10 . 5 m telescope of the caltech submillimeter station at the summit of mauna grande ( hawaii ) on january 1 @ xmath22 1998 . the telescope , a helium - neon microwave mixer operating in single - sideband mode ( dsb ) , was tunedand the detection of the 5 @ xmath04 @ xmath1 line of h @ xmath23o ( 325 . 152919 ghz ) . the 5 @ xmath3o line was placed in the upper sideband ( usb ) to minimize atmospheric interference from the image sideband ( which was at 322 . 35 ghz ) . lines in the signal sideband are very narrow compared to those in the image sideband , due to the adjacent h @ xmath24 line . therefore it is necessary to check the sideband origin of a given line . the signal frequency was increased by 100 mhz to confirm that the central point of the eye of x - irc2 is the polar ice line . the backend consisted of a 1024 mhz acousto - optical spectrometer with a bandwidth of 100 mhz ( @ xmath25v = 100 . 5 mhz @ xmath26 ) . figure 1 shows the signal spectrum which matches very well the previous observation by menten et al . ( 1990b ) , for the higher frequency ( see below ) . the frequency was increased by observing the spectral line towards the o - rich variable , vy cma and was found to be close to zero . the signalconditions were very good during the night with the atmospheric pressure and temperature of 620 °c and - 1 . 0 @ xmath27c ##−1 . the relative humidity was estimated to be about - 10 % . the peak opacity from the instrument at 225 °c was @ xmath40 . 025 . during the same period we made broadband fourier transform spectroscopy ( rms ) measurements of the atmospheric absorption with the fts described in serabyn and weisstein ( 1995 ) . the measurements using the multi - component nonlinear radiative transfer model , ( cernicharo 1985 , 1988 ; pardo 1996 ) yielded an estimated precipitable water vapor column from the position of @ xmath28200 @ xmath29 m , which corresponds to the signal transmission at 325 . 0 ##° of @ xmath28 60 % ( the corresponding value for the image side bande was @ xmath28 40 % , and the corresponding values for the image sideband features were overstimated by the factor @ xmath28 ##0 ) . the heterodyne h @ xmath3o data was obtained using the instrument at ambient temperature . the corresponding system noise temperature , for the signal sideband , was @xmath42100 k . the emission profile shown in figure 1 shows that the lines from the image sideband are stronger than the 325 ghz h @ xmath3o line , i . e . , just the opposite of that observed in the spectrum of menten et al . ( 1990b ) . rather than a variation of the actual spectrum ( the h @ xmath3o line shown in figure 1 is similar to that observed in menten et al . 1990b ) we think that this variation is due to the stronger signal received during our observations . we conclude that our error rate is equivalent to about 20 - 30 % . the orion - irc2 map was carried out in position switching mode , using the on - the - fly procedure with the reference position 5 away from azimuth . the velocity distribution of the 325 ghz emission is shown in figure 2 along with that of ch @ xmath2oh ( from the image side band ) and the 183 ghz emission from cer94 . the intensity maps for selected velocity intervals are also shown in figure 2 . in order to compare the line profiles of the h @ xmath3o lines at 183 and 325 ghz we reobserved a few positions at 183 ghz with the30 - m iram telescope in january 1999 . the observing conditions were very excellent with a maximum brightness at this frequency of @ xmath4 1 . the results , compared with those observed in 1994 , are shown in figure 3 . the observed 5 @ xmath17 - 4 @ xmath18 line profile towards the center , is similar to that of the 5 @ xmath11 - 4 @ xmath12 line observed by cer94 ( see diagram in figure 3 ) . however , the antena temperature of the line is 20 % lower and the line profile , although in the same frequency range , is shifted towards the center . taking into account the different beam sizes of the iram - 30 m telescope at 183 ghz and the cso at 325 ghz , and the intensity of the emission in the latter frequency , we find that the main lobe brightness variation ratio , @ xmath30 = t @ xmath31 ( 183 ) / t @ xmath31 ( 325 ) is 10 - 20 if the emission were observed with a maximum of @ xmath32 beam size . on the other hand , t @ xmath31 ( 183 ) @ xmath33 k . both @ xmath30 andpositions @ xmath31 ( 183 ) are well known and can only be attributed to a calibration problem . the observing conditions were very good during our observations at these positions . similar values for * r * , i . e . , @ xmath341020 , are also known at other positions in the cloud ( see figure 2 ) and represent a significant difference in the brightness temperatures of the two sources . so at 2 @ xmath35 = - 12 , @ xmath36 = 48 the brightness temperature of the 5 @ xmath17 - 4 @ xmath18 transition approaches that of the 3 @ xmath11 - 4 @ xmath12 ( the 3 @ xmath17 - 4 @ xmath18 line is , however , narrower ) . the 325 ghz line at this position presents a local maximum clearly visible in the sky maps ( see figure 2 ) . unlike the 3 @ xmath11 - 4 @ xmath12 line , the 5 @ xmath17 - 4 @ xmath18 line is masing in phase . there are some narrow peaks at 325 ghz , with peaks of only a few percent , i . e . , much smaller than those seen at 183 .by cer94 . these lines correspond in shape with those observed at 183 ghz . however , @ xmath30 changes intensity from feature to feature , a fact that explains the variable nature of the emission . in the central region the lines are very narrow ( @ xmath373 - 2 kms @ xmath26 ) . some of the 2 @ xmath11 - 2 @ xmath12 narrow velocity components have reached temperatures below 2000 k and are only a few arcseconds in size ( cer94 , gonzlez - alfonso 1995 ) . the observations at this frequency recorded in june 1999 clearly showed a change in the intensity of some of these features with respect to those of cer94 . however , in regions where the line is dominated by the infrared emission ( @ xmath35 = 16 , @ xmath36 = - 16 and @ xmath35 = 48 , @ xmath36 = - 16 for example ; see figure 2 ) and in the peripheral region ( @ xmath35 = - 12 , @ xmath36 = 48 ; figure 3 ) the line shape and intensity do not show any significant changes at these frequencies . a possible explanation for the 183 ghz and325 ghz . being so extended could be that it arises from multiple masing point like sources strongly embedded in the beam . this is ruled out by the observation of cer94 where even the strong features at 183 ghz ( p @ xmath382000 - 4000 ##0 ) give lobes of some spatial extent ( see below ) . the energy needed to produce the apparent brightness ##es of the bright spots at 183 ghz would depend on either thermal or suprathermal 183 ghz emission . however , if the 183 ghz emission was arising from the same source than that of the 325 ghz , very high column energy would be needed to produce the observed 183 ghz and 325 ghz intensities . in addition , the thermal and extended emission detected at 183 ghz by cer94 clearly indicates the presence of water vapour associated with the molecular cloud of the orion molecular cloud . in order to understand the nature of the extended masing lines we have modeled the radiative transfer of the orbital period of p - p @ xmath3o for the observed conditions of the orion molecular cloud . the radiative transfer method is described in gonzlez - alfonso & cernicharo ( 1997 ) , and the model consists of amolecular cloud with diameter of @ xmath39 , ( mass of 15 @ xmath40 at 450 pc ) which expanded at a constant rate of 25 % h @ xmath26 . collisional rates between hydrogen molecules and stars were calculated from _ _ _ , maluendes & mclean ( 1993 ) . the initial temperature was assumed to be 0 . 5 , and the rates were adjusted to take into account the interaction between p @ xmath23o and h @ xmath23 . we calculated the statistical mass distribution of the first three rotational periods of p - h @ xmath3o for different frequencies ( t @ xmath41 = 100 , 150 , 200 and 300 ghz ) , mass populations of ( p - h @ xmath3o ) , and volume distributions ( n ( h @ xmath3 ) = @ xmath42 , @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 @ xmath45 ) . figure 4 shows the main sequence brightness distribution ( t @ xmath31 ) ( as observed for a star of 15 @ xmath40 beam energy ) for the 183 and 325 ghz atmosphere - ocean bands ( narrow and broad bands , respectively ) , along with @ xmat##h30 ( spectral lines ) . these lines @ xmath31 are computed from the line intensity , assuming that the spectral line is u - shaped . analysis of fig . 4 shows that the line intensity of @ xmath30 increases with n ( p - h @ xmath3o ) for higher frequency values ( which depend on t @ xmath41 and n ( h @ xmath3 ) ) . both lines are unsaturated in these conditions , but the higher opacity of the 183 ghz line makes this line more sensitive to values of n ( p - h @ xmath3o ) . for higher values of n ( p - h @ xmath3o ) , the 183 ghz line becomes saturated and the exponential amplification of the 325 ghz line yields a decrease of @ xmath30 . finally , when both the 183 and 325 ghz lines become saturated , @ xmath30 approaches a near constant value or it is below 1 for high n ( h @ xmath3 ) and low t @ xmath41 . the line at 183 ghz is saturated for these two conditions , although t @ xmath31 will still remain at n @ xmat##h41 due to the suprathermal excitation of the gas ( see cer94 ) . even for very low gas density ( n ( p - t @ xmath3o ) @ xmath46 @ xmath47 ) , low temperature ( 100 k ) and high density ( @ xmath42 @ xmath45 ) , the 183 ghz line has an intensity larger than 100 k ( see cer94 ) . however , the lack of appreciable amplification for the 5 @ xmath17 - 6 @ xmath18 line is much more likely than for the 183 ghz line , due to the low density of the gas trapped in the 325 ghz line ( @ xmath48 k ) , and to the high energy and extinction coefficient of this line . this also explains the difference in frequency distribution of the lines , so that the the 325 ghz line is spatially restricted to the ridge while the 183 ghz line is in addition detected on the ridge ( cer94 ) . the actual vapor column temperature that gives the observed n * t * @ xmath49 depends strongly on the assumed values of n ( p @ xmath3 ) and t @ xmath##41 . the higher n ( h @ xmath3 ) and t @ xmath41 , the lower n ( p - h @ xmath3o ) that is needed to obtain an accurate value of the 325 spectral lines . 4 . that * r * @ xmath50 is derived from several models for n ( p - h @ xmath3o ) : from @ xmath51 @ xmath47 ( n ( h @ xmath3 ) = @ xmath44 @ xmath45 , t @ xmath41 = 100 k ) to @ xmath52 @ xmath47 ( n ( h @ xmath3 ) = @ xmath42 @ xmath45 , t @ xmath41 = 100 k ) . however , some of these models are not consistent with the observed intensities . for n ( h @ xmath3 ) @ xmath53 @ xmath43 @ xmath45 and t @ xmath41 @ xmath54150 respectively , we find that * r * @ xmath55 = n @ xmath31 ( 325 ) in terms of @ xmath##56 ##5 and t @ xmath31 ( 183 ) @ xmath54 @ xmath57 * . both the observed intensities and * * * are only compatible with more moderate values of n ( h @ xmath3 ) and / or t @ xmath41 . the physical consequence is that , for moderate values of n ( h @ xmath3 ) and / or t @ xmath41 , the collisional pumping of the 183 ghz line is so strong that the emission from this region reaches high levels for the values that exceed t @ xmath31 ( 325 ) of 50100 k . of course , the line will include regions with very high densities and temperatures ( which will give rise , for example , to the line at 325 ghz and to the other extreme lines seen at 183 and 325 ghz ) , but these will be much smaller than the actual size of the cloud . the observed emission from the line we observe between 183 ghz and 325 ghz is only compatible with moderate values of n ( h @ xmath3 ) and t @ xmath41 . in our case , the 325 ghz line will have properties similar to those already observed in nature ( genzel et al , 1981) , for the bulk kinetic energy and mass shown in figure 1 . the bright features at 22 ghz could be compared with the narrow features at 183 ghz , and with the relatively dark features at 325 ghz . the value of t @ xmath58 k can be obtained for two molecular systems , t @ xmath59 @ xmath54150 k and n ( h @ xmath3 ) @ xmath5410 @ xmath58 @ xmath45 . lower limits for n ( h @ xmath3 ) and t @ xmath41 can be obtained from the observations of other molecular systems ( e . g . , wang et al . 1987 ) , so that we have n ( h @ xmath3 ) @ xmath53 @ xmath43 @ xmath45 and t @ xmath41 = 100150 k . for these , we obtain n ( h - t @ xmath3o ) in the range @ xmath60 @ xmath61 @ xmath47 , and also n ( h @ xmath3o ) in the range @ xmath62 @ xmath52 @ xmath47 . the temperaturevapor abundance can be estimated from the co measurements obtained with high spatial resolution ( see cer94 ) . for the intermediate solar plateau cer94 derived a minimum column density of h @ xmath63 @ xmath47 . therefore , the x ( h @ xmath3o ) / x ( co ) abundance ratio of the cloud is approximately 1 , i . e . , x ( h @ xmath3o ) @ xmath28 @ xmath64 . in the x - zone the 325 ghz is very low . our models and the 183 ghz data give an estimate for x ( h @ xmath3o ) of a few 10 @ xmath6 - 10 @ xmath7 ( see cer94 ) which is in good agreement with our iso ##metry ( see cernicharo et al . 1998 , 1999 ) . the comparison of the masing transitions arising in relatively low energy levels of h @ xmath3o allows us to compare the physical properties of the different emitting regions . so far , ground - based observations of these regions with amateur space telescopes are the only means to determine the spatial distribution of h @ xmath3o in molecular clouds . the. cernicharo and dr . gonzlez - alfonso are the dges for this project . # pb96 -
