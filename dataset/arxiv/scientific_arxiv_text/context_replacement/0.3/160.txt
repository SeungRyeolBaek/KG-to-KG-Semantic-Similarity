during recent years there has been increasing evidence for a connection between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and star formation in the vicinity of the central black hole . this link is the central topic of this article , and is discussed in sections [ sec : prop ] and [ sec : staragn ] . a large number of studies have addressed the issue of star formation in agn . those which have been closest to the nucleus , even at distances of a few hundred parsecs , have tended to focus on seyferts and seyfert2 , since these are the closest to @ xcite . the overall conclusion of these studies is that in 3050 % cases the agn is associated with small ( i . e . , less than a few 100myr ) star formation . while this certainly suggests a connection , it does not necessarily imply any _ causal _ relationship between the two phenomena . instead , it could more likely be a physical consequence of the fact that both agn and starburst require gas to form them . and that in some cases this gas has fallen towards the nucleus , possibly due to an instability or an evolution such as bar ##yon inflow . another factor which should be borne in mind when considering such cases , and which has been ruled outby @ xcite , note the difference in the scales involved . agn and starburst phemonena occur on different temporal and spatial scales ; and they are sensitive to scales that are different again . for example , star formation has typically been observed on scales of several kiloparsecs up to a few hundred meters . in contrast , accretion of gas onto the agn will occur on scales much less than 1pc . similarly , the shortest star formation timescales that most observations are sensitive to are of order 100myr to 1gyr . on the other hand , in this paper we note that the active phase of star formation close around a black hole is typically much shorter than 100myr . correspondingly , accretion timescales for black holes are reflected in the age of jets which , for a group of elliptical galaxies studied by @ xcite , span a range from a few to 100myr . for seyfert , the timescales are much shorter , as typified by ngc1068 for which @ xcite estimate the age of the jets to be only @ xmath4myr . that the putative causal link between agn and starbursts might occur .these small spatial scales and short timescales will help us to understand why no correlation has been found between agn and ( circum - ) nuclear starbursts in general . it is simply that the circumnuclear activity on scales greater than a few hundred parsecs is , in most cases , too distant from the agn to explain it , or be strongly influenced by it ( cf * ? ? ? in this article we redress this ) . while the optical spectroscopy used by many authors allows for the comparison of observations and models to the stellar data , we cannot make use of the star formation diagnostics and interpret them using starburst population density models . observing at near infrared wavelengths has produced two important advantages . the image depth is many times greater than at optical wavelengths , and so our telescopes are less sensitive to the effects of radiation which may be significant in agn . and we have used adaptive optics to achieve spatial resolution of ca . 10 . 2 , bringing us closer to the sun . using these techniques , we have also studied the dynamics of the nuclear star formation in a few objects @ xcite . here we bring those data together with the data from 5 additional stars . our sample enables us to study star formation inagn from scales of 1kpc up to greater than 10pc . our aim is to ascertain whether there is evidence for star formation at the highest scales we can find ; and if so , to constrain its star formation mechanisms . first , we look at whether there are indications that the nuclear starburst and agn are strongly influencing each other . in [ sec : prop ] we describe the sample selection , processing , noise reduction , psf analysis , and extraction of the emission and emission line spectra and data . in [ sec : diag ] we describe the observational diagnostics and analysis techniques . detailed descriptions of the various aspects of our collected data for the new objects are presented in appendix [ sec : obj ] , where we will present all of our previously published data , re - assessing them where necessary to ensure that the objects are observed in a timely manner . the main themes of our study are addressed in [ sec : prop ] and [ sec : staragn ] . in [ sec : prop ] we discuss global implications of the existence and recent observations of nuclear star formation for our new objects . in [ sec : staragn ] we discuss the nature of nuclear starburst##s on the starburst - agn connection . here , we present our conclusions . [ sec : conc ] . the agn described in this paper are a very diverse group . they include type 1 and type 2 seyferts , ulirgs , and even a qso , and do not form a single group . in order to maximise the size of the sample , we have combined data for which we have already published adaptive optics near infrared spectra with new observations of additional objects . this selection was driven largely by technical requirements for the adaptive optics ( ao ) system , namely , a nucleus bright and compact enough to allow a good ao image . this is quite a strength since it appears that 7 of the 9 agn are in fact broad line galaxies as indicated either by the new type ii classification or because there is a broad ( fwhm @ xmath5kms @ xmath6 ) br @ xmath7 component in our data . [ sec : bbrg ] shows broad line @ xmath7 and r - band spectra of 3 agn that are not usually classified as broad line galaxies . this is in contrast to most other types of agn for which star formation has been studied in detail , and whichany bias that might arise from selecting only type 2 syeferts . that there may be a bias arising from the experimental evidence that the obscuration in about half of type 2 agn occurs at kpc , rather than in the infrared , which can be explained by the extended star formation in the outer disk @ xcite . such agn do not fit well into the standard classification scheme ( and perhaps should not really be considered type 2 stars ) . because broad lines can be seen in the spectrum , we know that we are looking down to the nuclear region and that our results are not subject to any effects that this would otherwise cause . this is exactly the line agn for which little is known about the nuclear star formation , because the glare of the agn swamps the surrounding stellar light in the surrounding arcsec . as a result , most studies of star formation close to agn have focussed on type 2 seyferts . adaptive optics makes it possible to confine most of the agn s light into a very small region , and to resolve the stellar halo around it . the use of adaptive optics does give rise to one problem when attempting to interpret the results in a uniform way , due to the different resolutions achieved which is a combination of : the differentto each other ( i . e . target objects ) and the ao itself . as a result , the average error around the logarithmic angular resolution of our observations ( excluding ngc2992 , see table [ tab : obj ] ) of 22pc is a factor of 3 . therefore , this has allowed us to measure the range of agn to nearly 3 orders of magnitude on spatial scale , from 1kpc in the more distant objects to only a few cm in the nearest objects with the best ao performance . a summary of our results is given in table [ tab : obs ] . a description of observations and processing of the resulting data is given below . images for iras05189 - 2524 and ngc1068 were taken in december 2002 at the vlt with naco , an adaptive optics near infrared camera and long slit camera @ xcite . since iras05189 - 2524 was viewed face on , there is a slightly curved axis and the slit was aligned north - south ; for ngc1068 two orientations were used , north - south and east - west . in both cases the slit angle was 0 . 086 , yielding a angular resolution of @ xmath8 with thewide - field images ( pixel scale 0 . 054 ) and high resolution grism . the camera was nodded back and forth in the slit of vision to allow for subtraction . for iras05189 - 2524 , 12 integrations of 300sec were made ; for ngc1068 12 integration of 300sec were made at one viewing angle , and 12 integration of 200sec at the other . all data were reduced and combined , using the longslit techniques of iraf , to produce the full h - band spectrum . images for ngc7469 , ngc2992 , ngc1097 , ngc1068 , and ngc3783 were taken during 20042005 on the vlt with sinfoni , an adaptive optical and infrared wide field camera @ xcite . images were taken with the cameras in the j and h bands either separately ( @ xmath9 ) or together ( @ xmath8 ) . the pixel scales were 0 . 125 @ xmath100 . 25 or 0 . 05 @ xmath100 . 25 , depending on the trade - off of field of view , spatial resolution , and signal - to - noise ratio . individual exposure times were inthe hd 50300sec depends on the object brightness . object frames were interspersed with sky frames , and using the algorithm o - s - o - o - s - o , to perform the subtraction . the frames were processed using the dedicated _ spred _ data engine @ xcite , which performs similar processing to that for longslit data but with the additional ability to reconstruct the datacube . the data processing steps are as follows . the object frames are pre - processed by subtracting sky frames , flatfielding , and averaging the pixels ( which are drawn from dark nucleus and the flatfield ) . the wavemap is compressed , and edges and vertices of the slitlets are traced , starting from the arclamp frame . the arclamp frame is then split into a cube , which is adjusted to ensure that the resolution is good . the pre - processed object frames are then also split into squares , and shifted to align them using the dark nucleus as a basis , and smoothed . in some cases the resulting image is also smoothed using a @ xmath11 median filter . analysis of the image resolution ( see below ) is always performed after this stage . in some cases , the strong near - infraredoh lines did not subtract significantly . with long aperture ##s this is to be expected since the timescale for variation of the image is about 12mins . if visual analysis of the reconstructed images showed evidence of over - or under - resolution of the oh lines , these cubes were reprocessed using the method described in @ xcite . standard reference frames were similarly reconstructed into cubes . error correction and flux measurements were performed using b stars ( k - band ) or g2v stars ( l - band ) . in addition , the calibration was cross - checked in 3 apertures using 2mass data , and in smaller 3 aperture ##s s - band data from naco and hst nicmos . contrast between cubes with different image sizes , and also with the external data , was consistent to typically 20 % . there are a number of methods to derive the point spread function ( psf ) from the optics data , five of which are described in @ xcite . with agn , it is also possible to derive the psf from the optical data itself , eliminating any uncertainty about spatial and temporal variations of the psf due to interference effects . typically one or more of the following methods are based onthe best data is here . if a single spectral line is detected , this will always yield a measure of the psf since the blr of seyfert also has a spectrum that can be measured in 100 days . alternatively , the non - stellar continuum will provide a sufficiently good approximation for all but the nearest agn since at near infrared wavelengths it is likely to originate from a region no more than 12pc across . in this paper we have applied an analytical fit to the spectrum . since the strehl ratio achieved is relatively small , using a gaussian is a poor fit . we have used a moffat function , which is a better fit because it also avoids the very broad lines that are so critical of electro - optics correction . the spectrum model for ngc3227 , which is shown in fig . 1 of @ xcite , can be considered ideal . if one applied the concept of ` core plus halo ' to this model , then the analytical fit would fit only the core while the moffat fit the entire ` core plus halo ' . integrating both of these factors indicates that about 75 % of the spectrum is in the ` core ' , and it is only this part which dominates the psf . in this paper , a more accurate representationof the above is not needed since we have not performed a detailed kinematic analysis , and we have not used the moffat to derive the fwhm for the spatial resolution . the resolutions achieved are listed in table [ tab : 1 ] . the spatial distribution of emission and absorption features has been determined by fitting a function to the continuum - scale spectral segment at each spatial position in the datacube . the function is a convolution of a gaussian with a spectrally unresolved intrinsic profile in the case of emission lines which form the oh ##m - line , and for the absorption features we make use of template ##s observed in the same configuration ( pixel density and grism ) . a minimisation was performed in which the parameters of the data were adjusted until the convolved parameters best fit the data . during the analysis , pixels in the data that consistently differed significantly from the data were rejected . the uncertainties were un - strapped using monte carlo methods , so that the data is uncorrelated and the intrinsic profile is well represented by a matrix . the method involves adding a gaussian with the same properties to a spectral segment that exhibits the same intrinsic profile as the data , and refittingthe latter to provide a complete set of experimental parameters . after doing this several times , the standard deviation of the center and radius were used as the uncertainites for the shape and beam width . the kinematics were further processed using kinemetry @ xcite . this is a parameterisation ( i . e . a mathematical rather than a physical model ) of the electron beam . as such , beam geometry is not a relevant issue to kinemetry , which provides an analytical basis for the observed data . of course , when the coefficients of this expression are interpreted and used to constrain a physical model , the beam geometry should be considered . thus , the kinemetry algorithm fits the data with a linear sum of squares and cosines with the angular values around ellipses at the radius . we have used this for three purposes : to determine the proper phase angle and axis angle for the velocity field , to remove first order errors from the initial kinematic data , and to recover the velocity and the phase ratio . in all of the cases described here , the kinematic centre of the velocity field was found to be coincident with the peak of the non - stellar object . in particular , the zof the magnetic field allows us to make the simplifying assumption of a single position angle and axis ratio i . e . there is no need for warps or different velocity contours . we have derived the position angle and inclination of the disk curve using the _ a1 _ and _ b3 _ parameters . ( see @ xcite for a comparison of these ) . the velocity curves were recovered by adjusting the measured velocity curves for inclination . we have assumed throughout the analysis that the disk is isotropic , and therefore no such correction was applied to the data that was measured . the other parts of the data derived as well are of course still affected by beam smearing . in particular , the radial velocity can not always be taken at face value since it can not be artificially altered by any change of rotation speed in the beam size , or decreased if other regions within the disk have a lower value . for the galaxies we have studied , there are two factors which mitigate this effect : the rotation speed in the central region is much less than the dispersion and so will not significantly change it ; and when considering the central region we consider the effect of the dispersion from large radi##i , where the diameter of the beam is small , to the center . for the basic analyses performed here , we have therefore adopted the standard model at face value . more detailed theoretical models for the nuclear reaction , which also account for the effects of beam angle , will be presented in future sections . however , we emphasize that the effect of the finite beam angle on the stellar rotation curve does not affect our estimates of the dynamical parameters . the result is that , for all the possible mass estimates we make , the mass is estimated at a radius much smaller than the fwhm of the psf as can be seen from the relevant figure . in this section we describe the terms of the methods used to analyse the data , and which lead us to the detailed data presented in section [ sec : ob ] . more details and tools for individual objects will be found in section [ sec : obj ] . we use the same methods and tools for all the objects to ensure that all the objects are analysed in a consistent manner . perhaps the most important problem is how to measure the stellar continuum , which is itself a good diagnostic . in addition , we use the same and simple methods to quantify the star formation history and composition of the nuclei of theseagn . these are the parameters @ xmath7 equivalent width , effective size , and dark - to - light ratio . much of the discussion concerns how we take into account the accuracy of the agn when calculating these parameters . we also consider what impact an incorrect compensation could have on interpretation of the data . we perform these new diagnostics of the stellar population and the corresponding code ##words ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this model calculates the number of stars in the hertzsprung - russell diagram as a function of and for the assumed star formation rate . we usually use an expected decaying star formation rate , which has an associated timescale @ xmath12 . general properties of the stars are then calculated from the stellar population present at any time . we note that the model output of stars is quantitatively similar to that from version 1 . 0 of starburst99 , which unlike previous versions does not agb tracks @ xcite . as described in table below , general properties of stars are , for distances greater than 10myr : equivalent width of @ xmath13and @ xmath14 , and h - k color of 0 . 15mag . the corresponding quantities measured by starburst99 v5 . 0 were @ xmath15 and @ xmath16 , and h - k color of 0 . 2mag . for large optical apertures a significant fraction of the k - band ( and even h - band ) contributions can be associated with non - linear agn contributions . the agn contribution can be estimated from a simple measurement of the equivalent width of a stellar absorption feature . we have co - 2 2 . 29 in the k - band and co6 - 3 1 . 62 in the h - band . although the equivalent widths @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 vary greatly for individual stars , the equivalent values for star clusters span only a rather limited range . this was demonstrated by @ xcite who measured these values for giant , dwarf , and star - forming ( hii ) stars . we then show their measurements of these stellar absorption features on the right - hand panel of images . [ source : equiv ] , along with the equivalent widths of giant and dwarf stars from @ xcite . in stars we use our own equivalent widthsfrom the spectra @ xcite to calculate the time - series equivalent ##s for an entire population of stars . values for the star formation histories are given in the centre and right panels of fig . [ 2 : equiv ] , for @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 respectively . the values are @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 . the dashed box in the right panel shows that the observation of 20 % deviation from each of these computed values is consistent with confidence . that the hii populations have no more @ xmath17 cannot be understood because these are selected to have strong emission lines and they are strongly biased towards young stellar populations often corresponding to the maximum age of the stellar population that is at 10myr relative to the late - type supergiant population . it may be this similarity for galaxies classified as ` starbursts ' , and the similarity of the equivalent ##spar for starbursts of all possible ages , that led @ xcite to conclude that there is no evidence for strong starbursts in seyfert2 galaxies . similarly , an estimate of the age can be found from the nai2 . 206 line . fig . 2 of @ xcite shows that for nearly all star ##buhistories the value @ xmath21 remains in the range 23 . our conclusion here is that within a reasonable uncertainty of @ xmath2220 % ( see fig . [ fig : equiv ] ) , we can conclude that the intrinsic equivalent width of the two most notably # ##s of a stellar population that contains g - type stars is independent of the star formation history and ages . for a stellar population diluted by the non - stellar emission , the width of stellar light is @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 are the intrinsic and intrinsic equivalent ##s of the two features shown above . thus , we are able to calculate the time continuum values for the contribution associated with the agn . our data includes both the h and k - bands hence the need for using values @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 . in order to homogenize the dataset , we need to convert h - band stellar emission to k - band . the stars shown in fig . [ fig : h _ lum ] show that this value is also independent of the star formation history , and equivalent to @ xmath26mag ( no extinction ) for all timescales and ages . this conclusion is supportedfollowed by models of elliptical and spiral galaxies , by @ xcite . for ellipticals @ xmath270 . 2 , and for galaxies @ xmath270 . 3 . some of the differences between the data and models could be due to variations since @ xmath28 ; and for @ xmath29 , @ xmath30 . however , at the level of accuracy shown above , the 510 % difference between models and data can be considered negligible . to convert from absolute magnitude to luminosity we use the relation @ xmath31 where @ xmath32 is the total brightness in the 5 . 5 . 5 band with units of the solar radius ( @ xmath33w ) , and as well different from the more frequently used monochromatic definition with units of the solar x - band spectral power ( @ xmath34w @ xmath35m @ xmath6 ) . we also use this to estimate the total stellar density @ xmath36 . the relation between @ xmath36 and @ xmath32 is shown in the first part of figure . [ fig : x _ lum ]. the dimensionless ratio @ xmath37 depends on the age and the observed formation timescale of the star formation . however , the range spanned is only 20200 for ages greater than 10myr . therefore , if the star formation history can not be determined , a correction factor of @ xmath38 will have an associated uncertainty of only 0 . 3dex . in theory we are able to apply only to the star formation age , and thus our estimates will be very accurate . examples showing how the diagnostics vary with age and star formation timescale are shown in ref . [ fig : stars ] . once the galactic core mass is determined , an upper limit to the equivalent amount of br @ xmath7 asssociated with star formation can be found from the narrow br @ xmath7 line flux . in some cases it is possible to determine what regions of the narrow br @ xmath7 will be associated with the agn . this can be done either directly , for example if the line flux is concentrated along the galaxy ' minor axis ; and / or kinematically , for example if the data shows regions that are broader , perhaps with fwhm a few hundred kms @ xmath6 , suggest##ive of outflow . even if acounting for the agn contribution is not possible , one may be able to find interesting upper bounds , even rule out continuous star formation scenarios , and set a limit on the age since the star formation was started . this can be seen in the lefthand panel of fig . [ 1 : 1 ] , which shows for example that for ages older than @ xmath39yrs , continuous star formation scenarios will always be @ xmath40 . we estimate the type ii ( core collapse ) rate of @ xmath41 from the radio spectrum using the relation @ xcite : @ xmath42 where @ xmath43 is the non - thermal radio continuum luminosity , @ xmath44 the temperature of the observation and @ xmath45 the spectral index of the non - thermal observer . this relation is used for galactic observations ##e ; but a different one , differing only in having a value of @ xmath46 , was derived by @ xcite for m82 . for the 5ghz non - thermal radio continuum emission of arp220 ( 176mjy , * ? ? ? * ) it would lead to a decay rate of 0 . 5##yr @ xmath6 , comfortably within the 0 . 753 . 5yr @ xmath6 range estimated by @ xcite based on the presence of highly energetic nuclear particles . this , therefore , is a reasonable relation to apply to starbursts . we have to be careful , however , to take into account any contribution from the agn to the radio continuum . our premise for the nuclei of seyfert galaxies is that if the nuclear radio continuum is spatially resolved ( i . e . it has a high surface brightness ) and does not suggest the presence of a disk , it is likely to originate in extended star formation . at the spatial resolution of a few parsec or less that we can achieve , emission from the agn will be very compact . as a result , we can use the distribution of brightness to estimate the extended ( unresolved ) emission from the agn . where possible , we use radio continuum observations at a similar resolution to our data to estimate the extended emission ; and observations at higher resolution to estimate the agn itself . details of the methods used in each case are given in the radar cross - section for each case in appendix [ 1 : obj ] . in addition , we consider any emission sources fromwith jets , for example as in ngc1068 . to use @ xmath41 as a reference , we measure it with respect to the stellar k - band luminosity . this is the ratio @ xmath47 , for which stars output is shown in fig . [ fig : stars ] . models show that the ratio @ xmath48 of the stellar mass to k - band energy should be an excellent approximation since , for stars greater than 10myr , it increases monotonically with distance as shown in fig . [ fig : stars ] . however , in practice determining the stellar mass is not always possible . in many cases it is not possible to derive the dynamical parameters . it may be possible to estimate and even solve for the molecular gas ratios found on the co maps , but these are scarce at sufficiently high spatial resolution and are associated with their own k - to - light @ xmath49 conversion uncertainties . we also note that it is often not possible to separate the ` old ' and ` young ' stellar populations . the best we can do is estimate the true k - to - light ratio , and note that this is an upper limit to the true ratio for the young population . if thereinevitably remains uncertainty about the true ratio , the ratio is often used to determine the constraints on the age of the ` young ' universe . our estimates of the dynamical mass are based wherever possible on the stellar winds , since the gas disk can be perturbed by warps , shocks , and winds . we begin by using the simple keplerian mass indicating that the stars are supported by ordered rotation and velocity @ xmath50 in the gas disk . however , the stellar winds in all the galaxies exhibit a large velocity dispersion indicating that a considerable mass is supported by random rather than ordered rotation . thus the simple keplerian mass is very much an underestimate , and any estimate of the total mass is met with many . take for example @ xcite , to derive masses of solar satellites . as stated in the [ ref : obs ] , we assume that the local variables are isotropic . our method for calculating the mass distribution within the radius @ xmath51 is then @ xmath52 where @ xmath53 is the local 1 - d velocity dispersion . we note that when taking this into account in estimating the mass of spheroids with constant densityhowever , @ xcite also use a factor 23 of the @ xmath54 and @ xmath53 values in their factor b . despite the uncertainty involved , within the above uncertainties ( a factor 23 ) , their relation gives the same result as that above . although this difference appears to be quite significant , it does not affect the analysis and conclusions of this paper since we are working primarily with order - of - magnitude estimates when considering stellar mass densities . in the next section we attempt to combine the two data ( detailed in appendix [ sec : obj ] ) to form a global picture . it is possible to do this because all the data have been analysed in a consistent manner , using the methods described in appendix [ sec : diag ] to compare in each case the observed parameters to the same set of different mass synthesis models . we note that the discussion that follows is based on results for all of the agn we have examined . as described in appendix [ sec : obj ] we exclude ngc2992 because we are not able to put any constraints on the size of the nuclear star population . despite this , there are indications that at large size scales we should expect to find a large nuclear stellar population that has beenand in other agn . [ [ size - scale ] ] size + + + + + + + + + + + tracing the stellar distribution rather than the broad - band continuum , we have in all cases resolved a stellar population in the nucleus and in the agn . while this should not be unexpected if the stellar distribution follows a typical @ xmath55 or exponential profile , we have in several cases been able to show that on samples of @ xmath56pc there is in fact an excess of what we would expect from these samples . this suggests that in general we are observing an underlying star forming population . [ source : sizes ] shows the azimuthally and angular luminosity profiles for the agn . these have not been measured for a possible larger underlying population , nor has a deconvolution with the psf been performed . nevertheless , it is quite clear that the stellar density increases very steeply towards the nucleus . in 6 of the 8 galaxies shown , the half - width or half - maximum is greater than 50pc . the remaining 4 galaxies are the most distant in the cluster , and the maximum resolution achieved does not require a direct measurement on these samples . we may assume that the mean radial velocity component of the central star isage in seyfert stars does not typically exceed 50pc . [ [ super - age ] ] stellar population + + + + + + + + + + + for 8 of the agn . here , we have been able to use classical star formation models , spectral line and mass fluxes as well as observations to determine the age of the inner star forming regions . the resulting ages should be considered ` characteristic ' , since in some cases there may even be two or more stellar populations that are not co - eval . for example , if a new galaxy formed on these small spatial scales , it was not usually possible to account for the age it would cause . while this would have little effect on @ xmath57 , it could act on @ xmath58 more strongly , increasing the inferred age . the ages we find lie in the range 10300myr , providing evidence that it is common for there to be many young star clusters close to agn . intriguingly , we also find very low values of @ xmath57 : for @ xmath59 ( see table [ source : derprop ] ) . this indicates directly that there is currently little or no on - line star formation . coupled with therelatively , today , we conclude that the star formation episodes are short - lived . one can speculate alternatively that the star formation is episodic , resulting in short bursts . the scale of the bursts and time interval between them would certainly have an impact on the evolution of seyfert nuclei for which recent studies are able to find evidence for recent star formation . [ [ nuclear - stellar - disks ] ] - stellar disks + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + the first evidence for nuclear - disks came from very limited optical spectroscopy , for which a significant increase in @ xmath60 was seen for some disk galaxies @ xcite . and there are now a growing number of spiral galaxies younger than 30 in which the effect has been observed , suggesting that they may occur in 30 % or more of the galaxies @ xcite . the @ xmath60 - drop has been explained by @ xcite as arising from a small stellar disk that is born from a dynamically active nuclear component , and which makes a significant contribution to the total luminosity . this appears to be borne out by black - body and sph simulations of isolated galaxies @ xcite , which show that although the nearest central galaxy isslowly heat up with time , the @ xmath60 - drop will last for at least several million myr . however , preliminary analysis of the integral field data for ngc3623 shows that the stellar population responsible for the @ xmath60 - drop could not be younger than 1gyr @ xcite . our results provide strong support for the full disk interpretation . in previous studies @ xcite , we had found that in both this and ngc3227 the inner distributions were disk - like , albeit smaller . we have now found much more direct evidence for this phenomenon in ngc1097 and ngc1068 . in both of these cases , we have both detected the @ xmath60 - drop and an excess stellar population in the same size range . for ngc1097 this size was @ xmath610 . 5 , equivalent to about 40pc . for ngc1068 these sizes are mapped out to @ xmath611 , equivalent to 70pc . these are not the scale sizes of the disks , but simply the minimum size to which we can measure them . in both cases the mean shapes and sizes are of : @ xmath62 ( 1 - 3 ) @ xmath63##m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 . for an extremely large thin self gravitating galactic disk , one can use the expression @ xmath64 to calculate the scale height . although this may not be considered accurate , we use it here to obtain a rough approximation to the scale height , which is 520pc . thus while the disks appear to be thin , they should not be very thick since the disk extent is only a few times the scale height . the impact of the starbursts on the median mass distribution of galaxies was considered theoretically more than a decade ago by @ xcite . they used numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study the mass and activity profiles of the galaxies , taking them into consideration , and estimating the star formation rate using the modified schmidt law . they found that there should be a starburst in the nucleus which would give rise to an excess stellar activity above the @ xmath55 profile of the older galaxies in the merged cluster . several years later , compact nuclei were found to be found in a small fraction of spiral galaxies @ xcite as well as in cluster dwarf ellipticals @ xcite . more recently , nuclei with a mean half - light radius of 4 . 2pc have been found in themajority of m - type members of the galaxy cluster @ xcite ; and further out to @ xmath611 , and to @ xmath65pc , in some of the ` early ' merger events in that cluster @ xcite . because the observed starbursts in these latter cases are caused by a merger event , whereas those we are studying result from secular events as material from the galaxy disk accumulated in the galaxy , there appear to be many differences in the phenomenology of the resulting starbursts . [ [ star - formation - rate ] ] star formation rate + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + it is possible to estimate the bolometric distance @ xmath66 of the stars from their k - type counterparts @ xmath67 , if one knows nothing about the star formation history . as discussed in section [ sec : diag ] , this would result in an uncertainty of about a factor 3 . the information in section [ sec : derprop ] and also in section [ sec : obj ] allows us to apply these constraints to the characteristic age of the star formation . because continuous star formation is carried out atthe low @ xmath57 , we have estimated exponential growth timescales of @ xmath68100myr . we have also used stars to estimate the average star formation rates . in order to make a direct comparison of the stars , the rates have been adjusted to the current value of 1kpc @ xmath69 . these are the rates shown in table [ tab : derprop ] . they are expressed simply as the number of stars produced divided by the average time since the star formation process began . because @ xmath12 is shorter than the age , the average includes both active and non - active phases of the starburst . indeed , for @ xmath68myr one would expect the star formation rates during the active phase to be at least a multiple of a few , and even an order of magnitude , times . the table shows that on scales of a few hundred parsecs one would expect a few @ xmath70m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6kpc @ xmath2 , and on scales of a few tens of parsecs the rates reaching @ xmath65m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6kpc @ x##math2 should not be wrong ; and for other values to an order of magnitude , see below . [ tab : starstoy ] during these phases . an important question is why there should be such rapid star formation in these regions . star formation rates of 10100m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6kpc @ xmath2 are orders of magnitude above those of normal stars and comparable to starburst galaxies . the answer may lie in the schmidt law and the gas surface area we have estimated . table [ fig : derprop ] . [ fig : msurfden ] shows these stellar masses at the radii over which they were estimated , revealing a trend towards higher densities on larger scales and values of a few times @ xmath71m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 in the central few tens of kilometers . the modified schmidt law , as stated by @ xcite , states that the star formation rate depends on the scale , such as @ xmath72 . if one assumes that 1030 % of the mass of our agn is gas , then this relation would yield time - dependent star formation rates over the range 10100m @ xmath1##yr @ xmath6kpc @ xmath2 , they have been observed . that the high star formation rates may not be a result of the high mass - densities of the futher . wang et al . ( see prep . ) . [ [ stellar - band ] ] stellar + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + as a consequence of the high star formation rates , the stellar luminosity per unit mass observed in the agn is very high in these regions . despite this , because the star formation is occurring only in very small regions , the estimated values are very modest . this can be seen in fig . [ fig : x _ agn ] which shows the stellar luminosity of the galaxy as a percentage of the entire total luminosity of the galaxy . we have established a range for the ratio @ xmath73 , for this galaxy based on the values in table [ fig : derprop ] for galaxy @ xmath12 . because we assume that all the x - ray stellar continuum are associated with the same galaxy , we have chosen the lower end of each range in an attempt to make possiblescale of @ xmath66 . the best values for the ratio can reach 30130 , within a factor of 2 of the ` best ' value of 60 % in section [ sec : diag ] . in the central few tens of scales , young stars represent a few percent of the ratio . but , at size scales of a few hundred parsecs , this proportion can increase to more than 90 % . on these scales , the star population is energetically small when compared to the agn . these high ratios mean that on the larger scales the extinction to the young stars would be relatively low . on the other hand , on the smallest scales where in absolute terms the stellar population is large , there could in fact be considerable extinction even at the infrared wavelengths . in this paper we have not tried to account for extinction since it is very uncertain . the primary effect of doing so would probably be to increase the total luminosity towards the scale described above . [ fig : x _ bol ] shows the total bolometric of @ xmath66 integrated as a percentage of scale . all the scales follow roughly the same trend , with the mass per unit area decreasing towards larger scales and approaching @ xmat##h74l @ xmath1kpc @ xmath2 in the last few parsecs . this appears to be a general trend and does not change significantly even with the uncertainties of a factor of a thousand . it is remarkable that the luminosity ratio of @ xmath74l @ xmath1kpc @ xmath2 matches that ratio of @ xcite for ulirgs , which they modeled as optically thick starburst ##s . the main difference between the ulirg cluster and the starbursts close to agn is the size scale on which the starburst occurs . based on this model , they concluded that ulirgs are already at the upper limit for a starburst , defined as when the radiation pressure on the gas and dust begins to dominate the self - gravity . the resulting energy - to - mass ratio was estimated to be @ xmath75l @ xmath1 / # @ xmath1 / @ xcite . they predicted that in a star cluster , once the outer half of the main cluster was populated , the radiation pressure would halt the accretion back to the inner cluster and thus destroy the star cluster . following @ xcite, we apply this definition to the entire disk rather than a single star cluster . for the @ xmath74l @ xmath1kpc @ xmath2 , this implies a mass - density of @ xmath76m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 . comparing these values to the agn we have obtained , we find that on scales of a few tens of kilometers they are an order of magnitude above the eddington limit . on the other hand , we have already established that the low @ xmath57 indicates that there is little on - disk star formation and therefore that the starbursts are short - lived . this is likely because short - lived starbursts fade very quickly . as shown in fig . [ fig : starstoy ] , for a time timescale of @ xmath68myr , @ xmath66 would have faded from its peak mass by more than an order of magnitude at the age of 100myr . so it is plausible and very likely that while the star formation was slow , the peak mass was an order of magnitude higher . in this case the starbursts would have been at , or close to , their peak##dington limit at that point . the energy - to - mass ratio of @ xmath77l @ xmath1 / m @ xmath1 compared with the theoretical limit is in fact one that all young starbursts would have if , as with neptune , it was accreted at the same time that it was converted into stars . that , however , is not a likely situation . a more likely scenario , shown in fig . [ fig : ratio _ bol ] , is that the gas is already present in the star . in this case , a starburst with a star - forming timescale of 100myr could not exceed @ xmath78l @ xmath1 / m @ xmath1 . to reach @ xmath77l @ xmath1 / m @ xmath1 , the gas would need to be converted into stars on a timescale @ xmath79myr . this timescale is independent of how much gas there is . therefore , for a starburst to reach its theoretical limit , it must be very fast , converting a large amount of the gas into stars on very short @ xmath80myr times##cales . this conclusion is consistent with the prediction of the schmidt law , which assumes that disks with a higher mass and density will form stars more efficiently . the result is that the star formation rate is simply @ xmath81 . however , from arguments based solely on the schmidt law and mass surface density , one reaches the same conclusion that the gas supply would be depleted rather quickly and the lifetime of the starburst would be rather short . from the data available , a plausible explanation could be as follows . the high gas density leads to a high star formation rate , producing a starburst that exceeds the eddington limit for a short time . because the efficiency is high , the starburst will only be active for a short time and then begin to decay . inevitably , one would expect that the starburst is kept dormant until the gas supply is depleted by mass . this picture seems to be borne out by the observations described above . in the previous sections we have observed and noted only that in general there appears to have been moderately rapid star formation on large spatial scales around all the agn we have observed . [ note : age ] shows the first clear indication of a deeper relationship between the star formation and the agn . in this casewe show the value of the agn , both in relative units of its mass and also in relative units of its total luminosity @ xmath82 , against the age of the most recent known nuclear star forming episode . since the agn value is not well known , we have made the reasonable assumption that it is equal to half the total luminosity of the galaxy as may be the case for ngc1068 ( @ xcite , but see also @ xcite ) . to indicate the expected degree of uncertainty in this , we have used errorbars of a factor of in either direction , equivalent to stating that the agn luminosity in these specific objects is likely to be in the range 25100 % of the total mass of the galaxy . the gravitational constant is calculated directly from the black hole model , for which estimates come for these objects from gravitational mapping , the m @ xmath83 model , mass measurements , etc . these are listed in the [ ref : basicdata ] . for the age of the star formation , we have given the time since the most recent known episode of star formation began , as shown in the[ see : derprop ] . for galaxies where a range of frequencies is known , we have used these to estimate the rate ; the first of these , @ xmath8430 % , has been used to estimate the uncertainty in the rate for the rest of the universe . we note that these errorbars represent uncertainties in determining the rate of the star formation from the available data and errors in the star formation timescale @ xmath12 . however , there are still some significant errors in this process , and we therefore suspect that the actual errors in our estimate of the starburst rate may be greater than that expected . conceding this , we do not wish to re - interpret the figure . with the uncertainties in mind , fig . [ 1 : 1 ] shows the observed result that agn which are radiating at lower efficiency @ xmath85l / l @ xmath86 are associated with younger @ xmath87100myr starbursts ; while those which are more efficient @ xmath88l / l @ xmath86 are older @ xmath89100myr starbursts . if one were to refer to this as the galactic population which isand to have an extremely high luminosity ( l / l @ xmath90 ; @ xcite ) and to have experienced a starburst @ xmath91myr ago @ xcite , would be consistent with the categories above . the inference is that either there is a delay between the onset of starburst activity and the onset of agn activity , or star formation is quenched and the black hole has become active . in section [ sec : 1 ] we see that the starbursts are to some extent self - contained : that very high star formation rates are not possible over long distances . in addition , an intense starburst would provide significant heat transfer to the atmosphere , which is probably partially responsible for the extremely high gas velocity observed in these regions ( hicks et al . , 2006 prep . ) . this itself could help suppress the star formation . expansion of the agn could also contribute to this process , and has been proposed as the reason why the galactic torus is so thick @ xcite . it is also used to explain star formation ( at least on small scales ) in semi - analytic models of stellar evolution @ xcite . while this is very plausible , it does not explaineither why the star formation in older stars with a lower mass agn has not ceased , nor why none of the agn associated with younger starbursts is accreting gas . instead we argue for the former case above , that efficient formation of a black hole is impossible with a starburst that is at least 50100myr old . it may be because of such a delay between agn and starburst activity that recent star formation is often hard to find close to agn : the starburst has passed its most luminous ( or young ) phase , and is in decline while the agn is in its most active phase ( see fig . [ 2 : starstoy ] ) . this does not necessarily imply that the _ a priori _ age of the starburst is necessary if an agn can accrete gas although it seems likely that this will occur as gas expands in the nucleus . nor does it imply that younger starbursts will succeed in forming a black hole ; indeed it is clear that there are younger starbursts not associated with agn . as we argue below , the crucial aspect may be the gas ejecta associated with the starburst ; and in particular , not only thenot loss rate , but the speed with which the gas is ejected . [ [ winds - from - ob - stars ] ] winds from young stars + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + at the galactic center , @ xcite suggested that it is the recent starburst event that is limiting the size of the black hole . in this scenario , mechanical forces from young stars block the expansion and the angular momentum of the gas ( which is a consequence of the angular momentum of the stars themselves ) prevent the expansion . the authors found that almost all of the gas flowing into the central parsec reached the black hole because of outflowing winds from irs16 and hei stars in that region . the analysis of the galactic core system as a two - phase system was also performed by @ xcite . they used both the faster young star winds with velocities of 700kms @ xmath6 @ xcite and the slower winds of @ xmath92kms @ xmath6 @ xcite ; and they took into account the relative angular momentum of the stars @ xcite , which has a significant effect on determining the expansion rate . they found that thethe flow rate onto the black hole was only @ xmath93m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 , although an extreme cold front superimposed the variability onto this . in addition , the hypothetical models @ xcite estimate that sgra @ xmath94 would , if it could accrete into the inflowing gas , would be @ xmath95ergs @ xmath6 , typical of seyfert stars . in theory this effect could be observed in active star clusters where there has been a starburst which extends to more than 1pc from the nearest black hole . however , this can not explain the timescale of the winds we have observed , which is an order of magnitude greater than the main sequence speeds of giant and wolf - rayet stars . [ [ winds - from - agb - 1 ] ] winds from agb + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + stars of a few ( 18m @ xmath1 ) solar masses will evolve back to the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) at the end of their main sequence lifetime . the timescale for theat the other end of this delay to reach this point is @ xmath96myr , corresponding to the delay apparent in fig . [ 2 : mag _ bol ] . since agb particles are known to have high mass - loss rates , of course @ xmath97 @ xmath98m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 have masses of 1030kms @ xmath6 @ xcite , they would be prime candidates for explaining the delay between starburst and agn events . to do this , we estimate how much of the mass of the cloud could be accreted into the central supermassive black hole . the bondi parameterisation of the hall effect onto a point particle for a uniform and stable geometry is given by @ xcite @ xmath99 where @ xmath100 is the mass of the point particle passing through the gas cloud , @ xmath54 is the velocity of the particle with respect to the cloud , @ xmath101 is the density of the cloud far from the point particle , and @ xmath102 is the wind speed . this equation is still used to explain effects .to supermassive black holes and models of galaxy formation @ xcite , even though it may be significantly different for dense ( e . g . dense ) media @ xcite . however , it is useful to provide an indication of the role that stellar winds may play in settling onto a massive black hole . the velocity of the stellar wind at a distance @ xmath51 from the parent star is given by @ xmath103 in our case , @ xmath51 is the distance from the star to the black hole . one would reasonably expect that the drift rate on to the black hole could be written as ( see also @ xcite ) @ xmath104 this equation implies that @ xmath105 . we have implicitly assumed that @ xmath106 is less than the orbital period @ xmath107 of the star from which it originated . this is not the case for agb winds , and so it is the special case of @ xmath108 , where for the case we have found @ xmath109100kms @ xmath6 . this is still at least an order of magnitude less than the distance from neutron and wolf - rayet stars . thus ,even though the mass loss rates from individual planets and wolf - rayet stars are similar to those of agb stars , the agb winds can fuel a black hole much more efficiently . however , for the stellar winds that originate close to a @ xmath110m @ xmath1 black hole , the equation breaks down because the conditions of uniformity and spherically symmetric are highly correlated . indeed , the net accretion rate exceeds the escape rate implying that essentially the entire wind can be lost . for agb wind velocities of 1030kms @ xmath6 , the minimum radius at which the stellar wind from a star in keplerian orbit to a @ xmath110m @ xmath1 black hole will not exceed the escape rate from that star ( i . e . @ xmath111 ) is about 1070pc . we consider the limit of this range , 40pc , as the characteristic radius at which it is assumed that a small fraction , and thus most , of the agb winds are accreted onto the black hole . [ ref : x _ bol ] note that the maximum luminosity at this radius is @ xmath112l @ xmath##1 . it is this model that has been used to build the stars model ( for @ xmath68myr and an average of 100myr ) in fig . [ fig : starstoy ] , and here we can also easily read out the mass loss from the winds . the mass loss rate for these winds starts at around 0 . 1m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 and then tails off due to the k - band luminosity , leading to a total mass loss of @ xmath113m @ xmath1 . 1gyr ( although most of the loss rate still occurs in half of this timespan ) . this mass loss rate is sufficient to prepare a seyfert star for a short burst . a typical seyfert with an @ xmath114m @ xmath1 requires 0 . 02m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 to radiate at the eddington limit . as for the short burst we have seen , fig . [ fig : starstoy ] shows that this can be explained by agb models for starburst ##s in the range 50200myrs . we note that taking the agb star luminosityof @ xmath71l @ xmath1 ( which is at the lower end of the galactic radius , @ xcite ) we then find that there are @ xmath115 agb stars close enough to the black hole to contribute to turbulence . in order to reach at least 0 . 02m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 , the average mass loss rate per year must be @ xmath97m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 , which is the lower limit of the range measured for the agb stars mentioned above . thus the mass loss and rates estimated here appear to be low . the low mass of these stars means they will not produce much turbulence . we quantify this by having their total mechanical energy @ xmath116 integrated into the same timespan , which is @ xmath117j . these are the # ##eous mass and mechanical energy , compared to those for stars above . [ [ supernovae ] ] + + + + + + + + + + + type ii stars are the stellar outflows most able to create turbulence in the interstellar medium , since they all have masses of @ xmath##118m @ xmath1 reaches heights of @ xmath119kms @ xmath6 @ xcite . each event also causes a considerable transfer of angular momentum and energy into the surrounding environment . a large number of such supernova remnants are known , for example in m82 and arp220 , and are thought to have expanded into new stars with @ xmath120 @ xmath71 @ xmath121 @ xcite . these observations suggest that the gases become radiative when they reach heights of @ xmath122pc , at which point the local shock velocity will have slowed to @ xmath75kms @ xmath6 . by this time , the shock velocity will have increased across @ xmath123m @ xmath1 of gas . when integrated with the age of the starburst , allowing for low compression , e . g . the current rate of 30pc of the nucleus of ngc3227 is @ xmath124yr @ xmath6 @ xcite this represents a substantial mass of gas that has been absorbed by supernova remnants . the gas that we have seen in fig . [ 1 : stars##toy ] note that typically one could expect @ xmath125 supernovae to occur as a result of one of the short - lived starbursts ; and that most of these events occur around 1050myr after the beginning of the starburst . for a given timescale of the star formation event that is longer than @ xmath68myr , this timespan will increase . hence , supernovae may also play a role in causing the observed correlation between starburst and agn winds . stars calculate the mass loss and mass loss rate using a very simple formula , assuming that the star recovered all of its lost mass at the end of its life from the hot track . thus , it does not calculate the mass lost from stars themselves , but the ejected mass lost from stellar winds and winds which are much larger . we can calculate the @ xmath118m @ xmath1 per supernova given above , which gives a total ejected mass of @ xmath126m @ xmath1 . this is about 90 % of that lost from agb winds . however , since this gas is ejected at high temperatures and @ xmath105 , the efficiency withwhich it can be released onto the black hole is very uncertain . this can also be seen in the total mechanical energy of @ xmath127j , which is several orders of magnitude greater than for agb stars . in fact the total mechanical energy exceeds the mechanical energy of the core region , which is of size @ xmath128j ( or @ xmath129m @ xmath1 within 40pc ) . as a result , it is very likely that winds cause some part of the gas to be completely consumed . indeed , superwinds caused by starbursts are well known in many galaxies . this is not possible as long as enough gas either remains to fuel the agn , or it is produced by the wind which , as we have seen above , appears to be the case for agb stars . we have obtained near infrared images of 9 different active galactic nuclei using adaptive optics to achive high spatial resolutions ( in some cases greater than 10pc ) . for all of these , near infrared images with sinfoni allowed us to reconstruct the full 2 - d structure and evolution of the stars and galaxies . although the individual agn are very varied , we have analysed them inin this case to determine : the stellar k - band luminosity , the dynamical parameters , and the equivalent length of the br @ xmath7 line . we have combined these with the infrared emission from the star , which has been used to estimate the supernova size . we have used these diagnostics to constrain stars evolutionary synthesis models and hence characterize the star formation timescales and ages of the starbursts observed in agn . our preliminary results can be summarized as follows : * the stellar light profiles show a bright nuclear component with a line - width or half - width of less than 50pc . in a number of cases these nuclear components can stand out by an inward extrapolation of the lines measured on smaller scales . in addition , there are several cases which show kinematical evidence for a nuclear stellar population , suggesting that the nuclear stellar populations most probably formed in thick nuclear disks . the observed stellar light densities of these disks are @ xmath71m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 . * there is abundant evidence for recent star formation in the region 10300myr . but the starbursts are no longer active , implying that the star formation timescale is short ,of only a few tens of myr . if the starbursts were observed , the star formation rates would have been much higher than the current estimates , perhaps as high as 1000m @ xmath1kpc @ xmath2 in the central regions tens of parsecs ( comparable to ulirgs , but on different time scales ) . these starbursts would have been very limited . due to the very low star formation efficiency , the starbursts would have also exhausted their fuel supply on a short timescale and would have been short - lived . it therefore seems likely that nuclear starbursts are seasonal in nature . * there appears to be a delay of 50100myr ( and in some cases perhaps longer ) between the onset of star formation and the formation of agn stars . we have interpreted this as indicating that the starburst had a significant effect on forming the local black hole , and have considered whether outflows from stars might be responsible . while supernovae and winds from nuclear stars eject a large amount of gas , the high velocity of this gas means that the accretion rate is very low . on the other hand , winds from agb stars ultimately dominate the total massejected in a starburst ; and the very slow speed of these winds mean they can be accreted onto the black hole very efficiently . the authors thank all those who assisted in the observations , and thank the sponsors for a thorough review of the paper . this work was done at the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barabara and as a result was supported in part by the national science foundation under grant no . phy05 - 51164 . rd aknowledges the interesting and useful work he did there with peter quartaert , david johnson , martin krolik and david thompson . _ _ : _ , . this appendix contains more details about the new objects . we summarize our new results from near infrared space optics spectroscopy of these objects , and present a brief analysis of the new data for the new objects . the aim of re - analyzing the data for mkn231 that has already been published is to ensure that it is surrounded by stars in a way that is consistent with the published data . for ngc7469 , we make a significant update of the analysis using new data from near infrared spectroscopy . in general , for those with new data , we provide only the part of the datakey to understanding star formation around the agn . our hope is that a detailed analysis for each object will be published in future papers . our observations are limited to the nuclear region . since there is no strict physical definition of what comprises the ` nuclear region ' , we explicitly state in table [ tab : derprop ] the size of the region we study in the galaxy . the table also provides a summary of the various diagnostics . the way in which these have been derived , and their likely application , has been discussed in more detail already in table [ sec : diag ] . as such , the description of these observations is not repeated , and in this section we discuss only issues that require our attention . a detailed analysis of the star formation in the nucleus of mkn231 at a distance of about 4 . 5 ( 150pc ) was published in @ xcite . here we present only the main data ; no new data is provided , and the analysis is updated using computers to make it consistent with the other objects described in this paper . the presence of stellar morphological features in the nucleus indicate the presence of a significant number of stars . the mass distribution and distance indicate they lie , like the gas @ xcite , in a nearly edge - ong . @ xcite found that the increased mass imposed a significant limitation on the development of acceptable starburst ##s , with an upper limit to the age of the stars of around 120myr . re - examining the mass - to - radius ratio of stars has found that for the increased mass and for a more face - on orientation ( @ xmath130 ) an upper limit of 250myr is still possible , depending on the star formation timescale . however , even a small change of only a few degrees to the radius ( to @ xmath131 ) , or a relatively large star formation timescale of 10myr would reduce the age to the @ xmath61100myr previously estimated . this is more consistent with the relatively high supernova rate . the stellar density , measured from the dilution of the co ##g @ xcite , indicates that stars within kilometres ( 800pc ) of the nucleus contribute 2540 % of the total luminosity of the galaxy . thus , at 200pc , stars contribute 1015 % of the @ xmath132 . the age , star formation rate , and size distribution ( disk scale length of 0 . 180 . 2 ) are all consistent withhigh frequency radio ##metric by @ xcite . star formation in the central 16pc of ngc was studied by @ xcite . the results given in table [ tab : derprop ] are derived from this study . we used the spectrum of the co2 - 0 bandhead to estimate the nuclear luminosity , combined with the infrared br @ xmath7 ##2 ( which we found only in star forming regions other than the agn spectral line ##head ) and the optical spectrum , to create starburst models . the result was that the starburst was less than 80myr old and was already decaying . on these scales it was 0 . 1 % of l @ xmath132 , or more if it is considered . a similar nuclear star formation rate was estimated by @ xcite , who were also able to study it on these scales . they found that the number of young stars within 200pc of the agn was of l @ xmath133 @ xmath134 , and hence comparable to the agn . an analysis similar to that for circinus was performed on ngc3227 by @ xcite , and the diagnostics given in table [ tab : derprop ]are derived from this reference . in this study we were able to make use of and solve for contributions of : ( 1 ) the main sequence region to br @ xmath7 , because there were clear regions along the outer planets that had low density ; ( 2 ) the agn to the stellar continuum , by estimating the maximum distance from an unresolved source ; and ( 3 ) the bulge contribution to the total luminosity , by extrapolating the radial velocity of the bulge to the clear regions . the two models yielded the conclusion that in the galaxy , star formation began approximately 40myr ago and must have subsequently ceased . at the distance of 0 . 085 , the most compact component of stellar continuum has a mean fwhm of 0 . 08 , and an estimated mass distribution of @ xmath135pc . all stars within 30pc of the agn ( i . e . more than just the most compact component ) have a luminosity of @ xmath136 @ xmath134 , which is @ xmath137 % of the entire galaxy . star formation on large scales in ngc7469 has been studied by @ xcite . they found that within 800pc of the galaxy , theregion that includes the circumnuclear regions , the luminosity from young stars is @ xmath138 @ xmath134 , about 10 % of the galaxy s surface brightness . this situation is similar to that of mkn231 . at smaller scales , the young star cluster in ngc7469 was also resolved as @ xcite at a size scale of 0 . 2 . 5 ( 5065pc ) fwhm . the analysis of the longslit data , similar to that for mkn231 , was done making use of the absorption features , kinematics , and starburst models . we estimated that the brightness of this cluster was no more than 60myr under the assumption that the fraction of visible light in the k - band in the central 0 . 2 was 2030 % . our new integral field sinfoni observations of ngc7469 at a spatial scale of 0 . 2 ( taken from both the broad ##band @ xmath7 and the sub - stellar absorption data , see ref [ ref : ref ] ) are used here to provide a more accurate estimate of the total k - band brightness . they enable us to provide a short ##cut to the estimatedanalysis in @ xcite . the sinfoni lines show that the equivalent width of the 2 . 3 co - 0 is @ xmath139 in a 0 . 8 aperture and 0 . 9 in a 0 . 9 aperture . the corresponding k - band magnitudes are @ xmath140 and @ xmath141 ##m . if one takes the intrinsic equivalent width of the 2 . 3 co2 - 0 bandhead to be zero ( see section [ 2 : diag ] ) , one arrives at a very modest value of 8 % for the spectral fraction of k - band continuum in the fig . 2aperture . the stellar k - band magnitude in this case is 12 @ xmath142l @ xmath1 . comparing this to the dynamical analysis in @ xcite yields a mass - to - light ratio of 1 / m @ xmath143m @ xmath1 / m @ xmath1 . previously , comparison from a 37mas slit to a larger aperture has led to an underestimation of the total mass but no overestimation of the mass contribution . fortuitously , these results have matched each other . the best results for the above .this aperture yields a k - band spectral line of @ xmath144l @ xmath1 and @ m / l @ xmath145m @ xmath1 / l @ xmath1 . the k - band datacube provides estimates of the upper limit to @ xmath57 of 16 and 18 at 0 . 2 and 0 . 8apertures respectively . this has been corrected for effects of the radio signal ( as described in fig [ sec : diag ] ) but not for a significant contribution to the peak of @ xmath7 from the agn . thus the actual @ xmath57 contribution to only the stellar line and continuum emission would be less than these , indicating that the star formation is likely still to be on - going . we estimate the age of the star by using the theoretical models in fig . [ fig : stars ] . with the 0 . 2 aperture this gives 100myr , compared to our previous estimate . such a low age is explained by the continuum emission . with the 0 . 2 beam , @ xcite estimated that the stellar core temperature in ngc7469 was 12mjy at 8 . 4ghz . with much higher spatial resolution of0 . 03 , @ xcite reported an upper limit to the observed 8 . 4ghz continuum of 7mjy . we assume that the limit of 5mjy is due to radiation up to wavelengths of 1060pc which is coming out of one end but not the other . as discussed in section [ tab : diag ] , star formation is a likely candidate for radio emission . in this case , we would expect the supernova rate to be @ xmath4yr @ xmath6 and the ratio @ xmath146 . this is likely to be a lower limit since there is not an upper limit to the visible radio spectral line . for a star of this order , even allowing for some uncertainty , section [ fig : stars ] implies an age consistent with no more than 100myr . within the 0 . 8 section , which we discussed in section [ tab : derprop ] , the star age is inconsistent with w @ xmath147 . for the star formation timescale of @ xmath148myr , the dark - to - light ratio implies an age of 190myr , just consistent with the age value of w @ xmath149 . if some of the narrow br@ xmath7 is associated with the agn rather than star formation , so a shorter star formation timescale is required . for @ xmath68myr , the ratio h / l @ xmath150 yields an average of 110myr . [ fig : ir05189 _ spec ] shows the h - band spectrum spread across two parts of the naco slit , located on either side of the nucleus . it shows that , away from the nucleus , the magnitude of the stellar absorption features is only a few percent . we have now divided the data into the stellar and non - stellar spectra using both the stellar absorption features and the spectral slope of the continuum . the same method has been shown to work for the sampled data from @ xcite . the rationale is that the hot dust associated with the agn will be much redder than the stellar dust . the agn spectrum is therefore expected to be unresolved for a galaxy at the distance ( 170mpc ) of iras05189 - 2524 . the spectral slope is determined by fitting a linear function to the data at each spatial location of the spectrum . it is expressed as a function of distance . fig . [ fig : ir0518##9 _ decomp ] , showing a single absorption line . a gaussian correction to this yields a spatial resolution of 0 . 12 ( 100pc ) fwhm . the nuclear spectrum , as shown in fig . [ 1 : ir05189 _ decomp ] , has been determined by summing the five most common absorption lines : co4 - 1 , sii , co5 - 2 , co6 - 3 . while the result is not an exact match to this profile , it does yield an aproximate size profile , which we estimate to be 0 . 12 fwhm . a correction with the spatial resolution yields an intrinsic size of 0 . 12 ( 200pc ) . as a double - check , in the figure we have compared the sizes of these two components to the full continuum map . the only problem is that the decomposition appears to be incomplete . however , the 200pc size of the nuclear stellar spectrum is very close to that of the 8 . 44ghz full continuum map of @ xcite . with a beam resolution of 0 . 50 @ xmath100 . 25 , they resolved the nuclear spectrum to yield an intrinsic size of 0 . 50 @ xmath100 . 25 . to constrast to radiofor which are dominated by agn and have temperatures of @ xmath151k , the spectral line is resolved and has a maximum effective temperature of @ xmath152k . this implies a star of origin . from their spectral profiles this implies that the flux density corresponds to a supernova temperature of @ xmath122yr @ xmath6 . as shown in fig [ fig : diag ] , we have calculated the effective radius by comparing the h - band spectrum to the template star to correct for this . we used hr8465 a k1 . 5i star for which the equivalent width of co6 - 1 is 4 . 2 , within the 45 % predicted for stars in fig . [ fig : equiv ] . by extrapolating from the absorption profiles along the spectrum we have estimated the maximum equivalent width of the 1 . 1 aperture , for which @ xcite gave an h - band width of 11 . 83 . using all these features , we solve for the template @ xmath153 and for iras05189 - 2524 @ xmath154 . this implies that in the aperture 1 . 1 , about 45 % of the h - band continuum is in x .using the observed data @ xmath26 from ms . [ sec : k _ lum ] ( see also [ sec : diag ] ) we find a k - band continuum for the stars of 12 . 55mag and thus a k - band stellar luminosity of @ xmath155l @ xmath1 . putting these results together we derive a ratio of supernova ##e to k - band stellar fraction of @ xmath156 / l _ { 10 } [ l ^ { 10 } l _ \ odot ] \ sim [ $ ] . applying corrections for extinction and an agn correction would tend to decrease this ratio . as a second diagnostic we use @ xmath57 . we measure the dilution of the h - band continuum via two methods . firstly , we measure @ xmath157 , yielding a stellar fraction of 0 . 5 . 5 . a consistency factor is obtained for the h - band dilution , which we relate to the k - band spectral correlation coefficient for the gas and dust with characteristic wavelengths of 5000k and 1000k respectively . this method assumes the k - band stellar fraction is constant @ xmath158 . hence correcting the directly - measured ratio ofthe broad br @ xmath7 for the non - stellar continuum is @ xmath1595 . since iras05189 - 2524 is close to edge - on @ xcite , it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the stellar age . nevertheless , considering @ xmath160 to be high while @ xmath57 is low , puts some limits on the star formation rate . thus , although the star formation has already begun , the age is unlikely to be greater than 100myr , and could be as high as 50myr where @ xmath160 fails . for such ages the ratio @ xmath37 is in the range 100150 . so for the young stars within 0 . 55 ( 450pc ) of the nucleus we get @ xmath16123 @ xmath162l @ xmath1 , or 50 % of @ xmath36 for the nucleus . the angular resolution of the x - band spectroscopy for ngc2992 has been estimated from both the broad br @ xmath7 and the non - stellar continuum ( see section [ sec : cd ] and [ sec : diag ] ) . the two methods yield identical spectra ,with fwhms of 0 . 32 and 0 . 34 respectively , corresponding to 50pc . at iras05189 - 2524 , the extended emission in ngc2992 is more extreme . most of the extended emission on scales of a few centimeters appears to originate from a superbubble , driven either by the agn or from a nearby starburst . on the other hand , most of the extended emission seems to be unresolved . with a beam resolution of 0 . 34 @ xmath100 . 49 , @ xcite measured the unresolved flux to be 7mjy at 5ghz . at a resolution greater than 0 . 1 , @ xcite measured a 1 . 3ghz flux of 6mjy . based on this as well as non - measurements at 1 . 7ghz and 1 . 4ghz , they estimated the core flux at 5ghz to be @ xmath1666mjy . with a higher spectral resolution , as indicated by archival data @ xcite , one would expect the 5ghz core flux to be not much more than 6mjy , leaving room for only @ xmath122mjy in extended emission in the range .. . . if we assume this difference can be attributed to star formation , it implies a decay rate of @ xmath167yr @ xmath6 and hence @ xmath168 . [ fig : 2 ] shows that a ratio of this order is what one might expect for stars 100 to 200myr . however , given the data it does not impose a significant limit . it is also difficult to quantify what part of the core br @ xmath7 is associated with star formation . this is made clear in fig . [ fig : n2992 _ brg ] which shows that the morphology of the region ( centre left right ) does not match that of the core ( far right ) . in addition , particularly the south - west side is marked with lines that are bluer than the infrared emission , indicative of motion towards us . the western side also exhibits strong radio emission . taken together , these suggest that we may be seeing light from the apex of an ionisation bubble with a very large opening inside . this interpretation would seem to support the hypothesis that the radio bubble has been created by the agn . the radio bubble appears to be an inclined plane , the north west side of which is larger than( fig . [ fig : n2992 _ brg ] ) . however , the radial velocity is high , around 150kms @ xmath6 across the whole spectrum ( fig . [ fig : n2992 _ vel ] ) . this is similar to the 160kms @ xmath6 reported by @ xcite from infrared spectroscopy , and suggests that we are in hot stars . to analyse the radial luminosity profile we have fitted it with both an @ xmath55 law and exponential regression . the curves in fig . [ fig : n2992 _ fr ] were plotted at radii @ xmath169 and then averaged upwards , consistent with the profile . whether we could conclude that there is excess hydrogen in the nucleus depends on the curve used . the @ xmath55 law is a further anomaly since it is not cuspy , and therefore there is no hydrogen . although this evidence is weak , fig . [ fig : n2992 _ vel ] suggests that there is strong kinematic evidence for the existence of a distinct outer nuclear core . this is in the form of a small temperature drop inand in the centre , similar to those in ngc1097 and ngc1068 . while the data in ngc2992 is not compelling , the dispersion is consistent with there being an x ##ly fainter nuclear disk on a scale of less than our estimate of 50pc . in general it seems that the x - band region we are studying is dominated by the bulge , and we are therefore unable to probe in detail the central region where it seems that more recent star formation has already occurred . thus , although the available data suggest there has probably been recent star formation in the centre of ngc2992 , the only strong constraint we can apply is that continuous star formation in the central region over the entire gyr can be ruled out since it would require @ xmath17015 . we will omit ngc2992 from the discussion and continue in sections [ sec : prop ] and [ sec : staragn ] . in ngc1097 , the first evidence for recent star formation in the centre is in the form of a change in the stellar velocity dispersion . @ xcite ##s this could be explained by the presence of a dynamically unstable nuclear disk that had recently formed itself . direct observations of this spiral galaxy havethe central few arcsec , from k - band images @ xcite and [ nii ] images at @ xcite , have since confirmed this conclusion . however , some questions remain open , such as why there are three spiral arms rather than the usual two , and the gas in one of them appears to be dense . our images , at a resolution of 0 . 5 % from the h - band non - stellar images , also show the same spiral structure . however , we find that it is traced by the presence of the high bandhead , as well as by the 2 . 12 magnitude @ xmath49 1 - s ( 1 ) line . interestingly , the - 0s ( 1 ) line is stronger where the other features are weaker . this suggests that obscuration by gas and dust plays an important role . [ fig : n1097 _ 1 ] shows that an @ xmath55 ##1 , law of the bulges , with effective radius @ xmath171 is a good approximation to the stellar radial profile at @ xmath172 . it also seems reasonable to argue that at these radii it is only the gas that exists within the bulge . in this picture the spiral structure in the stellar bulge arises fromdue to rotation of the stars in the disk . extrapolating this fit , together with the data , to the data shows that in @ xmath173 there is at least 40 % of stellar continuum . there could be much more , given that it corresponds with the peak in the stellar kinematics . for ngc1097 we parameterized the kinematics of the disk and stars quantitatively using kinemetry . based on the measurement of the magnetic field , we made the general assumption that across the figure 4 the gas lies in a flat disk whose centre is coincident with the centre of the non - stellar continuum . we were then able to determine the position angle and radius of the disk ( see figure [ sec : obs ] ) . the 2d image of the disk was obtained via the co2 - 2 ##s bandhead , and that of the gas via the 1 - 0s ( 1 ) emission line . these independently yielded similar parameters : both gave the position angle of @ xmath174 and their values were 42 @ xmath175 and 43 @ xmath175 respectively . these are all consistent with values found by other methods ( @ xcite ) . the resulting datacurves and velocity fields are shown in fig . [ fig : n1097 _ dispvel ] . the curves , which can be interpreted as the velocity field of the gas but not the stars , and their relation to the spiral structure described above will be discussed elsewhere ( davies et al . , prep ) . the important result here is that at our maximum resolution , we find that the central gas mass is @ xmath176kms @ xmath6 , less than the ~ 150kms @ xmath6 and much less than that of the stellar surface spectra of @ xcite . in the central gas we find that the rotation rate of the gas appears to decrease rapidly , and the mass increases from @ xmath177kms @ xmath6 to @ xmath178kms @ xmath6 . [ fig : n1097 _ dispvel ] also shows that although the kinematics of the stars and gas are very different at the ( @ xmath179 ) scales , they are remarkably similar at the @ xmath180 . this also gives a good indication that in the nuclear system the stars and gas are coupled ,most occur in a ( roughly circular ) disk ; and that the stars in this disk , which are massive and therefore relatively young , give rise to the oldest stellar populations observed . evidence for a transient starburst has been provided by @ xcite through optical and infrared spectra . they argued that the pattern of features they observed could only arise from an @ xmath181m @ xmath1 instantaneous starburst , which occurred a few myr ago and was reddened by @ xmath182mag of extinction . using stars we have interpreted this starburst as an @ xmath181m @ xmath1 event at 8myr , with an estimated orbital timescale of 1myr . the model we have used is a little older to calculate the br @ xmath7 equivalent width constant ; and for this age , the model predicts @ xmath159 . as fig . [ fig : n1097 _ 1 ] shows , the model br @ xmath7 is unstable , although still slightly resolved . as for the inter - band continuum , we measure br @ xmath183 . however , the r ##s may account for a significant fraction of the x - band stellar continuum. correcting us for this could increase @ xmath57 to 1 , consistent with that of the model assuming that the br @ xmath7 is associated with the starburst rather than the agn . to add a factor of a few , the size of the observed starburst is also consistent with that assumption : in the central 0 . 5 we found a br @ xmath7 flux of @ xmath184wm @ xmath2 , compared to that predicted by the flux of @ xmath185wm @ xmath2 . given the large factors of a model both in the size of the starburst , and also in the corrections we have made to the data , we consider this a good agreement . we can not estimate the starburst further due to its size . @ xcite found that it was concentrated in the central 0 . 5 , whereas our estimate is only 0 . 25 . the br @ xmath7 flux is concentrated to the central 0 . 2 . 5 , although its intensity is hard to estimate due to its size with respect to the stellar morphological properties . in this region the x - ray emission flux of @ xmath186l @xmath1 . to calculate the dynamical parameters we use the thermal kinematics of the stars and galaxies , i . e . , @ xmath187kms @ xmath6 ( adjusted for temperature ) and @ xmath188kms @ xmath6 ( this is the central region , which is least populated by young stars ) , yielding @ xmath189m @ xmath1 this is actually measured by the black hole , which has a mass of @ xmath190m @ xmath1 @ xcite . the difference between these is a mass of , and radius of @ xmath191m @ xmath1 , although with a large radius . the lowest mass - to - radius ratio is @ xmath192 . on its own , this means that over the very large region that it encompasses , the most characteristic time for the star formation is a few billion myr . if one assumes that star formation has been occurring continuously for this timescale , then the starburst measured by @ xcite is the most recent active event . in order to get a rough estimate of the activity rate in the central region we make use of measurements .by @ xcite . they have an average component ( size @ xmath193 ) with 5ghz of mass @ xmath194mjy , but at this mass there is an @ xmath195mjy component of size 1 . as shown in the [ fig : diag ] we assume that the high albeit with only the mass of @ xmath196mjy is due to star formation in the core region , which implies a # ##tion of @ xmath197yr @ xmath6 and hence @ xmath198 , a value consistent with a more recent star formation . indeed , when compared to vs . [ fig : cd ] , this and the low @ xmath57 suggest a young star and a new formation timescale . for @ xmath68myr the age is 6070myr ; for an initial burst of star formation , the age would be @ xmath80myr , again consistent with that of @ xcite . thus , although our observations do not directly constrain the age of the starburst in the nucleus of ngc1097 , they do suggest that recent star formation has occurred ; and theyis consistent with a relatively young compact starburst similar to that derived from visible and uv observations . evidence for a galactic core in ngc1068 with an angular length estimate of @ xmath199pc was also obtained from @ xcite . based on data collected in 24 ( 24 ) stars , they assumed the core was virialized and estimated the mass - to - light ratio based on this assumption leading to an upper limit on the estimated age of 1600myr . making a slight correction for the relatively young component lead to a calculated age of 500myr . the data from stellar integral field spectra @ xcite show evidence for a drop in the radial velocity dispersion of the central few stars to @ xmath200kms @ xmath6 , suggesting a region of higher 150200kms @ xmath6 ##pc ( presumably the bulge ) . our near infrared adaptive optics data are able to precisely determine the inner region where @ xmath60 drops , as shown in fig . [ fig : n1068 _ 2 ] . as for ngc1097 , the mass distribution of the stars was determined from kinemetry , by making use of the uniformity of the stellar integral fieldto justify the simplifying is that the position angle and coordinates do not change significantly in the central 4 . the derived coordinates of @ xmath201 and position angle of @ xmath202 are very similar to those found by other authors in the central 4 to tens of kilometers @ xcite . the structure of the stellar continuum is in contrast to molecular gas molecules , as traced via the h - f ( 1 ) lines , which are highly complex and show several different structures simultaneously . these are too complex to permit a very accurate analysis and will be discussed , together with the changes in the stellar continuum in a later work ( mueller snchez et al . in 2008 ) . the main result given here is that with our x - ray resolution of 0 . 5 we see that @ xmath60 reduces from 130kms @ xmath6 / cm to only 70kms @ xmath6 in the galactic region . that it is in the same way an increase in the stellar continuum is explained in detail . [ fig : n1068 _ x _ wide ] . here we see the spectral properties of the stellar continuum from both sinfoniintegral field spectra out to a factor of 2 and naco longslit spectra out to about ( 350pc ) . at radius 15 , corresponding roughly to the region of high stellar density measured by @ xcite , the profile is best described by the @ xmath55 scale , as one might expect for a disk . at about @ xmath203 the same radius at which we expect to see a discernable increase in the stellar density the stellar radius increases by as much as a factor 2 with the inward bulge of the profile , indicating that there is excess emission . as for ngc1097 , the stellar signature of both cool gas and excess emission is strong evidence for a debris disk which has experienced intense star formation . we can make an estimate of the total mass of the star formation in the central arcsec based on the mass - to - radius ratio in a similar way to @ xcite . because the stars appear to be in a disk , we estimate the total mass as shown in the [ sec : diag ] from the stellar profile , calculating the rotation velocity and applying a formula for the dispersion . the stellar rotation velocity becomes perfectly flat at 0 . 10 .similarly , with @ xmath204kms @ xmath6 ( corrected for distance ) . we then find @ xmath205kms @ xmath6 , which is the central value and the value affected by the radial velocity of light . these lead to a mass of @ xmath206m @ xmath1 ##pc @ xmath207 ( 35pc ) , and a mean mass density of @ xmath208m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 . as for the non - rotating continuum , the x - ray emission ( which the mass of @ xmath60 ##m is caused by the stellar emission ) in the central region is 0 . 53mag . for @ xmath26mag ( fig . [ fig : stars ] ) , we find @ xmath209l @ xmath1 and then @ xmath210m @ xmath1 / l @ xmath1 . if the star formation is on - line , this gives a mean density of 200300myr , independent of the timescale ( for @ xmath211myr , see fig . [ fig : stars ] )on which stars are based . we note that this is much lower than the age estimated by @ xcite , because their mass was calculated using the map @ xmath60 corresponding to the # ##s . the presence of no current star formation is clearly demonstrated by the br @ xmath7 map in bold . [ 1 : n1068 _ maps ] . away from the boundaries of br @ xmath7 , which are associated with the emission lines and the jet rather than continuous star formation , the closest map is @ xmath212 . this is significantly less than that for continuous star formation of this type . thus , while it seems likely that star formation has occurred within the last few million myr , it also seems an unavoidable conclusion that there is no current star formation . to complete our set of maps for ngc1068 , we consider also the galactic disk . this is largely dominated by features associated with the agn and jet , and our best estimate of the stellar age away from these features is given by the lowest values of maps such as figure 1 of @ xcite . from this we estimate an upper limit to the 5ghz continuum , with star formation of 128mjy within @ xmath17##3 . however , converting to a lower limit and then to the k - band stellar spectra gives a limit that is not absolute , being an order of magnitude above the lowest expected values . at near infrared wavelengths , the agn in ngc3783 is remarkably bright . integrated into the factor 0 . 5 less than 1 % of the k - band spectrum is visible . in addition , the ubiquitous brackett lines are very strong and dominate the h - band . both of these features are quite clear from the h - and k - band spectra in fig . [ fig : n3783 _ 2 ] . however , it does appear that the spectral resolution cannot be measured directly from both the non - stellar spectra and the stellar emission lines ( see also [ fig : 2 ] ) . we find the k - band psf to be symmetrical with a fwhm of 0 . 5 . due to the strong brackett lines in the k - band we are unable to accurately trace the stellar spectral lines and map out the stellar continuum . instead we have found the k - band bandhead of 2 . 5 even though the dilution at the nucleus itself is large . the azimuthally and rotational velocity is shown in fig . [ fig :n3783 _ rad ] , with the sun for reference . at distances from 0 . 21 . 5 ( the closest we could obtain ) the model is best described by an @ xmath55 ##5 vaucouleurs law with @ xmath213 ( 120pc ) . as has been the case previously , at smaller radii we find an excess that often is only partially resolved . thus a small portion of the near infrared stellar continuum in the bulge region is likely to originate in a group of stars distinct from the bulge . we were unable to use the stellar kinematics due to the poor signal - to - signal . instead , we used the stellar gas kinematics to determine the stellar mass . as such , we used kinemetry to derive the position coordinates of @ xmath214 and the mass in the range 3539 @ xmath175 . this result is consistent with the 20 ( 20 ) stellar isophotes in the x - band 2mass image and implies that in ngc3783 there is a stellar excess on average of 50pc to 4kpc . the orbital inclination is also consistent with the classification as a seyfert variable . adopting these values ,the resulting rotation curve is shown in fig . [ 1 : n3783 _ rot ] . at very large distances the resulting rotation curve may be the result of beam smearing in the spectrum . for @ xmath215 , the rotation spectrum suggests that the rotation is dominated by the higher ( @ xmath216 ) mass , of the supermassive black hole . we estimate the resulting mass within a range of 0 . 3 ( 60pc ) , close to the point where the rotation continuum begins and to where the rotation spectrum appears to be unaffected by beam scattering . from @ xmath217kms @ xmath6 and @ xmath218kms @ xmath6 we derive the dynamical mass of : @ xmath219m @ xmath1 . the black hole mass of @ xmath220m @ xmath1 ( from reverberation mapping , @ xcite ) is only 10 % of this , and it can not be predicted the rotation at this scale unless the mass is underestimated . with respect to this , we assume that @ xcite . the standard error for masses derived from reverberation mapping is about a factor 3 .alternatively , there may be a combined mass of gas and stars m @ xmath221 . however , including @ xmath53 in the mass estimation implicitly assumes that the mass arises from macroscopic processes . on the other hand , because we are observing only the hot h @ xmath49 , it is possible that the dispersion is caused by turbulence resulting from solar or cosmic radiation of materials that cause the 3 - d ( 1 ) scattering issues that were discussed in more detail by hicks et al . ( in ref . ) . in this case we may have neglected the mass parameters . excluding @ xmath53 from the mass estimation is @ xmath222m @ xmath1 . we use these two values as denoting the maximum number of possible masses . subtracting m @ xmath223 ##m gives a mass of stars and gas of the form ( 1 ) @ xmath224m @ xmath1 , implying a mass - ratio of 17006000m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 and @ xmath2252 . 1m @ xmath1 / m @ xmath1 . based on these ratios above , fig [fig : map ] indicates that the characteristic brightness of the open cluster could be as low as @ xmath226myr , although it could also be an order of magnitude greater . without additional data we could not discriminate it . we are going to use the @ xmath7 as an additional constraint on the star formation history . its distance and velocity measurements are similar to that of [ sivi ] , and are distant from the sun - 0s ( 1 ) . it shows an extension to the north which appears to be outflowing at @ xmath227kms @ xmath6 ( fig [ fig : n3783 _ maps ] ) perhaps forming an expanded region . since the galaxy @ xmath7 resembles the [ sivi ] , it is reasonable to assume that it too is associated with the agn rather than star formation . thus the large size of the @ xmath7 ( with respect to the stellar radius ) of @ xmath228 represents an upper limit to that associated with star formation . the radio emission from the nucleus of ngc3783 has been measured with two different sizes at 8 . 5ghz . for the beam of @ xmath229 , @ x##cite that this is unresolved with a flux density of @ xmath230mjy . with a single @ xmath164 star , @ xcite measured a total flux density of 8 . 0mjy dominated by an extended component of @ xmath231mjy . at smaller scales , of @ xmath232 corresponding to 6pc , @ xcite measured an upper limit on the 8 . 5ghz flux density of 7mjy . taken together , these results imply that there is some other 8 . 5ghz radio continuum of 0 . 71mjy extended on scales of 0 . 7 . based on this we have a large ratio as shown in section [ sec : diag ] of @ xmath233yr @ xmath6 , and therefore the true @ xmath234 . assuming that the unresolved radio continuum at the smallest scale has an upper limit , the extended component may be smaller and therefore the true @ xmath235 ratio may be greater than that given here . section [ sec : stars ] then shows a very strong limit of @ xmath96myr to the actual size of the star formation . this limit isfully consistent with that definition associated with our initial mass estimate . the definition of @ xmath236 ##m does not impose any limitations , although we note that if the flux @ xmath7 ##m associated with star formation is only a small fraction of the total flux it would appear that the timescale over which the star formation is active is no more than a few times @ xmath80myr . thus in the definition ( @ xmath221 ) of ngc3783 we define 5070myr as the mass of the nucleus , and @ xmath237m @ xmath1 as the total flux excluding the central supermassive black hole . knapen j . , 2004 , _ _ penetrating bars and clouds of cosmic dust : the cosmic tuning fork strikes a musical note _ , eds block e . , puerari s . , smith j . , groess j . , block e .
