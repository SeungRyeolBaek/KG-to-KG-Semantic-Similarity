it is generally accepted that most stars form in clusters or clusters , although the details of the star - formation process , especially the origin of their structural properties , remain a topic of ongoing research ( see , e . g . , the groups * * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? in particular , in recent years , a number of structural properties of the clusters have been uncovered that still lack an adequate theoretical understanding , such as : i ) the existence of a mass segregation in the clusters , with the most massive stars lying closest to the cluster - center @ xcite ; ii ) the distribution of protostellar dust , which appears to have a large distribution @ xcite ; iii ) the likely presence of an age distribution in clusters , with the youngest stars being located in the highest - density regions @ xcite ; iv ) the mass distribution of the ##ons in some cluster dark matter . numerical simulations have begun to offer some insight into these properties . @ xcite has shown , from a suite of simulations of non - equilibrium , decaying star systems , that the most massive stars form in situ at the cluster centers , rather than ` ` forming ' ' them through dynamical interactions within the cluster itself . however , they gave nophysical reasons as to why the most stable clusters should form there . more specifically , @ xcite has shown , by comparing multi - wavelength spectra of stellar clusters with numerical models , that clusters form from mergers of ` ` subcluster ' ' structures , although again no explanation of why such mergers should occur is given . observationally , the existence of subunits of very large sizes in the clusters has also been pointed out by @ xcite . a theoretical model capable of providing a unifying explanation to these observations is that of massive , hierarchical molecular cloud collapse , from 2007 . the latter paper suggests that , if molecular clouds ( mcs ) are assembled by large - scale colliding streams of hot , atomic gas that rapidly condenses into the cold gas phase , then they quickly become super - ##sonic and begin to collapse rapidly . furthermore , the turbulence generated by the collapse of the streams causes moderately supersonic turbulence ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) in the surrounding gas , which produces a multi - dimensional spectrum of density fluctuations , where small - scale , large - amplitude ( ssla ) density fluctuations are dependent on larger - scale , medium - amplitude ( lssa ) fluctuations . since these density fluctuations are global , thedenser ssla fluctuations have shorter free - fall times than the lssa ones , thus starting their collapse earlier . this process is very similar to @ xcite fragmentation , except that the density fluctuations are of random nature and therefore diffuse . in this sense , the process is very similar to the process of ` ` gravo - turbulent fragmentation ' ' , except that the cloud is _ ' _ _ compressed by gravity , and the density fluctuations do not collapse directly , but rather they are the trigger for rapid , local , scattered collapse as the cloud contracts globally @ xcite . in what follows , we will refer to this intermediate scenario between chaotic and gravoturbulent fragmentation as ` ` global hierarchical collapse ' ' ( ghc ) . this scenario also assumes that the star formation rate ( sfr ) of clouds evolves ( very slowly ) over time , as a result of the increase of the relative density of the clouds as they evolve towards global hierarchical collapse @ xcite . assuming that massive stars do not form until the sfr is high enough that the imf is sampled due to their masses , then massive stars form early in the fragmentation process , and when they do , they begin to destroy their surrounding clouds through their feedcak ( [UNK] , or##ising ##lass , ( explosions ) , and the sfr effect . @ xcite performed a smoothed - space dynamics ( sph ) based simulation of cloud formation and fragmentation in the simulation of ghc that showed the existence of filamentary clouds with dense cores . in that simulation , the filaments constitute river - like channels , in which material flows from the extended cloud cores to the dense cores where cloud formation occurs . when the clouds become very dense , fragmentation occurs in them as the material flows along them into the most massive cores . this means that the clouds supply the dense cores with a lot of matter and gas . this type of fragmentation was also observed ( although it was not observed ) in a similar simulation ( also using the adaptive dynamics refinement code of @ xcite that provided a simplified treatment of radiative processes and a way to model the clusters ) . ] ( sps ) that allows for a power - law sp ##h function with a slope similar to that of @ xcite . this means that , contrary to the situation in the simulation of @ xcite , the clouds formed in the simulation of paper i , as well as their surrounding structures , are subject to realistic dynamics , which allows for the evolutionof the time from their formation to the time when they encounter their surrounding stars . there exist several different models of cluster formation , focusing on factors such as their stellar distribution function , the correlation function of the observed stellar distribution and cluster size , and the formation of clusters ; the effect of feedback on forming new clusters and on forming their parent clusters ; and the energy balance and rotation of the cluster as a result of the initial turbulence level of the parent cluster @ xcite . in this paper , instead , we attempt to describe the process of assembly and the evolution of the clusters as a consequence of ghc . to this end , we study a cluster formed in the simulation labeled laf1 , paper 1 , focusing on the initial spatial evolution of the cluster . in sec . [ sec : model ] we first describe the numerical simulation , and in sec . [ sec : data ] we describe the criteria for organizing the cluster and stellar groups , both in terms of the time of their formation as well as from their spatial evolution . finally , in sec . [ sec : results ] we present our findings concerning the assembly from subunits brought in by the ghc , as well as the internal structure of the cluster . in sec . [ sec : data ] we discuss thethink of our results and compare them with previous observations , and in sec . [ sec : conclusions ] we have a summary and further conclusions . the numerical model used in this work is from the set provided in paper i with the hydrodynamics + n - body - decision tree ( art ) code of @ xcite . the physical models included are zero - gravity , parameterized heating and cooling ( sec . [ sec : hcrates ] ) , bubble formation with an unknown but realistic imf ( sec . [ sec : sf ] ) , and simulated radiative cooling for the environment from neutron - star ionising radiation ( sec . [ sec : ir ] ) . magnetic fields are included . for more details , we refer the work to paper i . the simulation involves the head - on collision of two cylindrical streams in the deep water ocean . the streams each have a diameter of 100 pc and a depth 112 pc , and each is moving at a speed of @ xmath0 . the numerical model ( including the data ) therefore has a uniform density @ xmath1 and temperature @ xmath2 respectively , and an initial sound speed of @ xmath3 . thus , the streams move with a mach number of 0 . 8 withrespect to the propagation speed of the initial uniform acoustic medium . the simulation uses a base resolution of @ xmath4 grid cells , and allows for higher resolution levels , reaching a base resolution equal to @ xmath5 , with a minimum cell size of 0 . 0625 pc , and @ xmath6 13 000 au . the simulation is based on the ` ` constant mass ' ' criterion , so that the cell s is refined when the mass is @ xmath7 . this implies that the minimum cell size @ xmath8 matches with both @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 . once the maximum refinement level is reached , no further differentiation is performed , and the cell s mass can reach even higher , because of the probabilistic sf scheme ( sec . [ sec : sf ] ) . note that this ` - constant - mass refinement criterion does not apply to the so - called _ jeans criterion _ @ xcite of matching the sf criterion with at least 4 grid cells . those involved note that attempting to do this would result in spurious , numerical fragmentation . however , we do not consider this a cause for concern since , it will be described in sec . [ sec: sf ] , our star formation model allows us to calculate the per - particle mass distribution , and convert it to a @ xcite model . we consider heating ( @ xmath11 ) and cooling ( @ xmath12 ) functions of the gas @ xmath13 these functions are fits to the standard heating and cooling functions used by @ xcite , as described in equation ( 1 ) of @ xcite , with the detailed description given in @ xcite . with these heating and cooling functions , the gas is thermally stable in the density range @ xmath14 . no chemistry explanation is required , and instead the gas is assumed to be nearly atomic , with a mean particle density @ xmath15 . our model uses a standard star formation prescription such that , if the parent cell reaches a maximum density @ xmath16 , where is the value of , then an sp of minimum mass @ xmath17 may be placed in the cell with the probability @ xmath18 the timestep of the root ( initial ) grid . if the sp is created , it contains most of the total mass of the parent cell . unlike standard charged particles ( e . g . , * ? ? ? *; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , our sps do not accrete . however , since our prescription for sf is correct , when the highest refinement level is reached in the system , it then continues to accrete from the surrounding material , and grows in size and density until an sp is actually formed from it . this implies that the formation is done in the gas phase , rather than onto the surface . serendipitously , it was found in paper ii that this process caused the sps to form with a power - law mass distribution , whose slope can be tuned by varying the value of @ xmath18 , at a given time resolution . in paper i it was found that setting @ xmath19 to the highest level in our system caused the sp power - law mass distribution to reach an value of @ xmath20 , thus being similar to the original salpeter distribution . we set the minimum level for sp formation at @ xmath21 , which corresponds to the sp mass of @ xmath22 at the time resolution level . thus , the highest possible sp mass is @ xmath23 . with this prescription, the most likely sp ##s in this simulation has @ xmath24 . note , however , that our imposed limit is a strict power law , and that the most probable stellar mass is also the limit . this means that we are on the minimum - mass ( @ xmath25 ) side of the actual imf , implying that we are missing about half of the total number of stars , and that their corresponding mass ( 2030 % of the total number ) is deposited back into the stars that were not formed in the simulation . we discuss the implications of this in sec . [ sec : limits ] . our simulation thus assumes sps that represent individual stars ( in clusters or groups ) , with a uniform probability distribution of the most probable stellar mass . this allows the behavior of the sps to be reasonably representative of the forming stellar population , compared to the case when the stellar masses correspond to those of small groups , of up to a few hudreds of solar mass . in that case , low - mass particles can suffer exceedingly strong encounters with the massive particles , and thus reach extremely high velocities . in our simulation , the net effect of the individual stars on the system is non - linear , and the simplified radiativeit functions to model the formation and evolution of a hii region around an sp . as a first - order approximation , we compute the ` ` ` line - of - sight ' ' ( los ) characteristic density @ xmath26 in the hii region , with a value equal to the dot product of the temperature of the cell containing the sp and that of the target cell . moreover , for each target cell we have an average density @ xmath27 calculated from the experimental data provided by @ xcite . we then compute the corresponding strmgrem flux , @ xmath28 , given by @ xmath29 where @ xmath30 @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 is the standard cooling rate . at each time step , we search for target cells containing the sp , whose distances to us are smaller than @ xmath28 . for each target cell that meets this condition , we set its temperature to @ xmath33 and turn off the cooling mechanism . the system will do so during the entire lifetime of the sp , which is determined by the parameters @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 as shown in figure 1 , for stars more massive than @ xmat##h36 , this time is a reference to the observed behavior of @ xcite , while for stars with masses lower than that , it represents the fact that the duration of the stellar - wind period is @ xmath37 myr , roughly independently of mass . this also means that we are measuring the effect of the winds and winds of low mass stars by an empirical prescription . since this is probably only an approximation , we do not expect it to have much impact on our understanding , since the main source of feedback energy at the level of gmcs is the ionization energy from the stars @ xcite . although somewhat simplified , this model was tested in phase 2 against the known analytic parameters for the behavior of @ xmath38 in the uniform medium @ xcite and found to be within 30 % . this , we conclude , is accurate enough for our interest in large - scale molecular cloud formation and the associated molecular clouds at early stages of formation , rather than in the physical details of the surrounding regions . a crucial issue for the present study is the membership of stars to a particular group or cluster . we will begin our procedure of identification . observationally , the identification and membership process of embedded open clusters is quite a complex process , complicated by am##biguities and uncertainties , since the clusters do not have well defined edges , formation of individual stars is difficult to quantify , and individual stars may be difficult to identify . in our case , the location of the stars in the cluster is known , and this allows the classification of the stars by point of origin . however , this information is irrelevant to observations , which instead must begin by first identifying the cluster as a stellar surface density distribution , and then define its size mainly on a statistical basis , by comparison with star counts from nearby control fields off the cluster @ xcite . on the other hand , in the simulations there are no ` ` field ' ' stars , but only stars from clusters formed at several other points in the cluster . for the purpose of defining a cluster or group by stars at early times , we use the well known friends - of - friends ( fof ) method @ xcite . this is convenient at early times , when the individual groups of stars are well defined and the stars are easy to tag as members of a group that were formed at a particular time and location . however , note that , because of the complex structure of the cluster , and [ [ : results ] . ] the mass and energy content of the individual groups depends on the number ofthe so - called ` ` linking parameter ' ' applies to the stars . this parameter is a measure of the distance out to which neighbors are seen . in earlier times , the distance between stars is only determined by observation , and the linking parameter can therefore be adjusted to match the visual classification . at later times , however , the groups increase their size through gravitational interactions between their members , and consequently , stars continue to form in the same region , or in its vicinity , making it necessary to precisely define the regions size in order to determine their distance to the group . we thus define the size of a group at a given time by performing an iterative process : 1 . taking only the stars that were part of the group in the initial period , we measure the distance from their center of mass to the most distant star . if this distance is less than twice the distance from the center to the second most distant star , we consider the distance to the most distant star as the radius of the group . next , we consider the most distant star as the ` ` runaway group ' ' and consider the radius of the group as the distance from the center to the second most distant star . next , we assign the runaway groups ( those formed in the period of time between the actual snaps##hot and the cool ##est ) to the group whose center of mass is closest to them . 3 . finally , including the new groups , we recompute the center of mass , size ( @ xmath39 ) , total mass ( @ xmath40 ) , and total number of stars ( @ xmath41 ) of the group . we then compute the age of the group , @ xmath42 , as the time period since the time when the group was first formed . next , the groups slowly approach each other ( as part of the large - scale simulation ) and then they merge . we assume that a new group has formed from the merger of two former groups when the distance between their centers of mass is smaller than the larger of the two groups . at that point , we consider that the former groups merge . in fact , we expect this process to operate at large scale in our simulation , with groups in general forming from mergers , and so on , in a hierarchical and self - organizing manner . in this simulation , four new groups form , three of which are sufficiently massive to filter out the dense dust around them on a timescale @ xmath43 myr since the formation of the first group ( from @xmath44 myr to @ xmath45 myr ( the end of the simulation ) . stars begin to appear at @ xmath46 myr , and the first hii regions appear at @ xmath47 myr . finally , at @ xmath48 myr , the hot gas has been ejected from a region of @ xmath49 located around the cluster . [ [ fig : sim _ imgs ] shows the stage of the simulation , from @ xmath50 myr into the evolution , in which two hii regions , surrounding the two most massive clusters , can be seen , while the filamentary structure of the cluster is not seen in general . the clusters themselves are formed along the main filamentary structures of the cluster , and contain @ xmath51 @ xmath52 . note also that the nucleus of the most massive cluster resembles the filamentary structure of its surrounding region , similar to , for example , the shape observed in the type ii stars . this similarity in shape is not limited to the filamentary shape , but also to the fact that the filament contains a large number of stars in one region . in a future paper we plan to useand the stucture and kinematics of these observed and known clusters . the key element of the ghc model is that the clusters are part of the large - scale gravitational collapse , releasing energy into the cores within them , as observed by @ xcite in a simple model of cluster formation and collapse . further , these models propose the collapse of stars within the clusters , so that _ small clusters , which are collapsing already , and sometimes forming stars already , are themselves collapsing onto large - scale clusters _ , similar to the ` ` radiation belt ' ' model observed by @ xcite for the jet stream in the central convection region . this is illustrated in fig . [ fig : imgs _ clus2 ] , which shows a series of snapshots of the second most distant cluster ( hereafter , ` ` cluster 2 ' ' , shown in the upper left corner of the image ) among those seen in fig . [ fig : sim _ imgs ] , from @ xmath53 myr to @ xmath54 myr . from @ xmath55 18 . 05 to 20 . 05 myr it can be seen that both clusters have formed in the same group . at @ xmath56 myr, this second group is seen to have been at a distance @ xmath57 pc from the first . by @ xmath58 myr , this second group is seen to have approached the first , being at a distance @ xmath59 pc from it , and to have merged with it by @ xmath60 myr . also , at this time , a new cluster is seen to begin forming in the # ##thest part of the filament , containing only one star at that time , although by @ xmath61 myr it now contains two stars ( not one ) . the timing of the merger is also worth noting . already by @ xmath58 myr , the section of the membrane connecting the two groups is seen to be partially disrupted , and some material is being ejected from the clump of the first group . next , accretion of the gas is seen to have replenished this section of the filament by @ xmath62 myr , although the other side of the filament is now seen to be in the process of dispersal . finally , by @ xmath54 myr , the group is seen to be in the process of dispersal on .evolution of the cluster . " [ source : imgs _ clus2b ] this shows the various stages of the formation of this cluster . by @ xmath63 myr the filament is seen to have been dispersed out to diameter @ xmath64 pc , and by @ xmath65 myr , a large hii cluster , of diameter @ xmath66 pc has formed , although the region on the left retains most of the gas , and a new structure has formed , an ` ` pillar ' ' that forms the base of the cluster . also , within this filamentary structure , yet another group is seen to have formed ( at the bottom right of the image ) . by @ xmath67 myr , most of the dense gas has been removed from the region , and the cluster is seen to consist of four groups , two of them completely devoid of gas ( ` ` naked ' ' ) and two of them still remaining in their respective regions . from the above image , it is clear that the clusters in this simulation are formed by means of a dynamic process , in which subunits formed at very different distances and then merge until they fall into a large - scale potential well , _ xthe central region with the stars and planets _ . in the following sections we discuss the details of this mechanism . the resulting evolution of group 2 is shown in fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] , which shows the projected positions of the stellar clusters on the @ xmath68 diagram at _ @ xmath69 , 20 . 44 , 22 . 44 , and 25 . 44 myr in the _ top left , top right , bottom left , and bottom right panels _ . in this model , clusters begin to form at @ xmath70 myr and fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] shows that they have merged into a cluster in such a way that at @ xmath69 myr we form two subgroups ( hereafter , groups 1 and 2 ; in the _ top left panel _ of fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] ) of what will later become a single , unified group ( groups 1 - 2 ) . we use colored circles to identify stars that belong to group 1 , and zoom in for stars belonging to group 2 . next , we color them according to their mass as shown in the figure and then divide their masses by the cluster size , with the symbols indicatinglarger masses . the green and red circles represent the group size increasing each year , just as seen in fig . [ fig : cluster ] , with the dashed circles representing the size closest to the most distant star , and the solid circles representing the distance to the second most distant star . in what follows , we define the distance to the second most distant star as the center of group 1 - 2 , because the first most distant star is ` ` ` far away ' ' from the center . here , we use larger symbols to represent more massive stars , and smaller symbols to represent lower - mass stars . thus , , at these early stages , we can see that _ the more massive and distant stars tend to be near the center of the group _ . from sec . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] it is clearly apparent that , at these early stages , the groups are undergoing expansion , and that star formation continues between them . by @ xmath71 myr , the groups have similar sizes , masses , and number of stars , and they have undergone a large enough expansion that their merger is imminent . the formerly ` ` most distant ' ' star of group 1 is now far away from the center of the group . by our calculations , the merger occurs at @xmath72 myr , forming the new group 1 - 2 . we have kept the circle and the symbols to indicate the original group membership of the stars in the new group . they now represent stars born in the new group 1 - 2 . however , this new group represents stars that were born in somewhat different times and places . for future reference , we continue to track the evolution of this and other , smaller groups appearing in a 10 - pc box called group 1 - 2 , and by @ xmath73 myr , we will see a number of groups with different ages , masses , and sizes ( _ bottom right panel _ of fig . [ fig : g _ evol ] ) . these groups lie almost in a straight line , because they formed from the filament of the main clump . eventually , as these groups merge and approach each other , they finally become part of what we refer to as the new group itself , as shown in the _ bottom right panel _ of fig . [ fig : imgs _ clus2b ] , although the groups are still quite separate at that time ( @ xmath74 myr ) . as mentioned in the introduction , the fundamental premise of the ghc scenario is that thesfr of star - forming clouds will increase in magnitude until the time when massive stars begin to form and to destroy their parent mc @ xcite . the [ fig : sfr _ evol ] shows the evolution of the sfr in groups 1 and 2 , as well as in the merged group 1 - 2 . unlike for group 2 , for whose parent mc the sfr is relatively large and then decreases , for groups 1 and 1 - 2 the rate of increasing sfr is slow . moreover , the sfr for the merged group 1 - 2 is much larger than the same value reached in group 1 before the merger , so the increase of the sfr only holds for the system of groups 1 and 2 respectively , before and after their merger . assuming that massive stars do not form in a region until the sfr is sufficiently large enough to sample the region up to 2000 km , the increase of the sfr means that the massive stars should tend to form early in the formation of star - forming clouds . this is illustrated in fig . [ fig : age - mass ] , which shows the mass of the stars _ vs . _ their age between @ xmath54 and @ xmath75 myr . at these times , it is clearly seen that thethese stars have the highest mass , and that , as the temperature increases , the distribution of their masses increases to higher values . this is best illustrated in fig . [ fig : low _ mass _ hist ] , which shows the cumulative mass distribution of groups 1 , 2 , and 1 - 3 at different times . it is seen from this picture that the relative abundance of these stars increases over time , especially after groups 1 and 2 have formed . the ghc mechanism implies that the star - forming site is constantly undergoing expansion while simultaneously it is evolving into large - scale potential ##s . however , since the small - scale regions are forming all on their own , this mechanism in turn implies that the larger regions are fed by gas and stars ( cf . [ sec : gas _ evol ] ) from the surrounding infalling material . also , the small - scale regions fall into the large - scale ones fed by filaments @ xcite . an important consequence of this ` ` mixed ' ' ( gas + stars ) infall is that the ensemble of stars constitutes a non - dissipative ` ` gas ' ' that conserves the kinetic energy of the infalling motions . thus , the stars formed _ before _ reaching the large - scale galactic center should have avelocity dispersion corresponding to their age indicates they were infalling to the center of the large - scale potential well . in turn , this indicates that these stars should be much greater distances from the center of the group or cluster that has undergone mergers than the ones formed _ in situ _ in this initial clump , where the gas from which they formed their velocity component has already been shocked and thus has absorbed much of the infall ##ing energy . the [ fig : reference _ table ] shows the age of the young particles as a function of their distance to the center of mass of cluster 1 , @ xmath76 myr . it is estimated that all of the oldest stars ( @ xmath77 , and in particular the stars with @ xmath78 myr ) , are located in the central 1 . 5 pc of the cluster . this is also consistent with the fact that the older stars are mostly clustered around core - like or filamentary star - forming regions . instead , at these distances ( @ xmath79 pc ) , there are no stars with @ xmath80 myr . these older stars are the ones that formed in clusters 1 and 2 , prior to their merging . thiscan also be seen in the _ _ left _ corner of fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] , which shows that the stars farther from the center of groups 1 - 4 are usually represented by triangles and squares ( i . e . , formed prior to the merger ) and in green and cyan colors , denoting ages between 1 and 2 myr , while the stars more near the center have ages @ xmath81 myr , as shown by their orange - red symbols . on the other hand , we can see in sec . [ fig : age _ mass ] that the remaining 2 . 5 % of the cluster only contains the young stars , and in particular , the oldest ones ( @ xmath82 2 . 5 myr ) . this means that some of the stars formed prior to the merger have already had @ xmath83 - body interactions with the older stars in the region , and thus have transferred their excess kinetic energy to other stars in the region . this is facilitated because these old stars have less mass , so that they are strongly affected by interactions with more young stars . however , as shown in fig . [ fig : sfr ] ( fig . [ fig : age - mass ] ) , the oldest stars inis near the peak of the mass , which in our case is near the maximum stellar mass ( sec . sec . [ sec : sf ] ) . however , as mentioned in sec . [ sec : intro ] and [ sec : sfr ] , another property of the ghc is that the sfr increases at each star - forming site until feedback begins to destroy the gas flowing onto it , at which point the sfr begins to collapse rapidly , and perhaps breaks down completely . using a semi - empirical model for the age of molecular clouds and their sfr , @ xcite shows that this acceleration of the sf at each star - forming site means that the age histogram of the site within a few myr of its destruction is characterized by a large tail of very young ( at @ xmath84 myr ) and a small tail of young ( up to 10 myr ) stars , corresponding to the age distribution of embedded clusters in the database at @ xcite . the [ sec : age _ hist ] shows the age histogram of the clusters in groups 1 and 2 at various times , and the clumps that embed them merge and fuse to form stars . at @ xmath85 myr ,the two clusters and their embedded groups are still separate , and a histogram for each group is shown . at @ xmath86 myr , the two clusters and their embedded groups have completely merged , and thus a single cluster is shown . it is seen that , at this time , the most young stars are those less than 1 myr old . neverthless , there are also a few stars up to about 1 myr old . this indicates an increase of sf during the time @ xmath87 myr of formation of cluster 2 . at later stages ( @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 myr ) , the number of young stars decreases , while the most young stars are those located at @ xmath90 myr . this indicates a decline of the sfr during this time due to the increase of gas production by the cluster . figure [ fig : mass _ 1 ] shows the spatial distribution of the charged particle masses at @ xmath54 myr . it can be seen that all but one of the stars with mass @ xmath91 , and all those with @ xmath92 are located at @ xmath93 , of the cluster centerof the cluster . only one star with @ xmath94 is located at @ xmath95 distance from the cluster _ center of mass . however , an analysis of the evolutionary tree formed by the satellite images of fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] shows that this is the runaway star formed in , and ejected from , group 1 before the merger . this star is represented by the red square symbol lying on the green solid circle in the _ top right _ panel [ @ xmath96 myr ] of fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] and on the red solid circle in the _ top left _ [ @ xmath97 myr ] panel . therefore , this star is just ` ` passing through ' ' the cluster . instead , the more massive stars in group 1 - 2 _ formed _ in situ _ , as indicated by the triangular shape of their symbols in fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] . similarly , the less massive stars are represented by symbols of green and cyan squares , and with triangular shapes , indicating that those stars are runaway ( @ xmath98 myr ) , and formed _ in situ _ in the original group 1 - 2 . therefore , we know that, except for the star that is ` ` passing through ' ' , the massive star that formed after the merger of groups 1 and 2 to form group 1 - 2 , despite being young and tightly packed near the group center . another aspect of the cluster evolution shown in fig . [ sec : age _ profile ] and [ fig : age _ profile ] is that the cluster expands as it evolves , increasing its radius from @ xmath99 pc at @ xmath54 myr to @ xmath100 pc at @ xmath101 myr . the reason for this is not entirely clear . it can be attributed in part to the fact that the older material is beginning to be expelled from the cluster , as can be seen in fig . [ fig : imgs _ clus2 ] and [ fig : imgs _ clus2b ] , and in part to the fact that the radial dispersion of the older stars , formed in the older ssla stars that have fallen into the lssa ##e , contributes to the large - scale potential well , beyond that of the current star - forming site ( fig . [ fig : age _ distr ] ) , for the cluster to expand to a size representative ofthis also reduces size . we now discuss the hierarchical contraction of the cluster itself , resulting from the process of ghc of its central cloud . the [ ref : hier _ clus ] shows the stars belonging to the cluster at time @ xmath74 myr , viewed as a whole , and then as shown by a circle - of - friends diagram using three different values of the ` ` linking parameter ' ' @ xmath102 , which determines how far stars are separated in order to identify each group . we see that , at a small value of the parameter ( @ xmath103 , _ top right _ panel ) , three different groups are identified ( all by the same values ) , and at larger values ( @ xmath104 and above , _ top left _ and _ bottom right _ panels ) , groups 9 and 4 are identified , each group being significantly more massive . we also see that , at the lowest value , @ xmath105 , the largest cluster of moderately massive stars is left out , which is then identified as a group at higher values . these results show that the structure of the cluster resulting from the slow , hierarchical contraction of the cloud , is inherently ` ` stable ' ' , independent of thethe basis of structures , is the structure of the parent cloud , which in turn is a consequence of the multi - phase , hierarchical structure . we can continue the discussion in the next section as follows . the basic assumption for understanding the physical properties of the clusters formed in the absence of ghc is that first made in @ xcite , namely that massive stars should form in clusters where the local sfr is high enough that the imf can be sampled to correspondingly determine stellar masses . thus , the most massive stars in high - sfr clusters should be those at the peak of the cluster . this is , of course , a purely probabilistic interpretation of the model , and it does not explain the physical processes necessary for the development of the cluster itself . however , it provides a framework for understanding the structure of the clusters . also , under the assumption that clusters of all sizes are stable , as determined by the ghc , at a given temperature ( and therefore , a given free - fall time ) , more massive clusters are likely to have higher sfrs , if the sfr is determined , to first order , by the ratio of the stellar mass to the free - fall time . our model mimics these hypotheses, according to the probabilistic scheme used for the formation of a stellar particle . the longer it takes for a star to form , the more massive it will be , since the cell in which it forms continues to accrete and becomes more massive , without further expansion , and then the star remains with half the mass of the cell . however , as shown in figure 1 of model i , the probability of being able to live very long time before forming a stellar particle is very low , and therefore the probability of formation of a very massive star is also very low . thus , our simulation is likely to actually only form massive stars when the initial sfr is very high , although there can be a few exceptions to this rule . finally , in the ghc model , the low - mass , small - scale , large - amplitude ( ssla ) star - forming sites should appear earlier in the evolution of the universe , because of their longer free - fall times , while the high - mass , larger - scale , large - amplitude ( lssa ) sites should appear later . moreover , the low - mass sites should be pushed into the path of the gravitational potential well of the high - mass ones . however , high - mass sites continue to appear at different times inthe nuclei that feed the young stars until the collapse are destroyed by the feedback . thus , the highest mass stars formed in the low - mass , infalling cluster . the clumps infall themselves , and thus should have higher mass , than the stars formed in the main , massive clump , which can have either low or high masses . the following factors affect a number of characteristics of the open cluster : 1 . the oldest stars tend to have low masses . however , the opposite is not necessarily true : low - mass stars in general can be either young or old . this relationship is shown in the _ age _ panel of fig . [ fig : age - mass ] , which shows the mass _ vs . _ the age of the stars in the cluster _ times @ xmath97 and 1 . 66 myr . the oldest stars have larger masses ( fig . [ fig : age - age ] , _ left _ side ) , and therefore , they may be found at larger distances from the local star - forming zone ( fig . [ fig : age _ profile ] ) . the most massive stars formed early ( a few myr ) in the history of the stellar population , when variousssla sites have merged to form the lssa cluster . this is shown in figure [ fig : age _ age _ hist ] , which shows the observed stellar mass distribution for stars 1 and 2 , independently and combined , at various times . as time progresses , the larger members of the population are seen to be younger . 1 . the sfr increases during the early stages of the stellar evolution , until the time when young stars begin to form . during this time , the sfr decreases , and the negative feedback from the young star begins to destroy the clump and its filamentary gas supply . this is seen in the evolution of the mass distribution , shown in fig . [ fig : age _ hist ] . the young stars constitute a population , since the sfr initially increases with time . however , with the exception of the ##ons that can partially or completely replace the local gas and its supplying gas , the sfr decreases again , and thus stars older than the age of the oldest massive stars should be considered massive as well , as also shown in fig . [ fig : age _ hist ] . note that these properties apply to stars of sizes of few parsecs and masses of at least a billion myr, and so it specifically does _ not _ refer to the local and global star production in a single clump , for which our simulation can not discern whether massive stars form first or last , or how long does it take to form a massive star . also , note that large star - forming regions may consist of multiple low - mass local star - forming sites , and contain no large - scale site yet . this situation applies to times where the multiple low - mass sites have not yet merged to form a more massive star . our numerical results are also consistent with our observational results on the age and velocity distributions of massive stellar objects in star - forming regions . in particular , @ xcite have recently reported the existence of observed gradients in the stellar ages of various massive star - forming regions , such that the youngest stellar objects are located in the outer regions of molecular clouds , intermediate - mass objects are found in revealed clusters , and the oldest objects are found in open clusters . this is qualitatively consistent with our observation that the oldest objects can be found at large distances from the cluster s center due to their relative velocity differences , in part due to their formation far from earth , so that their ages reflect the component from their origin##fall onto the galactic core region . however , the objects formed in the clump lack this component of the velocity , and these are formed by much smaller velocites . furthermore , the larger velocity dispersion of the young objects predicted by the ghc scenario has been confirmed by @ xcite in the orion molecular cloud . @ xcite proposed several possible scenarios that could lead to the age that they estimate . of these , the one closest to the mechanism of hierarchical collapse by ghc is their scenario b , since it invokes the concept of sf ##r proposed by @ xcite , which is consistent with our model @ xcite . however , the similarity between ghc and scenario b of @ xcite is not significant , since they do not consider the accretion of new stars and matter onto the trough of the large - scale potential region . in addition , @ xcite have concluded that the cloud complex known as the m17 southwest extension ( m17 swex ) appears to be lacking very massive stars in comparison with the age estimated from the estimated sfr . this region consists of two large star - forming cores , separated by distances of several kilometers from each other ( m . povich , principal investigator ; see also busquet et al . thisis consistent with the initial assembly of the clusters in our simulation , since these small , intermediate - mass star - forming clumps may have a very numerous combined population of ysos that may however not yet have very massive stars , because in the ghc scenario this only occurs after these smaller clusters have merged to form a massive one . this is also shown by sec . [ sec : low _ mass _ hist ] , which shows that the relative abundance of massive stars increases over time , especially after groups 1 and 2 have merged . we conclude that the scenario of ghc provides an assembly model for clusters that naturally exceed the observed mass limit and super - heavy mass of the clusters . in our future contribution we plan to carry out a detailed statistical comparison between the clusters ' populations that sample the clusters to lower levels ( see sec . [ sec : limits ] ) and the physical properties of specific clusters . the current study is based on the underlying hypothesis that our own stellar population selection scheme is the mechanism leading to the formation of the imf . that is , we model the assembly process as a random sampling process , and that the abundance of massive stars is interpreted to imply that the probability of forming clusters is very low and determined precisely by the. . however , the fact that our simulation , using a probabilistic model for the formation of stellar particles ( cf . sec . [ sec : sf ] ) , also models several observed types of young stars , implies that our underlying assumption is quite realistic . nevertheless , our cluster ##ing model does have some limitations . most importantly , as described in cf . [ sec : sf ] , the minimmum stellar - particle mass is @ xmath106 , which is below the value of the observed stellar mass , and thus we are missing stars on the low - mass side of the imf . our simulation model is using a strict power law , that lacks the instability of low mass . this implies that we are missing a large number of low - mass stars , about half of the observed number of stars . their mass , @ xmath107 of the observed mass for a @ xcite ##s , and @ xmath108 for a @ xcite ##s , is then transformed into the clusters that do form in the simulation , with from @ xmath106 to @ xmath109 . this does affect the size of the clusters formed in the simulation , although not very much , sincethe young stars have low masses , and are not expected to influence the dynamics of the higher - mass ones very much , even if the tend to form a roughly homogeneous background . the fact that the structure of our clusters resembles that of these young stars reinforces this expectation . we nevertheless need to modify our cluster assembly scheme in order to produce a more complete single - particle mass model , and with this carry out a more detailed and accurate comparison with observations . furthermore , we consider that our study is an illustrative mathematical approximation to the process of cluster assembly , including the essential question of the proper assembly of these objects . other limitations of our model are that it does not include magnetic fields nor any form of feedback other than ionisation ##s , in particular supernova ( mc ) explosions . the neglect of magnetic fields may not be crucial , since our present understanding is that stars are generally not unstable , meaning that the magnetic field is in fact sufficient to support them against their own anti - gravity , and therefore they are unimpeded to their collapse . the neglect of sn explosions is probably not crucial because of two main reasons . first , it is becoming increasingly clear that sn explosions need to occur within the clouds in order to produce large amounts of massfrom the cloud @ xcite , although on the other hand , the sne that form in low - temperature regions have energy levels that allow their coupling with the gas @ xcite . also , pre - sn feedback is required to allow blastwaves to flow efficiently into the cloud @ xcite . second , and more importantly , our model assumes that the assembly of the clouds is accomplished mostly during the early stages ( first 10 myr ) of the stellar evoloution , during which little or no sne are expected to occur , even if the stars form late in the formation of the clouds , as suggested by the ghc scenario . so , the microwave radiation used in our model is probably the most relevant form of feedback for regulating the gas flow onto the sites where the massive stars are forming . first , our theoretical prescription ( sec . [ 1 : 1 ] ) is of very simplicity , fitting the radiative transfer equation in an approximate manner . although it was shown in phase i that the evolution of an hii region with this prescription does fit the uniform - mean density equation very well , it is clear that our model allows simulations of regions that should be shaded into dense clusters , since it does not take into account the densityof the intervening material between the source object and the object in which the effect of the radiation is being applied . thus , our simulations may somewhat reduce the evaporation rate of material in filaments containing dense clumps . however , since the columns themselves are thicker than the background material , and their density significantly exceeds that of isolated channels and columns , their column density for cases where the filament is aligned with the ionising object and with the background material ( as in the case of columns feeding the main channel where the ionising object formed ) will be comparable to or even greater than that of the surrounding clump . therefore , the shadowing caused by this clump is likely to be of secondary importance . indeed , figure 10 in paper i shows the gradual evaporation of material containing clumps in a way that causes the formation of ` ` pillars ' ' , and indeed , columns within growing hii columns , corresponding to structures like the ` ` tree of creation ' ' and giant trees , etc . on the other hand , our general design allows the simulation to run orders of magnitude faster than if the radiative effect were applied in practice . we thusconclude that our model provides a sufficiently rigorous model for the study of the assembly of galaxy clusters . in this paper , we have simulated the process of assembly of a cluster using a computer simulation of its formation and collapse by gas flows . the assembly occurs in a collapse regime as a consequence of the hierarchical nature of the collapse of the host cloud @ xcite . the cluster collapse regime consists of small - scale , large - amplitude ( ssla ) collapses ( involving small scale masses ) and large - scale , medium - amplitude ( lssa ) collapses ( involving large masses , which are spread out over large collapse regions ) . collapses at large scales involve collapse onto the surface of the cluster core ( the cluster ` ` centers ' ' ) . the large - scale collapses involve the generation of filamentary flows that funnel gas from the whole large - scale cluster back to the collapse region , and the small - scale collapse regions ` ` ride ' ' on these small - scale filamentary flows @ xcite , forming a ` ` conveyor belt ' ' system @ xcite . because the small - scale collapses start forming much earlier ( due to their smaller amplitudes , which imply shorter free - fall times ) , they can reach the large - scale collapsematerial - containing stars in addition to fresh material . this scenario then implies that massive star - forming sites form from the merging of small - scale star - forming regions , which supply both material and gas to the larger sites , and thus these larger - scale sites are a mixture of newly formed stars and stars that formed at a remote , smaller - scale site and that are brought to the larger - scale site by the infalling flow . thus , the stars that form in the small - scale , distant region have an infall velocity corresponding to the larger - scale potential well . similarly , stars formed in the massive center of the larger - scale site , formed from material that has probably been compressed upon their arrival there , and so they form with a much lower velocity now . finally , this scenario also implies that the sfr must increase with time during early stages of evolution , and then decrease again as the massive stars begin to leave their respective regions @ xcite . this acceleration of the sf process , combined with a p - value interpretation of the velocity as a probability distribution function of stellar evolution , implies that massive stars are only expected to form when the sfr is large enough to satisfy the flow to high precision . thus , massive stars should form last in the evolutionof the whole set of star - forming sites , once the low - mass ones have merged to form a high - mass , high - sfr one . from these observations , we have concluded that a star that has emerged from the initial collapse of its molecular cloud must have the following characteristics : * the oldest stars tend to have lower masses , because they form in the low - mass sites involved in the formation of the cluster . however , younger stars can be either low - or high mass , because they form in the high - mass sites created by the merger of the low - mass ones . * the oldest stars tend to have larger velocity components , because they are characterized by the infall velocity of the cluster onto the high - mass collapse center . however , this effect tends to be washed out by the gravitational interaction as the cluster ages . * as a consequence , older stars tend to be at greater distances from the collapse center ( see above ) . * the most massive stars tend to be younger , because they only form when the sfr of the collapse center has increased enough to reach the high - mass sites of the cluster . * as a consequence , the low - and high - mass sites that have already undergone the merger process may be defficientin the highest - mass stars . * because of the high sfr , most stars are young , although a small fraction may be as old as several myr . these features are in good qualitative agreement with the properties of older clusters , which seem to have a similar structure , have an age gradient , so that the young clusters tend to be farther from the forming sites @ xcite and to have larger masses @ xcite . however , the scenario suggests that ensembles of stars in different phases of formation may be defficient for massive stars due to the total mass form their combined stellar production , as observed by @ xcite . we believe that the presence of ghc provides a better understanding of the structure of young clusters , in terms of the multi - scale collapse of their parent clouds . r . v . - s . is glad to have continued working with robert povich on the observed structure of young clusters . * supported by uc - mexus data .
