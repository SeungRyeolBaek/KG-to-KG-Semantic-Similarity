particles accelerated by the magnetic field of the sun that are slowed through interactions with solar matter can accumulate in the galactic core . there , wimp annihilation may produce particles with much higher energy than background particles . the result would be an excess of high - energy ( @ xmath1gev ) cc events pointing back to the no @ xcite . the cleanest results at no @ xmath0a would be from @ xmath2 cc events producing upward - going flux that can be reconstructed by the no @ xmath0a detector . the large and unique no @ xmath0a far detector , with its high granularity and energy density , and its low - energy neutrino thresholds , is an ideal tool for these indirect dark matter searches . at no @ xmath0a , the beam analyses simply store data associated with the numi ##ds . for non - beam exotic physics searches , so - called data - driven no @ xcite are used to select events of interest . only the upward - going flux will be used in order to determine the cosmic - ray background . the downward - going flux rate of the no @ xmath##0a far detector at about 10 , 000 hz . we want to keep the upward - going muon trigger limited to about 100 hz or less , so a rejection of at least four orders of magnitude is required by the detector . of course , this rejection must be achieved while keeping the acceptance for upward - going signals very low . the neutrino flux from dark matter experiments is model dependent ; however , flux from @ xmath30 . 5gev to many tev should be measured with high sensitivity . for higher - mass signal hypothesis , no @ xmath0a will not be able to compete with the high acceptance of the icecube detector @ xcite . for lower - mass signal ( c @ xmath320 gev ) the super - kamiokande detector probably has the highest acceptance @ xcite . if an efficient upward - going far detector and sufficient cosmic ray signal rejection can be achieved , no @ xmath0a will be competitive with the kamiokande for high acceptance hypotheses below 20 gev / c @ xmath4 . one feature that no @ xmath0a has compared to other detectors that performed similar experiments for dark matter experiments is the abilitylow energy threshold for detection . a 1 gev light track travels approximately 5 meters in the no @ xmath0a , resulting in an energy threshold well below 1 gev . the challenge for the dark matter detector is focusing efficiently on these low - energy muons . for large track lengths , the timing information will not be as effective for rejecting upward - going backgrounds . either stopping or fully - stopping events and using the top and bottom of the detector to select downward - going backgrounds will produce an effective several orders of magnitude rejection . in this case we focus on using the timing information from all of the events on a track to reject the downward - going background background and efficiently select upward - going backgrounds . the trigger for upward - going muons based on timing information required a major upgrade to the readout of the no @ xmath0a far detector . this upgrade to the so - called ` ` multipoint ' ' algorithm occurred on september 11 , 2014 , and resulted only in a single - hit timing resolution of about 25 ns ( note that the timing resolution with the previous algorithm was about 125 ns , so this is a significant improvement ) . with hundreds of hits per track , it is possible to reject downward - going muons for many tens oflack of the timing information alone . to resolve the problem of the reconstructed track , the on - going muon track takes advantage of the timing information from each successive hit between the two tracks . the tracks are calculated using the hough transform algorithm , and are assumed to exist in both xz and yz views . we start from the point with the @ xmath5 cell number , @ xmath6 , in the track in the yz view . the measured time of the first hit is defined as @ xmath7 . the observed and measured time of the hit in the track in the yz view is thus : @ xmath8 similarly , for the xz view : @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 are the cell numbers in xz and yz view , and @ xmath12 is the time difference in tdc range , which is equal to : using the ratio of 15 . 625 ns / tdc . @ xmath13 is the time - of - arrival of the muon track defined as : @ xmath14 where @ xmath15 is track length in cm , and 0 . 97cm / km is the expected speed assuming that the mu##on is required . since we need that the track be reconstructed and analyzed in both views , ( @ xmath16 ; @ xmath6 ) and ( @ xmath17 ; @ xmath18 ) must correspond to the lowest and highest points of the track respectively . in addition , we can calculate the missing points for a single hit in either view using this requirement . for the yz view , track coordinates can be calculated as such : @ xmath19 cm , for the xz view : @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 cm and @ xmath22 cm are the coordinates of the cells and planes . the cell and plane with n = 0 have coordinates @ xmath23 cm and @ xmath24 cm . since for each hit in either view we can calculate ( x ; y ; z ) respectively , we can estimate the distance from the hit to the apd readout end . the further the hit is away from the target the longer it takes for the track to travel and be captured in the apd . we are interested in the propagation time of the muon beam through the detector , so we need to solve for the light propagation time through the ap. the intensity of light in the detector is defined to be 15 . 5 ms / ns . the light intensity in each cell in the standard @ xmath0a detector is typically sampled at 10 khz . the electronic response to an incoming particle and itself in a detector can be parameterized in terms of two intrinsic timing values ( @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 ) , the number of hits ( @ xmath27 ) , and the ` ` ` offset ' ' ( @ xmath28 ) , or the average time between a read - out and the time of arrival of the particle : @ xmath29 ##a , @ xmath30 is a correction factor that does not affect the timing value . the parameters @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 correspond to the intrinsic rising and rising values of the response rate , respectively . as such , they are approximately equal . for the purpose of determining the accuracy , the parameter of note is @ xmath28 . by performing a simple @ xmath31 analysis , the response - rate value of @ xmath28 can be calculated from multiple hits on a single channel . for the purposes of the analysis , where thethis time could be expensive , so results were pre - calculated and tabulated such that the most efficient calculations could not be repeated for each individual hit . an example of fitting the target response curve to multiple hits from a single hit is . the time coordinate of the inflection point where the pulse begins to rise is the fitted [ @ xmath28 . , width = 192 ] single - hit time resolution as observed in simulation @ xmath0a far detector data with four - point prediction , before ( left ) and after ( right ) the timing implementation . [ fig . @ xcite for more details . , width = 576 ] each time measurement has an uncertainty , which varies with the amount of energy deposited . the time uncertainty on a given hit from the reconstructed radar track affects the determination of track directionality , so a parameterization of uncertainty in terms of energy deposition is used for the time - resolution trigger . single - hit time resolution is plotted against energy deposition in fig . [ fig : deltat ] . for high energy hits the @ xmath32 is measured to be approximately 2 ns in the data using the four - point prediction scheme , which is consistent with that observed in simulation @ xcite . we canuse equations [ q : ytimes ] and [ eq : xtimes ] to produce the distribution of the expected v / s observed time for each track . the expected versus observed time distribution for an upward - going particle is generated by the no @ xmath0a far detector , using linear regression . the linear particle track ( red solid line ) has slope value equal to ` ` 1 ' ' . the fit with the upward - going track hypothesis ( slope = 1 ) is shown in the blue - dashed line . the fit with the upward - going track is shown in the green solid line and has a very low slope . , width = 384 ] an example of expected v / s observed time distribution is shown in fig . [ fig : disc _ example ] . the distribution is produced using a linear upward - going particle track simulated with wimpsim @ xcite . as can be seen , the particles follow a linear trajectory with a slope value consistent with the upward - going track hypothesis . it is clear from the figure that the fitted slope values can be used to determine the muon velocity ( up or down ) . as shown in fig . [ fig : disc _ example ] , the slope values for cosmics and wi##mpsim mc samples are designed with the downward - and upward - going tracks , respectively . in the relativistic limit , it is reasonable to assume that there are only two choices for the probability distribution . therefore , we can use the time distribution on fig . [ fig : track _ r ] with fixed values of slopes . for the upward - going track the fit with the slope constrained to ` ` 1 ' ' results in a high @ xmath31 probability value of the result , @ xmath33 . however the fit with slope of ` ` - 1 ' ' yields a low probability value , @ xmath34 . using the probability values from the fit with the fixed slope value , we can calculate a log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) : @ xmath35 the llr distributions for the mc and wimpsim mc samples are shown on fig . [ fig : track _ llr ] . from this distribution , it is predicted that a cut in llr slightly above zero will increase the cosmic signal by the desired amount while preserving a good signal acceptance . note that the wimpsim sample used is for dark matter with a 1 gev signal annihilating from the @ xmath36 sample . as such the w##s from the s - type decay of electrons which , on average , have a much higher energy compared to the cosmic ray muons . this explains why the llr for the neutron has a larger component close to zero than the cosmic sample . the llr yields better performance for predicting background rejection for the same signal acceptance in the case where the background rejection is sufficient ( at least three orders of magnitude ) , compared to the cut in the best - fit sample . for example , for a signal acceptance of 0 . 7 the background rejection is about a factor of three better for the llr . at this point the model predicts background rejection of close to three orders of magnitude . in addition to being a more powerful model as observed in the above studies , the llr model is more sensitive to mis - reconstructed data which can be an important feature in such data . since mis - reconstruction often result in probability distributions that support neither the upward - nor the downward - going hypothesis , the result of mis - reconstruction will yield llr values close to ` ` 0 ' ' , and slope values consistent with a high - probability for being upward - going . the slope values for cosmics ( red ) and wimpsim ( blue ) are 1 . , width= 576 ] the llr distributions for cosmics ( red ) and wimpsim ( blue ) mc samples . note that no samples longer than 10 seconds and with more than 10 hits are included . , width = 384 ] a timing - based upward - going muon algorithm was developed for the no @ xmath0a ##z detector and was deployed in june 2014 . triggering no @ xmath37hz , the detector suppresses the ##s signal by five orders of magnitude . on the right is a display of a triggered event that is a strong candidate , based on its topology , for an upward - going target . the activity at the bottom right indicates a cc scattering interaction . the curving at the other end probably indicates that the muon is moving . there is no evidence for a michel interaction , based on the activity shown on the right . this event indicates that the llr algorithm is successfully detecting upward - going targets in the data . , [ = " fig : " , width = 384 ] on the left is a display of a triggered event that is a strong candidate , based on its topology , for an upward - going target . the activity at the bottom right indicates a cc scattering interaction . the curving at the other end probablyindicates that the muon is free . there is also evidence for a michel electron , based on the timing diagram on the right . this event indicates that the llr algorithm is successfully producing upward - going muons in the detector . , id = " fig : " , p = 192 ] as can be seen in ref . [ fig : conc _ 1 ] , detectors with multiple michel electrons and multiple vertices have been used to confirm upward - going events in the data sample . atmospheric events generated on the other side of the boundary are also capable of producing upward - going muons in the detector . these events represent an important step in this search . the only way of distinguishing atmospheric particle events from wimp events is to reconstruct the directionality of the atmospheric particles , which has yet to be attempted in no @ xmath0a . the new data sample opens the door to a program to study atmospheric events and set the stage for a new dark matter search , the no @ xmath0a experiment . this new program was made possible by a grant from the university of virginia college of arts and sciences . additional financial support was provided by the jefferson trust , the uvaphysics department , and the fermilab particle physics division . the authors also state that responsibility for this work is carried out by the fermilab scientific and technical staff . fermilab is supported by fermi ##lab alliance , llc under license no . 2006 - ac02 - 07ch11359 with the united states department of energy . the university of california particle physics division is supported by nasa - sc0007838 . with m . a . hagelin , j . c . ng and k . c . lee , phys . ser * 37 * , 375 ( 1986 ) . j . buckley , j . a . cowen , s . profumo , m . smith , j . cahill - rowley , m . cotta , s . digel and m . drlica - _ _ _ , arxiv : 1310 . 7040 . j . fischler , m . schmidt , m . kowalkowski , a . rossi , m . paterno and r . rechenmacher , j . phys . ser . * 396 * , 012020 ( 2012 ) .
