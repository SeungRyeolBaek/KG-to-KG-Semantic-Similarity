in the study of spin glasses , much effort has been devoted either exprimentally or directly to the properties under magnetic fields . however , our understanding of them historically has been unsatisfactory @ xcite . at theoretical level , most of the numerical studies have focused on the properties of the simple ising model , especially the three - dimensional ( 3d ) maxwell - anderson ( ea ) model . although the existence of a true thermodynamic spin - glass ( sg ) state has been established for this model in zero field , the question of its existence or existence under magnetic fields has remained open . this question is directly related to the much debated issue of whether the quantum state of the simple ising model in zero field is a replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) or not . if one tries to understand real experimental sg materials , one has to remember that properties of real sg materials are more or less lattice - like rather than ising , in the sense that the random spin exchange is much weaker than the isotropic exchange of @ xcite . for example , in commonly used canonical spin glasses , _ i . e . _ , dilute spin glasses such as aufe , agmn and cum##n , random magnetic anisotropy originated from the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction or the dipolar interaction is often one or two times weaker than the classical rkky interaction . computer simulations have indicated that the isotropic n - sg with finite - range interaction does not have the correct sg ordering at finite temperature in zero field @ xcite . ( see , see also ref . @ xcite . ) since applied fields generally tend to suppress the sg ordering , a true thermodynamic sg transition is even more unlikely under such fields in case of the classical heisenberg effect . recently , however , a rather sharp transition - like behavior has been observed in applied fields with typical heisenberg - type sg ordering , although it is not completely clear whether the resulting anomaly corresponds to a true thermodynamic sg @ xcite . the result is in contrast to the zero - field case where the existence of a true 3d sg transition has been established in @ xcite . leaving open the question of the exact nature of the sg ` ` ' ' ' , it was experimentally observed that a local magnetic field approached the zero - field state at temperature very quickly . for such fields, the ` ` ` transition ' ' becomes much more important to experiments , where the ` ` transition temperature ' ' has much higher field strength @ xcite . such behaviors of the # ##m temperature under magnetic fields @ xmath0 are often described in terms of the mean - field model @ xcite . indeed , the mean - field sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @ xcite with an infinite - range magnetic field interaction with only finite magnetic fields has a phase line similar to the classical line @ xcite , _ i . e . _ , the so - called inverse almeida - thouless ( at ) line @ xcite @ xmath1 in weak - field regime where the interaction is important , and the gabay - toulouse ( gt ) line @ xcite @ xmath2 in strong - field regime where the interaction is unimportant . nevertheless , if one notes that the true transition - temperature transition under magnetic fields , as observed in the infinite - range sk model , is unlikely to occur in a more realistic finite - range sk model , an appropriate use of the mean - field model in describing the observed phase transition should be taken with strong caution . thus ,the question of the true nature of the previously observed ` ` ` transition ' ' under magnetic field remains open . however , one of the same authors has proposed another scenario , the spin - chirality self - recoupling scenario , aimed at solving some of the puzzles concerning the previously observed sg ##s @ xcite . in this scenario , _ chirality _ , which is a multispin function of the sense or the type of locally noncoplanar spin structures induced by spin frustration , plays an important role . as shown in fig . [ spin - chiral ] , locally noncoplanar spin structures inherent to the spin - state sustain two mutually equivalent ` ` chiral ' ' states , ` ` right - handed ' ' and ` ` left - handed ' ' respectively , characterized by the opposite signs of the ` ` chiralities ' ' . here , we may denote the ` chirality of _ three _ neighboring states ##s @ xmath3 , @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 # , @ xmath6 this type of chirality is ` ` ` spin chirality ' ' , in distinction with ` ` spin chirality' ' , as a tensor product of two neighboring heisenberg spins , @ xmath7 @ xcite . note that the chirality described by ref . ( [ chidef ] ) is a pseudoscalar in the sense that it is invariant under global @ xmath8 spin reflections but changes its sign under @ xmath9 spin reflections ( or , which can be viewed as a combination of reflections and rotation ) . - @ xmath10 denote four neighboring heisenberg spins . ] for a spin ordered heisenberg spin , in particular , the chirality scenario of ref . @ xcite claims the occurrence of a spin _ chiral - glass _ transition state in which , the chirality undergoes a spontaneous long - length expansion ( lro ) while the spin remains unchanged . in the chiral - glass transition , among the global states of the hamiltonian , @ xmath11 , only the @ xmath9 spin rotation ( inversion ) symmetry is broken along with keeping the @ xmath8 spin rotation ##s intact . note that this picture shows the spin - chirality ( or @ xmath12 ) decoupling under long lengthand time scales : namely , although the chirality is initially independent of the spin on the time scale , it eventually exhibits a long - term behavior quite different from the spin . such a chiral - glass transition without the quantum spin - glass order was first observed in both equilibrium and non - equilibrium monte carlo ( sg ) simulations with zero spin performed by hukushima and one of the authors ( k . k . ) @ xcite . it was also shown , that the critical properties associated with the chiral - glass transition were different from those of the ising model , and that the chiral - glass transition state was not quantum - spin - like - rsb . in the chirality scenario of ref . @ xcite , the sg transition in real heisneberg - like sg ##s is described essentially as a chiral - glass transition ` ` revealed ' ' via the random magnetic field . weak , the random magnetic field applied to sg magnets ` ` recouples ' ' the spin to the chirality , and the chiral - glass transition ends up as an experimentally observable _ _ _ - spin transition in real heisneberg - like sg ##s . an important part of this picture isthat the _ sg transition is dictated by the chiral - glass transition of the fully isotropic system , _ not by the spin - orbit transition of the fully isotropic system _ , which has been derived from the chiral ##ity . more recently , the present authors discussed some of the physical effects of the chirality effect of sg . @ xcite on the finite - field model of the weakly interacting 3d system sg @ xcite . it was argued , that the chiral - glass transition , essentially of the same form as the mean - field one , occurred only in weak fields . in the finite field model , the transition line was shown to be as @ xmath13 where @ xmath14 and @ xmath10 are positive . thus , the constant @ xmath14 could be either positive or negative . an interesting point , is that the chiral - glass transition line ( [ eqn : phaseline ] ) aparrently has a structure similar to the gt line of the mean - field model . we emphasize , however , that their energy structure is entirely different . the energy level of the chiral - glass transition line is that of regular ##ity , whereas that of the gt - line isthe sk ##ew should not be regarded so . in the present paper , we report on our results of large - scale monte carlo simulations on the 3d isotropic solid sg , performed with the aim to reexamine the sg model in applied fields in terms of the chirality scenario . in addition , by means of the numerical analysis , we attempt to understand in detail how the sg and the chirality behave in applied fields . some of the mc results have been published in ref . @ xcite . the present paper is organized as follows . in [ secmodel ] , we present our model and explain some of the results of our numerical analysis . various physical quantities used in our mc calculations are presented in [ secphysq ] . the results of the simulations are presented in [ secresult ] . the results for the chirality - and spin - related quantities are presented in [ subsecchiral ] and [ subsecspin ] , respectively . it is found that the chiral - glass transition , although of the same type as the zero - spin transition , occurs in applied fields . the chiral - glass ordered state exhibits a two - dimensional - wall - of - glass breaking in the chiral sector , while it does not accompanythe zero - spin order perpendicular to the applied field . critical properties of the chiral - glass transition are discussed in [ subseccritical ] . the analysis suggests that the equivalence relation of both the mean - field and finite - spin chiral - glass transitions may be satisfied , which , however , differs from that of the standard model ising sg . in [ subsecphase ] , we construct a simplified phase diagram of the model . the chiral - glass ordered state is more robust against magnetic fields , while the chiral - glass ordered line against magnetic fields has a character of the gt ##d of the mean - field approximation . the [ following ] is devoted to analysis and discussion . our numerical results are discussed in light of the recent experimental work on canonical models . in this section , we describe our model and explain some of the implications of our experimental results . the model we use is the standard model heisenberg model of a cubic - dimensional lattice defined by the hamiltonian , @ xmath15 where @ xmath16 is the three - dimensional unit vector , and @ xmath17 is the intensity of magnetic field applied in the @ xmath18 direction . the nearest - neighbor coupling @ xmath19 is assumedto solve either the case @ xmath20 or @ xmath21 with equal probability ( @ xmath22 only ) . we perform the mc simulations for this case . calculations are performed for a number of cases @ xmath23 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 , 2 . 0 , 3 . 0 , and 4 . 0 , while most extensive calculations are performed for @ xmath24 and 0 . 5 . the materials used are simple - cubic lattices with @ xmath25 sites with @ xmath26 , 8 , 10 , 12 and 16 with periodic boundary conditions . the range is well between 128 - 1400 independent bond lengths , depending on the bond size @ xmath27 and the field size @ xmath17 . some amount of time is also required for @ xmath28 in some cases ( 30 % only ) to check the size dependence of some bond quantities . to achieve efficient thermalization , we replace the traditional hot - bath technique with the cold - bath technique @ xcite . care is taken to make sure that the system is well equilibrated . equilibration is achieved by the following steps : first , we allow the system to move back and forth several times during the thetemperature - exchange times ( usually more than three times ) between the maximum and minimum temperature states , and at the same time check that the relaxation due to the standard heat - bath effect is still stable at the maximum temperature , whose relaxation time is of order @ xmath29 monte carlo times per spin ( t ) . this guarantees that different states of the state space are used in each ` ` run ' ' of the temperature - exchange process . finally , we check the stability of the results against at least three possible different runs for a set of spins . error bars of these quantities are estimated by the sample - to - sample statistical analysis of bond realizations . the details of our monte carlo simulations are summarized in section [ table - 1 ] . in this section , we consider various physical quantities calculated from our calculations above . [ defquantity ] let us begin with the calculation of the chirality . we define the local chirality in the @ xmath30 - th site and in the @ xmath31 - th site , @ xmath32 , for two neighboring heisenberg spins by the equation @ xmath33 where @ xmath34 denotes the position difference along the @ xmath31 - th. . by this definition , there are in fact @ xmath35 ##2 chiral ##ities in the system . the mean absolute value of the chirality , @ xmath36 , may be defined by @ xmath37 \ \ , \ ] ] where @ xmath38 is the local average and [ @ xmath39 the average over the bond length . this value vanishes for local spin structures , and this value tells us the value of the noncoplanarity of the local spin structures . by considering two quantum systems ( ` ` replicas ' ' ) described by the same hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) , one can calculate the value of the chiral variable via the relation , @ xmath40 where @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 represent the chiral ##ities of the form 1 and 2 , respectively . in our simulations , we calculate the two replicas 1 and 2 by considering two different sequences of states in parallel with different local initial conditions and different values of random variables . in terms of this chiral overlap @ xmath43 , the chiral - average - relation may be defined by @ xmath44 \ \ , \ ] ] where the two chiral -glass effect can be defined by @ xmath45 \ \ . \ ] ] for the spin model , the local magnitude of the chirality is time dependent . . in order to take account of this short - term order parameter , we can use the reduced chiral - glass order parameter @ xmath46 and the reduced chiral - glass susceptibility @ xmath47 . replace @ xmath48 and @ xmath49 by appropriate values of @ xmath36 , @ xmath50 the distribution ratio of the chirality is given by @ xmath51 } { [ \ langle { _ { \ left } ^ { \ rangle ] ^ 2 } \ right ) \ \ . \ ] ] we can also use the distribution ratio of the chiral ##ity @ xmath43 , @ xmath52 \ \ . \ ] ] in order to calculate the local magnitude of the effect , we can use the autocorrelation coefficient of the chirality defined by @ xmath53 \ \ . \ . { cxt } \ ] ] where the ` ` ' ' ' @ xmath54 is measured in units of time . in units ( [ [##xt ] ) , which is done according to the standard heat - sink procedure without the temperature - exchange simulation , where the starting spin configuration of @ xmath55 is derived from the starting spin configuration obtained during our temperature - exchange simulation procedure . we then compute the so - called @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 parameters for the chirality , as discussed in the article @ xcite , such as , @ xmath58 - [ \ langle q _ { \ chi } ^ 2 \ rangle ] } { [ \ langle q _ { \ chi } ^ 2 \ rangle ] ^ 2 - [ \ langle q _ { \ chi } ^ 2 \ rangle ] } , \ ] ] @ xmath59 - [ \ langle q _ { \ chi } ^ 2 \ rangle ] } { [ \ langle q _ { \ chi } ^ 4 \ rangle ] ^ 2 } \ \ . \ ] ] these @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 parameters are closely related to the sample - to - sample value of the chiral ##ity parameter . the @ xmath57 parameter is considered to be an example of the non - non - averagingness ofthe order parameter , _ i . e . _ , always vanishes in the state where the order parameter is self - averaging and takes a nonzero value in @ xcite . in contrast , the @ xmath56 variable could take a nonzero value even in a self - averaging ordered state , and therefore , could not be used as an accurate indicator of the non - self - averagingness @ xcite . however , since in the classical limit it vanish in the low - temperature phase and takes a nonzero value in the ordered state , it could also be used as an indicator of the phase transition . as in the case of the chirality , it is convenient to define an overlap variable for the heisenberg spin . in this case , the overlap might also be defined as the _ overlap _ variable @ xmath62 for the @ xmath31 and @ xmath63 components ( @ xmath31 , @ xmath63 = @ xmath64 ) of the highest spin , @ xmath65 where @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 are the @ xmath30 - th heisneberg components ofthe parameters 1 and 2 , respectively . in terms of these two parameters , the ` ` longitudinal ' ' ( perpendicular to the applied field ) and ` ` transverse ' ' ( transverse to the applied field ) second these terms can be defined as @ xmath68 , \ \ \ \ q _ { \ rm l } ^ 2 = q _ { zz } ^ 2 , \ ] ] @ xmath69 , \ \ \ \ q _ { \ rm l } ^ 2 = \ q _ { \ mu , \ nu = 1 , \ } q _ { \ mu \ nu } ^ 2 \ \ . \ ] ] the corresponding transverse and transverse field parameters are given by @ xmath70 } { [ \ langle q _ { \ rm t } ^ 2 \ rangle ] ^ 2 } \ right ) , \ begin { binl } \ ] ] @ xmath71 } { [ \ langle q _ { \ rm t } ^ 2 \ rangle ] ^ 2 } \ right ) \ \ . \ ] ] here , @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 are defined so that , in the classical case , they are in theis - temperature , and gives energy in the nondegenrate ordered state . since an odd number like @ xmath74 does not vanish in applied fields , we can also define the ` ` ' binder ratio ' ' for the diagonal [ @ xcite , @ xmath75 } { [ \ langle ( q _ { \ rm l } - \ langle q _ { \ rm l } \ rangle ) ^ { \ rangle ] ^ 2 } \ right ) . \ ] ] in applied fields , @ xmath76 may also behave differently from @ xmath72 . the transverse - overlap distribution function is also defined on the tensor space . in the following , we pay special attention to the transverse ( @ xmath77 ) distribution . the relevant transverse overlap distribution has @ xmath78 ##1 components . for the purposes of analysis , we use the . @ xcite here and introduce the corresponding transverse - transverse - overlap distribution function @ xmath79 s in terms of the diagonal [ @ xmath80 which is the trace of the tensor ] @ xmath62 s , @ xmath81 the distribution function @ xmath79 is symmetric with respect to@ xmath82 . in the low - temperature limit , each @ xmath62 ( @ xmath83 ) is assumed to be gaussian - distributed by @ xmath84 in the @ xmath85 limit , and so is @ xmath80 . let us hypothesize here that there is a _ _ _ _ - glass ordered system represented by a nonzero @ xmath86 , or by a nonzero , independent sg ##d of @ xmath87 . consider the fact that @ xmath80 transforms nontrivially under the @ xmath88 transformations about the @ xmath18 - basis of the spin replicas , which are the symmetries relevant to the transverse symmetry . in the presence of magnetic fields , only the self - overlap gives nontrivial weights to @ xmath79 other than to @ xmath89 . in the @ xmath85 limit , the self - overlap index of @ xmath79 should be given by @ xmath90 the proof of eq . ( [ ptform ] ) has been published in 2010 . @ xcite in the context of the _ x##y _ sg . if the transverse sg ordered state accompanies rsb , the corresponding nontrivial term would be added to the term given in fig . ( [ ptform ] ) . in this case , the key observation here is that , as long as the ordered state has a single transverse sg lro , the diverging term should appear in @ xmath79 at @ xmath91 as illustrated in fig . [ xylro ] , irrespective to the occurrence of the rsb . this section is the first part of the present paper . here , we present our mc ##s on the 3d @ xmath22 heisenberg effect of magnetic fields . here , we deal with the chirality - related effects . in fig . [ fig - locx ] , we show the temperature and size dependence of the mean local ##ization of the chirality for various materials . as can also be seen from fig . [ fig - locx ] ( a ) , extrapolation of @ xmath92 to @ xmath93 gives non - negative values as long as the magnetic field strength is not too strong , _ i . e . _ , @ xmath94 , _ .295 , 0 . 308 , 0 . 313 , 0 . 260 , and 0 . 265 for @ xmath95 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 , 2 . 0 , 4 . 0 , and 5 . 0 , respectively . this indicates that the spin ordering of the @ heisenberg sg is certainly noncoplanar , which guarantees that the system has the nontrivial chirality . meanwhile , a direct inspection of the spin ordering suggests that the noncoplanar spin configurations realized at a temperature with zero and strong fields is rather close to the coplanar one . indeed , for completely classical configurations of the spins , @ xmath36 should have the value @ xmath96 @ xcite , a value much larger than the corresponding @ xmath97 value . this also suggests that the noncoplanar spin realized in zero and weak fields is close to the classical one . interestingly , our experimental results indicate that , in the weak field regime , @ xmath98 _ _ _ _ with zero magnetic moment at low temperature . this situation could be understood if one notes that the zero - field noncoplanar spin configuration is close to the coplana##r ##1 , and that the action of a magnetic field to produce a particular spin configuration is to ` ` pick up ' ' the spins from this configuration with in the plane parallel to the magnetic field . this gives rise to ` ` ` three - dimensional ' ' ' spin configurations with larger @ xmath36 . of course , when the field is gradually increased , @ xmath98 also decreases simply because not all forces cause spins to move along the plane . in fig . [ fig - locx ] ( a ) , we show the size dependence of @ xmath99 for the fields @ xmath24 . as can be seen from the figure , there is very little size dependence of @ xmath99 . for @ xmath95 , 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 , and for @ xmath26 for other field types . for the case of @ xmath24 , the size dependence of @ xmath36 is shown in fig . ( b ) . ] in fig . [ fig - qx2 ] , we show the chiral - spin order of @ xmath100 for the fields ( a ) @ xmath24 , and ( b ) @ xmath10##1 . for both fields , @ xmath100 increases more rapidly at higher temperature . , and ( b ) @ xmath101 . ] in figs . [ x - gx ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we describe the general properties of the chirality @ xmath102 for the fields ( a ) @ xmath24 , and ( b ) @ xmath101 . as can be seen from the figure , @ xmath103 has a positive dip which , with the @ xmath27 , tends to decrease and shift toward lower temperature . furthermore , @ xmath103 of and @ xmath27 increases at a temperature well above the dip at @ xmath104 _ and negative dip of @ xmath105 _ , eventually breaking at temperatures lower than @ xmath104 . the bonding state of @ xmath103 is similar to the one observed in the original @ xcite . as described in fig . @ xcite , the persistence of a negative dip and the transition occurring at @ xmath106 are strongly suggestive of the existence of a low - temperature transition where @ xmath107 takes a _ negative_ value of the @ xmath108 limit . , and ( 2 ) @ xmath101 . ] in fig . [ fig - 1 ] , we calculate the negative - correlated temperature @ xmath109 versus @ xmath110 for the fields @ xmath24 and @ xmath101 . for these fields , the equation is in a solid line as well . the linear approximation to @ xmath111 , as shown by the dashed lines in the figure , yields our first estimates of the bulk chiral - glass correlation energy , _ i . e . _ , @ xmath112 for @ xmath24 and @ xmath113 for @ xmath101 . more precisely , @ xmath109 should coincide with @ xmath114 where @ xmath115 is the chiral - glass bond - length exponent . as shown above , our estimate of @ xmath116 is close to unity , more or less than the linear approximation employed above . however , extrapolation with respect to @ xmath117 , shown by the dashed curve in fig . [ fig - dip ] , yields @ xmat##h118 for @ xmath24 and @ xmath112 for @ xmath101 . as shall be noted above , we attribute the interesting features of @ xmath105 , _ e . g . _ , the growing negative dip and the crossing occurring in @ xmath106 , to the highly one - step - like - rsb of the chiral - scale ordered system . in systems exhibiting the one - step rsb , _ e . g . _ , the free - floating three - state potts model , the binder state is expected to behave as shown in fig . [ fig - binx ] , with the negative dip and the crossing occurring on the negative scale @ xcite . however , such a behavior is not identical to the behavior we have observed in fig . [ fig - gx ] . an independent value of @ xmath119 can be obtained from the internal dynamics of the model . alternatively , we can use the chirality autocorrelation of @ xmath120 defined by fig . ( [ cxt ] ) . to determine the possible size dependence , we consider in fig . [ fig - x ] the size dependence of @ xmath12##0 for the field @ xmath101 on a log - log basis , computed for ( a ) @ xmath121 , and for ( b ) @ xmath28 . as shown in the figures , @ xmath120 has either a downward curvature characteristic of the free phase , or an upward curvature characteristic of the long - range free phase , depending on whether the curvature is higher or lower than @ xmath122 . just like @ xmath122 , the exponential decay due to the power - law decay is observed . however , our data indicates that the chiral - glass transition takes place at @ xmath123 , in agreement with our previous data obtained on @ xmath105 . from the slope of the curve at @ xmath124 , the value @ xmath125 for the power - law decay of @ xmath126 is estimated to be @ xmath127 . we note that both our data of @ xmath121 shown in fig . [ fig - auto ] ( a ) and of @ xmath28 shown in fig . [ fig - auto ] ( b ) give exactly the same result of @ xmath11##9 and of @ xmath125 , even though the @ xmath121 and @ xmath28 data themselves do not completely match , particularly for @ xmath128 . however , our observation that @ xmath120 has an upward slope of @ xmath119 , corresponding to a nonzero value corresponding to the static chiral ##ity of @ xmath129 , indicates that the chiral - static ordered pair is ` ` ' ' ' with a nonzero long - term order . the same analysis applies to the @ xmath24 case of @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 . for the figures ( a ) @ xmath121 , and ( b ) @ xmath28 . they correspond to @ xmath132 , 0 . 18 , 0 . 19 , 0 . 20 , 0 . 21 , 0 . 22 , 0 . 23 , 0 . 24 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 26 from top to bottom . [ lines of time - series numbers are found for both figures ( a ) and ( b ) at @ xmath133 . ] in fig . [ fig - pqxt016 ] , we show the following##ral - the correlation coefficient @ xmath134 for the energy @ xmath101 at a temperature @ xmath135 , well below @ xmath136 . in addition to the standard ` ` side - peaks ' ' corresponding to the ea order at @ xmath137 , which grow and sharpen with increasing @ xmath27 , there appears a ` ` central peak ' ' at @ xmath138 for temperature @ xmath27 , which also grows and narrows with increasing @ xmath27 . the structure of the model @ xmath139 is very much similar to the one described in ref . @ xcite for zero field , but also quite different from those described in the standard ising - like models such as the # ##h model @ xcite or the zero - field sk model @ xcite . as described in ref . @ xcite in terms of zero field , the physical properties of @ xmath139 are likely to be similar to the _ one - - _ - _ rsb . the presence of a negative charge in the center of @ xmath102 and the absence of the usual mechanism of crossing of @ xmath105 and @ x##math140 is also consistent with the existence of such a two - dimensional - like rsb @ xcite . we note that our data of @ xmath141 are also consistent with the occurrence of a continuous plateau between [ @ xmath142 in addition to the delta - wave transition . at the temperature @ xmath135 , well below the chiral - glass transition temperature , @ xmath143 . ] in fig . [ 2 - gax ] , we show the the structure and the distribution of the @ xmath144 and @ xmath145 parameters for the field @ xmath101 . although the values of the parameters are very large indeed , the transition occurs at temperatures much higher than @ xmath112 for both figures , and the transition temperatures of both figures ( _ e . g . _ @ xmath26 and @ xmath146 _ etc _ ) also shift towards @ xmath112 for larger @ xmath27 . the parameters are consistent with our data of @ xmath119 , based on the crystal structure and the autocorrelation . and @ xmath57 parameters of the chirality for the field @ x##math101 . ] in this section , we present our experimental measurements of the spin - charge quantities . in fig . [ fig - gsl ] and [ fig - gst ] , we show the spin charge ratio for the longitudinal and transverse components , respectively , for the fields ( a ) @ xmath24 , and ( b ) @ xmath101 . for applied fields , the _ spin _ binder _ @ xmath72 decreases monotonically toward unity with increasing @ xmath27 at the temperatures above : see fig . [ fig - gsl ] . this expression reflects the fact that the longitudinal component of the spin has a uniform magnetization unaffected by applied fields at any given temperatures . in contrast , the charge ratio of the transverse component of the spin @ xmath73 decreases toward unity with increasing @ xmath27 , without a zero value nor a crossing : see fig . [ fig - gst ] . this implies that the transverse component of spin remains constant even at @ xmath119 . , and ( b ) @ xmath101 . for the spin @ xmath101 , the result is [ in the fig . ] , and (a ) @ xmath101 . ] in fig . [ fig - gs2 ] , we show the connected pair components of the longitudinal spin spectrum for the fields ( a ) @ xmath24 , and ( b ) @ xmath101 . again , any reflection effect is not observed , neither crossing nor scattering . however , @ xmath147 slowly approaches equilibrium with increasing @ xmath27 , becoming stable at that temperature . ( strictly speaking , the values of @ xmath26 and @ xmath146 for @ xmath24 , show a cross - over pattern for @ xmath148 , but this is limited to these smaller values . ) , and ( c ) @ xmath101 . ] in fig . [ fig - qsxy ] , we show the calculated transverse - spin - overlap distribution of @ xmath149 for the field @ xmath24 at the temperature @ xmath150 , well below the chiral - spin distribution of @ xmath151 . the calculated @ xmath149 has the value ` ` z ' ' , a nonzero value of @ xmath##80 , but as shown in the inset , this ` ` shoulder ' ' is suppressed with increasing @ xmath27 , _ without exhibiting any such suppression _ . such suppression of the shoulder means that the chiral - glass ordered state does not accompany the standard transverse sg order , at least up to around @ xmath152 . for @ xmath101 , we have also observed similar suppression of the shoulder up to temperatures as low as around @ xmath152 . hence , we conclude that the chiral - glass ordered state does not accompany the standard transverse sg order , at least well below the chiral - glass transition point . generally speaking , the observed suppression of the shoulder is still not consistent with the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) - like critical sg ordered state . however , we note that such a critical sg ordered state observed at @ xmath153 is not supported by our data of @ xmath73 shown in fig . [ fig - gst ] . for the field @ xmath24 has a peak @ xmath150 , well below the chiral - glass transition point @ xmath118 . the magnified view of the second part , represented in the imagecircle in the main figure , as shown in the figure . ] in this section , we consider static and dynamic critical points associated with the chiral - glass transition . the analysis above is made for the two magnetic field components , @ xmath24 and @ xmath101 , where the numerical simulations have been performed . in the analysis above , we fix @ xmath136 to be @ xmath154 ( @ xmath24 ) and @ xmath155 ( @ xmath101 ) , as shown below . we estimate for the chiral - glass transition exponent @ xmath156 from the exponential slope of the log - log plot of the initial chiral - glass susceptibility @ xmath47 versus the initial temperature @ xmath157 . this example is shown in fig . [ 1 - getexponents ] ( a ) for the case of @ xmath101 , where the exponential slope @ xmath158 is obtained . we then estimate the chiral - glass critical - point - decay rate @ xmath159 from the @ xmath27 - plot of thechiral - glass temperature is @ xmath160 at @ xmath119 , relative to the data @ xmath161 . an example for the @ xmath101 relation is shown in fig . [ fig - getexponents ] ( 2 ) , where we plot @ xmath160 and @ xmath162 versus @ xmath27 on a log - log line . as can be seen from the figure , the points lie in a straight line as shown . from the slope @ xmath163 , the data @ xmath159 is assumed to be @ xmath164 . the order of the static values , @ xmath165 , @ xmath166 , and @ xmath167 , can be calculated from @ xmath168 and @ xmath169 , using the standard temperature and hyperscaling , as @ xmath170 , @ xmath171 and @ xmath172 . versus the standard temperature for the data @ xmath101 . the slope @ xmath173 is the chiral - glass susceptibility of @ xmath174. the critical value is determined here to be @ xmath155 . ( 2 ) log - log correlation of @ xmath160 versus @ xmath27 for the values @ xmath101 and @ xmath175 . the correlation @ xmath176 determines the chiral - glass zero - point - decay rate to [ @ xmath177 . ] the decay rate @ xmath178 can be calculated from the slope @ xmath179 , via the slope @ xmath180 . from our previous estimate , @ xmath127 , we get @ xmath181 . the same process is repeated for the value of @ xmath24 . we now get @ xmath182 , @ xmath183 , @ xmath184 . these estimates for @ xmath24 agree without contradiction with the above estimates for @ xmath101 . our estimates of the chiral - glass model are summarized in table [ table - criticalexp ] , and are consistent with the corresponding zero - field estimates given in table . @ xcite . the zero - field estimates turn out to agreenote that with the corresonding zero - field exponents , indicating that the zero - field and high - energy chiral - glass transitions lie in a common equivalence class . we conclude that this result is consistent with the chirality prediction of g . @ xcite . in table [ 3 - criticalexp ] , we also show the sg values of the 3d ising ea model @ xcite together with typical sg values ( for finite field ) of the z - type canonical magnet agmn @ xcite . the physical properties of the chiral - glass transition differ clearly from those of the 3d ising ea model . in contrast , the chiral - glass exponents are close to the sg exponent values for canonical magnet agmn , lending strong support to the high - chirality self - recoupling hypothesis . for a consistency check of our estimates of sg and @ xmath119 values , we have also done the following : we use the @ xmath185 value given above , @ xmath186 , and compare the dip ##ole of @ xmath105 , @ xmath109 , to @ xmath187( see the bottom lines of fig . [ fig - dip ] ) . as expected , such an extrapolation yields the corresponding chiral - glass melting temperature , @ xmath151 ( @ xmath24 ) and @ xmath188 ( @ xmath101 ) . these values of @ xmath119 agree with those derived from the chiral autocorrelation and employed in our theoretical analysis . this guarantees that our analysis of both and @ xmath119 is completely accurate . from fig . [ fig - scalingc ] , we obtain the the following sample - based scaling formula for the chiral - glass order , @ xmath48 based on the parameter , @ xmath189 where the @ xmath119 , @ xmath159 and @ xmath167 values are equal to the data values given above . as can be seen from the figure , reasonable scale values are obtained , at least for larger lattices . at the same time , however , one sees that there exists a systematic deviation from the scaling for larger crystals , as in the case of @ xmath24 . such a deviation observed for larger crystals suggests the existence of a relatively large- [ correction . , and ( b ) @ xmath101 . ] the existence of two such scale - invariant ##s has also been suggested from the behavior of the chiral - normal distribution function @ xmath190 and of the chiral aspect ratio @ xmath105 . in a truly - simple case , @ xmath134 itself should occur at @ xmath124 with tuning one exponent @ xmath159 . however , in the range of values given here @ xmath191 , we did not observe such a exact scale of @ xmath134 . such a lack of exact scaling of @ xmath134 gives rise to two degrees of uncertainty in our estimate of @ xmath159 : first , if one tries to scale the width of the distribution function as its second derivative @ xmath48 , it yields @ xmath192 as shown above ( see fig . [ 2 - getexponents ] ( 2 ) ) , but if one tries to scale the height of @ xmath190 , it only yields @ xmath193 , which is somewhat lower than the above estimate , though still well above the quoted error2 . lack of a complete crossing in @ xmath134 is also reflected in the behavior of @ xmath102 , which does not show a complete crossing at @ xmath194 in the range of values studied : instead , as shown in fig . [ 3 - gx ] , the crossing occurs on the right side of @ xmath105 , above @ xmath124 , while the crossing points tend to move more toward @ xmath119 as @ xmath27 increases . for the transverse spin model , from the behaviors of the correlation function and of the diagonal spin - spin - spin correlation function , we have already found a good enough evidence that the chiral - spin transition does not affect the transverse sg order , at or just below @ xmath119 . in other words , the transverse spin of the spin model occurs at zero temperature , or else , if it occurs at a higher temperature , the associated transverse sg transition at @ xmath195 is much lower than @ xmath119 , or , below @ xmath152 . we tell the reader here that , as soon as one looks at the spin correlation or the sg order parameter , a rather complicated analysis isrequired to actually see such a behavior . as an example , we show in fig . [ scalesph01 ] the standard sample - size experimental plots of the transverse sg and field @ xmath196 for @ xmath24 ; ( a ) the one assuming @ xmath197 , and ( b ) the one assuming @ xmath198 . similar plots are shown in fig . [ scalesph05 ] for the field @ xmath101 with assuming @ xmath197 , and ( a ) @ xmath197 and ( b ) @ xmath199 . take a look , these plots are perfectly similar without any difference if the scales are scaled in different ways . thus , one might ask if the electron configuration will occur simultaneously with the chirality , with the transverse sg ( @ xmath200 ) and @ xmath201 : see fig . [ scalesph01 ] . we believe , however , this not to be the case due to the following assumptions . , assuming ( a ) @ xmath202 , and ( b ) @ xmath198 . ] , assuming ( a ) @ xmath202 , and (b ) @ xmath199 . ] first , as shown above , the simultaneous chirality and transverse - spin overlap coincide with our result of the binder ratio @ xmath73 and the diagonal transverse - spin - overlap ratio of @ xmath79 . second , a close examination of the data shows that , above and below @ xmath124 , there is an absolute difference between the values of the transverse spin @ xmath86 and of the chirality @ xmath100 . in fig . [ fig - q2log ] , we observe on a log - log basis the spatial distribution of the sg order parameters , @ xmath86 and @ xmath100 , at the points above and below @ xmath119 . as can be seen from fig . [ fig - q2log ] ( b ) , at @ xmath119 the chiral - glass lattice parameter exhibits a clear upbending for the @ xmath27 , such that @ xmath100 tends to a nonzero value in the thermodynamic limit . in direct contrast to this , such an upbending is never observed for the corresponding sg order parameter @ xmath##86 : instead , @ xmath86 shows a nonlinear downbedning behavior with @ xmath124 , which gradually changes to the more linear behavior at finite temperatures . the observed behavior of @ xmath86 is consistent with either , ( a ) the onset of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) - like transition at a finite temperature at which the crystal - lattice correlations decay rapidly with a power - law expansion , ( b ) the exponential decay of the transverse sg correlation at @ xmath203 which exceeds the required sample size @ xmath121 around a relatively nonzero temperature compared to @ xmath119 . in the former case , there should exist a well - defined finite sg transition temperature with the critical sg transition state , but , in the latter case , there should not exist a transverse sg transition at a finite temperature . strictly speaking , it is difficult to discriminate between the above two cases , from the @ xmath86 data of finite temperature with @ xmath204 . however , we believe we can at least consider here the possibility that the crystal - like transverse sg transition occurs _ simultaneously _ with the chiral - like transition at @ xmat##h124 , accompanied by the critical sg ordered state , @ xmath153 . first , we note that such a critical sg ordered state is not supported by our data of @ xmath73 of fig . [ 1 - gst ] . second , the transverse _ spin _ - glass correlation - length behavior observed in fig . [ scalesph01 ] ( a ) and [ scalesph05 ] ( b ) assuming the transverse spin and chiral transition , @ xmath205 , is derived from from the transverse - critical - dimension ( lcd ) value , @ xmath206 , as defined for such a k - like transition . in so far as one assumes that the transverse sg order occurs simultaneously with the chiral - glass order , our numerical estimate of the transverse spin correlation - length exponent is not compatible with the lcd value @ xmath207 , which is very difficult to reconcile with the kt - like behavior observed in @ xmath86 at @ xmath208 . , for several temperatures above and below @ xmath136 : ( a ) the transverse - spin - glass order parameter @ xmath86 , and ( b ) the chiral - glass orderparameter @ xmath48 . the chiral - glass transition temperature for this field is @ xmath118 . to make the distinction from the others , lines connecting the two small - scale data @ xmath26 and @ xmath209 are drawn at each temperature . ] in fact , as recently stated in ref . @ xcite for the case of the _ xy _ sg , the chirality transition is the main reason why the spin and chiral ##ity are not included in the sg order parameter of the spin correlation function . this would closely be related to the space and time scale of the system . however , one should be aware of the fact that the spin - chirality transition is a _ short - scale _ transition : at short scale , the chirality is not independent of the temperature in this definition , instead of its squared ( @ xmath210 ) as seen from the naive power counting . hence , the one of the spin - glass related states , with the sg order parameter which is a summed correlation , might not be the critical singularity associated with the _ chirality _ _ i . e . _ , the one of the chiral - glass transition , due to certain lengthand time scale . in such a case , apparent ( not true ) , ` ` electron - glass transition ' ' expected would be @ xmath211 and @ xmath212 , the latter being derived from the short - scale relation , @ xmath213 . note that these values are not too far from the ones we obtained from the finite - element model analysis of figs . [ scalesph01 ] ( b ) and [ scalesph05 ] ( c ) , demonstrating the simultaneous existence of the electronic and chiral states . however , we note here that finding a possible criticality in the spin diagram is only a short - scale relation , not a long scale relation . after comparing our estimates of the @ xmath119 value for various field lines , as obtained by the conversion of @ xmath109 to @ xmath187 , we obtain a spin diagram of the temperature vs . the field lines . the result is shown in fig . [ fig - 1 ] . we have used only the zero - field estimate of ref . @ xcite , @ xmath214 . error values are derived directly from the differences between the two @ xmath119 values via the@ xmath110 and @ xmath215 respectively . as is evident from fig . [ fig - phase ] , the chiral - glass transition is very robust against magnetic fields . this is also evident from fig . [ fig - phase ] ( below ) where we draw the following phase lines on a surface where both the temperature and the magnetic - electric axes have common constant values . indeed , @ xmath216 is not much different from the zero - field state , with a field as large as the times of @ xmath217 . under high fields , the chiral - glass transition line is almost identical to the @ xmath218 line , consistent with the coefficient r . ( [ eqn : phaseline ] ) derived from the chirality scenario . our estimates are also almost consistent with the value @ xmath14 in fig . ( [ eqn : phaseline ] ) , almost negative so that @ xmath216 initially _ increases _ slightly with @ xmath17 , but it is difficult to reach a definite conclusion due to the scatter of our estimate of @ xmath216 . if one knows from our mc ##d that the presence of a strong magnetic field tendsto obtain the maximum possible amplitude of the chirality , @ xmath36 , from the zero - field value , only an initial value of @ xmath216 is not totally necessary . - @ xmath219 the diagram of the 3d @ xmath22 heisenberg sg appears in the present simulation . note that the length scales of the @ xmath17 and of the @ xmath219 diagram are mutually exclusive in fig . ( a ) , while they are shown to be common in fig . ( b ) . ] in summary , we have performed large - scale quantum monte carlo simulations on the 3d isotropic heisenberg sg in applied magnetic fields . we have shown that our simulation results are consistent with the chirality predictions of ref . @ xcite . among other things , we have observed the occurrence of a finite - field chiral - glass transition in applied fields , essentially of the same character as the zero - field transition . the chiral - glass transition state exhibits a quantum - step - like peculiar rsb , while it does not exhibit the normal sg structure , at temperatures up to temperatures of @ xmath152 . the occurrence of finite - field chiral - glass transitions seems to becompare with that of the mean - spin one , which , however , clearly differs from the behavior of the standard - ising model . . meanwhile , the chiral - glass parameters turn out to be close to the energy exponents obtained for canonical spin models as agmn . we have also obtained the magnetic phase diagram of the 3d heisenberg sg model . the chiral - glass transition line of the @ xmath17 - @ xmath219 model is shown to be nearly parallel to the temperature line , leading to rather high energies of order @ xmath220 , indicating that the chiral - glass transition line is quite stable against such fields . this somewhat surprising property probably arises from the fact that the magnetic field couples to the hamiltonian _ fo the spin , _ not to the chirality _ , and the mutual interaction between the field and the chirality is rather weak . the chiral - glass transition line has a form of the gabay - type version of the mean - field model , yet its physical properties being quite different . . for comparison , we also show the present experimental result of the magnetic phase diagram of the 3d @ xmath22 ##9 sg model . the way how we havethe type of magnetic field and method for plotting the experimental data is explained in the following . ] it is not immediately possible to make a direct comparison of our results with experiments . this is possible because the random magnetic field , which inevitably occurs in real sg materials , was not introduced in our present experiment . moreover , in real sg materials , spins do not necessarily exist in a cubic - like lattice , nor interact with other spins via the nearest - neighbor @ xmath22 coupling , _ etc _ . in spite of these obvious limitations , it would be interesting to try to compare our theoretical magnetic phase diagram with the experimental data for glass - like sg materials . chirality theory suggests that , in the high - field region where the anisotropy is high relative to the applied magnetic field , the sg transition line should essentially be replaced by the chiral - glass transition line of the real sg sg . if so , our experimental model entails that the sg transition line of real glass - like sg should be almost vertical against the z axis in the low - field regime where the magnetic field overwhelms the random magnetic field . in fig . [ phasedg ] ( a ) , we reproducethe figure @ xmath17 - @ xmath219 phase ##lines of the sg aufe from fig . @ xcite . in the second figure , we also present our present result of the chiral - like transition line , scaled in the following way . we want to model the quantum system in the classical quantum hamiltonian with an effective field @ xmath20 and an effective magnetic field @ xmath17 , which is defined in terms of g . ( [ eqn : phaseline ] ) . first , we estimate the effective - field transition line of the non _ isotropic _ system to be @ xmath221k , by extrapolating the low - energy gt - like transition line of aufe to @ xmath218 . then , with the help of our present result of @ xmath222 , we estimate the effective @ xmath20 field to about 50k . the field intensity @ xmath17 is then transformed into the field intensity in the standard unit @ xmath223 using the formula @ xmath224 , @ xmath225 is the effective bohr number : in terms of aufe , @ xmath225 is the##ly line to be @ xmath226 , where @ xmath227 is the bohr magneton @ xcite . thus , our fig . [ fig - phase ] shows that the sg phase diagram of aufe will stay approximately vertical due to the field as high as @ xmath228 [ fig ] . of course , given the difference in the details between the present experimental and theoretical aufe , one would not expect a more exact correspondence here . anyway , further high - field experiments on aufe and other heisenberg - type permanent magnets will be necessary to confirm the sg phase diagram in the high - field regime . in order to make further comparison with the experimental phase diagram in the low - field regime , it is essential to consider the effects of random magnetic fields inherent to the two materials . thus , in the high - field regime where the applied field strength is comparable to or weaker than the random magnetic field , the chirality scenario predicts the existence of a singular ##ity line which shares some features of the back - end of the mean - field line @ xcite . in order to make further observations into the spin - glass and the chiral - glass regimes of magnetic fields and to makegiven the validity of the chirality scenario , it would be possible to make the mean - value predictions for the _ and _ _ _ _ ##s . the numerial analysis was performed on the hitachi sr8000 of the physics group , issp , university of tokyo . the authors are thankful to dr . s . hukushima , dr . s . yoshino and dr . t . a . nakamura for useful discussion . for articles on spin glasses , see _ e . g . , _ ( a ) m . young and a . p . young : rev . * 58 * ( 1986 ) 801 ; ( b ) j . m . young and j . p . young : _ spin glasses _ cambridge university press ( 1991 ) ; ( c ) j . a . mydosh : _ spin glasses _ taylor & francis ( 1993 ) ; ( d ) a . p . young ( _ m . _ ) : _ spin glasses and random fields _ world scientific , singapore ( 1997 ) . for the static ##al ##bedo , see , for example , ( a ) n . kawashima and a . p . young : phys . rev . b * 58 * ( 1996 ) , (##4 ; ( b ) e . marinari , g . parisi and j . j . ruiz - lorenzo : phys . b . b * 60 * ( 1998 ) 14852 ; ( c ) j . j . martin and j . janke : phys . * 60 * ( 1998 ) 4771 ; ( d ) g . palassini and g . caracciolo : phys . * 60 * ( 1999 ) 5128 ; ( e ) j . m . ballesteros , m . cruz , j . m . fernndez , m . martn - garcia , j . j . ruiz - lorenzo , m . tarancn , m . tllez , m . j . ulod and m . ungil : phys . b * 55 * ( 2000 ) 14237 . for , for example , ( a ) m . de cortenary , h . bouchiat , m . hurdequite and m . fert : j . theory * 47 * ( 1986 ) 2659 ; ( b ) h . bouchiat : j . theory * 47 * ( 1986 ) 265 ; ( c ) m . a . lvy and m . a . ogielski : phys. rev . lett . * * * ( 1986 ) 3288 .
