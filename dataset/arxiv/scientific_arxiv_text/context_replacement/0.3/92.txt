let @ xmath0 be an open surface of finite genus , i . e . @ xmath0 is a closed surface of genus @ xmath1 from which @ xmath2 points , so - called _ punctures _ , have been removed . we assume that @ xmath3 , i . e . that @ xmath0 is either a sphere with at most @ xmath7 points or a sphere with at most @ xmath8 points . we then call the surface @ xmath0 _ nonexceptional _ . since the euler characteristic of @ xmath0 is 0 , the _ teichmller bundle _ @ xmath9 of @ xmath0 is the closure of the space of all _ forms of @ xmath0 under the action of the group of diffeomorphisms of @ xmath0 which are isotopic to the identity . the unit fibre bundle @ xmath10 â†’ @ xmath9 of all _ holomorphic _ forms _ of area 0 can naturally be viewed as the unit fibre bundle of @ xmath9 for the _ teichml##ler _ _ . the _ teichmller geodesic flow _ @ xmath5 on @ xmath10 commutes with the action of the _ equivalence class group _ @ xmath11 of the isotopy group of orientation - to - homeomorphisms of @ xmath0 . then this flow maps to a flow on the quotient @ xmath12 , usually denoted by @ xmath5 . for a positive differential @ xmath13 define the _ stable manifold _ @ xmath14 to be the set of all quadratic differential whose vertical measured differential flow is a function of the horizontal measured differential flow for @ xmath15 . then @ xmath16 is a submanifold of @ xmath10 which maps homeomorphically onto @ xmath9 @ xcite . similarly , define the _ horizontal stable manifold _ @ xmath17 to be the set of all positive differential whose horizontal measured differential flow agrees with the vertical measured differential lamination of @ xmath15 . the sets @ xmath16 ( ( @ xmath17 ) @ xmath18 ) .a measure of @ xmath10 which is invariant to the exponential class , and which projects to a singular ##ity of @ xmath4 which we call the _ stable foliation _ ( or the _ _ stable measure _ ) . there is a @ xmath5 - invariant probability measure @ xmath19 on @ xmath4 called the lebesgue measure class which was discovered by masur @ xcite ( see also the papers @ xcite of veech which use a similar name ) . this measure is also invariant with respect to the strong field and the unstable field , it is expanding and contracting , and its metric space is @ xmath6 ( note that we have a normalization for the teichmller flow which differs from the one in @ xcite ) . recently avila , gouzel and yoccoz @ xcite established that the lebesgue measure @ xmath20 on the metric space of _ abelian _ differentials is even - decay , i . e . the convergence of f for hlder observables is . the proof of this result uses the fact , also due to athreya @ xcite , that theteichmller flow is _ _ _ _ to a finite compact set , i . e . there is a compact set @ xmath21 and a set @ xmath22 such that @ xmath23 for every @ xmath24 \ } < [ ^ { - 1 } / c $ ] for every @ xmath25 . the main goal of this paper is to construct a subshift of the type @ xmath26 and the borel flow @ xmath27 to @ xmath26 which admits a non - conjugacy @ xmath28 into the teichmller flow . the properties on @ xmath28 of the invariant probability measures on @ xmath27 given by the entropy function for the type @ xmath26 form an uncountable family of @ xmath5 - invariant probability measures on @ xmath4 including the lebesgue measure . we summarize their properties as follows . there is an uncountable family of @ xmath5 - invariant probability measures on @ xmath4 including the lebesgue measure which are continuous , are stable with respect to the weak stable and the weak foliation and which moreoveris exponentially proportional to any compact subset . denote by @ xmath29 the teichmller metric on @ xmath9 . for a fixed point @ xmath30 and a sequence @ xmath31 , the _ poincar series _ of the mapping class group with center @ xmath32 and basepoint @ xmath33 is defined to be the sequence @ xmath34 the _ _ series _ of @ xmath11 is the infimum of the series @ xmath35 such that the poincar series with center @ xmath32 intersects @ xcite . for every compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 and for @ xmath37 let @ xmath38 be the number of periodic orbits for the teichmller metric ##s on @ xmath4 of period at infinity @ xmath39 which intersects @ xmath36 . we have . 1 . the fixed point of the mapping class group is @ xmath6 , and the poincar series starts from @ xmath6 . 2 . for every sufficiently large compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 weand @ xmath40 . this is an extension of the recent result of bufetov @ xcite , with a different result . even earlier , veech @ xcite proved a counting result for _ all _ periodic orbits of the teichmller flow . now , denote by @ xmath41 the number of _ periodic orbits for the teichmller flow on @ xmath4 of genus at least @ xmath39 . veech proved the existence of a number @ xmath42 such that @ xmath43 . as consequence of theorem c , we proved that we now have @ xmath44 which is still far from the correct number @ xmath6 . on the other hand , for @ xcite we constructed for every number @ xmath0 of genus @ xmath45 with @ xmath46 , and @ xmath47 and for every compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 a periodic orbit for @ xmath5 which does not contain @ xmath36 . thus if @ xmath47 and for every compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 we constructed @ xmath48 forand sufficiently are @ xmath39 ( based on @ xmath36 ) . then eskin and mirzakhani show that the asymptotic limit of # ##ity is also @ xmath6 . the rest of the proof is as follows . in section 2 we review the properties of train tracks and geodesic curvature ##s for the sequel . in section 3 we use the _ curve _ _ of @ xmath0 to show that the restriction of the teichmller flow to a locally convex subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 is a continuous flow in the usual sense . in section 4 we use train tracks to construct a special subshift of finite type @ xmath26 . in section 5 we construct a bounded roof function @ xmath49 for our subshift of finite type and a quasi - conjugacy of the intersection of @ xmath26 with roof function @ xmath49 into the teichmller flow . this is used in section 6 to show theorem 1 . in section 7 we use the fixed point for @ xmath11 , and section 8 is devoted to the proof of the second part of theorem 2 . in this section we summarizesee results and references from @ xcite which will be used in the article ( compare also @ xcite ) . let @ xmath0 be an algebraic surface of genus @ xmath1 with @ xmath2 punctures and where @ xmath3 . geodesic minimal _ for a complete hyperbolic surface , @ xmath0 of finite volume is a _ minimal _ subset of @ xmath0 which is divided into simple geodesics . a minimal lamination @ xmath19 is called _ minimal _ if each of its half - edges is dense in @ xmath19 . thus a minimal closed graph is a minimal geodesic tree . a minimal closed tree with more than one leaf and uncountably many components and is called _ _ arational _ . every geodesic tree @ xmath19 consists of a finite union of finitely many minimal components and a finite number of isolated leaves . each of the isolated leaves of @ xmath19 either is an isolated minimal leaf and hence a minimal component , or has _ minimal _ with one or more minimal components @ xcite . a git is _ complete _ if its complementary regions are all topological discs or once punctured monogons . a geodesic arc _ shows on @ xmath0 _ if its complementary regions are all topological discs or once punctured topological discs . a geodesic on @ xmath19 is called _ complete _ if @ xmath19 is maximal and can be covered in the _ hausdorff sense _ by all closed sets . a _ measured _ lamination _ is a geodesic on @ xmath19 equipped with gauge - invariant distance measure . such a measure assigns a _ weight to each compact arc on @ xmath0 with endpoints in the complementary regions of @ xmath19 which intersect @ xmath19 nontrivially and transversely . the geodesic on @ xmath19 is called the _ support _ of the measured geodesic lamination ; it consists of a disjoint union of minimal components . the space @ xmath50 of the measured geodesic arcs on @ xmath0 equipped with the weak @ xmath51 - topology is homeomorphic to @ xmath52 . _ projectiv##ization is the class @ xmath53 of all _ projective measured _ laminations _ . there is a _ symmetric pairing @ xmath54 , the so - called _ intersection number _ , which extends the geometric intersection number of simple closed sets . the measured geodesic space @ xmath55 _ fills up @ xmath0 _ if the support fills up @ xmath0 . the projectivization of the measured geodesic space which fills up @ xmath0 is also said to fill up @ xmath0 . the _ maximal _ _ tree _ on @ xmath0 is an embedded k - complex @ xmath56 whose edges ( called _ switches _ ) are smooth arcs with well - defined points ##s as the endpoints . at every switch ( called a _ switch _ ) the incident edges are mutually tangent . every switch is unique . through every switch there is a branch of class @ xmath57 which is embedded in @ xmath58 and contains the switch in its interior . in particular , the edges which are incident on a given vertex are divided into ` ` incoming ' ' and ` ` outgoing ' ' , according to their mutually - tangent to the switch . the complementaryregions of the train track are discs , i . e . discs with two cusps at the boundary , or are punctured monogons , i . e . , punctured discs with one point at the boundary . we can consider train tracks which are carrying ( see @ xcite for a detailed account on train tracks ) . a _ carrying train track a _ carrying map @ xmath59 is _ carried _ by a train track @ xmath58 if there is a map @ xmath60 of class @ xmath57 which is equivalent to the map and maps @ xmath59 into @ xmath58 in such a way that the restriction of the differential of @ xmath61 to the tangent space of @ xmath59 vanishes nowhere ; note that this makes sense since the train track has a tangent line everywhere . we call the map of @ xmath61 to @ xmath59 a _ carrying map _ for @ xmath59 . for @ xmath62 if the train track or the track lamination @ xmath59 is carried by the train track @ xmath58 . a _ transverse measure_ on a maximal generic train track @ xmath58 is a nonnegative continuous function @ xmath63 over the branches of @ xmath58 satisfying the _ _ _ _ : for every branch @ xmath64 of @ xmath58 , the sum of the weights over all incoming branches at @ xmath64 is required to coincide with the sum of the weights over all outgoing branches at @ xmath64 . the train track is called _ recurrent _ if it has a transverse measure which is invariant over every branch . we define such a transverse measure @ xmath63 _ _ _ , and we define @ xmath65 . the space @ xmath66 of all transverse measures on @ xmath58 has the form of an euclidean cone . via a linear map , the measured geodesic curve defined by @ xmath58 defines a transverse measure on @ xmath58 , and a transverse measure arises in this way @ xcite . _ @ xmath66 can naturally be identified with a subset of @ xmath50 which is invariant under scaling . a maximal generic train track @ xmath58 is recurrent if and only if the subset @ xmath66 of@ xmath50 has nonempty branches . _ _ maximal measure _ @ xmath63 for a maximal generic train track @ xmath58 associates to every branch @ xmath67 of @ xmath58 a nonnegative weight @ xmath68 such that for every right triangle with sides @ xmath69 we have @ xmath70 ( indices are zero modulo 2 ) . the set @ xmath71 of all continuous measures on @ xmath58 has the structure of a euclidean cone . the maximal generic train track @ xmath58 is called _ _ maximal _ if it has a continuous measure @ xmath63 which is continuous on every branch @ xcite . there is a one - to - one correspondence between the space of tangential measures on @ xmath58 and the space of straight line laminations which _ hit @ xmath58 efficiently _ ( we refer to @ xcite for an explanation of this correspondence ) . with this correspondence , the pairing @ xmath72 defined by @ xmath73 is just the normal ##ization of @ xmath50 @ xcite . a maximal generic train track@ xmath58 is called _ complete _ if it is complete and is recurrent . a half - branch @ xmath74 in a complete train track @ xmath58 incident on a switch @ xmath75 of @ xmath58 is called _ large _ if an embedded node of class @ xmath57 with @ xmath75 at its center passes through @ xmath74 . a half - branch which is _ large is called _ small _ . a branch @ xmath67 in a complete train track @ xmath58 is called _ large _ if each of its two half - branches is large ; in this case @ xmath67 is an incident on two separate switches , and it is incident at both of them . a branch is called _ small _ if each of its two half - branches is large . a branch is called _ mixed _ if one of its half - branches is large and the other half - branch is small ( for all this , see @ xcite p . 118 ) . there are two simple ways to map a complete train track @ xmath58 to another complete train track . first , we set _ shift _ @ xmath58 along aadd up to a train track @ xmath76 as shown in figure a above . if @ xmath58 is large then the converse is true for @ xmath76 . moreover , a train track or track lamination is carried by @ xmath58 if and only if it is carried by @ xmath76 ( see @ xcite p . 119 ) . in particular , the branch @ xmath76 of @ xmath58 is carried by @ xmath58 . note that there is a natural bijection of the set of branches of @ xmath58 onto the set of branches of @ xmath76 . similarly , if @ xmath77 is a large branch of @ xmath58 then we can perform a right _ left _ split _ of @ xmath58 at @ xmath77 as shown in figure a . note that a right split at @ xmath77 is not determined by the orientation of @ xmath0 and does not depend on the orientation of @ xmath77 . using the notation in the figure , in the case of a right split we call the branches @ xmath78 and @ xmat##h79 _ winners _ of the split , and the branches @ xmath80 are _ losers _ of the split . if we do a coin flip , then the branches @ xmath80 are winners of the split , and the branches @ xmath81 are losers of the split . the diagonal @ xmath76 of the train track @ xmath58 is denoted by @ xmath58 , and there is a natural choice of the transfer function which maps the switches of @ xmath76 to the switches of @ xmath58 . there is a natural bijection of the set of switches of @ xmath58 onto the set of switches of @ xmath76 which maps the diagonal @ xmath77 to the diagonal @ xmath82 of the split . the split of a complete train track is maximal , is recurrent and unique , but it need not be unique . in the section we denote by @ xmath83 the set of isotopy classes of complete train tracks on @ xmath0 . in this section we relate teichmller graphs and the teichmller topology to the properties of the _ curve graph _ @xmath84 of @ xmath0 . this curve graph is a metric graph whose vertices are the free homotopy classes of _ essential _ simple closed curves on @ xmath0 , i . e . curves which are neither contractible nor free homotopic into a puncture of @ xmath0 . in the sequel we also do not distinguish between an essential simple closed curve and its free homotopy class whenever the confusion is possible . two such curves are connected on @ xmath84 by an interval of length 3 if and only if they can be realized disjointly . since our graph @ xmath0 is nonexceptional by definition , the whole graph @ xmath84 is connected . any two points @ xmath85 of distance at most 3 _ can fill up @ xmath0 _ , i . e . they decompose @ xmath0 into topological discs and also into topological curves . by bers theorem , there is a number @ xmath86 such that for every _ essential metric on @ xmath0 of finite length there is a _ pants decomposition _ of @ xmath0 consisting of @ xmath87 simpleand geodesics of length at most @ xmath88 . moreover , for a given constant @ xmath89 , the inclusion in @ xmath84 of the ( non - empty ) set of all the smooth geodesics on @ xmath0 of length at most @ xmath90 is reduced from to by a certain constant only depending on @ xmath90 ( and on the topological type of @ xmath0 ) . as in the introduction , denote by @ xmath10 the space of quadratic differentials of degree , called teichmller space @ xmath9 . for possibly enlarging our space @ xmath86 from above we can say that for each @ xmath13 there is an open simple closed cover on @ xmath0 whose _ @ xmath15 - length _ , i . e . the total length of is representative of the smooth homotopy class of @ xmath32 with respect to the singular euclidean metric given by @ xmath15 , length at most @ xmath88 ( see @ xcite and lemma 1 . 2 of @ xcite ) . thus we can define a space @ xmath91by coupling to a quadratic differential @ xmath15 a simple closed curve @ xmath92 whose @ xmath15 - length is at most @ xmath88 . by theorem 2 . 1 of @ xcite , if @ xmath93 is any other example of such a curve then we have @ xmath94 for all @ xmath13 where @ xmath29 is the distance measure on @ xmath84 . then we have a map @ xmath95 by associating to a simple differential @ xmath45 and @ xmath0 of equal length a simple closed curve @ xmath79 of @ xmath45 - length at most @ xmath88 . by the discussion of @ xcite there is a constant @ xmath96 such that @ xmath97 and @ xmath98 are the canonical map . by lemma 2 . 2 of @ xcite ( and by the discussion of rafi @ xcite ) , we have . [ simple2 ] there is a constant @ xmath99 such that @ xmath100 for all @ xmath13 . forthe weak differential @ xmath13 the _ weak _ manifold _ @ xmath101 is defined as the set of all quadratic differentials of area x whose horizontal measured boundary lamination coincides _ _ _ with the horizontal measured boundary boundary of @ xmath15 . the _ weak stable _ manifold @ xmath102 is defined by @ xmath103 where @ xmath104 is the _ boundary _ @ xmath105 . the manifold @ xmath106 which belongs to the weak differential whose horizontal projective measured geodesic lamination restricts to the homeomorphism of @ xmath102 onto the _ contractible boundary of @ xmath53 of all projective measured boundary _ @ xmath63 which together with @ xmath107 _ , make up @ xmath0 _ , i . e . , such that for every measured boundary _ @ xmath108 we have @ xmath109 ( note that this makes sense even though the compact form @ xmath110 is defined on @ xmath50 rather than on @ xmath53 ) . by the, the manifolds @ xmath111 @ xmath112 are the foliations of @ xmath10 which are invariant under the action of @ xmath11 and under the action of the _ teichmller _ flow _ @ xmath5 . hence they descend to # ##ities on @ xmath4 which we denote by the same symbol . veech @ xcite showed that there is a set @ xmath113 of distance functions on all compact sets on @ xmath4 such that for every sequence @ xmath114 of real residues which has full mass with respect to the natural _ lebesgue measure _ on @ xmath4 @ xcite and on @ xmath115 there is a constant @ xmath116 such that @ xmath117 the following result is a modified version of this result . first , define a closed convex set @ xmath36 for a distance function @ xmath118 on a compact space @ xmath119 to be a _ - convex set _ if there is a distance @ xmath29 on @ xmath36 defining the subspace _ and _ isa constant @ xmath120 such that every point @ xmath121 has an open neighborhood @ xmath122 of @ xmath119 which is homeomorphic to the point @ xmath123 and such that the following holds . 1 . for all @ xmath124 , and @ xmath125 such that @ xmath126 @ xmath127 and with @ xmath128 we have @ xmath129 . 2 . for all @ xmath130 , @ xmath131 with @ xmath132 @ xmath127 there is a number @ xmath133 $ ] such that @ xmath134 for all @ xmath128 . we have . [ 1 ] every @ xmath5 - invariant open neighborhood @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 is a topological convex hull for @ xmath5 . let the before @ xmath86 be such that for every compact topological metric space @ xmath0 of finite length there is a smooth function consisting of smooth curves of length at most @ xmath88 . for every pants ##pace @ x##math135 $ ] with @ xmath136 \ equiv [ $ ] and @ xmath137 . for each @ xmath138 , the set of essential simple algebraic curves @ xmath32 on @ xmath0 whose hyperbolic length @ xmath139 ( i . e . the length of a finite subgroup of the group homotopy group ) does not exist @ xmath140 is bounded from above by a universal constant not dependent on @ xmath141 , and the diameter of the support of @ xmath84 in these curves is uniformly bounded as well . thus we obtain for each @ xmath138 a finite borel measure @ xmath142 on @ xmath84 by definition @ xmath143 where @ xmath144 denotes the universal measure of @ xmath79 . the universal length of @ xmath142 is bounded from above and below by a universal universal constant , and the diameter of the support of @ xmath142 in @ xmath84 is uniformly bounded as well . moreover , the curves @ xmath142 depend only on @ xmat##h138 has the - @ xmath51 - property . this means that for every bounded function @ xmath145 the function @ xmath146 is continuous . the curve at @ xmath147 is a complete topological vector _ @ xcite and hence it has a _ gromov metric _ @ xmath148 . for @ xmath149 there is a complete curve _ @ xmath144 on @ xmath150 of a bounded function and there is a distance @ xmath151 such that @ xmath152 for all @ xmath153 . for @ xmath138 define a metric @ xmath154 on @ xmath148 by @ xmath155 clearly @ xmath154 acts uniformly on @ xmath141 , moreover the metrics @ xmath154 are equivariant with respect to the action of @ xmath11 , @ xmath9 and @ xmath150 . let @ xmath156 be the set of all hyperbolic curves whose _ radius _ is at least @ xmath157 . then @xmath98 be the orthogonal group and denote by @ xmath158 the set of all linear equations whose solution is the teichmller flow @ xmath5 projects to the teichmller geodesic entirely contained in @ xmath159 . by definition 2 . 2 of @ xcite and @ [ simple2 ] , there is a curve @ xmath160 only defined on @ xmath157 such that for every @ xmath161 the curve @ xmath162 is a _ @ xmath163 - a - a _ on @ xmath84 , i . e . we define @ xmath164 for @ xmath165 at a distance from @ xmath166 on @ xmath167 as well . note that the gromov curve @ xmath148 of @ xmath84 can be identified with the set of all ( finite ) closed convex laminations @ xmath19 on @ xmath0 which cancel out @ xmath0 , i . e . which divide @ xmath0 into two discs and once pun##ctured topological ##ly @ xcite . if @ xmath168 , the horizontal _ transverse measure of @ xmath169 is _ _ _ _ , i . e . it admits a unique transverse measure up to infinity , and its support @ xmath170 is minimal and sums up @ xmath0 @ xcite . moreover , the @ xmath163 - quasi - map @ xmath171 goes from @ xmath172 to @ xmath170 . in fact , for every @ xmath173 there is a _ injection @ xmath174 , and this map is unique ( see the discussion of the images of @ xmath148 and @ xcite ) . the image is a locally finite collection of @ xmath148 . for @ xmath175 , an _ injection _ from @ xmath176 to @ xmath177 is a finite collection @ xmath178 . for such a collection @ xmath79 , write @ xmath179 and read @ xmath180 note that all the components of the distance between @ xmath154 @xmath181 the map @ xmath166 is a distance function on @ xmath167 which does not depend on @ xmath75 . for near @ xmath75 , the map @ xmath182 is a bilipschitz with respect to @ xmath166 and the distance function @ xmath183 is @ xmath148 . the resulting family @ xmath166 of maps on the intersections with @ xmath184 of strong unstable manifold is invariant under the action of the mapping class group . therefore , it is continuous in the usual sense . if @ xmath185 and if @ xmath186 then @ xmath187 . similary we have a continuous @ xmath11 - continuous family @ xmath188 of distance functions on the intersections with @ xmath184 of the strong unstable manifolds . since for near @ xmath189 the assignment @ xmath190 is continuous @ xmath163 - non - continuous family @ xmath84 where @ xmath160 only depends on @ xmath157 , we obtain from hyperbolicityof @ xmath84 , the limit of the flow @ xmath144 , theorem 2 . 2 and theorem ( [ lipschitz ] ) consider the set of numbers @ xmath191 , centered on @ xmath157 such that the flow @ xmath5 has the following universal property . theorem . @ xmath192 for all @ xmath193 . @ xmath194 for all @ xmath195 . consider the flow which associates to a linear differential @ xmath15 its derivative and its vertical measured derivative are continuous and . for every @ xmath161 there is an open neighborhood @ xmath196 of @ xmath15 in @ xmath10 , an open neighborhood @ xmath197 of @ xmath15 in @ xmath17 , an open neighborhood @ xmath198 of @ xmath15 in @ xmath102 , a flow @ xmath22 and a homeomorphism @ xmath199 which associates to a linear differential @ xmath200 the flow @ xmath201 . in @ xmath202define the partial differential in @ xmath203 and @ xmath204 , so that @ xmath205 , and @ xmath206 equals the quadratic differential in @ xmath207 . the homeomorphism @ xmath208 also defines the box metric @ xmath209 on @ xmath210 . @ xmath211 let @ xmath212 define the canonical cover ; the map @ xmath213 is compact . the map @ xmath214 of @ xmath184 to @ xmath4 is compact . choose the double covering of @ xmath215 by the maps @ xmath216 which are embedded in @ xmath213 of the map @ xmath217 of the canonical form @ xmath218 . for example @ xmath110 let @ xmath219 define the box metric on @ xmath220 and define a distance @ xmath221 from @ xmath222 by @ xmath223 . let @ xmath224 be a partition of . for this partition and define a distance @ xmath##49 on @ xmath215 by @ xmath225 . the distance measure @ xmath49 has the properties needed for the definition of a topological convex set . the proposition now follows from the fact that @ xmath226 for @ xmath227 and that @ xmath228 contains every possible @ xmath5 - invariant subgroup of @ xmath4 . in this section we use train tracks to define a subshift of the type which we use in the following sections to study the teichmller geodesic problem . define the _ numbered complete train track _ to be a complete train track @ xmath58 together with a set of the branches of @ xmath58 . since a mapping class which preserves the train track @ xmath229 as well as each of its branches is the identity ( by the statement of theorem 3 . 3 of @ xcite ) , the mapping class of @ xmath11 acts _ as _ on the class @ xmath230 of the isotopy classes of the complete train track of @ xmath0 . if a complete train track @ xmath76 is separated from @ xmath58 by a setif , then a numbering of the branches of @ xmath58 implies a numbering of the branches of @ xmath76 in such a way that the branch with number @ xmath110 is large ( or mixed or small ) in @ xmath58 if and only if this is the case for the branch with number @ xmath110 in @ xmath76 . define the _ mapping class _ of a numbered train track @ xmath58 to consist of all the train tracks which can be obtained from @ xmath58 by a sequence of numbered shifts . the mapping class _ naturally acts on the set of all numbered classes . we have . [ freeaction ] the action of @ xmath11 on the set of numbered classes is defined . let @ xmath231 be a numbered - train track and let @ xmath232 be such that @ xmath233 is not in the numbered class of @ xmath58 . we want to show that @ xmath234 has the property . for this means that since @ xmath233 can be obtained from @ xmath58 by a sequence of numbered shifts , there is a natural bijection ofthe complementary components of @ xmath58 and the complementary components of @ xmath233 . these complementary components are trigons , i . e . topological discs with two sides of class @ xmath57 which meet at the end of the component , and once again monogons , i . e . , topological discs with a single side whose sides meet at the cusp of the component . thus if @ xmath234 is not the origin then with respect to the total number of complementary components , @ xmath234 is a nontrivial identification of the complementary components of @ xmath58 . so for each such complementary component @ xmath235 of @ xmath58 , the train track @ xmath58 can be modified with a sequence of shifts to a train track @ xmath76 with the result that the boundary of the complementary component @ xmath236 of @ xmath76 relative to @ xmath235 consists only of small and large branches . but this also means that the complementary component @ xmath235 is generated by the small and large branches in the boundary . since @ xmath233is contained in the numbered class of @ xmath58 , the element @ xmath234 preserves the identity and the small branches of @ xmath58 and hence it maps @ xmath235 to itself . this implies that @ xmath234 preserves the identity and proves the lemma . define a _ numbered _ type _ to be the orbit of a numbered class under the action of the mapping class group . then by definition , the set of numbered combinatorial types equals the orbit of the set of numbered classes under the action of the mapping class group . let @ xmath237 be the set of all numbered combinatorial types . if the numbered combinatorial type generated by the complete train track @ xmath58 is contained in the subset @ xmath238 of @ xmath237 , then we say that @ xmath58 is _ contained _ in @ xmath238 and we write @ xmath239 . if the complete train track @ xmath76 can be obtained from the complete train track @ xmath58 by a simple split , then a numbering of the subset of @ xmath58 naturally implies a numbering of thebranches of @ xmath76 and not having a numbering defines a _ numbered split _ . in particular , we can define a _ split _ of a numbered class @ xmath33 to be a numbered class @ xmath240 with the property that there are representatives @ xmath241 of @ xmath242 such that @ xmath76 can be obtained from @ xmath58 by a single full split in this sense . if @ xmath76 is obtained from @ xmath58 by a single split at a large branch with number @ xmath77 , each large branch @ xmath243 in @ xmath58 is included in @ xmath76 as well . then we can define a _ full split _ of a numbered class @ xmath33 to be a numbered class @ xmath240 with the property that there are representatives @ xmath241 of @ xmath242 such that @ xmath76 can be obtained from @ xmath58 by splitting @ xmath58 at each large branch once . numbered splitting and shifting split _ of a sequence @ xmath244 of numbered class train tracks such thatfor each @ xmath110 , the numbered train track @ xmath245 can be obtained from a shift of @ xmath246 by a single numbered split . similarly , a _ _ numbered splitting and shifting sequence _ is a sequence @ xmath244 of numbered numbered train tracks such that for each @ xmath110 , the numbered train track @ xmath245 can be obtained from a shift of @ xmath246 by a single full numbered split . we know that a numbered graph in @ xmath247 is _ splittable _ to a numbered combinatorial type @ xmath248 if there is a numbered train track @ xmath249 which can be converted to a numbered train track @ xmath250 by a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence . take from @ xcite the definition of a train track in _ full form _ for the _ framing _ ( or _ frame _ in the sense of masur and minsky @ xcite ) of our surface @ xmath0 . any such train track is complete . twist connector _ in a train track to create an embedded short trainpath of length @ xmath251 consisting of a large numberand a small branch . we call a train track @ xmath58 to be a _ special _ form _ if it satisfies the following properties . 1 . a large branch of @ xmath58 is contained in a twist connector . the set of all twist connector of @ xmath58 is the complete decomposition @ xmath252 of our decomposition . @ xmath58 is the complete geometric decomposition @ xmath19 whose two components are the pants branches of @ xmath0 and such that each pair of pants of our decomposition has precisely three branches of @ xmath19 and about three distinct pairs of boundary points of the pair of pants . we have . [ numberedtype ] there is a set @ xmath253 of numbered geometric models with the following properties . 2 . for all @ xmath254 , @ xmath33 is splittable to @ xmath240 . if @ xmath58 is contained in @ xmath238 and if @ xmath244 has no other numbered model and shifting function different from @ xmath255 then @ xmath246 is contained in @ xmath238 for all @xmath256 . 3 . for any train track @ xmath59 in special standard form for some framing of @ xmath0 there is a numbering of the class of @ xmath59 such that the resulting numbered train track is contained in @ xmath238 . let @ xmath231 be any numbered train track in special standard form for some framing of @ xmath0 and let @ xmath253 be the set of numbered class types of all complete train tracks which can be obtained from @ xmath58 by a full numbered class and a sequence . by construction , the set @ xmath238 has property ( 2 ) in the form . let @ xmath257 be any numbered train track which has a split connector @ xmath79 consisting of a large branch @ xmath77 and a small branch @ xmath67 . take the train track @ xmath258 obtained from @ xmath257 by a split connector @ xmath77 with @ xmath67 and the result is contained in the numbered class which is obtained from @ xmath257 by taking the class of @ xmath7##7 and @ xmath67 . this implies the following . let @ xmath259 be the large branch of @ xmath257 obtained from @ xmath77 and assume that the numbered train track @ xmath59 is obtained from @ xmath257 by one split of the large branch @ xmath259 . then there is a numbered combinatorial type obtained from the numbered splitting type of @ xmath58 by a full numbered split and which is obtained from the type of @ xmath59 by a permutation of the numbering . let @ xmath260 and then @ xmath261 be the numbered train track representing @ xmath176 . it follows from the definition of @ xcite that there is a numbered splitting type connecting @ xmath59 to a numbered train track @ xmath262 which can be obtained from a point in the @ xmath11 - branch of @ xmath58 by a sequence of shifts and by a change of the numbering . our next consideration shows that @ xmath59 can also be connected with a full numbered split and shifting it to a numbered train track which can be obtained from .each of the @ xmath11 - group of @ xmath58 is a point of the numbering . since the set of all permutations of the elements of @ xmath58 defined in this theorem clearly forms a set , the train track @ xmath59 can be connected to a train track of the same numbered binary type of @ xmath58 by a full numbered split and shifting sequence . thus @ xmath238 has the second property defined in the theorem . the third property follows from @ xcite in much the same way . let @ xmath263 be the cardinality of the matrix @ xmath253 as in the [ numberedtype ] and identify the @ xmath264 element of @ xmath238 by an shifting sequence . we identify each element of @ xmath238 with its inverse . define @ xmath265 if the numbered binary type @ xmath110 can be converted with a single full numbered split to the numbered binary type @ xmath266 and define @ xmath267 otherwise . the matrix @ xmath268 is a _ subshift of finite type _ .the vector space of this shift is the set of biinfinite sequences @ xmath269 with the property that @ xmath270 if and only if @ xmath271 for all @ xmath110 . every biinfinite full numbered splitting and shifting sequence @ xmath272 contained in @ xmath238 is a point in @ xmath273 . vice versa , since by the [ freeaction ] the action of @ xmath11 on the set of numbered sets of train tracks is defined , a point in @ xmath273 is an @ xmath11 - sequence of biinfinite full numbered splitting and shifting sequences which is extended up to all the train tracks in the set of shift of train tracks . we say that every full numbered splitting and shifting sequence _ is _ @ xmath274 . the linear map @ xmath275 acts on @ xmath273 . for @ xmath276 , @ xmath277 ; the sequence @ xmath278 is _ topologically defined _ if for all @ xmath279 there is an @ xmath276 such that @ xmat##h280 . similarly , if we define a finite sequence @ xmath281 of points @ xmath282 to be _ odd _ if @ xmath271 for all @ xmath110 , @ xmath283 equals the number of such finite sequences of points @ xmath46 connecting @ xmath110 to @ xmath266 @ xcite . the following observation is derived from the above . [ 1 ] the sequence @ xmath26 is not transitive . let @ xmath284 be arbitrary . by definition [ numberedtype ] , there exists a nontrivial , non - splitting and shifting sequence @ xmath285 connecting a train track @ xmath286 of numbered combinatorial type @ xmath287 to a train track @ xmath288 of numbered finite type @ xmath266 . this splitting and shifting sequence also contains an infinite sequence @ xmath289 connecting @ xmath110 to @ xmath266 . the subshift of finite type defined by the shift @ xmath268 is _ _ mixing _ if there exists an @ xmat##h276 such that @ xmath280 for all @ xmath284 . the following simple statement will show that the function defined by numbered to and adding to results in is topological mixing . [ mixing ] let @ xmath26 be a unique mixing subshift of finite type for the whole alphabet @ xmath290 and with transition matrix @ xmath268 . if there are @ xmath291 such that @ xmath292 then @ xmath26 is topologically mixing . let @ xmath26 be a unique mixing subshift of finite type for in the alphabet with @ xmath293 - transition matrix @ xmath268 and such that for all @ xmath279 we have @ xmath292 . note to the contrary that @ xmath26 is not topologically mixing . for @ xcite , there is always a number @ xmath294 and there is a partition of the alphabet @ xmath290 into two sets @ xmath295 such that for @ xmath296 we have @ xmath265 . if @ xmath29##7 . let @ xmath279 be as before and let @ xmath298 be such that @ xmath296 where and are equal modulo @ xmath299 . from our matrix @ xmath265 we know that @ xmath297 , on the other hand , follows from @ xmath300 that is @ xmath301 . in other words , @ xmath302 mod @ xmath299 and not @ xmath303 which supports our assumption that the mixture is a topological mixing . this is the proof . [ submix ] the subshift of finite type given by the matrix @ xmath238 of numbered - types of complete numbered train tracks , @ xmath0 is topologically equivalent . by lemma [ mixing ] , it is possible to construct complete numbered combinatorial systems @ xmath284 such that our transition matrix @ xmath268 is @ xmath292 . however , such numbered - types of train tracks are shown in figure 1 below . namely , the train tracks @ xmath304 and @ xmath305 are .shift 0 , and the same is true for the train tracks @ xmath306 and @ xmath307 . to see the proof of the corollary , simply note that any small branch in a complete train track @ xmath58 depends on a switch @ xmath75 with the property that at least one of the branches of @ xmath58 which is large on @ xmath75 and small at @ xmath75 is _ not _ a small branch in the configuration as in figure 1 . in particular , any small branch of a train track in special standard form for some framing of @ xmath0 is incident in such a configuration ( for @ xcite , h06a ) . in this case we extend the subshift of the length @ xmath26 ##0 in section 2 to the extended teichmller configuration . also in section 2 , for @ xmath231 carry to @ xmath66 the unit cone of all measured projections of @ xmath58 . note that @ xmath66 agrees with the cone of all measured geodesic projections which are carried by @ xmath58 . in particular , if @ xmath76 is shift equivalentto @ xmath58 then we assign @ xmath308 . the projectivization of @ xmath66 can also be identified with the set @ xmath309 of all projective measured plane laminations which are generated by @ xmath58 . then @ xmath309 is the _ compact _ subset of the euclidean space @ xmath53 of all projective measured plane laminations on @ xmath0 . if @ xmath310 is any _ preserving and shifting sequence then @ xmath311 and hence @ xmath312 are uniquely defined and non - trivial . then by the definition in section 2 , the element @ xmath270 determines the orbit of the image of @ xmath11 on the space of compact subsets of @ xmath53 . we call the sequence @ xmath270 _ if if _ if @ xmath312 consists of a single _ _ ergodic _ point , whose image @ xmath19 backs onto @ xmath0 and has a _ probability measure up to 1 . let @ xmath313 be the set of all uniquely defined points . we define the sequence@ xmath314 as follows . for @ xmath315 choose a unique integer sequence and shifting to @ xmath272 which realizes @ xmath274 . by the definition of a uniquely ergodic sequence there is a unique non - measured geodesic lamination @ xmath63 which is carried by one of the two sequences @ xmath246 and such that the maximal weight carried by this measured _ lamination on a _ large _ branch of @ xmath286 equals one . note that if @ xmath257 is shift ##able to @ xmath286 , the maximal weight that @ xmath63 disposes on a large branch of @ xmath257 equals one as follows , i . e . this normalization only depends on the mapping class of @ xmath286 . for @ xmath316 , the sequence that the maximal mass that the measured geodesic of @ xmath317 carries on a large branch of @ xmath318 equals one . by equivariance under the action of the mapping class group , the sequence @ xmath319 only depends on the sequence @xmath274 . in other words , @ xmath49 is a function defined by @ xmath320 . we have . [ roofcont ] the function @ xmath314 is defined . first @ xmath315 and then @ xmath321 . from the definition of the function on our metric space it follows to show that there is some @ xmath322 such that @ xmath323 whenever @ xmath324 and such that @ xmath325 for @ xmath326 . for this let @ xmath244 be a numbered - weight and scaling function which contains @ xmath274 . then @ xmath244 defines a maximal weight lamination @ xmath19 which is carried by @ xmath318 and such that the maximal weight which is carried by @ xmath19 on a small branch of @ xmath318 equals 1 . by definition , @ xmath319 equals the value of the maximal weight which is carried by @ xmath19 on a large branch of @ xmath286 . consider the space @ xmath327 of allthe measures for @ xmath318 together with the topology of a set of weights of the branches of @ xmath318 together with a closed cone of the set of all measured geodesic laminations equipped with the weak @ xmath51 topology . thus there is a neighborhood @ xmath122 of @ xmath19 in the interval @ xmath50 of all measured reference points such that for every @ xmath328 the logarithm of the maximal weight of a large branch of @ xmath318 defined by @ xmath329 is contained in the interval @ xmath330 and that the logarithm of the maximal weight that @ xmath329 carries of a large branch of @ xmath286 is contained in the interval @ xmath331 . on the other hand , for every @ xmath332 the set @ xmath333 of all measured reference points which are defined by @ xmath334 is a closed cone in @ xmath50 and @ xmath19 and we have @ xmath335 for @ xmath336 and @ xmat##h337 . as a consequence , there is an @ xmath338 such that @ xmath339 . this means that the value of @ xmath49 on the line with @ xmath320 of the number @ xmath340 for @ xmath341 is contained in @ xmath342 which proves the inequality . the next inequality gives more information about the function @ xmath49 . [ bounded ] 1 . the number @ xmath314 is maximal and is defined from above . 2 . there is a number @ xmath160 such that for every @ xmath315 we have @ xmath343 # . if the value of a given line as measured by @ xmath315 is maximal then @ xmath344 . we want to prove that there is a number @ xmath345 such that @ xmath346 for every @ xmath315 . to prove the first inequality , choose a generating sequence ##ness and shifting sequence @ xmath272 which generates @ xmath274 . we say that @ xmath318 is obtained from @ xmath28##6 defines a new line for each large branch of @ xmath286 . using the above formula , let @ xmath347 be the first ergodic or geodesic split defined by @ xmath244 . then @ xmath347 is defined by one of the branches of @ xmath246 , and the fourth power of a large branch of @ xmath286 for the transverse measure @ xmath63 of @ xmath286 defined by @ xmath347 = 1 . if @ xmath348 is the transverse measure on @ xmath318 defined by the measured line on @ xmath347 , for each large branch @ xmath77 of @ xmath286 we have @ xmath349 where @ xmath80 are the images of the diagonal @ xmath82 of our split in @ xmath318 which are the images of the large branches of the split allows the correct identification of the branches of @ xmath286 with the branches of @ xmath318 . moreover , we have @ xmath350 for each branch @ xmath##351 of @ xmath286 and the corresponding branch of @ xmath352 , and the function @ xmath348 is nonnegative . in particular , the @ xmath348 - weight of the branches of @ xmath318 does not exceed the @ xmath63 - weight of the corresponding branch of @ xmath286 . since for a large branch @ xmath329 on a single train in @ xmath58 the maximum of the @ xmath329 - weights of the branches of @ xmath58 is incident on a small branch @ xcite we know that our function @ xmath49 is non - negative . let @ xmath259 be the corresponding branch in @ xmath286 with @ xmath353 and let @ xmath354 be the branches of @ xmath286 which are incident on the end of @ xmath355 and which are winners of the split . let and @ xmath356 be the corresponding branches of the split , in such a way that the branch @ xmath357 is incident on the same end of @ xmath355 as@ xmath358 . denote by @ xmath359 the branches in @ xmath318 correspond to @ xmath354 . if there is a large branch in @ xmath318 of size n with respect to the measure @ xmath348 then necessarily this branch is among the branches @ xmath360 , but note that @ xmath361 is not a branch . then the @ xmath63 - weight of the branch @ xmath362 is and is @ xmath344 if the weight of the corresponding geodesic lamination @ xmath347 is positive . this is the first statement of our theorem . if @ xmath347 is a well defined measured weight , which fills up @ xmath0 , the subtrack @ xmath363 of @ xmath286 of all branches of the @ xmath63 - weight is _ _ _ , i . e . the complementary branches are either topological discs or weakly punctured topological discs . the product @ xmath362 of @ xmath286 with @ xmath364 is contained in theinterior of a complementary component of @ xmath363 which contains the branches @ xmath365 on its side . by the definition of @ xcite , the number of winning splits of @ xmath286 of this distribution at a large branch contained in the side of a complementary component of @ xmath59 is bounded from above by the number of branches contained in this side . this just means that there is a continuous function @ xmath160 such that @ xmath366 and complete the proof of the first part of our lemma . on the other hand , by the switch rule for transverse measures on a train track @ xmath58 , the maximum of the @ xmath348 - weight of the two large branches @ xmath81 of a split of @ xmath286 at a large branch @ xmath77 is no smaller than half the @ xmath63 - weight of @ xmath77 . since the maximum of the weight of a transverse measure on a large train track @ xmath58 is bounded at a large branch , our distribution @ xmath49 is uniformly distributed . this completes the proof of the theorem . following @ xcite wecall a finite shifting sequence @ xmath367 _ normal _ if for all ( and hence every ) . ##type and shifting sequence @ xmath368 _ @ xmath274 the natural number function @ xmath369 for every branch @ xmath67 of @ xmath288 _ onto _ @ xmath286 . by the definition of @ xmath238 , the lemma [ numberedtype ] and by the considerations in section 2 of @ xcite , tight - fitting sequences exist . call a biinfinite sequence @ xmath370 _ normal _ if a finite shifting sequence exists on @ xmath371 , both in forward and backward order . the following lemma follows from the definition of @ xcite . for this we define a horizontal geodesic lamination @ xmath19 on @ xmath0 to be _ recurrent _ if for one ( and hence every ) teichmller point @ xmath372 given by a linear map with horizontal lamination @ xmath19 there exists a convex subset @ xmath36 of moduli space with the property that the inverse of the projection of @ xmat##h372 to the space with the compact @ xmath36 is defined . by the results of masur @ xcite , a projective lamination is now defined and the support fills up @ xmath0 . we have . [ normal ] let @ xmath270 be normal and let @ xmath373 be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence which contains @ xmath274 ; then @ xmath312 consists of a single recurrent projective - linear map . let @ xmath270 be normal and let @ xmath374 be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence formed by @ xmath274 and the support of a numbered train track @ xmath286 of the - type @ xmath375 . then for each @ xmath110 there is a natural projective linear map @ xmath376 . for @ xcite , this map can be described as follows . let @ xmath377 be the number of points of the complete train track on @ xmath0 . if the train track @ xmath245 is obtained from @ xmath246 by a single step of a .on @ xmath77 . the 2 - lamination @ xmath19 which is represented by @ xmath245 carries both a transverse measure @ xmath378 on @ xmath245 and a transverse measure @ xmath379 on @ xmath246 . if @ xmath81 are the branches of the split from @ xmath246 to @ xmath245 and if @ xmath82 is the diagonal branch of the split , then we have @ xmath380 , i . e . the convex cone @ xmath381 of transverse measures on @ xmath245 is mapped to the convex cone @ xmath382 of transverse measures on @ xmath246 and the product @ xmath383 of the product @ xmath384 - 1 . for every unit vector @ xmath385 on @ xmath386 . define a point on the cone @ xmath387 as a point on @ xmath388 we denote by @ xmath389 the intersection of @ xmath387 with the sphere @ xmath390 . the product @xmath389 can be identified with the projectivization @ xmath391 of @ xmath387 and is homeomorphic to the unit vector in @ xmath392 . for all @ xmath393 the projective linear map @ xmath394 can also be identified with the map @ xmath395 ( see @ xcite ) . the jacobian of this map is bounded from above by one for each point of @ xmath396 @ xcite . from the definition of @ xcite , it is enough to show that there is a number @ xmath397 and there are infinitely many @ xmath266 such that for each of the maps @ xmath398 @ xmath399 which is bounded by the @ xmath400 of @ xmath401 of @ xmath384 - matrices , each column vector is added to every other column vector at most once . namely , in this case the jacobians of the projectivizations of the maps @ xmath402 are bounded from above by a number @ xmath403 which is independent of @ xmath266 . thus the jacobians of the projectivizedtransformations @ xmath404 tend to zero as @ xmath405 depends on @ xmath389 . moreover , the transformations @ xmath406 are all quasiconformal and therefore their pointwise dilatations tend to zero as well ( see @ xcite ) . in particular , the transformation @ xmath407 consists of a single point @ xmath19 . however , for transformation @ xmath110 the point @ xmath19 is contained in the _ branch _ of the _ transformation @ xmath391 and therefore the probability is given by @ xmath19 on @ xmath246 is zero for every point of @ xmath246 ( see the beautiful map of @ xcite ) . now for every unique admissible transformation @ xmath408 and for every numbered splitting and shifting sequence @ xmath409 which realizes @ xmath410 , the transformation @ xmath411 has the same property . as a result , if @ xmath412 is unique and if @ xmath413 is a splitting and shifting sequence which realizes @ xmath414 then @ xmath407 consists of a singleand @ xmath19 . since @ xmath312 contains with every @ xmath415 a projective measured geodesic lamination with the same support , the projective measured _ lamination @ xmath19 is necessarily well defined . we are left with note that it also sums to @ xmath0 . for this call the geodesic point @ xmath19 _ and _ if @ xmath19 is complete and if then @ xmath19 can be approximated in the hausdorff sense by simple measured points . the intersection @ xmath416 of _ measured _ geodesic laminations represented by @ xmath246 is a complete non - empty subset of the euclidean intersection @ xmath417 of all complete geodesic points in @ xmath0 ( and @ xcite ) and since @ xmath418 is non - empty . every projective measured geodesic point whose support is contained in the points from the intersection @ xmath36 is contained in @ xmath312 . since the intersection @ xmath312 consists of the same point @ xmath19 , the laminations from theand @ xmath36 contain a single minimal curve @ xmath419 which is the complement of @ xmath19 . if @ xmath419 does not fill up @ xmath0 then there is a simple closed curve @ xmath79 on @ xmath0 which intersects the simple geodesic lamination @ xmath420 at a finite number of points . by the definition of @ xcite we can construct a sequence @ xmath421 of simple closed curves on @ xmath0 which approximate @ xmath329 in the hausdorff sense such that the intersection and @ xmath422 are bounded from above by a positive integer @ xmath120 . moreover , for every @ xmath332 there is some @ xmath423 such that the train track @ xmath334 intersects the curve @ xmath424 . as a result , there is a linear and shifting sequence from @ xmath334 to the train track @ xmath425 which contains @ xmath424 and a _ vertex cycle _ @ xcite . this means that the distance measure on @ xmath425 defined by a _then @ xmath426 is the extreme ray on the convex hull @ xmath427 of the _ measures on @ xmath425 . let @ xmath84 be the _ line graph _ of @ xmath0 and let @ xmath428 be the map which associates to each _ point of @ xmath429 a point _ of @ xmath59 . it is shown by @ xcite that there is a map @ xmath430 such that the image under @ xmath431 of the splitting and shifting sequence @ xmath432 is an _ unparametrized @ xmath163 - quasi - cone _ of @ xmath84 . this means that there is a nondecreasing map @ xmath433 such that the image @ xmath434 is a _ quasi - cone . since the curve graph is uniform and since the distance in @ xmath84 between the points @ xmath79 and @ xmath424 is uniformly bounded @ xcite , this implies that the image of the image under @ xmath431 of the splitting and shifting sequence @ x##math413 is _ _ _ . however , the support @ xmath270 is normal by definition and thus the sequence @ xmath413 contains points whose support in the support @ xmath61 are unparametrized 3 - geodesics in @ xmath84 with support of arbitrarily small size . this is a contradiction and shows that the support of @ xmath19 fills up @ xmath0 as well . in other words , the set of normal points in @ xmath273 is contained in the support @ xmath320 of all ergodic points . since normal points are contained in @ xmath273 , the same is true for uniquely ergodic points . note from figure 2 that for example @ xmath229 the support @ xmath71 of all tangential points in @ xmath58 can be identified with the cone of all straight line laminations which hit @ xmath58 efficiently . if @ xmath435 is removed from @ xmath229 by a single split of a large branch @ xmath77 and if @ xmath235 is thematrix which describes the transformation @ xmath436 then there is a projective transformation @ xmath437 given by the transposed matrix @ xmath438 . this transformation maps the total measure on @ xmath58 determined by the corresponding projective transformation @ xmath329 hits @ xmath58 efficiently to the corresponding measure on @ xmath76 defined by the same lamination ( which hits @ xmath76 efficiently as well , compare @ xcite ) . denote by @ xmath439 the set of projective measured geodesic laminations which hits @ xmath58 efficiently . as in the case of lemma [ normal ] we have . [ fill ] let @ xmath270 be normal and let @ xmath272 be a numbered splitting and counting sequence which hits @ xmath274 ; then @ xmath440 consists of a single uniquely defined projective measured geodesic sequence which makes up @ xmath0 . we call the transformation @ xmath270 _ _ uniquely _ _ if @ xmath274 is not normal as defined , and if , for one ( and( 2 ) numbered splitting and shifting sequence @ xmath441 which realizes @ xmath274 the intersection @ xmath442 consists of a unique point . by lemma [ fill ] and theorem [ 2 ] , every normal sequence is also uniquely ergodic and hence the borel set @ xmath443 of all the uniquely ergodic sequences @ xmath270 is dense . moreover , for every numbered intersection @ xmath444 and every numbered splitting and shifting sequence @ xmath272 which realizes @ xmath274 there is a unique set @ xmath445 of well - defined geodesic points which make up @ xmath0 and which satisfy the following two requirements . 1 . @ xmath347 is hit by each of the train tracks @ xmath246 and the total area disposed by @ xmath347 is the maximal neighborhood of @ xmath286 . 2 . @ xmath446 hits each of the train tracks @ xmath246 twice . 3 . @ xmath447 . in particular , by equivariance under the action of the mapping class of ,the point @ xmath444 determines a partial differential of total area one for a point in moduli space . let @ xmath448 be the set of total area one partial differentials whose horizontal and vertical coordinate systems are both purely ergodic and look for @ xmath0 . then @ xmath449 is the @ xmath5 - the borel analog of @ xmath4 . the _ _ _ for the point @ xmath278 on the set @ xmath450 of all doubly invariant periodic functions in the hilbert space @ xmath273 with the function @ xmath451 identifies the point @ xmath452 \ mid ( x _ 1 ) \ mid { { \ mathcal { i } } { \ mathcal { i } } } \ } / \ sim $ ] where the linear relation @ xmath453 identifies the point @ xmath454 with the function @ xmath455 . there is a linear flow @ xmath118 and @ xmath27 ##8 in @ xmath456 ( for @ xmath128 ) where @ xmath32##2 . such that @ xmath457 . the _ semi - conjugacy _ of @ xmath458 into a continuous map @ xmath459 is a ( continuous ) map @ xmath460 such that @ xmath461 for all @ xmath462 and none @ xmath463 . we have a semi - conjugacy @ xmath28 _ one - to - one _ if the preimage of a point is at most one . as an immediate consequence of , [ bounded ] we have .

[ shortcurves ] let @ xmath444 and let @ xmath272 be a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes @ xmath274 . let @ xmath473 and let @ xmath474 be a subset of @ xmath15 ##5 and @ xmath244 . then there is a vertex cycle on @ xmath286 of a given @ xmath475 - length . let @ xmath444 and let @ xmath272 be a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes @ xmat##h274 . let @ xmath445 be the number of distinct measured geodesic points which is defined by the lift @ xmath475 of @ xmath476 which is determined by @ xmath244 . by definition , the maximal weight that is defined by @ xmath477 on a compact subset of @ xmath286 is one and hence the maximal weight of the transverse measure on @ xmath286 defined by @ xmath347 is uniformly bounded . then by definition 2 . 3 of @ xcite , the intersection number between @ xmath347 and any vertex cycle of @ xmath286 is uniformly bounded . from the definition of @ xcite , the number of vertex cycles for a complete circular graph @ xmath58 is uniformly bounded . since the decomposition @ xmath66 of transverse measures on @ xmath58 is spanned by the vertex cycles , there is a decomposition @ xmath478 where @ xmath479 and @ xmath480 are the vertex cycles of @ xmath286 . now the number of vertex cycles is uniformly bounded and hence we have @ xmath481 for a completeone @ xmath321 and at least one @ xmath110 . then the probability that the tangential measure @ xmath446 disposes on the branch @ xmath67 as in the image of @ xmath480 is bounded from above by @ xmath482 . since a periodic cycle passes through any branch of @ xmath286 at most once @ xcite , the intersection @ xmath483 is bounded from above by . the total weight of the intersection @ xmath446 on the branches of @ xmath286 in the image of @ xmath480 . so @ xmath484 and so in our image of @ xmath480 this total weight is uniformly bounded . but this implies that @ xmath485 is uniformly bounded and by the theorem . now let @ xmath486 be a fixed point for the teichmller differential equation . then @ xmath487 as is well defined and therefore there is some @ xmath444 such that the action of the linear flow of @ xmath15 is given by the self - conjugacy @ xmath28 onto the@ xmath5 - orbit of @ xmath15 . since our self - conjugacy @ xmath28 is one - to - one this orbit of the periodic flow may not be unique . thus we have . [ closedorbit ] let @ xmath444 be a point which is mapped by @ xmath28 to a periodic orbit of the teichmller flow . then the complement of the set @ xmath488 is contained in @ xmath464 . the result is a consequence of the previous observation about the piecewise linear space defined by the linear differential @ xmath489 and its relation to the preimages of @ xmath15 and @ xmath273 . for this find @ xmath444 and find @ xmath490 . let @ xmath272 be a linear splitting and averaging point which contains @ xmath274 and let @ xmath474 be the orbit of @ xmath15 defined by @ xmath244 . let @ xmath466 be the measured geodesic space defined by the quadratic differential @ xmath475 . then the total measure that@ xmath347 implies that a small branch of @ xmath286 is empty . by lemma [ 1 ] we prove that there is a constant @ xmath160 such that @ xmath491 . we claim that there is a constant @ xmath263 only contained in @ xmath15 such that @ xmath492 for a small branch @ xmath493 , and that @ xmath494 for large @ xmath264 . let @ xmath495 be the subgraph of @ xmath286 of all vertices whose weight with respect to the constant @ xmath63 given by @ xmath347 is at least @ xmath496 . it follows from the statement in the proof of theorem [ bounded ] that @ xmath59 has a lower closed bound @ xmath79 . moreover , the @ xmath63 - weight of every branch @ xmath497 which is incident to a switch at @ xmath79 and which is not contained in @ xmath79 is equal to zero . by the considerations in section 1 . 2 of @ xcite , thisnote that @ xmath498 is very small ( centered on @ xmath157 ) . so if @ xmath329 is the tangential point of @ xmath286 given by the vertical - geodesic intersection of @ xmath15 and @ xmath499 and then @ xmath500 is uniformly bounded . as a consequence , the @ xmath15 - length of @ xmath79 is uniformly bounded , and @ xmath501 is very small . since the measured vertical distances @ xmath466 cancel out @ xmath0 there is a unique point @ xmath463 such that @ xmath79 is _ balanced _ with respect to @ xmath502 . this means that the orbits of @ xmath503 conicide and are not less than those of the @ xmath502 - length of @ xmath79 . in other words , if @ xmath504 is balanced then the intersection for all @ xmath463 of the @ xmath502 - length of @ xmath79 is very small . on the other hand , if the orbit of@ xmath15 under the teichmller geodesic it is periodic . for sufficiently small @ xmath321 it does not intersect the boundary of teichmller space of all metrics whose systole is smaller than @ xmath157 . if then the @ xmath502 - length of a simple closed curve on @ xmath0 is also independent from and independent of @ xmath505 . this proves our claim . let @ xmath428 be a map which associates to a single cycle point on @ xmath0 all of its generating sets . by our above consideration and the results from @ xcite , the assignment @ xmath506 is an @ xmath507 - sub - geodesic for each @ xmath508 depending only on @ xmath15 . however , this implies that there is a constant @ xmath509 such that for each @ xmath266 the assignment @ xmath510 has the following properties . let each @ xmath244 be a finite numbered splitting and shifting map which realizes @ xmath274 . then for each @ xmath46 , the map realizes @ x##math511 and @ xmath512 in @ xmath84 is at least one . now there are only finitely many full - splitting and finite sequences of in @ xmath513 with this property . in fact , by the statement in the proof of lemma [ 1 ] , there is a universal sequence @ xmath468 with the same property . let @ xmath514 be any such that and let @ xmath329 be _ any _ measured geodesic , which is defined on @ xmath288 and such that the maximal weight obtained by @ xmath329 on a small branch of @ xmath58 equals one . then the maximal weight obtained by @ xmath329 on a large branch of @ xmath286 is at least @ xmath515 . this also means that the sequence @ xmath49 is bounded from zero on @ xmath488 by a positive integer and that therefore the assignment @ xmath516 is a finite half - order on @ xmath84 . as a consequence , the sequence @ xmath517 is contained in a finite subset of @ xmath46##4 . this shows the lemma . masur and veech @ xcite constructed a probability measure with the lebesgue measure class on the space @ xmath4 of non - quadratic functions in moduli space . this measure is stable , stable and mixing to the teichmller measure @ xmath5 , and it gives full measure to the space of linear differentials whose horizontal and vertical measured convex laminations are uniquely ergodic and mixed up @ xmath0 . moreover , the measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the strong stable and the unstable foliation . in this section we use the results from section 5 to construct an uncountable family of @ xmath5 - invariant probability measures on @ xmath4 with the lebesgue measure which gives full measure to the space of linear functions with uniquely ergodic horizontal and vertical measured convex projections . these measures are stable and mixing , with a recurrence to a locally compact set , and they are absolutely continuous with respect to the strong stable and the unstable foliation . this is the result of theorem 1 from the introduction . we start with an important observation on @ xmath5 -invariant probability measure on @ xmath4 . [ finiteinv ] let @ xmath63 be an @ xmath5 - invariant borel probability measure on @ xmath4 . then @ xmath518 . since @ xmath519 is a @ xmath5 - invariant borel subset of @ xmath4 it is enough to show that there is an @ xmath5 - invariant borel probability measure @ xmath63 on @ xmath4 with @ xmath520 . for this assume to the extent that such a subset exists . suppose that @ xmath4 can be written as a countable union of compact sets and hence there is some compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 with @ xmath521 . then by a theorem of masur @ xcite , for every @ xmath522 there is a subset @ xmath523 such that @ xmath524 for every @ xmath525 . the above probability measure on @ xmath526 can be shown to be invariant . then there is another @ xmath25 such that @ xmath527 . thus ,##variance of @ xmath63 under the teichmller flow we have @ xmath528 and therefore @ xmath529 which is a map . the lemma holds . recall from section i the image of the semi - conjugacy @ xmath28 from our subshift of the set @ xmath26 with inclusion of @ xmath49 onto the @ xmath5 - invariant set @ xmath449 . since the mapping of @ xmath49 onto @ xmath530 is uniformly distributed and strictly invariant , the @ xmath278 - invariant borel invariant measure on @ xmath273 which gives full mass to @ xmath464 defines a unique invariant measure for the @ xmath49 - suspension of . the variance of this measure under the semi - conjugacy @ xmath28 is a unique @ xmath5 - invariant borel measure on @ xmath4 which we may take to give full mass to . this means that the map @ xmath28 is a map @ xmath531 from the set @ xmath532 of @ xmath278 - invariant .##l probability measures on @ xmath273 which give full mass to @ xmath464 into the space @ xmath533 of @ xmath5 - invariant probability measures on @ xmath4 . we equip both spaces with the weak @ xmath51 - topology . we have . [ continuous ] the map @ xmath531 is dense . since @ xmath273 is a locally metrizable space , the set of all probability measures on @ xmath273 is compact . so we only need to say that whenever @ xmath534 in @ xmath532 then @ xmath535 . but this also means that for every continuous function @ xmath536 in @ xmath4 we have @ xmath537 which is obvious since @ xmath28 is continuous . we also have . [ continuous ] the image of @ xmath531 is compact . there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of all locally defined @ xmath11 - invariant borel measures and the image @ xmath538 which give full mass to the set of all @ x measures and the set of all @xmath5 - invariant finite borel measures in @ xmath4 . since every closed teichmller flow gives rise to such a measure which is a sum of dirac measures supported on the endpoints of the lifts of the teichmller flow to teichmller space . then the pair of measures is the pair in @ xmath538 which consists of the horizontal and the vertical projective measured point components of the linear differential defining the lift of the closed teichmller flow to teichmller space . since the set of endpoints of teichmller flow are known to be contained in @ xmath538 the set of @ xmath5 - invariant borel probability measures which can be represented by the point measure on closed sets is contained in @ xmath533 . as a result , it is enough to show that every measure @ xmath539 which is supported on a single measured point is contained in the lift of @ xmath531 . to show that this is not the case , let @ xmath15 be a fixed point for the teichmller flow . up to .@ xmath15 by the image under the 1 - @ xmath505 - form of the map for the set @ xmath505 , we can show that there is some @ xmath444 with @ xmath540 . denote the defined by @ xmath458 the continuous measure defined by the support of @ xmath49 . for @ xmath25 and @ xmath541 where by way of notation we define @ xmath274 by a point in @ xmath27 . by lemma [ closedorbit ] , the support of these measures are only contained in a closed open subset of @ xmath464 , not as a subset of @ xmath27 . thus there is a point @ xmath542 close to 0 such that the measures @ xmath543 map as @ xmath405 weakly to a @ xmath118 - continuous measure @ xmath63 . however , it follows directly from the discussion in the form of lemma [ closedorbit ] that the support of @ xmath63 is contained in the preimage of the closed set @ xmath15 under the map @ x##math28 . 1 @ xmath544 has a borel probability measure _ @ xmath4 which is given by the @ xmath5 - value of @ xmath15 . this is the proof . let @ xmath264 be the size of the matrix @ xmath238 of the ##type , defined in lemma [ numberedtype ] and let @ xmath545 be an @ xmath293 - matrix with non - negative entries @ xmath546 such that @ xmath547 if and only if @ xmath548 ( where the matrix @ xmath268 is defined in the paragraph above in [ 1 ] ) . we require that @ xmath549 is _ positive _ , i . e . that @ xmath550 for all @ xmath110 . by corollary [ submix ] and the following , there is a matrix @ xmath551 such that @ xmath552 . then by the perron frobenius theorem , there is a unique positive _ definite measure _ @ xmath553 with @ xmath554 and such that @xmath555 by our definition . taking the density of @ xmath163 together with the normal distribution @ xmath252 gives a new probability measure @ xmath329 for the subshift @ xmath26 of finite size which is invariant under the shift and gives full measure to the set of normal points . the @ xmath329 - mass of the shift @ xmath556 @ xmath557 equals @ xmath558 , and the @ xmath329 - mass of @ xmath559 equals @ xmath560 . note that the measure @ xmath561 for all @ xmath266 is equal to that of @ xmath329 under the shift . since in the [ submix ] our distribution @ xmath26 is strongly mixing , the shift @ xmath562 is equivalent to a bernoulli distribution ( see fig . 79 of @ xcite ) . in particular , it is invariant and strongly mixing , with finite number of correlations , and it gives full measure to the set @ xmath563 of normal points . we call ashift - invariant measure on @ xmath273 of this is a _ _ measure _ . the support of the probability measure @ xmath63 on @ xmath273 is independent of @ xmath273 , and @ xmath63 is finite and invariant under the action of the shift @ xmath278 . the completion @ xmath118 of the borel measure @ xmath27 with roof function @ xmath49 defined in dimension 4 preserves the borel measure @ xmath564 given by @ xmath565 where @ xmath566 is the lebesgue measure on the real lines of our flow . since by lemma [ semi ] the roof function @ xmath49 on @ xmath567 is finite , the completion @ xmath564 is finite and moreover ergodic under the action of the flow @ xmath118 . the pull - down @ xmath568 of the completion @ xmath564 by the semi - conjugacy @ xmath28 ##8 in corollary [ semi ] is a complete @ xmath5 - invariant measure .for @ xmath4 which gives full support to the quadratic differentials with uniquely defined horizontal and vertical measured line laminations which fill up @ xmath0 . we define its dual to a - measure for @ xmath4 a _ _ _ _ for the teichmller continuous flow @ xmath5 . by definition , a bernoulli measure for @ xmath5 is absolutely continuous with respect to the strong contraction and the unstable contraction .

necessarily ) homeomorphic to @ xmath573 by taking the borel map which associatesto a pair of transverse projective - geodesic flows on @ xmath574 a map on the teichmller geodesic determined by the pair and defines this map in such a way that it commutes with the natural @ xmath575 - invariant . with this map , the teichmller - flow acts on @ xmath573 via @ xmath576 . in particular , there is a projective orbit space projection @ xmath577 which is equivariant with respect to the diagonal action of the mapping class g on @ xmath578 and the diagonal action of @ xmath11 on @ xmath579 . let @ xmath63 be the projective measure for the teichmller geodesic flow . then @ xmath63 lifts to an @ xmath5 - invariant @ xmath11 - invariant projective measure on @ xmath10 , and this projective measure disintegrates to a projective measure @ xmath580 on @ xmath581 which is invariant under the diagonal action of @ xmath11 and which gives full rise to the projective measure @xmath582 . since @ xmath63 is continuous under the teichmller geodesic action , the measure @ xmath583 is ergodic under the action of @ xmath11 . note to the contrary that the measure @ xmath63 is not continuous . suppose there is a continuous function @ xmath234 on @ xmath4 with compact support and @ xmath584 so that @ xmath585 does not map weakly to such as @ xmath586 . we define @ xcite and assume that there is a non -

space and that the function @ xmath590 to @ xmath10 of the same measure is well defined and continuous on the set of @ xmath59##1 . the measures of the function @ xmath590 define a closed @ xmath11 - th subgroup of @ xmath592 into the set of closed subgroups of @ xmath575 which is used for multiplication . since @ xmath593 by definition , the measure @ xmath594 where this measure is of the form @ xmath595 for some @ xmath596 is the period . the radon measure @ xmath580 on @ xmath581 is absolutely continuous with respect to the projective foliation of @ xmath597 . this implies that @ xmath580 is locally of the form @ xmath598 where @ xmath599 is a measure on the set of projective measured point laminations whose measure class is closed under the action of @ xmath11 and where @ xmath536 is a finite probability measure . since the action of @ xmath11 on @ xmath53 is finite , the measures @ xmath600 are of full length . consider the projective measured point lamination of a probability measure for the function @ xmath6##3 on @ xmath4 is uniquely ergodic and fills in @ xmath0 and , if @ xmath601 has typical values for @ xmath63 on the same strong stable manifold in @ xmath4 and @ xmath602 for a different choice of the distance function @ xmath29 and @ xmath4 @ xcite . from properties of the function @ xmath234 and the continuity of @ xmath63 with respect to the strong stable and the stable , we conclude that @ xmath603 . similarly we argue for the strong stable manifold ( see the # ##ness of this function in @ xcite ) . as a consequence , there is an @ xmath11 - mass set @ xmath604 of full @ xmath583 - mass such that for every @ xmath605 and every @ xmath606 the function @ xmath590 is defined almost everywhere along the strong stable manifold @ xmath17 and along the strong unstable manifold @ xmath102 . so in @ xcite we define @ xmath607 with absolute continuity , the function @ xmath60##8 . full ##ness with respect to @ xmath580 . choose a density class @ xmath609 for @ xmath580 and for @ xmath610 be measured convex neighborhoods of @ xmath611 and @ xmath53 with the property that for every @ xmath612 and every @ xmath613 the projective ##ly convex neighborhood @ xmath614 will fill in @ xmath0 . these neighborhoods are well known to exist . then the class @ xmath615 determines a unique teichmller geodesic . # ##talk _ of @ xmath616 as well . choose a projective class @ xmath13 whose horizontal measured geodesic intersection @ xmath347 is in the class @ xmath617 and whose horizontal measured geodesic lamination @ xmath446 is in the class @ xmath618 . for @ xmath613 , the class @ xmath619 determines a teichmller geodesic whose corresponding one - parameter class of partial squares intersects @ xmath17 creating a new class @ xmath620 .similarly , the family of ordinary differentials defined by the pair @ xmath621 intersects @ xmath622 in a unique point @ xmath623 , the family of quadratic differential defined by the pair @ xmath624 intersects @ xmath625 in a unique point @ xmath626 , and finally the family of quadratic differentials defined by @ xmath627 intersects @ xmath628 in a unique point @ xmath629 . the value @ xmath630 does not depend on the value of the first differential @ xmath15 at the point @ xmath627 the resulting function @ xmath631 is continuous and satisfies @ xmath632 . recall that there is a canonical action of the function @ xmath633 on @ xmath10 where the identity action of @ xmath633 acts on the teichmller geodesic flow . the @ xmath633 - orbit can naturally and equivariantly be identified with the unit vector space of the hyperbolic plane , with its canonical actions and isometries . in particular , for every @ xmath6##34 the orbit through @ xmath177 of the unipotent subgroup of @ xmath633 of all upper triangular matrices of trace two defines an embedded line segment @ xmath635 , and the orbit through @ xmath177 of the unipotent subgroup of all upper triangular matrices of trace two is contained in @ xmath636 . thus the @ xmath633 - form of the above quadratic form @ xmath15 defines two embedded line segments @ xmath637 containing @ xmath611 in their center such that the restriction of the function @ xmath59 to @ xmath638 coincides with the restriction of the usual dynamical inner product on the space @ xmath639 of embedded lines in the hyperbolic plane . in particular , the restriction of the function @ xmath59 to @ xmath638 is not constant in any neighborhood of @ xmath627 . on the other hand , if we write @ xmath640 and @ xmath641 are contained in @ xmath610 . since our function @ xmath59 is continuous and not constant in any neighborhood of @ x##math627 we know that for every @ xmath321 there are points @ xmath642 such that @ xmath643 . however , given our definition of @ xmath644 , the function @ xmath590 is continuous on the points @ xmath645 and @ xmath628 and not @ xmath646 . in other words , the function @ xmath590 has infinitely large periods which is a contradiction to our statement that the sum of periods of @ xmath590 equals @ xmath595 for some @ xmath596 . this completes the proof of our theorem . we also obtain a measure of the return ##time to a randomly chosen compact subset of @ xmath4 for a given line of the teichmller - space @ xmath5 on @ xmath4 which is typical for a compact measure @ xmath63 on @ xmath4 . the following result is a consequence of theorem 1 . 1 of @ xcite for all bernoulli flows ( see also @ xcite ) . [ returntime ] there exists a compact measure @ xmath36of @ xmath4 and for every transverse measure @ xmath63 for the teichmller geodesic flow @ xmath5 there is a sequence @ xmath647 and a sequence @ xmath648 such that @ xmath649 , \ epsilon ^ sq \ not \ in k \ } \ leq k ^ { - \ epsilon \ } . \ ] ] let @ xmath650 be an infinite sequence with the additional property that there is an @ xmath651 such that the sequences @ xmath652 and @ xmath653 are both finite . by lemma 5 . 1 of @ xcite there is a compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 such that for every straight line and a sequence @ xmath654 which defines @ xmath650 the following holds . let @ xmath655 be a straight line lamination which is defined by @ xmath656 and which defines a transverse measure of @ xmath286 for which the sum of the squares of the large components of @ xmath286 is finite . let @ xmath657 be ameasured mixed measure which maps @ xmath286 efficiently and so that @ xmath658 . then the quadratic differential @ xmath659 with horizontal measured geodesic lamination @ xmath19 and vertical measured geodesic lamination @ xmath329 is contained in the map of @ xmath36 to @ xmath10 . let @ xmath63 be the mixed measure on the shift space @ xmath26 . then @ xmath63 is uniformly mixing and so there are solutions @ xmath660 such that @ xmath661 . the corollary above follows from this definition and the observation that the transfer function @ xmath49 and @ xmath567 which is our borel suspension which is semi - invariant to the teichmller metric is uniformly bounded . we end this section with a description of the @ xmath11 - and @ xmath5 - mixed measure @ xmath19 and the lebesgue equivalence relation of the principal bundle bundle @ xmath10 of teichmller space which is invariant to the natural transformation of the metric @ xmath##633 and which projects to a probability measure on @ xmath4 . this measure induces an @ xmath11 - 1 probability measure @ xmath20 and @ xmath662 . using the definition from theorem 4 , let @ xmath238 be the collection of all possible combinatorial types as per lemma 3 . 2 . for each @ xmath663 , a numbered train track @ xmath664 of the type @ xmath266 . let @ xmath665 be the space of all projective measured geodesic surfaces which are measured by @ xmath664 and let @ xmath666 be the space of all projective measured smooth surfaces which measure @ xmath664 efficiently . suppose that @ xmath667 is closed convex hull of @ xmath53 with dense intersection . define the _ full ##ness _ of @ xmath664 to be a numbered train track @ xmath59 which can be obtained from @ xmath664 by splitting @ xmath664 at each large branch exactly once . since splitting at all large branches of @ xmath664similarly , the numbering of the branches of @ xmath664 is a numbering of the branches of @ xmath59 . so the train tracks @ xmath668 obtained from @ xmath664 in the full decomposition are equivalent . we obtain a decomposition @ xmath669 into borel sets @ xmath670 where @ xmath671 consists of the intersection of all projective measured geodesic points which are carried by @ xmath672 ( @ xmath673 ) . for @ xmath674 the intersection @ xmath675 is contained in the hyperplane of @ xmath53 ( with respect to the natural piecewise linear map which preserves the lebesgue measure of ) and hence it has vanishing lebesgue measure . if @ xmath676 is the intersection point of the corresponding train track @ xmath672 then define @ xmath677 and define @ xmath678 for @ xmath679 . note that we have @ xmath680 for both @ xmath64 and @ xmath681 . the followingof the space @ xmath20 under the action of the mapping class group , the measures @ xmath682 and depend on the combinatorial type @ xmath663 and the class of a measure is the smallest mapping class of @ xmath266 . consider the random walk on the space @ xmath683 of finite - type defined by the @ xmath11 - invariant transition probabilities @ xmath549 . it follows from our previous consideration that the exit measure of this random walk can be taken as a probability measure on @ xmath53 ##8 the lebesgue measure class . by invariance under the action of the mapping class group , the - invariant measure @ xmath63 on the subshift @ xmath684 of finite type with alphabet @ xmath238 and transition matrix defined by the above definition , is contained in the lebesgue measure class . thus the measure on @ xmath538 defined by the biinfinite random walk with the above transition matrix agrees with @ xmath20 up to scale . we use this observation to give a new ( and simpler ) proof of theorem 2 . 1of @ xcite and of the infinite sequence of @ xcite . [ $ ] let @ xmath19 be the @ xmath5 - invariant probability measure on @ xmath4 of the lebesgue measure class . there is a finite sequence @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 and a number @ xmath321 such that @ xmath685 for every @ xmath686 \ } \ leq t ^ { - \ le t } / \ epsilon . $ ] even though a priori it is not clear whether our subshift of finite ##ness is topologically equivalent ( or locally transitive ) , we can take the same form as above . now , since each of the ergodic minimal and the measured splitting ##s has full lebesgue measure , there is a finite sequence @ xmath687 with @ xmath688 for every @ xmath110 and there is a number @ xmath551 such that for every such splitting and the sequence @ xmath654 which realizes @ xmath414 in the above sense , the sequences @ xmath689 and @ xmath690 are equivalent .the proof described above is 5 . 2 . as in the proof of section 5 . 2 , from this statement the following follows ( see also the proof at @ xcite ) . in this section we derive the first statement of theorem c from the proof . first , we assume that the critical exponent of the equivalence class c is @ xmath6 . for the proof of this result we need to use the assumptions and assumptions from section 2 - 6 . in particular , we denote by @ xmath29 the teichmller series on @ xmath9 . consider the number @ xmath30 . the poincar series at @ xmath33 with exponent @ xmath31 is defined to be the series @ xmath34 the critical exponent of @ xmath11 is the infimum of the coefficients @ xmath35 such that the poincar series with coefficients @ xmath32 is . note that this critical factor does not depend on the value of @ xmath33 . we first give a lower bound for this critical exponent . [ 2 ] the poincar series diverges at the number @ xmath691 . thus @ x##math692 be a unique recurrent point for the teichmller geodesic , and let @ xmath693 be a lift of @ xmath694 . denoting x by @ xmath695 the canonical projection , we can show that @ xmath696 is not generated by any nontrivial element of @ xmath11 . in fact , there is a point @ xmath37 such that the images of the elements of @ xmath11 of the circle of radius @ xmath697 about @ xmath33 are pairwise equivalent . using the notations from section 3 . 3 of @ xcite and its proof , let @ xmath698 be the set of all projective measured line segments which have a minimal sublamination which makes up @ xmath0 . let @ xmath148 be the gromov projection of the le graph . . then there is a unique continuous , surjective and closed map @ xmath699 . for @ xmath13 let @ xmath700 be the image under the projection @ xmath701 of the le##besgue ##d @ xmath702 is the only unstable class @ xmath102 . let @ xmath703 be the preimage under @ xmath704 of the subset @ xmath705 of the recurrent projective - plane laminations denoted by @ xmath694 . by this we show that for @ xmath706 the class @ xmath694 is contained in the @ xmath707 - the set of the projection to @ xmath4 of a straight line of the teichmller plane with line segments contained in the subset @ xmath329 . for @ xmath115 and @ xmath708 denoted by @ xmath709 the class @ xmath710 - limit of radius @ xmath90 to @ xmath711 we show in section 3 . 2 of @ xcite that there is a neighborhood @ xmath712 and there is an open neighborhood @ xmath122 of @ xmath713 to @ xmath10 with the following properties . 1 . the projection of @ xmath122 to @ xmath9 ##2 .consider the case of radius @ xmath39 about @ xmath714 . 2 . there is a number @ xmath120 such that for each @ xmath715 we have @ xmath716 . the family @ xmath717 of all sets @ xmath718 for each @ xmath719 is a vitali family for @ xmath720 . by the proof of theorem 3 . 2 of @ xcite , there is an open relative normal subset @ xmath721 of @ xmath722 with the property that @ xmath723 is an open neighborhood of @ xmath724 in @ xmath150 . let @ xmath31 be the radius of the intersection of @ xmath721 to @ xmath9 . ( 2 ) above there is a natural number @ xmath725 such that the sets @ xmath726 @ xmath727 are pairwise equivalent , are all in @ xmath728 and in @ xmath720 - almost all of @ xmath728 . moreover , for each @ xmath110 there is a@ xmath729 and then @ xmath730 so that @ xmath731 . ( 2 ) above we have @ xmath732 , and 1 ) this implies that @ xmath733 . from this , with the product operator for the measures @ xmath702 and the application of the teichmller operator we obtain with @ xmath691 that @ xmath734 where @ xmath735 is a positive constant . let @ xmath736 . since the two sets @ xmath737 @ xmath727 are pairwise , by definition , the measure @ xmath738 is contained in at most one of these sets . as a result , the measure @ xmath739 has a covering relation for @ xmath235 which is defined at the point of @ xmath235 . using again section 2 . 2 of @ xcite and the definition , this covering relation becomes the vitali relation for the measure @ xmath720 . in particular , we can define a countable subset @ xmath740 @ xmath741 ##0 , such that the measure @ xmat##h742 is pairwise independent , and contained in @ xmath728 and in @ xmath720 - is independent of @ xmath728 . convergence to @ xmath743 implies that @ xmath744 inductively we have that @ xmath745 for every @ xmath746 . in other words , the poincar series diverges from the exponent @ xmath141 . with the above method we obtain . [ 2 ] for every @ xmath321 the poincar series terminates at @ xmath747 . for @ xmath30 let @ xmath748 be the set of all the ##al complex numbers which converge to @ xmath33 . the sets @ xmath749 @ xmath750 are a subset of @ xmath10 of each @ xmath751 , and the same is true for the sets @ xmath752 for every set @ xmath128 . let @ xmath753 be the conformal group of dimension @ xmath754 , the lebesgue measure space . for @ xmath##13 and for @ xmath746 and @ xmath755 . let @ xmath30 be a point which is not covered by a nontrivial expansion of @ xmath11 . there is a number @ xmath37 such that the sets under the action of @ xmath11 of the balls of radius @ xmath756 and @ xmath33 are pairwise equivalent . for @ xmath757 and @ xmath746 let @ xmath758 be the set of all points @ xmath759 which project into the same ball of radius @ xmath39 about @ xmath33 . for continuity and compactness , for a large @ xmath760 , and for all @ xmath761 , and for all @ xmath757 the @ xmath762 - expansion of @ xmath763 is given from below by a universal constant @ xmath468 ( compare the examples in the appendix of section 3 . 2 of @ xcite ) . for an infinite @ xmath263 let @ xmath764 . we say that there is a constant @ xmat##h22 such that for every @ xmath765 the projection of the set @ xmath766 is given from to by @ xmath767 . then for every @ xmath321 we have @ xmath768 which proves our lemma . to prove our theorem , let @ xmath769 , let @ xmath770 and let @ xmath771 . then moreover @ xmath772 be such that @ xmath773 . we say that if @ xmath774 then the sets @ xmath775 and @ xmath776 are equivalent . to prove this implies that . since the projection of the set @ xmath704 to @ xmath749 is a homeomorphism , it is also a natural map @ xmath777 with @ xmath778 . let @ xmath779 and let we take @ xmath780 and let @ xmath781 . by our definition of @ xmath39 , this implies that @ xmath782 . the @ xmath7##83 - mass of the set @ xmath784 is bounded from below by @ xmath67 and hence by the definition of the set @ xmath762 the @ xmath785 - mass of @ xmath784 is bounded from below by @ xmath786 . since by our above definition the sets @ xmath775 @ xmath787 are pairwise independent , their size does not exceed a finite number times @ xmath788 . from this our first definition and hence the results are obtained . as an immediate corollary of formula [ converge ] and lemma [ converge ] we have . [ converge ] the critical exponent of @ xmath11 is @ xmath6 . by formula [ diverge ] , the poincar series of @ xmath11 converge at @ xmath691 and hence the critical value of @ xmath11 is much greater than @ xmath141 . on the other hand , formula [ converge ] shows that for all @ xmath321 the poincar series converge at @ xmath747and so the absolute value is much less that @ xmath747 . so the theorem holds . * remark : * shortly after this proof was published , a preprint of athreya , bufetov , eskin and mirzakhani @ xcite appeared which gave precise asymptotics for the poincar flow . for @ xmath37 let @ xmath41 be the number of periodic orbits for the teichmller flow on @ xmath4 of period at most @ xmath39 . veech @ xcite proved that there exists a number @ xmath42 such that @ xmath789 . similarly , for @ xmath37 and every compact subset @ xmath790 let @ xmath38 be the cardinality of the set of all periodic orbits for the teichmller geodesic flow of period at most @ xmath39 which intersect @ xmath36 . using the definition of @ xcite , if @ xmath47 then for every compact subset @ xmath790 and every sufficiently large @ xmath39 we have @ xmath791 . the first proposition is the first statement of theorem .from the figure ( see also @ xcite for a related definition ) . for this we denote by @ xmath792 the tangent space of @ xmath0 . choose the map @ xmath61 for @ xmath0 and let @ xmath796 ##1 the collection of all train tracks in standard form for @ xmath61 . take @ xmath797 and assume that there is a constant @ xmath263 such that every single train track on @ xmath0 has a distance at most @ xmath264 from a train track of the form @ xmath798 = the _ train _ complex _ of @ xmath0 ( see @ xcite for the definition of the train track complex and its basic properties ) . take from figure 3 the definition of the map @ xmath799 . there is a constant @ xmath800 such that @ xmath801 for all @ xmath802 ( where we denote by @ xmath29 the distance from the train track complex as well as the distance in @ xmath9 , see @ xcite and figure 3 . 4 ) . theorem .@ xmath59 is located in the @ xmath11 - orbit of @ xmath805 . @ xmath805 can be connected to @ xmath59 by a splitting and shifting sequence . the distance in the real track space between @ xmath59 and @ xmath419 is given from above by @ xmath79 . as a consequence , there is a number @ xmath508 with the following properties . let @ xmath806 ; then there is an @ xmath807 with @ xmath808 and there is a train track @ xmath809 in standard form for @ xmath61 which can be connected to the train track @ xmath810 by a splitting and shifting sequence . write @ xmath811 and for each @ xmath812 choose a tight splitting and shifting sequence connecting @ xmath246 to the train track @ xmath813 for some @ xmath814 ; then a sequence appears in @ xcite and # 2 ( see @ xcite and the section before section 4 . 6 for the definition of a splitting sequence ) . for @ xmath806 ;a splitting and shifting sequence connecting @ xmath815 to @ xmath816 is the splitting and shifting sequence connecting @ xmath817 to @ xmath818 . then the distance between @ xmath819 and @ xmath820 is bounded from above by the universal constant . moreover , by the definition of @ xcite , the projection @ xmath821 is pseudo - anosov and whose axis projects through a maximal compact neighborhood of @ xmath822 . in other words , there is a universal constant @ xmath648 and for each @ xmath806 there is a pseudo - anosov element @ xmath823 with @ xmath824 whose axis projects to a maximal neighborhood @ xmath372 in the euclidean space with the following properties . let @ xmath827 be the preimage of @ xmath826 and the projection @ xmath828 . since by definition [ diverge ] the poincar series diverges at the exponent @ xmath6 and since then the number of elements @ xmath829 with @ xmath830 is bounded from above .a positive constant . depending on @ xmath45 , our above proof shows that @ xmath831 . we are left with so that @ xmath832 for any compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 . for this let @ xmath833 be any compact subset of @ xmath834 with compact interior and let @ xmath835 be a very small fundamental domain for the action of @ xmath11 on the subset @ xmath836 of @ xmath833 . let @ xmath113 be the axis of @ xmath837 . let @ xmath838 be a point which is not covered by any element of @ xmath11 . let @ xmath806 be a pseudo - anosov line whose axis corresponds to a small point @ xmath372 in the space which intersects @ xmath833 . then there is a point @ xmath839 which lies on the axis of the conjugate of @ xmath45 which we denote it by @ xmath45 for this . given the choice of the axis , the point @ xmath840 ofour closed point @ xmath372 is @ xmath841 . on the other hand , we define @ xmath842 by the choice of @ xmath113 and the choice of @ xmath843 . therefore , if we define by @ xmath21 the preimage of @ xmath844 under the natural numbers and if we define @ xmath845 for @ xmath37 to be the set of all @ xmath806 with @ xmath846 , then we have @ xmath847 since by the [ definition ] the central point of the poincar series is @ xmath6 , we have that @ xmath848 as well . for a , @ xmath849 for @ xmath850 to be the length of the smallest periodic point on the complex plane @ xmath33 . for a periodic geodesic @ xmath851 \ to { \ rm ##a } ( [ ) $ ] [ @ xmath852 \ } $ ] . we have . let @ xmath708 be sufficiently small that for a is global .@ xmath141 intersects @ xmath0 of constant length and every - geodesic @ xmath79 for the metric @ xmath141 of length at most @ xmath90 , the area of every - @ xmath141 - geodesic which intersects @ xmath79 nontrivially is smaller than @ xmath855 . via the appropriate choice of the metric @ xmath151 and the application of the lemma , it is possible to solve the case for closed curves @ xmath372 in euclidean space with @ xmath856 . now let @ xmath851 \ to { \ rm _ } ( x ) $ ] be such a closed curve parametrized proportional to its length . via reparametrization , suppose that @ xmath857 . let @ xmath858 be a tangent of @ xmath372 to @ xmath9 which is the axis of the pseudo - anosov curve @ xmath806 and let @ xmath79 be an essential - closed curve on @ xmath859 of length @ xmath856 .we assume that the length of the [ arc @ xmath860 $ ] is at least @ xmath861 . however , the formula @ xmath862 which assigns to @ xmath463 the length @ xmath863 of the geodesic representative of the simple closed curve @ xmath79 with respect to the euclidean structure @ xmath864 is valid , and the choice of its logarithm does not change the length of the tangent bundle of @ xmath865 ( or @ xcite ) . so if the length of @ xmath860 $ ] is greater than @ xmath866 , the length of the arc @ xmath79 with respect to the euclidean structure @ xmath867 is less than @ xmath90 for @ xmath868 . by our choice of @ xmath90 , for each @ xmath513 there are at most @ xmath87 for simple closed curves of and at most @ xmath90 for the euclidean structure @ xmath867 . moreover , since for each @ xmath110 the length of @ xmat##h869 since the compact subset @ xmath870 contains @ xmath871 , the length of @ xmath872 on @ xmath873 does not exceed @ xmath90 . as a consequence , there is some @ xmath874 such that the curves @ xmath79 and @ xmath872 coincide . this contradicts the fact that @ xmath45 is pseudo - anosov . the proof follows . for @ xmath31 let @ xmath876 denote the set of all hyperbolic points on @ xmath0 up to infinity whose dimension is at most @ xmath32 , i . e . @ xmath876 is the dimension of the curve @ xmath877 ##4 in figure 1 . by definition [ compactret ] , there is a number @ xmath321 such that for every compact subset @ xmath372 in the space of length at most @ xmath39 there is a point @ xmath878 whose distance to @ xmath372 is no less than @ xmath8##79 . namely , that @ xmath138 can be lifted to @ xmath159 with a translation of distance at most @ xmath880 where @ xmath648 is a positive constant ( or @ xcite ) . let @ xmath746 be the point of @ xmath881 . for @ xmath882 there is a translation @ xmath865 of @ xmath372 to @ xmath9 which passes through a point @ xmath176 of distance at most @ xmath883 to @ xmath33 . let @ xmath806 be the pseudo - anosov element of @ xmath865 which is @ xmath372 . we then fix @ xmath884 and then our corollary follows from proposition [ counting ] and proposition [ compactret ] . to this , we reduce the counting problem for finite sets in euclidean space to the counting problem for pseudo - anosov elements with finite translation length in the euclidean space . for this we fix again a point @ xmath30 . [ counting ] for every @ xmath321there is a metric @ xmath885 with the following properties . let @ xmath30 and let @ xmath372 be a closed geodesic in moduli space of length @ xmath840 . let @ xmath886 be the conjugacy class of @ xmath11 defined by @ xmath372 . if @ xmath806 is such that @ xmath887 = @ xmath888 . let @ xmath889 and let @ xmath372 be a closed metric in the space of length @ xmath840 . let @ xmath890 be sufficiently long that no two simple closed curves with respect to a simple closed metric of finite length and @ xmath0 of length at least @ xmath90 can intersect . let @ xmath891 be the smallest subset of the space of all such curves whose length is at least @ xmath90 . let @ xmath30 be a metric which projects to a point in @ xmath36 and let @ xmath892 be such that @ xmath##893 . suppose that @ xmath372 is parametrized in such a way that @ xmath857 . by the triangle inequality and the choice of @ xmath45 , there is an element @ xmath120 not defined on @ xmath372 and an element @ xmath892 such that with @ xmath894 we have @ xmath895 . then if @ xmath896 , we have @ xmath897 . let @ xmath79 be a curve of length @ xmath871 on @ xmath859 . with @ xmath708 as input , let @ xmath898 be the smallest integer such that the value of @ xmath79 on @ xmath899 is @ xmath90 ; then @ xmath900 . by our choice of @ xmath871 , there is a curve @ xmath901 on @ xmath902 of length at most @ xmath871 , and this curve is not different from @ xmath79 . as a result ,we have @ xmath903 in the curve graph @ xmath84 . we take this consideration as well . let @ xmath904 be the smallest number such that the distance of @ xmath901 to @ xmath905 is at most @ xmath90 . as such , we have @ xmath906 . then after @ xmath907 steps we have a number @ xmath908 on @ xmath909 whose distance to @ xmath79 in the curve graph is at most @ xmath264 and whose distance to @ xmath910 is at most one . from this the lemma follows . [ conjug ] for every @ xmath321 there is a number @ xmath911 with the same property . let @ xmath912 be the set of conjugacy classes of pseudo - anosov numbers whose maximum length in the curve graph is at most @ xmath913 . for @ xmath37 let @ xmath914 be the set of such elements in @ xmath915 which correspond to the geodesics in the space of length at most @xmath39 ; # @ xmath916 r . green , d . epstein , m . epstein , _ notes on notes of thurston _ , in ` ` algebraic and geometric aspects of euclidean geometry ' ' , edited by d . epstein , cambridge math . lecture notes 111 , cambridge university press , cambridge 1987 . m . hamenstdt , _ c _ and the gromov boundary of the domain of c _ , in ` ` representations of kleinian groups ' ' ( m . minsky , m . sakuma , trans . , , eds . ) , cambridge math . notes 329 ( 2006 ) , 187207 .
