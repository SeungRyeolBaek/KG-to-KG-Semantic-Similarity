there is evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) over a range of distances ; smbhs with clusters @ xmath3 m @ xmath1 are ubiquitous in large galaxy bulges ( e . g . magorrian et al . 1998 : ferrarese 2002 ) , and the smbhs powering them [ which have been observed at distances as high as @ xmath4 ( fan et al . 2001 ; fan et al . 2003 ) ] are estimated to cluster to @ xmath5 m @ xmath1 ( see e . g . shields et al . evidence for the frequent formation of smbhs , when observed within a hierarchical cosmology , suggests that smbh formation may be a random event . if this is the case , the gravitational waves ( gws ) generated during smbh coalescence are a prime candidate for observation by the _ laser _ space telescope _ ( lisa , folkner et al . 1998 ; flanagan & smith 1998 ; flanagan et al . 2001 ) . estimates of the smbh formation rate depend crucially on the relative fraction of smbhs in halos , and also on the adopted mechanisms for the formation andgrowth of smbhs . within the typical cdm model , both proposed smbh growth models [ in which a large population of smbhs formed via fusion and / or merging ( eg . volonteri et al . 2003 ) ] and ongoing growth models [ where smbhs formed simultaneously with those in halos ( eg . kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) ] are consistent with the present - day ubiquity of smbhs in galactic clusters ( menou et al . 2001 ) . the formation of a smbh may be restricted to potential wells above a certain depth . if not , then there exists a high halo virial temperature ( @ xmath6 ) below which a halo can potentially host smbh formation . if @ xmath6 is high ( eg . @ xmath7 k ) , the smbhs are found in galaxy clusters , and the event rates are in the range of 100 events per year ( wyithe & loeb 2003 ; haehnelt 2004 ) . this event rate would be much lower , less than 10 per year , if @ xmath8 k and smbhs form only at the centres of massive stars( haehnelt 2004 ) . hence the event rate has the potential to increase the observed smbh rate [ with the important exception of the unknown number of binary black hole ( bbh ) mergers , see [ snr ] ] . the number of mergers detected by lisa depends on the form of the gw signal and the instrument ##ed ##r curve . previous estimates of the event rate have used averaged ( rather than time - averaged ) gw signals to determine the detection criteria ( wyithe & loeb 2003 ) and have estimated the number of detectable mergers by comparing the sensitivity curve with the observed gravitational wave background due to the bbhs ( sesana et al . ) sesana et al . ( 2004b ) calculate the lisa event rate for a hierarchical statistical model for smbh mergers . we perform the first empirically motivated calculation for the lisa event rate of smbh mergers in a hierarchical model that uses the signal to noise ratio ( snrs ) to determine detection criteria . in [ snr ] we describe the calculation of snrs for the lisa rate of bbh mergers . in [ merger ] we describe our calculation of the smbh merger rate , calculate our lisa merger rate predictions , andfor the relative fraction of smbhs in halos and the @ xmath9 @ xmath10 ) . finally , we make our event horizon predictions as a function of @ xmath6 ( [ cl ] ) before concluding with [ concl ] . throughout this work we use @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 km s @ xmath15 mpc @ xmath16 km s @ xmath15 mpc @ xmath15 , @ xmath17 and the primordial decay curve with slope @ xmath18 as measured by the _ _ _ _ experiment _ ( wmap , spergel et al . the speed with which bbhs decay is highly variable . first , the smbhs slow down toward the centre of the galactic halo due to negative feedback from the dark matter background until they form a bound state ( begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ) . the efficiency of this process depends on the internal configuration of the individual dark matter halos ( van den berg et al . 1999 ; colpi , rossi & governato 1999 ) . as the initial state ( @ xmath19) decreases , three - body interactions with stars that are within @ xmath20 of the bbh centre of mass ( the ` ` loss cone ' ' ) may dominate the energy loss . depending on the physical parameters of the binary and the observed population of stars , this interaction may result in a hard [ stellar velocity ( @ xmath21 ) @ xmath22 stellar velocity ratio ( @ xmath23 ) ] binary system . if this continues until the binary , where energy losses are reduced by gws , the binary will collapse . yu ( 2002 ) suggests that the mechanism of bbh coalescence depends on the time - scale for bbh formation during the hard binary stage . during this stage , three - body interactions between the bbh and other stars force stars into highly elliptical orbits , lowering the inner orbital radius and causing the binary ( eg . volonteri et al . the effect of the hard process is caused by the preferential depletion of energy in the loss cone ( regions of free energy where angular momentum is low enough that stars pass through the bbh ) , resulting in a population of stars that can extract energy from the binary system ( see yu 2002 ) . uncertaintieshowever the efficiency of cooling which may produce loss cone stars makes this model difficult to test . n - body star migration is expected to result in some diffusion of ice back into the loss cone ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) but it is unlikely that this process alone can support ice hardening . some n - body simulations have been used to include the effect of the bbh expansion within the gravitational field ( due to two - body resonance with neptune ) , which reduces the effective temperature of the loss cone and may prevent the expansion from occurring ( quinlan & hernquist 1997 ; milosavljevi ' s & merritt 2001 ; chatterjee , hernquist & merritt 2003 ) . other scenarios which may aid expansion of the bbh into the gw dominated system have been proposed , including the effects of gaseous disks ( wang & rix 2000 ) , circular or triaxial temperature distributions ( yu 2002 ) and cooling of a large smbh ( rees & rees 1992 ) . the effect of bbh expansion is of particular concern for lisa detection ##s . whilst undoubtably still an open question , we note that there are several ways to extract the required energy from the binary system . for the purposes of our study ( [ 1] ) we can assume that hardening of the system to the gw energy limit occurs with an accuracy ( @ xmath24 ) of unity . the event models quoted in this article are equivalent to @ xmath24 . the gravitational wave dominated phase of bbh ##b can be divided into three distinct phases ( brown 2002 ) . the process begins in the _ inspiral phase _ , with the smbhs gradually spiralling into tighter orbits due to the adiabatic expansion of gw energy . eventually the dynamics become increasingly unstable and the smbhs violently merge to form a single object ( _ merger phase _ ) . the resulting gw signal can be analyzed by treating the merged system as a single kerr smbh ( _ ringdown phase _ ) . the dynamics of the inspiral and ringdown phases are well understood and the waveforms for the gws have been derived . however , many aspects of the ringdown solution depend on unknown parameters of the merger phase and cannot be determined from the results of computer simulations ( see [ ringdown ] ) . detection of gws from a distant galactic source can be complicated by the presence of galactic and sub - galactic gw signals , and by lisa ##s sensitivity to gwsfrom all three directions . matched filter detection searches will not be able to determine the gw ##b from the observation . ( hughes et al . 2001 ) . the snr for a matched filter detection ( @ xmath25 ) is defined as the ratio of the resulting input strain and spectral powers : @ xmath26 where @ xmath27 is the fourier transform of the dimensionless strain and @ xmath28 is the spectral power of the noise . we calculate snrs for the peak phase ( or the peak phase ) of the inspiral signal . the average duration of the ringdown phase is no more than 1 year and we therefore calculate ringdown snrs for the peak phase . estimates of lisa - noise sensitivity are available with plans for the next upgrade . a recently suggested sensitivity estimate ( bender 2003 ) has a ( dimensionless ) strain sensitivity [ defined as @ xmath29 , for @ xmath30 and 1 year of observation ] with a minimum frequency power - law slope of @ xmath31 for frequencies of between @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 khz , and a power - law slope of @ xmath34 for frequencies of @ xmath35 to @ xmath32j . flanagan ( 2003 ) found a hard - frequency cut off at @ xmath36 hz , approximately equal to the maximum resolvable frequency for a year long mission . lisa will be sensitive to frequencies up to @ xmath37 hz . as a general rule @ xmath38 is required for the accurate detection of the signal ( hughes et al . 2001 ) . as the effective radius of the source increases , both the direction and magnitude of the inspiralling strain increase . to calculate accurate inspiral phase snrs , it is necessary to consider the time dependence of the strain in the ratio of signal to noise . we achieve this using the technique developed by flanagan & hughes ( 1998 , and fh98 ) . fh98 shows that the mean phase snr ( @ xmath39 can be re - expressed in terms of the emitted gw ) is @ xmath40 @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 is the magnitude of the gw . this is related to the observed gw spectrum ( @ xmath43 ) via the cosmological model of the source [ @ xmath44 . the inspiral phase curve may be directly calculated to first order fromthe quadrupole is for the gravitational wave : ( fh98 ) @ xmath45 where @ xmath9 and @ xmath46 are the two bbh frequencies corresponding to the reduced mass @ xmath47 and full mass @ xmath48 . numerical simulations of bbh frequencies show that this approximation is correct until @ xmath43 hz @ xmath49 hz ( fh98 ) which roughly corresponds to the observed frequency when equal mass bbhs have an angular separation of two schwarzchild radii ( @ xmath50 ) . this frequency forms the upper limit of z - equation ( [ z _ z _ snr ] ) . since the gw frequency of bbh coalescence typically increases with mass , this frequency can be used to delineate the inspiral and merger phases . the average gw frequency of the inspiral phase at the initial frequency @ xmath51 corresponding to the merger phase is given by ( fh98 ) @ xmath52 ^ { 1 / 3 } [ ^ { \ , } . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] depending on the signal strength , @ xmath53 may fall below the lisa waveband . wewe consider the values of @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 as the upper limit of strain in time ( [ t _ z _ snr ] ) . we use the method described by hughes ( 2002 ) to calculate snrs for the ringdown phase . bbh relaxation is predicted to occur in a rotating smbh with a bar - like shape of the event horizon ( hughes 2002 ) . this variant of the kerr model can be explained by the bar - like [ @ xmath56 quasi - ] mode ( kokkotas & schmidt 1999 ) . the corresponding time dependent strain is described by an exponential expanding function with the ( initial ) strain ( @ xmath57 ) whose value depends on the fraction of the bbh mass - energy ( @ xmath58 ) radiated during the ringdown phase ( @ xmath59 ) , the binary energy , and the energy fraction of the total energy ( @ xmath60 ) . the expression is @ xmath61 ^ 2 , \ ] ] where @ xmath62 is the comoving distance to the nucleus at time @ xmath63 . the quality factor ( @ xmath64 ) is proportional tothe # - ##ing of the gw signal ( @ xmath65 ) is @ xmath66 . the second term of the ( [ - ] ) accounts for the reduced signal amplitude for the observed bbh signal ( fh98 ) . computer simulations show that @ xmath67 ( baker 2001 ; fh98 and discussed below ) . we use @ xmath68 . note that the distribution of the phase of signal ( @ xmath69 ) is that of the inspiral signal , the dependence of @ xmath70 and @ xmath71 on the distribution of the observed angular - momentum ( @ xmath72 ) and the velocity [ @ xmath73 ] is by ( baker , holtz & smith 2002 ) @ xmath74 where @ xmath75 ; \ \ \ nonumber \ mathcal { a } _ { \ rm } & = & - [ \ mathcal { a } _ { \ rm rd } ( \ hat { l } . \ hat { r } ) , \ hat { n } \ ] ] @ xmath76 is the observed ringdown gw signal and @ x##math77 ##8 the peak strain . thorne ( 1985 ) , echeverria ( 1989 ) and recently holtz & hughes ( 2002 ) have produced numerical values for @ xmath78 and @ xmath64 in terms of @ xmath79 and @ xmath60 : @ xmath80 , \ ] ] @ xmath81 which are equal to @ xmath82 per sample . hughes & blandford ( 2003 ) note that the value of @ xmath60 will depend on the role that smbh energy plays in smbh evolution . we follow hughes ( 2002 ) and calculate @ xmath83 . the peak strain [ @ xmath84 ] the magnitude of the strain in each sample weighted by the initial strain response factor [ @ xmath85 ; thorne 1987 ] for a source with polarisation axes separated by an angle @ xmath86 to @ xmath87 @ xmath88 for @ xmath89 , the quality factor is negative and most of the energy radiated during the ringdown phase is radiated during the next ringdown phase ( @ xmath90 ) . in this case the snr can be calculated##d . ( hughes 2002 ) @ xmath91 for comparison with the sky ##ward inspiral snr we calculate the snr by solving ( [ r _ snr ] ) for the selected components of @ xmath92 . a large bbh will produce gws at lower frequencies and for a very high frequency the ringdown signal is at a lower frequency [ see also ( [ f _ oneyr ] ) & ( [ rd _ fits1 ] ) ] . even if the light curve has a high frequency fall off and / or degrades rapidly with time , searches for the ringdown signal will find more massive bbhs . we find that ringdown signal can produce coalescence between bhs with frequencies up to @ xmath93 m @ xmath1 ( @ xmath94 ( @ xmath1 ) ) @ xmath95 ( @ xmath96 ) . in the left hand panel of the [ snr _ table ] we display the snr for the inspiral ( _ line - _ line _ ) and ringdown ( _ dashed line _ ) components of each component , @ xmath95 bbh coalescence as a result of single scattering is. the right hand figure shows the ratio of ringdown to inspiral snrs , with the lower region denoting the mass range in which the ringdown signal is detected . the snr is lower than the ringdown signal for @ xmath97 at @ xmath1 . we note that there is a range of smbh masses ( @ xmath98 m @ xmath1 at @ xmath99 ) for which bbh ##f is observed only in the ringdown phase . since characteristic masses decay with @ xmath100 , this mass range decreases with redshift . by @ xmath101 , the mass range is comparable to the highest smbh mass known for the local region ( @ xmath102 at @ xmath1 ) . these results are consistent with the observation of fh98 and support the idea that searches for background noise from the ringdown signal may show dependence on the low frequency smbh signal . the low frequency of the ringdown signal from smbh binaries offers limited advantage for their detection if the low frequency signal has a power - loss slope of @ xmath103 and a sharp cut - off ( corresponding to the above .of constant accelerometer background noise , see white 2002 ) . however , it is expected that time with removal of spurious noise will result in a steeper low - noise sensitivity . ( white 2003 ) . in addition to the instrumental noise , the gws from certain types of binary systems are expected to affect lisa s sensitivity ( see sesana et al . however , sesana et al . ( 2004b ) found that bbh coalescence only affects the sky noise above the threshold of @ xmath104 hz , and this threshold is about an order of magnitude lower than the observed lisa s . thus the observed bbh background should not significantly affect lisa s due to supermassive bbh coalescence . estimates of the merger rate of dark matter halos are provided by the standard einstein - schechter ( 1974 ) formalism ( lacey & cole 1993 ) . we denote the merger rate per halo of mass @ xmath105 per unit time with halo of mass between @ xmath106 and @ xmath107 by @ xmath108 . the local ( full - sky ) merger rate of smbh mergers ( @ xmath109 ) is above the redshiftinterval ( @ xmath110 ) can be calculated ( e . g . wyithe & smith 2003 ) by integrating the halo merger rate ( @ xmath111 ) over the press - schechter dark matter halo mass function ( @ xmath112 ) as follows : @ xmath113 where @ xmath114 is the comoving volume per unit solid volume of @ xmath63 and @ xmath115 and the rate @ xmath116 accounts for time - dilation . the product of the two smbh mass functions [ @ xmath117 ] the central smbh merger corresponds to the halo merger rate . interval ( [ x _ time ] ) has the following important properties . we consider the observationally the effect of smbh merger on the halo mass [ @ xmath118 , denoted [ mbh _ reln ] ] . the merger rate @ xmath109 is weighted by the rate for formation of the central smbh coalescence , at @ xmath119 , where the rate @ xmath120 is . in calculation of the snr @ xmath121 we exclude halo mergers where the ratethe radiation takes longer than the hubble distance to sink to the centre of the halo bulge , since the bbh will still have time to decay . this is achieved by limiting the merger rate only to halo galaxies with aspect ratios greater than 3 ( colpi , wilson & governato 1999 ) . we predict efficient decay of smbh ##s in halo galaxies , extending our prediction of the coalescence to a maximum . the merger rate increases with the number of bbhs that evolve into the gw ##h system ( @ xmath24 ) . we also assume it to be constant . this last assumption may affect the size distribution of our event counts ( although this distribution may be small , see sesana et al . 2004a ) , and should have no effect on estimates of the total event rate . shields et al . ( 2003 ) investigated the strength of the relationship between @ xmath9 and the velocity distribution of the halo bulge ( @ xmath124 ) compared to @ xmath125 using a sample of radio - frequency agn . they found no evidence for deviation from the more stable model ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt 2000 ) @ xmath126 ferrarese( 2002 ) showing that the velocity distribution of the local galactic halo varies with the radial motion of the equatorial plane of the galactic disk . @ xmath127 , finding that @ xmath128 . 2 that there is an error in the @ xmath124 @ xmath129 formula , and relating @ xmath129 to the virial ##isation of a virialised halo of . @ xmath105 @ xmath130 ^ { 5 / 2 } \ \ & \ \ & \ \ ( \ frac { n + 1 } { 1 } \ right ) ^ { 5 / 2 } { \ rm kms } ^ { - 1 } , \ _ { 1 } \ ] ] [ where @ xmath131 , @ xmath132 and @ xmath133 are the overdensity of a virialised halo of . @ xmath63 ] we can calculate the value of @ xmath9 @ xmath10 ##5 ( corresponding to the radial velocity from ferrarese 2002 ) @ xmath135 ^ { 5 / 2 } . \ ] ] the @ xmat##h9 @ xmath10 relationship has been observed specifically for halo ##s in the galaxy @ xmath136 ( ferrarese 2002 ) . comparisons to pre - separation distributions [ porciani & madau 2000 ; kochanek & smith 2001 ; kw2001 ] and simple models for halo formation ( white et al . 2000 ; kw2001 ) show that galaxies with @ xmath137 m @ xmath1 tend to form clusters and clusters of galaxies . this may increase the number of more massive smbhs relative to the number of active dark matter galaxies . in addition , effects from radiation from the igm , and also from massive stellar winds are likely to inhibit starformation in active galactic halos ( see barkana & smith 2001 and discussed below ) , and may also inhibit smbh formation . in the next section , we present an observationally significant smbh occupation rate ( @ xmath138 ) that partially accounts for these effects . a model which assumes that all dark - matter galaxies contain smbhs ( e . g . wyithe & loeb 2003 ) may also increase the smbh formation rate . if we assume that all darkgas in halos with virial temperatures greater than a certain value has a central smbh [ with mass determined by the @ xmath9 @ xmath10 ##5 , 5 ( [ mbh - mhalo ] ) ] . we estimate the minimum size fraction of dark - matter gas in @ xmath139 by comparing the observed velocity distribution of the galaxies with a density function that is derived from the press - schechter g - function , and which yields a relationship between the baryonic and virial temperatures ( the [ p _ vel ] ) . judging by the rate of decay of the velocity correlation between @ xmath9 and the velocity distribution of the host galaxies , we assume that the fraction of galaxies of radius ( @ xmath105 ) and mass ( @ xmath63 ) that have a central smbh is determined by @ xmath140 instead of redshift [ ie . @ xmath141 . measurements of the circular motion of galaxies and the dynamics of the stars in the inner regions of the halo where the velocity profile differs significantly from the one obtained by navarro , frenk & colleagues ( nfw ,1997 ) for cdm . most molecular dynamics models predict the effect of adiabatic cooling of baryons on the radial density and velocity profiles of galaxies but neglect changes due to starformation . the cooling and condensation of the halo s baryonic component into a weakly interacting disk changes the radial density profile , resulting in a higher peak circular velocity ( @ xmath142 ) than predicted by the original model ( dalcanton , spergel & wang 1997 ; chen , chen & wang 1998 ; gonzalez et al . 2000 ; kw2001 ) . to model the modified radial density profile , mo et al . ( 1998 ) assumed that the baryonic and dark matter components are almost uniformly distributed in the nfw ##f profile with density parameter @ xmath143 , density parameter @ xmath77 and specific angular momentum @ xmath144 . the peak circular velocity of the modified density profile can be determined by - - - adjusting ( with angular momentum and density constant ) for the scale factor of the exponential function . for a disk with specific angular momentum equal to that of the original disk , the cooled halo is related to the virial velocity by ( mo et al . 1998 ) @ xmath##145 numerical n - body simulations of the halo models suggest the halo molecular spin to be approximately independent of halo mass and equal to at @ xmath146 ( bullock et al . furthermore , the concentration parameter of the nfw ##f can be related to the halo virial mass @ xmath147 ( at @ xmath139 ) and @ xmath148 ( bullock et al . we consider the fraction of halo mass in the cooled disk to be @ xmath149 , independent of halo mass . the cooled particle fraction is thought to be higher for more massive stars ( @ kw2001 ) , but we note that allowing @ xmath150 to take over halo mass as predicted by the halo mass of kw2001 has little effect on the value of the adiabatically cooled velocity function . the halo cooling velocity function may also be computed from the psmf by the substitution of the @ xmath151 for a cooled particle fraction ( @ xmath150 ) that is independent of mass , this prescription results in the @ xmath152 dependence of cooling velocity on halo mass for @ xmath153 m @ xmath154 m @ xmath1. therefore , the net effect of this halo gas model is to translate ( and re - calculate ) the young - schechter estimate of the virial velocity . to calculate our occupation fraction we assume that there is a circular velocity for which we have an occupation fraction of unity . we then use the ( linear ) relationship between halo and virial velocity that enforces this assumption . we have adopted the standard mass density function used by kw2001 for this purpose . kw2001 provide estimates down to @ xmath155 , and @ xmath15 . from this we start with a single power of @ xmath156 with @ xmath157 ( allowing for a closed curve with front - end radius @ xmath158 ) . this then produces the overall cooled velocity ( @ xmath142 ) which , at the expense of the occupation fraction , is consistent with the velocity calculated using the method of smith et al . ( 1998 ) to be @ xmath159 per second . thus , our relationship is consistent with the ratio of @ xmath160 measured from weak lensing studies ( seljak 2002 ) . the overall occupation fraction ( see also [fig2 ] ) peaks in @ xmath161 km s @ xmath15 ( @ xmath162 km s @ xmath15 ) . this galaxy density is also consistent with the circular ##ity with which press - schechter and other galaxy density models agree in the works by gonzalez et al . ( 2000 ) and kw2001 . van den bosch et al . ( 2002 ) provide an estimate of the dependence of galaxy formation efficiency on host halo size via the host halo mass - to - light ratio . this quantity can be determined by observing halo mass - distribution functions and the relationship between ( luminosity and ) observed halo - mass # ##s and mass - ratios for galactic galaxy clusters ( see van den bosch et al . their calculation of a maximum mass - to - light ratio ( independent of the galaxy formation efficiency ) for dark matter starting with @ xmath163 m @ xmath1 , which is comparable to the peak of @ xmath164 at @ xmath165 m @ xmath1 . the occupation fraction decreases rapidly for cooled masses greater than @ xmath166 km s @ xmath15 . we note that errors in @xmath138 km and @ xmath140 will not effect our predicted values , due to the exponential tail of the psmf . however wyithe & smith ( 2003 ) found that both a lower cut - off to @ xmath138 and a virial temperature of @ xmath167 k and @ xmath15 had no impact on their predictions . prior to the reionisation of the igm , halos required a virial temperature higher than @ xmath168 k for the halo gas to cool via nuclear hydrogen fusion for a short time . after reionisation of the halo , the high fusion temperature inhibited the accretion of matter into halos with virial temperatures lower than @ xmath169 k . these virial temperatures determine the initial temperature of the halo out of which the smbh may form ( e . g . barkana & smith 2001 ) @ xmath170 ^ { - 1 . 5 } \ \ \ right \ left [ \ frac { \ omega _ m } { \ omega _ m ^ z } \ frac { \ delta _ c } { { \ delta ^ z } \ right ] ^ { -1 / 2 } \ left ( \ frac { 1 + 1 } { 1 } \ right ) ^ { - 1 / 2 } , \ end { 1 } \ ] ] equivalently , the minimum virial temperature is the minimum depth for the potential energy ( or mass , or both ) of a galaxy in which a smbh may exist . using the @ xmath9 @ xmath10 model , the ( [ mvir ] ) defines a minimum smbh mass ( @ xmath171 ) which is independent of redshift . for @ xmath172 m ( @ xmath173 k ) this minimum smbh mass corresponds to @ xmath174 m @ xmath1 ( @ xmath175 m @ xmath1 ) . in fact , the highest possible number of smbhs occurs in more distant galaxies with virial temperatures greater than @ xmath176 k , although this lower limit may be partially attributable to the difficulties in constructing dynamical models for galaxies with @ xmath177 ( e . g . kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . the observed event rates are shown in figure [ fig3 ] as a function ofthe minimum virial mass ( lower axis ) and minimum smbh mass ( upper axis ) . the event rates per year decline with increasing @ xmath6 . for @ xmath178 and ( @ xmath179 ) @ xmath180 we expect @ xmath181 detections per year in each of the ringdown and inspiral regions . these predictions are well below those of wyithe & wilson ( 2003 ) , with the decline due to our use of the smbh occupation fraction in the event rate . our smbh occupation fraction and other design criteria result in signals that decay more rapidly with increasing @ xmath6 than the values expected . smbhs powering bright quasars are @ xmath182 = @ xmath183 m @ xmath1 . if @ xmath184 = @ xmath185 the predicted event - rates are very low ; falling towards @ xmath186 yr @ xmath15 for each year . hence lisa does not detect signals from the closest clusters of bright quasar hosts . however , there is evidence for smbhs as small as @ xmath0 m @ x##math1 for large stellar bulges ( ferrarese 2002 ) and low - mass , low - redshift agn ( lee & ho 2004 ) . a reasonable value for the minimum smbh temperature is therefore @ xmath187 m @ xmath1 , which corresponds to predictions of @ xmath188 m per year for this model . figure [ fig4 ] shows the redshift rate of events as a function of the minimum virial temperature . most of the events originate at @ xmath189 due to formation of stars more massive than @ xmath190 m @ xmath1 . sesana et al . ( 2004a & b ) provide predictions for the detection rate of inspiral wind bbh events for a seeded smbh growth model ; the @ xmath191 ` ` bursts ' ' in 10 years of time correspond to events at @ xmath192 . this model is a specific model for the formation and evolution of bbhs embedded in an underlying stellar envelope . sesana et al . ( 2004a ) apply the seeded smbh growth model of volonteri et al . ( 2003 ) in which ( 1 ) stellar mass ;##hs form in @ xmath193 and in @ xmath194 and occurs via fusion and coalescence during major galaxy mergers . since we now rely on the merger rate of dark matter particles for the calculation of our coalescence rate , our calculation proceeds by using empirically motivated estimates for the number of smbhs in halos . we do not assume the physics leading to the formation of galaxies ( and by extension smbhs ) in large and dense clusters , however we have assumed that the density of the galaxy clusters directly affects the merger rate . we have observed an incomplete population of smbh binaries , and sesana et al . ( 2004a ) propose a simplified model for binary mergers that results in some stars being ejected from the galactic disk ( where they do not coalesce ) . we estimate an upper limit for the rate of supermassive bbh mergers ( where the binary members weigh less than @ xmath195 m @ xmath1 ) of @ xmath196 yr @ xmath15 , which is larger than , but comparable to , the @ xmath197 m @ xmath15 calculated by sesana et al . 2004a& b for the system with a star larger than @ xmath195 m @ xmath1 . if intermediate mass black holes exist , then our estimate for the lisa detection rate increases only slightly [ due to the low occupation rate for intermediate mass stars ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) ] to @ xmath22 billion per year ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . we have predicted the snr of both the inspiral and ringdown signals of smbh ##s , and the mass and redshift ranges over which bbh signals can be detectable by lisa . the higher resolution of the ringdown signal allows detection of the coalescence of more massive binary systems . in addition , searches for gravitational waves for the ringdown signal provide a superior resolution of bbh signals for smbhs which are more massive than @ xmath198 m @ xmath1 , and allow confident detection of the coalescence of smbhs in the mass range @ xmath98 m @ xmath1 at @ xmath95 should they exist ( or @ xmath199 m @ xmath1 at @ xmath96 ) . we have predicted the rateof the black hole clusters detectable by lisa , a hierarchical cosmology in which black holes form in regions with virial temperature above a critical value and obey an observationally motivated model with constant mass and redshift of the scale @ xmath200 . guided by the observation that the masses of both large and small galaxies fall short of the expected size of dark - matter galaxies , we estimate the expected galaxy velocity fraction . this is done by comparing the currently observed galaxy velocity function with the modified press - schechter ( 1974 ) velocity function . our predicted detection rate declines rapidly with the estimates for the smallest smbh that can occur . if we are guided by the smallest halo bh , inferred from local galaxy bulges and nearby low - mass agn ( @ xmath201 , @ xmath1 ) , then we expect @ xmath188 detections per year . most of these galaxies will be detected via both their final - stage inspiral and ringdown signals . our observationally motivated estimates for the expected rate of bbh formation also suggest that observations of the bbhs are a promising prospect for lisa . the authors wish to include david smith , andrew melatos andavi thanks for your assistance during the development of this project . sesana , m . , haardt , m . , madau , m . , & volonteri , m . 2004b , apj , 253 ( astro - ph / 0409255 ) smith , d . j . , gebhardt , m . , salviander , m . , smith , d . j . , xie , y . , brotherton , d . j . , wang , y . , & wang , m . 2003 , apj , 583 , 124
