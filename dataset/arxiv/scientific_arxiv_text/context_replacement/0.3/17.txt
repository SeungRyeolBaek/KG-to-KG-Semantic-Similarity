excitons in semiconductors have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies of bose gases . low - energy exciton - exciton interactions are described by the exciton - exciton scattering length , @ xmath5 , which determines the temperature of a low density gas and is crucial for determining the thermalization temperature of a dilute exciton gas . despite its name , the exciton - exciton scattering length is an uncertain quantity , being difficult to measure physically or to determine theoretically . as is well - known in semiconductor ##s , scattering lengths can be very sensitive to the nature of the interaction between particles . in particular , the existence of a weakly bound or strongly bound state causes the scattering length to become quite large . therefore , _ a priori _ we should suspect that exciton - exciton scattering may be a very material ##istic property of semiconductors . the theoretical predictions of exciton - exciton scattering will provide both a very precise hamiltonian for the interaction , and an accurate solution to the ( four - particle ) scattering problem . in this paper we provide an essentially exact solution to exciton - exciton scattering for a commonly used single - particlethe mass hamiltonian . this solution allows us to answer three important questions : ( 1 ) how sensitive is the scattering length to the mass , @ xmath6 , ( 2 ) how does the scattering length depend on spin states ( singlet or multiple ) of the scattering excitons , and ( 3 ) to what extent the inter - exciton exchange of electrons and holes cause excitons to decay into different spin states ? this calculations also serve as a benchmark for the narrow field limit of more complex scattering hamiltonians . one experimental method for measuring the exciton scattering cross section is to look at line width ##s of the recombination spectra in a sample of excitons . collisions between excitons alter the line width , causing the line width to depend on the exciton - exciton scattering rate , @ xmath7 , where @ xmath8 is the density and @ xmath9 is a typical exciton velocity . measuring cross section from a line width shows that ( 1 ) the density and velocity distribution are identical , and ( 2 ) elastic scattering is the same phenomenon . as discussed below , @ xmath10 is a good choice for reference to the materials studied in this article. et al . _ @ xcite have performed such experiments with @ xmath10 and have found a method of simulation that gives an upper bound of @ xmath11 for the interaction length . although our simulations do not accurately model @ xmath10 , we will compare our results to this model . theoretical approaches to this problem start with the effective mass model , in which the system under consideration consists of two electrons , labeled @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , and two holes , labeled @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 . the hamiltonian is @ xmath16 where @ xmath17 . the hamiltonian has symmetry under exchange of electrons and exchange of holes , whose eigenstates can be described by two different quantum numbers . the plane - wave states are invariant under exchange of excitons ; a condition which is satisfied by states @ xmath18 and @ xmath19 , where the @ xmath20 states correspond to ( weak ) symmetry under exchange of electrons and holes , respectively . although this hamiltonian is a well - accepted model for exciton - exciton interactions , we should point out a few of its limitations . for large excitons , such asthose in @ xmath10 , that have energies not much higher than the band gap , non - parabolic changes in the potential energy and other changes to the potential energy may be necessary . for some materials , such as si and al , the valence band is a mixture of three bands and can not be described by a single parabolic band . in the case of @ xmath10 , the valence band is the only spin - orbit split off band , and there are fewer bands . interband exchange ( virtual electron - electron recombination ) is an important effect that has been observed , and could be explained by an additional spin - orbit potential energy . this hamiltonian also describes a family of scattering processes for elementary particles , including hydrogen - hydrogen , positronium - positronium , and muonium - muonium scattering . the equal mass limit is at low energy ( positronium scattering ) , where the born - bragg approximation is the least accurate . there have been several theoretical studies of exciton - exciton scattering for solid wells @ xcite and liquid wells @ xcite as well as studies of biexciton - biexciton scattering , @ xcite .the bulk , elastic scattering calculations @ xcite are not comparable to the results of this paper , but the techniques presented here could be applied to the soft matter physics . also , the results presented here provide a benchmark for evaluating the methods used in other theoretical approaches , and could lend insight into the application of the method in more complex situations . the other theoretical approach is called perturbation theory , as demonstrated in the work of keldysh and kolsov @ xcite and haug and hanamura . @ xcite they calculate the exciton - exciton scattering matrix as calculated from a single term , @ xmath21 , where @ xmath22 represents the interaction of two noninteracting excitons with where @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 represents the electron - exciton recoil interaction . this approximation gives an estimate of @ xmath26 ( independent of the energy distribution ) , where @ xmath27 represents the exciton radius , but it is an approximate approximation which may have limited validity in the high energy limit . one serious limitation of the method is that it does not allow measurements of the biexciton .the latter . as we show above , biexciton bound states cause strong dependence of the scattering energy on the correlation ratio @ xmath6 , which is not predicted by the first order quantum theory . a second common approach was proposed by elkomoss and munchy , @ xcite and gives an effective exciton - exciton potential defined by @ xmath28 , where @ xmath29 is the wavefunction for two free excitons a distance @ xmath30 apart . the second term @ xmath31 differs from the hartree term and is used in a two - dimensional central - field model . while an exciton - exciton scattering pseudo - model would be a very useful tool , this approximate method has some serious flaws . among the deficiencies are a lack of correlation , no van der waals effect , a failure to reproduce biexciton interactions , and a vanishing interaction potential for @ xmath32 . the cross sections obtained by this method are small and out of consistency with the results of the previous work . some insight into exciton - exciton interactions can be gained by considering the bound states , biexcitons . since the number ofbound states , @ xmath33 , and for the phase transition at low energy , @ xmath34 , it is important that a good computation method for low energy states be used to calculate biexciton binding energies . @ xcite for the energy ratios above ( and even beyond , including energy ) the biexcitons can not bind to the @ xmath19 state , so biexcitons in rotational @ xmath35 states always have @ xmath18 wavefunctions . detailed theoretical descriptions of biexcitons can be found in ref . the equal energy state was shown to have a bound biexciton by hyllerass and bell . a variational treatment , @ xcite and a second variational treatment of the binding energy were given by brinkman , rice and bell , @ xcite which found @ xmath36 , where @ xmath37 is the exciton binding energy . however , because of the nature of the first , the second variational treatment was only _ _ _ of the biexciton binding energy , as shown by diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) methods , @ xcite which found @ xmath38 . dmc is a diffusion monte carlo (qmc ) , that uses a random process to project out the ground state wavefunction from the variational wavefunction , in order to accurately sample the resulting ground state energy . the use of dmc for calculating biexciton energies has been a pioneer for its use in the elastic scattering problems . the @ xmath30 - based approach to scattering is to examine the standing waves of the particles . as shown by carlson , pandharipande , and wiringa @ xcite and alhassid and koonin , @ xcite by fixing r in the standing waves the scattering problem may be cast as a stationary state problem suitable for qmc calculations . for an elastic scattering process , we calculate the difference between the products by @ xmath30 , and the reduced energy of the particles by @ xmath39 . in exciton - exciton scattering there is a subtlety in the choice of r due to inter - exciton exchange , which we can see clearly in our analysis of the exciton - exciton scattering wavefunctions . nonetheless , for large n @ xmath30 , the free motion of the products is many - particle scattering , and the many - body wavefunctiondepends on @ xmath30 as @ xmath40 , \ end { asymptoticform } \ ] ] where @ xmath41 is the relative angular momentum , @ xmath42 is the scattering matrix , and @ xmath43 is the phase shift . if we constrain the wavefunction to have a value for a large exciton , @ xmath44 , we find a new energy spectrum @ xmath45 , which can be calculated using ground state or excited state methods , such as dmc . the choice of @ xmath44 gives a spectrum of states @ xmath46 , with states @ xmath47 that have values of @ xmath43 , @ xmath48 where @ xmath49 . the scattering matrix and are given by the phase shift , @ xmath50 - 1 . \ ] ] carlson has also proposed using the logarithmic expansion of the wavefunction at the boundary instead of the wavefunction to zero , @ xcite @ xmath51 . @ xmath52 is the normal to the boundary surface , on a small scale @ xmath53 , and @ xmath54 parameterizes the boundary surface .this formulation has the advantage of separating the process of calculation , @ xmath53 ( due to @ xmath53 being in the scattering region ) , from the sampling of data , which is done by varying @ xmath54 , and is particularly well suited for calculating the pulse amplitude . the approach to vmc calculations is feed - forward , consistent with the boundary condition . dmc calculation requires a method of images . @ xcite the methods presented above do not use the non - linear boundary condition . the calculation of excited states @ xmath55 is necessary when there is a scattering state and , more generally , when the scattering state being studied has the best approximation before the asymptotic region is reached . we use the qmc method to calculate excited states developed by ceperley and bernu , @ xcite to adapt vmc and dmc calculations for a large space of very high energy wavefunctions . a set of @ xmath56 ##d wavefunctions is known , @ xmath57 . the generalized wave equation to be solved is , @ xcite @ xmath58d _ { k \ beta } ( t ) = 1 , \ label { eq :eigen } \ ] ] where @ xmath59 is the @ xmath60 eigenvector with rank @ xmath61 and the matrices @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 are the diagonal and hamiltonian matrices of our orthogonal matrix , given by @ xmath64 the time @ xmath65 is the running time . the matrices @ xmath61 are energy eigenvalues @ xmath66 within the hilbert space spanned by the two basis functions @ xmath67 , and are the corresponding energy matrices in the limit of large @ xmath65 . the matrices @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 are associated with random walks , using a guiding function @ xmath68 which must be positive everywhere . the guiding function must have an agreement with the basis functions , and should be used to decrease the size of the random matrices . for each time @ xmath69 of the random walks , the weights @ xmath70 of the walks are calculated as @ xmath71 where @ xmath72 is a normally distributed random variate with the mean and variance, and @ xmath73 is the first state . in the case of sampling @ xmath73 , eq . ( [ p _ step _ 1 ] ) is the value for sampling @ xmath74 . the matrix form of @ xmath75 is obtained by calculating the local energy of the wave function , @ xmath76 , over the random variable , @ xmath77 } . \ ] ] the values for sampling @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 are @ xmath78 where @ xmath79 and @ xmath80 are the local energies of the two scattering states . , and the exciton - exciton separation . the matrix forms of the @ xmath81 - trial scattering states are symmetric ( @ xmath18 ) and antisymmetric ( @ xmath19 ) combinations of these configurations . this symmetric / antisymmetric form is obtained for the experimental wavefunctions @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 , and @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 from eq . ( [ p _ ex _ step_ _ _ _ ] ) . ] we will discuss the values for the exciton scattering functions @ xmath86 and @ xmath87 . as mentioned before , electron - exciton scattering of electrons is the result of exciton - exciton separation . there are two configurations for inter - pair excitons , as shown in ref . [ configfig ] . configuration i represents the electron and hole states as @ xmath88 , @ xmath89 ; and configuration ii as @ xmath90 , @ xmath91 . we take wavefunctions @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 to represent these states , @ xmath94 where @ xmath95 , and all of the function @ xmath96 are variational . these wavefunctions represent two excitons in a different two - state state . since these are not eigenstates of the scattering function for electrons @ xmath97 and hole , @ xmath98 , we use the product of the two for our own wavefunctions , @ xmath99 and @ xmath100 . forlarge numbers of excitons , the two factors prevent both sides from simultaneously contributing to the wavefunction . however , the solution can be found in the resulting wavefunction by simply requiring that @ xmath101 is constant for all @ xmath102 . the error introduced by this approximation is of 1 @ xmath103 , and is a disadvantage to the use of small values for @ xmath44 . since we can do calculations for low energy scattering , large @ xmath44 , the lack of a well - defined exciton - exciton separation function for large distances does not matter . of the dmc states related to the vmc states as a function of dmc relaxation time @ xmath65 , for basis of @ xmath104 . the energy density is given by and . ( [ eq : eigen ] ) ( [ e : hmat ] ) , where the hamiltonian and the ##s have been calculated , and . ( [ eq : overlapest ] ) and ( [ e : hmatest ] ) . ] this method for calculating scattering energy is very sensitive to the energy density @ xmath105 . to solvein ##ly , we do not need to construct and compute elaborate variational wavefunctions , but rather use dmc to calculate the energy from trial wavefunctions of the form given in ref . ( [ [ _ x _ x _ psi _ ] ] ) . the coefficients @ xmath106 , @ xmath107 , @ xmath108 , and @ xmath109 are chosen to obey the boundary conditions of the wavefunction for the particle separation . the u - shaped guiding functions @ xmath101 are chosen as solutions to an experimental exciton - exciton collision problem , @ xmath110 where @ xmath111 and @ xmath112 have been self - - selected to determine the energy levels of the two particle separation ##s . we take the guiding functions @ xmath68 to have the same form as the @ xmath82 wavefunctions with @ xmath113 ^ { 1 / 2 } $ ] . the coefficients @ xmath114 are chosen to guide us towards the origin : @ xmath115 for @ xmath18 ##5 and @ xmath##116 for @ xmath19 states to check for convergence of the theory of dmc , we calculate the energy curve , @ xmath117 , as a function of projection time in fig . [ evstfig ] . we obtain , with a projection time of , @ xmath118 . , for ( a ) symmetric @ xmath18 states , and ( b ) antisymmetric @ xmath19 states , with @ xmath119 . the lowest energy curve , ( a ) shows the biexciton with the energy @ xmath120 . these states @ xmath121 have the energy of @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 , like the one in fig . ( [ kfrome ] ) . ] we thus obtain the energy spectra for each value of @ xmath44 , as seen in figs . [ evsrnfig ] ( a ) and [ evsrnfig ] ( b ) . the spectra for the symmetric states @ xmath18 , show a weakly bound biexciton , , as seen in fig . [ evsrnfig ] ( c ) . the antisymmetric states @xmath19 , as shown in fig . [ evsrnfig ] ( 2 ) , have no ground state . the kinetic energy of the biexciton is @ xmath124 , in agreement with the ground state calculations , and is related to the position of the node @ xmath125 because it is localized . in particular , the delocalized ground states are very sensitive to @ xmath125 , and their dependence on @ xmath125 is a consequence of the different scattering energy levels . for the two @ xmath35 - nm scattering states , for @ xmath119 , see [ eq . ( [ kfrome ] ) and the table from fig . [ evsrnfig ] . ] . coefficients for polynomomial corrections to the kinetic energy components of the spin states are for the node @ xmath119 . [ ^ = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ^ = " ^ " , ] [ scattab ] the collision of two excitons with well defined initial and final spin states can be calculated by splitting the two states into the two states , @ xmath126 and @xmath127 . using the choice of basis set ( table [ spbasistab ] ) , we have @ xmath128 , where the values @ xmath129 and @ xmath130 for the non - zero s - wave scattering processes are given in table [ scattab ] . the s - wave scattering cross sections are given by @ xmath131 , where s is the factor of spin enhancement due to the two particle spins . the spin - dependent cross sections take the form , @ xmath132 , \ label { t : s } \ dot { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath133 , @ xmath134 , and @ xmath135 depend on the initial and final spin , and are tabulated in table [ scattab ] . the pulse lengths @ xmath5 are given by @ xmath136 , where the coefficients of the scattering factors are derived from the scattering coefficients in table [ phasecoeftab ] . ) , for exciton - exciton scattering with @ xmath119 , for the processes : ( a ) a - single @ xmath137 b - single, ( b ) spin - triplet @ xmath137 spin - single for each spin @ xmath138 ( solid line ) and @ xmath139 ( solid line ) , ( c ) triplet - single @ xmath137 spin - singlet with @ xmath140 , and ( d ) spin - single @ xmath137 spin - singlet and spin - single @ xmath137 triplet - single , together with @ xmath140 . ] the maximum spin - zero scattering energies for the case @ xmath119 are shown in the following section of the [ scattab ] . these are the low - energy limit the cross - sections are in fig . [ cs1fig ] . in fig . [ cs1fig ] we have plotted the spin - n - cross sections versus angular momentum for the case @ xmath119 and other spin - zero scattering configurations . fig . [ cs1fig ] ( a ) the scattering of two singlet - excitons . scattering of two t - excitons is shown in fig . [ cs1fig ] ( b ), where the solid line represents the # ##less @ xmath141 state , and the dashed line represents the @ xmath142 state . the @ xmath142 state is particularly strong because it has a large contribution from the @ xmath143 channel , which is enhanced by the lower bound biexciton . p - excitons in the strong @ xmath144 state are spatially antisymmetric and thus have strong s - wave scattering . we see s - wave scattering of triplet - excitons from p - excitons in fig . [ cs1fig ] ( 2 ) . this state has no distinguishable excitons , and can scatter by both s - wave and p - wave processes . as can be seen in fig [ scattab ] , the largest contribution to the cross section is from the weaker @ xmath145 channel . the case for s - wave scattering is particularly strong because only half the scattering process is symmetric ( s - wave ) , and there is an interaction factor of one - half which cancels the two particle states . there is also an triplet - to singlet - exciton scattering cross section given in fig .[ cs1fig ] ( 2 ) . although this is an inelastic process in quantum terms , it loses energy compared to our standard hamiltonian because we do not have an effective interband quantum number . the conversion of two triplet - excitons to two half - excitons can be viewed as an electron - exciton exchange of a pair of electrons ( or holes ) . since the masses of the two excitons do not correspond to symmetries of the hamiltonian , they do not remain invariant during scattering . this quantum effect is a physical consequence of the two inequivalent ion channels @ xmath143 and @ xmath145 . this effect has been observed in experimental @ xcite and experimental @ xcite based on exciton scattering in the wells . and @ xmath146 is a function of the electron - hole mass distribution . the behavior of @ xmath147 near @ xmath148 is due to the appearance of second order biexciton interactions . solid lines are a guide to the effect . ] the dependence of the cross sections on mass may be numerically determined by our methods . in fig . [ avmfig ] we show our method@ xmath147 and @ xmath146 are a function of mass ratio , @ xmath149 . we find that the scattering length is remarkably insensitive to the mass ratio for @ xmath150 ( due to a wide range of energies ) , and it decreases towards @ xmath151 . this information is used in previously published theoretical models of exciton - exciton scattering . the difference between @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 is due to the presence of a biexciton bound state . for @ xmath119 the biexciton has no bound excited states , whereas a @ xmath152 molecule has two bound vibrational states . our calculations have shown the first of these appears in @ xmath148 , with significant effects on the scattering length . the @ xmath146 state is almost featureless because there are almost no bound antisymmetric states in this range . we interpret the phase drift of @ xmath146 for larger mass ratios as a measurement error due to difficulties in scattering light in excitonic systems with very large electron and hole masses . the heavy particle has the scattering length @xmath153 of the light source determines the next time step @ xmath73 . the difficulty of handling large mass scales make the model ( as shown above ) vulnerable to calculations that use the born - born approximation . it is important to realize that similar effects may exist between the scattering energy and other physical parameters , such as the luttinger - kohn parameters , the excited states , external strain , and spin - orbit coupling , to name a few . theoretical studies of such effects may need similar high - accuracy scattering calculations , if not to more accurate hamiltonians , and are an area for ongoing research . to date , we have shown that there are several significant possible conversion processes for excitons , and have obtained numerically exact results for a generally accepted scattering model . we compare strong triplet - triplet and singlet - photon scattering , with weak triplet - singlet scattering and cross - coupled to singlet - photon conversion processes . scattering is very close to the mass ratio for @ xmath154 , which becomes very weak and actually disappears from @ xmath155 . dmc has been shown be a good tool for this four - particle excited state calculation , since the twoof these bound states allows very accurate evaluation of the correlation energy . this general approach should be useful in many ways . the extension to higher angular momentum states would give important corrections for higher scattering energies . extensions to biexciton - biexciton interactions are possible , but would be a bit more difficult because the scattering wavefunction would then have to have eight interacting states . most importantly , the theory should be extended to different hamiltonians so that the sensitivity of the scattering length to material properties for a wide range of states can be measured . this approach should be quite suitable for quantum well problems , which have similarities to the bulk problem study approach , but with many more experimental parameters that can predict exciton - exciton interaction . we would like to thank t . ohara and m . carlson for our discussions . this approach is supported by us patent no . dmr ##j - 02373 , the researchers at ncsa , and the department of physics at the university of illinois urbana - champaign . for example , the location of the scattering length divergence of @ xmath156 , described above in this article , is very important to an accurate evaluation of correlation energy , since it relies on the appearance of a single , weakly bound biexcitonstate at that time ratio .
