precise doppler surveys of main sequence stars have revealed planetary companions that have masses of 1 , @ xmath6 / @ xmath7 , with the orbital period , @ xmath8 , still unknown ( mayor et al . 1999 , marcy & butler 1998 , miller et al . 1997 , miller et al . 1997 ) . these ` ` planetary ' ' companions exhibit both circular and elliptical orbits , consistent with formation in dissipative circumstellar disks , followed by gravitational interaction ( cf . lin et al . 1995 , artymowicz 1997 , levison et al . 1998 ) . the semimajor axes are all less than 0 . 1 au , with most being greater than 0 . 3 au . this ` ` piling up ' ' of planets near their host stars appears to be a secondary effect , although explained by the halo effect that favors planets of elliptical orbits . planets orbiting between 0 . 5 and 1 . 5 au would be easily detected with our average orbital period of 10 , but none has been confirmed . this variety of orbits supports scenarios in which planetary migration in a large protoplanetary disk moves higher mass stars . ( lin et al . 1995 , miller et .. 1998 ) . the distribution of the masses of substellar companions reveals planetary populations . our survey of 107 gk dwarfs found 4 that had @ xmath9 = 10 80 m @ xmath6 @ xmath10 ( marcy & butler 1998 ) . however , ` ` brown dwarf ' ' does exist with a mass less than @ xmath111 % , or 5 % . similarly , smith et al . ( 1997 , 1999 ) surveyed @ xmath11500 gk dwarfs , and found at least 4 companions = 10 80 m @ xmath6 . ( hipparcos data has shown that all other known brown dwarfs from that survey are very rapidly burning stars . ) in fact , at least 5 % of gk stars have companions with masses from 0 . 5 80 m @ xmath6 . for example , in our doppler survey of 107 main sequence stars at lick observatory , we found 4 companions that had @ xmath12 = 0 . 5 80 m @ xmath6 @ xmath10 ( marcy and butler 1998 , this article ) . thus , due to this well known first decade of masses , there is 1 brown dwarf ` ` desert ' ' at masses 10 80 m @ x##math6 , within 5 au . the efforts described above have focused on g and k type main sequence stars with masses between 0 . 8 and 1 . 2 l @ xmath5 . the question arises from the presence of planets around the m dwarfs which have 70 % of the mass of the universe . here we see the discovery of the first known planetary companion to an m dwarf , gliese 876 , within 1 . 2 au from the sun . gliese 876 ( = hd 113020 ) has a ##n of 5 . 04 , a spectral type of m4v and a distance from hipparcos of 0 . 213 ( perryman et al . 1997 ) . combining this parallax and the transit method of delfosse et al . ( 1998 ) gives @ xmath13 = 9 . 001 , which gives a value of , @ xmath14 = 9 . 0124 , @ xmath5 . the mass of the star gliese 876 can be derived from its g - type apparent magnitude ( k = 5 . 04 ) and radius , along with the empirical mass luminosity estimate ( mccarthy & mccarthy 1993 ) . this gives @ xmath15= 0 . 32 @ xmath3 and . 03 ##0 @ xmath5 . gliese 876 is chromospherically inactive ( delfosse et al . 1998 ) , which suggests that it is older than @ xmath111 gyr . however its space motion is slow which suggests that its age is less than 10 gyr . its metalicity is not known well , but a detailed analysis of the spectrum indicates that it is relatively poor by a factor of two compared to the sun ( valenti , 1998 ) . doppler shifts for gliese 876 have been measured at the lick and keck observatories , using the hires and hires echelle instruments , respectively ( vogt 1987 , vogt et al . the first measurements were made in 1994 . 3 ( at lick ) and in 1997 . 4 ( at keck ) , and both data sets remain to the present . the calibration of instruments and the determination of the spectrometer velocity were different for each exposure and for each individual type of spectrum with the iodine absorption lines superimposed on the infrared spectrum ( butler et al . 1996 ) . figures 1 and 2 show all of the measured spectral data as followsperiod of time , consistent with the corresponding keplerian fits . the velocities from lick also have typical uncertainties of 30 and those from keck are 6 m @ xmath10s @ xmath16 . poisson sums of the two dominate the measurement errors for this relatively young ( v = 10 . 1 ) star . the errors on all points reflect the uncertainty in the mean of the distance ( @ xmath17 ) from the ~ 2 m regions into which the spectrum is divided . doppler observations of gliese 876 in haute provence by delfosse et al . ( miller et al . 1999 ) also show an amplitude and phase in agreement with those reported here , thus providing an independent confirmation . it remains to be seen if their respective parameters agree with those quoted here . the lick and keck data each carry independent and different relative zero - points . the relative zero point has been determined by combining the two data , and averaging the two values until the keplerian fit ( see 3 ) yields a minimum for the @ xmath18 statistic . therefore , the lick and keck velocities are assumed to have the same zero - point . independent keplerian fits were obtained from the lickand keck data sets , and the light curves and orbital parameters are shown in figures 1 and 2 . the final orbital parameters are shown in the [ orbit ] , based on the best fit to the combined data set . the uncertainties are the differences between the two possible orbital fits . the two solutions agree in their uncertainties . the joint orbital parameter is @ xmath19 = 0 . 5 @ xmath3 0 . 15 au , and the other is @ xmath2 = 0 . 18 @ xmath3 0 . 03 . the orbital solution implies a planetary orbital semi - major axis of 0 . 21 @ xmath3 0 . 01 au , and a minimum mass of @ xmath9 = 2 . 1 @ xmath3 0 . 2 m @ xmath6 . this means @ xmath9is proportional to the minimum mass of the host star ( 0 . 18 @ xmath30 . 03 m @ xmath5 ) which contributes most of the uncertainty in the minimum mass . the periodic repetition of an assumed radial velocity component is apparent from the combined data and from the fits in figures 1 and 2 . the orbit is therefore not circular . there is no uncertainty in the orbital##s , thus indicating the presence of a hot planet with a mass greater than the jupiter mass and a period of 4 days or less in the gliese 876 system . the lick and keck velocities can be combined to give a final fit , as shown in figure 3 . this shows that the two stars have a similar rotation phase in addition to similar final fit orbital parameters . we note that two spectra from lick sit on the keplerian curve by 2 @ xmath20 , and we note that the absolute values of @ xmath1130 in those spectra can be misleading due to the high signal to noise ratios of those points . the large rotation period of 220 for gliese 876 leaves orbital motion as the probable cause of the velocity variation . motion on a rotating star can , in principle , cause artifical velocity variations . thus for gliese 876 , the apparent rotation velocity is more than 2 times @ xmath10s @ xmath16 , and the star is photometrically stable to within @ xmath110 . 02 . ( marcy and chen 1992 , weiss 1996 , delfosse et al . ) , spots do not change the apparent velocity by more than @ xmath11##0 . 02 @ xmath21 2000 = 40 . we have not checked for any pulsations , but the photometric data suggests that any pulsations are not significant yet . however , the f and g modes for a 2 . 3 m @ xmath5 dwarf would have length scales of minutes and hours , respectively , given the observed 1 year orbital period . the companion to gliese 876 , with @ xmath9 = 2 . 1 @ xmath30 . 2 m @ xmath6 , has a minimum mass of 3 to 4 m @ xmath6 , with identical orbital elements . for an estimated companion mass of 2 . 1 m @ xmath6 , the astrometric semimajor axis would be 4 . 3 mas . hipparcos also exhibits a deviation from the with @ xmath20 upper limit of 4 ) ( perryman et al . thus , the upper limit to the companion mass is 29 m @ xmath6 . at 3 . 7 mas , this is the smallest known extrasolar planet . the semimajor axis has an angular diameter 0 . 045 arcsec , with a minimum radius of 0 . 062 mas .it is also a prime target for direct imaging with ir adaptive optics and with interferometry ( i . e . , keck , lbt , sim , vlti ) . astrometric detection is also difficult due to : 1 . its close proximity to the star , 2 . the low mass of the star , 3 . the high mass of the star , 4 . the long orbital period which permits solar activity to be monitored within a season . gliese 876 is apparently the first m dwarf with a known planetary companion . we have observed only 24 m dwarfs from lick observatory during the past 4 yr ( with low precision of observations ) , which suggests that the number of jupiter mass planets within 2 au of m dwarfs could be a few percent , based on this early data . the precision and quality of keck observations makes them not readily available ( @ xmath111 ##e ) to provide information on the existence of planets around m dwarfs . the small orbital semi - major axis of @ xmath4 = 0 . 21 au and the radius of @ xmath2 = 0 . 21 pose two major puzzles to the study of such planetary companions . there is very little mass within a planetary orbital zone in a nominal protoplanetary diskat distance of 0 . 2 au to transfer several jupiter ##s of material to a nearby planet ( a . lissauer 1995 ) . another possibility is that the planets form 2 au from the star and then migrate inwards . orbital changes could be caused by interactions between the planet and the star in the protoplanetary disk , bringing the planet closer ( lin et al . 1995 , wang _ et al . _ 1998 ) . however , it is not known what would cause the planet around gliese 876 to begin its migration at 0 . 2 au . neither tidal interaction with the star nor a magnetospherically cleared region at the star surface would extend to 0 . 2 au , and thus they can not cause the migration . a second , as yet - unknown parking mechanism is needed for the planets around alpha cancri and @ xmath22 cor bor ( lin et al . 1997 , wang et al . 1997 ) . the non circular orbits for both @ xmath22 cor bor ( @ xmath2 = 0 . 16 @ xmath3 ##30 . 06 ) and for this planet around gliese 876 ( @ xmath2 = 0 . 16 @ xmath30 . 03 ) imply thatlarge orbital changes are common for jupiter and companions , between 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 au from their star . some physical mechanism must be employed which generally produces high inclination , in contrast to the inexplicably low eccentricities of the giant planets of our solar system . infrared spectroscopy shows planetary companions to gliese 876 from 1 au outward ( henry & mccarthy 1990 ) , and the lack of large variations in the velocities rule out planetary companions beyond 1 au . thus , the eccentricity of the planetary system around gliese 876 could not have been caused by a planetary core . however , gravity , if anything , did not enforce circularity in the inner orbits of gliese 876 or @ xmath22 cor bor . one possible explanation is that the effects of planetary companions ( of jupiter mass and larger ) may dominate the orbital parameters ( rasio and ford 1996 , weidenschilling and marzari 1997 , smith and ida 1996 ) . climate changes and global migration among planetesimals in the past could lead to large orbit changes and large moons ( levison et al . 1998 ) . long period migration from a protoplanetary disk may contribute to circular ##ity in such a2 . other systems that lose their orbit may exhibit orbital instability , leading to eccentric orbits at a variety of semimajor axis . however , the latter scenario , if true , does not explain the apparent distance of jupiters from 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 au , and it remains to be seen if planets are found further away . the minimum temperature for optical depth unity in the atmosphere of the star around gliese 876 is estimated to be - 60 c , too low for water in liquid atmosphere ( saumon 1998 ) . temperatures would be higher in deeper layers in the atmosphere . a planet found interior to 0 . 2 au would have surface temperatures of - 60 c . it would be difficult to determine if planets could reside in stable orbits within 0 . 2 au , or in proper motion resonances with the other planets described here . we thank kevin apps for analysis of hipparcos data . we thank xavier delfosse , michel martin , and didier queloz for recording their data for gliese 876 . we thank m . duncan , d . lin , and g . basri for useful conversations . we acknowedge ##d by nasa grant nagw -
