the short - lived isotope ( slri ) @ xmath4al came about during the formation of the most stable solids in the solar nebula , the al - , al - rich inclusions ( cais ) found in the inner disks . this suggests that at least some of the solar system - slris may have been injected into either the presolar cloud ( e . g . , miller & keiser 2012 ; boss 2012 ) or the solar nebula ( ouellette et al . 2007 , 2010 ; dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) of a cd - agb star - system . in either case , injection occurred in a young star that was highly heterogeneous , which would potentially reduce the usefulness of @ xmath4al as a highly stable chronometer ( dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) for future studies of the early phases of star formation ( macpherson et al . 2012 ; cf . krot et al . ) studies ( e . g . , boss 2011 , 2012 ) have shown how such initial radio - emission could be significantly reduced in a marginally more stable ( mgu ) system , as a resultof the large - scale inward and outward migration and diffusion of gas and particles large enough to interact with the atmosphere ( e . g . , wang et al . 2012 ) . other elements and their abundance in a similarly well - mixed solar system ( e . g . , os : walker 2012 ; fe : wang et al . 2013 ) . the stable oxygen isotopes , on the other hand , appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar system during the early phases of planet formation ; e . g . , the refractory fragments from wild 81p / wild 2 have normalized @ xmath5o / @ xmath6o ratios that span the entire solar system instead of @ xmath0 ##2 % , ( nakashima et al . 2012 ) . the simplest mechanism for generating these oxygen molecules is the photodissociation of oxygen atoms on the surface of the inner solar disk ( e . g . , podio et al . 2013 ) , where self - shielding could lead to the fractionation of gas - phase and solid - phase oxygen atoms ( e . g . , young & young 2005 ; krot et al . ) - - shielding on the dark , corrugated outer surface of the disk wouldthese lead to initial disk expansion , as the process would be repeated over time , rather than a single - event event like a nuclear shock wave . finally , the recent discovery of refractory particles in comet 81p / wild 2 ( brownlee et al . 2006 ; wang et al . 2008 ; nakamura et al . 2008 ) , which are thought to have formed close to the protosun , suggests that these small particles experienced large - scale particle transport from the inner solar system to the star - forming regions of the outer solar system . mgu models offer a way to accomplish this by large - scale transport ( e . g . , wang 2008 , 2011 ; wang et al . 2012 ) . marginally , these disks are thought to be involved in the fu orionis events experienced by young solar - type stars ( e . g . , zhu et al . 2010b ; vorobyov & basu 2010 ; wang et al . mgu model models ( e . g . , wang 2011 ) can easily lead to the high disk expansion rates ( @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 ) used to predict fu orionis events . fu orionis outbursts are expected to last for about a billion years andto occur periodically for all low mass protostars ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ; wang et al . mgu models are also capable of offering an alternative explanation ( resonance instability ) for gas ##eous ##on formation ( e . g . , wang 2010 ; meru & wang 2012 ; basu & vorobyov 2012 ) . additionally , the magnetorotational effect ( mri ) is expected to be involved in fu orionis outbursts as well ( zhu et al . 2009a ) , with mri operating in the ionized outer disk layers as well as on the disk inner surfaces . zhu et al . ( 2009c , 2010a , b ) have constructed one - and two - dimensional ( axisymmetric ) models of a coupled mgu - mri mechanism , with mgu transport leading to a build - up of mass in the dead disk , which then triggers a rapid mri transit and an outburst . alternatively , mri may occur in the outermost disk , being illuminated by cosmic rays , leading to a build - up of mass in the dead disk at the inner disk layers , thus triggering another phase of mgu transport . such a coupled mechanism may be useful for stellar stability in t tauri disks , where the low masses are expected tomuch smaller than at previous stages of development . we present here two different sets of mgu disk models that examine the time evolution of the heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar system , by either a single - injection process or a continuous injection process , for a range of star and disk protostar masses , including protostars with m dwarf disks . low mass exoplanets are expected to be discovered in an increasingly large number of m dwarfs ( bonfils et al . 2013 ; wilson & charbonneau 2013 ; kopparapu 2013 ) , with a number of these being potentially massive exoplanets , elevating the difficulty of understanding mixing and formation processes in m dwarf disks . the numerical models are implemented with the same three dimensional , gravitational hydrodynamics code that has been employed in previous mgu disk models ( e . g . , boss 2011 ) . more details about the code and its testing may be found in wilson & myhill ( 1992 ) . briefly , the code performs second - order - linear ( in both space and time ) equations on a spherical harmonic grid , including radiative expansion in the diffusion approximation . the spherical harmonic ( @ xmath9 ) approximation ofthe disk gas density distribution is used to determine the center - mass of the system , with terms up to and including @ xmath10 . the theta grid contains 50 grid points for the 10 au disk models and 100 grid points for the 40 au disk models . these models have 256 azimuthal grid points , and therefore 45 total grid points , given the hemispherical shape of the disk . the theta grid is spaced around the disk gas midplane to provide better spatial resolution , while the azimuthal grid is equally spaced . the grid length constraint is used to ensure spatial resolution . the disk boundary absorbs infalling disk gas , which is added to the central protostar , while the active disk boundary absorbs the bulk of non - moving disk gas , while retaining the mass on the active grid . the central protostar wobbles in such a manner as to determine the center of mass of the active disk . the time evolution of a color field is modeled ( e . g . , boss 2011 ) in order to follow the concentration and distribution of isotopes carried by the disk gas and by the particles , which should move along with the disk gas . the equation for the evolution of the color field density @ xmath11 ( e . g. , ( 2011 ) is equivalent to the above equation for the disk gas density @ xmath12 @ xmath13 where @ xmath14 is the disk gas density and @ xmath15 is the radius . the total amount of mass is conserved in the same way that the gas density is conserved , so the hydrodynamic equations are written in power law form ( e . g . , boss & myhill 1992 ) . the initial surface density distributions are based on the distribution given by , ( 1993 ) for a non - gravitating disk orbiting a star with radius @ xmath16 @ xmath17 @ xmath18 , \ ] ] where @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 are cylindrical parameters , @ xmath21 is the gravitational constant , @ xmath22 is the gas density , @ xmath23 is the surface density , @ xmath24 ( si units ) and @ xmath25 . the initial gas density is @ xmath26 while the initial surface density is @ xmath27 the parameters @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 and the initial radius @ xmath30 are defined in table 1 for the initialdisk dynamics explored in this article . the total amount of mass in the models does not change during the evolutions ; the initial infalling disk envelope accretes onto the disk , and an additional mass is added to the system across the outer disk boundary at @ xmath31 . the outer disk surfaces are not exposed to any potential sources of uv radiation . for the 20 au outer radius disks listed in tables 2 and 3 , the initial disk temperature profiles ( tables 1 and 3 ) are based on the brown ( 1996 ) temperature profiles , with variations in the assumed outer disk temperature @ xmath32 , adjusted in order to minimize the effect of varied initial values of the @ xmath2 stability parameter . values of @ xmath33 indicate highly gravitationally stable disks . the outer disks are all highly @ xmath2 stable , with @ xmath34 . for the 20 au outer radius disks listed in table 4 , the initial disk temperatures are fixed at the assumed outer disk temperature @ xmath32 , leading to similar initial @ xmath2 stability throughout the disks . for all of the models , the temperature of the infalling envelope is 50 k . the external magnetic field is added to the surface of the initial diskand an injection zone spanning either 45 degrees ( 10 au outer radius disks ) or 60 degrees ( 40 au outer radius disks ) in a narrow region of about 1 au , centered at the injection radii described in the tables . these models are intended to represent single - shot , single - particle injections of isotopic species , such as supernova - induced black - taylor fingers carrying color @ xmath4al ( e . g . , boss & keiser 2012 ) . table 1 describes both single - shot and continuous injection models , where in the latter case the color is added continuously to the same location on the sample surface throughout the time , crudely simulating ongoing photodissociation of species ( e . g . , smith & smith 2005 ) possibly leading to stable stable isotope transfer between the liquid and solid phases . the color field in the latter case is intended to represent isotopically distinct liquid and solid particles derived from the same photochemistry . note that in both the single - shot and continuous injection models , the total amount of color added is fixed ( e . g . , the color field in the sample surface is always set equal to 1 ) , and is intended to be scaled to particle size .and for the planet ( s ) under study . the color field is a massless , diffuse tracer that has no effect on the disk ' dynamics , so the absolute amount of color added is irrelevant for the disk s dynamic evolution . the models attempt to explain the variation from amplitude of the color field , and the absolute amount of color added ; the determination of the dispersion of the color field from the mean angular value , determined by the mean radial value at each unit of time , is the goal of these models . studies of the dg tau disk by podio et al . ( 2013 ) have shown that dg tau itself fills its disk ' outer layers from 10 au to 100 au with a strong uv radiation , sufficient for the uv photolysis and the formation of observable water vapor . much higher levels of uv radiation can occur for protoplanetary disks that form in stellar disks containing neutron stars ( e . g . , walsh et al . 2013 ) , an environment that has been suggested for our own solar system ( e . g . , dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) in order to explain the evidence for live slris ##s in primitive meteorites . the fact that molecular hydrogen constitutes the vast majority of adisk disk mass , which can not be directly measured , except in the star - disk interaction region , means that estimates of disk masses are difficult at best ( e . g . , miller & williams 2007 ) , as they are often based on an assumed ratio between the mass of mm - sized dust grains and the total disk mass . isella et al . ( 2009 ) found that low - and intermediate - mass pre - main - sequence stars form with disk masses ranging from 0 . 05 to 0 . 4 @ xmath1 . dg tau ##ri ) has a mass estimated to be as low as 0 . 5 @ xmath1 ( podio et al . recently , the mass of the tw hydra disk was estimated again to at least 0 . 05 @ xmath1 ( bergin et al . 2013 ) . these and other results suggest that the mgu disk mass predicted by these models may be present in some fraction of protoplanetary disks , and perhaps in the orion nebula as well . in fact , miller et al . ( 2011 ) found a fu orionis disk in the classical t tauri star lkh @ xmath35 188 - g4 . disk masses are generally thought to be @ xmath36 for such stars . theevidence that the fu orionis event occurred in lkh @ xmath35 188 - g4 shows that even the cores of class ii - b stars can experience phases leading to rapid disk accretion , e . g . , mgu disk formation . we have results for a variety of protostellar and protoplanetary disk models , including initial minimum @ xmath2 mass parameters , and mass injection parameters , for disks of many different sizes . figure 2 shows the initial conditions for the model with a @ xmath37 disk in orbit around a @ xmath38 protostar . the disks range from 1 au to 10 au , as in the models of brown ( 2008 , 2011 ) . the main difference from these previous models is that the disk mass ( @ xmath37 ) is considerably lower than that of the previous models ( @ xmath39 ) . as a result , the initial minimum @ xmath2 parameters are much lower than in the previous models , ranging from 2 . 2 to 3 . 1 , compared to the previous models of 2 . 4 to 3 . 3 . the present models are much more highly unstable initially than the disks previously studied , with the goal being to learn whether or not the previous modelsthese allow for higher values of @ xmath40 . figure 1 shows the initial midplane temperature profiles for these models . only the outer regions of the disks are cool enough to be gravitationally bound , but the models show that this is likely to result in a similar behavior for all of the table 2 models . figures 3 and 4 show the equatorial temperature profiles of the color / gas ratio ( @ xmath41 ) for ages 1 . 5 - 2 . 6 - 4 . this ratio is significant , as it is similar to the @ xmath4al / @ xmath42al and @ xmath5o / @ xmath6o ratios measured by cosmochemists , i . e . , the concentration of the anti - photolysis product species , followed by that of the species that was present in the pre - injection disk . figure 2 shows that the initial disk surface heating at 9 au has resulted in the rapid transport of the color field downward to the hot inner midplane , as well as inward to return to the inner disk surface at 10 au . the initial three dimensional motions of the mgu disk are sufficient for this large - scale process at just 10 yr . at this time , the color / gasit is still highly variable , but figure 4 shows that only 146 days later , the color / density ratio has been fully homogenized throughout the inner disk region . figure 4 shows the evolution of the dispersion of the ratio of the radiation density to the gas density for models 1 . 0 - 2 . 0 - 9 and 2 . 0 - 2 . 6 - 10 at different times . these models differ only in the orbital radius , either 1 au or 10 au . the dispersion shown in figure 5 is defined to be the square root of the sum of the squares of the color field divided by the gas density , subtracted from the azimuthal average of this ratio at a given orbital radius , divided by the square of the orbital average at that radius , normalized to the number of possible reference points , and multiplied by a function of radius in the orbital midplane . figure 5 shows that the color dispersion is a strong function of orbital radius and mass , with the ratio actually being very large ( i . e . , around 10 yr , in spite of the apparent increase seen in figure 4 at the orbital radius ) as a result of the isotopestraveling downward and moving inward and outward . however , the dispersion decreases dramatically in the initial disks for both models after 777 yr to a value of @ xmath0 1 % to 2 % . in fact , the distribution in both models 1 . 0 - 2 . 6 - 10 and 1 . 0 - 2 . 6 - 10 tends toward roughly the same radial velocity by this time , so that the final location of the initial location has no effect on the long term evolution of the system : that is controlled only by the evolution of the final mgu disk , which is identical for these two models ( i . e . , the phase changes are passive ##ly , and have no effect on the disk s shape ) . note that any small dust grains found in the initial disk will be carried along with the disk itself , so that some of the dust that start out at 1 % will be transported to the final disk , in the same way that some of the gas is transported outward . most of the gas and dust , however , are absorbed by the growing protostar . figure 1 shows the results for both models with varied @ xmath40 , i . e . , models 1 . 0 - 2 . 6- 9 , 1 . 0 - 2 . 0 - 9 , and 1 . 0 - 3 . 0 - 9 , all within 1370 days . it can be seen that in spite of the differences in the relative degrees of rotation , the variations in the outermost disks all correspond to average values of @ xmath0 1 % to 10 % . this suggests that mgu model parameters are not particularly sensitive to the exact size of the corresponding @ xmath2 disks , a result that was also found by boss ( 2011 ) for somewhat more massive disks . as also found by boss ( 2011 ) , the variations in the innermost disks are much larger ( @ xmath0 10 % to 20 % ) than in the outer disks , a direct result of the stronger mixing associated with the larger outer disks , in spite of the longer rotation times of the outer disks . table 1 shows the initial conditions for the models with either @ xmath43 disks around @ xmath44 protostars , or @ xmath45 disks around @ xmath46 protostars . in either case , the parameters extend from 1 au to 10 au . these models are of interest for understanding how conditions might change for disks around gb and m dwarfs , with possible ramifications for the habitability of the rocky planets that form ( e . g . , raymond et al . 2007 ) around m dwarfs . figure 2 shows the observed midplane velocity profiles for these models . figure 7 shows the observed evolution of the disk for model 1 . 1 - 1 . 8 - 2 , appropriate for a typical g dwarf protostar . as in all the models , it can be seen that the already highly dense disk is rapidly expanding , in this case at about 5000 yr . note that this time period is much shorter than that for g dwarf disk mixing and migration models , as a result of the longer keplerian orbital periods for lower mass , m dwarf protostars . as in the g dwarf protostar models ( e . g . , figure 5 ) , the inner disk density is higher than in the outer disk , though in these models ( with a theoretical initial @ xmath47 ) the inner disk dispersion decreases to @ xmath0 5 % to 10 % , compared to @ xmath0 5 % to 2 % in the outer disk . figure 8 shows the same situation for model 1 . 1 - 1 . 8 - 2 , whichdiffers from the first model shown in figure 1 only in that the injection occur at 4 au instead of 2 au . as with the g dwarf model , the dispersions for all of these models tend toward nearly identical radial distributions : the underlying mgu disk evolution determines the parameters for the model . similar results hold for the models with @ xmath46 protostars , i . e . , early m dwarf disks . we now turn to the consideration of the effects of single - particle versus combined injection at the center of the larger # ##most ( 10 au ) disks than have been shown to occur for g dwarf disks ; boss ( 2007 ) considered disks extending from 10 au to 20 au in radius . table 4 shows the same results for the models with a @ xmath48 disk around a @ xmath38 protostar , with the disks extending from 10 au to 40 au . because of the much larger inner and outer disk radii for this class of disks , these models can be calculated for ages as long as @ xmath49 years ( table 4 ) . such ages are typically much less than the typical ages ( @ xmath50 yr ) of t tauri stars , meaning that in order for mgu disks to occurat these two phases , a prior phase of the mri - mgu evolution might be required to make the experimental results meaningful . figures 9 and 10 show the evolution of the dispersions for models 1 . 0 - 1 . 1 - 40 - 20 and 1 . 0 - 1 . 1 - 40 - 20c , differing only in that the former model has single - shot injection and the latter model has continuous injection , designed to simulate a disk with very rapid photolysis and expansion of the outer disk boundary . for model 1 . 0 - 1 . 1 - 40 - 20 , it can be seen that the evolution is similar to that of the previous single - shot models : a gradual increase in the radius , followed by expansion to @ xmath0 1 % to 2 % away from the outer disk boundary . the higher values observed near the outer disk boundary ( @ xmath0 40 au ) are probably caused by the unphysical build - up of considerable disk mass at 40 au and should be discounted . however , for the continuous injection model shown in figure 10 , it can be seen that the dispersions of the disk boundary at @ xmath3 au can be as high as @ xmath0 3 %, consistent with the much larger increase in stable - isotope ratios , compared to slri models . in a model with finer - grid resolution , as well as better sub - grid mixing conditions , one might expect much stronger homogenization to occur , but the energy levels obtained from the present models should be considered to be upper bounds . the total amount of color injected during the continuous injection models is large , compared to single - shot injection models : for model 1 . 0 - 1 . 4 - 40 - 20c , for example , at 4000 ms , the total amount of color injected has increased by a factor of @ xmath0 60 compared to the single - shot models , and by another factor of @ xmath0 60 after 27000 ms . figures 11 and 12 compare the results for continuous injection at either 20 au or 40 au , respectively , i . e . , for models 1 . 0 - 1 . 4 - 40 - 20c and 1 . 4 - 1 . 4 - 40 - 30c . in spite of the continuous injection models , figures 11 and 12 show that even at a relatively early stage ( 405 yr ) of development , the actual color / energy ratios are very similar ; as before , the mgugrain size is the same for both models , and that is the primary determinant of the long term stability . finally , similar results to those shown in figures 9 - 10 were obtained for the two models shown in table 1 . these models show that the key factor in determining the color profile profile is whether the process occurs in a single - shot or continuously ; in the latter case , the mgu system does its best to reduce the color profile , but the fact that spatial light is being continuously injected limits the degree to which this heterogeneity can be reduced . while the grains in the interstellar medium are generally spherical , crystalline silicate grains have been observed in the first m dwarf ( sst - lup3 - 1 ) , at distances ranging from about 1 au to about 5 au , in both the midplane and outer layers ( mern et al . ) crystalline dust grains are thought to have been produced by thermal annealing in the hottest regions of the disk , just inside of 1 au ( sargent et al . 2009 ) . again , heat transport appears to be insufficient to explain the observations , and the results for the models with the 0 . 1 @ xmath1 protostar suggestthat mgu disks in low mass m dwarf stars may be responsible for these variations . in addition , crystalline mass distributions in protoplanetary disks do not seem to correlate with stellar mass , radius , rotation rate , disk temperature , or the disk to star ratio ( watson et al . these results also seem to be consistent with the predictions of the present models , which show that mgu disk phases are equally capable of relatively rapid large - scale mixing and migration , regardless of the star or disk mass , and the exact value of the @ xmath2 ##al parameter . these models have shown a more robust conclusion , namely that a phase of marginal disk instability in planets and stars with a range of masses and disk temperatures can lead to relatively rapid inward and outward transport of large grains and small grains , as well to explain the protostellar disk accretion associated with fu orionis events , as well as to explain the discovery of refractory material in sol 81p / - 1 . a mgu disk phase driving the fu orionis event is also quite likely to have occurred for our protosun , and cosmochemically convenient for explaining the relative homogeneity of @ xmath4al / @ xmath42al .derived from a supernova injection event , and the use of @ xmath5o / @ xmath6o ratios derived from sustained stellar self - shielding on the surface of the inner solar system . low - mass planets , from g dwarfs to m dwarfs , may also represent a late stage of mgu envelope formation and transport . in this regard , it is important to note that fu orionis itself , the source of the fu orionis # ##s , has a mass of approximately @ xmath51 ( zhu et al . 2007 , 2009b ; beck & aspin 2012 ) , i . e . , the mass of a g dwarf , and that m dwarf protoplanetary disks may undergo evolutions similar to that of the solar system , with possible implications for the habitability of the outer planetary system ( e . g . , raymond et al . 2007 ; bonfils et al . 2013 ; martin & charbonneau 2013 ; kopparapu 2013 ) . i credit jeff cuzzi for his work , the referee for a number of the results , and david keiser , john acierno , and raj pandit for their use of the distributed computing infrastructure at dtm . this work was partially funded by the global atlas of planetary systems project( nnx09af62 ##a ) and also thanks in part to the nasa ames telescope ( nna09da81a ) . some of the observations were performed using the solar wind instrument , the construction of which was also performed by the nasa major scientific instrument instrument ( mri -
