threshold nets are obtained by applying a weight @ xmath1 , from a threshold @ xmath2 , to each of @ xmath3 nodes and to the two nodes @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 whose combined weights exceed a certain threshold , @ xmath6 : @ xmath7 @ xcite . threshold nets can be constructed of ( a ) all degree distributions , including scale - free , by simply choosing the weight distribution @ xmath2 and the threshold @ xmath6 , and they have an astonishingly wide range of practical applications : from the simple network ( a simple " " model of scale - free networks consisting of a single node ) with its low number of nodes , @ xmath8 , to the complete network . used extensively in the graph - theory community @ xcite , they have recently come to the attention of linear and non - linear researchers thanks to the simple construction of hagberg , muller , and schult @ xcite . , and ( b ) its box construction , and modularity . they are ordered one at a time from bottom to top , @ xmath9 s on the top and @ xmath10 s on theid . , scaledwidth = 35 . 5 % ] hagberg _ et ##h _ . , exploit the fact that threshold graphs can be most easily encoded by a three - element sequence , corresponding to two sets of nodes , @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 @ xcite . as new nodes are introduced , according to a given sequence , nodes of type @ xmath9 connect to all of the existing nodes , while nodes of type @ xmath10 connect to all of the nodes , of the sequence : @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 . in fig . [ 1 _ 1 ] ( a ) we show an example of the threshold graph obtained from the sequence @ xmath13 . consider the _ modular _ ##ity of threshold graphs : a subsequence of @ xmath14 and @ xmath10 s gives rise to an @ xmath15 - tree , and nodes in a subsequence of @ xmath9 s connect to @ xmath10 s thereafter , but not among one another . we highlight this modularity with a diagram of nodes ( similar to @ xcite ) : two sets : nodes of type @ xmath9, that are not connected among themselves , while the boxes of @ xmath16 - and of @ xmath10 - of @ xcite . a connection between these boxes is that all of the nodes in one box are connected to all of the nodes in the other , fig . [ in _ box ] ( 2 ) . given the properties of the threshold net , there are fast algorithms to compute its various benchmarks , besides its modularity , such as degree distribution , diameter , betweenness ##es , and the components and eigenvectors of the graph laplacian @ xcite . the latter are a crucial part of connectivity and classification and have applications to data mining and mesh processing @ xcite . even more important , it is thus possible to _ design _ threshold nets with a given degree distribution , number of eigenvalues , etc . , @ xcite . despite their malleability , threshold nets are unique in some important respects , for instance their diameter is 1 or 2 , regardless of the number of nodes @ xmath3 . our idea is of finding the smallest set of nets that can be constructed from a sequence ( formed from two or more letters ) of deterministic rules of connectivity ontheir own right . it is truly this property that gives the nets all their remarkable properties : modularity ( as in everyday life complex nets ) , easily measured , measures including the quality of compression and a high degree of compressibility . roughly speaking , each additional letter to the alphabet allows for an increase of the link in the nets themselves , so that the three - letter nets have diameter 3 or 4 ( some of the new types of two - letter nets have diameter 5 ) . this modest increase is very significant , however , in view of the fact that the diameter of many everyday life complex nets is not much larger than that @ xcite . sequence nets give us much latitude in the types of nets that can be constructed in this elegant way , while retaining much of the general appeal of threshold nets . another remarkable property of sequence nets is that any ensemble of sequence nets has a unique ordering ; simply list them systematically according to their sequences . we can use this ordering for both structural and non structural properties of sequence nets . in this paper , we make a first stab ##ly the first ##ization of _ _ _ _ . in sequence [ two - letter ] we list systematically all of the possible methods for constructing the sequence nets from the two - letter alphabet . insymmetry arguments , we find that threshold nets are just one of the equivalence classes , determined by the highest degree of symmetry . we then discuss the remaining two classes , showing that also that there is a high degree of modularity and that various structural properties can be computed independently . curiously , the new classes of 3 - letter sequence nets can be related to a new class of threshold nets , where the difference @ xmath17 , rather than the sum of the weights , is the difference corresponding to the threshold @ xmath6 . in section [ three - letter ] we derive all possible classes of connected three - letter nets . symmetry arguments lead us to the definition of 30 new equivalence classes . among these classes , we find a natural extension of threshold nets to three - letter sequence nets . despite the new structure , 3 - letter sequence nets still retain many of the structural properties of threshold and 2 - letter sequence nets . we also find that at least some of the 3 - letter sequence nets can be mapped into threshold nets with _ two _ thresholds , instead of others . we conclude with a definition and discussion of open graphs in section [ conclude ] . consider graphs that can be constructed from the @ xmath18 of the equivalence classes @ xmath9 and @ xmat##h10 . we shall represent any possible rule by sequences @ xmath19 and * * * whose values determine whether nodes of type @ xmath4 connect to nodes of type @ xmath5 : @ xmath20 if the nodes connect , and 0 otherwise ( @ xmath21 and for @ xmath22 , respectively ) . [ graph _ theory ] gives an example of the graph formed from the sequence @ xmath13 , using the _ threshold _ rule @ xmath23 . since each element can connect @ xmath24 to @ xmath25 independently of the others , there are @ xmath26 different rules . we shall disregard , however , the two nodes that fail to connect : @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 , @ xmath27 for they yield simple _ threshold _ graphs of the different types of nodes : @ xmath28 yields isolated nodes only , @ xmath29 yields one complete graph of type @ xmath9 and one of type @ xmath10 , @ xmath30 yields a complete graph of type @ xmath9 and isolated nodes of type @ xmath10 , etc . applied to the sequence @xmath13 ( a ) , and from @ xmath31 applied to the reverse - symmetric sequence @ xmath32 ( a ) , are identical . , scaledwidth = 35 . 0 % ] the list of symmetry rules can be obtained , by considering two kinds of symmetries : ( a ) rotation , and ( b ) time reversal . _ permutation _ is the symmetry obtained by alternating between the two kinds of sequences , @ xmath33 . thus , a permuted rule ( @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 ) acting on a reversed sequence ( @ xmath36 ) yields back the original graph @ xcite . _ time reversal _ is the symmetry obtained by reversing the term ( " " ) from the rotation matrix , and taking the transpose of @ xmath37 . the inversion rule acting on the inverted sequence @ xmath38 yields back the original graph . the two symmetry operations have their own inverse and they form a symmetry relation . in particular , one may combine the two operations : a combination with @ xmath34 applied to a reversed sequence with inverted sequence @ xmath39 yields back the original graph , andfig . [ time _ reversal ] . all of the two rules @ xmath40 are equivalent and generate threshold graphs . @ xmath41 is the rule for threshold graphs found by hagberg et al . , @ xcite , and @ xmath42 is added to it by permutation . @ xmath31 is obtained from @ xmath41 by time reversal and iteration ( fig . [ time _ reversal ] ) , and @ xmath43 is obtained from @ xmath41 by time reversal . the two rules @ xmath44 are equivalent , by either iteration or time reversal , and generate non - trivial threshold graphs that are different from threshold graphs ( fig . [ abgraphs ] ) . the rule @ xmath45 generates trivial threshold graphs . however , the complete bipartite graph @ xmath46 can also be produced by adding @ xmath47 to the sequence @ xmath48 of @ xmath49 @ xmath9 s followed by @ xmath50 @ xmath10 s , so the rule @ xmath51 generates a ` ` * ' ' form of @ xmath47 . it couldnote that this is the case at the beginning , because of the linear rules @ xmath52 , @ xmath11 : these make the order of the @ xmath9 s and @ xmath10 s in the same generating sequence irrelevant . by the same reasoning , @ xmath53 and @ xmath54 are reduced forms of @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 , respectively . they generate threshold graphs with generating sequences of @ xmath9 s and @ xmath10 s . the two rules @ xmath55 are equivalent , in either permutation or computational complexity , and generate non - threshold graphs different from threshold graphs and graphs generated by @ xmath47 ( cf . [ abgraphs ] ) . similarly , the rule @ xmath56 is a reduced form of @ xmath57 ( not @ xmath58 ) and generates the threshold graphs ( which are threshold graphs , so @ xmath59 is subsumed completely in @ xmath60 ) . , the rules @ xmath47 ( a ) , @ xmath41 ( b ) , and @ xmath57 ( c ) . note the anti - parallel property of( a ) and ( c ) : the graphs are the inverse , or complement of one another ( see text ) . the inverse of the threshold graph ( a ) is also a ( two - letter ) threshold graph , obtained from the same sequence and applying the rule @ xmath42 ( @ xmath41 , c ) . , scaledwidth = 47 . 5 % ] to summarize , @ xmath41 , @ xmath47 , and @ xmath57 are the same two - letter rules that generate all classes of non - simply connected graphs . there is yet another simple example of symmetry : applying @ xmath47 and @ xmath57 to the same graph produces _ threshold _ , or _ inverse _ graphs that are connected in the same sequence if and only if they are _ threshold _ connected in the original graph . the graph - background symmetry manifest in the rules @ xmath47 and @ xmath57 ( @ xmath61 ) are also observed in the graphs they generate ( cf . [ abgraphs ] a , b ) . on the other hand , the inverse of threshold graphs are also threshold graphs . similarly , the inverse of the matching rule applied to the same ( threshold ) graphtake back the original rule . in this case , threshold rules have no symmetry . @ xmath47 - graphs are typically more dense , and @ xmath57 - graphs are typically smaller than threshold graphs . the connections between nodes of are @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 . ( b ) two equivalent versions of the threshold rule @ xmath41 . the second and third versions are defined by label switching and label - reversal , respectively . ( c ) diagrams for @ xmath47 and @ xmath57 . note how they relate one another to the same set of rules : [ ( a ) . , scaledwidth = 0 . 0 % ] the threshold rules have an additional useful interpretation for directed graphs , where the nodes represent the edges of the input graph , the directed graph , e , etc . , from @ xmath9 to @ xmath10 is the rule @ xmath52 , and a connection of any type to itself is represented by a closed - loop ( fig . [ graph _ notation ] ) . because the rules are the same for sets of labels , there is no need to label switch the rules : all the isomorphs have the same labels . ., time - reversal symmetry means that nets with no edges are equivalent to graphs . note that the order of null - loops is reversed in this respect , so we can treat them as graphs . we shall make use of this notation , extensively , for the analysis of three - letter sequence nets in fig [ three - letter ] . a very important property of threshold nets is the fact that any arbitrary set of such nets has a natural ordering , simply listing the nets alphabetically according to their order . in particular , consider for instance of the ensemble of erds - rnyi ##r ##ᵢ of @ xmath3 nodes , where they are present with only @ xmath49 : there is no natural way to order the @ xmath62 nodes in the ensemble @ xcite . testing a structural property against the alphabetical ordering of the nets yields the structural structure of the ensemble itself , providing further insights into the nature of the ensemble . as an example , in fig . [ eigs _ 2threshold ] we use @ xmath63 , the second largest eigenvalue , for the ensemble of connected threshold nets , @ xmath64 . ( there are @ xmath65 nodes in the ensemble , since their order cannot bestart with the letter @ xmath9 ) . notice the branching pattern formed by the graph plotted in this way , which is a tree , or a cayley tree : the values within the first half of the graph of the @ xmath1 - class increase in the second half , and the pattern iterates . we go further into the picture . nodes , plotted against their alphabetical ordering . , scaledwidth = 45 . 5 % ] the properties of the new classes of two - letter sequence nets , @ xmath47 and @ xmath57 , are as well described as for threshold nets . here we focus on @ xmath47 alone , which forms a subset of threshold nets . the structure for @ xmath57 is very similar and it can be trivially constructed from the rotational symmetry of the two classes . all the sequence nets in the @ xmath47 class will begin with the letter @ xmath9 and end with the letter @ xmath10 . a sequence of this sort can be represented more compactly @ xcite . the numbers of @ xmath9 s and @ xmath10 s form the lower class , @ xmath66 .we assume that there are @ xmath3 nodes and @ xmath14 nodes ( @ xmath14 is even ) . we also use the notation @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 for the total number of @ xmath9 s and @ xmath10 s , as well as @ xmath69 and above for @ xmath70 . finally , since all the nodes in each layer have structural properties we denote any @ xmath9 in the @ xmath4 - th layer by @ xmath71 and any @ xmath10 in the @ xmath5 - th layer by @ xmath72 . with this assumption in mind we need to discuss several structural properties . : since @ xmath9 s connects only to preceding @ xmath10 s ( and @ xmath10 connects only to preceding @ xmath9 s ) the degree @ xmath73 of the nodes is given by @ xmath74 : there are no triangles in @ xmath47 , so the degree of the nodes is zero . : every @ xmath9 s connected to the last @ xmath10 , so thedistance between any two @ xmath9 s is 2 . : @ xmath10 is connected to the node @ xmath9 in the sequence , and the distance between any two @ xmath10 s is also 2 . the distance between @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 is 1 if @ xmath77 ( they connect together ) , and 2 if @ xmath78 ( @ xmath75 links to @ xmath79 , that links to @ xmath80 , that links to @ xmath76 ) . : because of the time - space relationship between @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 , it suffices to create @ xmath10 nodes only . the result for @ xmath9 can then be obtained by simply reversing the insertion process and permuting the nodes . the distance betweenness @ xmath81 of each node @ xmath82 is defined as : @ xmath83 where @ xmath84 is the number of shortest paths from node @ xmath85 to @ xmath86 ( @ xmath87 ) , and the fact that @ xmat##h88 is @ xmath89 . @ xmath90 is the set of shortest paths from @ xmath85 to @ xmath86 that goes through @ xmath82 . the factor @ xmath91 arises for these networks since each layer is used twice in the summation . the betweenness of @ xmath10 ##2 can be generalized from lower layers to higher layers recursively . consider the networks between - layers @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 for @ xmath94 . the second term in the equation accounts for the shortest paths from the @ xmath95 to itself and all the layers of @ xmath9 , and the third term applies to paths from @ xmath95 to @ xmath72 to @ xmath71 ( @ xmath96 ) to @ xmath97 . although this problem can be solved explicitly it is best left in this section , since it completely ignores the fact that the betweenness factor varies from one layer to the next . in other words , the coefficients are _ modular _ , where each successive @ xmath10 - layer is thethe examples below . : unlike threshold nets , for @ xmath47 nets the ratios are _ not _ constant , and there seems to be no efficient way to compute them . instead , we rely on the second smallest and largest nets , @ xmath63 and @ xmath98 , respectively , for their important structural properties : the larger the ratio @ xmath99 the more susceptible the system is to solve @ xcite . consider first @ xmath63 . for @ xmath47 it is easy to show that both the _ vertex _ and _ edge _ _ are equivalent to @ xmath100 . however , using an inequality in @ xcite , @ xmath101 the upper bound is stricter and is a good approximation to @ xmath63 ( see ref . [ l2bounds ] ) . compare with @ xmath64 against their lower bounds ( solid lines ) , and their upper and lower bounds ( straight lines ) . , scaledwidth = 40 . 5 % ] for @ xmath98 , in version 2 . 2 of @ xcite one can find the relation @ xmath102 butthey did not prove very accurate , however . playing with various structural properties of the nets , and against their initial ordering , we have improved upon the approximation @ xmath103 where @ xmath104 is the maximum weight of the graph , see ref . [ l2approx ] . the approximation is fast for the _ weight _ graphs ( @ xmath105 ) and the relative approximation is slowly with @ xmath3 ; it is roughly - 10 % for @ xmath106 . compare with @ xmath64 against their initial ordering ( closed curve ) , and its maximum value ( broken line ) . , scaledwidth = 0 . 0 % ] . @ xcite ##r was shown that threshold nets have a restriction to a sequence net , with a maximum sequence ( by the " rule " @ xmath41 ) ; and therefore , for any @ xmath41 - graph , there is a set of pairs @ xmath107 of the nodes ( not necessarily consecutive ) , such that for any two nodes that match @ xmath7 in the sequence net . here we have a similar bound for @ xmath47 - ( " @ xmath##57 - ) sequence nets and a special type of sequence net , where weight is decided by the difference @ xmath17 rather than the sum of the weights . we start with the assignment of a given set of nodes to an @ xmath47 - type net . let the set of @ xmath3 nodes have type @ xmath107 ( @ xmath108 ) , obtained from the probability distribution , and we assume @ xmath109 , without loss of generality . consider nodes with @ xmath110 as type @ xmath9 and nodes with @ xmath111 as type @ xmath10 . then , consider the two nodes @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 that have @ xmath112 . the resulting sequence can be generated as a unique sequence using the method @ xmath47 , defined as follows . for convenience , denote the set of nodes with @ xmath113 where the first @ xmath114 nodes correspond to @ xmath9 - nodes and the second to @ xmath10 - nodes . denote the resulting sequence as @ xmath18 and find the @ xmath115 by the rule (( pseudo - code ) : set @ xmath116 , @ xmath117 for @ xmath118 , do : 0 . 4 cm if @ xmath119 0 . 8 cm set @ xmath120 and @ xmath121 0 . 8 cm else 0 . 4 cm set @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 etc . it is known that if the @ xmath124 is removed before the end of the sequence , the weights @ xmath10 - 1 are still equal to the end of the sequence ( and similarly for the @ xmath125 ) . for example , using this method we find that the difference - free " graph " from the set of weights @ xmath1261 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 12 , 17 , and @ xmath127 and @ xmath128 , can be created from the sequence @ xmath13 , with the rule @ xmath47 . consider now the following problem : given the graph created from the sequence @ xmath18 with the rule @ xmath47 , we have the ( non - empty ) set of weights @ xmath##129 such that matching any two nodes with @ xmath112 results in the same graph . # ##s the original sequence into its compact representation @ xmath130 , and compute weights @ xmath131 for nodes @ xmath9 in layer @ xmath131 , weights @ xmath132 for nodes @ xmath10 in layer @ xmath0 , and remove the threshold ##s @ xmath133 . for example , the single @ xmath13 has a compact representation @ xmath134 , with @ xmath135 minimum , so the two @ xmath9 s in layer @ xmath25 have weights @ xmath25 , the two @ xmath10 s in layer @ xmath136 have weights @ xmath137 , the two @ xmath9 s in layer @ xmath138 have weights @ xmath138 , and the one @ xmath10 in layer @ xmath139 has weights @ xmath140 . the weights @ xmath141 , with the minimum @ xmath142 , reproduce the original sequence . sequence is obtained from the following@ xmath57 can be similarly mapped to difference threshold ##s in exactly the same way , except that the criterion for connecting two nodes is then @ xmath143 , instead of @ xmath112 , as for @ xmath47 . the mapping of random nets to arbitrary random graphs can be useful in the analysis of some of their properties , for example , for finding the _ isoperimetric degree _ of a random graph @ xcite . with a three - letter alphabet , @ xmath144 , there are at the most @ xmath145 possible rules . however , these can be reduced considerably , due to constraints . because the alphabet only has 9 entries ( an odd number ) each rule must be identical to its predecessor . alternatively , we can restrict ourselves to rules with no more than 9 non - zero entries and apply additional arguments to increase their space at the other . we can then consider the rest of the possible rules . in fig . [ 3nets ] we show all the three - letter rules with two , three , and four entries . rules that apply to random graphs , and symmetric rules ( by label permutation or time - reversal ) have been removed from the table . and @ xmath146) , and rules 5 , 6 , 13 , and 15 are special cases of rules 2 , 4 , 7 , and 8 , respectively . this leaves us with fifteen distinct three - letter threshold ( s ) , and their immediate complements , for a total of 30 distinct sets of three - letter sequence nets . , scaledwidth = 40 . 0 % ] rule 2 @ xcite is in fact quite new : using sequences of the @ xmath9 and @ xmath146 ( as shown in rule 1 of the algorithm ) we can easily see that the rule is identical to the three - letter rule 8 . in the same way , rule 7 is the same as the two - letter threshold rule 4 . rule 2 is a weaker form of induction : because of the weak connection @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 , the order at which @ xmath10 and @ xmath146 appear in the graph relative to one another is important . ( on the other hand , the order of the @ xmath10 s relative to @ xmath9 s _ is _ important , since @ xmath9 s relative only to those @ xmath10 sthat happened early in the sequence . ) now , given a sequence one can extend it by adding all the @ xmath146 steps to the end of the sequence . if we now have 2 , @ xmath52 and @ xmath148 , then we get the same graph formed from the original sequence with the rule 3 . the same consideration goes to rules , and , that are the forms of 6 , 7 and 8 ( or 6 ) , respectively . we are now left with only three distinct rules with fewer than 5 connections . to these we should add their complements , for a total of 30 distinct two - letter rules . note the resemblance of , , and to two - letter threshold graphs . seems like a particularly useful example and we will rely on it for much of our discussion here . since we can easily see wether a graph is connected , not , _ a posteriori _ , with a simple sequence that has @ xmath149 steps , it is useful to use shortcut ##s that tell us how to avoid bad edges at the end : stating that two - letter threshold graphs are connected if and only if their sequence ends with @ xmath10 , deals with the problem most effectively . analogous statements arefor three - letter sequence graphs but they are a bit more complicated . for example , three - letter rules interpreted with respect to sequence graphs if and only if they are : _ ( 1 ) the first b and the first c in the sequence appear before the last a . ( 2 ) the sequence does not end with b _ . ( we assume that the sequence contains all three letters . ) for 1the rules are : _ ( 1 ) the first a in the sequence must appear before the first b . ( 2 ) the first c in the sequence must appear before the first b . ( 3 ) the last a in the sequence must appear before the first c , and there ought to be at least one letter between the two . _ similar requirements exist for all other three - letter rules and can be found by inspection . structural properties of three - letter sequence graphs are analyzed as closely as those of two - letter nets , so we consider , as an example , a few basic properties of sequence nets . we use a technique similar to that of the [ new _ graph ] . : @ xmath9 and @ xmath146 nodes form complete subgraphs , and @ xmath10 nodes connect to the preceding @ xmath9 s and @ xmath##146 ##0 . 53 the degree of the layers are : @ xmath150 : since the @ xmath9 layers make a single complete graph @ xmath151 , and likewise for @ xmath146 , @ xmath152 . the @ xmath10 layers do not connect among themselves , but they directly connect to the nodes in the first layer ( which does not consist of @ xmath10 nodes ) , so @ xmath153 . for the distance of @ xmath9 s from @ xmath10 , we have @ xmath154 where @ xmath155 is the index of the first @ xmath9 - layer and @ xmath156 is the index of the last @ xmath10 - layer . the first line follows since @ xmath10 s is directly connected to both @ xmath9 s and @ xmath146 s . the second , and third and fourth lines are shown in fig . [ distance ] a and b , respectively . the second @ xmath157 follows the exact same pattern . however , for the different layers one has @ xmath158 - layer . ( a ) if@ xmath159 and the first @ xmath9 is above @ xmath72 the distance is 2 . ( b ) if the first @ xmath9 is above @ xmath72 , then the first @ xmath146 will be 1 ( @ xmath10 = nt ##h the sequence ) ; in that case if @ xmath71 is below the last @ xmath10 the distance is 3 , and otherwise the distance is 2 . only the two parts of the above sequence are shown . , scaledwidth = 40 . 5 % ] : we have still no reliable way to compute the ratio , despite the similarity between one and two - letter threshold nets . however , plotting of the ratios against the alphabet ordering of the nets once again reveals interesting statistical patterns , and one can hope that these can be used at the very least to produce good predictions and results . in fig . [ 1 _ r18 ] we plot the ratio @ xmath160 for nets with @ xmath161 against their alphabet ordering . the @ xmath1 - axis contains sequences of nets that are simply connected : in this case @ xmat##h162 and above are also possible . these examples show large gaps in the plot , for example , the large gap near the center corresponds to disconnected graphs that start with the weight @ xmath10 ( see section [ below ] ) . for plots consisting of @ xmath161 nodes , against their usual ordering . note the gap near the center , which corresponds to sequences of disconnected graphs . see also the mirror rule this is equivalent to the mirror symmetry of the rule itself . , scaledwidth = 1 . 0 % ] many of the three - letter sequence nets can be generalized to generalized forms of threshold nets . for example , the following scheme produces a _ two _ - threshold net , corresponding to three - letter sequence nets defined by the rule . let the weights be of weight @ xmath163 , from a probability distribution , and connect the two nodes @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 that start @ xmath164 or @ xmath165 . connect nodes with with @ xmath166 with @ xmath9 , nodes with @ xmath167 with @ xmath10 , and nodes with @ xmath168 with @ xmath146, we see that all @ xmath9 s connect to one another and all @ xmath146 s connect to one another . the @ xmath10 s do not , and @ xmath9 s and @ xmath146 s do not connect ; nodes of type @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 may or may not connect , and only for nodes of type @ xmath146 and @ xmath10 . to reflect the actual connections , the nodes of type @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 may be arranged in a sequence according to the algorithm , @ xcite , for the threshold ##s . , the nodes of type @ xmath146 and @ xmath10 may be arranged in a sequence , to reflect the actual connections , with the exact same result . because there are no connections between @ xmath9 and @ xmath146 the two sequences cannot be trivially related . note , however , that once the @ xmath9 - @ xmath10 connection is established the direction of the @ xmath10 connection is fixed , so the direction of connection between @ xmath146 and @ xmath10 ( @ x##math169 or @ xmath170 ) is _ not _ arbitrary . in our case , the number is equal to and not to . we have found a new class of nets , sequence nets , constructed from a set of letters and fixed rules of inference . two - letter sequence nets are threshold nets , and in addition two have discovered nets . the class can be reduced to a " - threshold " net , where " @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 are equivalent if their " weight is @ xmath143 . this type of net can be a very good model for social networks , where the weights can be political leaning , social status , number of offspring , etc . , and agents tend to associate when they are closer in these cases . we have shown that the structural properties of the new class of two - letter sequence nets can be analyzed with ease , and we have found an ordering of classes of sequence nets that is useful for defining and analyzing their various properties . we have fully classified 3 - letter sequence nets , and looked at a few examples , showing that they too can be analyzed simply . the diameter of sequence nets scales up with the number of letters in the alphabet and for a three - letter alphabet it isalready 3 or 4 , compared to the real life random nets . larger nets might be achieved with a modest expansion of the alphabet . there are some open questions : applying these arguments we have managed to reduce the list of 3 - leter nets to just 30 types , but we have not ruled out the possibility that some overlooked symmetry might reduce the list further ; the question of which types lead to threshold nets can be solved by searching for small alphabets , but we have no comprehensive approach to solve the problem in general ; we have asked how to reduce sequence nets to generalized forms of threshold nets , in which cases is such a mapping always possible ? is there a simple way to find such mappings for each sequence rule ? ; what kinds of nets would exist if the sequence rules applied only to the @ xmath50 _ letters , instead of to _ all _ the letters ? etc . we hope to answer some of these questions in future work .
