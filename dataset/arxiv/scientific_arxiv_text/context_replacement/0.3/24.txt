the onset of reionization involves the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the 10 billion years after the big bang , and the transformation of the optical medium ( igm ) from opaque to visible . despite recent discoveries , however , this is not yet fully understood . it is now well established that reionization is driven by @ xmath14 due to expansion of the ly @ xmath15 galaxy ( e . g . @ xcite ) , and that the universe had already expanded around planck @ xmath4 when its distance was less than 600 myr , based on the high scattering optical depth provided by planck @ xcite . however , there is still some uncertainty about the sources of reionization . can galaxies evolve with enough speed at such short distances to provide the reionizing photons ( e . g . @ xcite ) , or is the process possibly driven by other classes of objects such as agn @ xcite ? observationally , recent advances in near - field detector technology have dramatically improved our ability to search for galaxies during this epoch . following the development of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the _ chandra space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , a continuously -sample of galaxy candidates at @ xmath16 is accumulating thanks to a variety of surveys . these range from small - area ultradeep surveys such as the galaxy ultra - deep survey ( hudf , @ xcite ) , to large , large - area surveys for @ xmath17 candidates , using deep surveys such as the cosmic background near - infrared deep sky survey survey ( candels ; @ xcite ) , or taking advantage of random - sampling techniques like in the atlas of reionizing galaxies ( borg ) survey ( @ 11700 , 12572 , 13767 ; @ trenti ) . currently , a population approaching 1000 galaxy candidates at @ xmath18 is known as @ xcite , and we are beginning to find the brightest galaxy candidates from the first 100 million years ( @ xmath19 ; @ xcite ) . these surveys put solid support on the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) out to @ xmath4 , which appears to be more well described by the @ xcite form , @ xmath20 , observed at lower redshift @ xcite . however , other studies suggest that bright galaxy formation might not be predicted as well as @ xmath16 ,and either a single power law @ xcite or a double power law @ xcite fit to the bright end of the lf has been explored . this change in the shape of the bright end is in part due theoretically to the pattern of star formation in the most overdense and hottest galactic environments where the brightest and rarest galaxies are expected to form @ xcite . a departure from a schechter form could imply a greater number of feedback processes at certain temperatures , which in turn would imply an increase in the emission of ionizing radiation by galaxies . additionally , at @ xmath21 , the atomic number distribution of bright stars is affected by a bias @ xcite , and this bias could cause the lf to take on a power - law shape at the bright end . currently , the data at @ xmath22 are far too small to draw any conclusion on which form is best , since only a handful of @ xmath23 candidates are known . in addition to constraining the shape of the universe , the brightest non - @ xmath24 candidates detected by _ hst _ observations are also potential targets for follow - up observations to determine stellar physical properties such as ages and chemical properties @ xcite , ion##ization time of the source @ xcite , and spectroscopic redshift . for the latter , detection of the source depends either on detection of a lyman line in the galaxy itself , ( e . g . , @ xcite ) and / or of uv lines , like lyman - @ xmath15 ( e . g . @ xcite ) or of uv lines such as ciii ] or civ @ xcite . the follow - up for sources to @ xmath25 was extremely challenging , with high limits on line lengths observed from most sources . however , the candidate sources showed the promise of confirmation based on the long series of follow - ups which led to spectroscopic results back to @ xmath26 @ xcite , with all the ly @ xmath15 sources at @ xmath25 @ xcite . with the aim of distinguishing the discovery of the latest and most important sources in the field of reionization from legacy fields such as candels , the brightest of reionizing galaxies survey ( borg , see @ xcite ) has been carrying out pure - line , random ##ized searches with wfc3 since 2010 . borg used a large sample ( @ xmath27 )of @ xmath4 @ xmath28 - band gap with @ xmath17 ( @ xcite ; see also @ xcite ) . this is a list of sources that are strongly affected by near - background background ( sample of ` ` background ' ' bias ; see @ xcite ) , which is especially important for the galaxies located in the dark matter region ( @ xmath29 ) , as inferred from clustering data at @ xmath18 @ xcite . follow - up study of the borg dropouts with keck and vlt has provided evidence for an increase of the band gap at @ xmath4 compared to @ xmath30 @ xcite . currently , a new set of observations is ongoing , with a revised filter - set used for the new method of galaxy detection at @ xmath23 ( borg [ z9 - 1 ] ; go 13767 , pi trenti ) . the collection from @ xmath31 of the dataset ( @ xmath32 arcmin @ xmath5 ) led to the identification of two candidates , @ xmath3 @ xcite with @ xmath33 , which are similar in luminosityto the spectroscopically brighter @ xmath26 sources detected in @ xcite , but significantly brighter than the brighter @ xmath34 - dropouts with @ xmath35 detected in the z / candels fields from a different area @ xcite . these new observations indicate that it might be possible for a large number of ultra - bright sources ( @ xmath36 ) to be present as early as 2000 myr after the big bang . thus , they urge us to systematically analyze the borg spectral data from observations in the previous section , which cover @ xmath37 arcmin @ xmath5 , to search for possible @ xmath3 sources and determine their number accordingly . this paper presents the results of this search , and is structured as follows : section [ section2 ] briefly discusses the borg dataset . section [ section3 ] presents our selection criteria for @ xmath3 sources ( @ xmath38 - - - ) , with results presented in section [ section4 ] . in section [ lfsection ] , we determine the upper uv spectral limit for @ xmath39 , and continue with further determinations . section [ section : 2 ] summarizes and concludes . sectionthe data we call the @ xcite files : @ xmath40 , @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 . the data are quoted from the file system @ xcite . we use data collected as part of the catalogue of reionizing galaxies ( borg [ z8 ] ) project , which consists of core borg pointings ( go 11700 , 12572 , 12905 ) , augmented by other pure parallel observation data ( go 11702 , go yan , @ xcite ) and by gto pure parallel data . for an in - depth analysis of the data , we refer the data to @ xcite . here , we use the 2014 ( dr3 ) version version of the data , which consists of core borg pointings with a total area of @ xmath43350 arcmin @ xmath5 . these objects were imaged using the wfc3 / 2 ##x f098 m , f125w and f160w , and in the optical @ xmath44 ##4 , using either the wfc3 f606w or f600lp filter . we refer to the wfc3 f098 m , f125w and f160w images in the@ xmath45 , @ xmath38 and @ xmath46 respectively , and to the f606w and f600lp values of @ xmath47 and @ xmath48 , respectively . exposure ##s for each field vary on a field - by - field basis , and the @ xmath49 limiting values for the source and target @ xmath50 are 5 @ xmath51 , with a mean value of @ xmath52 @ xcite . we note that since the dataset comes from multiple sources when the primary instrument is a satellite ( cos or stis ) , there is no filtering of the data . to compensate for the lack of filtering , the borg image processing pipeline has been augmented with a customized laplacian edge filtering algorithm provided by @ xcite . however , the lack of filtering has a minimal effect ( @ xmath53 ) on the resolution and data quality , as it has been achieved through comparison between primary ( sequential ) versus pure - parallel observations of the same object @ xcite . since the borg [ z8 ] survey was designed to use @ xmath38 as primary observation band , some observations have beena very short range in the @ xmath46 - band . to achieve a consistently high image quality , first we include in the analysis only those fields with an exposure of @ xmath54 in @ xmath46 . this results in the selection of 71 fields out of 72 , so that the field covered by our analysis is @ xmath55 arcmin @ xmath5 . the calculation of the exposure time in @ xmath46 for the fields in borg [ z8 ] is shown in borg [ fieldhist ] . the borg [ z8 ] experimental data ##set consists of reduced and aligned image data associated with ` multidrizzle ` @ xcite with a pixel range of @ xmath56 , as well as associated weight maps ( see @ xcite ) . following our previous approach , to account for noise in the data @ xcite , we create rms maps from the weight maps , and adjust them to account for the noise produced by ` multidrizzle ` ( see @ xcite ) . in short , this is done for each field and is by measuring the noise in the data at random , not necessarily with background noise ( i . e . the ` ` background ' ' noise ) , and comparing themeasurement with the value obtained from the rms map , which can then be multiplied by a multiplicative factor to match the measurement . our correction factors are the average @ xmath57 for the ir , and @ xmath58 for @ xmath44 ( see also @ xcite ) . in addition , the zero - points are chosen to account for different distances in each line of sight , according to @ xcite . using ` sextractor ` @ xcite in dual - band mode , we obtain coordinates of sources in each band , using the @ xmath46 - band model for comparison . brightness and signal to noise ratios are calculated based on isophotal fluxes / s ( flux _ iso ) , while we adopt mag _ iso for the absolute brightness of the source . to calculate @ xmath19 - coordinates , we use the dropout function @ xcite . at x @ xmath24 , neutral hydrogen in the galactic region completely absorbs uv photons , leading to a break in the optical absorption region of ly @ xmath15 ( 1216 ) . for galaxies at @ xmath59 , this implies a break in the @ xmath38 -filter , and re - filter in the @ xmath44 and @ xmath45 bands . our reliance on @ xmath38 - dropouts means that our selection of sources are essentially available only in @ xmath46 . therefore , to reduce the risk of finding new sources , we impose a new detection : @ xmath46 , with s / n @ xmath60 . we also impose a new @ xmath61 break , limit sample completeness for sample purity , and require a short cut : @ xmath62 , which is more difficult than the typical @ xmath63 approach to legacy sources ( e . g . @ xcite ) since we do not have the availability of multi - spectral filters to constrain the selection of sources with different frequencies and thus prevent contamination . therefore , we impose the following limits for selection of @ xmath38 - bands : @ xmath64 when computing the @ xmath65 limit , if the @ xmath38 - band already has s / n @ xmath66 we use the @ xmath67 limit instead . finally , to reduce the risk of contamination from the defects in the data collection process , we can imposethe stellarity varies through the ` sextractor ` class _ star system . we define class _ star @ xmath68 , where 1 refers to a light source , and 2 to a surface light source . we then visually examine the stars that meet these criteria to determine any possible detector properties and emission patterns . all the stars that meet these criteria and pass the visual examination are listed in table [ table1 ] , and discussed below . lccccccccccc borg _ 0240 -

@ xmath24 code bpz @ xcite , show a high dependence on redshift , caused by the uncertainty in the density of galaxies with high redshifts with colors similar to those of @ xmath22 galaxies . for the one band ( @ xmath46 ) detection , the observed redshift ##s are uniform in the range @ xmath94 . for the two - band ( @ xmath38 and @ xmath46 ) detections , the photometric redshifts are slightly uniform around @ xmath9 . the observed brightness measurements are shown in figure [ fig1 ] with the images of the galaxies . a comparison of the observed @ xmath46 magnitude against the observed redshift of our candidates against @ xmath21 galaxies from the _ hst _ / wfc3 surveys is shown in figure [ hvszplot ] . while two of our candidates are particularly faint in @ xmath46 , they are consistent with previously - observed candidates at @ xmath39 and @ xcite . we then determine the distances of the candidates , starting from the same visible - light ( uv ) radius .or by ` sextractor ` , which is translated into an artificial source , taking into account the effects of the point - spread function ( psf ) broadening and surface brightness changes of @ xcite . the source separation has been achieved by adding and recovering multiple sources with different galaxy sizes and magnitude into borg images . source separation is very important to help discriminate between high - and low - @ xmath24 sources , since the studies by @ xcite and candels galaxies show that @ xmath95 sources are more compact than @ xmath96 sources with different colors . this empirical separation can be related to the same separation of galaxy sizes as @ xmath97 with @ xmath98 @ xcite , although a recent study by @ xcite shows that the source will likely evolve less strongly with magnitude ( @ xmath99 ) compared to other sources . we discuss the contamination of our source , in section [ contamination ] . this candidate is the largest in the universe , with magnitude @ xmath100 . it was robustly detected in @ xmath46 at @ xmath101 , and subsequently detected in @ xmath38 at @ xmat##h102 , even though it is close to the center of the galaxy . the source has a very red @ xmath103 color , with @ xmath104 . it also has similar structure , and with @ xmath105 . the photometric redshift solution is sharply peaked at @ xmath106 , with a broad higher - energy wing . this candidate , in the same band as the first one is detected with a @ xmath107 , making it the second - brightest candidate in the sample . it is detected with s / n @ xmath108 in @ xmath46 , and it is detected with s / n @ xmath109 in @ xmath38 . it is the most bright source in the sample , with @ xmath110 . its second field , field borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 129 , is detected at @ xmath111 , with a broad higher - redshift wing . field borg _ 0240 - 1857 includes a very bright candidate with @ xmath112 , detected with s / n @ xmath113 . this candidate is also detected in the third field ( @ xmat##h38 , @ xmath45 , @ xmath44 @ xmath114 ) . of the three possible candidates , this source is relatively compact , with a mean l - shape of @ xmath115 . this is smaller than the size of the image ( @ xmath116 ) , indicating that it could be a point - star - like object such as a cool dwarf star , although the stellarity of this source is @ xmath117 , which is lower than the values expected for a point source ( e . g . @ xcite - class _ star @ xmath118 and @ xcite class _ star @ xmath119 to exclude them ) . this source is close to a distant galaxy with @ xmath120 , with a centre - to - centre angular velocity of @ xmath121 . while this distant galaxy has an uncertain photometric distance solution , it is likely to be near @ xmath122 , based on its apparent size . using the framework developed by @ xcite and @ xcite , we estimate the gravitational lensing of this source . magnification pdfs are obtained by estimating velocity .from @ xmath46 images , obtain the two time - dependent taylor - maxwell equations given by @ xcite and @ xcite . velocity distribution is the best tracer of the strength of a large gravitational lens @ xcite . the angular radii of the foreground objects are modelled as singular spherical spheres ( e . g . @ xcite ) which depend on the optical speed and the effective diameter relative to the source , and between the lens and source ( where we get the first one - @ xmath24 image ) . assuming that the light source is a @ xmath123 ( which has lensing magnification ) , we infer a magnitude @ xmath124 . this object has a magnitude @ xmath125 ( @ xmath126 ) , and is detected by the @ xmath46 camera , with an extended but small radius ( small radius @ xmath127 ) . the object is located relatively close ( @ xmath128 image ) to a hot spot , which appears in the @ xmath45 and @ xmath38 images . the @ xmath46 - based image is unique since it wasacquired in a lower orbit than the images in other bands . we have examined the individual flt files and found that since the separation between the source pixel and the hot pixel is larger than the @ xmath129 , and there is no sign of a hot pixel in the @ xmath46 - band , the identification of the source as an @ xmath38 - candidate is possible . this source is detected with a maximum @ xmath130 , and an m / n @ xmath131 . it is not detected by @ xmath38 , @ xmath45 or @ xmath44 . it has an effective magnitude of @ xmath132 . this candidate is close to the background object ( @ xmath133 centre - to - centre at separation ) . the foreground object has an apparent magnitude @ xmath134 , and is at an apparent photometric redshift . we use the same mathematical framework as for borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 1 to calculate the lensing magnification of this source . assuming that the source is an @ xmath123 , we find a maximum @ xmath135 . all of the flt filesof this we highlighted the presence of a bad pixel , already identified and masked by the data reduction pipeline , at the outer edge of the image region of the second candidate in one of the two @ xmath46 images . to determine the quality of the initial image , we measured the total number of the flt frames separately , so that the source was detected with s / n @ xmath136 in the unaffected image and with s / n @ xmath137 in the image affected by the bad pixel . therefore , we are confident that the source is stable and that the photometry from the final corrected image is robust . the sixth and last candidate was also detected at s / n @ xmath138 , @ xmath46 ( @ xmath120 ) , and also at the @ xmath38 with s / n = 0 . 7 . the photometric ##ity is sharply reduced at @ xmath139 , with a secondary solution at @ xmath140 . this candidate is also very compact , with a half - light radius @ xmath141 , and the highest stellarity of the sample ( h _ n = 0 . 91 ) . this .with high stellarity from a typical s / z source , a cooler source ( cool source ) for this source is relatively likely , as we discussed in section [ contamination ] . to convert the data for the search of sample candidates at @ xmath3 from the archival borg [ z8 ] data into a number function / wave function determination , we need to consider both the impact of contamination on our sample , and the spectral parameters derived from the data . there are multiple types of non - @ xmath24 sources that may have similar @ xmath103 colors to @ xmath19 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) , such as galactic sources , low - redshift passive sources , and strong line emitters . cool , luminous stars in the milky way may be possible contaminants of our sample , although typical sources have a typical @ xmath103 drop . with low signal - to - noise ratio , the selection of point - like radio sources from resolved galaxies using the ` sextractor ` class _ star parameter is not very reliable . we use class _ star @ xmath143 and our selection of @ xmath38 - 1 in section [ section3 ] to reject artifacts resulting from theseparation process , but this is not a strong enough criterion to reject these stars from our sample . in this case , all of our sources identified as @ xmath38 - stars have class _ star @ xmath144 , with only borg _ 1459 + 7146 _ 785 having class _ star @ xmath145 ( a value interpreted by @ xcite as indicative of a stellar nature ) . therefore we conclude that this material is most likely a stellar material with unusual properties . emission - line galaxies are another source of contamination for @ xmath19 - samples . for example , galaxies in @ xmath146 with strong [ oii ] emission may be detected in @ xmath46 - samples because the galaxy continuum is too weak to be detected in the same samples @ xcite . @ xcite find that , for @ xmath147 , the maximum number of emission line galaxies that enter the photometric spectrum is @ xmath148 per arcmin @ xmath149 , thus creating the catalogs of the emission line galaxies with varying @ xmath38 frequency and spectral type @ xmath150 . extrapolating this result to @ xmath39 , weexpect to find @ xmath151 potential sources of this type in our search area . this value is in agreement with previous spectroscopic studies of @ xmath147 borg , by @ xcite using the mosfire spectrograph on the keck telescope , and by @ xcite using xshooter on the very large telescope . these studies found no emission lines in the spectrum of @ xmath147 candidates , and were unable to pick out emission lines from the non - @ xmath24 - emission line contaminant to @ xmath152 , suggesting that most of the @ xmath46 flux is due to a weak emission line . @ xcite will show that , with a 3hr shift , only a small portion of the spectrum ( @ xmath153 ) is so dominated by atmospheric transmission and not by oh lines that a strong emission line would not be detected to @ xmath13 . the last , and possibly most severe class of conditions , is that of passive and active sources that thus show a strong balmer break and a very weak uv continuum . under these conditions , @ xmath154 sources may exhibit properties of lbgs and thus areinto our database . comparison with _ spitzer _ / irac from @ xmath155 and @ xmath156 samples will help distinguish between high - and low - energy sources . in particular , dusty @ xmath123 sources will be 1 - 2 magnitudes brighter in [ 3 . 5 ] and [ 4 . 5 ] than the @ xmath46 , and @ xmath19 lbgs will have a more flat spectrum . without spitzer _ , we rely on the size of the sample as candidates for the @ xmath157 $ ] color , and sources with @ xmath158 as likely candidates . @ xcite find that , since the mean size of sources in the @ xmath39 sample from @ xcite and @ xmath72 , high - energy , irac - based interlopers have a mean size of @ xmath159 , which can be as large as @ xmath160 , and there are also low - @ xmath24 sources with sizes greater than @ xmath161 ( figure 4 , @ xcite ) . hence , we take @ xmath162 as a threshold . the resultthe sources in our sample are being extended to fall into these categories . the sources considered in @ xcite are larger than the @ xmath39 sources in our sample , and so it is likely that the larger sizes of borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 129 and borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 369 are due to their higher masses . from the mass - number relation derived from @ xcite , we found that the size of the @ xmath163 source of @ xmath164 ( the brightest in our sample ) would be @ xmath165 , above our threshold of @ xmath162 . this criterion can also be used to simply reject extreme emission - line galaxies , which are likely to be more massive . for example , @ xcite found that their sample of the extreme emission line galaxies in 2006 have fwhm @ xmath166 , similar to our @ xmath167 criterion for @ xmath39 galaxies . in addition to finding the mass probability distribution of our sample sources at bpz , we also used sed parameters described in @ xcite . from this , we calculated the estimated size @ xmath168 of@ xmath169 . we conclude that three out of the six sources , borg _ 1459 + 7146 _ 785 , borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 129 , and borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 369 , are likely to be contaminants . for the other sources , contamination is also a possibility , and hence we make a conservative estimate of @ xmath170 s ( two out of three samples at @ xmath171 ) , based on the data from the borg [ z9 - 10 ] and @ xcite using the average probability @ xmath168 for the sources in their sample . of the six possible sources identified in the full borg [ z8 ] survey , five of them , including the two brightest , were found in the same sample ( borg _ 0240 - 1857 ) . the mean probability for this pointing is equal to the sum of the samples ( @ xmath172 s at @ xmath46 ) , and therefore such a finding is highly unlikely given the assumptions of a random distribution of sources in the six samples analyzed together . based on these expectations , the probability of contamination can be used to determine the number of bright sources - @ xmath24 , @ xcite, under the broad assumption that uv radiation is correlated with dark - matter and energy ( e . g . , @ xcite ) . overdensities have also been identified at @ xmath4 and lbg at @ xcite . however , one other possibility , more consistent with the unexpectedly large size of the extremely bright @ xmath34 - dropouts , would be the presence of an overdensity of active and active young galaxies within the intermediate size group . in either case , a detailed study of this area is very useful since we can either identify an exciting overdensity of extremely bright galaxies at @ xmath11 , or shed light on the existence of intermediate size galaxies with bright @ xmath173 ##s . we perform source recovery experiments to increase the accuracy and precision of our selection , following @ xcite . to do this , we insert and select the galaxies with an srsic luminosity profile in the sample . half of the sources follow a typical vaucouleurs profile ( srsic index @ xmath174 ) , and the other half follow an exponential profile ( srsic index @ xmath175 ) , spanning a range of wavelengths ( @ xmath176) , moments ( @ xmath177 ) and moments ( logarithmic distribution with mean 0175 at @ xmath178 , scaling at @ xmath179 ) . the spectra of the sources are modeled by the law @ xmath180 with @ xmath181 ( gaussian distribution ) with a sharp cut - off at zero - point @ xmath182 . the spectral parameters of the individual sources are calculated with the wfc3 algorithm for each individual filter , before being entered into the borg _ library at random positions . sources are then identified with , and the statistics of the detection process is quantified . this is by the law of @ xmath183 which is the probability of the source detection , that is the probability of identifying an artificial source of magnitude @ xmath184 within the sample , and of @ xmath185 , which is the probability of identifying an artificial source of magnitude @ xmath184 and redshift @ xmath24 within the same sample , assuming that the source is detected . an example of the selection process for the source detection in field borg _ 0440 - 5244 is .in the bottom panel of section [ figvolume ] , and the top panel of the same figure shows the total effective volume probe by our search for the borg _ fields as a function of the apparent @ xmath46 magnitude . + derived from simulations , as a function of the apparent @ xmath46 magnitude . bottom panel : an example of the selection function @ xmath185 for sources borg _ 0440 - 5244 . the selection function is derived from simulations , by searching and counting the sources . [ figvolume ] , [ = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] from the figure in section [ contamination ] , we expect the two brightest sources to be likely , because of their low half - light ##ness , and we exclude the single - source source borg _ 1459 + 7146 _ 785 as well . for the other three , we expect a minimum value of @ xmath170 , e . g . we expect two sources to be likely @ xmath3 . after taking into account the effective volume probed by our selection , our estimate for the bright - ness of the selection function at @ xmath3 is : intable [ table3 ] , and shown in table [ figlf ] . overall , we infer a lower number density of these sources than previous observations of @ xcite around @ xmath186 , although the density is relatively high because of the large number of candidates . for brighter sources ( @ xmath187 ) , our upper limits on @ xmath3 density are similar to those found in legacy fields , and strengthen the evidence for suppression of the presence of galaxies at the bright - end of the distribution curve . when compared to the initial results from the ongoing borg [ z9 - 10 ] and @ xcite , indicating that our two brightest sources contain low - redshift contaminants , we did not find clusters of ultra - bright ( @ xmath188 ) galaxies in the field covering more than twice the area . if follow - up observations of our brightest sources indicate that they are also at high density , we would therefore conclude that the lf is less at the bright end than the upper limit from @ xcite , and is instead consistent with the measurements by @ xcite and @ xmath189 . overall , our density determination is higher , and more consistent with @ xmat##h190 with the theoretical model of @ xcite , shown in the two images in image [ figlf ] . previous studies did not find satisfactory solutions to the @ xmath3 lf , mainly because of the large number of candidates . to evaluate the accuracy of the solution with our additional datapoints , we attempt to derive schechter parameters for a maximum tight fit to the original lf data , starting out with a poisson distribution for the number of galaxies expected in the sample ( see @ xcite ) . due to the non - detection of @ xmath191 and @ xcite , the distribution is large at the other points . this leads to a likelihood landscape that is very large over a large area of the sample space , and therefore , we are unable to accurately constrain the schechter parameters . our current attempt thus shows that the dataset is still too small for the fit constraints , but that improvements in the number of candidates identified will require rapid improvement . however , we note that our calculations rely on the assumption that the two new sources we identified in field borg _ 0240 - 1857 are contaminants . if we were to include them in the sample as @ xmath3 sources, we would infer that the results would favor a power law at the other end , rather than a schechter form . evidence for a single or double power - law effect at high redshift has been seen in determinations of the lf at @ xmath192 ( @ xcite , but also considered as @ xcite ) , and potentially at @ xmath11 and @ xcite , and may be naturally produced as a result in mass loss from processes such as agn decay at high redshift @ xcite . gravitational effects , however , can not produce this effect in an otherwise schechter - like system . therefore , the proper interpretation of our search results relies on follow - up observations to establish the existence of the candidates borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 129 and borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 369 . in any case , it is also interesting to note that the number of possible candidate @ xmath34 - 36 that we have is small ( just six in over ##flow fields ) , making our searches cost - efficient , especially because most of the candidates are found in a single sample . + @ xmath193 & @ xmath194 + @xmath195 & @ xmath196 + @ xmath197 & @ xmath198 in this paper we presented the search for @ xmath19 ##5 - archival data of the 2010 - 2014 group of reionizing galaxies ( borg [ z8 ] ) survey , a visible - light optical and near - infrared survey using _ hst _ / wfc3 . since the survey was unable to identify @ xmath4 galaxies as @ xmath45 - dropouts , we searched in the first 293 arcmin @ xmath5 of the survey for @ xmath38 - bright sources with @ xmath199 , followed by the identification of these bright sources with @ xmath200 . our final results are : * we identify six @ xmath39 galaxy clusters , located in @ xmath46 - m / z @ xmath6 and satisfying a standard @ xmath65 color criterion with co - existence of bluer members of the survey . the observed brightness ##es vary from @ xmath201 to @ xmath202 . analysis of the brightness and ##es led to the tentative identification of three contaminants , with the two beingfive likely are high redshift dwarf galaxies due to their size , and one faint source a galactic red dwarf galaxy because of the compact ##ness and low stellarity . * of the five sources , three are in the galactic field , borg _ 0240 - 1857 , including the two brightest of the three . * strong clustering would be naturally possible if the source were @ xmath3 ( not @ xcite ) , despite the indication from @ xmath129 , but an alternative explanation of non - strong clustering at high redshift would not be possible . * based on our current understanding of the universe , we expect a higher galaxy number density for sources like @ xmath186 compared to the estimates of bouwens et al . ( 2015a , b ) and with the original model of smith et al . ( 2015b ) . however , our measurement is still consistent at the @ xmath13 ##9 with these observations . * irrespective of the nature of the three brightest sources in the universe , the selection criteria that we adopted left a small number of candidates , very unlikely for follow - up observations . this is not surprising , since the borg [ z8 ] model was not designed with @ xmath11never mind , and the number of candidates could have been much higher given the absence of a visible absorption band and the presence of a near - infrared color to help distinguish passive and compact intermediate redshift sources . * targeted follow - up observations will efficiently clarify the properties of the candidates we identified , and to further clarify the bright - end of the lf and characterize the properties of the yet unknown population of compact passive and active galaxies that mimic the colors of @ xmath203 sources . the efficiency of targeted follow - ups and the overall potential to improve observations for @ xmath3 sources traditionally carried out in other galaxies are demonstrated by the most recent arrival of _ spitzer _ irac time to our team to investigate the properties of the sources discussed above ( see # 12058 , van bouwens ) . with these observations , it will be possible to clarify the nature of the bright end of the galaxy of @ xmath3 , as well as to select suitable targets for further targeted follow - up investigations without having to wait for _ james webb space telescope _ . p , j , and jw from the vatican observatory , where most of this work was carried out , for their hospitality. this discovery was also confirmed by the _ hst _ / images 13767 , 12905 , and 12572 . this survey was funded by the australian research council centre of excellence for all -
