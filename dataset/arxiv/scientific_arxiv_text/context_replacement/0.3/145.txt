the study of ultracold matter waves can now , more easily , be performed on microchip or thin films @ xcite . in these materials , the quantum state of the dilute atomic state dominates over the classical , enabling effective matter wave control @ xcite . one of the key advantages in using the ` ` atom gas ' ' to perform atom optics is the ability to transport atoms from one atom optical component to another . here , we present models of wave propagation through atoms with idealized behavior consisting of sudden changes to the transverse optical potential . an increase ( decrease ) in the tranverse confining potential results in a decrease ( increase ) in the free energy along the path of wave propagation , increasing effective step potentials along the path . the present study is conducted in three ways . firstly , recent experiments have demonstrated a significant increase of a bose - einstein coupling ( bec ) in a region located close to the surfaces @ xcite , due , at least in part , to imperfections created during the optical relaxation processes @ xcite . secondly , to further explain some of the challenges to designing atom optics systems that are based on variations of the waveguide potentials , for example , the smoothly varying wide anglethe wire geometry has been proposed as a non - non - contact optical device for atoms @ xcite . thirdly , the literature has been lacking for multimode analysis of some of the simplest optical geometries , as it has been recently shown that introducing a perturbation into the waveguide can result in the transverse effects of the bec @ xcite . to understand the phenomenon of transverse effects , here we explore the schrdinger wave theory of waveguides with step - like , wave - like and wave - like potentials in the direction of propagation . there have also been some experimental investigations involving time - independent calculations of the propagation through abrupt potentials such as a bottleneck ( step - up ) and a smooth termination ( also step - down ) in the limit of non - contact atoms @ xcite , while non - linear ( atom - atom ) interactions in the wave - type geometry have also been examined @ xcite . the advantage in studying abrupt potentials whilst studying atom - atom interactions is that simple time - independent assumptions can be used to calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients . under these assumptions , we have already observed a circular bend @ xcite , which consists of an abrupt transitionfrom the linear waveguides into the bend and the low - end behaves like a potential flow . our multimode model , restricted as it is to the the linear regime , provides a baseline for comparison of bec propagation through non - one - dimensional ( 1 - d ) waveguides including the transverse degrees of freedom . for example , previous space - independent experiments have demonstrated non - linear wave propagation through shallow - well , step and wedge shaped 1 - d channels @ xcite . very simple nonlinear potentials could be generated by using the quantum confinement , where measurements of the optical excitation spectrum , in the nonlinear and linear limits , should be made . for ground - matter waves travelling at high energy through the local perturbations , the experimental results show that the modes rapidly change from single - moded , with the transmission and reflection of excited modes . the high - energy spectrum sees @ xmath0 ##3 , and we present a mathematical model to describe the propagation of the excited modes that combines the distribution of the mode wave ##form with the multi - mode interference of the modes . there are a number of atom - wire devices that can create sees @ xcite , and we follow the theoretical ansatzadopted from refs . that is , we assume that the systems consist of an idealized trapping medium that is quadratic to the frequency and operate at low matter - matter interactions so that atom - atom interactions can be neglected . furthermore , assuming that the two potentials correspond to an ideal 2d system , the systems are assumed to be characterized by random wire interactions with abrupt changes in the spacing of the wires , such that the frequency and the position of the potential ##s remain constant along the waveguide . the out - of - phase quantum number is then a conserved quantity . we consider the harmonic oscillator ( sho ) confining potentials , which , for barrier - like or well - like effective systems , are given by @ xmath1 the barrier - like potential has @ xmath2 ; the well - like potential has @ xmath3 . the step - like potential consists of only a change in frequency . these units are used throughout this article , where frequencies are in units of @ xmath4 , and lengths are given in units of @ xmath5 . an example step - like potential is shown in fig . [ 1 : abruptpot ] ( 2 ) , where thethe path between @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 . ( a ) the energy surface of the box - like structure with @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 and the barrier @ xmath8 . ( b ) energy surface of the barrier and the transverse sho potential along @ xmath9 . the solid lines along @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 should be drawn , but they are drawn on the axis to show the lead - level relationship . the dot - matrix lines correspond to the non - leading leads ( with an independent incoming mode ) . all the symbols and coordinates are given in terms of si units for the leads . , width = 336 ] the corresponding energy levels of fig . ( [ eqn : pots2d ] ) are shown in fig . [ fig : abruptpot ] ( 2 ) . these energy levels act as effective potentials for the wave motion since we partition the total wavefunction of each region into the corresponding coherent states . in this case , all coupling between modes occurs through the matching between states . the potentials of fig . ( [ eqn : pots2d ] ) are fig . @ xmath12 .that parity in @ xmath12 is conserved , extends the theoretical analysis and results considerably [ the double - dashed lines in fig . [ 1 : abruptpot ] ( b ) are not related to the solid lines ] . in experiments , this would most likely be off - center , resulting in splitting of the modes ( as was possible in our previous study of the sharp bend @ xcite ) . the fundamental physics , however , remained much the same , so we chose to adopt energy - independent methods with the plane waves restricted to the ground ( z ) - mode . to perform the time - independent calculations , we initially adopted the transfer matrix method @ xcite , although most of the calculations reported in this paper use the interface matrix method @ xcite . the two approaches are complementary , however , and since the transfer matrix method facilitates the interpretation of our results , we use it here . the transformation of the transfer matrix method from one - transverse to two transverse degrees of freedom is trivial @ xcite , so only a short summary is given , and it reduces to the barrier / mesh - free geometry of the @ xmath13 . however , the time - independent wavefunction is based on the sho ##als, @ xmath14 for : @ xmath15 , and @ xmath16 for @ xmath17 : @ xmath18 \ le z \ le z _ 0 \ ; , \ \ \ psi _ \ mathrm { ii } ( x , z ) & = \ sum _ m \ kappa _ n ( x ) \ ; \ big [ c _ n e ^ { i \ kappa _ m ( z - z _ 0 ) } + d _ m e ^ { - i \ kappa _ m ( z - z _ 0 ) } \ big ] \ quad z _ 1 \ le i \ le z _ 1 \ ; , \ \ \ psi _ \ mathrm { iii } ( x , z ) & = \ sum _ m \ varphi _ n ( x ) \ ; \ big [ c _ n e ^ { i k _ n ( z - z _ 0 ) } + d _ n e ^ { - i k _ n ( z - z _ 0 ) } \ big ] \ quad z _ 1 \ le z \ ; . \ end { . } \ ] ] where the coefficients are @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 . matching the wavefunctions and theirfirst derivatives across each mode and then working out the modes yields the following sets of coefficients : @ xmath21 the matrix coefficients of each submatrix are @ xmath22 using the method @ xmath23 . while generating functions are known for the existence of sho - functions with different coefficients @ xcite ( such functions are often found in calculations of interactions between molecular transition modes @ xcite ) , we performed the transverse analysis method using a 3 - d method . the scattering matrix is obtained by using the transfer equation @ xmath24 , which relates one ' s coefficients , @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 , to the scattering coefficients , @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 . given that the scattering is proportional to incoming from @ xmath29 in the same mode ( @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 , and @ xmath32 ) , the transfer equation @ xmath33 is obtained , and computed @ xmath34 . the transmission and scattering coefficients for each mode are then given by : @ xmath35 there are some difficulties with the transfer matrix method , the details and discussion of which are now relegated to the appendix . seebrief , the problems are related to the approximate convergence of the sho overlaps @ xmath36 with @ xmath37 , which requires the inclusion of strongly closed channels , leading to the existence of large exponentials in the transfer matrix . although the transfer matrix method avoids the need to find intermediate coefficients ( ie . @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 ) , it was still found to be unstable for the smallest of the perturbations given in this paper . the interface matching method , in contrast , explicitly solves for the intermediate coefficients and is required to include strongly closed channels to achieve the machine - precision convergence for the range of temperatures and pressures given in this paper . the transfer matrix method works well , however , for step - like potential with a single interface ( ie . @ xmath40 ) as there are large exponentials in the transfer matrix , and thus , all the coefficients are explicitly solved for . the multimoded scattering and reflection probabilities for three different geometries are given in this paper : the step - like potential , the barrier - like potential and the well - known potential . the calculations for the step - like potential use the transfer matrix method , while interface matching is used for thewall - like and the wall - like potentials . by doing these calculations , it is instructive to see how the three overlap @ xmath36 vary with frequency . the @ xmath36 dependence on the frequency ratio @ xmath41 is important , since it strongly affects the amount of mode overlap shared by the two modes . using the orthonormality of the sho eigenstates , along with the recursion rule of the hermite polynomials , it can be shown that the overlap integrals of the @ xmath42 even mode with the @ xmath17 odd mode lead to the following general form : @ xmath43 for the @ xmath44 . due to this , @ xmath45 for @ xmath46 . ( [ eqn : overlaps ] ) was first obtained by aslangul @ xcite . the dependence of the first three overlap ( @ xmath47 ) on frequency is shown in fig .

( a ) shows the @ xmath47 modes as a function of @ xmath17 . the numbers followed by @ xmath49 indicate the mode . ( b ) shows the modes as a function of @ xmath37 for four modes : @ xmath50 ( square ) , @ xmath51 ( round - triangle ) , @ xmath52 ( hollow - triangle ) and @ xmath53 ( square ) . the lines and modes in ( a ) are added to focus the attention . the modes present in both ( a ) and ( b ) are measured in frequency units equal to @ xmath15 . , width = 336 ] for @ xmath54 , there is a perfect frequency match , and we can substitute @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 for @ xmath57 . as @ xmath17 increases , @ xmath58 monotonically decreases towards 0 . at the same time , the overlap with each excited mode decreases and reaches a maximum when the last equation , @ xmath59 , is solved . as a function of frequency , these equations result in @ xmath60 , which , for @ xmath##61 , is @ xmath62 and for @ xmath63 , is @ xmath64 . comparing the width ( @ xmath65 ) of the sho functions at these frequencies against the ground mode s reveals that @ xmath66 . this connection , although useful , is not very useful and is not investigated further any further . at the maxima , the overlaps slowly decay as @ xmath67 to zero . due to symmetry of the system @ xmath41 , a new maxima of @ xmath48 ##0 appears as @ xmath68 . the exponential decay of the overlaps with the ground modes can be seen in fig . [ fig : omegadependence ] ( 2 ) . this means that , even at low energies , several closed systems must be included in the above scheme to achieve computational convergence . the transmission and propagation characteristics , @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 , of ground mode plane - waves traversing four box - like structures are shown in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] . at incident energies above the critical energy threshold ( @ xmath71 , the critical ground state threshold ) , the system is##s like the familiar 3 - d step system . ground mode transmission , @ xmath72 , is the dominant mode across the range of channels shown in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ( a ) ( for the range of @ xmath17 examined here ) , although excited mode transmission can also be seen in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ( a ) as the mode decreases . the transmission is seen into the excited @ xmath73 channel in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ( b ) , which also drops off from above . as the scattering potential increases , the transmission into the excited mode @ xmath74 , seen in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ( a ) , increases , then is expected to be an overall decrease . all of which is consistent with the wigner radiation laws for multichannel transmission @ xcite . multimoded transmission consists of step - down potentials which consist of a very small change in the transverse scattering potential from @ xmath42 to @ xmath50 , @ xmath75 , @ xmath76 , and @ xmath77 . the incoming electrons are in the ground state @ x##math78 . ( a ) gives @ xmath72 and @ xmath79 , the reflection energies into the ground mode and the sum of the transmission energies into the excited modes , respectively . ( b ) gives @ xmath80 , the reflection probabilities into the ground mode , and ( c ) gives @ xmath81 , the sum of the transmission probabilities into the excited modes . the total transmission @ xmath82 is measured in ground mode relative to @ xmath15 . the values of ( a ) and ( b ) are the total transmission and reflection probabilities for the 2 - d mode and for the incidence of @ xmath52 ( ie . of height @ xmath83 with the background potential @ xmath84 used to correct the lower ground mode threshold ) . , [ = 336 ] for incidence in the open mode , the total transmission approaches @ xmath0 in the transmission energy range . in this case the transmission energy is given simply by @ xmath85 with the sho overlaps of eq . ( [ eqn : overlaps ] ) . these limits were introduced as part of the mathexperiments of jskelinen and stenholm @ xcite , in which the transmission line probabilities affected by the zero and zero - potential ##s were briefly studied as the temperature moved towards abrupt . the multimode effects have also been briefly studied during conversion of a bec from a microtrap into a waveguide @ xcite , with an emphasis on the effects of atom - atom interactions . equation ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) can be viewed as the high - energy limit of the matrix element of @ xmath86 , given by : . ( [ eqn : 2 ] ) . at sufficiently high compared to the step length , the values of the two energy modes are approximately the same on both sides of the step , @ xmath87 . assuming that the overlaps affect the number of electrons involved , the matrix elements that dominate the @ xmath40 transfer matrix are : @ xmath88 , while @ xmath89 . for an incoming wave in the ground mode with @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 , and @ xmath90 , then the outgoing waves have @ xmath91 , @ xmath##92 . to more clearly show this effect , the images of fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] are replotted in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] on the x axis scaled by @ xmath17 instead of @ xmath15 so that the reflection lines for each mode open at the same scaled angle . the scattering probabilities of the same four ground - like modes in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ( @ xmath50 , @ xmath75 , @ xmath76 , and @ xmath77 ) plotted here are a multiple of @ xmath93 , where @ xmath94 . for a waveguide , ( a ) are the scattering probability of the ground mode , ( b ) the sum of the ground mode scattering probabilities @ xmath79 , and ( c ) the total scattering probability @ xmath95 . the reflections at @ xmath96 correspond to the @ xmath97 - mode . , [ = 336 ] at high energies , the scattering is shown in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] ( [) increase towards maximum of @ xmath98 , in accordance with eq . ( [ eqn : project ] ) . for the four transmission modes shown here , the values are @ xmath99 , @ xmath100 , @ xmath101 , and @ xmath102 . both [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] ( b ) and ( c ) show that at the end of a transmission mode ( ie . , @ xmath103 etc . ) the transmission energy into that mode increases , increasing flux from it . the change in the wavefunctions for @ xmath52 , for example , is more significant , with @ xmath104 , @ xmath105 , @ xmath106 , and @ xmath107 [ per fig . [ fig : omegadependence ] ( c ) ] . in this case , these four transmission modes must be maintained until the maximum value of [ @ xmath108 , as per fig . ( [ eqn : project ] ) ] is reached to reach @ xmath109 . whether the wave is transmitted from the left orthe following , these results apply . the ground wave transmission @ xmath110 is _ _ identical _ as a function of the transmission @ xmath82 for both the waveguide expansion ( ie . step - up from @ xmath42 to @ xmath111 ) , and the phase expansion ( ie . step - down from @ xmath112 to @ xmath54 ) this result also applies for the full 3 - d step geometry , and , although we do not show this explicitly , the transmission and reflection mode mixing conspires to ensure this is not the case in the multichannel system . the mode mixing as a function of @ xmath82 is different for each geometry , however , since for the step - up , there can be many reflection channels open at the highest transmission frequency , @ xmath113 , while for the step - down , there can be many reflection channels open at @ xmath113 . for high frequencies , neither of the two geometries generates reflection , and for most of the reflection mode the limits from above . ( [ eqn : project ] ) apply . to understand the concept of a reflection channel - like potential , wefor the example shown in fig . [ fig : abruptpot ] , for a fixed length @ xmath114 and with that range from @ xmath42 to @ xmath2 and back to @ xmath42 . we also consider the high - energy potential for samples from this potential . the scattering and absorption properties for the line constrictions @ xmath50 , @ xmath75 , @ xmath76 , @ xmath77 and with @ xmath115 are shown in fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] . multimoded modulation probabilities of the barrier - like regions with @ xmath50 , @ xmath75 , @ xmath76 , and @ xmath77 for a fixed length @ xmath115 as a function of @ xmath82 ( in si units equal to @ xmath15 ) . the formula for the modulation frequencies is the same as fig . ( [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ) and ( [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] ) . the organisation of the measurements is also the same as fig . ( [ fig: stepwithenergy ] ) . the crosses in ( a ) and ( b ) are the analytic ##ity and reflection lines for a 1 - d surface potential for the height of @ xmath116 ( viz . of height @ xmath117 with the surface potential @ xmath84 ) . , [ = 336 ] , occur in most of the spectra at low energies due to the weak boundary of @ xmath118 . the 1 - d analytic lines for @ xmath116 , fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] ( b ) show the strong resonances as the result of low - energy excited - mode propagation through the medium . as soon as the @ xmath42 , @ xmath119 mode opens at @ xmath120 , however , multichannel physics takes over ( @ xmath121 is not open due to symmetry ) . above @ xmath120 , there is no ground mode at [ fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] ( a ) ] , but the effects of propagation into the ground mode [ fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] ( b ) ] and the excited mode [ fig . [ fig : barrier##withenergy ] ( c ) ] is significant across the energy limit . to observe the high - energy limit , the results for the @ xmath52 mode of fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] were scaled to higher energies , and are shown in fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergyscaled ] with the potential scaled to @ xmath122 . the scattering energies of the @ xmath52 , @ xmath115 , barrier - induced . ##s in fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] modes are all a function of @ xmath93 where @ xmath122 . ( a ) shows the total scattering energies of the @ xmath123 modes and the sum of the transmission probabilities for the @ xmath124 modes . ( b ) shows the ground - state scattering probabilities as well as the sum of the excited mode reflection energies . the crosses of ( c ) correspond to the @ xmath125 two - dimensional scattering modes of fig . ( [ eqn : interf ] ) . the first cross of @ xmath126 reaches nearly close to 0 , which is not possible due to thelimited energy resolution of the figure . , width = 336 ] figure [ fig : barrierwithenergyscaled ] ( b ) shows that while there is more structure in the reflection probabilities than for the step - like potential in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] ( c ) , the total probability of reflection occurring tends towards zero as more barrier modes are added to @ xmath127 . to obtain an expression similar to fig . ( [ eqn : project ] ) , we must take into account the fact that the transmitted waves passing through the barrier experience at least two interface projections as in eq . ( [ eqn : project ] ) . the phases generated while propagating the length @ xmath114 of the barrier should also be included in such a calculation , which suggests that at high energies ( close to the barrier threshold ) @ xmath128 where @ xmath37 is simply summed over the remaining barrier modes . the results presented in fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergyscaled ] ( a ) show that the two - dimensional version of this model does a better job of calculating the reflection probability at the @ xmath61 barrier threshold ( where @xmath129 ) . depending on the phase difference , the modes that are excited at the first interface can be converted back to the ground mode by the second interface . we also see this effect in circular pipe bends @ xcite , where the amount of excitation could be reduced by changing the angle made out by the bend to the point where the accumulated phase difference between the @ xmath130 and @ xmath121 interfaces is a function of @ xmath131 . a similar theoretical approach could also be useful for other bends , such as the quantum dot bends @ xcite , where the as yet unwanted mode excitations could be suppressed by varying the angle between the changes in waveguide potentials . the transmission and reflection probabilities for helix - like bends due to a central bulge ( @ xmath132 ) are the same in this last section . the resonance behavior for a well is complicated by the presence of bound electrons which translate into the presence of feshbach holes in a multichannel problem . much of the resonance physics seen here has been previously discussed as part of our studies of the circular pipe bends @ xcite . the scattering effects in a bend are :lower than the connecting potential @ xcite , resulting in very weakly interacting leads and very narrow resonances . the resulting well - like potential can have extreme differences between the peak and low peak states , and thus the possibility of multiple large resonances located near the peak . two bulges are also possible , the first from @ xmath133 to @ xmath54 and back to @ xmath133 , and the second with @ xmath134 to @ xmath54 and back to @ xmath134 . in both cases , we take @ xmath54 to be the actual well length , to allow the comparison with the one in the previous section . the transmission and scattering properties of both of these systems with fixed length @ xmath115 are shown in fig . [ 2 : wellwithenergy ] . multimoded scattering consists of two well - like potential with @ xmath133 and @ xmath75 for a fixed length @ xmath115 as a function of @ xmath82 ( with oscillator units equal to @ xmath17 ) . the intensity of the scatteringis the same as above . [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] . the lines in ( 1 ) correspond to the @ xmath125 two - mode [ ##s of fig . ( [ eqn : interf ] ) for @ xmath134 . , x = 336 ] multiple @ xmath0 reflection lines occur at energies below the first excited mode - energy , ie . above @ xmath135 for @ xmath133 and @ xmath136 for @ xmath134 . as was noted in our forward motion experiment @ xcite , the reflection lines below the second excited mode ( ie . below @ xmath137 for @ xmath133 , and above @ xmath138 for @ xmath134 ) do not result in complete reflection due to the reduced coupling between the second and first excited modes and due to the existence of multiple pathways to reflection . the high - energy transmission probability asymptotes for the well - known model are also given by fig . ( [ eqn : interf ] ) , although the energy of the first excited mode in the well means that the two - mode transmission probability at @ x##math120 ( in other words , at a lower energy than for the equivalent barrier - like system ) . the two - mode model is shown in fig . [ fig : wellwithenergy ] ( a ) for the @ xmath134 system , and is seen to be a reasonable approximation at the @ xmath120 threshold due to the significant reflection probability . the two - mode model also provides a reasonable approximation at higher energies when the total reflection probability has dropped below the total excited mode transmission probability , and also when the very large reflection resonances no longer play a role . systems with very high energies such as @ xmath139 and @ xmath77 were also explored . they have so many resonance in the range of energies shown in fig . [ fig : wellwithenergy ] , however , that the transmission and reflection probability have become a continuous series of equally - spaced straight lines . at energies near the total excited mode threshold ( @ xmath140 ) , there are not so many resonance , although there remains significant reflection probability . as an example , the @ xmath141 , @ xmath115 , well - known system has a large reflectionand at @ xmath142 ( @ xmath143 ) that has only dropped down to about @ xmath144 . this reflection probability can be compared with the @ xmath52 , @ xmath115 barrier - like geometry in general . [ fig : barrierwithenergyscaled ] ( b ) at @ xmath142 ( @ xmath96 ) , where the total reflection probability is only about @ xmath145 . in other words , reflections play a much more dominant role for the barrier - like geometry than the barrier - like . using time - dependent solutions of the schrdinger equation , we have studied the propagation of dilute , ultracold noble gases through rapidly changing waveguide potentials . previous papers have discussed the consequences for ` ` adiabatic ' ' gas propagation through microstructures ( eg . ) . in contrast , the interest here was in the consequences of abrupt potential ##s for optical excitation with a view towards the # ##s , examining the effects of such abrupt potentials in complex optical systems , and simply to study the behavior of such complex systems . for idealized systems with changes in the potentialthese potential ##s been the focus of research : step - like , wave - like and well - defined . the low - energy behavior of all the modes differs from single - moded , with the exception of the small perturbations at frequencies with the lowest energy threshold . the loss of the transmission and reflection excited modes was caused by the coupling of the modes at the interfaces between the two sections . the negative coupling to the modes is due to the large overlap of the reflected sho function of one frequency with the excited sho function with a different frequency . therefore , care should be taken during the fabrication of the optical elements to ensure that any deliberate ( or not ) changes in a waveguides transverse frequency are not observed . high energy wave transmission through these potentials amounts to @ xmath0 wave transmission via reflection at the interface , along with multimode interference . the reflected sho - type waveguides behave very differently than the hard - wired methods for ballistic electron transmission through waveguides with a wide - angle junction ( see ref . @ xcite , and the sections below that describe it ) . in that case an impedence mismatch occurs , where there is always some loss of energy at high energies due to thefact that the narrow ground modes can accurately represent the wide guide modes over the entire length of the lead . although , to the best of our knowledge , designs for such electron beams have always discussed high - low / wide f ##s and their properties . a special case was added for high energy transmission through microstructures with ground modes to account for the interference between them . it was found that a simple single - mode model would be a reasonable approximation to the amount of ground mode interference , and was an additional consideration for the design of ` ` atom - chip ' ' devices to control single - moded electron - transmission - potentials that produce multimoded signals . this work was supported by the department of the navy , office of naval research , and later by the research corporation . our transfer matrix program was developed by reproducing the single - mode calculations of wave propagation in a linear array of 1 - d channels @ xcite , and then by comparing with multi - moded 2 - d signals from the interface at channel @ xcite . the multimode transfer matrix method , however , has some convergence difficulties as the number of modes included in the calculation increases . this behavior can be seen in table [ tab : transcon##v ] , for particles with high surface energy @ xmath82 has a spin - free state with @ xmath146 of + @ xmath147 . the unitarity of the scattering of particles differs significantly from @ xmath148 , especially when @ xmath149 is used . the results of experiments are , for example , and they differ from the experimental results . lcccc & & + @ xmath149 & @ xmath150 & unitarity & @ xmath150 & unitarity + + 1 & 0 . 00339154 & & 0 . 999976 & + + 1 & 0 . 00381548 & 0 . 2394 @ xmath151 & 0 . 124973 & 0 . 2500 @ xmath152 + 1 & 0 . 00267029 & 0 . 0328 @ xmath153 & 0 . 772832 & 0 . 2616 @ xmath154 + 1 & 0 . 00274164 & 0 . 8303 @ xmath155 & 0 . 804769 & 0 . 1844 @ xmath151 + 1 & 0. 00274223 & 0 . 1060 @ xmath155 & 0 . 807601 & 0 . 4533 @ xmath156 + 4 & 0 . 00264476 & 0 . 4352 @ xmath157 & 0 . 849707 & 0 . 4386 @ xmath154 + + 2 & 0 . 00339154 & 1 . 3307 @ xmath158 & 0 . 999976 & 0 . 0912 @ xmath158 + 4 & 0 . 00270062 & 0 . 4129 @ xmath159 & 0 . 795176 & 0 . 3826 @ xmath154 + 4 & 0 . 00274192 & 0 . 7813 @ xmath160 & 0 . 805169 & 0 . 1198 @ xmath157 + 4 & 0 . 00274223 & 0 . 5390 @ xmath161 & 0 . 807546 & 0 . 5052 @ xmath153 + 4 & 0 . 00277009 & 0 . 0555 @ xmath157 & 0 . 916579& 0 . 6275 @ xmath154 + + 1 & 0 . 00339154 & 2 . 2204 @ xmath158 & 0 . 999976 & + + 1 & 0 . 00270062 & 0 . 1102 @ xmath158 & 0 . 795176 & 0 . 3826 @ xmath154 + 8 & 0 . 00274192 & 3 . 3307 @ xmath158 & 0 . 805169 & 3 . 1198 @ xmath157 + 16 & 0 . 00274223 & 1 & 0 . 807605 & 0 . 8357 @ xmath161 + 16 & 0 . 00274223 & 7 . 4409 @ xmath158 & 0 . 807607 & 0 . 6739 @ xmath162 + 16 & 0 . 00274223 & 1 . 1102 @ xmath158 & 0 . 807607 & 2 . 2205 @ xmath158 + in an attempt to solve the transfer matrix problem , a second method for computing the transfer matrix was developed . this second method involved adding the following@ xmath163 , @ xmath164 with matrix elements , @ xmath165 , and @ xmath166 while the matrix elements of @ xmath86 of fig . ( [ eqn : mes ] ) were extended to include the @ xmath167 terms . the exact values of the @ xmath168 are also given in the [ 1 : transconv ] , and the unitarity results for the cross - correlation calculation , it is very unstable , if not worse that @ xmath169 . for the cases considered in this paper the transfer matrix approach is not able to adequately apply to the full range of values . the exception to this is for the lattice - based geometry , where for the most important cases in this paper ( cf . [ 1 : stepwithenergyscaled ] : @ xmath170 and @ xmath142 ) @ xmath171 modes could not be found ( since the transfer matrix contains no # ##s , and the modes are easily solved for ) . we also find that , since the @ xmath172 overlaps are all linear , obtaining them is much easier for the network interface matching .than for multiple circular - bend calculations using the same method @ xcite . for the most extreme barrier - based calculation ( ref . [ category : barrierwithenergyscaled ] : @ xmath170 , @ xmath115 and @ xmath142 ) , the interface matching method increases unitarity to better than @ xmath173 with @ xmath174 combined . some of the transfer matrix convergence issues are passingly noted by _ _ et . al _ @ xcite , where the transfer matrix approach was not applied to a system of multiple circular bends ( the transfer matrix is instead represented as a number of independent elements ) . in the end , however , the calculations described in ref . @ xcite were performed using the interface matching . we conclude at this point since no such unitarity issues were noted in the multichannel transfer matrix version of ref . @ xcite , where the examples given are for 2 and 3 channel calculations with delta potentials . on the other hand , the advantage of the transfer matrix approach is that , in the two - mode approximation , we can easily obtain the transmission characteristics of both finite and infinite channel delta potentials @ xcite .
