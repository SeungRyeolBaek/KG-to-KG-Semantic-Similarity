one of the most important topic of theoretical research in recent years is the characterization of the behaviour of bosonic many - body system in the unitary regime @ xcite . by solving the feshbach equation the two - body scattering length @ xmath1 is tuned to very high values . the unitary regime is characterized by simple conservation laws . for an isolated quantum bose gas , the quantum like state becomes unstable as @ xmath1 â†’ @ xcite . studying the efimov effect in quantum three - body systems leads to the possibility of theory . efimov effect appears at the three - body level ( @ xmath0 = 3 ) where the attractive two - body interaction is such that the scattering length is much larger than the range of the energy . under such condition , a variety of weakly interacting and spatially extended states of efimov character appear in the system . although the efimov character and ultracold behaviour of the gas is well understood , the theoretical studies of bosonic system with large scattering length are limited . however , @ xmath2 is a well studied quantum three - body system in this regime @ xcite , its first quantum state is theoretically stable as of efimov ., however no experimental data is still reported . whereas the recent experimental observations of efimov phenomena in ultracold gas have generated interest in the study of universality in few - body coupled systems @ xcite but the extension of efimov properties for larger systems ( @ xmath3 ) is not possible . there are several studies in this area which study the universality of the system @ xcite . the results and conclusions made in these studies are that similar quantitative differences exist . this requires further investigation of universal properties of bosonic cluster state having efimov properties . + in this work we study non - bosonic states of @ xmath4rb ##s interacting with van der waals molecules . our interest also comes from recent observations of weakly bound clusters created from ultracold bose gases . at the feshbach scale the effective interatomic energy can be easily reduced to any desired value . for weakly interacting dilute molecules , the efimov state appears at equilibrium ( @ xmath5 ) . our motivation is to study the near equilibrium behaviour of weakly bound three - dimensional clusters . to characterize this complex behaviour we prescribe two - body coupled basis functions for the two - body cluster state .shape - invariant two - body van der waals potential . we hope that our future papers will explore the physical properties of three - dimensional bosonic systems near the unitary . the calculation of the potential with a short range repulsive core and long - range attractive core @ xmath6 may give a conclusion as well . more complex results are expected . the paper is summarized as follows . in fig . ii we present the many - body hamiltonian and its calculation . iii discuss the results and exhibit the signature of universal cluster theory with efimov character . iv concludes with a conclusion . we can solve the many - body schrdinger equation using partial harmonic expansion method ( phem ) . we have also applied phem to solve the equations of bose einstein cluster @ xcite and galaxy cluster @ xcite . the method has been described in detail in our earlier paper @ xcite . we will explain the method below for our readers . we consider a system of @ xmath7 @ xmath4rb ##s , independent of the @ xmath8 and interacting via two - body potential . the hamiltonian of the system is given by @ xmath9 here @ xmath10 is the two - body potential and @xmath11 is the position vector of the @ xmath12th particle . it is usual practice to decompose the motion of a many - body system into the motion of the center of mass where the center of mass motion is @ xmath13 and the relative motion of the atoms in center of mass ##15 . for atomic clusters , the center of mass behaves like a free particle in laboratory conditions and we consider the energy zero . however , we can model the center of mass motion by the standard polar coordinates , denoted by @ xcite @ xmath14 and obtain the hamiltonian for the relative motion of the atoms @ xmath15 here @ xmath16 is the sum of all pair - wise interactions described in terms of polar coordinates . the hyperspherical tensor analysis method ( hhem ) is an _ ab - initio _ complete many - body method and includes all possible correlations . the hyperspherical variables are represented by the hyperradius @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 hyperangular coordinates which are comprised of @ xmath19 in polar coordinates @ xmath20 associated with @ xmath21 jacobi vectors and @ xmath22 hyperangles @xmath23 , by their interaction . however the calculation of potential ##s elements of the pairwise interactions is a formidable task and the convergence rate of the hyperspherical harmonic expansion becomes very slow for @ xmath24 , due to the increasing size of the cluster . thus hhem is not suitable for the study of large single atomic clusters . but for a large m or n - cluster , the two - body separation and pairwise interactions are preserved . thus we can transform the global correlation function @ xmath25 into two - body faddeev and for the global @ xmath26 pair ##wise @ xmath27 it is important to note that @ xmath28 is a function of two - body separation ( @ xmath29 ) and the global @ xmath30 interaction . thus for case of the @ xmath31 interaction pair of the @ xmath0 particle system , the active degrees of freedom are completely reduced to just two , _ viz . _ , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 and the remaining active degrees of freedom are unchanged . since @ xmath25 is divided into two possible interacting and faddeev components , _ is two- the s _ are symmetric . so the final result for a given faddeev equation is that when two particles interact , the rest of the particles interact as ##ert ##s . - the effect of two - particle interaction follows from the two - particle interaction in the same basis . it is to be noted that @ xmath28 is symmetric to the exchange operator @ xmath32 for bosonic atoms and hence the faddeev equation @ xmath33 \ phi _ { ij } = - [ ( \ vec { r } _ { ij } ) \ phi _ { kl > 0 } ^ { r } \ phi _ { kl } \ label { q . faddeev - eqn } \ ] ] where @ xmath34 is the total kinetic energy v . applying the operator @ xmath35 on both sides of v . ( [ q . faddeev - eqn ] ) , we get from the original schrdinger equation . since we know that when ( @ xmath36 ) pair and the rest of the particles are interacting ##ial , the total hyperangular momentum and the total angular momentum of the whole system are contributedfor the interacting components and . next the @ xmath26th faddeev basis is included in the set of spherical harmonic ( ph ) ( which is a kind of hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) basis and used for the partition of @ xmath37 ) and for the ( @ xmath36 ) partition of @ xmath38 @ xmath39 . the resulting set of hyperangles in the @ xmath40 - th dimension corresponding to the @ xmath26 ##th basis and @ xmath41 is called the ph . it has the explicit form : @ xmath42 @ xmath43 is the hh of order zero in the @ xmath44 dimensional space given by @ xmath45 basis vectors ; @ xmath46 is the hyperangle between the @ xmath47 - th basis vector @ xmath48 and the hyperradius @ xmath30 and is given by @ xmath49 = @ xmath50 . for the corresponding @ xmath22 noninteracting component we have hyperradius = @ xmath51 so that @ xmath52 . the number of @ xmath##18 quantum numbers of hh is now reduced to _ _ _ @ xmath53 and for the @ xmath22 non - interacting pair @ xmath54 and for the interacting pair @ xmath55 , @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 . thus the @ xmath40 - schrdinger equation reduces back to a four dimensional equation with the following set of quantum numbers : energy @ xmath58 , the angular momentum quantum number @ xmath59 , the quantum number @ xmath8 and the central quantum number @ xmath60 for energy @ xmath0 . \ ex . ( [ cf . faddeev - n ] ) for eq . ( [ cf . faddeev - eqn ] ) and based on this particular basis , the system of partial differential equations for the partial derivatives @ xmath61 is : @ xmath62u _ { kl } ( r ) + \ displaystyle { \ sum _ { k ^ { \ prime } } } f _ { kl } f _ { kk ^ { \ prime } } ( r ) f _ { k ^ { \ prime} l } { _ { k ^ { \ prime } } } ( r ) = 0 & \ \ \ end { 1 } \ end { eq . cde } \ ] ] + where @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 , @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 . + @ xmath67 is a constant and is the sum of the ph for all states with the sum of the corresponding to all states @ xcite . the potential matrix element @ xmath68 is given by @ xmath69 we do not need the additional long - range correlation coefficient @ xmath70 as described in ref . it is also pointed out that the universal properties of ultracold and atomic particles in the classical case are characterized when the two - dimensional kinetic energy @ xmath1 is reduced to very small values by using the feshbach resonance . although the classical quantum gas has been largely investigated both theoretically and theoretically @ xcite , the bosonic scattering regime is a major problem in the many - particle case . even though the range of the scattering is small compared with the energy separation , interatomic interactions are very strong and the corresponding mean - field equations areinadequate . + the interaction energy of the resulting molecular cloud is parameterized by a single parameter - the @ xmath71 - wave - length . + for our current study to explore the exact nature of the interaction , we consider the van der waals model characterized by two parameters : the effective radius of the central hard shell @ xmath72 and the strength of the long - wavelength tail @ xmath73 . thus with @ xmath73 fixed , it is possible to adjust the energy of @ xmath72 . using the two - body schrdinger equation it is possible to adjust the wave length for each choice of @ xmath72 . we solve the zero - dimensional two - body schrdinger equation for the two - body wave , @ xmath70 and @ xmath74 where @ xmath75 for @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 for @ xmath78 . the general value of @ xmath70 , @ xmath79 , @ xmath80 is the normalization constant . the study of two - body waves shows that the value of @ xmath1 varies fromnegative to positive passing through an infinite region . in fig . [ 1 . 2 ] , we plot the zero - energy scattering of @ xmath1 as a function of @ xmath72 . at this point , one extra node in the two - body wave function exists which corresponds to an extra three - body bound state . however for our present study we fix @ xmath72 so that this corresponds to zero energy in the two - body wave function . we impose the conditions necessary to prevent the formation of the molecules , otherwise when @ xmath1 sufficiently increases , the energy of three - body scattering will increase which deplete the density by forming molecules . + with the same set of parameters we obtain the solution of coupled differential equations ( cdes ) by hyperspherical adiabatic approximation ( haa ) @ xcite . in haa , we assume the hyperradial motion is slow compared to the hyperangular motion . then the solution of the hyperangular motion is obtained by dividing the potential equation by the corresponding hypercentrifugal equation for a given value of @ xmath30 . the cde is then decoupled back into a fully coupled differential[ @ xmath81 \ zeta _ { 1 } ( x ) = 0 \ hspace * { . 1 \ } , \ left { 1 . eaa } \ ] ] which is known as extreme energy approximation ( eaa ) and the lowest eigenvalue @ xmath82 is the lowest energy in which the hyperradial motion takes place . the above equation is used to obtain the energy and wave function with the boundary conditions on @ xmath83 . + in ref . [ 1 . gndstate ] , we plot the calculated bosonic and ground state energies with the average scattering length near the boundary for large cluster energy with @ xmath0 = 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 as a function of the scattering length @ xmath1 which shows the universal ##ity of the bosonic cluster energy for large @ xmath84 . it has to be noted that the energy interaction of the bosonic cluster is dominated by @ xmath85 . with increases in particle number , the number of particle pair @ xmath86 also increases and the energy becomes more negative than expected . for two particles the negative scattering length corresponds to a bound state at low energy . for three particles theefimov effect : at @ xmath87 or @ xmath88 = 1 , infinitely many many - body bound states with smaller binding energy and larger radii will appear . due to the casimir effect of the attraction , these states tend to be bound one by one . we have studied the structure of bosonic clusters and in general . [ fig . excited ] we show @ xmath89 as a function of the state number @ xmath90 of the binding energy states . the spectrum of efimov effect @ xmath91 as a function of state number @ xmath90 is shown in fig . [ fig . rav ] . [ fig . excited ] , we show that for each of the @ xmath0 - body systems there is a series of bound states with exceedingly strong attraction . it is observed that these series of states have exponential dependence upon the state number as @ xmath89 @ xmath92 @ xmath93 . the result refers to the series as @ xmath94 = 0 . 448 , @ xmath95 = 0 . 278 , @ xmath96 = 0 . 198 , @ x##math97 = 0 . 149 . whereas in fig . [ 2 . rav ] , we found that the spatial range of efimov states is much larger than the normal range and the r . i . d . radii of efimov states are well reproduced with the exponential @ xmath98 @ xmath92 @ xmath99 where the fitted states are @ xmath100 = 0 . 09 , @ xmath101 = 0 . 09 , @ xmath73 = 0 . 09 and @ xmath102 = 0 . 068 . the exponential @ xmath103 = 0 . 41 for @ xmath0 = 4 , 0 . 43 for @ xmath0 = 5 , 0 . 46 for @ xmath0 = 6 and 0 . 49 for @ xmath0 = 7 , is equal to the ratio of 0 . 5 as shown in fig . @ xcite for the bosons . now we determine the statistical properties of the candidate states by calculating the cross - correlation function @ xmath104 which gives the probability of finding the @ xmath26 pair of states in a given state @ xmath10##5 . [ 1 . correlation ] is the full correlation function for @ xmath106 at unitarity . @ xmath104 is considered as a more effective model for the study of molecular properties where the interatomic interaction plays a major role . when atoms try to form bonds , due to the attractive part of van der waals interaction , the short range hard core radius has the effect of splitting , so @ xmath104 is zero for @ xmath105 smaller than the hard core radius @ xmath72 . we calculate @ xmath104 by @ xmath107 where @ xmath108 is the many - body correlation function and the integral over the hypervolume is the integral over @ xmath105 . the position of the peak is reduced to 1 @ xmath105 with increase in @ xmath0 and peak position reduces . however we did not observe any change in the correlation function . it says that the extremely diffuse liquid is just like the liquid , as observed in earlier experiments @ xcite . it is also true that while the universal behaviours of the trimer are quite well understood , much more is known about thelarger systems . in this direction the existence of correlation between energies of three and four - particle systems is indeed required . the theoretical studies in this direction are mainly based on the tjon line which refers to the approximate linear correlation between the energies of three - particle and four - particle systems @ xcite . it is suggested that the bosonic cluster energies according to the unitarity , for different cluster sizes should follow the generalized tjon line . it follows that the energies are linearly related to each other and a two - way relationship is maintained . @ xmath109 in fig . [ table . tjon ] , we consider the energy ratio @ xmath110 as a function of @ xmath111 for different cluster sizes @ xmath0 = 4 , 5 , 6 . these lines show linear correlation of the form @ xmath112 . the fitting parameters are given in fig [ table - tjon ] . we refer the approximate linear ##ity of the energy ratios of clusters to the generalized tjon line . we observe that the value of the fitting parameters , varies with time @ xmath0 and this is consistent with earlier results @ xcite . . values of the values of tjon . . [ col##s = " < , ^ , ^ " , options = " header " , ] [ table - tjon ] this result opens the possibilities of future studies of how the behavior of the table tjon ##s is related in the description of the quantum behavior of diffuse bosonic clusters . cc + ( a ) @ xmath113 & + & + ( b ) @ xmath114 & + + ( c ) @ xmath115 & + the study of weakly bound few - body systems and their quantum behavior in the laboratory is a challenging research area in recent days . the recent experimental observation of efimov scattering in ultracold bose gases has increased the interest in these few - body systems . the theoretical study of two - dimensional bosonic cluster with more than two dimensions is very difficult and the numerical analysis is easier with @ xmath24 . the system is weakly bound and the mass and the energy levels differ . it needs to include interatomic interactions . in the present study we use many - body correlated basis functions for the study of @ xmath0 - boson systems . use of the van der waals potential is the main feature of these cluster systems . we study the energy levels of @ xmath0 - bocluster with @ xmath0 upto 1000 atoms . at large scattering range , which is much larger than the range of atoms , the ground state energy of @ xmath0 - 1 cluster exhibits universal behaviour . therefore , to exhibit the efimov like character of the excited states we present the exponential dependence on the state number . we also calculate the e . m . n values of the spatially separated systems and it shows their exponential dependence on the state number . results of two - body pair cluster exhibit the same properties and does not show different behaviour . it shows that the weakly interacting cluster behaves more like a single quantum dot . we also measure the energy difference between two clusters differing by one atom and show that they maintain a two ##fold correlation coefficient . we consider the tjon line as the characteristic of universal behaviour of bosonic clusters . we would like to thank the university of south africa ( unisa ) for the financial support of research where part of it was done . bc ##s received the support of dst ( india ) under the research grant no / s2 / cmp - 0126 / 2012 .
