it has been known for a long time that due to planar property and gravitational attraction , pure plane waves ( cpw ) result in spacelike singularities [ 1 ] . these results are somewhat weakened when the waves are endowed with a positive cross section prior to the collision . a solution given by chandrasekhar and xanthopoulos ( cx ) [ 2 ] , however constitutes an example of this category , namely , it possesses a cauchy curvature ( ch ) instead of a spacelike curvature . thus , this solution initiated the literature devoted mainly to the quest of stability of waves formed spontaneously . ch waves in spacetimes of cpw were shown by yurtsever to be stable against time - varying fields [ 3 ] . a further perturbation analysis by cx reveals also an analogues result [ 4 ] . any such analysis applied to a cpw spacetime will transform the ch into an electromagnetic field . the second field that proved successful in weakening the strength of the ch in cpw is the electromagnetic ( em ) field itself . in other words , the degree of divergence in the fundamental scalars of the pure gravitational waves turned out to be greater than the case whenthis field is related to gravity . in general , collision of step em waves must have a special case as far as string theory is concerned . such an ordinary solution is given by schwarz and szekeres ( bs ) which describes the collision of two linearly polarized step em waves [ 5 ] . the object ( in fact a ch ) formed in the interaction region of the bs solution is shown to be removed by a coordinate transformation . on the null boundaries , however it possesses esential ##ity singularities which can not be removed by any means . since cross polarization and em fields also play roles in the nature of resulting solutions it is possible to purse these two together . this invokes the cross - metric of the bs ( cpbs ) solution which was found long time ago [ 6 , 7 ] . this solution had the interesting feature that the weyl scalars are not regular in the interaction region . cross polarization , however , does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries . in this case we choose cpbs solution as a test ground , instead of bs , with the step em fields to prove the existence of a ch stability problem posed previously by helliwell and konkowski ( hk ) [ 8 , 9 ] .unlike the classical harmonic analysis of both schmidt and yurtsever the result seems to be very economical in reaching a clear conclusion about the stability of the ch . this is our main reason for considering the problem here , for the sake of the solutions in cpw . in this paper we look at the spacetimes : a ) single plane wave with singular interaction test field and b ) colliding plane waves with non - singular interaction field with test field . , fig . 1 illustrates these cases . the terminology of singularities should be follwed from the classification presented by hk and wang [ 10 ] . singularities in maximal - dimensional spacetimes can be classified into three basic types : quasiregular ( qr ) , scalar curvature ( dt ) and non - uniform curvature ( nsc ) . the ch stability conjecture due to hk is defined as follows . for all maximal flat spacetimes with ch , the backreaction due to a particle ( whose total field - energy density is @ xmath0 ) will affect the ch in one of the following ways . @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 and any finite dust density @ xmath3 are finite , and if thes - tensor @ xmath4 in all freely chosen orthonormal ( ppon ) frames is finite , then the ch remains non - finite . b ) if @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 and any null dust density @ xmath3 are finite , but @ xmath4 diverges in some ppon frames , then an nsc singularity will be formed at the ch . c ) if @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 and any null dust density @ xmath3 diverges , then an sc singularity will be formed at the ch . + otherwise , the paper suggests to put a function field into the ch geometry and study the reaction it will produce . if the scalars converge , in an exact back - reaction solution the field will contribute with an infinite amount to the geometry ( i . e action versus reaction ) . such an exact back - reaction will make the ch unstable and turn it into a sc singularity . + the paper is organized as follows . in section ii , we discuss the cpbs , and the correct description of the sc solution is given in appendix a . section iii , deals with theory and function fields and function field analyses .in section iv , we present an exact back reaction calculation for the collision of a local electric field b with scalar fields . the derivation of weyl and the scalars are discussed in appendix b . the insertion of the null dusts to the background cpbs spacetime and the exact back reaction calculation are presented in section v . appendix a is given for the properties of this solution . the paper is concluded with a discussion in section vi . the metric that describes propagation of electromagnetic waves with the second polarization was found to be [ 7 ] + @ xmath5 for this representation of the metric our coordinates are + @ xmath6 for which @ xmath7 is a function of the first polarization , @ xmath8 for units of energy and @ xmath9 stand for the second polar coordinates . it can be seen easily that for @ xmath10 the metric reduces to bs . unlike the bs solution , however , this is conformally non - trivial for @ xmath11 , where the conformal curvature is generated by the tensor product . as a matter of fact this solution is a partial solution of the bs solution . a slightly different solution of the bs solution with second derivatives was found by cx [1 ] . their solution , however , is an ehlers metric and involves two essential parameters which are quite different from ours . their solutions have ch in the interaction region . our assumptions drown out in this case , namely , that the horizon of invariant against all sources can now be taken to correspond to the cx metric as well . as it was shown before the interaction region @ xmath12 of the new metric is of type - c without scalar curvature singularities . we need to check all the curvature singularities of metric ( 1 ) . the direct application of the weyl scalar suffices to accomplish our purpose . we find that the real part of the weyl metric @ xmath13 is given by @ xmath14 \ { { c } \ ] ] where we have using the abbreviations @ xmath15 and @ xmath16 we find @ xmath17 which corresponds to the normal form of the complex spacetime covered by @ xmath18 . we see that the same result is obtained by the introduction of the inner product . a similar formula for @ xmath19 gives the real complex hypersurface sitting on @ xmath20 . now in order to explore the true nature ofthe next we base our account on the special region ii @ xmath21 . the background in this region is given in the form @ xmath22 \ ] ] where @ xmath23 we find that for @ xmath24 , @ xmath25 is a continuous positive real function which means that no special cases occur except the ones occuring already in the bs case , and at @ xmath26 . to do this we have studied all riemann tensor in local and ppon frames ( see appendix a ) . it is found that all riemann tensor components appear as @ xmath27 . in the ppon case , however , they are all finite and according to the classification scheme of ellis and wilson such a singularity is called a quasiregular ( qr ) one . this is considered to be the simplest one among all types of background . to determine whether the qr is finite or not we consider the test fields added to such a background , and compare the results . this we will do in the follwing sections . we are interested in the stability of qr components that are found at @ xmath28 in region ii and @ xmath29 in region iii . toinvestigate their properties we can determine properties and properties of test materials and em ##s by measuring stress - energy tensor in 2d and ppon frames . + our discussion of these will be restricted to region ii only . we shall consider the waves that originate at the wave front and move toward the quasiregular region . solutions of the equations in region ii can be obtained by using lagrangian mechanics and using @ xmath30 as a basis . the solutions are @ xmath31 } { a } \ sin ( a ) + \ frac { 3p _ { y _ { 0 } } \ left [ 5q ^ { 2 } + 1 -

arrow solution . in the following section we present an explicit example that has cross - polarized vector fields coupled with electromagnetic field . in the former section , we use hk stability conjecture to determine the stability of qr curvature in the local ##ization of cpbs spacetime . according to the conjecture these two singularities are unstable . in order to test the validity of the conjecture we introduce this new solution . + let the metric be ; @ xmath70 \ ] ] the ems solution is obtained from the electrovacuum equation . the ems solution is obtained in the following manner . the lagrangian curvature of the metric is .by @ xmath71 \ end { aligned } \ ] ] which also yields the ems field equations from a variational perspective . where @ xmath72 is the ems field and we get the em ##f 2 -

scs . this result is in perfect agreement with the original conjecture . * ( ) * let us consider first null - particles found in the cpbs solution . for simplicity we consider in different cases the @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 projections of the spacetime . we have for the first case @ xmath100 where we have used the notation @ xmath101 corresponding to @ xmath102 the energy - momentum relation for two oppositely charged null dusts can be written as @ xmath103 where @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 are the relative energy levels of the particles . the null - operators @ xmath106 and @ xmath107 are @ xmath108 with @ xmath109 @xmath110 we get from ( 1 ) that @ xmath111 which is true for @ xmath112 . the components of energy - momentum tensor in ppon frame are equivalent to the expression ( 1 ) . this expression makes all the components of energy - momentum tensor equal . in the case of @ xmath113 which maps our tensor element to the horizon this tensor depends on the horizon @ xmath114 . that of the energy - momentum is obviously zero therefore we must extract it from the scalar @ xmath115 . one has , @ xmath116 the projection of @ xmath99 , however is not very useful in the @ xmath98 case . using the reduced metric @ xmath117 and similar analysis with the reduced metric @ xmath118 with @ xmath119 @ xmath120 and the scalar @ xmath121 from the metric ( 1 ) we find that @ xmath122 which diverges from the horizon @ xmath123 . the metric @ xmath124 extracted from the reference frame therefore is . the ppon frame of thethe momentum tensors are also calculated and it is found that all of the components are proportional to the constant ( 1 ) . this indicates that the components of energy - momentum tensor diverges as the equilibrium is reached . when we consider the hk stability , an exact back reaction solution would be a singular solution . we have now an exact back reaction solution of two colliding null shells in the interaction region of the cpbs spacetime . + * b ) * the metric given by @ xmath125 where @ xmath126 with @ xmath127 positive constants was considered by wang [ 12 ] to represent collision of two null shells ( or impulsive dusts ) . the interaction region is transformable to the de novo cosmological spacetime . in other words the space of two interacting null shells is also equivalent to the # ##hn space . it can be shown also that the choice of the conformal metric @ xmath128 , with @ xmath129 positive constant becomes isomorphic to the anti - de sitter space . + the combined space of cpbs and null shells can be represented by @ xmath130 this leads to the metric @ xmath131where @ xmath132 correspond to the correlation coefficient of the cpbs solution . under this assumption the remaining invariant weyl numbers remain invariant ( or at least multiplied by a conformal factor ) because @ xmath133 is the curvature that arise in those scalars . the remaining curvature , however , which was neglected in the case of cpbs , arises as nonzero and becomes divergent as we approach the horizon . appendix 2 describes the metric ##s @ xmath134 and @ xmath135 . thus the resulting back reaction , is a singular ##ity as predicted by the theory . it is easily seen that s @ xmath136 , which chooses one of the shells leaves us with a null shell propagating in the @ xmath37 - direction . from the diagram we see that choosing the null shell gives rise to a spontaneous back reaction by the spacetime . the horizon , in particular , is closed and transforms into a singularity in the case of two colliding , or even a single , null shell . let us note as an alternative interpretation that the equation ( 43 ) can be considered as two separate plane waves in a de ##ductive background . instead of emwaves have an interaction region in the de sitter space which is not regular for @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 . in this way we have analysed the stability of qr waves in the cpbs spacetime . two types of em field are used to measure the stability . first we have applied test em field to the background cpbs spacetime . from the results we see that the qr wave in the interaction region is unstable according to the conjecture , and it is transformed into an instability . this is the prediction of the conjecture . however , the correct chain - rule solution is that beside the true solution are the phase boundaries @ xmath139 and @ xmath140 . there are quasiregular waves in the interaction region . the boundary of interaction region is singularity free and the hypersurface @ xmath141 is a quasi - cauchy space . as it was pointed out by hk in the case of colliding em step waves , conjecture fails to predict the stable behaviour of the waves in the interaction region . we have also solved the stability problem for the cross - version of colliding em step waves . the behaviour of cross polarization .to prove the same property . + next we have introduced test scalar field to the incoming cpbs spacetime . the effect of scalar field on the qr singularity is stronger than the effect of the test null case . we have observed that the qr field is unstable and transformes into a ch . to prove the validity of the conjecture , we have constructed a new solution constituting an exact back reaction solution to the test em field in the cpbs spacetime . the solution represents the collision of cross polarized em field case to test scalar field . the combination of weyl and maxwell scalars means that @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 . then the collision is observed and unlike the test em field , the conjecture of the nature of gravity formed again . + finally , we have introduced test null dusts into the incoming region of cpbs spacetime . the solution predicts that the ch are unstable and transform into scs . this solution is compared with the exact back - reaction solution and observed that the conjecture holds . to determine the nature of singularity in the incoming region of cpbs spacetime , the metric tensor in local and global ppon frame must be known . non -
