a two - dimensional bulk gas ( 2deg ) reacts sensitively to perpendicular magnetic fields . making the magnetic field homogeneous opens the door to a wide range of magnetic materials and applications , ranging from magnetic superlattices @ xcite and magnetic waveguides @ xcite to magnetic materials for magnetic nanostructures . @ xcite a very simple magnetic field structure is the _ magnetic barrier _ , namely a perpendicular magnetic field , strongly localized along one in - between direction and homogeneous in the second one . @ xcite in a classical picture , magnetic barriers can be considered as selective transmitters that select the electrons according to their angle of incidence . @ xcite in a ballistic picture without this , one would reasonably expect that at a critical barrier , the barrier _ closes _ , all electrons are free and the field approaches zero . recently , magnetic barriers have received considerable interest due to their potential applications as tunable spin filters and detectors , both of which are highly sensitive spintronics devices . @ xcite these theoretical works suggest that a high degree of spin filtering may be achieved with magnetic barriers under certain conditions . considering the elementary nature and the simplicity of a magnetic barrier , it is surprising that only a few experimental results with such barriers have been reported .in @ xcite , a magnetic barrier with a square profile has been experimentally realized in a highly homogeneous sample , namely the 2deg in a graded state . it is known that even for large magnetic fields , the barrier resistance is finite . the results of these experiments have been successfully incorporated within the classical model @ xcite , which assumes that @ xmath0 - scattering at the edge of the 2deg , as well as edge scattering , limit the resistance to finite values . in all other experiments reported so far : 1 . @ xcite , the magnetic barrier has been generated using two metals [ al ] as heterostructures , surrounding a single platelet , placed on top of the sample , in an in - plane magnetic field . @ xcite in such a case , the magnetic barrier originates from the z - axis of the stray field of the ferromagnet , see figure . this experimental implementation is also the basis for a significant fraction of the theoretical model . @ xcite + for an accurate implementation of the theoretical model , a detailed and quantitative understanding of the edge transmission properties of tunable magnetic barriers is needed . previous experiments have already shown that both edge transmission and scattering in the same region are possible . @ xcite here ,we build on these results and discuss in detail how the resistance of tunable magnetic materials depends upon the @ xmath1 type at the edges , on the elastic scattering and on thermal smearing . in order to magnify these results , we have made our thin films from material which has a very large internal saturation magnetization of @ xmath2 . @ xcite this allows us to extend the barriers well into the closed state , where the current through the structure is completely controlled by the field of force here . in addition , a top gate is used to tune the electron density . these results are shown in a 2d - 3d picture based on the periodic table for these conductors . @ xcite we note that ( i ) the combination of the @ xmath1 type edge drift and elastic scattering in the boundary determines the barrier thickness , ( ii ) the assumptions about the distribution of the angles for the measured electron density lead to excellent correlation of the experimental data with the model , and ( iii ) thermal smearing has a significant influence at high helium temperatures . the rest of the discussion is as follows : in section 2 , we describe the sample preparation , the experimental setup and the measurement results . the measurement results .discussed in section iii , but the non - classical approach and its relevance to our application is the topic of section iv . the paper concludes with a summary and a discussion ( section v ) . a commercially available @ xmath3 - heterostructure @ xcite with a 2deg @ xmath4 below the surface was first patterned by using optical microscopy and subsequent processing steps . the first patterned surface ( fig . [ mb1 ] ) was obtained by using chemical methods . au / ge bond distances were defined at source and drain , and at the surface probes up to 8 . a dysprosium ( iii ) layer with a thickness of @ xmath5 was defined on the heterostructure surface by dy - evaporation at the gate layer of @ xmath6 . a fe / fe gate layer of @ xmath7 metal was deposited on top to prevent the metal from oxidizing under certain conditions and to allow the carrier density to be tuned . six samples were analyzed , and all showed qualitatively different properties . here , we discuss data taken from a single sample . the samples were inserted into a liquid helium cryostat with a specific temperature regime that permits theof the temperature between @ xmath8 and room temperature . the sample chamber was equipped with a rotating sample chamber , so that the magnetic field could be oriented within the x - z plane with an angle better than @ xmath9 degrees . [ highly symmetric in the x - plane . also shown is the x - axis of the magnetic field . ] the electron densities and the electron mobility were determined from the electron - probe measurements of the components of the metric tensor , @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 in parallel magnetic fields . the ungated electron mobility is @ xmath12 , and the charge at a distance of @ xmath8 is @ xmath13 , corresponding to a drude scattering time of @ xmath14 and an effective mean free path of @ xmath15 . the quantum scattering time was determined from the envelope of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations @ xcite ##s @ xmath16 . the effect of the hall effect was also used to determine the maximum magnetic field configuration . from the maximum magnetic field @ xmath17 of @ xmath18 , in our experiment , we know that the maximum external - magnetic field configuration is @ @ xmath##19 . strong parallel magnetic fields are also known to affect the magnetic properties of 2degs by modifying the density of electrons and the interactions . @ xcite in addition , the electron capture mass becomes much smaller . @ xcite these effects show up in a weak and almost uniform magnetoresistivity . increasing b ##z moves the dy film along the z - axis . the z - component of the fringe field of the 2deg is strongly localized on the surface of the dy in the z - direction and forms the first barrier . @ xcite the y - and z - components of the fringe field are shown in fig . [ mb1 ] ( c ) for the absolute value of the first component of x . assuming that the fringe field follows the corresponding analytic direction @ xcite , @ xmath20 is given by @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 is the distance of the 2deg from the surface and @ xmath23 is the distance of the x ##cite , in fig . [ mb1 ] ( c ) . this expression neglects the second magnetic barrier residing at contacts 4 and 8 , which is important since it is very far away from the one probed at contacts 2 and 3 .the roughness of the magnetic film can also lead to deviations from eq . . we measured the edge ##f by using force field measurements and found an edge deviation ( or standard deviation ) of @ xmath24 , which is smeared out to a large extent at the 2deg . we then described the edge roughness in the following . the magnetization in the x - direction as a function of @ xmath17 is denoted by @ xmath25 , which can be estimated from hall measurements of the fringe field @ xcite ##s described below . the b - component of the fringe field has a much smaller effect on the 2deg and is very small compared with the magnetic field used to establish saturation ( i . e . @ xmath26 , see the figure in fig . [ mb2 ] ) . it is therefore neglected in the equation . a pulse of @ xmath27 at a frequency of @ xmath28 is passed from source to drain . the barrier voltage is obtained from the voltage measured between contacts 2 and 3 ( fig . 2 ) with the lock - in amplifier . the hall voltage measured between contacts 4 and 8 is used to measure @ xmath25 . we assume from the figure below that the qbarriers at the edges of the magnetic film differ only in their sign . figure 1 shows a typical magnetoresistance at @ xmath29 of our barrier , based on sample size . the boundaries are hysteretic , reflecting the magnetization characteristics of the magnetic film ( inset ) . around the coercive magnetic fields at @ xmath30 , @ xmath29 has minima which equal to the accuracy the magnetoresistance outside the magnetic film , at an identical scale . this shows that the micromagnetic effect of the dy film which is most effective around the coercive magnetic field @ xcitehas no noticeable effect in our barrier . @ xmath29 increases as it goes away from the coercive field , but neither reaches nor approaches it , even just at the minimum magnetic field . the decrease @ xmath31 to @ xmath32 is not possible due to the magnetic field . as discussed in more detail below , if our barrier were fully ballistic and without edges , it would be at @ xmath33 away from the minimum of @ xmath10 . however , at 100 % of the magnetic field being scanned , the boundary is governed by the gand scattering is of interest . note that the @ xmath29 traces are slightly asymmetric around their edges . we attribute this effect to the proximity of the voltage probe ( @ xmath34 ) to the magnetic barrier , in which the electrons ejected from the probe do not yet form a fermi sphere , even though the electrons have only 1 % mean free paths away from the barrier . these effects have been observed by leadbeater et al . @ xcite and were further studied in detail by ibrahim et al . @ xcite . the magnetic resistance of the magnetic barrier ( shown in fig . [ mb1 ] ) measures @ xmath20 , measured by the field extension @ xmath35 in the z - direction of the voltage probe ##s ##4 and 5 , i . e . , @ xmath36 , according to @ xmath37 here , @ xmath38 represents a scale factor which may deviate from 1 , depending on the magnetic field and the mean free paths . @ xcite for our purposes , @ xmath39 is valid @ xcite , and we have no reason to assume otherwise , in contrast to the explanation given in fig . @ xcite . here , we have assumed that the currentbarrier on top of our voltage cross is also described by the ballistic equation , even though the mean free path is smaller that the height of the voltage cross . since , however , the fwhm of our system in the open regime is much smaller than @ xmath40 and therefore much smaller than the mean free path , and the induced magnetic moment multiplied by the electron density @ xmath41 for our system in the closed regime , the diffusive model described in ref . @ xcite does not always apply as well , @ xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the model for the open regime is not available . for @ xmath42 , we obtain from the measured @ xmath43 the saturation value of @ xmath44 for our dy film . this is significantly below the theoretical average for bulk dysprosium . we attribute this phenomenon to the diffusion of electrons into the thin films during metallization , as well as to the structure of the material . @ xcite this model is supported by our observation of @ xmath45 growth over time in samples where the dy film is not covered by a cr / cr layer . the [ mb3 ] reproduces the behaviorof the barrier magnetoresistance as the temperature is increased . as the temperature is increased , the magnetic barrier resistance is reduced . at the same time , the shape of the barrier becomes more roughly circular and the resistance decreases . thus , the resistance ##s increase and are equal to the absolute values of @ xmath17 . as will be explained in more detail below , this phenomenon can be understood in terms of a combination of increased resistance and a decreased coercivity of the barrier surface as the temperature is increased , and the surface tension of the barrier surface plays a marginal role . a strong hysteresis is observed even at the absolute value for the absolute value of bulk dy , @ xmath46 . @ xcite the measurement of the barrier temperature is a good indication of crystal imperfections in our dy films . our numerical approximation of the magnetic barrier resistance is provided by the example of electrons . the analysis is based upon the billiard model for quasi - ballistic conductors @ xcite and the landauer - bttiker formalism @ xcite . electrons are injected into the barrier region starting from a random x - direction @ xmath47 to the left of the barrier and random again in the y - directionacross the hall bar of width @ xmath48 . they start out with the fermi velocity , and their directions are equally distributed over the regions with positive x - component . we use the differential equations of the classical motion of the electrons to determine their trajectories until either it is absorbed by the barrier and passes the starting line in the opposite direction , or until it travels through the barrier and passes the starting line @ xmath47 to the right . at this distance , @ xmath49 is negligible . scattering the electrons at these distances does not modify the results . the edges of the hall bar have been covered by strong , homogeneous electric fields in the regions @ xmath50 . these electric field forces generate magnetic scattering . the magnetic barrier is homogeneous as given by eq . in the x - direction and also in the y - direction . we have introduced scattering in the 2deg , assuming scattering after pairs of flights which have a poisson distribution with a time constant of @ xmath51 . the electrons in a 2deg with the non - doped ga [ al ] ₂ heterostructure are then excited by the electron carriers in the doping layer , and the corresponding _ _ __ _ is chosen to form an inverse gaussian distribution of scattering angles . @ xcite we can assume a normal distribution of scattering angles @ xmath52 with a standard deviation of @ xmath53 , centered at @ xmath54 and parallel to @ xmath55 . within our simulation , the time of flight and the subsequent scattering events follow a poisson distribution with an expectation value of @ xmath56 . at a scattering event , the angles between the initial and the final scattering angle and direction are changed according to the distribution function given above . these two distributions are the previously determined values for @ xmath51 and @ xmath57 . + we remark that our simulation parameters are rather insensitive to the normal distribution function of scattering angles . we have therefore assumed a normal distribution , with a high probability for scattering angles @ xmath58 and a probability of lower for larger angles . even though we find much higher values for the resistance ( about 2 . 5 % ) for small fields , , the expectation values are obtained in the normal form . for a magnetic field , 40000 electrons of fermi energy @ xmath59 are injected . the transmission is determined by @ xmath60 here , @ x##math38 is the angle between the z - direction and the direction in which the electron is moving and @ xmath61 is either @ xmath62 or @ xmath63 depending on whether the electron with the corresponding initial charge is present or not . we note that the electron density underneath the y film may differ from that underneath the cr / au film , as a result of the schottky barriers . the measurements at the probes 1 and 4 , as well as probe 6 and 7 , respectively , indicate that the electron density under the film is about 5 % larger as compared with the density of outside , but this value is irrelevant since the z - component of the homogeneous fringe field superimposes on the homogeneous fringe field in the y - direction and we were unable to separate these two components to the total contact resistance . @ xcite we have used this density step in our calculation . the conductance is given by @ xmath64 where @ xmath65 is the number of electrons in our hall bar and @ xmath66 is the optical constant . we note that according to fig . [ eq4 ] , the contact resistance ( @ xmath67 ) between an electronextended 2deg and the full bar do not converge to @ xmath10 . @ xcite from fig . , the total flux @ xmath10 across the barrier for a given carrier density is also calculated from @ xmath68 . in a special case , we have cut off all edges and set the electric field at the boundary to zero , thereby simulating a normal magnetic barrier which goes to infinity in the z - direction . in this case , the experimental results exactly follow the above experimental results @ xcite and reproduce the critical angle of curvature for which the magnetic barrier closes to an angle of zero degree . + with the zero trace of 0 . 2 ( full circle ) , accounts for the magnetoresistivity of the 2deg which is set to its maximum value at @ xmath69 . full circles : @ xmath10 for a structure with edges ( edge electric field @ xmath70 ) and no scattering ; edges : @ xmath10 for the structure with no edges and scattering according to the above determined scattering time ; full circles : the resistance with no edges and edge electric field ; open squares : @ xmath10 for the structure with edges and the mean quantum scattering time of @ xmath7##1 . examples : typical calculated resistance in the closed regime : scattering inside the magnetic barrier ( trace 2 ) as well as @ xmath0 - drifts by edge electric fields ( trace 3 ) are responsible for the high resistance . ( 2 ) behavior of the magnetic barrier as a function of electron energy for several values of @ xmath72 on edges and surfaces . large values in the table correspond to the electron energy for which the infinitely large components of a ballistic system will behave ( the electron energy dependent symbol for @ xmath73 is shown on the right ) . ] for a comparison of the simulations with the experiments , the magnetization of @ xmath25 shown in the middle of fig . [ mb2 ] is used to map the height of the magnetic barrier onto the experimental value of @ xmath17 . results of the simulations are shown in fig . [ mb4 ] ( 2 ) . more precisely , the addition of the edge electric field to the ballistic system limits the resistance in the closed regime to small values . some electrons that would be trapped at the barrier away from the edge are pulled into the barrier by the edges due to the @ xmath1 effect , leaving the inset .fig . [ mb4 ] ( a ) . this property is the sole explanation for the barrier resistance in the classical case , as long as scattering is excluded . the barrier resistance decreases as the edge electric field is increased . in our simulations , we have simulated an electric field of @ xmath70 . this value can be considered an upper limit , based upon measurements of the resistance of the confining walls @ xcite and in accordance with the fact that a resistance change of the magnitude of @ xmath74 will only occur at a distance greater than the screening distance . @ xcite we note that the total barrier resistance is only partially dependent on the strength of the edge electric field . + for an infinitely extended closed magnetic barrier in a closed domain , the resistance is only held constant by scattering events in the boundary region , see fig . [ mb4 ] ( a ) . this is best illustrated by the characteristic trajectories , see the inset of fig . [ mb4 ] ( a ) : a scattering event may produce an effect which in the absence of scattering would be rejected by the barrier . for the only free paths comparable to and below the spatial extension of the barrier , the barrier is closed ( least squaresin fig . [ mb4 ] ( a ) , where the measured background mean free path ( @ xmath75 ) . + in comparison with the experimental model in fig . [ mb2 ] ( a ) , we observe that the numerical model for @ xmath29 that takes only the scattering into account but disregards the scattering disagrees completely with the experiment . here , the measured background magnetoresistance ( fig . [ mb2 ] ) has been replaced by its value for @ xmath69 . the shape of the measured trace remains constant , but its absolute value varies by up to 50 % . we point out that in this case , the only independent variable is the number of scattering times within the constraints set by the measured trace for @ xmath57 and @ xmath51 , which is determined by the shape of the scattering potential ##s . from this separate study of the two models , it emerges that a combination of both elastic transmission and scattering - induced scattering produces @ xmath29 . in addition , inclusion of the elastic scattering in combination with the measured scattering times , as well as an associated edge effect of @ xmath76 , gives a very good approximation of the measured trace , see fig . [ mb4 ]( a ) . we refrain from fitting the experimental data since further measurements may have an influence on this level of accuracy . first , there is a slight distortion of the electron traces , which we attribute to asymmetries in the magnetic probe geometry . @ xcite ##s , the shape of the magnetic barrier may differ from eq . , and it may be tilted in the z - direction . second , the electron density above the dy deviates from that below the y . this problem could in principle be solved by using a thin , elastic boundary layer between the magnetic barrier and the ferromagnet . + in order to minimize the effect of thermal expansion , we have obtained the definition of the @ xmath77 by varying the expression in eq . , from which the solution at non - equilibrium temperatures is obtained via @ xmath78 where @ xmath79 denotes the fermi - ##onic transfer function . [ mb4 ] ( b ) means that the simulated @ xmath77 is a purely linear function of the thermal energy . according to eq . , @ xmath80 is independent of temperature for @ xmath81 . a similar problem is alsoapproximately , in the transition region of the highly confined , open magnetic field in a . 2deg @ xcite , see the inset in fig . [ mb4 ] ( b ) . however , the combination of both edge scattering and scattering does not change this property of the effective barrier resistance to thermal smearing . we conclude , therefore , that the changes of @ xmath29 with temperature are , unlike the temperature changes of @ xmath82 , not due to the temperature dependence of the scattering times . in our experiments , we find that the scattering times are constant compared to @ xmath83 , and in addition , we do not find significant changes of @ xmath29 , see fig . [ mb3 ] , while for higher temperatures , the observed shubnikov - de haas measurements no longer allow a meaningful interpretation of @ xmath51 . hence , a meaningful interpretation of the phenomenon at higher temperatures requires more detailed information regarding the scattering times and the distribution of scattering angles than obtained from our experiments . we have also studied numerically the phenomenon of spin splitting in @ xmath29 ( using an approximate g - factor of - 0 . 5 ) due to which the two spin states have different spin##rmi , and therefore the partial energy , results in a spin splitting of the current . our simulations show that the effect of the spin splitting at @ xmath29 is marginal . however , it is found , that the spin splitting of the current increases with the barrier height in the closed regime , and is below @ xmath84 for parallel magnetic fields . however , this value is only a factor of 5 larger than the simulated value for magnetic fields without edges , and we conclude that spin splitting tends to increase the spin polarization . even allowing for this factor , the effect for a 2deg in ga [ al ] still remains very small . however , we have also incorporated the mass losses induced by the strong parallel magnetic field @ xcite and conclude that they are negligible in our reference range . we have modeled the behavior of the barriers defined in ga [ al ] as heterostructures in the quasi - ballistic domain as a function of in - plane magnetic field . we have also modeled the resistance numerically within the semiclassical domain , and we conclude that the magnetic resistance observed in the closed regime arises from both elastic scattering in the barrier region and from scattering via @ xmath0 drifts at the edges of the hall region .by averaging the scattering spectrum as obtained from the data , a very good agreement between measurement and experiment was obtained , especially given the uncertainty involved regarding the exact shape and size of the magnetic barrier . furthermore , the resulting magnetoresistance is subject to light smearing , spin scattering and magnetic drift effects . the simulations also show how the phase change induced by the magnetic barrier can be increased , which may be of interest if one wishes to observe other effects such as quantum tunneling @ xcite or spin polarization . first of all , using larger hall and hall waves of equal width will reduce the density in the transition region and therefore increase the barrier resistance . also , defining soft edges reduces in principle the transmission via @ xmath0 ##2 effects ; our simulations also show that defining hard edges with magnetic fields in the direction of @ xmath85 are sufficient to obtain a noticeable effect . finally , the deposition of thin - films under ultra - vacuum conditions should reduce the saturation magnetization by up to a factor of 10 in our samples . our model can easily be used to model more complicated magnetic barrier structures , for example those suggested recently for use as tunable optical filters . @ xcite + the .for the critical editing of the manuscript by david jenkins , in collaboration with hengyi xu as well as financial support by the _ heinrich - heine - universitt dsseldorf _ .
