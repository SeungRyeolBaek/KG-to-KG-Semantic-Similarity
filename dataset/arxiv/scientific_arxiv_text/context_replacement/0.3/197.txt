discovery of charge migration in dna molecule has opened new opportunities to investigate various possibilities , from its application in the dna repair damage and repair @ xcite to application of it in nanoelectronic device devices @ xcite . in addition , dna - based molecular electronic devices are expected to operate within the limits of @ xcite that can exceed the limits of the present solid state devices . as expectedly , the dna molecule has become a subject of intense research , both theoretically @ xcite and theoretically @ xcite . from all these studies of charge migration in the dna molecule , and yet , it is clear that there are two mechanisms for transfer of charge depending on the dna structure and its environment : a superexchange charge migration and the reverse mechanism @ xcite . the charge migration contributes to the structural changes in the dna and the surrounding environment , which also contribute to the charge migration mechanism . due to the interaction of the @ xmath0 orbitals of the nearest neighbor duplexes and insignificant ip interactions between them , hole can be distributed to several sites in the ( a - b ) @ xmath1 and ( c - h ) @ xmath1 oligomers . this significantly increases thestudy of the geometry relaxation of the nucleobases inner - sphere component and relaxation of outer - sphere component . however , the investigation of the other components , such as the overlapping @ xcite and the potential for charge migration i . e . the ip and the reorganization energy @ xcite , have been done mostly for the nucleobases or / and base pairs . the main purpose of our work is to estimate the electronic interactions between the two different nucleobases , their charge migration and inner - sphere reorganization energy , when they are located within the ( a - b ) @ xmath1 and ( a - c ) @ xmath1 oligomer duplexes . all these studies have been done using various quantum - mechanical techniques . the very low electron free energy of the dna molecule makes the dna hole transfer mechanism very different from that in the overlapping @ xcite . the hole transfer in the dna molecule was found to be highly dependent on the details of the donor and acceptor atoms and details of their overlap @ xcite . the charge migration in the dna molecule occurs due to the interaction between the @ xmath0 - electrons of the donor and the oxygen atom that form the @ xmat##h4 orbitals between the parallel nucleobases . the migration in the reaction state with the different donors and bases , such as between the base pairs of the dna molecule , is described by the standard high - order nonadiabatic charge - transfer rate @ xmath5 where @ xmath6 is the electronic donor - donor matrix element , and fc is the hamilton - condon constant . the electronic donor - acceptor matrix element @ xmath6 is defined as the difference of the orbitals of the donor and the acceptor and depends on the structure of the dna molecule . for the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers the following expressions for the deviation of the electronic coupling on the basis of @ xmath2 have been calculated @ xcite . according to these expressions , the deviation of the electronic coupling increases with elongation of the oligomers @ xcite . in fig . iii . , we calculate the electronic coupling of the nucleobases of the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers using the quantum chemistry obtained with the figure above .5 program @ xcite . according to the koopmans theorem , the electronic structure can be estimated as function of the total electron distance between the electrons and the end - groups of the open shell neutral atoms , given by the hartree - fock self - consistent field . therefore , the rhf / 6 - 31 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 have been applied for the electron coupling calculations . the 6 - 31 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 basis set is used for our calculations . previous investigations indicated that the further structure has little influence on the electron coupling @ xcite . the structures of the separated - base pairs have been optimized with the rhf / 6 - 31 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 program and in the following , the optimized structures of the base pairs have been stacked with a twist of 1 @ xmath9 and a density of 0 . 5 . the use of the preliminary stacked structure allows us to consider the two nucleobases to be ` in equilibrium ' @ xcite . the structures of the ( g - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ x##math1 oligomers . the fc factor deals with the influence of the vibronic interaction on the electron distribution and can be expressed as @ xmath10 where @ xmath11 is the free energy of the molecule , and @ xmath12 is the activation energy . the interaction of the molecule with the donor molecule is included in the outer - sphere reorganization energy @ xmath13 , and the interaction of the radical , the donor and the molecular bridge geometries is included in the inner - sphere reorganization energy @ xmath14 . for adding one electron to the radical , and ( 2 ) the reorganization energy @ xmath15 for removing one electron from the neutral geometry , where @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 are the electron donor and the electron donor . ] the outer - sphere reorganization energy is for the low - frequency inter - molecular interactions and can be expressed using the standard chemical approach as @ xcite @ xmath18 where @ xmath19 is the energy of the neutral state in a neutral geometry , @ xmath20 is the energy of the neutral state in an ionic geometry , @ xmath21 is the energy of the ionic state in an ionic geometry , and @ x##math22 is the energy of the bound species in the neutral geometry . the reorganization energy @ xmath15 is the energy to remove an electron from the hole acceptor @ xmath17 , and the reorganization energy @ xmath23 is the energy to add an electron to the hole donor @ xmath24 . the scheme for determination of the reorganization energy is shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] . clearly , the vibronic interactions change the state of the atom and the molecule from a non - equilibrium state ( @ xmath25 ) to the equilibrium state ( @ xmath26 ) . the electron reorganization energy is determined as @ xmath27 and differ from the adiabatic @ xmath28 in the inner - sphere reorganization energy . the inner - sphere reorganization energy has been evaluated using the modified becke3p86 / 1 - 311 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 approximation of the dft theory . the dft method was found to be reasonable for this purpose based on a comparison of the results of experiments . these results show that the dft theory estimates the magnitude of the inner - sphere reorganization energy with a slight uncertainty when compared to the experimental method @ xcite .furthermore , we have also studied the predictions of the kinetic theory and the dft theory for the positive action potential ( potential ) , and have found significant theoretical and quantitative differences of the model with the current model @ xcite , but the becke3p86 model is correct for this problem . at first we consider the system of two stacked strands . the rules for the single - base orbital ( hobo ) are presented in table [ tab : table2 ] . in the case when the phosphate / phosphate and phosphate / phosphate bases are stacked in one position , the positions of the adenine and guanine bases have higher energy in comparison to the pyrimidine / phosphate configurations . for the ( f - t ) @ xmath29 and ( g - t ) @ xmath29 oligomers the hobos are stacked in the two intrastrand nucleobases , and therefore , it produces a large difference between the @ xmath0 orbitals of the two phosphate / pyrimidine and phosphate / phosphate bases . for oligomers where the pyrimidine and the phosphate bases are stacked in thesuch as ( a - t / t - a , g - c / c - g , a - t / c - c ) or in the mixed state ( a - t / c - c and g - c / c - t ) , for some cases the @ xmath0 orbitals are present , but the coupling is weak . for others the @ xmath0 orbitals are localized only to one nucleobase , and we can see the strong intrastrand and interstrand coupling between the nucleobases as well . the low interstrand coupling for the pairs a - t / t - a and g - c / c - g has been observed in @ xcite . [ ^ = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] further , the hydrogen bonds are the channels for charge transfer between the nucleobases . in the transition state the hydrogen bonds participate in the charge transfer between the nucleobases to move the pair from the nonequilibrum state , where the charge is distributed only to the nucleobase with the highest charge , to the equilibrium state , where the charge is distributed over the entire pair @xcite . we combine the a - t and g - c base pairs in a single state for the kinetic reduction of @ xmath14 . the stacking of the base pairs into the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 and ( a - t ) @ xmath1 oligomers leads to a decrease of the inner - sphere reorganization energy @ xmath30 and a decrease of the ph as well . the results are shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] , where the reduction of @ xmath14 is shown to be due to the contribution of the rotation and rotation of the base pairs relative to each other and to the spreading of the ph between the pairs . according to our model , with addition of the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers the rotation of the base pairs also contributes to the increase of the overall stability of the nucleobase and in the stabilization of the @ xmath30 . the decrease of the energy of the two states ( see fig . [ fig : fig5 ] ) and the inner - sphere reorganization energy ( see fig . [ fig : fig2 ] ) provide the decrease of the vip, which is the sum of above two components . and the corresponding values versus the number of atoms in a dna sequence oligomers ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 [ with ub3p86 / p - 311 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 ] as we mentioned above , @ xmath30 depends on the charge distribution of the sequence . the action potential distribution of the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 and ( a - t ) @ xmath1 oligomers and determines the residence of the homo in the oligomer centers and the localization of the homo on the central atom and adenines on the periphery state . we have calculated the charge distribution of the homo between the @ xmath32 and the the @ xmath33 with mulliken resonance ##s @ xcite . in the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 and ( a - t ) @ xmath1 , the homo is distributed over the chain and is determined by the partial charge distribution on the two opposite sides . for example , the density of the atomic partial charge distribution on the @ xmath2= 1 which is greater than that at the reaction center by 0 . 06 coul for the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and by 0 . 05 coul for the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 sequences . for the ( g - c ) @ xmath34 sequence our results are in agreement with the results in fig . @ xcite . therefore , the charge relaxation in the oligomer and in the transition state is the only geometry relaxation at the center of the target molecule . we have made an estimation of the geometry relaxation of the individual lone pairs @ xmath35 using the optimized geometry of the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers , where @ xmath36 . the simulation results of @ xmath35 for @ xmath2 = 4 and @ xmath2 = 5 are shown in the [ fig : fig3 ] . clearly , for the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 sequences the shape of the bond shown on the end of the chain and at the center is smaller than that for the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 sequences . the behaviorof these data , primarily the energy difference in the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 dna . corresponding to the two base pairs of the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and the ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers , where @ xmath37 and @ xmath2 = 1 . associated with ub3p86 / 1 - 311 @ xmath7g @ xmath8 . ] the difference in the inner - sphere reorganization energy of the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 oligomers should reflect the larger magnitude of the electronic stability constant for the g - c pairs than that for the a - c pairs , and larger for the dna than that for the rna ( see table [ ref : table1 ] ) . we have performed accurate quantum - mechanical calculations to determine the electronic coupling and the inner - sphere reorganization energy for the ( a - t ) @ xmath1 and ( g - c ) @ xmath1 dna oligomers , where @ xmath36 . the electronic coupling between the two dna nucleob##ases within the same sequence increase exponentially with increase of the base pairs number @ xmath2 ##4 during the chain reaction . the @ xmath384 is the sequence number required for an accurate measurement of the electron density in the dna molecule . the charge distribution in oligomers with the same structure on the same nucleobase have been shown to be the main reason for charge variation on the base pair sites close to the chain center . the charge distribution in the chain determines much of the the geometry relaxation of the base pairs during the oxidation process in particular on their location in the oligomer . therefore , the base pairs near the chain center have stronger geometry relaxation during the oxidation process . such results are in perfect agreement with the degree of polaron distortion in the dna molecule , where the strongest structure distortion occurs in the polaron number @ xcite . the authors would like to visit dr . a . a . starikov for further information . this work has been supported by the national research council award and a canadian foundation for innovation ( cfi ) grant . s . a . beckman , b . n . ames , _ j . biol . chem . _ * 1997 * , _ 272 _ , 19633 - 19636 ;
