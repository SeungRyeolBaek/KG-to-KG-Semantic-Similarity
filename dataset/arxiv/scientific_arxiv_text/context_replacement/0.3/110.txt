processes of quantum electroproduction have played an important role in understanding the structure and properties of matter ( see , _ e . g . _ , @ xcite ) . in the last few years , however , reactions with pairs of dileptons in hadron - hadron and nucleus - nucleus reactions have drawn much attention @ xcite . in these reactions , photons , which materialize as dileptons ( _ e . g . _ , the @ xmath2 reaction ) , provide unique information on properties of matter because the processes by which the atomic structure is formed occur in the timelike region of the ` ` lifetime ' ' ( @ xmath3 ) of the virtual photon . therefore , the study of these reactions is ongoing and results in acquisition of new and perhaps unexpected information about the structure properties of atoms and nuclei . the interactive pion electroproduction ( ipe ) , @ xmath1 , ( or dileptonproduction ) , was for a long time the main source of information about the virtual particle structure in the timelike region , has been investigated both theoretically @ xcite and physically @ xcite since the beginning of the 1990s . with mr . @ xcite , we worked on the fundamentalof both the electron and nucleon electromagnetic form factors from ipe at intermediate energies . this technique has been successfully used for the analysis of experimental data on the nucleon and @ xmath4c and @ xmath5li . @ xcite and measurements of the form factors were made for the first time in the timelike range of @ xmath3 ranging from 0 . 05 to 0 . 05 ( gev / c ) @ xmath6 . in refs . @ xcite , the authors proposed to use ipe at intermediate ( including @ xmath7 resonances ) energies and below @ xmath8 to study the overall electromagnetic structure and scale it up to @ xmath9 . though experimental data @ xcite and the @ xmath10 process are now available , there still exists a wide range of @ xmath3 ( up to @ xmath11 ) , where the form factors can not be measured directly in these experiments . on the other hand , the intense electron beam can now allow one to perform more detailed experiments at ipe aimed at directly studying the electromagnetic structure and carry out a multipole experiment similar to those for photoproduction and electroproduction (( , _ e . g . _ , @ xcite ) . these methods can be interesting topics . for example , in the @ xmath12 region it is challenging to study the @ xmath3 properties of the matter - light - force interactions found in the constituent particle states @ xcite . it is , therefore , worth recalling the earlier discovered properties of the photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe to further substantiate possibilities of studying the electromagnetic and weak structure of the system on the basis of the ipe process in the first resonance region , and to evaluate the validity of this method . the motivation for studying ipe in the first resonance region is the possibility of studying the nucleon weak structure by utilizing the same techniques as for the electromagnetic structure . this method is based on the lie algebra ( na ) , and on the remarkable property of ipe . in the ipe process the creation of the @ xmath2 pairs of equal energy ( at the ` ` quasithreshold ' ' ) is done by the born mechanism , whereas the rescattering - force interactions are at the level of radiative corrections up to the maximum @ xmath7 and @ xmath13 gev ( the` ` quasithreshold ( ' ' ) @ xcite . due to this fact , the above two methods for the pion electroproduction and photoproduction can be justified in the case of ipe up to the indicated limit @ xcite . this allows us to avoid the difficulties when using the ipe method ( or the electroproduction method ) for extracting the induced form factors of the processes . furthermore , in the case of ipe there is no strong kinematic restriction as to the @ xmath14 process and no kinematic restriction of any of the induced pseudoscalar nucleon form factors to the cross section of ` ` ' ' ' processes , such as @ xmath15 , present because of multiplying by the lepton ##s . information about the pseudoscalar nucleon form factor @ xmath16 , which is almost meaningless for the general case , is important because @ xmath16 contains pairs of states with the pion quantum number and , therefore , it is related to the chiral symmetry group . this would allow us , _ e . g . _ , to test the goldberger treiman theorem . another aim of this article is to draw attention of researchers to theand @ xmath1 as a new and unique laboratory for investigating the atomic structure . we could use these processes for determining the magnetic resonance energy based on the study of the @ xmath17 interference pattern @ xcite . on the other hand , use of the " process @ xmath18 in experiments with low - energy particles with large # ##s of the dilepton and large squared momentum transfer to the nucleus could give rise to generalized parton dynamics as described in @ xcite . this section is organized as follows . in sec . i we present the general formalism for the mathematical treatment of the reactions @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 , and @ xmath21 . in sec . iii we present our two - dimensional model for the description of these three reactions and compare the theoretical results with experimental results . to clearly describe our method , we present a simplified version of the model , which satisfactorily fits the data of the photoproduction and electroproduction . in sec . iv , we outline the method of determining the nucleon - coupling factors from low - energy ipe and discuss the possibility of its application to studies of the ipe effects on the nucleon . "it is equivalent to calculating the pseudoscalar - scale amplitude from the same ipe data , and summary of the results is given . further results are given in ref . we present the formulas for the amplitudes , derivation of the quasithreshold relations for the multipole moments on the basis of the principle of the first - order - approximation , and derivation of the hall effect . we consider the processes @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 , and @ xmath21 in the framework of the unified model . this approach is natural because in the one - dimensional approximation , due to the @ xmath22 - model , research into these three processes is equivalent to the study of the process @ xmath23 with the electric field @ xmath24 , where @ xmath25 , @ xmath26 , and @ xmath27 correspond to the pion photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe , respectively . this allows us to calculate properties of the ipe dynamics on the basis of a suitable experimental model for the electroproduction and photoproduction and to evaluate the properties of the unified model for these three processes . the @ xmath28 -the element for the electroproduction in the two -

space interaction of interactions ,the first one . to this model , we apply such general principles , as analyticity , unitarity , and gauge theory and the phenomenology of the processes @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 , considered in the context of the born ( including ipe ) model . we use a simple version of the model , which describes the experimental data satisfactorily with a finite number of parameters ( called growth factors ) . this allows one to carry out a simple analytic continuation from the spacelike to timelike model of @ xmath3 . for isovector amplitudes , the born - @ xmath102 coupling relations without addition of zero ##s are used , with the wave functions representing the magnetic moments of the @ xmath103 resonance . the isoscalar amplitudes are represented only by the born terms since the @ xmath103 resonance does not correspond to them due to the isospin effect . in refs . @ xcite , it was shown that this approach is successful . the transformation of experimental data for the processes electroproduction , photoproduction , and ipe in the total - energy domain from the threshold model to @ xmat##h104 gev . however , this method is useful for our purpose , namely to formulate the method for extraction of the form factors in the timelike domain , for the following reasons . first , in the frequency - relation approach , the wave functions of the magnetic resonance region are expressed through the corresponding periodic form factor and the phase function of the @ xmath7 - scattering @ xmath105 . this reduces to the number of fitted parameters , which is very useful for the ipe method . second , in the @ xmath103 approach , the electric @ xmath106 and magnetic @ xmath107 quadrupoles , which ( like the magnetic dipole @ xmath108 ) undergo excitation of the resonance @ xmath103 , contribute to not more than 15 % of @ xmath108 . for example , the photoproduction methods @ xcite use the expression @ xmath109 for the @ xmath110 ratio . phenomenological arguments for the @ xmath3 dependence of the @ xmath110 and @ xmath111 ratios are not stable yet and depend upon the results of their derivation from electro##production ratio ( see discussion of this problem in ref . @ xcite , p . 698 ) . however , these ratios do reach , respectively , 10 and 20 % up to @ xmath112 ( gev / c ) @ xmath6 . based on the standard model of ( _ , _ e . g . _ , refs . @ xcite ) , we see that an analogous situation takes place , for @ xmath113 , at energies up to @ xmath114 0 . 5 ( gev / c ) @ xmath6 . however , in the first stage of our analysis we neglect the quadrupole excitations of @ xmath103 , which we consider to be a good approximation for systems with unpolarised nucleons . the following method of reggeization provides us with estimates of the invariant amplitudes for @ xmath115 and for @ xmath8 @ xcite @ xmath116 therefore , for a general @ xmath46 - channel description , we should use a non - @ xmath102 - equation with a solution at finite energies for the isovector of @ xmath117and without stopping for the transition amplitudes , taking into account their physical properties . first , the coupling relations with the correlation functions which describe the spontaneous expansion of the @ xmath103 terms converge very quickly up to @ xmath118 \ gev for all the terms @ xmath66 . then , we take the s - @ xmath102 coupling relation without stopping for the transition amplitude @ xcite for the isovector of @ xmath119 and we get the following formula for the isoscalar coupling @ xmath120 where @ xmath121 , @ xmath122 \ ; , \ nonumber \ { { 1 } \ ] ] and @ xmath123 \ ; , \ ] ] with the @ xmath7 = ##s @ xmath124 and the magnitude of the coupling is : @ xmath125 . the terms @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 converge only to the term @ xmath117 . note that @ xmath53 and @ xmath54 are the kinematic components of @ xmath55 . ., these terms are ruled out kinematically because these terms enter into the wave equation through the combination @ xmath128 which is equivalent to @ xmath129 , where @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 are the two dimensions which have been shown to have no kinematic connection @ xcite . in standard numerical analysis , the combination @ xmath132 = 0 \ ; , \ ] ] which is equivalent takes the form of the equation @ xmath127 ( [ 1 : c5 ] ) , in case of the singularity of @ xmath55 . the two terms @ xmath133 are used to describe the local correlation of the @ xmath103 { @ xmath134 } ~ [ _ { ( x , z , \ beta ^ 2 ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath135 , @ xmath105 is the local correlation function of the @ xmath7 - scattering amplitude , for which we have the expression from ref . @ xcite , and @ xmath136 with the equation @ xmath137 @ xmath138 , & ~ ~ \ ;_ 1 = \ frac { 1 } { 2 } ( w + m - q _ 0 ) , \ \ \ beta _ 1 = \ frac { 1 } { 4 } ( w + m ) ( m _ \ pi ^ 2 -

[ 1 : 1 -ph - n ] we compare results of our model for the differential cross section with @ xmath140 - photoproduction data . in fig . [ fig : e - pr - n1 ] we have comparison with the electroproduction data on the model for the [ @ xmath141 and the @ xmath142 parts of the cross section @ xmath143 \ ; . \ ] ] the differential cross sections for the differential electroproduction of pions by electron and proton virtual channels are shown in fig . [ fig : e - pr - n2 ] . in addition , we have quite a good comparison with the pion photoproduction and electroproduction data for unpolarized electrons , as in the case of the @ xmath103 channel ( @ xmath144 gev ) . in the case of the @ xmath140 photoproduction , the results are quite good compared to @ xmath13 gev ( @ xmath145 gev ) , see fig . [ fig : ph - pr - n ] . it is possible that our model can be further improved by using the quadrupole model of the @xmath103 and ( @ xmath146 and @ xmath147 ) are the correlation functions . finally , a still more simple model should include , in addition to the quadrupole corrections , corrections of the nucleon - and high - energy ` ` tails ' ' to the absorption parts of the amplitude to give a balanced distribution of the corrections . furthermore , the continuation of the actual absorption parts of the amplitudes into the unobservable part of the path integrals , @ xmath148 for @ xmath149 , requires consideration of the quasithreshold interaction ( derived from the analyticity ) between the transverse and longitudinal multipoles @ xcite in which ` ` tails ' ' multipoles interact @ xcite . on the contrary , the analytic continuation with the resonance ( [ eq : ima ] ) is immediate . however , keeping in mind the nature of contemporary experimental data , the above - mentioned resonance model proves to be very useful ( see ref . [ fig : ph - pr - n ] - [ fig : ph - pr - n2 ] ) . application of the model to the model for ipe shows an important application of thethe contribution of the born terms with @ xmath3 and their distribution in the region of the threshold @ xmath150 @ xcite . this relative dominance of the born terms has a time - dependent effect . it is due to the quasithreshold theorem @ xcite , which states that at the quasithreshold , @ xmath151 , the ipe amplitude exceeds the smallest value in the transition region from the threshold up to @ xmath13 gev . this remarkable dynamics of ipe distinguishes it essentially from the photoproduction and electroproduction , where rescattering increases amount @ xmath152 . let us explain the quasithreshold nature of the ipe amplitude . at @ xmath153 the multipole amplitudes behave in the same way @ xmath154 therefore , at @ xmath155 , the electric ( @ xmath156 and @ xmath157 ) and magnetic ( @ xmath158 and @ xmath159 ) moments vanish . in addition , the number of magnetic magnetic moments reduces to the same ones in the quasithreshold according to the quasithreshold theorem @ xmath16##0 which follows from the causality ( 1 ) . the selection rules which follow from the energy level and the value of the angular momentum of the stopped - wave , @ xmath161 , reduce the s - channel resonances of the quasithreshold to the following states : @ xmath162 , _ etc . _ ] and @ xmath163 , _ etc . details of the multipole amplitudes of @ xmath164 and @ xmath153 and the quasithreshold region among them are given in appendix a . since the @ xmath46 - and @ xmath165 - and @ xmath7 - are generated at energies below 1 . 5 gev , we can expect that the dipoles @ xmath156 and @ xmath157 are dominated by the born terms below this energy . this is in agreement with the multipole analyses of the particle photoproduction and also by the h - equations obtained for @ xmath166 . we can , therefore , assume that in the quasithreshold region , the ipe amplitude is dominated by the born terms with energies lower than @ xmath167 . at thebelow @ xmath168 gev , we can solve for the quasithreshold ipe @ xmath169 . \ end { 0 } \ ] ] in the real world , however , we can not apply strictly the quasithreshold conditions and , therefore , the compensation model ( described above ) is needed . in determining the optimal parameters of the system for determining the form factors , the ` ` compensation curve ' ' @ xcite will apply . the curves are defined as curves in the @ xmath170 plane in which the differential cross section is given only by the compensation equation . these curves can be obtained by comparing photoproduction coefficient data with the differential cross section and using the compensation theorem for implicit functions ( more information on the compensation curve is given in appendix c ) . the method of determining the electromagnetic form factors from low - energy ipe is , therefore , based on using the quasithreshold conditions , the realistic dispersion - relation model , and the compensation curve . this method has been successfully used in the experiments on the electrons and nuclei @ xmath4c and @ xmath5li @ xcite . .

[ cols = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , options = " ^ " , ] in table [ tab1 ] , we have values of the same form factors observed in experiments on the nucleon . in table . [ tab1 ] , the same experimental values are given for @ xmath171 and @ xmath172 because in this @ xmath3 - region these form factors can be related with each other via the wave function by the quantity @ xmath173 . the quantity @ xmath174 , taken from the experimental calculations @ xcite , has a significantly higher experimental uncertainty than the experimental quantities @ xmath171 and @ xmath172 . this is explained by cancellation of experiments with the same error in the spectral function of @ xmath174 which , however , is explained by the one - photon exchange observed in the region @ xmath175 . we can see that this result is not time - dependent . thus the same experimental uncertainty can be found for @ xmath##171 and @ xmath172 . of course , having high - quality data for ipe one can not use the relation of @ xmath171 with @ xmath172 in determining these quantities . the calculations of @ xmath171 are not consistent with the calculations of the nucleon number theory in framework of the symmetry and the vector - meson dominance of @ xcite . let us look at the problem of determining the form factor @ xmath176 of the @ xmath177 vertex at @ xmath178 . whereas the analysis of the differential cross section for the electroproduction with unpolarised electrons at the @ xmath12 vertex at @ xmath179 instead of the compensation region allows one to obtain information about the form factors of the @ xmath177 vertex , this analysis is not very useful for ipe because the shape of the spin curve which describes @ xmath180 in the quasithreshold is not preserved at lower values of @ xmath3 . it turns out that the analysis of asymmetry @ xmath181 ( [ x _ 1 ] ) in the dilepton region near the quasithresholdgive so that : . we consider the term @ xmath93 , corresponding to the term @ xmath181 . this can be extended to solve for @ xmath182 at the quasithreshold with taking into account formulas ( [ t _ 5 - f _ i ] ) , ( [ t - k - expantion ] ) and ( [ gk - expansion ] ) @ xmath183 the first term of the taylor series [ eq . ( [ t _ 5 - f ] ) @ xmath184 _ { { \ bf k } = 0 } \ ; , \ ] ] is constant in the quasithreshold . it follows from the formula ( [ m - thr - constr ] ) . substitution of @ xmath93 for @ xmath153 and for @ xmath185 where @ xmath186 _ { \ bf k = 0 } . \ ] ] in the @ xmath103 series , the terms @ xmath156 and @ xmath157 are replaced by the real parts , and the imaginary parts of the terms are zero . behaviour of @ xmath106 and@ xmath187 corresponds to less than 15 % of that of @ xmath108 . multipole moments @ xmath188 and @ xmath187 , due to the size of the @ xmath189 region , generally have to be very small , as it is seen in studies of photoproduction ( focusing on the spectrum ) . thus , with a good approximation , we have @ xmath190 since the quasithreshold relations ( [ gk - k ] ) seem to be only realized in a very small range of @ xmath3 , the term @ xmath181 seems to be equivalent to @ xmath191 in the @ xmath103 region . the existence of @ xmath181 would , therefore , allow one to study further the information about the nature of the magnetic field , and to obtain information in the form of @ xmath176 at @ xmath113 . this is possible because the reduction of the background part of the amplitude to @ xmath93 is strongly correlated in the quasithreshold region , the background part reduces to @ xmath192 for @ xmat##h182 = 1 . now let us consider the theoretical possibility of investigating the new nucleon transition related to the first half - transition described by the matrix [ @ xmath193 \ x _ 5u ( x _ 1 ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath194 is the full - scale component , and @ xmath195 and @ xmath196 are the induced and induced pseudoscalar correction factors , respectively . an alternative description of ipe which includes the fourier commutators , pcac , and completeness allows one to obtain a low - energy state at the threshold , @ xmath197 and @ xmath198 , corresponding to the approximate chiral symmetry and @ xmath199 amplitude . minimization of the continuum corrections at the quasithreshold extends this process up to @ xmath13 gev @ xcite with the continuum corrections being exactly the same as in the lattice - based approach . then , one obtains for the first component of the @ xmath200 amplitude at the quasithreshold , with the leading terms being @ xmath201 @ xcite , so that @ xmath202 \bigr \ } , \ { { \ } \ ] ] where the range of the @ xmath203 , @ xmath204 is defined as @ xmath205 , @ xmath206 , and the quasithreshold values of the decay ##s @ xmath207 @ xmath208 as measured in these experiments , first of all , @ xmath209 and @ xmath210 . it is possible to use first this experiment @ xmath211 however , it is difficult to obtain reliable information about @ xmath16 in these experiments since its contribution to cross section is kinematically suppressed ( it is suppressed by the lepton masses ) . in the @ xmath14 - capture and @ xmath212 - capture experiments , there is a kinematically suppressed decay range of @ xmath8 , @ xmath213 , from which the weak coupling factor can be determined , but with a small error . for example , the value obtained from measurements of the @ xmath14 - decay in hydrogen @ xcite ##s @ xmath214 . @ xmath16 has also been measured in the presence of polarized light .@ xmath215si ##m @ xcite . this ( [ long . part : ca ] ) shows that the kinematic component of the @ xmath16 contribution is absent when the ipe data on the quasithreshold is used for measuring @ xmath16 . in this case , the pseudoscalar scale factor @ xmath216 can be determined in the range corresponding to @ xmath217 ( which corresponds to @ xmath13 gev ) . using the quasithreshold kinematics , one can avoid the # ##s that are encountered when applying the standard method to the analysis of electroproduction processes . first we shall apply the rules of integration . first , using the @ xmath218 and @ xmath219 values obtained from the analysis of the ipe data on the nuclei @ xcite , we obtain the data points for the longitudinal distribution of the @ xmath220 amplitude at the quasithreshold . these data points , which can be interpreted as integral data , are shown in fig . [ 1 : 1 - exp ] . for @ xmath216 we obtain the dispersion relation without subtractions : @ xmath##221 the residue of the pole @ xmath222 is determined by the pcac relation . when only the @ xmath223 - pole term is considered for @ xmath16 , the result is inconsistent with the experimental results as shown in fig . [ fig : 1 - exp ] ( bottom line ) . therefore , the slater integral in fig . ( [ g _ p : dr ] ) should be zero . it could be approximated by the sum of possible intermediate non - proton and proton states with the same quantum numbers . however , since the contribution of nonresonant two - electron states can be determined by the electronic transition , it is , therefore , reasonable to approximate the integral in ( [ g _ p : dr ] ) with the resonance - pole term . a satisfactory description is obtained if one has the following equation for @ xmath216 with the following set of parameters : @ xmath224 where @ xmath225 , the @ xmath226 weak - coupling constant @ xmath227 is given by @ xmath228 , and @ xmath229 and @ xmath230 are the coupling constant of the @ xmat##h223 and @ xmath226 interact with the nucleon , respectively . as seen from the definitions of the cross - coupling terms , one must expect that @ xmath231 to exhibit the behaviour of another model ( in addition to the goldstone model ) in which the electric field is equal for all atomic masses . this behaviour is demonstrated in the models with the nonlocality which exhibits chiral symmetry of @ xcite . note that the pole of @ xmath232 in eq . ( [ g _ p ] ) , being slightly higher than the poles of the known contributing models @ xmath233 and @ xmath234 , is useful for comparing the obtained experimental data on ipe . in fig . [ 1 : gp - 1 ] we show the ratio @ xmath235 in comparison with the ratio obtained by @ xmath14 - capture of the @ xcite and in comparison of data on the @ xmath236 electroproduction off the surface near the threshold @ xcite . the error bars on the bottom line indicate that the values of @ xmath216 determined by this model are of high quality . one can see that the ratio of. . @ xcite agrees with the two - component dominance hypothesis in a large range of values , unlike our model in which the hypothesis is valid only in the small @ xmath102 region , whereas in the range the size of continuum is large . note that the contributions of the pion radial excitations , @ xmath233 and @ xmath234 , which are rather distant from this region , are small and their consideration would only slightly increase the value of @ xmath237 . the contribution of this second term in ( [ x _ p ] ) will be reduced by considerably if one replaces the channel @ xmath238 with the recently discovered channel @ xmath239 @ xcite , due to the strong multichannel nature of this state . in this case , the hypothesis will remain , that the state with @ xmath240 in the range 500 - 800 mev is true for all the obtained ipe states . let us assume that a single signal of the initial state of this isotriplet was observed in the @ xmath241 channel @ xcite and interpreted as the first radial state of the system in the framework of the relativistic .and @ xcite based on the covariant approximation for two - particle equations . using this formula for @ xmath242 and taking the formula for the @ xmath226 cross - coupling constant in the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model generalized by using effective quark ##s with a wider scale , @ xmath243 mev , we obtain @ xmath244 . there are no suitable numerical calculations for this coupling constant now . in the njl model , the consideration of radial motion of electrons requires assuming some nonlocality . since a successful interpretation of the @ xmath7 ##6 constant in that model enforces conditions to go beyond the limits of the standard model and take the corrections into account @ xcite , it follows that a satisfactory interpretation of @ xmath245 in that model does not require assuming some nonlocality . of course , a more reliable interpretation of @ xmath226 requires analysis of other processes with @ xmath226 . analysis of this state would also raise the question on the su ( 3 ) partners . a careful ( statistical ) analysis of the other processes is , therefore , desirable in this energy state . we have demonstratedthat the subsequent analysis of ipe is necessary for obtaining the necessary information about the electromagnetic structure of atoms at the sub - @ xmath0 - ##s of the timelike values of @ xmath3 and the nucleon weak interaction at the spacelike values . the question is interesting right now , _ e . g . _ , in connection with discussion of the relative structure of the nucleon ( _ , _ e . g . _ , @ xcite ) and quasinuclear states @ xmath246 state @ xcite . analyses of the experimental ipe data in the _ @ xmath7 - region enable one to determine the value of the scale of @ xmath171 at timelike values of @ xmath3 which are quite consistent with the calculations in the case of the unitary analytic vector - valued form of @ xcite . the inevitable step that is necessary for the determination of the electromagnetic structure of atoms - isobar ##s in the timelike @ xmath3 - region is a multipole analysis of ipe similar to that for the photoproduction and electroproduction , _ e . g . _ @ xcite . at present , with the intense weak interactions being the, it is possible to perform experiments aimed at carrying out that analysis . for a study of the dispersion - effect model in the second and third @ xmath7 ##li nuclei , the multichannel nature of the nuclear interaction must be taken into account , _ e . g . _ , by the method of ref . @ xcite and by the spin uniforming method @ xcite . as we have mentioned , our method was used in the study of the pion - induced dilepton effect on the heavy and light nuclei . it is worth making some remarks about the analysis of the effects of the @ xmath5li nucleus with a @ xmath236 nucleus at 1 mev / s @ xcite . the missing mass analysis of the data has shown that about half of the events are due to disintegration ##s of the nucleus which are caused by the particle + @ xmath247 . + on analyzing this data it was assumed that the neutron - proton interaction was described by the neutron - proton model , and the binding energy ( the wave function of the @ xmath248 ) was calculated from the neutron pole model @ xcite . the other results belong to the nuclear+ @ xmath249 . + when both the reactions were conducted ( with and without fission of the nucleus ) , the cross section on the nuclei was supposed to be additively connected with the cross section on the individual nuclei and nuclear effects were taken into account via averaging . in both cases , our model was used for the ipe on the individual nucleon . the obtained values for @ xmath171 are therefore approximately consistent with the values in ref . @ xcite . in the case of the reaction without fission of the nucleus , we observed there the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleus in the timelike @ xmath3 region for the first time . however , in the indicated reaction , unique information about the electromagnetic structure of the nucleus in the timelike region was lost . therefore , it appears at present that there is no satisfactory description of the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleus in the timelike region . a proper description must take into account both the constituent character of the nucleus ( and the corresponding physical properties ) and more subtle ( than the screening ) the nuclear effects . however , it should be noticed that a more reliable description of the excited state @ xmath250 requires answering a number of questions , includingtheoretical and experimental . in the pseudoscalar model , states of strange nature are possible , as for @ xmath251 , the @ xmath252 and @ xmath253 glueballs , @ xmath254 holes , and multiquark states . however , both the experimental and lattice calculations give values of those unusual states of less than 1 gev . therefore , the most likely interpretation of @ xmath250 seems to be the quantum quantum pion excitation . the authors are grateful to s . b . gerasimov , v . a . meshcheryakov , and a . b . pontecorvo for their information and interest in this topic . yu . a . receives financial support provided by the votruba -

, ll - . m ] ) and ( [ c : el + , ll + . m ] ) must be used with care when carrying out the continuations of the application of the born relations for ipe into the unphysical case @ xmath319 . however , it follows that application ( from the beginning ) of the multipoles @ xmath318 and of @ xmath320 is not possible in the timelike case . thus we shall introduce a pair of terms @ xmath321 , and @ xmath3 where the inner products of the functions of the photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe are given only by the born relations . let us consider thethe cross section of virtual photoproduction is the sum of two functions @ xmath322 where the first term is the born cross section and @ xmath323 takes into account the final - state interaction and the interaction with the born component of the amplitude . to establish the conditions under which @ xmath324 we apply the spectral theorem for implicit solutions . using this method , if equation ( [ phi - cond . ] ) allows the points @ xmath325 , @ xmath326 , @ xmath327 , and the function @ xmath323 and the partial derivatives of the first term are continuous in the vicinity of the point @ xmath328 and the derivative @ xmath329 at this point is far from zero , that is , @ xmath330 then there exists only one function @ xmath331 which satisfies equation ( [ phi - cond . ] ) in the vicinity of the point @ xmath332 and has the derivative @ xmath326 at @ xmath325 , @ xmath333 . this function and its partial derivatives are continuous in the vicinity of the point @ xmath332 .according to this theorem , if we have at least one point in the plane of @ xmath334 , where the effects of rescattering and their interference with the born one compensate each other , then , since the cross section is continuous in the physical region , there is a surface of ` ` 0 ' ' in this space on which the cross section is the born one . the intersections of this surface with the plane @ xmath335 define compensation curves in the plane @ xmath170 each of them being characterized by its initial value of @ xmath3 and the cross section ( [ dif . cr . r . ] ) of the born one of them . thus , we have a one - parameter family of the compensation curves with @ xmath3 as a parameter . consider the plane @ xmath25 in more detail . we shall use @ xmath336 instead of the @ xmath102 , where @ xmath84 is a scattering angle in the i . e . plane . if the compensation takes time , then in the plane @ xmath337 we ought to have the compensation curve @ xmath338 continuous in the physical region . roughly speaking , there will be compensation curvesof this is , because the function @ xmath339 can also be represented as a polynomial in powers of @ xmath340 : @ xmath341 and the function @ xmath342 can have several real roots @ xmath343 . however , according to the rules stated above , the curves do not intersect , since no one electron can pass through the same point . in the case of the pion photoproduction , the experimental data are used to calculate the compensation curves @ xcite . to this end , it is necessary to find out the intersection points of the born differential cross section with the electric born cross section and place these points in the plane @ xmath337 or @ xmath344 . in fig . [ fig : 1 - curv ] the compensation curves for the experimental pion photoproduction are calculated . calculating the born cross sections , we take into account the interaction of the electron only with the charge . therefore , in these calculations the experimental cross sections are completely described by the calculated compensation terms . we can see that at low energies , the compensation curves pass through right angles in accordance with the electric born model ( ebm ) @ xcite . the compensation curves show us that anapplicability of ebm to the cross section , to the whole frequency range , and to the corresponding frequencies , gives a more complete and accurate description . of course , there are also compensation curves corresponding to the first order amplitude . however , if one assumes that for each of the corresponding electroproduction and ipe , when @ xmath166 , the compensation curves are not much different from the compensation curves for the photoproduction @ xmath345 , then along these curves the frequency dependence of each of the processes should be assumed . in the resonance region , this assumption would be incorrect if the behavior of @ xmath3 did not correspond to the exact reconstruction of the helicity ( or multipole ) structure of the surface of the corresponding crystal . in the magnetic resonance region , calculations , _ e . g . _ , in the dispersion theory , which together with the results of the theoretical models ( _ e . g . _ @ xcite ) and with the results of the phenomenological analysis of the electroproduction process ( _ e . g . _ @ xcite ) , yield the dominance relation of the magnetic moment moment of the @ xmath103 associated with the change of@ xmath346 . # ##s reduce this situation to that of @ xmath178 . using our dispersion theory , it was found that the compensation angle @ xmath347 is identical with @ xmath3 for the cross section of the state @ xmath348 with the corresponding excited state at @ xmath349 gev @ xmath350 . this result was given by the formula @ xcite for the timelike interaction of @ xmath3 : @ xmath351 . for the second and third order interactions , the solution of the equations for electroproduction ( _ e . g . _ @ xcite ) showed a significant improvement ( with @ xmath352 ) of the helicity curve for the excitation of the electrons , which is not necessary for solving @ xmath353 . the compensation angles are also for the interactions of the charged state induced by the polarized @ xmath354 - - @ xmath355 / [ d { \ sigma } _ { \ perp } / dt + d { \ sigma } _ { \ sigma } / dt ] \ ; . \ ]] for example , at @ xmath356 gev the reaction in @ xmath357 ( [ ph - asym ] ) takes place in @ xmath358 for the @ xmath359 photoproduction . since at high energies and at @ xmath360 ebm ( without any specific model for the sharp forward reaction in @ xmath361 for the @ xmath359 photoproduction ) changes the angle and direction of @ xmath362 in the forward region , the compensation curves for @ xmath362 above the resonance region go through approximately the same range of the reaction @ xmath363 as for @ xmath364 . this phenomenon is explained by model ##ically . the plausibility of assuming that the compensation curves at high energies and small angles and at @ xmath166 are not significantly different from the corresponding curves for @ xmath25 is confirmed by successful application of ebm to the description of the mechanism of electroproduction and @ xmath365 at high energies and @ xmath366 @ xcite . in this case , the compensation curves allow us to determine the optimal initial conditions for studying the coupling factors @ x##math367 and @ xmath368 in support of the quantum electroproduction and ipe . m . amaldi , m . fubini , m . furlan , _ electroproduction at _ energies and _ _ _ _ , springer series in theoretical physics * 55 * ( springer , berlin , 1979 ) . surovtsev , yu . a . tkebuchava , yad . fiz . * 55 * , 2138 ( 1992 ) . blokhintseva , yu . a . surovtsev , a . nagy , acta physica slovaca * 55 * , 351 ( 1999 ) . titov , a . kmpfer , eur . rev . a * 8 * , 217 ( 2001 ) . berger , m . diehl , m . pire , phys . a * 523 * , 265 ( 2001 ) . lutz , m . friman , m . soyeur , nucl . a * 713 * , 265 ( 2003 ) . bratkovskaya , m . cassing , m . mosel , nucl . a * 686 * , 568 ( 2001 ) . geffen , phys . rev . * 8 * ,1745 ( 1962 ) ;
