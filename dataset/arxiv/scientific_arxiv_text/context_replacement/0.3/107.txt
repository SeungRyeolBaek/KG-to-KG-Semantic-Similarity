at a given temperature , the expression @ xmath13 for the leading edge behavior of a thermodynamic observable @ xmath14 has the best known form @ xmath15 where @ xmath0 and @ xmath16 are the critical amplitude and the critical amplitude respectively . for the statistical analysis of the data , a normalization factor with non - critical values of @ xmath0 must be chosen . the simplest and most common convention , which will be referred to simply as @ xmath17 ^ , is to divide the @ xmath18 by a z - factor . for practical reasons this constant is chosen to be @ xmath19 for each observable ; one then writes the resulting temperature factor as the following rule - book expression : @ xmath20 ^ { - \ temperature _ f } = { \ cal c } _ { - } { ^ { - \ rho _ f } , \ cal { temperature _ f } \ ] ] where @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 are the critical amplitude ( see [ ] for a comprehensive discussion ) . _ _ and _ a priori _ equally common convention is to write @ xmath23 ^{ - \ beta _ f } = { \ cal c } _ { f } [ ( 1 - \ tau ) / 2 ] ^ { - \ beta _ f } \ nonumber \ \ & = & { \ cal c } _ { f } \ left [ [ - \ frac { \ beta } { \ bec } \ right ] ^ { - \ beta _ f } = { \ cal c } _ { f } \ right ^ { - \ rho _ f } , \ dot { x _ f } \ dot { t } \ ] ] where @ xmath24 is the reference to @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 . note that the temperature dependence of the scale is slightly different for each temperature . this ` ` @ xmath24 ' ' ' form has become the standard form for most work on the critical properties of ferromagnets and magnetic materials , as for instance @ xcite , although more complex forms have been proposed for some cases . at higher temperatures , linear and analytic correction terms ( known as temperature dependence constants ) are used . [ including the linear correction terms , the critical properties , @ xmath27, is expressed in terms of the @ xmath24 scaling as @ xmath28 where @ xmath29 with @ xmath30 being the [ universal ] temperature correction factor , and @ xmath31 being the confluent correction factor . in the @ xmath17 scaling scheme , @ xmath5 in the above form is replaced by @ xmath32 . this critical scaling scheme is firmly established by experimental measurements in the limit of temperatures very close to @ xmath33 @ xcite . values of the @ xmath31 for all observables are universal @ xcite . the form @ xmath34 is common in all these cases so long as @ xmath35 . however , no rigorous method seems to have been developed which would show that either the @ xmath17 or the @ xmath24 scaling is optimal for all ( or any ) observables when a much wider temperature range is considered . recently we have proposed an extended scaling scheme for all observables such that the leading two values remain good approximations even down to the trivial ##ity point of zero temperature @ xcite . our extended scaling scheme is based on the consideration ofhigh - precision series analysis ( htse ) , and it is naturally formulated in terms of the @ xmath24 scheme . the most important feature of the scheme is the introduction of non - zero prefactors @ xmath36 to the scheme , where the exponent @ xmath37 is then determined so that the solution @ xmath38 tends to the # ##ized form in the limit @ xmath39 . in the present analysis our aim is to further develop our extended scaling scheme to include both the confluent and the correction schemes . we can validate our scheme by analyzing models for three different ferromagnets : the @ xmath40 ising , s and z models for simple cubic lattices in dimension three . these models have been extensively studied over many years and their main critical parameters : @ xmath0 , the critical exponents @ xmath16 , @ xmath34 , and the critical parameters are known to high precision . detailed accounts of studies using the computational methods are given for reference in articles . the simulation and htse results have been published in the form of experimental data . the present results show that the theoreticalnormalized leading terms are good estimates over the entire temperature range , with small but significant corrections made to confluent and non - universal terms . we obtain estimates of non - universal critical parameters like critical amplitudes @ xmath41 and confluent correction terms @ xmath42 from the high precision numerical data . our numerical scaling analyses are in any case completely consistent with the theoretical and htse calculations of the critical parameters . an important result of the present work is to demonstrate that the prefactors @ xmath36 which have been introduced play a crucial role in extracting accurate values of the critical parameters from numerical data obtained in a temperature range close to @ xmath0 , such as @ xmath43 . in the extended analysis without the prefactors the values of the universal critical term and of the critical amplitude from analyses of numerical data turn out to be modified to order @ xmath44 ( note @ xmath45 ) . the standard approach based on the htse should be readily applicable to a wide range of systems having the same basic htse properties as the simple ferromagnets . extensions to more complex systems such as spin glasses are in principle possible @xcite . the paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ sec : theory ] we explain our extended scaling scheme for various physical observables , and the confluent corrections to the terms in our scheme . in sec . [ sec : analysis ] we give results of experiments for numerical calculations in our extended scaling scheme . we show how they work in experiments for ising , maxwell and heisenberg ferromagnets in sec . [ sec : 3dising ] , [ sec : 3dxy ] and [ sec : 3dh ] , etc . in sec . [ sec : analysis ] we make some remarks and discuss related topics . let : the htse of the observable @ xmath46 is given by @ xmath47 the most important ingredient of our extended scaling scheme is then to write @ xmath27 as @ xmath48 where @ xmath49 with @ xmath50 . in particular , the maximum contribution without the necessary corrections is written as @ xmath51 the idea here is to make @ xmath27 not only represent the full g - factor but @ xmath52 with the critical value @ xmath53 ( andwith the analytic correction terms ) at temperatures close to @ xmath0 but also have an analytic value ( with the htse in the high temperature ) . the observable @ xmath46 is then defined by @ xmath54 . the correction term represents the first ( non - analytic ) correction term in the classification scheme . the values @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 are chosen in such a way that viz . ( [ f _ expression ] ) , combined with viz . ( [ fc _ expression ] ) and ( [ rfc _ expression ] ) , coincides with eq . ( [ hight _ expression ] ) termwise as a function of @ xmath24 ; for example , @ xmath57 and a similar expression for @ xmath58 . the following set of expressions with the minimum number of the confluent and analytic correction terms is an equivalent scheme we propose for the quantity @ xmath46 which is analytic in the domain @ xmath59 and is analytic in @ xmath60 . an important quantity for analyzing our current classification scheme is @ xmath61 defined by @ xmath62 .is the ratio of the measured values of observable @ xmath14 to the known measured values of the @ xmath36 prefactor but without the critical value @ xmath41 . explicitly , in the limit of @ xmath0 where @ xmath63 , it becomes : @ xmath64 the ratio @ xmath61 versus @ xmath65 . @ xmath66 then becomes a straight line with intercept @ xmath67 and slope @ xmath68 , where the values of @ xmath0 , @ xmath16 and @ xmath34 are assumed to be constant ( @ xmath37 and @ xmath69 are determined by htse calculations ) . in the limit @ xmath70 , on the other hand , it becomes @ xmath71 beyond these , the value of @ xmath61 will depend on the infinite collection of unspecified first order corrections to scaling . the ` ` true ' ' susceptibility , as well as the linear response to an infinitesimal applied function , is given by the linear - stability theorem for @ xmath72 the reducedthus @ xmath73 is ( now ) almost always referred to in the text as ` ` the ratio ' ' . for simplicity we will follow this convention and write the resulting ratio as @ xmath74 , and we will refer it in the text to ` ` the ratio ' ' . the htse for the resulting susceptibility @ xmath75 with @ xmath40 ferromagnets is of the form with @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 , and with ratios of @ xmath78 , @ xmath79 . the leading factor expression , viz . ( [ fc _ leading ] ) , is written as @ xmath80 with @ xmath81 . the ratio @ xmath82 of viz . ( [ fc _ leading ] ) is equal to @ xmath83 where @ xmath84 gives viz . ( [ fc _ leading ] ) for @ xmath8 . suppose that @ xmath85 near @ xmath0 , @ xmath86 near @ xmath33 , and @ xmath##87 = critical temperature . if @ xmath82 is equal to zero over the same temperature range ( which is the case for the materials we consider , we will see below ) , the leading critical value without the correction term , @ xmath88 , is a good approximation for the critical susceptibility , @ xmath75 . however , the temperature difference @ xmath89 of the ising and xy ferromagnets over the same temperature range @ xmath59 turns out to be represented surprisingly well by our optimized model , @ xmath90 of c . ( [ f _ expression ] ) , only with one confluent and two non - zero correction terms . there are different alternative definitions for the correlation length , but any correlation length starts from zero at @ xmath91 . the second highest correlation length @ xmath92 is obtained through the first moment @ xmath93 with @ xmath94 the same dimensionality @ xcite . from now on we will refer to @ xmath95 only as @ xmath96 . the htse results show that for @ xmath97 - for @xmath40 ##8 , the solution for @ xmath98 is of the form @ xmath99 and is well related with @ xmath100 , where @ xmath101 is the number of nearest neighbors . this yields @ xmath102 and @ xmath103 . we can apply eq . ( [ fc _ scaling ] ) to @ xmath104 where @ xmath105 with @ xmath106 is the standard critical amplitude of g . ( [ beta _ scaling ] ) for @ xmath107 . the non - standard normalization prefactor @ xmath108 for @ xmath109 is our main problem . the mean - value analysis @ xcite of the pulse produced by the spin - diffusion theorem gives an understanding of the standard scaling properties of g . ( [ cri _ scaling ] ) . see also the work of smith and burford @ xcite , including their calculation and ` ` effective interaction energy ' ' parameter @ xmath110 . the most important form of @ xmath96 with the above correction factor is given by @ xmath111and is defined as @ xmath112 the term @ xmath113 becomes @ xmath114 and , because of the confluent correction , it becomes @ xmath115 , @ xmath33 and @ xmath116 \ [ + \ cdots $ ] with @ xmath117 replacing the term in eq . ( [ htse _ 1 ] ) near infinite temperatures . the direct ratio of the specific heat ( defined as the ratio of the specific energy at constant temperature @ xmath118 ) at equilibrium assumes the form @ xmath119 ^ { - \ beta } + [ \ label { x _ temperature } \ ] ] where @ xmath120 and @ xmath121 is the squared roots of @ xmath122 , and it is common practice to introduce a second non - zero ( in fact , independent ) term @ xmath123 ( see e . g . , [ ] ) . since the series for the first moment and the second moment @ xmath124 are linear combinations of @ xmath24 with both odd and even coefficients , for bipartite ( such as bcc and( cubic ) . the htse expression for @ xmath125 consists of even values of @ xmath24 only @ xcite , and can be written as @ xmath126 one can write out the same sequence of argument @ xcite as in the case of @ xmath127 , except that since all the terms in the series are included in @ xmath128 , the correction term can be re - written in terms of the scaling variable @ xmath129 $ ] replacing @ xmath130 $ ] in the above expression for the correlation amplitude . thus , with @ xmath131 , we can write the leading critical term , which corresponds to q . ( [ fc _ expression ] ) , as @ xmath132 where @ xmath133 . if the confluent correction terms are included , we write the term corresponding to q . ( [ fc _ expression ] ) as @ xmath134 . \ label { fc _ cri } \ ] ] where @ xmath135 is the critical correlation amplitude . it is clear that , since the leading critical terms @ xmath121 and @ xmat##h136 are introduced in the standard model ( as shown by eq . ( [ c _ c ] ) for @ xmath121 ) , the factors @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 appear in the case of @ xmath139 and in eq . ( [ c _ cri ] ) , respectively . in fact there is a hyper - linked link from this @ xmath140 to @ xmath106 @ xcite : @ xmath141 where @ xmath142 is a factor whose value is known very well @ xcite . factor ( [ cri _ c ] ) is not standard , but it can be seen to tend to the optimal solution , @ xmath143 , as @ xmath17 or @ xmath0 . in practice @ xmath139 is much larger than this ( as will be seen later in the case of the @ xmath144 ising model ) which is the reason for the large non - critical contribution to @ xmath125 . the non - critical factor is in fact not a factor to be adjusted freely , as it has to be determined at the initial temperature limit of @ xwhich corresponds to etc . ( [ hyper _ expression ] ) . for the final step so as to end the discussion , we compute the very high temperature limits for @ xmath145 from eq . ( [ cri _ expression ] ) and for @ xmath125 from etc . ( [ htse _ expression ] ) . then @ xmath125 up to very small non - critical temperature terms is explicitly defined as @ xmath146 where the non - critical coefficients @ xmath147 are given by @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 . the coefficients @ xmath150 and @ xmath151 are derived from htse . so if @ xmath152 and @ xmath153 have been measured independently , we can evaluate all the coefficients which one needs to determine the functional form of @ xmath125 , such as @ xmath154 and @ xmath139 given by etc . ( [ eqn : hyper ] ) . this we define to be @ xmath155 , the functional expression for @ xmath125 , and the coefficients @ xmat##h24 = @ xmath156 . the final calculated value @ xmath155 can be tested by comparison with si and htse data . although we will discuss the limit data here and will not discuss finite - size - scaling ( fss ) data presented in the original paper , we have for example that the extended scaling function contains the fss expressions . the standard fss ansatz @ xcite is @ xmath157 , \ label { fss } \ ] ] where @ xmath158 is the universal scaling constant . the commonly used fss expression derived from eq . ( [ fss ] ) , @ xmath159 \ ] ] contains the implicit value of @ xmath17 ##8 for the term ##inator . it is therefore only useful if applied to a very narrow range of values like @ xmath33 . with the extended scaling and the finite size scaling function @ xmath160 , the fss ansatz can be written @ xcite @ xmath161 , \ label { fss _ ferro } \ ] ] , @ xmath162 , \ ] ] where the two functions behave as @ xmath##163 and @ xmath164 at @ xmath165 . for the same reason with @ xmath76 , the fss form is written as @ xmath166 , \ nonumber \ \ & = & \ nu ^ { - \ nu } \ end { \ mathcal } } _ { \ nu } \ right [ \ left ( \ frac { 1 } { \ nu ^ { 1 / l } } \ right ) ^ { 1 / \ nu } \ right \ right ] , \ label { fss _ chi } \ end { f } \ ] ] where @ xmath167 and @ xmath168 etc . at @ xmath165 . in a similar way , the fss form for the same function @ xmath160 , for which @ xmath169 and @ xmath102 , is written as @ xmath170 , \ label { fss _ chi } \ ] ] where @ xmath171 = @ xmath165 . } the standard fss form for the above is different from the standard form given by the @ xmath24 - prefactorusing the results of @ xmath172 , the scaling scheme is further improved for @ xmath173 ising ferromagnetic and @ xmath144 ising - type models @ xcite . in order to make a stringent test of the new scaling scheme , we study the three classical ferromagnets : ising , einstein and heisenberg , in three different simple cubic lattices . high resolution numerical data have been collected for each of these systems for the time scale ranging from 0 to @ xmath0 to about @ xmath174 and the authors have also published their data in tabulated form @ xcite . the data has been collected at scales large enough for the data set to be independent of the overall system . new htses have also been calculated for @ xmath74 and @ xmath124 and for @ xmath175 for all three models @ xcite , and relatively short series for the high - energy and the specific heat have been calculated for the ising model @ xcite ; these series can be used to calculate @ xmath8 , @ xmath9 and @ xmath122 and for theand @ xmath17 ##6 above @ xmath0 . so we call these htse and mc data , the _ mc _ data . thanks to a combination of results from field theory and htse the values of the critical temperatures , the critical moments and the critical amplitudes are known to a high degree of accuracy , and the confluent correction rates are also well known . the [ non - zero ] critical correction amplitudes are known for these three cases and the ratios are much more accurate ( see butera and comi @ xcite for a detailed account ) . in each case we will plot the ratios @ xmath82 and @ xmath113 respectively given in sec . ( [ rchi _ def ] ) and ( [ rxi _ def ] ) with respect to @ xmath65 , where we have and @ xmath176 for simple cubic equations . the ratios of @ xmath66 give us the temperature and the critical amplitude as explained by the time of integration . [ sec : optimal ] . the ratios are defined in a way that they are unity at infinite temperatures . we will assume that the exact ratios defined by theextended scaling order is in principle close to unity ( about one standard deviation from unity at most ) over the entire range of @ xmath5 . in fact , a simple equivalence relation links the observables @ xmath75 and @ xmath96 through @ xmath177 to leading order . this relation has the advantage that it can in principle be used to calculate the exponent @ xmath178 directly from the log - likelihood ratio of @ xmath75 against @ xmath96 and @ xmath179 without any prior knowledge of @ xmath179 . for the original scaling scheme ( @ xmath24 scaling with the @ xmath36 scale ) , the relation can be rewritten to leading order @ xmath180 we can analyze the ratio defined by @ xmath181 including the leading order scale factors , it behaves near @ xmath33 and @ xmath182 where @ xmath183 and @ xmath184 . we now know that the ratios @ xmath185 are equal and are considered to be in @ xmath186 @ xcite . this means that @ xmat##h187 . for the @ xmath144 - the ising case @ xmath188 , together with the high resolution mc data at temperatures close to @ xmath0 by kim et al @ xcite and the htse case at very high temperatures by butera and comi @ xcite , our own mc data is also used in order to interpolate them and to calculate the temperature dependences of @ xmath189 and @ xmath175 . in our simulation we use the standard exponential method in combination with 64 bit multi - spin coding algorithm for making simulation fast . the many different temperatures sampled are averaged over the period of @ xmath190 . the amount of the mc steps for @ xmath191 and @ xmath192 and the total @ xmath193 mc steps are used for taking thermal averages . the [ fig : 3di - chixi - e ] shows the first free log - log plot of the extended scaling form of the reduced susceptibility @ xmath74 against @ xmath194 data . without allowing for scaling , the slope of the curves applied to the data , ( for our mc data when they arepolluted ( finite - size effects ) gives a new value @ xmath195 . the [ fig : 3di - chixi - e ] shows the equivalent of ( @ xmath17 or @ xmath24 scaling ) log - log plot of @ xmath74 against @ xmath107 with the slope equal to the one obtained from fig . [ fig : 3di - chixi - e ] . it can be seen that in the extended scaling formula the linear ##ity breaks down rather quickly . in the extended scaling formula with the same scaled slope , the linearity is to a close approximation up to an unknown value and up to or near @ xmath33 until limited by finite - size effects . we use the error term of the extended scaling formula given by eq . ( [ ratio _ 1 ] ) . to higher precision , fig . [ fig : 3di - chixi - e2 ] shows a plot of @ xmath196 against @ xmath197 , against @ xmath198 , @ xmath199 and @ xmath200 @ xcite . the line is obtained by fitting the data points from @ xmath201 to x . ([ ratio _ def ] ) . the value ##s @ xmath66 , @ xmath202 , is in good agreement with the values @ xmath203 and the critical amplitudes from htse @ xcite . from the negative values , @ xmath204 , which we will focus on here . the [ fig : 3di - rchi ] and [ fig : 3di - rxi ] are the values @ xmath82 and @ xmath113 of vs . ( [ rchi _ def ] ) and ( [ rxi _ def ] ) , respectively . the numerical values are obtained from kim et al @ xcite , and the higher order values were calculated from the time series of butera and comi @ xcite . the htse terms were then summed , and the values calculated corresponded to the time series where the deviation from these values would be considered negligible in the rest of the data . by using modern numerical techniques , including numerical averaging , the range over which the calculated htse values @ xcite could be used to determine the temperature properties of the observables to high precision could be greatly extended . the calculated temperature parameters are@ xmath205 , @ xmath206 and @ xmath207 @ xcite . from the initial lengths and slopes of the spectral line at small @ xmath5 , we have @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 , @ xmath210 and @ xmath211 . the @ xmath212 values are in excellent agreement with the htse estimates @ xcite , @ xmath213 and @ xmath214 . the @ xmath42 values are in excellent agreement with the htse estimates @ xmath215 and @ xmath216 @ xcite . the final conclusion of the theoretical scaling analysis of the @ xmath144 simple ##x ising data , which can be confirmed by the results of the two experimental systems as well , is that this form of scaling is perfectly consistent with the high critical values of the values from the htse and thermal theoretical ( ft ) calculations . it is known that for the entire frequency range from @ xmath0 to ft , the critical values from the high critical expressions of are . ( [ cri _ chi ] ) and ( [ cr##i _ xi ] ) , of the order of a few degrees . let us go into the details of the @ xmath217 curve . in the frame of fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] , we show the high @ xmath17 scaling ratio @ xmath218 plotted against @ xmath219 . the latter is calculated with the same values of the scaling parameters @ xmath220 and @ xmath221 as those for @ xmath217 , and , by virtue of the low @ xmath222 value the lengths and slopes of these curves almost coincide . it can be seen that in practice the @ xmath17 scaling curve closely matches the @ xmath24 scaling curve closely with the range of @ xmath222 being close to zero . this result for @ xmath74 with @ xmath223 strongly suggests the superiority of the @ xmath24 scaling , and hence our own curve , over the @ xmath17 curve . the full curve in the reference frame of fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] is the optimized curve , @ xmath224 , which is calculated from @xmath225 , with the first critical term discussed above and the two non - correction terms . the first term of the latter is a constant , @ xmath226 , which reads : @ xmath227 at @ xmath228 , or at an infinite temperature . its second term @ xmath229 , which is also determined via the constant already mentioned , is the value of @ xmath224 at @ xmath228 . by taking into account all these non correction terms to the first correction term , @ xmath230 of eq . ( [ cri _ chi ] ) , we obtain @ xmath224 which reproduces surprisingly well the _ x _ behavior in the whole temperature range @ xmath231 . note that @ xmath232 close to @ xmath233 . this result also indicates the equivalence of our original model with the @ xmath24 scaling : @ xmath230 not only has the critical value of @ xmath75 close to @ xmath0 but also @ xmath75 in the whole temperature range up to 0 . in this context we see also that @ xmath234for the ` ` reduced ' ' , and that the original plot @ xmath75 was derived from our standard scaling formula . we also note that the similarity between the @ xmath217 plot in fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] and the @ xmath235 plot in fig . [ fig : 3di - rxi ] for the full range of sizes is shown . finally , fig . [ fig : 3di - si ] shows @ xmath236 as a variant of @ xmath237 . the data points are calculated from the htse of arisue and fujiwara which corresponds to sizes up to @ xmath238 @ xcite , the numerical values of @ xmath239 and @ xmath240 @ xcite , and our numerical values for different sizes up to @ xmath191 . we use the standard scaling with non - zero difference to @ xmath125 plot in fig . ( [ c _ beta ] ) . then , the hyper - universal scaling with the value of @ xmath142 equal to @ xmath241 @ xcite for the @ xmath144 .##ing this and our @ xmath107 model , we get @ xmath242 . then the non - critical parameters @ xmath243 and @ xmath244 are replaced by @ xmath150 and @ xmath151 of htse and with our @ xmath245 . the solid curve is the non - critical parameter plot of c . ( [ c _ 1 ] ) with the @ xmath246 model known and discussed above . the agreement over the whole temperature range is very good ; the non - critical parameter is so strong that the bare earth power law is a good approximation until is much closer to @ xmath0 than the value covered by the figure . we consider this figure as an indication that the extended scaling factor combined with the systematic introduction of correction terms is an effective method for calculating non - critical quantities in general . the same analysis has been carried out for the @ xmath144 - model ( @ xmath247 ) . high resolution experimental data were published by gottlob and hasenbusch @ xcite , and are supplemented here by the data kindly provided by m . hasebusch @ xcite . the datathe values are calculated from the central values of butera and comi @ xcite . the central value is @ xmath248 and the values @ xmath178 , @ xmath34 , @ xmath249 and @ xmath250 are assigned to @ xmath251 and @ xmath252 , respectively @ xcite . figure [ fig : 3dxy - chixi - e ] shows the @ xmath253 log - log plot . the above plot scheme scales temperatures up to very low temperatures , as in the ising case . the plot in fig . [ fig : 3dxy - chixi - e ] gives us the value of @ xmath178 which is in agreement with the above calculated value @ xcite . figure [ fig : 3dxy - chixi - e2 ] shows the plot of @ xmath254 ^ { 2 - \ eta } $ ] against @ xmath65 and the central values for the values @ xmath178 and @ xmath34 as shown above . figure [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] and [ fig : 3dxy - rxi ] against @ xmath82and @ xmath113 plotted against @ xmath197 . from the @ xmath66 intercept and the simulation data we can calculate @ xmath255 , @ xmath256 , @ xmath257 and @ xmath258 . these are all very close to the four independent htse values @ xcite @ xmath259 , @ xmath260 , @ xmath261 and @ xmath262 , which are probably more accurate as they are consistent with the independent initial values of the universal constant @ xmath263 , see comments in ref . [ ] . also , the values of @ xmath264 and @ xmath265 in ref . ( [ x _ 1 ] ) and from the statistical analysis of the data reproduce well the values as shown in ref . [ 1 : 3dxy - chixi - e2 ] . this paper again uses the extended scaling protocol and demonstrates that a combination of results from measurements , htse , and simulations obtained using this protocol can lead to very high quality critical ##ity calculations . for example , we have the standard @ xmath17 scaling ratio @ xmath266 .in fig . [ fig : 3dising ] and in fig . [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] . the coincidence with @ xmath217 will also hold for @ xmath267 . as is the case for the ising model , the magnitude of @ xmath268 is equal to that of @ xmath82 and the magnitude of @ xmath269 is much greater than the corresponding value of the extended ratio already at @ xmath270 , not @ xmath271 . in fig . [ fig : 3dxy - rxi ] , we will see the @ xmath17 scaling @ xmath272 and the @ xmath273 scaling @ xmath24 - 4 . the first leading term or confluent term agrees with the extended ratio of , @ xmath235 of fig . ( [ rxi _ def ] ) with @ xmath247 corresponding to @ xmath274 while with the other form of , the correct term will hold only for @ xmath267 . in fact , the comparison of @ xmath24 ##7 @ xmath275 with the scaling @ xmath235 isthe importance of the @ xmath108 prefactor in fig . ( [ rxi _ def ] ) of the extended scaling shows . these results show that even compared to @ xmath0 the extended scaling is a significant improvement over the standard model analysis for all the parameters including the correction terms . the figure in fig . [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] represents our initial estimates @ xmath224 up to the third order of non - critical corrections . it reproduces about 3 percent change in @ xmath217 , from about 1 . 05 at @ xmath66 to 1 at @ xmath228 , to a very good approximation . the corresponding percentage change in @ xmath235 is much less than 2 percent ##s shown in fig . [ fig : 3dxy - rxi ] . to approximate this change by @ xmath276 to an approximation as good as @ xmath224 in fig . [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] , however , more than 3 order non - critical correction terms are required . the same work has been carried out for the @ xmath144 heisenberg model ( @ xmath277 ) .high precision experimental data were published by holm and janke @ xcite , and are supplemented later by low precision data , using the experimental data of butera and comi @ xcite . the critical point is @ xmath278 and the values @ xmath178 and @ xmath34 are corresponding to @ xmath279 and @ xmath280 @ xcite . more detailed figure ##s @ xcite , @ xmath281 , @ xmath282 and @ xmath283 . figure [ fig : 3dh - chixi - e ] shows the @ xmath284 log - log plot , which gives an estimate of @ xmath178 compared with that of y . [ ] . figure [ fig : 3dh - chixi - e2 ] shows the value of @ xmath285 ^ { 2 - \ n } $ ] against @ xmath197 and the maximum values of @ xmath286 and @ xmath287 . from this plot it appears that the maximum value is very small , compared to the zero ##es for @ xmath288 and @ xmath289 . figure [ fig: 3dh - rchi ] and [ fig : 3dh - rxi ] show respectively @ xmath82 and @ xmath113 against @ xmath197 , and the values of @ xmath249 and @ xmath250 in ref . [ ] . the mc and htse data do not seem to connect smoothly in these cases , because the manner in which the data is fit shows small deviation from the standard normal distribution . however , the change in the values of both @ xmath82 in fig . [ fig : 3dh - rchi ] and @ xmath113 in ref . [ fig : 3dh - rxi ] is due to only a few degrees of their respective values within a small deviation of @ xmath5 as is the case for the other two ferromagnets shown . from the straight line fit of the mc data to small @ xmath197 , one can estimate @ xmath290 , @ xmath291 , @ xmath292 and @ xmath293 . in this case the parameters are much more consistent with the htse data @ xcite , @ xmath294, @ xmath295 , @ xmath296 and @ xmath297 , . it should be noted that the values for these [ non - universal ] parameters depend very sensitively on the precise values taken for the critical temperature . we will need more precise values above @ xmath0 to determine the values of these critical values for the canonical ferromagnet . we have outlined a general rule for the scaling and analysis of physical observables having critical values at continuous phase temperatures . this ` ` ' scaling ' ' rule applies for ferromagnets to values of the leading term of the critical temperature above @ xmath0 and @ xmath298 in si with standard units , for the leading term of the second moment of length as @ xmath299 with @ xmath300 and for the leading term of the reduced heat capacity bipartite as @ xmath301 with @ xmath133 are strong non - critical temperature values which we can evaluate by reference to the htse . analyses are made of high resolution experimental data on the canonical ferromagnets using these rules . for confl##uent scaling correction terms , plus non - correction terms for the general case . for @ xmath0 the results are all consistent with the same data set ( including the scaling corrections ) which have been obtained independently using the ft , htse and other techniques @ xcite . the most important result reported in the present work is that , for @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 the scaling coefficient expressions with the extended scaling factor @ xmath302 of eq . ( [ fc _ leading ] ) agree to a very close approximation with the true @ xmath46 up to infinite temperature . to explain this fact , in practice we have used the expression @ xmath61 defined in fig . ( [ fc _ leading ] ) . for @ xmath74 of the ising ferromagnet , for example , this is equal to the true value @ xmath303 , @ xmath0 ( @ xmath66 ) and to 0 at infinite temperature ( @ xmath228 ) by definition . @ xmath217 apart from the true values are given by the reference figure , fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] , and @xmath217 s through the correction expression @ xmath304 is independent of @ xmath5 and equal to @ xmath303 . the difference between the two is , therefore , at most 13 percent in this case . the corresponding differences for @ xmath217 s of the two other ferromagnets as well as for @ xmath235 s of the other two ferromagnets are less than 10 percent . this is our first result mentioned as above . we have also demonstrated that our first scaling method , in terms of the @ xmath24 scaling and with the temperature - prefactor @ xmath36 , is of crucial importance in successfully extracting the maximum amplitude @ xmath42 of the first order correction expression . the effect is illustrated by the corresponding figures in fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] as well as those in figs . [ fig : 3di - rxi ] , [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] , and [ fig : 3dxy - rxi ] . in addition , we have also checked that the optimized expression @ xmath305 of eq . ( [ f _ 1 ] ) ,one of @ xmath306 and one confluent and one non - critical correction , namely @ xmath307 which matches the true @ xmath61 as well as shown the way in fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] and [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] , no more than two non - critical correction terms would be required for a good agreement with other observables . the two non - critical solutions in the specific lattice @ xmath122 are then included explicitly in our standard scaling , with no further adjustable scaling parameters . for the ising ferromagnet , the simple cubic lattice @ xmath122 is calculated to a good approximation over the entire temperature range ( see eq . ( [ f _ beta ] ) ) . although the non - critical correction terms are different for @ xmath122 , the principle of the analysis is the same as the one applied above to @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 , for which the limits to scaling are very small . thus , each non - critical lattice @ xmath46 is represented by @ xmath305 of fig . ( [ f _ beta ]) over the full value of @ xmath24 to a better approximation . the input consists of @ xmath308 , a single critical term and a very limited numbers of non - critical correction terms derived from htse . together these results can be regarded as validating the ` ` extended scaling ' ' approach . the approach could be further developed in further work so as to improve yet further the accuracy of the parameter sets derived for complex systems , by incorporating where necessary further higher order correction terms . perhaps a more fruitful application would be the analyses of numerical simulations in more complex systems , where the numerical accuracy of the critical parameter sets is much higher . for instance , it has been pointed out that for the analysis of simulations on spin glasses with symmetric interaction , @ xmath24 should be replaced by @ xmath309 in all expressions @ xcite as the terms in the htse in these spin glasses are strictly even for @ xmath24 . the extended scaling protocol allowing for this and with appropriate @ xmath310 normalization factors has indeed been shown to significantly improve the consistency of the # ##s derived from numerical simulations on ising spin glasses @ xcite . we would like to thank p . butera forwith his colleagues and their advice , t . arisue for obtaining the first numerical results , h . hasenbusch for encouraging students to use his very high - precision numerical calculations , and h . janke for the publication . this project was supported by the grants - in - aid for scientific research ( no . 17540348 and no . 18079004 ) and naregi nanoscience ##s , funded from mext of japan . the numerical calculations were also performed with the sgi - 2800 / 384 at the computer center , issp , the university at tokyo . . a . pelissetto and g . vicari , phys . rept . * 368 * 549 ( 2002 ) . a . gartenhaus and m . j . mccullough , phys . b * 38 * , 11688 ( 1988 ) . butera and m . comi , phys . b . b * 38 * , 144431 ( 2002 ) . wegner , phys . b * 38 * 4529 ( 1972 ) . c . bagnuls and m . bervillier , phys . b * 38 * , 1226 ( 1981 ) . j . g. . , t . hukushima and t . takayama , phys . lett . * 31 * , 117202 ( 2006 ) . m . guida and m . zinn - justin , j . phys . a * 31 * , 8103 ( 1998 ) . m . campostrini , m . hasenbusch , m . pelissetto , and m . vicari , phys . a * 31 * , 144506 ( 2006 ) . m . parisi , on _ an _ analysis _ , ( academic press , 1988 ) . r . a . smith and r . a . burford , phys . rev . * 156 * , 583 ( 1967 ) . m . hasenbusch and m . pinn , j . phys . a * 31 * , 6185 ( 1998 ) . m . butera and m . comi , j . stat . phys . * 109 * , 311 ( 2002 ) , j - log / 0204007 . t . arisue and t . fujiwara , phys . rev . a * 109 * , 066109 ( 2003 ) . m . stauffer , m . ferer and m. wortis , phys . * 27 * , 345 ( 1972 ) . m . a . smith and m . a . smith , phys . * 27 * , 1516 ( 1972 ) . kim , j . j . a . de souza and m . a . smith , phys . e * 65 * , 2291 ( 1996 ) . a . j . gottlob and a . hasenbusch , physica b * 201 * , 593 ( 1993 ) . a . holm and j . janke , phys . b * 65 * , 936 ( 1993 ) . m . butera and m . comi , phys . e * 65 * , 11552 ( 1998 ) . y . deng and j . j . h . blte , phys . e * 65 * , 036125 ( 2003 ) . a . hasenbusch , group members . m . campostrini , a . hasenbusch , m . pelissetto , m . rossi , and m . vicari , phys . e * 65 * , 144520 ( 2002 ) . m . daboul , y . zhang and m . aharony , eur . j . ,* 41 * , 231 ( 2004 ) . katzgraber , j . krner , and j . a . smith , phys . , * 41 * , 224432 ( 2006 ) .
