[ xrd ] ) can be indexed with the reference thcr @ xmath3si @ xmath3 ##as unit cell with the parameters @ xmath58 and @ xmath##59 , in good agreement with those described in ref . . the spin - susceptibility measurements were obtained on heating with an ac field of 1 oe at 1111 k . the real data ( fig . [ chiac ] ) show the onset of diamagnetism and of the superconductivity at @ xmath60 ##0 . @ xcite first - order dft calculations of the atomic structure were performed using the large - scale linearized - plane - wave method as described in the software package @ xcite . for the exchange - rate functional we used the density gradient method of perdew , brown , and ernzerhof @ xcite . the atomic positions used in the calculations are those obtained from high temperature x - ray spectroscopy . in order to determine the electric field strength ( efg ) tensor at @ xmath61 we solved the poisson equation for the charge distribution to obtain the electric potential @ xmath62 and then @ xmath61 from @ xmath63 where @ xmath64 passes through the nuclei at @ xmath65 . since the efg tensor is extremely sensitive to the charge distribution a well converged basis function is required to determine theconvergence with respect to the efg tensor components . we calculated the squared radii of 2 . 6 @ xmath66 for aa and 2 . 6 @ xmath66 for ab and as , with @ xmath67 , where @ xmath68 is the mean muffin tin ( mt ) diameter of the mt ##s and @ xmath69 the sum of the reciprocal space vectors . we used as for the rounding off of the angular momentum mass vectors in the spherical harmonics and inside the mts . reciprocal space was sampled with the monkhorst - paxton @ xcite scheme on the @ xmath70 sphere . a smearing of 270 mev was obtained within the methfessel - paxton scheme @ xcite and convergence of the efg tensor with respect to all these parameters has been carefully studied . once the efg tensor components are calculated the nqr values of @ xmath0as and @ xmath1rb can be calculated from fig . 2 of the main article . the two frequencies , ( @ xmath71 ) @ xmath72 4 . 5 mhz and ( @ xmath73 ) @ xmath72 3 .7 mhz are in good agreement with the measured values ( @ xmath71 ) @ xmath7414 . 6 mhz and ( @ xmath73 ) @ xmath74 ##4 . 5 mhz and the discrepancy represents an estimate of the accuracy of the dft calculation which is likely to not properly account for the spatial variation . @ xmath0as nqr and @ xmath1rb nmr spectra were derived by measuring the change of the echo frequency in the @ xmath75 ##a sequence as a function of the irradiation temperature . at a higher temperature the @ xmath0as nqr spectra was also obtained by merging the fourier transforms of all of the signals recorded at different temperatures . no new physical features appeared in the spectra . we pointed out that any large number of spurious phases in feas and the @ xmath3as ( materials used for x - ray imaging ) does not affect the @ xmath0as nqr spectra since these materials are very stable and the internal field shifts the echo frequency to much higher values . but in feas @ xmath3 the @ xmath0as nqr spectrum is nota slightly different frequency range . @ xcite the narrow @ xmath13rb nqr spectra were obtained from the fourier transform of half of the echo pulse amplitude of the full echo pulse amplitude . @ xmath1rb the standard model for the narrow @ xmath76 transition is shown in fig . [ rbnmr ] . the model is also consistent with the @ xmath1rb quadrupole model determined from the nqr spectra . @ xmath0as spin - spin relaxation rate @ xmath40 was obtained from nqr by recording the decay of the pulse amplitude @ xmath77 after reading @ xmath75 ##a sequence . the data could be fit in combination with @ xmath78 with @ xmath79 . the value of @ xmath80 greater than 1 and the observed temperature value of @ xmath81 ( fig . [ figt2 ] ) should be consistent with redfield due to the relaxation @ xmath82 . thus we can write @ xmath83 , with @ xmath40 the spin - spin relaxation rate . in case of an anysotropic spin - lattice relaxation rate , et ##h _. @ xcite is a correct expression for @ xmath84 . in case of a nuclear interaction @ xmath16 , with the @ xmath85 axes of the efg and the @ xmath86 axis one should write : @ xmath87 where the notation @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 refers to the external spin dependence with respect to the crystallographic @ xmath86 axes . in fact , @ xmath90 corresponds to @ xmath0as nqr @ xmath14 . @ xmath91 is calculated by measuring the anisotropy in @ xmath14 relative to the one found in co - factor bafe @ xmath3as @ xmath3 @ xcite . after the errors have been corrected by redfield contribution one finds that @ xmath0as @ xmath40 is spin independent ( cf . [ figt2 ] ) , with @ xmath92 . the deviation of @ xmath93 from this , as it is seen in the case of two dipolar interactions in a spin domain @ xcite is probably a consequence of the partial symmetry of thenqr spectrum . taking into account of @ xmath94 , we also measured the @ xmath95 - dependence of @ xmath0as nqr spectrum to below 100 nm and did not observe any significant change . @ xmath1rb nmr @ xmath14 was measured in a @ xmath96 k magnetic field , with just the high and low of the powder spectrum of the central line shown in fig . [ rbnmr ] , corresponding to grains with the @ xmath86 - axes perpendicular to @ xmath97 . the distribution of @ xmath1rb and central line magnetization in a two - pulse pulse is similar exactly to @ xmath98 the recovery is shown in fig . [ t1rbnmr ] and one finds , similar to what we found in @ xmath0as nqr , two components appearing at room temperature . the long components were measured only in nmr since in nqr the very slow @ xmath1rb relaxations and the much lower signal intensity make the measurements very difficult . the short component , the only component present at @ xmath99 k , was thein nqr irradiating either @ xmath1rb @ xmath100 , or @ xmath2rb @ xmath101 . the recovery of the magnetization is fit according to the recovery laws : for the spin relaxation of @ xcite @ xmath102 for @ xmath1rb and for @ xmath2rb . the ratio between the @ xmath14 of the two nuclei for the fast neutron decay was measured at a few different temperatures at 4 and 8 °c and @ xmath104 ( cf . [ t1rbnqr ] ) , in good agreement with the ratio of the squares of the gyromagnetic moments of the two nuclei @ xmath43 , confirming the adequacy of the recovery laws we have used to calculate @ xmath14 and the assumption that the relaxation is driven by electron spin fluctuations . note that if the relaxation is driven by efg then @ xmath14 should agree with the square of the electron spin quadrupole moment and we should give @ xmath105 a value about 10 % higher than the observed value . we have calculated the spin relaxation of @ xmath0as @ xmath##14 modified the nqr model by decreasing the amplitude of the radiofrequency , so that we irradiated a frequency of about 20 khz in the spectrum . we found that the recovery laws did not vary significantly across the spectrum ( fig . [ t1vsfreq ] ) . namely , @ xmath31 , @ xmath32 , @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 showed a negligible temperature dependence . it should be noted that @ xmath32 and @ xmath31 appear to slightly depend on the thermal history ( i . e . , the cooling time ) , an aspect that will be the subject of future research . finally , we also found that @ xmath32 , the frequency of the observed thermal relaxation , was zero at 20 khz by increasing the recovery laws to less than @ xmath106 @ xmath39 ( fig . [ t1vsfreq ] ) .
