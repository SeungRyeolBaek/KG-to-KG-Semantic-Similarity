formation and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of molecules @ xcite have recently been achieved based on ultracold experiments with magnetically - tuned feshbach resonances @ xcite . in these experiments , feshbach coupling is induced by tuning a specific atomic orbital in the scattering continuum , which allows for an efficient scattering of the atoms into space . this coupling works for virtually all the molecules , and can create ultracold molecules from various materials including bose condensates @ xcite , pure thermal gases @ xcite , and pure thermal gases @ xcite . feshbach molecules have interesting and interesting properties . they can have only one electron - bound quantum state , and the quantum state can strongly interact to the scattering state via feshbach coupling . we may ask the following question : should feshbach molecules also be considered as molecules in a specific rovibrational state or as molecules of scattering states near the nucleus ? this question is also crucial for the studies of the bec to bcs ( bose - hall - schrieffer coupling ) crossover in the fermi ##ons , which allows for a clarification of the exact nature of the feshbach molecules @ xcite . molecularstates near feshbach resonance have been recently investigated based on new and sophisticated two - body and three - body models @ xcite and multi - channel resonance theory @ xcite . these results suggest that the feshbach molecule is generally a stable mixture of the target atom in the closed channel and long - range molecule pair in the open scattering channel . near resonances with large # ##s , the molecules can be best described as atoms in the open channel . for narrow resonance , as shown by numerical simulations @ xcite , the closed channel dominates and the short - range molecule pair is obtained . in this paper , we use a simple multi - channel model to describe the interacting atoms near a feshbach resonance ( sec . ii ) . to account for the wide interaction range of the atoms , we introduce a spherical gas potential , which allows us to analytically model the molecular electronic state in different channels and their threshold behavior ( sec . iii and sec . iv ) . finally , we apply our model to feshbach molecules in the noble gas simulations and to characterize the associated feshbach molecules ( sec . we model the interaction of two large , ultracold atoms with molecules @ xmath0 based on the open channel @ xmath##1 that supports the scattering continuum and the closed channel @ xmath2 that supports the foreign bound state . the wave function of the atoms is then expressed as @ xmath3 , where @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 are the states of the open and closed channel , respectively , and @ xmath6 is the inter - channel separation . we assume the energy @ xmath7 is described by a black hole potential with an interaction range of @ xmath8 , see fig . ( 1 ) . for @ xmath9 , the potential energy of the open channel is , and the closed channel @ xmath10 . for @ xmath11 , the open ( outer ) channel has an interaction potential of @ xmath12 @ xmath13 , and a distance of @ xmath14 between the channels . the wave function is the schrdinger equation : @ xmath15 . the bound state with energy @ xmath16 corresponding to the scattering continuum is described by the closed channel . , width = 211 ] the solution of the above equation for the potential energy @ xmath17 can be expressed as : @ xmath18 where the scattering length @ xmat##h19 and @ xmath20 are parameters , @ xmath21 are the eigen wave numbers " for @ xmath11 together with the eigen states @ xmath22 . based on the boundary conditions @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 , we have @ xmath25 the following table shows how in general , closed channel contributes to the photon energy . in quantum scattering theory , feshbach resonances are , in many cases , caused by weak interactions and spin - spin interactions . these interactions are several orders of magnitude weaker than the classical short - scattering energies . it is an approximate approximation to assume @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 . thus , we have @ xmath28 , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 . in this limit , the closed channel contribution becomes significant only when the channel state is close to the continuum , in which case the last term in fig . ( 7 ) diverges . expanding the terms of the closed channel state as @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 , the boundary condition @ xmath33 allows us to expand the last term in eq . ( 7 ) as @ xmath34 . here @ x##math35 is the feshbach coupling constant . to the same order of magnitude , the middle term in equation . ( 7 ) is a constant at the surface and can be expressed as @ xmath36 , where @ xmath37 is the background scattering properties . and ( 7 ) relates to @ xmath38 finally , the relative energy between the continuum and the bare surface can be given linearly by the magnetic field @ xmath39 - the phase shift @ xmath40 , where @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 are the magnetic field of the outer ( closed ) channel . replacing @ xmath16 with @ xmath43 , we can express equation . ( 8 ) in terms of the magnetic field at @ xmath44 where the resonance width @ xmath45 and the resonance position @ xmath46 are given by @ xmath47 several interesting results are shown here . first of all , we find the resonance width is related to by the feshbach coupling @ xmath48 and the background scattering properties @ xmath49 . the wavelength dependence is due to the fact that the scattering amplitude at short wavelengths is proportional to the resonance width . .the short range scattering lengths leads to a strong coupling to the closed channel . finally and finally , the resonance shift is given by exactly @ xmath45 , to the boundary of the bare state and the continuum , @ xmath50 , in eq . ( 2 ) . for a background scattering length @ xmath51 , this distance is approximately @ xmath52 . this result leads to the renormalization " of the feshbach resonance location " in ref . @ xcite . to understand the origin of the resonance shift , we should return to physics . the origin of the scattering shift occurs when the open channel one ( first term ) is exactly cancel by the closed channel one ( second term ) . for molecules with large background scattering lengths @ xmath53 and strong feshbach coupling @ xmath48 , this cancelation can occur only when the bare state is far away from the continuum . a large resonance shift always results . next we turn to the binding energy of the molecules . assuming a positive eigen ##space @ xmath54 , on the continuum , @ xmath55 , where @ xmath56 is the binding energy , we can obtain @ xmath57 , following essentially the same calculation asref . ( 1 ) - ( 7 ) . the solution of ref . ( 11 ) is @ xmath58 where @ xmath59 . = @ xmath28 and the bound states of both directions are close to the origin , respectively , @ xmath53 and @ xmath60 , we can reduce the two equations on the right side of ref . ( 11 ) to such terms as @ xmath36 and @ xmath61 , respectively . equation ( 12 ) then corresponds to @ xmath62 this equation shows the shape of the eigen ##planes of the continuum . similar result is obtained from ref . @ xcite ##r , a different model . we can also see that in the absence of the feshbach coupling @ xmath63 , the solutions of ref . ( 12 ) are @ xmath64 and @ xmath65 ( for @ xmath51 ) , which then correspond to the corresponding bound states of the closed channel and the open channel ( for @ xmath51 ) , respectively . in the presence of the feshbach coupling @ xmath66 , ref . ( 13 ) describes an " level one " - level energy transition , seefig . ( 2 ) , which also illustrates the resonance position shifts . the gap function , however , is not linear as it is in a two - dimensional system . in particular , at small resonance ##s , the bound state generally approaches the continuum quadratically , see fig . ( 2 ) below . far from the continuum , the bound state is the ground state ( the closed channel . , solid state ) . we write ( a ) @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 and ( b ) @ xmath69 and @ xmath68 , where @ xmath70 can be the relevant energy scale . arrows mark the offset resonance positions . arrows show the threshold energy of the bound state . , [ = 268 ] to better quantify the energies of the open and closed channel , we can write the correlation coefficient of the eigen state as @ xmath71 and , with our assumptions , @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 and the mixing angle @ xmath74 are defined as . we see in fig . ( 3 ) that the eigen state generally resembles both the closed channel and open channel . we can introduce the mixing angle @ xmat##h75 = the energy of the closed channel @ xmath76 the energy fraction @ xmath77 can be evaluated by a direct integration of the single channel wave function . however , noticing that the expansion factor leads to a dependence of the bound energy on the bare energy , we can either calculate @ xmath77 from the dependence of @ xmath57 on @ xmath16 , or from the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule @ xmath78 . all these lead to the same result @ xmath79 despite the seemingly complex interactions discussed in previous sections , the feshbach molecules are stable and universal in the scattering continuum . using eq . ( 13 ) with small @ xmath57 and the equations . ( 10 ) - ( 19 ) , we get the binding energy of the feshbach molecule has a simple dependence on the scattering length and varies quadratically in magnetic moment at the surface , namely , @ xmath80 where @ xmath81 . equation ( 20 ) shows the dependence on scattering length and the range energy of the channel molecules in the resonance region @ xcite . finally , taking the limit @ xmath82 gives equation . ( 21) and ( 19 ) , we find the interaction wave function that is purely in the open channel . the spatial resolution is determined by the uncertainty , @ xmath83 , and can be much larger than the interaction with @ xmath84 . in this case , the feshbach molecules are identical to long - range atom molecules in a small open channel . by expanding e . ( 12 ) at large @ xmath85 and expanding eq . ( 13 ) , we find the open channel fraction can be expressed as @ xmath86 where @ xmath87 . from eq . ( 22 ) , we see that @ xmath88 is the first possible example of the open channel admixture . when @ xmath89 or @ xmath90 ( this condition applies when @ xmath91 ) , the feshbach molecule is purely in the open channel . as expected , the threshold regime is wider for resonances with small @ xmath48 and @ xmath92 . we can further determine the maximum " - channel " regime by expanding @ xmath93 to e . ( 19 ) . for resonances with large @ xmath94 ,this region corresponds to @ xmath95 , which , in terms of magnetic field , corresponds to only a small region of @ xmath96 near the center @ xmath46 . for molecules with large @ xmath97 , the open channel covers when @ xmath98 , which covers the full channel region when @ xmath99 , and covers the entire upper half of the channel region when @ xmath100 . based on the range of the single molecule model , we assume the narrow ( wide ) resonances are described as those with @ xmath97 ( @ xmath101 ) . within the width of the feshbach coupling , the molecules associated with the broad ( wide ) resonance are also described as long range pairs in the open channel ( short range pairs in the closed channel ) . we note that this model is not based on many - body interactions . . definition of the @ xmath102li and @ xmath103k feshbach coupling . interaction coupling @ xmath8 is derived from q . @ xcite , see below . feshbach coupling @ xmath48 is derived from eq . @ xmath104 .is constant and @ xmath105 is a constant . [ cols = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , options = " ^ " , ] [ table1 ] ( dashed lines ) and mixing fraction @ xmath77 ( dashed lines ) of the molecules in the @ xmath102li and @ xmath103k feshbach resonance . the curves are derived from eq . ( 18 ) , fig . ( 2 ) and the equations in table 1 . the parameters from multi - molecule measurements @ xcite ( dashed lines ) , from jila ##c # @ xcite ( closed circles ) and the mixing fractions derived from the group @ xcite ( open circles ) are available for comparison . the gray lines represent the current bec - bcs - experiment , @ xmath106 . , n = 268 ] next , we compare our results to the @ xmath102li @ xmath107 and @ xmath103k @ xmath107 feshbach resonance measured in previous bec - bcs experiments @ xcite . these molecules are located near the resonance and in the molecular orbitalthis and the scattering length have been well measured and calculated @ xcite . to model the structure of atoms , we adopt @ xmath46 , @ xmath45 , @ xmath108 and @ xmath109 from recent measurements and numerical simulations . to account for the interaction range of the atomic structure , which at low energies is described by the van der waals law of @ xmath110 , we choose the interaction range @ xmath8 in our model to be the maximum scattering length @ xmath111 defined in 1984 . this choice reflects the correct behavior of the scattering length in the transition state @ xcite . the results are given in table i . in fig . ( 3 ) , we show the maximum binding energy @ xmath57 and the mixing fraction @ xmath77 of the feshbach potential for the two @ xmath102li resonances and one @ xmath103k resonance . the results agree very well with the multi - resonance model @ xcite and the measurements of the binding energy @ xcite , magnetic moment @ xcite and mixing fraction @ xcite . both the c resonance at 834 k and the d resonance are consistent with @ xmath##112 and @ xmath113 , respectively . the open channel - dominated regimes of @ xmath114 210 mhz for the 834 hz li experiments is much larger than the fermi regime of @ xmath115 20 khz for the experiments . ( here the fermi quantum number is @ xmath116 . ) for the k regime , the very long range of the excited state is open channel dominated with energy fractions less than @ xmath117 . therefore , we consider the open channel description of these feshbach molecules in the k regime to be a good one . for the second li resonance at @ xmath118543 g , we obtain @ xmath119 and @ xmath120 31 hz @ xmath121 20 khz . this is an extremely narrow open channel region of less than 1 @ xmath109 m near the resonance , where the gas parameter is a constant @ xmath122 . the experiments based on these feshbach molecules can only be described by open channel coupling pairs and may lead to very different results . we attribute the large difference between the two li resonances to their different couplings @ xmath48 and their differentbackground scattering length @ xmath37 , see table 2 . from the above calculations , we find that binding energy @ xmath123 is an external parameter which depends on the density of the molecule . whether the molecules in the transition regime can be described by one channel model depends on the density . the @ xmath124 parameter , however , is a better and simpler measure to describe feshbach resonances . we find that the two feshbach resonances on @ xmath102li are the two extremes of broad and narrow resonance with @ xmath112 and @ xmath125 . in addition , the two - channel model provides a simple way to determine the bound state of the feshbach resonances . the analytic properties of the molecular binding energy and mixing energy on @ xmath102li and @ xmath103k agree with the above and the theoretical calculations as well . based on the " behavior of the bound state , we use the dimensionless parameter to assess the stability " of the feshbach resonance . we thank p . s . julienne and j . nygaard for the us and u . - s . and cesium groups in innsbruck for the calculations during ourspringer . the project is partly funded by the lise - funded grant of the german research foundation ( fwf ) . a . jochim , j . bartenstein , j . altmeyer , j . hendl , j . riedl , c . chin , j . hecker denschlag and r . grimm , science * 302 * , 2101 ( 2003 ) ; m . greiner , m . j . schmidt , j . c . jin , science * 426 * , 537 ( 2003 ) ; m . zwierlein , m . j . stan , j . j . schunck , j . j . a . raupach , s . gupta , m . hadzibabic , and j . ketterle , phys . rev * , 250401 ( 2003 ) . m . herbig , j . kraemer , j . schmidt , j . schmidt , c . chin , j . - l . ngerl , and r . grimm , science * 301 * , 1510 ( 2003 ) ; m . drr , j . volz , j . marte , and j . rempe phys . rev . * 302 * , 020406 ( 2004) ; y . xu , y . mukaiyama , m . m . al - shaeer , j . c . smith , j . smith , and j . ketterle , phys . rev . lett . * 65 * , 210402 ( 2003 ) . m . marcelis , j . g . j . van kempen , j . j . verhaar , and s . j . j . m . f . kokkelmans , phys . a * 70 * , 012701 ( 2004 ) ; s . j . j . m . f . kokkelmans , j . l . milstein , j . m . chiofalo , j . walser , and j . l . miller , phys . a * 70 * , 053617 ( 2002 ) .
