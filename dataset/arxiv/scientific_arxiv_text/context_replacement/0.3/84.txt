over the past few years , there have been several attempts to dynamically model the movement of polymer chains with brownian dynamics @ xcite , which has more recently been used as the basis for dna - dynamics @ xcite . one of the first and simplest models was given as the rouse model @ xcite , which is a free - spring model @ xcite , where the continuous filament is modelled on a mesoscopic scale with beads connected by springs . the only forces generated by beads are the forces from adjacent springs , as well as gaussian noise . mechanical forces between beads and internal volume effects are neglected in the model in terms of accuracy and computational speed , but the model manages to agree with the properties of polymer chains from experiments @ xcite . other models exist , for example the zimm model of hydrodynamic forces @ xcite between beads , or bending forces can be used to model a wormlike structure and give a model of persistence length @ xcite , see , for example , the model @ xcite or experiment @ xcite on this page . most of the aforementioned models consider the structure on only a small scale . in many applications , a researcher is interested in a relatively large regionof a biological system . " it is then possible to use a hybrid model which is more efficient in the domain of interest , and couple this with a model which is more computational efficient in the rest of the simulated domain @ xcite . an important example for 3d simulation of dna dynamics is binding of a protein to the dna filament , which we study in this paper . the model which we have constructed using two models for a chain of molecules , each with a freely moving particle to represent a binding protein . as the protein approaches the dna , we increase the resolution in the surrounding dna filament to increase efficiency of our models , whilst making them computationally efficient . in this paper we use the hybrid model for simulation due to its relative simplicity and low computational load . such a model is applicable to modelling dna dynamics when we consider relatively low resolution , when hydrodynamic forces are negligible and the distance is much less than the kuhn length of the bead @ xcite . the problem becomes more complicated when we consider dna modelling at higher spatial resolution . in the cell nucleus , genetic information is stored within strands of long and short dna fibres , which are separated into regions . these dna strands are organized into structures related to their function .different proteins can be enhanced or inactivated based upon this process @ xcite . folding also occupies space taken up in the cell by folding @ xcite , and can be altered when required by the cell for certain steps in the cell cycle or to regulate gene expression . the folding of dna occurs on multiple scales . on a large scale , dna is wrapped around histone proteins to form the nucleosome structure @ xcite . this in turn gets folded into a chromatin fibre which is packaged into many higher order structures until we reach the end of the next fold @ xcite . the finer points of how the nucleosome folding occurs in the chromatin fibre and how these are then folded into higher - order structures is still the subject of much debate , with long - held views of mesoscopic dna fibres becoming less fashionable in favor of more complex structures in vivo @ xcite . in the most compact form of chromatin , many regions of dna are not reachable for vital functions such as folding @ xcite . one potential explanation to how this is overcome in the cell is to place small rna molecules at the surface of dna domains when it is folded @ xcite , so that transcription factors can target target genes without having toand into these close - packed regions . this complexity is not captured by the multiscale model of protein folding presented in this paper . however , if one combines the further refinement of the rouse model together with a more detailed hybrid approach in a small region of space close to the target protein , then such a hybrid approach can be used to study the effects of microscopic details on processes over system - level spatial and temporal scales . when taking this multiscale approach , it is important to understand the benefits from including the more detailed model in the hybrid approach and how the accuracy of the model depends on these parameters . these are the main questions studied in this paper . the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secmrbs ] , we introduce a multi - resolution bead - spring model which generalizes the rouse model . we also introduce a discretized version of this model which allows the use of different timesteps in different spatial scales . in section [ section3 ] , we analyze the main properties of the multi - resolution bea - spring model . we prove two main properties giving formulas for the diffusion constant and the end - to - end velocity . we also study the optimal choice of timesteps for numerical integration of the modeland support our interpretation of the results of these computer simulations . our main application area is presented in section [ section4 ] where we present and analyze the molecular dynamics model . we propose a method to increase the resolution in these models on - the - fly using the metropolis - newton algorithm . in section [ secdiscussion ] , we conclude our paper by discussing further extensions of the classical multiscale method ( by including more complex models of dna binding ) and other multiscale methods developed in the literature . we generalize the classical linear bead - spring polymer model @ xcite to include polymers of variable size and springs with variable spring rates . in section [ defmrbs ] , we present the evolution equation for this model as a system of stochastic system equations ( sdes ) . we will also introduce a discretized version of this equation and algorithm [ algoneiter ] , which will be presented in sections [ section3 ] and [ section4 ] where we use the multi - resolution bead - spring model to present and analyze multiscale methods for dna binding . [ defmrbs ] let @ xmath0 be a positive integer . a multi - resolution free - spring polymer of size @ xmat##h1 consists of a series of @ xmath1 springs of length @ xmath2 , for @ xmath3 , followed by @ xmath4 springs which are characterized by their relative length @ xmath5 , for @ xmath6 . the [ @ xmath7 $ ] of beads are related to the law of sdes ( for @ xmath3 ) @ xmath8 where @ xmath9 is the relative diffusion coefficient of the @ xmath10 - th beads . by stokes law , @ xmath11 is the solvent temperature , @ xmath12 $ ] is the diffusion process , @ xmath13 is absolute constant , @ xmath14 is semi - constant and we assume that each spring of @ xmath5 can be equivalently described in terms of the spring chain of @ xmath15 . @ xmath16 we assume that the length of the beads ( for @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 ) is also given by and @ xmath19 given by [ @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 _ [ figmrbeadspring ] ] in figure[ figmrbeadspring ] , we will use the multi - phase free - radical polymer for @ xmath22 . the interaction between the @ xmath23 - th and the @ xmath24 - th bead is determined with the highest accuracy by using the beads and springs with larger grain sizes ( or equivalently with the lattice constant ) . the values of the parameters in the [ defmrbs ] are chosen so that we get the corresponding rouse model @ xcite if we consider @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 . the definition ( [ sdedef ] ) simplifies to @ xmath27 where @ xmath28 , @ xmath29 and we again define @ xmath20 and @ xmath30 as parameters for the beads . in the polymer physics textbook @ xcite , the rouse model ( [ sderouse ] ) is equivalently written as @ xmath31 where the thermal forces @ xmath32 imposed on the beads from brownian motion are given by the equation @ xcite @ xmath33 where @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 . for the remainder of this paper , we will usethe sde is also given in ( [ sderouse ] ) , because we will also use the notation for the # ##ic models . the first discretization of ( [ sderouse ] ) is given by the ito - maruyama algorithm @ xcite , which takes the variable timestep @ xmath36 and calculates the position of @ xmath37 of the @ xmath10 - valued variable , @ xmath38 , and discretised to @ xmath39 by @ xmath40 for @ xmath41 , where @ xmath42 is a distributed random variable with unit mean and unit variance ( i . e . @ xmath43 ) for @ xmath44 . in order to discretize the multi - resolution free - space model , we look for variable timesteps . [ defvartimestep ] let @ xmath45 and @ @ xmath46 , @ xmath47 be positive integers such that @ xmath48 and @ xmath49 for @ xmath50 . let us assume that at least one of the values of @ xmath46 is equal to 0 . we set @ xmath51for @ xmath6 and we compute @ xmath52 the timestep associated with the @ xmath10 - th spring . the [ defvartimestep ] specifies that all timesteps must be integer multiple of the same timestep @ xmath36 . the timesteps associated with the internal springs are also multiples of each other . the time complexity of the multi - resolution bead - based algorithm is computed at integer multiple of @ xmath36 . one iteration of the algorithm is shown in figure [ algoneiter ] . the displacement of the @ xmath10 - th spring is computed at integer multiples of @ xmath53 by computing the relative displacement due to brownian motion , with displacement caused by springs attached to the beads . updated at integer multiples of the timesteps associated with each spring , i . e . @ xmath54 , @ xmath55 in the situation that all beads , springs and timesteps are the same , then we can easily obtain the following result . update number of internal springs which are connected to two springs : + update of the first spring : + update of the second spring : + [ lemc##onsnum ] let @ xmath56 , @ xmath57 , @ xmath58 and @ xmath45 be positive integers and @ xmath0 be negative integer . consider the multi - resolution leaf - spring polymer of equation @ xmath1 with @ xmath59 , @ xmath60 , for @ xmath3 , and @ xmath61 , for @ xmath6 . let the timesteps associated with each spring be equal to @ xmath36 , i . e . @ xmath62 . case @ xmath63 then equation @ xmath64 is equivalent to the sato - maruyama discretization of the rouse model given by equation @ xmath65 . # [ lemconsnum ] shows that the multi - resolution leaf - spring polymer is a generalization of the rouse model . in the next section , we will discuss properties of this model which will allow us to select the appropriate parameter values for this model and use it for multiscale simulations of fluid dynamics . we have selected a multiscale simulation model which varies the kuhn constant of the filament , and we would like to keep track of thethe diffusion constant depends of the resolution regime being considered for the filament . we consider a probability distribution for the system to be _ constant _ if the expected value of the statistic is invariant to the resolution regime being considered for the filament . we consider the _ self diffusion constant _ and _ _ mean average ( rms ) end - to - end distance _ as the properties we consider to be constant in our system , which can be measured by measuring the bead diameter and the number of beads involved . the precise way to measure these properties will be discussed in this article . the _ self diffusion constant _ is given by @ xmath66 where @ xmath67 is the _ centre of mass _ of the polymer chain at time @ xmath39 , which is given by @ xmath68 definition ( [ q : com ] ) is an extension to the definition given by edwards and edwards @ xcite for the centre of mass of a polymer chain on only one side . if all beads have the same diameter @ xmath69 ( i . e . if @ xmath59 for @ xmath70 ) , then equation ( [ q : com ] ) applies to the centre ofmass definition for the classical rouse model . in this formulation , the self diffusion coefficient is given by @ xcite @ xmath71 where @ xmath1 is the number of beads . this definition explains the , on the face of it , linear scaling of equation ( [ q : com ] ) with @ xmath2 . if we assumed that each bead had the same mass , then the mass of each bead would be proportional to its volume , i . e . to @ xmath72 . however , in equation ( [ q : com ] ) , we have used weights @ xmath2 instead of @ xmath73 because they do not represent individual biological objects or nucleosomes , but representations of the filament surrounding them , and the bead density varies with the volume of the beads , which is proportional to their size in this case . if we consider dna sequences , we could use each beads as a tracker for individual base pairs at intervals of , say , hundreds of base pairs away from each other along the dna sequence . the line in the tracker is then drawn between adjacent beads . this linear scaling with @ xmath2 .then , simplified differential equation ( [ q : rousediff ] ) for the classical rouse model . if we consider the same system in a more complicated model consisting of twice as many beads ( i . e . if we change @ xmath1 to @ xmath74 ) , then we have to change the bead radius ( i . e . change @ xmath69 to @ xmath75 ) to get a simpler model with the same diffusion constant ( [ eq : rousediff ] ) . in particular , the size of a bead varies with @ xmath69 ( and not with @ xmath76 ) . in the next section , we extend result ( [ eq : rousediff ] ) to the general multi - resolution beads - spring model . [ lemdg ] let us consider a multi - resolution beads - spring model of size @ xmath1 and a set of timesteps , with each step satisfying the set of conditions @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 . then the average diffusion constant of the linear evolution model by algorithm @ xmath64 is given by @ xmath79 algorithm @ xmath64consider a step of our numerical algorithm . replacing the term corresponding to the @ xmath10 - 1 term by @ xmath2 and repeating all the steps , we see how @ xmath80 changes during the timestep @ xmath36 . since @ xmath9 , the terms cancel after , and the evolution of for @ xmath80 simplifies to @ xmath81 where @ xmath82 $ ] and then @ xmath83 is defined for the values @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 . @ xmath86 let us denote by @ xmath87 the least common value of @ xmath88 when function is evaluated at time @ xmath64 at integer multiple of @ xmath89 . we can derive function @ xmath90 from algorithm ( [ rgequation ] ) if we consider the evolution of @ xmath91 when function @ xmath39 is evaluated at integer multiples of @ xmath89 . we consider the evolution of @ xmath92 for @ xmath93 $ ] , where we used the fact that thesum of normally distributed random variables is also normally distributed . dividing equation ( [ rgequation2 ] ) by @ xmath94 , we obtain @ xmath95 . \ ] ] using equation ( [ dgdef ] ) , we obtain ( [ e : sdc ] ) . the expression ( [ e : sdc ] ) is a modification of that ( [ e : rousediff ] ) used for the rouse model . it is invariant to the parameters such that the distance of the beads @ xmath94 remains constant after integration of the number of beads and bead mass , therefore the semi - constant is zero . we calculate the _ end - to - end distance _ @ xmath96 from one end of the beads to the other @ xcite . an important statistic to be related to this is the _ root mean square ( rms ) end - to - end distance _ of the beads @ xmath97 . the expectation value of the long - term value of the rms end - to - end distance , denoted @ xmath98 , for the modified rouse model is given by @ xcite @ xmath99 we obtain##ize this result yields the following result . [ lemrms ] let us consider a multi - resolution free - spring system of size @ xmath1 under the conditions of size @ xmath77 . then @ xmath100 and the long - term behavior of the rms end - to - end response is given by @ xmath101 and ( [ sdedef ] ) in the system of @ xmath102 linear sdes . however , the sdes corresponding to the spatial coordinates are not linear . we can restrict our analysis to the differences of the first coordinates of each vector in ( [ rmsbond ] ) . let us combine the differences of the first coordinates of the beads into the @ xmath103 - dimensional [ @ xmath104 . \ ] ] linear sdes ( [ sdedef ] ) can be applied to the system of sdes for @ xmath105 in the following system @ xmath106 where @ xmath107 is a two - diagonal matrix given by @ xmath108 @ xmath109 is a two - diagonal matrix given by @ xmath110 and @ xmath111 . @xmath1 - the basis vector @ xmath112 ^ [ . $ ] the stationary covariance matrix , given by @ xmath113 is the solution of lyapunov equation @ xcite @ xmath114 . it can be easily shown that the exact solution of this equation is the matrix @ xmath115 with diagonal elements @ xmath116 @ xmath117 dividing this matrix by n ( the number of elements ) , we obtain ( [ rmsbond ] ) . the end - to - end result can be obtained by @ xmath118 transformed into ( [ eqrmsend ] ) , from ( [ rmsbond ] ) and the assumption that the stationary covariance matrix @ xmath119 is diagonal , we obtain ( [ eqrmsend ] ) . both [ lemdg ] and [ lemrms ] describe theoretical results which have been obtained under slightly different conditions . the [ lemdg ] is valid under a variant of algorithm [ algoneiter ] , but the same property , as ( [ x : sdc ] ) , also holds when we consider the self - similaritycoefficient of the sde formulation of the multi - resolution bead - based model ( [ sdedef ] ) . algorithm [ algoneiter ] is defined in such a way that all the differences corresponding to resolution vanish when the differential equation for @ xmath120 is derived ( see equation ( [ rgequation ] ) ) . in contrast , algorithm [ lemdg ] holds for all values of the number of timesteps associated with the springs . on the other hand , algorithm [ lemrms ] is the coefficient of the sde formulation ( [ sdedef ] ) . if we use a discretized version of ( [ sdedef ] ) , then we introduce a discretization error . this error can be made smaller by using smaller timesteps . in this section , we note that the smallest timesteps are only required in the models with the highest spatial resolution . we consider a family of orthogonal multi - resolution ( omr ) models , to have macroscopic differences corresponding to each regime . [ defomr ] let us consider a single - spring polymer network of @ xmath1 ##2 of radius @ xmath69 connected by @ xmath103 together with the ku##hn for @ xmath121 and indexed by @ xmath65 with timestep @ xmath36 . let us divide the polymer into @ xmath122 regions , @ xmath123 , @ xmath124 , and ##ly , i . e . @ xmath125 the first region contains chains indexed by @ xmath126 and the @ xmath84 - th region , @ xmath127 , contains springs indexed by @ xmath128 . let us associate with each region an average of @ xmath129 , where @ xmath130 for @ xmath131 , for @ xmath127 , and @ xmath132 for @ xmath133 , with at least one region in resolution @ xmath134 which is the region with the highest resolution . higher values of @ xmath135 yield coarser sections of the polymer . we define the omr model , the multi - region bead - based model which consists of @ xmath136 regions of both chains and springs . for the @ xmath84 - th region , we define @ xmath13##7 springs with chain length @ xmath138 and with radius : @ xmath139 followed by @ xmath140 where @ xmath141 is the radius of springs which are equal to the ones which have the same chain length @ xmath138 . we assume that the average radius of springs at chain - length springs with kuhn lengths @ xmath142 and @ xmath138 is @ xmath143 , for @ xmath144 also , we assume that the bead diameter of the first and second bead of the same spring is equal to @ xmath145 and @ xmath146 , respectively . substituting scalings ( [ sjscalings ] ) into ( [ cf : com ] ) , and into ( [ nm1assum ] ) , we find that the omr model is @ xmath147 and into ( [ cf : sdc ] ) , we find that the omr model has the same stress - diffusion coefficient as the above detailed model ( given by ( [ cf : rousediff ] ) ) . in the limit @ xmath148 , wewe use the [ lemrms ] and scaling ( [ sjscalings ] ) to obtain the following rms end - to - end response for the filament : @ xmath149 which is again representative of the range of solutions @ xmath129 , @ xmath124 . since the drift length and drift radius vary with resolution , it is important to consider the relative size of the solution @ xcite . we want timesteps to be sufficiently small so that they do not change too rapidly . using discretized equations of motion [ algoneiter ] , drift terms appear in the solution @ xmath150 , which is proportional to the @ xmath84 - th part of the omr domain to @ xmath151 using scaling ( [ sjscalings ] ) and assuming that @ xmath152 is of the same size as the kuhn length @ xmath138 , we obtain that the size of ( [ driftscal ] ) varies with @ xmath129 . note that @ xmath36 is chosen for the very fine scattering model so that @ xmath153 is small compared to the otherif @ xmath121 , then the correlation coefficient of the omr model , given by ( [ driftscal ] ) is very small compared to @ xmath154 the average lengthscale of the omr model in the @ xmath84 - th region , @ xmath155 if , we compare the number of measurements made by the original detailed single - crystal detailed model with the omr model . the @ xmath84 - th region has @ xmath137 beads , with timestep @ xmath139 . with resolution ( [ sjscalings ] ) , we find that we have @ xmath156 - times more beads in the @ xmath84 - th region , and fewer beads with fewer timesteps . assuming that the computational intensity of the simulation of the detailed model in this region is proportional to the size of the region , @ xmath157 , we can estimate the amount of computational time which is required by the omr model ( as compared to the original model ) . @ xmath158 for example , if we re - scale the detailed model , with the same resolution @ xmath159 , then( [ nm1assum ] ) and ( [ fraccost ] ) note that we scale up our results by the factor of two . in this section we see that results of the omr method match the original single - scale theoretical model . we shall compare this to the results obtained from models ( [ eq : sdc ] ) and ( [ fig : rmse2e ] ) for the rms end - to - end distance and the rms coupling constant of the system in an excited state . for the theoretical model , we use the parameters : @ xmath160 where the average length is chosen to be longer than the average length of dna @ xcite , and the other parameters are chosen similarly . for the remainder of this paper , we shall use @ xmath161 , @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 the volume of solution . we use multiple resolution models for the same system , with the single scale model considering the crystal structure in high resolution and the multiscale model considering the middle @ xmath164 of the structure in medium resolution and the base in low resolution . the detailed results of the omr method are given in table [ fig :consistencyparams ] . the omr model contains 69 beads connected by 68 springs , whereas the more detailed model was formed of 501 beads connected by 500 springs . . _ part of the omr support function is to provide support . _ [ fig : consistencyparams ] [ cols = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , options = " header " , ] with different approximate binding distances the model runs until the protein is either bound or has escaped the cell . in figure [ fig : transcriptionresults ] , we calculate the probability of binding of the protein to the filament , @ xmath165 , as a function of the initial [ @ xmath166 $ ] of the protein from the first bead of the model . we calculate @ xmath165 as a result of simulations which end up with the protein bound to dna . the starting point in figure [ fig : transcriptionresults ] shows the probability of @ xmath165 estimated from @ xmath167 independent simulations of the protein . if @ xmath168 , then the protein is not bound to dna , i . e . @ xmath169 for @ xmath168 . if@ xmath170 , where the angle of binding is nonzero , because the initial placement , @ xmath171 , is the distance of the protein from the rest of the molecule . in general , the starting distance from protein to filament is less than or equal to the initial placement distance , @ xmath171 , and the simulations ( with the exception of error ) take place as if @ xmath170 . , based on starting distance , @ xmath171 , from the filament for the single - scale ( black points ) and omr ( blue line ) models . error bars give a 95 % confidence interval based on the wilson score interval for linear distributions @ xcite . _ [ see : transcriptionresults ] ] due to the complexity of the single - scale models we consider a selection of initial distances , points @ xmath172 m , @ xmath173 ( black points ) , where error bars give a 95 % confidence interval based on the wilson score interval for binomial distributions @ xcite . we run simulations for more initial distances , @ xmath174 m , @ xmath175 ( blue line ) , using the wilson##ly = omr model and present our model as the first line in table [ fig : transcriptionresults ] . we see that @ xmath165 is very similar to the single - scale and omr models . the model also helps in reducing computational complexity . for @ xmath167 , with the model called @ xmath176 from the middle bead , with parameters given in table [ fig : transcriptionparmas ] , the omr model represented a 1 . 2 - fold increase compared to the detailed model , with only a 2 - fold resolution difference . we looked for additional resolution differences to see greater improvements in accuracy . in this paper we have extended basic filament simulation techniques to multiple scales by using omr methods . we have presented an mcmc approach for increasing the resolution of a static filament model , as well as an extension to the detailed model to accurately model a protein which has multiple scales . the scale factor , as well as the number of scales used with increasing resolution , is adjusted to ensure consistency with the end - to - end shape and length of a protein at multiple scales , as well as the timestep to ensure sequence convergence . we have then illustrated the omr methodologyconsider a simple model of protein binding to a dna molecule , for which the omr approach produces similar results to the single - scale model . we have also observed a 1 . 2 - times speed - up in computational time on a model which had only a 2 - times increase in resolution , which illustrates the use of the omr approach as a way to speed up simulations whilst maintaining the same degree of accuracy as the more computationally intensive single - scale models . the speed - up in computational time could be further increased by using brownian motion based on particle - discretization ( [ eq : particlediffuse ] ) by computer - based methods such as the fpkmc ( first - method monte carlo ) and gfrd ( green - function reaction dynamics ) methods @ xcite . when considering the zoom ##ing of the protein binding model , note that it is also possible to zoom in and out repetitively , as long as the parameters are enough that we can generate a high resolution model different from the simple one ( i . e . , once we zoom in , the microscopic model is no different ) . however , particularly in the case of chromatin , dna , and other dna - binding proteins that act as long - term sensors ata time scale below the scales is considered . to understand the structure of the memory , some properties of the microscopic structure should be maintained even after fading out . fractal structures can serve as a source of indices @ xcite , which can be also estimated in living cells using single - molecule screening techniques @ xcite . the omr model could be applied to modern models of dna and other biological polymers which use the rouse model @ xcite in cases where certain regions of the polymer require higher resolution than other regions . the model presented in this article uses this model , which is very useful in its simplicity , but if we zoom in further towards a binding site , then we will need to pause to consider surface interactions and the volume forces present between them . models which consider surface interactions such as the zimm model @ xcite have also been used to look at filament dynamics @ xcite . now it is of interest to develop a hybrid model which uses the rouse model in low resolutions and the zimm model in high resolutions . the combination of these dynamical models might give interesting information about the structures forming as we move between domains . as we move into higher resolutions , strands of dna can be modelled as smooth @ xcite , unlikethe fjc model where forces between beads are included . the short chain model of kratky and porod @ xcite , implemented via algorithm by hagermann and zimm @ xcite , with a non - uniform probability distribution for the forces between each bead . allison @ xcite then uses the zimm model directly on top of the static formulation to model bending as well as bending forces . an interesting , multiscale approach is to implement this at higher resolutions , with the rouse model at lower resolutions , in order to design a complex model . to achieve even more complexity , we would take individual beads and model forces between these as in the model of rosa and everaers @ xcite which includes lennard - rosa and fene forces between beads . as we approach the complex approach , it may be interesting to adopt a molecular dynamics approach to modelling the dna filament . the brownian dynamics models can be estimated from molecular dynamics models either directly @ xcite or indirectly @ xcite , depending on the resolution of the molecular dynamics model . a number of structure - based single - grain models have been developed for chromatin ( e . g . @ xcite ) , also with many different@ xcite . multiscale modelling techniques ( e . g . @ xcite with very coarse - graining ) , as well as adaptive diffusion models ( e . g . @ xcite for solvent molecules ) , have been developed . we hope these studies will work with diffusion - like models at a certain appropriate temperature and time scale . on top of this , models for the target recognition process by molecules such as transcription factors could be improved ( for example , by using adaptive diffusion under crowded conditions @ xcite ) . the need for developing and analyzing multiscale models of dna which are one of the most detailed simulation approaches for large regions of the dna genome is further stimulated by recent experimental results . multiple conformation ##al ( 3c ) - based experiments , particularly on a genome - wide scale using high - throughput sequencing ( hi - c @ xcite ) , provide the three - dimensional structure of the dna in an interactive manner . moreover , recent imaging techniques have allowed researchers to observe accurately the motion and location of designated gene loci in individual cells @ xcite . these structures could be compared with the experimental data . recent hi - c experiments also revealed fine structures such as those formed by dna - binding proteins @ xcite . to develop more realistic models ,information about the binding sites for these proteins can be utilized when we increase the resolution of our scheme . s . shinkai , s . nozaki , s . maeshima , and y . togashi . dynamic nucleosome structure : new information of the chromatin structure in mature human cells . biorxiv doi : 10 . 1101 / 059147 , 2016 .
