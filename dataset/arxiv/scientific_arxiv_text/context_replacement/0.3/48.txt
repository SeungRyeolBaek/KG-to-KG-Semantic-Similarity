cp violation , initially observed @ xcite only in the @ xmath7 @ xmath8 system , is one feature of the standard model ( sm ) that still requires clear theoretical understanding . the ckm picture , which describes _ all _ the _ observed _ cp violation in terms of a single phase of the spin - mixing process , has been supported by the experimental observations of @ xmath9 @ xmath10 and at belle and babar @ xcite . cp violation is in fact one of the necessary ingredients for generating the largest excess of baryons over antibaryons in the sm @ xcite . the amount of cp violation _ in the # ##s is , however , too small to produce a mass outside of the observed state of @ xmath11 @ xcite . the sources of cp violation _ in _ the sm are still a challenge @ xcite . su ( susy ) is perhaps the most attractive component of the sm , since it solves , for instance , the problem of the collapse of the electroweak symmetry - breaking matrix against radiative corrections . in the new supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @ xcite has many new sources of cpviolation through additional cp - violating states , which can not be produced independently of the field effects . a large number of these phases , particularly those of sparticles of the first and to a lesser extent of the second generation , are also constrained by properties of the electric magnetic moments ( edms ) of the electron , proton , neutron as well as @ xmath12hg and @ xmath13tl . however , these constraints are model - dependent . it has been demonstrated @ xcite that differences among phase variables cause certain properties of these phases to be neglected in a general mssm . furthermore , if the sfermions of the first two generations are sufficiently large , above the 1 tev range , the edm constraints on the states of the higgsino ##id ##s @ xmath14 , in general up to @ xmath15 , are larger ; the sfermions of the second generation will also be large . non - interacting states of @ xmath16 and / or the trilinear spin couplings @ xmath17 can induce spontaneous cp violation in the higgs sector via local ##ization @ xcite . since these phases generate edms independently of the first two generations of sfermions, the edms are determined by the charge distribution of the very large higgses @ xcite . for a detailed discussion of the edms see @ xcite and references therein . the above two phases can also have a significant influence on the higgs decay rates of the nuclear fusion reactions at the tevatron and the lhc @ xcite . mssm cp violation can also affect the higgs theory of physics quite significantly . all this makes the mssm with cp - violating phases a very interesting phenomenon . it has also been the subject of many recent studies , on the implications of these phases on neutralino / chargino production and decay @ xcite , on the third generation of sfermions @ xcite , as well as the neutral @ xcite and charged @ xcite higgs products . both cp - even and cp - odd ( cp - odd ) observables , which can provide information about these phases , have been studied . it is interesting to note that cp - even observables such as energies , branching rates , cross sections , etc . , often require more sophisticated probes thanks to the larger magnitude of the particles . for further evidence of cp violation , see , cp - odd /gravitational - wave observables already present e . g . in @ xcite have to be excluded . the recent study of the @ xmath18 sector in @ xcite shows that it will be possible to calculate the real and imaginary parts of @ xmath19 to a precision of 100 % from a comparison of the mssm lagrange parameters to masses , cross sections and branching ratios at a single @ xmath20 linear accelerator ( lc ) . this requires that both the @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 mass eigenstates can be measured in the lc and the branching ratios measured with high precision . in the @ xmath23 and @ xcite the precision of @ xmath24 is high , around 1020 % for small @ xmath25 and about 37 % for large @ xmath25 . in this way , we show that the longitudinal distribution of particles results in sfermion decays , i . e . @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 with @ xmath28 a third , ( s ) proton and ( r ) lepton , can also be used as a source of cp phases . the fermion decay .give complementary information to the decay branching ratios and may in particular be useful if the branching ratios can not be measured with high enough precision or if the decay product varies . the average number of particles involved in sfermion decays carries information on the @ xmath29 @ xmath30 mixing as well as on the gaugino higgsino mixing @ xcite . the polarizations that can be measured are those of top and bottom ; this can be determined from the decay lepton distributions . it is the decay energy that causes the @ xmath31 to decay before hadronization and so the decay products also carry information on its mixing . for this , also the energy distribution of the decay products can be used . the polarization of the decay products has been used for studies of mssm parameter ##ization for the cp - violating case in @ xcite . for the cp - violating case , the time dependence of the longitudinal decay polarization has been mentioned in @ xcite . we extend these results by discussing in detail the dependence of the fermion polarization to cp - violating phases in the mssm . the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we summarizeour notation for the description of the sfermion , neutralino and chargino systems is the mssm with cp violation . in section 3 , we describe the polarization in sfermion decay to neutralinos , @ xmath32 with @ xmath33 . we describe the amplitude of the decay as a function of the mssm , and on the sensitivity to cp - violation effects in the sfermion and neutralino systems . in section 4 we present the energy distribution for @ xmath34 matrices . in section 5 we summarize the results and use our notation . for intergenerational experiments , the sfermion mass distribution can be represented as a set of @ xmath35 matrices , each of which represents sfermions of a different flavour : @ xmath36 with @ xmath37 { m _ { \ sf _ { r } } } ^ 2 & = & a ^ f _ { \ , r } + e _ f \ , m _ f ^ 2 \ , \ \ ti \ , \ sin ^ 2 \ t _ 1 + m _ f ^ 2 , \ \ [ - - ] m _ f & = & e _ f- \ { ^ * \ , \ { \ cot \ a , \ cot \ , \ } = | f _ 0 | \ , [ ^ { { \ phsf } \ , , \ end { i : aq } \ end { i } \ ] ] for @ xmath38up , and @ xmath39 - the sfermions ; @ xmath40 , @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 are the charge , the mass and the spin components of the spin isospin of the free particle , respectively ; @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 and @ xmath45 are the susy - type parameters for the particle , and @ xmath16 is the higgsino ##id parameter ; @ xmath45 and @ xmath16 both have two components : @ xmath46 and @ xmath47 . + similar to fig . , @ xmath48 is generated by the symmetry group of @ xmath49 . the spin eigenstates @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 are closely related to their spin eigenstates @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 . @ x##math54 with @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 the sfermion mixing is and is . since the off - diagonal element of @ xmath48 is equal to @ xmath40 , this problem is mostly relevant to the diagonal element , @ xmath57 , on which we focus on the following . the mass dependence is given by @ xmath58 by definition , we take @ xmath52 to be the lighter mass eigenstate , @ xmath59 . note also that @ xmath60 . for the mixing of @ xmath55 we take @ xmath61 which places @ xmath55 in the right half of the unit square . the @ xmath62 @ xmath63 mixing is large if @ xmath64 , with @ xmath65 if @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 if @ xmath68 . finally , we note that the phase dependence of @ xmath69 and @ xmath49 is given by @ xmath70 . this mixing is small if @ xmath71 . this issue will be discussed in more detail in the following .of dimensions 3 and 4 . in the case @ xmath72 the neutralino mass matrix is : @ xmath73 the gaugino mass parameter @ xmath74 and the higgsino mass parameter @ xmath16 can in general only be used . the phase of @ xmath75 can be taken away , which leaves us with two elements in this sector : @ xmath76 , the phase of @ xmath77 , and @ xmath78 , the phase of @ xmath16 . + the solution of eq . is given by the following mixing matrix @ xmath79 : @ xmath80 where @ xmath81 , @ xmath82 , are the ( non - zero ) masses of the two neutralino particles . we choose the ordering @ xmath83 . a detailed discussion of the neutralino model with two elements can be found in @ xcite . the chargino mixing matrix is : @ xmath84 which is divided into the two mixing matrices @ xmath85 and @ xmath86 , @ xmath87 where @ xmath88 are the masses ofthe corresponding chargino is with @ xmath89 . the sfermion coupling with neutralinos is ( @ xmath91 ; @ xmath82 ) @ xmath92 where @ xmath93 the @ xmath94 and @ xmath95 interactions are @ xmath96 for ads and sbottoms , and @ xmath97 for staus , with the corresponding coupling @ xmath98 and ... @ xmath99 the gaugino interaction changes the helicity of the sfermion while the higgsino interaction changes it . in the case @ xmath100 , the total mass of the particles resulting from the @ xmath101 interaction can now be written as @ xcite @ xmath102 . . . , and as well as @ xmath103 , we have , for the @ xmath104 decay ( taking the initial value @ xmath105 and using the sfermion and neutralino interactions for calculations ) : @ xmath106 \ , . \ , { 1 } \ ]] we see that the phase dependence of @ xmath107 is the same for the sfermion sector ( @ xmath108 ) and if the neutralino has both the gaugino and higgsino components . it is , however , smaller if the total of @ xmath98 is zero . furthermore , @ xmath107 is subject to cp ##t even if just one component , in either the neutralino or the sfermion sector , is non - zero . in particular , if only @ xmath45 and if only the sfermion - sector has a non - zero component , the phase - dependent term is @ xmath109 if , on the other hand , only @ xmath76 is non - zero we get @ xmath110 \ , \ cp ##e \ , \ , . \ ] ] the polarization @ xmath111 , eq . , depends only on phase and not on masses . for the numerical solution we therefore take @ xmath77 , @ xmath75 , @ xmath16 , @ xmath112 , @ xmath55 and @ xmath113 as inputfinally , allow @ xmath114 to satisfy edm constraints more precisely : assuming that for the 1 - loop contributions and the cp - violating higgs mass parameter @ xmath115 gev , 1 - loop and 2 - loop contributions to the electron edm ( eedm ) , as well as their sum , are within the upper bound . we use the formulae of @ xcite for the 1 - loop contributions . in order not to use too many parameters , we use , again , the equivalence relation @ xmath116 and choose @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 ( large and very large mixing ) from this equation . the free parameters for our analysis are : @ xmath75 , @ xmath119 , and the parameters @ xmath76 , @ xmath113 . as we review the analysis results , a correction is taking place : cp violation in the neutralino model is dominated by the mixing of @ xmath77 and @ xmath16 , while @ xmath113 originates from relative mixing of @ xmath45 and @ xmath16 . for sb the mixing is dominated by @ xmath19 , while for x##ottoms and staus , is dominated by @ xmath120 ; quite often we use @ xmath121 unless @ xmath122 , and @ xmath123 unless @ xmath124 . more precisely , @ xmath125 for @ xmath126 , and @ xmath113 can be identified with the special case of @ xmath127 , independent of @ xmath128 . for @ xmath129 , however , @ xmath113 is dominated by @ xmath128 . for the special case of @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 , @ xmath132 . in the general case this is not a problem since @ xmath133 can in general be easily identified . for sbottoms and staus , choosing @ xmath134 freely leads , however , to a choice @ xmath135 , which can in some cases cause problems with pattern - and colour - space minima .

[ fig : ptau _ m2mu ] and [ fig : ptop _ m2mu ] that the effects of cp - violating particles may not be visible at @ xmath144 and / or @ xmath140 , provided @ xmath16 is not too large . we next use the case of @ xmath75 and @ xmath119 to show the phase combinations in more detail . this shows @ xmath140 as a multiple of @ xmath76 , for @ xmath148 gev , @ xmath149 gev and @ .##math150 , @ xmath151 , @ xmath152 and @ xmath153 . since for example @ xmath75 and @ xmath119 the @ xmath142 value varies with @ xmath76 , we write the a of the @ xmath140 as a function of @ xmath154 for fixed values of @ xmath76 , with @ xmath149 gev and @ xmath75 adjusted such that @ xmath155 gev . @ xmath140 varies over a wide range depending on @ xmath76 and @ xmath154 ; if the neutralino phase parameters , @ xmath25 and @ xmath156 are known , @ xmath140 can also be used as a precision probe of these parameters ( although additional calculations will be needed to correct ambiguities and to distinguish the various parameters ) . in a lc , the values of the neutralino / chargino sector and also sfermion angles and mixing angles can be calculated very precisely , using tunable beam geometry and beam geometry @ xcite . the exact precision is of courseconsider the following example . to see the effect of uncertainties on the knowledge of the physical parameters , we take the values of @ xmath148 gev , @ xmath149 gev and vanishing points as reference points and assume that the following precisions can be obtained : @ xmath157 , @ xmath158 , @ xmath159 , and @ xmath160 . measuring the precision within this range of the reference points leads to @ xmath161 and @ xmath150 , which is taken as an important factor in calculation . ( the 50 % uncertainty in the precision of @ xmath162 is usually zero ) . we assume that in our particular scenario , if a particle has been observed in the neutralino / chargino sector , a measurement of @ xmath140 would be converted to @ xmath163 . if @ xmath25 can be converted to @ xmath164 , this leads to @ xmath165 and @ xmath166 . according to , a measurement of the non - negative @ xmath167 puts a lower precision to @ xmath168 ; in our scenario where@ xmath131 , @ xmath169 gev ( @ tev ) for @ xmath170 ( @ xmath171 ) . increasing the sensitivity of @ xmath172 , @ xmath172 and @ xmath173 from 0 . 1 % to 0 . 5 % barely exceeds these limits .

it will therefore be zero for @ xmath239 , @ xmath240 and for @ xmath112 . therefore , there is a non - zero decay even if there is only one decay in either the sbottom or chargino sector . note , however , that the total cp violation in the chargino sector is@ xmath128 , which then gives the sfermion density matrices . thus @ xmath85 and @ xmath86 also imply @ xmath241 . more generally , @ xmath242 for , and not @ xmath112 , and thus @ xmath243 unless @ xmath244 ; see below . and the other articles . for the sake of a general understanding of the spin dependence of @ xmath237 ( and since @ xmath245 is not a free particle ) , we will use @ xmath199 and @ xmath246 as independent decay parameters . thus the spin spin state in @ xmath247 decays as a function of @ xmath119 for @ xmath248 gev , @ xmath249 and above , and other values of @ xmath199 and @ xmath246 . here we have the @ xmath250 , since from renormalization - group calculations one has @ xmath251 . as in the previous section , we expect similar yields from cp - violating calculations if the @ xmath252 has a spinhiggsino ##id ; as such , these results are enhanced for the @ xmath25 . the results are the same if both @ xmath199 and @ xmath246 change their signs . moreover , @ xmath253 . if @ xmath199 and @ xmath246 have the same sign , the difference in @ xmath237 from the measurement of one sign is greater than if they had different signs . in particular , we find @ xmath254 in certain regions of the phase space . with an assumed value of the spin polarization of about 10 % this means that in most cases @ xmath255 can not be distinguished from @ xmath256 by measurement of @ xmath237 . however , the value of @ xmath237 is very sensitive to the running @ xmath257 critical mass , which enters the bottom - right of eq . and is sensitive to the different susy loop sizes . for the lines where we have used @ xmath258 gev the following lines show the value of @ xmath237 when @ xmath259 is varied between 2 . 5 and 3 . 5 ge##v . as can be seen , the purpose in @ xmath259 rather than in @ xmath260 is to find out small values of cp - type parameters , specially in the case of large @ xmath25 .

for @ xmath261 gev and @ xmath262 gev , and show the phase values of these points respectively . this shows @ xmath237 as the value of @ xmath246 , for @ xmath261 gev ,@ xmath249 , @ xmath263 , and the value of @ xmath128 . @ xmath75 is chosen so that @ xmath264 gev ( i . e . @ xmath174 gev for @ xmath131 ) . the value obtained by setting @ xmath259 to 0 . 54 . 5 gev is defined as the values for two of the parameters , for @ xmath131 and @ xmath265 . we see the effect of the incomplete ##ness of the other parameters in the same way as in the previous section . for @ xmath266 gev , @ xmath267 gev , @ xmath268 , @ xmath269 and @ xmath270 , we have @ xmath271 and @ xmath272 . then in addition @ xmath2734 . 5 gev at @ xmath274 . with a 50 % rounding error for @ xmath237 in quadrature , we end up with @ xmath275 ( @ xmath276 ) without ( with ) the @ xmath259 ge. these are known as two bars of a . we see that the sensitivity of @ xmath277 can not be distinguished from @ xmath278 in this scenario . however , @ xmath237 turns out to be quite a different probe of @ xmath279 , i . e . the probe from the ` natural ' of @ xmath277 . in the case of a , @ xmath280 @ xmath281 can be solved if @ xmath260 is ( not ) known yet , quite independently of @ xmath199 . solving for the @ xmath282 , puts a bound on @ xmath283 of @ xmath284 @ xmath285 gev . if the error on @ xmath75 and @ xmath119 is 0 . 5 % and @ xmath164 , we get @ xmath286 and @ xmath272 , so that the accuracy is unaffected by the measurement uncertainty . however , the resulting improvement in the accuracy is limited to @ xmath287 and @ xmath288 gev . . . @ xmath237 is the probe of@ xmath246 , for @ xmath262 gev , @ xmath289 gev , and the same parameters as above ( @ xmath174 gev and @ xmath131 ) . the effect of the error on @ xmath260 is then shown as black bands for @ xmath131 and @ xmath265 . assuming the parametric error in the same way as above , but with @ xmath290 gev , we find @ xmath291 at @ xmath272 . then the result @ xmath2734 . 5 gev at @ xmath292 . assuming a 50 % squared error on @ xmath237 in a , we end up with @ xmath293 ( @ xmath294 ) without ( with ) the effect of @ xmath259 , shown as black bands in b . in the two - dimensional case , @ xmath237 is a box - like shape in the @ xmath128 @ xmath246 plane , with points of constant @ xmath237 being ellipses in this plane .if @ xmath199 is not known , a measurement of @ xmath237 can therefore be used to put limits on @ xmath128 and @ xmath246 , but not on @ xmath282 , which includes @ xmath283 . in our previous study , we had assumed that @ xmath295 is known . in this case , a measurement of @ xmath296 , for example , would restrict @ xmath297 at @ xmath298 , while a measurement of @ xmath299 would restrict @ xmath300 as well as @ xmath301 . the measurement would also put a limit on @ xmath282 . as mentioned above , a lower limit on @ xmath282 implies a lower limit on @ xmath283 . an upper limit on @ xmath302 may be used to set an upper limit on @ xmath283 as a function of @ xmath303 : @ xmath304 . note , however , that this becomes unbounded for @ xmath305 . we have also investigated the properties of the @ x##math25 ( @ xmath306 ) . it has a @ xmath246 dependence similar to that of tau , with almost no dependence on @ xmath199 and the @ xmath307 dependence is more pronounced . we encounter , however , a large experimental error , which almost brings out the sensitivity to @ xmath302 . + _ to sum ##mation , _ tau ##s in @ xmath219 decays depends very little on @ xmath199 . @ xmath220 is probably not a useful quantity to study cp phases , but may be useful for ( consistency ) analysis of the gaugino higgsino mixing . # ##ons in @ xmath218 decay , on the other hand , can be used to study @ xmath199 , @ xmath246 and / or @ xmath308 in some regions of the phase space . the interpretation of @ xmath237 , treating phases as being periodic with vanishing phases , may also affect @ xmath283 . we have compared the effect of cp - violating phases on the tau polarization of sfermion particles to neutralinosor charginos , @ xmath309 and @ xmath310 ( @ xmath206 ; @ xmath82 ; @ xmath311 ) . this combination is considered as a key parameter for the mssm - determination @ xcite . when looking into charginos , the dependence depends on the value of @ xmath16 . since this dependence is strong in the case of @ xmath219 , @ xmath220 does not make a promising case of cp violation ( on the other hand , exactly this feature can make @ xmath220 useful for consistency testing of gaugino higgsino theory ) . if @ xmath312 however , the dependence on @ xmath199 can be very strong ; in fact , only the size of the sbottom - mixing effect plays a role . if @ xmath313 , @ xmath314 . we see that this case can be used to differ from the cp - violation case when considering @ xmath315 . if , however , a deviation from @ xmath316 is observed , these phases can be separated and the dependence on @ xmat##h245 can be derived . the phases @ xmath317 and @ xmath318 provide a more direct probe of cp violation because an additional phase , the phase of @ xmath77 , exists . we found that cp symmetry can have a significant effect on the top and bottom sectors , especially if the corresponding neutralino has a large higgsino component . if the parameters of the neutralino sector can be determined directly , e . g . in @ xmath20 annihilation with electron spin , @ xmath319 and @ xmath320 can be used for the determination of cp symmetry . in addition , since @ xmath192 unless @ xmath119 is sufficiently large , the measurement of @ xmath144 can give information about @ xmath19 . in this section it is important to note that ( for fixed masses ) the sfermion sector cross sections do not depend on cp symmetry . in the sfermion sector , these can be expressed as branching ratios as discussed in @ xcite , properties of the involved fermions as discussed in this section , and cp - spin coupling . branching ratios are in general rather difficultto analyze with high precision . the information that can be obtained from these ratios is especially useful if one decay mode dominates , e . g . @ xmath136 in case of a light stau . this makes the behavior of the decay fermions a very useful way to study cp phases . last but not least we note that the computations in this sector , down to effects of a few particles , have been performed at tree level . the number of radiative effects @ xcite will be of comparable size and will therefore have to be taken into account for precision analyses . the study of the cp phases in the sfermion / @ xmath321 sector will also involve cp studies of the higgs particle @ xcite , since in the mssm higgs - sector cp violation is generated by the corrections @ xcite . last but not least we emphazise that , since the decay can be measured , the effects of cp violation should be taken into account for precision susy ##m analysis , especially in a general way , as described in @ xcite . r . g . acknowledges the strong support of the institut fr hochenergiephysik in vienna and the cern physics laboratory . r . g . wishesto thank the cern physics laboratory and lapth for hospitality and financial support , where this work was done . thank the centre for high energy physics , uk for hospitality and financial support . one is to thank the partial support of the department of science and technology , india , under the scheme sp / s2 / 01 - 01 / 2000 - 01 . the # ##es used in the above section are : @ xmath322 a . a . bennett , pisma zh . teor . fiz . * 5 * ( 1967 ) 32 , jetp lett . b , 24 ( 1967 ) . for a full summary , see a . a . dolgov , astro - ph / 0211260 . g . l . kane _ et al . _ , astrophys . j . suppl . * 148 * , 1 ( 2003 ) [ astro - ph / 0302207 ] . for a summary , see e . g . l . kane and a . kusenko , rev . phys . * 148 * , 1 ( 2004 ) [ astro - ph / 0303065 ] . _ , e . g . j . e . kane and g . l . kane, phys . rept . * 117 * ( 1985 ) j . l . smith and r . nath , phys . d * 418 * , 480 ( 1998 ) [ he - ph / 9707409 ] ;
