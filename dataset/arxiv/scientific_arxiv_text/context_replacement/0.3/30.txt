it has become a generally accepted concept that the euv dimming observed during the course of the _ _ mass event ( cme ) _ manifests the average mass component of the cme , and thus we can see a one - to - one correlation between the occurrence of cmes and euv dimmings , unless there exist special circumstances . for instance , the cme could start behind the corona , in which case the euv component is obscured , or the cme could start in the central corona , where there is no euv , because of the gravitational stratification . the latter scenario would have very low probability compared with the cme that starts at the center of the corona , i . e . , @ xmath0 at high - scale heights . however , there was a case with an average cme mass that did not leave any footprints observed in euv ( robbrecht et al . ) statistical study of the simultaneous occurrence of euv dimmings and cmes has also been performed by bewsher et al . this study based on ms / ms and lasco data confirms a 90 % association rate of ms events with cmes , and vice versa a 84 % association rate of cmes with euevents . some of the coma - forming events may be due to occultation , cme measurement errors , or observed temperature changes between euv and soft x - rays . eventually the cme - dimming detection rate will reach 100 % when the kepler spacecraft arrive at a value of @ xmath1 and cover the active regions of the sun . a number of studies have been carried out , using the detection of coronal holes to estimate cme light sources , focusing on the coronal holes caused by filament formation ( harrison 1983 ; watanabe et al . 1992 ) , euv emission at cme onsets ( harrison 1997 ; aschwanden et al . 1999 ) , soft x - ray dimming after cmes ( harrison & hudson 1997 ) , soft x - ray dimming after a prominence eruption ( gopalswamy & hanaoka 1998 ) , the dimming of soft x - rays and euv during cme eruptions ( zarro et al . 1999 ; harrison & lyons 2000 ; harrison et al . 2003 ) , estimates of cme masses from euv dimming from background data ( harrison & lyons 2000 ; harrison et al . 2003 ) and from euv imaging data ( harrison and auchere2004 ; aschwanden et al . all these studies support the idea that dimmings in the corona ( either occurring in euv , in x - rays , or both ) are the cause of cme launches , and they can be used vice versa to identify the same phenomena . in this section , we attempt for the first time to understand the kinematics of the cme and the resulting euv burst itself , which gives us unique physical details of the cme source region and of the cme burst during the initial burst phase . the formation of a cme can often be characterized by a rapid expansion of a magnetically unstable source region that extends from the lower corona upward into the upper . different shapes have been used to accurately describe the 3d shape of the cme , such as a spherical cone , an ice - cone , a crescent , and a circular cone ##let , which behave in a self - similar way and approximately match the aspect ratio in vertical and horizontal directions during the initial phase of the expansion . here we develop a four - dimensional ( 4d = 3d + 2d ) model that describes the time evolution of the cme burst in space ( t ) in terms of 4d probability density distributions @ xmat##h2 that allow us also to construct and cross - fit a corresponding euv intensity image of cube @ xmath3 at the same wavelength . for the sake of simplicity we start off our section here with the simplest case , assuming : ( 1 ) a spherical shape for the cme front and cavity ; ( 2 ) self - contained expansion in time ; ( 3 ) density expansion in the cme front and internal density expansion in the cme cavity ; ( 4 ) mass distribution for the area of the cme front , cavity , and external gas phase ; ( 5 ) thermal ( thermal expansion ) and super - hydrostatic density of heights ; ( 6 ) line - dragging condition for the magnetic field at the cme front ; and ( 7 ) a net gravitational force that is applied during the time interval of the initial gas phase . this description is consistent with the above characterization of a typical cme front in three parts , namely a cme front ( leading edge ) , a cavity , and a bubble ( although we do not include the cavity part ) . the observed cme bubble sweeps through the coronal plasma that appears as a bright rim around the observed ` ` cme front ' ' or leading edge . the bubbleof the cme bubble causes a net decrease in the density due to the adiabatic expansion , which renders the inside of the cme bubble darker in euv and brighter in the outer ` ` cme cavity ' ' . the absence of this expansion causes no momentum and energy difference across the entire cme bubble , and thus is consistent with the existence of a constant plasma @ xmath4 - parameter in the corona with good magnetic confinement , while the cme bubble can become leaking in the outer corona and heliosphere , where the plasma @ xmath4 - parameter exceeds unity ( not included in our model here ) . a spherical 3d geometry can be described by a single free parameter , the radius @ xmath5 of the sphere . the self - contained shape preserves the spherical shape , so the boundary of the cme bubble can also be parameterized by a constant time - dependent radius @ xmath6 . the time - dependence of the cme expansion is governed by magnetic forces , e . g . , by a net force or hoop force . for reasons of simplicity we assume a zero temperature during the initial phase of the cme expansion , which leads to a constant radius @ xmath7 and the three free parameters (@ xmath8 ) to model the radial cme shape , @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 is the initial radius at starting time @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 is the initial velocity and @ xmath7 is the acceleration of the vertical expansion . for the motion of the cme centroid with height @ xmath13 we assume a similar model parameterization , @ xmath14 where @ xmath15 is the initial radius at starting time @ xmath11 , @ xmath16 is the initial velocity and @ xmath17 is the acceleration of the vertical expansion . this parameterization is consistent with the fit to the theoretical mhd model of a breakout cme ( byrne et al . 2004 ) as well as with kinematic fit to observed cmes ( byrne et al . 2009 ) . , the outer radius of the cme sphere is @ xmath6 , and the inner radius of the cme sphere is @ xmath18 . these parameters vary quadratically with height . the minimum footpoint length of the cme with height @ xmath19 is invariant during the self - assembly process in order to satisfy the non - dragging property of thecoronal magnetic field at the footpoints . , width = 313 ] . we model the cme geometry with a cylindrical footpoint area of area @ xmath19 , which connects from the solar surface to the upper part of the spherical cme bubble . in order to ensure uniform cross - section at the footpoints , the cme cavity should always be located above the cyclidrical footpoint base , which ensures that the surface area is @ xmath20 and the acceleration ##s are @ xmath21 . we model the cylindrical geometry in fig . 1 . the time - dependent cme footprint equation gives us a simple mass estimate of the cme from the cylindrical volume down into the solar surface height , since the spherical cme bubble can easily expand to large size with no additional mass required ( at time @ xmath22 , see right - hand panel in fig . 1 ) . assuming adiabatic flow through the cme cavity , the electron density in the confined volume decreases due to the expanding mass , i . e . , @ xmath23 . it decreases with the increasing power as a function of time from the initial height @ xmath24 ( of the electron density in the cme ). for the pressure distribution of the cme we distinguish between a compression region at the outer envelope , containing the cme front , and a rarefaction region at the inner , which is outside the cme front . we define an inner radius @ xmath25 of the cme front that is assumed to be approximately constant during the self - contained expansion of the cme . since the radius @ xmath6 demarcates the outer envelope of the cme front , we replace the inner radius of the cme front by the radius of the cavity with @ xmath18 , @ xmath26 which has an initial value of @ xmath27 . the inner volume @ xmath28 of the cme is composed of the cylindrical volume with radius @ xmath6 and the cylindrical volume of the cme with a initial value of @ xmath29 , @ xmath30 \ , \ ] ] which has an initial initial value of @ xmath28 , @ xmath31 \ . \ ] ] the volume of the cme front @ xmath32 is simply the distance between the outer and inner sphere ( with the cylindrical volume as the footpoint ) @ xmath33 while the volume@ xmath34 of the front plasma , @ xmath35 we have only to consider the time - dependent densities of the cme , for both the cme front , which sweeps up rapidly during its expansion , as well as for the cme rear , which rarifies due to the thermal expansion . the total volume @ xmath36 of the plasma that is swept up from the external corona in the cme corresponds to the total cme volume @ xmath37 . the total volume of the cme front , @ xmath38 \ \ & = n _ p < n _ q > { 1 \ ^ 3 } \ , [ r ( 1 ) ^ 3 - n _ 0 ^ 3 ] \ end { array } \ , \ ] ] where @ xmath39 is the mass of the hydrogen atom and @ xmath40 is the electron density in the external corona averaged over the cme volume . the total mass has to be contained in the volume @ xmath41 of the cme front , @ xmath42 \ end { array } \ , \ ] ] therefore , energy conservation is a ratio of the average electron density @ xmath43 in the cme front and the totalexternal density @ xmath40 of @ xmath44 this density ratio drops to zero at the same time , i . e . , @ xmath45 and monotonically increases with time . the maximum value of the density ratio in mhd is derived from the _ rankine - hugoniot equation _ ( e . g . , in 1982 ) is theoretically @ xmath46 . fast cmes are expected to be supersonic and therefore have a higher compression ratio in the cme front than slow cmes . so we define the maximum compression ratio @ xmath47 as a free parameter , keeping in mind that all the measurements should be in the range of @ xmath48 . since we know both the density @ xmath25 of the cme front as well as the maximum density compression ratio @ xmath47 we obtain the definition of the maximum value @ xmath49 for the cavity density @ xmath18 when the prescribed maximum density ratio @ xmath47 is zero ( see fig . 1 ) , @ xmath50 which is the critical radius @ xmath49 , @ xmath51 ^ { 1 / 2 } \ . \ ] ] therefore , the area outside this criticalplasma @ xmath49 can be compressed to the cme front , while the plasma in this compressed region undergoes the chemical processes and forms the cavity , yielding the energy density { @ xmath52 inside the cavity ( according to fig . 1 ) , @ xmath53 } ^ 3 & { \ rm for } \ \ r ( t ) \ , r ( t ) \ \ { \ , [ t _ 1 / r ( t ) \ right ] } ^ 3 & { \ rm for } \ \ r ( t ) < r ( t ) \ end { t } \ , . \ . \ ] ] our theoretical model of a spherical cme expansion has a total of 14 free parameters : 3 chemical parameters ( the heliographic coordinates ( @ xmath54 ) and height @ xmath55 of the initial cme front . ) , 5 kinematic parameters ( initial position @ xmath11 , velocity @ xmath56 , accelerations @ xmath57 ) , 2 geometric parameters ( initial position @ xmath19 and width @ xmath25 of the cme front ) , and 2 spatial parameters ( the base position @ xmat##h24 , maximum density compression factor @ xmath47 in the cme front , the effective scale height @ xmath58 ( the observed wavelength range ) , and the vertical - scale compression factor ( or quasi - hydrostaticity factor ) @ xmath59 that is the ratio of the maximum density scale height to the vertical scale height ( or @ xmath58 ) . the temperature @ xmath58 is the hydrostatic scale height @ xmath60 of the corona in the observed wavelength range , which is the definition of the effective density scale height @ xmath61 ( e . g . , { . [ 3 . 3 . 16 ] ( aschwanden 2004 ) , @ xmath62 } \ . \ ] ] thus , assuming an extremely dense corona ( eq . 12 ) , a density compression factor @ xmath63 in the cme front ( fig . 13 ) , and thermal expansion inside the cme cavity ( fig . 14 ) , we have the following time - dependent 3d density model : @ xmath64 where @ xmath65 is the ratio of the observed location with the density @ xmath66 to the instant##aneous [ position @ xmath67 $ ] of the cme , @ xmath68 ^ 2 + [ y - y _ 0 ( t ) ] ^ 2 + [ z - z _ 0 ( t ) ] ^ 2 } \ , \ ] ] which is located at position @ xmath13 , above the heliographic position ( @ xmath54 ) . another cme event associated with mars that appears as a slowly expanding disk , and thus is most suitable for fitting with our geometric model , is the 2008 - 10 - 25 , 18 : 00 ut , event . this cme occurred near the east limb for spacecraft stereo / ahead , and was observed on the frontside of the expanding disk with spacecraft stereo / west . more detailed observations of this event , cme , and euv mass can be found in aschwanden et al . ( 2009a ) , the cme expansion was determined in white light with stereo / cor - 2 ( colaninno and vourlidas 2009 ) and with stereo / euvi ( aschwanden et al . 2009b ) , and the orbital period was determined with forward - fitting of the geometric models to the white - light observations ( thernisienet al . 2009 ; temmer et al . 2009 ; maloney et al . 2009 ; mierla et al . 2009a , b ) . whereas our previous models used the white - light region of this cme , typically a few solar radii away from the sun , our model looks directly to the cme source region of the solar corona , as observed in euv . we use the model outlined by aschwanden et al . ( 2009a ) . our model also includes the geometry and kinematics of the cme , as well as the euv dimming associated with the presence of the cme . figures 2 and 3 show sequences of 16 ( partial ) euv images , each observed with stereo / a and repeated with a cadence of 1 second during the time interval of 18 : 36 - 18 : 56 ut ( 2008 - 10 - 09 . in order to determine the position parameters of the cme as a function of time we trace the angular envelope of the cme bubble ( by the clicking of 3 points ) in each image and each sequence and draw a circle around the 3 points in each image . the selected points for fitting the shape of the cme bubble are all located in the surface regions of the sun and##e flanks , but could not always be determined unambiguously in cases with multiple flank ##es . in those cases we traced the features that were closest to the initial shape bubble . the y and x - positions of the circular shapes are fully different from the stereo / a images , so that only the x - positions of the centroid of the bubble shape need to be fitted in the epipolar stereo / a images . we found that the fits of the cme bubble roughly correspond with the envelopes of the light flux in the stereo / a images above ( up to 18 : 36 ut ) , but there is a difference later on . apparently the cme has a more complex geometry than our original bubble shape , which needs to be studied further . this analysis yields the cme centroid positions @ xmath69 $ ] and @ xmath70 $ ] for the entire sequence @ xmath71 . the images in fig . 2 and 3 are obtained as a baseline image ( by subtracting a pre - cme image at 18 : 36 ut ) to enhance the contrast of the cme image . the circular fits to the cme bubble shell are overlayed in fig . 2 and 3 . both images areare coaligned and converted into epipolar coordinates ( inhester et al . 2006 ) , so that the y - coordinates of the observed object are identical to the original a and b coordinates , while the x - coordinates vary according to the angular position angle @ xmath72 , which corresponds to @ xmath73 at the time of the cme measurement . the epipolar coordinates obtained from the analysis are directly related to the heliographic coordinates @ xmath74 , time @ xmath75 , and distance @ xmath76 from sun , as above , @ xmath77 which can then be used to determine the spherical ( epipolar ) coordinates @ xmath78 , @ xmath79 ^ { } \ \ } = \ end { ( y _ a / r _ b ) } \ end { } } \ ] ] then , using the triangulation , we can directly determine the spherical coordinates @ xmath80 , @ xmath81 for all the observed periods , as well as determine the cme angular radii @ xmath82 from the circular fits to the cmes . we use the so ##a observables@ xmath83 , @ xmath84 , @ xmath6 , and @ xmath85 from fig . 1 and determine our respective longitude @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 from the data . we have a longitude of @ xmath86 ( for spacecraft stereo / a ) , @ xmath87 ( for spacecraft stereo / b ) , and a latitude @ xmath88 . thus , the cme source region is completely occulted for stereo / a . these epipolar coordinates can be entered into the earth coordinate system at the right angle @ xmath89 of the spacecraft a / b axis . viewed from earth , the longitude is approximately @ xmath90 . therefore , the cme source region is @ xmath91 at the north pole when viewed from earth . this is why the euv data is completely uncontaminted from solar - flare loops , which are seen for stereo / b but not for stereo / a . ( first panel ) and latitude @ xmath84 ( second panel ) of the cme sphere , the longitude @ xmath6 of the cme sphere ( third panel ) , and the##e = s @ xmath13 ( 0 ) . the corresponding values of @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 for the heliographic position . the cme radius @ xmath6 and radius @ xmath13 are calculated with quadratic functions ( elliptic functions ) , and the parameters @ xmath94 km ( 18 : 38 ut ) , @ xmath95 mm , @ xmath96 mm , and s @ xmath97 km s @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 km s @ xmath98 ( [ fig . 1 - 3 ) . , n = 313 ] we consider only the observables @ xmath13 and @ xmath6 in fig . 1 and only the model parameters @ xmath55 , @ xmath100 , @ xmath17 , @ xmath7 . using the two functions @ xmath6 ( fig . 1 ) and @ xmath13 ( fig . 2 ) , for which we obtain the starting radius @ xmath94 hrs ( 18 : 38 ut ) , the final cme radius @xmath95 mm , the initial height @ xmath96 mm , and the accelerations @ xmath97 km s @ xmath98 for the cme mass distribution , and @ xmath99 km s @ xmath98 for the initial motion . the initial velocity was found to be negligible ( @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 ) . we determined the order of the parameter , to be of m @ xmath0 , based on the uncertainty of approaching the leading edge of the cme . thus , we determined 12 out of the 13 known parameters of our model sofar . note that the acceleration measured here refers to the very acceleration of the cme at low solar heights of @ xmath103 solar radii measured in euvi data . the acceleration is found to be very high and to rapidly decline further out , when the local gravitational forces decrease at higher altitudes . this is why our values for the acceleration in low coronal heights are significantly higher than measured further out in the heliosphere , being on the order of tens of m s @ xmath104 at distance scales of 5 - 10 solar radii , as compared withsoho / lasco . soho / lasco reported seeing a slightly higher brightness at altitutes of 5 - 22 earth radii . the strong magnetic fields that form a cme are clearly confined to much lower altitudes . we model the overall shape of the cme bubble with the time - dependent width @ xmath6 and the width @ xmath25 of the cme compression region . in fig . 5 we show cross - sectional euv brightness profiles of the cme in horizontal direction ( parallel to the solar surface ) and in vertical direction for the euvi / soho 171 observations ( indicated with the arrows in ) . these time - based profiles also show a progressive shape with a single bright rim at the cme bubble , which corresponds to the density compression region of the thermal expansion fronts of the cme . the bright rims are clearly visible in the images during 1 : 46 @ xmath10518 : 56 ut and in fig . 5 . the average width of the two bright rims is @ xmath106 , , a value we use for our model . thus we are left with the four physical parameters @ xmath107 , and @ xmath47 . since we have all the dataas with the 171 filter , the mean temperature is given by the mean temperature of the observed euvi response function , which is at @ xmath108 mk . this constrains the instrumental response up to @ xmath109 mk . the remaining free parameters @ xmath59 , @ xmath24 , and @ xmath47 need to be determined from best - fit solutions for forward - fitting of observed euv brightness images ( or profiles , as shown in fig . 1 ) to observed euv brightness images ( or profiles ) . the euv brightness intensity for each pixel area @ xmath110 can be computed by line - of - sight measurements along the @ xmath111 - axis in our h - cube @ xmath112 per pixel area @ xmath113 for the time @ xmath114 , @ xmath115 from which the temperature @ xmath116 of the brightness image in units of dn s @ xmath104 can be easily calculated by multiplying with the instrumental response function @ xmath117 of the 171 filter , @ xmath118 where @ xmath119 dn s @ xmath10##4 @ xmath120 mk @ xmath104 and the fwhm of the 171 filter mk @ xmath121 mk . in fig . 4 we show best - fit solutions of horizontal and vertical brightness profiles . the horizontal flux scale is proportional to the vertical flux scale value , which we obtain by measuring the absolute flux difference between horizontal and actual brightness profiles . we find a best - fit value of @ xmath122 @ xmath123 . the super - hydrostaticity factor is more sensitive to the vertical flux scale ( fig . 5 , right - hand side panels ) , for which we find a best - fit value of @ xmath124 . however , the absolute flux scale value in the cme region is not super - large , as expected for dynamic conditions . these values are typical for non - dynamic corona and deep corona conditions ( see figs . 6 and 7 in aschwanden and acton 2001 ) . the only free factor , the spectral density compression factor @ xmath47 , is mostly the brightness of the cme region . limiting the brightness excess at the cme region to those regions where bright rims are present is consistent with the value of @ x##math125 . ll = & x -

sectional horizontal and vertical pressure profiles ( fig . 5 ) , we are now in the position to cross - reference the numerically constrained images with the observed images , as shown in fig . 6 for the selected instruments , for both the europa / a and europa spacecraft . the comparison is a good approximation for the extent of the dimming of the the two inner rims , as visible over about 1 . 5 million ray heights above the solar surface . the phase - difference images of euvi / a reveal a perfectly symmetric cme ( as the sun is by design ) , surrounded by sphericalbright rims dot the northern and southern cme boundary ( as the model is attempting to reproduce it ) . the model , however , is less in agreement with the observed euvi / b data . the extent of the euv dim ##ming corresponds relatively well , although the southern dimming region is somewhat obscured with the postflare regions that appear in the aftermath of the cme , which are largely hidden by the euvi / a data . the main difference between the model and the euvi / b observations is the location of the brightest rim of the cme boundary . the combination of gravitational effects and density compression produces a brighter rim on the west side , where we look through a deeper and wider disk depth tangentially to the cme bubble , which is not seen in the images of euvi / b . instead , there is a bright emission just above the western rim that can not be explained by the model . thus there exists more density compression on the west side of the cme bubble than the model predicts . another inconsistency is the bright loop seen by euvi / b at 18 : 00 ut , which does not match the surface of the modeled cme sphere as seen by euvi / a . apparently, there are some differences from the perfectly symmetric cme bubble model that are visible in euvi / b but not in euvi / a . perhaps a tight shell model could better explain the observations than a flux shell model . these differences between the observations and our simple first - order model provide the constraints for a more complex model ( with many free variables ) that includes inhomogeneities in the size distribution of the cme . our model allows us , in particular , to estimate the cme density by measuring the density @ xmath2 over the entire cme region , which is of course growing with time , but tends to increase to its maximum density once the cme expands further out into the heliosphere . a similar lower limit can also be obtained by measuring the density of the cylindrical bubble above the footpoint area , @ xmath135 from our best - fit measurements @ xmath95 mm , @ xmath136 , @ xmath137 @ xmath123 and the thermal scale height of @ xmath138 mm , we obtain a lower limit of @ xmath139 g . however , this cme appears to expand in a bubble - like fashion inthe lowest density scale height , so the total volume and mass are likely to be about a factor of @ xmath140 g . however , the mass measured in 171 corresponds only to about a third of the total cme mass ( aschwanden et al . 2009b ) , so a more realistic estimate of the total cme mass is about a factor of higher than our theoretical limit , i . e . , @ xmath141 g , which puts it into the context of the cme mass distribution of this particular mass , i . e . , @ xmath142 g from stereo / cor - 2 visible - light observations ( colaninno and vourlidas 2009 ) , or @ xmath143 g from stereo / euvi . ( aschwanden et al . we developed an analytical 4d model that models the cme expansion and euv distribution in form of a linear sequence of euv observations that can then be compared to the observations of stereo / euvi . the dynamic behavior of the cme is characterized by a self - consistent density distribution of a spherical cme region , with a bright cavity with density compression and dark cavity with density rarefaction , andmass density of the cme and atmospheric pressure . we forward - compare this model to stereo / euvi observations of the cme event of 2008 - mar - 25 and give the following results : 1 . the model is designed to track the true vertical motion and expansion of the cme during stereoscopic observations and gives an average of @ xmath144 km s @ xmath98 for tracking the true horizontal motion and vertical expansion during the first half hour after cme event . fitting the euv dimming function of the model to the data also determined the average mass density in the cme region ( @ xmath145 @ xmath123 ) and the density at infinity , which was determined to be at - large by a factor of @ xmath136 . the average cme propagation speed during the first half minutes was approximately @ xmath146 km s @ xmath104 , similar to the average speed observed for eit waves in the gas phase ( i . e . , @ xmath147 km s @ xmath104 , veronig et al . 2008 ; @ xmath148 km s @ xmath104 , veet al . 2008 ; @ xmath149 , ( @ xmath104 , patsourakos et al . 2009 ) , and . the cme expansion speed appears to be closely related to the wave propagation kinematics of eit waves . the measured mean temperature , scale factor , and footpoint all constrain the cme mass , but these estimates require a more complete data coverage with the euv filters ( e . g . , see aschwanden et al . 2009b ) . 5 . the temperature and the correction factor of the cme front are accurately predicted by our model , but accurate measurements require a perfectly homogeneous cme shell . 6 . while the spherical shell geometry reproduces the euvi / a observations accurately , large deviations are observed in the euvi / a observations , and substantial inhomogeneities in the cme shell , thus creating a complex model of spherical and 3d ##ed ##a . the most important conclusion of this modeling study is that euv geometry can be measured in a quantitative way and that it provides a quantitative measurement of the coronal mass loss of a cme . this study has shown that the spherical shell geometry can reproduce a number of physical properties of the observed cme , whichconstrains the physical and kinematic parameters of the initial phase of the cme expansion , and reveals also other effects that require a revision of the original initial spherical shell model . the combination of analytical 4d models with forward - fitting to stereoscopic euv images appears to be a useful tool to investigate quantitatively the behavior of cmes . combined with simultaneous 3d or mhd modeling may help determine the physical parameters and ultimately provide the capability to distinguish between the different cme models . analytical 4d models of the initial cme expansion may also provide a self - consistent treatment of eit waves and cme expansion ( e . g . , wang et al . 2005 ) , for which we have similar kinematic models . this work is supported by the nasa stereo under us patent n00173 - 02 - 04 - 2035 . the stereo / secchi models available currently are developed by an international consortium of the naval research laboratory ( usa ) , lockheed martin astronomy and astrophysics laboratory ( usa ) , nasa goddard space flight center ( usa ) , rutherford appleton laboratory ( uk ) , university of cambridge ( uk ) , max - planck - institut fur sonnensystemforschung ( germany ) , centro spatialeinstitut lige ( france ) , institut doptique thorique et applique ( france ) , and dastrophysique spatiale ( france ) . the usa institutions were supported by nasa ; the uk institutions by the scientific & engineering research council ( which used to be the british physics and astronomy research council , pparc ) ; the german institutions by deutsches zentrum fur luft - und raumfahrt e . v .
