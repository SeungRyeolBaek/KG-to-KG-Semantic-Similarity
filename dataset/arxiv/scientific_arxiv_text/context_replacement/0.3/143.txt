in cold dark matter simulations , the relatively small distribution of galaxies in the universe is expected to evolve into a complex network of clusters and voids , structures which have been termed the ` ` cosmic web ' ' . the filamentary distribution of galaxies in the early universe has been revealed in detail by various radio galaxy field surveys such as the 2dfgrs ( colless et al . 2001 , baugh et al . 2004 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , stoughton et al . 2002 , doroshkevich et al . 2004 ) and the 2 @ xmath19 digital sky survey ( 2mass , maller et al . ) simulations successfully reproduce this model ( jenkins et al . 1998 ; colberg et al . 2004 ) and indicate that galaxies are at the tip of the spiral in this cosmic web ( katz et al . 1996 ; miralda - escud et al . hydrodynamic models suggest that in the present universe , in addition to dark matter and gas , the filaments are also composed of a mixture of cool , photoionised matter ( the low @ xmath0 remnants of the universe ) and , # ##y , low - density gas ( attemperatures between @ xmath20 k and @ xmath21 k that contain most of the baryonic gas , the ` ` red - hot ' ' galactic medium ( wang , cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al . 1999 ) . observational constraints on the physical properties , composition , and heavy metal content of gas in the low - mass cosmic background are currently very strong . the existence of the whim appears to be a robust feature of cosmological simulations ( dav et al . ) , research efforts are increasingly being invested in the search for the gas and , more generally , the gas filamentary structures predicted by the model . large - scale gas filaments have been detected by x - ray emission ( wang et al . 1997 ; scharf et al . 2000 ; tittley & henriksen 2001 ; rines et al 2001 ) . however , x - ray emission studies with current facilities predominantly reveal gas which is heavier and denser than the atmosphere ; this x - ray emitting gas is most likely to contain a significant fraction of the present - epoch gas ( dav et al . the most promising method for observing the gas is the xone is to look for ultraviolet ( o @ xmath4roman6 , o @ xmath4roman8 ) and x - ray ( o @ xmath4roman7 , ne @ xmath4roman8 , ne @ xmath4roman9 ) absorption lines corresponding to whim gas in the vicinity of the qsos / agns ( tripp et al . 2000 , 2001 ; smith et al . 2002 , 2005 ; nicastro et al . 2002 ; bergeron et al . 2002 ; richter et al . 2004 ; sembach et al . 2004 ; prochaska et al . 2004 ; danforth & shull 2005 ) . while absorption lines provide a direct and powerful measurement of the whim , the pencil - beam image of the gas in a sight line provides little information on the nature of the gas , e . g . , whether the lines occur in an active galaxy cluster / halo , a galaxy cluster , or low - density regions of a large - scale cluster or halo . however , to understand the nature of highly dense gas at high redshifts , several groups are pursuing high - redshift measurements and observations of qsos behind well - known galaxy clusters orclusters . for example , to study gas located in large - scale filaments , bregman et al . ( 2004 ) have looked for absorption lines indicative of the gas in front of the clusters / superclusters and have identified several candidates . in this paper , we carry out a combined study as part of a broader program that combines a large _ hst _ survey of high @ xmath0 o @ xmath4roman6 absorption lines known as sight lines to low @ xmath0 o ( tripp et al . 2004 ) and a ground based survey to measure the redshifts and properties of the distant galaxies to the distant qsos . the ground based survey is done in three stages : first , multi - spectral ( u , u , v , e and i ) data is obtained to identify the galaxies and to estimate their photometric properties . second , the redshifts are obtained for the galaxies that are potentially ( due to the photometric redhshifts ) at the distance that the distant object . as part of the large _ hst _ survey , we have observed the galaxy hs0624 + 6907 ( @ xmath22= 0 . 3700 ) with the e140 m echelle mode of the space telescope imaging system ( stis ) on board the _ space _ telescope _ . we have also obtained multiband imaging and galaxy redshifts of galaxies in the 0624 field . the sight line to 0624 passes through several large abell clusters ( [ see : abell _ cluster ] ) and provides an opportunity to look for gas in large - scale structures . we shall show that gas ( absorption lines ) and galaxies are detected in the redshifts of the structures observed by the abell clusters in this field . although the absorbing gas is present , and it is likely that we are probing gas in the optical filaments , the properties of these structures are different . instead of low - metallicity # ##s , we will find neutral , photoionised , and high - metallicity gas in these large - scale structures . this study is conducted as follows . the imaging and noise reduction procedures were performed in 2 , including _ hst _ / stis and _ _ ultraviolet _ spectroscopy _ ( ) observations as well as ground - based imaging and galaxy redshift measurements . in 3 ,we present information on the foreground galaxies probed by the 0624 sight line , both from the data on abell , and from our new galaxy redshift data . the sight - line imaging methods are described in 4 , and we discuss the optical properties and metallicity of the absorbers in 5 . section 6 discusses the properties of the large number of ly @ xmath16 lines observed from the stis , with emphasis on the search for broad ly @ xmath16 lines . section 7 discusses the implications of this study , and we present our findings in 8 . in this paper , we present the following observation parameters : @ xmath23 , @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . 0624 was observed with stis on 2 jan . 2002 and 23 - 24 jan . 2002 as part of a cycle 10 _ hst _ 1 survey ( id = 9184 ) . the echelle spectrograph was used with the e140 m telescope which has a resolution of 7 fwhm and covers the 1150 @ xmath261730 range with only a few small gaps between observations at wavelengths greater than 1630 . the @ xmath27 m telescope was used to observethe effect of the length of the line spread out . the total resolution time is 1 . 5 ksec . the data is reduced as reported by tripp et al . ( 2001 ) using the stis instrument system of calstis at the goddard space flight center . the average signal - to - noise ( v / h ) per resolution time is 14 at 1150 , increases again to 14 at 1340 and then decreases to 7 at 1730 . for more details on the design and operation of stis , see woodgate et al . ( 1998 ) and kimble et al . ( 1998 ) . hs0624 + 6907 was also observed by the same team on four occasions between 1999 june and 2002 december ( program ids p1071001 , p1071002 , s6011201 , and s6011202 ) . records are with three rf filters ( ` ` channels ' ' ) , two with rf filters for most of the 905 @ xmath261105 spectral range , and two with lif filters , to about 1100 @ xmath261187 ( see moos et al . 2000 , 2002 for details on design and operation ) . the spectral resolutionsrange from s @ xmath2630 to s @ xmath28 ( fwhm ) . for hs0624 + 6907 , the average integration time in the lif1 channel was 110 ksec ; the other channels had much lower integration times due to channel coalignment ##s during some of the observations . we have collected the spectra from the satellite and have analyzed the data using calfuse ##x ##1 . 0 . 0 as described in tripp et al . ( 2005 ) . because the spectra in the individual channels have different s / t ratios , we have combined and combined all available lif data to form the same spectra that we used for our observations ( we note that combining all available lif data does not increase the spectral resolution ) . for the specific areas not covered by the sic channels , we used only the sic2a data . finally , we used absorption spectra of different wavelengths ( e . g . , fe @ xmath4roman2 @ xmath291144 . 45 vs . fe @ xmath4roman2 @ xmath291608 . 45 ) indexed by _ fuse _ and stis in order to align the _ fuse _ spectrum with the stis spectrum and to determine the wavelengthand analysis of the data . one of the main goals of our low @ xmath0 qso absorption line study is to study the connections between emission and absorption lines . these studies include infrared imaging ( for galaxy target detection and focusing on the galaxies of interest ) followed by optical imaging for the redshift measurements . to begin the light - absorber study toward 0624 , we first obtained a @ xmath30 set of images centered on the qso with spicam on the amateur radio observatory ( apo ) 3 . 5 m telescope on 2002 january 5 . later , we obtained images of a larger area in better seeing with the noao 8k @ xmath318k ccd imaging camera ( mosa , muller et al . 1998 ) , on the kitt peak radio observatory ( kpno ) 4 m telescope . the spicam images were used to select targets for the first infrared survey run , but initially we only used the well - known mosa images . [ x = " < , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] 0624 was taken with mosa on the 4 m telescope 2003 january 28 - 30 . the field of view is @ xmath32 with a scale of @xmath33 / pixel . as summarized in figure [ fig : obslog ] , images were recorded of @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 with a regular dithering pattern for filling in gaps in the ccds and for detection of cosmic rays . the standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) were also recorded at regular intervals . during these intervals , the values ranged from @ xmath360 to 1 @ xmath373 . the resolution was reduced with the iraf ##d and mscred following standard procedures . the final r - band mosa image of 0624 is summarized in figures [ fig : field ] and [ fig : fieldzoom ] . the parameters for follow - up spectroscopy were determined from the images using the sextractor software . ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . images of the galaxies were recorded using the digital infrared camera ( dis ) on the apo 3 . 5 m telescope on the following dates : 2002 november 22 , 2003 january 03 @ xmath2631 , 2003 april 03 , 2003 april 07 , and 2003 december 12 . images were recorded using a single 1 . 5 m wide slit with total exposure times ranging from 360 to 1800 frames per second. the spectra were processed in the same manner , and were then calibrated for neon - neon - argon visible - light spectra . small 360 - degree changes in wavelength were recorded as well , for comparing observed light levels with their measured wavelengths . the spectra were then processed at frequencies of @ xmath38 fwhm . llccccccccc & & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & & qso & 06 : 30 : 02 . 0 & 69 : 05 : 03 . 0 & 0 . 3700 & 0 . 000 & 1 . 000 & 15 . 8 & 15 . 0 & 15 . 3 & -

20. 9 the redshift measurements were made following the procedure described by jenkins et al . we used the iraf and fxcor to cross - correlation the galaxy velocity with that of the radial velocity of hd 182572 . in general we only used the red channel velocity data for the cross - correlation , where the 4000 galactic and stellar absorption lines were not observed . red channel data were usually used to count and measure the number of redshifted absorption lines ( [ type a ] , e @ xmath39 , e @ xmath16 , etc . ) when present . the observed values obtained in this study were placed in table [ tab : spec _ red ] and then rounded to between 150 and 170 ( which corresponds to a absorption - line displacement range of 1 . 5 to 2 . 4 mpc for an observed gas flow ) . we also observed several galaxies with the echellette spectrometer and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al . 2001 ) on the 10 m keck ii telescope on the nights of 2004 - 10 and 11 during solar twilight . we observed galaxy ne3 ( see table [ tab : spec _ red ] ) in echellette mode with the 2 . 5 @xmath40 slit which provides @ xmath41 spectral resolution ( fwhm ) . the fainter se13 and sw3 galaxies were observed in low dispersion , using the same @ xmath40 slit which affords @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 . the exposures were automated , and were calibrated with the esiredux index ( prochaska et al . 2003xavier / esi / index . 1 ] ) . the ne3 redshift was calculated from the measurement of the low - energy na @ xmath4roman1 and h @ xmath16 spectral lines , and the estimated uncertainty is @ xmath4430 km s @ xmath28 . for se13 and sw3 , they were calculated by fitting na @ xmath4roman1 , ca @ xmath39 , and ca @ xmath4roman2 , and h , and the uncertainty are @ xmath44150 km s @ xmath28 . the size of our galaxy field survey ( i . e . , the number of galaxies larger than a given value in the sextractor galaxy catalog with good resolution##troscopic ( ) is also summarized in the [ see : completeness ] as a function of the @ xmath45 magnitude and its separation from the sight line ( @ xmath46 ) . in the @ xmath47 region centered at 0624 , we have measured the redshifts for all galaxies brighter than @ xmath45 = 19 . 0 , and the value of @ xmath48 per second is for @ xmath49 . as we shall see , there is a large cluster of sight lines in the 0624 region at @ xmath50 = . 0635 ; at this distance , 5 @ xmath51 corresponds to a projected distance of 367 @ xmath7 kpc , and @ xmath45 = 19 . 0 corresponds to @ xmath52 or @ xmath53 ( taking @ xmath54 from lin et al . 1996 ) . for example , the large magellanic cloud has a magnitude equal to @ xmath55 or @ xmath56 . at this redshift , we have good completeness even for low luminosity galaxies . at these distances , a large number of bright galaxies are expected, and our current survey is shallower . nevertheless , within a 10 radius circle , our survey is about 90 per cent accurate for galaxies brighter than @ xmath57 . using information obtained from the literature in combination with our current cluster survey , we can identify several large - scale structures that are pierced by the 0624 sight line . in this section we focus on these structures in both abell clusters ( [ sec : abell _ clusters ] ) as well as smaller ( and closer ) galaxy groups ( [ sec : close _ clusters ] ) . clusters are clustered and often reveal much larger scale structures , i . e . , superclusters ( einasto et al . 2001 and references therein ) . in these simulations , clusters are found at the points where large - scale structures feed . to test the fidelity of these simulations , which are now being used in a wide variety of astrophysical applications , it is necessary to search for observational evidence of the very _ large _ structures feeding into clusters and to determine the density of the filaments . the sight line to 0624 passes through a region of very high abell cluster density and is well - suited for investigation of this region .determine the density of abell clusters from the sight line to 0624 , using the cluster - count and the redshift ( when known from the literature ) . the density of abell clusters in this region is relatively high compared to the density of the other clusters in the abell region : the number of abell clusters within 3 @ xmath58 ( 3 @ xmath59 ) of a557 ( the cluster closest to the 0624 sight line ) is 2 ( 0 . 6 ) times larger than the average cluster within 2 @ xmath60 ( 2 @ xmath59 ) of other abell clusters . einasto et al . ( 2001 ) have discovered two superclusters in the region of 0624 . their supercluster scl71 ( at @ xmath61 ) includes a554 , a557 , a561 , a562 , and a565 and scl72 ( at @ xmath62 ) includes a559 and a564 . however , a557 and a561 do not have similar properties , and based on our observed results , the field of hs0624+ 6907 / abell557 ( see table [ source : spec _ red ] ) , it is possible that the visually identified a557 is a separate cluster due to the presence of galaxy groups at several different distances . to be conservative , we would need objects with similar properties to identify large - scale structures . the clusters at ( a564 and a559 ) are separated by 4 . 5 from each other , and the clusters at ( a565 , a562 and a554 ) are separated by 2 . 5 and 4 . 7 . according to colberg et al . ( 2004 ) , in absolute terms , more than 85 per cent of the clusters with a magnitude greater than 1 are associated with a cluster . we will show in subsequent sections that both absorption lines in the spectrum of 0624 and those close to the sight line are detected at the edges of some of these abell cluster members , which indicates that the filaments connect into the clusters . in this section we offer some brief comments about the galaxies and galaxy groups close to the sight line of 0624 , as determined from our optical observations . we present these comments in the context of the abellas discussed in the previous section . we plot in the spatial distribution of the galaxies from at [ 1 : big _ red ] . from this , we can identify three galaxy groups : two galaxy groups appear to be located at redshifts similar to those of the abell clusters , i . e , at @ xmath63 ( 8 galaxies ) and @ xmath64 ( 6 galaxies ) . this means that the group of galaxies from a559 to a564 must extend more than 3 degrees ( 15 ) west from a559 and structure linking a562 and a554 also extends to at least 3 degrees ( 15 ) in order to cross the qso sight line . however , the most prominent group in includes 10 galaxies at , which does not match up with any abell cluster with a similar spectroscopic signature . to determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in the three galaxy groups in the mosa cluster , provides a colour - coded map of the spatial coordinates of the clusters . we see that the group at @ xmath65 is mostly southeast of the sight line while the groups associated with abell 554 / 562 / 565 at are predominantly northwest of 0624 . the galaxies associated with theabell 559 / 564 supercluster appear to extend from the southwest of the sight line to the northeast . we note that the redshifts are not known for any of the clusters shown in fig . [ fig : abell _ map ] , including the cluster that is closest to the sight line , a557 . however , abell clusters are visually visible without the use of spectroscopy , and it can be seen from images [ fig : field ] and [ fig : field _ colour ] that several galaxy groups are located at the location of a557 . it is possible that a557 is not a single cluster but rather is the superposition of several clusters in general . is # ##eous present in these large - scale gas clusters ? to address this question , we searched the spectrum of 0624 for the absorption lines and the redshifts of galaxies and other structures near the qso sight line . the points of the h @ xmath4roman1 line that we have identified and measured ( see [ fig : absline ] ) in the spectrum of 0624 are located at the location of ; the length of the line is equal to the rest and width of the line . this search has beentwo interesting findings : first , when a star is observed at an impact point @ xmath66 from the sight plane , it is almost always found within a few hundred of the observed wavelengths ( from table [ tab : bright _ star ] to table [ tab : lyalist ] ) , consistent with the results of previous studies ( e . g . , lanzetta et al . 1995 ; tripp et al . 1998 ; impey et al . 1999 ; smith et al . 2001 ; bowen et al . 2002 ; penton et al . 2002 ) . second , strong absorption is also detected at the center of the @ xmath67 abell 564 / 559 supercluster . this binary star is located in , , and the c @ xmath4roman4 @ xmath68 1548 . 5 , 1550 . # ##3 ( [ ss : z076 ] ) , and the resulting spectrum is very close to that of a559 . strong absorption is also detected at @ xmath13 = 0 . 10822 , which is within half of the abell 554 / 562 / 565 wavelength . third , and not surprisingly , there is afound in the galaxies that feed into the clusters near 0624 . third , table [ fig : zgaldist ] , indicates that the strongest lines are found in the region of highest observed brightness , which is similar to the conclusions of bowen et al . ( 2002 ) and c ^ ot et al . ( 2005 ) . could these absorbers simply come from the halos of other galaxies ? as we saw in the previous figure , the strong h @ xmath4roman1 system at is composed of a large number of lines scattered across galaxies . these components are unprecedented in the galaxy halos . in addition , we find an obvious pattern that shows a relationship between these lines and individual galaxies in this system . in the case of this strong h @ xmath4roman1 system at , the closest observed galaxy to the red line with this system has @ xmath69 ( ne3 , table [ tab : spec _ 1 ] ) . thus , a larger and brighter galaxy could have been missed by the spectroscopic survey . using higher redshifts ( measured as described by chen et al . 2003 ) to determine the distant observed galaxies with higher redshifts @ x##math70 , we know that there are only four galaxies closer to the sight line than ne3 that could be near . these four objects are good candidates since the observations have high uncertainties . however , if we assume the redshift of these objects to be @ xmath71 , the closest object to 0624 has still a large absorption parameter @ xmath72 kpc . in the case of this @ xmath13 = 0 . 07573 , the nearest galaxy in space is nw3 at @ xmath73 kpc . it is conceivable that this gas comes from the large size of this distant object , as we know that many galaxies are located at @ xmath74 kpc at this @ xmath75 , and many other origins are possible ( e . g . , intragroup gas , tidally locked debris ) . however , the gas at @ xmath76 is at a substantial distance ( 415 ) from the nearest known object ( nw4a ) and is likely to be halo gas associated with that object . we now turn to the absorption - emission model . as shown in the previous section , see [ ref : zgaldist ] , the distributionsof galaxies and ly @ xmath16 lines in the direction of 0624 . we also calculated the number densities and orbital parameters of the ly @ xmath16 lines in the direction of 0624 using the voigt profile fitting in vpfit ( [ # 1987rfc / vpfit . com ] ) . figure [ fig : lyalist ] summarizes the h @ xmath4roman1 line widths , column density , and @ xmath77values observed in this region ( all of the data are highly correlated and consequently voigt profile fitting does not provide reliable results ; we discuss our treatment of these cases below ) . a particularly large cluster of ly @ xmath16 lines is shown as @ xmath78 ##1 . 0635 in figure [ fig : zgaldist ] . the portion of the stis spectrum of hs0624 + 6907 covering this ly @ xmath16 cluster is shown in figure [ fig : hi00635 ] . to avoid confusion with other groups , we will simply refer to this group of lines as a ` ` complex ' ' . this complex contains at least one h @ xmat##h4roman1 components spread over a wavelength range of 1000 km s @ xmath28 . we will refer to the strongest ly @ xmath16 absorption in figure [ fig : hi00635 ] at @ xmath13 = 0 . 06352 as ` ` component a ' ' . component a is described in detail by the o @ xmath4roman1 ly @ xmath16 , ly @ xmath39 , and ly @ xmath79 , as well as the si @ xmath4roman3 @ xmath291206 . 0 , si @ xmath4roman4 @ xmath681393 . 0 , 1402 . 0 , and si @ xmath4roman4 @ xmath681548 . 20 , 1550 . 50 respectively . the other components such as o @ xmath4roman1 , o @ xmath4roman2 , and si @ xmath4roman2 are not detected at the energies of component a nor at the energies of any of the other components shown in figure [ fig : hi00635 ] .the o @ xmath4roman6 line in the center of the ly @ xmath16 line , is in a region that is partially filled with galactic o @ xmath80 and o @ xmath4roman2 lines . however , most of the region is free from interference , and we find no evidence for o @ xmath4roman6 lines . we also do not find the o @ xmath4roman5 line . lccl | lccl & @ xmath81 & @ xmath82 & @ xmath83 & & @ xmath81 & @ xmath82 & @ xmath83 + @ xmath75 & ( m ) & ( ) & ( ) & @ xmath75 & ( m ) & ( ) & ( ) 0 . 017553 @ xmath84 0 . 0e -

schmidt spectroscopy and the use of the ` ` apparent electron density ' ' method ( see savage & sembach 1991 ; jenkins 1996 ) are used to determine the metal column density . these two methods are generally in good agreement for the same lines , which do not appear to be strongly affected by metal saturation . the si @ xmath4roman3 @ xmath90 line at @ xmath91 0 . 06352 is slightly correlated with the strong si @ xmath4roman##1 line c @ xmath91 0 . 05486 ( see figure [ fig : syst0063 ] ) . however , the metal lines at this point have a distinctive two - dimensional profile ( see figures [ fig : syst0063 ] and [ fig : civ064 ] ) , and the si @ xmath4roman3 profile here is in good agreement with those of the si @ xmath4roman4 and c @ xmath4roman4 lines . this indicates that ( strongly ) blended from @ xmath13 = 0 . 05486 gives an excellent approximation to the wavelength range where the si @ xmath4roman3 line occurs . we add the and c @ xmath4roman1 to @ xmath920 . 05486 respectively , assuming both of the lines are slightly shortward of the si @ xmath4roman3 line . the resulting joint profile is shown in figure [ fig : syst0063 ] . the spectral lines derived for most of the components of the @ xmath93 cluster are not well - defined . some of the components are strongly blended and are much more uncertain than the otherprofile - based error values indicate ; these are marked in table [ fig : lyalist ] . component a was very difficult to determine for a specific region : the three main lyman absorption lines ( ly @ xmath16 , ly @ xmath39 and ly @ xmath79 ) are not saturated , and the voigt profile method did not yield good results for the determination of the component a h @ xmath4roman1 column densities . as shown in table [ fig : cog ] , using a single - molecule model of growth and the observed column density of ly @ xmath94 , and @ xmath79 , we find that the component a h @ xmath4roman1 absorption line can be reproduced by two different sets of values for the h @ xmath4roman1 column density and the doppler shift . one of the two sets implies n ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) @ xmath95 , which should produce a lyman absorption line effect of the lyman absorption region ( lls ) at an observed wavelength of 970 . this spectral region is dominated by the spectrum of the sic2a region and is thein figure [ fig : lls _ rutr ] . the s / n of the sic2a spectrum is small but is adequate to be @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) . the optical depth @ xmath97 of the lyman limit absorption and the corresponding @ xmath4roman1 spectral density is approximately equal to @ xmath98 where @ xmath99 ) is the absorption cross section and @ xmath29 is the free - space wavelength . the sic2a spectrum does not show any compelling evidence of a lyman limit edge at the continuum limit , but the continuum limit is somewhat high and because of this , a high lyman limit absorption could be expected . based on the optical depth of the flux decrement of @ xmath100 = 970 , we have a @ xmath101 lyman limit of @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) @ xmath102 @ xmath103 ( upper black ##body curve in figure [ fig : lls _ rutr ] ) . we also show in figure [ fig : lls _ rutr ] the lyman limit absorption expected for@ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) = @ xmath104 @ xmath103 ( lower black value ) , which is very strong with our adopted scale placement . the lack of a lower lyman limit edge rules out the high - @ xmath4roman1 column density of 10 @ xmath105 @ xmath103 derived from the curve of growth shown in figure [ fig : c ] . the value @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) derived from the curve of growth ( h @ xmath106 @ xmath103 ) is consistent with the lack of a lyman limit edge . to be conservative , we go to the metallicities predicted both from the lyman value [ @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) @ xmath107 and from the expected lower black value from the curve of growth shown in figure [ fig : c ] . we next consider the physical properties and optical properties of the optical systems predicted from the column density and the doppler parameters derived from voigt curve fitting . we concentrate on the absorbers [ @ xmath##13 = 0 . 06352 and 0 . 0757 because these systems exhibit high density and can be confused with nearby objects / systems as described in [ 13 : 1 ] . to derive information from the detected metals in these systems ( h @ xmath4roman3 , b @ xmath4roman4 , and c @ xmath4roman4 ) , we must apply ionisation corrections , which depend on the transport coefficients and physical properties of the gas . we will assume that the gas is predominantly photoionised , and that the observed metallicities are very low . to calculate the observed ionisation corrections and metallicities , we used cloudy photoionisation models ( v96 , ferland et al . 1998 ) as published in tripp et al . ( 2003 ) . in these models , the systems are approximated by low density , plane - shaped gas columns with a thickness that matches the predicted h @ xmath4roman1 column thickness . the gas in the columns is photoionised by the uv radiation from sources h @ xmath108 . we used the uv background intensity as computed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) with the intensity normalized to @ x##math109 . ] ] . this model is consistent with theoretical and observational data ( shull et al . 1999 ; weymann et al . 2001 ; dav & tripp 2001 , and references therein ) . with the models used to predict the h @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) , the predicted metal column sizes depend primarily on the atomic parameters @ xmath110 ( @ xmath111 . , ##s / y hydrogen ion density ) , the overall metallicity , = [ ( @ xmath96 ( x ) / @ xmath96 ( y ) ) - log ( s / y ) @ xmath112 . ] and the observed relative abundance of the elements . we assume these relative abundances , and we use the revisions proposed by allende prieto et al . ( 2001 , 2002 ) and holweger ( 2001 ) for hydrogen , helium , and oxygen , respectively . the high - energy ion ##izations predicted by the photoionisation models depend on the observed uv background shape . in this model , we primarily use the uv background shape proposed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) , and we assumethat other models of the uv background ( e . g . , madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ; shull et al . 1999 ) have a much different euv - curve for uv , which is the observed spectral profile for a given metallicity and # ##s . we understand how these uv background models affect our results by comparing our results with other uv background models ( see below ) . @ s @ r @ & @ r @ & @ xmath114 & & @ xmath81 & & + + & ( ) & @ xmath115 & ( * ) & @ xmath116 & @ xmath117h + & 1215 . 670 & 1 . 704 & 603 @ xmath84 + & 2 . 1 @ xmath118 & @ xmath119 + & 1025 . 722 & 1 . 909 & 349 @ xmath8421 & & @ xmath119 + & 972 . 537 & 1 . 450 & 302 @ xmath8422 & & @ xmath119 + & + & 1302 . 168 & 1 . 804 & &@ xmath84 9 & & @ xmath120 + o vi & 1037 . 617 & 1 . 836 & & @ xmath8417 & & @ xmath121 + si ii & 1334 . 532 & 1 . 232 & 104 @ xmath84 10 & & @ xmath122 + o vi & 1548 . 204 & 1 . 470 & 143 @ xmath84 11 & 13 . 02 @ xmath123 & 13 . 07 @ xmath840 . 03 + & 1550 . 781 & 1 . 169 & & @ xmath8410 & & 13 . 02 @ xmath840 . 05 + si ii & 1260 . 422 & 1 . 104 & & @ xmath8412 & & @ xmath124 + si ii & 1206 . 000 & 1 . 304 & 151 @ xmath8410 & 13 . 02 @ xmath125 & 13 . 08 @ xmath840 . 03 + si ii & 1393 . 760 & 1 . 855 & & @ xmath8410 & 13 . 05 @ xmath126 &12 . 05 @ xmath840 . 06 + & 1402 . 773 & 2 . 554 & & @ xmath8411 & & 12 . 05 @ xmath840 . 10 + n + & 1242 . 804 & 1 . 988 & & @ xmath8410 & & @ xmath127 as mentioned above , the h @ xmath4roman1 absorption lines produced by @ xmath128 are distributed over a wide frequency range of @ xmath129 ( see figure [ 1 : hi00635 ] ) . from the velocity centroids of the carefully selected voigt lines and , using the biweight method as described by beers et al . ( 1990 ) , we find that the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of this h @ xmath4roman1 absorption line is @ xmath130 . the velocity dispersion of galaxies near this value is similar to this , but much more distant ( due to the large uncertainties in the galaxy clusters ) . this velocity distribution is similar to those observed in metal - rich galaxy clusters ( e . g . zabludoff &mulchaey 1998 ) , which is interesting because spiral - rich groups often show diffuse x - ray emission ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ) indicative of hot gas in the intragroup region . however , we will show here [ see : below ] that the available information suggests that this group is primarily composed of late - type s and s0 galaxies . spiral - rich groups are much cooler in x - rays but could still contain hot intragroup gas if the gas is much cooler ( @ xmath131 k ) and at a much lower temperature than that found in elliptical - rich groups ( mulchaey 2000 ) . however , we note that most of the gas in the complex at @ xmath132 is unlikely to be hot , collisionally unstable , for two reasons : first , the observed @ xmath4roman1 lines in the gas are far too narrow . if the line width is caused by orbital motions , then the doppler parameter is directly related to the molecular mass , @ xmath133 , where @ xmath134 is the mass , @ xmath135 is the molecular mass density , and the numerical value is for @ xmath83 insee s @ xmath28 and @ xmath136 in particular . since other factors such as turbulence and nuclear collisions can contribute to the gas temperature , @ xmath77values provide only small limits on the temperature . applying this equation to the h @ xmath77values from the [ tab : lyalist ] , we find that some of the h @ xmath4roman1 lines in the @ xmath137 complex indicate that @ xmath8 k , which is colder than expected for the # ##d group based on observed group velocity measurements , is for spiral - rich groups ( e . g . , mulchaey et al . 1996 ) . in a complex cluster of lines , it is easy to find a single specific type of hot gas ( see , e . g . , figure 2 in tripp & smith 2000 ) , because the metal lines do not preclude the presence of hot gas , but they do indicate that many cool components are present in the surrounding medium . thus , the metal line lines in component a indicate cold , photoionised gas . if component a metal lines were to be in gas ##eous collisional thermal equilibrium ( cie ) ,the @ xmath96 ( si @ xmath4roman4 ) / @ xmath96 ( si @ xmath4roman4 ) and @ xmath96 ( si @ xmath4roman4 ) / @ xmath96 ( si @ xmath4roman3 ) set of measurements ( integrated on both components seen in these images , see figure [ tab : cldnlist0064 ] ) would yield the standard temperature @ xmath138 km ( smith & dopita 1993 ) . however the c @ xmath4roman4 resolution of @ xmath139 km s @ xmath28 is very poor . to show this , figure [ tab : civ064 ] provides an alternative representation of the standard @ xmath4roman4 resolution . we see that the @ xmath139 km s @ xmath28 is easily resolved to the stis e140 ##8 resolution of @ xmath140 km s @ xmath28 . voigt - fitting for this resolution also yields @ xmath141 , which is much smaller than the @ xmath77valuefollowed by the cie component , i . e . , @ xmath142 km s @ xmath28 . the cloudy component at @ xmath143 km s @ xmath28 is smaller ( see figure [ fig : civ064 ] ) , but the @ xmath96 ( c @ xmath4roman4 ) / @ xmath96 ( c @ xmath4roman4 ) and @ xmath96 ( c @ xmath4roman4 ) / @ xmath96 ( si @ xmath4roman3 ) values are similar for the measured c @ xmath144 and 0 km s @ xmath28 , and we expect the binding energies and physical properties to be similar for both components . third , cloudy models photoionised against the uv radiation from qsos are also consistent with the measured c @ xmath4roman3 , c @ xmath4roman4 , and si @ xmath4roman4 ion densities ( and upper bounds for these values ) at @ xmath13 = 0 . 06352 . figure [ fig : cloudym ] shows thethe metal column densities predicted by cloudy models ( small symbols associated with metal lines ) with log @ xmath96 ( log @ xmath4roman1 ) = 15 . 5 and [ m / h ] = @ xmath145 correspond to the observed column densities ( large symbols ) . we can assume that the metal column densities are in equilibrium ( in the 1 @ xmath146 value range ) with this model with log @ xmath147 ( log @ xmath148 ) . the component h @ xmath4roman1 and c @ xmath4roman4 components of this model could only arise in shock - heated gas if they arise in gas that is not in ionisation equilibrium . several papers have described the case of gas that is initially shock - heated to a high temperature and then cooled more rapidly than it can handle ( e . g . , shapiro & moore 1976 ; shapiro & moore 1986 ) . however , if component a metal lines were to arise in gas in such a state , according to both models from shapiro & moore ( 1996 ) and schmutzler & tscharnuter ( 1992 ) , the @ xmath##96 ( o @ xmath4roman3 ) / @ xmath96 ( o @ xmath4roman4 ) column density ratio would require a gas temperature similar ( @ xmath138 k ) to the one found for the collisional non equilibrium model . moreover , for higher abundances , the predicted 10 @ xmath4roman6 column density at this temperature is always higher than our theoretical upper bound ( @ xmath445 times higher in the schmutzler model ) . therefore , the @ xmath96 ( o @ xmath4roman4 ) / @ xmath96 ( o @ xmath4roman4 ) column density ratio requires an even higher temperature than 10 @ xmath149 k ( 1 . 5 times higherr in the shapiro model ) . because of these results , this non - equilibrium cooling temperature model is unlikely to apply to the @ xmath113 and toward 0624 . the cloudy modeling has provided other interesting results in addition to the general conclusion that the gas is photoionised . for example , the photoionisation model indicates that the gas has a very high metallicity of @ xmath15##0 even though we have found no luminous galaxy within @ xmath151 . a similarly low metallicity ( [ o / h ] @ xmath152 ) was also reported by jenkins et al . ( 2005 ) for a lls in the spectrum of phl1811 , but that system is much closer in distance to the host galaxy . if we adopt the more conservative lower limit of @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) from the value of the lyman - alpha ( @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) @ xmath153 , see figure [ fig : lls _ rutr ] ) value of the speed - of - light h @ xmath4roman1 column , we obtain [ o / h ] @ xmath154 . this lower limit is also substantially lower than metallicities commonly observed in infrared absorbers at higher redshifts ( e . g . , schaye et al . 2003 ) and is comparable to abundances observed in low - mass stars in the milky way ( e . g . , sembach et al . 2001 , 2004 ; smith , shull , & giroux 2003 ; trippet al . 2003 ; ganguly et al . 2005 ; smith et al . 2005 ) . to determine confidence limits for parameters extracted from our experimental data , for combinations of metallicity @ xmath155 and magnetic flux @ xmath110 we calculated the @ xmath156 statistic , @ xmath157 where @ xmath96 is zero , and the sum is over the three parameters si @ xmath4roman3 , si @ xmath4roman4 , and log @ xmath4roman4 . with the si @ xmath156 obtained at [ m / h ] = @ xmath145 and si @ xmath158 , we obtained these limits by finding values that were @ xmath159 ##6 the values required for a given confidence level ( see lampton , margon , & bowyer 1976 ; press et al . 1992 ) . in this case , we obtained [ m / h ] = @ xmath160 at the 2 @ xmath146 confidence level . of course , these confidence limits do not fully address other sources of measurement uncertainty such as changes in the shape of the magnetic field , and theof the observed data translated into cloudy . when we use the steeper - background model ( e . g . madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ; shull et al . 1999 ) , the observations are more consistent with the cloudy data for a higher metallicity of [ m / h ] = @ xmath161 and a lower density of log @ xmath162 . we can also set limits on physical properties such as the particle size ( the size of the particle in the absorbing medium ) and the effective gas pressure ( but see the caveats mentioned in paper of tripp et al . figure [ fig : absorbersize ] gives the level values for the particle size @ xmath163 and the pressure @ xmath164 predicted by the photoionisation model . the best estimate is that @ xmath165 2 . 5 kpc . if correct , the baryonic density of this cloud would be @ xmath166 . however , we can see from figure [ fig : absorbersize ] that the model requires a large correction for @ xmath163 to the maximum @ xmath146 level . the high thermal pressure value is also notable . when thesteeper the halo curve is predicted for the cloudy model , the gas pressure is increased by a factor 1 . 5 and the particle size increases to @ xmath1678 kpc . the range of pressures in the halo in figure [ sec : absorbersize ] is several orders of magnitude lower than the gas pressure measured in the halo of the milky way ( see jenkins & tripp 2001 ) and also much lower than that measured in hvcs in the milky way halo ( e . g . wakker , oosterloo , & putman 2002 ; smith et al . . ) , sembach et al . ( 1995 , 1999 ) found higher pressure for civ hvcs in the milky - way with somewhat higher metallicity . moreover , pressures this high are predicted in many other models of the halo ( wolfire et al . ) , the predicted pressure depends on the method used to measure the light flux field ( see tripp et al . 2005 ) and both the particle size and the pressure could be higher if the light source is brighter than we expected . as discussed in [ sec : infrared ] , the absorption lines measured at @ xmath13 = 0 . 07573 occur in the non -scale is similar to a559 and a564 . the h @ xmath4roman1 ly @ xmath16 , ly @ xmath39 and the c @ xmath4roman4 @ xmath681548 . 20 , 1550 . 20 lines are also detected at this time ; the results of these three lines are shown in figure [ fig : syst0076 ] . the weakness of ly @ xmath39 and the strength of ly @ xmath79 means that the h @ xmath4roman1 lines are not significantly affected by unresolved effects , and their density measurements are accurate . likewise , analysis of the h @ xmath4roman4 and the c lines showed no evidence of unresolved saturation . we have fitted these lines with only one sample . the results of the fit are shown in figure [ fig : cldnlist076 ] . the strength of the h @ xmath4roman1 line ( @ xmath169 ) indicates a temperature for the gas lower than @ xmath170 ##9 , which again indicates the photoionisation process . no h @ x##math4roman6 is evident at this redshift , but several other spectral lines of these elements are found close to the expected range of the c @ xmath4roman6 spectrum , and these lines can mask weak c @ xmath4roman6 absorption . despite the fact that c @ xmath4roman4 is the only known element in this region , we can still place an even lower limit on the observed metallicity . the carbon abundance can be calculated as [ c / h ] = log [ / ] + log [ / ] - log ( c / h ) @ xmath171 , where and are the ion ##izations of h @ xmath4roman1 and o @ xmath4roman4 , respectively . . the maximum is not evident in table [ fig : cloudym ] because it occurs at a lower value of @ xmath110 than the maximum [ . ] . with the c @ xmath4roman1 calculated from the ly @ xmath16 + ly @ xmath39 ratio ( table [ fig : cldnlist076 ] ) , and , assuming that the hydrogen is photoionised , the hydrogenstarting from qsos ( haardt & madau 1996 ) , we find that : [ / ] @ xmath172 , and [ @ xmath173 > - 1 . 6 $ ] fill the sky . once again , this metallicity upper bound is quite surprising given the fact that no such objects have been found in the galactic line ( the nearest galaxy is nw3 , @ xmath174 kpc , see also [ source : big _ bang ] ) . @ c @ c @ c @ c @ c @ c @ & & & & & + & & & & & & + & 1215 . 670 & 309 @ xmath8410 & 14 . 28 @ xmath840 . 04 & 24 . 06 @ xmath841 . 02 & 24 . 06 @ xmath840 . 03 + & 1025 . 722 & 108 @ xmath8421 & & & 14 . 28 @ xmath840 . 08 + o + & 1037 . 617 & & @ xmath8419 & & & @ xmath175 + & & & 1548 . 204 & & @ xmath84 + & 24 . 06 @xmath840 . 04 & 13 . 1 @ xmath841 . 04 & 13 . 2 @ xmath840 . 04 + & 1550 . 781 & & @ xmath84 9 & & & 13 . 09 @ xmath840 . 04 + si v & 1206 . 1 & 0 @ xmath8410 & & & @ xmath176 + si iii & 1393 . 760 & & @ xmath8414 & & & @ xmath124 + si iv & 1238 . 821 & & @ xmath84 10 & & & @ xmath177 ##9 [ fig : environment ] we found that the clusters a554 , a562 , and a565 suggest that the large - scale cluster / supercluster is close to 0624 . our recent field study has also found several clusters close to 0624 at the center of the abell 554 / 562 / 565 cluster ( see table [ fig : 1 ] and table [ fig : 2 _ 3 ] ) , which suggests that the large - scale cluster exists near the 0624 cluster . however , we alsoand a number of weak ly @ xmath16 lines near the center of this structure at redshifts very different from those of the galaxies and abell stars . it is possible that the ly @ xmath16 lines are weak / weak because the gas in the structure is so dense that the * @ xmath4roman1 * ##ization makes the ly @ xmath16 lines undetectable , and we also note that the source galaxies are farther from the sight line of this structure ( @ xmath179 mpc ) than from the structure at @ xmath180 and the others , so it is also possible that the sight line does not penetrate the region of the dark matter filament where the gas is deep enough to form gas and galaxies ( see discussion by bowen et al . how do the spectra of the ly @ xmath16 absorbers match , , and compare to the other ly @ xmath16 lines in the 0624 spectrum ( and in the other lines ) ? we have concluded that the lines are and are not photoionised by gas ; is this true of the spectra of the ly @ xmath16 lines in the spectrum ? inspecifically , do we have ly @ xmath16 lines that occur in these regions ? richter et al . ( 2004 , 2005 ) and sembach et al . ( 2004 ) have also identified a population of large ly @ xmath16 lines ( blas ) with @ xmath181 / km and @ xmath28 in the spectra of four low @ xmath0 qsos ( pg0953 + 415 , pg1116 + 215 , pg1259 + 593 , and h1821 + 643 ) . williger et al . ( 2005 ) similarly identified a large population of blas in the spectra of pks0405 - 123 . bowen et al . ( 2002 ) have also identified some bla candidates from their high quality data . if these lines are not produced by thermal expansion , then they represent the warm - hot regions , and therefore , they in this case would represent a large population of the baryons in the universe at the present time ( see richter et al . 2004 , 2005 ; sembach et al . 2004 ) . based on simulations , richter et al . ( 2005 ) and williger et al . ( 2005 ) show that most of the blas do notpredominantly not broadened but rather distorted due to line blends that are difficult to recognize given the s / n afforded by typical stis echelle lines . however , richter et al . ( 2005 ) conclude that approximately 50 per cent of the blas are not thermally coupled , and the resulting s / n estimates in the above table are remarkably smooth and broad and appear to entirely consistent with a single standard gaussian ( see , e . g . , figures 4 and 5 in richter et al . 2005 ) . in this paper , in addition to establishing a standard sight line , we have employed techniques that are different from ( e . g . , using different parameters ) the techniques described in the papers used for spectral analysis , object detection , and profile fitting . therefore , we have the opportunity to independently calculate the bla values reported in these papers . for the 0624 ##° line , we find that the median @ xmath77value for all ly @ xmath16 lines is @ xmath182 = 1 km s @ xmath28 , and the median @ xmath183 = s @ xmath28 . however , as stated in the [ ref : lyalist ] , one of thely @ xmath16 lines are much smaller , and the detection parameters are accordingly smaller . if we consider these uncertain - cases , we have @ xmath184 km s @ xmath28 and @ xmath185 km s @ xmath28 . these two @ xmath77values are in perfect agreement with the other high - resolution ly @ xmath16 lines . in figure [ fig : larg ] we compare our measurements of the h @ xmath4roman1 @ xmath77values and the densities from figure [ fig : lyalist ] to the measurements made by richter et al . ( 2004 ) and sembach et al . the dotted line indicates @ xmath83 vs . @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) for a single line with an optical constant = 0 . 5 . this is effectively the detection threshold ; lines that have ( @ xmath186 ) combinations to the right of this line are more likely to be detected . the dotted line in figure [ fig : larg ] indicates the minimum @ xmath77value as a function of @ xmath##96 ( ( @ xmath4roman1 ) obtained by dav & tripp ( 2001 , see their figure below ) from the hydrodynamic flow model of dav et al . this predicted lower envelope appears to be in broad agreement with the predicted lower envelope for the three sight lines shown in the figure . from figure [ fig : larg ] , we see that the ( @ xmath186 ) envelope that we have obtained from the 0624 sight line appears to be very similar to those obtained by sembach et al . ( 2004 ) and richter et al . sembach et al . and richter et al . also find more very broad ly @ xmath16 and ( @ xmath181 80 km s @ xmath28 ) than we have been able to easily detect in the 0624 data . this may be partly due to signal - to - noise . the methods employed by richter et al . and sembach et al . yield more m / s because the broad and sharp lines are difficult to detect in the 0624 data . for @ xmath187 km s @ xmath28 , the different sight lines appear to be in broad agreement . the lines at 5000km s @ xmath28 of the qso and , of the qso , lines appear in the region away from the qso , and these lines can be rather interesting ( see , e . g . , richter et al . 2002 ) , even if not indicative of a full - blown broad - line outflow . ] the 0624 spectrum can be used to search for blas between @ xmath188 and @ xmath189 . accounting for regions in which broad lines could have been caused by ir or ir lines , we obtain a temperature - corrected broad line for @ xmath190 . with 21 ly @ xmath16 ##9 in the region with @ xmath181 40 km s @ xmath28 , we can obtain @ xmath191 ( bla ) = 64 @ xmath8416 . this is somewhat lower than the values obtained by sembach et al . ( 2004 ) and richter et al . ( 2004 , 2005 ) . however , richter et al . have rejected blas that are located in gas blends on the grounds that these cases are more likely to be caused by non - thermal broadening . if we follow thesame way , we would reject 10 blas ( see table [ 1 : lyalist ] ) ; the remaining 10 blas would then be @ xmath191 ( bla ) = 0 @ xmath8410 . using figures 1 , 2 , and 6 from sembach et al . ( 2004 ) , and accounting for the three different sample parameters used in this paper , we find that our sample parameters indicates that the bla baryonic content is @ xmath192 ( bla ) = 0 . 017 @ xmath7 ( in the usual notation , i . e . , @ xmath193 ) . this sample value also substantially reduces the bla baryonic content , possibly because of the blas that come from it . if we reject blas that are rich in dark blends , this drops to @ xmath192 ( bla ) = 0 . 0036 @ xmath7 , which is equivalent to values obtained by richter et al . and sembach et al . the lines in @ xmath192 ( bla ) correspond to , e . g . , lines that are broad ##ened to lines of a light -thermal expansion mechanisms , although large and often difficult to assess ( see discussion in richter et al . ) , these detailed calculations suggest that blas may be an important population of galaxies . with future mass spectrographs , it would be valuable to obtain high - resolution spectra with much better s / n in order to better assess the baryonic composition of blas as part of the overall composition of the gases in the early universe . we need more detailed information about the abundances , boundary conditions , and the evolution of absorption systems in the direction of 0624 . what are the implications of these data for broader questions of galaxy structure and evolution ? the processes that add gas to galaxies ( e . g . accretion ) and remove gas from them ( e . g . , winds , mantle ##s ) can have profound effects on galaxy evolution , and the ` ` feedback ' ' of mass and energy from galaxies into the universe is now thought to play an important role in shaping galaxies that eventually evolve out of the igm ( voit j . m . , 2005 ) . the nature and implications of the @ xmath194 k ##pc data is a topic of particular interest currently . the abundance and absorption systems in the direction of 0624, particularly the galaxy group and ly @ xmath16 complex at @ xmath75 = , have some interesting , and sometimes surprising , results on these questions , which we still have . rosat observations of young x - ray galaxies have shown that galaxy groups that are dominated by s - type galaxies often have dense , hot background gas ( mulchaey 2000 , and references therein ) . based on the observed relationship between background gas density and velocity at @ xmath146 for x - ray bright galaxies ( @ xmath195 ) and the fact that spiral - rich groups have lower velocity values than elliptical - rich groups , mulchaey et al . ( 1996 ) have suggested that spiral - rich groups may have somewhat cooler background gas that could give rise to qso absorption lines at higher velocity ( e . g . , o @ xmath4roman6 ) . however , the galaxy group at @ xmath75 = appears to have properties that are not consistent with the elliptical - rich group associated with rosat nor with the fact that spiral - rich groups have hot - core background gas . it is unclear if the galaxy group at @ xmath75= is a metal - poor group . < [ fig : galpics ] > @ xmath45 ##8 from the mosa images of the 10 galaxies that we have observed in this group . most of the galaxies in the group show signs of disks and clusters ( both in the direct spectra and in the brightness profiles ) . we find from these observations that 4 - 5 of the 10 galaxies show signs of disk structure ( sw3 , se1 , se8 , se6 , and possibly se4 ) . however , the remaining galaxies could be late - type s0 galaxies , and therefore the early - type fraction would be comparable to those that show strong x - ray emission ( see , e . g , figure 2 , zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) . the ne3 , se13 , and se5 galaxies , which all appear to be late - type galaxies , have sizes and shapes consistent with the ` ` brown dwarf ' ' brightness - magnitude relation seen in clusters ( e . g . , bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; mcintosh et al . 2005 ) ; these galaxies are red s0s ( the other 5 galaxies have dark colours indicative of late types ) . the velocity profiles of the group at @xmath75 = , albeit smaller , is more similar to those of elliptical - rich groups than spiral - rich groups ( mulchaey et al . 1996 ; zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) . regardless of whether the group is elliptical - or spiral - rich , it is surprising that we find a large number of cool , photoionised clouds in the hotter medium ( [ ss : z064 ] ) . in the hot outer gas of an elliptical - rich group , h @ xmath4roman1 lines should be very broad and weak , but instead we find thin , diffuse lines ( see figure [ ss : hi00635 ] ) . even in the cooler gas predicted to be found in late - elliptical rich groups , the h @ xmath4roman1 lines should be strong . we could use models of hot intragroup gas , but in these models h @ xmath4roman6 is predicted to be thinner . likewise , if the hotter medium is a multiphase medium with cooler gas ( which have the h @ xmath4roman1 spectral lines ) being in a hotter medium , then we would expect to detect o @ xmath4roman6 from theor between the phases ( fox et al . 2005 ) , unless it is somehow unstable . the lack of evidence of hot gas leads us to question whether this gas is a stable , virialized gas . an alternative explanation is that our sight line passes along the long axis of a large - scale filamentary structure in the galactic background . in this case , the position of the galaxies and ly @ xmath16 clouds along the sight line could give a false impression of the group in which hot gas would be present . however , in cosmological models of large - scale galaxies , hot gas is known to be present in the present epoch , even in modest - overdensity regions ( see , e . g . , figure 2 , cen & ostriker 1999b ) , so it is interesting that we find a substantial cluster of hot gas at @ xmath12 , somewhat contrary to theoretical predictions . as noted above , our models do not predict the presence of hot gas at @ xmath12 , but we find no clear evidence of it . other sight lines show similar evidence of ly @ xmath16 clouds , e . g . , the ly @ xmath16 cloud at @xmath196 0 . 057 toward pks2155 - 304 ( shull et al . 1998 ; shull , tumlinson , & giroux 2003 ) or the ly @ xmath16 lines at @ xmath196 0 . 121 toward h1821 + 643 ( tripp et al . ) , unlike the 0624 ly @ xmath16 complex , the pks2155 - 304 and h1821 + 643 examples both show evidence of red - dwarf intragroup gas . to determine whether the models and simulations are in accord , it would be useful to include the frequency and physical properties of these ly @ xmath16 lines in our models for comparison with the others . it is also interesting that the two systems for which we have the abundance constraints ( at @ xmath75 = and ) both have very high metallicities , but both of these systems are at least 100 kpc away ( by projection ) from the nearest known galaxy . this naturally raises the question : how can gas that is so distant from another galaxy attain such a high metallicity ? the gas could have been driven out of the galaxy by a stellar wind ; some theoretical models suggest that the outflowing gasthey have a high metallicity ( mac ##farlane & ferrara 1999 ) , the difficulty with this interpretation is that winds from nearby galaxies are usually observed to carry large amounts of hot gas ( e . g . , li et al . 2004 ) , which appears to be consistent with the emission line properties that we just described . a more likely explanation is that the high - metallicity gas we have observed in them has been tidally stripped out of one of the nearby galaxies . there are indications that tidal stripping could be a relatively gentle process for removing gas from galaxies , and a tidally stripped origin can therefore more easily explain the current low - mass state of the galaxy . for example , in the direction of ngc3783 , the galactic high - density debris ( hvc ) ( @ xmath197 247 is now thought to be tidally stripped away from the smc . while this tidally stripped debris shows a wide range of low - ion absorption lines , it has little or no known high - ion absorption ( lu et al . 1994 ; sembach et al . ) , the tidally - stripped hvc contains molecular hydrogen , which sembach et al . argue formed in the smc and escaped the rigors of tidal stripping ( asprior to forming in situ ( the ocean ) . both the presence of heavy ions and the survival of h @ xmath80 indicate that the stripping process did not substantially ionise and destroy this hvc . these galaxies are close enough to the 0624 sight line to be possible sources of the gas in a tidal stripping process . one of the nearby galaxies , se1 , has a distorted gas core . this galaxy is a possible source of tidally generated gas . we have made a number of sight - line observations in the direction of 0624 using a combination of high - resolution uv spectra obtained with _ hst _ / stis and the ground - based imaging and spectroscopy of galaxies at @ xmath4430 of the sight line . in addition to presented the above measurements and other data , we have reported the following observations : \ } . there are five abell galaxy clusters in the foreground of 0624 , including two clusters at @ xmath12 0 . 077 ( a559 and a564 ) and three at @ xmath12 0 . 110 ( a554 , a562 , and a565 ) . these clusters trace large - scale dark matter sources , i . e . , superclusters ( fi##laments of the ` ` cosmic gas ' ' . our galaxy cluster survey has revealed gas at these supercluster clusters in the immediate vicinity of the 0624 spectral line , and so our qso spectra provide an opportunity to study the gas in large - scale gas filaments . the most powerful group of galaxies found in our galaxy redshift survey is at @ xmath12 and is not associated with the abell cluster with a strong record from the past . however , a557 , for which a similar redshift has been reported , is at least partly associated to the galaxy cluster at @ xmath12 . the two strongest ly @ xmath16 absorption systems at @ xmath198 are in galaxy clusters at @ xmath199 and . the ly @ xmath16 absorption at is particularly dramatic : at this distance , we find 13 ly @ xmath16 lines spread over a velocity range of 300 km s @ xmath28 with a line - of - sight velocity range of 265 km s @ xmath28 . the second - strongest group observed is associated with the abell 559 / .##4 large - scale gas , and this suggests that a mixture of gas and dust feeds into the abell 559 / 564 supercluster . analysis of the ly @ xmath16 radio - emission complex c @ xmath200 provides compelling evidence that the gas is photoionised and not heated ; we find very strong traces of red - hot gas in this large - scale filament . we find si @ xmath4roman3 , b @ xmath4roman4 , and c @ xmath4roman4 as the strongest component in this ly @ xmath16 complex , and photoionisation measurements show that the gas metallicity is high , [ m / h ] = @ xmath201 . this is not surprising because we do not find any luminous galaxies close to the galactic line ; the nearest galaxy is at the projected c @ xmath202 kpc . the ly @ xmath16 system itself is not included in the c @ xmath4roman4 complex , but instead we find a surprising result : the lower limit of the metallicity is very high ( [ c / h ] @ xmath14 ) and the upper limitis at @ xmath203 kpc . we have compared the values of ly @ xmath16 doppler shift and h @ xmath4roman1 column parameters to high - resolution data obtained from the space telescope , and we find some results . we find that the abundance of broad ly @ xmath16 absorbers with @ xmath181 / / s @ xmath28 per unit mass is in agreement with results recently reported by richter et al . ( 2004 , 2005 ) and sembach et al . the baryonic nature of these broad h @ xmath4roman1 lines is still highly uncertain and requires comparison with the s / n data , but it is clear that some of these broad lines exist in warm - hot gas and contain an important part of the gas in the nearby galaxies . we also find that the lower bound h @ xmath83 vs . @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) is in agreement with predictions from these models . the presence of warm - hot gas in the broad h / ly @ xmath16 complex with @ xmath200 is difficult to confirm withx - ray observations of several galaxy groups . it is very likely that this in this case we are observing a large - scale cosmic web galaxy on its long axis . the filament is a mix of early - and late - type stars and some cool , photoionised gas . the low - metallicity , cool cloud l @ xmath13 = 0 . 06352 is probably tidally stripped material . this material can explain the low metallicity and the presence of hot gas . one of the observed galaxies has a spiral structure consistent with this origin . other examples of ly @ xmath16 galaxies have been found in other galaxy lines , and additional examples are likely to be found as we continue to collect stis data . we look forward to comparisons of these observations to data from cosmological models and other theoretical work in order to better understand the processes that govern the formation of galaxies and the intergalactic medium . we contact dan mcintosh and neal katz for useful information . the stis observations of hs0624 + 6907 were obtained for _ hst _ program 9184 with financial support through the grant hst go -
