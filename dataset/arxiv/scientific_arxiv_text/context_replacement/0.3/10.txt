one surprising result that has come out of the more than 200 extrasolar planet observations to date is the wide range of eccentricities observed . in our own solar system , most of the extrasolar planets which are not tidally locked to their host stars have moderate eccentricities ( @ xmath1 ) , and 15 % have high eccentricities ( @ xmath0 ) . these observations have suggested several theories as to the origin of the observed extrasolar planets . one such method , planet - planet scattering , occurs when two jovian planets approach several astronomical units ( au ) from the host star and then interact , with one in an eccentric orbit and one orbiting the other @ xcite . this mechanism has been used to explain the formation of the @ xmath2 and planetary system @ xcite , which contains a hot jupiter as well as two hot planets in moderately eccentric orbits . @ xcite suggested a second mechanism in which two protoplanets orbit each other and merge to form a single massive , hot planet with @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 au . interactions with stellar companions are another possible mechanism to explain a planet with eccentricity . of the nine stars hosting a planet with @ xmath0 , six are currently knownto include stellar - mass companions in the ##centric orbits : hd 3651 @ xcite , hd 20782 @ xcite , hd 80606 , hd 89744 @ xcite , 16 cyg b , and hd 222582 @ xcite . if the inclination difference between the planetary companion and the stellar companion is large , the kozai mechanism @ xcite can induce large - scale variations in the eccentricity of the planet ( e . g . malmberg et al . these oscillations can be explained by the tidal effects and gravitational interactions with other planets , and hence are most common in systems with a single planet ( an ##i @ xmath51 ) from the central star @ xcite . the kozai mechanism has been used to explain the high inclination of 16 cyg bb @ xcite and hd 80606b @ xcite . @ xcite makes the orbit of 16 cyg b around the planet likely to be between 100 and 90 degrees , where 90 degrees is the edge - on inclination . however , it is the difference in inclination between the orbital planes of the planetary and stellar companions that is critical in determining the importance of the kozai mechanism , and the inclination of the planetthe orbit is also not known for non - hot planets . of the 192 known planetary systems , 17 ( 25 % ) are multi - planet systems . recent observations of additional systems in space known to contain at least one planet @ xcite suggest that multiple - planet systems are common . of particular interest are systems which contain a hot planet and a low - mass ` ` hot neptune , ' ' e . g . @ cnc ( = hd 75732 ) , gj 876 , @ xmath6 arae ( = hd 160691 ) , gl 777a ( = hd 190360 ) . motivated by the discoveries of hot planets in other planetary systems , we have undertaken an intensive survey of known single - planet systems to search for possible low - mass companions . three of the planetary systems discussed in this section ( hd 3651 , hd 80606 , hd 89744 ) are part of this campaign . the excellent radial - velocity resolution of the high resolution spectrograph on the planck - eberly telescope ( wise ) , combined with queue - time , allow us to time the survey in such a way as to minimize any changes in the orbit of the new planet , and also to act quickly on any new planet .. the use of the het in this manner is discussed further in @ xcite with respect to the discovery of hd 37605b . in this section , we attempt to combine observational data for the planets in these planetary systems with dynamical data obtained by n - body simulations . the simulations address the question : what additional planets are ( or are not ) in these systems ? the dynamical data can answer the question : where are additional planets present ? section 2 describes the observations and the test particle simulations for six highly likely planetary systems : hd 3651 , hd 37605 , hd 45350 , hd 80606 , hd 89744 , and 1 cyg b . we have selected these systems based on two criteria : ( 1 ) each hosts a planet with @ xmath0 , and ( 2 ) each has been observed with the planet search program at mcdonald observatory . section 3 , we review and discuss the results of the various particle simulations , numerical models , and upper limit computations . five of the six stars considered in this section have been observed with the mcdonald observatory no . 5 - hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) and the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) @ xcite . a full description of the het planet searchprogram is given in @ xcite . for the cyg program , observations from mcdonald observatory were obtained together with the 2 . 7 m harlan j . smith ( hjs ) telescope ; the long - term planet fitting data on this telescope is described in @ xcite . all available published data on these systems are combined with our data from mcdonald observatory for the planet fitting program . to determine constraints on the stability of planetary systems , we would like to know where these planets will remain in their orbits in the absence of the target planet ( s ) . we performed test particle simulations at swifthal / comet . html . ] @ xcite to test the dynamical possibility of additional low - mass planets in some of the planetary systems described here . low - mass planets can be treated as test particles since the exchange of angular momentum with other planets is possible . we tested the rapid non - variable symplectic integrator ( rmvs3 ) version of swift for its ability to detect close approaches of massless , non - interacting test particles and planets . planets are tested if they are ( 1 ) closer than the hill radius to the star , ( 2 ) closer than 0 . 05 au to the star , and ( 3 ) farther than 1 au from the star . since theone of these goals is to determine the time in which additional planets could remain in circular orbits , we set this goal boundary because the current generation of radial - velocity data can only detect planets at low speeds . the test particle systems were set up using the methods described in @ xcite , with the exception that only initially circular orbits are considered in this work . for each planetary system , test particles were placed in approximately circular orbits once every 0 . 002 days in the region between 0 . 05 - 2 . 0 au . we have chosen to focus on this study because the duration of our high - resolution study ##e is probably only 3 - 5 years for the planets in this study . the test particles were combined with the known planets , which had the effect of limiting the simulation to three planets . the physical parameters for the known planet in the system were obtained from our keplerian orbit fits shown in fig . 1 , and from the literature for 16 cyg ##1 @ xcite and hd 45350 @ xcite . the planetary parameters were chosen to be their minimum values ( for @ xmath7 ) . the parameters were integrated for @ xmath8 time , for @ xcite and the completion of the computations in a short time . wenote that almost all of the test - shot collisions occurred within the interval @ xmath9 yr ; after this time , the planets had been stabilized to their original configurations . we calculated the keplerian orbital parameters for hd 3651b , hd 37605b , hd 80606b , and hd 89744b in table 1 . a summary of the data used in our analysis is given in table 2 , and the het radial measurements are given in tables 3 - 5 . the velocity uncertainties calculated for the het data represent internal variations only , and do not include any external sources of error such as the ` ` rotation . ' ' the parameters for the first two planets , hd 45350b and 16 cyg b , are calculated from @ xcite and @ xcite , respectively . radial velocity measurements from the het are given for hd 45350 in @ xcite , and velocities for 16 cyg b from the hjs telescope are given in @ xcite . as with @ xcite , all the published data were combined with those from mcdonald , and the third planet in each system was measured with a keplerian orbit using gaussfit @ xcite , allowing the angular offset between the data setto be a free parameter . analysis of the fit to our keplerian model ruled out any evidence for other objects in any of the six systems in this study . the low - mass ( 1 sin @ xmath10 ) planet hd 3651b was discovered by @ xcite using observations from lick and keck . we fit these observations , which were reported in @ xcite , in conjunction with observations from the hjs and observations from mcdonald observatory . the combined observations , which consists of multiple exposures per day , are weighted by the mean - the weighted rms value of the velocities of each visit . the standard error of the mean is added in quadrature to the weighted rms about the radial velocity to generate the error value of the data point ( r = 0 ) . the rms about the combined fit for each dataset is : lick & keck6 . 6 , het9 . 4 , hjs12 . 2 . the fitted orbital parameters for hd 3651b are of similar quality to those reported in @ xcite , and agree with 2 @ xmath11 . the recent discovery of a brown dwarf companion to hd 3651 @ xcite is an interesting exercise : does the radial - velocity error apply to this companion ?and all the data after removing the correction ? we have a correction of @ xmath12 yr @ xmath13 , indicating that we are indeed able to discern a trend which is possibly related to the outer companion . however , the value @ xmath14 of the fit solution is not significantly affected by the presence of a linear trend ( @ xmath15 = 0 . 18 ) . the results given in table 1 were derived from the fit which did not include the correction . we present 23 different het ##es for hd 37605 , since its discovery by @ xcite . the observations now span a total of 1065 days . the best fit is obtained by using an acceleration of @ xmath16 yr @ xmath13 , indicating a close orbiting companion . such a finding would lend support to the hypothesis that very large minor - planet objects originate by orbiting in a close binary system . the orbital period that this outer companion could have and would remain consistent with the orbital acceleration and radial direction over the timespan of the observation is about 10 yr , assuming a circular orbit . this system would also have a minimum mass in the brown dwarf region . the planet orbiting hd 80606 , also discovered by @ xcite , is themost eccentric extrasolar planets known , with @ xmath17 ( table 1 ) . we then used the coralie data in conjunction with the keck data contained in @ xcite and 23 data from het . the extreme velocity variations induced by this planet greatly increased the sensitivity of orbit fits to the weighting of the parameters . since the values of the het data given in tables 3 - 6 were rounding errors only , we started with tables 3 - 6 of high - velocity ` ` x ' ' and quadrature before fitting the data for hd 80606 . for all of these new values , the measured values remained the same despite their differences . table 1 shows the values resulting from a study which matched 3 . 5 of the @ xcite to the het data . the rms about the combined data was : coralie18 . 7 , het7 . 5 , keck5 . 6 . @ xcite noted that the parameters @ xmath18 and the parameters of periastron @ xmath19 had to be completely fixed in their fit to the keck data set . however , the large number of measurements used in this study allowed gaussfit to converge with all parameters present . for hd 89744##b , we combine data from the het with the observations from the hjs ##9 and lick data from @ xcite . the combined data is binned in the same way as for hd 3651 , resulting in n = 33 sample visits . the rms of the best fit for each dataset is : lick17 . 1 , het10 . 1 , hjs9 . 1 . as with hd 3651b , our combined results match with those of @ xcite within the @ xmath11 . the uncertainty in our fit is slight , most likely due to the star s ##7 spectral type ( f7v ) , which hinders precision radial - velocity measurements due to the smaller number of spectral lines . for example , the f7v star hd 221287 was recently found to host a planet @ xcite ; despite the high instrumental precision of the harps spectrograph , that orbital period has a residual rms of 0 . 5 . the results of the two simulations are shown in figures 1 - 2 . the arrival time of the test planets is plotted against their initial semimajor axis . as shown in figure 1 , the short - period planets hd 3651 and hd 37605 will clean the region distance of about 1 . 5 au . theboth of these systems , however , a small number of test particles remained in low - eccentricity orbits around the dwarf planet s apastron 1 , near the 1 : 2 mean - motion ratio ( mmr ) . in the hd 3651 system , particles were stable beyond about 0 . 6 au , which is not surprising given the low mass of the system . for hd 37605 , two broad strips of stability are shown in fig . 1 , corresponding to the 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 mmrs . the mass of the test particles in the region of the 1 : 2 mmr was between 0 . 00 and 0 . 06 . particles in 1 : 3 mmr were in orbits with a larger mass , up to @ xmath20 , which is expected due to tidal forcing . as with hd 3651 , the region beyond about 0 . 8 au was largely dominated by the planet . figure 2 shows the stability for the hd 45350 and hd 80606 systems . the short period ( 963 . 5 days ) and relatively large mass ( 1 sin @ xmath21 = 1 . 8 ) of hd 45350b restricted their orbits to the nearest 0 . 6 au . these test particlesand in stability up to @ xmath22 . the first satellite orbiting hd 80606 sent its test particles to a distance of about 1 . 5 au , and only beyond 0 . 75 au would test particles remain in their orbits for the duration of the mission ( @ xmath8 ##3 ) . a degree of instability is evident from 1 . 5 au up to the 8 : 1 mmr . figure 2 shows that hd 89744b contained all test particles except for a neutral region near the 4 : 1 resonance . for the 16 cyg b system , only particles south of about 0 . 3 au were stable , leaving open the possibility of short - lived planets . the surviving particles oscillated in eccentricity up to @ xmath23 , but these simulations treat the planet as a fixed point , and the local damping of the eccentricity is not included . our results are consistent with those of @ xcite , who investigated dynamical stability in extrasolar planetary systems and found that no test particles remained in the neutral regions of the hd 80606 , hd 89744 , and 16 cyg b systems . three of these planets ( hd 3651 , hd 80606 , hd 89744 ) .monitored intensely with the het as part of a systematic effort to search for low - mass , short period planets . no evidence was found for any such objects in these or any of the six simulations in this work . we then determine what limits could be set for these planets using the high - precision het data we have collected . the method for calculating these limits is identical to the one described in @ xcite , except that in this work , the best - known keplerian orbit for the target system ( see 3 . 2 ) was removed before performing the limits calculations . in this work , we determined the radial - velocity amplitude @ xmath24 for which 99 % of planets would have been detected without the het . the eccentricity of the remaining test signals was determined to match the predicted orbits of the surviving particles from the simulations described in 3 . 2 . only the regions in which test signals survived were considered in these limits calculations . the results of these computations were highly varied , reflecting the differing detection strategies employed for these individual planets . in particular , hd 3651 , hd 80606 , and hd 89744 were monitored intensely with the het as part of a search for long - period planets , whereas hd 37605 and hd 45350 were monitoredobserved independently , the known planet masses were measured and confirmed @ xcite , and 16 cyg a has since been observed with the hjs instrument at a rate of at least once per year . the known planets are shown in figures 4 - 6 ; planets with masses below the normal line can be ruled out by the instrument with 99 % accuracy . somewhat surprisingly , the detection limits were obtained for hd 3651 ( figure 4 ) , which yielded a total of 195 planets , including 10 @ # ##es . for periods less than about one year , we can detect planets with m sin @ xmath21 2 neptune masses . similar results were obtained for 16 cyg b ( n = 161 ) , where the limits are a jupiter mass ( figure 6 ) . since the detection times will increase with the acquisition of more data and with better - quality observations , we can choose a quantity to measure the goodness of the results . a good choice would be @ xmath25 , where @ xmath26 is the mean number of observations , and @ xmath27 is the mean value of the radial - velocity component . the values of @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 are shown in table 2 . in the hd 45350 system , the resultsof the above results are those of the detection limit determination . very good results are obtained for elliptical orbits ( @ xmath280 . 2 au ) . in this region , test particles were stable ( fig . 5 ) and our observations can exclude planets with a sin _ _ _ between about 1 and 3 neptune masses . good results are obtained for the 16 cyg b region , in which test particles were stable as of @ xmath29 0 . 5 au . in that region , planets of 1 - 3 neptune masses can be excluded by our limit determination ( fig . 6 ) . in most of the limit determinations , there are significant ` ` blind spots ' ' evident where the periodogram has failed to significantly recover the injected signals . typically this occurs at certain orbital periods for which the phase resolution of the measurement instrument was inadequate , and often at the 6 - month and 1 - year limits . for orbits of hd 37605 ( fig . 4 ) , hd 80606 ( fig . 5 ) , or hd 89744 ( fig . 6 ) could additional companions be ruled out to be 0 . 5 , and for the orbital periods tested , the limits are much lower . one possible explanation for this problem is that the detection ofthe data was poorly followed in phase for most of the injected test data , making significant determination of the periodogram ##s ' . this is demonstrated by the ` ` s ' ' shape of the plots . however , the rms error for those three systems is too large to allow tight limits determination . this is only true for the f7 and hd 89744 . the three systems with the best limits ( hd 3651 , hd 45350 , and 16 cyg ##2 ) also had the lowest rms uncertainty about their orbital solutions ( mean = @ xmath30 ; table 1 ) . in comparison , the mean rms for the other three systems was @ xmath31 . additional factors such as the paucity of data ( hd 37605 ) and short time baselines ( hd 80606 , hd 89744 ) make the determination of the tight limits difficult for most of the planetary systems in this study . we have found that for a sample of six highly distant extrasolar planetary systems , there is no evidence for additional planets . the data observations show that there are regions detectable by current surveys ( i . e . for @ xmath32 + ) where additional planets may exist . for hd 3651 and hd 37605 , we havethat protected resonances are still present . combining these data with the limits computed by new high - resolution het data combined with the available kepler data is most effective for the hd 3651 and hd 45350 systems . additional long - period planets can be ruled - down to a few neptune masses in the dynamically stable state of these systems . this paper is based upon data provided by the national aeronautics and space administration , circular nos . nng04g141 g and nng05g107 g , through the terrestrial planet finder foundation grant program . we are grateful to the nasa tac for their generous donation of telescope funding for this project . we also would like to thank barbara mcarthur for her assistance with gaussfit software . we thank the referee , greg laughlin , for his positive review of this paper . this original paper made use of nasa astro -
