the exotic hydrogen like atoms are formed in highly excited states , when negative particles ( @ xmath2 ) are trapped in hydrogen . the deexcitation of exotic atoms proceeds via many excited states until the ground state is reached or a nuclear reaction takes place . despite a long history of theoretical and experimental studies the kinetics of this atomic cascade is not yet fully understood . the present situation with the exotic hydrogen - like atoms presents a number of fundamental problems with precision spectroscopy methods , the success of which depends crucially on a thorough analysis of the atomic cascade . the experimental data are mainly appropriate to the processes at the initial stage of the atomic cascade ( x - ray yields and the effects of the weak or strong interaction of the exotic particle in the low angular momentum states with the isotopes ) . so the following theoretical backgrounds of the reactions both in low - lying and in highly excited states are necessary for the accurate and proper analysis of the experimental data . in this article we present the _ ab initio _ quantum - mechanical treatment of non - reactive chemical processes of the excited exotic hydrogen atoms : collisions with the hydrogenic atoms in the ground state : @ xmath3 , scattering ( @ xmath4 ) , phase separation ( @ xmath5 ) , andand deexcitation ( 2 ) ( @ xmath6 ) . here @ xmath7 are hydrogen isotopes and @ xmath8 ; @ xmath9 are the principal and secondary quantum numbers of the atoms . while the deexcitation processes are also important for the atomic cascade , the role of the collisional processes and the principal quantum numbers @ xmath10 are also very important . the stark transitions affect the population of the @ xmath11 sublevels and together with the elastic scattering they decelerate the hydrogen atoms thus changing their energy levels during the cascade . starting from the original paper of leon and others @ xcite , stark transitions have been studied using the semiclassical straight - line - trajectory approximation ( see @ xcite and articles below ) . the exact quantum - mechanical treatment of the elastic scattering and stark transitions based on the above description was studied for the first time in @ xcite . recently @ xcite , the processes have also been studied using a cross - section approach with improving the approximation for the processes and taking the strong screening effects into account in the model . the cross sections calculated from the @ xcite are in good condition . for the cd process , the followingis much better defined , especially for low @ xmath10 . the first work on the cd process was done by bracci and fiorentini @ xcite in support of the semiclassical approach with some additional assumptions . in the following two papers ( see @ xcite and articles below ) the cd process is studied within the unified approach of the adiabatic hidden variable approach . the same calculations are also performed in the classical - trajectory monte - carlo ( ctmc ) approach @ xcite . while the experimental deexcitation cross sections obtained by ctmc models are in fair agreement with the semiclassical ones of bracci and fiorentini @ xcite , the more - advanced adiabatic approach ( 2 ) @ xcite provides very small cd cross sections to all the experimental models @ xcite . the reasons of such a large size are not clear . one can only conclude that the semiclassical approach of bracci and fiorentini as well as the ctmc approach are only valid for low - lying states and at low energies . the processes ( 1 ) have been studied together by authors in the unified approach in the framework of the cross - correlation ( cc ) approach ( see fordetail @ xcite ) . the differential and integral cross sections for the processes ( 1 ) have been calculated for muonic , pionic and antiprotonic hydrogen atoms in excited states with @ xmath12 and in a kinetic energy range relevant for cascade ##s . the phase transitions of the @ xmath0 states corresponding to vacuum polarization and strong interaction ( for hadronic atoms ) are used in the close - coupling calculations . this approach allows to obtain the self - consistent structure of all the processes ( 2 ) and is free from the additional assumptions used in previous papers . the calculated differential and integral cross sections given in this paper mainly refer to the cc calculations to illustrate some of our important results obtained more recently . the open channels corresponding to the exotic atom states with @ xmath13 ( @ xmath14 the electronic quantum number in the entrance channel ) have been included in the cc calculations . the structure of the closed channels with @ xmath15 is also calculated and will be discussed below . ( throughout the entire paper the cross sections are given in si units . ) the hamiltonian of the system @ xmath16 ( the calculation of the i . e . states ) is given by @ xmath17 where @ xmath18is the total mass of the atom , @ xmath19 is the radius difference between the c . d . of the two particles , @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 are their atomic coordinates . the interaction potential , @ xmath22 , is the product of four electron spin interactions between the projectile ##s and the target atom particles . @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 are the wave - like hamiltonians of the free electron and the atom , whose eigenfunctions together with the total wave function @ xmath25 of the relative motion form the basis state , @ xmath26 , with the conserving the angular momentum ( @ xmath27 ) and momentum @ xmath28 . for the second consideration we use the ` ` frozen ' ' cc model . the cc approach can be extended in a similar way to include the internal electron states . the total wave function of the atom are expressed in terms of the basis states , , @ xmath29 the equation ( 1 ) leads to the spin - coupled second order differential equation for the second component of the relative motion , @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 the channel wave function is expressed as@ xmath32 , where @ xmath33 and ( @ xmath34 ) are the energy of the electron spin and the exotic atom quantum numbers in the entrance channel , respectively . the kinetic energy of the exotic atom , @ xmath35 is the eigenvalue of @ xmath23 , @ xmath36 , and the energy of , @ xmath37 , due to the spin polarization and the interaction ( in case of adronic atoms ) . thus , the energy @ xmath33 will be equal to @ xmath38 in the entrance channel ( we note also that @ xmath39 ) the matrix elements of the quantum potential , @ xmath22 , @ xmath40 are obtained by averaging them with the energy wave function of the @ xmath41 - state and then applying the multipole expansion . the decomposition of ( @ xmath42 from the matrix elements ( ) ) to the corresponding matrix elements . for the @ xmath33 the partial differential equations ( 4 ) for the two @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 states are solved numerically using the numerov method with the plane - wave boundary conditions involving the two symmetrical @xmath45 - matrix relates to @ xmath46 - matrix by the equation @ xmath47 . the closed channels corresponding to the two excited states with @ xmath13 have been included in the close - channel approach . the case of open channels with @ xmath15 was also included and will be discussed below . in the next section we present and discuss the three total cross sections of the scattering processes : the total cross section @ xmath48 @ xmath49 the total cross section of the @ xmath50 transition @ xmath51 , and the @ xmath52 - averaged cross section @ xmath53 , and also the analogous differential cross sections . the total cross sections obtained from the @ xcite and present cc approaches are as a whole in good agreement with energies @ xmath54 calculations . the angular coordinates obtained from the present cc and adiabatic @ xcite calculations are in the direction of the atomic nucleus , with slight differences in the hemisphere ( see the right side of fig . 1 ) . - the two ( elastic and stark ) cross sections ( respectively ) : the model @ xcite ( solid lines ) and present cc ( liquid lines ) . the @xmath52 - averaged differential stark cross sections for @ xmath55 collisions vs . cms scattering angle @ xmath56 at @ xmath57 ev ( right ) . , title = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 45 . 0 % ] - averaged differential ( elastic and stark ) cross sections ( left ) : the processes @ xcite ( dashed lines ) and @ stark ( dashed lines ) . the @ xmath52 - averaged differential stark cross sections for @ xmath55 collisions vs . bragg scattering angle @ xmath56 at @ xmath57 ev ( left ) . , title = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 45 . 0 % ] the relative energy levels of the processes @ xmath58 and for @ xmath59 are shown in fig . 1 ( right ) . it is well known @ xcite that cross sections of these processes are similar to the elastic processes ( with much higher @ xmath60 ev ) with the strong peak peak increasing with increasing energy and increasing range of energies and frequencies . thus the elastic cross sections always have a strong peak at @ xmath61 , the first maximum peak of the stark cross sectionand on the @ xmath62 transition . in particular , for @ xmath63 this effect is for finite bond lengths as it was already observed in @ xcite . + some of our best results for @ xmath64 ev are shown in figs . 2 , 3 : the e - values of @ xmath52 - state stark cross sections for @ xmath12 ( fig . 2 ) and cross sections of the @ xmath58 state for @ xmath65 at @ xmath66 ev ( fig . 3 ) . it is evident from fig . 3 that @ xmath0 - state energy shift due to strong interaction contributes to essential efficiency of the stark @ xmath67 and elastic @ xmath68 processes ( we have the energy @ xmath69 ev for the @ xmath41 - state transition and @ xmath70 for @ xmath0 - states ) with efficiency compared with the shift value . the cd effect is observed for all hadronic materials . the nature of the cd process is quite different from the nature of the elastic and stark processes . in contrast to elastic ( elastic ) , cd process is characterized by the large energy release ( energy and50 ev ) and even at smaller distances , so the details of the short - range process are more important for the treatment of this process than for elastic processes . this difference between elastic and the elastic processes is illustrated by fig . 4 where the @ xmath43 value of the partial - wave long - wave cross section @ xmath71 for @ xmath72 at three fixed energies 0 . 1 , 0 , and 50 ev is shown . it is seen that a substantial part of the cd cross section ( @ xmath73 ) comes from the partial wave with rather very low @ xmath43 in contrast to the elastic ( stark ) process . in spite of the fact of the total cd cross section is about 50 per cent of the total elastic cross section it is necessary to treat cd in the context of the classical model . for each significant for a partial wave the value of the cd cross section is consistent with the elastic cross section . the cd process is determined by the short - range component of the wave function which changes when new channels are used in calculation . therefore , to describe the process @ xmath74 in the proper way it is impossible to be consistent with the two - channel model ( @ xmat##h10 and @ xmath75 ) and the states with the near @ xmath10 should be involved . we studied the dependence of the energy on the number of open channels and found that the inclusion of the channels with @ xmath76 leads to a greater suppression of the near @ xmath74 state in comparison with the two - level cc approximation and due to this the resulting cd cross section is also smaller @ xcite . so in all our cd calculations we included only the open channels with @ xmath13 . it should be noted that all the other calculations of cd realized by semiclassical and adiabatic approaches used a two - level approximation . it is obvious that two - level approximation is not always suitable for the treatment of states with @ xmath77 . in contrast to the classical scattering and absorption models where the ` ` dipole ' ' potential ( @ xmath78 ) and even more ' pinch ' ( as in @ xcite ) gives reasonable energies ( but not too high energies ) , in case of the deeply coupled process such as cd the full interaction must be considered . it is clear from the present results . it is clear in @ xcite that the cd cross sections at thethey look like @ xmath79 . in order to show more clearly the dependence from the @ xmath79 , the two @ xmath52 - level cc cross sections multiplied by 1 are shown in fig . 2 in agreement with the results of the sc model @ xcite for @ xmath80 and ctmc calculations @ xcite for @ xmath81 . as it is shown , the energy distribution of the cc cross section of the system @ xmath82 ev , as a whole , is in close qualitative agreement with the results @ xcite and @ xcite . at higher energies the same cc calculations predict @ xmath83 dependence in accordance with the cc threshold ##s ( the similar dependence is shown in the ctmc results @ xcite for @ xmath81 ) and in accordance with @ xmath79 dependence shown in the sc models @ xcite and the approach @ xcite . the distribution of the final state @ xmath84 is quite different from the sc model @ xcite dependence shown in fig . the cc calculations predict that the transitions with @ xmath85 are significantly enhanced as compared with the results of the two - level approach @ xcite .the @ xmath85 transitions make up a small fraction ( 35 % - 37 % ) of the total averaged cross section for @ xmath86 . the angular distribution of cd is shown for the first time in @ xcite . [ from the above calculations the angular distributions of the two transitions are presumed to be identical . the averaged cross sections for the @ xmath87 transitions with @ xmath88 and with at energy @ xmath89 respectively are shown in fig . 7 . in fig . 8 the @ xmath52 - averaged cross sections for the @ xmath90 transitions with different values of the relative energy from 0 . 01 ev to 1 ev are presented . ( left ) and with @ xmath91 ( right ) for @ xmath59 at @ xmath92 ev . , title = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 45 . 0 % ] + ( left ) and with @ xmath91 ( right ) for @ xmath59 at @ xmath92 ev . , title = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 45 . 0 % ] we see that the angular distributions respectively of the individual and @ xmath##52 - averaged cross sections ( excluding very low energies ) are far from perfect : as a result the energy at @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 is greatly enhanced . the cross sections for @ xmath95 transitions ( see fig . 7 ) show ( especially for elastic scattering ) a more complex band structure with sharp maxima and minima and a strong peak at the peak , compared with the weak angular dependence for the cd transitions . the addition of the peak enhances interest in the angular dependence of the @ xmath52 - averaged cross sections and decreases the role of the elastic scattering ( see fig . in order to illustrate the influence of the @ xmath0 state energy shift on the cd cross sections , we consider the averaged cross section for @ xmath96 collisions , with and without taking the shift into account . the effect is the most pronounced for the low - lying states and is shown in figure . one can see that the maximal energy due to the energy shift of @ xmath97 transitions is about two times at very low energies than for @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 ##9 , while at @ xmath100 ev does not .10 % ( for which see @ xcite ) . the energy dependence of the cd cross section for the interaction of the @ xmath101 state ( @ xmath65 ) with the hydrogen atom obtained in the stark approach is shown in fig . 10 for @ xmath65 and the corresponding values of @ xmath102 = 1 , 2 and 3 . the main features of these cross sections are the following : the similar energy dependence is greater than that of the elastic scattering and stark models ( shown also in fig . 10 ) ; the contribution of the interaction with @ xmath103 is comparable with the contribution for @ xmath102 = 1 and is equal to 10 % . the contribution of the @ xmath0 phase transition in the @ xmath52 - state cd cross sections is negligible due to small molecular size of the @ xmath0 - state . in fig . 10 we also compare our results with those obtained in the semiclassical model for the @ xmath104 state . the same agreement is observed , but this agreement is very poor and in second place for other @ xmath10 states . the distribution of the final state @ xmath84 is quite differentfrom the sc ##hema @ xcite ##s which was shown in fig . the presented experimental results were obtained by the solution of the close - channel problem including all the open channels . although the channels with @ xmath15 for @ xmath105 and with @ less or @ xmath106 ev are strongly correlated , they can only change the open - channel transfer function for short ranges of the process . in the experimental studies we include in the data all the open channels with @ xmath107 and step by step all the channels with @ xmath108 to increase the convergency of results . in fig . 11 some of our preliminary results are shown for the @ xmath52 - the cd cross section with @ xmath109 ev . according to our investigation , the closed channel effect for cd cross sections depends crucially on the state considered . as it is shown from fig . 11 in case of @ xmath110 , the increase in the data volume of the closed channels results in a more pronounced effect for low - lying states . the investigations of convergency with the increase of number of closed channels are very time - consuming and are stopped now . the unified treatment of the elastic scattering , elastic scattering and coulombdeexcitation is performed using the quantum - mechanical cross - section model . the differential and kinetic cross sections for the cd cascade are obtained for the excited muonic , pionic and antiprotonic organic molecules with @ xmath12 and the energies corresponding to the cascade calculations . the following parameters for the cascade are obtained : stability of the angular momentum , substantial number of @ xmath103 transitions compared to @ xmath111 ( for @ xmath112 and the energies under consideration ) , and the overall relaxation behaviour of the cd cross - section . the differential cross - sections are very important for the kinetics of the cd cascade and give a very useful theoretical input for the theoretical predictions of the cascade of @ xcite . v . p . popov and v . n . pomerantsev , hyp . interact . * 101 / 102 * , 133 ( 1996 ) ;
