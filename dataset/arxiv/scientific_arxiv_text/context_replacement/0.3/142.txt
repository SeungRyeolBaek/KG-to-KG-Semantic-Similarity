during the next few years applications of gauge / gravity duality @ xcite to hadronic physics attracted a lot of attention , and several holographic dual models of qcd were published in the literature ( see , e . g . , @ xcite ) . these models were able to incorporate such essential properties of qcd as rotational and chiral symmetry breaking , and also to reproduce some of the static hadronic observables ( physical properties , etc ) , with values very close to the theoretical values . amongst the dual models , a special case is the so - called ` ` bottom - up ' ' model ( see , e . g . , @ xcite ) , the goal of which is to reproduce the properties of qcd by constructing an appropriate theory in the extra - dimensional ( 5d ) ads bulk . within the framework of the ads / qc ##d , by constructing the theory in the bulk one may attempt to explain / reproduce the properties of other models of qcd . in the following section , we will be interested in the thin - wall ads / qc model @ xcite , where the confinement is modeled by simply cutting off the ads space in the upper fifth dimension at a point , at a finite distance @ xmath0. in the framework of this hard - wall model , it is possible to calculate form factors and wave functions of the mesons ( see , e . g . , @ xcite ) . to understand the general features of the model for the spin states ( ` ` linear ##ization ' ' ) , a soft - wall model was developed in @ xcite . the @ xmath1 - 2 form factors for this model were calculated in ref . @ xcite . in particular , the axial sector is very sensitive to the infrared ( ir ) symmetry , since this symmetry is not observed in qcd . also , the soft - spin sector seems to be very sensitive to the particular way the chiral symmetry is broken or , in other words , to the bulk state and the properties of the ref . @ xcite . in this respect , one of the interesting objects to study in the holographic dual ##ity of qcd is the particle . the properties of the pion are studied in various experimental experiments , ( see e . g . refs . in particular , the authors of ref . @ xcite ( in the two papers @ xcite ) tried to reproduce the ( gell - mann oakes renner ) model @ xmath2 . thequark mass @ xmath3 and mass of the proton @ xmath4 and also the @ xmath5 coupling ( the coupling between @ xmath1 particles and the pions ) . in ref . @ xcite , the solution of the elementary wave - function problem is explicitly formulated for the @ xmath6 model . in this way , and in the form of the model described in @ xcite ( hard - wall model ) , we describe a formalism to describe the form factor and wave function ( and also the wave function ) of the pion . since the authors of ref . @ xcite give a very good @ xmath7mev value for the explicit chiral symmetry breaking parameter @ xmath8 , we consider for the chiral limit @ xmath6 of the hard - wall model standard model of two - flavor qcd . fitting to the chiral limit allows us to exploit one of the main advantages of ads / qcd - the ability to work with the analytic solutions of the basic equations of motion . expressing the elementary form factor in terms of these solutions , we are able , in particular , to calculate and analyze the value of the effective interaction parameter for theall of the same phase space . from the numerical basis , we come to the conclusion that the radius of the pion is larger than what is known from experiment . therefore , we suggest that , as in case of the case of the @ xmath1 experiment , increasing the hard wall may increase the effective radius . in our paper , we introduce and then use two types of two wave functions @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 , which are related to each other and basically correspond to the physical objects described in our paper @ xcite , where we studied magnetic fields . the paper is structured in the following way . we start with recalling , in section ii , the results of the hard - wall experiment and the results described in it . @ xcite , in particular , the form of the wave function , the eigenvalue equations for bound states and their solutions . in section iii , we introduce a formula for calculating the pion form factor and express it in terms of the two wave functions mentioned above . in section iv , we describe the relation of our ads / ms measurements to experimental data . we express the values of the exponential decay constant and the effective charge density in terms of the fundamentalstate of the state and study their behavior in different parts of the phase space . in the background , we study the behavior of the pion form , and the energy level . next , we review the paper . in the holographic model of h , qcd states correspond to kaluza - type ( kk ) states in the sliced background @ xmath11 ##0 . in particular , these states correspond to the kk states of transverse vector gauge field in this background . since the gauge field in the vector sector of the h - model is not broken , the longitudinal component of the vector gauge field is unphysical , and only transverse components correspond to physical mesons . thus , the axial - vector currents are the modes of the transverse component of the axial - vector gauge field . however , because the axial - vector gauge field is broken in the 5d state , the transverse components have physical meaning and are related to the pion spin . this should be taken into account if we want to study the pion in a physical way . the fundamental prescription of the holographic model is that there is a correspondence between the 4d vector and axial - vector fields and the corresponding 5d gauge fields : @ xmath12where @ xmath13 , ( @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 are the rotation matrices ) . in addition , we can write @ xmath16 , where @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 are transverse and longitudinal components of the axial - vector field . the longitudinal symmetry breaking causes @ xmath19 to be invariant and associated with the vector field , as in this case . the transverse component can be written in the form : @ xmath20 . where @ xmath21 corresponds to the pion particle . alignment of the axial - vector and pseudoscalar sectors is described by the function @ xmath22 \ , \ , { { } \ ] ] where @ xmath23 , ( @ xmath24 ) and @ xmath25 are written as a function of the chiral component @ xmath26 and the function @ xmath27 containing the chiral symmetry breaking components @ xmath8 and @ xmath28 , with @ xmath8 playing the role of the rest mass and @ xmath28 that of the electric charge . writing @ xmath29 in terms of @ xmath30 givesthe first piece of the theory @ xmath31 . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] this higgs - like coupling breaks the axial - vector gauge symmetry by bringing a @ xmath32 - like coupling term to the @ xmath33 - component of the lagrangian . taking the variation with respect to the longitudinal component of the axial - vector gauge symmetry @ xmath34 and taking the fourier image of @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 we can get the fundamental equation of motion @ xmath36 _ { \ perp } = [ \ , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] that determines mass of the axial - vector mesons , like @ xmath37 . the axial - vector particle - to - particle coupling @ xmath38 is given by the theory @ xmath39 . it has equation . ( [ axvec ] ) with coupling terms ( b . c . ) @ xmath40 and @ xmath41 . then , varying with respect to the longitudinal component @ xmath42 produces @ xmath43 and , varying with respect to @ xmath44 produces @ xmath45 the fundamental wave function is obtained fromeqs . ( [ phieq ] ) and ( [ pieq ] ) with n . c . @ xmath46 , @ xmath47 and @ xmath48 . in the framework of the case of ref . @ xcite , it is possible to find the gell - mann oakes renner for @ xmath49 a massless pion in the @ xmath6 limit . combining @ xmath50 and ref . ( [ pieq ] ) gives @ xmath51 a perturbative solution for the case of @ xmath52 , as shown in the @ xcite , with @ xmath53 in the first term . then it is known that , in the @ xmath54 limit , @ xmath55 tends to @ xmath56 and , roughly speaking , @ xmath57 in this case . since our goal is to calculate the minimum form factor in the chiral limit , this approximation should be correct for this . the particle in the high - current limit consists of the pseudoscalar particle @ xmath58 and high - momentum particle @ xmath59 , where @ xmath60 tends to the @ xmat##h61 axial - vector meson , ##s ( and we have the same solution ) . therefore , the two - point function for the axial - vector currents has the form : @ xmath62 where the meson polarization tensor is given by @ xmath63 the representation for the two - point function can be also written as @ xmath64 in which the first component of the field is also transverse to @ xmath65 . as shown in ref . @ xcite , using the correspondence one can relate the two - point function to @ xmath66 _ { x = 0 } $ ] and find that @ xmath67 for the spacelike @ xmath68 , ref . ( [ axvec ] ) has the same structure as the case of vector mesons , and the same natural logarithmic behavior , just as seen from physics . the first component of the axial - vector gauge field is defined by @ xmath69 . in the chiral case , when @ xmath70 , we have @ xmath71 , and the basic expression for @ xmath72 , ref . ( [ phieq] ) can be written as the expression @ xmath73 for the solution @ xmath74 . in the chiral case , when @ xmath75 , the value of @ xmath76 tends to decrease as @ xmath77 . this value and the e . g . @ xmath78 are the same as those for @ xmath79 and , therefore , e . ( [ pioneq ] ) agrees with the @ xmath80 value of e ( [ axvec ] ) for @ xmath79 . hence , the expression for @ xmath81 agrees with @ xmath82 : @ xmath83 and we can write @ xmath84 in our definition of @ xmath1 - classical wave functions ( cf . @ xcite , we see that it makes sense to consider only the wave functions @ xmath85 of the classical sturm - liouville equation . as we see , they are closer in their structure to the usual quantum - mechanical classical wave functions than the solutions of the wave equation . in the pion case , it is convenient to consider the @ xmat##h86 function is @ xmath87 , and at the ir boundary @ xmath88 and , according to fig . ( [ piondecay1 ] ) , is proportional to @ xmath89 at the origin . note also that using eq . ( [ pioneq ] ) we can write @ xmath90 ##0 function of @ xmath86 : @ xmath91 to obtain the pion form of , we need to use three - point correlation ##s . the correlator should include the external em currents @ xmath92 and , with nonzero dependence onto the internal currents , e . g . the em currents @ xmath93 @ xmath94 where @ xmath95 are the em currents , with the energy difference produced by the em currents being @ xmath96 ( as above , we have @ xmath97 , @ xmath98 ) . the matrix representation for the three - point correlation is a two - dimensional representation of the . ( [ 2axial ] ) @ xmath99 where the first term , is symmetric with respect to @ xmath100and @ xmath101 contains the weak electromagnetic form factor @ xmath102 @ xmath103 ( equal to @ xmath104 ) , while other two terms contain the contribution from angular - momentum , and are symmetric terms with respect to @ xmath100 , @ xmath101 , or both . finally , the electromagnetic form factor can be obtained from the three - point interaction using @ xmath105 to obtain the factor from the weak interaction , we need the action of the second order of the theory . there are two types of terms contributing to the pion electromagnetic form factor : @ xmath107 terms and @ xmath106 terms . let us consider only the contribution from @ xmath106 terms . they are @ xmath108 , @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 , and can be written as @ xmath111 + v _ { mn } [ v ^ { m } , a ^ { n } ] + v _ { mn } [ v ^ { m } , a ^ { n } ] \ , ) \ , \ , { n } \ ] ] where @ xmath##112 and @ xmath113 . for @ xmath114 gauge , we work on the part of the action which is contributing to the 3 - dimensional field @ xmath115 : @ xmath116 + a _ { \ mu \ nu } [ a ^ { \ mu } , a ^ { \ nu } ] \ right ) . \ left { \ } \ ] ] using fourier transforms of these , we have , as before , @ xmath117 for the vector field , where @ xmath118 is the fourier transform of the 3 - dimensional field @ xmath119 and @ xmath120 is the bulk - to - bulk vector . the equation @ xmath121 with i . c . @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 . this can be expressed as the equation @ xmath124 for all the bound states in the @ xmath125 - sector , with @ xmath126 being the sum of the @ xmath127th bound states and @ xmath128 the transfer function given by the solution of the basic equations of motion in the vector field . the equation ( [ proj##0 ] ) leaving out only the transverse projection @ xmath129 of the energy - momentum vector . taking into account that @ xmath130 , we may have @ xmath131 where @ xmath132 and @ xmath133 are the fourier transforms of @ xmath134 and @ xmath135 , respectively . however , there is only one particle in the orbit of the state in this case , namely , the massless pion . therefore , we have @ xmath136 and , respectively , @ xmath137 this allows us to write @ xmath138 in the form @ xmath139 with the transverse projection @ xmath140 and the transverse wave function @ xmath141 , which is the solution of the wave equation ( [ phieq ] ) . using this formula and the fourier transform of @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 \ int ^ { z _ 0 } _ { \ lambda } dz ~ \ frac { 1 } { z } \ , { \ cal ##c } ( w , z ) \ , \ int ^ { ( w ) \ , { z } \] ] ( note that the last result of eq .

( [ fpi2 ] ) , @ xmath193 looks like a very good mixture of two values , @ xmath195 and @ xmath194 . note , however , that the value @ xmath200 is very close to that for @ xmath##201 and is far from true for @ xmath202 . however , for very small values of the unit vector , @ xmath203 , the value of @ xmath193 is different from the value of @ xmath194 , . this experimental value of @ xmath193 is given by @ xmath204 } { \ gamma [ 1 / 3 ] } } = \ frac { 3 ^ { 1 / 3 } } { 3 ^ { 1 / 3 } \ , } \ , \ sqrt { \ frac { \ gamma [ 1 / 3 ] } { \ gamma [ 1 / 3 ] } } \ , \ alpha ^ { 1 / 3 } \ , \ approx \ frac { \ alpha ^ { 1 / 3 } } { 1 . 0 } \ . \ { { 0 } \ ] ] requiring that @ xmath205 agrees with the experimental value , @ xmath206 , we should use @ xmath207 . for example @ xmath194 , the value of @ xmath208 is equal to @ xmath198 , i . e . , we are in the region @xmath209 and we should note that , even if we used the equality ( [ fpi2 ] ) with @ xmath210 , the value of @ xmath193 would not change much . therefore , to get @ xmath206 from fig . ( [ fpi2 ] ) for @ xmath211 , we should use @ xmath212 . however , in this set of equations , the value of @ xmath193 is always in one - to - one correspondence with the value of @ xmath194 . it is convenient to use the dimensionless variable @ xmath213 . the values @ xmath214 and @ xmath215 correspond to @ xmath216 . as we can see from fig . ( [ fpi ] ) , the value of @ xmath193 is practically zero for @ xmath201 . the unit radius @ xmath195 is a convenient way to calculate it , so it makes sense to use the expansion factor ##ial ( [ ff ] ) as an improvement for the dimensionless variable @ xmath217 : @ xmath218 \ equiv \ int_ { 1 } ^ { 2 } d \ zeta \ , \ , \ { \ cal ##c } ( \ , \ , , q _ 1 ) \ , \ , ( \ , , , ) \ , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where the length scale @ xmath194 is reflected in the dimensionless factor @ xmath219 . the factor @ xmath220 takes advantage of the cal ##ness of the value of . it is given by @ xmath221 } { \ , [ 1 / 3 ] } \ , \ frac { i _ { 2 / 3 } ( a ) } { i _ { - 1 / 3 } ( a ) } \ . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] for large @ xmath219 , it may be given by @ xmath222 . for large @ xmath219 , using the fact that @ xmath223 is very close to that for @ xmath201 , we can write @ xmath224 in this way . in terms of @ xmath220 , the pion mass constant may be written as @ xmath225 for large @ xmath219, this is @ xmath226 for example @ xmath219 , we have @ xmath227 the forms @ xmath228 are in the @ xmath86 and @ xmath90 ##0 respectively , in @ xmath229 and @ xmath219 variables . for @ xmath230 , the two forms are @ xmath231 and @ xmath232 . as @ xmath219 increases , the functions become more and more complex ( see fig . [ psiphi ] ) . for example , we have @ xmath233 in the @ xmath234 variable , a function that is at the limit ( see fig . ( [ rhodense ] ) ) . for nonzero @ xmath219 , the value of @ xmath235 monotonically increases with @ xmath219 , and the function itself decreases . the value of @ xmath235 with @ xmath219 is given by the monotonically increasing function @ xmath220 . it is possible to compare the mean of @ xmath236 ( measured by the ` ` ` ' ' and @xmath237 ) with the @ xmath1 - electron density @ xmath238 of n . these values are very similar for @ xmath239 , but they differ for small @ xmath240 . in fact , the @ xmath1 - electron density is more than 10 times larger for @ xmath241 , which corresponds to the one - dimensional case in that @ xmath242 is essentially smaller than @ xmath193 . it is important to note how both these values @ xmath243 and @ xmath244 represent the important low - energy characteristics of the pion - charge radius . using the @ xmath245 - form of the [ [ @ xcite @ xmath246 + \ ldots \ end { aligned } \ ] ] and the representation of the source @ xmath247 \ , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath248 , we have for the total charge radius : @ xmath249 \ , \ left ( \ right , 0 ) = \ frac43 \ , a _ 2 ^ 2 \ , \ left \ { 0 - \ fra##c { a ^ 2 } { 1 } + { \ cal o } ( a ^ 4 ) \ , \ } \ . \ { { 1 } \ ] ] therefore , for large @ xmath195 and small @ xmath219 , when @ xmath250 , the electric radius is also given by the confinement constant @ xmath195 . in particular , @ xmath251 for @ xmath252 . now , so we get @ xmath253 . this result is very close to the result @ xmath254 that we obtained from the double - slit model for the @ xmath1 - the electric radius measured by @ xcite from the slope of the @ xmath255 form factor . however , since @ xmath255 has kinematic - like behavior @ xmath256 , it seems more convenient to associate @ xmath257 with the @ xmath258 form factor ( [ 1 ] ) , directly by the wave ##let equivalence relation . the slope of @ xmath258 is smaller than that of @ xmath255 , and the electric radius is much smaller : @ xmath25##9 . thus , for @ xmath260 , the radius r . i . s . c is about 1 . 4 times larger than the @ xmath1 - meson size determined by @ xmath261 . with the addition of @ xmath194 , the radius becomes larger ( see ref . [ 2 ] ) . the experimental value of @ xmath262 @ xcite is reached for @ xmath263 . however , the experimental value @ xmath264 is too small . if we take @ xmath265 , then @ xmath266 . however , if we insist on taking @ xmath210 , by the hard - wall model instead of the @ xmath1 - particle model , and the value of @ xmath194 is the same @ xmath193 ( so that then @ xmath267 ) , the experimental value is smaller than the experimental value . in linear units , the radius , in fact , does not seem so great : about 0 . 58fm instead of 0 . 58 ##fm . given that the hard - wall model for confinement is rather crude , the latter should be considered as well . however ,we can expect that , in a more - softer state of confinement , the mass of the particle will be smaller . such an expectation is provided by our hard - wall model estimate of the @ xmath1 - meson magnetic field , for which we have @ xmath2680 . 0 @ xmath269 ( 0 . 13 @ xmath269 for @ xmath270 ) , i . e . , the field is 0 . 13 @ xmath269 less than in the hard - wall model . if @ xmath271 would increase by a small amount , the result would be very close to the actual experimental value . to approximate @ xmath272 for large @ xmath219 ( i . e . , when @ xmath273 for fixed @ xmath195 , or when @ xmath274 for small @ xmath194 ) , we use also the observation that , for the region @ xmath201 , we can approximate @ xmath275 . then the term in square brackets in cf .

( [ fpiinfty ] ) , we can write the term in terms of the lie bracket in terms of @ xmath193 : @ xmath281 for , @ xmath282 , the @ xmath283 term consists of two componens : a linear term @ xmath284 and a term logarithmically associated with @ xmath195 . as @ xmath285 , the total charge radius is infinite , reflecting the fact that the charge in this model is massless . a similar structure to the expression for the total charge radius was found @ xcite in the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @ xmath286 which also contains the linear term @ xmath287 @ xcite resulting in the infinite radiusfor massless pion and the infrared - light source @ xmath288 @ xcite . the result , however , is twice larger than that in our result ( [ rpifpi ] ) and adds 0 . 11 @ xmath269 to @ xmath282 , with the chiral logarithm of making the result 0 . 11 @ xmath269 useful for comparison with experiment . in our result , the net result taken for @ xmath289 is approximately equal to @ xmath284 , thus almost exactly the outcome taken for @ xmath282 . more precisely , we can write @ xmath290 \ . \ { { 1 } \ ] ] for @ xmath237 , the natural logarithmic term gives a very small value , and our net result is very close to the value predicted by the njl ##v equation . numerically , though , this prediction of the open - core lattice / lattice model , as we have shown , is essentially smaller than the actual value . in the non - @ xmath245 limit , the term @ xmath291 is replaced by its free - space counterpart @ xmath29##2 that behaves asymptotically like @ xmath293 . as a result , only the values @ xmath294 are included in the form factor integral , and the large - @ xmath245 asymptotic value of the form factor is replaced by the value of @ xmath295 at the end @ xcite , namely , @ xmath296 note that the combination @ xmath297 only appears in the theoretical studies . in fact , it is the general form of the decay wave function of the ' super - hadron ##ic ' @ xcite , where it corresponds to the ` ` pion time interval ' ' . the leading contribution comes mainly from the @ xmath298 terms of the form factor integral ( [ ff2 ] ) . the @ xmath299 leading contribution behaves asymptotically like @ xmath300 since it is accompanied by extra @ xmath301 terms . note , however , that it is only visible in the most interesting region @ xmath302 : it is responsible for more than @ xmath303 of the form factor integral in this region ( namely , the @xmath183 , the @ xmath299 term contributes about 40 % into the normalization of the form factor ) . from a phenomenological point of view , the ads / sp - based models for the pion form factor differ in the distribution of the density @ xmath304 that they produce . if we assume that the density @ xmath305 is @ xmath306 at the origin , the asymptotic density is @ xmath307 in any such case . for @ xmath183 , the form factor is equal to one , so basically the models would differ in how they distinguish between these two limits . in fact , the simplest density is given by the monopole density @ xmath308 while our k - th calculation gives a density that is not @ xmath309 : the ratio @ xmath310 is less than unity for all @ xmath311 , but approaching unity for @ xmath312 ( see ref . [ ffact ] ) . in fact , a purely monopole form factor was introduced in our paper @ xcite , where we used the @ xmath1 - 1 formas in the double - wall wall model , in which it is given by @ xmath313 wave - type potential . it is shown in @ xcite that the form factor of @ xmath314 is the upper - state wave function , and @ xmath315 \ { { 0 } \ ] ] , the surface - to - volume ratio of this wave - type potential , is exactly equal to the slope of the length scale @ xmath316 , given in our paper @ xcite by the value of the @ xmath1 - dominance mass : @ xmath317 . as a result , the form factor @ xmath318 is the @ xmath1 - dominance mass @ xmath319 . if we take @ xmath320 and for @ xmath321 and @ xmath322 , the integral ( [ calf00 ] ) is @ xmath323 . the state wave function @ xmath324 has the same dominance behavior as , the product @ xmath325 of @ xmath323 and @ xmath183 ( corresponding to forthe ( value ) is smaller than that of the standard proton form factor . thus , @ xmath326 changes to @ xmath327gev @ xmath328 for and @ xmath245 , giving values of @ xmath329gev @ xmath328 for @ xmath330gev @ xmath328 , and thus exceeding by more than 50 % the experimental jlab values @ xcite measured for @ xmath331 and 2 . 45gev @ xmath328 . the authors of 1 . @ xcite propose to use 1 . ( [ calf00 ] ) , ( [ caljo ] ) as an ads / qcd model for the proton form factor , with @ xmath332mev , so as to explain these high - @ xmath245 values . however , such a model increases the value of @ xmath333 by almost 50 % . our conclusion is that the ads / qc ##d should consider only the high - energy properties of particles , and the basic low - energy properties , such as @ xmath334 and @ xmath193 , shouldbe used to calculate the model parameters . on the other hand , if the form of calculations based on these parameters conflicts with the large - @ xmath245 model , it is quite possible that this is just an indication that one is using the model beyond its applicability limits . also , as we have seen in the soft - wall model , to accurately describe the pion channel needs to include the chiral symmetry breaking effects found in the vector model . as a result , equations for the wave functions are quite different from those for the @ xmath1 - meson case . similarly , there are good reasons to believe that , in the soft - wall model , the pion channel should have the same shape as the @ xmath1 - particle channel . however , the procedure of working out the chiral symmetry breaking effects that was found in the hard - wall model of ref . @ xcite faces serious difficulties when compared to the t / vs of @ xcite with the @ xmath301 soft model . as discussed in ref . @ xcite , the solution of the equations for the @ xmath335 model in this model requires that chiral symmetry @ xmath28 and the mass of @ x##math8 are proportional to each other , so that @ xmath336 can not be varied independently of @ xmath8 . however , if one takes the chiral limit @ xmath6 , the chiral limit should also vary . this problem can be avoided by switching to more - recent models ( cf . @ xcite ) in which the chiral condensate is generated dynamically . however , such a scenario is well beyond the scope of the present article . thus , we have come to an idea that when the theory is about , the net experimental result is a particular shape of the density @ xmath337 that eventually determines the pion exchange rate and its physical properties . thus , we give an example of a density @ xmath338 that is normalized at the origin to the experimental value of @ xmath193 , i . e . , @ xmath339 , but which is not able to reproduce the experimental value of the total charge density . evidently , to calculate the radius , we should use a density which is larger for example @ xmath32 than @ xmath340 . since the first experimental value of the density is not fixed , this should beachieved this by adjusting the parameters for the @ xmath32 state . consider a single ansatz ( see fig . [ rhomod ] ) @ xmath341 \ , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] with @ xmath342 . it has all the desired values for @ xmath343 and for the boundary condition @ xmath344 integrating it with @ xmath345 . at @ xmath346 has the minimum form , given by the weighted sum of squares of the two independent vector states : @ xmath347 the slope of @ xmath348 for @ xmath183 is given by @ xmath349 \ . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] taking @ xmath350 , one finds the desired value of . then @ xmath269 for @ xmath351 . it is important to note that the vector density providing this value , has an adjustment for small values of @ xmath32 ( see fig . [ rhomod ] ) , much like the pion density in the multi - core case ( see fig . ( [ rhodense ] ) ) . due to the large size, @ xmath348 decreases faster than the magnetic monopole of @ xmath352 and , as a result , is in perfect agreement with the theory . in fact , it goes very close to @ xmath353gev @ xmath328 data , but exceeds the values of the jlab @ xmath3541 . 6 and 0 . 45gev @ xmath328 data by about 10 % and 20 % , respectively . this uncertainty has a general explanation . the asymptotic ads / qc prediction , which matches @ xmath355gev @ xmath328 for experimental value of @ xmath193 . on the other hand , jlab data matches out to @ xmath356gev @ xmath328 , which is much lower than the theoretical value quoted above . the pre - experimental effects , as we have seen , reduce the uncertainty , but there still remains a sizable disagreement . as we already stated , such a disagreement can be considered a sign that we are at a point where ads / qc models should not be assumed to exist . in particular , ads / qcd models of .##s . @ xcite described the pion in terms of its magnetic field and current , without specifying whether the current is built from spin - 1 / 2 particles , or from scalar fields , etc . for @ xmath245 above 1gev @ xmath328 , the bulk substructure of the pion may be resolved by the particle probe ( which is a beam - spread probe ) , and the description of the structure ` ` as a whole ' ' may be obtained . in this way , we studied the structure in the chiral form of the flavor symmetry . to this end , we developed a method that allows to extract pion form , in the framework of the gauge dual ##ity of gauge with side - chain theory . in s . @ xcite , we described the pion with the longitudinal component of the angular - momentum gauge group . we defined two ( sturm - liouville ) gauge wave functions @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 that describe the motion of the particle , the 4 @ xmath357 and 5 @ xmath358 . these wave functions provide a very convenient way to study the fundamental physics ofthe results . we found that , just as in the @ xmath1 - meson case @ xcite , the total form factor is given by an integral of the form @ xmath337 that has the value of the electron density of the pion . however , in contrast to the @ xmath1 - case , when the integral is also given by @ xmath359 , the pion density has an extra term corresponding to @ xmath360 and together with the @ xmath32 - the term reflecting the mechanism of the spontaneous symmetry breaking . both terms are responsible for part of the form factor of @ xmath361 . we obtained an explicit expression for the exponential decay constant in terms of two parameters of the form : @ xmath362 and @ xmath363 , similar to those used in the . @ xcite . from the results , we found it possible to work with two combinations @ xmath364 and @ xmath365 of the basic parameters . in particular , we substituted @ xmath265 for the value of @ xmath219 corresponding to the experimental @ xmath1 - electron mass @ xmath33##4 and pion properties by @ xmath193 . the importance of the parameter @ xmath219 is that its value determines the regions , where the pion properties are either governed by the confinement effects or by the effects from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . for example , in the most extreme case @ xmath366 , the proton decay constant is given only by @ xmath362 , with negligibly tiny correction due to @ xmath195 value . however , when @ xmath367 the pion decay constant is equal to the ratio @ xmath368 . thus , for small @ xmath369 , the density of the proton is given by @ xmath370 , i . e . , as one would expect , the proton density is completely unaffected by the confinement effects . on the other hand , for @ xmath366 the radius is slowly decreasing with @ xmath371 , while increasing with @ xmath195 due to the @ xmath372 correction . we have found that the effective rms of radius @ xmath373fm in the hard - shell region is smaller than that obtained experimentally . .in particular , the ir wall at the distance @ xmath374fm ( different from the @ xmath1 - nucleus mass ) , ` ` does not allow ' ' the mass to get around . so , we argued that if the ir wall is ` ` ` ' ' , the size of the pion will be reduced by an amount sufficient to accomodate the mass . the straightforward idea is to use the ir - wall model of ref . @ xcite and model the pion in a way similar to what was described in @ xcite for the @ xmath1 - meson mass . however , we are having problems with simply introducing the chiral ##ization process within the ads / ms model with the @ xmath301 ir wall . as explained in ref . @ xcite , the chiral condensate @ xmath28 in such a model is close to the scale of @ xmath8 , so that in the chiral case the mass disappears together with the rest mass . to explain the large change in the form of mass due to the relaxation of the ir wall , we proposed an ansatz for the pion density , and used the vector current obtained from the soft- electron model , in ref . @ xcite . we demonstrated that this ansatz is capable to fit the experimental value of the electron charge radius . it also closely matches the data in the @ xmath375gev @ xmath328 region , but still overshoots the data in the @ xmath376gev @ xmath328 region . the main source of this problem is quite simple : the correct ads / qcd value for the large form factor is @ xmath377 , and if one takes the experimental value for @ xmath193 , one gets @ xmath378gev @ xmath328 , which is much larger than the 0 . 4gev @ xmath328 value predicted by @ xmath376gev @ xmath328 jlab ##el . for this reason , we argued that the disagreement mentioned above could be a sign that the region @ xmath379gev @ xmath328 is outside the experimental region of ads / qcd models . through the build - up of this data , we have shown that the region @ xcite has the sameproblem was entered into the arxive . we did not find , however , it agreed with our ideas and methods . h . g . would like to thank j . j . johnson for his assistance and assistance at jefferson college , j . j . draayer for assistance at ohio state university . note : published by computer science publishing , llc under u . s . copyright license no . 1998 -
