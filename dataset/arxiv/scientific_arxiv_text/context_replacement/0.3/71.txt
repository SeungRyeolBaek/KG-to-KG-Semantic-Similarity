topological phase of condensed matter physics is a quantum many - body state with nontrivial topological and topological space topology in the topological spaces @ xcite . the newly discovered topological superconductor ( tsc ) has attracted considerable interest since this kind of topological phase supports the existence of majorana phase ( bf ) @ xcite which is a promising candidate for the fault - tolerant topological quantum computer ( tqc ) @ xcite . there are several proposals for hosting ns in tsc , for example , chiral @ xmath1 - topological superconductor @ xcite , metal - doped topological phase @ xmath2 @ xcite , superconducting topological phase @ xcite and noncentrosymmetric superconductor ( ns ) @ xcite . the existence of ns have also been reported in the superconducting insb nanowire @ xcite , @ xmath3 @ xcite and topological phase josephson junction @ xcite . to have a fully manipulated experimental model for tqc , both experimental models and theoretical models are both highly desirable . in this paper , we place the topological phase and topological phase at the edge and in the central core of the @xmath0 - the dresselhaus ( 110 ) spin - orbit ( so ) coupled ncs . it is found that the asymmetric ##al correspondence plays a key role in the different states in the model . although the rashba so coupled model has been extensively investigated @ xcite , the dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupled ncs is relatively less discussed than @ xcite . interestingly , we find that there is a novel semimetal phase in the dresselhaus region , where the band gap disappears in the open region and different types of flat andreev flat states ( so ) emerge . we demonstrate that these flat states support the emergence of mfs explicitly and numerically . it is found that the chern effect is not a well - defined topological invariant in the gapless region , however , we find that the topologically different semimetal states in this gapless region can still be distinguished by the pfaffian symmetry of the particle - wave interaction hamiltonian . several authors have proposed the flat states for the ncs @ xmath4 with high - spin , @ xcite , @ xmath5 - wave superconductor , @ xmath6 - wave superconductorand @ xmath7 - wave superconductor @ xcite . instead , our proposal for modeling the flat abss is an @ xmath0 - wave dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupled but in an in - plane magnetic field which is more flexible than the other proposals where one has to apply a magnetic field in the @ xmath8 direction to the materials @ xcite . our model is much more flexible . the flat dispersion causes a peak in the density of materials ( dos ) which is clearly visible and leaves an obvious gap in the electrical conductance of @ xcite . the zero - bias conductance peak has been observed in the experiments with the insb nanowire @ xcite and @ xmath3 @ xcite and argued to be due to the flat abs . even if the majorana effect occurs in the dresselhaus model , the flat abs and the zero - bias current peak in the dos predicted here should be ignored . the model is organized as follows . the model for @ xmath0 - wave ncs with dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupled is given in ref . [ model ] . the phase diagrams and topological invariants of this model are discussed in2 . the numerical and analytical solutions to the spin particles at the edge of the vortex are given in sec . [ mfatedge ] . the spin particles at the vortex core of the system are numerically solved in sec . [ mfinvortex ] . finally , we have a brief summary in sec . [ summary ] . we begin with modeling the hamiltonian of a square wave for the two particle @ xmath0 - wave system with dresselhaus ( 110 ) so interaction with the in - plane magnetic field , which is given by @ xmath9 : @ xmath10 , \ \ \ end { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath11 is the splitting ( hopping ) term of the field with components @ xmath12 and coupling @ xmath13 . @ xmath14 is the hopping term with hopping potential @ xmath15 and splitting potential @ xmath16 . @ xmath17 is the zeeman potential generated by the in - plane magnetic field with components @ xmath18 . @ xmath19 is the dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupling and @ xmath20 is the @ xmath0 - wave super##conducting term with wave function @ xmath21 . we use @ xmath22 in this section . in the momentum space , the hamiltonian is @ xmath23 with @ xmath24 , where @ xmath25 , @ xmath26 is the spin operator in the de brillouin notation and the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian is @ xmath27 where @ xmath28 , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 are the spin operators acting in the four - momentum space and position space , respectively . the nontrivial topological nature of the dresselhaus ncs is demonstrated by the existence of gapless ground state and a boundary . now we shall demonstrate these results in the hamiltonian e . ( [ eq1 ] ) . for example , we shall first describe the experimental results of the @ xmath0 - 2 rashba experiment , in which the dresselhaus ( 110 ) - coupling @ xmath19 to the hamiltonian eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) was replaced by the rashba so [ @ xmath31 $ ] and the two - plane magnetic couplingis given by the perpendicular gauge field @ xcite . as usual , we shall use the chern number to characterize the nontrivial phase space structure of the rashba ncs . the chern number defined for the energy gapped hamiltonian is @ xmath32 , where @ xmath33 is the direction of the gauge field @ xmath34 , where @ xmath35 are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian . the integral is carried out for the first brillouin zone and the summation is carried out for the second zone . as long as the topological quantum transition does not happen , the chern number remains unchanged . since the topological quantum transition happens when the energy gap closes , the phase diagram can be constructed by using the gap - closing condition of the hamiltonian . in the phase diagram of the rashba , as shown in the figure . ( [ fig1 ] a ) , we find that the gap closes in some direction and the chern number is equal to the line of the phase diagram . however , in the general case , we shall find that the phase diagram of the dresselhaus model has a gapless region that makes the chern number well - defined . to see this , we needthe bdg hamiltonian is . ( [ eq2 ] ) with the following boundary conditions of the @ xmath36 and @ xmath8 regions , then the energy spectrum is @ xmath37 , where @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 . next , we can find that the energy spectrum closes at @ xmath40 which leads to the following gap - closing conditions : @ xmath41 , @ xmath42 . after some more calculations , we find that when @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 ; when @ xmath45 , @ xmath46 . finally , the gap closes at @ xmath47 , @ xmath48 leading to @ xmath49 . finally , we can find that the gap closes in the direction from a to b as shown in the figure . ( [ fig1 ] . ) . the number of gap - closing points at @ xmath43 , @ xmath50 and @ xmath45 , @ xmath51 is also denoted by , and @ xmath52 . later we shall find a relation between the number of gap - closing points in the first brillouin region and the gauge theory ofthe hamiltonian . interestingly , starting from the phase diagram of the rashba ncs in the fig . ( [ fig1 ] a ) , where the molecule closes at the boundary , and the boundary region between them has a distinct chern number , the phase diagram of the dresselhaus ncs has a gapless region from e to f , shown in the fig . ( [ fig1 ] b ) , which means that the molecule is in the semimetal phase of the whole region . for the gapless region , it is well known that the chern number is also well - known . however , the other three invariants which are obtained from the analysis of the hamiltonian can also be used to describe the three distinct semimetal phases of the gapless region . for the hamiltonian fig . ( [ eq2 ] ) , we enumerate several symmetries as follows : ( i ) particle - hole symmetry , @ xmath53 ; ( ii ) partial particle - hole symmetry , @ xmath54 and ( iii ) chiral symmetry , @ xmath55 , where @ xmath56 , @ xmath57 and @ xmath58 is the lie algebra operator . wewe write the pfaffian invariant @ xcite for the particle - hole symmetric hamiltonian as @ xmath59 \ text { pf } [ \ mathcal { h } ( \ mathbf { k _ { 1 } } ) \ sigma _ { x } ] } { \ text { pf } [ \ mathcal { h } ( \ mathbf { k _ { 1 } } ) \ sigma _ { x } ] \ text { pf } [ \ mathcal { h } ( \ mathbf { k _ { y } } ) \ sigma _ { x } ] } \ right \ } , \ end { split } \ ] ] where @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 , @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 are the three particle - hole symmetric systems in the first brillouin plane of the crystal lattice . similarly , the pfaffian invariant @ xcite for the two particle - hole symmetric system is @ xmath64 } { \ text { pf } [ \ mathcal { h } ( x , k _ { y } ) \ sigma _ { x } ] } \ right \ } . \ end { split } \ ] ] forthe chiral case , if we use the basis where @ xmath65 is diagonal , @ xmath66 , then the hamiltonian is off - diagonal , @ xmath67 . from this @ xmath68 , we can define the quantum number @ xcite ##s @ xmath69 . \ end { 1 } \ ] ] the pfaffian lattice @ xmath70 can be used for identifying the equivalent semimetal phases of the hamiltonian g . ( [ eq2 ] ) . it is necessary to assume that @ xmath71 and @ xmath72 . the phase diagrams of the dresselhaus lattice are shown in the fig . ( [ fig1 ] below ) . therefore , the semimetal phases of the regions of a , b , c , d and the regions of e , f , g are not inequivalent . as for the first two lattice ##s @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 , then we shall show that they can be used to determine the range of spin states in the full brillouin model . - see ( a ) rashba and ( b ) dresselhaus ncs . thethese are @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 . in ( b ) , @ xmath77 . the chern number in different regions is indicated in ( c ) . the number of non - closed states of @ xmath43 , @ xmath50 and @ xmath45 , @ xmath51 in different regions are also indicated as a [ @ xmath78 . ( b ) . , width = 302 ] to understand the novel situation in the semimetal phase of the dresselhaus nc , we study the andreev spin states and majorana fermions at the edges and in the central region of g . we will first try to study the dynamics of the dresselhaus ncs . by setting the boundary conditions of @ xmath36 ##0 to be open and @ xmath8 to be closed , we obtain the hamiltonian fig . ( [ eq2 ] ) in the rotational phase and in the boundary condition of the hamiltonian . however , although the gap exists in the semimetal phase from region a to g as shown in the fig . ( [ fig1 ] . ) , there exist dispersionless abss at the edge ofthe fig . the two slightly different semimetal phases in the region a and b are depicted in the fig . ( [ fig2 ] a ) and ( [ fig2 ] b ) , respectively . we would like to study the number and position of the flat abs in these two different semimetal phases . by the pfaffian invariant fig . ( [ pfky ] ) and winding number eq . ( [ wky ] ) , the region where the flat abs exist in the first brillouin zone can be roughly described as shown in the fig . ( [ fig2 ] c ) and ( [ fig2 ] d ) . the number of flat abss is independent of the number of gap - closing points in the first brillouin zone . from the hamiltonian in the chiral plane , we can see that the gap exists when @ xmath79 . in the complex plane of @ xmath80 , the winding number can be related to the gap - closing points @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 , where @ xmath83 is the contour of the gap - closing point . due to the particle - lattice symmetry , we see that @ xmat##h84 , therefore , the gap - closing points with opposite winding ##s are equal winding number . the points @ xmath85 in the regions f and e are shown in the fig . ( [ fig2 ] e ) and ( [ fig2 ] f ) . as long as the set of opposite winding and gap - closing points does not completely lie in the edge brillouin region , there will be flat abs between them @ xcite . therefore , the number of flat abs is @ xmath86 and it is easy to see that @ xmath70 is the projection of @ xmath87 , @ xmath88 . the magnetic properties of these two flat semimetal types are shown in the fig . ( [ fig2 ] g ) and ( [ fig2 ] h ) . we know that there is a region of high energy which is not visible in the tunnel ##ing ##1 . therefore , all of these flat abss have an experimental value in the tunneling conductance , and the two ##s at the center of the dresselhaus region should be experimentally observable . as for the robustness of the flat abss against disorder or noise , we can discuss it from the2 point of view . as long as the molecule or molecule does not violate the symmetry of hamiltonian eq . ( [ eq2 ] ) , these flat states can be protected by the same topological disorder as before . [ cols = " ^ " , ] in addition , we have observed the topological disorder and the disorder in the @ xmath0 - wave dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupled ncs . we find that there is a gapless region , in the phase diagram of the dresselhaus system . we observe that there exist two andreev bound states which contain majorana fermions in the gapless region . the binary compound insb has the symmetry dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupled @ xcite which makes it promising to observe the disorder on the surface or in the inner core of the system . we can use an insb ( 110 ) quantum dot , in combination with an @ xmath0 - wave superconducting , and couple it to an in - plane magnetic field . thus we can use the tunneling conductance measurements to measure the zero - point magnetic peak of the system . 34ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx # 1 ifnum[ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ` ` ` ` # ` ' ' ' ' @ noop [ 1 ] secondoftwosanitize @ link [ 1 ] + 12 $ 12 & # # 1212 _ _ % % @ startlink [ 1 ] @ endlink [ 1 ] @ link @ innerbibempty @ noop _ _ ( , ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 95 . 405 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 95 . 2015 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 95 . 106802 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1143 / jpsj . 96 . 031007 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 95 . 226801 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 95 . 146802 [ * * , () ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 78 . 106803 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 80 . 10267 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 100 . 134521 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop * * , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 100 . 096407 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 98 . 177002 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1016 / s0003 - 4916 ( 02 ) 00018 - 0 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 107005 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop * * , ( ) @ noop * * , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 98 . 125318 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10. 1103 / physrevb . 107 . 161108 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop * * , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 107 . 217001 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 109 . 056803 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 104 . 040502 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 83 . 060504 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 83 . 020501 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 83 . 224511 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 83 . 097002 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 83 . 184525 [ * * , ( ) ]link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 109 . 150408 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 86 . 094512 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 86 . 094504 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1016 / 0031 - 9163 ( 84 ) 90375 - 0 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 86 . 155327 [ * * , ( ) ]
