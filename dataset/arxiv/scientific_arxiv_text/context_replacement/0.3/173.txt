recently a new method for analyzing multifractal functions @ xmath1 was developed @ xcite . it exploits the fact that the fractional tail of order @ xmath2 ( denoted here by @ xmath3 ) of @ xmath1 is , for a suitable range of @ xmath2 , the power - law tail in its cumulative distribution @ xmath4 the exponent @ xmath5 is the maximum solution of the equation @ xmath6 where @ xmath7 is the maximum value corresponding to the value at small scales @ xmath8 of the random function of order @ xmath9 , i . e . @ xmath10 . it was also shown that the local observability of the power - law tail when multifractality is restricted to a finite number of scales is determined by how much @ xmath7 differs from the ##ity on @ xmath9 . the greater this departure the easier it is to analyze multifractality . so far the behavior of the power - law tails has been studied especially for synthetic random functions , in particular the random multiplicative functions @ xcite for which kesten - type functions @ xcite and @instead of can be used . it is our purpose here to apply the partial derivative method for invariant measures of dissipative quantum states , in particular for the feigenbaum invariant measure which occurs at the accumulation point of the orbit doubling , where the orbit has disappeared @ xmath11 @ xcite . this multifractality is proved rigorously for a . @ xcite using the thermodynamic formalism . for the feigenbaum measure the scaling exponents can be determined with different means . there is an important difference in the way one uses functions and invariant measures to determine their multifractal properties and in particular the spectrum of singularities , usually using @ xmath12 for measures @ xcite and @ xmath0 for measures @ xcite . for a measure @ xmath1 one uses the moments of the pdfs of the increments @ xmath13 to determine the scaling factor , whereas for an invariant measure @ xmath14 one starts with distributions of points or regions of different sizes . in the one - dimensional case the two methods are equivalent , using the cumulative distribution function @ xmath15 hence we shall apply the partial derivative method to the integral of theinvariant measure . the structure of the sections is the same . section [ s : thermo ] is dedicated to the statistical theory for the feigenbaum distribution . in section [ ss : dynamics ] , we recall the methods used in ref . @ xcite . in section [ s : connection ] we note how this formalism , focused on the analysis of the statistical properties of the distribution , is actually connected to the standard multifractal formalism which focusses on the statistical properties of the invariant measure @ xcite . to the best of our knowledge the exact relation between the two concepts is discussed here for the first time . then , in section [ s : numericalfreeenergy ] we calculate numerically the free energy and accordingly the scaling exponents @ xmath7 for the distribution of the invariant measure ; this is done by a very accurate density - matrix - based method . partial derivatives are discussed in section [ s : fraclap ] . in section [ s : fraclap _ pheno ] we also discuss the phenomenology of power - law tails in the distribution of partial derivatives and the limits of observability . the partial derivative distribution of the feigenbaumit is defined in section [ ss : fraclap _ numerics ] . concluding remarks are made in section [ s : concl ] . in this section we give a brief description of the thermodynamic basis for the invariant ##s of the feigenbaum map ( see ref . @ xcite for the more details ) and show how one can use it in order to understand the multifractal nature of the hlder ##s . the feigenbaum map we understand the attractor of the n - dimensional space @ xmath16 \ to [ 0 , 1 ] $ ] , where @ xmath17 is the solution of the feigenbaum cvitanovi differential equation : @ xmath18 [ ( [ g ] ) ] said to have the unique solution in the category of smooth unimodal maps ( that is , maps having a fixed point ) with a non - singular solution . this solution is called the feigenbaum map . it is holomorphic in a complex neighborhood of @ xmath19 $ ] and the first few terms of the taylor series expansion of @ xcite @ xmath20 the value of the universal constant @ xmath21 which is the inverse ofthe feigenbaum scaling of @ xmath22 is also equal to @ xmath23 . an expression @ xmath24 for the function @ xmath25 can be expressed in the following way . for example @ xmath26 , the sequence of intervals of @ xmath27th level : @ xmath28 , \ nonumber \ \ & & \ delta ^ { ( n ) } _ 0 = i ^ { ( n ) } ( \ delta ^ { ( n ) } _ 0 ) \ equiv \ underbrace { { \ circ { \ circ \ cdots \ circ } } _ { i } ( \ delta _ i ^ { ( n ) } ) \ left ( i \ leq 1 \ leq 1 ^ { - 1 ) . \ pi { n } \ pi { n } \ ] ] the following solutions of the map @ xmath29 are the solutions of the doubling problem ( [ 1 ] ) : ( a ) @ @ xmath30 is pairwise disjoint .

[ ref : feigen - zetap ] ( a ) . the exponents @ xmath7 are then obtained by a least squares fit of the structure functions over the range @ xmath220 . with this range of values , the values of thefit seems to gradually deteriorate for @ xmath221 , but otherwise there is rather good agreement between the two methods of determining @ xmath7 . note that the ` ` @ xmath222 - 1 ' ' of the complement of @ xmath7 , namely @ xmath223 , which is the codimension of the graph of the corresponding measure @ xmath224 , is positive and its absolute value is slightly over one for @ xcite . this will prove important in the future . in this case we will take the phenomenological approach to multifractality via fractional derivatives @ xcite and extend it to a multifractal manifold . we therefore start , not with the measure @ xmath224 itself , but with its complement @ xmath1 . the measure @ xmath22 can be defined as the hlder ##s of @ xmath1 , i . e . , @ xmath225 for @ xmath226 . we proceed to fractional derivatives of measure @ xmath2 defined , as in fig . @ xcite , by the multiplication of the tangent space by @ xmath227 by@ xmath228 ( see ref . @ xcite for the definition ) . an isolated non - zero function with exponent @ xmath22 at a point @ xmath90 if @ xmath229 if @ xmath230 , then we shall have if , the exponent is negative , the partial derivative must be very large and this leads to the pseudo - definition of the function . a key assumption of the proof is that this argument can be generalized over to non - compact multifractal spaces , provided we take certain types of singularities into account . for the feigenbaum invariant ##s , we know the hausdorff measure @ xmath120 of the set of points of a function with exponent @ xmath22 . assuming that we can also use @ xmath120 as a second dimension , we can express the probability to find a function of order @ xmath22 with a fractional derivative of order @ xmath2 which exceeds ( in absolute value ) a very large value @ xmath231 , that is we define @ xmath232 in terms of the codimens##ion of the set @ xmath233 , the sequence to occur ( [ e : y - x ] ) is written as @ xmath234 here @ xmath235 is the second relation ( @ xmath236 ) . taking now into account the sequence with the negative values @ xmath22 , the tail of the conditional probability of the probability distribution of an @ xmath2 is given , to the second order , by the following power law @ xmath237 an exact calculation shows that @ xmath156 corresponding to the infimum of ( [ x : inf ] ) gives @ xmath238 which also gives @ xmath239 . on the other hand , we get that @ xmath240 here the infimum is given by an @ xmath22 with the exact second relation @ xmath239 . similarly , @ xmath241 = ( [ alpha _ star ] ) , we get @ xmath242 where the second relation follows from @ xmath239 . the correct interpretation of this equation is that the ( negative ) value of the power - law tail for the fraction##al ##bedo of order @ xmath2 is the @ xmath9 - value of the intersection of the line of @ xmath7 and of a straight line of order @ xmath2 through the origin . as shown in ref . @ xcite , in the presence of the full range of scaling , the power - law product ( [ x : cprob ] ) holds only if the multifractality is sufficiently strong . this strength is measured by the multifractality parameter @ xmath243 , a measure of how strongly the results depart from the very similar ( which would be @ xmath244 ) : @ xmath245 where @ xmath246 . it was shown that observability of the power - law requires a sufficiently large value for the product @ xmath247 , where @ xmath56 is the number of octaves in which the data has multifractal tails . in addition it was shown in ref . @ xcite that @ xmath248 for example , well - developed radial velocity models @ xcite have large @ xmath249 values of the product of @ xmath250 , thus requiring a monstrous inertial frameof about 300 , for observability of power - law tails . as we shall see , the situation is much more favorable for the feigenbaum invariant ##s . now turning to numerical questions , we comment on an issue raised by an anonymous referee who worried about the nonlocal character of the partial derivative and say in general that our approach makes sense , strictly speaking , only for ( statistically ) translationally homogeneous phase space systems : however , if the system consists of components whose ` ` fractal dimensions ' ' are rather different the effect will be cancelled out . our feeling about these matters is generally as follows . first one may observe that , of course , the attractor for the feigenbaum invariant is initially homogeneous ( translation - invariant ) but after integration in it becomes increasingly homogeneous ; the partial derivative is not a local operator but the tail of the pdf is likely to be affected by strongly correlated components . second , a more interesting point . the method of the multi - fractal analysis is based on the fact that the dynamics of a system has a set of scales . it is important that these scales do not depend on a particular point in the phase space . on the contrary , they are independent and ` ` interact ' ' with each othereverywhere . in the case of the feigenbaum attractor the results depend on the symbolic interpretation of the set of partitions . in vector spaces , like vector spaces , the results are difficult to compute rigorously . however , the invariance with respect to the # ##time is still present and forms a basis for applicability of the multifractal method . the phenomenological results presented in the previous section suggest that we should include power - law tails in the conditional distribution for the value of @ xmath1 for all values @ xmath2 . analysis of 1 . [ 2 : feigen - zetap ] indicates that @ xmath2 should lie between the minimum slope of the graph and unity . the value @ xmath251 is of obviously not a fractional value but , as we shall note , it is associated with a power - law tail of order of one . . ( putting @ xmath252 into the correlation function @ xmath253 , we get @ xmath254 . ) ] the minimum value can be easily found . indeed , @ xmath80 takes maximum values when @ xmath66 is large negative . in this case the main contribution to @ x##math80comes from the unit length of the graph with the derivative of the values of @ xmath50 . 0 , @ xmath255 in the limit @ xmath256 . this gives the following lower bound of the scale factor : @ xmath257 we have already shown that , because the @ xmath7 graph does not pass through the boundary , different values can be determined for the multifractality parameter @ xmath243 . the different values of @ xmath249 , corresponding to values of @ xmath9 ranging from @ xmath258 to determined by values of @ xmath259 are given below : [ t : fzetap ] , together with the number @ xmath56 of scaling steps , determined by @ xmath260 ( ) .
