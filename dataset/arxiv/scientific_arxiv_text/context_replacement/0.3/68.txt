the open connectome project ( located at http : / / openconnecto . me ) aims to annotate all the features in a large volume of neural networks ##ulation , connect these features , and compute a high resolution wiring diagram of the brain , known as the connectome . it is hoped that such data will help elucidate the structure and function of the human brain . the aim of this project is to accurately annotate axoplasmic reticula , since it is very time consuming to re - annotate them . therefore , the objective is to provide an operating model with high precision , to provide robust contextual analysis . there has been very extensive experimental work towards this goal @ xcite . axoplasmic structures are found only in images , determining the structure of the surrounding structures and allowing for inference . the brain image we are working with was color corrected using time - domain image - stitching techniques @ xcite to provide visibility through the image . we use this data as the testbed for both our filters and the axoplasmic reticula . the bilateral filter @ xcite is a non - linear filter consisting of one large linear kernel @ xmath0 , which decayswith pixel distance , and a 1d gaussian : @ xmath1 , which varies with pixel distance : @ xmath2 _ 1 = \ frac { 1 } { i _ p } \ sum _ { q \ in s } g _ { \ sigma _ { r } } ( | | p - q | | ) g _ { \ sigma _ { r } } ( i _ p - i _ q ) w _ p , \ \ & \ hspace { 4mm } \ textrm { where } w _ p = \ sum _ { q \ in s } g _ { \ sum _ { r } } ( | | p - q | | ) g _ { \ sigma _ { r } } ( i _ p - i _ q ) \ hat { 0 } \ ] ] is the normalization factor . this filter preserves the image by averaging over neighboring pixels , preserving resolution , and consequently image quality , by not averaging over pixels with a brightness difference . using this filter produces something like axoplasmic distortion in our image . even with a normal gaussian in the image data , the bilateral filter causes significant image damage across pixels . we try to minimize this damage using lapla##cian ##2 . the laplacian filter computes the difference between the intensity at each pixel and the average intensity of its neighbors . therefore , comparing a laplacian filtered image to the original image results in an increase in intensity where the average intensity of the surrounding pixels is greater than that of the center pixel , an intensity drop where the average is greater , and a change in pixels of constant intensity . hence , we use the 3x3 laplacian filter to find edges around dark features such as axoplasmic reticula . we use a linear image growing algorithm on our filtered image to find and annotate axoplasmic 26 . 5 mm @ xmath3 26 . 5 mm @ xmath3 26 . 5 mm @ xmath3 26 . 5 mm @ xmath3 26 . 5 @ 26 . 5 . 5 reticula . we do this by iterating over the original image and looking for dark pixels , where a dark pixel is defined as a pixel with intensity less than a previously specified threshold . when a dark pixel is found , we check its sub - pixels to determine if the other pixels are also below the threshold . next , we check the pixels around these , and we do this until we find onlyhigh resolution pixels , or until we grow larger than the size of an axoplasmic cell . the thresholds we use for our algorithm are theoretically known and measured empirically . finally , we track our annotations through the volume to check their accuracy and identify axoplasmic objects that were present initially . for each slice , we traverse the volume and check if an axoplasmic reticulum is present in the same xy - space ( with some tolerance ) in either of the adjacent slices . if a previously annotated axoplasmic cell object is present , we confirm the previous results . next , the adjacent slice boundaries are checked for axoplasmic reticula with a less - than threshold , and new objects are added to the corresponding slice . if an axoplasmic reticulum object is found in either of the adjacent slices , then we find the data in the corresponding slice to be incorrect , and delete it . we have tested our algorithm on two samples from the kasthuri11 dataset , and quantitatively compared our results against the truth from a sample . our algorithm for axoplasmicfind objects with 87 % accuracy , and 52 % recall . these results are approximate since there is some ambiguity present among expert annotators . our new algorithm is designed to find transverally sliced axoplasmic neurons . in future work , we hope to extend our morphological region growing algorithm to also find sliced axoplasmic neurons , and to use a more robust tracking method such as kalman or particle filtering . additionally , our algorithm can be extended to detect other types of neural em ##cs , such as mitochondria , by modifying the morphological region growing algorithm .
