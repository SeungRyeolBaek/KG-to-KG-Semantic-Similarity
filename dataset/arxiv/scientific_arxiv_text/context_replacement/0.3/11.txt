biological aggregations such as fish colonies , bird colonies , bacterial colonies , and insect colonies @ xcite have characteristic morphologies determined by the individual organisms interacting with each other and with their environment . the _ endogenous _ interactions , _ i . e . _ , those between individuals , often involve organisms reacting to each other in an attractive or repulsive way @ xcite when they sense each other either directly by sound , sight , smell or touch , or indirectly via chemicals , hormones , or other stimuli . a typical model approach is to model an individual as a moving object whose behavior is determined by the ( interparticle ) attractive and repulsive forces @ xcite . in contrast , the _ environmental _ interactions involve an ' s reaction to the environment , for example in response to light , wind , a heat source , a light source , a sound source , or a predator . the interaction of endogenous and exogenous interactions can lead to characteristic equilibrium solutions ; these equilibrium solutions are the focus of our current study . more specifically , our motivation is rooted in our original modeling study of the desert desert species _ schistocerca gregaria _ @ xcite . in some _ ##izations of our model ( shown momentarily ) ,they self - organize into groups with a specific shape , forming a box - like structure with a dense group of individuals on the ground and a small group of individuals above ; see figure [ fig : locust ] ( bc ) . the two are separated by an unoccupied gap . with this , the swarm migrates with a rolling motion . individuals at the front of the swarm fly downwards and land on the ground . locusts on the ground , when overtaken by the flying swarm , fly upwards and rejoin the main swarm ; see figure [ fig : locust ] ( cd ) . the presence of an unoccupied gap and the rolling motion are found in real life swarms @ xcite . as we will show throughout this article , features of swarms such as individual concentrations and individual components ( that is , the number of individuals ) arise from properties of equilibria in a simple model of swarming . the model of @ xcite is [ eq : 1 ] @ xmath1 which describes @ xmath2 and corresponds with positions @ xmath3 . the rate of locust swarm migration is directly correlated with the direction of the wind @ xcite and shows a rolling motion inthe transverse component , in the model is two - dimensional , _ i . e . _ , @ xmath4 where the @ xmath5 axis is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the current and @ xmath6 has a different coordinate . as the movement of the particle is simply a function of position , the model describes mechanical forces . this so - called kinematic model is common in biological models , and we discuss it here in the [ sec : discretemodel ] . the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : locusts ] ) describes gravitational forces ; @ xmath7 measures the effect that insect @ xmath8 has on locust @ xmath9 . the first term of @ xmath7 describes gravity , which operates with force @ xmath10 over a length scale @ xmath11 and is necessary for movement . the second term is repulsive , and operates more slowly and over a larger length scale in order to prevent collisions . time and space are scaled so that the force strength and length scale are unity . the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : stars ] ) describes radiation , .downwards with strength @ xmath12 . the last term describes movement of particles in the absence of the wind with speed @ xmath13 . furthermore , the model describes a relatively flat ground . since locusts move and feed when grounded , their motion in that state is slow compared to their motion in the ground . now we return to ( [ fig : b ] ) the stipulation that only particles whose average velocity is assumed to be negative , ( [ fig : locusts ] ) are included . as mentioned above , for these parameters , ( [ eq : 1 ] ) describes a bubble - like structure . this can occur even in the presence of wind , that is , when @ xmath14 ; see also [ fig : locust ] ( 2 ) . the structure is stable , for it causes the swarm to roll in the presence of wind . as described in @ xcite , states which lack a bubble in the absence of wind do not migrate in the presence of wind . mechanisms for bubble formation , even in the equilibrium state described in the above model , have not been found ; we will address this here . some swarming models take a discrete approach . in our locust exampleand because of the ready access to biological systems . a further advantage is that analysis of swarm systems is easy , requiring only the solution of ordinary differential equations . however , since most swarms contain many individuals , the resulting high - dimensional system of differential equations can be difficult or impossible to solve . furthermore , for very large systems , computation , though possible , can be a bottleneck . continuum models are more suited to analysis . one well - known continuum model is that of @ xcite , a fully integrodifferential continuum model for the swarm interaction density @ xmath15 in one spatial dimension : @ xmath16 the density @ xmath17 obeys the conservation equation , and @ xmath18 is the density vector , which is determined via convolution with the antisymmetric pairwise endogenous force @ xmath19 , the one - dimensional analog of a conserved force like the one in ( [ eq : locusts ] ) . the continuum model ( [ ex : introeq ] ) displays at least three solution conditions as identified in @ xcite . populations can concentrate to a minimum , reach a near steady state , or disappear . in @ xcite , we identified constraints on the swarm interactionand @ xmath19 for each behavior to occur . these models lay out a ` ` phase diagram ' ' of free space into regions associated with each behavior . similar phase diagrams exist in the free particle model @ xcite and its cellular analog @ xcite . models that break the antisymmetry of @ xmath19 ( showing an asymmetric response of organisms to each other ) display more complicated phenomena , including swarm ##ing @ xcite . many studies have shown conditions under which the population concentrates to a given point . in a two - dimensional system , collapse occurs when the force @ xmath19 is finite and attractive at short distances @ xcite . the analogous process in three dimensions also leads to collapse @ xcite . one can also consider the case when the system has an extra term , the social force , @ xmath20 in this case , equilibrium solutions consisting of groups of point - masses can be linearly and nonlinearly stable , except for social forces @ xmath19 that are repulsive at long distances @ xcite . these conditions naturally lead to the question of whether a solution can be reached past the point at which a mass occurs . early work on a theoretical model of ( [ ref : .##eq ] ) suggests the answer is biological @ xcite . for ( [ e : introeq ] ) itself in one dimension , there is an effective theory for the time of interest @ xcite . most of the classical solutions discussed above are equilibrium solutions . however , there may exist classical equilibria as well . for most of biological @ xmath19 , the only classical steady states are infinite - mass , as shown via a variational solution of the steady state problem @ xcite . however , these solutions are non - biological , since they contain infinite mass . there may exist non - repulsive @ xmath19 which give rise to well - behaved classical steady states of infinite mass . for example , in simulations of ( [ eq : introeq ] ) , we find classical steady state solutions consisting of compactly supported swarms with jump discontinuities at the edges of the support @ xcite . in our own work , we can find solutions that contain both biological and nonclassical components . most of the solutions reviewed above were found by studying the underlying gradient flow theory of ( [ eq : introeq2 ] ) . there is an equilibrium solution @ xmath21 = \ frac{ 1 } { 2 } \ int _ \ mathbb { r } \ int _ \ mathbb { r } \ , ( x ) \ rho ( x ) [ ( x - y ) \ , dx \ , dy + \ int _ \ mathbb { r } f ( x ) \ , ( x ) \ , dx , \ ] ] which is invariant under the constraint . this energy can be interpreted as the time derivative of the summed pairwise derivative of the corresponding discrete ( particle ) energy @ xcite . we will then use this information to derive equilibrium solutions and measure their stability . in this section , we focus on equilibria of systems and ask the following questions : * what sorts of density distributions do these systems make ? are they homogeneous or nonclassical ? * how are the highest density distributions reached affected by external interactions , exogenous forces , boundaries , and the effects of these ? * how well do classical and quantum swarming systems approximate each other ? to answer these questions , we formulate a suitable mathematical framework for stable , continuous swarm members in one spatial domain , not subject to external forces . we will derive an appropriate continuum framework and use variational methods toseek minimizers of its density . this method involves solution of the fredholm ##ian equation for the density . for different types of endogenous density , we are able to find exact solutions . perhaps surprisingly , they are not purely classical . in particular , they can be @ xmath0 - the values of mass at the domain boundary . the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : classical ] , we create the basic framework for our study , and derive conditions for a particular density distribution to be an equilibrium state , and to be subject to various types of interactions . in sections [ sec : repulsive ] and [ sec : morse ] , we demonstrate different types of swarm equilibria via examples . in section [ sec : gravitational ] , we focus on the classical swarm problem . we consider a bounded domain with no gravitational forces , a bounded - domain subject to gravitational forces , and an unbounded domain subject to a purely exogenous force , modeling them to a physical , chemical , or nutrient source . for all three cases , we find exact solutions for swarm interactions . for the first two cases , these equilibria consist of a density distribution that is classical in theinterior of the domain , it contains @ xmath0 - functions at the edges . for the third example , the model is weakly supported with the density dropping discontinuously to zero at the edge of the domain . for all three examples , we apply analytical solutions from the same problem to solutions obtained from numerical simulation of the same discrete system . the two correspond closely even for small numbers of discrete system components . section [ sec : morse ] is similar to section [ sec : repulsive ] , but we now consider the more general case of endogenous interactions that are repulsive over short length scales and attractive over long scales ; such interactions are typical for swarming biological organisms . in section [ sec : locust - swarm ] , we revisit discrete systems , focusing on their swarm - like behavior as described above , and on the effects of dimensionality . in a one - dimensional model corresponding to a single slice of a large scale system under the influence of social interactions and forces , the minimizers can detect groups of locusts on the ground and a swarm of flies on the ground , but there can not be a correlation between the two groups . thus , a quasi - two - dimensional model accounting for the behavior of the swarmthe horizontal extent does , in fact , have minimizers which roughly correspond to the biological bubble - like swarms . consider @ xmath2 : interacting particles ( swarm ##s ) in one spatial dimension with mass @ xmath22 . assume that acceleration is governed by the second law , so that acceleration is proportional to the product of the drag and motive forces . we then focus on the case where the acceleration is negligible and the motive force is equal to the acceleration . this assumption is appropriate when drag forces dominate flow , commonly known in fluid dynamics as the low reynolds number or slow flow equation . in the scientific literature , the above equations , which are first - order in time , are known as _ kinematic and have been used in numerous studies of swarming and swarm behavior , ( @ xcite ) . we can introduce a general model with both endogenous and exogenous forces , as with the locust model ( [ see : locusts ] ) . the motive forces act on individuals and can influence social attraction and selection ; see @ xcite for a discussion . for simplicity , we assume that the motive forces act in an additive , pairwise manner . we also assume that the forces are symmetric ,that is , the force induced by particle @ xmath9 on particle @ xmath8 is the opposite of that induced by particle @ xmath8 on particle @ xmath9 . exogenous forces might include friction , friction , and force towards light or matter . the governing equations take the form [ q : discretesystem ] @ xmath23 eventually we will examine the governing equations for a continuum version of the same problem . to this end , we have defined a _ _ mass _ @ xmath24 which scales the magnitude of the individual forces so as to remain constant for @ xmath25 . @ xmath26 is the total social mass of the ensemble . ( [ q : vee ] ) by the velocity equation ; @ xmath27 is the net velocity one force induces on another , and @ xmath28 is the exogenous velocity . from our definition of symmetry of the forces , @ xmath19 is positive and in most other cases is zero at the origin . each force , @ xmath28 and @ xmath19 , can be written as the inverse of another force under the relatively simple assumption of integ##rability . as pointed out in @ xcite , many of the specific solutions for mutual interaction forces proposed in the literature satisfy this requirement . other exogenous forces like gravity and some forms of friction do so as well . under this condition , we define ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) , the following equation , @ xmath29 where the potential @ xmath30 is [ eq : discrete _ gradient ] @ xmath31 the double sum describes the intrinsic forces and the single sum describes the exogenous forces . thus , @ xmath32 is the mutual interaction force , which is zero , and @ xmath33 is the exogenous potential . the flow described by ( [ eq : discretegradient1 ] ) will evolve towards minimizers of the potential @ xmath30 . up to now , we have solved the equation on @ xmath34 . in order to confine the problem to a particular potential @ xmath35 , we may use the technique of letting the exogenous forces @ xmath33 tend to depend on the complement of @ xmath35 . while this general approach is useful from a modeling and simulation perspective , itis easy to solve . first , we can derive the continuum model of ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) . this continuum model will allow us to find boundary conditions and determine their dynamics via the calculus of variations and integral equation above . to derive the continuum model , we start by describing our evolving system of n particles with a density function @ xmath15 equal to the sum of @ xmath0 - functions . ( for simplicity , we use the @ xmath36 expression of @ xmath17 in the following section . ) our approach here is similar to @ xcite . these @ xmath0 - functions have strength @ xmath24 and are evaluated at the positions of the particles : @ xmath37 the total density is @ xmath38 where @ xmath39 is the size of the problem . using ( [ q : deltafuncs ] ) , we write the discrete velocity @ xmath40 in terms of the continuous velocity @ xmath41 . that is , we have @ xmath42 where @ xmath43 by conservation of mass , the density obeys @ xmath44 with no mass conserved at the origin . we now have an energy functional@ xmath45 $ ] which is equivalent to the discrete potential @ xmath30 $ ( [ cf : delta _ z ] ) : @ xmath46 = \ frac { 1 } { 0 } \ int _ { { \ omega } } \ int _ { { \ omega } } \ f ( x ) \ , ( x ) ^ ( x - 1 ) \ , dx \ , \ + \ int _ { { \ omega } } f ( x ) \ , ( x ) \ , dx . \ ] ] this equation follows from the discrete potential , @ xmath21 = [ { { \ cal { 2 } } } ( x _ 1 , \ ldots , x _ 2 ) , \ ] ] from the @ xmath0 - 1 value of the equation ( [ cf : deltafuncs ] ) . the coefficient of mass transfer is @ xmath47 } { dt } = - \ int _ \ { \ f ( x ) \ , \ { f ( x ) \ right \ } ^ { \ , dx , \ ] ] where we assume that there is no mass transfer on the surface of @ xmath35 .a consequence of this boundary condition is that under these conditions , mass will concentrate on the boundary of the system , and we can now solve this problem . since mass is conserved , we conclude that stable equilibria correspond to minimizers of @ xmath48 . note now that the energy ( [ q : continuum _ energy ] ) is defined for _ _ _ - function @ xmath17 , and for any of @ xmath0 - functions . we now consider minimizers for the continuous distribution ( [ q : continuum _ energy ] ) and show that they approximate solutions to the same problem in the limit of large @ xmath2 . to find a connection between the two cases , consider the continuous distribution @ xmath49 with constant support @ xmath26 . consider the cumulative density function @ xmath50 where the radial coordinate @ xmath51 is located to the left of the center of @ xmath49 . we seek a good approximation of @ xmath2 @ xmath0 - functions , @ xmath52 the corresponding cumulative density function @ xmath53 , @ xmath54 & x = x _ i , \ , i = \ , \ ldots , \ \\ , \ & x _ i < x < x _ { i + 1 } , \ & n = 1 , \ ldots , n - 1 \ \ \ & n > x _ i , \ pi { n } \ ] ] where we have used the convention that integrating up to a @ xmath0 - function is half the result of integrating down it . to establish our hypothesis , we require that @ xmath55 , which in turn gives the cluster positions @ xmath22 . for @ xmath25 for fixed @ xmath26 , this step function @ xmath53 converges uniformly to @ xmath56 . the algorithm goes in the opposite direction as above . we can start with an array of @ xmath0 - functions @ xmath57 directed at the center of the swarm ##s , as shown in [ [ x : x _ 1 ] ( x ) . we can compute the corresponding cumulative density @ xmath53 via ( [ eq : psid ] ) and then to construct the corresponding cumulative density @ xmath56 . the distributions @ xmath53 and @ xmath56 are given by the red line step function and the green curve , respectively ,see figure [ fig : delta _ model ] ( c ) . we may also attempt to find an approximation @ xmath49 , as shown in figure [ fig : delta _ model ] ( c ) . we use this technique in sections [ sec : repulsive ] and [ sec : non - ##ulsive ] to compare the simulations for the continuous system ( [ fig : pde ] ) with the simulations of the discrete system ( [ fig : discretesystem ] ) . we end this subsection by reiterating that we have made a distinction between the discrete and continuum systems . we use the continuous system to find the solutions analytically via variational and integral equation solving . the example below is a direct comparison to the results of the discrete system . we use a variational calculation to determine conditions for the density function to be a minimizer of @ xmath48 . our starting point is the energy functional ( [ fig : continuum _ energy ] ) corresponding to the mass constraint ( [ fig : mass _ energy ] ) . for @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 is an equilibrium solution of and @ xmath26 and @ xmath60 is a small solution of zero mass ,if we write @ xmath61 inspired by biological models of evolution , we focus on support with finite extent and assume the support of @ xmath59 to be a finite multiple of the support @ xmath35 . we refer to the support of @ xmath59 as @ xmath62 . this fact , combined with the fact that the support is finite , allows the support @ xmath63 to be linear on @ xmath64 , the support of @ xmath62 . we write @ xmath65 = [ [ { { \ bar \ bar } } ] + \ epsilon w _ 1 [ { { \ bar \ bar } } , { { \ bar \ bar } } ] + \ epsilon ^ 2 w _ 2 [ { { \ tilde \ rho } } , { { \ bar \ bar } } ] , \ ] ] where @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 are the first and second terms respectively . this formula is exact because @ xmath48 is linear on @ xmath17 ( see ref . [ 1 : w _ 1 ] ). we use these examples to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a given solution @ xmath59 to be a minimizer of @ xmath48 . our strategy is to consider two classes of solutions @ xmath63 . first , we consider those whose solution lies in @ xmath62 . in order for @ xmath59 to be extremal , @ xmath66 must exist . for it to be a minimizer , @ xmath67 must be finite . since ( [ x : expand _ w ] ) is exact , @ xmath68 implies that @ xmath59 has both a local and global minimum with respect to this first class of perturbations . the second class of perturbations we consider ( of which the first class is a subset ) consists of variations in the local domain @ xmath39 . as mentioned above , these perturbations must be nonnegative in @ xmath64 in order to maintain positivity of @ xmath17 . the necessary condition for @ xmath59 to be a local minimizer is that @ xmath69 for this class of .##s . if the addition @ xmath67 is valid for this particular set of functions , then @ xmath59 is a global minimizer as well . we obtain the first variation @ xmath66 by transforming ( [ eq : expand _ q ] ) into ( [ q : expand _ p ] ) and expanding to first order in @ xmath70 , which yields @ xmath71 = \ int _ \ omega { { \ tilde \ right } } \ , [ \ int _ \ omega { ( x - 1 ) { { \ bar \ right } } ( x ) \ , x + f ( x ) \ , ] \ , dx . \ ] ] , the first variation of perturbations , whose support is in @ xmath62 . since the perturbation @ xmath63 is arbitrary and of zero mass , for the first variation @ xmath66 to hold , it must be known that @ xmath72 the same result can be found using the lagrange multiplier , using the zero mass as a support . the result @ xmath73 has a physical form ; it isthe greater per test mass an average test subject would be due to the energy density and the interaction with @ xmath59 . finally , , we have shown that the necessary condition for @ xmath59 to be an optimal solution is that it satisfy the fredholm integral equation of the first kind for the nonnegative function @ xmath59 , @ xmath74 = \ , - f ( x ) , \ , { \ cal ##c } [ { { \ bar \ rho } } ( y ) ] \ equiv \ int _ { { \ int _ { { { \ bar \ lambda } } } } } { ( x - f ) { { \ bar \ lambda } } ( x ) \ , \ , \ , { f : fie } \ ] ] as well as the mass function ( [ f : mass1 ] ) . in order for @ xmath59 to be a minimizer with respect to the first variation of f , the second variation must be zero . transforming ( [ w : expand _ w ] ) into ( [ w : expand _ w ] ) yields @ xmath75 = \ int _ { {\ int _ { { { \ bar \ bar } } } } } \ int _ { { { \ omega _ { { { \ bar \ bar } } } } } } q ( x - y ) { { \ bar \ bar } } ( x ) { { \ bar \ bar } } ( y ) \ , dx \ , \ . \ ] ] the performance of @ xmath67 can be improved in a number of ways . we can set a sufficient bound on the fourier transform of @ xmath32 for @ xmath67 to be valid for the following types of applications . for the fourier transform @ xmath76 ##7 we define @ xmath77 & = & \ int _ { { \ omega _ { { { \ bar \ bar } } } } } \ int _ { { { \ omega _ { { { \ bar \ bar } } } } } } q ( x - y ) { { \ bar \ bar } } ( x ) { { \ bar \ bar } } ( y ) \ , dx \ , \ , \ \ & = & \ int _ { -\ infty } ^ { \ infty } \ int _ { - \ infty } ^ { \ infty } | ( x - y ) { { \ left \ right } } ( x ) { { \ left \ right } } ( x ) \ , dx \ , \ , \ \ & = & \ int _ { - \ infty } ^ { \ infty } { { \ left \ right } } ( x ) \ , [ f ( x ) * { { \ left \ left } } ( x ) \ , ] \ , dx , \ \ & = & \ frac { 1 } { - \ } } \ int _ { - \ infty } ^ { \ infty } | \ widehat { { { \ left \ left } } } ( x ) | ^ { \ widehat { - } ( x ) ~ dk . \ hat { - } \ ] ] we have used the fact that @ xmath63 is uniquely generated to extend the domain of f to k . we have also used the convergence theorem , parseval theorem ##1 , and the fact that@ xmath63 is stable . we note , however , that @ xmath78 is a sufficient condition for @ xmath68 ( as a nontrivial condition ) . as stated in @ xcite , this condition is roughly equivalent to that for the thermal stability of a finite temperature system in the absence of external forces . the necessary and sufficient condition for @ xmath68 for the second order of systems follows from considering the behavior of @ xmath79 and @ xmath62 . note that ( [ eq : 1 _ step ] ) may be written as @ xmath80 = \ int _ { { \ int _ { { { \ bar \ bar } } } } } { \ cal i } [ { { \ bar \ bar } } ] { { \ bar \ rho } } ( x ) \ , dx \ equiv \ langle { { \ tilde \ rho } } , { \ cal i } [ { { \ bar \ bar } } ] \ rangle , \ ] ] where the square brackets represent the [ @ xmath81 \ product of @ xmath6##2 . if the eigenvalues of the kernel of @ xmath79 are positive , then @ xmath68 ( again , a nontrivial extension ) . we then turn to the first family of perturbations , which have support in @ xmath39 and which are not in @ xmath64 . to find these extensions , we extend the definition of the constant @ xmath73 to the constant @ xmath82 that is constant for all of @ xmath35 . we define @ xmath83 directly from ( [ q : lagrange ] ) , @ xmath84 for @ xmath85 . we then define the first variation as @ xmath86 = \ int _ { { \ lambda } } { { \ lambda \ rho } } ( x ) \ lambda ( x ) \ , dx , \ ] ] directly from ( [ q : x _ derivative ] ) . given that @ xmath87 for @ xmath64 and that @ xmath63 has negative support in @ xmath39 , we find that the necessary and sufficient condition for @ xmat##h69 = @ xmath88 + @ xmath64 , that is @ xmath89 . , this means that a unit of mass transported from @ xmath62 to its destination is the total mass . if we allow for @ xmath59 to be a minimizer with respect to the first class of solutions , it works for @ xmath68 ( for example , by using @ xmath78 ) . however , this condition is not satisfied . the only condition is that @ xmath90 + w _ 2 [ { { \ center \ right } } , { { \ center \ rho } } ] > [ $ ] for nontrivial perturbations , which follows from ( [ f : w _ f ] ) being true . to prove , we have obtained the following constraints : * the solutions @ xmath59 satisfy the fredholm ##ian constraint ( [ f : fie ] ) and the density constraint ( [ f : mass1 ] ) . * the solution @ xmath59 is a local and global minimizer with respect to the first class of solutions ( those with solutions in @xmath62 ) if @ xmath67 in ( [ eq : first _ class ] ) is positive . * the solution @ xmath59 is a local minimizer with respect to the first ( in general finite - dimensional ) class of perturbations if @ xmath59 satisfies ( [ eq : second ] ) . if in addition @ xmath67 is positive for these perturbations , then @ xmath59 is a global minimizer as well . in practice , we use the integral equation ( [ eq : fie ] ) to find the solutions . then , we use @ xmath82 to determine whether @ xmath59 is a global minimizer . then , when possible , we show the value of @ xmath67 to determine that @ xmath59 is a global minimizer . as the continuum limit involves individual particles with different properties , we need to make sure the continuum limit has a consistent interpretation for the underlying system . if we think about using an atomic configuration , we find that we can define ` ` tunnel ' ' between different parts of the system . as such we use the concept of ' multi- component swarm equilibrium . suppose the swarm s ##ₙ can be divided into a set of @ xmath24 independent , closed , connected components @ xmath91 , that is @ xmath92 we define a swarm equilibrium as a configuration in which each individual swarm component is in equilibrium , @ xmath93 we can still define @ xmath82 in @ xmath39 @ xmath94 + f ( x ) = \ int _ { { \ int _ { { { \ bar \ } } } } } } q ( x - y ) { { \ bar \ rho } } ( x ) ~ dy + f ( x ) , \ ] ] . now @ xmath95 in @ xmath96 . we can still define a swarm minimizer . we say a swarm equilibrium is a swarm minimizer if @ xmath97 for some neighborhood of each component @ xmath96 of the swarm . in practice this means that the equilibrium is an energy minimizer for small amounts of energy in the neighborhood of each component . this might also be called a lagrangian minimizer in the sense that the equilibrium is a minimizerwith respect to the lagrangian deformations of the system . it is crucial to note that even if the solution @ xmath59 is a global minimizer , other multi - dimensional swarm minimizers may also exist . these solutions are local minimizers and consequently a global minimizer may not be a perfect solution under the assumptions of ( [ eq : pde ] ) . in this section we use the minimization techniques described in section [ 2 : formulation ] . it is helpful for practical purposes to make a concrete choice for the interaction potential @ xmath32 . as previously mentioned , for most physical , chemical , and biological systems , the pairwise potential @ xmath32 is zero . additionally , repulsion increases at short distances ( to describe attraction ) and the interaction potential approaches zero for very long distances . a simple choice for @ xmath32 is the interaction potential with strength chosen to describe long - range attraction and short - range attraction @ xcite . for the remainder of this section , we consider a simpler solution where @ xmath32 is the interaction potential @ xmath98 which represents repulsion with strength increasing as in space . when there is no interaction potential ,@ xmath99 , and when the domain is infinite , _ e . g . _ , @ xmath100 , the swarm will spread without bound . the solutions asymptotically approach the barenblatt solution to the porous diffusion equation as shown in @ xcite . however , when the domain @ xmath39 is infinite and when there is a limit to the exogenous potential , bounded swarms are observed both physically and numerically , as we will show . figure [ 1 : _ _ 1 ] shows solutions @ xmath101 for three cases : a finite domain with no exogenous potential , a bounded potential on a non - infinite domain , and a quadratic potential well in an infinite domain . in each case , a bounded swarm solution is observed but the solutions are not necessarily continuous and can even contain @ xmath0 - 1 values on the boundary . we discuss these three example cases in detail later in this article . first , we will consider the minimization problem for the case of the laplace potential . we will attempt to solve the problem as ; when the solution has compact support contained within the domain we find solutions that are not within the support and may have adiscontinuities at the boundary of the support . however , when the boundary of the support coincides with the boundary of the solution , the classical solution may break , and it is possible to find a new solution in the support . we will formulate explicit conditions for the solutions to be global minimizers . we will apply these results to the two solutions given above . recall that for @ xmath59 to be a classical solution , it must satisfy the integral condition ( [ theorem : fie ] ) subject to the second constraint ( [ eq : mass1 ] ) . for @ xmath101 to be a global minimizer , it must also satisfy ( [ theorem : variation ] ) , @ xmath102 finally , recall that for the solution @ xmath59 to be a global minimizer , the second constraint ( [ eq : second _ variation ] ) must be satisfied . we saw that if @ xmath78 , this is true . for ( [ theorem : variation ] ) , @ xmath103 and so for the rest of this section , we are able to ignore the existence of @ xmath67 . the local minimizer that we find to be a global minimize##r . then , for the purposes of this section , we turn our attention to cases where the support of the solution @ xmath62 is a closed loop in @ xmath39 ; in other words , the minimizing solution has a connected component . the reason that we are able to prove this result follows from the notion of swarm optimization , described above . in particular , we can show that there are no multi - component swarm minimizers for the action potential as long as the resulting solution @ xmath104 is connected , that is , @ xmath105 in @ xmath39 . to see this , suppose we have a swarm minimizer with only at least two connected components . consider @ xmath82 in the gap between the components so that @ xmath106 . we take @ xmath82 , to obtain @ xmath107 so that @ xmath108 is @ xmath109 . @ xmath64 . @ xmath105 by definition . therefore , @ xmath110 in @ xmath64 and so @ xmath82 is directed to in the gap . therefore , @ x##math111 at the end of the gap . we see from the above that @ xmath82 must be less than @ xmath112 near one of the nodes . this follows the principle of global optimization from the previous section , and therefore the solution is not a global minimizer . since swarm minimization is a necessary condition for global optimization , we now , as discussed , pay attention to single - component solutions . for example , consider the support of the [ @ xmath59 is @ xmath113 $ ] . we transform the integral equation ( [ q : fie ] ) for @ xmath59 into a differential equation by assuming that @ xmath114 is the q - function of the differential equation @ xmath115 , and that @ xmath116 , where @ xmath117 is the corresponding @ xmath0 - function . applying @ xmath118 to both sides of ( [ q : fie ] ) yields the dirac @ xmath0 - function of the integral . this and the sifting property of the @ xmath0 function apply to @ xmath119= \ frac { \ lambda } { 1 } - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ left [ f - f ' ' ( x ) \ right ] \ left { \ rm ##l } \ { { \ int _ { { { \ lambda \ right } } } } } . \ { { q : fie - sol } \ ] ] = ( [ q : fie - sol ] ) is a necessary condition for a solution @ xmath120 but not required . in fact , to obtain the exact solution ( [ q : fie - sol ] ) , we must convert it into the ordinary differential equation ( [ q : fie ] ) . we have @ xmath121 & \ equiv & \ int _ \ lambda } ^ { - | x - y | } \ left \ { \ frac { \ alpha } { 1 } - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ left [ f ( x ) - f ' ' ( x ) \ right ] \ right \ } \ , \ \ & = & \ alpha - f ( x ) + \ frac { f ^ { \ lambda - 1 } } { 2 } [ f ( \ lambda )- f ' ( \ alpha ) - \ lambda ] \ \ & & \ mbox { } + \ frac { f ^ { 1 - \ beta } } { \ } [ f ( \ alpha ) + f ' ( \ alpha ) - \ lambda ] , \ nonumber \ { { 1 } \ ] ] where the terms other than @ xmath122 must vanish for ( [ q : fie - 1 ] ) to obtain the solution . these null terms are denoted by @ xmath123 which is the null value of @ xmath124 . the constraint that these terms must vanish applies to the allowed @ xmath125 for each choice @ xmath104 , but these conditions will not be satisfied for the solutions of @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 . the allowed @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 both specify @ xmath73 which in turn specifies the mass @ xmath26 through ( [ q : mass1 ] ) . as we discussed above , the solution given above is usually , but not always , the local minimizer of the mass @ xmath48 . what we have discussed above is the local minimizeof the solution of ( [ eq : fie ] ) . the problem with this solution is that we know in the basis that for each interval @ xmath26 and interval @ xmath128 there should be a minimizer . it is easy to see that if @ xmath33 and @ xmath32 are bounded from above , the energy @ xmath48 is bounded from below too . if @ xmath129 comes directly from ( [ q : energy _ energy ] ) , @ xmath130 since @ xmath48 is bounded from below , solutions to the above problem occur in the space of real valued functions @ xcite . sometimes these solutions are not classical ; when there is finite attraction at small distances , we may rely on an @ xmath0 - function @ xcite . for the non - classical case of attraction at large scales , in free space and in the absence of an action potential , they are classical for all intervals @ xcite . we also know that ( under sufficient conditions ) an @ xmath0 - function can only occur in the interior of @ xmath62 . so we have restricted ourselves ( again ) to considering theby equation ( [ eq : 1 ] ) , this is true more generally . in fact , suppose that at a point @ xmath51 in the neighborhood of @ xmath39 , * the action potential @ xmath104 is twice - differentiable in a neighborhood of @ xmath51 , * @ xmath114 is twice - different for @ xmath131 , * @ xmath114 has nonzero repulsion at short range , that is , @ xmath132 is a minimizer does not contain an @ xmath0 - function at @ xmath133 . to see this , we can reduce the density of a density with an @ xmath0 - function at @ xmath133 to one where the @ xmath0 - function has been replaced by a single , constant mass top - down distribution @ xmath134 , @ xmath135 and assume that the density is equal to @ xmath136 . consider a density of with an @ xmath0 - function of mass @ xmath24 at @ xmath51 , @ xmath137 . define the density of[ @ xmath138 - function [ { { \ delta \ } } } _ 0 + m \ delta ( x - x _ 0 ) ] . \ ] ] , a calculation of ( [ q : energy _ e ] ) , @ xmath139 \ , dx \ , & \ nonumber \ \ & & \ mbox { } + m \ int _ { { \ delta } } ^ ( 0 ) \ left [ \ int _ \ varepsilon ( x - x _ 0 ) - \ delta ( x - x _ 0 ) \ } ] \ , dx . \ nonumber \ { { 0 } \ ] ] note that , @ xmath140 , @ xmath141 and @ xmath142 . compared to @ xmath143 , only the last term of ( [ q : nodeltas ] ) remains , yielding @ xmath144 for @ xmath145 , due to nonzero energy at large . , @ xmath146 , note that the energy is calculated by using the @ xmath0 - function with a simple pull - down . we see that @ xmath0 -they do not occur in the interior of @ xmath39 under the assumed conditions . however , the above result breaks down for @ xmath0 - functions in the interior of , where they may also be replaced by a new , linear push - down function . based on the result above , we introduce the classical solution @ xmath147 where @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 are to be determined . the classical solution @ xmath150 is identified with @ xmath0 - functions in the interior of @ xmath62 . we will show , in agreement with the calculation above , that @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 must vanish unless the boundary of the domain , @ xmath62 , intersects with the boundary of the domain , @ xmath39 . we obtain the corresponding classical solution ( [ f : fie - sol2 ] ) by entering it into the governing equation ( [ f : fie ] ) . we have @ xmath151 & \ equiv & \ int _ \ omega \ ^ { - | x - 1 | } \ to \ { { \ omega \ to ( x ) } +a \ delta ( x - \ alpha ) + b \ delta ( x - \ lambda ) \ { \ } \ , \ , \ \ & = & \ alpha - f ( x ) + \ frac { e ^ { \ alpha - 1 } } { 2 } [ 2a + f ( \ alpha ) - f ' ( \ alpha ) - \ lambda ] \ \ & & \ mbox { } + \ frac { e ^ { y - \ alpha } } { 2 } [ 2b + f ( \ alpha ) + f ' ( \ alpha ) - \ lambda ] , \ nonumber \ { { 1 } \ ] ] where the solutions other than @ xmath122 must satisfy for ( [ q : fie - sol2 ] ) to find the solution . this equation leads to the following solution : @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 , the lesser of the two solutions of the equation : @ xmath152 because @ xmath73 is unknown as of now , we can find a solution for the solution @ xmath26 . substitute the solution @ xmath101 into the above equation ( [ q : mass1 ]) . @ xmath153 , \ \ & = & \ lambda \ left ( x + \ frac { ( \ beta - \ alpha ) } { 2 } \ right ) - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ left [ f ( \ alpha ) + f ( \ beta ) + \ int _ { { \ int _ { { { \ lambda \ } } } } } } { ( x ) \ , dx \ } ] . \ left { 1 } \ ] ] . for @ xmath73 in terms of @ xmath26 and @ xmath154 we ve shown that for [ @ xmath113 $ ] and the mass @ xmath26 we can find the solution to ( [ f : fie ] ) with @ xmath101 concentrated at the interior and with no concentration at the exterior . however , we havent yet resolved the problem of @ xmath101 being non - zero , nor have we determined whether it is a minimizer . we now determine whether the extremal mass @ xmath59 is a minimizer , which starts the solution of ( [ f : stable2 ] ) . we have the differential equationso that allows us to take @ xmath82 and use the formula for @ xmath59 to be a minimizer . we start by using the linear combination @ xmath155 where @ xmath156 . applying these results to the interaction with @ xmath32 , we see that @ xmath157 takes @ xmath59 to ( [ e : fie - sol2 ] ) into our combination of @ xmath82 and ( [ e : stable2 ] ) yields @ xmath158 . consider moving @ xmath159 to ( [ e : ab ] ) at the time @ xmath5 becomes @ xmath62 . we see that @ xmath160 = { \ mathcal { 1 } ^ - } [ \ [ ] , \ ] ] where we ve ##rt the formula that @ xmath161 = @ xmath62 . if we take @ xmath162 and set @ xmath6 ##2 to zero , the last term disappears and @ xmath163 solving for @ xmath148 yields the other half of ( [ e : ab ]) . a similar check for @ xmath164 determines the support of @ xmath149 . since @ xmath126 does not coincide with the argument of @ xmath39 , we can consider the support @ xmath165 , which is to the left of the support @ xmath62 . again , setting @ xmath159 to ( [ eq : fie ] ) avoids the problem ; we first note that both the first term and the contribution from the @ xmath0 - term are given by this function , from which we see that @ xmath166 = 0 \ qquad \ rightarrow \ qquad [ ( x ) - \ alpha ( x ) = x ^ { , \ ] ] where @ xmath167 is an arbitrary constant . a similar check shows that if @ xmath104 is continuous , then @ xmath82 is continuous with the argument of @ xmath62 so that @ xmath168 . this in turn yields @ xmath167 , yielding @ xmath169e ^ { x - \ alpha } \ qquad{ \ rm for } \ quad x \ leq \ alpha . \ ] ] a similar result for @ xmath164 [ @ xmath170e ^ { \ alpha - 1 } \ qquad { \ rm for } \ quad x \ geq \ alpha . \ ] ] as mentioned in [ [ sec : minimizers ] , for @ xmath101 to be a minimizer we check for @ xmath88 for @ xmath171 and @ xmath172 . a further analysis shows that this is equivalent to [ sec : mincon ] @ xmath173 if @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 are not strictly related @ xmath39 , then ( [ sec : mincon ] ) constitutes necessary condition for the extremal support @ xmath59 to be a local minimizer ( note that @ xmath68 ) . we may also apply the same condition at the end of the support from ( [ sec : mincon ] ) . if @ xmath5 belongs to @ xmath126 , we may apply lhpital ##l ##hp and this condition is equivalent to the above @ xmat##h174 , as above . a similar result letting @ xmath5 converge to @ xmath127 shows that @ xmath175 . however , since @ xmath59 has a boundary , we are looking for different values . thus , either @ xmath176 or @ xmath126 coincide with the left edge of @ xmath39 . similarly , either @ xmath177 or @ xmath127 coincide with the right edge of @ xmath39 . this is consistent with the result ( [ eq : nodeltas2 ] ) which showed that @ xmath0 - functions can only occur in the support of @ xmath39 . in general , we come to two conclusions : * a globally optimal solution @ xmath59 contains an @ xmath0 - function only if the boundary of the support of the solution coincides with a boundary of the support . * a globally minimizing solution @ xmath59 must satisfy ( [ q : mincon ] ) . we now consider two different solutions for @ xmath39 and @ xmath104 . we consider a two - dimensional linear system with repulsive andis described by the action equation . we start with the simplest possible solution , namely an isolated system , @ xmath178 and a connected domain which for convenience we take to be the [ interval @ xmath179 $ ] . from @ xmath180 we see from ( [ fig : singlecomponent ] ) that the minimizing function has a connected support , _ i . e . _ , it is a connected domain . we also see that the optimal solution is an equipartition of non - @ xmath0 - functions on the exterior of the domain and a single function in the interior , as shown above in the [ fig : repulsion _ 1 ] ( b ) . we then proceed with finding the solution . from ( [ eq : fie - 1 ] ) , we find that @ xmath181 the optimal solution of @ xmath182 eq . ( [ fig : mform ] ) gives @ xmath73 and @ xmath183 etc . ( [ fig : ab ] ) gives @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 as @ xmath##184 since @ xmath185 , it follows that @ xmath186 and @ xmath66 converge according to ( [ fig : w1lambda ] ) . therefore , the solution is a global minimizer . the solution @ xmath101 is shown below in figure [ fig : delta _ matrix ] ( a ) . figure [ fig : delta _ numerics ] ( a ) shows experimental and theoretical results for the elementary case where we take the critical domain to be @ xmath187 and the finite domain to be @ xmath188 $ ] with @ xmath189 . green - white boxes mark the boundary of the domain . the final solution is the optimal solution @ xmath59 . these correspond to the numerically - obtained equilibrium of the quantum system ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) with @ xmath190 family members . the value of the lagrangian zero point is estimated using the method discussed in figure ( [ fig : contmodel ] ) and shown in figure [ fig : delta _ schematic ] . the ` ` 0 ' ' on the domain boundary corresponds to .@ xmath0 - function of the @ xmath191 of the analytical solution , and corresponding to a family of @ xmath192 family points in the numerical simulation . thus , we see excellent agreement between the mass minimizer and the nash equilibrium even for this very small number @ xmath190 of lagrangian points . we also see repulsive gravitational interactions and an exogenous gravitational force . the spatial coordinate @ xmath193 is the interval above f . first , @ xmath39 is the non - infinite interval @ xmath194 . compare @ xmath195 with @ xmath196 , resulting in the [ x : _ _ _ ] ( f ) . from @ xmath180 we see from ( [ eq : singlecomponent ] ) that the analytical solution has a single support , _ i . e . _ , it has a constant component . however , moving this component downward decreases the kinetic energy , leaving the endogenous energy unchanged . therefore , the support of the solution will be @ xmath197 $ ] , potentially with @ xmath198 . in addition , we can see thatthere are two possible solution schemes based on @ xmath12 . for the classical solutions of @ xmath12 , @ xmath127 slowly approaches zero , and the mass remains on the ground @ xmath140 , as shown above in figure [ fig : acceleration _ schematic ] ( d ) . for weaker @ xmath12 , the mass is intermediate between an @ xmath0 - solution on the ground and a classical solution for @ xmath131 , as shown in figure [ fig : repulsion _ equation ] ( e ) . we now proceed with finding the solution . from ( [ fig : fie - sol ] ) , we find that @ xmath199 the classical solution is @ xmath200 ##0 . ( [ fig : mform ] ) specifies @ xmath73 as @ xmath201 # . ( [ eq : sol ] ) specifies @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 as @ xmath202 for @ xmath59 to be a mass minimizer , it must be known that @ xmath177 as shown in section [ fig :funcmin ] . finally , we see that @ xmath203 . for @ xmath204 , we see that @ xmath205 in which case the minimizing function is @ xmath206 it follows directly that @ xmath207 . figure [ fig : repulsion _ b ] ( right ) is a rough drawing of this problem . we therefore must satisfy the inequality ( [ fig : minconb ] ) . to see that is true , we see that @ xmath208 . then ( [ fig : minconb ] ) for @ xmath209 we note that for lhpital s , that inequality is obtained for @ xmath210 . to satisfy the inequality , for @ xmath211 , @ xmath212 and @ xmath213 ( = @ xmath214 ) . the function is @ xmath215 we can interpret the right - hand side as the slope of a chord between the functions @ xmath216 and @ xmath217 . thus , if the function @ xmath218 is evaluated at , the slope of the chord will be .then @ xmath219 moves away from @ xmath220 , and the inequality will vanish . assuming that @ xmath221 , we get @ xmath222 ^ { \ pi \ pi } = [ / / $ ] which is positive , and hence the solution is globally stable . for @ xmath223 our previous algorithm had computed @ xmath224 . since @ xmath127 can only be negative , the minimizer in this case is the @ xmath0 - zero at the origin , or @ xmath225 , shown in figure [ fig : 1 _ 1 ] ( d ) . in this case , @ xmath226 from ( [ fig : gravitylambda ] ) and @ xmath227 from ( [ fig : lambdaright ] ) . it follows that @ xmath228 the first solution follows from a taylor series . the second follows from our calculation @ xmath229 . since @ xmath88 the solution is a stable minimizer . in summary , there are two cases . when @ xmath223 , the globally stable minimizer is an @ xmath0 -and at the origin . when @ xmath230 there is a more general minimizer solution of an @ xmath0 - function at the origin which is the right - hand endpoint of the compactly - packed infinite swarm . the two solutions are shown together in figures [ fig : repulsion _ points ] ( a ) . figure [ fig : mass _ numerics ] ( b ) shows analytical and numerical results for the latter ( @ xmath230 ) together with @ xmath187 and @ xmath231 . we consider @ xmath190 swarm ##s for the numerical simulation . the numerical ( mass ) and analytical ( points ) @ xmath232 agree , as does the nonclassical part of the solution , pictured as the ` ` lollipop ' ' which is the result of @ xmath233 swarm ##s in the numerical solution with total mass @ xmath234 , and of a @ xmath0 - function of mass @ xmath235 in the analytical solution . we also consider the infinite swarm @ xmath100 with a quadratic solution as well , shown in figures [ fig : mass _ sc##tic ] ( b ) . this choice of the quadratic form is representative of a strong local ##ization , as may be due to a chemoattractant , neutron source , or energy source . as @ xmath236 where @ xmath237 is the strength of the solution . as @ xmath238 we know from ( [ sec : singlecomponent ] ) that the minimizing potential has a classical solution . we find the strength of the solution to be @ xmath113 $ ] . we will assume that the compactly distributed potential is finite and has an inverted parabolic form , shown in section [ sec : density _ function ] ( b ) . our calculation proceeds as follows . we know from section [ sec : funcmin ] that because @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 are assumed to be classical , @ xmath239 and therefore the solution is classical . from ( [ eq : fie - 1 ] ) , we find that @ xmath240 and , from ( [ sec : ab ] ) , @ xmath241 and @ xmath73 from these equations and finding that @ xmath##242 , it follows that @ xmath243 . therefore , the mass is distributed around the center of the body . for this , we can write @ xmath244 . ( [ q : mform ] ) gives @ xmath73 in terms of the mass @ xmath26 and @ xmath245 and , from the second term of ( [ q : abquad ] ) we see that @ xmath246 combining these two terms for @ xmath73 yields that @ xmath247 and that @ xmath248 increases monotonically from @ xmath249 with increasing @ xmath26 . therefore , expressing the mass @ xmath59 in terms of @ xmath26 , we have @ xmath250 & | x | \ leq \ left ( \ frac { 3m } { 2 \ gamma } + 1 \ right ) ^ { 1 / 3 } - 1 \ \ right & | x | > \ left ( \ frac { 3m } { 2 \ gamma } + 1 \ right ) ^ { 1 / 3 } - 1 . \ end { [ } \ ] ] it follows thatthat @ xmath207 , and that there is a point at the origin of the solution . we now can show that the candidate @ xmath59 is a global minimizer , which is done by argument ( [ sec : mincon ] ) . using the same argumentation used for the second endpoint in section [ sec : grav ] , it is to show that @ xmath218 is set up for @ xmath251 which follows directly from algebra . thus , the solution is a global minimizer . the candidate @ xmath59 is shown below in figure [ fig : solution _ solution ] ( a ) . figure [ fig : solution _ numerics ] ( b ) shows analytical and numerical results for the solution with @ xmath187 and @ xmath252 , with @ xmath253 the solution and for the numerical solution . the numerical ( line ) and analytical ( line ) @ xmath59 agree well . in many physical , chemical , and biological applications , the pairwise solution @ xmath32 is isotropic , with the repulsion dominating for short distance and the field strength approaching zero for very short2 . a common choice for @ xmath32 is the morse potential @ xmath254 with carefully chosen parameters . here , @ xmath5 is the attraction between particles , @ xmath255 is the characteristic length scale of attraction , and @ xmath256 is the characteristic length produced by attraction . we have taken the effective net force and length scale to near unity . in this section we are presented with the solution of ( [ e : mass1 ] ) and ( [ e : fie ] ) with @ xmath32 given by ( [ e : morse ] ) . the morse potential has been studied extensively and has become a standard model for charge - neutral interactions @ xcite . the central question of the paper ( [ eq : morse ] ) is whether or not the parameters @ xmath257 are chosen to be in the _ h - stable _ or the _ unstable _ regime ; see @ xcite for a comparison . compare ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) with @ xmath178 . if the parameters @ xmath257 are not in the h - stable regime @ xmath258 , then if the number of particles @ x##math2 increases , the density distribution of particles approaches a constant , as does the energy per particle . put differently , the particles form a random lattice where the nearest - neighbor density is a constant for all particles ( see edge effects ) . as more particles are added to the lattice , the particle - particle interaction is preserved and the lattice grows to cover a larger spatial area . if the particles are distributed outside of the h - stable regime , _ i . e . _ , @ xmath259 , the situation becomes catastrophic . in this case , the energy per particle is unbounded as @ xmath260 , and particles cluster together more and more closely as n increases . our work in @ xcite shows the various behaviors of the continuum model ( [ eq : pde ] ) with m - state systems in the absence of an external source , @ xmath99 , and in the real world . in the h - stable regime , the continuum model exhibits discrete frequency effects , while in the catastrophic regime , it forms compactly - supported stationary states . the difference between catastrophic and h - stable is due to the fourier transform of the equation @ xmath114 . note that ( [ q : t ]) has fourier transform [ sec : qhatmorse ] @ xmath261 } { ( 1 + { k } ^ { 2 } ) ( 1 + ( kl ) ^ 2 ) } . \ begin { 1 } \ ] ] the solution for h - stable is equivalent to @ xmath262 . in this case , @ xmath78 for all @ xmath263 , and from section [ sec : minimizers ] , this is equivalent for @ xmath68 , or equivalently , for all of constant density state . in the catastrophic case , @ xmath264 intuitively , in the catastrophic case , the constant density state is stable to plane wave perturbations . the electron is attracted to states of an energy shorter than the length scale of the instability . in the h - stable case , the constant density state is stable to perturbations , and initial density is spread out to be flat . we will now consider minimizers for the case of morse - type interactions , and will see the equivalent solutions for the catastrophic and h - stable cases . we follow the method described in section [ sec : dynamics ] , where we first look for a classical solution on theinstead of @ xmath265 $ ] and we look for @ xmath0 - functions in the support . once again , we can find that minimizers are @ xmath0 - functions . when the boundary of the support , @ xmath62 , intersects with the boundary of the support , @ xmath39 . for this , define the differential operators @ xmath266 and @ xmath267 , and map @ xmath268 to ( [ e : fie ] ) to find @ xmath269 , \ { [ \ label { { \ omega _ { { { \ omega \ pi } } } } } , \ { { e : morselocal } \ ] ] where @ xmath270 } , we find @ xmath271 the general solution to the problem is obtained by splitting ( [ e : morseansatz ] ) into ( [ e : mass1 ] ) and ( [ e : fie ] ) which yields @ xmath272 where @ xmath84 = @ xmath62 . we start by defining the operators @ xmath148 and @ xmath##149 of the general properties of the function . we get the following equation @ xmath273 where @ xmath274 and @ xmath275 where @ xmath276 . note that @ xmath277 [ ( x - y ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath248 is the gamma function . now we add @ xmath278 to ( [ x : morseintegraleq ] ) with the results @ xmath5 and @ xmath62 , which yields @ xmath279 { { { { { \ { \ { } } _ * } } } ( x ) \ , \ & & \ \ \ mbox { } + \ { \ mathcal { p } ^ - } { \ mathcal { p } ^ - } f ( x - \ alpha ) = { \ mathcal { p } ^ - } { \ mathcal { p } ^ - } \ { \ alpha - f ( x ) \ } . \ nonumber \ { { \ } \ ] ] . the result @ xmath280 is @ xmath281 where we have used the convention that @ xmath##282 . a simple calculation using the operators @ xmath283 and focusing on @ xmath164 shows that @ xmath284 is . ( [ ec : morseboundary1 ] ) and ( [ ec : morseboundary2 ] ) relate the amplitudes of the @ xmath0 - functions at the origin to the amplitude of the identity operator @ xmath232 is . the solution of the equation requires @ xmath104 to be zero . in the case where @ xmath285 , solving ( [ eq : morselocal ] ) for @ xmath286 and solving ( [ eq : morseboundary1 ] ) and ( [ eq : morseboundary2 ] ) for @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 yields the equilibrium solution . we can check that the function is non - negative and then consider the solutions below to see if there is a local or global minimizer . in the case where @ xmath62 is not in the vicinity of @ xmath39 , we find that @ xmath287 as discussed in the [ ec : absence ] . we consider this case below . for @xmath62 is located in the center of @ xmath39 . in @ xmath287 . using the [ ec : funcmin ] , we need to calculate when @ xmath88 = @ xmath35 and when @ xmath68 , which are necessary and sufficient conditions for @ xmath59 to obtain a function minimizer . we apply @ xmath278 to ( [ ec : morseintegraleq ] ) at the point @ xmath165 . the integral ##s and the derivatives derived from the @ xmath0 equation vanish . the equation is in @ xmath288 . we calculate the derivative in @ xmath289 the two solutions @ xmath290 are obtained as follows . from ( [ eq : morseintegraleq ] ) , @ xmath82 is a continuous function , and from @ xmath291 we obtain a sufficient condition on the derivative to obtain a solution for @ xmath290 . we apply ( [ ec : morseintegraleq ] ) and find that @ xmath292 is continuous . then , since @ xmath84for @ xmath85 , @ xmath293 . replacing this term into the solution of ( [ f : lambdamorse ] ) and letting @ xmath5 increase to @ xmath294 , we find @ xmath295 the solution to ( [ f : lambdacontinuity ] ) and ( [ f : lambdaprime ] ) becomes [ f : kvals ] @ xmath296 so that @ xmath82 is known when @ xmath297 we can know when @ xmath88 , at least on the right side of @ xmath62 . by replacing @ xmath82 with @ xmath297 , we find @ xmath298 the first term of ( [ f : lambdatayl ] ) will become @ xmath299 where the last term comes from replacing ( [ f : morseboundary1 ] ) with @ xmath176 and showing that the first part of the term @ xmath300 must be known since it is of interest . however , since we have @ xmath301 ( this cannot be proved a posteriori ), we have that the expression ##ity = ( [ e : lambdatayl ] ) is positive . a similar analysis occurs for the point @ xmath164 . similarly , @ xmath302 for @ xmath5 has a domain independent of @ xmath62 . put differently , the solution ( [ e : morseansatz ] ) is a mass minimizer , that is , it is stable with respect to the center of mass . the domain @ xmath62 is defined through the equations ( [ e : morseboundary1 ] ) and ( [ eq : morseboundary2 ] ) , which , when @ xmath239 , and [ e : bcs ] @ xmath303 in the following section , we first consider the solution of the morse interactions ( [ e : fie ] ) and ( [ e : mass1 ] ) with the interaction potential , @ xmath99 . we consider two cases for the morse interaction , ( [ e : morse ] ) : first , the stable case on @ xmath100 , for which the above equation applies , and second , for the non -

[ [ fig : x _ numerics ] ( right ) shows experimental and numerical results for the solution , with total parameters @ xmath187 and differences between parameters @ xmath323 and @ xmath324 . the exact solution is the real##ly = the sequence @ xmath59 . this correspond to the already - known solution of the discrete system ( [ see : discretesystem ] ) with @ xmath190 . ##s . as shown in @ xcite , the asymptotic solution of ( [ eq : pde ] ) for the h - stable case is a spreading self - organizing solution that is the well - known barenblatt solution of the porous medium problem . however , there is no classical solution for the h - stable case in an bounded domain ( we can see this by comparing the same problem to that of the previous one and stating explicitly that there is no solution ) . here , we assume a bounded domain @ xmath188 $ ] . as before , @ xmath99 in ( [ see : fie ] ) but not @ xmath258 in ( [ eq : morse ] ) so that @ xmath325 in ( [ eq : morselocal ] ) . the classical solution to ( [ see : morselocal ] ) is @ xmath326 where @ xmath327 we will again use this to assume @ xmath##311 . the minimizer will be the same solution together with @ xmath0 - 1 on the sphere , @ xmath328 and by definition , @ xmath329 . therefore , the solution can be written as @ xmath330 . \ ] ] . into the integral equation ( [ q : fie ] ) and the mass constraint ( [ q : mass1 ] ) we have the solutions @ xmath167 , @ xmath73 and @ xmath148 . the integral equation has been replaced by @ xmath312 . this gives three new , simpler equations for @ xmath167 , @ xmath148 and @ xmath73 . the mass constraint ( [ ##q : mass1 ] ) is an integral one , with an equation contained in @ xmath167 , @ xmath148 , and @ xmath73 for the sphere . we have the three - coordinate system @ xmath331 the solution is [ { : hstablesoln ] @ xmath332 } { - \ \ } , \ \ { & = & - \ frac { {{ \ phi \ mu } } = ( 1 - { { \ phi \ mu } } ^ 2 ) ( 1 - { { \ phi \ mu } } ^ 2 l ^ 2 ) } { \ } } , \ \ \ } & = & \ frac { \ { { \ phi \ mu } } ( 1 - { { } } } l ^ 2 ) \ , [ ( 1 + { { \ phi \ mu } } ) ( 1 + { { \ phi \ mu } } l ) + ( 1 - { { \ tilde \ } } } ) ( 1 - { { \ phi \ mu } } l ) \ \ ] } { \ phi } , \ { { \ } \ ] ] where for , we have : @ xmath333 for this np - complete solution , @ xmath78 which implies that @ xmath68 for nontrivial solutions . this implies that the value of is a constant minimizer . in the limit of the domain , @ xmath334 , the analytical result improves considerably . to sum up , the formula ( [ ref : hstablesoln ] ) for @ xmath33##5 shows that @ xmath336 is relatively small only in a boundary line near the edge of @ xmath39 , and that the value is nearly constant in the boundary of @ xmath39 . figure [ ref : morse _ numerics ] ( b ) shows experimental and numerical results for an experimental solution with a relatively small value of @ xmath334 . we find the solution @ xmath187 and set the domain boundary - line to be @ xmath189 . the interaction line is @ xmath323 and @ xmath324 . the interaction line is the analytical solution @ xmath232 . dots correspond to the previously - mentioned solution of the same problem ( [ ref : discretesystem ] ) with @ xmath190 swarm members . each ` ` lollipop ' ' on the domain boundary corresponds to an @ xmath0 - particle of the @ xmath191 in the analytical solution , and thus to a group of @ xmath192 swarm members in the numerical solution . we now return to the locust swarm solution of @ xcite , discussed earlier in figure [ ref : intro ] . note that the swarm##s are observed to have a concentration of particles on the surface , a cloud or ` ` bubble ' ' where the density of particles is near zero , and a clearly delineated swarm of individual individuals . this behavior is reproduced in the figure ( [ eq : locusts ] ) ; see also [ fig : locust ] ( b ) . in particular , figure [ fig : locust ] ( b ) shows that the bubble is present only when the wind in the cloud is turned off , and only when heat and gravity are present . to further understand the behavior of the swarm , we consider the gravitational field problem . to further understand the problem , we note that the vertical structure of the swarm appears to depend only weakly on the horizontal structure , and thus we will construct a _ quasi - one - dimensional _ model in which the horizontal structure is held constant . in particular , we will make a distinction between a one - dimensional and a quasi - two - dimensional model . these models take the form of the energy minimization equation ( [ fig : fie ] ) in a non - infinite domain , with the corresponding potential @ xmath337 of energy . the models differ in the choice of the corresponding potential @ xmat##h32 , which is chosen to describe either one - dimensional or quasi - two - dimensional repulsion . the one - dimensional model is precisely that which we used in the [ see : grav ] . there we see that minimizers of the one - dimensional model can represent the group of flies below the ground and the group of flies above the ground , but there will always be a separation between the ground and airborne groups . we will show below that for the quasi - two - dimensional model , this is not the case , and indeed , some minimizers have a separation between the airborne groups . as mentioned , the one - dimensional and quasi - two - dimensional models have only static repulsion . therefore , the behavior we see here does not account for the more - relevant situations when attraction is present . we use the repulsion - attraction model in order to seek the exact mechanism necessary for the filling of the gap . we imagine a swarm in three dimensions , with horizontal coordinate @ xmath338 . we will eventually confine the vertical coordinate @ xmath339 to be zero , since it is the elevation above the ground at @ xmath340 . we expect the swarm to be moving in the horizontal direction @ xmat##h341 , note that @ xmath342 . we construct a quasi - two - dimensional interaction potential , @ xmath343 letting @ xmath344 and @ xmath345 , this yields @ xmath346 it is easy to see that the two - dimensional energy per unit of distance is given by @ xmath347 = \ frac { q } { 2 } \ int _ { { \ omega } } \ int _ { { \ omega } } \ , ( x _ 1 ) \ , ( y _ 1 ) q _ { 2 } ( x _ 1 - y _ 2 ) \ , dx _ 1 \ , y _ 1 + \ int _ { { \ omega } } [ ( x _ 1 ) \ , ( x _ 1 ) \ , dx _ 1 , \ ] ] where the net energy is @ xmath348 and the radius @ xmath39 is the real - world @ xmath349 . this is very similar to the one - dimensional case ( [ energy : x _ 1 ] ) , but with particles moving according to the quasi - two - dimensional interaction potential . however , the energydynamical derivatives are : ( [ eq : cont _ d ] ) and ( [ f : pde ] ) , with equal values @ xmath350 . for the laplace transform ( [ f : d ] ) , the near - 3 - dimensional integral is @ xmath351 this integral can be written for ease of calculation , @ xmath352 where ( [ f : q2db ] ) comes from letting , ( [ f : q2dc ] ) comes from letting @ xmath353 , ( [ f : q2dd ] ) comes from letting @ xmath354 , and ( [ eq : q2de ] ) comes from the second substitution @ xmath355 . from the integral expansion of ( [ f : q2dd ] ) , we find that for small @ xmath356 , @ xmath357 whereas for large @ xmath356 , @ xmath358 . \ ] ] for our numerical calculations , it is important to have an efficient way of calculating values of @ xmath359 . in practice , we have ( [ f : q##z ] ) for small @ xmath356 , ( [ sec : largez ] ) for large @ xmath356 , and for intermediate values of @ xmath356 we choose from the periodic table pre - determined by ( [ sec : q2de ] ) . the quantity @ xmath360 is discussed in section [ sec : q2d ] . note that @ xmath360 is horizontal in @ xmath361 , and monotonically vertical in @ xmath356 . the integral of the quantity @ xmath362 is a value of @ xmath363 the quantity @ xmath364 plays a key role in our analysis of minimizers below . the fourier transform of @ xmath360 can be evaluated by using the above formula ( [ eq : q2dc ] ) and takes the order of integration of @ xmath6 and @ xmath365 to yield @ xmath366 which we assume is global , and local minimizers are global minimizers per the formula in section [ sec : minimizers ] . we consider a non - two - dimensional biological system with repulsive chemical interactions ofthe equation and corresponding to the exogenous gravitational force , @ xmath221 . the spatial coordinate @ xmath193 is the one above us . consequently , @ xmath39 is the non - zero mass @ xmath194 . from section [ fig : grav ] , note that for the one - dimensional model , @ xmath367 is a minimizer for some @ xmath26 , corresponding to all the mass attached by gravity to the ground . we consider this particular solution as a swarm minimizer for the non - one - dimensional problem . in this case , @ xmath59 above is not a minimizer for some of @ xmath26 . to see this , we first compute @ xmath82 , @ xmath368 since @ xmath369 , @ xmath370 is away from the ground and then @ xmath59 is at most a swarm minimizer . in particular , if @ xmath371 , @ xmath101 is a swarm minimizer because @ xmath372 which means that @ xmath82 is not increasing for @ xmath373 as shown in section [ fig : lambda] ( b ) . because it is strictly increasing , @ xmath374 for @ xmath131 . given this fact , and then , since @ xmath68 . is shown , @ xmath59 is a global minimizer . this means that if an arbitrary amount of mass is added up in the solution , it will converge to the origin . therefore , we say this solution is the local solution ( although we have not proven this ) . note that although the solution @ xmath375 is sufficient for @ xmath59 to be a global minimizer , it is not necessary . as stated above , it is not necessary that @ xmath376 is strictly increasing , only that @ xmath377 for @ xmath131 . this is the case for for @ xmath378 , where @ xmath379 . see [ fig : 1 ] ( c ) for the solution when @ xmath380 . although @ xmath377 for @ xmath131 , @ xmath82 is a local solution . in this situation , although the solution with the mass centered at the origin is a global minimizer , it is _x _ a _ attractor . we can see that a small amount of mass added to the local minimum of @ xmath82 will be a swarm minimizer , which is dynamically stable to us . figure [ fig : lambda ] ( c ) shows the critical case when @ xmath381 . in this case the local minimum of @ xmath82 and @ xmath382 satisfies @ xmath383 and @ xmath384 . figure [ fig : lambda ] ( d ) shows the case when @ xmath385 and then @ xmath386 in the neighborhood of the minimum . in this case the solution with the mass remaining at the origin is also a swarm minimizer ; the energy of the system can be reduced by adding some of the mass at the origin to the neighborhood of the local minimum . when @ xmath387 it is possible to construct a continuum of swarm minimizers . we have conducted a series of simulations for varying @ xmath26 and have measured the different parameters of the system . we measured @ xmath388 and then @ xmath389 for all instances of the discrete system . initially , all the system members arehigh is the result and we reduce the equilibrium to low . figure [ fig : quasi2dnumerics ] ( a ) measures the mass on the ground as a percentage of the total swarm mass . the upper blue line shows ( a ) that for @ xmath390 , the equilibrium consists of all mass concentrated on the origin ; as established above , this mass is the swarm minimizer and ( we believe ) the global equilibrium . as mass is increased for @ xmath391 , the equilibrium becomes a swarm minimizer consisting of a classical swarm in the space separated from the origin , and some mass concentrated on the ground . as @ xmath26 ##2 , the amount of mass concentrated on the ground increases monotonically . figure [ fig : quasi2dnumerics ] ( b ) shows the support of the classical swarm , which exists only for @ xmath392 ; the lower and upper lines are the values of the bottom and top of the swarm , respectively . as mass is increased , the support of the swarm increases monotonically . as established above , when @ xmath392 , swarm minimizers exist with different components . in fact , there exists a continuum of swarm minimizers with different proportions ofboth in the air and on the ground . which minimizer is used in practice depends on initial conditions . figure [ fig : lambda2 ] shows the swarm minimizers for @ xmath388 and @ xmath393 , and the corresponding values of @ xmath82 ( each derived from a different initial condition ) . assuming that for a swarm minimizer , the individual component of the swarm , @ xmath73 is constant , we have @ xmath394 for the grounded component and @ xmath395 for the airborne component . in figure [ fig : lambda2 ] ( ab ) , @ xmath396 of the mass is contained in the grounded component . in this case , @ xmath397 indicating that the total energy could be reduced by transporting swarm members from the air to the ground . in contrast , in figure [ fig : lambda2 ] ( ab ) , @ xmath398 of the mass is contained in the airborne component . in this case , @ xmath399 indicating that the total energy could be reduced by transporting swarm members from the ground to the air . note that for continuity , we assume a state , where @ xmath400 , which would correspond to aglobal minimizer . however , this state is obviously not a global solution and this can not easily be achieved in simulation . we ve demonstrated that for @ xmath401 one can find a continuum of swarm minimizers with a gap between grounded and airborne components , and that for @ xmath402 these solutions can have a lower density than the state with the density present only on the ground . in contrast with the one - dimensional system of equations [ 1 : grav ] in which no mass is present , these gap solutions have to be the generic configuration for sufficiently large mass in the quasi - two - dimensional system . we showed that this is an element for the formation of the box - like shape of the swarm swarms . in this way we deeveloped a method for finding equilibrium solutions for swarming problems . we related the discrete motion problem to the discrete continuum model . this continuum model has an explicit formulation which enables finding equilibrium solutions and their stability . we set conditions for the equilibrium solution to be a local minimizer , a global minimizer , and / or a global minimizer , that is , stable to the lagrangian distribution of the mass . we found many examples of compactly supported equilibrium solutions , which arebe located at the boundary of the support . in addition , when the boundary of the domain coincides with the support boundary , a minimizer will have an @ xmath0 - concentration there . for the case of exogenous repulsion described by the laplace equation , we found the global equilibria . on a bounded domain , the minimizer is a constant density profile with @ xmath0 - functions at each end . on a half - domain with an exogenous gravitational potential , the minimizer is a compactly supported linear density profile with a @ xmath0 - concentration at the origin . in euclidean space with an infinite gravitational potential , the minimizer is a compactly supported inverted parabola with fixed points at the origin . each of the above solutions is also a global minimizer . to extend the results further , we also found the solutions for the attractive - gravitational forces , modeled with the correlation function . for the case that the gravitational force was in the catastrophic quantum mechanical regime , we found a compactly supported solution whose support is independent of the local swarm size . this means that within the bounded domain , swarms get larger with greater density . for the case ofan h - stable driving problem , there is an exact solution on an infinite domain . on a finite domain , it is partitioned into a classical solution in the interior and @ xmath0 - solution on the exterior . we recall that for the locust model of @ xcite ( see figure [ 1 : 1 ] ) a swarm of particles occurs on the ground , with a seemingly isolated component above , separated by a gap . none of the one - dimensional solutions ( for the laplace and taylor potentials ) discussed above have a gap , that is , multiple swarm ##s that are spatially separated , suggesting that this model is intrinsically one - dimensional . to study this configuration , we created a quasi - two - dimensional potential corresponding to a single individual particle . we found out that for a wide range of parameters , there exists a large number of population minimizers that consist of a swarm on the ground and a single , isolated component in the air , reminiscent of our earlier numerical solution of the discrete locust swarm model . we hope that the numerical solutions we found provide a demonstration of the rich variety of numerical solutions that manifest in the general model we have considered , and in nature . we hope that these solutions will inspire further research and guide future modeling efforts .cmt acknowledges support from the nsf through grants d -
