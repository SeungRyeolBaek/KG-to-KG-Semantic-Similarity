nuclear fragmentation resulting from transition metal collsions is a complex phenomenon . the mechanism of fragmentation and dynamics has not yet been determined . a plethora of approaches have been proposed . examples of approaches include evaporative pictures @ xcite , percolation models @ xcite , lattice gas models , and statistical models based on boltzmann statistics @ xcite . in this paper we consider the statistical approach @ xcite where one considers almost all interactions of non - interacting particles . additionally , chase and mekjian @ xcite derived relations which allow the direct calculation of the energy density function for such a system . by eliminating the need for more complicated monte carlo procedures and numerical methods , this technique allows a deeper insight into the thermodynamic processes which drive the process of fragmentation . in the next section we present the recursive technique of chase and mekjian and describe the observed properties , some of which have already been described in the literature . we emphasize that the surface energy is the most important factor in determining the stability and phase transition properties of the model . in the three subsequent sections , we present aspects of the model which are necessary for serious analysis of such systems : excluded middle , coulomb effects , andisospin degrees of freedom . in the [ micro _ sec ] we show how the microcanonical distribution can be derived from the canonical distribution . for example , we have an extension of the model , which is based on the work of chase and mekjian @ xcite . the equations used here are based on a picture of non - interacting liquid drops . mekjian and chase had previously used similar ideas from @ xcite to a more theoretically motivated fragmentation model that is also based on a liquid - drop model . we consider that there are @ xmath0 nuclei which thermalize in a volume @ xmath1 much larger than @ xmath2 where @ xmath3 is the ground - state of the nucleus of @ xmath0 nucleons . these nuclei can appear as nuclei but also as clusters of @ xmath4 nucleons . the total partition function of this model can be written as @ xmath5 where @ xmath6 is the partition function of a single composite of size @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 is the number of individual nuclei and the sum ##mation over all the partitions which satisfy @ xmath9 .a priori this appears to be a horrendously difficult problem . @ xmath10 can be computed recursively via the formula , @ xmath11 + @ xmath12 = 1 . it is this formula and the generalisation of this to more realistic case ( see below ) that makes this formula more widely applicable . the properties of the system are determined by the partition functions of indepedent particles . the first part also allows a great degree of flexibility in the choice of partition functions for the system , @ xmath6 . any combination of mass , density and @ xmath0 is possible . however , the information on the configuration of the components of the system is outside the scope of this formula . for the first part of this model , we assume the form , @ xmath13 the first part is due to the free motion of the center of mass of the particles in the system @ xmath1 and the second part is due to the crystal structure . for the frame of reference @ xcite we assume the form @ xmath14 where @ xmath15 is the volume energy per nucleon ( = 1 mev ) , @ xmath16 is the surface tension whichis a function of the temperature @ xmath17 . the sum of the different terms in ref . ( [ bondorf _ fe _ eq ] ) is the following : @ xmath18 is the ground state energy of the composite of @ xmath19 nucleons , and the second term in the expression arises because the composite ##s exist not only in the ground state but also in the states which are described above by the einstein - bell model . in ref @ xcite the energy of @ xmath20 is assumed to be 20 mev . thus the temperature dependence of @ xmath16 in ref @ xcite is @ xmath21 ^ { 5 / 2 } $ ] with @ xmath22 mev and @ xmath23 mev . any other dependence could be considered as a dependence on the energy density . upon calculation , the model described above reveals a first order phase dependence . in figure [ cv _ 1 ] the specific heat at constant volume , @ xmath24 , is expressed as a function of temperature for molecules of size , @ xmath25 , @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 . the sharp increase represents a change in the energy density , whichsharpens for increasingly complex systems . the usual example of a liquid - gas phase transition is a discontinuity in the electron density when pressure is kept constant rather than when the temperature is kept constant . to see this , we consider a system divided into one large nucleus and many small clusters . the pressure and the energy may both be approximated as @ xmath28 where @ xmath29 is the number of clusters . the bulk term depends only on the temperature and not on the order in which the nucleons are partioned into fragments . we have calculated the surface energy , which is proportional to @ xmath30 . in this limit , @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 = @ xmath33 the bulk term depends only on the temperature and is kept constant across the phase transition . however , a spike in @ xmath32 is equivalent to a spike in @ xmath34 since both are proportional to @ xmath35 . it is important to make a distinction between this approach and the usual theoretical approach , since the interactions between particles enter only through the surface term . the bulk quantities may be calculated in a similar manner . for instance the pressure and chemical potentials may be calculated using the relations, @ xmath36 , of @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 are shown in figure [ mup _ fig ] as a measure of density for a system of particles @ xmath39 . both the temperature and the composition remain relatively constant throughout the process of phase transition . of particular interest is that the pressure actually falls in the critical region due to finite temperature effects . we now make some assumptions about effects of various variables in analysis . ( [ bondorf _ fe _ fig ] ) . the surface terms , @ xmath40 , are not affected by the free energy , but they cannot be ignored when considering bulk observables . their influence with respect to other thermodynamic quantities is of a trivial character . the surface term @ xmath16 is completely important for determining bulk observables due to fragmentation and for all aspects of the phase transition . aside from the particle size @ xmath0 , fragmentation is governed by two dimensionless terms . the first is the internal entropy , @ xmath41 and the second is the surface term @ xmath42 . at a finite temperature the free energy @ xmath43 of @ xmath0 nucle##ons should be used . with the surface energy term , @ xmath44 is minmised if the whole system appears as one composite of @ xmath0 , but the entropy term encourages break up into clusters . at low temperatures the surface term dominates while at high temperatures entropy dominates and the system breaks into small clusters . the mass distribution can be calculated from the partition function . @ xmath45 the mass distribution is displayed in the [ massdist _ fig ] for three temperatures , 6 . 0 , 6 . 25 and 6 . 5 mev which are centered on the surface energy of 6 . 5 mev . the distributions have been multiplied by @ xmath7 to emphasize the size of the system . the mass distribution changes dramatically in this larger temperature range . the effect is reminiscent of that seen in the percolation of noble gas , @ xcite . the formula used to define to the partition function of the system , @ xmath6 , in ref . ( [ bondorf _ fe _ fig ] ) , should include only that region in which the fragments are free to move . smith and stcker suggested using @ xmath46 to calculate the volume taken up by the fragments . after inspecting the. ( [ bondorf _ fe _ t ] ) on we see that this affects the partion function by not mapping the phase and energy terms to plot observables . more generally , the excluded volume could depend upon the multiplicity . nonetheless , in the complicated calculations not reported here , it was found that for the purpose of calculating @ xmath47 values in the domain of interest in this paper , it is an acceptable practice to ignore the multiplicity dependence of the excluded volume @ xcite . incorporating the multiplicity dependence would be outside the scope of the standard model , as it would require an external interaction between particles . alternatively , we could add an @ xmath4 - dependence to the volume dependence to account for the difficulty of fitting particles of different sizes into a tight volume . this might improve the model in a non - trivial way . we want to remind the reader that the expression @ xmath48 in the van der waals equation : @ xmath49 also has its roots in the excluded volume . from there @ xmath48 plays a crucial role . we could not for example obtain @ xmath48 = 0 without introducing an interaction at high energies . furthermore , the phase dependence of when @ xmath4is set to zero . it has been understood that the quantum effects alter the electronic structure of chemical reactions @ xcite . although explicit coulomb effects are outside the scope of this treatment , they may be explained by using a one - dimensional model for the coulomb energy that has been shown by bondorf and donangelo @ xcite . the solution to the internal free energy given in eq . ( [ bondorf _ fe _ fig ] ) is @ xmath50 this equation implies a jellium of high density that cancels the nucleons positive charge when spread over a large area . this may be more strongly applicable for the modeling of stellar systems where the electrons play the role of the jellium . we display @ xmath31 , both with and without coulomb , for an @ xmath51 solution in figure [ cvcoulomb _ fig ] . coulomb effects clearly determine the rate at which the reaction occurs . for very large systems , it destroys the system and large drops are unstable to the strong force . the general approach employed here is easily extended to consider multiple types of particles . if there exist a variety of particles with different charges @ xmath52, @ xmath53 , one can write a similar relation for the charge @ xcite . @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 is the net nuclear charge of type @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 is the charge of type @ xmath56 given by the fragment noted by @ xmath19 . for the nuclear physics example , one would like to calculate @ xmath58 where @ xmath59 and @ xmath60 were the corresponding neutron and proton numbers . to calculate @ xmath61 one must use @ xmath62 for either @ xmath63 or @ xmath64 . to accomplish this one must use both these numbers . in nuclear physics , one does not have access to a heat bath , but one can calculate the thermal energy . the microcanonical ensemble is therefore more useful for theoretical calculations , especially considering the existence of a first order phase transition which occupies an infinite ( in the limit of large @ xmath0 ) range of temperatures in a canonical calculation , but a larger range of temperatures in a microcanonical ensemble . the energy wave function for a microcanonical ensemble is the density of states , @xmath65 where the sum over @ xmath56 is the sum over all many - body systems . although @ xmath66 is quite calculable given the above formula given in the previous sections , one can calculate the integral over @ xmath67 numerically . the exact solution for the density of states would be ill - defined given the discreet nature of quantum spectra which can only be calculated with a delta function . however , if one considers the density of states over a small range of size @ xmath68 , the density of states is well - defined even for discreet spectra . for that reason we can pragmatically define the density of states as @ xmath69 one could have considered replacing the delta function by a lorentzian rather than by a gaussian , but this would be dangerous given that the density of states only increases exponentially for a many - body system . the energy range @ xmath68 used to sample the density of states would correspond to the range of possible energies measured in an experimental experiment . in the case @ xmath70 , @ xmath71 approaches the density of states . as an example of a quantity one might want to measure within microcanonical approach , we consider the energy multiplicity of each fragment of type @ xmath19 in a system whose total energy is within @ xmath68 of @ xmath44 . @ xmath72 where @ xmath73 is the number of fragments of type @ xmath19 in the fragment @ xmath56 . the integration over @ xmath67 ##4 provides an added numerical challenge that increases for small @ xmath68 . for the purpose of calculating a mass distribution , one must perform this integration for many times . it may be worthwile to try computing the integration over @ xmath67 with the saddle point method , although one should be wary of taking derivatives of @ xmath74 with respect to @ xmath67 in the phase transition region . microcanonical effects can also be measured in a slightly different manner by discreetizing the charge . for example one might measure it in excess of 0 . 5 mev . one can then measure this on the same scale as any other conserved charge . one may then calculate recursion relations for @ xmath75 , the number of ways to measure @ xmath0 ##7 withnet energy @ xmath44 , where @ xmath44 is an integer . @ xmath76 ##1 , @ xmath77 is the number of ways of generating a fragment of atoms @ xmath19 with net energy @ xmath78 . many other relavant microcanonical parameters can be calculated in a similar way . since one needs to calculate @ xmath59 at all energies @ xmath79 greater than the targeted energy @ xmath44 , and must sum over all energies greater than @ xmath79 to get @ xmath80 , the length of the calculation is proportional to @ xmath81 . typically , nuclear decays occur with on the order of 1 gev of energy deposited in the nucleus . however , these calculations may become numerically difficult unless the energy is discreetized rather quickly . the recursive models discussed above have some interesting features . they are easy to work with , have properties of molecular composites and appear to have some properties of solid - state phase transitions . in the simplest forms these models are resricted to low energies . for simple nuclear disintegration this is not a difficult problem , although for completeness it wouldbe sure to be able to modify the model so that it can be extended to higher dimensions . in this paper we have described the properties of the particles , and we emphasize the importance of the energy density in describing these properties . we can compare the change in the energy density with temperature to the change in the number of particles . in addition , we have shown that including these properties lowers the temperature at which the phase transition occurs and reduces the probability of the phase transition . we have also proposed an extension of the model for the inclusion of isospin degrees of freedom . for applications to particle physics models , development of the microcanonical approaches described here is of great importance . it remains to be seen whether the microcanonical approaches are applicable , as they have yet to be developed . ph . chomaz , ann . b * 21 * , 669 ( 1996 ) burgio , ph . chomaz and j . randrup , phys . 69 * , 885 ( 1992 ) . j . feldmeier and j . schnack , prog . particle nucl . phys . * 69 * , 393 ( 1997 ) . t . ohnishi and j . randrup, phys . b * 394 * , 260 m . kiderlen and m . danielewicz , nucl . b * 620 * , 346 ( 1997 ) . m . pratt , m . montoya and m . ronning , phys . b * 349 * , 261 ( 1995 ) . j . randrup and a . koonin , nucl . b * 356 * , 321 ( 1981 ) . lee , j . phys . * 47 * , 605 ( 1990 ) . bondorf , a . s . botvina , a . s . iljinov , i . n . mishustin and k . sneppen , physics b * 257 * , 133 -
