fields appearing in a curved spacetime have ` ` tails ' ' . in fact , it is well known that the _ dominant _ late - time component of massless particles appearing in black - hole spacetimes is a power - law tail . price @ xcite was the first to analyze the process by which the spacetime outside a ( possibly massive ) collapsing bubble divests itself of its radiative multipole moments , and leaves behind a schwarzschild black hole ; it was found that all radiative moments decay asymptotically to an inverse power of time . physically , these inverse power - law tails are associated with the motion of waves in the effective gravitational potential in the far regions @ xcite . the analysis of tails was continued by other authors . bik @ xcite continued the analysis and studied the dynamics of a scalar field in a _ charged _ reissner - nordstrm spacetime . he also observed an _ inverse power - law decay of the field , with the _ _ _ _ tail as in the schwarzschild spacetime ( with the exception of the _ extremal _ reissner - nordstrm black hole @ .##cite ) . in a similar demonstration , brown @ xcite showed that the late - time tail can be associated with the existence of a branch cut in the green wave function for the wave propagation process . gundlach , brown , and pullin @ xcite showed that these inverse power - law tails can characterize the late - time tails of radiative waves at future null infinity , and at the black - hole outer horizon . moreover , they showed that power - law tails are a common feature of gravitational collapse the existence of these tails was demonstrated by the non - linear numerical simulations of the spherically symmetric components of the self - gravitating scalar field @ xcite ( this was later reproduced in @ xcite ) . our current understanding of the late - time tail is , however , somewhat limited . the ( _ _ _ _ ) power - law tails in black - hole spacetimes are well understood @ xcite , but the resulting signals are only very stable at very _ late _ times . in a typical experimental scenario there is a considerable time window in which the signal is no longer dominated by the quasinormal modes @ xcite , but the leading order power - law tail has not yet taken hold @ xcite . theaim of this work is to derive useful expressions for the _ higher - order terms _ which ` ` contaminate ' ' the well - defined power - law tail of a spherically symmetric gravitational field . the determination of these higher - order terms is important from several points of view : the analyses of bik @ xcite and gundlach et . @ xcite reveal the fact that the leading - order power - law tail is _ universal _ in the sense that it is _ independent _ of the black - hole electric charge ( i . e . , the power index in a _ charged _ reissner - nordstrm spacetime was found to be identical with the one obtained by price @ xcite for the original schwarzschild black hole ) . this observation raises the question : what effect ( if any ) does the black - hole electric charge leave on the ' s decay ? however , the determination of higher - order corrections to the leading order power - law tail is also of practical importance ; this is also crucial for the determination of the power index from numerical simulations . the dominant inverse power - law tail is _ ` ` contaminated ' ' _ by higher - order corrections , whose effect becomes larger as the aveliable time of integration increases . the inverse powerindex is valid only at infinitely - late times . however , in practice , the _ limited _ time of integration presents an enormous error in the computation of the power law . the only practical approach to _ quantify _ the errors which are introduced by the limited _ time is to study _ finite - order corrections _ . if one computes the second order of the finite - time tail , then the ratio of the corrections to the leading order corrections gives a systematic , accurate , measure of the error introduced by the _ finite _ - time tail _ . these problems and several others are addressed in the following paper . the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec . [ sec2 ] we give a mathematical description of the physical system and of the field equation considered . in sec . [ sec3 ] we give an analytical description of the late - time evolution of scalar fields in black - hole spacetimes . in sec . [ sec4 ] we confirm our experimental results using numerical methods . we conclude in sec . [ sec5 ] with a general summary of our results and their implications . we consider the action of a spherically symmetric massless gravitational field in a spherical symmetric charged particle ( a collapsing star or a massive black hole ) . the resulting gravitational fieldof the spherical - symmetric system of mass @ xmath4 and charge @ xmath5 is given by the reissner - nordstrm metric @ xmath6 and the tortoise - metric @ xmath7 , which is given by @ xmath8 , the second element of @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 . the wave equation @ xmath11 for the scalar field in the blue - white background reads @ xmath12 where @ xmath13 in terms of the radial potential @ xmath7 and for @ xmath14 the gravitational potential is . ( [ eq4 ] ) reads @ xmath15 the exact solution to the wave - equation ( [ eq3 ] ) can be expressed as a function based on two arbitrary functions @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 @ xcite @ xmath18 } \ . \ { { { } \ ] ] where @ xmath19 is a basic time coordinate and @ xmath20 is an advanced time coordinate . for the function @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 is the @ xmath23th derivative of @ xmath##24 ; higher - order derivatives are to be interpreted as integrals . the first two terms in e . ( [ eq6 ] ) represent the zeroth - order solution ( with @ xmath25 ) . the star begins to rotate at a certain angle @ xmath26 . the world line of the stellar system is asymptotic to the ingoing - angle @ xmath27 , and the variation of the field on the stellar surface is almost infinitely redshifted @ xcite . this variation is caused by the time dilation between static ##s and infalling frames . for the external observer , the waves on the stellar surface become ` ` frozen ' ' as the star approaches the horizon . thus , he sees the physical field as a constant . we therefore make the general assumption that at some retarded time @ xmath28 on @ xmath27 . this assumption has been proven to be very successful @ xcite . we begin with the initial phase of the rotation , i . e . , the scattering of the field in the star @ xmath29 . the first two terms in eq . ( [ eq6 ] ) represent the primary waves in the stellar system , whichthe sum of primary waves . the interpretation of these two terms as primaries follows from the fact that they depend on data spread out over _ _ _ _ of the _ _ cone , whereas secondary waves depend only on data from a fixed @ xmath30 @ xcite . after the introduction of the secondary waves there is no new data for @ xmath31 , apart from background radiation . this implies that @ xmath32 . therefore , for a fixed @ xmath7 and @ xmath33 , the dominant term in eq . ( [ eq6 ] ) is @ xmath34 . the terms @ xmath35 satisfy the following relation @ xmath36 for @ xmath37 , where @ xmath38 , and @ xmath39 . thus , one has @ xmath40g ^ { ( - 1 ) } ( u _ 0 ) \ big [ 1 + [ ( m / y ) \ big ] \ . \ ] ] this is the dominant term of the primary waves . with this set of characteristic terms for @ xmath41 , we shall next consider the asymptotic behavior of the field . we confine our observationsto the regions @ xmath42 , @ xmath43 . in this case the spacetime is described as a @ xcite . ( the accuracy of this approximation is not confirmed by computer simulations ) . alternatively , the solution for @ xmath44 can be written as @ xmath45 with eq . ( [ eq8 ] ) with the initial solution of @ xmath41 vs . ( [ eq7 ] ) , one finds @ xmath46 where @ xmath47 for all times @ xmath48 we can find @ xmath49 and solve for @ xmath50 . using these coefficients we can find ex . ( [ eq8 ] ) { @ xmath51 } \ , \ ] ] where the coefficients @ xmath52 are those determined by @ xcite . using the initial solution for small @ xmath53 ( such as @ xmath54 , for the center of a black hole , or as @ xmath55 for a stellar disk ) , one finds that too . ##ncy the coefficients @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 must be of the same form ( see @ xcite for additional details ) .thus , we find that @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 we therefore find that the late - time behaviour of the field for @ xmath60 is @ xmath61 \ big [ 1 + [ ( 1 / t ) \ , ] \ . \ end { t } \ ] ] this is the late - time behaviour of the field at a fixed frequency . it is possible to integrate eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) using the method described in @ xcite . we have obtained , however , a simplified version of the exact method described in @ xcite , which is able to achieve the very high accuracy needed for the calculation ( see @ xcite for more details ) . the late - time behaviour of the scalar field is independent of the frequency of the input signal used . the equations given here are for a gaussian field [ @ xmath62 @ xmath63 ^ { 2 } \ , \ } \ , \ ] ] with a center at @ xmath64 and a tail @ xmath65 . the black - hole radius is approximately equal to @ xmath66 ; this corresponds to the ability to vary the width by an arbitrary factor of . the zevolution of the field at a fixed point @ xmath67 is shown in the bottom panel of fig . the linear _ power - law _ fall ##acy is manifest at asymptotic ##ally ##ncy . in order to study the linear effect of higher - order [ ( [ eq14 ] ) ] , we use the concept of _ _ _ power index _ @ xmath68 , defined by @ xmath69 @ xcite . taking advantage of eq . ( [ eq14 ] ) we find @ xmath70 the relationship of the local power index to the well - known physical quantity @ xmath71 is shown in the top panel of fig . the plot shows that @ xmath72 from above , with a good agreement with eq . ( [ eq16 ] ) . in order to study _ _ _ the physical properties presented in sec . [ sec3 ] , we use the quantity @ xmath73 . figure [ fig2 ] . depicts @ xmath74 as a projection of @ xmath75 on the surfaces of constant radius @ xmath76 , and @ xmath77 ( from above totop ) . the observed behaviour @ xmath78 ( regardless of the value of @ xmath7 ) is in perfect agreement with the _ analytically _ observed behaviour @ xmath79 [ [ fig . ( [ eq16 ] ) ] . thus , fig . [ fig2 ] . establishes the existence of the corrections _ of order @ xmath0 . it should be noted that the value of @ xmath80 used in this paper is @ xmath81 rather than the theoretical value @ xmath82 . this slight deviation from the theoretical value is probably due to the absence of the @ xmath83 in the expression for @ xmath68 ##3 . ( [ eq16 ] ) . the aim of this paper was to establish the existence for the _ first - order corrections _ which ` ` contaminate ' ' the well - known power - law tail in a spherically symmetric magnetic field . we have shown , both theoretically and numerically , that the _ tail dies out at late time as @ xmath0 . this late - time removal of the tail is much _ faster _ than has been considered so for @ xcite ( see the discussion in appendix a) . apart from being _ theoretical _ important , the result eq . ( [ eq14 ] ) is also of _ theoretical _ importance . it follows that an ` exact ' ( numerical ) determination of the power index requires extremely long integration times . the most accurate method for determining the power index therefore belongs to the concept of the _ dominant _ power law . in this way one avoids the extremely long tail which characterizes the early stages of the evolution . however , it follows from fig . ( [ eq16 ] ) that a determination of the power index to be @ xmath1 requires an integration time of order @ xmath84 . the dominant power - law tail is assumed to be universal in the sense that it is _ independent _ of the black - hole parameters @ xcite . we have shown , however , that this assumption is removed once we consider higher - order corrections . the electron _ state of the black - hole electric _ charge _ appears as @ xmath3 . * acknowledgments * prof . tsvi piran for this . this paper was funded by a grant from the national science foundation . it follows from eqs . ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [eq9 ] ) , and ( [ eq12 ] ) that the general solution of the field at space - time @ xmath85 ( i . e . , at @ xmath86 ) is @ xmath87 we then write the behaviour of the field at the black - hole event as @ xmath88 . for @ xmath89 the gravitational field e . ( [ eq4 ] ) is very small , and the general solution to e . ( [ eq3 ] ) can be written as @ xmath90 . for @ xmath91 we write @ xmath92 ( for @ xmath93 ) . therefore , @ xmath94 must be a constant , and with no loss of generality we can take it to be zero . we next write @ xmath95 for @ xmath96 for @ xmath97 in order to compare the @ xmath98 solution e . ( [ eqa2 ] ) with the @ xmath99 solution e . ( [ eq14 ] ) , we make the ansatz @ xmath100 $ ]for the solution in the region @ xmath98 and @ xmath96 . in other words , we assume that the solution in the @ xmath98 region has the same relaxation time @ xmath75 ##0 as the @ xmath14 solution . this assumption has been shown to be very successful for the leading edge behaviour of both neutral @ xcite and neutral @ xcite solutions . under this assumption , one gets @ xmath101 $ ] , where @ xmath102 is a constant . thus , the average behaviour of the field at the black - hole region is @ xmath103 \ . \ ] ] the first attempt to find higher - order corrections to the above power - law equation was made by andersson @ xcite ( in the context of the schwarzschild spacetime ) . this analysis was based on the _ approximate _ curvature potential in the region far away from the black hole [ see eq . ( 26 ) of @ xcite ] . while this curvature potential simplifies the calculation , it also _ contains _ the _ first order corrections terms . the first order correction term @ xcite was found to be of order @ xmath104 .this ( artificial ) result is caused by the fact that terms of order @ xmath105 ( and above ) are completely absent in the approximated curvature potential presented in @ xcite . thus , the approximate approach presented in @ xcite , _ if _ applied along the same lines to a reissner - nordstrm spacetime would imply that the action of the many - body gravitational field on the late - phase tail vanish _ identically _ ( i . e . , it would reduce to _ any _ order _ @ xmath106 ) . this result is again a direct consequence of the fact that the approximated approach of @ xcite does not take into account the terms of order @ xmath107 ( and @ xmath108 ) which appear in the ( artificial ) curvature potential . the evolution of the gravitational field , starting at @ xmath67 in a schwarzschild spacetime with @ xmath66 . the initial data shows a gaussian distribution with @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 . asymptotic _ power - law fall ##back is manifest at all points ( top panel ) . the bottom panel shows the evolution of the local ##ization index@ xmath111 . the contamination term is the well - predicted absolute value @ xmath112 at late times . , width = 642 ] the time evolution of the quantity @ xmath73 , evaluated at @ xmath113 , and @ xmath77 ( from bottom to top ) . the absolute value @ xmath78 is in perfect agreement with the _ well _ predicted value @ xmath79 at late times . this also implies the existence of the contamination term of [ @ xmath0 . , width = 642 ]
