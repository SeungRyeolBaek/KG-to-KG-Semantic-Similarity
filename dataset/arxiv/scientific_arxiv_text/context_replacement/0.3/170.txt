the pair - correlation density @ xmath1 is one of the key concepts in describing the correlation ##s , arising from the exclusion principle and weak interaction , in the whole electron liquid ( or plasma ) . @ xcite , also plays a special role in the calculation of the exchange - correlation energy - functionals in density - functional theory ( dft ) , @ xcite since in such constructions the whole electron liquid is often taken as a reference state . a great deal of scientific progress has also been made in obtaining an accurate evaluation of @ xmath1 , and the more specific time - resolved pair - correlation density @ xmath3 , with @ xmath4 $ ] . @ xcite in particular , @ xmath0 , the table - top pair - correlation density , which arises totally from @ xmath5 since @ xmath6 , has been well known to play a special role in dft . @ xcite the important role of @ xmath0 was also realized in many - body theory long ago because the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , @ xcite due to the lack of accurate evaluation of the long - range pair correlation , gave the expectation values for @ xmath##0 when the electron energies are not sufficiently high . @ xcite it is well known that , in many - body physics , the long - range correlations can be rather easily taken into account in the rpa , while the short - range correlations can be properly described by the quantum theory ( lt ) . @ xcite in this case , we want to investigate the short - range correlations in terms of @ xmath7 in the lt , in both three dimensions ( 3d ) and two dimensions ( 2d ) . in fact , experiments in this direction date back decades now , and a great deal of achievement has been made . @ xcite it is used here to give an introduction to the lt . the effective energy @ xmath8 in the lt between two interacting particles with different energies @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 is the following bethe - born equation : @ xcite @ xmath11 where @ xmath12 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential , @ xmath13 is the energy density in the noninteracting ground state and @ xmath14 is the fermi momentum , and @ xmath15 . as mentioned above , the rpa gives : .of the short - range structure of the particles , and for @ xmath1 as @ xmath16 . in fact , the solutions for @ xmath17 of the rpa satisfy the following additional condition : @ xcite @ xmath18 where @ xmath19 is the number of spatial dimensions , and @ xmath20 is the scattering radius . it was shown recently @ xcite that the pair - correlation density obtained from the second order lt calculation does not satisfy the above condition : . in this case , we prove that @ xmath21 obtained from @ xmath22 of eq . ( [ bg1 ] ) satisfies the above condition . this indicates the reliablity of the lt in the calculation of the pair - correlation density at short range . the short - range structure of the pair - correlation density is given by the behavior of the effective energy @ xmath8 at the momentum transfer @ xmath23 . in the general case , we also can simply divide the energy of the scattering radius by and . is . ( [ bg1 ] ) , @ xmath24 a commonly used approach to solve is . ( [ bg##2 ] ) in the following was given the exact solution of the coulomb problem using the direct method : @ xcite @ xmath25 with the preceding results , an exact solution for @ xmath26 was obtained which gives the most well - known result for @ xmath5 in 3d , @ xcite @ xmath27 ^ 2 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath28 with @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 . a similar result was obtained in 2d , @ xcite @ xmath31 ^ { - 2 } , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath32 with @ xmath33 in 3d . in eqs . ( [ yasuhara ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , @ xmath34 is the @ xmath35th or ##th gamma function . in this case we have managed to solve for 1 . ( [ bg2 ] ) , i . e . , without adding the error of 1 . ( [ 2 ] ) . our solutions for @ xmath5 with @ xmath36 ^ 2 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] in 3d , and @ x##math37 ^ 2 , \ { { \ } \ ] ] in 2d . equations ( [ qian3d ] ) and ( [ qian2d ] ) are the main topics of this paper . the paper is organized as follows : in sect . ii , we write eq . ( [ bg2 ] ) for solutions in 3d and 2d . in sect . iii , we get from the solutions of equation . ( [ qian3d ] ) and ( [ qian2d ] ) for @ xmath38 . we then compare our results with previous results in the paper in sect . iv . sect . v is closer to 2d . the technical details of the solutions for the equations of the large momentum expansions of the effective potential are given in appendix a . in appendix b , we describe the cusp condition of the lt . in this appendix , we give our solution to equation . ( [ bg2 ] ) for large momentum expansion @ xmath23 for the effective potential in both 3d and 2d . to this solution , we write @ xmath26 and @ xmath39 , and reduce the equations with unit @ xmath14 , and potentials with @ xmath40 , respectively. we present our results for the 3d case in section a , and the 2d case in section b , respectively . [ [ d ] ] 3d ~ ~ after passing through the angular momentum , the integral of the terms @ xmath41 , ref . ( [ bg2 ] ) , @ xmath42 we find @ xmath39 in the powers of @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 it can be easily shown by iteration that the odd power terms in the powers of @ xmath39 exist in the solution to ref . ( [ bgsolution ] ) . the two odd power terms incorporated into @ xmath39 by ref . @ xcite are actually equivalent to the changes introduced in the scattering kernel in eq . ( [ d ] ) . we substitute eq . ( [ veffsolution ] ) into ref . ( [ bgsolution ] ) , and find @ xmath45 where @ xmath46 . then through the integration on the right hand side of ref . ( [ m2n + 1 \ ] ) , one has , @ xmath47 , \ { { m } \ ] ] where @ x##math48 @ xmath49 . as the previous solution can be shown to be @ xmath50 transforming ex . ( [ n ] ) into ex . ( [ m2n + 1 \ ] ) and , @ xmath51 , ~ n \ , ex . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] similarly , transforming ex . ( [ m2n + 1 ] ) into eq . ( [ m2n + 1 ] ) , and using the corresponding time series of @ xmath43 , one finds the following equations for @ xmath52 : @ xmath53 and @ xmath54 solving ( [ a0equ ] ) and ( [ anequ ] ) for @ xmath52 can be solved exactly in time . in fact , by using the truncation of @ xmath55 for @ xmath56 , a more exact solution can be obtained for @ xmath57 @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 where @ xmath60 is appendix 1 , we find that the previous solution for @ xmath61 , which is closely related to @ xmath5 , as shown in the previous section , is very close to thethe numerical solutions to viz . ( [ a0equ ] ) and ( [ anequ ] ) . in particular , the large scale expansion of @ xmath39 is determined by the power terms of the large @ xmath62 expansion of @ xmath39 , viz . ( [ veffsolution ] ) , and so a solution similar to the above one is not certain . [ [ 1 - 1 ] ] ~ ~ ~ in particular , we make use of the above expansion , @ xmath63 and in eq . ( [ bg2 ] ) as follows : @ xmath64 carrying out the numerical expansion of @ xmath41 and @ xmath65 , we have @ xmath66 where @ xmath67 is the @ xmath35th order generating function . we expand @ xmath39 using the expansion of @ xmath43 as follows : @ xmath68 no even power terms exist in the solution to eq . ( [ bgsolution2 ] ) . however , the only even power terms @ xcite appear in @ xmath39 due to the rounding error in eq. ( [ n ] ) . we substitute viz . ( [ veffsolution2 ] ) into viz . ( [ bgsolution2 ] ) , and then @ xmath69 where @ xmath70 carrying out the improvement of @ xmath71 in viz . ( [ n2nn ] ) , one gets , @ xmath72 the solution on the right hand side of viz . ( [ j0 ] ) can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function as follows , @ xcite @ xmath73 where @ xmath74 is the identity function . finally , one gets , @ xmath75 translating eq . ( [ n2n ] ) into viz . ( [ n2n + 1 ] ) , and using the first two orders of @ xmath43 , one now gets @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 for @ xmath78 . due to the rotational symmetry , viz . ( [ c0equ ] ) and ( [ cnequ ] ) can be solved exactly in time . in particular , a more accurate solution can be found , given by the trun##cation of @ xmath79 for @ xmath56 : @ xmath80 @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 where @ xmath83 the spin - orbit pair - wise solution of the lt can be shown to be @ xcite @ xmath85 where the unit is the basis of @ xmath9 , @ xmath10 is the unit @ xmath86 , and @ xmath87 is written as , @ xmath88 . we have the solutions for the 3d and 2d problems in dimensions a and b , respectively . we can have @ xmath84 with the @ xmath89 . [ [ a - d ] ] ] ~ ~ with the same basis @ xmath90 for @ xmath8 , one has @ xcite @ xmath91 ^ 2 . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] \ , @ xmath92 ^ 2 . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] with the basis of 1 . ( [ veffsolution ] ) , one has @ xmath93 . ( [ a0equ ] ) has been solvedinstead of for obtaining the final result . the expression for @ xmath61 is given by eq . ( [ a0 ] ) , with which we obtain the final result of q . ( [ qian3d ] ) . thus , it is straightforward to show , from q . ( [ gud ( r ) ] ) , that at [ @ xmath84 , @ xmath94 [ [ ~ - 1 ] ] ] ~ ~ - 2d , one gets , @ xmath95 ^ [ . \ , { . } \ ] ] a solution to that in the first case is to @ xmath96 ##1 , by the definition of q . ( [ c0 ] ) , the final result of q . ( [ qian2d ] ) . furthermore , from q . ( [ gud2 ( r ) ] ) , we can obtain @ xmath97 ##1 , the final condition of q . ( [ r ] ) is satified both in q . ( [ gud ( r ) 1 ] ) and q . ( [ gud ( r ) 2 ] ) . in particular , for example , we shall show that , .. ( [ kernel ] ) is used , in particular , in the full s theory . ( 5 . 0 , 6 . 0 ) ( - 5 . 0 , - 6 . 0 ) ( 7 . 0 , 8 . 0 ) first of all , at very high density , we have , from eq . ( [ qian3d ] ) , @ xmath98 in fig . this ( [ highdensity ] ) is the same as the original yasuhara s theory . @ xcite we see that , the first direct calculation of , @ xcite which is difficult to approach to the exact solution at high density , , yields the solution of @ xmath99 . we have @ xmath100 , from et . ( [ qian3d ] ) in fig . 1 , in comparison with that calculated from eq . ( [ yasuhara ] ) @ xcite . note that the difference between eq . ( [ qian3d ] ) and et . ( [ yasuhara ] ) , which is not true , arises only from the error of et . ( [ kernel ] ) . by using et . ( [ yasuhara ] ) in yasuhara s .. in particular , lowy and lee @ xcite have cast doubt on the validity of the results of ref . ( [ kernel ] ) . we can ignore their results , at least for the very small range correlations . the result based on overhauser s , ( fig . ( 26 ) , ref . @ xcite ) is then plotted in 2d . the fig hence shows that the correlation between overhauser s result ( and the corresponding 2d results of gori - giorgi and perdew @ xcite ) and yasuhara s is 1 . ( 5 . 0 , 6 . 0 ) ( - 3 . 0 , - 4 . 0 ) ( 7 . 0 , 8 . 0 ) in fig . 26 , we plot @ xmath100 in 2d calculated from ref . ( [ qian2d ] ) , together with that from ref . ( [ nagano ] ) . @ xcite . then , we show that the correlation is totally due to the approximation of ref . ( [ kernel ] ) made by obtaining eq . ( [ yang ] ) . thus , for each population density , the equations give the exact same result : @ xmath101 for each sample , wehave also shown in fig . 2 the result of eq . ( 2 ) in ref . @ xcite , which was derived by polini _ z as an interpolation of the first - order ( second - order in terms of the correlation energy ) calculation for the weak - coupling limit and overhauser index calculation @ xcite for the strong - coupling limit . the simplest approach to the short - range pair correlations in many - body theory is the ladder theory , in which the interaction potential between two correlation energies satisfies the bell - jordan equation of eq . ( [ bg1 ] ) . in this paper , we have shown that , the ladder theory satisfied the necessary condition for the pair - correlation density in the homogeneous electron liquid . this confirms our confidence in the accuracy of the ladder theory in calculating the short - range correlations , and in calculating the pair - correlation density . the main results obtained in this paper are , in particular , eq . ( [ qian3d ] ) and eq . ( [ qian2d ] ) given in the introduction , in three dimensions and two dimensions respectively , for the table - top pair - correlation density in the homogeneous electron liquid . these results have been published .in eq . ( [ bg2 ] ) , in which the two scattering operators of the bethe - hamilton equation are both assumed to be identical . this approximation should be correct since the very large scale nature of the pair - correlation is explained by the nonlinear wave function dependence of the interaction potential . the main theoretical progress made in this paper is that we have obtained the approximation of q . ( [ 1 ] ) , used in the solution for the coulomb equation in formula q . ( [ bg2 ] ) . our solution to eq . ( [ bg2 ] ) is thus obtained . this work was supported by the chinese national science foundation , grant no .
