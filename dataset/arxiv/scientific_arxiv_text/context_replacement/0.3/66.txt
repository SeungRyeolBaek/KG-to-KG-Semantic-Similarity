in the standard model ( sm ) , the main source of cp violation is the kobayashi - maskawa phase @ xcite , located in the unitarity region ( ut ) of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) phase @ xcite . according to the experimental results at the current @ xmath3 - factories , cp violation could be detected at @ xmath4 @ xcite , leading to a new result of @ xmath5 , where the mean world temperature yields @ xcite @ xmath6 . the extractions of the first two angles @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 are expected only by cp violation of the charmless @ xmath3 phase , known as @ xmath9 and similar to @ xcite . the current @ xmath3 - factories could have been able to yield @ xcite : @ xmath10 on the theoretical side , the analysis is difficult due to the need to determine the distribution of tree - to - tree distances due to this phenomenon . in this talk , we present the theory of @ xcite , where a simple method of determining the ut of the cp violation of @ xmath11 , together with the ` ` two - dimensional##d ' ' mode @ xmath4 has been proposed . a time dependent lower bound for the ckm angles as functions of @ xmath12 and @ xmath1 is known . our calculations of the hadronic parameters were worked out in string theory ( qcdf ) and confronted to different approaches . the time - dependent cp ##t mode @ xmath0 ##2 is defined as @ xmath13 @ xmath14 with @ xmath15 , and @ xmath16 and @ xmath8 are ckm angles which are related to the wolfenstein angles @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 in the same way @ xcite . the penguin - to - penguin ratio @ xmath19 can be expressed as @ xmath20 . the physical quantities @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 expressed in this way are the same physical quantities without any dependence on ckm angles . for any given value of @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 the measurement of @ xmath12 and @ xmath23 at a point in the ( @ xmath17 , @ xmath18 ) - plane , expressed simply as @ xmath##24 } { ( ( 1 - \ bar \ eta ) ^ 2 + \ bar \ eta ^ 2 ) ( r _ b ^ 2 + r ^ 2 + ( r \ bar \ bar \ cos \ eta ) } \ end { 1 } \ ] ] @ xmath25 the penguin decay @ xmath26 has been introduced as @ xcite in the context of qcdf . the parameter can be expressed in the formula @ xmath27 } { a _ 2 + a ^ u _ 5 + r ^ \ pi _ \ , r ^ u _ 5 + r _ { [ a _ 1 + b _ 3 + 2 b _ 4 ] } , \ ] ] where we consider the potentially small error from electroweak penguin decay . a recent analysis gives @ xcite @ xmath28 where the parameter is an estimate of potentially large error corrections . in order to gain additional insight into the structure of hadronic @ xmath3 - decay ##s , it would be very useful to derive these parameters from the @ xmath3 - decay , by using other methods . in this case , we have considered them in a recent analysis of @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 ( @ xmat##h31 is the number of coefficients ) in ( [ rqcd ] ) . expanding these values to second order terms @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 we see that the uncalculable error corrections @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 do not appear in ( [ rqcd ] ) , to which they can apply second order @ xmath34 . from our experimental model parameters , one derives the central value @ xcite : @ xmath35 , which appears to be in very good agreement with the standard qcdf values at the second - to - leading level . after a second cross - check , one can derive @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 from @ xmath36 and @ xmath37 , corresponding to the central value @ xcite @ xmath38 , in agreement with the experimental model to the experimental value @ xmath39 . ] , although their values differ slightly from @ xmath40 ( see @ xcite for further details ) . it is possible to solve the problem by replacing the information from @ xmath12 with the information of @ xmath1 , best available from the ` ` non - standard ' ' mode @ xmath41. the value @ xmath16 of the # ##r given by @ xmath42 the real number , @ xcite @ xmath6 , and @ xmath43 by a function of @ xmath44 , @ xmath17 is related to @ xmath18 by @ xmath45 . the value @ xmath17 can also be determined from @ xmath12 to ( [ srhoeta ] ) , which can be written for @ xmath18 to [ @ xmath46 , \ nonumber \ end { 0 } \ ] ] with @ xmath47 the experimental observables @ xmath44 ( = @ xmath1 ) and @ xmath12 become @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 . the two experimental parameters @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 are known . the value of @ xmath18 as a function of @ xmath12 is shown in fig . [ 1 : etabspp ] , which shows the theoretical results from the experimental parameters @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 in qcdf . since the uncertainty of @ xmath22 is in ( [ etataus ] )only at second glance , it turns out that this effect is very small in contrast to @ xmath21 . in the case of @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 as above , they may in fact exist , but they are ruled out by the standard definition of the ut ( see @ xcite for further details ) . after considering the effect of @ xmath12 on the ut , let us consider now @ xmath23 . since @ xmath23 is an integral function of @ xmath22 , it is not possible to restrict the discussion to positive values of @ xmath22 . a positive value @ xmath22 is given by the perturbative method of qcdf , replacing the ##ening with the suppression . for positive @ xmath22 , @ xmath23 will be positive , like @ xmath48 , and a sign change in @ xmath22 will also change the value of @ xmath23 . in contrast to the case of @ xmath12 , the hadronic quantities @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 play a prominent role for @ xmath23 , as can be seen in ( [ crhoeta ]) . this will in general affect the interpretation of an experimental result for @ xmath23 . the effect of @ xmath23 is more transparent if we ignore the observed values and consider the values of @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 . an important example is the effect of the sm , obtained by taking @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 from the sm fit and comparing the experimental result for @ xmath23 with the experimental result as a function of @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 . in fig . [ fig : cpipi ] , a similar result is obtained by measuring values of the @ xmath23 in the ( @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 ) - plane , for the values of @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 . within the fig this shows the relationship between the parameters @ xmath40 and for @ xmath23 . as it has been shown in @ xcite , a variation on the parameter @ xmath23 exists , given by @ xmath49 with @ xmath50 and where the maximum is for @ xmath51 . if @ xmath52 ,no explicit upper bound is obtained . however , if @ xmath53 , then @ xmath54 is substituted for @ xmath55 , giving the general result @ xmath56 . for the special case @ xmath57 , @ xmath58 this implies @ xmath59 . the bound on @ xmath23 can be obtained by using information on @ xmath22 , as well as on @ xmath60 , and using ( [ barc ] ) . combining @ xmath58 and @ xmath61 yields @ xmath62 . as has been shown by @ xcite , the upper bound can be obtained from ( [ etataus ] ) for @ xmath63 @ xmath64 this expression is still _ exact _ and contains no information on the value @ xmath22 . for now @ xmath65 , we have @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 we emphasize that this upper bound on @ xmath18 depends only on the observables @ xmath44 and @ xmath12 and is therefore free of hadronic violation . since both @ xmath21 and @ xmath##22 although expected to be very accurate , we note that the upper limit ( [ etabound ] ) gives a very low bound , compared to the expected value of @ xmath18 itself ( see @ xcite for further details ) . we also note that the lower limit ( [ etabound ] ) gives the solution for the unitarity triangle in the limit of all real numbers , @ xmath68 . in other words , the model - based bounds for @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 are easily obtained by counting penguins and taking @ xmath69 when fixing the unitarity triangle from @ xmath12 and @ xmath1 . let us first focus on the first solution for @ xmath18 , which puts the minus sign in front of the square root of ( [ etataus ] ) followed by the plus sign . for positive @ xmath12 this solution is always greater than ( [ etataus ] ) and the solution ( [ etabound ] ) is negative . for @ xmath70 the second solution is a positive @ xmath18 , which is excluded by some constraint on the model ( for instance from @ xmath71 ) . because we have fixed thefor @ xmath16 , or @ xmath44 , the lower bound on @ xmath18 is equal to the upper bound on @ xmath72 . the constraint ( [ etabound ] ) can also be expressed as a lower bound on the variable @ xmath8 and a lower bound on @ xmath73 ( see @ xcite for further details ) . in figs . [ fig : etabound ] , we express the lower bound on @ xmath18 as a measurement of @ xmath12 for various values of @ xmath1 . from fig . [ fig : etabound ] we observe that the lower bound on @ xmath18 becomes smaller as values @ xmath12 or @ xmath1 increase . in fig . [ fig : utbound ] we consider the region of the @ xmath74 domain that can be constrained by the measurement of @ xmath1 and @ xmath12 with the constraint ( ( [ etabound ] ) . we also observe that the condition @ xmath75 , which is required for the constraint , could be easily determined @ xcite by measuring the constraint - induced cp - value of @ xmath7##6 , the u - state counterpart of the @ xmath77 mode @ xcite . in this mode , we have proposed strategies to obtain information about the interactions from cp violation observables in @ xmath0 decays , in the absence of hadronic contributions due to penguin pollution . in absence of the penguin pollution , an efficient use of self - induced cp violation in @ xmath0 decay , measured by @ xmath12 , can be made by combining it with the corresponding contributions from @ xmath2 , @ xmath1 , to obtain the unitarity penguin parameters @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 . the sensitivity on the hadronic contributions , which are typical values @ xmath78 , @ xmath79 , is very low . in particular , there are no first - order corrections in @ xmath22 . for large values of @ xmath22 the sensitivity is negligible . concerning our penguin parameters , from @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 , they are calculated directly in the qcdf model . to validate our model predictions , we have calculated these parameters from the @ xmath29 and @ x##math30 ##0 , which has a good ability to calculate the uncalculable power corrections , in the above example . as an alternative approach , we have also tried to extract @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 from the @ xmath3 and ##s , such as @ xmath36 and @ xmath37 , based on the su ( 2 ) model . with these two different approaches , we get a good result in determining these hadronic parameters . i thank the authors for their support and i am especially grateful to gerhard buchalla for the very good results . this approach is approved by the dfg - directive bu 1391 / 1 - 2 . t . kobayashi and t . maskawa , prog . * 87 * ( 1973 ) 652 . n . cabibbo , phys . * 87 * ( 1963 ) 531 . s . aubert _ et al . _ [ babar collaboration ] , phys . rev . lett . * 87 * ( 2001 ) 091801 . s . abe _ et al . _ [ belle collaboration ] , phys . * 87 * ( 2001 ) 091802 . _ j - group , + http : / / www . sl##ac . berkeley . edu / xorg / hfag / g . buchalla and a . s . safir , ph - ph / 0406016 ; a . s . safir , ph - ph / 0311104 . g . buchalla and a . s . safir , phys . * 51 * ( 2004 ) 021801 ##1 . wolfenstein , phys . rev . lett . * 51 * ( 1983 ) 1945 ; a . l . smith , _ et al . _ * 51 * ( 1994 ) 3433 . j . beneke _ et al . _ , _ * 606 * ( 2001 ) 245 ckmfitter working group , lp2003 conference , dec . 2003 , http : / / ckmfitter . in2p3 . org
