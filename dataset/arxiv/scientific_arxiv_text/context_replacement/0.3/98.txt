close - packed chains on nonadsorbing solvent molecules form the so - called ` ` polymer brushes ' ' @ xcite . these molecules find many practical applications @ xcite , e . g . as lubricants @ xcite , for surface protection @ xcite , for tuning of temperature and surface tension @ xcite , for improving the biocompatibility of materials @ xcite , for protective surfaces against chemical adsorption ( ` ` nonfouling ' ' ' ) in the cellular environment @ xcite , microfluidic systems for biomolecule separation @ xcite , etc . the theoretical description of the conformations of macromolecules in these polymer films and their interactions has been an active area of research since ( e . g . , @ xcite ; for early reviews see @ xcite . also the interaction of the brushes with either the solvent molecules ( e . g . @ xcite ) or globular proteins @ xcite and / or other nanoparticles ( e . g . , @ xcite ) has attracted much recent interest . however , in other areas of research there will always be other polymer films in the solution , interacting with the polymers of the solution .this interaction has received much less attention , apart from the case where a liquid brush reacts with a hot solid melt @ xcite . the latter case is particularly interesting because there is very little interaction of the free chains in the melt and the free chains in the brush , if their chemical nature is known ( ` ` wetting autophobicity ' ' @ xcite ) . in particular , the theory @ xcite , self - consistent field @ xcite and simulation @ xcite have shown partial penetration of free chains into moderately dense solutions of identical chemical nature in non - liquid solutions when the monomer mole fraction of solution approaches that of the brush , and this phenomenon has been confirmed experimentally @ xcite . of course , when the solvent solution is very dilute , the solvent provides a large energy loss for penetration of free chains into it and this reduces the grafting density that can be achieved when one prepares the brush by removing chains from it @ xcite ( see also some attempts to demonstrate this phenomenon by simulation @ xcite ) . similarly , since typically the energy lost by the brush itself when it is wet is of the order of @ xmath22 ##1 @ xcite , there is a nonzero probability that brush chains areaway from the solid solution surface and are subsequently removed from the brush @ xcite . however , the cases studied so far point to the fact that ( apart from the surface area ) the chains in the bulk and those in the solution are identical . it is important , however , to consider the more complex situation when the free chains and those in the solution differ in their physical nature . then the problem of separation ( traditionally modelled by introducing a lewis - acid @ xmath1 - brush @ xcite ) between the two types of molecules arises . then , there is also no need to assume that the length @ xmath23 of the grafted chains , and the length @ xmath0 of the free chains are equal . such situations ( in particular , when the bulk and the free chains overlap each other , @ xmath24 ) are of great interest for many applications such as chemical engineering , antifouling agents @ xcite , etc . however , to the best of our knowledge , no systematic study of the effects of the various molecules ( @ xmath25 and the concentration of the free chains @ xmath26 ) on the rate of absorption and the penetration depth has been performed so far . thepresent section on simulation and density functional theory ( dft ) techniques in an effort to fill this gap . in section [ model ] we describe the model and comment on some numerical results ; section [ theory ] presents our simulation approach which includes both static and dynamic models ( ddft ) of dft as well as self - consistent field theory ( scft ) calculations . the numerical results are described in section [ results _ paper ] . section [ summary ] contains a summary and comments . at grafting density @ xmath27 and free chains of length @ xmath28 at equilibrium : ( left ) absorption at @ xmath29 , and ( right ) expulsion at @ xmath30 .

[ results _ fig ] , title = " fig : " ] we have used a coarse grained off - axis bead spring at @ xcite to generate the free chains in our model . as far as for practical applications in a biological context , thegrafted chains are used @ xcite , we restrict ourselves to the @ xmath31 of the grafted chains . the polymer chain consists of two chains of length @ xmath23 stretching from one end to a flat structureless surface . the equilibrium bonded length is described by the fene ( strongly coupled linear elastic ) potential , @ xmath32 \ ] ] with @ xmath33 . thus the equilibrium bond length between nearest neighbor brush and @ xmath34 . here and in what follows we take the maximal extension of the brush , @ xmath35 , as our bond length while the potential strength is described in terms of kinetic energy @ xmath36 where @ xmath37 is the boltzmann constant . the nonbonded interactions between brush and polymer chain , are described by the shear potential , @ xmath38 - [ \ exp [ - \ { ( 1 - r _ { min } ) ] \ ; , \ ] ] with @ xmath39 . for the case of polymer - brush , @ xmath40 , polymer - brush , @ xmath41 , and brush - brush , @ xmath42 interactions . in our present study we use the @xmath43 , @ xmath44 ( that is , in the good diffusion regime with only weak surface interactions ) . for @ xmath45 the polymer chains are absorbed by the brush whereas for @ xmath46 the bulk brush pulls them into the bulk . note that we have only the compatibility parameter @ xmath1 simply as @ xmath47 , and do not include the coordination number ( which is ) when one has lattice parameter @ xcite . the density of the container is @ xmath48 . the polymer chains are tethered to the sites which form a triangular periodic pattern on the surface whereby the average distance between grafting sites is @ xmath35 . achieving the highest grafting density @ xmath49 yields @ xmath50 brush segments , if the polymer chains are anchored at distance @ xmath35 , and @ xmath51 , i . e . , @ xmath52 brush segments , if the diffusion constant , i . e . , the distance between adjacent polymer chains on the surface is close to @ xmath53 . note that @ xmath54 corresponds to a container where the bulk concentration in the solvent on the wall is close to the densityof a polymer melt while @ xmath55 would correspond to a highly concentrated polymer melt . for the chain model , @ xmath56 corresponds to good boundary conditions since the theta - ratio for the ( dilute ) solution of polymer melt in the model , viz . [ fene ] - [ morse ] has been calculated @ xcite and @ xmath57 . in all our simulations we use brushes formed by a melt composed of @ xmath31 as solvent whereas the number of free chains @ xmath58 of each @ xmath0 ( where @ xmath0 spans the interval @ xmath59 ) is chosen such that the total number of free chain molecules is constant and is equal to @ xmath60 . for a certain solvent @ xmath61 , however , we also vary the concentration of free chains in the solvent by varying their number @ xmath58 in the interval @ xmath62 . thus , the mole fraction @ xmath63 of @ xmath64 - free chains is varied between @ xmath65 . note that , as usual , solvent terms are not explicitly included @ xcite . simulations which includes them in @ xcite would yield very similar2 . for a polymer brush with free chains of lengths @ xmath31 these properties are obtained from the @ xmath66 monte carlo steps ( experiments ) per monomer . the monte carlo algorithm consists of two steps whereby a monomer is chosen at random and one tries to displace it to a second randomly chosen position @ xmath67 regarding the current position . we use periodic boundary conditions in the @ xmath68 direction and the hard walls in the @ xmath69 direction . two different versions of the polymer brush with free chains of length @ xmath28 , are shown in fig . [ snapshots _ fig ] for the case of good , @ xmath29 , and poor , @ xmath30 , compatibility with the polymer brush . we use the dft to calculate density profiles of free and grand polymer chains . this has been described in detail in several publications , so that we briefly see its most important results . the starting point of the dft treatment is the expression for the grand polymer chain , @ xmath70 , as a function of the density profiles of free and grafted chains , @ xmath71 and @ xmath72, , ( @ xmath73 , where @ xmath74 is the dimensions of the polymer segments ) . the functional @ xmath70 is related to the total potential energy functional , @ xmath75 , via the legendre equation : @ xcite @ xmath76 = d [ \ phi _ { ( { \ textbf } { r } _ p ) , \ phi _ o ( { \ textbf } { r } _ p ) ] + \ phi _ { \ alpha = r , p } \ int _ { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } \ phi _ { \ alpha } ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } ) d _ { \ alpha } ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } ) , \ phi { r } \ ] ] where @ xmath77 is the force constant , which in the first case is due to the quasi - force like interaction of the polymer segments with the cell . , @ xmath78 , where @ xmath79 for @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 respectively , with the relations as for @ xmath8##2 . therefore , the innermost ( @ xmath83 ) bead of each free segment is connected to the other via a grafting potential @ xmath84 = \ delta ( x _ 1 ) $ ] , where @ xmath85 . note that the double bond of the free and bound segments is absent from the last part of equation . ( [ 2 ] ) because the dft calculations are required for a large number of the free and bound segments in order to perform the mc ##e : @ xmath86 and @ xmath87 . in the above , @ xmath88 is the surface area and @ xmath89 is the box area . the total potential energy functional is divided into full and partial parts , @ xcite with the excess given by : @ xmath90 = \ phi _ { \ alpha = r , p } \ , \ { \ int _ { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } \ phi _ { \ alpha } ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } ) [ \ ln \ phi _ { \ alpha } ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \2 } ) - [ ] + \ left \ int { { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } \ beta _ { \ alpha } ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } ) \ _ { ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } ) \ , \ } . \ end { fideal } \ ] ] where the bonding potential @ xmath91 for the two chains is written as follows : @ xmath92 = \ beta _ { n = 1 } ^ { n - 1 } \ frac { \ left ( | { \ textbf } { r } _ { - { \ textbf } { r } _ { n + 1 } | - n _ 1 ) } { - \ { b _ { n } ^ { 2 } } , \ end { vbond } \ ] ] with a similar expression for free energy , with @ xmath23 replaced by @ xmath0 . this bonding potential connects the chains to a single point @ xmath93 . the excess part of the total free energy is written as a sum of neutral ( or gas ) and neutral terms , with the excesscomputed using the weighted density distribution and the results obtained by mean - field approach , using fig . ( 12 ) - ( 13 ) from ref . @ xcite ; for the sake of brevity we do not reproduce these results exactly . the integral of the grand total probability density with respect to @ xmath72 gives the weighted density distribution for the two chains which can be integrated over grafting and bound wave - functions to yield the following expression for the density distribution of the @ xmath94th group of the first chain : @ xcite @ xmath95 where @ xmath96 , \ { { ipz } \ ] ] with @ xmath97 the two propagators in eq . ( [ phipi ] ) , @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 ##9 from the core ( @ xmath100 ) and the bound ( @ xmath83 ) groups of the chain , respectively . they are related via the relations given by fig . ( 23 ) - ( 24 ) of ref . @ xcite . the value of @ xmath101 in fig . ( [ phipi ] )is used to ensure that the @ xmath94th segment density profile is equal to @ xmath102 . the total segment density profile for the grafted molecules is given by : @ xmath103 the equilibrium density profiles for the dynamics of the bound chains can be obtained in a similar way , by minimizing the grand total energy functional with respect to @ xmath71 and integrating over long - length chain transfer functions . the dft equations given above are solved simultaneously to obtain the segment density profiles for free and bound chains . the equations are solved iteratively using picard method , @ xcite with the step size along the @ xmath69 ##4 taken to be 0 . 0325 . the above method produces equilibrium segment density profiles for a wide range of interaction parameters . in addition to the known structural parameters , we have also studied the dynamics of the adsorption of bound molecules into the brush , and the change of the interaction energy between bound and grafted molecules from repulsive to attractive . to this end , we have employed the ddft approach , which is a dynamical extension of the dft approach . @ xcite computer simulations have indicated that the segment density profiles of the graf##ted ##s are the measures of the strength of the bond between free and segment chains . therefore , in our ddft , we take @ xmath104 to be time independent and based on the time evolution of the segment density density , @ xmath105 . the time evolution of the segment density profile of free chains is given by the following equation : @ xcite @ xmath106 where @ xmath107 is the non - negative initial chemical potential , and dimensionless : @ xmath19 is defined according to @ xmath108 , where @ xmath109 is the diffusion coefficient . initial density profile @ xmath110 corresponds to the probability distribution of free chains at the reaction force , i . e . @ xmath30 . at @ xmath111 , the chain - free polymer attraction is ` ` ` ' on ' ' , i . e . we get @ xmath112 . the time - dependent segment density profile is then defined according to the eq . ( [ phipzt ] ) , with the time - dependent chemical potential given by : @ xmath113 where @ xmath114 is obtained by the##stituting the time - dependent density @ xmath105 into the expression for @ xmath115 ( and ) for the propagators @ xmath116 and @ xmath117 . we calculate q . ( [ phipzt ] ) using taylor - nicholson equations . @ xcite shows that eq . ( [ phipzt ] ) takes the form of a continuity equation with the density ( current density ) given by @ xmath118 . the fact that the ddft method estimates @ xmath105 via a time - based equation guarantees the conservation of the total number of electrons in the system , which is consistent with the above set - up . in order to compare the results of the ddft method with kinetic mc data , we set the value of @ xmath109 back to 0 and calculate the conversion factor between ddft dimensionless data and kinetic mc number of electrons for a particular set of values @ xmath0 and @ xmath26 . comparisons for the two values of @ xmath0 and @ xmath26 are made with the same conversion factor , thus setting @ xmath109 to be directly related to the @ xmath##0 and @ xmath26 . with the aim of shedding new light on the physical aspects of the diffusion process , we have also performed self - consistent field theory ( scft ) calculations of the structural properties as a function of the interaction energy between the surface of the solid and the free chains ( in scft , this interaction is described by the equation @ xmath1 which is calculated in the standard form from the corresponding well well - depths : @ xmath119 ) . the main motivation behind carrying out scft calculations is the fact that this approach provides a more straightforward way to partition the free chains into entropic and elastic components , thus providing a quantitative ( to dft ) description of the adsorption process . the fundamental properties of the scft approach are already known , @ xcite and can not be reproduced here for the sake of brevity . once again , the density profiles for free and mixed chains are calculated in terms of the propagators , the most significant difference from the dft approach is that instead of the equation of motion , one uses the incompressibility equation to set up the equations for the density profiles , which are once again solved iteratively using picards ##n . for example , the equation for the density profile of the free chain segments takes the form : @ xmath120 where the density constant @ xmath121 is derived from the density constant @ xmath102 , and @ xmath122 , with @ xmath123 . the hard core potential @ xmath124 is independent of the segment length and acts as a lagrange multiplier for the incompressibility condition , such that the free space is completely empty and no net diffusion occurs . the density profile of the free chain segments is obtained in a similar way . once the parameters are calculated , we can then obtain the mass and energy of the free chains ( relative to other chain components ) as follows @ xcite : @ xmath125 @ xmath126 where @ xmath127 is the bulk mass fraction of free chains . in fig .

[ den _ nobst _ fig ] , title = " fig : " ] inside the polymer brush whereas the much more highly reactive species @ xmath137 remain evenly distributed in the space above the brush surface . since most of the reactive species with activity @ xmath0 remain dispersed inside the brush , their density profile could not change sufficiently for the time of the simulationrun . next , we observe the large size fluctuations in @ xmath128 . for these cases all layers are largely removed from the container whereby the process is linear as far as the free chain of @ xmath0 is concerned . for the less dense brush @ xmath138 , the phase diagram displays the large oscillations at the wall , suggesting some layering occurs in the vicinity of the container wall - fig . [ _ _ _ _ fig ] c , d . in these cases one observes pronounced boundary effects at the polymer container wall , near the brush . however , the inhomogeneity of @ xmath128 near the wall at @ xmath139 has no effect on @ xmath128 in the region of the polymer container , the small part of @ xmath128 space between the brush and the confining layer at @ xmath139 is large enough to show the finite - size fluctuations associated with the large linear dimension of the simulation data in @ xmath140direction . one should note also the strong correlation between 2d and dft results . in particular , the thin lines , indicating the latter , may hardly be distinguished from themonte carlo data ( thick brush ) in fig . [ phi _ l _ fig ] a , b . the most significant discrepancy between model and simulation is observed in the density profile in the bulk of the brush surface , where dft method overestimates the concentration . this difference is mainly due to the fact that in the dft method the bond lengths are determined via delta - waves to a constant value of @ xmath141 , whereas in the simulations the bonds are allowed to vibrate under fene potential , fig . ( [ fene ] ) . for @ xmath61 , fig . [ dens _ nobst _ fig ] shows a very similar behavior of the density profile for the case of an increasing free chain concentration ( given by the number of free chains @ xmath142 and above ) . expectedly , for @ xmath143 ( which corresponds to monomer concentration @ xmath144 ) and @ xmath27 , the free chains remain constant in the bulk of the brush as the brush interior is almost entirely empty . however , when the non - free chain concentration increases to @ xmath145 , the mc data( not shown here ) indicate the penetration of the free chains into the brush with diffusion no free chains in the brush penetrate the polymer brush even at the high concentration of @ xmath146 . with increasing grafting density and / or free chain concentration , the relationship between dft and theory deteriorates significantly , with the theory underestimating the degree of penetration of free chains into the brush ( see section of fig . [ the _ amount _ % ] . ) , which is probably due to the poor tarazona - weighting function employed in our dft calculations . it is also known that at higher densities it would be more appropriate to use the formula from the fundamental molecular theory . @ xcite indeed , one such formula has been successfully used to study adsorption and retention of spherical particles in polymer , @ xcite . with polymerization , @ xmath0 of the free chains for two grafting samples . the symbols indicate dft coefficients . the expression @ xmath147 corresponds to the _ % _ % of tip - tip ##ization ( cf . , [ crit _ sect ] ) .

[ crit _ fig] , [ = " fig : " ] as a remarkable example of the absorption in the brush we note the existence of a _ _ _ coefficient of compatibility @ xmath16 between the brush and free chains . [ crit _ fig ] a shows brush and free chain density profiles for various polymer chain lengths and the relative value of the brush - brush attraction strength ( @ xmath164 for mc ##ft and @ xmath169 for scft calculations ) . although experimental and theoretical results differ significantly , there is a strong theoretical difference in that the energy curves , regardless of the size @ xmath0 of the free chains , all intersect in two single points ( inside and outside the brush ) . the dft approach gives exactly the same results albeit for a smaller @ xmath170 ( not shown here ) . [ crit _ fig ] b shows scft calculations for the excess energy and for the free energy per monomer ( given by viz . ( [ entropy ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) , respectively ) as a function of @ xmath166 . one notes here that all the energy curves intersect in a single point , corresponding to @ xmath171 , and allthe polar forces pass to a minimum at this point . therefore , the entropic curves corresponding to the polymer chains located ` ` inside ' ' and ` ` outside ' ' the lines ( as defined earlier ) converge at the end point of @ xmath166 as shown in the figure of fig . [ crit _ fig ] 2 . starting from @ xmath172 there is only a distance @ xmath69 from the complex plane where the local concentration of polymer solutions is independent of polymer length @ xmath0 , provided @ xmath173 is a constant for all @ xmath0 , the value of @ xmath172 itself is assumed to depend on the concentration and / or the length of the polymer chain @ xmath23 . we use scft ##s to see how the ` ` local ' ' concentration of @ xmath172 varies with @ xmath133 and @ xmath23 over a broad range : @ xmath174 and @ xmath13 . we find that it increases as @ xmath175 with the same chain concentration @ xmath133 , and decreases as @ xmath176 with polymer length @ x##math23 of the grafted polymer ( in the latter case , the electron density is chosen such that the typical scaling factor for linear polymers @ xmath177 is kept constant ) . here we present our experimental and theoretical models for the rate of polymer adsorption / diffusion into , and out of the solution . with absorption time @ xmath178 after an instantaneous change of the interaction between brush and free chains . for @ xmath27 and the averaging was performed over @ xmath179 and . the figure shows the absorption times for different areas @ xmath0 of free chains . the total number of free chain areas @ xmath60 is kept constant .

[ kin _ fig ] , [ = " fig : " ] fig . [ kin _ fig ] b shows the variation of the initial relative concentration , @ xmath154 , with elapsed time @ xmath178 and an instantaneous increase of the interaction between brush and free chains . as expected , the expulsion of the polymer from the sample and the initial switching off of brush - free interactions proceeds much faster than the filling kinetics . the reaction , which is visible from the right to fig . [ kin _ fig ] c , goes through an extremely rapid increase toward a steady state of @ xmath154 whereby the smaller species absorb more than those with larger @ x##math0 . from the intersection of the tangent to the most . ##ening of @ xmath154 and the saturation , one may calculate the characteristic times of molecules @ xmath19 as functions of @ xmath0 - fig . [ kin _ fig ] a . the results are presented for all values of the chain length , and one finds that ddft ##s are generally in good agreement with the mc ##ft . this also holds in fig . [ kin _ fig ] b where indeed the theory is in good agreement with that for @ xmath31 . for the concentration of free grafted chains ( @ xmath23 = 64 , @ xmath181 = 6 . 2 ) , the simulations are available and plotted against the time @ xmath178 is the coefficient of absorption for the concentration of free chains with @ xmath61 . the log - log plot shows that @ xmath154 increases by the time @ xmath182 . the characteristic times @ xmath183 are plotted on the graph against the number of free chains @ xmath58 . one gets @ xmath184 . ( b ) the same results . ( a ) but without the ` `critical ' ' attraction @ xmath147 and fixed @ xmath185 where @ xmath186 . the ratio @ xmath187 ( figure ) .

( b ) the same as . ( a ) , for the ` ` critical ' ' attraction @ xmath147 and fixed @ xmath185 where @ xmath186 . the exponent @ xmath187 ( figure ) . [ bs _ fig ] , title = " fig : " ] two models are shown . nonwithstanding , for both values of @ xmath23 , one also sees three variations in the dependence of @ xmath19 and @ xmath0 . in the firstregime , the absorption time grows rapidly and essentially continuously with @ xmath0 ( up to @ xmath188 for the shorter chain and @ xmath189 for the longer one ) . by considering the data presented in fig . [ _ _ fig ] below , one sees that this nearly linear regime corresponds to the point when @ xmath11 of absorbed chains is less than or equal to the average distance between the grafting edges . when @ xmath0 ( and , consequently , @ xmath11 ) is increased beyond the above values , one enters the second regime where the rate of @ xmath19 , while still nearly linear , is markedly slower . we see this slowing down as a halmark of the surface friction of the penetrating coils when their rate of gyration exceeds the diameter of the holes in the cutting brush . this regime continues up to the point where the lengths of absorbed and free chains are equal . at this point , for @ xmath190 , the third regime is introduced , , where the absorption time is essentially independent of the free chain length . one might see as an example of the change in the rate of free chain penetration into the brush with the @ xmat##h191 whereby , the material flattens inside the grafted material allowing to gain in thermal energy . [ dens _ fig ] a shows experimental and theoretical results for the absorption rates for @ xmath31 , @ xmath61 , and the distribution of the concentration @ xmath192 . both mc and ddft data show that at low and intermediate times the time regime of the absorbed amount follows the power law @ xmath182 . the absorption kinetic exponent @ xmath183 is smaller as the concentration increases ( see inset ) , although the value of @ xmath154 at the end of the intermediate time regime is larger for the concentration of @ xmath58 . this result is somewhat counter - intuitive , as one would expect the driving force for absorption ( and , therefore , the absorption rate ) to increase with increasing concentration of free chains . a slowing down of absorption rate with the size @ xmath0 and size @ xmath133 of the free chains has been also observed @ xcite in a porous material ( activated carbon ) which resembles in certain respects the glass brush . in fig . [ mc _ fig ] b we see the distribution of the absorbed amount ,@ xmath186 , for the critical concentration @ xmath193 - . [ crit _ fig ] . we found out that this well known power law value of @ xmath154 was observed only for this critical value of @ xmath42 whereas for @ xmath194 where all of our kinetic measurement was done , a positive @ xmath195 value was observed - see . [ kin _ fig ] - . thus , in a sense , the second type of experiment underlines the important role of the critical compatibility between brush and free chains . of free chains with time , after a change from @ xmath196 to @ xmath197 from dft data . the result is given in polar coordinates . here the mean is @ xmath198 and the time t corresponds to 25000 mcs . the polymer brush is observed at @ xmath199 . ( 2 ) change of the concentration of free chains into the polymer brush with time for two samples @ xmath200 i . e . , @ xmath201 , and @ xmath61 . [ en _ kin _ fig ] , [ = " fig : " ]of free chains with time elapsed since the change from @ xmath196 to @ xmath197 from dft data . the time is expressed in polar coordinates . here the current concentration @ xmath198 and the concentration difference correspond to 25000 mcs . the polymer brush is stationary at @ xmath199 . ( b ) comparison of the movement of free chains into the polymer brush with data for two concentrations @ xmath200 i . e . , @ xmath201 , and @ xmath61 . [ kin _ 3d _ fig ] , [ = " : : " ] in order to shed more light on the observed behavior , fig . [ kin _ 3d _ fig ] shows ddft results for the time - dependent density flux @ xmath105 ( @ xmath58 = 24 , left panel ) and flux @ xmath202 ( @ xmath58 = 24 and above , right panel ) . in the left panel , comparison of the ` ` ridges ' ' of @ xmath105 at all times the principal ridge , initially located in the space above the brush , moves gradually inside , while another ( smaller ) ridge is located inthe outer ( bare ) wall and gradually decreases when not in the bulk . from the right side , we can see that for higher concentrations ( @ xmath58 = 32 ) the flux increases with the same concentration one inside the brush and at shorter times ( thus explaining higher initial values of @ xmath154 seen in fig . [ des _ fig ] for lower values of @ xmath58 ) , while the process is slower outside the brush at longer times . the latter effect is probably due to the mobility at higher concentrations and to the difference of the @ xmath183 with @ xmath58 shown in the inset of fig . [ dens _ fig ] . in this experiment we studied a scarcely known but important aspect of oligomer and linear molecular dynamics in a thin film - the existence of ( more or less ) stable interactions between species in the bulk and the chains . starting from oligomers ( mono - and dimers ) and going up to chain lengths @ xmath0 which are twice the length @ xmath23 of the grafted molecule , we then studied the conformation of the active species , the bulk , @ xmath154 , and the bulk (the length ( into the polymer brush ) and the concentration of the free chains for the cases of moderately to very thin polymer brushes . in addition , by combining monte carlo simulations with dft and scft calculations , we have also extended the range of concentration of the free chains to @ xmath13 in order to test more comprehensively our hypothesis . the most important , and - to some extent - unexpected properties of linear polymer absorption in a polymer brush that we find are : * the dramatic change of adsorbed chains @ xmath7 with _ linear _ chain _ @ xmath0 , and * the dramatic change of absorption kinetics with growing size ( i . e . , with the increase of the concentration gradient or density ) of the free chains besides these structural and dynamic properties of polymer absorption in brushes , we find that both the absorbed macromolecules and the brush itself largely change their structure and concentration , as shown in curves like @ xmath203 and the average absorption profile @ xmath104 , for different size @ xmath0 and concentration @ xmath26 of the free chains , and different amount @ xmath42 of attraction to the grafted chains . in particular , thedegree to which the density profile @ xmath104 is affected by absorption is found to be well below that predicted in the earlier theoretical predictions @ xcite . nontheless , but within these theoretical changes we observe a slight contraction of @ xmath104 but small enough of @ xmath154 . @ xmath104 gradually increases its extension roughly to that corresponding to zero expansion of free chains with growing @ xmath154 . an important finding which still requires deeper understanding is the possible existence of a critical attraction @ xmath204 ( i . e . , α - oligomer ##ism @ xmath205 ) . at @ xmath206 we observe both in mc as well as in dft / scft that the entropy of all absorbed species has a maximum because of their size @ xmath0 whereas their size experiences a minimum . the critical attraction @ xmath205 is manifested by the existence of unique distance from the molecular plane where all the density profiles of the free chains intersect . moreover , at @ xmath205 the rate of free chain absorption into the brush follows a similar linear power relationship with at @ xmath207 . thus , thefurther research is needed until all these fascinating new features are better understood . last at hand , we have the existence of three distinct regimes in the theory of free chain absorption as far as the size of the free chains @ xmath0 is concerned . in the first regime the characteristic time for absorption @ xmath19 grows rapidly with oligomer length @ xmath0 as long as the oligomer size @ xmath208 is smaller than the separation between two atoms . the second regime is marked by a slower growth of @ xmath19 with @ xmath0 and ends abruptly at @ xmath209 . the third regime of absorption kinetics starts for @ xmath180 ( i . e . , the entire free chain does not exist within the brush ) and is characterized by a nearly constant @ xmath19 as far as length @ xmath0 is concerned . moreover , this # ##ening behavior has been experimentally observed for absorption in porous media @ xcite . one of these , ( a . r . ) , acknowledges support from patent no . bi314 / 2009 . another , ( s . r . s . ) , acknowledges support from the alexander von humboldt institute , germany .m . simon , j . science ( physics ) * 12 * , 983 ( 1977 ) . m . de gennes , proteins , * 13 * , 1069 ( 1980 ) . v . a . skvortsov , v . a . gorbunov , v . a . pavlushkov , v . a . zhulina , v . a . borisov , and v . a . pryamitzyn , polym . 5 * , 1706 ( 1988 ) . j . cosgrove , j . smith , j . de lahr , f . leermakers , and j . j . a . scheutjens , proteins * 20 * , 1692 ( 1988 ) . j . a . milner , j . j . witten , and j . c . smith , proteins * 21 * , 2610 ( 1988 ) . s . muthukumar and r . c . smith , proteins * 22 * , 965 ( 1989 ) . m . murat and j . a . grest , proteins * 23 * , 4054 ( 1989 ) . y . c . lai andj . klein , ann . chem . phys . * 101 * , 9288 ( 1991 ) . j . a . milner , nature * 251 * , 905 ( 1991 ) . a . halperin , j . tirrell , and j . a . klein , adv . sci . * 93 * , 101 ( 1992 ) . j . szleifer and m . a . carignano , adv . chem . phys . * 93 * , 94 ( 1996 ) . j . klein , ann . * 94 * , 581 ( 1996 ) . g . s . grest and m . murat , quantum _ monte carlo and _ dynamics _ in computer science _ k . klein , columbia univ . press , new york , 1995 , pp . 476 -
