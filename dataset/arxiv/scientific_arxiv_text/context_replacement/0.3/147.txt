one of the long - standing problems in nuclear many - body theory has been the convergence of the perturbative expansion for the nuclear reactions @ xmath3 ( or equally , that of effective energy ) resulting from the nuclear reactions to be used in nuclear physics calculations . generally , the energy terms which appear in a perturbative expansion for @ xmath3 are displayed by means of feynman - like diagrams , examples of such diagrams are shown in fig . [ fig : fig1 ] . it is well known that the typical nucleus - nucleus interaction @ xmath4 involves strong interactions of short range , which makes a perturbative expansion in terms of @ xmath4 interactions . to overcome this problem , one takes into account the short - range interactions through the solution of the bethe - brueckner - goldstone equation and considers the perturbation in terms of the nuclear reaction at @ xmath5 . the wavy lines in fig . [ fig : fig1 ] represent the @ xmath5 interactions . however , higher - order perturbative expansion in terms of the @ xmath5 - interactions , must be large , and the convergence of the perturbat##ive ##q is or not possible at all . actually , barrett and kirson @ xcite showed that higher - order solutions to the effective interaction were possible , and raised the question whether the perturbative born - schrdinger ( ms ) equations in terms of the hypothetical @ xmath5 - shell did exist at all . schucan and weidenmller @ xcite even pointed out that the order - to - order calculations of the effective interaction will ultimately diverge when so - called intruder states are introduced . the intruder states for nuclei like @ xmath6o and @ xmath7ca are four - particle - two - body core - intruder states . it ought however to be noted that for nuclei with many free electrons , e . g . the same mass area , such intruder state calculations may not be possible , and a two - body ( or many - body ) effective interaction defined within the @ xmath8 - shell itself , may lack the relevant degrees of freedom . most experimental calculations of @ xmath3 have been performed for nuclei outside the @ xmath8 - shell , with no valence electrons outside a @ xmath9o core . however , when thelimiting the scope of effects to those in the transition regions of calcium , lead or copper , one has to consider the fact that for effects like those shown in fig . [ 2 : fig1 ] , there are more intermediate states which contribute to each side of the effective interaction in e . g . the @ xmath10 - shell than in the @ xmath8 - shell . moreover , the energy difference between the two electron states is much smaller for those in the @ xmath10 - shell than for those around @ xmath9o . this leads to smaller energy levels which should be third - order or fourth - order respectively . thus , the combined action of the two effects could potentially deteriorate the order - by - order convergence ( if it does converge ) of the effective interaction . the only mechanism which could quench these effects , is the fact that the matrix elements of @ xmath5 ##o in the @ xmath10 - shell should in fact be weaker than those in the @ xmath8 - shell . the single - particle wave functions for the case of the fermi ##ons have smaller radii and , as the nucleon - nucleon interaction is of shorter range , the matrix elementsof @ xmath5 should be weaker for the heavier nuclei . the same conditions hold of and as well for the lead and lead interactions . it is then the scope of this work to study the structure of the effective interaction in terms of the mass of @ xmath0 , in order to assess whether higher - order contributions to the one - dimensional effective interaction decrease or increase as @ xmath0 increases . to do this , we calculate all non - folded and linked diagrams to first - order in the interaction @ xmath5 , and all higher - order linked diagrams to infinite order for the free regions beyond single - shell cores with @ xmath1 , @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 and @ xmath2 . the details of how to obtain these effective interactions are further discussed in the next section , along with our results and discussions . the concluding remarks are given in section three . there are currently two main approaches in the theory , to obtain the effective operator and effective interaction , each with its hierarchy of sub - approaches . one of these main approaches is the energy - dependent approach , known as brillouin - wigner field theory , while the rayleigh - po##hrdinger ( 2005 ) this article is for the energy independent approach . the above is the most commonly used approach in the literature @ xcite , an approach which we will also discuss here . it is a common practice in quantum theory to reduce the infinitely many degrees of freedom of the model space to those represented by a uniquely motivated subspace , the shell - model hilbert space . in this reduction of the model space , the action of the projection operator @ xmath14 on the model space and its variance @ xmath15 are used . the projection operators defining the limit and excluded middle are given by @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 with @ xmath18 being the boundary of the model space , and @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 , @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 . the transfer functions @ xmath23 are eigenfunctions of the classical hamiltonian @ xmath24 ( with variance @ xmath25 ) , where @ xmath26 is the kinetic potential and @ xmath27 the randomly chosen one - dimensional potential , in this work that of the harmonic potential (h . e . ) . the kinetic energy @ xmath28 will be calculated from @ xmath29 , @ xmath0 and the mass area . this is @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 , @ xmath32 , @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 mev for @ xmath1 , @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 and @ xmath2 , respectively . the resulting hamiltonian is then written as @ xmath35 with @ xmath36 , @ xmath4 and the n - nucleon ( nn ) orbital . then we can replace @ xmath4 with the @ xmath5 - orbital , which will be used as the starting point for our perturbative calculations . following the same procedure , we calculate the state spaces which are known , from both experimental and theoretical data , to be useful for calculations of particle - like kinetic energies in the mass area from @ xmath1 to @ xmath2 . these are the @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 energies for @ xmath3 and the mass area of @ x##math1 , the @ xmath39 , @ xmath40 and @ xmath41 orbits for @ xmath11 , the @ xmath42 , @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 and @ xmath45 orbits for electrons in the transition state of @ xmath12 and the @ xmath46 , @ xmath47 , @ xmath48 , @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 orbits for @ xmath13 . for these reasons , the single - core systems ( @ xmath51he , @ xmath9o , @ xmath52ca and @ xmath53sn ) have different numbers of proton and neutron , and the model spaces are the same for each proton and neutron . for , example , with @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 , the proton and neutron model spaces are different , i . e . the same @ xmath56 , @ xmath57 , @ xmath58 , @ xmath59 , @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 for the proton model , and @ xmath62 , @ xmath6##3 , @ xmath64 , @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 , @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 for the neutron model spaces . since the effective interaction notation we currently use is restricted to degenerate model spaces , we will make no attempt to derive for ourselves the effective proton - neutron interaction for these two model spaces . moreover , as discussed in ref . @ xcite , the multishell effective interaction must have strong non - hermiticities , or even weak if the h . q . notation is used . thus , for @ xmath1 to @ xmath13 we will consider the isospin @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 effective interactions , whereas for lead we restrict the discussion to @ xmath71 and @ xmath72 , where @ xmath73 is the product of the second isospin . for the proton model space , there are in total 24 known elements for the effective interaction of @ xmath1 , 15 for @ xmath11 , 195 for @ xmath12 , 353 for @ xmath13 , 711 for the neutron model space of @ xmath2 and353 for the proton model space of @ xmath2 . the effective interactions for @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 are listed in ref . @ xcite , and have been tested in electronic structure calculations and a direct comparison with the experimental results obtained for the atoms in these three groups . the spectra for isotopes of the same group will be discussed in @ xcite . having defined the proton model space , the next step in our calculation is to calculate the total correlation matrix @ xmath5 , given by @ xmath74 where @ xmath75 is the unperturbed energy of the interacting particles , and @ xmath76 is the unperturbed hamiltonian . for the bare nn , we use the one - boson - one potential operator a . in table 1 . 2 of ref . the operator @ xmath77 is the exclusion operator which prevents the interacting particles from moving into positions occupied by other particles . note that the exclusion operator used in the calculation of the @ xmath5 - matrix in this table is different from the @ xmath15 operator used in the calculation of the effective interactions . the definitionof the density operator for the @ xmath5 - matrix can be found in fig . @ xcite , where the so - called energy - exclusion principle has been used . this means that low - lying two - particle states are obtained by @ xmath78 from the intermediate states of the bethe - box eq . ( [ fig : betheg ] ) . for the case of the @ xmath8 - matrix this article refers to states with two nucleons in the @ xmath10 - shell . as a result , we have to include in our space expansion other special cases , such as ( 2 - 3 ) in fig . [ fig : fig1 ] , where the two intermediate states are those of the @ xmath10 - shell and the states for the corresponding state - space . the next step is to construct the so - called @ xmath79 - matrix of the effective energy and the @ xmath5 - matrix @ xmath78 . ] followed by @ xmath80 where we can replace @ xmath81 with @ xmath5 ( @ xmath5 replaces the - nn of @ xmath4 ) .the @ xmath79 - box is made up of un - folded diagrams which are irreducible and valence linked . a diagram is said to be irreducible if at every pair of interactions there is at least one interaction line and a particle state outside the model space . in a valence - linked diagram the interactions are mapped ( via the interactions ) to at least one valence line . note that a valence - linked diagram can be either folded ( consisting of a single piece ) or disconnected . in the final case of folded diagrams as well , the folded diagrams are said to cancel at @ xcite . this corresponds to the case of unlinked diagrams in the standard model @ xcite . we can then obtain an effective interaction @ xmath82 in terms of the @ xmath79 - box , with @ xcite @ xmath83 note also that the effective interaction @ xmath84 is defined for a given model of energy @ xmath75 , as is the case for the @ xmath5 - box as well . for large mass areas , we get @ xmath85 mev . the first iteration is then given by @ xmath86 in this case wedefine the @ xmath79 - box to consist of several diagrams through third order of the @ xmath5 - box , as discussed in ref . more than ten iterations are required in order to obtain a converged interaction interaction for the various components of @ xmath0 . for further details , see ref . @ xcite . in the calculation of the various diagrams , we relate the intermediate state excitations to @ xmath87 ##9 - energy , an approximation which is viable if one considers an nn gauge with a different gauge symmetry ( such as the bonn gauge described here ) , as discussed in sommermann _ . is the aim of this section to study the application of the various diagrams to @ xmath88 . as it would be somewhat confusing to discuss the effects for individual matrix elements ( recall that depending on the model - space there are tens to hundreds such matrix elements ) , we define number of matrix elements in @ xmath89 where the density matrix @ xmath90 applies to all two - particle states of the model - space under consideration , coupled to angular momentum @ xmath91 and isospin @ xmath26 and [ tab : tab2 ] we[ to start with the number of electrons , as this yields rather large numbers for the atomic numbers . ] . in the calculation method defined in this equation we have weighted the matrix elements by the factor @ xmath92 since this factor accounts for the behavior of two - dimensional structures with respect to the projection atomic numbers and occurs e . g . in the distribution of the energy if all the states are folded . it turned out , however , that the main features of the calculation discussed above are true as well , if this extra factor is dropped . for the factor @ xmath93 we will use @ xmath94 , which corresponds to the bare @ xmath5 diagrams , @ xmath95 , the @ xmath96 - box interaction terms up to the order of @ xmath5 without folded diagrams , and @ xmath97 ( @ xmath98 ) the effective energy of the @ xmath96 - box diagrams up to the ( second ) order in all folded diagrams derived from these @ xmath96 - boxes . note , that the average interaction in eq . ( [ 1 : aver1 ] ) includes all the matrix elements. in order to study if the averages are valid for all the nuclei we also define a mean value of diagonal matrix elements by @ xmath99 where the two indices @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 are again the two - dimensional elements of the model - space considered . beside these averages , which include the elements of isospin @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 , we can also report some cases where the index is applied to one of these isospins only . results for the mean values of diagonal matrix elements ( see fig . ( [ eq : aver1 ] ) ) are presented in table [ tab : tab1 ] , and averages including the off - diagonal matrix elements as well ( see fig . ( [ tab : aver2 ] ) ) are presented in table [ tab : tab2 ] for the other model - spaces considered . in these tables one sees very clearly that the mean values for the matrix elements are much less accurate for the model spaces referring to the nuclei . this trend can be observed independent of the approximation used to calculate @ xmath88 . this behavior reflects the fact that when the effective variance , calculated with inclusion of higher order terms , is ofthis , and also , as we mentioned already above , have weaker matrix elements for the free electrons of heavy systems as compared to the light systems . furthermore , we have several features which are valid regardless of the mass number and model being used : * the use of first - order @ xmath96 - box diagrams in @ xmath102 yields a strong advantage for the @ xmath69 ##6 elements and a disadvantage for @ xmath70 . this difference may be explained by the following argument : for the @ xmath70 channel , the major mechanism which accounts for the difference between first and second order , is provided by the core - polarization interaction in ( 2 - 3 ) of fig . [ fig : fig1 ] . however , in the @ xmath70 channel , the tensor ##ial contribution of the core - electron interaction is not very important , whereas in the @ xmath69 channel the contribution from the @ xmath103 - @ xmath104 partial interactions plays an important role in ladder - box diagrams , such as that of the molecular structures , or the particle - particle interaction diagram in ( 2 - 3 ) of fig . [ fig : fig1 ]. however , for many @ xmath105 and @ xmath69 particle - particle effective interactions , the particle - particle ladder is of the order of or larger than the core - spin diagram , but for @ xmath106 and @ xmath70 , the core - spin diagram and the @ xmath5 - matrix have the same contribution to the effective interactions . * the expansion of folded diagrams yields a general trend going from @ xmath102 to @ xmath97 . the trend is also much stronger in the @ xmath69 than in the @ xmath70 - elements , which can as well be understood from the presence of the particle - particle ladder ##s in the @ xmath69 states . from the results of @ xmath107 and @ xmath97 one observes a repulsion for the isospins . * due to this , due to the second - order terms in the folded - diagram expansion , the further addition of terms of third order in @ xmath5 yields an increase in @ xmath98 as compared to @ xmath97 . as for the results of @ xmath51he , theeffect of third - order interaction is very weak for the @ xmath70 states . this was also used by ref . @ xcite in the study of the spectra of nuclei with valence electrons being only neutrons and electrons . there the authors found that the spectra of e . g . @ xmath6o or @ xmath7ca states with either a second - order or third - order effective interaction were very similar . for calculations of the residual interaction for lead and lead , this is a gratifying result since it means that one needs only to evaluate the @ xmath79 - box to third order and for all the others . finally , in order to determine the convergence of the taylor expansion , we consider in table [ tab : tab1a ] the ratios obtained from the different ratios given in eq . ( [ eq : aver1 ] ) . these ratios are of course the same features which we have discussed above . they show , however , in a much different way that the different ratios are directly proportional to the quantum number which is given . this means that one can expect the convergence of the taylor expansion for the residual interaction to be as good ( or bad ) for all nuclei as forthe heavier nuclei are @ xmath9o , which is rarely used . for nuclear structure studies of light nuclei with mass numbers slightly different from the proton , one typically uses model - spaces , which are suitable for protons and electrons , and the residual interaction in the mean - field approximation . for these studies ( isospin @ xmath70 ) , the effects of terms of first order and @ xmath5 seem to be rather important with @ xmath97 containing a correction of about 10 percent of the average of @ xmath107 . however , it is encouraging to note that the inclusion of second order terms yields a correction of only 5 percent or even less . we have studied the behavior of the perturbation expansion for the effective interaction to be used in shell - theory studies of nuclei with various mass numbers . considering the mean value of the elements , we have found that the fact that the @ xmath5 - matrix becomes smaller in absolute value with increasing mass numbers , counterbalances the fact that there are no intermediate ##s to sum , and that the energy levels get smaller in each individual step of the effective interaction . however , the convergence of the perturbation expansion seems to be rather insensitive tothe highest mass region . we observe that various features of the spin - diagram structure , which have been observed for the mass region @ xmath108 , can also be observed in heavy nuclei . the nuclear structure calculations for heavy nuclei are mainly applied to the neutron - proton and proton - neutron residual ##s . for these @ xmath70 matrix elements the first - order and second - order averages are very similar , so that for this isospin , one can calculate the effective interaction by including all diagrams to second order plus folded diagrams to third order . for @ xmath69 , one only has to account for third - order contributions . the fact that third - order contributions tend to dominate for heavy nuclei , has also important consequences for nuclear structure , in particular in the mass regions of e . g . @ xmath109sn and @ xmath110pb . this means that the methods used to calculate the effective interaction for heavy nucleons , applied mainly to the mass regions of @ xmath9o and @ xmath52ca , can be applied to the mass regions of @ xmath109sn and @ xmath110pb , as described above in refs . @ x##cite . we gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the norfa ( norwegian foundation for advanced sciences ) , grant no . no . 018 / 00 . one of us , mhj , thanks the istituto trentino di cultura , italy and the research council of norway for their support . barrett j j and kirson j a 1970 _ nucl . phys . _ _ * 148 * 154 schucan t m and weidenmller m a 1972 _ ann . * 101 * 108 kuo t t s and osnes e 1990 _ phase - diagram theory of the critical temperature of quantum systems ( springer lecture notes in physics * 364 * ) _ lindgren i and holt s 1985 _ _ many - body theory _ ( springer : oslo ) hjorth - jensen m , kuo t t s and osnes e 1995 , phys . a , in preparation hjorth - jensen m , engeland j , holt s and osnes e 1995 , in preparation krenciglowa ##k j , kung c l , kuo t t s and osnes e 1976 _ ann . ny _ * 150 * 154 machleidt s 1989 _ adv . nucl . _ * 19 * 189 sommerman ##n j ,mther m , wang k j , kuo s t , and faessler s 1981 _ phys . _ c * c * 1765 engeland m , hjorth - hansen m , holt m , kristiansen a and osnes s 1995 , in press . the average values for the ##ized elements , according to eq .
