quantum - mechanical observations during an early epoch of inflation provide a plausible way to explain the energy - density perturbations observed for observed early inflation . while it has been known for quite some time that inflation is consistent with flat spatial hypersurfaces ( gott 1982 ; guth & weinberg 1983 ) , attention has initially focussed on models in which there are a very large number of @ xmath17 - folding during inflation , resulting in almost no flat spatial hypersurfaces for the observable universe of the early universe ( guth 1981 ; also , kazanas 1980 ; sato 1981a , b ) . this was , perhaps , done because of strong theoretical skepticism towards flat spatial hypersurfaces and their resulting uncertainty . however , to explain a very large number of @ xmath17 - folding during inflation it is necessary that the inflation model have a single dimensionless parameter ( j . a . gott , 1982 , 1994 ; banks et al . 1995 ) , which would provide an explanation . attempts to reconcile these favoured " flat spatial hypersurfaces with experimental evidence of a low value for the energy - energy density parameter @ xmath1 have concentrated on models in which one postulates the existence of a large##smological model @ xmath18 ( peebles 1984 ) . in the simplest non - @ xmath18 model one assumes a time - averaged ( yu 1970 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; zeldovich 1972 ) primordial energy spectrum for the adiabatic energy - momentum functions . such a spectrum is generated by quantum - mechanical fluctuations during the early stages of decay in a time - averaged model , assuming that the inflaton region is sufficiently small ( fischler , ratra , & susskind 1985 , and references therein ) . it has been demonstrated that these models are not consistent with the experimental data ( e . g . , stompor , grski , & banday 1995 ; ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ; ratra & sugiyama 1995 ; liddle et al . 1996b ; ganga , ratra , & sugiyama 1996b , and grs ) . an alternative , more popular of late , is to assume that the spatial hypersurfaces are not flat . in this case , the radius of curvature for the two spatial axes has a new length scale ( in addition to the hubble length ) , which requires a modification of the usual time -a scale - invariant spectrum ( ratra & peebles 1994 , hereafter rp94 ) . such a spectrum is generated by quantum - mechanical calculations during an event of inflation in an open - bubble bubble ( rp94 ; ratra & peebles 1995 , hereafter rp95 ; bucher et al . 1995 , for bgt ; lyth & woszczyna 1995 ; smith et al . 1995 , hereafter yst ) , provided that the inflaton potential of the bubble is sufficiently small . some gaussian and open - bubble bubble models have also been shown to be consistent with certain physical laws ( rp94 ; kamionkowski et al . 1994 ; grski et al . 1995 , hereafter grsb ; liddle et al . 1996a , hereafter llrv ; ratra et al . 1995 ; grs ) . the theory by itself is unable to fix the normalization amplitude for the angular - momentum distribution . therefore , the least expensive and most accurate method for the normalization of a cosmological model is to estimate the amplitude of the well - derived large - scale cmb spatial distribution by applying it tothe first model was discovered by the @ xmath0 - dmr experiment ( smoot et al . 1992 ) . previously , several open cold dark matter ( cdm ) models had been proposed in light of the @ xmath0 - dmr two - year results ( bennett et al . grsb investigated the cmb and angular spectra predicted by the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ) , and compared large - scale structure predictions of this dmr - normalized model to experimental data . cayn et al . ( 1996 ) provided a theoretical basis for the open model with a flat - line time - invariant spectrum ( wilson 1983 , appendix w83 ) , and wilson & bunn ( 1996 , appendix b ) described the possibility of additional sources of mass fluctuations ( bgt ; yst ) in the open - bubble inflation model . in this article , we study the observational data for a number of different cdm models . in particular , we employ the angular spectrum analysis technique developed by grski ( 1994 ) for improved data coverage to compare the various models using the @ xmath0 - dmr two - year results ( bennett 1996 ) .in @ xmath19 we provide an overview of open - system inflation models . in @ xmath20 we examine the various dmr data sets used in the calculations above , describe the various open models we use , and present the dmr estimate of the cmb rms quadrupole anisotropy amplitude @ xmath21 as a function of @ xmath1 for these open models . in @ xmath22 we describe the computation of the cosmographic and large - scale inflation statistics for the dmr - normalized inflation models . these statistics are modified by the experimental time constraints in @ xmath23 . our results are presented in @ xmath24 . the simplest open inflation model is that in which a small open - inflation bubble exists in a ( possibly ) spatially - expanding , inflating spacetime ( gott 1982 ; guth & weinberg 1983 ) . in this model , the initial epoch of inflation smooths away all possible local fluctuations , while still generating quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations . thus , in a tunnelling event , the open - inflation bubble nucleates , and for a small local nucleation , thethe universe lies inside a single open - shell bubble . fluctuations of relevance to the near - infinite universe can be generated via three different quantum mechanical mechanisms : ( 1 ) they can be generated during the first epoch of inflation ; ( 2 ) they can be generated during the tunnel event ( thus resulting in a slightly inhomogeneous spherical hypersurface of the bubble , or a slightly non - spherical bubble ) ; and ( 3 ) they can be generated inside the bubble . the tunneling event is largest for the most general case ( and deviations from this lead to an exponential suppression ) , so it has usually been assumed that the nucleation event ( see [ 1 ] ) does not lead to the generation of significant inhomogeneities . quantum - mechanical fluctuations generated during evolution of the bubble ( rp95 ) are nonlinear . assuming that the energy - density difference between the two periods of inflation is small ( and that the bubble wall is not significant ) , one can estimate the changes to the bubble ##s of the nucleation from quantum - mechanical fluctuations during the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) . as shown by bucher & turok ( 1995 , hereafter bt ) ( also see the##st ; yb ) , the theoretical predictions of these two open - bubble inflation models are almost completely identical to the fluctuations of the first epoch of inflation , for the observationally - viable range of @ xmath1 . this is because the fluctuations generated during this epoch affect only the " wavenumber part of the angular - momentum - power " , which would " contribute significantly to the predictions because of the spatial curvature length distribution " in the open model ( e . g . , w83 ; kamionkowski & spergel 1994 ; rp95 ) . observations of such fluctuations in the model support the predictions for the present value of the rms [ energy density distribution over the @ xmath25 mpc ##Â² , @ xmath26 $ ] , by @ xmath27 ( which is comparable to our gravitational power ) . for the open - bubble inflation model spectra , a number of alternatives have also been proposed . predictions for the standard straight - line scale - invariant parameters of an open model have been made ( w83 ; abbott & schaefer 1986 ; gouda , sugiyama , & sasaki 1991 ; sugiyama & gouda 1992 ; kamionkowski & spergel1994 ; sugiyama & lee 1994 ; cayn et al . the possibility that the standard model of quantum mechanics is valid in an open universe , and that allowance should be made for non - square - integrable basis functions has been investigated ( lyth & woszczyna 1995 ) , and other spectra have also been considered ( e . g . , w83 ; abbott & schaefer 1986 ; kamionkowski & spergel 1994 ) . these spectra , although inconsistent with either standard quantum mechanics or the length scale given by spatial dimensions , are of particular interest . more recently , the open - universe inflation model has been further improved upon . yst have considered a more general model for the nucleation of the open bubble in a non - flat de ##duced spacetime , and demonstrated a significant theoretical predictions from a non - square - integrable basis function which depends on the size of the bubble , and on the ground state of the quantum state corresponding to the nucleation . however , since the non - square - integrable basis function depends only on the very small scale , the " curvature model " in an open universe makes almost all of the theoretical predictions corresponding to this basis function , for the observationally -viable range of @ xmath1 ( yst ; yb ) . for example , at @ xmath28 the answer is to [ @ xmath26 $ ] = @ xmath29 . an interesting theoretical result , for the simple model of an open - shell bubble wall in a non - flat de ##duced spacetime is that fluctuations of the bubble wall behave on a non - square - integrable basis function ( hamazaki et al . 1996 ; garriga 1996 ; garca - bellido 1996 ; yamamoto , sasaki , & tanaka 1996 ) . while there are cases in which these bubble - wall fluctuations are completely insignificant ( garriga 1996 ; yamamoto et al . 1996 ) , there is as yet no model that accounts for both the bubble - wall fluctuations as well as those generated during the time inside the bubble ( which are always present ) , and it is not yet known if bubble - wall fluctuations can give rise to an observationally significant effect . however , again for this very simple model , the effects of a finite bubble wall at nucleation seem to affect the theoretical bubble wall predictions only by a very small amount ( yamamoto et al . 1996 ; cohn 1996 ) . since there is no evidence thatthere is no spatial - flat de sitter spacetime prior to bubble nucleation , these computations do reflect the important fact that the spatial " length " " of the open universe ( e . g . , rp95 ) does seem to ensure that what happened prior to bubble nucleation does not significantly affect the observable parameters for observationally - based single - field open - bubble inflation models . it is indeed clear that accounting only for the quantum mechanical fluctuations generated during the time of the bubble ( rp94 ) seems to be about all that is needed to make accurate predictions for the single - field open - bubble inflation models . that is , the observational predictions of the single - field inflation models seem to be as good as those for the spatial - flat inflation scenario . in this section , we examine the dmr four - year average and 90 ghz sky maps in both galactic and ecliptic directions . we thus quantify only the expected small variations in the inferred normalization , due to the large differences between the deep - and deep - sky maps . the maps are coadded using random - noise - variance functions calculated in each coordinate system . the least sensitive 31 ghz maps have been omitted fromthe analysis , since their size is small under such a weighting scheme . the dominant source of emission in the dmr maps is close to the galactic plane . we are unable to determine this due to the sky being to sufficient size to accommodate its subtraction , so we remove all pixels where the galactic - plane signal reaches the cmb . the size of the cut has been determined by using the dirbe 140 @ xmath30 galactic line as the tracer of the galactic line , as described above in banday ( 1996a ) . all pixels with high latitude @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 @ xmath33 were removed , along with regions towards leo - ophiucus and leo - leo . there are 3881 total pixels in galactic plane and 3890 in map . this large ( four - dimensional scale ) galactic line cut has had the greatest impact on the analysis of the dmr data ( see grski et al . 1996 , page g96 ) . the extent to which residual high - latitude galactic emission can modify our understanding has been determined in two ways . since the general morphology of the emission , free - free and dust emission seemsto be accurately measured by a steeply scaled power spectrum ( @ xmath34 kogut 1996a , g96 ) , the cosmological signal is not visible on the higher power scales . as a simple measure of signal quality , we perform many experiments both including and including the whole sky quadrupole . a more sophisticated approach ( g96 ) notes that a small fraction of the galactic signal can be accounted for by using the dirbe ##band @ xmath30 m sky map ( smith 1995 ) as a template for free - space and radio astronomy , and the 408 mhz deep - sky radio band ( haslam 1981 ) to describe synchrotron emission . a model analysis of coupling coefficients for the galactic templates at each of the dmr frequencies . we have repeated our model analysis after comparing the coadded sky maps by the galactic signal scaled by the coefficients derived in g96 . in particular , we used those coefficients derived under the assumption that the galactic signal is well - described by an @ xmath35 = 1 power law , with normalization amplitude @ xmath21 @ xmath36 ##a @ xmath30k and coupling coefficient 1 . in fact , we have investigatedthis for a sub - sample of the data presented here in which we used @ xmath1 but not @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 . no statistically significant differences were found in the derived values of either @ xmath21 or the coupling coefficient . ] . one can find criticisms of this technique : missing components from an analysis , in this case the quadrupole effect , can obviously weaken any conclusions simply because the data will grow ; at the same time , it is not clear whether the galactic cuts applied are really adequate . we believe that , under these assumptions , our analysis is the most complete and accurate one that is available . the power law analysis technique described by grski ( 1994 ) is implemented . the spherical functions for the spatial decomposition of the sky maps are calculated which specifically include the pixelization effects and the galactic cut . ( these are linear combinations of the standard spherical functions with multipole @ xmath37 . ) the functions are linear system dependent . a likelihood analysis is then performed as described in grski ( 1994 ) . we consider four open model probability - density - function models : ( 1 ) the open - model # ##al spectrum , accounting only for fluctuations that are generated during the time inside the bubble( rp94 ) ; ( 2 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , now also accounting for the fluctuations generated in the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) ; ( 3 ) the closed - bubble inflation model spectrum , now also accounting for both the time fluctuations generated in the second epoch of inflation and the variation from the non - square - integrable transfer function ( yst ) ; and , ( 4 ) the open model with the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum ( w83 ) . in most cases we have ignored the effects of gravitational and primordial gravity effects , since it is unlikely that they can have any significant effect in viable open models . with the eigenvalue of the radial coordinate laplacian being @ xmath38 , where @ xmath39 is the radial coordinate spatial wavenumber , the scale - invariant fractional mean - density perturbation ( spectrum of type ( 1 ) ) and @ xmath40 where @ xmath41 is the transfer function and @ xmath42 is the normalization function ) generalize the real part of the spectrum of type . ( 1 ) by multiplying it with @ xmath43 . and yet ,only the specific @ xmath44 energy spectrum ( i . e . , fig . [ 2 ] ) is known to be a prediction of the open - bubble inflation model and therefore consistent with the presence of spatial curvature . it is possible to draw conclusions about open cosmogony on the basis of the @ xmath45 version of the spectrum given by bw . ] . in the above example , perturbations occurring at the initial epoch of inflation have an additional multiplicative term , @ xmath46 , on the right hand side of fig . ( 2 ) . for a discussion of the properties of the non - square - integrable basis function see yst and others . the mean - density function term of equation ( 4 ) above is @ xmath47 and in this case we can also consider , e . g . , @ xmath48 ( w83 ) , " because of the spatial curvature , " in an open bubble the predictions are essentially identical . for small @ xmath49 the corresponding terms are @ xmath50 ( type 1 ) , @ xmath51 ( type 2 ) , and @ xmath52 ( type 4) . conventionally , the cmb fractional angular perturbation , @ xmath53 , is expressed as a function of the position , @ xmath54 , in the system via the spherical harmonic decomposition , @ xmath55 the cmb temperature distribution in a gaussian system can then be described by the angular perturbation , @ xmath56 , expressed in terms of the ensemble average , @ xmath57 the @ xmath56 s . here were computed using two independent linear correlation codes developed by jp ( e . g . , sugiyama 1995 ) and ns ( e . g . , stompor 1994 ) . some further comparisons are shown in ref . we note that the good agreement between the @ xmath56 values obtained using the two codes is mostly a result of the very high numerical accuracy . however , the major likely underlying , unaccounted for , source of uncertainty is that due to the uncertainty in the modelling of the observed effects . the models below assume the standard recombination ##al history , and exclude the possibility of spontaneous reionization . the two open models ( with the largest possible number of free variables ) have yet to beruled out by experimental data ( grsb ; ratra et al . 1995 ; grs ; this paper ) , so there is little motivation to expand the model - parameter estimate . for the case of early reionization , tilt - wave waves values derived from the dmr data ##set ( with no early reionization ) are likely to be very significantly affected by early reionization . however , since gravity forms only in an open model , other effects of early reionization may be more significant in an open model . while it is possible to heuristically account for such effects , an accurate parameter estimate may provide a better prediction of structure formation . ] . for the @ xmath58 of models ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 4 ) above , we have evaluated the spin - orbit parameters for a range of @ xmath1 in the interval between 0 . 5 and 1 . 5 , for a range of values of @ xmath2 ( the mass parameter @ xmath59 ) and the baryonic - electron parameters of @ xmath10 . the values of @ xmath2 were chosen to represent the lower part of the range of ages consistent with current requirements ( @ x##math60 ##1 . 5 gyr , 12 gyr , or 13 . 5 gyr , with @ xmath2 as a multiple of @ xmath1 computed accordingly ; see , for example , smith et al . 1996 ; chaboyer et al . the values of @ xmath10 were determined to be consistent with current standard spectral models ( @ xmath61 0 . 0055 , 0 . 0125 , and 0 . 0205 ; e . g . , copi , schramm , & brown 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . to render the calculation simpler , @ xmath56 values were determined for the central values of @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 , and for the various combinations of these parameters which would distinguish the @ xmath56 values from those computed for the central values ( i . e . , for the smallest @ xmath62 we used the smallest @ xmath63 , and for the largest @ xmath62 we used the largest @ xmath63 ) . the central values are listed in columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of tables below , and rows of .can be seen in figs . 2 and 3 . we therefore build on our earlier analysis of the dmr 10 - year data ( grsb ) by assuming a suitably large range of the ( @ xmath10 , @ xmath2 ) parameter values . the cmb parameter values for @ xmath58 of type ( 2 ) , were calculated for a range of @ xmath1 spanning the interval between 0 . 1 and 0 . 9 , for @ xmath64 and @ xmath65 . these parameter values are shown in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of type 1 , and these values are shown in fig . 3 . in fig . 5 we compare the power spectra shown here . the differences between the non - @ xmath66 values of the @ xmath56 parameters in the various samples ( fig . 25 ) are a consequence of three effects : ( 1 ) the shape of the time - dependent spectral power spectrum at low wavenumber ; ( 2 ) the local ##ization of the spatial energy level in an ideal system ; and ( 3 ) the difference between the old " ( fiducial cdm ) sachs - wolfe term and the new " sachs - wolfe (( s ) term in the equation for the mean spatial temperature . the relative importance of these terms is determined by the value of @ xmath1 , and leads to the non - linear behaviour of the large - scale @ xmath56 term as a function of @ xmath1 seen in general . more generally , the contributions to the spatial temperature " spectrum from the usual " and integrated " sw terms have a large @ xmath66 - value as well as a relative importance that is both @ xmath1 and @ xmath58 dependent . on very large angular scales ( small @ xmath66 s ) , the dominant contribution to the usual " sw term comes from a larger redshift ( when the length scales are equal ) than is the usual contribution to the integrated " sw term ( hu & sugiyama 1994 , 1995 ) . as a result , in an open model on very large angular scales , the usual " sw term is cut off more strongly by the half - length scale than by the integrated " sw term ( hu & sugiyama 1994 ) , i . e . , on very large angular scales in an open model the usual " sw term has a smaller( 2 ) effective index @ xmath35 than the usual " sw " . on slightly smaller angular scales the integrated " " term is damped ( i . e . , it has a negative effective index @ xmath35 ) while the usual " sw " rises ( hu & sugiyama 1994 ) . as a result , going from the largest to slightly smaller angular scales , the " " term rises steeply and then flattens , while the " " term rises less sharply and then falls ( i . e . , it reaches its peak ) . the change in shape , as a function of @ xmath66 , of these two terms is " @ xmath1 and @ xmath58 " . these are the two dominant contributions at @ xmath67 ; for higher @ xmath66 other effects come into play . more precisely , for @ xmath68 the angular length scale , and the precise length - scale shape of the @ xmath58 term here are relatively unimportant the cmb ##v " spectrum is very similar to that for @ xmath69 , and the dominant contribution is the usual " sw " . for a @ xmath58 that isthey diverge at the wavenumber , as with the flat - space scale - invariant ##s of an open system , for @ xmath70 the exponential cutoff " at the mean value " dominates , and the lowest - @ xmath66 @ xmath56 - are suppressed ( figs . 4 and 5 ) . for this @ xmath58 , as @ xmath1 is reduced , the usual " term starts to be important on the larger angular scales down to @ xmath28 . as @ xmath1 is reduced to @ xmath71 the usual " term starts to dominate on the smaller angular scales , and as @ xmath1 is further reduced the integrated " peak " starts to dominate on smaller angular scales . from fig . 3 ( a ) we can see that the integrated " sw ##oop # " term makes an appearance at @ xmath72 the central point of the spectrum of @ xmath73 and that as @ xmath1 is further reduced ( in decreasing order along the scale shown ) the integrated " term peak " spreads to larger angular scales . the @ xmath74 case , where the integrated " term peaks at @ xmath75 , and the damp##ing of this term on higher angular scales ( @ xmath76 ) is compensated for by the steep rise of the usual " sw term the two terms are of roughly equal magnitude at @ xmath77 and these effects result in the almost exactly scale - invariant spectrum at @ xmath9 ( this spectrum is more scale - invariant than fiducial cdm ) . a discussion of some of these effects of the cmb - angular scale of the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model is given by cayn et al . ( 1996 ) . open - model open models have a @ xmath58 that increases at low wavenumber ( rp95 ; note that no sw term exists ) , and this increases the low - @ xmath66 @ xmath56 s ( fig . 2 and 5 ) relative to those of the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model ( fig . 2 and 5 ) . the @ xmath56 s for low @ xmath1 models increase more than the high @ xmath1 s , since , for a low wavenumber - value of @ xmath58 , the divergence is more pronounced at high @ xmat##h1 ( rp94 ) . the non - square - integrable basis set ( yst ) has much higher power on large angular scales , and so , at low - @ xmath66 , the @ xmath56 s of fig . 1 are slightly larger than those of fig . 2 ( also see fig . 2 ) . again , values at lower values of @ xmath1 are not very different . as is clear from fig . 2 and 3 , in the open - bubble inflation models , quantum - mechanical first - order fluctuations observed in the first epoch of inflation scarcely affect the @ xmath56 coefficients , although at the very highest values of @ xmath1 the very lowest order @ xmath56 coefficients are slightly larger . the effect is small in this region of the parameter , since the fluctuations of the first inflation epoch only contribute to , and affect , the zero wavenumber part of @ xmath58 . in the open - bubble inflation models , the exact value of this small effect is dependent on the model assumed for the first epoch of inflation ( bt ) . since the dmr model is very sensitive to multipole moments with @ xmath78 810 , one expects the effect to@ xmath78 appears to be almost completely negligible ( bt ; also called yst ; yb ) . figs . 6 show that both the scale - space scale - space - time model , and the contribution from the mean - square - integrable model , do lead to significantly higher @ xmath56 s ( compared to those of fig . the results of the dmr likelihood analyses are summarized in figs . 621 and tables 12 and 13 . two representative sets of likelihood functions @ xmath79 are presented in fig . 6 and 7 . figure 6 shows those derived from the ecliptic - frame sky maps , including the correction for faint high - latitude background galactic emission , and including the quadrupole moment from the analysis . figure 7 shows the likelihood functions derived from the polar - frame sky maps , accounting for the faint high - latitude foreground galactic emission , , and including the quadrupole moment from the analysis . together , these two data sets span the full range of normalizations inferred from our data ( the former being the highest , and the latter the lowest @ xmath21 ) . figure 8 give the @ xmath21 - model and the - @ xmath80and the - @ xmath80 ranges for spectra of type ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 4 ) above , derived from the appropriate prior probability density distribution , for a uniform distribution . a line in tables 13 lists these values at a time @ xmath1 for the following possible combinations of : ( 1 ) solar - or ecliptic - emission correction ; ( 2 ) faint low - frequency solar - emission correction corrected for parameters unknown ; and , ( 3 ) quadrupole ##d ( @ xmath81 ) or excluded ( @ xmath82 ) value of varying fixed parameters for @ xmath10 . since they do not quote derived @ xmath21 values for this model we are not allowed to compare to their results . ] . the corresponding straight lines of maximum likelihood @ xmath21 values as a function of @ xmath1 are shown in figs . 810 for each of the fixed - parameter values given above . although we have calculated these values for spectra of type ( 1 ) above ( i . e . , those calculated for perturbations observed during the first epoch of formation ) we have only a few of them in column ( 4 ) of tables 13 .these should be compared to types ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of table 13 , which show the maximal 2 - @ xmath80 @ xmath21 values for spectra of types ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . while the differences in @ xmath21 for types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) [ col . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of table 13 ] are not particularly significant , more than the differences in the @ xmath26 $ ] values for the three types [ col . ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) of table 13 ] are observationally insignificant . the figures in table 16 illustrate the shifts in the spectral line amplitudes due to changes in @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 . these shifts are larger for models with a larger @ xmath1 , since these models have cmb ##g spectra that shift much more rapidly towards increasing @ xmath66 , and in these models the dmr signal is sensitive to somewhat larger length scales where the effects of increasing @ xmath2 and @ xmath63 are more pronounced . table 16 illustrates the effect that increasing @ xmath62 and @ xmath63based on some of the ridge lines of the likelihood @ xmath21 as a function of @ xmath1 , and fig . 2 illustrates the effect on estimates of the conditional ( for @ xmath1 slice ) likelihood densities for @ xmath83 on the whole , for the cmb - model considered here , shifts between @ xmath2 and @ xmath84 have only a small effect on the observed correlation ##s . the normalization model is much more sensitive to the differences between the galactic - and ecliptic - coordinate sky maps , to the foreground high - latitude galactic emission treatment , and to the inclusion or exclusion of the @ xmath85 moment . for the purpose of calculating it , we choose for our 2 - @ xmath80 s . l . the values from the likelihood fits that cover the entire range of the @ xmath21 region . then , for the lower 2 - @ xmath80 bound we adopt the value determined from the differences of the galactic - coordinate maps , for the high - latitude galactic emission treatment and for the @ xmath85 moment in the region , and for the upper 2 - @ xmath80 bound thatdetermined from the geometry of the ecliptic - plane , using the galactic radius , and excluding the @ xmath85 values from the table . these values are given in columns ( 5 ) and ( 8 ) of tables 912 , and ( ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) of tables 900 ) were used in the likelihood analyses of the various model parameters , and when these methods were used in the calculation of the @ xmath21 values , there were no ( or little ) differences between the quoted @ xmath21 values for the various models in these tables . ] . fig 12 shows the ridge distribution of the likelihood @ xmath21 value , as a function of @ xmath1 , for the four high - resolution angular spectra considered above , and fig . 13 shows some of the estimated ( fixed @ xmath1 slice ) values ##s for @ xmath21 for these four high anisotropy angular spectra . approximate fitting formulae may be derived to describe the following two parameter values - @ xmath80 vs . for the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ;

( although , again , only the transition to the very low - @ xmath1 peak is seen here ) . note that now , even for the quadrupole moment case , the peaks and valleys are more prominent ( although still not necessarily more significant ) . furthermore , comparing the horizontal line of fig . 17 ( b ) , to the horizontal dotted line of fig . 3 of grsb , one finds that the intermediate @ xmath1 peak is now at @ xmath96 , instead of at @ xmath97 for the dmr two - year data . ( since bw chose not to account for the case when the quadrupole moment is excluded from the analysis , they also did not find the peak at @ xmath98 in themarginalized probability density for the open - bubble inflation model ( fig . 21 . ) for the closed - bubble inflation model above , accounting for both the data generated from the first spatially - flat interval of time ( bgt ; yst ) , and those from the non - square - integrable data set ( yst ) , the dmr 1 - year data ecliptic - excluded quadrupole - excluded marginal likelihood ( shown as the bottom line in fig . 21 of yb ) is in general consistent with the double - bottom line of fig . 19 , yb did not account for the case where the quadrupole maximum was excluded from the data and therefore did not find the peak at @ xmath99 in fig . 19 . given the shapes of the marginal likelihoods in figs . 1721 , it is not at all clear if it is meaningful to derive estimates for @ xmath1 without making use of the ( prior ) data . as an example , it is not at all clear what to do for the expected results for @ xmath1 . based on fig . 21 ( 2 ) ( which is similar to the other quadrupole excluded variables ) , the only difference seems to be that @ xmath##9 is the value most consistent with the dmr data ( at least amongst those models with @ xmath14 some of the models have another peak at @ xmath100 , grsb ) . however , when the quadrupole moment is included in the data ( as in fig . 21b ) , the open - spectrum open model peaks are at @ xmath12 ( at least in the case @ xmath14 , grsb ) , while the flat - bubble time - invariant spectrum closed model peak is at @ xmath11 . at the 100 % c . i . the peak of @ xmath1 in the range of , 0 . 11 , is excluded .

( 8 ) and ( 9 ) provide an exact fit for all the open - inflation open model spectra . the combined @ xmath106 - @ xmath80 @ xmath58 scale factors ( eq .

( 8 ) and ( 9 ) and eqs . ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) as fits . we emphasize , however , that it is difficult to draw conclusions about the validity based solely on this central " value . in comparison with the derived likelihood functions , the fits of fig .

( 1986 , hereafter bbks ) analytic fit to the transfer function using the parameterization of fig . ( 7 ) below ( sugiyama 1995 ) and numerically determined values for @ xmath42 , the [ @ xmath113 $ ] values are close to better than @ xmath87 ( except for the cross - validation , @ xmath114 , models where the error could be as much as @ xmath115 ) . use of the analytic fit of fig . ( 8 ) ( 9 ) for @ xmath42 ( instead of the numerical determined values ) , reduces the error , while use of the bbks transfer function [ parameterized by the modified version of fig . ( 13 ) below , @ xmath116 $ ] , results in @ xmath26 $ ] values that could fall off by as much as @ xmath117 . nevertheless , as abeen developed by llrv , the approximate analytic fit to the transfer function formula allows the computation and allows for the calculation of the favoured part of one - dimensional space . numerical values for the cosmographic and large - scale structure predictions for the models considered here are given in tables 915 . we note that when comparing to experimental data we make use of pre - determined large - scale structure predictions , including those derived using the approximate analytic fit method . tables 912 gives the values for the spin - orbit inflation model , and for the perturbations generated during the formation of the bubble ( rp94 ) , and for the flat - space time - invariant spectrum scaling model ( w83 ) . each of these tables corresponds to a different pair of @ xmath118 tables . the first two columns of these tables are @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 , and the third column is the cosmological baryonic - matter fraction @ xmath119 . the fourth column gives the value of the second power spectral scale parameter ( sugiyama 1995 ) , @ xmath120 which is used to parameterize the analytic fit to the power spectrum derived from numerical calculations of thethe following . the quantities given in columns ( 3 ) ( 4 ) of these tables are sensitive only to the mass distribution of the observed model . columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of tables 912 give the dmr of 1 - @ xmath80 range of @ xmath21 that is used to determine the values of the values considered here . the corresponding values in column 12 are for @ xmath121 gyr , @ xmath122 . we did not compare the dmr data with @ xmath56 values for these models , and in this case the values are normalized to the @ xmath21 values from the @ xmath123 gyr , @ xmath124 ranges . ( as discussed above , values in @ xmath2 and @ xmath63 do not significantly affect the observed mass distribution . ) columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) of tables 912 give the 1 - @ xmath80 range of @ xmath125 $ ] . these are determined using the @ xmath58 derived from numerical analysis of the # ##s . for about two dozen cases ,these rms - values obtained using the two standard mass estimation methods were compared and found to be in perfect agreement . ( at fixed @ xmath21 , they differ from @ xmath126 depending on the - parameter values , with the typical difference being @ xmath127 . we again note that this is mostly a reflection of currently available measurement data . ) . to achieve better than @ xmath128 values , for @ xmath129 , the [ - @ xmath80 @ xmath130 $ ] entries of tables ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) of tables 912 can be calculated by the fitting formulas listed in table 9 . these fitting formulae are more accurate than [ for @ xmath26 $ ] values for the model cosmological - parameter values with the analytic approximation to the correlation function and the use of eqs . ( 10 ) ( 11 ) . for such systems , as discussed below , it proves more convenient to characterize the peculiar mass parameters by the formula @ xmath131 where @ xmath132 is the linear bias parameter for @ xmath133 galaxies ( e . g . , smith & dodds 1994 ) .the 2 - @ xmath80 range of @ xmath134 is listed in columns ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) of tables 912 . table 14 lists the @ xmath113 $ ] values for spectra of type ( 2 ) ( 3 ) above . clearly , there is no significant statistical difference between the values for the different ranges . in what follows , for the open - system inflation , we concentrate on the type ( 2 ) spectrum above . therefore , the values in table 914 are those derived from the maximal 2 - @ xmath80 @ xmath21 ##3 . table 15 uses central dmr - [ " mean for @ xmath130 $ ] , " as the mean of the 2 @ xmath1352 - @ xmath80 range of tables 912 . ( the values of the @ xmath1352 - @ xmath80 fitting formulae of table 13 can be used to interpolate between the entries of table 15 . ) we again emphasize that it is possible to draw conclusions about the predictions based " on these same " values for the purpose of obtaining model - based values by , e . g . , comparing numerical model results to observational dataone can make use of computations of a few different values of the parameters selected to determine the @ xmath1352 - @ xmath80 ranges of table 912 . the dmr likelihoods do not necessarily cover any part of the ( @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 , @ xmath63 ) parameter ranges for the models considered here . in this section we combine current observational constraints on global model parameters with the dmr - normalized model predictions to create constraints on the distribution of our model - parameter values . it is important to keep in mind that some measures of global cosmology remain uncertain thus our work here must be viewed as incomplete and subject to revision as the observational data reaches us . to constrain our model - parameter values we have used the most restrictive of the available observational constraints . tables 912 contain some new constraints for the models considered here , and the remaining entries are those that are inconsistent with the observational constraints at the 0 - @ xmath80 range level . for each cosmographic or large - scale parameter , we have generally chosen to use data from a single set of models or from a single sample . we generally use the followingrecent developments since we find that they incorporate a better understanding of the constraints , especially those related to systematics . the specific constraints we use are listed below , where we compare them to those derived from the models . the theoretical predictions depend on the age of the universe @ xmath62 . to reconcile the models with the high measured values of the input data @ xmath2 , we have only to rely on @ xmath60 ##1 . 5 , 12 , and 13 . 5 gyr , which are at the lower end of the ages currently under discussion . for example , weiss et al . ( 1996 ) find that the oldest known clusters have been @ xmath136 gyr ( also called salaris , deglinnocenti , & weiss 1996 ; renzini et al . 1996 ) , and that it is highly likely that the oldest clusters are younger than 9 . 5 gyr . the value of @ xmath1 is an important parameter for our models . as noted by peebles ( 1993 , @ xmath137 ) , the is @ xmath138 mpc a number of important experimental measurements show that @ xmath1 is low . for example , virial ##eof x - ray scattering data : @ xmath139 , with a 2 - @ xmath80 range : @ xmath140 ( carlberg et al . 1996 we then added their 1 - @ xmath80 range and physical values of doubled and doubled to give the 2 - @ xmath80 uncertainty ) . for a cdm model in which structure forms have a relatively high density ( which is observed ) , these local values of @ xmath1 only match the local values of @ xmath1 ( since , in this case , it is inconceivable that the pressureless cdm is much more homogeneously distributed than is the standard baryonic limit ) . we hence need a 2 - @ xmath80 upper limit of @ xmath141 to fit the cdm models we consider here . ( this large upper limit allows for the possibility that the models might be moderately accurate . ) the local values in column ( 1 ) of tables 912 indicate those @ xmath1 values inconsistent with this limit . column ( 2 ) of tables 912 indicates the value of the hubble parameter @ xmath2 that corresponds to the local valuesof @ xmath1 and @ xmath62 . other experimental data suggest a larger @ xmath2 ( e . g . , kennicutt , smith , & smith 1995 ; smith et al . 1995 ; van den bergh 1995 ; sandage et al . 1996 ; ruiz - lapuente 1996 ; riess , muller , & kirshner 1996 ; but ##z , schaefer 1996 ; wang et al . for the remainder of our discussion , we adopt the @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 ( 2 - @ xmath80 ##he , tanvir et al . 1995 ) ; considering the above , the 2 - @ xmath80 range is @ xmath144 . the lower table shown in section ( 2 ) of rfc 912 shows those model - derived values which give values @ xmath2 consistent with this model . reduction of the standard - model predictions for the stable light isotope ##s to what is expected by reduction of the observed decay to primordial light due to constraints on @ xmath63 . it has long been assumed that @ xmath145he and @ xmat##h146li allows for the most efficient conversion from the locally allowed values to the desired values ( e . g . , dar 1995 ; fields & olive 1996 ; allen et al . 1996 , and fkot ) . the 2 @ xmath145he and @ xmath146li abundances strongly suggest @ xmath147 , and a conservative analysis of the data suggests a 2 - @ xmath80 ##he : @ xmath148 ( fkot ; also , copi et al . 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . the data on the observed d ( h ) abundance should , in principle , allow for a reduction of the 2 @ xmath63 range . there are now a number of different estimates of the observed d abundance , and since the method is still in its infancy it is , therefore , not surprising that the different estimates are somewhat different . songaila et al . ( 1994 ) , carswell et al . ( 1994 ) , and rugers & allen ( 1996a , b ) used one of three high - energy absorption lines to argue for a high - d abundance and so the 2 @xmath63 . tytler , smith , & smith ( 1996 ) and smith & tytler ( 1996 ) examine two absorption clouds and look for a high - d abundance and so a high @ xmath63 . carswell et al . ( 1996 ) and wampler et al . ( 1996 ) examine two absorption clouds , but are not able to independently suggest @ xmath63 . since the error estimates of @ xmath63 values from these d abundance observations are highly uncertain , to use these results to help pick the @ xmath63 range we wish to examine we assume that the values are known ( and where we add further uncertainties to quadrature to get the 2 - @ xmath80 range ) . the large d abundance observations suggest @ xmath149 with a 2 - @ xmath80 range : @ xmath150 ( rugers & smith 1996a ) . when these large d values are compared with the observed @ xmath145he and @ xmath146li abundances , they suggest @ xmath151 , with a 2 - @ xmath##80 range : @ xmath152 ( fkot ) . the large d abundances are consistent with the local interpretation of the @ xmath145he and @ xmath146li ranges , and with the standard model of particle physics ( with three massless neutrino species ) ; they do , however , seem to require a modification of the thermal equilibrium and to be consistent with local interpretations of the d and @ xmath153he abundances ( e . g . , fkot ; cardall & fuller 1996 ) . the low d abundance ##s favour @ xmath154 with a 2 - @ xmath80 range : @ xmath155 ( smith & tytler 1996 ) . the high d abundance observations seem to be more easily explained in terms of the standard model of particle physics , i . e . , they are difficult to explain with exactly three massless d species ; alternatively they may require a slight , as yet unaccounted for , modification in the predicted @ xmath145he abundance ( smith & tytler 1996 ; cardall & fuller 1996 ) . the low d abundance is also consistent with locally - known d species , but it requiressee modification of the cluster galactic chemical composition model for @ xmath146li ( burles & tytler 1996 ; cardall & smith 1996 ) . to determine the range of @ xmath63 values under discussion , we compute the values for @ xmath124 ( table 9 ) , 0 . 007 ( table 10 ) , 0 . 0125 ( table 11 ) , and 0 . 0205 ( table 11 ) . we shall note that this modification in @ xmath63 allows determination of tighter constraints on scale - factor values . however , recent improvements in numerical techniques should eventually lead to a relaxation of the constraints on @ xmath63 , and so allow for tighter constraints on the other two models . terms ( 3 ) of table 912 describe the cluster baryonic - mass fraction for the model we discussed above . the cluster baryonic - mass fraction is the sum of the cluster galactic - mass and gas - mass fractions . assuming that the smith et al . ( 1993 ) 1 - @ xmath80 constraints on the atomic total , galactic , and gas masses are gaussian and adding them in order , we solve for the 1 - @xmath80 range of the cluster baryonic - mass fraction : @ xmath156 elbaz , arnaud , & bhringer ( 1995 ) , white & fabian ( 1995 ) , jones , jones , & forman ( 1995 ) , markevitch et al . ( 1996 ) , and buote & canizares ( 1996 ) report this ( somewhat larger ) gas - mass fraction . note that elbaz et al . ( 1995 ) and white & fabian ( 1995 ) report that the gas - mass fraction ##s are somewhat smaller ; this non - gaussianity is discussed below . assuming that the cluster baryonic - mass fraction is an accurate estimate of the cluster baryonic - mass fraction , we can use eq . ( 15 ) to estimate the observed range . the relevant estimates in section ( 2 ) of tables 9 - 11 are those gas - mass estimates which indicate a cosmological baryonic - mass fraction consistent with the predictions of eq . ( 15 ) . viana & liddle ( 1996 , hereafter vl ) have reanalyzed the spiral galaxies @ xmath58 range of peacock & dodds ( 1994 ), and some of the smaller scale parameters where nonlinear ##ities might be much larger than previously estimated . using an analytic approximation to the @ xmath58 , they found that the scale parameter ( fig . [ 16 ] ) is the case of fig . ( 16 ) , and the corresponding value of their constraint on @ xmath157 should be increased slightly . we see this small effect here . ] @ xmath158 , with a near - @ xmath80 range , @ xmath159 this estimate is consistent with better estimates than above . ( 16 ) this is the reason why llrv estimates ##s higher @ xmath1 for the gas - liquid gas model than for grsb . ] . it may be of interest to determine whether the wiggles on @ xmath58 due to the changes in the photon - baryon interaction , see fig . 23 , will significantly affect the determination of @ xmath157 , especially for large @ xmath119 data . ( these effects are not fully described in the analytic approximation to @ xmath58 . ) the first column in column ( 4 ) of tables 912 lists those scale - parameter values which predict the scaling parameter .inconsistent with the range of e . ( 16 ) . to determine the range of the observed structure parameter @ xmath160 , @ xmath161 where @ xmath162 is the rms of change in galaxy number , we use the apm value ( maddox , efstathiou , & wilson 1996 ) of @ xmath163 = 0 . 1 $ ] , with 2 - @ xmath80 uncertainty : @ xmath164 where we have combined the uncertainty due to the standard model uncertainty and due to the general theory of quadrature with the original 2 - @ xmath80 uncertainty ( maddox et al . 1996 , p . [ 18 ] ) , and again to determine the 2 - @ xmath80 uncertainty . the range of e . ( 16 ) is consistent with that derived from eqs . ( 7 . 1 ) and ( 7 . 34 ) of peebles ( 1993 ) . the relative size of the galaxies , as a function of their x - ray temperature , is a " " [ @ xmath113 $ ] . eke , jensen , & frenk ( 1996 , in ecf ) ( and s .cole , j ( 1996 ) , for the open model ( ) - @ xmath80 : @ xmath165 where we have assumed that the observed distributions are gaussian , and that in general it depends only on the value of @ xmath157 ( and not on the value of @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 ) see fig . 13 of ecf . in our earlier work , we found this mild dependence between @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 . also note that the constraint of e . ( 19 ) is approximately that required for compliance with the observed cluster correlation function . ] . the constraints of eq . ( 19 ) are consistent with , but more restrictive than , those imposed by vl = 0 . [ $ ] for the cdm , which is approximately the @ xmath1662 - @ xmath80 limit of 0 . ( as stated in ecf , this is because vl corresponds to the cluster correlation function of 1 kev , where there is no rise in the correlation function . ) this is one reason why llrv required a higher value of @ xmath1 for the single - bubble open model than for gr##sb . ] . this is because they use cluster data over a larger range of x - ray temperature to constrain @ xmath167 , and also use many - body simulations at @ xmath168 0 . 3 and 1 to calibrate the einstein - schechter model ( which is used in their determination of the constraints ) . however , ecf also make use of hydrodynamical simulations of a number of individual clusters using the fiducial cdm model ( @ xmath69 ) to determine the relationship between the cluster density and the cluster mass , and they use this calibrated model for the computations at different values of @ xmath1 . the necessary parameters for performing the calculations are obtained from the best approximation to @ xmath58 , and so it might be of interest to see whether the wiggles of the fully integrated @ xmath58 could significantly affect the determination of the constraints of eq . kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) using x - ray cluster data , and a model that allows for the fact that clusters can not be formed at the redshift at which they are formed , to significantly affect the determination of @ xmat##h1 for cdm cosmogonies compared to the dmr billion - year data . their conclusions are in resonable agreement with what would be expected by using fig . ( 19 ) ( and assuming that observed galaxies are at their redshifts of formation ) . however , kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) note that evolution from the time of formation to the time of observation may affect the conclusions , so a more detailed comparison of these two results is warranted . the data values in figures ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) of tables 912 are those model - derived values whose values are consistent with the constraints of fig . ( 19 ) ( 13 - @ xmath80 ) . of fig . ( 19 ) , the predictions based on using the @ bbks approximation to the transfer function should make use of the more accurate parameterization of fig . ( 13 ) ( better than that with @ xmath169 as the parameter ) , [ this is @ xmath26 $ ] to better than @ xmath87 in the observationally viable range of parameter ##ization ( no use is made of the previously derived value of @ xmath42 ) . ] .from large - scale peculiar velocity observation data zaroubi et al . ( 1996 ) estimate @ xmath26 = ( 0 . 85 \ pm 1 . 0 ) \ math _ { { } ^ { - 0 . 6 } $ ] ( 2 - @ xmath80 ) . it should be noted that the large - scale peculiar velocity observation data constraint is often contrasted with ( rather than ) the mass temperature function constraint . since @ xmath170 is more sensitive to smaller length scales ( compared to @ xmath26 $ ] ) , the constraints on @ xmath170 are more often contrasted with the linear velocity constraint . however , since @ xmath170 is sensitive to smaller length scales , the observation constraints on @ xmath170 are much less severe than the @ xmath171 ( 1 - @ xmath80 ) constraint of eq . ( 2 ) , and so we do not consider the extreme values of @ xmath170 here . the constraints on the mass temperature function determined from large - scale peculiar velocity data impose a constraint on the temperature function . kolatt & dekel ( 1995 ) find at the 1 - @ xmath##80 level @ xmath172 where the 1 - @ xmath80 uncertainty only accounts for the size ( t . kolatt , private communication 1996 ) . since the uncertainties associated with the constraint of eq . ( 20 ) are more significant than those associated with the constraint of fig . ( 20 ) , we do not make predictions for this problem directly . however , references should be made to the general linear - mass power spectra of fig . 23 , keeping in mind the @ xmath173 ( 2 - @ xmath80 ) uncertainty of eq .

( 21 ) , while not quite as strong as those from the large - scale structure models , we do not pursue this issue in our analysis here . the following entries in columns ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) of tables 912 indicate those model - parameter values whose values are inconsistent with the constraints of e . ( 21 ) . the following entries in tables 912 indicate the theoretical constraints imposed by the observational data presented in the previous section on the model - parameter values for the open - bubble inflation model ( spectra of type [ 1 ] above ) , and for the scale - and scale - free spectrum of model ( type [ 4 ] above ) . the current observational data on the models are not known , but this is mostly a result of the uncertainty of the constraints themselves since the model parameters are fairly accurate . in the following discussion of the proposed choice of model - parameter space we focus on the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ) . note from table 13 that the large - scale structure parameters of the open - bubble inflation model do not depend on perturbations generated by the standard epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) , and also do not dependsignificantly on the data from the non - square - integrable basis set ( yst ) . table 9 corresponds to the part of parameter values with the " large - scale scale " matter fluctuations . this is accomplished by picking a low @ xmath123 gyr ( and a large @ xmath2 ) , and by picking a high @ xmath124 ( this is the lower 2 - @ xmath80 value from standard model and the observed @ xmath145he , @ xmath146li , and k - model , fkot ) . the tightest constraints on the lower - parameter values come from the low - resolution observational data based on the lower parameter @ xmath157 ( table 9 , p . [ 1 ] ) , and from the cluster x - ray wave ##front observational data of [ @ xmath26 $ ] ( ) . note that for @ xmath177 the predicted [ 2 - @ xmath80 value of @ xmath113 = 0 . 74 $ ] , while we conclude that for 2 - @ xmath80 the observational data requires that this be at least 0 . 74 , so an @xmath177 also fails this test . the values on @ xmath134 ( col . [ 7 ] ) are not as restrictive as those on @ xmath113 $ ] . for these cases of @ xmath62 and @ xmath178 the cluster baryonic - mass fraction at @ xmath177 is predicted to be 0 . 033 ( col . [ 7 ] ) , while at 2 - @ xmath80 he et al . ( 1993 ) predicted that this is at least 0 . 039 ( 2 @ xmath179 ) , and again this @ xmath177 model also fails this test . given the above uncertainties , it may be possible to make minor corrections to the - @ values so that an @ xmath180 model with @ xmath181 gyr and @ xmath182 is just consistent with the observed model . however , it is clear that current experimental data does not support an experimental model with @ xmath183 the observed [ @ xmath184 $ ] favour a larger @ xmath1 and the observed cluster baryonic - mass fraction favour a smaller @xmath1 , and 2 are in ##ert . table 10 gives the predictions for the @ xmath121 gyr , @ xmath185 ##li . this prediction of @ xmath63 is consistent with the 2 - @ xmath80 range derived from experimental conditions and the observed @ xmath145he and @ xmath146li abundances : @ xmath148 ( fkot , also see copi et al . 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . it is , however , very difficult to compare @ xmath8 with the 2 - @ xmath80 range derived from the observed @ xmath145he , @ xmath146li , and the low d abundances @ xmath152 ( fkot ) , or with that from the previously observed low d abundance @ xmath186 ( smith & tytler 1996 ) . in any case , the observed d values are still under uncertainty , and should be regarded as constraints . in this case , gas - - gas models with @ xmath187 are consistent with the above constraints . the best known experimental data is for @ xmath157and @ xmath134 favour @ xmath74 , while that for the predicted baryonic - mass fraction prefers @ xmath188 , and that for @ xmath130 $ ] favour @ xmath189 , and in this case the difference between theoretical and experimental values is not significant ( although the tanvir et al . 1995 predicted @ xmath2 value favour @ xmath190 ) . note that in this case models with @ xmath191 are highly consistent with the predictions . table 11 gives the values for @ xmath192 gyr , @ xmath193 ge . this baryonic - mass fraction value is consistent with that derived from the previously observed cluster mass fluctuations , but is difficult to reconcile with the current standard model interpretation of the predicted @ xmath145he and @ xmath146li values ( cardall & fuller 1996 ) . the larger value of @ xmath63 ( and smaller value of @ xmath2 ) has also reduced large - scale fluctuations in mass fluctuations very much , opening up the predicted @ xmath1 range to higher values . models with @ xmat##h194 are consistent with the above data , although the higher @ xmath1 part of the data is starting to conflict with what is expected from the small - scale parameter ##ization , and the models now have a somewhat low @ xmath2 ( but as yet not necessarily at the 2 - @ xmath80 level , since the tanvir et al . 1995 central @ xmath2 constraint requires @ xmath100 , for 2 - @ xmath80 the @ xmath2 constraint only requires @ xmath195 ) . the predicted predicted values for @ xmath157 , the cluster baryonic - particle model , @ xmath26 $ ] , and @ xmath134 require @ xmath97 , but the agreement with the model is fairly good , and could possibly be improved by raising @ xmath62 a bit to lower @ xmath2 . figure 1 shows the data for this part of the - dimensional space . here we have @ xmath122 models ( and @ xmath121 gyr ) , but with the predicted value of @ xmath63 determined from standard nucleosynthesis using the -@ xmath145he , @ xmath146li , and high stellar velocity ( fkot ) . the larger size of @ xmath63 ( up to - 1 ) removes the cluster baryonic - mass fraction constraint , which now requires only @ xmath196 . the increase in @ xmath63 also increases the mass fraction amplitude , making it more difficult to argue for @ xmath177 ; however , models with @ xmath197 seem to be consistent with the observed results when @ xmath4 and @ xmath198 gyr . it is clear that in this case the cluster mass fraction sets we have for @ xmath157 , for @ xmath26 $ ] , and for @ xmath134 and @ xmath9 ; however , that for the cluster baryonic - mass fraction ( as well as that for @ xmath2 ) favours @ xmath190 ( although for non - @ xmath80 the cluster baryonic - mass fraction constraint still requires @ xmath196 ) . similarly , the @ xmath199 open - loop inflation model with @xmath200 and @ xmath198 gyr are quite consistent with the observational constraints , in this case the agreement between models and observations is quite spectacular . note that in this case models with @ xmath201 are reasonably consistent with the experimental data . in contrast , open - bubble inflation models based on the cdm model ( rp94 ; bgt ; yst ) are reasonably consistent with the experimental data for @ xmath202 . the free - space time - invariant spectrum open model ( w83 ) is also reasonably consistent with the experimental data for a similar range of @ xmath1 . the increase in allowed values of @ xmath63 is one of the main reasons why such a large range in @ xmath1 is consistent with current experimental constraints . our detailed analysis of the dmr 10 - year data led us to conclude that only those open - bubble inflation models at the lower end of the above range ( @ xmath203 ) were consistent with the majority of constraints ( grsb ) . the increase in the allowed range to the @ xmath1 values @ xmath204 can be ascribed to a number of observed effects . however , thesenote : ( 1 ) the relative phase change from the central region of the dmr one - year data analysis to the two - year data ( g96 ) ; ( 2 ) use of the excluded 1 - @ xmath80 range of normalizations allowed by the dmr data analysis ( instead of the 1 - @ xmath80 range allowed by the galactic - frame quadrupole - excluded dmr two - year data analysis used here ) ; ( 3 ) use of the 1 - @ xmath80 range of the small - frame parameter estimates of @ xmath1 instead of the 1 - @ xmath80 range used in our data analysis ; ( 4 ) we consider a range of @ xmath63 values here ( in grsb we focus on @ xmath8 ) ; and ( 5 ) we consider a range of @ xmath62 values here ( in grsb we focus on @ xmath121 gyr ) . we note , however , that the range of parameter associated with @ xmath205 is only known if @ xmath63 is large ( @ xmath206 ) , @ xmath2 is small @ xmat##h207 ) , and the small - scale error estimates of @ xmath1 turn out to be robust somewhat accordingly . the experimental results we have used to estimate model - parameter error in the previous section are the most robust currently available . in addition , there are many other experimental data which we do not consider to be particularly robust , and any conclusions drawn from these should be taken with great caution . in this section we present several of the more tentative conclusions from more recent observations . in our analysis of the dmr two - year data and models , we compare the results for the rms value of the smoothed peculiar velocity field to results from the rest of the data ( bertschinger et al . we do not do this directly here since , given the uncertainties , the conclusions drawn in grsb are not easily accepted . in particular , comparison of the two models implies that we can treat the old 1 - @ xmath80 upper limits essentially as 2 - @ xmath80 upper limits for the two - year analysis . in grsb we use @ xmath134 determined by nusser & miller ( 1994 ) , @ xmath208 ( 2 - @ xmath80 ) , to con##strain the upper limit of is to @ xmath209 . if we use the cole et al . ( 1995 ) limit , @ xmath210 ( 2 - @ xmath80 ) , which , for the models of figure 1 , requires @ xmath211 . this limit is only slightly below the central limit ( @ xmath212 ) derived from the bertschinger et al . ( 1990 ) model in grsb . we therefore conclude that the large - scale flow results of bertschinger et al . ( 1990 ) favour a [ 2 - @ xmath80 value of @ xmath1 that is about @ xmath213 greater than that suggested by the phase - space distortion ##s of cole et al . ( 1995 ) . $ ] . ] we also strongly emphasize that the central limit of the large - scale flow results of bertschinger et al . ( 1990 ) does favour a significantly higher value of @ xmath1 than the rest of the data we have considered here . however , as discussed in detail in grsb , there is a difficulty in how to properly integrate large - scale flow data in the available data , especially given the large sample sizes associated with the measurement of asingle bulk data ( davis 1996 , also called llrv ) . a more careful analysis , as well as more observational data , is therefore needed before it will be possible to robustly conclude that the large - scale velocity distribution does not force us to assume much larger values of @ xmath1 than are favoured by the rest of the model constraints ( and hence unsuitable for the models described above ) . it might be significant that by comparing the mass - spectrum determined from a given set of peculiar velocity observations to the galaxy mass spectrum determined from the apm data , kolatt & dekel ( 1995 ) found that for the optically - peculiar apm galaxies @ xmath214 with a near - @ xmath80 distance , @ xmath215 ( note that it has been noted that these difficulties prevent a believable determination of @ xmath134 from a comparison of the observed large - scale peculiar velocity distribution to the @ xmath133 1 . 2 jy mass distribution , davis , nusser , & willick 1996 . ) this range is consistent with other estimates now under consideration . the stromlo - apm comparison of loveday et al . ( 1996 ) and @ xmat##h216 , with a 2 - @ xmath80 upper limit of 0 . 5 , while baugh ( 1996 ) concludes that @ xmath217 ( 2 - @ xmath80 ) , and ratcliffe et al . ( 1996 ) , for @ xmath218 . [ the apm range for @ xmath163 $ ] , ( 2 ) , the kolatt & dekel ( 1995 ) estimate of @ xmath219 , fig . ( 22 ) , may be equivalent to an estimate of @ xmath167 , and for 2 - @ xmath80 , @ xmath220 it is clear that at @ xmath69 the upper limit of this range is consistent with that estimated from the initial x - ray burst model data , fig . ( 19 ) , although the 2 @ xmath1 fig . ( 23 ) has a lower range than at fig . ( 19 ) because of the slope slope to the @ xmath1 . zaroubi et al . ( 1996 ) obtained their model - based estimates by comparing large - scale model parameters to that predicted by the dmr two - dimensional , normalized post - bubble inflation12 . they conclude that the open - bubble inflation model provides a good description of the large - scale flow . if , at 2 - @ xmath80 , @ xmath221 from table , we conclude that an open - bubble inflation model with @ xmath222 and @ xmath223 is a good fit to all the observational data considered in @ xmath224 . for @ xmath223 zaroubi et al . ( 1996 ) conclude that at 2 - @ xmath80 @ xmath225 ( fig . [ 2 ] ) , is above our value of @ xmath222 . since the zaroubi et al . ( 1996 ) analysis does not account for the uncertainty in the dmr model ( a . kolatt , private , 1996 ) , it is still unclear if the values from the large - scale flow observations are in agreement with those determined from the other data considered in ( and so rule out the open - bubble inflation model ) . it might also be significant that at much smaller time scales there is evidence for a higher value of @ xmath1 from small - scale velocity flow observations ( shaya , peebles , & smith 1995 ) .the cluster peculiar velocity model provides an alternative method for describing the peculiar velocity data ( e . g . , wang & efstathiou 1994 ; moscardini et al . 1995 ; bahcall & oh 1996 ) . bahcall & oh ( 1996 ) note that the experimental data is well - described by an @ xmath177 flat - @ xmath18 ##7 with @ xmath226 and @ xmath227 = 0 . 5 $ ] . this normalization is much smaller than that provided by the dmr data ( e . g . , ratra & sugiyama 1995 ) . although bahcall & oh ( 1996 ) do not compare the cluster peculiar velocity data directly to the data of the open - bubble inflation model , their estimates show that this data is consistent with the open - bubble inflation model predictions for the range of @ xmath1 favoured by the experimental data we consider [ @ xmath228 and the @ xmath26 $ ] model for the same range in ngc 912 . bahcall & oh ( 1996 ) also note that it is difficult , if not impossible , to compare the cluster peculiar velocity data with what is predicted by high density models like fidu##cial cdm and mdm . [ fixed @ xmath113 $ ] , low - density galaxies show stars earlier than high density galaxies . thus simulations of galaxies at high redshift can be used to estimate the galaxy density . as benchmarks , we note that , from the results of the numerical simulations of cen & ostriker ( 1993 ) , that the [ model with @ xmath229 = 0 . 8 $ ] galaxy density peaks at the time @ xmath230 when @ xmath231 and at @ xmath232 when @ xmath72 . thus the gas - ##tric inflation model is not in conflict with observational evidence that the giant star mass distribution at @ xmath233 is similar to that at the time ( e . g . , lilly et al . 1995 ; glazebrook et al . 1995 ; i ##yer et al . 1996 ) , nor is it in conflict with experimental evidence for massive debris disks at @ xmath233 ( vogt et al . these models may not accommodate experimental evidence of massive star - forming disks at @ xmath234 ( cowie , hu , & songaila 1995) , as well as the significant increase at @ xmath235 in the number of galaxies as a function of ( photometric ) # ##s in the visible light spectrum ( brown & hartwick 1996 ) , and it is not surprising that objects " the @ xmath236 protogalaxy " candidate ( yee et al . 1996 ; ellingson et al . 1996 ) could be produced using these methods . it is , however , at present unclear whether the open - bubble inflation model can accommodate the large population of massive star - forming galaxies at @ xmath237 ( steidel et al . 1996 ; giavalisco , steidel , & macchetto 1996 ) , and if there are many more populations of massive damped lyman @ xmath238 systems than the ones at @ xmath239 ( e . g . , brown et al . 1996 ; wampler et al . 1996 ; fontana et al . 1996 ) , then , depending on the model , these could pose a serious challenge for the open - bubble inflation model . on the other hand , the recent discovery of galaxy clusters at @ xmath240 ( e . g . , francis etco . 1996 ; pascarelle et al . 1996 ) probably do not pose a significant challenge for the open - bubble inflation model , since other objects like @ xmath241 ( e . g . , luppino & gioia 1995 ; pell et al . 1996 ) can easily be included in the model . it should be noted that for adiabatic @ xmath69 , designed to fit the present small - scale observations , e . g . , fiducial cdm ( with a normalization consistent with that from the dmr ) , tilted mdm , and tilted cdm ( without a positive correction ) , it is very difficult , if not impossible , to fit the new observational evidence of early structure formation ( e . g . , miller & bertschinger 1994 ; ostriker & cen 1996 ) . with the recent improvements in computational capabilities , new experimental tests show great promise for constraining the world model . it might be significant that the constraints from these tests are consistent with that behavior of the open - bubble inflation model in space that is affected by the small - scale structure formation . these tests include the @ xmath142 elliptical particle number counts test ( wang et .. 1996 ) , an early application of the apparent magnitude - magnitude test for type ia galaxies ( perlmutter et al . 1996 ) , as well as analyses of the rate of gravitational lensing of background and foreground galaxies ( e . g . , torres & waga 1996 ; kochanek 1996 ) . it should be noted that these tests are also consistent with @ xmath69 models , and plausibly with a time - dependent " constant " " space - dependent " ( e . g . , ratra & quillen 1992 ; torres & waga 1996 ) , but they do put pressure on the 1 - @ xmath18 cdm model . smaller - scale cmb spatial parameter estimates can also significantly extend the available range of spatial - parameter values . fig . 24 compares the 1 - @ xmath80 range of the spatial anisotropy estimates for a few known open - bubble inflation ( as well as 1 - @ time - invariant inflation models ) models to available cmb spatial parameter model data . from a direct comparison of the range of dmr two - year - normalized open - bubble inflation models to available data .##isotropy observed data , ratra et al . ( 1995 ) found that the range of parameter space for the open - bubble inflation model that was supported by the other observed data was also consistent with the small - scale observed data data . this result was confirmed by grs , which also considered open - bubble inflation as close to the @ xmath1351 - @ xmath80 values of the dmr two - year data ( and also considered open - bubble inflation models as very close to the dmr two - year data values , see figs . 5 and 6 of grs ) . grs discovered that ( given the uncertainties associated with the smaller - scale measurements ) the 1 - @ xmath80 change in the value of the dmr normalization allowed determination of the dependence on model - parameter space , although the range of model - parameter space for the open - bubble inflation model favoured by the authors , was found to be consistent with the smaller - scale cmb data observations , and @ xmath93 open - bubble inflation models were also supported by the small - scale cmb anisotropy observational data ( grs , figs. 5 and . ) . is allowed , but only if 1 - @ xmath80 @ xmath242 is . this broad interpretation is consistent with the assumption of grs that it is not even possible to directly constrain multi - parameter values from the cmb model data points . note also that hancock et al . ( 1996b ) do not consider the nature of the model relationships between the various dmr data points , and only include a number of data points , e . g . , the four msam points and the max3 mup result ( which is consistent with the earlier max5 mup result , lim et al . 1996 ) , which does not disfavour the large value of @ xmath1 for the open - bubble inflation model ( ratra et al . 1995 ; grs ) . ] a further analysis of the ucsb south pole 1994 inflation model data ( gundersen et al . 1995 ) by ganga et al . ( 1996a ) reaches a similar conclusion : at 1 - @ xmath80 ( assuming a beta - beta distribution ) the data matches open - bubble inflation models with @ xmath243 , and at 1- @ xmath80 the ucsb south ##point 1994 models are consistent with the predictions of the half - plane , flat - @ xmath18 , and the cdm ##r models . we have compared the dmr 80 and 80 ghz sky maps to a set of low - cmb anisotropy angular spectra in order to infer the validity of these two source models . our analysis explicitly describes the brightness differences in the inferred normalization amplitudes corresponding to : ( 1 ) the brightness differences between the galactic - and ecliptic - coordinate sky maps ; ( 2 ) the inclusion or exclusion of the @ xmath85 model in the data ; and , ( 3 ) the faint high - latitude infrared light treatment . we have defined a maximal 2 - @ xmath80 uncertainty range based on the extremal solutions of the normalization amplitude , and a maximal 1 - @ xmath80 uncertainty range may be defined in a similar manner . for this maximal 1 - @ xmath80 @ xmath21 , the maximal 2 - @ xmath80 is , at least @ xmath10 and @ xmath2 ( but based on the maximal local aniso##tropy galactic - and model - parameter values ) , ranges between @ xmath244 and @ xmath245 ( absolute and systematic ) uncertainty of . ( data 4 , also ( bunn , liddle , & wright 1996 ) , @ xmath246 , is lower than the dmr four - dimensional data 1 - @ xmath80 uncertainty estimated in , e . g . , g96 , wright et al . ( 1996 ) , and here . this is because we can consider the effect of all known model uncertainties for the assumed angular / angular spectrum , and account for them , in the most conservative way possible , with small uncertainty . ( in particular : we do not explicitly account for the small systematic difference between the galactic - and model - parameter maps ; we do not assume that any of the small systematic differences correspond to time - independent phase shifts in the observed @ xmath21 values ; and we do not add the systematic changes in time with the model variables . ) since our estimate of the uncertainty is the most conservative possible , our assumptions about model - viability are the least conservative possible . ] . ( compare this to the @ xmath24##7 , 1 - @ xmath80 , uncertainty of 1 . [ 5 ] . ) since part of this uncertainty is due to the other systematic shifts , the maximal 2 - @ xmath80 absolute uncertainty is smaller than even the maximal 1 - @ xmath80 fractional uncertainty . for the maximum maximal 2 - @ xmath80 @ xmath21 ##0 , above , the absolute uncertainty varies between @ xmath248 and @ xmath249 . note that this accounts for intrinsic noise , and noise , and see ( 2 ) ( 3 ) above . other systematic shifts , e . g . , the brightness uncertainty ( kogut et al . 1996b ) , and the beamwidth uncertainty ( wright et al . 1994 ) , are much smaller than the ones we have accounted for here . it has also been shown that there is a non - cmb contribution to the dmr data obtained from known local astrophysical sources ( banday et al . 1996b ) . by analyzing the dmr data using cmb anisotropy spectra at fixed @ xmath1 but also @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 , we have been shownthus the small shifts in the standard normalization model correspond to shifts in @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 . although these shifts may depend on the values of @ xmath1 and the assumed inflation power law , given the observed uncertainties , it is reasonable to ignore these small shifts when normalizing the models used in this work . we have analyzed the open - bubble inflation model , accounting first for the fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) , then the contribution of the fluctuations generated during the first stage of square - wave inflation ( bgt ; yst ) , and finally , for the contribution from the non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) . for observationally viable open - bubble models , the observable predictions do not depend significantly on the latter two types of anisotropy . the observable predictions of the open - bubble inflation model appear to be that it seems that only those fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble need to be accounted for . as mentioned in the article , a number of more specific models of the open - bubble inflation model have recently come under investigation . these are based on specific assumptions about the vacuum state corresponding to open - bubblenucleation . in these theoretical models of the open - bubble inflation scenario there are a number of additional mechanisms for high - energy inflation ##s ( in addition to those in the models discussed here ) , including those that come from cracks in the bubble walls , as well as those associated with the nucleation of a nonzero open bubble . while current analyses suggest that such effects also do not add a significant amount to the variation observed during the evolution inside the bubble , it is important to continue to pursue these investigations and to more carefully assess the robustness of the open - bubble inflation scenario itself , as well as to try to find a new particle - theoretical model of the open - bubble inflation scenario . as has been already noted for the cmb - angular models ( g96 ) , the various different dmr data can lead to slightly different @ xmath21 normalization amplitudes , but still within the expected uncertainty . this uncertainty level is slightly reduced if one considers data from analyses either excluding or including the quadrupole moment . the dmr data alone can then be used to compare @ xmath1 over to @ xmath14 in a more significant fashion for the open bubble considered here . itis , however , reasonable to assume that when the quadrupole model is excluded from the analysis , the @ xmath9 model with longer spectral lines is more consistent with the dmr model , while the quadrupole - included analysis favors @ xmath12 ( for the open - bubble inflation model in the range @ xmath250 ) . current cosmographic analyses , in conjunction with the large - scale gravitational estimates according to the parameters of the dmr - normalized open - bubble inflation model described above , favor @ xmath202 . the maximum uncertainty in is partially a consequence of the current uncertainty in @ xmath10 . this range is consistent with the range weakly predicted ( @ xmath9 ) by the quadrupole - included analysis of the dmr model above . it might also be argued that mild bias is indicated both by the need to reconcile these higher values of @ xmath1 with what is determined from large - scale gravitational models , as well as to reconcile the smaller dmr - [ @ xmath251 $ ] values ( for this maximum range of @ xmath1 ) with the larger observed galaxy distance values ( e . g ., etc . [ 2 ] ) . in comparison with the low - density low - @ xmath18 cdm model , we have shown that in the low - density flat - core cdm model one can adjust the value of @ xmath1 to accommodate a small fraction of the theoretical constraints . for a broad class of these models , with large gaussian initial low - density perturbations , this focuses mainly on values of @ xmath1 that are larger than the range of values for @ xmath10 inferred from the observed heavy - element spectra in comparison with the atomic models . whether this additional cdm is nonbaryonic , or is simply baryonic material that does not take part in standard nucleosynthesis , remains a major theoretical puzzle for these models . we acknowledge the efforts of those contributing to the @ xmath0 - dmr . @ xmath0 is maintained by the office of materials science of nasa headquarters . we also acknowledge the efforts and contributions of j . baugh , j . cole , j . garriga , j . kolatt , c . smith , l . piccirillo , g . rocha ,m . tucker , m . weinberg , and k . smith . it is funded in part by a pparc grant and kbn grant 2p30401607 . 1 . the differences , @ xmath253 , are the two spatial anisotropy multipole coefficients @ xmath56 computed from the two boltzmann transfer codes ( and found to agree with @ xmath254 ) . dark type is for the open - bubble inflation model spectrum accounting only for perturbations that are generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( type [ 1 ] spectra above ) , and light type is for the open - bubble inflation model spectrum above , accounting for perturbations generated in the first phase of inflation ( type [ 2 ] spectra ) . dark lines are for @ xmath255 and dashed lines are for @ xmath256 . these are for @ xmath64 and @ xmath65 . note that @ xmath257 . 1 .

viable observations of @ xmath212 . the square squares represent the real - space of costa et al . ( 1994 ) ssrs2 + cfa2 ( @ xmath278 mpc ##2 ) optical galaxies data ( and were very kindly provided to us by c . johnson ) . the square squares represent the [ @ xmath279 depth ] depth - based results of the tadros & efstathiou ( 1995 ) analysis of the @ xmath133 qdot and 0 . 2 jy optical galaxy data . the square squares represent the real - space results of the baugh & efstathiou ( 1993 ) analysis of the apm optical galaxy data ( and were very kindly provided to us by c . baugh ) . it should be noted that the mean - mass ( or distance ) power estimates do not account for any distribution of mass with respect to distance . they also do not account for time or just - in - time ( when applicable ) corrections nor for the survey sample size . it should also be noted thatthe observed data error bars are determined under the assumption of a specific inflation model and a specific evolution scenario , i . e . , they do not necessarily account for these additional sources of uncertainty ( e . g . , gaztaaga 1995 ) . we emphasize that , because of the above assumptions , the two spiral - power spectra shown in the panel are defined somewhat differently and therefore can not be directly directly compared to each other . 2 . x - bandtemperature measurements and observational data , as a series of multipole @ xmath66 , to @ xmath280 . the two pairs of light curves ( with different linestyles ) at the boundaries of the four nearly overlapping wavy spiral ##s ( hatched with straight lines of different linestyles ) in panel ( a ) are dmr - derived open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ) models for what would be expected by a series of ideal , double - bubble wave - function , models ( see ratra et al . 1995 for details ) . panel ( b ) shows dmr - derived cmb power spectra with the same model parameters for the x - space .- w spectrum - standard ( w83 ) . the model - prediction values are : @ xmath177 , @ xmath281 , @ xmath282 , @ xmath283 gyr ( dot - dotted lines ) ; @ xmath72 , @ xmath284 , @ xmath8 , @ xmath285 gyr ( solid lines ) ; @ xmath256 , @ xmath286 , @ xmath287 , @ xmath288 gyr ( dotted lines ) ; and , @ xmath69 , @ xmath289 , @ xmath8 , @ xmath290 gyr ( dotted lines ) for more information on these parameters see ratra et al . ( 1995 ) . for a pair of model - prediction yield parameters , the lower one is equal to the lower 1 - @ xmath80 @ xmath21 ##0 calculated from the analysis of the x - ray data used for the high - resolution radio ##metric ##s and from the @ xmath291 version of the model , and the upper one is equal to the upper 1 - @ xmath80 @xmath21 was derived from the analysis of the ecliptic - coordinate maps ignoring the radio emission , and derives the @ xmath85 moment from the data . amongst the single - source inflation models of fig ( 1 ) , the @ xmath72 model is close to what is favoured from the analysis of table 10 , and the @ xmath256 model is close to that favoured from the analysis of table 11 . the @ xmath177 model is on the edge of the allowed region from the analysis of table 11 , and the @ xmath69 fiducial cdm model is incompatible with cosmographic and large - scale astronomical observations . a small fraction of the small - scale inflation data from these papers are described in ratra et al . ( 1995 ) and ratra & sugiyama ( 1995 ) . note that , as stated in these papers , most of the data points come from reanalyses of the observational data . there are 14 detections and 22 non - @ xmath80 upper bounds shown . since most of the smaller - scale data points are derived from the high bandpower cmb anisotropy inflation model , which is more suitable for narrower ( non @ x##math66 ) using functions , we have obtained the observational results from the largest window available . the data shown are from the dmr - based analysis ignoring the optical absorption spectrum ( grski 1996 , open circle with @ xmath292 ) ; from india ( ganga et al . 1994 , as analyzed by tucker 1995 , solid diamond ) ; tenerife ( tucker et al . 1996a , solid five - pointed ring ) ; bartol ( piccirillo et al . 1996 , solid diamond , suggesting that optical resolution may be an issue ) ; sk93 , individual - chop sk94 ka and q , and individual - chop sk95 ka and q ( netterfield et al . 1996 , solid diamond ) ; sp94 ka and q ( gundersen et al . 1995 , the points shown here are from the optical bandpower analysis of ganga et al . 1996a , solid diamond ) ; points 1 - 3 ( tucker et al . 1996 , comparing @ xmath293 with @ xmath294 from 1 to 20 , and accounting for the @ xmath295 measurement error , open circle ) ; points - g , - r , and - s ( p .cf . , platt et al . 1996 , open zero - point problems ) ; tau ( e . g . , masi et al . 1996 , using the hercules and hercules + tau scans are ; note that the hercules + tau ##rus has a larger measurement uncertainty of @ xmath296 , solid solutions ) ; max3 , multi - channel max4 , and max5 ( e . g . , tanaka et al . 1996 , using the max5 mup ##1 - @ xmath80 ##k - @ xmath297k - @ xmath298 , lim et al . 1996 , open diamonds ) ; msam92 and msam94 ( e . g . , inman et al . 1996 , open diamonds ) ; wdh13 and wdi , respectively ( e . g . , griffin et al . 1996 , open diamonds ) ; and cat ( griffin et al . 1996 cat1 at @ xmath299 with @ xmath294 spanning 351 to 471 , and cat2 at @ xmath300 with @ xmath294 spanning 565 to 710 , both allowing for an uncertainty of @ xmath301, solid triangles ) . detections have vertical 1 - @ xmath80 error bars . solid - triangles incorporated into the test symbols correspond to nondetections , and are placed at the vertical 1 - @ xmath80 value . vertical error bars are not used for non - detection . as discussed in ratra et al . ( 1995 ) , the @ xmath302 ( 0 ) error bars also account for the calibration uncertainty ( but in an indirect manner , except for the sp94 ka and ka values from ganga et al . 1996a see ganga et al . 1996a for a discussion of this issue ) . the observational data points are placed at the @ xmath66 - value at which the experimental test function is most sensitive ( this reflects the fact that the sensitivity of the experiment is highly dependent on the absolute value of the sky - anisotropy signal , and thus gives a somewhat misleading impression of the multipoles to which the experiment is ; see ganga et al . 1996a for a discussion of this issue ) . for the dmr values at @ xmath303 , the horizontal lines on the observational data points represent the @ xmath66 - the value of thethe transfer function ( again , the effect of the sky - based model ) . note that from an analysis of the large number of the models ( corresponding to estimates of the effects ) shown in these panels , grs ( figs . 5 and 6 ) conclude that all the models shown in panel ( 5 ) , including the fiducial cdm model , are consistent with the global anisotropy model .
