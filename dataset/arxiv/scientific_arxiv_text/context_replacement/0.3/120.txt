in the past , many new oscillation ##s have been reported by different collaborations @ xcite , and a phenomenological extension of the standard model has been proposed that involves three neutrino mass scales , over which the three types of energy are averaged . despite many successful predictions , this can be considered as an extension of the standard model that does not address fundamental issues , e . g . , large masses and large mixing angles compared to the sector , and has raised a large question over the possible physical properties of neutrinos that could lead to a more complete understanding of nuclear physics @ xcite . to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenology the reduction of uncertainties in baseline nuclear oscillation ##s is mandatory . because of the interest in experimental results , in recent years , neutrino - nucleus differential cross sections have been reported @ xcite and are expected in the near future @ xcite . differential cross sections are important to gain a complete kinematical understanding of nucleus - nucleus scattering and a better understanding of nucleus - nucleus scattering is required for the analysis of experimental results . the argoneut collaboration has recently reported @ xcite a model of themuon - charged - current ( cc ) flux - averaged differential cross section on @ xmath0ar in the energy range up to 50 gev . the liquid crystal detector is particularly interesting because it has the potentialities to make accurate measurements of a very large range of particle energies from the mev energy scale to multi - gev events @ xcite . the argoneut experiment has proven the validity of this experimental technique and , hoperfully , new results will be obtained in the future . for instance , the range of neutrino capture cross sections for solar sources that could be measured by this new generation of detectors is included in @ xcite . the energy region measured in the argoneut experiment , with average neutrino energies of @ xmath1 gev , requires the use of a relativistic model , where not only relativistic physics is considered , but also particle dynamics and current physics are considered in a single model . the first measurement of the charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe ) flux - averaged charge - averaged muon neutrino cross section on @ xmath2c by the miniboone detector @ xcitehas undergone extensive discussions . in particular , the nuclear cross section is significantly reduced by the standard fermi gas model and by the more sophisticated model based on the impulse approximation @ xcite , unless the nucleon axial mass @ xmath3 is significantly enlarged with respect to the theoretical energy value of 0 . 03 gev / @ xmath4 . it is reasonable to assume that the larger axial mass obtained from the miniboone effect on @ xmath2c can be interpreted as an impulse approximation to include nuclear effects that are not taken into account by the model ; this is another indication that a better knowledge of electron - nucleus cross sections , where uncertainties about nuclear effects are reduced as much as possible , is necessary . moreover , a model able to describe electron - nucles ##ons should first be tested against electron scattering experiments in the nuclear kinematic region . at high energies , quasielastic ( qe ) electron scattering experiments @ xcite , which were able to accurately reproduce a wide range of experimental data , can provide a useful tool to study neutrino - induced processes . there are , however , indications that the reaction can include significant contributions from sources using the impulse approximation ( ia ) in some energy regions wherethe neutrino contribution has a great importance . for instance , in the models of @ xcite the contribution of multinucleon interactions to ccqe ##2 has been very important and able to keep the results in line with the experimental miniboone cross sections without affecting the sensitivity of @ xmath3 . the role of processes involving two - body currents according to the experimental data has been established in @ xcite . a detailed evaluation of all nuclear effects and of the relevance of multinucleon interactions and of the non - nucleonic contributions @ xcite would be , without a doubt , necessary for a better understanding of the reaction mechanism . the role of final state effects ( fsi ) has been clearly established for the experimental @ xmath5 reaction , where the use of a generalized wave function ( op ) in the distorted - wave interference effect ( dwia ) is used @ xcite . the imaginary part of the op is an approximation that reduces the cross section and accounts for the contribution of part of the electron flux from the elastically scattered beam to the inelastic channels which are open . in the exclusive reaction only the neutral lepton is observed , the final - state is not observed and the open and closed channels contribute. therefore , a different treatment of fsi is required , where all bound - state channels are considered and the total flux , although different among all the channels , is conserved . several approaches have been used to include fsi in relativistic calculations for the inclusive qe electron - and two - particle scattering @ xcite . in the relativistic plane - wave scattering approximation ( rpwia ) , fsi are simply neglected . in other approaches fsi are included in dwia , where the final bound state is modeled with two potentials , either retaining only the small value of the relativistic energy - dependent complex action potential ( rrop ) , or with the same relativistic mean action potential ##s , describing the initial bound state ( rmf ) . although considering the latter , the rrop is neglected from a theoretical point of view . on the contrary , the rmf , where the same strong energy - independent real potential is used for the initial and final states , fulfills the dispersion relations @ xcite and satisfy the wave equation . in the two approaches of fsi relativistic green function ##n ( rgf ) techniques @ xcite ,2 . in the rgf model , under suitable approximations , which are not equivalent to the ia , the components of the nuclear force are expressed in terms of the single particle - model green s ##nr ; its explicit representation , that is based on the biorthogonal expansion in terms of a non - hermitian optical potential @ xmath6 and of its hermitian derivative @ xmath7 , can be exploited to avoid the explicit calculation of the single particle ' s energy and of the components of the hadron tensor @ xcite . we consider the elements of the same type as the dwia components of the exchange process in @ xcite , but involve eigenfunctions of both @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 , where the second part has an even sign and has in one case a loss and in the other case a gain of 1 . the rgf model allows us to reconstruct the energy lost into nonelastic channels in the absence of the inclusive response , from the complex optical potential which describes elastic nucleon - electron interaction data and to include contributions which are not found in the rmf and in other models based on the ia . however , with the presence of the same complex optical potential , theprovides a consistent description of fsi in the experimental and in the inclusive scattering . in addition , because of the unique properties of the optical potential , it fulfills the phase selection rule @ xcite . these consistent descriptions of fsi have been obtained in @ xcite for the inclusive qe electron scattering , in @ xcite for the ccqe electron scattering , and in @ xcite with the ccqe and nce miniboone scattering . while rmf and rgf are able to describe the shape of the ccqe experimental data , only the rgf gives cross sections of the same magnitude as the experimental ones without the need to change the value of @ xmath3 @ xcite . similar results were obtained in @ xcite , where the rgf values and their significance in comparison with the nce data from miniboone are discussed . in this article the results of the experimental models of fsi for the @ xmath8 - inclusive scattering are presented and compared for the total cross section obtained over the @ xmath9 argoneut flux . we are aware of the many questions that can be related to the use of models developed for the qe scattering in the kinematic ., with the @ xmath9 argoneut , up to @ xmath10 gev , where the processes in the ia , which are not included in the processes considered here , will give important results . and we hope that our results will give important information about the importance of these processes in the analysis of @ xmath11ar , and about the uncertainties which are related to their existence . for the reaction @ xmath0ar @ xmath12 as a function of the muon angular momentum @ xmath13 . the data are from argoneut @ xcite .

[ csteta ] the cc differential cross section @ xmath22 integrated over the argoneut flux is calculated as a function of the muon decay coefficient @ xmath13 . all the calculations yield results in close agreement with the experimental shape but generally underpredict the magnitude of the experimental cross section . we note that in the rpwia fsi is slightly different , but in the rmf the same , energy - independent chemical equation is obtained for decay and scattering states. the results of the rgf ##s together with the edad1 , dem , and undem models , give an indication of how the predictions of the er are affected by differences in the determination of the phenomenological op . the results depend on the region and time , and are all related to the same second part of the two potentials , which accounts for the overall effects of inelastic channels and is not univocally derived from the same phenomenology . in contrast , the second term is similar for both parameterizations and produces different results . we note that the dem and undem potentials produce very general close results ; in fact , even if they are obtained with very different measurement procedures @ xcite , they are based on the same dataset of self - scattering parameters . in constrast , the edad1 potential produces somewhat different , and larger results in comparison with the results of the dem and undem models : for example , in the same region with @ xmath23 deg , the rgf - dem and rgf - edad1 cross sections differ by about @ xmath24 . the rgf cross sections are much larger than the rpwia and the rmf respectively , but they arein is significantly better than the data , but for @ xmath25 deg and @ xmath26 deg . in the rgf the imaginary part of the optical potential represents the flux from all the solid - state channels and , in each channel , the flux lost towards other channels is divided by the flux gained from the other channels . the differential cross sections in the rgf arise from the translation to the inclusive strength of the overall effects of the channels which are not described in the other models such as , for example , rescattering processes of the proton during its passage out of the nucleus , non - nucleonic @ xmath27 , which can occur during nucleon transport , and also some multinucleon processes . these effects are not described explicitly in the rgf , but they can be described , to some extent , by the imaginary part of the phenomenological op . we note that in all the models presented in this article we have used the standard value of the axial potential @ xmath28 gev . a larger value of @ xmath3 would increase the cross section and improve the agreement with us . - ref . [ cspmu ] the cc ##d crosssection @ xmath29 , over the argoneut , is shown as a function of the muon of @ xmath30 . also in this case the rpwia and the rmf models are better than the experimental data , but the rgf produces better cross sections which are in good agreement with the ia . anyway , the other two channels in the lower energy bins of @ xmath30 are included in all the results by a factor of @ xmath31 . all the models which have been adopted for the present calculations are based on the ia , where the cross section is given by an infinite sum of interactions between the incident neutrino and all the other nucleons of the nucleus . and the rgf , which is a more complex model and , with the use of the new op , is able to recover sections of channels which are not included in the experimental data , is also based on the ia . models based on ia have been used in the calculations of qe exclusive and inclusive electron scattering @ xcite . furthermore , the rgf is able to give a detailed description of ccqe and nce miniboone scattering sections @ xcite . in the article cc ##e - electron scatteringfor energies larger than a few gevs , however , all these calculations may neglect the components of reaction rate which cannot be included in the experimental cross section . it is therefore not surprising that the theoretical cross sections in fig . [ csteta ] and [ cspmu ] are much smaller than the experimental data . [ in rgf - dem . [ csrgf - area - dem ] , title = " fig : " ] + but in rgf - dem . [ csrgf - area - dem ] , title = " fig : " ] - 0 . 5 . with the aim to obtain a more accurate result we have tried to estimate the accuracy of our calculations . the most important source of uncertainty is the electron flux : it is usually known with low accuracy but its errors are not known @ xcite . for energies up to @ xmath32 gev the argoneut flux is calculated in bins of resolution of @ xmath33 and @ xmath31 gev and , for each bin , we compute an averagecross ##age starting from five or six calculations at different energies . it is straightforward to see that this approach introduces some uncertainty in our results . in figs . [ csrpwia- area ] and [ csrmf - area ] we present our results for the @ xmath22 and @ xmath29 - cross sections in rpwia and in rmf . the figures in the figures show these two values , in quadrature . in the interval of @ xmath13 and @ xmath30 covered by the argoneut kinematics the measurement errors are generally small and neither the rpwia nor the rmf cross section can reproduce the observed values within the specified range . this is a good result since the rpwia and rmf cross sections in each interval are identical and the uncertainties on the electron flux are generally small . in the case of the rgf we consider two different types of error . the rgf ##s shown here show the values of both terms of the hadron flux in eq . ( 2 ) of @ xcite . the calculation of the second term , which is large compared to the imaginary part of the op , is a hard and time consuming mathematical task which requires the computation of all the eigenfunctions of the full spectrum of the optical system . the assumptions on this problem are not under consideration and , from the calculations in both directions ,has been estimated at most within @ xmath34 . the fact that for the rgf calculations we have to use a phenomenological ##ly dependent op presents additional difficulties . the equations for @ xcite have been tested for values up to @ xmath35 gev and to provide results up to @ xmath36 gev we have to extend the range of values of these parameterizations . this has been done for each term of the op by a realistic function of the energy that has been chosen to carefully reproduce the behavior of the op at @ xmath33 gev . we have found that our results do not depend significantly on the energy used . the rgf - dem @ xmath22 and @ xmath29 differential cross sections are shown in fig . [ csrgf - dem - dem ] , where the error bands represent all the values that we have given them in advance . similar results with higher uncertainties were obtained in the cases of rgf - undem and rgf - edad1 . the error bands for the rgf calculations are larger than for rpwia and rmf and , as a consequence , the upper limits of the rgf cross section are close to the limit .this uncertainty can be attributed to the moderately high uncertainties on the cross section in each experimental channel of high energy , in particular for neutrino ##s of @ xmath37 gev and the energy transfer to the nucleus . the large error figures in fig . [ csrgf - em - dem ] do not allow us to draw a definite conclusion . however , the results obtained in this work show that the rgf , as well as the other models based on the ia , cannot underpredict argoneut data , since they are able to predict the shape and the correct order of magnitude of the experimental cross section . in this paper we have compared the predictions of the relativistic models of fsi for the proton - electron interactions with the argoneut data . in the rpwia fsi are neglected ; in the rmf they are modeled using the same relativistic mean field as used in describing the initial - state ; in the rgf the full complex op , with its real and imaginary parts , is used to account for fsi . when final - state channels are included in the rgf , the energy transferred in each channel is recovered in the other channels by the imaginary part of theop making sense of the dispersion relations and the total energy is useful . the rgf provides a graphical representation of the @ xmath19 model in the qe region and it is also able to describe the ccqe and nce miniboone reactions . in the rgf cross section the contribution of reaction channels that are included in the other models , e . g . , rescattering effects of the electrons and the electrons out of the nucleus , non - nucleonic @ xmath27 processes , which can occur during wave propagation , with or without real energy production , and also multinucleon processes , are translated , to some extent , into the mathematical form of the analytical part of the phenomenological op . however , the contributions of the various reaction channels included in the phenomenological op , can not be disentangled and the shape of the cross section can not be attributed to any particular process . in order to resolve this issue , a detailed determination of all the effects and of the rate of multinucleon processes and of some non - nucleonic contributions , as well as a detailed determination of the actual op , which also fulfills the above criteria ,would reduce the theoretical dependence of the rgf . our results give a good indication that ia - ii methods are able to determine the exact order of particles and the shape of the argoneut , but they still underpredict the experimental cross section , in particular for the values of @ xmath30 and for values of @ xmath13 , @ xmath38 deg and @ xmath39 deg . a careful study of the medium effects is required to clarify the data points to the most useful strenght . in particular , a careful study of medium effects in the sub - gev energy region that takes into account quasielastic , nuclear , as well as non - inelastic effects , is highly desirable . 89ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx # # ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ` ` ` ` # ` ' ' ' ' @ noop [ 1 ] secondoftwosanitize @ url [ 0 ] + 12 $ 12 & # # 1212 _ 12 % 12 @ startlink [ 1 ] @ endlink [ 1 ] @ # @ innerbibemptylink : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 107 . 052010 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 107 . 241801 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1140 / epjc / s10052 - 013 - 2345 - x [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop * * , ( ) @ noop * * , ( ) @ noop * * , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 107 . 161801 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 85 . 032007 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 85 . 052009 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 131801 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 171803 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 108##8 / 1674 - 1137 / 2013 / 10 / 011001 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 191802 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 70 . 072003 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 83 . 112007 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1155 / 2013 / 163897 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1155 / 2013 / 852987 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 70 . 083522 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 70 . 073006 [ * * , ( ) ] https : / / 10 . doi . org / 1475 - 7516 / 2011 / t = 09 / i = 034 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 70 . 07##3004 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop * * , ( ) @ noop * * , ( ) @ noop ( ) , link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevd . 85 . 012005 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 161802 [ * * , ( ) ] miniboone , @ noop * @ xmath8a , @ noop t2k , @ noop @ noop ( ) , link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevc . 85 . 014607 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 85 . 132301 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1016 / j . physletb . 2011 . 07 . 032 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevc . 82 . 055501 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevc . 82 . 015501 [ * * , ( )] @ noop * * , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1016 / 0370 - 1573 ( 81 ) 90132 - 0 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop _ _ , , vol .
