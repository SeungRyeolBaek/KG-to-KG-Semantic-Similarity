real time operation of the power grid and calculation of electricity prices @ xcite require accurate estimation of grid structure and its state variables . remote sensing units ( rtus ) transmit measurements collected from different grid components to the central control center for state analysis and subsequent use in calculating grid prices . the collected measurements can be broadly classified into two kinds : meter readings and breaker status . the breaker statuses on transmission lines help create the current operational topology of the grid . the meter readings , consisting of line voltage and line current level measurements , are then used to determine the state variables of the grid topology . in a controlled setting , the collected measurements suffer from noise , that is detected at source or during communication to the control center . the affect of such noise is reduced by use of redundant / additional sensors and use of other bad - signal detection and correction techniques like the estimator @ xcite . cyber - attacks on the power grid refer to manipulation of measurements ( meter readings and breaker status ) by an attacker , aimed at changing the state estimation output , without getting detected by the estimator or sensors . the viability of such attacks has in fact been demonstrated by controlled experiments like the cyber attack in department of energy s - plant and the spoofing attack in phasormeasurement units ( pmus ) @ xcite . past literature on cyber - security has mainly looked at attacks that change meter data ( and thus breaker statuses ) to affect state estimation . hidden data attacks and injection of malicious code into meters were first discussed in @ xcite . using a simple data flow model for state estimation , the authors of @ xcite provide an attack design using projection matrices . following this , several approaches have been developed to study hidden data under different security conditions . these include mixed integer programming @ xcite , heuristic based detection @ xcite , graph based detection @ xmath0 relaxation @ xcite , graph - based ##off construction for meters with phasor measurement units ( pmus ) @ xcite among others . the possible security ill - affects of the hidden data attacks on financial markets are presented in @ xcite . in a recent article @ xcite , the author discusses data attacks under the more realistic and potent conditions of topology changes ( breaker statuses ) and meter data corruption . all of these cited attacks on data integrity or privacy and security attacks , respectively , involve changing floating point meter data in real time . the practicality of this is questionable as significant resources are required to synchronize the data at multiple times . thethis paper , we focus on the attacks that can occur through changes in breaker status . here the adversary changes the statuses of a few operational breakers from @ xmath1 ( closed ) to @ xmath2 ( open ) , as well as blocks ( blocks the flow ) of flow measurements along a subset of the lines in the system . however , the adversary does not change any meter reading to an optimal value . we describe these attacks as breaker - only attacks . note that breaker statuses , not meter readings , are binary in nature and transmitted with high frequency . they are thus resistant to change , even by adversaries with limited resources . jamming itself , through theft or by destruction of sensitive equipment , is technologically less intensive than changing meter measurements . in addition , it does not raise a false alarm . signal loss due random communication drops occurs under normal circumstances . the breaker - jammer attack model was developed by the authors for grids with a complex network topology requiring sufficient line flow measurements in @ xcite . this work generalizes the model to any grid with both flow and injection , and uses a simple graph - coloring technique to determine the optimal hidden attack . our graph coloring based model is in principal similar to @ x##cite which studies standard data analysis as a graph partitioning algorithm . however , the algorithm fails there . our attack model does not use sets of data readings . different breaker status changes and line flow jams provide a different set of necessary and sufficient conditions for different attacks . the surprising revelation of our paper is that under normal operating conditions , a single breaker status change ( with the necessary flow measurement values ) is sufficient to create an undetectable attack . in fact , we show that if a hidden attack can be created by changing the status of a set of breakers , then a hidden attack with only one break status change exists as well . this is surprising as the adversary will focus on making the necessary flow measurements , not finding a breaker to attack . therefore , our attack model does not depend on the current system state or transmission line measurement values , and has low memory requirements . the rest of this paper is presented as follows . we present the system model used for generalized state machines and describe the attack design in the next section . the graph ##ing algorithms to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a hidden attack and elucidating them are discussed in section [ sec : design ] . the design of the actual hidden attack is discussed in section [ sec : design ] , with simulations onieee test standard . finally , concluding remarks and further details of work are provided in section [ sec : 1 ] . next , we give a brief description of the # ##s . we represent the initial operational state of the network by graph @ xmath3 where @ xmath4 denotes the set of buses / nodes of size @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 denotes the set of operational edges of size @ xmath7 . the set of circuit - statuses for the edges is denoted by the diagonal matrix @ xmath8 of dimension @ xmath9 . we assume that all have to be initially operational ( @ xmath8 = incidence matrix ) and ignore the non - operation line for ease of analysis . the node to node incidence matrix is denoted by @ xmath10 of dimension @ xmath11 . each operational edge @ xmath12 has column @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 has a corresponding row @ xmath15 and @ xmath10 , where @ xmath16 . @ xmath17 has the corresponding basis vector in @ xmath18 with zero at the @ xmath19 node . the direction of flow at node @ xmath12 isseems to be from @ xmath13 to @ xmath14 , without any loss of generality . we use the dc power grid model for state estimation in this model @ xcite . the state vectors in this model are the line injection measurements , denoted by the @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 . the set of measurements is denoted by the matrix @ xmath22 . here line flow measurements are included in @ xmath23 and line flow measurements are included in @ xmath24 . state estimation of the power grid relies on the breaker statuses in @ xmath8 for state estimation and then uses the state vector @ xmath25 for calculating the state vector @ xmath21 . the relation between @ xmath21 and @ xmath25 in the above model is given by @ xmath26 where @ xmath27 is the geometric mean gaussian state vector with the matrix @ xmath28 . @ xmath29 is the measurement matrix and depends on the grid topology and susceptance of the system . let the @ xmath30 entry in @ xmath25 correspond to the state vector of the @ xmath12 . then @xmath31 ( the @ xmath30 row in @ xmath29 ) is given by @ xmath32 = m _ { ab } m _ { ab } \ label { aligned } \ label { aligned } \ ] ] with the non - zero values at the @ xmath19 and @ xmath33 entries respectively . @ xmath34 is the susceptance of the line @ xmath12 . on the other hand , if the @ xmath35 entry refers to the actual measurement of line @ xmath13 , we have @ xmath36 . in vector form , ignoring measurement errors , we can use it for the data . @ xmath37 @ xmath38 is the diagonal matrix of susceptances of lines in @ xmath6 . we rotate the rows in @ xmath10 so that the top @ xmath39 rows represent the lines with flow flows . matrix @ xmath40 , consisting of the top @ xmath39 rows of a @ xmath9 diagonal matrix , represents these flow flows . for ease of use and reference in later sections , we add the zeros to matrix @ xmath23 and make use ofand @ xmath7 . next , we pad the all - square matrix to @ xmath40 to make it a generalized square matrix of dimension @ xmath7 . @ xmath41 on the other hand consists of the columns of @ xmath10 that correspond to the rows with injection coefficients . the minimum state vector estimate @ xmath42 is denoted by : the residual @ xmath43 . if the minimum state does not satisfy a certain threshold , bad - data detection will turn on and data correction is performed by the estimator . the combined process of topology and state estimation , followed by bad - data detection and correction is called generalized state estimation ( gse ) @ xcite as shown in : [ algorithm ] . [ estimator ] * : * : * we assume that the adversary is unknown and has no information on the current system state @ xmath21 with line susceptance of @ xmath38 . for attack , the adversary knows the breaker status on the lines . the new breaker status matrix , after attack , is denoted by @ xmath44 where the matrix @ xmath45 has a value of @ xmath1 for the lines . similarly ,the available flow measurements after jamming are denoted by @ xmath46 , with diagonal line @ xmath47 having a value of @ xmath1 corresponding to jammed flows . let the new flow measurement obtained during the breaker - jam attack be denoted by @ xmath48 , where @ xmath49 denotes the attack . note that if the flow measurement on a line is not jammed , its value remains the same following the attack . using ( [ flowmat ] ) , we get @ xmath50 it follows immediately that if the flow measurement on the @ xmath51 line with injection measurement is changed ( @ xmath52 ) , to avoid confusion , the injection measurement has to be changed as well ( @ xmath53 ) . therefore , @ xmath54 uses the injection measurements ( @ xmath24 ) instead , which are not used during the attack . the jam attack leads to removal of lines marked as violated from equation ( [ injmat ] ) , resulting in the following equation . @ xmath55 equation ( [ injcond ] ) now states that during the breaker - jammer attack , for each injection measurement , the number of original flows corresponding to lines with jammed breakers ( the side) , to be caused by changes in estimated state on lines ( connected to the reference bus ) whose signals are intact but whose voltage ##s is not received ( right side ) . therefore , for the state vector of the adversarial attack ( with one only considered reference bus with phase angle @ xmath2 ) we use @ xmath56 the necessary conditions for a feasible anti - jammer attack that result in a change in estimated state vector consists of equations ( [ flowcond ] ) , ( [ breakjam ] ) , ( [ injcond ] ) , and ( [ rank ] ) . in the next section , we describe a graph coloring based analysis of the necessary and sufficient conditions and use them to guide design of feasible attacks of our attack . for our graph coloring based analysis , we use the following coloring ##s : _ for any line @ xmath57 in the estimated state vector , all lines with same value of @ xmath57 are the same color . _ using this , we can define a suitable graph coloring corresponding to the requirements of a feasible attack described in the previous section . equation ( [ flowcond ] ) states that if the flow of line @ xmath12 between line @ xmath13 and@ xmath14 is not corrupted , @ xmath58 ( same color in our graph ) . therefore , _ * the set of buses connected through lines with different flow measurements ( not corrupted ) have the same color . * _ this implies that the interior buses , following a feasible attack , can be divided into groups , each group having a different color . the lines between each of these groups do not have any flow measurements or are corrupted by the adversary . a test example is shown in figure [ fig : graphcoloring ] . consider the buses with injection measurements , that are not corrupted by the adversary . for an interior bus @ xmath59 , ( all neighboring nodes have the same color as itself ) , the right side of equation ( [ injcond ] ) equates to zero . the left side becomes equal to one , under normal operating conditions , if lines between lines connected to bus @ xmath59 are not corrupted . thus , we have _ * a feasible attack , for lines with attacked colors connected to interior buses . * _ a boundary bus is one that has internal buses of colors different from itself . a bus @ xcite with flow measurements at all lines and injection measurements at lines @ xmath13 , @ xmath##14 and @ xmath59 . the blue , green and black buses are grouped into groups and have same value of node @ xmath57 in the following table . the two green lines represent jammed lines , the black lines represent dead lines . the grey lines with red bars represent the lines @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 with incorrect breakers . , scaledwidth = 42 . 0 % , scaledwidth = 42 . 0 % ] [ fig : graphcoloring ] next , consider the injection meter placed at any boundary bus . such meters can exist in two forms : a ) connected to lines with incorrect breaker ( see node @ xmath13 if ( [ fig : graphcoloring ] ) or b ) connected to dead lines with correct breaker statuses ( see @ xmath14 if node @ xmath61 does not have a breaker attack ) . in either case , using ( [ injcond ] ) , we have : _ * the injection meter placed at a boundary bus has one value relating the value of @ xmath57 for the two dead lines . * _ for further analysis , we will use the same algorithm as in figure 1 to construct a reduced weighted average @ xmath6##2 from @ xmath63 as follows : * 1 * . for each colored group , club boundary buses without injection measurements with adjacent interior breakers into one supernode of that color . club boundary buses with injection measurements into supernodes with the same color . remove supernodes of same color with adjacent buses of zero susceptance . * 2 * . for each line with interior breaker between two buses of different color , add a line of same impedance to their adjacent supernodes . remove supernodes connected directly to adjacent supernodes of same color . * 3 * . make injection measurements on supernodes equal to the values of original flows on lines with attacked breakers connected to them ( positive for inflow , negative for outflow ) . if the incident line has attacked breakers , make the flow equal to @ xmath2 . . the blue , green and black solid lines represent original flows for buses @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 and @ xmath59 respectively . the flow between the two red lines are not affected after attack . the white lines with red points represent lines with attacked breakers , that influence the flow of supernodes @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 . , scaledwi##dth = 22 . 0 % , scaledwidth = 1 . 0 % ] [ fig : supernode ] the [ fig : supernode ] is the reduced graph system for the graph in figure [ fig : graphcoloring ] . note that in the reduced graph @ xmath62 , the lines between buses of same color are ignored . the original lines are between buses of different colors and have missing or incomplete boundary measurements . also , the length relation ( [ injcond ] ) between the vertices are trivially satisfied by @ xmath57 and are ignored . the reduced graph , however , also includes results from boundary injection ##s that are similar in form to equation ( [ injcond ] ) as shown below : @ xmath64 ##a , @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 are supernodes of different colors . the numeric value for the value of supernode @ xmath13 is given by @ xmath65 ( see the @ xmath19 example for @ xmath66 ) . @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 are the susceptance set and edge sets corresponding to the reduced graph @ xmath62 . @xmath69 denotes the injection measurement on supernode @ xmath13 with value given by the @ xmath70 in the reduced graph construction . satisfying that condition ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) for the injection measurements requires computation of the susceptance and laplacian ##s for @ xmath62 . the unique solution of @ xmath66 for @ xmath62 in turn produces a uniquely identified @ xmath57 in @ xmath71 after the adversarial attack . we now arrive at condition ( [ 1 ] ) , allowing for unique state estimation after a single adversarial attack in terms of graph constraints . the reduced graph @ xmath62 has simplified our problem here . first , it is assumed that each color must represent at least one supernode or a different supernode ( of different color ) with injection constraint . otherwise the solution of @ xmath66 for that color will not appear in the injection constraint . this protects against errors of state estimation . note that the number of degrees of freedom in @ xmath66 ( for distinct values of @ xmath57 ) is no less than the number of colors in each superdenotes the reference phase change of @ xmath2 . for @ xmath62 , we prove the following theorem about permissible sample size for state estimation . [ oneless ] by the breaker - jammer theorem , the number of injection measurements at the boundary buses should be one less than the number of independent measurements at the boundary buses . let the number of colored variables be @ xmath72 . then the number of independent entries in @ xmath66 is @ xmath73 ( one entry in @ xmath2 ) . the total number of linear constraints involving the color values in @ xmath66 is equal to the number of linear measurements involving the supernodes in @ xmath62 . for unique state estimation , the number of injection measurements should either be greater than or equal to @ xmath73 . we can show that only @ xmath73 injection measurements are needed to get a solution to state estimation . consider the reduced case @ xmath62 . for real - line susceptances and for cases where the supernodes and injection measurements do not form a closed ring with no additional constraints ( see also [ fig : supernode ] ) , the rank of @xmath73 also contains @ xmath73 and we have unique weight estimation . if the grid graph @ xmath62 contains a complete ring of supernodes with injection measurements , then the weights will be the entire susceptance weighted by laplacian of the ring , that is rank 1 . however , the - valued entries of @ xmath74 that exist on the right side of ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) and are derived from flows on lines with attacked breakers , will not cancel out under normal operating conditions . further , the adversary to the algorithm is unaware of the actual ring weights and will be unable to determine if they exist . hence the @ xmath73 injection measurements and will be mutually independent ( the adversary will expect this under normal operations ) . this gives an example @ xmath66 and @ xmath57 for a @ xmath72 - based grid graph . to summarize , the following theorem and theorem [ oneless ] provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a simple anti - parallel attack under our graph - coloring approach . in the next section , we show that the graph coloring approach proves a useful tool that allows the construction of afeasible attack . we consider a breaker - jammer - attack optimal if it requires minimum number of breaker status changes ( considering the fact that doing so is much more resource draining than measurement jam ) . if feasible attacks are designed using the minimum number of breaker changes , we consider as optimal the attack that requires the least number of flow measurement jams . using the reduced graph @ xmath62 , we present the following formula for the minimum number of breaker changes required for a feasible attack under normal operating conditions ( non - zero real - world bus susceptances and line flows that are distinct for all grid elements ) . [ oneenough ] if a feasible attack can be designed with @ xmath72 breaker status changes , then a feasible attack succeeds provided that all but one breaker change are converted back to their normal operational state ( @ xmath1 ) , while keeping their line flow measurement jammed . construct the reduced graph @ xmath62 with its two supernodes for the feasible attack with @ xmath72 breakers and line flow measurement jam . let the number of colors in the value of @ xmath57 be @ xmath75 . the value of @ xmath66 is therefore @ xmath##75 . by theorem [ oneless ] , there are @ xmath76 constraint measurements on the supernodes that satisfy the equations listed above ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) . if we revert the breaker status of an attacked line back to @ xmath1 while keeping the flow measurement jammed , the only change in any constraint equation ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) for that line will be that the injection measurement on the incident line ( instead of @ xmath77 ) will be @ xmath2 . since only the two breakers are changed back to the operational state , at least one injection measurement on @ xmath77 will still be non - zero and the @ xmath76 constraint equations will still have some inndependence . thus , state estimation will result in a different but non - zero @ xmath66 , leading to a feasible attack . for example , consider the case in figure [ fig : graphcoloring ] where the breaker statuses are compared . if the breaker status of line @ xmath61 is changed back to @ xmath1 while keeping the flow measurement jammed , the new state graph that will be created is given in figure [ fig : superno##de1 ] . as stated in figure [ oneenough ] , the above attack is still valid and a non - zero change of breaker always results . the case shown in figure [ fig : graphcoloring ] , starts with line @ xmath61 being changed to a dotted red line . the blue , green and red solid circles represent the nodes for line @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 and @ xmath59 respectively . the blue and the dotted red lines are not used . the only flow line with red bar is the line @ xmath60 with the attacked breaker . , scaledwidth = 33 . 0 % , scaledwidth = 22 . 0 % ] [ fig : supernode1 ] this is a very good example and simplifies the algorithm for an effective attack vector . since the breaker change is zero , the attacker can attack each line in turn ( @ xmath7 iterations ) , attack its breaker ( with the breaker set in line @ xmath45 to @ xmath1 ) and determine the flow lines that need to be changed ( given by diagonal @ xmath47 ) to conduct a successful attack . the breaker change that requires the least number of cycles .( = maximally sparse @ xmath47 ) . then give the optimal attack . the set of jammed measurements , after determining @ xmath45 , is known as ( [ opt _ attack ] ) . @ xmath78 this is simplified to formulation ( [ opt _ attack1 ] ) where the jammed measurements ( with @ xmath1 on top of @ xmath47 ) are replaced by the non - zero entries in @ xmath79 . @ xmath0 ##9 can be used to efficiently solve ( [ opt _ attack1 ] ) . since the attacker has no access to the actual input vector @ xmath21 , the remaining non - zero @ xmath21 value , unavailable line susceptance @ xmath38 are replaced with other random variables . these replacements , under certain conditions , do not give the optimal solution but they give the values ##ity of the constraints given by ( [ reducedinjcond ] ) . @ xmath80 the rank problem ( [ rank ] ) is not included in the optimization model and must be solved manually after determining @ xmath47 , for consistency . + * note : * we based our optimization model on ieee @ xmath81 and @xmath82 and test ##er @ xcite and present averaged findings in figure [ fig : topologyplot ] . for each individual line considered , we take flow measurements on all lines and voltage measurements on a fraction of lines , selected randomly . to determine a possible attack involving each line , we change the breaker status and solve problem ( [ test _ attack1 ] ) to jam flows and to prevent detection . this is repeated for each line to determine the optimal attack . in figure [ fig : topologyplot ] , note that the average number of flow measurements jammed increases with the increase of injection constraints . this is due to the increase in the number of injection ##s that require more measurement jams . [ fig : topologyplot ] in this context , we study fault tolerant cyber - attacks on electrical grids where the attacker changes the breaker statuses of some lines and marks them as failures . the attacker also jams voltage measurements on other lines to prevent detection by the same estimator . the attack framework is novel because it does not involve the conversion of corrupted data into meters or knowledge of system history and current system state . using lesser information and less complexity than traditional data mining , our attack regime explores attacks on systems where all the data is protected from malicious manipulation . weprovide necessary and sufficient conditions for the design of feasible attacks through a simple graph - coloring approach . the most important result derived from our work is that optimal topology based attacks exist that require a single flow status measurement . therefore , we provide an optimal framework to select flow measurements that are sufficient to allow detection of the optimal attack . its implementation is achieved through testing on ieee test ##bed . developing optimal schemes for our security model is the core of our security work . 1 . . . . ott , experience with pjm ##s operation , system design , and analysis " , _ ieee trans . security syst . 18 , no . 1 , 2003 . a . abur and a . a . expsito , " system state estimation : theory and applications " , new york : marcel dekker , 2004 . d . shepard , d . humphreys , and a . fansler , evaulation of the vulnerability of phasor network units to gps attacks " , _ ieee transactions on network infrastructure protection _ y . liu , y . ning , and m . a . chen , trace - injection attacks against state estimation in electric power systems " , _ proc . commun . _ _ o . vukovic , j . c . lee , s . dan, and h . sandberg , context - aware detection of data injection attacks on power system state estimation " , _ ieee journal " emerging technologies of communications _ , vol . 25 , no . 1 , 2012 . a . kosut , y . jia , s . j . lee , and l . tong , detection of dynamic attacks on power system state estimation " , _ proc . t . kim and m . poor , strategic defense against data injection attacks on power systems " , _ ieee trans . smart grid _ , vol . 26 , no . 1 , 2011 . d . deka , r . baldick , and s . vishwanath , data integrity on the network of the smart grid : design and protection " , _ ieee " annual meeting _ , 2014 . l . xie , y . li , and m . sinopoli , " data injection attacks on electricity markets " , _ proc . ieee smartgridcomm _ , 2010 . t . kim and l . tong , on dynamic analysis of a smart grid : undetectable problems and defenses " , _ ieee j . trans . areas commun . _ , vol . 1 , 2013 . d . deka , r . baldick , and l. vishwanath , " smart systems with smart software : the case for smart sensors and software " , _ ieee infocom ccses ##s _ , 2014 . a . giani , m . bitar , m . garcia , m . mcqueen , s . khargonekar , and p . poolla , " grid system integrity analysis " , _ ieee trans . on _ security _ , vol . 1 , no . 1 , 2013 . a . abur and a . m . exposito , _ grid - system analysis : theory and practice _ , crc , 2000 .
