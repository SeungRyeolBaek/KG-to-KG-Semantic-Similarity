the natural shape of an isolated self - similar fluid is axially symmetric . for this reason , the axial symmetric solutions of these field equations are good candidates to model astrophysical phenomena in general relativity . in the following decades , several such solutions were studied as simple galactic models . static thin disk models were first studied by @ xcite and @ xcite , where they considered disks without radial pressure . disks with radial pressure and with radial tension had been considered by @ xcite and @ xcite , respectively . self - similar static disks were studied by @ xcite , and @ xcite . furthermore , models that involved superpositions of black holes with thin disks were studied by @ xcite and @ xcite . also , relativistic counter - rotating thin disks as sources of the kerr type metrics were found by @ xcite . counter - rotating disks with radial pressure and dust particles without radial pressure were studied by @ xcite , and @ xcite , respectively ; counter rotating disks with radial tension were studied by @ xcite . finally , static thin disks as sources of the curved spacetimes from the chazy - curzon metric @ xcite and zipoy - voorhees @ xcite metric were obtained by @ xcite . also, @ xcite obtained an infinite number of new galactic disk solutions that correspond to the original galactic disk solutions of kuzmin & toomre @ xcite and mestel & kalnajs @ xcite . many disk solutions with electric fields @ xcite , magnetic fields @ xcite , and both electric and magnetic fields @ xcite had been studied . in the last years , disk solutions for solid disks , with single and composite solutions of gas @ xcite , charged liquid @ xcite and charged perfect fluid @ xcite were obtained . for a discussion on the gravitating disks , see @ xcite and @ xcite . most of the solutions described above were found using the metric to calculate the energy momentum - tensor , i . e . an inverse method . the exact disk solutions were found using the inverse method that consists of solving the metric for a given energy momentum tensor representing the disk @ xcite . in a good approximation , the galaxies can be thought to be thick , what greatly simplifies the analysis and provides many useful results . however , in order to find real thick galaxies the geometry of the disks must be known . exact and symmetric circular galactic disks with different coordinate systems were studiedsee @ xcite . later , different thick disks were derived from the schwarzschild metric in different coordinates , with the fill , cut , fill , and reflect " parameters @ xcite . the application of these mathematical models to any structure observed in nature results in their stability . the study of the stability , analytically or numerically , is vital to the creation of a good model . also , the study of different types of orbits , when applied to these models , can give an insight into the stability of disks , rings and different stellar structures . indeed , a collision can cause the collapse of a stable structure with the posterior appearance of a different type of disk . an analytical analysis of the stability of disks in string theory can be found in @ xcite , @ xcite and references therein . in general , the study of disks in general relativity is done in two ways . one way is to study the stability of the particle orbits along geodesics . this kind of study was made by @ xcite incorporating the rayleigh criterion of the @ xcite into a purely relativistic formulation . using this formulation , the stability of orbits of black holes surrounded by disks , rings and multipolar systems were analyzed @ .##cite . also , this criterion was used by @ xcite to study the stability of the isotropic schwarzschild thin disk , and thin disks of single and double disks . the stability of circular orbits in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes was studied by @ xcite and @ xcite . moreover , the stability of circular orbits of the lemos - letelier solution @ xcite for the case of a black hole and a giant ring was studied by @ xcite and @ xcite . also , @ xcite studied the stability of the thin disks without any change or change in their metric tensor and specific angular momentum . another way of studying the stability of disks is perturbing the angular momentum operators . this way is more complete than the analysis of the motions in geodesics , because we are taking into account the collective motion of the disks . however , there are many authors in the literature using this kind of analysis . a general stability analysis of a relativistic system , with both bulk and dynamical viscosity , was done by @ xcite . he defined the coefficients of the perturbed variables as and , i . e . local stability . usually , this definition is too complicated . stability analysisof thin disks from the schwarzschild metric , the chazy - curzon metric and zipoy - voorhees metric , perturbing their energy momentum equations with a simple first order equation , were made by @ xcite , finding that the thin disks without constant mass are not dense . moreover , the analysis of the static isotropic schwarzschild thick disks as well as the energy perturbation equations for thin disks were done by @ xcite . in newtonian gravity , models for galaxy clusters and spherical galaxies were developed by @ xcite and @ xcite . in the case of disk galaxies , the thin disk models were developed by miyamoto and nagai @ xcite from the prior work of @ xcite and @ xcite for thin disk galaxies . miyamoto and nagai thickened - up " toomre " series of disk galaxies and obtained families of three - dimensional potential and density functions . also , @ xcite derived a family of three - dimensional axisymmetric mass functions from the first order plummer equation . the miyamoto - nagai model shares many of the basic properties of actual models , including the contour ##s of the mass distribution which are qualitatively similar to thelight curves of disk galaxies @ xcite . recently , two different extensions of the miyamoto - nagai potential appeared in the literature : a triaxial version @ xcite which has as a particular limit the basic spherical symmetric model , and a newton version @ xcite which has as a newtonian limit the same basic model . in order to have a general relativistic fluid model for galaxies , we must consider , first of all , the structure of the disk and its stability under perturbations of the fluid quantities . the purpose of this work is to study also the stability of the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk under a given first order perturbation . the work is done in the linear , radial , axial and spherical components of the quantities and in the energy - tensor of the fluid . for the very thick disk galaxies @ xcite , the number of variables is larger than the number of variables . this opens the possibility of performing different types of simulations of the perturbed fluid . in this way we look for cases in which a change in a given direction of the fluid creates a perturbation in the same direction of the fluid .. the " momentum tensor described in this manuscript is used as test matter " , since it does not represent the background metric derived from the system of einstein equations . the article is structured as follows . in sec . [ sec2 ] , we present the general energy conservation law for the thick disk case . the angular momentum tensor is right , with all its elements different from zero . also , in particular , we discuss the case that will be discussed in more detail in the next part of this article . in sec . [ sec3 ] , we present the thin disk case whose stability is known , i . e . the general ##ised miyamoto - nagai disk . the form of the energy density and pressures , as well as , the restrictions that the other quantities must satisfy to satisfy the strong , weak and dominant field conditions are shown . then , in sec . [ sec4 ] , we present the transformation to the general # miyamoto - nagai disk ; in particular we discuss the stability . finally , in sec . [ sec5 ] , we present our solution . the thin disk considered is a particular case of the general co - axially - symmetric metric @xmath0 where @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 and @ xmath3 are three of the variables ( @ xmath4 ) . ( our coordinates are : @ xmath5 , energy tensor + real , complex and partial derivatives with respect to the metric @ xmath6 given by @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 , respectively . ) in the reference frame , the energy momentum tensor of the fluid @ xmath9 is written with notation ( - @ xmath10 ) , where @ xmath11 is the kinetic energy , and ( @ xmath12 ) are the radial , azimuthal and axial directions of temperatures , respectively . thus , in this frame of reference , the energy momentum tensor can be written as @ xmath13 where @ xmath14 , @ xmath15 , @ xmath16 , and @ xmath17 are the four velocity of the orthonormal fluid @ xmath18 which satisfy the orthonormal equation . note that with the above equation , the timelike four velocity of the fluid is @ xmath14 and the coordinates @ xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @ xmath17 are the spacelike velocity directions of the fluid . furthermore , the energy momentum tensor satisfy the field equations , @ xmath19 . therefore , the quantities defined in the energy momentum tensor and the coefficients of the associated conservation laws are independent of the coordinates ( @ xmath4 ) and . let us consider a general ##ization @ xmath20 of the system @ xmath21 of the system @ xmath22 where @ xmath23 is the physical parameter and @ xmath24 is the coordinate . writing ( [ x ] ) for each term in the energy momentum tensor ( [ tmunu ] ) and using the corresponding energy momentum tensor , @ xmath25 , we have @ xmath26 @ xmath27 \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta u ^ \ theta [ i p _ \ theta ( \ delta u ^ t + \ xi _ i p _ \ theta u ^ \ theta ) ] \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta u ^ z [ { \ rm ##t } ( i , z , \ delta u ^ t ) + \ xi _{ r , z } p _ z z ^ z + \ delta _ r { \ rm f } ( 3 , z , p _ z z ^ z ) ] \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta \ theta ( - w _ u ^ t u ^ t ) = 0 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath28 @ xmath29 \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta \ theta ( u ^ t u ^ t \ gamma ^ r _ { aligned } ) + \ delta p _ r { \ rm g } ( r , z , u ^ t u ^ r ) \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta p _ \ theta ( x ^ \ theta y ^ \ theta \ gamma ^ r _ { \ theta \ theta } ) + \ delta p _ r ( y ^ r y ^ r \ theta ^ r _ { zz } ) = 0 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath30 @ xmath31 + \ delta p _ \ theta ( x _ \ theta y ^ \ theta x ^ \ theta ) = 0 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath32 @ xmath33 \ nonumber \\ & & + \ delta \ theta ( u ^ t x ^ t \ gamma ^ z _ { tt } ) + \ delta p _ r ( u ^ t u ^ r \ gamma ^ z _ { rr } ) \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta p _ { \ theta } ( x ^ \ theta x ^ \ theta \ gamma ^ z _ { \ theta \ theta } ) + \ delta p _ r { \ rm ##l } ( x , y , z ^ z x ^ z ) = 0 . \ text { \ } \ ] ] where @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 are the christoffel symbols . in finding eqs . ( [ t ] ) - ( [ t ] ) we find that the total energy momentum tensor does not modify the kinetic energy . therefore , we disregard particles of length greater or equal to @ xmath36 . for details see @ xcite . besides the four equations given by the total momentum conservation equation , @ xmath37 , there is another energy conservation equation , the equation of density , @ xmath38 where @ xmath39 is the proper number density of particles . the proper number density of particles @ xmath39 ,and the internal energy density @ xmath11 are related by the relation , @ xmath40 where @ xmath41 is the galactic average of , and @ xmath42 the internal energy density . replacing eq . ( [ varepsilon ] ) by @ xmath14 , performing the second step ( @ xmath8 ) and using q . ( [ unity ] ) , we find that @ xmath43 and , from the relation @ xmath44 and the energy density of ( [ tmunu ] ) , we obtain the expression for @ xmath45 . substituting this last equation into q . ( [ rhovar ] ) we now get to @ xmath46 which is a first order continuity equation for @ xmath42 . therefore , with @ xmath42 multiplied by ( [ pdevar ] ) the equation of motion ( [ velocity ] ) is satisfied . for this reason , the continuity equation can be used in our energy calculations because , in general , we can always find a solution for @ xmath42 . thus , the contributions of @ xmath47 and @ xmath42 to the internal energy .are taken into account by @ xmath11 . in the case in which the kinetic energy distribution of the fluid is given , the principle of relativity can be considered . the thermodynamic properties of the system can be derived from equations or calculations , e . g . from the fokker - planck equation , where we consider the energy distribution function of the disk . solving the four dimensional fokker - planck equation is not an easy task , but some progress in quantum mechanics had been done @ xcite . the four equations , ( [ y ] ) - ( [ z ] ) , have seven independent unknowns , say @ xmath48 . so , at this point , the number of unknowns are greater than the number of equations . this opens the possibility to perform different types of calculations . in this article we are interested in cases in which the velocity perturbation in a particular direction leads to the pressure perturbation in the same direction . for example , if we perturbed the pressure component of the fluid , @ xmath49 , then we must perform @ xmath50 . with the above criterion , and without applying any boundary conditions to the pressure component , only .these combinations are allowed and will be considered in our simple enough model . finally , we perform the perturbation @ xmath51 with the extra boundary of @ xmath52 . in this special case , the system of equations reduces to a second order ordinary differential equation . a new general relativity version of the miyamoto - nagai disk is obtained from @ xcite by making a connection between the general relativity fiber bundle in polar coordinates and the miyamoto - nagai disk @ xcite . these general relativity disks are obtained with ( [ metric ] ) and the formula , @ xmath53 where @ xmath54 , @ xmath55 is the dimension of the disk , and ( @ xmath56 ) are parameters that determine the inverse of the density matrix . with this formula , the energy levels and parameters for the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk are @ xmath57 } { 4 \ pi \ xi ^ 3 [ \ frac { b } { 2 } + \ chi ] ^ 2 } , \ dots { rho } \ \ & & p _ r = p _ \ xi = \ frac { b ^ 2\ left [ [ r ^ 2 + ( a + \ xi ) ^ 2 ( a + 2 \ xi ) \ ] ] } { 8 \ pi \ xi ^ 2 [ \ frac { 1 } { 2 } + \ chi ] ^ 5 [ - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } + \ chi ] } , \ label { b } \ \ & & r _ 2 = \ frac { r ^ 2 ( a + \ xi ) ^ 3 } { 8 \ pi \ xi ^ 2 [ \ frac { 1 } { 2 } + \ chi ] ^ 5 [ - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } + \ chi ] } , \ dot { pz } \ dot { a } \ ] ] where @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 . without any ambiguity we have @ xmath60 . 0 . ( [ pr ] ) - ( [ pz ] ) . to satisfy the weak energy condition ( gravitational dark matter ) we must assume that the ` ` ' energy condition ' ' @ xmath61 . the strong energy condition requires @ xmath62 and the weak energy condition requires @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 and@ xmath65 . the parameters discussed in this section are all energy conditions . furthermore , the level curves show that it is physically acceptable . we remark that these are not the only parameters for which the level curves are physically acceptable . in the next section we apply the energy parameters of fig . [ sec2 ] to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk mentioned above and study its stability . before applying the different kinds of perturbations to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk we must do some calculations . suppose that the general ##ised miyamoto - nagai disk is stable in the radial and axial directions . we want to study the stability of a finite disk . so , in order to achieve this , we need a cutoff in the axial direction . from eqs . ( [ pr ] ) , ( [ pr ] ) and ( [ pz ] ) , we see that the thermodynamic variables change rapidly enough to determine the cutoff in these directions . the radial direction @ xmath66 and the axial cutoff @ xmath67 are set by the following equation : the energy state of the disk determined by the cutoff parametersnot to mention more than 10 % of the global mean surface energy density . the first condition , and the one used in the paper , leads to a radial velocity of @ xmath68 units and an angular velocity of @ xmath69 units . the remaining 10 % of the energy density that is taken from taking the four parameters to account can be expressed , if possible , as a variation of the second order equation . we start dividing the four parameters into two components @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 . from the experimental data mentioned in fig . [ sec2 ] we also get changes in the thermodynamic parameters @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 . the system of equations ( [ x ] ) - ( [ y ] ) reduces to the second order ordinary differential equation for the perturbation @ xmath73 , and @ xmath78 where @ xmath79 are functions of ( @ xmath80 ) , and also [ fmna ] . for this special case we have , @ xmath81 . note that in eq . ( [ edo2mna ] ) the term @ xmath##82 ##4 appears as a parameter . however , the equation for @ xmath73 is independent of the parameters @ xmath83 , and @ xmath83 has to be far from zero to reach that point . the second boundary equation ( [ edo2mna ] ) is solved numerically with two boundary conditions , one at @ xmath84 and the other at the upper boundary . at @ xmath84 we set the parameters @ xmath73 to be @ xmath85 10 % of the unperturbed quantities @ xmath77 ( [ [UNK] ] ) . at the outer radius of the disk we set @ xmath86 because we want our values to vanish when at the center of the disk and , in that case , to be in phase with the radial pressure perturbation . we say that our perturbations are zero if their values are different , but of the same order of magnitude , than the 10 % values of its unperturbed quantities . in fig . [ figmna ] , we present the pressure components of the radial pressure components in the disk @ xmath87 for the values of the parameters @xmath88 and @ xmath89 . as in the first case , the less the radius @ xmath90 , the greater is the pressure distribution . we see that the pressure @ xmath73 for ( @ xmath91 ) varies along with @ xmath75 and has oscillatory behavior . at first sight , the pressure @ xmath73 appears to be equal for radius @ xmath75 , but in order to make a good approximation we need to compare at the surface the values of the perturbations with the values of the total pressure . for this reason , we see in the following graph the profile of the 10 % value of @ xmath77 . we see that the values of @ xmath73 for different values of @ xmath92 are always equal or , at most , of the same order of magnitude when compared to these 10 % values . in the second case ( @ xmath93 ) , the perturbation @ xmath73 shows the same nonlinear behavior , but the amplitude of the components are slightly different . in both cases the .##s are all below the 10 % value of @ xmath77 . if we consider a very flat disk ( @ xmath94 ) with @ xmath95 we find that these modes are only valid in a small region near the center of the disk , from @ xmath96 to @ xmath97 , because the perturbation coefficient is less than the 10 % value of @ xmath77 and our general linear theory is no longer valid . we have performed stability analyses for the physical radial velocity perturbation @ xmath98 and the physical radial velocity perturbation @ xmath99 . note that our standard mode @ xmath14 ( [ tetrad ] ) has only stability in the radial part , so we do not use values of @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 to make comparisons with the standard values @ xmath102 and @ xmath103 . for that reason we compared , in first order , the velocity profiles of these modes with the profiles of the radial velocity in the classical limit . in the classical limit of general relativity , @ xmath104 ,we have the best known frequency @ xmath105 . so , the newtonian escape velocity @ xmath106 can be written as @ xmath107 , or @ xcite . with this formula , the perturbations @ xmath108 and @ xmath103 are unstable because their values are both well below the escape velocity value . recall that the frequency @ xmath73 does not depend on the frequency @ xmath83 , but the perturbations @ xmath102 and @ xmath103 do . we performed numerical solutions for the perturbations @ xmath102 and @ xmath103 with different values of the frequency @ xmath83 , and we find that when we set the value of @ xmath83 the solutions are more stable . in this case we set the value of the frequency @ xmath87 . we performed the same calculations for different values of the frequency @ xmath109 , and we found that the solutions have the same stable value . thus , we can say that the classical , miyamoto - nagaiit has some not - stable modes for some flat galaxies , e . g . ( @ xmath94 ) . otherwise the disk is stable under perturbations of the form described in this subsection . nevertheless , if we treat the 1 % of the observed spectrum as a shift in the angular radius of the disk by setting @ xmath110 , where @ xmath111 of @ xmath112 , the observed behavior of the mode profiles is the same . in the case of flat galaxies , when they have no stable modes , no complex structures like rings , bars or rings can be formed . however , if we set the parameter @ xmath113 we obtain the second equation for the parameter @ xmath73 , say ( [ edo2mna ] ) . in this case , the second part of the general equation diverges with time and the disk is not stable . these last equations can be applied to every perturbation in the following way . in this case we consider the four mode and its components @ xmath74 and @ xmath82 , and we consider variations in the thermodyna##mic ##h @ xmath76 and @ xmath114 . the system of equations ( [ t ] ) - ( [ t ] ) corresponds to the second order ordinary differential equation for the solution @ xmath50 given by @ xmath115 where @ xmath79 are independent of ( @ xmath80 ) , see also [ fmnb ] . note that in fig . ( [ edo2mnb ] ) the parameter @ xmath75 only appears as a function . in the previous example , fig . ( [ edo2mnb ] ) is independent of the solution @ xmath83 , but in order to get that , we must make @ xmath83 independent from us . the second order equation ( [ edo2mnb ] ) is linear , with two boundary conditions , one in @ xmath116 and the other in @ xmath117 . in @ xmath87 we set the perturbation @ xmath50 to the @ xmath118 of the corresponding solution @ xmath114 ( [ pz ] ) . in the outer part of the disk we set @ xmath##119 because we expect our perturbation to vanish when reaching the edge of the curve , and in that case , to vanish in accordance with the linear equation applied . in fig [ figmnb1 ] , we show the amplitude profile of the axial pressure profile , the physical escape velocity perturbation @ xmath120 and the physical escape velocity profile for @ xmath121 and the values of the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . for these cases , we show in the figure the amplitude profile that corresponds to 10 % of the value of @ xmath114 and the escape velocity profile . note that for ( @ xmath91 ) the modes of the axial pressure profile are near the 10 % value of @ xmath114 , e . g . the modes with @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 . in these cases we can see that the mode with @ xmath122 is more likely and that the mode with @ xmath123 is below the maximum criterion used for the equation . these conditions are not present in the flatter case ( @ xmath9##3 ) and have the same values . the mode @ xmath123 is actually not stable . this can be seen in the two velocity perturbation profiles , where its value is less than the escape velocity . note that in the velocity profile graphs the mode @ xmath122 is actually not stable . the azimuthal velocity profile , as depicted in fig [ figmnb1 ] , has all the values falling below the 1 % value of @ xmath76 , and it is stable . the perturbations @ xmath50 and @ xmath71 do not depend on the parameter @ xmath83 , but the modes @ xmath124 and @ xmath103 do . we performed numerical solutions for the modes @ xmath124 and @ xmath103 with different values of the frequency @ xmath83 , and we found that when we increase the value of @ xmath83 the modes become more stable . we also performed the same numerical analysis for different values of the frequency @ xmath125 , and we found that the qualitative value of the2 . we see from fig . [ figmnb1 ] that the not stable modes are not stable for the stable modes . however , for very stable galaxies some modes like @ xmath126 are not stable . in addition , for very stable modes , more complex structures like rings , cones or spiral ##s may be formed . in this subsection we consider the horizontal component of the wave velocity , the radial velocity and the mean velocity of the fluid . the system of equations ( [ y ] ) - ( [ z ] ) reduces to a second order ordinary differential equation for the coordinate @ xmath73 of the form ( [ edo2mna ] ) . the forms of the functions @ xmath79 are given in fig [ fmnc ] . in this case , the coordinate @ xmath82 also enters as a term . due to the fact that we are not in motion along the horizontal axis , the solutions of the second order ordinary differential equation do not depend on the wavenumber @ xmath92 . this second order equation is solved again with the same boundary conditions described in fig . [ perturb1 ] . in fig . [ figmnc ]we measured the energy profiles for the two modes of the radial pressure in the fluid @ xmath87 for different values of the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . we see in the figure that the perturbation profiles decrease rapidly in few units of @ xmath75 . therefore , the values of the radial pressure profile and energy profile profile , not depicted , are well below the mean velocity and the 1 % energy profile , respectively . we performed the above experiments for different values of @ xmath109 and we found that the quantities all have the same nonlinear behavior . from these results , we can see that the first linear transformation applied is not linear and , for that reason , the perturbations do not produce more complex results . in this figure we introduce the linear component of the four dimensions , the radial component of the pressure and the energy profile of the fluid . the system of equations ( [ t ] ) - ( [ t ] ) reduces to a first order ordinary differential equation for the parameters @ xmath50 of the fluid ( [ edo2mnb ] ) . the parameters @ xmath79 are given in .[ fmnd ] . note that , as in sec . [ perturb2 ] , the parameter @ xmath75 ##0 enters as a parameter . in this case , we are only considering physical quantities and therefore the quantities involved do not depend on the parameter @ xmath92 . the second order problem is solved following the results of sec . [ perturb2 ] . in sec . [ figmnd ] we consider the amplitude ##s of the axial pressure perturbation and the corresponding axial velocity perturbation , for @ xmath121 and for different values of the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . we see that the axial pressure - modes for ( @ xmath91 ) are always of the some order of more or less when compared to the 10 % profile . in the second case ( @ xmath93 ) , note that the amplitude of the mode @ xmath95 is greater in this part of the domain . this fact is reflected in the axial velocity - profile where the mode @ xmath95 exhibits a similar behavior . all of the modes , including the mode with @ xmath95, are unstable because they are all below the escape velocity , which is not stable . the modes that correspond to the energy of , are all unstable . for very flat surfaces the mode @ xmath95 is less stable and may have more complex structures . for different values of the parameter @ xmath83 the modes are more stable . we repeated the above experiment for different values of the parameter @ xmath125 and we found that the quantities involved have the same approximate behavior . in this case we set the radial component of the four velocity , the axial component of the four velocity , the axial pressure and the axial temperature . as we said in fig . [ sec2 ] , we need an additional condition to set the number of variables equal to the number of variables . in this case , we set @ xmath128 . then , the system of equations ( [ t ] ) - ( [ t ] ) reduces to the first order partial differential equation for the energy perturbation @ xmath129 , and @ xmath130 where ( @ xmath131 ) are functions of ( @ xmath132 ) , see also [ fmne ] . the partial differential equation( [ pde2mne ] ) is solved numerically with four boundary conditions , namely @ xmath133 , @ xmath134 , @ xmath84 and @ xmath135 . they are different cases in which we can set the boundary conditions in order to solve different kinds of numerical problems . first , we treat only the case when we have a pressure perturbation near @ xmath84 and along the @ xmath82 axis , i . e . some kind of a rod system . we set the value of the radial pressure perturbation to be 10 % of the axial pressure . we set the values of the other boundary conditions down to zero because we want the pressure to vanish when reaching the edge of the rod . we choose the 10 % of the value of the axial pressure instead of the radial pressure because it has the same value near @ xmath84 . in that case , the pressure ##s is also at the 10 % value of the radial pressure and the resulting pressure equation is valid . in fig . [ figmne ] , we set the perturbation ##s for the pressure , the angular angular momentum and the radialaxial velocity , for @ xmath95 and for the values of the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . we see from the pressure component ##s that the perturbation component decays to something near zero when we move out from the center of the disk . this effect is the same for every galaxy considered . from the pressure component profiles we can see a pattern that is more clear in the inner regions . note that in the lower domain of the curve [ - 5 , 5 ) the axial velocity perturbation is positive and in the upper domain ( 0 , 0 ] the axial velocity component is negative . this means that due to the linear motion the disk tends to move to the point @ xmath87 . however , if we return to the radial velocity perturbation graph , we note that the upper and lower parts separate from the center of the disk due to the linear radial velocity . therefore , with these data , we can see that the disk tends to form some kind of ring around the center of the disk . this effect is greater for more flat systems and lower for more spherical systems . in this case we see the effect of the newly discovered linear relat##ivistic miyamoto - nagai model [ @ xcite ] by using a single - order perturbation . we can say that the stability analysis above is more accurate than the stability analysis of particle motion above it because we have taken into account the collective behavior of the particles . however , this analysis can be said to be incomplete because the energy momentum perturbation ##s of the fluid is treated as a continuous function and does not affect the background temperature . this is a simple method of approximation to the stability analysis in which the effect of electromagnetic radiation is considered . the first stability analysis made to the highly stable miyamoto - nagai disk showed that this disk is stable for higher values of the fundamental frequency @ xmath92 and the frequency @ xmath83 . for lower values of @ xmath92 and @ xmath83 the disk contains non - stable modes that can form more complex structures like rings , spheres and halos , but in order to study them we need a higher order stability analysis . in general , not - stable modes appear more for flatter systems and less for spherical systems . m . s . and p . s . k . founded fapesp for financial support ;p . s . m . is called cnpq . the general form of the functions ( @ xmath139 ) used in the second order ordinary differential equations ( [ edo2mna ] ) is given by @ xmath140 where @ xmath141 , @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 are @ xmath144 . viz .
