observations of type 1 agn show a variety of wide and narrow emission lines that provide valuable insight into the structure and properties of photoionized , and otherwise excited , gas in the vicinity of the narrow ##ly massive star . narrow emission lines , like much larger h @ xmath0 ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * * z10 ) , are likely to arise on or near the accretion disk acting as the gas reservoir for the central supermassive black hole ( * m @ xmath1 * @ xmath2 ) . h @ xmath0 shows a variety of band widths as well as phase shifts and h @ xcite . from this diversity , profiles have emerged and are best determined via the comparison of two type 1 agn sources @ xcite . population a show the typical broad - line widths fwhm h @ xmath0 = 3000 - 4000 and for the narrow ##band seyfert 1 ( nlsy1 ) sources ( fwhm @ xmath3 2000 ) . a h @ xmath0 profiles are the best fit by a simple correlation function . population b sources show fwhm h @ xmath0 =4000 - 12000 and require two gaussians ( one unshifted and one redshifted ) for a reasonable profile description . ` ` broad - line ' ' h @ xmath0 profiles as narrow as fwhm = 2000 @ xcite and as broad as fwhm = 40000 @ xcite have been reported . a is usually radio - quiet and pop . b involves a combination of radio - quiet and the presence of radio - quiet sources . broad - and narrow - line profile descriptions are different and the results can be confusing . narrow - lines like [ oiii ] 5007 are regarded as a reliable representation of the local quasar rest frame except in the presence of ` ` blue lines ' ' , typically found in sources with fwhm h @ xmath0 = 1500 - 3500 and weak [ oiii ] @ xcite . blue lines include [ oiii ] blueshifts as far as @ xmath41000 . in pop . b sources with blueshifted [ oiii ] are found at low z ( or luminosity ) . the use of [ oiii ] and h @ xmath0 spectral line and rest frame shifts shows that broadh @ xmath0 in pop . a sources typically show a narrow red or blue component at the fwhm energy level . a blueshifted component or asymmetry is seen in some extreme feii emission sources . a h @ xcite . b sources show more complex line structure patterns . the h @ xmath0 profile typically has two components : 1 ) a ` ` classical ' ' narrow component ( bc ; fwhm = 4000 5000 ) with no or little ( red or blue ) shift , and 2 ) a very broad ( vbc ; bc ) and redshifted ( @ xmath51000 ) component . studies of the 469 ##2 sdss - dr5 data suggest that these two components represent the underlying stable structure of h @ xmath0 in pop . b sources . broad feii emission has been found in type 1 sources since the advent of infrared spectroscopy in the 60s . feii emission lines are almost absent in a few of the brightest ( and brightest s / z ) sdss quasars ( z10 ) . some evidence has accumulated for the assumption that feii emission occurs in or near the molecular clouds that surround other low ionization sources likeh @ xmath0 ( see e . g . , @ xcite ) . fwhm feii tends to interact with fwhm h @ xmath0 in the narrow range where feii can be produced ( fwhm = 1000 - 12000 ) . this can be clearly seen at h @ xmath6 by observing the shape ( e . g . , shape ) of the feii 4450 - 4700 blue line ( and the feii multiplet emission of # 5018 ) near [ oiii ] 5007 . in pop . a sources the blend resolves into broad lines while it becomes much weaker in pop . b sources . sources with the strongest feii emission can produce a weakening of h @ xmath0 , as expected if the mixture is collisionally quenched in the same dense region where the feii emission can be produced @ xcite . these broad line shifts place significant constraints on parameters for the structure and dynamics of the broad line region . the most famous example involves a systematic blueshift of high ionization lines ( e . g . , civ 1549 ) relative to low emission lines ( e . g . , balmer ) especially in pop . a sources (e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? evidence was recently published ( * ? ? ? * hereafter h08 ) for the existence of a _ low _ amplitude of feii close to [ oiii ] 5007 ( and below the balmer number ) in a sample of type 1 quasars . this anomaly , along with a lower _ feii - amplitude , has been ascribed to feii lines occurring in a region with rotation dominated by infall and rotation of greater radius than the region producing the emission of h @ xmath0 . h08 argue that the amplitude of the line varies significantly with the spectral lines ( h / h @ xmath7 @ xmath8 @ xmath9 ) . interpretations for such a feii model have already appeared @ xcite reflecting the potential importance of such a second - order kinematic model . having worked on the spectra and profile shifts for many years we were intrigued by the h08 claims and decided to test the hypothesis of a systematic feii redshift . could we have missed it ? first let us test what we know . a quasa##rs has highly irregular unshifted r - type h @ xmath0 profiles with fwhm @ xmath34000 . in our work on the two ( @ xmath10 17 . 5 or @ xmath11 17 . 5 ; @ xcite ) sdss dr5 , we collected data for @ xmath4260 pop . b sources ( from our sample of 469 ##4 ; z10 ) and we found no evidence for a large shift of feii lines relative to h @ xmath0 or . such a feii shift should be difficult to detect in the brightest pop . a sdss spectra with narrowest r - line profiles and strongest feii emission . it is also apparent that larger and larger feii shifts are observed for pop . b sources . in the one pop . a source in our sample sdss j0946 + 0139 ##0 we find a large h @ xmath0 or ( 90 @ xmath12 intensity ratio ) redshift of 1830 . this value is similar to oq208 ( @ xcite and measured in h08 ) which is @ xmath13 @ xmath142000 . sdss j##0946 is the largest pop . a source with a large feii redshift in our z10 range ( 1 / 260 ) . z10 includes 19 sources with an h @ xmath0 peak ( 1 / 10 fractional intensity ) blueshifted more than - 320 and 11 sources with the peak shift less than + 320 . the remaining 241 pop . a sources showed no significant h @ xmath0 peak shift ( figure 1 of z10 ) . the feii camera images to these sources show no significant difference in centroid shift between feii and h @ xmath0 . there are two possible causes of small and frequent h @ xmath0 ( or feii ) shifts : 1 ) host galaxy contamination and 2 ) mass extinction . however in rare cases host galaxy contamination is unlikely to induce large shifts with the effect reported by h08 . extreme blue outliers with [ oiii ] blueshifts in the range 400 - 1000 are rare and therefore can not be the cause of the small and frequent shifts reported by h08 . in fact h08 with criteria 2 are likely to be seriously affected by 1 ) and 2 ) . h08compare 4000 + sources from sdss dr5 with computed s / n @ xmath15 10 . z10 is used dr5 where @ xmath494 % of sources show s / n @ xmath15 10 . our method is magnitude - limited with a much lower mean magnitude limit ( z = 0 . 7 instead of 0 . 5 ) . why did we draw different conclusions about feii data ? a large part of the answer could be how s / n was calculated . compute s / n over the range 44305500 @ xmath16 . this method overestimates the precision of the data because it uses only weak lines in the computation . we compute s / n in the range 5600 - 5800 @ xmath16 , which is free of strong lines and is as close as we can approach to an approximation of continuum s / n near 1 @ xmath0 . using our method the h08 s shows mean and median s / n values of 10 . 1 and 10 . 2 , respectively ; approx . 65 % of s / n @ xmath3 10 . we estimate that all 182 % of our bright stars are included in the h08 s . the majority of the h##08 s sources have lower s / n than those in our sample . we can not estimate reliable feii shift shifts from individual sdss data for sources smaller than about h @ xmath417 - 17 . 5 . in descending order of magnitude our results indicate that the accuracy of feii shift shifts depends on : 1 ) feii strength and feii / n @ xmath0 ##20 s , 2 ) spectral s / n and 3 ) if they depend only on fits to the 4430 - 4680 blend , strength of heii 4686 blend . the individual spectra quoted by h08 _ show _ have high s / n to allow convincing arguments for feii shift and the typical parameter values for these sources are much larger than the values associated with our high s / n values ( for a type a2 source with s / n @ xmath1720 most of parameter estimates are greater than @ xmath181500 ) . individual individual spectra with the highest feii redshift and s / n above the sample median are available from the h08 archive and specfit modelled . using a feii model with fixed values ranging from small up to the largest values quoted by h08 , @ xmat##h19 does not distinguish between zero and e . g . , 1000 redshift for the majority of the sources . the only recourse is to generate high c / d quality spectra . h08 shows that one can either confirm or deny the existence of a systematic feii redshift using composite spectra because of the wide dispersion of fwhm , strength and parameter values for both h @ xmath0 and feii . this is likely true for spectra generated from random subsamples of sources but not so if one generates spectra over very wide ranges of parameter values . one can generate composite spectra over wide ranges of fwhm h @ xmath0 and feii spectra using the 4de1 formalism ( @ xcite ; z10 ) . 4de1 bins a2 ( fwhm h @ xmath0 = 1000 - 4000 , 0 . 5 @ xmath20 @ xmath20 0 . 5 ) and b1 ( fwhm h @ xmath0 = 4000 8000 , @ xmath20 0 . 5 ) are of particular interest because they include the largest number of sources in random samples . specfit ##2 ( @ xcite ; as ##p @ x##cite ) of the a2 median ( involving n = 130 z10 sources ( s / n 110 ) gives the best - fit solution with the feii method . the solution for the b1 median ( n = 131 sources from z10 ; s / n 110 ) is less accurate because samples are smaller and feii weaker . table 1 reports feii template shifts and 2 @ xmath21 ratios for specfit tests used in this study . we also report peak shifts of bc extracted from the two specfit tests , with ` ` core ' ' shifts measured at the centroid of the b sample after the measurement . in no case do we find a significant difference between feii and the reference , or between feii and . we also do not find any systematic feii shifts if we restrict to sources with l / l @ xmath7 ratio @ xmath22 ( h08 ; the shifts may be significant for the l / l @ xmath7 ratios ) . since we find no evidence for systematic feii shifts in our z10 bright quasar data , it is possible to generate feii shift estimates for the h08 sample . we generate them using the 4de1# ##ually consider the range of fwhm h @ xmath0 , feii relative , ( and therefore also fwhm feii ) for each source . since the range of feii width shown for h08 is continuous we focus on the sources with largest quoted mean shifts . if these shifts are not observed , smaller shifts are even less likely to be observed . we therefore focus on the median ##s for the h08 sources falling into 4de1 bins a2 and b1 with h08 feii redshift estimates @ xmath23 ( figure 2 ) . two parameters are used for each spectra bin : 1 ) one with no restriction on feii width ( h08 do not have fwhm feii in their best case and it is sometimes very different from fwhm h @ xmath0 ) and 2 ) one with feii width restricted to the fwhm range of h @ xmath0 in a particular bin ( i . e . , @ xmath24 for a2 and @ xmath25 for b1 ) . upper and lower panels of figure 1 show both a2 ( fwhm h @ xmath0 @ xmath3 4000 ) and b1 ( f##whm h @ xmath0 = 4000 - 8000 ) , respectively ( n = 156 for bin a2 and n = 240 for bin b1 ) . the s / n @ xmath4 = - 60 for the rest . we show best - fit specfit models below . the left and right panels show feii templates fixed to the best fit and 1500 ##0 , respectively . our theoretical model is shown in @ xcite . models for the best - fit are shown in the right panels of figure 2 . measurements are performed over the range @ xmath17 4470 5450 , where feii and spontaneous emission account for the total , making it the best range for the @ xmath26 computations . @ xmath26 values are shown for the range of possible feii shifts . in order to obtain confidence intervals we need a set of fits with maximum @ xmath27 = + @ xmath28 , for maximum @ xmath29 , along with the best fit and a few other @ xmath27 values in proximity to the maximum @ xmath26 . we can see a strong preference for small and near - perfect fits . the significance of @ xmath26 variations isdescribed by @ xmath30 as appropriate for ratios of @ xmath26 and @ xcite . given the large number of degrees of freedom in the frequency range ( 4500 4630 , 5040 5090 , 5310 5360 ) any @ xmath26 differences between two samples become significant at a 50 % confidence level if @ xmath31 . the @ xmath26 results indicate that zero shift and ` ` positive shift ' ' values in table 1 are not significantly different . all fits with shifts @ xmath5 values are not significant . the second panel of table 1 upper right demonstrates clearly that the fit with @ xmath13 = + @ xmath32 ( and even with the fit with the above ) does not reproduce the observed feii lines . both the above and @ xmath19 results carry out a good fit for at least half of the h08 sample ( etc . ) and the remainder to the two very close multiplet of feii lines between the @ xmath0 and [ oiii ] 4959 and on the red wing of [ oiii ] 5007 . the redshifted range extends to include the red wing of the 4450 4700 , and the redthis is confused by the frequent presence of heii 4686 . the spectral line was not included in the h08 study leaving us to conclude that it was not included in their data . it would certainly give the appearance of a part of the feii blue blend , which is the most useful feii diagnostic in the optical spectroscopy of low energy sources ( the blue feii spectrum is frequently affected by coronal lines as well as mgii and star absorption in high energy sources ) . a principal component analysis of the bqs and @ xcite found that heii4686 line width anticorrelates with source temperature ( it is eigenvector ##less ) . there is a tendency for the h08 sources with large feii shifts to favor a smaller and wider ( @ xmath33 ) range of source luminosity than those with near zero variation ( @ xmath34 ) . thus the presence of heii will continue to play a major role in the cases where the largest feii redshifts have been found . show the figures for five cases of feii redshift in their figure below . the five cases with largest feii redshift sources showa large heii signature that , if not subtracted , will increase the statistical significance of any given feii redshift . only the bin involving sources with large feii redshift ( within the uncertainties ) shows any evidence of heii signature . figure 9a of h08 shows that a larger fraction of sources with fwhm values @ xmath35 4000 ( on average ) have large feii signatures . the two parts of our figure also show specfit data superimposed on the b1 ##3 bin constructed from the h08 data with a feii value greater than 4000 . the situation is certainly more complicated than for the a2 composite . it is hard to determine the feii features . they are broad , feii is weak and under these conditions there are serious limits on the accuracy of fwhm and shift estimates for feii ( cf . fig . 3 of @ xcite ) . the same analysis as that for a2 composite shows much poorer results on the feii shift . the best solution yields @ xmath13 @ xmath36 but is not far from the zero sum solution . if one simply computes @ xmath26 values in the range 4474 4640 ,5040 5105 , 5320 5400 , the @ xmath26 monotonically increases from this shift ( figure 1 , lower rightmost right ) , although the effect is minimal until @ xmath17 1100 , where @ xmath37 . b1 feii is too small and the data are too sparse to make inferences about line lengths and frequencies . the claim of the feii results are not , and can not be , confirmed . @ xcite recently published an feii study of sdss quasars and the feii shifts they measure ( their figure 2 ) are much larger than those reported by h08 ( the average feii shift due to the emission lines is approximately @ xmath18 240 ) . referring to our current list of possible sources of error for feii shifts and fwhm estimates leads us to conclude that low mean m / n and above average heii values are the culprits . the fit to the 4430 4680 blue line gives the negative and @ xmath19 results . the absence of heii4686 from the h08 data set results in a tendency for heii to ` ` cancel ' ' the blue feii shift . this effect has atypically low temperature data , where heii is stronger than average , has drove the conclusion that feii was systematically redshifted . we reach this by constructing the heii data from our fits to the bin a2 and b1 data obtained from the h08 sample . feii shifts in lines 2 and 3 of table 1 increase from - 60 to + 770km / s and from 730 to 1570km / s , respectively . the more constraining a2 lines suggest that heii may produce the entire emission pattern claimed by h08 . we _ do not _ find large feii shifts relative to the [ oiii ] and median ##est @ xmath0 ##2 in table 1 agn but do not rule out the existence of large red ( or blue ) shifts in these subsamples . fitting median ##s data from data with the claimed feii shifts ( @ xmath23 ) indicates large shifts with an upper bound @ xmath17 300 for bin a2 . in the case of b1 the best fit is @ xmath17700 but the fit is very poorly constrained . in both cases the shifts are not significantly different from expected . these results do not explain the origin of feii emission from thethe transition comes from the region of the light intensity of . our analysis also shows the use of feii function as a reference . the phase diagram of feii with respect to the region may be useful but a full analysis is required first for determination of the s / t ratio . lcccccc a2 -
