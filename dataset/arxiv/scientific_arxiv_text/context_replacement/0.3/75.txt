almost 100 years ago however , apparently unusual and rare events , called centauros , were observed in cosmic ray ( cosmic ) experiments at emulsion chamber at chacaltaya by lattes and others @ xcite . those events were very different from what is currently observed in crs , with a large number of nuclei and a small number of electrons and gammas , which suggests the existence of very few rapid - gamma - decay events . so , a large imbalance in the number of neutral to neutral pions could be expected . the nature and reality of centauro events started a long debate , that includes the reexamination of the original emulsion chamber experiments , and is still not resolved @ xcite . nevertheless , centauro events were certainly an experimental basis for the development of the theory of disoriented chiral condensates ( dccs ) that emerged in the early 1990s @ xcite . for a detailed review , see ref . @ xcite . assuming that a given nuclear reaction could be heated above the critical ( crossover ) temperature required for chiral symmetry breaking , i . e . for energies of the order of @ xmath1mev @ xcite , and cooled to higher temperatures , the reaction##ral , when melted to zero could decay in any direction in isospin states . besides the normal ( stable ) direction , it could build up as in a metastable , but non - stable state , and later decay to the true , chirally broken state . the discovery that dccs could be produced in high - energy heavy ion experiments stimulated further theoretical advances and further searches @ xcite . most likely the energies achieved by the heavy ion experiments are high enough to produce an approximately chirally broken electron - hole plasma , and the resulting thermal expansion will cool the plasma back to the equilibrium @ xcite , so that the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking and decay can be described in a quench model @ xcite , so that the evolution of the order parameter can be directly affected by the observed behavior that naturally leads to spontaneous fluctuations and inhomogeneities @ xcite . since , by definition , the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking , i . e . the chiral energy , is constant with respect to the vacuum direction ( consistent with the @ xmath2 - direction in standard models for weak interactions ) in the dcc , this would be a good way to explain the spontaneous production ofhadrons unaccompanied by electrons and photons , suggesting the existence of neutral particles with respect to charged pions . regardless of the outcome of the debate on the nature of centauro events , dcc formation appears to be a quite natural phenomenon in the theory of strong interactions . however , given its small nature ( in isospin theory ) , it should be washed out by standard mass averaging techniques . so far , there has been no evidence from cr - cr collisions . motivated by the possibility of obtaining much better results in current ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) showers than in the past , and that an event - by - event model for very high - energy showers may in fact be possible , we consider possible observations of dcc production in subsequent atmospheric showers . if dccs are formed by high - energy nuclear collisions in the background , the relevant effects from the primary shower are very large event - by - event fluctuations in the neutral - to - charged pion ratio , and this could be the outcome of the subsequent atmospheric shower . very simple , yet important results were published in ref . @ xcite . in this paper we look for fingerprints of dcc formation in two different observables of uhecr showers .we present simulation results for the distribution of the maximum ( @ xmath0 ) and minimum of muons on the system , and their contribution to the neutral - to - charged particle fraction asymmetry observed in the strong interaction . to model the effects from the collision of a dcc , we must modify the neutral - to - charged particle fraction , so that the system follows the same trajectory , as will be shown below . although this is only a very crude description of the dynamics of the strong collision , we believe it captures the essential features that need to be tested in order to verify the feasibility of using dccs in uhecr showers . this paper is structured as follows . in section ii we briefly review some aspects of dccs , especially the baked - state scenario and the approximate square root distribution of the neutral pion fraction . in section iii the methodology for the simulation is presented . we present corsika @ xcite , a method for detailed simulation of the cosmic ray caused by high - energy cosmic ray particles . in section iv we review and discuss our results . section v presents our results . it is widely accepted that for high - energy densities , achieved e . g . by increasing dramatically the energy , strong interactions are strongly chiral (it would be an exact symmetry only if the quarks were ( massless ) , so that the chiral symmetry , which is the order constant for that transition , also vanishes . on the other hand , for high temperatures the chiral symmetry has a non - zero value and breaks down the chiral symmetry of ( massless ) particles @ xcite . in a given model , we can calculate an effective potential for the chiral field degrees of freedom and study the effects of chiral symmetry breaking and breakdown . if we restrict our analysis to two types of light quarks , up and down , that can be exactly described by the linear gauge model coupled to us @ xcite . in that case , the effective degrees of freedom are pions , @ xmath3 , and the electrons , @ xmath2 . in the high - temperature limit all field potential ##s vanish , whereas in the vacuum one has @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 , where @ xmath6 is the pion free energy . the simplest model we have in mind is a very high - energy heavy ion accelerator that will produce a massive quark - gluon plasma where chiral symmetry is at 0. if the plasma is quenched to low temperatures by expansion , the system will return to the vacuum with a large number of electrons . however , the evolution can continue along many different paths in chiral space before it finally reaches the true vacuum , i . e . it will ` ` evolve ' ' into different directions , and the ratio of neutral to charged particles produced depends strongly on the chosen metastable state in each event . in other words , the misalignment of the vacuum is reflected in the ratio of charged particles , generating a stable state and an increase in the ratio of charged to neutral pions . this result will be , of course , borne out by event theory . a more detailed theoretical model for the study of dccs , the _ baked - alaska _ scenario , was proposed by bjorken and collaborators @ xcite . consider a high - energy state at high temperatures . before hadronization , most of the energy produced at the collision point is carried out by the outer partons at about the speed of light . this stable and rapidly expanding state separates the relatively cold interior from the outer vacuum . as the state evolves , the interior breaks down and what was previously a global minimum becomes a global maximum . thesymmetry is spontaneously broken and one of the sub - shells should be chosen , with a strong preference for the upper vacuum . however , if the lifetime of the shell is long enough , the resulting condensate in the shell can be viewed from the ordinary direction , since it has relatively low energy , @ xmath7 mev / @ xmath8 @ xcite . when the hot shell hadronizes , the reorientation induced by the external contact is reflected by the surrounding pions , which may be unstable and exhibit changes in the event - by - event distribution . assuming that the interaction energy is large enough to be analyzed semiclassically , one can use the linear combination model with explicit symmetry breaking for the calculation of the field @ xcite . alternatively , one can calculate the energy of this field as the sum of these excitations of pions : @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 is the isospin index . the first expanding shell is represented by @ xmath11 with the charge @ xmath12 , where @ xmath13 is the time where the expansion starts . after the hadronization , the currents @ xmath14 , and the fields @ xmath3decay towards the vacuum into freely moving pions . thus , the pion system is described by the state @ xmath15 where @ xmath16 is a scale factor , and the sum is the isospin directions @ xmath17 . the correlation operator of a pion with momentum @ xmath18 and isospin direction @ xmath10 , @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 is the two - dimensional fourier transform of the source @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 . the number of pions follows a poisson process with momentum @ xmath23 and the number of modes produced per unit of space is then given by @ xcite @ xmath24 statistically , one assumes that the momentum and the chiral orientation of the source @ xmath25 will vary event by event for each mode . let us assume that the vacuum plane is divided into one of the following directions , i . e . : @ xmath26 and that all the states of chiral condensate move in the same direction @ xmath27 in isospin direction : @ xmath28 in some mode of production the neutral pion system , definedthen @ xmath29 has a normal distribution with mean @ xmath30 . in this way , in the case of large numbers @ xmath31 , the probability of all particles being charged is very small . however , if they are the products of a dcc decay , this probability is very significant . in fact , if there is a privileged isospin direction , the number @ xmath27 can point in any direction within the unit sphere . then : @ xmath32 where @ xmath33 is the angle between the charge vector @ xmath27 and the @ xmath34 vector . thus , one finds the following well - known expression for the neutral pion fraction @ xcite : @ xmath35 the probability of more than 10 @ xmath36 of particles being neutral , for instance , is @ xmath37 . the effects of a high temperature initial state followed by a slow cooling process are both possible to happen to heavy ion collisions at the very high energies like those accessible at rhic and to those observed at the lhc , as well as in uhecr collisions in the middle of the atmosphere . the energy aperture of a collision exceeds that of the electron .##er observatory @ xcite ( including shower sampling at ground level and longitudinal field profile measurements ) has been providing high quality data and good statistics in the field @ xcite . therefore , even though the occurrence of a dcc is extremely rare , we feel it is important considering the relevance of such data to the physics of showers measured by uhecr . the neutral pion fraction distribution , eq . ( [ sqrt ] ) , is at the core of our efforts to search for dcc fingerprints in uhecr data . therefore , any attempt to determine the damage caused by the presence of a dcc should consider the sensitivity of a given observable with respect to the neutral pion fraction produced by the primary shower . this fraction is the initial distribution of interactions between the nuclear and hadronic components of the showers . in this paper , we consider two observables which are usually measured by uhecr data : the slant angle in the sky ( defined as the ratio of the particle density along the shower path @ xmath38 and expressed in units of m / @ xmath39 ) at which the shower reaches its maximum development , @ xmath0 , and the number of muons on the ground @ xmath40 . it isnote that the interaction @ xmath0 is affected by the electron scattering cross - section and its associated multiplicity and is @ xcite . if dccs really exist , the conditions for them to be observed should include not only high energy densities , but the regions where these interactions are observed should also be considered as well , since dccs are considered ` ` macroscopic ' ' space - time regions where the chiral region is not moving in the same direction as the interaction . with those requirements in mind , we have decided to experiment with fe initiated collisions at @ xmath41 instead . then , these collisions are favored over peripheral ones by the events with a larger number of interacting particles ( @ xmath42 ) which , in turn , should lead to a higher energy in the first interaction . for the simulations presented in this work , we have used corsika 0 . 617 @ xcite with the statistical methods sibyll 0 . 0 @ xcite and gheisha 2002d @ xcite , for high and low energy collisions , respectively . the dcc - fe initiated collision chain is as follows : large @ xmath43 collisions are selected and their interaction secondaries ( mainly pions and kaons )and ; finally , all of the neutral pions in this mixture are transformed into charged particles ; the resulting particle list is then inserted back into corsika to proceed with usual cascade development through the plasma . such a process is possible for several @ xmath44 collisions and at different contact angles . the first interaction slant of ( @ xmath45 ) distribution for dcc - like showers will therefore be the same as for normal proton initiated showers and central collisions . this is a valid assumption , since the dcc formation process takes place during a subsequent cooling stage of the initial proton burst , with the first interaction cross section being the same as for a fe - fe collision . we note that even though the theoretical approach described here is simplified , the essential parameters of the model are being taken into account . for example , proton initiated showers as well as normal fe initiated showers are being observed . for the normal fe collisions , we have obtained both a sample rich in central ##ities and another sample with all the centralities . for each shower we extract the number of @ xmath0 and the number of muons on the ground . from now on we shall identify our dcc - like proton initiated showers by fe + dcc . [ xmax ] shows the @ xmat##h0 example of the vertical distribution ( @ xmath46 ) leads to an extreme situation situation ( @ xmath47 ) , that is , where all the showers produced @ xmath44 s are released into @ xmath48 . for the distribution of eq . ( [ sqrt ] ) , which peaked at @ xmath47 , the probability for more than 1 % of @ xmath44 s being released is 100 % . four types of showers : the fe ( central collision : fe - central ) , fe ( high centralities ) , fe + dcc and other showers are observed . on can clearly see that the showers generated from the central collision have more than the @ xmath0 , since the higher the probability of the initial interactions the larger is the subsequent shower development in the system . and there is essencially little difference between the fe - central and the fe - dcc showers in terms of @ xmath0 , which might indicate that the more events where the @ xmath44 population is created together with the higher the probability due to the higher probability allow for a complete absence of these showers in the initial interactions . nonetheless , it is clear that one should look for the @ x##math0 ##2 when searching for dccs signatures , and this property is independent of the observed @ xmath44 fraction . another property which can be appreciated in fig . [ xmax ] is the larger @ xmath0 fluctuations for fe - dcc and fe - proton as compared to those of fe and proton with all centralites . this is to be expected , since the fluctuations in @ xmath0 have only two meanings : the the fluctuations in the initial interaction shower of @ xmath45 ( which , in turn , depends on the interaction cross - section ) and those introduced by the shower growth up to the maximum . the latter depends on the initial shower depth ( the multiplicity ) , in average being larger for higher energy showers , i . e . those found in the central collisions . the shower density fluctuations on the ground for the same showers described above are shown in fig . [ mu _ dist ] . as expected , increasing the number of positively charged pions will lead to a corresponding larger density of showers on the ground as the products of the charged particles increase . if one considers both types of information ( @ xmath0 and @ xmath40 ) , one finds a good separation between the fe - dc##c , and all the ground samples , as can be seen from fig . [ scatterplot ] . when collisions with all the samples are observed , iron particles show a positive correlation between @ xmath0 and @ xmath40 . the correlation is such that particles with maximum density at the larger ground levels produce , in turn , a higher muon density at ground level , due to the decrease in the energy in the interaction from @ xmath0 to the ground . whereas for fe - dc ##c one sees no correlation between @ xmath0 and @ xmath40 , for the case of fe - dcc showers , however , a small anti - correlation of [ @ xmath49 g / @ xmath50 / @ xmath51 g . the same provides @ xmath52 g / @ xmath50 / muon . ] , as can be seen from fig . [ scatterplot ] . such an anti correlation can be seen remembering the negative correlation between @ xmath0 and the ground in the first place , with low @ xmath0 density leading , in turn , to high density . if we prefer neutral particles to charged ones , high multiplicity( small @ xmath0 ) events have a larger total number on the ground , compared to low energy events ( large @ xmath0 ) . since the number of muons on the ground depend both on the @ xmath44 and @ xmath53 and on the zenith angle , due to atmospheric conditions , we decided to perform a more detailed analysis for determining those values . using the local discriminant analysis ( lda ) , similar to what has been done with @ xcite we have determined , as a function of @ xmath53 , the ratio of two given by @ xmath54 , with the classification of @ xmath55 , in the two dimensional case ( @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 ) given by : @ xmath58 where @ xmath59 ( @ xmath60 ) is the number of events from population @ xmath56 ( @ xmath57 ) misclassified as @ xmath57 ( @ xmath56 ) and @ xmath61 ( @ xmath62 ) the total number of events in population @ xmath56 ( @ xmath57 ) . as such , wehave used half of the simulated showers , with the other half being used for the determination of the degree of mixing . [ merit ] ( top , bottom and bottom right ) shows again the three - dimensional test plots in the @ xmath63 fraction for the same 4 samples analyzed above and 2 samples of @ xmath44 , @ xmath64 and @ xmath65 degrees . the merit factor for a fraction of @ xmath53 is shown in the bottom right corner of fig . [ merit ] . one assumes that for any value of @ xmath53 , these showers can still be easily separated from fe - dcc , with a factor of 100 % for the whole population of @ xmath53 . for the ##s , of course , as we approach the @ xmath66 level , the separation factor becomes weaker . fe - and ##ities are easier to separate from the normal ( all centralities ) population only at small values of @ xmath53 , where the excess of muons at equilibrium is large enough to segregate the fe - dcc population . fe - dccs , in which the strong interaction produces a large excess of @ xmath44 are very rich in hydrogen and would therefore be very2 . however , even if dccs exist in nature , such non - @ xmath53 particles are highly unlikely to be taken into account the distribution of eq . ( [ sqrt ] ) . a more accurate estimate of the degree of discrimination would be to obtain a priori information on the energy density for proton and neutron , as well as the dcc formation frequency . nonetheless , since neither the cosmic ray particle composition at the highest energy ( @ xmath67 ev ) nor the local dynamics of dcc formation are known , flat answers to these data are the best one can get so far . the recent improvement in quality and statistics of uhecr data brings the need to search for exotic phenomena as well as rare phenomena beyond the standard model . among the latter , dccs have been observed about twenty years ago , yet never detected due to their elusive character . in this case , using meteor shower data , we searched for examples of dccs formed in ultra - high - energy ( @ xmath68ev ) solar heating regions in the upper atmosphere . in particular , we studied the influence of the dcc effect on the observables @ xmath0 and @ xmath40 , via the asymmetry in the energy- to - charged pion ratio at the central collision . for this , we consider only the vertical showers produced by protons and electrons . since dccs are likely to be formed in central collisions , which leads to higher than expected values of @ xmath0 ( a ratio of about @ xmath69g / @ xmath50 as compared to iron , for example ) , one should conduct searches in this range of shower energies . for the same reason , if dcc events are observed they should yield small changes in @ xmath0 . however , based solely on the behavior of this phenomenon one can not distinguish between an air shower and a central collision and showers produced in the absence of a dcc . the formation of dccs is associated with large event - by - event changes in the ratio of neutral to charged pions , @ xmath53 . in particular , for @ xmath53 large or small as compared to @ xmath70 , one should expect a sizable change in the proton ratio on the surface , especially for air showers . this effect was noticed in the case study of mt . @ xcite . in the special case of @ xmath47 , where dcc events lead to high -rich showers , we believe that this correlation distinguishes between the formation of plasma ( except for central collisions ) and the dcc event . for large @ xmath53 , one can also distinguish these two events due to the rapid depletion of hydrogen in the plasma . even in this case , the plasma is not affected by interaction events . for horizontal showers , there is a clear cross - correlation between @ xmath0 and @ xmath40 . this comes about since there is a correlation between @ xmath0 and the first interaction event , as was shown in the previous section . this correlation is not expected for a normal vertical shower . in contrast , for showers , due to atmospheric attenuation , one would expect a positive correlation . even though the model presented here is very simple , it has the advantage of providing a model that is well under control for physics , and we believe it reflects the essential nature of the phenomena considered . nevertheless , a more detailed study , that should contain a description of the dynamics of dcc event , and its dependence on gravity , is certainly needed . we thank f . catalani and j . takahashi for this information . we also thank p . de souza for his time at the usp - so ##as ##p [ fa##pesp , [ 2008 / 04259 - 00 ] . this paper is currently published also by springer , cnpq , faperj , fapesp and fujb / ufrj . j . m . g . _ _ et al . _ , prog . suppl . * 65 * , 47 ( 1971 ) ;
