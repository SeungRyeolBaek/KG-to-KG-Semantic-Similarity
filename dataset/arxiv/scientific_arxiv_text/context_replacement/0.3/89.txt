since its discovery , in 1980 , the quantum hall ( qh ) effect @ xcite has been a very important source of research problems related to interaction and correlation effects in condensed matter physics . the qh effect is observed in two - dimensional electron gases @ xcite ( 2deg ) subjected to a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the axis of the gas . at appropriate electron densities , the 2deg forms an energy state . the qh effect presents itself in the spontaneous and spontaneous quantization of the hall conductance . this effect originates from the interplay between the landau region of the free motion of the @ xcite and interaction modes , which lead to the formation of a new energy state . as a result an incompressible state is formed in the interior of the 2deg . at the surface of a 2deg with the qh effect there are , however , gapless chiral modes that are the quantum equivalent of classical electron orbits . @ xcite in the presence of strong coulomb interactions , these modes can be viewed as the edge plasmon modes . remarkably , it has been predicted @ xcite that , at the fillings of the landau region , in the interaction modes the energy states of the 2deg alsodescribe quasi - particles with _ _ charge _ and _ statistics . @ xcite for instance , in qh , with filling charge @ xmath3 , where @ xmath4 is the atomic number , laughlin quasi - particle will have an elementary charge @ xmath5 , where @ xmath6 is the elementary electric charge . such charges can be scattered along the walls of narrow paths forming quantum mechanical loops ( qpc ) , thus leading to a net current . [ frol - simpl ] the fractional charge of laughlin quasi - particles has been confirmed , however , in measurements of the thermal noise of the electric fields . @ xcite the quasi - elementary charge in these measurements is derived from the fano factor of noise , which is the ratio of the noise power to the measured backscattering current . although , at present , there is no consensus on the interpretation of the experimental results , this type of experiment does not , in itself , represent a direct measurement of the fractional charge of quasi - particles . @ xcite indeed , the fano factor of noise is not absolute and may be reduced or enhanced for various reasons . @ xcite for instance ,the phenomenon called ` ` charge fractionalization ' ' in nonchiral one - dimensional systems @ xcite is a phenomenon of free motion that has nothing to do with the motion of fractionally charged quasi - particles . however , this phenomenon increases the fano factor of noise at very high frequencies . @ xcite a direct description of the quasi - particle charge should rely on its value as a coupling constant in the interaction hamiltonian coupling ##s to the electromagnetic field and on the microscopic behavior of quasi - particles . the most appealing approach is to make use of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect , @ xcite which relies on the fact that the interference of quasi - particles is affected by a magnetic field . for a commonly used formulation of this effect , we consider the gedanken tube experiment shown in the upper panel of ref . [ frol - simpl ] . quasi - particles of charge @ xmath7 traverse two different paths and two beams that have a _ z _ z flux @ xmath8 . the relative phase of the two beams , for the upper and lower path , is altered by an amount of @ xmath9 , which leads to a decay in the current from the beam to theand as a function of the period @ xmath8 with quasi - particle period @ xmath2 . the quasi - particles can then be detected by measuring their contribution to the ab effect from electron states with period @ xmath0 . electron states with quasi - particle periods larger than the flux quantum have been observed in a number of experimental experiments @ xcite involving qh interferometers of the fabry - prot type . in these experiments , chiral edge states of a qh loop form a loop . the magnetic flux through the loop is changed either by changing the direction of the applied magnetic field , or by changing the edge of the qh loop with the help of a modulation gate . the theoretical interpretation of the experimental evidence for demonstrating a quasi - particle ab effect is controversial . nevertheless , it is the subject of a scientific debate for the following reasons . first of all , fluctuations of the current through a fabry - prot interferometer as a function of the magnetic flux could result from the coulomb blockade @ xcite rather than from interference effects . second , the original gedanken model of the ab effect described above requires a homogeneous magnetic field threading throughthe surface of the sample is exposed to quasi - particles . this is not the case in the experiments , see fig . [ ] , where quasi - particles are directly affected by the magnetic field . third , and most importantly , the gedanken interpretation of the standard model itself leads to a conclusion : for any electronic system , including all qh systems , ab oscillations should have an electronic period @ xmath0 , according to the byers - yang law . @ xcite this is correct , because , upon adiabatic injection of a flux quantum through a hole in the sample , an electronic system returns to its equilibrium state , since the flux quantum can be removed by a single - valued magnetic field . the first two equations can in principle be solved by using a qh interferometer of a different type , namely the electronic analog of the classical mach - zehnder ( mz ) detector . @ xcite very recently , ab oscillations in these interferometers utilizing qh liquids with high filling temperatures have been the subject of both experimental studies @ xcite and theoretical research . @ xcite a typical electronic mz interferometer is sketched , below , in the right section of fig . [frol - simpl ] . in this case the 2deg is confined to a region with a shape topologically similar to an annulus , i . e . , the so called corbino disk . chiral edge channels are used in place of optical beams and the qpcs ( separated by dashed lines ) play the role of optical beam splitters . ohmic contacts are connected to the inner and outer edge of the corbino disk and serve as a source and sink for the beam . although mz interferometers are more expensive to manufacture , they have an advantage over fabry - prot interferometers : first , electrons in two edge channels of the disk move in the same direction and without delay , because they are excited by the current . as a result , the electron blockade can be overcome in these devices by strongly coupling the edge states to the electrons . second , a large magnetic flux can , at least in theory , be generated in the hole of the corbino disk , i . e . , in the region not restricted to electrons . therefore , electronic mz interferometers can be considered to be the solid - state equivalent of the gedanken devices shown in the right panelof m . [ frol - simpl ] . they may thus provide an effective theory for addressing the third problem mentioned above , namely the paradox associated with the byers - wilson equation . there have been several successful attempts to resolve this paradox . @ xcite in early work [ ] , thouless and gefen have studied the energy spectrum of a qh liquid confined to a corbino disk and weakly coupled to electrical contacts . they have shown that as a result of the quasi - particle tunneling between the inner and the outer layers of the corbino disk , the energy spectrum , and therefore , ` ` any other physical quantity ' ' is a linear function of the magnetic flux with the electronic period @ xmath0 . although thouless and gefen have made an important first step towards understanding the casimir effect in qh liquids , their work is only qualitative , and some of their statements about the tunneling mechanisms and currents are not fully justified . @ xcite the results of their work are difficult to interpret at the level of effective theories . and , more importantly , they can not easily be generalized to the case where the magnetic flux is varied with the help of a high voltage . this situation has attracted much attention at thefractional ab effect in mz interferometers . more recently , a number of authors ( see ref . [ ] ) have proposed that the correct design of the mz interferometers should take into account the presence of additional quantum numbers in the qh domain . in the classical limit , averaging the quasi - particle states by these quantum numbers is sufficient to determine the full ab periodicity . these quantum numbers are usually introduced ad hoc , with limited precision . depending on the current theoretical discussion , they are expressed either in terms of quantities called klein factors , the klein factor , @ xcite or as the phase shifts induced by quasi - particles located at the outer edge of the corbino disk . @ xcite we are aware of only one attempt to theoretically explain the presence of klein factors in mz interferometers : in their recent paper [ ] , ponomarenko and averin propose the resummation of electron tunneling processes between the inner and outer edge and claim that there is a limit to weak quasi - particle tunneling , where the klein factors arise naturally . however , their analysis is done only at the level of an effective theory , where weak quasi - particles and weak electron tunneling between the two fixed pointsof a renormalization group theory . there is no guarantee that other considerations will yield the same result . the results of the experiment [ ] can be summarized as follows : they resolve the byers - yang paradox by stating that ab oscillations with quasi - particle periods can not be observed in the steady - state state of the mz gate . in other words , these measurements do not discriminate between the effects of a singular ##ity , a gate , and a homogeneous magnetic field . our results do not agree with this statement . in previous work , @ xcite we have argued that quasi - particle ab particles should be observable if the magnetic field is varied by deforming the surface of the qh system , or , alternatively , by changing the strength of the homogeneous magnetic field . we have proposed to use this effect as a useful tool for experimental measurements of the behaviour of quasi - particles with different filling factors . in the present work we establish the theoretical basis for this effect . our results can be verified experimentally by pinching together the qpcs and comparing the regimes of weak quantum mechanics and of weak quasi - particle scattering , where the periods of ab particles should differ from each other by afactor of @ xmath4 . our mathematical models are constructed on three different levels : by considering a microscopic wave equation for the ground state of an mz system , constructing an effective theory from it , and describing the relaxation of the system to a stationary state with a master equation . [ mz ] at the end of the effective theory we arrive at the rather surprising conclusion that the ab effect , in its original formulation , @ xcite is not produced by qh interferometers . in order to clarify this important claim , we first note that the original formulation of the effect relies on a two - particle model , where the particle wave travels through the medium , as shown in the right panel of fig . [ frol - simpl ] . while traveling through the upper and lower paths of the interferometer , the particle wave accumulates a phase space containing three components : a thermal and a kinematic component , and the two mechanical components . this picture is quite appealing and is very commonly used in the physics literature . however , for the description of the ab effect , this model is unsuitable , because at high energies , the relative phase can be neglected . therefore , it is more appropriate to consider the relative phase of thewave function overlaps between the two beam directions . moreover , in correlated systems , such as qh liquids , the many - particle description is , strictly speaking , not applicable . in particular , the classical ( gedanken ) description of the geometry effects may lead to serious misconceptions and problems , one of them being the byers - johnson paradox ; ( see also the discussion in sec . [ conseq ] ) . thus , we propose to use many - particle wave function models . to this end , we consider a simple model of the mz interferometer as shown in figure . 1 qh liquid with central point @ xmath3 is confined to a gap between two circles of points @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 . by rotating the centers of the two circles , we deliberately break the axial symmetry in order to reproduce the geometry effects and to obtain the general version of our results . the inner and outer regions of the qh liquid are connected to the gap between points @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 via strong electronic interactions . the interaction between the qpcs is modeled by quasi - weak interactions between points @ xmath14 ,@ xmath15 , and @ xmath16 , @ xmath17 , are indicated in fig . [ mz ] in straight lines . the motion of the qh liquid is described by the laughlin - taylor wave function , in fig . ( [ w ] ) and ( [ w - ring ] ) . we generalize the laughlin wave function , in order to take into account the motion of the qh liquid , by the modulation gate , fig . ( [ w - modg ] ) . then the same method can be used in order to model a qh liquid of any shape . this will allow us to use @ xmath18 and @ xmath19 in order to model realistic qpcs . finally , the effect of the singular flux function of the liquid on the interferometer is described by the wave function of eq . ( [ w - magn ] ) . it turns out that the wave function of ( [ w - matr ] ) at the point @ xmath20 , i . e . , the matrix product of the quasi - linear tunneling matrix ( [ w - matrix ] ) , is a single - valued function of @ xmath20 , for any n, @ xmath21 , of quasi - particles in the spectrum . this means that the commonly used formulation , @ xcite according to which every quasi - particle carries a ` ` statistical phase tube ' ' seen in other quasi - particles with an induced phase tube , does not apply _ naively _ to mz ##s . more precisely , in the presence of a singular magnetic field @ xmath8 , the laughlin wave function ( [ h - magn ] ) contains a time - dependent phase , which depends _ _ on the interaction _ between electrons and the field _ . in other words , the ab phase from the magnetic flux is canceled , locally , by the phase induced by the local properties of the laughlin wave function in relation to the magnetic flux . this process is independent of the structure of the qh spectrum and leads to an exact calculation of the relative ab phase from the scattering spectrum ( [ h - e - ab ] ) . thus , we arrive at the rather surprising conclusion that the ab phase , in the original formulation , @ xcite does not exist in qh interferometers . however , in response to local edge deformations induced by the magnetic field , as described by w . ( [ w- modg ] ) , the wave functions and , consequently , the wave amplitudes have a relative value proportional to the total strength of the total magnetic field in the qh region enclosed by the interferometer . this phenomenon leads to oscillations in the plasma with quasi - particle states @ xmath2 . note that this phenomenon , which we want to call a _ quasi - particle ab ##lation _ , does _ not _ satisfy the byers - wilson theorem . in order to apply these results to the two - dimensional 3d model of the qh effect , @ xcite we consider the incompressible deformations of the ground state of the mz interferometer , as shown in fig . [ def ] , below . the microscopic wave function resulting from these deformations , given by ref . ( [ wave - amplitude ] ) and ( [ wave ] ) , is parameterized by an arbitrary set of variables , @ xmath22 . we use the classical wave equation @ xcite and follow the steps of ref . [ ] in order to projection the microscopic hamiltonian onto the space of these variables . after the transformation , the variables @ xmath22 transform into oscillator operators , @ xmat##h23 , with the linear dependence ( [ commut - mic ] ) . these operators are _ gapless _ plasmon waves at the surface of the qh liquid . the projected hamiltonian ( [ app - mic ] ) contains the oscillator energy with a linear dependence and the net potential energy , which depends on the number of quasi - electrons , @ xmath21 , and the number of electrons , @ xmath24 , in the qh system . the projected energy operators take the form of tunnel operators ( [ app - tunnel ] ) . however , we do not find any trace of klein ##ian @ xcite in the tunnel operators . moreover , contrary to previous suggestions , @ xcite the tunneling hamiltonians at different points in space do not agree with each other ( see appendix [ app - comm ] ) . we conclude that the high - energy theory so far agrees well with the effective theory of wen and one of einstein , @ xcite generalized so as to take into account the small size of the qh system and the presence of a modulation field and of a singular magnetic field . at the level of the effective theory , the three contributions to the total phase space of thecurrent oscillations , the casimir , kinematic , and ab phase described above , acquire the same interpretation . @ xcite the ab phase has its origin in the fluctuations of the charge density at the temperature described with the help of the oscillator equation , @ xmath23 . these fluctuations suppress the casimir effect at high energies and can be suppressed at low energies . the kinematic phase can be interpreted as a series of zero modes . in order to interpret the ab phase , we note that the effective theory in fig . [ ] and [ ] arises as a direct contribution to a general chern - simons theory @ xcite in the bulk of the 2deg in the absence of an external electromagnetic field . in this theory , the ab phase is taken up by a wilson loop [ see eq . ( [ 1 - tun ] ) ] along the boundary contour . there are two contributions to this loop : one is due to the gauge field describing the singular magnetic flux ; the other contribution comes from the charge density at the boundary , as a result of an adiabatic variation of the singular ##ity . it turns out that these two contributions cancel each other exactly , and that the total energy due to a singular magnetic fluxvanishes . for the first gauge we consider , the effect is topological in nature and can be viewed as part of the singular ##ity of the qh liquid . we propose to call this effect _ topological screening _ , in order to emphasize the independence of the particular gauge group . having solved the low - dimensional theory of the isolated qh liquid , we proceed to analyze the quasi - particle transport at qpcs and the electron transport at the holes . we use the master approximation to model both processes as rare transitions that have the numbers , @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 , of electrons at the inner and outer edge of the corbino surface and the number , @ xmath27 , of quasi - particles at the inner edge , where @ xmath28 . the performance of the mz interferometer over a long time interval is described by the master approximation for the ability to find the system in the state corresponding to the number of @ xmath29 . in order to model ohmic contacts , we consider the phenomenon of strong electron tunneling . as a result , the electron distribution in the electronic sector is the product of two equilibrium states produced by the ohmic contacts ( [ h - h ] ) . then we assumetake the quantum numbers @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 and obtain the master equation , where ( [ master - sum - qp ] ) and ( [ master - sum ] ) , for the density functions of the quasi - particle sector represented by @ xmath27 . finally , solving this master equation , we find the current through the mz channel as a function of the magnetic flux , thereby solving the _ _ ##frame _ of our paper . finally , we find that the current oscillates as a function of the local magnetic field with the electronic period @ xmath0 , and these effects are not correlated with temperature and particle size . this implies that they can be interpreted as a quantum mechanical effect . in contrast , as a function of the magnetic flux modulation due to a gate , the current decreases with the quasi - particle period @ xmath2 , and these effects occur in the classical case . thus , the byers - yang paradox is resolved . an important part of our analysis is to predict the screening of the magnetic flux through the holes in the corbino disk by the qh liquid . since this effect has a classical character , i. . . , does not depend on the nature of the current inside the hole and the sample geometry , our prediction only holds for a homogeneous magnetic field . thus , the effect of topological screening can be observed , in detail , in an experiment with an mz interferometer by measuring the area of the hole with a modulation gate but not the area of the qh liquid inside the interferometer , as shown in fig . [ exper1 ] . we predict that , after the application of a gate voltage , the periodicity of the current as a function of the homogeneous magnetic field will not change , contrary to a reasonable assumption that the current depends on the total area of the hole . this is because the current through the hole is uniform and the current phase is proportional to the area of the 2deg covered by the interferometer paths . the last observation leads also to another important prediction : for a strongly disordered sample stuck in a qh liquid , the topological screening leads to a linear dependence of the ab ##f ( measured in units ##² , as a function of the homogeneous magnetic field ) on the filling factor . this is because by changing the filling factor we also change the area of the qh liquid inside the hole , even ifthe shortest paths are infinite . we stress that our predictions also apply to a qh system at the @ xmath30 scale , where the calculations can be done more quickly ( see also the section in sec . [ conseq ] ) . our work is summarized as follows . in sec . [ s - wave - func ] we consider the steady state density function of an mz system in the effective qh system regime and consider the presence of a singular magnetic flux and of a modulation gate . in sec . [ s - effective ] , by extending the effective hamiltonian and extending it onto the subspace of dimensions corresponding to the internal volumes of the qh system , we derive the low - energy description of the mz system . then , in sec . [ s - effective ] , we compare the description derived from our microscopic theory with the one provided by the effective chern - simons theory . in sec . [ s - project - of - eq ] we extend the low - energy effective hamiltonian in order to find the density function of the mz system strongly coupled to ohmic reservoirs and to find the induced current in the presence of a singular magnetic flux and of a modulation gate .we then discuss physical aspects of topological theory and the simple methods to test our predictions in ref . [ conseq ] . finally , in ref [ app - comm ] , we discuss the mathematical relations for the quasi - particle operators and for spin operators , which are important aspects of our theory . in this section we construct the quasi - particle wave functions of the ground state and of gapless excited states of the mz system . we do this step by step , starting from the laughlin wave function and manipulating it , in order to arrive at a mathematical model of the interferometer . we then obtain the most accurate predictions and we publish them , in ref . [ app - incompr ] , using the classical plasma model . @ xcite the variational wave function , proposed by laughlin in ref . [ ] and later modified by haldane and rezayi in ref . [ ] , describes the approximate ground state , @ xmath31 , of the qh state with @ xmath24 electrons and filling ##s @ xmath3 : @ xmath32 here @ xmath33 denotes a sequence of real numbers @ xmath34 describing the spin of the @ xmath35 electron , @ x##math36 , and @ xmath37 is the sample length . it is from @ xcite that the wave function ( [ laugh ] ) describes a circular orbit of a qh state of constant density @ xmath38 and of radius @ xmath39 . in the next step , we add to the function ( [ laugh ] ) the quantum number , @ xmath21 , of laughlin quasi - electrons @ xcite at the points @ xmath40 : @ xmath41 . etc . [ s - incompr ] we also show that the wave function ( [ s - laugh ] ) describes a qh state of constant electron density @ xmath42 inside the corbino disk , as shown in figure . the inner hole of the disk is located at @ xmath40 and has a radius @ xmath43 , and the outer hole of the disk is represented by @ xmath44 . we show that the spherical geometry we assume is not invariant under rotation around the axis of the origin relative to the complex plane , for @ xmath45 . we deliberately break the rotational symmetry in order to avoid the effects of rotation and to come close to a realistic representation of an interferometer (see fig . [ frol - simpl ] , ( 2 ) . the various incompressible deformations of the qh liquid disk may be summarized as follows . we show that all motions of the lower landau level can be represented by holomorphic functions of polar coordinates . we first look for a wave function of the form @ xcite @ xmath46 \ langle \ underbar { omega } \ , | n , [ \ rangle , \ label { wave - 1 } \ ] ] where the [ @ xmath47 \ label { omega } \ ] ] is defined on the corbino disk ( shown in fig . [ mz ] ) , and @ xmath48 denotes a set of points @ xmath22 , @ xmath49 . in fig . [ s - incompr ] we show that the structure of the liquid disk is given by the solution of a two - dimensional electrostatic problem , with @ xmath50 playing the role of the electric field . we utilize the wave function ( [ wave - 1 ] ) in two ways . first of all , the wave motions are known to be the gapless properties of the qh disk . @ x##cite first , in order to describe the low - temperature deformation , we will use the wave function ( [ 0 - 1 ] ) to map the local hamiltonian of the mz ##g onto the subspace corresponding to the deformations . second , we investigate the effect of a gate located on one of the arms of the interferometer . if a vector potential is applied to such a gate , the 2deg becomes invariant again . \ left . [ z - incompr ] we see that the following transformation of wave function @ xmath51 \ langle \ underbar { z } \ , | n , [ \ rangle , \ label { w - modg } \ ] ] with @ xmath52 , describes the local deformation of a corbino disk between the point @ xmath53 , @ xmath54 and the outer edge . this deformation is parameterized by the total magnetic flux @ xmath8 through the inner edge and the phase , @ xmath53 , of the gate . then , after the initial injection of the total magnetic flux @ xmath8 into the hole in the corbino disk near the point @ xmath40 , the wave function is modified by the phasefactor @ xmath55 $ ] . at the same time , the wave function is replaced by the spectral function in order to preserve its single - valuedness . this effect is described by the spectral function @ xmath56 . the net effect of a singular ##ity on the wave function can also be obtained by replacing the original wave function by @ xmath57 it is important to note that the energy ( [ w - magn ] ) is single - valued , and it is the inverse plasma of the initial state ( [ w - ring ] ) . the inverse plasma method @ xcite has proven to be an efficient tool for the analysis of qh states . @ xcite it relies on the simple fact that the norm of the laughlin wave function can be written as the partition function of an ensemble of @ xmath24 classical particles interacting via the one - dimensional ( 2d ) chemical potential . in the non - @ xmath24 limit the computation of the partition function reduces to solving a two - dimensional optimization problem . here we apply this method directly to the wave function ( [ wave - 1 ] ) . we have @ xmath58 where the initial state of the system is @xmath4 and the potential is given by the equation : @ xmath59 \ label { energy } \ label { gathered } \ ] ] using the microscopic energy term @ xmath60 , we can also write @ xmath61 where @ xmath62 and normal ##ization are included in the second term on the right hand side of eq . ( [ ener ] ) in order to represent the self - conservation term . this representation makes it clear , that the partition function ( [ z1 ] ) describes a gas of charged particles interacting via the external coulomb force that is confined by the external potential @ xmath63 . the first term in fig . ( [ extphi ] ) describes the gas with a neutralizing or negative charge of density @ xmath64 . the second term can be viewed as representing a repulsion from the macroscopic charge @ xmath65 at the surface @ xmath40 . finally , the last term describes the effect of the external ( chargeless , since @ xmath66 ) potential on the particles in the gas . the next step is to replace the term over time in fig . ( [ z1 ] ) with the functional equation @ xcitein the region @ xmath67 : @ xmath68 } . \ label { z2 } \ ] ] after this approximation , which cannot be done in the large - @ xmath24 case , @ xcite the solution is simple . we find that the density of the plasma is a quadratic function of the temperature . thus the average density @ xmath69 is given by the solution of the two - dimensional equation @ xmath70 , which is @ xmath71 . consequences of this simple solution are the following results . first , it implies that the action potential is in the region where @ xmath72 , i . e . where the 2deg is not completely filled . in other words , the resulting plasma is a ` ` transparent plasma ' ' that completely screens the background charge @ xmath73 . applying the laplacian to ( [ eom - 1 ] ) , we find that @ xmath74 , i . e . , the coulomb plasma is distributed homogeneously to minimize the background charge . this confirms that the wave equation ( [ em - 1 ] ) describes the free motion of the qh particles . in particular ,the wave function ( [ em - 1 ] ) represents the initial ground state of an mz plasma , shown in fig . 1 , the second model suggests that the plasma in the corbino shell is formed only at the point @ xmath40 , where the macroscopic charge @ xmath65 is zero . this serves to model this hole , so that the total charge is in the region occupied by the 2deg . because of this assumption , the shape of the plasma shell is , therefore , independent of the position of the hole and of the symmetry of the conditions in the total charge region ( the first solution of fig . ( [ extphi ] ) ) . we then investigate the shape of the point @ xmath50 perturbatively . let us denote by @ xmath75 the point to which the qh field is applied . we write for the solution of fig . ( [ eom - 1 ] ) in the point @ xmath76 , for @ xmath77 , and @ xmath78 respectively . then we can rewrite fig . ( [ eom - 2 ] ) as @ xmath79 with a small correction , @ xmath80, and taking into account that the potential for the undeformed corbino disk , @ xmath81 , includes the first two points in fig . ( [ extphi ] ) , we arrive at the solution : @ xmath82 in polar coordinates ( see fig . [ def ] ) , the boundary of the deformed disk can be parameterized by @ xmath83 , where @ xmath84 , and @ xmath85 are the 1d energy densities generated at the inner and outer edge due to the interaction . because of perfect symmetry in the two - dimensional elastic model , one can solve equation . ( [ eom - 2 ] ) separately for each point . using the taylor expansion @ xmath86 , for @ xmath87 , and the integral expression ( [ omega ] ) for the potential @ xmath50 , we solve equation ( [ eom - 2 ] ) by power law . the solution can be presented in the form of a series : [ sol - def ] @ xmath88 these series show how the elastic wave function ( [ sol - def ] ) determines the boundaries of the entire corbino disk . thus ,we consider the case of a modulation gate and of a singular magnetic flux , as illustrated in fig . [ 2 ] . according to the equation ( [ sol - def ] ) , the process described by the transfer function ( [ sol - modg ] ) has the following form : @ xmath89 where @ xmath90 is the argument of the term , @ xmath53 , of the modulation gate . this equation also describes the properties of the modulation gate : the total depletion of the 2deg at the point @ xmath91 and the homogeneous expansion of the qh ##q due to its expansion . it is necessary to assume that the energy of the depleted region under the modulation gate , @ xmath92 , is exactly equal to @ xmath8 . in the presence of a singular magnetic flux , the plasma energy has an additional term @ xmath93 in the language of the coulomb plasma that describes the addition of the term @ xmath94 in the direction of the interferometer at the point @ xmath40 . this term increases the energy of the corbino plasma by an amount @ xmath95 , @ xmath84 , @see in ref . [ mod ] . having defined the set of operators ( [ 0 - 1 ] ) for incompressible states of the qh liquid , we proceed to define operators on the space of such high - energy states when compared to the undeformed steady - state and finding their equivalence relations . first of all , let us introduce single - particle operators . the number of electrons @ xmath24 and quasi - particles @ xmath21 in the state @ xmath96 [ zeromodedef ] operators with different numbers of electrons @ xmath24 are obviously positive , while the number of wave functions with different numbers of quasi - particles @ xmath21 are obviously suppressed in the non - @ xmath24 state . @ xcite taking this fact into account , one derives from the definitions ( [ zeromodedef ] ) the following equivalence relations for the set of zero operators @ xcite @ xmath97 = e ^ { i \ phi } , \ ; \ ; [ n , e ^ { i \ phi _ n } ] = e ^ { i \ phi _ n } . \ label { zeromodecom } \ ] ] next , we have# ##s @ xmath98 , @ xmath84 , for any @ xmath99 , acting from the left : [ def ] [ defa ] @ xmath100 the states ( [ wave - 1 ] ) are the states under the action of these operators . in order to obtain the relations for these operators , we need to consider the components of the states ( [ wave - 2 ] ) . we start with the definition of the wave function , which is given by the square root of the wave function of the coulomb operators , ( [ z1 ] ) and ( [ z2 ] ) , and then the ` ` free energy ' ' @ xmath101 with the potential @ xmath50 as a perturbation , we obtain @ xmath102 where the term @ xmath103 is the distance from the initial state and from the determinant of the path integral . we compute this integral with the help of the operator ( [ wave - def ] ) and write the result in the matrix form in the form @ xmath22 , @ xmath104 \ \ - \ int _ { 1 \ geq }' > 0 } , ' t _ k ^ { k ' } [ t _ 0 ^ { { - k ' } t _ k _ { - k ' } + { \ rm c . t . } ] , \ label { k - space } \ end { n } \ ] ] where @ xmath105 are the coefficients . the holomorphic nature of this functional equation allows us to extend the expression for the norm @ xmath106 to the corresponding norm @ xmath107 . similarly , we express the operators , via their identity elements , as follows : @ xmath108 . a similar expression above yields : @ xmath109 \ langle n , m , \ underbar { t } \ , | n , m , \ underbar { t } \ , ' \ rangle . \ label { interm } \ end { n } \ ] ] by definition ( [ defa ] ) , we may write @ xmath110 . expressing this expression in ( [ interm ] ) we may write the adjoint operator acting on the norm @ xmath111 , via the norm @ xmath22 , and @ xmat##h112 repeating exactly the same procedure for the operators @ xmath113 , we obtain : @ xmath114 the expressions ( [ ak ] ) , ( [ ak - ku ] ) and ( [ ak - kd ] ) for the operators @ xmath98 and their adjoints and the operators @ xmath115 = \ delta _ { kk ' } $ ] , we obtain the following relation : @ xmath116 = \ frac { 1 } { k } \ delta _ { kk ' } \ delta _ { k ' } . \ dot { commut - mic } \ ] ] finally , one finds that @ xmath117 = [ a _ { ks } , a _ { k ' ' ' } ] = 0 $ ] . thus the operators ##s , @ xmath98 and @ xmath118 , contained in ( [ k ] ) have canonical equivalence ##s , and the theory of these operators has a canonical fock - structure with respect to these operators . starting from the above formula , we then can calculate the one - dimensional energy spectrum of the electron . for this reason , we canthe microscopic hamiltonian and projection operators of n - particles are the two edges onto the low - energy subspace constructed above . the norm of these operators is defined as @ xmath119 , where the density matrix @ xmath120 is defined as : @ xmath121 where the norm @ xmath122 , in the large @ xmath24 electrons , is given by the norm ( [ z2 ] ) . we can implement the projection method in the presence of an external magnetic field . in fig . [ n - particle ] we then consider cases where a magnetic flux gate is inserted and a high field voltage is applied . the microscopic hamiltonian for @ xmath24 electrons , restricted to the lowest landau level , is given by the norm @ xmath123 where @ xmath124 is the potential of the electron - electron interaction and @ xmath125 is the confining potential , which forces electrons to form the interferometer . note that we have neglected the low energy operator , since , depending on the lowest landau level , it has a small norm , @ xmath126 , where @ xmath127 is the resonance potential . the projectionof the microscopic hamiltonian onto the space of small elements @ xmath128 is given by @ xmath129 where @ xmath130 , and the total energy operator is @ xmath131 we may write the ##ized ##es @ xmath132 in ( [ edge - ring ] ) . they can be expressed in terms of the electronic states of the transition region as follows : @ xmath133 for the non - @ xmath24 limit and for the short - range weak interaction we write this function , @ xmath134 , with the ` ` exchange ' ' term . next , we may rewrite the dynamics of the system in terms of the energy density as @ xmath135 next , we have to write the microscopic hamiltonian ( [ w - matr ] ) in terms of the energy operator ( [ ak ] ) . to this end , we consider the elements of the ring ( [ w - ring ] ) and take into account the fact that the density is constant , @ xmath76 , for @ xmath77 . for the deformed region as @ xmath136 , we cantake the term ( [ edge - spec - t ] ) from the small deformation @ xmath137 and calculate the correction term with the inverse of the matrix ( [ sol - def ] ) : @ xmath138 . \ label { edge - spect } \ end { f } \ ] ] where @ xmath139 is the potential of a qh field applied to an undeformed corbino surface , and the last two terms come from the deformation @ xmath137 . the excitation terms , @ xmath140 , @ xmath84 , are generated by the two - body interaction and by the small interaction : @ xmath141 . \ label { spectr } \ ] ] using only the holomorphic form of the bilinear form ( [ edge - spect ] ) to extend this expression to off - diagonal matrix elements , we arrive at the full hamiltonian ( [ sol - matr ] ) in the following form : @ xmath142 we can see that the term @ xmath143 describes the interaction occurring at a point @ xmath144 . in the low - energy limit , i . e ., for @ xmath145 , the transition velocity in ( [ spectr ] ) is approximately defined as a function of the mode number : @ xmath146 , where the constants @ xmath147 are the relative velocities of edge excitations . the energy of the undeformed edge takes the following form as a function of the number of electrons @ xmath24 and the number of anti - electrons @ xmath21 : @ xmath148 combining the mode number with the wave function @ xmath149 , we arrive at the following expression for the edge hamiltonian @ xmath150 we end this section with the following : remark . equation ( [ spectr ] ) has two terms : the first term is the transition velocity , proportional to the boundary velocity field , @ xmath151 , while the second term is proportional to the ` ` natural frequency ' ' @ xmath152 the energy level in ( [ velo ] ) is given by two terms of the @ xmath153 - expansion of the zero - point - wave function . in particular , equation ( [ velo ] ) starts with an expression proposedsee in article . [ ] is the basis of the above vertex picture . the edge hamiltonian for an mz ##r can be written as a sum of the operators on the left and right qpc : @ xmath154 . \ nonumber \ ] ] the tunnel operator is an operator annihilating a quasi - particle at a point @ xmath155 on one edge and recreating it at a point @ xmath20 on the other edge : @ xmath156 where @ xmath157 and @ xmath158 are quasi - particle states . as for the edge hamiltonian , the projection of the tunnel operator , @ xmath159 , is given in terms of matrix elements in the states @ xmath160 . these matrix elements can be obtained by inserting a finite set of the states : @ xmath161 in other words , we define the tunneling operator as an operator whose matrix elements are overlaps of wave functions with quasi - particles located on the inner and the outer edge . the wave functions with insertion of a quasi - particle , @ xmath162 are given by the condition that the annihilation of@ xmath4 quasi - particles at the same point are equivalent to the annihilation of an electron . the scattering amplitude is defined by @ xmath163 , which leads to the result : @ xmath164 where we have a small error , because it can be integrated into the scattering amplitude . the quasi - particle at the point @ xmath20 is therefore defined by the following wave function : @ xmath165 = ( [ qp - def ] ) differs from laughlin s quasi - particle definition only by a small factor . we show in appendix [ app - comm ] that the quasi - particle definition , obtained by the projection of @ xmath166 defined by ( [ qp - def ] ) onto the high - energy spectrum , has all the above properties ( mass , energy and momentum ) . in order to obtain the matrix product ( [ app - matr ] ) , we first assume that @ xmath167 , as in the previous section , and then apply our findings . the expression @ xmath168 in fig . ( [ qp - def ] ) can be rewritten [ @ xmath169 $ ] . ., dividing the edges into a series on the outer edge , @ xmath170 , and on the inner edge , @ xmath171 , we arrive at the following formula for the boundary of ( [ - - matr ] ) : @ xmath172 \ \ \ left \ int \ xi _ i ^ 2z _ k ( z ^ * _ i - z ^ * _ 0 ) \ exp \ left \ { - \ sum _ { k > 0 } \ left [ \ frac { z _ i ^ k } { { \ xi ^ k } + \ frac { ( \ xi ^ * - z ^ * _ 0 ) ^ k } { [ ( z ^ * _ i - z ^ * _ 0 ) ^ k } \ right ] \ right \ } \ langle n , m , \ underbar { t } \ , | \ underbar { t } \ , \ rangle \ langle \ underbar { z } \ , | n , m ' , \ underbar { t } \ , \ rangle . \ , { hren } \ , { t } \ ] ] . we have assumed for simplicity that the edges are orthogonal to each other andwe set @ xmath173 . taking into account that @ xmath174 and @ xmath175 , we take out of the above the following result : @ xmath176 . then we use the result that @ xmath177 to solve the equation ( [ hren ] ) in the following way : @ xmath178 \ \ \ , \ exp \ , \ { - \ xi _ { k > 0 } \ , [ \ frac { 1 } { - \ xi ^ * } \ frac { \ partial } { \ partial t _ 0 } + \ frac { ( \ xi ^ * - t _ 0 ^ * ) ^ * } { - } \ frac { \ partial } { \ partial t _ { - k } ^ * } \ right ] \ right \ } \ langle \ , [ + 1 , \ underbar { t } \ , | n , t ' , \ underbar { t } \ , \ rangle . \ end { hren - 1 } \ , { - } \ ] ] we can also show that the original equation ( [ hren - 2 ] ) holds unless @ xmath179 . \ ,using formula ( [ free - en ] ) for the projection of the function @ xmath180 and formula ( [ en ] ) , we can express the projection of the tunneling operator ( [ free - en ] ) in terms of the tunnel operator as follows : @ xmath181 , \ [ { h - f } \ ] ] where all the # ##s operators are combined into a prefactor @ xmath182 , and we have used the following notations : [ bsefield ] @ xmath183 , \ ] ] @ xmath184 . \ ] ] to complete our calculation of the high - energy state of the material we must calculate the projection of the operators of electron tunneling from the quantum metal surface to the quantum contacts . this can be done by applying the formula given here to the electron tunnel operator ( [ el - def ] ) . the result of the calculation is given by @ xmath185 \ \ \ big \ exp \ { [ i \ xi _ u + mn \ ln \ xi _ 0 + mn \ ln ( \ xi _ 0 - i _ 0 ) \ } ] \ label { elec -u } \ end { u } \ ] ] for distances from the outer edge to the inner edge . ( see cf . [ mz ] for notations ) , and the net force on the inner edge is given by @ xmath186 \ \ \ , \ exp \ , [ i \ theta _ n + im \ , + i \ ln ( \ theta _ 0 - i _ 1 ) \ , ] , \ label { elec - d } \ end { u } \ ] ] to conclude this , we note that we can obtain the same probability density function on the edges of a qh system , @ xmath187 and @ xmath188 , by rewriting the expression ( [ sol - def ] ) directly in terms of the expression ( [ sol ] ) : @ xmath189 [ rho - edge - mic ] . the homogeneous effects are the energy accumulation caused by the variation of the operators @ xmath21 and @ xmath24 . the ( [ rho - edge - mic ] ) lead to the following additional relations @ xmath190 = \ pm \ frac { 1 } { x _ 0 } \ , ( \ theta -\ le _ ( ) { \ cal a } ( \ le ) , \ ] ] where the angles @ xmath191 and @ xmath192 parametrize the position of the gate operator in terms of the inner and outer angles . these two equations show that the tunneling operator ( [ h - tunnel ] ) creates a series of point - like waves of magnitude @ xmath193 . finally , we also show that the operators ( [ elec - edge ] ) and ( [ elec - mic ] ) have a positive value at the boundary edge . let ( [ h - tunnel ] - [ h - edge - mic ] ) describe the gate operator ( see also appendix [ app - comm ] ) . the quantum low - energy theory agrees well with the classical theory of physics . [ ] and [ ] . having found a self - consistent procedure for the projection of observables onto low - energy states , we first consider the projection of the quantum hamiltonian and of the gate operator onto the situation where the magnetic flux is threading through the boundary . next , we consider the case where the flux is determined by means of the modulation gate operator . the wave function of the interfer##ometer . this state is given by q . ( [ w - modg ] ) , and the probability density in this state is given by q . ( [ res - 1 ] ) . according to q . ( [ res - 1 ] ) , we define operators of the initial state ( [ w - modg ] ) as follows : @ xmath194 \ langle \ underbar { z } \ , | \ , [ \ rangle , \ label { w - def - g } \ end { z } \ ] ] where @ xmath52 is the smallest edge of the corbino disk near the point @ xmath53 , @ xmath54 is the largest edge . the scalar products of these operators can be deduced from q . ( [ free - gate ] ) . they are given by the following expression : @ xmath195 , \ label { free - gate } \ , { gathered } \ ] ] where @ xmath196 , for @ xmath99 , and @ xmath197 , for @ xmath198 . from the expression ( [ free - gate ] ) , one knows that the set of these operators ( [ com##mut - mic ] ) does not change after the application of a gate voltage . first , we find that the energy level of the state ( [ w - def - mic ] ) agrees with the state ( [ w - def ] ) , but with @ xmath22 replaced by @ xmath199 . this does not change the energy of the edges , which is also consistent with the shift @ xmath22 . therefore , the net effect of the electric field on the edge hamiltonian , due to two factors , is given by : @ xmath200 we can also find the value of the tunneling operators by applying the shift @ xmath201 to state ( [ tun - gate ] ) , which is @ xmath202 \ \ \ , \ exp \ big [ - i \ phi + i \ ln \ phi + i \ varphi _ d ( \ xi ) - i \ varphi ^ \ xi _ d ( \ xi ^ * - z ^ * _ 0 ) \ big ] . \ label { tun - gate } \ dot { gathered } \ ] ] finally , we find that , after the application of a gate voltage , the tunneling operators @ xmath##203 at the left qpc and @ xmath204 at the right qpc have a [ flux @ xmath205 $ ] corresponding to the flux @ xmath8 in the region of 2deg depleted by the quantum dot . using the general form of the function @ xmath206 , we arrive at the following result : @ xmath207 where @ xmath208 is the length of the long axis of the interferometer ( see sec . [ e - gate ] ) . we will show in sec . [ s - gate ] that only the dependent part @ xmath209 of this phase enters tunneling mode , while the time - dependent part fades out with the s - gate phase . the case where the phase is changed via the insertion of a singular flux tube is described by the wave function ( [ s - magn ] ) . in sec . [ s - incompr ] we have shown that the insertion of a singular flux is equivalent to the insertion of a point - like wave ( in the electromagnetic language ) and that it leads to a homogeneous distribution of the edges . similarly , we obtain the singular flux hamiltonian by replacing @ xmath21 with @ xmath21##0 ( to take into account the shift of the edges ) , which yields @ xmath211 the wave functions of the two tunnels in the presence of a singular flux @ xmath8 differ from ( [ h - tunnel ] ) only by the expression @ xmath212 . thus the tunnel ##ing can be found with the help of the same calculations as in sec . [ s - effective ] , which yields an expression that differs from eq . ( [ s - tunnel ] ) only by a real prefactor : @ xmath213 \ label { h - tun - 1 } \ label { h } \ ] ] we show that , in contrast to the situation where a singular operator is introduced , the tunneling operators in the qpcs do not acquire their own phases due to the singular flux . this is seen as an induced combination of the phase shift caused by the flux itself and the phase shift caused by the shift of the edges . in sec . [ s - effective ] , we show that this fact is universal , i . e . , it does not depend on the specific wave function ( [ h - 1 ] ) of the interferometer . in this way we show that the low - energy effective theory, derived , in the last step , from the fundamental wave equation ( [ wave - 1 ] ) , can be constructed in a universal gauge - invariant way . in order to do so , we start from the topological chern - simon field @ xcite to the bulk of the qh liquid and construct a boundary condition such that the total action is local and gauge invariant . then we show that the gauge - invariant edge hamiltonian corresponds with the one derived from quantum mechanics , see cf . ( [ h - tunnel ] ) , and the operators coincide with those derived in cf . ( [ h - tunnel ] ) . finally , we show that the effect of the wave function on the singular flux is a gauge - invariant effect , caused by topological displacement of a singular flux by the chern - simons field . we start by recalling the construction of the effective potential - energy theory of an infinitely large qh liquid with density , @ xmath3 . such a system is characterized by a net current , @ xmath214 . the wave equation , @ xmath215 , is given by the equations @ xmath216 , @ xmath217 , and below , we define , where @xmath218 , and adopt the usual notation convention , unless specified otherwise . the current is invariant under the gauge transformation @ xmath219 . by counting dimensions , it is easy to see that the gauge invariant solution for the current @ xmath220 given by @ xmath221 = \ frac { 1 } { 2 \ pi } \ int d ^ 3r \ epsilon ^ { \ mu \ nu \ lambda } a _ \ mu \ epsilon _ \ nu b _ \ lambda \ label { mass - mass } \ ] ] has zero dimension , and all gauge invariant solutions have _ lower _ dimensions , i . e . , have _ lower _ for high energy and low energy scales . for example , the bose - einstein term has dimension @ xmath222 . similarly , the interaction with an external electric field , described by a magnetic field @ xmath223 , is described by the equation : @ xmath224 = \ int d ^ 3r a _ \ nu b ^ \ mu = \ frac { 1 } { 2 \ lambda } \ int d ^ 3r a _ \ mu \ epsilon ^ { \ nu \ nu \ lambda } \ partial _ \ lambda b _ { \lambda } . \ nonumber \ int { gathered } \ ] ] . over the current @ xmath225 , we arrive at an effective action for the magnetic field using the chern - doherty equation : @ xmath226 = \ frac { 1 } { 4 \ pi m } \ int d ^ 3r \ epsilon ^ { \ mu \ nu \ lambda } a _ \ lambda \ lambda _ \ delta a _ \ lambda . \ nonumber \ ] ] the average current @ xmath227 / \ delta a _ \ lambda $ ] is then by darcy ' s law : @ xmath228 where @ xmath229 is the electrical potential . thus , we find that , for an infinitely extended liquid , the term ( [ x - action ] ) exactly describes the qh effect , @ xmath3 . similarly , in the situation where the qh effect is confined to a small area @ xmath75 , the effective action for the qh is in the presence of an external magnetic field , @ xmath230 = \ frac { 1 } { 4 \ pi m } \ int _ { d } d ^ 3r \ epsilon ^ { \ mu \ nu \lambda } \ big [ 2a _ \ lambda + 3 _ \ lambda \ big ] \ partial _ \ nu b _ \ lambda , \ big { s - bulk } \ ] ] under a gauge transformation . @ xcite ##s , one also sees that , under a gauge transformation @ xmath231 , @ xmath232 , the product ( [ s - bulk ] ) reduces to @ xmath233 \ to s [ a , b ] + \ to s [ a , b ] $ ] with : @ xmath234 = \ frac { 1 } { 4 \ pi } \ int _ { d } d ^ 3r \ epsilon ^ { \ mu \ nu \ lambda } \ left [ 2 \ partial _ \ lambda \ alpha + m \ partial _ \ mu \ nu \ lambda ] \ partial _ \ nu b _ \ lambda \ \ = \ frac { 1 } { 4 \ pi } \ int _ { \ lambda d } d ^ 2r [ 2 \ alpha + m \ lambda ] \ epsilon ^ { \ mu \ nu } \ partial _ \ nu b _ \ lambda \ end { anomal } \ end { null } \ ] ] where @ xmath235 is thetransform of the bulk field @ xmath220 to the field @ xmath236 . a possible explanation for the gauge anomaly is the fact that in a qh field confined to a small volume the local electric charge ( [ j - h ] ) is not conserved . consequently , the electric charge may accumulate at the surface of the liquid . in order to restore the gauge symmetry of the bulk field , we take into account the local degrees of freedom . it is easy to see that the bulk field @ xmath237 = \ frac { 1 } { 2 \ pi } \ int _ { \ , \ } d ^ 2r [ d _ t \ , d _ x \ , - h ( d _ x \ nu ) + \ epsilon ^ { \ nu \ phi } a _ \ mu \ a _ \ nu \ phi ] , \ label { x - edge1 } \ dot { gathered } \ ] ] which is similar to the action potential in gravity . [ ] from a study of the hydrodynamics of a pure liquid , consider the gauge anomaly ( [ anomal ] ) , where one assumes that the bulk field @ xmath238 transforms to @ xmath239 andthe second form is given by the equation @ xmath240 note that the commutation relations for the field @ xmath241 are determined by the first derivative of the total action ( [ edge - edge1 ] ) : @ xmath242 = \ frac { { \ { i } { m } \ left ( x - y ) . \ left { commut - eff } \ ] ] however , the second form of the boundary hamiltonian field @ xmath243 is not determined by the boundary theory . the only requirement is that the hamiltonian density should be a positive real multiple of @ xmath244 . the simplest possible expression @ xmath245 , justified in the absence of large scale deformations , leads to the chiral boundary theory with a linear conservation law . similarly , the expression for the charge distribution on the boundary of a qh domain may be found by evaluating the derivative @ xmath246 of the total action with respect to the boundary theory . the expression reads : @ xmath247 note that , after working with the fields @ xmath216 , the action described above leads , for a given topology , to the effective theory thathas been discussed in detail . having found a gauge invariant low - spin state for an incompressible qh field , we proceed to analyze the spectrum of local modes . the type ( [ op - bulk ] ) arises in the context of a topological field theory , where excitations are described by wilson lines . @ xcite for example , the general local excitation at the point @ xmath248 can be written as : @ xmath249 where @ xmath250 is a constant . the statistical phase of local modes of the type ( [ op - bulk ] ) is obtained by braiding the two wilson lines . @ xcite considering two states described by @ xmath251 and @ xmath252 , one arrives , by a simple calculation of energy , at the following expression for the statistical phase : @ xmath253 . similarly , if one takes the charge density as an integral over a space - like region @ xmath254 , then the type of the excitation ( [ op - bulk ] ) is given by @ xmath255 . the corresponding expressions for the statistical phase and the charge show that the type ( [ op- bulk ] ) with @ xmath256 having the quantum numbers of an electron , while for @ xmath257 and ( [ op - bulk ] ) this operator has the quantum numbers of a laughlin quasi - particle . the operator that combines a laughlin quasi - particle at the point @ xmath20 and a laughlin quasi - particle at the point @ xmath155 takes the form of a wilson line at these points : @ xmath258 note , however , that this operator is not gauge invariant . according to the standard theory of gauge theory , eq . ( [ gaugetransform ] ) , the _ gauge - invariant _ operator of tunneling between two critical points , described by the fields @ xmath259 and @ xmath260 \ , @ xcite can be written ( @ xmath261 \ , ) e ^ { - i \ phi _ d ( t ) } , \ phi { tun - ef } \ ] ] where the 1d and 2d coordinates are given via the fields @ xmath262 for the outer edge and @ xmath263 for the inner edge of the mz boundary ; ( see fig . [ 2- edge ] ) . the tunnel operator ( [ tun - ef ] ) is a vector of electric fields of the form @ xmath264 at the edges , which can be calculated by means of the product of this operator with the edge tunnel operator ( [ h - edge ] ) with the result of q . ( [ commut - edge ] ) . to compare the tunnel operator ( [ tun - ef ] ) with the previous one , q . ( [ h - edge ] ) , we first note that , if the transmission line is short , we can use @ xmath265 and neglect the transmission line corresponding to q . ( [ tun - ef ] ) . next , we define a # ##ized ##e for the current densities @ xmath266 , @ xmath84 : [ k - a ] @ xmath267 , \ \ \ ! \ ! \ ! \ \ pi \ rho _ k ( u ) = \ frac { k + 1 } { mr _ u } + \ pi _ { k > 1 } \ sqrt { \ frac { k } { mr _ u } } [ k _ { ku } .^ { ikx } + { \ rm h . e . } \ , ] , \ label { mic } \ ] ] where the sum is over the transfer function @ xmath268 . then the fields @ xmath98 and @ xmath269 satisfy the following linear relation ( [ commut - mic ] ) . this means that the linear relation ( [ commut - mic ] ) is satisfied , when zero modes are taken into account . finally , the edge hamiltonian @ xmath270 , \ label { h - edge - rho } \ ] ] , in terms of the operators @ xmath98 and @ xmath269 , agrees with the above edge hamiltonian ( [ h - edge ] ) . therefore , in this paper and also in this paper , the fields @ xmath271 naturally have zero - mode components . @ xcite in order to calculate these , we need to consider the homogeneous distribution of the field @ xmath216 at the origin for a field with given number of zero modes @ xmath21 and @ xmath24 . this equation describes the homogeneous distribution of the qh field at the originand it satisfies the law @ xmath272 . similarly , for a disk geometry , one takes the background charge from the chern - ##vier field and finds @ xmath273 . however , in the special case of a corbino disk geometry , the number @ xmath274 varies , depending on the numbers @ xmath21 and @ xmath24 . we obtain the solution by taking into account the change of the background charge @ xmath42 caused by the variation of the two numbers @ xmath21 and @ xmath24 . to this end , we find that the number @ xmath275 can be viewed as a ` ` vector field ' ' that satisfies the law with the background charge at @ xmath42 . the change of the number @ xmath21 leads to a change of the edges of the corbino disk , and to the appearance of the background charge @ xmath276 in the form of two homogeneous fields . solving the 2d electrostatic equation we find that @ xmath277 on the inner edge and @ xmath278 \ { { non - zero } \ ] ] on the outer edge . we find theo ( [ b - tunnel ] ) , the # ##ized ##o ( [ rho - a ] ) , and the relation ( [ b - a ] ) relate the edge currents and edge fields to arrive at the microscopic expression [ b - tunnel ] @ xmath279 / \ sqrt { kr _ u } , \ end { gathered } \ ] ] @ xmath280 / \ sqrt { k _ d } , \ end { gathered } \ ] ] which should be similar to above . ( [ bsefield ] ) . we note that the tunneling amplitude ( [ b - ef ] ) , in the case of an outer edge current @ xmath223 , agrees with the microscopic expression ( [ b - tunnel ] ) if one sets @ xmath265 . it is important to note that the contributions of the currents to the edge fields are not affected by the internal structure of the mz ##r . namely , the phase change of the tunneling amplitude induced by the edge current @ xmath21 is not constant at the outer edge , except @ xmath45 . in this case we note that the effects of a magnetic flux and of a modulation are different at2 . [ s - t ] can be expressed in terms of the time - invariant low - dimensional effective theory . we start from the situation where the modulation gate , is needed in order to reach the outer edge of a mz region . this situation can be expressed at the level of the effective theory by adding a constraint to the hamiltonian , that describes the value of the potential @ xmath281 created by the modulation gate with charge density accumulated at the edge . thus , the energy hamiltonian of the outer edge is given by the expression : @ xmath282 . \ nonumber \ ] ] then we obtain the steady - state expectation value of the charge density by minimizing the hamiltonian with the constraint @ xmath283 . for the case where the gate is depleted at the point @ xmath284 , we write the density as @ xmath285 . the expectation value of the potential is then given by @ xmath286 . \ nonumber \ ] ] the parameter @ xmath287 can be expressed in terms of the flux @ xmath8 in the region depleted by the gate , @ xmath288 , so that the potential for the accumulated fluxis of the form @ xmath289 . \ label { h - gate } \ ] ] finally , we obtain the charge density at the outer edge by adding the vacuum contribution ( [ vac - a ] ) : @ xmath290 . as a consequence , the edge hamiltonian ( [ h - h - rho ] ) has an absolute value : @ xmath291 . \ label { ham - tun - a } \ ] ] substituting into this equation the normal ##ized ##o ( [ tun - a ] ) , we arrive at the state ( [ h - edge ] ) with the vacuum contribution @ xmath139 given by : . ( [ h - gate ] ) , in full agreement with the microscopic model . next , we consider the effect of the modulation gate on the tunneling current ( [ h - ef ] ) . we will show in the next section that , to lowest value of the edge hamiltonian , the vacuum contribution to the state is given by the product of two differential operators acting on the qpcs . therefore , only the relative value of the two operators has a physical meaning . we express this information in terms of the two differential##sities with the solution of fig . ( [ rho - d ] ) : @ xmath292 \ big ) \ \ \ , \ exp \ big ( - 1 \ , ( \ int _ { x _ l } ^ { x _ r } dx [ \ int _ l ( x ) + \ rho _ r ( x ) ] \ } ) . \ end { two - tun } \ end { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath293 is the modulation gate , @ xmath294 , @ xmath295 the position of the qpcs , and the integral of and varies over the lifetime of the gate ( see fig . [ a - b ] ) . then , as shown above , we consider the vacuum energy density ( [ a - d ] ) accumulated due to the interaction with the modulation gate . the sum ( [ two - tun ] ) of the currents also has a phase shift @ xmath296 . using the above formula for @ xmath297 in the situation where the gate is located at the position @ xmath284 of the qpcs , we arrive at the expression ( [ x- phas ] ) . thus , we see that equations based on the gauge - invariant effective action must agree with the physical properties of the gauge operators . it remains to determine the existence of a net magnetic flux . to this end , we minimize the flux ( [ e - edge1 ] ) with respect to the edge only in the presence of an external electromagnetic field . this leads to the following equations of motion : @ xmath298 where @ xmath84 , and @ xmath299 are the component of the electromagnetic field along the axis of the edge . it follows from this equation that , in particular , @ xmath300 , and for @ xmath301 , the electric fields are always equally strong along the edge : @ xmath302 . moreover , taking e . ( [ eom - e ] ) from the equation @ xmath303 and subtracting the equation for the inner edge ( @ xmath304 ) from the equation for the outer edge ( @ xmath305 ) , we arrive at the following equation : @ xmath306 where @ xmath8 is the axis of the edge . if we consider the followings . and the physical properties . finally , we conclude that , after the adiabatic insertion of the singular flux , the quantum state @ xmath21 is shifted by @ xmath307 . this , in turn , leads to an approximate hamiltonian of the system : @ xmath308 ^ { . \ nonumber \ ] ] using only the expression ##ized ##o ( [ phi - a ] ) , we arrive at the hamiltonian ( [ h - edge ] ) , with the vacuum operator @ xmath139 shifted by eq . ( [ e0 ] ) , in agreement with the microscopic model . finally , we can see from the expansion ( [ phi - a ] ) that the vacuum operator ( [ phi - ef ] ) for @ xmath309 does not depend on @ xmath21 . therefore , it does not change after the insertion of the singular flux . this effect can be interpreted as the spontaneous cancellation of the contributions to the phase of the ( [ h - edge ] ) . the first one arises from the time - dependence [ @ xmath310 $ ] of the bulk fields in the field contour @ xmath293 upon insertion of the singular flux . the second oneis equal to the current @ xmath311 $ ] moving through the arms of the loop . physically , this means that the phase shift of the surface excitation in the closed contour @ xmath293 caused directly by the variation of the surface potential @ xmath223 is replaced by the phase shift induced by the surface reconstruction of the qh loop . this idea of _ topological _ relaxation is the reflection , at the effective - theory level , of the fact that with the insertion of the singular ##ity the fundamental wave function ( [ x - magn ] ) undergoes a transformation in order to maintain its real - valuedness . we have shown here that the screening effect , in its original formulation , does not exist in qh interferometers , because the screening effects do not depend on the singular magnetic field in the corbino loop . this , however , does not imply that the current through the interferometer is independent of the flux . in this case we assume that it varies as a function of @ xmath8 with the electronic period @ xmath0 , in agreement with the byers - yang law . these effects arise from the coulomb blockade .and they vanish in the classical limit @ xcite and in the limit of strong coupling to ohmic contacts . in fact , components of the current as a function of the quantum gate voltage come from quantum dots . therefore they do not vanish in the thermodynamic limit . we consider a mz interferometer , strongly coupled to metallic contacts , with weak quasi - particle tunneling between inner and outer edges ( see fig . [ relax ] ) . the strong coupling of electrons to ohmic contacts guarantees that the inner and outer edge currents are in equilibrium with the electron reservoirs , with corresponding electro - chemical potentials @ xmath312 and @ xmath313 . the charge difference at the contacts , arising as a solution to the potential equation @ xmath314 , is due to weak quasi - particle tunneling in the qpcs . it is then necessary to introduce a new term for zero modes . we denote by @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 the numbers of electrons at the outer and inner edge of the interferometer , respectively . the number of quasi - particles present on the inner edge is denoted by @ xmath315 : @ xmath316the electron quantum numbers , @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 , change due to tunneling between the two contacts while the quantum number @ xmath27 changes by @ xmath317 when a quasi - particle tunnels from one edge to the other one , as shown in fig . [ 2 ] . without loss of detail , we take the zero ##es to be classical variables and derive a master equation for the probability distribution functions . this coherence manifests itself in terms of the quasi - particle tunnel ##ing and fluctuations of the electron flux @ xmath8 . these fluctuations result from the interference of the weak quasi - particle tunneling amplitudes in the left and right qpc . however , these oscillations stem from the @ xmath8 - 1 coupling ##s along the spin axis . in this section we obtain the master equation that describes the quasi - particle tunneling , and we find the tunneling rates from the quantum numbers constructed above . the weak coupling to the contacts means that , after every cycle of quasi - particle tunneling , the excited states change to the ground state described by the probability distribution function @ xmath318 where @ xmath319 isthe inverse is , @ xmath320 is the electrochemical potential of the @ xmath321 ohmic contact , and @ xmath322 is the distribution function . the energy @ xmath323 depends on the number @ xmath27 of quasi - particles via the ground - state energy @ xmath324 , given by : . ( [ ener - 1 ] ) . however , one does not need to know the precise mechanism of coupling to the atomic contact , because the main purpose of this coupling is to equilibrate the excited states . @ xcite to the probability for quasi - particle tunneling , the probability distribution function of the modes can be written as @ xmath325 where @ xmath326 is the probability to find the detector in a state with @ xmath27 quasi - particles , and @ xmath323 plays the role of the conditional probability to find the interferometer in a state with @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 particles on the edges , for a given number @ xmath27 of quasi - particles . considering quasi - particle coupling as a linear coupling that gives the energy @ xmath27 , we mayreplace it with the master potential @ xmath327 where @ xmath328 and @ xmath329 are the rates of transition from the state with @ xmath27 quasi - particles to the state with @ xmath330 and @ xmath331 quasi - particles , respectively . these rates are given by the equation : @ xmath332 where @ xmath333 are the rates of quasi - particle transition between two states with fixed number of particles , @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 . at time scales much larger than the characteristic rate of transition , the system enters a steady state state with @ xmath334 . it is easy to see that in this regime the current quantity is independent of @ xmath27 @ xmath335 this quantity is in fact the charge density that we are looking for . this follows from the equation for the potential @ xmath336 and from the corresponding boundary condition , @ xmath337 , which can be verified directly using equations ( [ rho - eq ] ) and ( [ e - q ] ) . note that the detailed description of @ xmath338 is not onlyif @ xmath339 . then , the mz ##r in a non - equilibrium steady - state system represents an interesting example of a system with a positive balance . we set the tunneling rates @ xmath333 to leading order of the tunneling hamiltonian @ xmath340 , where @ xmath341 . a second step , based on the # ##on r , gives the following expression : @ xmath342 and a similar expression for @ xmath343 . here the operator @ xmath344 maps onto lines with real numbers @ xmath345 and @ xmath27 , and the function @ xmath346 is the probability density function for the system . next , we take some further steps , the details of which may be found in refs . [ ] and [ ] . we find the equations of motion for the tunnel rates @ xmath347 , @ xmath295 , and taking the derivative of the operator ( [ h - edge ] ) with the hamiltonian ( [ l - edge ] ) , and combining these equations in order to find the time evolution of @ xmath348 . in thethus , we arrive at the following expression for the tunnel rates taking the form of a function of the finite and infinite part : @ xmath349 , \ end { tun - rates - 2 } \ end { 1 } \ ] ] here @ xmath350 is the energy difference between initial states with @ xmath351 quasi - particles and the intermediate state with @ xmath27 quasi - particles , and the functions @ xmath352 ^ { 1 / m } $ ] , @ xmath353 , are the energy correlation ##s of the oscillator field . we assume that @ xmath354 is the total number of electrons in the corbino disk , and @ xmath14 and @ xmath16 are the energy components of the qpcs . note that the electron flux determines the tunneling rate ( [ tun - rates - 2 ] ) , in particular , via the energy difference @ xmath355 . in the next two sections we substitute e . ( [ e - 1 ] ) and ( [ e0 ] ) for the energy @ xmath139 in order to show the energy dependence of the tunnel ##ing in these cases .in the case where the current through the device is measured with the use of a modulation , we use q . ( [ ham - gate ] ) to evaluate the energy difference between the output and initial state : @ xmath356 in this case , an additional value change occurs corresponding to the two rates @ xmath357 and @ xmath358 in the left and right qpcs , which produces the relative value @ xmath359 represented by q . ( [ tun - phas ] ) , which , for simplicity , we rewrite here : @ xmath360 $ ] . this expression enters the time domain of the two rates ( [ tun - rates - 1 ] ) . next , we find that in the upper limit @ xcite the sum of the two numbers in eq . ( [ tun - rates - 2 ] ) and that the expression for the transfer function @ xmath322 can be also represented by an integral , so that we arrive at the expression @ xmath361 it is convenient to extend the expression to : @ xmath362 and @ xmath363 . a consequence of this expression are the following ones :first of all , the value of the energy is , @ xmath364 , where @ xmath353 . secondly , the phase difference is independent of the number @ xmath27 and of the phase : @ xmath365 . finally , the # ##lation difference @ xmath366 has the topological form , @ xmath367 , because the time - dependent components cancel out with the contribution from the number @ xmath368 to the second part of the integral ( [ tun - rates - 2 ] ) . using the new expressions for @ xmath139 , @ xmath355 , and @ xmath359 , we find that the integral ( [ tun - rates ] ) is gaussian with the saddle point term , in the thermodynamic limit , by @ xmath369 substituting this values into eq . ( [ t - 1 ] ) , we get the following expression for the integral : @ xmath370 , \ label { tun - rates - 3 } \ label { t } \ ] ] with @ xmath354 and the interference term , by @ xmath371 , derived from theand ( [ tun - gate ] ) . thus , we arrive at the following general result : the rates do not depend on @ xmath27 , @ xmath372 . this implies , according to fig . ( [ curr - d ] ) , that the current is proportional to @ xmath373 ) , i . e . , it coincides with the expression for the current obtained in fig . [ ] . we therefore do not evaluate the integral of ( [ tun - rates - 3 ] ) and refer the reader to [ ] , where the integral has been thoroughly analyzed in the linear and non - linear forms . first , we note that the rates ( [ tun - rates - 3 ] ) depend on the magnetic field . then we note , that the ab ##f is in the upper limit if the flux is varied with the help of a modulation gate . we also see that the current has the _ quasi - particle _ property . this _ does _ not _ violate the byers - wilson theorem , because the current through the interferometer varied by the help of a modulation gate can not be gauged independently . finally , we note that the rates ( [ tun - rates - 3 ] ) are not onlyon the positive bias @ xmath374 , and also on @ xmath312 and @ xmath313 separately , via the total number of electrons in the interferometer , @ xmath375 , which is given by : ( [ totaln ] ) . this seems to violate the gauge invariance . in fact , this is not the case , because we assumed , for simplicity , that the coulomb interaction is controlled by a nearby metallic gate , so that the inner and outer edges of the corbino gate do not interact . this assumption is used in a number of scientific papers , e . g . , in ref . the additional metallic gate plays a role of the positive gate , which also controls the number of electrons in the system . the currents @ xmath312 and @ xmath313 are then measured with respect to this gate . we need to note that the method of screening depends on details of an experimental experiment . we note , however , that these details do not affect the generality of our conclusions about the periodicity of the gate ##r . first we note that , in the situation where the current through the gate is measured by using a magnetic vacuum tube , theelectronic contribution of the current is zero . in this case the energy difference between the states with @ xmath376 and @ xmath27 ##8 - particles is given by @ xmath377 . \ ] ] we may then pass to the classical limit and replace the integral of @ xmath345 by an integral to arrive at expression ( [ tun - therm ] ) . it is also easy to see that , in the general case , with two modes , @ xmath378 , the integral is independent of the flux @ xmath8 . this is because , here , the magnetic flux changes the tunneling rates ( [ tun - rates - energy ] ) , via the energy of the modes , @ xmath139 , in contrast to the situation where the flux is changed with the action of the spin operator . we know that there is an ab effect associated with the singular flux , and in order to find the energy difference of the tunneling rates we need to take into account values that are small in the thermodynamic limit . to this end , we use the algorithm @ xcite that allows to rewrite a sum over complex numbers as an integral , @ xmath379consider the system represented by a straight line in fig . [ pol ] . using this identity and using the shift of variables @ xmath380 , we arrive at the following expression for transition rates : @ xmath381 where we have omitted the constants , and @ xmath333 are the tunneling rates ( [ transition - rates - 1 ] ) . we stress that using the shift of variables as above , the transition rates @ xmath333 are seen _ _ _ to depend on the flux @ xmath27 and the flux @ xmath8 . therefore , we use the analyticity of the numbers @ xmath382 as functions of the flux @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 to move the integration point of ( [ integr - 2 ] ) to the new position , @ xmath383 , as shown in fig . [ pol ] . assuming that @ xmath384 is constant , we expand the square of the integral ( [ integr - 2 ] ) and keep the leading harmonic : @ xmath385 . \ nonumber \ { { 1 } \ ] ] turns this expression into the##q . ( [ integr - 1 ] ) , we see that the first term is our previous expression for the second order contribution to the classical approach . for the second , non - zero , term , the saddle point is not far from the z axis : @ xmath386 because @ xmath387 . this explains the use of the term in the classical approach . using the saddle point term of @ xmath345 we arrive at the following expression for the reaction rates ( [ t - rates ] ) : @ xmath388 \ \ \ , \ exp \ , [ m \ right ] \ , ( \ frac { \ phi _ s r _ s } { mv _ s } + \ frac { m } { s } - \ frac { \ pi } { m \ phi _ s } \ left ) \ right ] , \ , { tun - rates - 1 } \ , { m } \ ] ] where the first term , @ xmath389 , is the rate ( [ t - rates - 1 ] ) taken from @ xmath390 , and the rate @ xmath391 of @ x##math312 and @ xmath313 are given by equations similar to those in fig . ( [ tun - rates - 3 ] ) . these functions , the exact value of which is not known , are independent of @ xmath27 . as mentioned , the other terms ( [ tun - rates - 4 ] ) have large values in @ xmath8 that are rapidly increasing in the thermodynamic limit . @ xcite these terms can be interpreted as coming from the quantum hall effect . however , we note that the flux enters the tunnel ##ing ( [ tun - rates - 4 ] ) only through the combination @ xmath392 . a shift of the current @ xmath8 by one quantum quantum @ xmath0 can be partially compensated by the combination @ xmath393 . the non - zero current is given the expression ( [ curr - d ] ) , where the equations satisfy fig . ( [ conserv ] ) with the constraint @ xmath394 . all these terms are periodic in @ xmath27 with amplitude equal to @ xmath4 and invariant under the replacement @ xmath395. this implies that the average current has the electronic period , @ xmath396 , in agreement with the byers - yang theorem . for example , the combination of : . ( [ conserv ] ) and ( [ curr - d ] ) for @ xmath397 gives the average current @ xmath398 which is explicitly periodic function of @ xmath8 with the electronic period @ xmath0 . at the same time , each tunneling rate @ xmath399 has a quasi - particle motion . thus , the quasi - particle motion with respect to the singular ##ity may in principle be described via , e . g . , the current of measurements at finite frequencies . the latter fact does not imply the byers - yang theorem , because this theorem applies both to the initial state and to long - term measurements . the phenomenon of spin screening plays a key role in proving the byers - yang theorem . we have shown , both on the theoretical and on the experimental energy scales , that it leads to a cancellation of the total spin shift due to the singular magnetic flux tube passing through the ' hole , and of the phase shift induced as a result of the local ##ization of the z. it is this last fact that causes measurements based on qh liquid to stand out from the variety of other electronic interferometers , where the ab effect is treated only as a simple physical phenomenon . we therefore conclude that the ab effect , in its simplest form , does not exist in qh interferometers . to further illuminate the important role of topological symmetry , we will consider here a simple example of a qh liquid at phase transition @ xmath400 , where our theory also applies . according to a commonly used single - particle picture , particles in @ xmath400 ##1 move along the equipotential lines . we may then consider the qh liquid to be an open system , where single - particle orbits form a sphere as shown in the upper right of fig . [ frol - simpl ] , and apply the same theory . since the position of the orbits does not change , being fixed by the equipotential lines , the only effect of the singular ##ity flux is to shift the phase of single - particle wave ##lets , which leads to the overall observed phase shift @ xmath401 in scattering amplitudes . finally , by the landauer - bttiker equation , @ xcite oneone finds that the average amplitude should oscillate as a function of the singular flux with the period @ xmath0 , in strong accord with the effect of topological screening . addressing this problem , we first reiterate that ( i ) the qh effect has a topological character , so the naive quantum mechanical approach may not be applicable to qh interferometers , and ( ii ) topological screening results from the quantum action of many particles , so that the single - particle picture does not correctly represent the effect of insertion of the singular flux . as we see below , the single - particle picture is consistent with the mathematical description of the @ xmath400 ##0 , and with the many - particle laughlin distribution function ( [ 1 ] ) , only in the case of an absolutely symmetric corbino disk ( i . e . , for @ xmath402 ) . however , in this case the ab phase shift varies only with the phase shift induced by the physical displacement of the orbits after the insertion of the singular flux , in perfect accord with the effect of topological screening . one may argue , however , that a laughing system is not realistic : it is a small part of a larger qh system . therefore , we must rely onconsider the case of an open corbino disk ( see fig . [ singl ] ) and show that the single - particle system follows the pauli principle . then , in a qh system , the eigenstates of the non - linear hamiltonian are the single - particle orbits that move along the equipotential axis , shown in fig . [ singl ] as thin black lines . two operators ( blue line @ xmath403 and red line @ xmath404 ) partition the orbits into two groups with different angular momentum with respect to the hole in the corbino disk , i . e . , with respect to @ xmath405 . thus , in the ground state , the single - particle orbits inside the corbino disk are stationary . the initial distribution of the singular flux through the hole at the point @ xmath40 does not affect the interaction between two groups , because those orbits do not encircle the hole . at the same time , the orbits that belong to the other two groups contain the flux , and therefore , move inwards or outwards in order to maintain positive valuedness . this leads to the accumulation and depletion of thethe density of the regions between the lines @ xmath403 and @ xmath404 . thus we conclude that the single - particle basis , based on the eigenstates of a non - interacting hamiltonian , fails to correctly describe the motion of the singular flux , because it leads to compressible orbits in the domain of the 2deg . the second approach consists of using the single - particle basis which leads to unconfined orbits @ xmath406 . these are exactly the eigenstates of a non - interacting hamiltonian in the domain of the vector potential . nevertheless , before the insertion of the singular flux the bases are orthogonal to each other and related by a linear transformation . after the insertion of the flux , the correct singe - type basis corresponds to the wave function ( [ t - magn ] ) , which describes _ incompressible _ deformations . in the end , we would like to mention that the insertion of the singular flux is an idealization introduced in this paper in order to study the effects of topological screening . such a procedure is not easily performed by computers . however , in what follows we consider two simple examples of the effect of topological screening on qh , wherea homogeneous magnetic field is varied . we assume that . in this case the total magnetic flux through the hole in the mz interferometer is zero and gives no rise to the screening period , because the homogeneous flux may be viewed as uniformly distributed . ##ity . this screening effect can , in principle , be tested in an experiment with a mz gate with filling factor @ xmath407 . first , one should apply the voltage to an additional hole in order to significantly increase the size of the hole in the gate , without affecting the total area of the qh liquid enclosed in the interfering gate , as shown in fig . [ exper1 ] . we predict that due to the effect of topological screening the period of the oscillations as a function of the applied magnetic field will remain constant , despite the strong change of the geometrical shape of the hole after the application of the applied voltage . next , we consider the effect of topological screening in qh systems with a long - range disorder . if the filling factor is slightly different from the threshold @ xmath3 , but the qh system is located at the lower end of the hall conductivity , then there are several unoccupied stable states in the bulk . thisimplies , that the liquid qh liquid in the bulk of the 2deg contains several holes , which result from the fluctuations of the disorder amplitude . due to the effect of topological symmetry , the flux through these holes does not contribute to the ab phase . therefore , the ab phase is proportional only to the surface area of the liquid qh liquid in the bulk @ xmath408 , and not to the geometrical area @ xmath409 . this should lead to a linear dependence of the period of ab oscillations on the magnetic field : @ xmath410 in general , in experiments with a surface disorder , given that the electric field exceeds the cyclotron gap , such a behavior should be observed in a range of magnetic fields that is larger than the size of a single hole . we think that the linear magnetic field dependence ( [ 1 ] ) might have already been observed in a number of experiments on fabry - prot interferometers . @ xcite recently , the mechanism of ab oscillations in these interferometers has become the subject of considerable debate . a number of authors have claimed that : the linear periodicity can be observed in mz interfer##ometers operating on qh occur at fractional filling times @ xmath3 . we have briefly discussed those results in the paper , and in more detail , in the appendix c of our earlier paper [ ] . here we recall that the main argument against the observability of s ##n with a constant , quasi - particle period is based on the byers - yang theorem , which states that the steady - state current in the interferometer varies with the same period @ xmath0 as a result of the singular magnetic field @ xmath8 passing through the interferometer s ##1 . the experimental models have in common that they do not differentiate between three methods of the measurement of the flux , namely , by inserting the # ##ity tube , by applying a modulation gate voltage , and by applying a homogeneous magnetic field . all these methods rely on the field theory approach . in our earlier paper we have criticized those works and found that the average current may oscillate with the quasi - particle period @ xmath2 in response to the modulation gate voltage , and that this behavior does not violate the byers - yang theorem ( see appendix c of ref . [ ] ) . however , the arguments rely mainly onthe original theory seem to be insufficient . therefore , in the present paper we refine our theory and base it on the exact , effective , and kinetic theory respectively . we use the laughlin variational wave function of the @ xmath3 system , which is shown to have a large agreement with the exact wave function , and construct the space of gapless stationary states of the qh state of the mz interferometer . we proceed by imposing the microscopic hamiltonian on the space of such states and arrive at the low - energy theory of the interferometer in the presence of a uniform magnetic flux , and in the presence of the applied modulation of voltage . we derive the effective theory for the mz system from the chern - simons model and in essentially perfect agreement with the results of the low - energy projection . finally , using the effective theory , we develop the kinetic theory approach to an mz system in a non - singular current - carrying state , and study the oscillations of the average state . we conclude that the result of ref . [ ] is correct . our results are summarized below . first of all , we consider the effect of the screening of a magnetic flux threading through theit is an intrinsic qh phenomenon , which manifested itself in the change of the local rotational period of the wave function due to the flux and of the phase change induced as a result of the physical displacement of the wave function . on the theoretical level , this effect appears naturally as a consequence of the single - valuedness of the laughlin wave function . on the quantum theory level , it arises from the cancellation of the action potential associated with the singular flux and of the chern - simons field induced by the displacement of the wave function in response to the insertion of the flux field . this effect has a global , topological nature , because it does not depend on the location of the hole . as a result , the ab ##f , in its simplest form , can only be observed in qh systems in principle . taking into account this effect is crucial for understanding the byers - johnson paradox . nevertheless , a qh system in general , and an electronic mz interferometer in particular , will respond to the insertion of the singular flux in the form of periodic fluctuations in the average steady - state state . these oscillations result from the transfer of the charge between the states , and from the charge quantization . however , these osci##llations are associated with the magnetic blockade effect , should have an electronic period @ xmath0 , and should vanish in the classical limit , where the mz loop may be considered an isolated quantum system . thus , our model leads to the byers - wilson theorem . on the other hand , we predict that when the total magnetic flux @ xmath8 in the ' s loop is varied with the help of a modulation gate attached to the arm of the loop , the electric current will oscillate as a function of this flux with the quasi - particle period @ xmath2 . such a striking difference between two models can be seen as if the modulation gate field ` ` couples ' ' to the local quasi - particle charge @ xmath7 at the arm of a qh loop , while the magnetic field ` ` couples ' ' to the local charge of laughlin quasi - particles , which is close to zero . we note that to fully resolve the controversy about the nature of the quasi - particle interference it is important to either prove or disprove ab oscillations with quasi - particle charges in electronic mz interferometers . also , we note that this ., which has to be done at integer filling factors , might be not an easy task . therefore , we suggest , as an initial step , to directly demonstrate the effect of topological screening by carrying out these measurements , as explained in sec . [ conseq ] ( see fig . [ exper1 ] ) . however , by performing these measurements we can demonstrate the effect of topological screening only at integer filling factors , e . g . , at @ xmath400 . we can predict that in strongly disordered qh systems , as a result of topological screening , the period of the oscillations should not depend on the magnetic field across the surface of the sample surface . our main remarks concern the properties of quasi - particle operators and of the tunneling hamiltonians . first we show that we can construct quasi - particle operators by projecting quasi - particle representations of the laughlin wave function onto the high - energy subspace . we then demonstrate that so many operators have anyonic ##ity relations and create local charges of the form @ xmath7 . second , our results show that it is possible to define particle operators as free particles moving from one local charge to another and creating a ` ` statistical phasetube ' ' . instead , they are constructed by introducing holes located at qpcs . it is possible to represent tunneling operators in terms of wilson lines , which are end points of the tunneling operators . then it becomes clear why these operators are related to the number @ xmath21 of quasi - holes located at the center of the corbino disk , contrary to what the earlier authors claimed . this is because the wilson lines that are tunneling at different qpcs can be connected without touching the center of the corbino disk . however , we have no knowledge of filling factors in these operators . therefore , even at two spatial scales , they do not necessarily exist , except for the fabry - prot interferometer , as described in the appendix [ app - comm ] . we begin by showing that the proposed quantum theory of an optical mz interferometer can be generalized to states with other filling factors than @ xmath1 , in particular , to the states with non - abelian groups of electrons . thus , our results are easily generalizable to systems with a different geometry , e . g . , to the fabry - prot model . although , the physicsin general will remain the same , but it may bring new experimental results . in light of our new findings on the theory of the quasi - particle interference , it is very interesting to discuss the theory of quasi - particle exchange and statistics . we consult c . a . a . beenakker , a . cheianov , and a . koroliuk for valuable information . this project has been funded by the swiss national science foundation . first we show commutation relations for quasi - particle operators and for tunnel operators ( [ h - tunnel ] ) at physically separated points . first of all , we show that the scattering relation described in sec . [ s - project ] leads to the anyonic ##ity relations @ xcite for the quasi - particle operators . to this end , we apply the projection method ( [ projection - def ] ) to the quasi - particle operators ( [ qp - def ] ) and carry out calculations similar to those that led to the theory ( [ h - tunnel ] ) for tunneling operators . this method gives us the following formula for the high - energy behavior of quasi - particle operators note , that the operator ( [ qp - def ] ) has no charge , i . e . , it creates a quantumexcitation with the charge @ xmath7 corresponds with the homogeneous density along the edge with the charge @ xmath414 . therefore , in the high - energy limit we have multiplied the quasi - particle operators by the factor @ xmath415 in order to minimize the effect of the homogeneous density . thus , the resulting field ( [ qp - proj ] ) can generate new fields with the charge @ xmath7 . from the ( [ phi - a ] ) and ( [ qp - proj ] ) , we see that all these operators agree with whose vector field sec . [ phi - a ] is the effective energy level . and to similar results for the adjoint operators . now we replace @ xmath417 with @ xmath295 at the outer edge , and @ xmath418 at the inner edge . the phase relations ( [ commut - qp ] ) show that quasi - particles ( [ qp - proj ] ) are anyons @ xcite with the statistical charge @ xmath419 . note , that the phase relations on the right hand side of the equation ( [ commut - qp ] ) are @ xmath4- wave function on the circle . this is consistent with the fact that quasi - particle operators are not multi - valued . however , the calculations show that the operators on the opposite edges do not commute : @ xmath420 in other words , a quasi - particle on the outer edge indicates the presence of another quasi - particle on the inner edge . this is because the presence of a quasi - particle on the outer edge has the numbers @ xmath24 and @ xmath21 . the addition of this number gives a _ topological _ , which leads to a change of the wave function and changes the chern - cohen equation ( [ h - solution ] ) . next , we work on the following relations for the space of quasi - particle operators . first of all , we would like to emphasize that at the quantum level the two operators cannot commute , because they are just connected . however , being mapped onto high - energy states , they do not necessarily interact , if only at different energy scales . the direct calculation for the operator ( [ h - tunnel ] ) with the addition of the . ( [ zeromodecom ] ) and ( [ commut - mic ] ) leads to the following expression: @ xmath421 \ mathcal { a } ( \ xi _ r ) \ mathcal { b } ( \ xi _ l ) \ ] ] for the upper system , @ xmath422 , which is an open mz system , this leads to a similar expression : @ xmath423 where the stationary process takes the following form . for the fabry - prot system , using @ xmath424 and @ xmath425 and vice versa ( see ref . [ e - 1 ] ) , we find that the operators [ @ xmath426 = # $ ] . we note that the definition of the commutator of [ ##s is equivalent to the above expression . the result is in fact related to the corresponding chern - doherty field ( see the section at the end of ref . [ qptunneling ] ) and naturally takes into account the geometry of the system . however , we note that the models ( [ commut - qp ] ) and ( [ commut - mz ] ) are a good approximation of the model of the mz system that we found in ref . we have that .that tunnel operators , derived from the effective value of the qh edge operator , do not need to exist , because the presence of a tunnel in the spectrum of the samples of the incompressible qh boundary makes them nonlocal . however , we do not have any knowledge of the klein factors @ xcite in tunnel operators ( [ x - tunnel ] ) , when expressed in terms of the quasi - particle charge ( [ qp - proj ] ) . very recently , effective values of quasi - particle charges , determined via shot noise analysis , have been published in a . dolev , m . wang , j . c . chung , m . heiblum , a . umansky , and d . mahalu , arxiv : 0911 . 3023 . these results strongly suggest that the fano value of the weak tunnel operator is not determined solely by the quasi - particle charge . the use of the term ` ` charge fractionalization ' ' in this context is somewhat misleading , because , in contrast to the quasi - particle fractionalization , the tunnel process is not classical in nature . in fact , it is very similar to the displacement process in electrical circuits . j . a . simmons , h .p . wei , l . w . engel , d . c . tsui , and m . shayegan , phys . lett . * 44 * , 1731 ( 1989 ) ; j . h . simmons , j . h . hwang , d . c . tsui , j . p . wei , l . w . engel , and m . shayegan , phys . b . b * 95 * , 12933 ( 1991 ) ; f . e . camino , w . zhou and v . j . goldman , phys . lett . * 98 * , 246802 ( 2005 ) ; f . e . camino , w . zhou and v . j . goldman , phys . b * 98 * , 075342 ( 2005 ) ; f . e . camino , w . zhou and v . j . goldman , phys . * 98 * , 076805 ( 2007 ) ; f . e . camino , w . zhou and v . j . goldman , phys . b * 98 * , 115301 ( 2006 ) ; r . j . willett , j . l . pfeiffer , j . l . smith , pnas * 106 * , 8853 ( 2009) ; r . j . willett , j . a . pfeiffer , j . m . weiss , , arxiv : 0911 . 0345 . i . neder , m . heiblum , m . levinson , d . mahalu , and v . umansky , phys . * 96 * , 016804 ( 2006 ) ; i . neder , m . marquardt , m . heiblum , d . mahalu , and v . umansky , theoretical b * 96 * , 534 ( 2007 ) ; e . bieri , _ correlation and correlation ##s with quantum states _ , doctoral thesis , university of zurich ( dec . 2007 ) ; e . bieri , m . weiss , m . goktas , m . hauser , m . schonenberger , and m . oberholzer , phys . b . 96 * , 245324 ( 2009 ) ; m . roulleau , m . portier , j . a . glattli , m . roche , m . cavanna , m . faini , m . gennser , and m . mailly , phys . b * 96 * , 161309 ( 2010) ( 2007 ) ; m . roulleau , m . portier , m . a . glattli , m . roche , m . cavanna , m . faini , m . gennser , and m . mailly , phys . * 48 * , 126802 ( 2008 ) ; l . v . litvin , h . - tranitz , w . wegscheider , and c . strunk , phys . b * 78 * , 033315 ( 2007 ) ; l . v . litvin , m . helzel , h . - tranitz , w . wegscheider , and c . strunk , phys . b * 78 * , 075303 ( 2008 ) . y . wang , y . z . wang , phys . b * 45 * , 8337 ( 1991 ) ; a . kogan , a . a . perelomov and a . a . semenoff , phys . b . b * 50 * , 12084 ( 1992 ) ; a . gurarie , a . nayak , nucl . b * 506 * , 685 ( 1997 ) ; m . le gail , m . regnault, and j . a . goerbig , phys . 77 * * * , 165310 ( 2008 ) . to be precise , the operators ( [ zeromodedef ] ) are not unitary if @ xmath24 and @ xmath21 are equal . however , in the upper limit ( @ xmath428 ) these operators are unitary and satisfy the commutation relations ( [ zeromodecom ] ) . note that the states of the inner and outer edges have different chiralities . at the same time , we want the field @ xmath303 to be counter - clockwise at the outer edge . this leads to the opposite sign of the sums ( [ commut - sums ] ) of fields @ xmath259 and @ xmath260 , and to opposite signs in the notation for the densities @ xmath429 and @ xmath430 in terms of these fields , as e . g . , in ref . ( [ rho - z - mic ] ) . the three fields ( @ xmath238 , @ xmath431 , @ xmath21 and @ xmath24 in our notation##s ) and the two modes are usually described separately in the literature on the qh edge theory ( see , e . g . , ref . [ ] ) . here we follow our previous definition @ xcite and combine them into a real - valued operator , because this preserves the coupling constant and the resulting hamiltonian . the notion of the upper limit for an mz system requires some clarification . however , this class of interferometers are generally considered to be pure quantum systems , as shown in the lower panel of fig . [ frol - simpl ] . in reality , however , electronic mz systems based on a qh edge are finite temperature systems . this is because they are connected to an ohmic contact , not to the interferometer ( see the lower panel of fig . [ frol - simpl ] ) . therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the coupling of the mz interferometer to ohmic contact is strong . however , unless proven otherwise , we avoid this assumption by taking the form @ xmath387 , where @ xmath353 , i . e . , assuming that the level spacing at the both ends .pressure compared to temperature .
