the study of galaxies ( sne ) has greatly expanded in the last 20 years . systematic and highly automated surveys of nearby galaxies ( e . g . , schmidt et al . 1996 ; treffers et al . 1997 ; filippenko et al . 2001 ; dimai 2001 ; qiu & hu 2001 ) , wide - field , highly sensitive surveys ( e . g . , reiss et al . 1998 ; chang - li & maoz 1999 , 2002 ; hardin et al . 2000 ; schaefer 2000 ) , and object - oriented , automated , high - redshift sn ##v programs ( perlmutter et al . 1997 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ) now continue to yield hundreds of important new discoveries each year . ambitious projects that are currently planned and underway [ e . g . , the automated supernova survey aldering et al . 2001 ; the comet / asteroid survey ( sam ) perlmutter et al . 2000 ; automated comet tracking in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ; vanden ##berg et al . 2001 ; miknaitis et al . 2001b ; and ##r @ xmath9 ] to increase these numbers by at least an order of magnitude . sneare binary stars , and classified into several subtypes , with the primary classification criteria based on their properties . briefly , sne of type ii show emission lines in their spectra while sne of type i do not . each of these types is further divided into subtypes , the most used types being ia , ib , and ic , as well as ii - p , ii - l , iin , and iib . see filippenko ( 1997 ) for a thorough review and @ xmath10 for more details . it is widely accepted that sne ia is formed from the gravitational disruption of a white dwarf at or near the chandrasekhar limit , while the other types of sne ( ib , ic , and ii ) result from the gravitational collapse of binary stars . while understanding sne , their properties , and their formation mechanisms are of great interest , sne are also useful tools in the solution of various other important problems . sne ia are excellent distance measurements , and their hubble diagram has been used to determine the true shape of the hr diagram ( e . g . , parodi et al . 2000 , and discussed below ) . the extension of the hr diagram to the reds##hifts ( @ xmath11 ) describes the mass and matter - energy distribution of the universe ( e . g . , goobar & perlmutter 1995 ) . two independent groups made large numbers of observations - @ xmath12 sne ii presented a test case for the gravitational acceleration of the universe ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; see filippenko 2001 for a review ) , consistent with a nonzero cosmological model , @ xmath13 . further observations ( riess et al . 2001 ) based on a single sn ia observation @ xmath14 possibly demonstrated the transition from gravity - dominated deceleration to @ xmath13 - dominated acceleration , @ xmath15 . sne ii - p can also be used for cosmic ray measurements through the expanding universe method ( epm ; kirshner & kwan 1974 ; schmidt , kirshner , & kwan 1992 ; schmidt et al . 1994 ) , which was most recently demonstrated by hamuy et al . ( 2001 ) and leonard et al . ( 2002a , b ) . leonard et al . ( 2002a ; see also hflich et al . 2001 ) showed that thecorrection to @ xmath16 % ( @ xmath17 ) may be achieved for sne ii - p by simply measuring the observed mean visual magnitude , eliminating the need for a detailed epm calculation unless a more accurate method is desired . hamuy & cohen ( 2002 ) use this technique , so that a measurement of the visual magnitude and the ejecta expansion of both yields a much lower error in the measured value . the rates as a function of time reflect the star - formation history of the galaxy , the fundamental processes leading to sne ia , and the cosmological model ( jorgensen et al . 1997 ; garcia et al . 1998 ; ruiz - lapuente & garcia 1998 ; madau , della valle , & panagia 1998 ; yungelson & livio 2000 ) . sn rates are also important for determining the chemical composition and energetics of the galactic medium ( e . g . , matteucci & greggio 1986 ) and the intracluster medium ( e . g . , brighenti & mathews 1998 , 2001 ; lowenstein 2000 ; cohen - cohen , maoz , & sharon 2002 ) . once again , the existence of a true sn , and the natureas a tool for many of the applications above , is almost always based on spectroscopic verification and analysis . the information obtained from sn observations usually includes ( but is not limited to ) the observed brightness , type , and age ( relative to the dates of collision or collision activity ) . spectroscopic verification may not always be easy or reliable . sne , especially at high distances , may be too difficult for observation , even with the large , 10 - m - aperture telescopes currently available . spectroscopy is also not practical if large numbers ( hundreds or thousands ) of sne are discovered within a relatively short time , as is expected to happen in the case of the sdss ##2 cluster ( miknaitis et al . 2001b ; see also @ xmath18 ) . however , spectroscopy is useful for sne discovered in archival data ( gal - yam & maoz 2000 ; riess et al . 2001 ; gal - gal et al . 2002 ) , which have largely disappeared by the time they are found . the discovery of sne in archival data is expected to become possible as high - quality astronomical data becomes larger and more accessible , especially with the development of programs such as astrovirtel ( http : / / www .stecf . org / astrovirtel ) and the national astronomical observatory ( brunner , djorgovski , & szalay 2001 ) . the aim of the present project is to improve the practical exploitation of sne for which no spectroscopic methods exist . the obvious method for this is multi - color broadband spectroscopy . the practical utility of such an approach is demonstrated , in part , by the use of the ` ` high resolution ' ' method to determine the number and type of galaxies and stars that are too faint or too distant to observe spectroscopically ( e . g . , weymann et al . 1999 ; sullivan et al . 2001 ) . developing a similar approach to sne is not possible since , unlike galaxies , the spectra of sne vary greatly with distance , temperature , and time . although photometric approaches to the classification of faint sne have been proposed before ( dahln & fransson 1999 ; johnson et al . 2000 ; riess et al . 2001 ) , no general theory has been presented so far . in a recent paper , dahln & goobar ( 2002 , in dg2002 ) tackle the issue of spectral classification for the case ofand , cosmology - oriented , high - @ xmath12 ia ia . their treatment relies heavily on the standard observational setup used by these programs i . e . , the analysis of images from @ xmath194 weeks ago , designed to detect sne at , or at , peak brightness . as these authors note , this setup is heavily biased toward the detection of sne itself . the main goal of dg2002 is the identification of the high - @ xmath12 sne ia from an experimental sample , the photometry of the individual samples and the sne themselves . for the particular experimental setup they consider , dg2002 also attempts to estimate the population of the sample with non - ia sne . to do this , they use the model of dahln & fransson ( 1999 ) and demonstrate their ability to reject most non - ia sne based on their higher and lower brightness . however , the models used for the population of non - ia sne are based on many assumptions and assumptions , such as the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra , peak brightness , light curves , and the fractions of non - ia sne , that are not well known anywhere in the local region , let alone at peak brightness. while dg2002 seek methods to identify high - @ xmath12 sne # ##s by a single observational setup , we present general methods that apply to all the different sn subtypes and can be used for a wide range of different surveys , including those that are similar to those used by dg2002 . identification of sne using broadband colors is such a complex problem that , as we show below , a full classification ( i . e . , deriving the type , redshift , and age from a few broadband colors ) is probably impossible . however we will argue here that the problem can be simplified . type , redshift , and age need not all be known simultaneously . most sne are associated with host galaxies that are readily detectable . one can therefore determine the redshift of the source from that of the host , usually either from observations ( that can be done long after the source has faded ) or using the observed redshift . in fact , for sne that are found in well - studied regions of the galaxy , the redshift information often still exists . ben - cohen et al . ( 2002 ) recently demonstrated this with sne they discovered using _ _ .space telescope ( hst ) _ list of well - known galaxy - galaxy interactions . none of the three apparent sne they found ( and all of those not associated with the host ) had published information in the literature . for the case of sne , the type can only be determined from observations of the host , and not from a known source . in the case of a host , the cluster type can sometimes be determined by measuring the overall light curve of the galaxy . admittedly , this followup may not pose a problem for faint or very faint galaxies , and is generally not possible for archival sne ( see riess et al . 2001 for an example ) . however , for most of the scientific uses of sne ( e . g . , the derivation of expansion rates ) , the age of the event is immaterial . determination of the type of the cluster is difficult for many of the cases discussed above . the cluster type can be securely determined only from observations of the galaxy cluster itself . while some information can be derived from the data ( e . g . , elliptical galaxies are known to contain only sne galaxies ) , this information is limited and such reasoning does not hold at high .. we now focus our efforts on using multi - mode broadband filters to classify sne . since we want to constrain the spectrum of a star with an arbitrary ( but known ) redshift , it is not simple to utilize broadband filters ; k - codes for sne of all types , and of all ages , are currently available . instead , we have compiled a large statistical sample of known , well - observed sne . these spectra are used to calculate synthetic spectral colors for various sn types through a given window and at a given redshift . the wide coverage of our data allows us to create diagrams in color space which show the evolutionary evolution of each sn type . inspecting the resulting diagrams , one can then look for regions which are either populated by a single type of sn , or that are populated by various other types . the broadband color spectrum of a candidate sn with a known redshift can then be plotted against the resulting diagrams , and estimates on its size and age may be applied . as we saw in @ xmath20 , the type of the sample can still be uniquely determined . when this is not the case , the type can still be determined by supplementing the color data with other available dataon the sn , such as information on its brightness , and information ( even if very little ) on its variability ( e . g . , whether its brightness is rising or falling ) . our sn classification method is based on ages , determined by the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the event . by definition , such a method can differentiate only between sn subtypes with similar physical characteristics . hypothetically , two sne with very different physical properties ( e . g . , light curves , and temperature ) , but having similar seds but different ages , would not be distinguished by our method . the new classification method we propose needs , therefore , to rely only on physical properties . fortunately , the common classification of sne ( see filippenko 1997 for a review ) is mostly based on their spectra , with one notable exception which we see here . it is customary to divide the sn population into two main subgroups : type ii sne , which show strong hydrogen lines in their spectra , and type i sne , which do not ( minkowski 1941 ) . type i sne are further divided into type ia whose spectra are characterized by a strong absorption trough ii @ xmath21 , similar to blueshifted si ii @xmath226347 , 6371 ##d , type ib that show both he i lines , and type ic that show both he ii and he i ( e . g . , matheson et al . 2001 , and discussed below ) . type ii sne are divided ( e . g . , barbon , ciatti , & rosino 1979 ; doggett & branch 1985 ) into two groups according to their light - curve shape : sne ii - l show a pronounced plateau during the h @ xmath23 phase of their evolution , and sne ii - l appears as a linear pattern in the space vs . time plot , similar to sne i . other studies ( e . g . , filippenko 1997 ) show that sne ii - l have similar spectra , with the h @ xmath24 line showing a p - cygni component . on the other hand , sne ii - l have not been well characterized spectroscopically , and the best spectroscopically characterized lines ( sne 1979c and 1980k ) are thought to be very rare ( ` ` overluminous ' ' ; miller & branch 1990 ) compared to other sne ii - l . during the1990s , the focus of studies of sne ii shifted from photometry to spectroscopy . two new subtypes have emerged . sne iin has strong " @ xmath24 emission ( e . g . , schlegel 1990 ; filippenko 1997 , and references therein ) , and sne iib has dark lines that first appear as a young sne ii , then evolve to form sne ib ( filippenko 1988 ; filippenko , matheson , & ho 1993 ; matheson et al . 2001 , and references here ) . for our purposes , only the subtypes with well - defined spectral properties are meaningful . we will consider not only sne ii - p , iin , and iib as subtypes of the sn ii population . sne iin and iib represent quite a large portion of the total population that was previously classified as type ii - p based solely on their light - curve shape ( about half of the type ii population , e . g . , cappellaro et al . with the latest available data available to us , we conclude that most of the sne ii populations in our studies belong to the spectroscopically defined subtypes ii -ii , iin , and iib ( see below ) . sne is a broad continuum , with both rare and very unusual events , from rare hypernovae ( e . g . , s 1998bw galama et al . 1998 ; patat et al . 2001 ; s 1997cy ##u et al . 2000 ; turatto et al . 2000 ; s 1997ef iwamoto et al . 2000 ; matheson et al . 2001 ) to faint ##er 1987a - type objects ( e . g . , arnett et al . 1989 , and references here ) , and to ` ` rare ' ' ( e . g . , filippenko et al . 1995a ; van dyk et al . 2000 , and references here ) . therefore , we restrict our study to those types that are not so rare , and are well - defined and well - characterized spectroscopically . assuming that the sne galaxies in the iau catalog are all of the galaxy type that is discovered by amateur astronomers , we conclude that , roughly , the well - defined subtypes we consider ( ia , ib , ib , ia - p , iin , and iib ) are :least 10 % , and probably more , of the total population . for example , we have all the sne that were discovered during the year 2000 and whose type was not reported in iau circulars , or alternatively could be determined by data available to us . among the 34 events , there were 10 type ia , 5 type ib , 5 type ic , 2 type iin , one type iib , one peculiar sne ia , one peculiar sn ib , and 34 events which were reported just as ` ` type ia . ' ' from the observations and data reported in the iau circulars , we learn that of the remaining 34 events , 11 of a p - cygni type , 11 @ xmath24 , 11 of sne ii - p , 7 events may or may not belong to the ii - p , iin , or iib subtypes , and 7 events are definitely not ii - p , iin , or iib events . while 86 events ( 85 % ) belong to our spectroscopically defined spectral types ( types ia , ib , ic , ii - p , iin , and iib ) , 13 events ( 10 % ) may or may not be of these types , and just 6 events ( 5 % )are likely to be of types not found in our database . it is therefore likely that data available on our database will be relevant to the large population of sne discovered by current searches . this is probably also true for future programs that will use similar classification systems . we are concerned that a large number of very unusual sne ( e . g . , ngc 1987a - like ) may be underrepresented by current sn statistics . analysis of the data that will be relevant to such events may require their inclusion in the spectral database . the basis of our classification system is the spectral database : a compilation of the spectra of the sne . most of the these spectra were obtained with the shane ##t - m reflector at lick observatory . the typical resolution is less than @ xmath25 ( full width at the maximum ) , and the majority of the spectra used cover the range 320010000 . some spectra with narrower resolution ( ~ 40008000 ) are also available . these spectra were either obtained at the parallactic level ( filippenko 1982 ) , or obtained by direct photometry , to ensure that the shape changes due to wavelength - dependent light intensity were not significant . some bands were removed , generally by laserby the spectrum of a single star . according to the theoretical model of the observed sn , the results were corrected for the error , using the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & taylor ( 1998 ) and the light curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) . the working version of the model was constructed in the following years . for each of the well - defined sn subtypes listed above , we have constructed a prototype . the main criterion was the presence of spectra with wide temporal variation and multiple components . in addition , a few standard spectra of different types were used in order to ensure consistency and fill gaps in the spectral evolution , when needed . table 1 shows the sne whose spectra comprise our database , with the type spectra for each subtype listed first . we have carefully selected events that were known to either have considerable distortion , or to be otherwise peculiar . for sne ia , peculiar ( overluminous , ngc 1991t - like , or underluminous , sn 1991bg - like ) events are very well characterized , and may be quite common , at least in low - temperature stars ( li et al . our main database contains the spectra of thesne ia , but we have the spectrum of the sne ia ned @ xmath26 ##a . the spectra are de - redshifted according to the host - galaxy redshift taken from the ned ##s . after redshifting the spectrum again to a higher redshift ( see below ) , the telluric filters are re - applied before producing synthetic colors . using our own data , we estimate the total color of sne at a given redshift using the johnson - cousins @ xmath4 ( johnson 1965 ; cousins 1976 ; see moro & munari 2000 for details ) , bessell @ xmath27 ( bessell & brett 1988 ) , and sdss @ xmath6 ( fukugita et al . 1996 ; stoughton et al . 2002 ) filter systems . if a # s bandpass is not fully covered by the sn spectrum , the flux in the missing spectral region is extrapolated according to the median magnitude of the spectrum . each calculated value that includes such an error is assigned an error proportional to the amount of flux in the extrapolated region of the spectrum , thus giving a conservative error rate . the resulting synthetic color is then displayed as color- color diagrams . note that in all the diagrams we present , the ordinate and bar are composed of bands consisting of other bands ( e . g . , @ xmath28 vs . @ xmath29 , @ xmath29 vs . @ xmath1 etc . ) . since most of the spectra in our study have a narrow wavelength range , the bars will therefore usually appear only along one band . in the next section we present color diagrams , discuss their use in the classification of sne discovered by computer scientists , and derive a few general rules . note that the set of parameters that give the best possible color differentiation , apart from the obvious dependence on the wave function itself , also depends on redshift . for these reasons , for each spectrum ( having some known redshift and some known color ) one has to search for color - coding diagrams that provide the best color differentiation . the above constraints allow us to present below just a few representative examples of color diagrams . similar information for arbitrary values of @ xmath12 may be obtained from our website ( http : / / color - spectrum . tau . org . uk / $ \ sim $ dovip / typing ) . in figure 1 , we show ourdata on sne correspond to template colors of normal sne ia provided by leibundgut ( 1988 ) . we can see that our sample spectra follow the expected curve in color space , with a small deviation ( @ xmath30 ##0 ) , consistent with the previously mentioned dispersion of sne ia colors ( e . g . , tripp 1998 ; phillips et al . 1999 , and references therein ) . since our sample database includes colors of sn 1994d , which was somewhat brighter by several times than normal sne ia ( phillips et al . 1995 ) , our data covers an even wider variety of the colors of early sne ia . from this plot , we can estimate the expected number of color - space paths for normal sne ia to be @ xmath300 . 3 mag . note that sne ia follow a complex curve in color space , with a small turn - off at @ xmath16 d at peak brightness . the underlying color pattern is nontrivial . like most sne , the spectral line of normal sne ia is very blue , and becomes redder as the star grows larger . this process is dominant during the first weeks of sn ia life , but is then reversed by the emergence ofand emission lines in the blue part of the spectrum ( restframe 40005500 ) . the blue - dominated spectrum results against the results for late - type ( @ xmath31 d ) sne ia ( e . g . , figure 3 , below ) . in figure 3 our results for sne ii - p are plotted against the spectral photometry of the recent , well - known sn 1999em . it can be clearly seen that the results match perfectly up to about 110 d past peak brightness , where a bifurcation occurs in our observed spectral lines . our observed data for sne ii - p are based on three different sources ( sne 1992h , 1999em , and 2001x ) . the three lines that have been measured @ xmath28 d ( at 110 , 127 , and 130 d ) have all been calculated from the spectra of ngc 2001x , which up to that point are consistent with the other sne ii - p spectra . this is the well - known variety of late - type spectra of sne ia ( filippenko 1997 ) . in subsequent calculations , we compare both branches of ` ` old ' ' sne ii - p ( with the results obtained from spectra of ngc 2001x ) , when significantlydifferent , ( a different color ) , and treat the color space occupied by them as a possible location for the sne . contrary to sne ia , the color history of sne ii - p is relatively short . the observed color evolution is driven mostly by the change in the spectral lines , from slightly blue in early light , to darker with time ( e . g . , filippenko 1997 ) . late - time ( @ xmath31 d ) colors are increasingly dominated by strong and broad emission lines , especially in @ xmath24 , that give sne ii - p their characteristic late - time color ( see , e . g . , fig . 2 , below ) . in figure 3 ( top right ) , we show the color paths of all types of sne with a redshift in @ xmath28 mag . @ xmath29 . one assumes that many sne before maximum light are blue , with @ xmath32 mag . while most young sne ia are @ xmath33 mag , most sne ia are blue @ xmath29 colors ( @ xmath34 mag ) but redder @ xmath28 colors , with @ xmath35 mag . it is possiblenote that young ( @ xmath36 d ) sne ia have green colors ( @ xmath37 mag , @ xmath38 mag ) , as do those of the sne ii - p ( ages 19100 d ) which have the darkest colors of all sne . the arrow shows the extinction effect due to @ xmath39 mag of extinction , assuming the color reddening model of cardelli et al . we can see that the unique colors of young ( @ xmath40 d ) and very old ( @ xmath31 d ) sne ia can easily be masked out by the brightness of their spectra . furthermore , we note that high extinction values are common for sne ia . for example , only two among 49 sne ia ( @ xmath41 ) studied by the cfa and caln / tololo programs , and one by riess et al . ( 1999 ) , have @ xmath42 mag . however , because extinction occurs only in one direction , some objects with the observed colors can be uniquely identified to be sne ia . however , the rest of the diagram is populated with sne of all colors . for example , a high - extinctionsn , of unknown type , with colors of @ xmath43 mag , @ xmath44 mag , would be impossible to classify based on these colors only . but the bottom panel of figure 3 shows that if one adds an additional color , such as @ xmath1 , this degeneracy can be somewhat reduced . for the same @ xmath45 mag , there is a spread in @ xmath1 that might shed some light on the unknown type . negative values of @ xmath46 mag would suggest a type ia classification , while a positive value would suggest one of the core - collapse types . addition of an @ xmath2 measurement ( fig . 3 , bottom panel ) would open the options even further , since for this example , at this point , different types have different values , from the simplest sne ia to the reddest types ( ib , ib , and ib - p ) . looking at the color maps in the middle and bottom panels of figure 3 , we again see that only the color ( @ xmath47 mag ) can move sne ia into color regions populated by core - collapse sne . before we proceed , we should focus on the number of host -galaxy radiation . since our sensitivity to the redshift of a given sn is a small quantity , and this is only known from the observations of the host galaxy , no data on the galaxy should exist . it should therefore generally be possible to subtract the observed s ##n from the observed z . to measure the effect of non - subtraction of host - galaxy radiation , or no radiation , we parameterize the amount of the observed light emitted , at a given time , by the ratio @ xmath48 where @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 are the mean values of the host galaxy and ii spectra , respectively , averaged over the full range of the spectrum of the sn . we define contamination by radiation , when it is least likely to make one type of galaxy look like another . first , we find that for all types of sne and ii , when @ xmath51 the amount of contamination is also negligible . for young sne ia , the worst - case scenario would be the contamination by a red ##der host that could make them look like redder core - galaxy sne . when observed in restframe young galaxies ( e . g . , @ xmath##52 ) , this effect becomes significant only when @ xmath53 , and if blue bands ( e . g . , @ xmath54 ) are removed , young sne can produce colors similar to those of the core - collapse population already at @ xmath55 . the blue effect ( i . e . , of bluer host galaxies with a core - collapse sne ) is much weaker , so contamination by spiral galaxies is unlikely to link core - collapse sne with young sne ia . only heavy contamination ( @ xmath56 ) from a very blue , star - forming host galaxy can make a red type o - p ia similar to a blue sn ia at the @ xmath52 sub - color level . with blue bands ( e . g . , @ xmath54 ) , in this extreme case , significant shifts in color . we conclude that if the original background light has been subtracted , at least roughly , from the measured background light , residual contamination has no significant implication . a large emission from an intermediate host ( e . g . , with a flux similar to that of the sn itself ) that has already been removed may mask young sne ia during core - collapse events ,but is enough to make red core - collapse stars appear in sne ia . in the discussion below , we can see contamination of the sn photometry with light from the underlying older galaxy . with increasing age , the available spectral information shifts to longer - wavelength filters . the middle panel of figure 4 shows how the sne ia can be distinguished from other types of @ xmath57 on the @ xmath1 axis . @ xmath2 axis . on the @ xmath2 axis the only sne with negative color is sne ia . they are also the only type with @ xmath1 color larger than 0 . 3 mag while @ xmath2 is smaller than 0 . 3 mag . during most of the temporal evolution of sne ia , their separation from other types is largely determined by the galaxy dust composition , as can be seen from the vector diagram ( the reddening is calculated from the galactic reference frame ) . the middle panel of figure 4 shows a vector diagram computed at @ xmath58 . classification is obviously more difficult . however , sne ia - p ( including ` ` sn 2001x - p , ' ' and @ xmath59 ) at distances above 2 d have@ xmath2 values higher than sne of all types ( of all ages ) . close to peak brightness , sne ia have @ xmath1 values of a few tens of a mag higher than other types , and again , this distinction is not sensitive to distance . even where these types seem to mingle , at @ xmath60 mag and @ xmath61 mag , sne ia and ii - p have @ xmath1 values that are 0 . 2 mag higher than other types . should any of these types be rendered unlikely by other data , such as a star that is too bright to be a type ii - p , the classification may be ambiguous or nearly identical . for example , sne ii - p can be unambiguously identified by their light curves ; no other sn observed has a nearly equal @ xmath54 value for such a long period . in contrast , two @ xmath62 - p ( restframe ) bands separated by , say , 30 d would unambiguously identify an type ii - p . at redshifts higher than 0 . 6 , the @ xmath62 band is the restframe region , not covered byour spectral database . currently , only one filter ( @ xmath2 ) exists in the x - cousins system . the sdss filter system has three filters ( @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 , and @ xmath12 ) in the approximate area covered by the @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 filters , but extended farther into the region by @ xmath67 . with this information , we can extend our analysis to higher temperatures . this is shown in the bottom right of figure 4 for sne at @ xmath7 . again , late - time sne ia - i are significantly brighter than other types ( @ xmath68 mag and @ xmath69 mag ) , while early - time sne ia are significantly bluer ( @ xmath70 mag and @ xmath71 mag ) , and remain so even in the presence of significant contamination by dust . at later times ( over several decades ) , sne ia escape from the temperatures of other types and reach @ xmath72 temperatures of 0 . 5 mag . sne iin at this temperature appear to be different from other types . if we move evenfarther down the redshift , the use of infrared ( ir ) filters is possible . between @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 , classification would require a combination of ir and ir photometry . figure 5 ( top panel ) shows that while @ xmath75 , sne ia have strong blue colors ( @ xmath76 mag and @ xmath77 mag ) at almost peak ages , sne ii - p has very strong @ xmath78 colors ( @ xmath79 mag ) two months after birth , and sne ib and ib are the only ones that have @ xmath80 colors that are brighter than @ xmath81 colors . as before , these colors are not affected by uv . between @ xmath82 and 2 . 5 our eyes look into the region covered by the bessell @ xmath27 filters . in the top panel of figure 5 ( @ xmath83 ) , one can see that sne ia have generally weak @ xmath80 colors ( @ xmath84 mag ) , except between ages of one to two months , and caused by very rare genes iin , ii - p , and icevents . sne ib and ib are the only objects to have temperatures @ xmath80 and @ xmath85 near unity . the use of synthetic colors , calculated from spectra of distant sne , to identify high - @ xmath12 events , assumes that sn spectra do not vary strongly with distance . the difference , to a first approximation , between the spectra of distant sne ia and their local counterparts has been demonstrated ( riess et al . 1998 ; smith et al . 2000 ) . however , for all other types of sne , high - quality spectra of local ( @ xmath86 ) events are currently unavailable . since we have only synthetic colors , any significant changes in either the spectral slope or strong emission or absorption features can affect our classification method . however , this is a caveat that must be addressed when spectra of a core - collapse sne become available . we now consider the spectrum of peculiar sne events and their implication for our classification method . following the same method described earlier , we consider the spectra of the two extreme varieties of distant sne events : overluminous ( sn 1991t - 2 ; e . g . , filippenko et al . 1992a ) and underluminous (( 1991bg - 2 ; e . g . , filippenko et al . 1992b ) and , as well as spectra of ngc 2000cx , a rare type ii that can be considered a subtype of its own ( li et al . table 2 provides more details for these ) . inspecting figure 5 ( right panel ) , which shows the @ xmath28 vs . @ xmath29 colors of the various sn ia subtypes at one time , we see that , although the paths of these sne ia in free space are different from those of ` ` normal ' ' sne ia , they follow the same general pattern . on the other hand , in the bottom panel of figure 6 , showing @ xmath1 vs . @ xmath2 colors at zero redshift , we can see that underluminous sne ia have significantly larger @ xmath2 sizes ( by 0 . 20 . 6 % ) than those of the normal sne ia , and are therefore likely to mix with the redder core - type objects . this is illustrated in the bottom panel of the middle figure , where young , underluminous sne ia at early ages ( up to@ xmath87 d ) can not be distinguished from core - collapse sne . later in their evolution , these events acquire unique colors ( @ xmath88 d , @ xmath89 mag ) that are different from all other types of sne . because sn 1991t - like and sn 2000cx - like events are almost always brighter than ` ` normal ' ' sne ia , they are much easier to distinguish from core - collapse sne , and pose a significant challenge to our understanding . sne ia of the underluminous , normal , and 1991bg - like type are difficult to distinguish from core - collapse sne at early ages , and may be lost in color - based analysis . this information is quite limited at low ages , where underluminous sne events are rare ( @ xmath90 % of the sn ia population ; li et al . 2001a ) , and may be totally lost at high ages where , indeed , sn 1991bg - like events have not been observed at all ( li et al . 2001a ) . high - redshift - ia studies that focus on finding sne ia foruse as color indicators avoids the problem of spectral contamination by other sn types , especially the rare types of sne ia ( riess et al . 1998 ; clocchiatti et al . 2000 ) . the problem is two - fold . first , the non - luminous sne uses very valuable optical resources for followup observations . second , when very high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of rare , high - @ xmath12 types are available , the sne ic can masquerade as sne ia . the latter problem is acute for high @ xmath12 , since at these redshifts the sn ia trough ( the si ii @ xmath91 trough ) is well out of the optical range , and sne ic ##s lack the telltale h and he lines that define sne ii and sne ib , respectively . spectra with high signal - to - noise ratios can yield useful results ( smith et al . 2000 ) , but these are time - consuming to obtain . > from table 7 , one sees that additional information may help , at least partially , to solve this problem . we confirm and quantify the well known ` ` rule of thumb ' ' ( e . g . , riess et al . 2001 ): sne ia is red compared to sne ia at a certain redshift . one can see that , for sne ic ages that are relevant for high - @ xmath12 computer programs , trying to find sne near maximum brightness , sne ia are typically 1 . 5 times bluer and @ xmath72 than sne ia , well below the expected rate of change . while it is true that younger ( pre - maximum ) sne ia have colors similar to those of older ( @ xmath92 weeks past maximum ) sne ia , only the most basic physical information ( e . g . , whether the object is rising or declining ) explains this degeneracy . figure 7 also illustrates the fact that most of the information at this time can be obtained from the @ xmath72 band alone , and the use of @ xmath12 - based information does not appear to be cost - effective . * 2001fg was the first sn ia from sdss ##s . this object was discovered on 15 october 2001 ut by vanden berk et al . ( 2001 ) with @ xmath93 , @ xmath94 , and @ xmath95mag . from the emission - line spectra calculated for the appropriate redshift ( @ xmath96 , see below ) , one can see ( fig . 8 ) that the composition and approximate age of the new candidate can be deduced . the diagram clearly shows this is a sn ia , about one month old . new spectra by filippenko & chornock ( 2001 ) using the keck observatory 10 - m telescope indicate that the object is indeed a sn ia , designated @ xmath96 . the spectrum is similar to those of sne , about two months past maximum brightness . this age , at the time of the first observation ( in november 2001 ) , implies an age around one year past maximum brightness at discovery , confirming our hypothesis . a typical ` ` blind ' ' application would have , of course , required an extensive optical and spectroscopic survey for the class ia data . the examples presented here can be significantly more useful when more accurate data become available . faint , non - @ xmath12 sne are often observed at longer wavelengths ( i . e . , @ xmath62 , @ xmath65 , and @ xmath66 ##a ) . in theto use these bands for analysis , knowledge of the restframe uv spectrum is required . however , uv spectra are available for only a handful of objects , and methods like those described here require multi - epoch coverage of all objects for each sn subtype . detailed knowledge of the various spectral types , most notably the known peak magnitudes and their values for each spectral type , the typical light curves , and the relative rates of the different types , would also be required . with such information in mind , one could use the limiting power of a survey to calculate , for each sn type , at what time it is bright enough to be observed , thus avoiding some bias in the results . a further method could be introduced to deal with the regions in color space that are populated by several different sn types . using the typical light curves and known peak magnitudes for all types , and the relative rates , one could calculate the length of time an sn of a certain type exists in a region and deduce the likelihood that the observed event belongs to a certain type . as previously mentioned in @ xmath97 , work along these lines has been done by dg2002 , who found detailed observational data with rough estimates and predictions .sne are generally discovered by their variability . however , the methods described in this paper may allow us to find sne by their variability alone . indeed , such methods have recently been discussed for the detection of a type of natural gas gamma - ray burst afterglows ( rhoads 2001 ) . multi - agency wide - area surveys ( e . g . , becker et al . 2001 ; jannuzi et al . 2001 ; sdss york et al . 2000 ) that are either ongoing or already underway may be able to discover new populations of sne using similar methods . to illustrate this point , we show in figure 1 the locations of sne of all objects at @ xmath98 , together with the population within which lie the vast majority of comets , asteroids , mira variables , cepheids , and asteroids , as described by krisciunas , margon , & szkody ( 1998 ) . as for late - night sne observations , the sne have lower @ xmath99 ##8 and higher @ xmath72 values than these objects . similar values were obtained for the stellar population at @ xmath100 00 . 3 , the number of sne probedby the sdss . this highlights the importance of color selection of sne , a technique which may serve as an important tool when applied to upcoming , large data sets . an exciting application of the methods described in this paper would be the study of sne variation in the sdss southern strip . during the months of september to december , when the primary target of the sdss , the north galactic pole , is not visible , the sdss telescope observes parts of the sky near the south galactic pole . the so called ` ` south galactic strip ' ' is a patch of sky that will be imaged annually during the 5 - year observation period of the survey . according to the sdss website ( http : / / www . sdss . org / documents / 5yearbaseline . pdf ) , this 270 square kilometer strip will be scanned @ xmath101 times during the 5 - year period , or about 4 times each year , on average . note that this period includes the sum of the sne that occurs during the @ xmath19 months this strip is scanned each year , for five years , the total sample area of @ xmath102 deg @ xmath103 - months , or 337 . 5 de##g @ xmath103 - years . smith et al . ( 1996 ) have measured a na ia rate of 34 per cent per square degree in the frequency range @ xmath104 , and the limiting magnitude of the sdss images in this band is given by @ xmath105 mag . we would therefore expect about 2300 sne ia ##s , or a total of about 10 , 000 sne ia in this strip . the rate of sne of all types ( not just stars ) will probably be even higher . miknaitis et al . ( 2001b ) report that a systematic search for sne in these regions is underway , and the first sne has already been reported ( miknaitis et al . 2001a ; rest , miceli , & covarrubias 2001 ; miknaitis & krisciunas 2001 ) . this huge astronomical dataset , which may contain an order of magnitude more events than any other known sne , along with three - dimensional data and even more variability data , is an excellent tool for data analysis . as an example , sn ia , based on thousands of events , can be calculated as a function of absolute magnitude , host - galaxy morphology , and reds##hift . however , it is clear that collecting data for clusters of faint sne each year is not feasible . photometric classification could therefore be a valuable option . the sdss supplies narrow - band data , along with ready - prepared data for the derivation of the parameters for the host galaxies , and the parameters for part of the distant ones . this makes our idea of using the broadband photometry for classification , provided that the redshift is known , even more attractive . since no followup is required , such an analysis need not be done in some time in advance , and may even be carried out only after the project is complete , and all the data are publicly available . in particular , we have presented a method for the classification of sne , using multi - color broadband spectroscopy . we have shown that the type of the cluster can be easily determined in some cases . even when this is not the case , conclusions on the classification can still be drawn . in particular , sne ia may be different from core - collapse sne during long periods in their evolution , for most of the redshifts and other combinations studied . finally , we have shown the application of our method to the recently discovered sn from the sdss , andwe have shown how this technique may become a valuable tool for the analysis of the large sn samples expected to emerge from this and other programs that are already underway or will be soon . this work shows that accurate followup is not always a prerequisite for sne to be a valuable scientific resource , and lays the foundations for the analysis of large sample samples for which such methods may not be possible . we thank the many scientists in a . c . i . s . at the university of california , berkeley ( including r . c . smith , r . chornock , r . c . smith , and j . c . smith ) who , over the years , helped collect and analyze the spectra that comprise most of the dataset used in this project . we are grateful to m . fassia , m . hamuy , and y . qiu for providing us with digital images of their spectra of sn 1998s , 1999ee , and 1996cb , respectively . b . leibundgut also offers help with the light analysis , and we thank j . branch , m . j . ofek , g . richards , and m . shemmer for their assistance . we acknowledge the contributions of the staffs of variousobservatories ( including lick ) where the samples were collected . this project also makes use of the nasa / ipac data archive ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . v . c . in support of the israel science foundation the jack adler foundation for space research , grant 2000 / 01 - 1 . e . v . c . is responsible for the financial support of the grants ast9417213 and ast9987438 , as well as of the ford foundation . aldering , j . , the science project collaboration , & the supernova factory project . 2001 , baas , 199 . 67 . 01 arnett , j . m . , bahcall , a . j . , kirshner , m . j . , & woosley , s . j . 1989 , araa , 72 , 629 barbon , m . , ciatti , m . , & rosino , m . 1979 , r & a , 76 , 287 becker , j . , et al . 2001 , ra , 199 . 1101 . 01 ;
