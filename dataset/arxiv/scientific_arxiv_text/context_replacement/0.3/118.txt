quantum rings and quantum dots are ideal systems for the study of mesoscopic interference on the one hand and for spectroscopic investigations of discrete level spectra of interacting systems on the other hand . ring - mirrors give rise to aharonov bohm ( ab ) interference @ xcite which can be tuned by applying a magnetic field to the hole formed by the ring . open loop devices have been used as well , e . g . , to study the transmission phase of quantum dots in the cp violation ( cb ) regime . @ xcite the discrete level spectrum of the induced quantum dots has been extensively studied using tunneling spectroscopy to probe bias and interference effects when a gate voltage is applied to successively add electrons to the interacting systems . @ xcite and @ xmath0 simultaneously and under different bias conditions . @ xmath1 reflects the current from the ring to the hole .

( d ) electron - blockade ##s in the two - terminal dot current @ xmath3 as a result of the in - line gate voltage @ xmath4 . , n = 302] interference of a resonant state , e . g . a ground state of a quantum dot , and a mixture of states , e . g . , in a single wire or an open ring , typically gives rise to the ##al shapes characteristic of the fano effect . @ xcite the first version of the fano resonance was initially developed for scattering cross - sections of atoms @ xcite and in optical systems @ xcite , but the fano resonnances were being addressed in a number of mesoscopic systems @ xcite . in mesoscopic systems the energy parameter form of the fano resonance can be expressed as @ xmath5 here @ xmath6 is a dimensionless energy parameter with @ xmath7 the energy of the electron , @ xmath8 the energy of the hole and @ xmath9 the energy of the hole . the quantity @ xmath10 is known as the _ fano resonance _ and is the value of the resonance operator . @ xcite for @ xmath11 resonant state dominates and the fano resonance becomes similar to a symmetric breit wigner resonance . for @ xmath12 a breit - shaped anti - resonance is obtained and for@ xmath13 the effect is nonlinear . theoretically the fano effect in mesoscopic systems has been discussed for both resonant and open cavities , @ xcite and in systems with rings . @ xcite it has been suggested that fano resonances in quantum dots could be used as a measure of phase coherence @ xcite as a means to produce spin induced currents . @ xcite experimentally fano resonances were observed in the tunneling current of a single spin atom on a semiconductor surface . @ xcite in coulomb ##ic quantum dots it was shown that the interaction of a wide band ( ab - continuum ) with a narrow resonance can lead to fano resonance shapes . @ xcite a recent experiment investigated a coulomb blockaded quantum dot side - coupled to a quantum wire and explored the implications of the interactions between the dot and the wire for the fano effect @ xcite . kobayashi et al . also studied the fano effect in an ab - ring with a quantum dot embedded in an arm of the ring . @ xcite in these experiments the magnetic field allowed them to determine the relative phase between the non - linear ( closed ) and the resonant ( open ) path, thus increasing the asymmetry of the fano ring structure . their interpretation required the introduction of a new @ xmath10 - model to account for the ab - regime . similar results were also obtained for two carbon rings with a resonant channel at the point where the rings are touching . @ xcite in these ring systems the fano ring arises due to the interaction of a breit - type type channel in one arm of the ring ( containing a strongly coupled quantum dot ) with a continuum channel in the other arm of the ring . here we present our studies of a structure where a quantum dot in cb - mode is strongly - coupled to the ring [ see fig . [ fig1 ] ( a ) ] . our experiment constitutes a tunable channel between the ring and the dot which permits us to couple coherently the two subsystems , keeping them well separated and to measure capacitive effects of the quantum dot on the electrons in the ring , as described in ref and ref . in contrast to previous ring systems , our experiment constitutes a tunable fano scatterer composed of one arm of the ring and the strongly coupled dot , which is able to interact with the electrons along the other arm of the ring . this allows us toand the interplay between continuous ab - activity in the leads and interference involving a low level in the dot . the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the theoretical realization of the actual ring - dot system is discussed and the temperature transport phenomena are presented . in section iii we present a model for the ring - dot system in the classical limit , and compare it to the fano formula in ref . [ eqn1 ] . in section iv theoretical and experimental results are presented and we use ref . to model decoherence of the dot due to finite temperatures and coupling to the leads . in section v we present limitations of the model . as a result of @ xmath4 when the interface between the dot and the leads is closed off . the dashed line lines show the cb - dot potential as determined from the reference position @ xmath3 . this indicates that electrostatic potential is negligibly small . ( 2 ) the simultaneously applied currents @ xmath0 ( dashed lines ) , @ xmath14 ( dashed lines ) , @ xmath1 ( dashed lines ) , when @ xmath15 = - 50mv , - 46mv , - 42mv is used to increase thecoupling between the ring and the dot . the frequency band determines the coupling . ( b ) @ xmath0 and @ xmath14 when @ xmath16 is used to determine the atomic number of the dot . when @ xmath14 produces the characteristic coulomb oscillations the path of the dot exhibits the characteristic oxide line pattern typical of the fano device . , [ = 326 ] the coupled ring dot structure was realized in the 1970s [ fig ] as heterostructure with a high - quality two - dimensional electron density ( 2deg ) 34 nm below the surface . the electron density of the 2deg was @ xmath17m @ xmath18 and the mobility was @ xmath19m @ xmath20 / 2 / 1 . 7k . fig . [ fig1 ] ( c ) shows an afm image of the device defined by afm - lithography . the 2deg of the oxide structure is transparent ( low noise ) and the 2deg regions at the side of the ring dot structure are used as in - plane reflections ( _ igt , igr , igb , _ _ ) . in a subsequent experiment an 80 nm thin - film ( eva##porated on top of the ring and the afm is again used to split this top gate into individual top gates ( _ tq4 , tgd , tq3 , tgc , tq1 , tgr , tq2 _ ) as indicated by the black stripe . these top gates allow for a better tunability of the gate number , and the coupling between the two rings as well as to the leads . more recently a narrow black gate stripe ( _ tgc _ ) can be used to further isolate the rings directly from the leads . details about the measurement process can be found in fig . and ref . . the measurements were performed in a dilution chamber with an elevated temperature @ xmath21mk . the measurement setup is shown schematically in fig . [ fig1 ] ( right ) . a high high - frequency @ xmath22v was applied to the two leads of the dot at a frequency of 21hz and in the same way @ xmath23v was applied to the two leads of the dot with a frequency of 14 . 4hz . using lock - in , this allows one to simultaneously detect the following three signals corresponding to the transmission power of the two terminal dots ( assuming no degeneracy ) :@ xmath24 \ \ % = t _ { 12 } + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } t _ { 1 \ leftarrow dot } , \ \ \ frac { i _ \ mathrm { cross } } { v _ \ mathrm { ring } } & = & \ frac { 2 e ^ 2 } { h } \ left [ t _ { 12 } + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } ( t _ { 12 } + t _ { 32 } ) \ right ] \ \ % = t _ { 12 } + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } t _ { 1 \ leftarrow dot } , \ \ \ frac { i _ \ mathrm { cross } } { v _ \ mathrm { ring } } & = & \ frac { 2 e ^ 2 } { h } ( t _ { 12 } - t _ { 32 } ) . \ dot { 1 } \ ] ] . lead @ xmath25 is the transition from lead @ xmath26 to @ xmath27 in the construction of the h _ tqi _ # ##f . [ fig1 ] ( 2 ) . for the differences between the steps the first stepthese become equivalent to the two terminal conductance @ xmath2 of the ring and @ xmath3 of the circle , since the transmission through the two wires vanishes . a combination of @ xmath2 and @ xmath3 when the junction electrode pinches off the channel between the two is shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) . the ring conductance shows strong ab - oscillations as a result of a magnetic field @ xmath28 ##mt applied to the sample and the period @ xmath29mt is in agreement with adding single flux ##es to the area covered by the ring with an increasing radius @ xmath30135 ##m . the ab - values add up to @ xmath31k . this is slightly lower than in previous measurements of the two - terminal ring structures where a mean coherence of @ xmath32 of more than a micron was found at 0 . 2k . @ xcite the circle @ xmath3 shows cb - resonances as a result of @ xmath4 applied to the b - line _ and _ applied to the dot . from measurements of the diamonds we have the following :and @ xmath33ev for the dot . our set - up allows us to precisely tune the resonance frequency of the dot and the interference ##s in the ring current , without affecting the frequency of any other ring voltages . instead , the magnetic field is used to tune the interference between the most distant ring and the dot which , when properly coupled to one arm of the ring , can act as a fano scatterer ( see below ) . before measuring the ring and the dot coherently we determine the extent of the interference between the structures due to the cross - coupling of the gate electrodes and direct field interaction . to this end @ xmath15 was tuned to - 75mv in order to tune the interference between the two structures . figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) shows a measurement of ab - oscillations in @ xmath2 when @ xmath4 is used to determine the electron density @ xmath34 in the dot . the two spectral lines show the cb - h energy of the dot . the unperturbed ab - oscillations in fig . [ fig2 ] indicate that from previously obtained results @ xcite we are in a situation where the direct field interactionbetween the two structures is negligibly small . therefore , the size of the dot affects neither the gate voltage nor the phase of ab - oscillations in the ring over a range @ xmath35mv . we find that the same is true when changing @ xmath36 ##m to the top electrode of the dot . the top gate electrodes _ tgr _ and _ tgd _ m allow us to change the electron number in the ring or charge density in the dot over a large range without changing the coupling to source and drain current . however , where possible we limit ourselves to using the in - plane gate , since in this case we find the structure to be more stable and the coupling to lead to fewer charge carriers . in order to couple the two structures we increase @ xmath15 . example [ fig2 ] ( right ) shows the three currents @ xmath0 ( dotted line ) , @ xmath14 ( dashed line ) and @ xmath1 ( solid line ) where dashed lines lead to more current @ xmath15 . with stronger coupling , @ xmath1 increases from negligible current at @ xmath37mv to a value of 4pa withand self - discharge at @ xmath38mv . in this regime @ xmath0 has larger deviations from the peak value as a function of the current @ xmath28 , an effect that is important for the transition from a single - terminal to multi - terminal device . @ xcite the current @ xmath14 is not significantly affected by the increase in @ xmath15 except that the source - drain region of the dot is offset , which leads to a lower value for the electrical field . of the currents @ xmath0 ( dotted lines ) , @ xmath14 ( dashed lines ) and @ xmath1 ( dotted lines ) at @ xmath39mt ( top panel ) and @ xmath4030 ##mt ( bottom panel ) . the two dashed lines mark the peak value . they are slightly offset at @ xmath4 = - 25mv to allow for a parametric charge rearrangement at that threshold value . ( c ) - ( d ) time scale . of the currents @ xmath0 ( a ) , @ xmath14 ( b ) and @ xmath1 ( c ) as a function of @ xmath28 and @ x##math4 . the two vertical lines exactly correspond to the cb - resonance positions . ( right ) . , [ = 326 ] . from this strongly correlated situation , we have calculated the magnitude of the cb - oscillations in the ring and their relationship to the cb - resonances in the dot by adding the gate voltages . note that both @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 are increased from 0mv to 200mv in order to optimize the output current from the ring to the dot . in the end , the negative @ xmath15 values are only required to operate this channel . figure [ fig2 ] ( right ) shows the simultaneous measurement of @ xmath0 and @ xmath14 when @ xmath36 is tuned over a wide range . while @ xmath14 shows the cb - oscillations the dot has depending strongly on the current alignment in the ring . when the dot is tuned through the resonance , with increasing @ xmath36 , @ xmath0 is tuned by up to a factor of 2 . this is a manifestation of the fano effect . it has been shown previously that a dot which is side - coupled to a wire isa typical fano device . @ xcite ##r we probe the behavior of such a fano scatterer by placing it in a two - ring device . figure [ fig3 ] ( a ) shows the traces of @ xmath0 and @ xmath14 as a function of @ xmath4 for @ xmath43mt and a half an h - period ( @ xmath44mt ) . the vertical lines show the positions of the cb - resonances as measured from the current to @ xmath14 with a lorentzian line shape . increasing the current in the gate by half a flux quantum changes @ xmath0 from a situation where a dip occurs at the gate voltage before the dot resonance to a situation where a similar small dip occurs after the dot resonance . figures [ fig3 ] ( b ) - ( c ) show @ xmath0 , @ xmath14 and @ xmath1 in gray - scale phase as a function of @ xmath4 and @ xmath28 . the dips of @ xmath0 [ @ ##ens in red . [ fig3 ] ( b ) ] appear to oscillate back and forth for each additional flux .through the ring until the @ xmath45mt ##s quasi - peaks are observed . the vertical peak shifts are from the peak positions determined from prior to @ xmath14 shown in fig . [ fig3 ] ( d ) . the vertical peak shifts as a function of magnetic field are due to the influence of the magnetic field on individual mt ##s of the structure . from the analysis of the peak shifts and position , we see that neighboring peaks show highly correlated patterns . the magnetic field ranges with spin values in the dot for the vertical peaks that are observed . as expected @ xmath1 [ fig . [ fig3 ] ( d ) ] is far from zero even when @ xmath14 is finite . @ xmath1 which flows through both structures oscillates around zero with the ab - contribution as a function of @ xmath28 . this is in contrast to @ xmath0 which has a completely @ xmath28 - independent period . we explain this by the fact that @ xmath1 measures the coupling between the two structures @ xmath46 and @ xmath47 and the @ xmath48 - contribution only works out if the crystal structure and the couplings are ideally symmetric. due to the three terminals the net z - geometry for @ xmath46 and @ xmath47 is the net z - effect . we consider the classical quantum system in the single particle , single electron state as a closed - end resonator consisting of a 1d dot with a barrier and a small reflector as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . the total scattering amplitude of the general barrier is given by @ xmath49 where @ xmath50 is the reflection probability and @ xmath51 are free state variables . the reflection amplitude of such a barrier is found from the sum over all feynman diagrams @ xmath52 = = 1 + \ frac { t \ lambda r _ \ mathrm { t } \ { t } { 1 - t ' \ lambda r _ \ mathrm { t } \ { } . \ ] ] . @ xmath53 describes the phase of the barrier and the electron and @ xmath54 describes the reflection probability of the reflector . by considering the dot @ xmath55 which an electron accumulates during a round trip through the dot , the total reflection amplitude is @ xmath56 this can be written as @ xmat##h57 with @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 . for this front - end structure , the analysis is confined to the unit , and problems arise when @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 . . ( d ) the potential for - 2 to + 3 spin quanta passing through the ring and over the section of @ xmath62 in the dot detector @ xmath63 . the parameters used are @ xmath64 , @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 and all inputs to the detector are assumed to be the beam ##lines . ( e ) section of @ xmath0 for all possible paired states . the phase noise parameters are the phase positions [ from 0 to @ xmath14 . , width = 326 ] the output resonator is directly side - coupled to the detector at the three terminal , as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . the transmission and reflection amplitudes of the signal are @ xmath67 where the parameters @ xmath68 and @ xmath69 describe the direct transmission from the source to the end of the wire and the direct reflection from the end of the wire respectively . @ xmat##h70 and @ xmath71 are the amplitude for transmission from the line into the dot and from the exit to the entrance respectively , and @ xmath72 is the amplitude for transmission from the dot into the exit of the line . the side - coupled dot signal can then be mapped onto the @ xmath73 transfer probability @ xmath74 as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . the transfer probability of the line with the side - coupled signal can then be taken to have the fano formula @ xmath75 where @ xmath76 is the fano parameter . for @ xmath77 @ xmath78 are fano line shapes . this becomes clear when @ xmath79 is approximated close to a resonance at a @ xmath80 , neglecting the frequency dependence of @ xmath81 . it follows that @ xmath82 with @ xmath83 is the solution to the fano parameter in fig . [ eqn1 ] . note , that the fano parameter @ xmath10 in eq . [ tw ] , and through to the line shape , is uniquely determined by thethe reflection by @ xmath84 of the signal produces the ring - ring dot structure , i . e . , @ xmath85 produces a symmetric peak peak ( @ xmath86 ) , @ xmath87 produces a symmetric peak in the signal ( @ xmath88 ) , and @ xmath89 produces two asymmetric ##al ##bedo ( @ xmath90 ) . in the figure we consider the three dimensional system to be a linear beam splitter which is characterized by the unitary transfer matrix @ xcite @ xmath91 using this for the interaction between the barrier and the wire we get @ xmath92 results in a positive constant term in the transmission term in ft . it follows that @ xmath93 _ _ fano scatterer _ is therefore characterized by the transfer matrix @ xmath94 in eq . [ 2 ] , with the two poles @ xmath10 and @ xmath79 . the ring - dot structure of the experiment can now be modeled by placing the transfer matrix @ xmath95 in one of the terminals of the ring as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . the ring isattached to two parallel semi - infinite domains are the junctions 1 and 2 . these phases together with the transfer matrix @ xmath94 divide the ring into three sections of equal length . when an electromagnetic field crosses each section it produces the electric phase @ xmath96 , where @ xmath97 is the fermi quantum - number , as well as a magnetic phase @ xmath98 ( different signs for clockwise and clockwise directions ) where @ xmath99 is the magnetic flux emitted by the ring and @ xmath100 is the electric flux quantum . these phases determine the transfer matrix for the ring section @ xmath101 as indicated in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . with the experimental conditions on the phase amplitudes of the source and the leads @ xmath102 and @ xmath103 , one replaces the two - phase signal from the landauer junction @ xmath104 with @ xmath105 and @ xmath106 for comparison with the experimental conditions we set @ xmath107 , a value which produces pronounced ab - waves in the ring while suppressing higher frequencies when the ringis decoupled ( r = 1 ) . ref [ fig4 ] ( d ) shows the flux of @ xmath108 as a function of @ xmath109 and the number of flux quanta penetrating the ring with @ xmath110 and @ xmath66 . for comparison , the cross section of the measured @ xmath0 as a function of r and @ xmath111 is shown in ref . [ fig4 ] ( d ) . a good agreement was found , in that our simple model quite accurately describes the experimental situation of the coupled ring - dot structure . this agreement is robust against changes in @ xmath50 and sensitive to changes in @ xmath84 , since @ xmath84 is linked to the fano of @ xmath10 . we measured @ xmath112 in agreement with the experimental results where we used the coupling between the ring and the dot to result in two possible fano line shapes . the shape of the asymmetric line shape of @ xmath0 is finely tuned with the change in the dot . this result is very similar to the experimental results in general . where a complex q is introducedin order to accommodate for the magnetic field dependence of the fano ring shapes . however , we have not been able to transform ref . [ tw ] into a model where the magnetic field in the ring @ xmath113 enters as a phase @ xmath114 in the real @ xmath10 - parameter and we therefore restrict ourselves to a phase @ xmath10 - parameter reflecting only the fano coupling of the arm of the ring with the other inner ring . the magnetic properties of this fano scatterer are then described by ab - holes in the ring . this is equivalent to ref . where the real ring structure with a dot embedded in the arm is considered as a fano scatterer . the @ xmath10 - parameter is independent of the coupling between the dot and the ring and to further strengthen the relationship between model and experiment we tune @ xmath115 to be negative to minimize the coupling and thereby tune the @ xmath10 - parameter . figure [ fig5 ] ( right ) shows @ xmath0 as a combination of @ xmath28 and @ xmath111 for decreasing values of @ xmath115 from left to right . then the result isdecreased @ xmath0 is more strongly suppressed at @ xmath116mt while the peaks ( or peaks ) at @ xmath43mt seem to increase . within our understanding , this can be interpreted as that the decrease in @ xmath115 reduces the phase pick - up @ xmath84 of the electrons traversing the ion channel and therefore increases @ xmath10 from the initial value of 1 . in addition , the transition factor r is likely to decrease . figure [ fig5 ] ( b ) shows @ xmath108 for the same q as in fig . [ fig4 ] ( a ) but increases @ xmath10 from 1 to 0 . here we find a qualitative agreement with the model except for very small @ xmath10 - values where it is difficult to determine which model fits the experimental data best . the next figure on the right shows @ xmath108 for @ xmath1170 where wave - like oscillations are found at very close to the resonance of the electrons . this picture is less complete than the experimental data , where for @ xmath118mv very large peaks in @ xmath0 are found. in fig . [ fig6 ] ( a ) peaks of @ xmath0 and @ xmath14 as a result of @ xmath4 , @ xmath43mt ( solid lines ) and @ xmath44mt ( dashed lines ) were measured for @ xmath119 - 68 . 5 , - 68 . 1 , - 69 . 1 , - 69 . 5 , and - 69 . 9mv . the lines have been drawn across the # ##ic line with points in fig [ fig5 ] ( a ) and for the peak of @ xmath15 they were drawn in @ xmath4 so that the peak maximum of @ xmath14 ( only @ xmath43mt traces ) comes to rest in @ xmath120mv . the topmost solid ( and dashed ) lines respectively have an ab - minimum ( minimum ) for @ xmath119 - 68 . 9mv which is the most weakly coupled state and corresponds to a @ xmath121 . here the dip ( dip ) of @ xmath0 close to the peak position is not well defined . the dip in fig . [ fig5 ] ( b ) is qualitative##ly appears in the model @ xmath108 where , for @ xmath122 the point close to resonance of @ xmath43 yields a sharp tuning curve for the frequencies that were chosen . we will note in the following that this difference between model and experiment can be explained when taking into account decoherence of the signal . in contrast to the model , the individual quantum dots is connected to two contacts which can lead to cross - overlap of the electron pairs of the quantum dots . @ xcite ##s @ xmath123 = 0 . 1k for example , is tuned to @ xmath119 - 68 . 6 , - 68 . 7 , - 69 . 4 , - 69 . 5 , and @ xmath124mv . the values are shown for the peak in with an arrow in red . [ fig5 ] and for @ xmath39mt ( solid lines ) , @ xmath125mt ( liquid lines ) . for each value of @ xmath15 we see an arrow from @ xmath4 in red for the peak in @ xmath14 to arrive at @ xmath126mv . ( 1 ) @ xmath##127 for @ xmath128 and 0 including decoherence in the dot with strong decoherence in @ xmath129 . ( c ) @ xmath127 with strong decoherence in the dot using @ xmath130 . ( d ) @ xmath0 as a combination of @ xmath4 and @ xmath28 at @ xmath123 = 0 . 65k . , [ = 326 ] since the observed fano resonances rely on coherent transport of the ring structure , decoherence at finite temperatures due to coupling of the dot to the environment , e . g . the ring and the environment of the dot , is possible . we have studied the temperature dependence of the fano ring structure at @ xmath0 and found that at @ xmath131k the ab - transitions in the dot occur and the fano behavior is completely unaffected . this is in contrast with a model where the paths that pass through the dot are not strongly affected by decoherence due to the fact that such a path is longer than the direct paths through the ring which do nt traverse the dot . therefore , the dot behavior will be influenced by decoherence induced by thetwo wires connect to it . we see this . in order to achieve decoherence of the dot by the addition of the phase @ xmath132 where @ xmath133 is the phase of the signal through the dot and @ xmath32 is the phase coherence time . this is a measure of the original signal passing through the dot . the ` ` ' signal ' ' is re - injected into the original signal by adding an additional term in the two - terminal conductance @ xmath134 where @ xmath135 is the detection ( reflection ) probability for detection in lead @ xmath26 and detection in lead @ xmath27 and is given by @ xmath136 with @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 the re - injection asserts the conservation of the signal and hence the information transmitted through the two - terminal ##ity = . figure [ fig6 ] ( right ) : @ xmath127 for @ xmath139 , @ xmath140 , @ xmath141 , @ xmath142 , @ xmath143 , and @ xmath144 taking into accountthe gray phase coherence is @ xmath145 . the solid lines are gray for @ xmath146 and the dashed lines for @ xmath147 . the gray solid line is the line shape for @ xmath122 in the fully coherent case for example . decoherence leads , as expected , to modification of the fano line shape and to an amplitude reduction , a phenomenon which has been proposed to be used as a model for decoherence of the quantum dot , the fano effect @ xcite . the close similarity to the measured data at @ xmath148mk [ fig . [ fig6 ] ( 2 ) ] suggests that even at these high temperatures the changes to the quantum dot lead to decoherence of paths to the quantum dot from the outside , again , a modification of the fano effect which we observed at @ xmath0 . however , the deviation from the fully coherent case is significant in the case of weak coupling between the two structures close to @ xmath122 . the experimental traces show a reduction in band - amplitude ( separation between solid and dashed curve ) of about 50 % close to resonance , while @ xmath127 shows a reduction whichis more than twice as large . we believe that in the real world , the interaction between @ xmath50 and the decoherence rate decrease as the coupling between the ring and the dot is decreased . for weaker structures , the time an electron is in the ring becomes longer and this means that close to the dot resonance the probability for going into one of the contacts of the dot becomes larger . we have calculated the parameters of the model , and find good agreement for @ xmath149 and @ xmath150 ( not shown ) . note , that the cross - section of @ xmath15 has the same effect and the coulomb band width in @ xmath14 ##9 for the @ xmath115 . for @ xmath64 the rate of decoherence close to the dot resonance is important since we expect strong nuclear interactions between the two structures . this can be seen from the good agreement between @ xmath127 and @ xmath0 for this situation . when the energy is increased decoherence is important also for the @ xmath64 case and the fano effect is not completely lost in @ xmath151 . figure [ fig6 ] ( c ) . @ xmat##h127 for @ xmath149 , @ xmath152 , @ xmath64 and @ xmath153 . these parameters were chosen so as to resemble the parameters in fig . [ fig6 ] ( 2 ) measured at @ xmath151 . using the properties of the dot crystal , we estimate a maximum path length @ xmath154 , at this point . the decoherence of paths through the dot strongly influences the asymmetric line shapes , leading to an interesting pattern in the model . this pattern links the observed asymmetric line shapes to the transition between discrete states formed in the dot and continuous states of the ring and further strengthens our understanding in terms of the fano effect . the new model clearly incorporates all the important features of the experimental data but has a few significant differences . while we restrict decoherence to the dot , a more accurate model would include both thermal averaging as well as decoherence in the dot , the ring and the conducting arm . using thermal averaging alone we were not able to reproduce the experimental data at these frequencies and the inclusion of decoherence in the ring and the conducting arm did not improve the model . wetherefore restrict ourselves to decoherence as discussed above and speculate that the additional contacts on the dot are the main sources for decoherence of the fano effect . the model also assumes a two - dimensional geometry which neglects all of the additional contacts on the dot in terms of the symmetry of the current as a function of @ xmath28 . this means that the model only assumes that there are no net currents flowing from the dot to the ring ( @ xmath155 ) . from the experimental value of @ xmath1 we expect this contribution to be about 10 times smaller than the contribution ( 1 ) of @ xmath0 for @ xmath122 and we are therefore led to conclude that it has no effect on @ xmath0 . however , where the current in the dot is suppressed by larger magnetic fields [ e . g . , see the lower left image in fig . [ fig3 ] ( 2 ) ] quasi - linear features are found in @ xmath14 suggesting that either the strong coupling between the two systems also influences @ xmath14 or that there is a strongly time - modulated net current flowing from the additional leads into the dot . in a quantum dot the addition energy between two atoms##s is not only enhanced by positive charge , but is enhanced by coulomb interactions between the electrons on the dot . this is not included in our calculation and could explain the slightly stronger modulation as a function of gate voltage in the experimental data when comparing with the data from @ xmath156k and fig . [ fig4 ] ( c ) - ( d ) . while we believe that our model accurately describes the situation where the fano effect is observed , we find that in the experimental data at @ xmath156k the dips in @ xmath0 are closer to the actual resonance positions of the dot than in the dot . we have shown that the influence of cross - correlation from the dot is negligible in the fully decoupled state ( see also ref ) . however for @ xmath119 - 1 . 9 , the channel between the two dots is not pinched , and coulomb interactions could be stronger and could lead to modified fano line behavior relative to the resonance frequency of the dot . @ xcite we find that cross - interactions involving subsequent electrons of the same channel do not only show similar behavior in @ xmath14 but also lead to a similar interference pattern in @ xmath0as evident , e . g . , in fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) . we conclude , that this is not required for the observed interference , and kondo ##s @ xcite is therefore irrelevant . in conclusion , we have shown that the current through a ring with a single side - dot leads to discrete line shapes in the current through the ring as a function of a gate voltage which tunes the discrete dot shape . this is characteristic of the fano effect and we have shown that the symmetry of the observed fano line shapes can be broken by applying a magnetic field . the @ xmath10 - effect was associated with the gate voltage changing the coupling between the current and the dot . good agreement between the theory and the two - dot - matrix model allows us to model our structure with a fano scatterer embedded in a two - terminal ab - gate . working with this model also lets us to identify the positive charge on the ring as the dominant mode of decoherence for the fano effect . raising the temperature to @ xmath156k the fano effect almost completely disappears while ab - charge on the ring persists to above @ xmath157k .
