we solve the problem to find solutions of _ non - negative _ real - valued heun equations that have monodromy eigenfunctions . our solution is motivated by applications to nonlinear equations modeling the josephson effect of interest . the main results , their existence and uniqueness ( for [ com ] and [ com = 0 ] ) are stated in section 1 . 1 . applications to monodromy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of homogeneous ##ly confluent heun equations and to nonlinear equations modeling josephson effect are stated in section 2 . 1 , sections 4 and 5 . the eigenfunction is the product of a monomial @ xmath13 and a function @ xmath14 holomorphic on @ xmath15 . the heun equation is related to recurrence relations on the laurent series of the function @ xmath16 . the proof of the above - mentioned results is based on studying the latter two relations . we have existence and existence of [ cons ] for converging solutions of a more general class of recurrence relations ( stated in section 1 . 1 and proved in section 2 ) . itsproof is based on results from algebraic geometry and a fixed mathematical argument for the differential operator . we consider the set of all confluent heun equations @ xmath17 @ xmath18 our goal is to find all of the eigenfunctions with a given index @ xmath19 , @ xmath5 : solutions of the equations @ xmath20 to do this , we study the non - homogeneous functions of interest @ xmath21 one of our main results is the following : [ 1 ] for every @ xmath22 , @ xmath23 there exist holomorphic functions @ xmath24 in a neighborhood of zero , @ xmath25 such that the functions @ xmath26 satisfy equations ( [ nonhom ] ) for every @ xmath27 , @ xmath28 . the functions @ xmath29 are unique up to constant factor ( depending on the parameters ) , and they are homogeneous functions : holomorphic functions @ xmath30 . for every given index @ xmath31 the corresponding function @ xmath32 is uniquely defined up to inner product depending on parameters . the corresponding constant factor can be chosen so thatboth @ xmath29 and @ xmath33 depend holomorphically . @ xmath22 and @ xmath24 for real - valued and @ xmath34 for complex - valued . [ x ] = @ xmath22 . the corresponding equation ( [ heun ] ) has a monodromy eigenfunction with eigenvalue @ xmath19 , @ xmath5 , if and only if the basis functions @ xmath35 are proportional : @ xmath36 . [ noncom ] will be proved in the next section and section 3 . the corollary will be proved in the next section . the explicit form for the functions @ xmath29 and @ xmath33 , together with the explicit form for the ( [ schivka ] ) will be proved in section 4 . [ xi = 0 ] for both @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 there is a basis function @ xmath39 ( up to # ##s ) holomorphic in a neighborhood of zero such that @ xmath40 . the basis function @ xmath41 depends only on the parameters @ xmath42 . theorem [ xi = 0] can be found in the next subsection . theorem [ xi = 0 ] is closely related to the question of the existence of a solution holomorphic at 0 of function ( [ heun ] ) ( such a solution is automatically unique , i . e . , holomorphic on @ xmath30 ) . this question was studied by v . m . buchstaber and s . i . tertychnyi in @ xcite . the existence of the solution @ xmath43 from theorem [ xi = 0 ] and the solutions for @ xmath43 and the corresponding function @ xmath44 ( not in @ xmath38 ) were studied in @ xcite . the existence conjecture says that if @ xmath45 , then the corresponding function ( [ heun ] ) , i . e . , @ xmath0 has a solution holomorphic on @ xmath30 . the conjecture studied by v . m . buchstaber and s . i . tertychnyi in loc . cit . states that the following is true : if if @ xmath46 has a holomorphic solution at 0 , then @ xmath45 . this conjecture isand @ loc . cit and @ xcite , where it was related to a set of conjectures on the existence of modified heun equations and modified elliptic functions of the first kind . all these problems were solved in @ xcite . like the first corollary above , theorem [ xi = 0 ] proved the theorem of buchstaber and tertychnyi , , without using modified polynomial equations , nor modified bessel functions . [ cxi ] ( * ? ? ? * , 3 . 3 ) equation ( [ heun ] ) has an entire solution , if and only if @ xmath45 , where @ xmath44 is the function from loc . cit . , as in ( * ? ? ? * , ( 2 ) , p . 337 ) ; see also formula ( [ xil ] ) in section 3 . 2 below . let @ xmath45 . then the solution @ xmath43 from theorem [ xi = 0 ] is the entire solution of equation ( [ heun ] ) : @ xmath0 . conversely , let equation ( [ heun ] ) have a solution @ xmath43 holomorphic to 0 . if @ xmath47 , thenthere exists a holomorphic function @ xmath48 on a subset of x satisfying the equation @ xmath49 , by theorem [ xi = 0 ] . this contradiction with the additional property of theorem [ xi = 0 ] shows that @ xmath50 tends to # ##s , for @ xmath51 . the contradiction thus also gives the corollary . equation ( [ heun ] ) is equivalent to the previous equation @ xmath52 which can be written in the matrix form @ xmath53 @ xmath54 [ remnoncom ] a function @ xmath55 has coefficients ( [ nonhom ] ) for all @ xmath56 , if and only if its taylor series @ xmath57 satisfy ( [ min ] ) , or equivalently , ( [ mat1 ] ) for @ xmath58 . similarly , a function @ xmath59 , @ xmath60 satisfies ( [ nonhom ] ) , if and only if its coefficients satisfy ( [ min ] ) for @ xmath61 . * of corollary [ cordon ] . * let @ xmath62 be the solution of equation ( [ min##un ] ) having coefficients ( [ multi ] ) . then @ xmath63 the coefficients @ xmath57 and ( [ multi ] ) for all @ xmath64 . this together with the above expression implies that the coefficients @ xmath26 satisfy ( [ nonhom ] ) . the above expression @ xmath65 should cancel out , since @ xmath43 is a solution of the above equation . this implies ( [ schivka ] ) . now , let @ xmath26 be one of ( [ nonhom ] ) , and let ( [ schivka ] ) hold . then we can normalize the two solutions by some factors ( not all , ##s ) so that @ xmath66 . then the function @ xmath43 given by ( [ defef ] ) is a polynomial of type ( [ heun ] ) . this proves the corollary . as it is stated above , theorem [ con ] is proved by the more general theorem [ cons ] consider recurrence ##s @ xmath67 = 0 ##s @ xmath57 , where the @ xmath68 given by @ xmath69 satisfy the following conditions : @xmath70 @ xmath71 . there is a unique sequence @ xmath72 with @ xmath57 satisfying ( [ rec ] ) for @ xmath73 and has a finite length . it converges to all of @ xmath30 . theorem [ cons ] will be stated in the next section . [ run ] in the sequence @ xmath74 from theorem [ rec ] for every @ xmath75 the two neighbor coefficients @ xmath57 , @ xmath76 do not vanish either : instead , they present the sequence @ xmath77 . every pair of neighbor coefficients @ xmath78 determines a unique series satisfying ( [ rec ] ) . these statements follow from the fact that for every @ xmath73 the sequence @ xmath79 is defined as a linear combination of @ xmath80 and @ xmath57 by ( [ rec ] ) , since @ xmath81 . furthermore , if some two neighbor coefficients @ xmath82 vanish , then all the others vanish , and the sequence is infinite , by contradiction . [ conv ] in @ xmath83 , since for every@ xmath84 such that @ xmath85 for every @ xmath86 , @ xmath87 there exists and unique nonzero one - sided series @ xmath88 ( up to positive constant ) converge on some punctured disk centered at 0 that satisfy the relations ( [ recur ] ) ( or equivalently , ( [ mat1 ] ) ) for @ xmath89 . similarly , for every @ xmath84 such that @ xmath90 there exists and unique one - sided series @ xmath91 ( up to positive constant ) that satisfies the relations ( [ k ] ) for @ xmath92 and lies outside the disk centered at 0 . both statements converge on the some empty disk of @ xmath15 . [ exkko ] . in the conditions of the [ conv ] one of @ xmath93 ( cf . ( [ defu ] ) ) . then both statements hold for all @ xmath84 , since and ( [ kko ] ) hold for all @ xmath94 . similarly , if either@ xmath95 , let @ xmath96 , and the statement of theorem [ conv ] @ xmath97 @ xmath98 prove [ conv ] together with example [ remnoncom ] and the corresponding statement of example [ exkko ] proves theorem [ com ] . * of theorem [ conv ] and [ com ] . * the statements @ xmath99 of the relation ( [ com ] ) satisfy the statement of theorem [ com ] for @ xmath100 ( @ xmath92 ) . thus , the asymptotics ( [ condi ] ) are proved . let @ xmath81 prove from ( [ kko ] ) ( or , ( [ kko2 ] ) ) . this together with theorem [ com ] proves theorem [ conv ] , and finally , theorem [ com ] . * of theorem [ com = x ] . * let @ xmath101 , @ xmath37 . let ( [ kko ] ) prove for @ xmath102 . moreover , there is a similar proof @ xmath103 based .the neighborhood of the origin , whose relations are ( [ recur ] ) for @ xmath73 , and which depend on solutions of @ xmath30 ( or [ conv ] ) . the convergence of relations ( [ rec ] ) for @ xmath73 is equivalent to the fact that @ xmath104 . this is simply [ x = 0 ] . our results are motivated by contributions to the theory @ xmath105 of nonlinear equations , which arises in many areas of physics , chemistry and engineering : for the model of the josephson effect in superconductivity ( our main application ) , see @ xcite ; in chemistry , see @ xcite . where @ xmath106 is a fixed constant , and @ xmath107 are the solutions . for @ xmath108 the variable of @ xmath109 transforms ( [ josbeg ] ) to a non - linear ordinary differential equation . the two - torus @ xmath110 with solutions @ xmath111 : @ xmath112 the orbits of the solutions are the points of the vector fields @ xmath113 on @ xmath114 . the_ rotation number _ of the flow , see @ xcite , is a function @ xmath115 of parameters . it is given by the equation @ xmath116 where @ xmath117 is an arbitrary solution of equation ( [ jostor ] ) . the _ phase - lock areas _ are the level values of the rotation number in the @ xmath107 - system with non - linear domains . they have been studied by v . m . buchstaber , v . a . karpov , s . i . tertychnyi et al , see @ xcite and discussed below . each phase - lock area is an infinite set of linear domains separated by _ adjacency points _ . the use of their properties for solution of analytic functional equations was first introduced by v . m . bushstaber and s . i . tertychnyi in @ xcite and proved by the authors of the present paper in @ xcite . namely , the family of non - linear equations was reduced in @ xcite to two families of second order analytic functional equations of the _ heun type : equation ( [ heun ] ) and the equation @ xmath11##8 the latter result is obtained by defining equation ( [ heun ] ) in terms of the function @ xmath119 and changing sign to @ xmath120 . in the example , when @ xmath121 , buchstaber and tertychnyi have shown that the parameters correspond exactly to those parameter values , for which equation ( [ heun ] ) has a non - trivial holomorphic solution at infinity ( which is automatically an entire solution : holomorphic solution @ xmath30 ) ; see the discussion in ( * ? ? ? * , theorem 2 ) and the proof in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3 . 1 and theorem 3 . 2 ) . they have also found a system of holomorphic solutions for parameters of an explicit functional equation @ xmath122 , with corollary [ cxi ] . they have conjectured that the explicit functional equation describes the system exactly . they have reduced this conjecture to another one saying that if equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) has a complete solution , then equation ( [ heun ] ) does not have an entire solution . and they have reduced their original conjecture for polynomial solutions to the followingby showing that the equations given by the objective function of the first kind do not depend on the same semiaxis . the above result together with the other results were proved in @ xcite . the above - mentioned result of buchstaber and tertychnyi on the equations describing the functions arising from equations [ cxi ] and their relation to the solutions of heun equations . j . a . buchstaber and v . i . tertychnyi have constructed symmetries of the confluent heun equations ( [ heun ] ) @ xcite . the symmetry @ xmath123 , which is an element of its solution space , was found in @ xcite . it corresponds to the solution @ xmath124 of the linear equation ( [ josbeg ] ) ; the other symmetry was found in @ xcite . in @ xcite they have found new nontrivial symmetries in the case , when @ xmath125 and equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) does not have any solutions . also in the paper the _ solution @ xmath126 ( = @ xmath127 ) of linear rec##urrence relation @ xmath128 we have a ( one - or two - sided ) sequence of real numbers @ xmath57 satisfying the relation for and @ xmath100 ( or , @ xmath92 ) . ( here we may consider two - sided infinite series . ) if in particular , the power series @ xmath74 converges to an annulus centered at 0 ( for all the relations under consideration , this would automatically imply convergence on all of @ xmath15 ) then the formal solution under consideration is # simply _ a _ _ : the notation ` ` ' ' ' is used for simplicity . in section 3 we write the explicit formulas for solutions of recurrence relations ( [ tau ] ) in the proof of theorem [ cons ] . then in section 4 we deduce explicit functional equations satisfied by monodromy eigenvalues of double - heun equations ( both versions of equation [ tau ] ) . in section 5 we apply results of sections 3 and 4 to spin - lock systems in the proof of josephson theory . it is shown that the sum of the monodromy solutions of equation ( [ heun ] ) equals @xmath129 and their product equals @ xmath130 . this together with results of section 4 implies an explicit differential equation satisfied by non - zero level curves of the rotation axis as a function of time ( theorem [ rhonon ] in subsection 5 . 1 ) . the union of boundaries of the phase - lock area coincides with the set where the monodromy has multiple ##s and is satisfied by the condition that the monodromy of equation ( [ heun ] ) has multiple @ xmath131 . this together with results of sections 3 , 4 implies an explicit composition of the boundaries ( corollary [ cboun ] in section 5 . 1 ) . the properties of phase - lock areas and possible approaches to some of them using the explicit composition of boundaries are discussed in sections 5 . 5 and 5 . 6 . the following general results can be easily proved in section 6 using results of section 4 . [ poteig0 ] let @ xmath132 , @ xmath133 , @ xmath134 , @ xmath135 , @ xmath136 , @ xmath137 , @ xmath138 . thedouble the heun equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) corresponding to the lines @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 and @ xmath120 has a polynomial solution , if and only if @ xmath139 , @ xmath140 and @ xmath141 , and in particular , the point @ xmath107 lies in the boundary of the phase - lock area of @ xmath142 and is not an integer . in general terms , the points @ xmath143 corresponding to equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) with polynomial solution lie on boundaries of phase - lock area and are at their intersection points with the points @ xmath144 , @ xmath141 , except for the first . j . a . buchstaber and s . i . tertychnyi have shown in @ xcite that if the line @ xmath143 corresponding to equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) with a polynomial solution , then @ xmath120 , @ xmath142 are integers , @ xmath141 and @ xmath140 . for every initial .@ xmath145 there is a similar series @ xmath146 with recurrence relations ( [ rec ] ) , see remark [ rec ] . but in practice , the series @ xmath147 cannot converge . we have to prove that it holds for a previously unknown initial condition . to do this , we use the following trick : we take the sequence in the opposite direction , ` ` from infinity to infinity ' ' . that is , take a large @ xmath64 and a small ` ` initial condition ' ' @ xmath148 . then the inverse sequence for is @ xmath149 , @ xmath150 . it appears that the initial condition @ xmath145 we are looking for can be written as a limit of the initial condition @ xmath151 , by the above linear recursion ( or iteration ) , and @ xmath152 ; the only restriction on @ xmath153 is that its projectivization @ xmath154 = ( a _ k : a _ { k + 1 } ) \ { \ cp ^ 1 $ ] should include any other previously defined ` ` initial region ' ' ,which tends to the transformation @ xmath155 , as @ xmath152 . the projectivized linear recursion @ xmath156 = ( q _ { k } : a _ { k + 1 } ) \ mapsto [ q _ { k - 1 } ] = ( q _ { k - 1 } : a _ { ) \ ] ] defined by ( [ rec ] ) can be considered as the linear transformation @ xmath157 where for every @ xmath158 and @ xmath159 one has @ xmath160 it appears that for every @ xmath64 large , @ xmath161 has a strongly attracting fixed point tending to @ xmath162 and a strongly attracting fixed point tending to @ xmath155 , as @ xmath152 . this together with the results from the theory of nonlinear equations show that the fixed point @ xmath163 of the transformation @ xmath164 should have a strongly attracting solution : an [ ( @ xmath165 ) $ ] tends to @ xmath166 . we assume that the solution @ xmath167 of the##rence ##c ( [ rec ] ) define a stable infinite series @ xmath74 on a subset of x , if and only if @ xmath168 $ ] for all @ xmath64 , and then the series converge ##s . this will prove true [ metric ] . the existence and convergence of the above - mentioned unstable series is implied by the following discrete version of the famous hadamard perron theorem : the . ##ness of a dynamical system at a hyperbolic fixed point . [ metric ] let @ xmath169 be a sequence of finite metric spaces with uniformly contracting points . for each , the metric on each of them will be in @ xmath170 . let @ xmath171 be a sequence of uniformly contracting points : there exists points @ xmath7 , @ xmath172 such that @ xmath173 for every @ xmath174 and @ xmath58 . then there exists a unique sequence of points @ xmath175 such that @ xmath176 for every @ xmath58 . one has @ xmath177 and the convergence is bounded in @ xmath178 : forevery @ xmath179 there is a @ xmath180 such that for every @ xmath181 and every @ xmath182 one has @ xmath183 . if in fact the sequences @ xmath184 coincide with one and the same space @ xmath43 and the fixed points of the transformation @ xmath161 correspond to some @ xmath185 , as @ xmath152 , as @ xmath186 the theorem follows the form of the first proof of hadamard perron ##i . consider the transformation @ xmath187 of two sequences @ xmath188 , @ xmath189 , and with the mapping @ xmath190 the transformation @ xmath191 is a contraction . moreover , it has a unique fixed point , which is precisely the point we are looking for . the second condition of the theorem of the uniform convergence of maps to @ xmath192 follows from the uniform convergence of maps of the contracting map @ xmath164 to this fixed point . then the third condition of theorem [ lim ] , ( [ limxk ] ) follows by the above fixed point theorem .the subspace in @ xmath187 of the sequences @ xmath193 converge to @ xmath194 , as @ xmath152 : this is a complete @ xmath164 - dimensional vector space in @ xmath187 , and hence , @ xmath164 has a fixed point of , which coincides with the original point @ xmath193 . definition . then [ rec ] is defined . the relation ( [ rec ] ) can be expressed in the following form @ xmath195 consider the square matrices @ xmath196 and their projectivizations @ xmath197 acting on the projective space @ xmath198 with the coordinates @ xmath199 . let us define the linear transformation @ xmath200 on it . for each @ xmath201 we define @ xmath202 [ pkconv ] the transformations @ xmath161 converge to @ xmath203 uniformly on every open set @ xmath204 , @ xmath201 , as @ xmath152 . their sequences converge to @ xmath205 uniformly on theimage of every vector @ xmath206 . the image of a vector @ xmath207 with @ xmath208 under the matrix @ xmath209 is the disk @ xmath210 implies that @ xmath211 , as ( [ condi ] ) , hence , @ xmath212 for all @ xmath64 large enough . the following asymptotics and this together implies that @ xmath213 uniformly on @ xmath204 and prove the first statement of the proposition . let us prove the second statement . for every disk @ xmath201 and all @ xmath64 large enough ( dependently on @ xmath214 ) one has @ xmath215 , proving the first statement of the proposition . the image of every vector @ xmath207 under the matrix @ xmath216 is @ xmath217 . this together with ( [ condi ] ) implies that @ xmath218 uniformly on @ xmath219 , hence @ xmath152 ; or equivalently , @ xmath220 uniformly on @ xmath221 . the converse is true .* of theorem [ theorem ] . * let @ xmath222 , @ xmath223 be the unit disk @ xmath224 equipped with the euclidean metric . there exists a @ xmath172 and a @ xmath225 such that for all @ xmath226 one has @ xmath227 and the mapping @ xmath228 is a @ xmath7 - contraction : @ xmath229 . this follows from the above statement of the gordon and schwarz inequality . the fixed point of the sequence @ xmath161 tends to 0 , or @ xmath152 , by uniform convergence ( theorem [ pkconv ] ) . this contradiction with theorem [ theorem ] shows that there exists a unique sequence @ xmath230 such that @ xmath231 for all @ xmath226 and @ xmath232 . the contradiction also leads to a unique sequence @ xmath233 ( up to multiplicative order ) such that @ xmath234 ; one has @ xmath235 for all @ xmath236 . the sequence @ xmath167 satisfies theorem ([ rec ] ) for @ xmath226 , which is equivalent to the sequence @ xmath231 . this leads to a unique sequence @ xmath146 satisfying ( [ rec ] ) for @ xmath73 , as in proposition [ run ] . in particular , @ xmath237 , i . e . , @ xmath238 , and @ xmath239 , satisfying ( [ limxk ] ) and since the two fixed points of the sequence @ xmath161 converge to 0 , see proposition [ pkconv ] . therefore , the sequence @ xmath240 exists on the whole complex plane @ xmath30 . the theorem is proved . now let us prove the uniqueness . first , by definition , there exists a sequence @ xmath241 satisfying ( ( [ rec ] ) , with a positive limit , and is identical with the sequence given above . then there exists a @ xmath226 such that @ xmath242 , i . e . , @ xmath243 . for each @ xmath244 one has @ xmath245 , that is , @ xmath##246 , for @ xmath247 , using the first statement of theorem [ pkconv ] . hence the series converge ##s : with constant values of . the formula thus also implies theorem [ rec ] . next we give the formulas for the unique power series from theorem [ conv ] using the relations ( [ rec ] ) . then in section 2 . 1 we provide a simple method for writing them , which essentially preserves and also extends the formula from ( * ? ? ? * , pp . 337338 ) . first we write them for @ xmath248 , and afterwards for @ xmath249 . next we present the set of the recurrence relations ( [ rec ] ) from theorem [ cons ] . let @ xmath250 , @ xmath251 , @ xmath252 be the solutions in ( [ rec ] ) . let @ xmath197 be the projectivizations of the equations @ xmath209 , and ( [ lak ] ) . let @ xmath74 be the solution to ( [ rec ] ) . recall that we denote @ xmath253 , with the same coordinate @xmath254 on @ xmath255 one has @ xmath256 . we have @ xmath176 , and for every @ xmath64 the infinite product @ xmath257 converges to @ xmath192 . more precisely , @ xmath258 , and @ xmath259 converge ##s all numbers in @ xmath260 , as in the case of the [ 1 ] . one can then prove that there exists a number in @ xmath261 such that for every @ xmath64 the infinite matrix in @ xmath262 converge to a + 1 matrix @ xmath263 such that @ xmath264 this would be an explicit proof for the case @ xmath74 . since the infinite product of the numbers @ xmath209 themselves exists , since their products @ xmath265 converge to zero : one has to construct a priori the mathematical sequence @ xmath261 . to construct a converging infinite product of , we first need a finite sequence @ xmath57 , that is @ xmath266 rewriting .( [ rec ] ) in terms of the almost product @ xmath267 . @ xmath268 @ xmath269 the matrices @ xmath270 tend to the norm @ xmath271 our goal is to extend the above rescaling so that the almost products @ xmath272 are : where the limit is the finite - dimensional product @ xmath273 with @ xmath274 being replaced by the product @ xmath275 . it follows that one can achieve the latter result with a choice of the constants @ xmath153 . we use the following sufficient proof of convergence of products of almost products @ xmath270 .
