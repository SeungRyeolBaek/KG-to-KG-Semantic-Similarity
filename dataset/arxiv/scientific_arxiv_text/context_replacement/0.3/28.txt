developments are currently underway to improve the sensitivity of ligo and to improve its prospect for detecting gravitational waves emitted from # ##ed ##g @ xcite . of particular interest are the detection of gravitational waves released during the inspiral and merger of massive black hole ( bbh ) systems . detection rates for bbh events are expected to be within 0 . 41000 per year with the ligo @ xcite . it is expected that new detection techniques are in place in order to maximize the number of detection of gravitational wave signals . the detection pipeline currently used by ligo involves a matched - filtering process whereby signals are applied to a pre - constructed filter set of random waveforms . the particles are chosen to represent some interesting region of high - spin parameter space and are placed in pairs in such a way that provides some significant distance between an important point in parameter space and its nearest neighbouring point . however , the template detection strategy also requires many pairs of particles ( e . g . @ xcite ) placed at different mass and spin ; something that can only be achieved with the current theory of general relativity ( nr ) waveforms . to circumvent this issue , ligo exploits the use of statistical waveform methods like phenomenological models @ xcite as effective- one - dimensional model @ xcite . we shall focus here on the phenomenological particle ( phenomb ) waveforms developed by @ xcite . this model family includes bbh particles with different mass and spin - spin magnitudes ( i . e . non - precessing binaries ) . the family was created by fitting a parameterized model to existing nr models in order to generate a precise inspiral - to - ringdown ( imr ) ratio as a function of mass and spin . the obvious advantage of the phenomb family is that it allows for the inexpensive calculation of gravitational fields at arbitrary points in free space and can thus be used to generate arbitrarily dense model ##s . to increase computational efficiency of the optimization process it is desirable to reduce the number of bases under consideration . a number of reduced bases techniques have been developed , either via singular - value decomposition ( svd ) @ xcite , or via a greedy algorithm @ xcite . svd is an optimization algorithm that combines n waveforms into an orthonormal basis with a prescription that effectively filters out the redundancies present in the template bank . as a result , the number of templates available for matched - filtering can besignificantly better . in addition , it has been shown in @ xcite that , upon mapping template waveforms onto the orthonormal basis produced by the svd , computing the projection coefficients provides better approximations of other imr values not found in the original template bank . in this article , we continue to explore the application of the interpolation of projection coefficients . we propose a hybrid approach that uses both the analytic phenomb waveform family @ xcite and nr template family @ xcite . we apply svd to a template bank derived from the nr waveform family to produce an orthonormal basis spanning the bank , then map the nr family onto this basis and interpolate the projection coefficients to allow arbitrary waveforms to be selected , thereby producing a single linear approximant . we show further that this approach improves upon the accuracy of the original analytical template family . the original template family shows , with the nr family as high as @ xmath0 when no extremization of the properties is applied ( i . e . , " loss of the faithfulness " of the waveform approximant ) , and low of @ xmath1 when maximizedthe total mass ( i . e . , " fraction of the mass " of the measured approximant ) . with our svd accuracy booster , we are able to construct a new hybrid family ( given below ) with parameters @ xmath2 even without extremization of the parameters . this paper is structured as follows . we begin in section [ sec : mbias ] where we apply definitions to the parameters given in our paper . we then compare our nr hybrid family to the phenomb family and show that a mass - bias exists between the two . in section [ sec : method ] we have our svd accuracy booster applied to the case study of equal - mass , zero - spin particles . in section [ sec : 2d ] we show the possibility of extending this approach to include zero - spin particles . we continue with concluding section in section [ sec : 3d ] . a hybrid waveform is described by a wave function , @ xmath3 , where real and imaginary parts store the translation and rotation components of the wave . the specific form of @ xmath4 depends on the mass of the system , in our case the total mass @ xmath5 and the mass -ratio @ xmath6 . while @ xmath4 is a continuous function of time , we discretize the sampling @ xmath7 , where the sample points @ xmath8 have equal values @ xmath9 . we shall also sample any given waveform @ xmath4 . this process is carried out in frequency domain via @ xmath10 where @ xmath11 is the ligo noise curve and @ xmath12 is the fourier transform of @ xmath4 . the first time - varying waveform , @ xmath13 , is obtained by using the inverse fourier transform of . in the rest of the article , we shall only refer to whitened data , with the prefix ` ` ' ' ' . for our purposes it suffices to use @ xmath11 to mean the initial ligo noise curve . using the initial ligo noise curve would only serve to further confuse our approach by making it longer in the complex frequency domain . as a measure of the level of overlap between two parameters , @ xmath4 and @ xmath14 , we will use their sum , or sum , @ xmath15 @ xcite. we say @ xmath16 where @ xmath17 is the standard normal dot product and the frequency @ xmath18 . we always consider the # ##s of time - and phase - shifts between the two samples . the amplitude - maximization is indicated in , and the phase - shift is an automatic function of the frequency . note that @ xmath19 . for discrete sampling at frequency @ xmath20 we say that @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 is the complex conjugate of @ xmath14 . without this , would have to be expressed in the frequency domain with a weighting function @ xmath23 . the primary advantage of is its compatibility with formal definitions for the svd , which would allow us to perform more precise calculations below . when averaging the time - shifts @ xmath24 , we ordinarily use discrete time - shifts at different values of @ xmath25 , as this avoids interpolation . after the degree has been calculated , it is convenient to speak in terms of the quantity , @ xmath26 , given above . @ xmath27 we use this quantity in the analysis to determine the degree of .between them . we use numerical simulations consistent with the famous h - spec @ xcite . primarily , we use the 15 - bit equal - mass ( mass - ratio @ xmath28 ) , zero - spin ( zero spin @ xmath29 ) system described in @ xcite . in figure [ 1 : 1 ] , we also use the mass waveforms computed in @ xcite . the systems are matched with a taylort3 post - newtonian ( pn ) waveform as described in @ xcite at the points @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 for mass - ratios @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 , respectively . taylort4 , 3 . 5pn , is able to perform nr simulations very well for equal - mass , zero - spin bbh systems @ xcite ( see also fig . 9 of @ xcite ) . for @ xmath34 , a taylort3 hybrid is very similar to a taylort4 hybrid , cf . figure 1 of @ xcite . the mismatch between taylort3 and taylort4 hybrids starts below @ xmath35 for @ xmath36 , dropping to below @ xmath37 for @xmath38 , and @ xmath39 for @ xmath40 . these errors are much larger than those arising from the studies described above , and we conclude that our results are strongly influenced by the properties of the experimental @ xmath28 pn - nr hybrid waveform . for higher mass - ratio , the pn - nr hybrids have a larger amplitude compared to the post - newtonian waveform @ xcite . the error - rate of the error associated with mass - ratio , however , is mitigated in our analysis results , because we use the @ xmath41 hybrids only for total mass of @ xmath42 , where most of the post - newtonian mass is in band . because nr hybrids are not suitable for arbitrary mass ratios , we will primarily limit our investigation to the equal - mass and zero - frequency nr hybrid waveforms described above . the full imr signal can be obtained at any point along the @ xmath43 line by a simple rescaling of amplitude and phase with the frequency @ xmath44 of the hybrid . in such a simple calculation , the @ xmath43 line lies orthogonal to that of equal - frequency @ xcite , thereforetracing a large gradient in terms of waveform size , and hence a large degree of frame overlap . since our method for constructing an orthonormal basis set with phenomb waveforms , let us now see how well these waveforms represent the nr family to be constructed . for this purpose , we use the notation @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 to represent nr and phenomb waveforms of total mass @ xmath44 , respectively . we check the faithfulness of the phenomb family by computing the [ @ xmath47 $ ] as a function of mass . the result of this calculation for @ xmath48 is shown by the dashed line in the lower right of the [ figure : bias ] . the bias starts off very high with @ xmath49 at @ xmath50 and then gradually decreases as the mass is reduced , until eventually falling to @ xmath51 of total mass . the mismatch between nr and phenomb waveforms can be reduced by optimizing over the k - bias . this is accomplished by solving for the [ @ xmath52 for which the [ @ xmath53 $ ]at a minimum . the efficiency of this method is shown by the solid line in the top panel of figure [ figure : bias ] . allowing for a small bias , reduces the bias for @ xmath54 . the mass @ xmath55 that reduces mismatch is generally smaller than the mass @ xmath44 of our nr ` ` signal ' ' waveform , @ xmath56 over almost all of the mass space considered . therefore , phenomb ##rons are not underestimating the mass of the ` ` signal ' ' nr signal , at least in the part of parameter space considered here . the solid line in the top panel of figure [ figure : bias ] plots the relative mass - bias , @ xmath57 . at @ xmath50 this bias becomes @ xmath58 , and it rises to just about @ xmath59 for @ xmath60 . and @ xmath29 . [ more efficient minimization of time , mass space , and effective bias will give this value . ] it is useful to consider how this mass space compares to the relative error - accuracy of the early detection . for a signal with a matched - filter signal - to - noise ratio ( snr) of the rest of the detection scenarios template / waveform errors can affect the nr when the mismatch is @ xmath61 @ xcite . following the green arrow in the top panel of the [ figure : ] ] for @ xmath62 , we see that for @ xmath63 phenomb template errors have no significant consequence ; for @ xmath64 the phenomb waveform with the wrong value will be the best match for the nr . for @ xmath65 the missmatch between equal - mass phenomb models and nr ( when optimizing over mass ) corresponds to @ xmath66 . optimization over mass - accuracy will correct this error , but we have not determined to what degree . we aim to construct an orthonormal model via the svd of a bank of phenomb template waveforms , and then interpolate the coefficients of nr values directly onto this basis to generate a template model with good nr accuracy . the first step is to construct a template family of phenomb models , with attention restricted to equal - mass , low - energy models . an example of focusing on the @ xmath##43 ##1 is that template bank construction can be done by first arranging templates in ascending order by total mass . with this , we define the template bank to consist of @ xmath67 phenomb ##rons , with @ xmath68 ( @ xmath69 ) , with @ xmath70 and with adjacent templates satisfying the relation : @ xmath71 where @ xmath72 is the maximum overlap between templates and @ xmath73 is the accepted tolerance in this value . the template bank is constructed by finding a lower mass bound @ xmath74 and then @ xmath75 . successive masses are found by gradually moving toward higher mass in order to find masses , until the maximum of @ xmath76 is reached . throughout the algorithm , overlap between masses is maximized continuously over phase shifts and discretely over amplitude shifts . for template bank construction we need to perform the optimization in time by considering masses in the order of @ xmath77 . we will refer to our fiducial template bank which employs the parameters @ xmath78 , @ xmath79 , @ xmath80 , and @xmath81 . the lower upper limit was used in order to generate a similarly sized template bank using @ xmath82 values ; pushing them to @ xmath50 results in more than doubling the number of templates . these waveforms each have a duration of @ xmath83 and are uniformly sampled at @ xmath84 ( the sampling time of @ xmath85 ) . @ xmath86 of memory is used to generate this template bank using double - precision waveforms . the next step is to convert the template bank into an orthonormal basis . following the presentation of @ xcite , this is done by placing the values into the rows of the matrix @ xmath87 and factoring through svd to produce @ xmath88 where @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 are orthogonal matrices and @ xmath91 is a diagonal matrix whose non - zero elements along the main diagonal are referred to as singular values . the svd for @ xmath87 is uniquely determined as long as the singular values are arranged in descending order along the main diagonal of @ xmath91 . the # ##point of reference to determine the@ xmath67 real - valued matrices into @ xmath92 real - valued orthonormal basis vectors . the @ xmath93 basis waveform , @ xmath94 , is located in the @ xmath93 row of @ xmath89 , and associated with this mode is the singular value , @ xmath95 , derived from the @ xmath93 element along the upper row of @ xmath91 . one of the advantages of svd is that the singular values rank the basis waveforms with respect to their ability to represent the original template . this can be done in order to create a reduced basis that reduces the space of the matrix to some tolerated mismatch . for example , if we want to reduce the basis by adding to the first @ xmath96 basis , while discarding the rest . the waveforms can be represented in this reduced basis by expanding them into the sum @ xmath97 where @ xmath98 is the real - valued matrix of , @ xmath99 the prime factor is used to stress that the reduced basis is generally unable to accurately represent the original template . we canguaranteed from to to represent the template . ] it was shown in @ xcite that the mismatch expected from reducing the basis in this case is @ xmath100 . @ xmath91 , can be used to calculate the number of basis functions , @ xmath101 , required to represent the original template for the expected accuracy @ xmath102 . provides a useful solution to the problem in represeting samples from the reduced svd model . in order to determine its accuracy , however , we should calculate the mismatch explicitly for each template waveform . using the orthonormality of @ xmath103 , it is possible to see from that the mismatch between the template and its input can be calculated in terms of the projection error : @ xmath104 this error is minimized continuously over space and discretely over time , as discrete values of @ xmath25 . for @ xmath105 , means that @ xmath106 of the @ xmath107 basis functions from our original template ##s are required to represent the templates to the required accuracy . [ figure [ figure : rec ] wecompare the actual mismatch of @ xmath108 to the actual mismatches obtained from for each phenomb waveform in the template bank . the dotted lines in this table show that the actual actual mismatch is a significant amount of information from @ xmath102 , but averaged over a whole block well bounded to the actual result . the phenomb template bank can also be represented to a certain degree from a given reduced svd basis . we are of course more interested in determining how well nr data can be represented by the same reduced basis of phenomb waveforms . since nr and phenomb waveforms are not equivalent , can only be used to estimate the mismatch obtained when projecting nr data onto the reduced basis . we can therefore calculate their actual values explicitly . a second waveform , @ xmath109 , can be represented by the reduced basis in analogy to by writing it as the sum : @ xmath110 where @ xmath111 . as before , the represented data @ xmath112 will in general be neither identical nor equivalent to the original waveform @ xmath109 . the mismatch between them is @ x##math113 where we remind the reader that we always minimize over ##load time differences and discrete time differences of the two variables . in the [ figure : rec ] we use two circles to represent the representation values of nr waveforms evaluated at the same number of points @ xmath114 from which the phenomb template bank is constructed . we find that nr values can be stored in the nr basis with no bias greater than @ xmath35 over most of the template bank data . this is only a factor of one improvement in what can be achieved by using phenomb waveforms optimized for nr . since nr waveforms were not originally included in the template bank , and because a non - correlation exists between the phenomb waveforms which are included , we can expect that the template locations have no special features to nr values . this is evident from the thin dashed line which traces the nr representation mismatch for masses evaluated between the two templates . this line varies smoothly across the entire mass range and has no special features to the template location . this is in contrast to the thin solid line which traces phenomb representation values evaluated between templates . in this case , it rises as wemove away from the template and it falls back down as the new template is created . the representation tolerance @ xmath115 of the svd is a free parameter , which so far , we have constrained to be @ xmath116 . when this tolerance is varied , we observe the following trends : ( i ) phenomb representation mismatch generally follows @ xmath117 ; ( ii ) nr representation mismatch follows @ xmath117 at first and then _ _ _ to a minimum as the representation tolerance is continually reduced . these trends are illustrated in figure [ 1 : trun ] where we plot nr and phenomb representation values averaged over the entire boundary of the template and look both at and at template . the decrease in nr representation tolerance occurs when the reduced basis captures all of the nr waveform families contained within the phenomb basis . reducing the tolerance further is a point of diminishing interest . the increased computational cost associated with the larger basis outweighs the benefit of the improving nr match . we now wish to examine the possibility of using the reduced svd basis of phenomb representation waveforms to create a new nr family with improved nr match . thenew waveform family would be given by a linear combination of the projection coefficients of nr waveforms expanded onto the reduced basis . now we test this with the fiducial data bank and reduced basis described above . the idea is to find nr projection coefficients , @ xmath118 , at some number of locations , @ xmath119 , and then perform an interpolation to find the smooth function @ xmath120 that can be calculated for each @ xmath121 . the accuracy of the above scheme is maximized by finding the space for which @ xmath118 are smooth functions of @ xmath121 . it is reasonable to assume that the projection coefficients will vary over a similar space over which the coefficients themselves vary . therefore , a suitable space to move along is the space of the frame overlap . we define this to be the space @ xmath122 $ ] for which the physical frame components are mapped according to : @ xmath123 moving a distance @ xmath124 . this space is approximately equivalent to moving a distance equal to the distance between the frames . in this case , we consider the real and imaginary components , @ xmath125and @ xmath126 , of the complex projection coefficients to the basis modes that can only be represented at a single frequency . this behaviour is plotted for the basis modes @ xmath127 , 120 , and 123 in figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] . another phenomenon observed in this study is that the projection coefficients become increasingly complex ( i . e . have different values ) for higher - order modes . this is a direct result of the increasing complexity of higher - order basis modes themselves . we find that the low - order modes are simpler while the high - order modes feature most of the features associated with the single - mode and merger features of the modes . although they are more complex , higher - order modes have smaller amplitude values and are therefore less efficient in representing them . this is evident from the general decline in amplitude of the projection coefficients when moving between the different panels of figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] . we shall use chebyshev polynomials to represent the projection coefficients . these are a set of orthogonal polynomials where the @ xmath128 chebyshev polynomial is given by @ xmath129 . \ label { 1 : chebyn } \ .{ aligned } \ ] ] the orthogonality of chebyshev polynomials can be exploited to perform an @ xmath130 - chebyshev interpolation by computing @ xmath131 at the @ xmath132 so - called collocation point formed by the non - lobatto chebyshev nodes @ xcite @ xmath133 for @ xmath134 . in practice , the interpolation will not be possible and a solution , @ xmath135 , will be obtained : @ xmath136 where @ xmath137 is the actual coefficient of @ xmath45 fitted onto the basis of @ xmath94 , @ xmath138 and @ xmath139 is the coefficients obtained by computing . the resulting polynomial expression is expressed directly as a function of time through the relation @ xmath140 { \ bf u } _ { , \ ] ] where the subscript intp " informs the user that this is derived from the example of @ xmath98 . an empirical solution of constant mass @ xmath44 can be compared to the original nr ##p##form ( which we refer to " the true " signal ) , where the signal is expressed as @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 denoting the part of @ xmath45 that is orthogonal to the svd bank ( i . e . orthogonal to all phenomb ##rons in the r ##gb ) . @ xmath45 differs from @ xmath143 by the amount @ xmath144 to determine the effect of the various approximations above , we calculate the overlap between the actual signal , and the exact signal , @ xmath145 $ ] . to begin this calculation , it is useful to calculate the magnitude of the difference , @ xmath146 where we have calculated the explicit sub - units and subscripts for it . taking @ xmath147 and re - converting the left - hand - side of to first order in @ xmath148 , we convert @ xmath149 to second order in @ xmath148 , the result is : @ xmath150 we find that the right - hand - side of can be expressed as @ xmath151 , where @ xmath152 isthe part of @ xmath148 corresponds to @ xmath109 , @ xmath153 and , for example , we obtain by removing the last term from : @ xmath154 \ , this gives @ xmath155 \ right \ \ \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { n ' } \ right | mu _ k ( m ) \ right | ^ 2 + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ sum _ { k = n ' + 1 } ^ { 2n } \ right | \ mu _ k ( m ) \ right | ^ 2 + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } | { \ bf ##t } _ \ perp | ^ { \ pi { 2 } \ ] ] we can consider four contributors to the resulting mismatch : ( i ) the rounding error , @ xmath156 ; ( ii ) the truncation error from the input signal of the nr basis , @ xmath157 ; ( iii ) the failure of the svd filter to produce the nr basis , @ xmath158 . the part of the last two factors , which together make up thethe error , is traced by the regression line in figure [ figure : rec ] . the goal for our linear waveform analysis is to find an interpolation error that is negligible compared to the representation error . to determine the mass - effect of the error , , we calculate the maximum representation error of each mode , @ xmath159 this allows the bound @ xmath160 to place an upper limit on the error caused by interpolation . figure [ figure : rk ] shows @ xmath161 as a function of mode - error @ xmath162 as well as the cumulative error @ xmath163 . the latter pertains to an interpolation error using @ xmath164 chebyshev polynomials on the real svd space and the frist @ xmath106 of @ xmath107 respectively . in this case , we expect the representation error to be partly dominated by the lowest - order modes and only partly by the highest - order modes . the coefficients for the modes are shown in figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] and used to explain the error seen in figure [ figure : rk ] . in thefirst off , approximation becomes increasingly more difficult for high - order modes due to their increasing complexity . this problem is aggravated by the fact that high - order modes are more efficient for complex waveforms , as evidenced by the increasing amplitude of the modes . although low - order modes are much smoother and thus easier to approximate , their dimensions are considerably smaller so that the coefficients are smaller with respect to high - order modes . consider the three factors contributing to the total contribution of our interpolated waveform family . their total contribution can be calculated directly from the interpolated basis in a manner similar to : @ xmath165 = 1 - \ sqrt { \ mu _ { k = 1 } ^ { m ^ \ prime } \ mu _ k ^ \ prime ( m ) \ mu _ k ^ { \ prime ^ * } ( m ) } . \ left { eq : interpolationmismatch3 } \ ] ] in the case of perfect basis for which @ xmath166 , and reduce to and respectively , and the total contribution is simply the representation error of the original basis . [ figure [ figure : interperror ] ] circlesshow the absolute difference between our observed wave family and the true nr family for all masses . also shown is the nr representation error without mass and the mismatch between nr and phenomb waveforms distributed by mass . we note that interpolation adds only one small mismatch to the interpolated wave family , and remains well below the optimized nr - phenomb family . this demonstrates the efficacy of the svd approach to nr waveforms to generate a _ true _ nr family with improved accuracy over the _ phenomb family that was originally used to create nr . this represents a general method for generating phenomenological models and presents an important new way to enhance the matched - data process employed by ligo . so far , we have focused on the total mass distribution of the family . as already discussed , this serves as a convenient sub - problem , because the @ xmath28 nr family can be adapted to a given mass , so that we are able to compare against the ` ` correct ' ' family . the natural extension of this problem is to go into higher dimensions where nr waveforms are valid only for certain , discrete mass - the @ xmat##h167 . in this section we are expanding our method of interpolating nr projection coefficients from a two - dimensional template bank containing high - mass waveforms . we compute a template bank of phenomb ##rons covering mass - values @ xmath167 from 1 to 6 and the masses @ xmath168 . this mass bank was chosen to allow comparison with the work done by @ xcite . for the two - dimensional case the construction of the template bank is no longer as straightforward as before due to the high degree of complexity associated with sampling @ xmath167 . one method that has been advanced for this purpose is to place templates hexagonally on the grid of @ xcite . using this method we find @ xmath169 templates are required to satisfy a minimal factor of 1 . 5 . following the waveform design of @ xcite , templates are placed in the rows of the grid @ xmath87 with real and imaginary components filled in alternating fashion where the whitened waveforms are arranged in such a way that their relative amplitudes are equal . the samples are sampled for a total amplitude of @ xmath170 with uniform amplitude @ xmath9 ##7 that@ xmath171 of these are used to generate the coefficients of @ xmath87 if double precision is desired . application of translating the 16 real - valued coefficients into 16 real - valued orthonormal basis functions . the aim is to compute the coefficients of nr waveforms projected onto the svd bank of phenomb ##rons with mass - ratios for which nr data exists , and then search amongst these to generate a numerical waveform family that can be evaluated for arbitrary values . this is a method for generating new imr waveforms for mass - ratios that have previously not been calculated . to summarize , we take some nr waveform , @ xmath172 , in total , @ xmath44 and mass - ratios @ xmath167 , and map them onto the basis waveform @ xmath94 in order to generate @ xmath173 next we apply the two - dimensional arithmetic operations on to generate continuous functions @ xmath174 that can be evaluated for the values of @ xmath44 and @ xmath167 multiplied by the size of the r bank . the numerical waveform family is defined numerically by the formula :@ xmath175 as before , the following method works best if we can choose a scheme for which the projection coefficients are all linear functions of @ xmath44 and @ xmath167 . following the procedure described in @ xcite , the complex phase of the input mode is obtained from all parameters : @ xmath176 } \ int _ k ( p , q ) . \ left { x : musmooth } \ ] ] to motivate why it be that , let us consider : the phenomb waveform , with a time - invariant complex phase @ xmath177 : @ xmath178 when using a template scheme , or when using a template bank , having a complex phase @ xmath177 is irrelevant , because the parameters are not invariant over the time - shift . however , @ xmath177 will appear in the projection coefficients , , @ xmath179 and , if we had chosen a scheme @ xmath177 with fine - grain structure , this phase would be represented by the projection coefficients @ xmath180 . for linear transformations of waveform families the overall complex phase @ xmath177 is ., and therefore , more attention should have been paid to how it varies with the @ xmath181 . the transformation removes the uncertainty inherent in @ xmath177 by making it so that @ xmath182 . this choice ties the complex part to the physical value of the @ xmath183 axis , and does not eliminate all unphysical phase - variations on all scales . in the front panel of figure [ figure : coeff2d ] we plot the real values of the two coefficients @ xmath184 for phenomb waveforms , onto the basis of @ xmath185 and @ xmath186 . the back panels do the same thing , with the nr coefficients plotted on the basis of mass - ratios @ xmath167 = \ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 } for which we have simulated values . obviously , the refinement of the @ xmath167 axis is much finer for the phenomb waveforms since they can be sampled for any mass - ratio , whereas we are limited to looking at only the real mass - ratios for nr waveforms . for comparison purposes , the rightmost panels of figure [ figure : coeff2d] show the phenomb ##rane coefficients coarsened to the same set of mass - ratios for which the nr modes are subjected to . we see the same general ##ization as before that low - order modes exhibit the smoothest structure , while high - order modes exhibit increasing structure . a suitable interpolation method would be to sample @ xmath187 for nr waveforms of varying size for each mass ratio ( i . e . as we have done before ) and then stitch these together along the @ xmath167 axis . since the projection coefficients of figure [ figure : coeff2d ] show the same they can be sampled with at least the nyquist frequency along both axes . however , looking at the middle and right panels it appears as though this is not yet possible given the present situation of limited nr waveforms . at most the 5 % mass - ratios are high enough to sample with the nyquist frequency along the @ xmath167 axis for high - order modes . in order to obtain a higher resolution from these projection coefficients the available nr data set has to be appended with more mass - ratios . looking at the left panels of figure [ figure : coeff2d ] a suitable choice would be to doublethe maximum number of aspect - ratios to be @ xmath167 = \ { 1 . 5 , 2 . 5 , 3 . 5 , 4 . 5 , 5 , 6 . 5 } . thus , while it is not always practical to generate an interpolated wave family using the svd basis scheme applied to nr data , the possibility remains open if more nr waveforms are generated . we have shown that svd can be used to improve the representation of nr data from a phenomb data bank . a significantly improved svd basis was found to reduce noise by a factor of 10 compared to phenomb waveforms optimized for nr . there is also no de - bias associated with the svd basis and therefore no control of the parameters required . this occurs because svd unifies a set of waveform structure over an extended region of parameter space so that the biases become integrated into its basis . svd therefore provides a simple scheme by which phenomenological waveform families can be de - biased and adapted for use as matched - basis templates . we were able to calibrate the svd basis of phenomb templates against nr waveforms in order to construct a new nr basis with theaccuracy . this was achieved by interpolating the coefficients of nr waveforms projected onto the phenomb basis . only marginal error was introduced by the interpolation , and the new model family provided a more accurate representation of the ` ` ' ' ' nr model compared to the original phenomb model . this was done specifically for the case of equal - mass , zero - charge particles . we continue to investigate the possibility of extending this method to phenomb ##ic banks of equal - mass particles . at present , however , this approach is not economically feasible since the large number of mass - ratios obtained by nr simulations are insufficient to sample the nr signal with the nyquist method . this method will improve as more nr models are simulated and should be useful if the current total number of mass - ratios is to double . we thank ilana macdonald for developing the hybrid model used in this project . kc , jde and hpp all acknowledge the support of the national scientific and engineering research council of canada , the canada research chairs program , the canadian institute for advanced research , and industry canada and the province of ontario through the department of economic development and research . dk gratefully acknowledges the support of the max planck society .
