in this talk we will describe some recent results together with david dinsdale concerning the relative importance of non - perturbative power corrections for the event shape observables @ xcite . for @ xmath1 event shape _ distributions _ the same group has found in a recent analysis that , if the low - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative parameters are calculated using the method of effective charges @ xcite , then we can obtain excellent fits to them without includingany power corrections @ xcite . in particular fits based on the use of standard fixed - order field theory , the @ xmath2 case with a different choice of renormalization scale equal to the c . p . scale , require additional power corrections @ xmath3 with @ xmath4 . power corrections of this size are also provided by a method based on the infrared - spectrum @ xcite , which is able to fit the data reasonably well in terms of a single parameter . for the general result it is important to consider how to extend the method of effective charges to event shape _ distributions _ rather than means . thus for @ xmath1 and @ xmath5 , e . g . , event shape ob##servable - to - heavy - ion equation , @ xmath6 . the a . r . @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 . normalised with the leading coefficient unity , such an observable is called an _ effective charge _ . the couplant @ xmath9 is the beta - function equation @ xmath10 . @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 are equivalent , the leading coefficients @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 , are r - dependent and can be used to solve the equation , but with the transmutation parameter @ xmath0 @ xcite . the _ effective charge _ @ xmath15 is the equation @ xmath16 this reduces to the beta - function equation for an rs where the first - order terms are and @ xmath17 , the beta - function coefficients in this equation . the r - r combinations @ xmath18 etc . ( 3 ) for @ xmath19 can be combined to be @ xmath20 + \ int _ { r } ^ { { \ cal { r } } ( 2 ) } { dx } \ to [ \ frac { r } { \x ( x ) } + \ frac { 1 } { { 1 } ^ { 2 } ( x + x ) } \ right ] \ ; . \ ] ] the dimensionful parameter @ xmath21 acts as a unit of integration . it is related to the # ##ful parameter @ xmath22 by the following formula , @ xmath23 here @ xmath24 with @ xmath25 , is the nlo perturbative constant . etc . ( 2 ) can be expressed in the form @ xmath26 the second factor converts to the above factor for @ xmath0 . here @ xmath27 is the _ f _ coefficient @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 is @ xmath30 . @ xmath31 is the nnlo ech ##f - coefficient . if only a nlo integration is performed , as is the case for @ xmath1 for observables , then @ xmath32 , and @ xmath33 etc . ( 3 ) can be used to convert the experimental data for the observable @ xmath15 into a representation of @ xmath34 bin - bin - bin. . further analysis was carried out in ref . @ xcite for a number of @ xmath1 - shape observables , including soft and heavy core , which we shall focus on here . it was found that the fitted @ xmath0 regions have a clear boundary condition , apart from the two - jet region , and the region of @ xmath35 where the nlo - coefficient vanishes . the formula for 3 - d corrected for hadronization effects is shown in fig . 1 . another way of calculating the electric charge distribution is the use of ` ` ' renormalization group improvement ' ' ( corgi ) @ xcite . one can write the nlo of @ xmath36 as @ xmath37 . one can write scale - dependent @ xmath38 - logs and scale - dependent ` ` physical ' ' in @ xmath6 - logs . higher values are polynomials in @ xmath39 . @ xmath40 given the nlo coefficients of @ xmath39 , parts of @ xmath41 are ` ` log - log ' ' . one usually chooses @ xmath42 . @ xmath43 . @ xmath6 - log ,and then for all the @ xmath44 . the @ xmath6 - dependence of @ xmath5 then follows , from the rs - dependence of @ xmath45 . however , if we assume that @ xmath38 is held _ _ _ of @ xmath6 _ the remaining @ xmath6 - log lies in the ` ` eat ' ' of @ xmath6 - dependence of @ xmath43 . asymptotic freedom then follows , if we resum these @ xmath6 - logs to _ _ - r _ . + by the nlo rule , and then for all that that we have a rank 1 - r - coupling @ xmath46 so that @ xmath47 the rs - dependent of will be @ xmath48 in the time progression one obtains @ xmath49 \ nonumber \ \ & = & / / [ { \ ln } ( q / { \ lambda } _ { \ cal { 1 } } ) . \ { { 1 } \ ] ] the @ xmath38 - logs ` ` eat themselves ' ' and then arrives at the nlo ech of @ xmath50 . + if weas above , @ xcite , use of nlo effective charge distribution theory ( renormalization group invariant ( rgi ) field theory ) leads to new results for @ xmath1 event shape _ means _ consistent with the power law , as illustrated in figure 1 . taken from ref . @ xcite . given this result it would seem worthwhile to extend the effective charge approach to event shape _ distributions _ . it is commonly stated that the definition of effective charge is limited to exclusive variables which depend on different scales . however for the observable @ xmath51 and on @ xmath52 scales it can also be written as @ xmath53 here the @ xmath54 are _ dimensionless _ quantities that can be held constant , allowing the @ xmath55 value of @ xmath15 to be calculated as well . in the 2 - dimensional model for @ xmath1 observables large values @ xmath56 arise and need to be resummed to higher - dimensions . event shape distributions for mass ( @ xmath57 ) and 2 - jet velocity ( @ xmath58 ) contain large kinematical logarithms , @ x##math59 , where @ xmath60 . @ xmath61 , @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , are the leading , leading - to - leading terms , etc . for medium and large - jet , the energy _ exponentiate _ @ xcite @ xmath64 here @ xmath65 contains the ll and @ xmath66 the nll . @ xmath67 contains part of @ xmath68 , and @ xmath69 contains terms that appear in @ xmath70 . it is possible to define an effective charge @ xmath71 such that @ xmath72 this effective charge will be the terms @ xmath73 , @ xmath74 , and the corresponding term @ xmath75 in the structure @ xmath76 . one resums these coefficients to higher - order gives the following closed - form expression for @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 , where @ xmath79 is defined to be the @ xmath80 term with the ` ` ' ' ' energy of @ xmath25 ( @xmath80ps ) . so we want to resum ##mer to all - orders using the @ xmath81 algorithm ( ech ) . the case of the @ xmath82 rs - invariant ( fig . ( 2 ) ) is that the @ xmath82 has the form @ xmath83 one can also define all - orders rs - invariant @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 similarly to @ xmath81 , @ xmath84 the resummed @ xmath85 can then be used to solve for @ xmath86 by showing it in fig . ( 5 ) . note that since @ xmath21 is the _ real _ part of @ xmath87 there is no such solution as in the original @ xmath2ps algorithm . the resummed @ xmath88 can then straightforwardly be solved using @ xmath89 with @ xmath79 , so that @ xmath90 . the same problem with @ xmath91 holds for @ xmath92 , although in this case one needs to solve @ x##math93 terms , e . g . the @ xmath94 term which would otherwise be included in @ xmath31 . this can be accomplished by simply taking the @ xmath95 with @ xmath96 fixed . + + we have shown a crucial feature of the effective approximation approach is that it resums to all - orders _ rg - of _ pieces of the higher - order result , so the nlo ech result ( called @ xmath97 for short ) corresponds to the order - invariant resummation ( c . f . eq . ( 2 ) . ) @ xmath98 thus , at first - order without any resummation of large logs in @ xmath81 , _ partial _ resummation of large logs is automatically performed . + we might notice that the ll ech result contains all nll values of the standard @ xmath80ps result . + in figure 1 we see various nlo results . note that the solid line , which corresponds to the exponentiated nlo ech result , is a very good fit even in the two - dimensional case , whereas the solid line which contains the nlo @ xmath2ps2 , giving a slightly larger peak . the all - round partial resummation of the data in fig . ( 15 ) gives a larger 2 - jet peak . figure 4 shows that the nll @ xmath80ps , ` ` predicted ' ' from the ll ech , by re - fitting it in the @ xmath2ps coupling are in good agreement with the exact coeffiecients out to o ( @ xmath99 ) . we now refer to fits simultaneously for @ xmath34 and the size of power corrections @ xmath3 from the data . to do this we get the result that size of power corrections effectively shifts the decay rate , , which can be obtained by considering various models of hadronization , or performing a renormalon experiment @ xcite . thus we define @ xmath100 this shifted result is then fitted to the data for 1 - thrust and heavy jet mass . @ xmath1 results in the 1 . . . power correction from @ xmath101 gev being used ( see @ xcite for the complete list of results ) . the same data for 1 - thrust and heavy - jet mass are shown in figures 5 . and 6 . . + theech fits for thrust and heavy jet mass with some improvement , from nlo to ll to nll , mainly because at each stage a partial resummation of higher logs is automatically performed . the mean values found with ech are much smaller than those found with @ xmath80ps , but we do not find as large a correction as delphi find for the means . this may be because their analysis provides the data for bottom up decay ##s which we have ignored . the mean value of @ xmath34 for ech is much smaller than that found with @ xmath80ps , ( @ xmath102 ( thrust ) and @ xmath103 ( heavy - jet mass ) ) . very small corrections are found with the dressed free energy ( dge ) approach @ xcite . the problem with the effective charge resummations is that the @ xmath81 function has a branch cut which limits how far into the heavy - jet region it can go . we are limited to @ xmath104 in the calculations we have performed . this branch cut has a similar branch cut for the resummed @ xmath105 function . therefore , @ xmath106for @ xmath107 the correlation coefficient @ xmath108 disappears and the effective charge formalism breaks down . we need to extend the analysis to @ xmath109 . from the ` ` non - predictability ' ' , we would expect that these results would also become valid for a nnll @ xmath80ps resummation . one will be able to check this expectation when a fit for @ xmath110 is obtained . the shape processes have also been studied in dis at hera @ xcite . for these processes one has a description of the pdf s and hard scattering cross - sections , @ xmath111 there is no way to directly relate these processes to effective charges . the dis cross - sections also depend on the _ factorization scale _ @ xmath112 , and _ renormalization _ @ xmath38 - nlo . in particular one could use unphysical n - log @ xmath113 and @ xmath114 , and _ uv @ xmath6 - logs , and then by all - round resummation get the @ xmath112 and @ xmath38 - dependence to ` `by itself ' ' . the pattern of calculations is far more complicated than the geometrical one of the critical mass method , and the exact model for dis has not been determined so far . alternatively one can use the principle of maximum entropy ( pms ) @ xcite , and for the event shape means @ xmath115 and for a stationary saddle point in the @ xmath116 plane @ xcite . it turns that there are large cancellations of the nlo corrections for proton and gluon decay subprocesses . one can distinguish between two approaches , @ xmath117 where one finds a saddle point in the @ xmath116 plane for the sum of parton subprocesses , and @ xmath118 where one introduces two separate means @ xmath119 and @ xmath120 and finds a saddle point in @ xmath121 . @ xmath117 gives power corrections , compared to @ xmath80ps with @ xmath122 . @ xmath118 in turn gives substantially larger power corrections . this is shown in figure 7 for the selection of the event shape means . the large number of nlo correctionsself - improvement should be performed _ _ _ for the @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 - initiated subprocesses , and so @ xmath118 which best fits the model best , seems to be best . event shape prediction that @ xmath1 events are well - predicted by nlo perturbation ##s in the effective charge prediction , without any power corrections being required . with the usual @ xmath80ps , power corrections @ xmath125 are required with @ xmath126 gev . similarly , power corrections are required in the model of interest . @ xcite . it would be interesting to modify this model so that the perturbative model matched the effective charge prediction , but this has not been done . we show how resummation of large logarithms in the effective charge wave - function @ xmath127 could be carried out for @ xmath1 event shape distrtibutions . if the events are represented by the exponentiated effective charge , even for nlo , partial resummation of large logarithms is performed . as shown in figure 1 this results in good fits to the 1 - thrust model , with thepeak in the 2 - jet region in good agreement with the data . in contrast the @ xmath80ps prediction has a badly reduced peak in the 2 - jet region , and is well below the data for the realistic value of @ xmath128 mev assumed . we also showed in figure 3 that the ll ech result contains quite a large part of the nll @ xmath80ps result . we found out that @ xmath127 has a branch point mirroring that of the resummed @ xmath77 result . this limited the fit that we could get . we looked for power corrections and @ xmath34 to the 1 - thrust distribution and 2 - jet mass distribution , finding much better power corrections for the ech fits compared to @ xmath80ps , with good corrections going from nlo to ll to nll . the suggestion of the ` ` rg - model ' ' manifested in figure 4 would suggest that the nll ech result contains a large part of the nnll @ xmath80ps result . this suggests that the branch point , which has the ability to describe the 2 - jet region , would also end up in a nnll result . thiscan be checked if the @ xmath129 function is used . the work on error shape showed that error is also reduced and seemed to indicate that significantly reduced error corrections are found when a correctly optimised error function is used . yasaman farzan and the rest of the organizing committee of the ipm lph -
