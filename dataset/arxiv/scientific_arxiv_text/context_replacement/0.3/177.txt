the primary goal of tomography is to determine the internal structure of an object without cutting it , namely using data obtained by methods that leave the object under investigation undamaged . these data can be obtained by exploiting the interaction between the object and various types of probes including x - rays , electrons , and many others . after the interaction with the object under investigation , the object is analyzed to produce what we call a point profile or tomogram , see fig . [ fig : profiles ] . it is a rapidly evolving field for its great impact on problems of general nature and for its important applications such as the development of diagnostic tools relevant to disparate fields , such as engineering , biomedical and archaeometry . therefore , it can be a useful tool for solving different problems coming from different areas of science , such as biology , quantum mechanics and computation , cryptography , medicine , metrology and many others , see fig . [ fig : profiles ] . from the mathematical point of view the following problem can be formulated as follows : one wants to find an integral function through the use of an appropriate family of integral functions . it was shown by r . schmidt @ xcite that a rational function @ xmath0 on @ xmath##1 can be defined explicitly by consideration of the integral over the lines in @ xmath1 . let @ xmath2 denote the integral of @ xmath3 over the line @ xmath4 ( tomogram ) . let @ xmath5 where @ xmath6 is the laplacian on @ xmath1 , and its square root is given by the transform ( see also [ see : inversioneformula ] ) . we can see that the formula above has built in the linear duality : if one integrates over the set of points on a plane , then one integrates over the set of lines passing through a given point . this formula can be extended to the @ xmath7 - dimensional plane by considering the value of the function @ xmath3 on all possible hyperplanes . this suggests to consider the transform @ xmath8 , as well . if @ xmath3 is a function on @ xmath9 then @ xmath10 is the function defined on the set of all possible @ xmath11 - dimensional planes in @ xmath9 such that , given a hyperplane @ xmath12 , the integral of @ xmath13is given by the integral of @ xmath3 along @ xmath12 . the integral @ xmath10 is called _ fourier transform _ of @ xmath3 . there are some important generalizations of the radon transform by john @ xcite , gelfand @ xcite , helgason @ xcite and strichartz @ xcite . more recent work has been done by margarita and volodya manko and has focused on symplectic geometry @ xcite , on the deep integration with classical systems and fluid dynamics @ xcite , on the theory of inner product quantization @ xcite , and on the theory of marginals along lines that are not straight lines @ xcite . in quantum mechanics the fourier transform of the wave function @ xcite was considered in the tomographic approach to the study of quantum states @ xcite and experimentally applied with different particles and in diverse ways . for a discussion of the various experimental aspects of classical and quantum mechanics see @ xcite . detailed reviews on the tomographic applications can be found in @ xcite and beyond @ xcite , where special mention is given . maximum likelihood methods , that enable us to extract the maximum likelihood information from the available data .is found . as mentioned above , from the mathematical point of view , the 3d structure of the image is described by an unknown quantity @ xmath3 ( images ) , that is related via an operator to some unknown quantity @ xmath14 ( tomograms ) . the tomographic reconstruction problem can be stated as follows : for the function @ xmath14 , the goal is to recover @ xmath3 from the operator equation @ xmath15 . there are several problems related to the application of the tomographic techniques due to the instability of the reconstruction problem . there are two principal reasons of this instability . the first reason is the ill - posedness of the reconstruction problem : in order to obtain a precise estimate of the unknown function there is necessary an extremely detailed knowledge of the tomograms , which is in general , unattainable @ xcite . the second reason is the discrete and possibly imperfect nature of data that allows to obtain only an approximation of the unknown function . the third question is whether this partial knowledge still describes the function accurately . the negative answer is given by a theorem of smith , solomon and others @ xcite , that states : ` ` a function @ xmath3 with finite support in the plane is anot by an infinite set , and by no finite set of its tomograms ' ' . therefore , it is clear that one has to abandon the request of uniqueness in the applications of tomography . therefore , due to the ill - posedness of reconstruction problem and to the loss of efficiency of the inversion process , a regularization algorithm has to be introduced to stabilize the problem . a new development is the introduction of a mumford - smith ( ms ) functional , also introduced in a different paper for image denoising and reconstruction @ xcite . the main motivation is that , in many practical applications , one is not only interested in the reconstruction of the density distribution @ xmath3 , but also in the determination of some specific orientation or patterns of the function . an example is the problem of the reconstruction of the boundaries of the organs . by using the ms functional , one can obtain not only ( an orientation of ) the function but also its sharp contours . more recently an ms functional for applications to mri has been introduced in the paper @ xcite . some important problems in this context are already known but there are also some more open problems and new results in this area , as we will try to see in the second part ofthis follows . the section is organized as follows . section [ sec : radon ] is a general introduction to the radon transform , its applications , and the above formula . section [ sec : ms ] is devoted to a general discussion on the ill - posedness of the tomographic problem and to the introduction of new methods . in section [ sec : ms ] the ms function is applied to tomography as a regularization method . in particular , in section [ subsec : ms ] the piecewise constant ##s and its parameters are discussed together with a short list of some interesting open problems . finally , in section [ sec : 3dinterpretation ] we have an alternative interpretation of the regularization method based on the ms functional , which motivates us to introduce an alternative ms function , based on the landau - zisserman equation @ xcite , as a relaxed version of the previous one . imagine a body in the plane @ xmath1 , and consider a beam of particles ( ions , electrons , x - rays , etc . ) emitted by a body . assume that the total intensity of the beam is @ xmath16 . when the particles pass through the body they are absorbed or scattered and the intensity of the beamthen a length @ xmath17 increases by an amount proportional to the length of the ray @ xmath18 , and @ xmath19 so that @ xmath20 the ray placed at the exit of the body measures the final intensity @ xmath21 and then from @ xmath22 one can record the integral of the intensity @ xmath18 based on that ray . if another ray with a different direction is considered , with the same procedure one records the integral of the integral of the density on that line . the general solution of the above problem is the following : given a smooth function @ xmath23 on the plane , @ xmath24 , and a line @ xmath12 , and its tomogram , given by @ xmath25 where @ xmath26 is the average distance on the line @ xmath12 . in this case , we have defined an operator @ xmath27 that transforms a smooth function @ xmath3 on the plane @ xmath1 into a line @ xmath10 and @ xmath28 , the sum of the lines in @ xmath1 . we ask the following question : if we know the number of tomog##rams @ xmath29 , can we use the definition of @ xmath3 ? the answer is affirmative and in the following we will see how to prove this result . let us extend the above definitions to the case of an @ xmath7 - dimensional space . let @ xmath3 be a function defined on @ xmath9 , integrable on each hyperplane in @ xmath9 and let @ xmath30 be the set of all hyperplanes in @ xmath9 . the radon function of @ xmath3 is defined as : . ( [ \ n ] ) , where @ xmath26 is the maximum distance to the hyperplane @ xmath12 . thus we have an operator @ xmath27 , the _ back operator _ , that transforms a function @ xmath3 on @ xmath9 into a function @ xmath10 on @ xmath31 , or @ xmath32 . the inverse transform , also called _ back projection operator _ , @ xmath33 associates to a function @ xmath14 on @ xmath31 the function @ xmath34 on @ xmath9 given .@ xmath35 where @ xmath36 is the probability probability measure on the point around @ xmath37 which is equal to the group of points around @ xmath38 . [ the euclidean distance @ xmath39 from the origin and the unit sphere @ xmath40 corresponds to @ xmath12 . , scaledwidth = 45 . 0 % ] let us consider the double covering of @ xmath30 @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 is the unit sphere around @ xmath9 . then , the covering of the hyperplane @ xmath12 is @ xmath43 with @ xmath44 denoting the unique inner product of @ xmath45 . [ see : radon nd ] . suppose that the points @ xmath46 are mapped into the unit hyperplane @ xmath47 . therefore ( [ double covering ] ) is a double covering of @ xmath30 . then @ xmath30 has a unique algebraic structure with respect to which this double mapping is unique . we identify continuous ( continuous ) functions @ xmath14 on @ xmath30 with continuous ( differentiable ) functions @ xmath14 on@ xmath48 on @ xmath49 . we will also write for the schwartz space @ xmath50 of real - valued rapidly decreasing functions on @ xmath9 . in analogy with @ xmath50 we define @ xmath51 as the space of @ xmath52 and @ xmath14 on @ xmath48 which for any function @ xmath53 , any multiindex @ xmath54 , and any linear combination @ xmath55 and @ xmath42 satisfy @ xmath56 the set @ xmath57 is then defined as the set of @ xmath58 satisfying @ xmath59 . now we want to prove the above theorem , and we want to show that we can compute a function @ xmath3 on @ xmath9 from the knowledge of the fourier transform . in order to get this , we need a new lemma , whose proof can be found in @ xcite , which has an interesting mathematical interpretation . [ 1 . ] let @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 , @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 . let @ xmath64 where @ xmath65depends only on the dimension @ xmath7 , and @ xmath66 is the inner product , @ xmath67 is the potential at @ xmath38 generated by the charge at @ xmath3 . , scaledwidth = 0 . 0 % ] a physical interpretation of the [ is expression ] is the following : if @ xmath3 is a charge distribution , then the potential at the dimension @ xmath38 generated by that charge is at @ xmath68 , see ref . [ 1 : 1 ] . note , however , that the potential of the point charge appears approximately at the _ distance _ t _ of the dimension @ xmath7 , and that it is coulomb only for @ xmath69 . the only dependence of @ xmath7 is in the case of the point charge @ xmath65 . this fact is known : indeed , the associated poisson process is an @ xmath7 - dependent ( negative ) power of the laplacian , which appears in the above formula for the radon transform . [ see : inversioneformula ] . @ xmath60 . then @ xmath70 where@ xmath71 , with @ xmath72 , is a pseudodifferential function whose inverse is @ xmath73 where @ xmath74 is the fourier transform of @ xmath3 , @ xmath75 the proof of theorem [ thm : inversioneformula ] can be found in @ xcite . net ( [ inversion formula0 ] ) note that , modulo the group action of @ xmath76 , the function @ xmath3 can be obtained from the fourier transform @ xmath10 by the use of the dual mapping @ xmath77 : first one integrates over the set of points in a hyperplane and then one transforms over the set of hyperplanes passing through the given point . explicitly we get @ xmath78 which has the following two properties . note that if one takes a function @ xmath79 , then the function @ xmath80 is continuous in the direction corresponding to @ xmath40 , i . e . it is a ( continuous ) plane function . finally , eq . ( [ inversion formula ] ) gives a description of @ xmath3 in terms of a linear superpositionof plane waves . a well - known analogous decomposition is given by fourier transform . when @ xmath81 , one recovers the original formula ( [ q : radoninversion ] ) , given by in @ xcite . we have obtained the radon transform of any function @ xmath82 and @ xmath10 . the fundamental theorem @ xcite contains the definition of the integral of the continuous linear operator @ xmath27 and the extension of @ xmath27 to the space of square integrable functions @ xmath83 . [ q : radonbijection ] the fourier transform @ xmath27 is a continuous one - to - one extension of @ xmath50 onto @ xmath84 , where the integral @ xmath84 is defined as follows : @ xmath85 if and only if @ xmath86 and for any integer @ xmath87 the integral @ xmath88 is a homogeneous function of degree @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 . moreover , the fourier transform @ xmath27 can be extended to a linear operator from @ xmath83 and @ xmat##h91 . in medical imaging , computerized analysis is a widely used technique for the determination of the density @ xmath3 of a sample from measurements of the intensity of x - ray light sent through the sample along certain directions and offsets . the measured values @ xmath14 are converted to the density @ xmath3 via the radon transform @ xmath92 . to compute the density distribution @ xmath3 the operator @ xmath93 has to be inverted . however it is a well known fact that @ xmath27 is not directly dependent on @ xmath91 @ xcite , and this means that the problem of inversion is ill - posed . for this reason , regularization techniques have to be introduced to perform the inversion in the absence of data noise . we discuss ill - posed problems only in the framework of bounded operators in hilbert spaces @ xcite . let @ xmath94 be hilbert spaces and let @ xmath95 be a linear bounded operator from @ xmath96 into @ xmath97 . the operator @ xmath98 was considered ill - posed by hadamard ( 1932 ) if it is not definedfor each @ xmath99 and if the solution is continuously on @ xmath14 . otherwise , ( [ prob : inverseproblem ] ) is called ill - posed . this means that for an ill - posed problem the operator @ xmath100 either does not exist , or is not defined on all of @ xmath97 , and is not continuous . the main difficulty with this ill - posed problem is that even if it is continuous , the solution of @ xmath101 will not be close to the solution of @ xmath102 if @ xmath103 is close to @ xmath14 . in general @ xmath100 is not a continuous operator . to restore stability we introduce the concept of a class of @ xmath100 . this is a class @ xmath104 of all continuous operators @ xmath105 which is defined on all @ xmath97 and for which @ xmath106 is the domain of @ xmath100 . then @ xmath107 = @ xmath108 if @ xmath100 is not continuous . with the help of this class we can solve ( [ prob: inverseproblem ] ) , in the following section . let @ xmath109 be an approximation to @ xmath14 such that @ xmath110 . let @ xmath111 be such that , as @ xmath112 , @ xmath113 hence , as @ xmath112 , @ xmath114 hence , @ xmath115 is close to @ xmath116 if @ xmath103 is close to @ xmath14 . the parameter @ xmath117 is called a _ regularization parameter _ . the a _ density algorithm is one of the first steps in the application of regularization methods . there are several methods for constructing a density : the truncated singular value method , the method of tikhonov - phillips and the iterative method @ xcite . in the following section we present a regularization method based on the solution of a mumford - moore type problem . in many practical applications one is not only interested in the estimation of the density of @ xmath3 but also in the estimation of some fixed point within the image which represents the density distribution of the image . for example , the planning ofthis might include the identification of the boundaries of healthy organs like heart or lung and the boundaries of cancerous and healthy tissue . segmenting a digital image means identifying its _ homogeneous regions _ and its _ edges _ , not _ edges _ . of course , the homogeneous regions are assumed to correspond to the sets of objects in the real world , and the edges to their corresponding contours . the mumford - shah variational model is one of the principal models of image segmentation . it treats the image problem as a linear projection / edge projection problem : given an image @ xmath118 , one seeks for a ` ` piecewise linear image ' ' @ xmath119 with a map @ xmath120 of the discontinuities , the ` ` edges ' ' of @ xmath14 . the corresponding mumford - shah functional @ xcite , is the following : @ xmath121 where * @ xmath122 is an open set ( _ screen _ ) ; * @ xmath123 is a closed set ( _ set of objects _ ) ; * @ xmath124 ( _ cartoon _ ) ; * @ xmath125 are the ' edges of @ xmat##h126 ; * @ xmath127 is the datum ( _ digital parameters _ ) ; * @ xmath128 is parameters ( _ digital parameters _ ) ; * @ xmath129 denotes the @ xmath11 - dimensional hausdorff space . the cartoon @ xmath130 distance function ( [ defn : jms ] ) plays the role of a fidelity function : it requires that the cartoon @ xmath126 contains the cartoon @ xmath14 . the second term in the functional requires that the cartoon @ xmath126 be piecewise centered at the edge of @ xmath120 . in other words this function requires smooth contours rather than ones where a thin layer of gray is used to transition images from white to black . viceversa . } the third term in the functional requires that the cartoon @ xmath120 be ` ` sharp ' ' and as smooth as possible . what is expected from the definition of this functional is a smooth , cartoon - like representation of the given image together with its edges . see fig . [ fig : cartooneye ] . the minimization of the @ xmath131functional represents a compromise between simplicity and complexity . the compromise depends on the two parameters @ xmath132 and @ xmath133 which play different roles . the parameter @ xmath132 measures how much the cartoon @ xmath126 can do , if @ xmath132 is small , variations of @ xmath126 are allowed , and if @ xmath132 increases @ xmath126 has to be a piecewise constant function . the parameter @ xmath133 represents a constant parameter of the algorithm and measures the degree of variation : if @ xmath133 is small , a lot of variations are allowed and we have a fine compromise . as @ xmath133 increases , the segmentation becomes coarse . for more information on the compromise see the research paper @ xcite , and the book @ xcite . ) . left : image of the image in the mumford - smith animation ( cartoon @ xmath120 ) . right : piecewise constant function in the animation ( cartoon @ xmath126 ) @ xcite . , scaledwidth = 0 . 0 % ] the result of the @ x##math134 functional in ( [ defn : jms ] ) is one among the admissible sets @ xmath135 such that @ xmath120 is equal and @ xmath136 . it is worth noticing that in this case there are two unknowns : a scalar set @ xmath126 and the set @ xmath120 of its complement . for this reason this class of problems is often called ` ` ' inversion problem ' ' . existence of minimizers of the @ xmath134 functional in ( [ defn : jms ] ) was proved by de giorgi , carriero , leaci in @ xcite in the case of bounded rational functions without cantor space ( space sbv ) and by ambrosio and de giorgi in @ xcite . the first results for # ##ity in the mumford - moore model are shown in @ xcite . here we present a version of the above problem , similar to the inversion problem of the radon model . more precisely , we consider a regularization method that joins the edge images together with images , i . e . a method that performs both a transformation and a segmentation of@ xmath3 ( assumed to be generated by @ xmath137 ) , from the corresponding tomograms @ xmath14 , based on the reconstruction of the mumford - shah functional of @ xmath138 the only difference between the functionals @ xmath134 and @ xmath139 is the last term , i . e . the weak term , that means that the solution for @ xmath3 is close enough to a solution of the equation @ xmath140 , whereas the other terms play exactly the same role as for the functional @ xmath134 . as mentioned above , in addition to the reconstruction of the solution @ xmath3 , we are interested in the reconstruction of the solution of @ xmath120 , i . e . the set of points where the solution @ xmath3 is found . the main problem with respect to the corresponding mumford - shah functional ( [ defn : jms ] ) is that we need to convert the information about the space of sharp discontinuities of @ xmath14 ( and hence about the properties of the weak transform ) into information about the strong .of @ xmath3 . now we can consider the results obtained by ramlau and his @ xcite concerning the case of ( [ def : msfunctional ] ) restricted to piecewise constant functions @ xmath3 , and we consider some other special cases . for medical applications , it is often a good approximation to extend the problem to sets @ xmath3 that are open with respect to a part of the body , where the tissues of inner organs , bones , or muscles have approximately constant properties . we introduce the set @ xmath141 as the space of piecewise constant functions that attain at most @ xmath142 different ##iable values , where @ xmath55 is an open and bounded subset of @ xmath9 . in other words , since @ xmath143 is a linear combination of @ xmath142 characteristic functions @ xmath144 of sets @ xmath145 which satisfy @ xmath146 we assume that the @ xmath147 sets are open relative to @ xmath55 and we set @ xmath148 for the boundary of @ xmath147 with respect to the boundary relative to the open domain @ x##math55 . in this case the empty set can be replaced by the union of the sets of @ xmath147 sets . for these reasons it is possible to impose the _ nondegeneracy _ condition on the admissible partitions of @ xmath55 : @ xmath149 for some @ xmath150 , for some @ xmath151 , where @ xmath152 is the lebesgue measure of @ xmath9 . it turns out to be convenient to divide the part given by a typical function , @ xmath153 into a ` ` geometrical ' ' part given by the @ xmath142 - tuple of pairwise disjoint values @ xmath154 which maps @ xmath55 up to a set of measure zero and a ` ` functional ' ' part given by the @ xmath142 - tuple of values @ xmath155 . we can use the notation @ xmath156 , for the value @ xmath157 of @ xmath147 . as usual when dealing with optimization problems , we have to assume that the value @ xmath14 is not necessarily random ,suppose that we are being given the two tomograms @ xmath103 of the ( almost ) complete data of @ xmath14 with @ xmath158 . if we restrict the problem ( [ def : msfunctional ] ) to results in @ xmath141 we find that the original problem ( involving the function of @ xmath3 ) disappears , so it is to find the functional @ xmath159 over @ xmath141 , with respect to the functional variable @ xmath160 ( a partition of @ xmath142 values ) and the functional variable @ xmath161 ( a partition of the data @ xmath55 with at least @ xmath142 in case of the non - condition ( [ nondegeneracy - cond ] ) ) . so the problem is to find @ xmath162 such that @ xmath163 where @ xmath164 it is clear that @ xmath165 will depend on the error parameter @ xmath133 and on the functional parameter @ xmath166 . now we can solve the problem concerning the function @ xmath##167 ##7 ( [ functional : jbeta ] ) . there are several technical details needed for the complete definition and proof of the theorems , for which we refer to the original paper @ xcite . here we will give a simplified version of the proof with the intention of explain the main results , without too many technical details . the first result is regarding the sequence of minimizers of the functional @ xmath167 in ( [ functional : jbeta ] ) . for all @ xmath168 there is a minimizer @ xmath169 of the functional @ xmath167 in ( [ functional : jbeta ] ) , with @ xmath170 . the second result regards the exact sequence of the minimizers of the functional @ xmath167 in ( [ functional : jbeta ] ) with the error term @ xmath166 . let @ xmath171 denote the sequence of values in @ xmath172 and in @ xmath168 . for all @ xmath173 , let @ xmath174 denote the minimizers of the functional @ xmath167 with the value @ xmath175 . if @ x##math176 is @ xmath172 , and @ xmath177 , and there is a sequence of @ xmath174 such that @ xmath178 is @ xmath179 , and @ xmath180 is a minimizer of @ xmath167 with initial data @ xmath103 . similarly , the sequence of an infinite sequence of @ xmath174 is a minimizer of @ xmath167 with initial data @ xmath103 . # the last result is a convergence theorem . let @ xmath181 be given , @ xmath182 and @ @ xmath183 . suppose we have noisy sequences @ xmath168 with @ xmath184 . let us choose the sequence @ xmath185 with the conditions @ xmath186 and @ xmath187 as @ xmath112 . for any sequence @ xmath188 , let @ xmath189 be the minimizers of the sequence @ xmath190 with initial data @ xmath175 and the condition @ xmath19##1 . then there is a unique solution of @ xmath189 . moreover , for every such subsequence with perimeter @ xmath192 the function @ xmath193 is a solution of the equation @ xmath194 with a minimal perimeter . so if @ xmath195 is the unique solution of this equation then the whole function is @ xmath196 when @ xmath197 . finally , let us consider some important problems in this context : * is the nondegeneracy condition ( [ nondegeneracy - cond ] ) necessary ? * can we find an a priori optimal value for the function @ xmath142 of all values ? * is it possible to give an a priori estimate of the @ xmath198 - value of the solution ( uncertainty principle ) ? * and finally , it would be very important for applications to prove the existence of minimizers of the function @ xmath139 when restricted to piecewise constant ##s @ xmath3 . we see that all these problems are very simple , and have been completely solved in the case of the generalized mumford - moore function @ xmath13##4 . ( [ defn : jms ] ) , see e . g . @ xcite . in this section we turn our attention to the @ xmath199 - dimensional case . we propose an efficient extension of the above method based on the term @ xmath139 described in the previous section . the intent is to give a complete description of the constant term @ xmath200 in the form ( [ def : msfunctional ] ) , that provide the intuition for an effective approximation method . for @ xmath69 , the inversion formula ( [ def formula0 ] ) and the equality formula ( [ def : electid ] ) are , respectively , as follows : for all @ xmath201 one has @ xmath202 and @ xmath203 where @ xmath61 and @ xmath204 is a constant . we have two important results . [ def : normrf ] for all - valued @ xmath201 one has @ xmath205 we see that @ xmath206 , and @ xmath207 ( x ) \ , { \ mathcal { x } } ( { \mathcal { r } } { f } ) ( x ) \ ; \ textrm { d } x \ nonumber \ \ & & = \ frac { 1 } { { ( x \ 1 ) ^ 3 } \ int _ { { \ mathbb { r } } ^ 2 } | \ nabla { \ mathcal { r } } ( { \ mathcal { r } } { f } ) ( x ) | ^ 2 \ ;

if we apply to @ xmath3 first the radon operator @ xmath27 and then its adjoint @ xmath77 we obtain , up to some factor , the electric potential given by thecharge density @ xmath3 . this formulation can be used in the dimension @ xmath7 : the problem with electric potential only in dimension @ xmath7 is that , in tomography , the potential produced by a given charge distribution scales like @ xmath220 , which is the case of electrostatic potential only in dimension @ xmath199 . from the above interpretation of the fourier transform we can see that the fidelity term in the functional @ xmath139 actually means that the electric potential produced by the charge distribution @ xmath3 must be close to the ` ` measured electric potential ' ' . so we see that the term @ xmath221 is the fidelity term in this particular formulation . in this formulation based on the above interpretation of the tomographic reconstruction , we can try to find the appropriate functionals for the corresponding terms @ xmath222 ( electric field ) or @ xmath223 ( electric potential ) and then compute the corresponding @ xmath3 ( charge density ) . we compute the functional @ xmath139 as follows : @ xmath224 where @ xmath225 is a linear functional depending on a vector function @ xmat##h222 and for the function @ xmath120 , and we found the measure that @ xmath226 , since @ xmath222 is conservative . we found that the functional @ xmath227 is a second order function for the vector field @ xmath222 , which is the subset of the set @ xmath120 that is the set of elements of @ xmath3 and thus is the set of elements of @ xmath228 . for the function @ xmath225 we find some problems with a related second - order non - conservative problem : the blake - zisserman function . this function is based on the distribution of the blake - zisserman functional @ xmath229 among admissible sets @ xmath230 , where * @ xmath122 is an open set ; * @ xmath231 are closed sets ; * @ xmath232 is the set of elements of @ xmath233 ( jump 1 ) , and @ xmath234 the the set of elements of @ xmath235 ( jumpset ) ; * @ xmath236 , @ xmath237 is a scalar function ; * @ xmath238 is the partial laplacian of @ xmath233 ; * @ xmath239 denotes the datum ( ( x ) of the original image ) ; * @ xmath240 are vectors ; * @ xmath129 is the @ xmath11 - dimensional hausdorff space . the blake - zisserman functional allows for more efficient segmentation than the mumford - moore function in the sense that only the size of the pixels of the original image is reduced . on the other hand , minimizers do not always exist , depending on the values of the function @ xmath241 and on the summability assumption of @ xmath242 . we refer to @ xcite for description and analysis of variational approaches to image segmentation and digital image processing . in particular see @ xcite for existence of minimizer functions and @ xcite for a reference to this and @ xcite for results on the regularity of minimizers . theorem ( [ eqnaeeay _ 1 ] ) implies that the function @ xmath##139 can be rewritten in terms of the vector field @ xmath222 and of the discontinuities set of @ xmath228 , i . e . the set of components of @ xmath222 , using the terminology of the blake - zisserman model . the fact that in the functional @ xmath225 the discontinuities set of @ xmath222 is not present depends on the fact that we are assuming that the charge density @ xmath3 and the potential @ xmath139 do not lie on points but on lines . if we consider vector fields , we can consider the blake - zisserman model for the vector field @ xmath222 as a simplified version of the mumford - shah model for the functional @ xmath3 . in other words we want to investigate the relationship between minimizers of @ xmath139 and minimizers of the - dimensional functional @ xmath243 : @ xmath244 with the boundary constraint @ xmath245 . the main advantage of this approach is that the functional @ xmath243 is a purely differential operator , like the functional @ xmath139 .an integro - differential equation . we expect that some results about the maxwell - zisserman equation that could be translated into tomographic terms would provide immediately new results in tomography . conversely all the new tomographic features , the intrinsic vector nature of the term @ xmath222 , the fact that its value can not be changed and the non - constraint @ xmath246 , motivate new research efforts in the field of free - field theory . for example , an important result in this context would be the proof of a good hypothesis on the datum @ xmath247 that shows that the charge density @ xmath3 does not change . we end this section with these comments : * we assume that the measured fields @ xmath14 are exactly the measured electric fields produced by the measured charge density , so the term @ xmath200 in the functional is a fidelity term in a weak sense . * the problem of the reconstruction of the functional can be rephrased into a classification problem for the electric field . the electric field is an irrotational vector field , so the functional minimization problem is called a vector field . in order to avoid this constraint we could usethe general solution in terms of the error is @ xmath223 ( @ xmath248 ) obtaining a third - order functional for which the error term is @ xmath249 where the coefficients are given by ( [ eq : 1 ] ) . * all this calculations are done in dimension @ xmath199 . for a generic dimension @ xmath250 the problem is quite different because the exact solution for the fourier transform involves a ( possibly infinite ) expansion of the laplacian . in this case the electrostatic description of as given in this article fails . in order to restore stability , it is necessary to consider a fourier - transform transform which gives integrals of @ xmath3 over linear domains with codimension @ xmath251 such that @ xmath252 , i . e . @ xmath253 , see e . g . @ xcite . we thank g . devillanova , g . florio and g . maddalena for for their assistance . this work was supported by ` ` fondazione cassa di risparmio di torino ' ' and by the italian national institute of mathematical physics ( gnfm- indam ) .
