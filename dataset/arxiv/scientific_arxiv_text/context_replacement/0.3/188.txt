dynamics of chaotic systems is a theoretical phenomenon , which recently received a lot of attention , see e . g . @ xcite . even though the heuristic theory and the classification of the synchronization phenomena are well studied and very well understood , a mathematically rigorous description is still needed . generally speaking , a standard difficulty lies in the fact that the phenomenon involves the study of non - uniformly chaotic systems , typically consisting of different sub - systems , whose long - time stability depends only on the computation of the ` ` ' ' ' lyapunov exponents , i . e . of those exponents that are zero in the presence of zero interactions , and are also non - zero in the presence of interactions among the sub - systems . the mathematical computation of these exponents is therefore very difficult . progress in their computation is a necessary preliminary step for the definition of the srb measure of chains and lattices of random variables , which may serve as standard models for uniformly chaotic systems out - of - equilibrium ( i . e . they may serve as standard models for non - equilibrium steady states in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ) . in the original paper @ xcite , we presented a simple model for phase transitions in aone - dimensional manifold consisting of the suspension flow of arnold s cat map associated with the clock . the coupling in @ xcite was simple , in the sense that it did not modify the suspension flow , but only the clock motion . notwithstanding its simplicity , the coupling has a non - trivial behavior : in particular , we used phase locking and in @ xcite we constructed the corresponding attractive invariant manifold via a convergent process . however , because of unidirectionality , the lyapunov spectrum in @ xcite was very simple : the ` ` constant ' ' terms ( i . e . , those corresponding to the motion on the invariant manifold ) correlated with the unperturbed ones , and the constant term was calculated in the form of a taylor expansion of the perturbation over the manifold . in this case , we extend the definition of @ xcite to a simple linear model , for which the lyapunov spectrum is non - trivial , and we show how to compute it in terms of a taylor expansion , which takes the form of a binary tree , described in detail in the following . the expansion is defined as follows . take arnold s cat map @ xmath0 and denote by @ xmat##h1 and @ xmath2 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors , respectively , of @ xmath3 : @ xmath4 with @ xmath5 , so that @ xmath6 is normal . we let the mean value of arnold s ##nr be written as @ xmath7 , with @ xmath8 , if @ xmath9 @ xmath10 . therefore , @ xmath11 is the solution to the ordinary differential equation instead of , and in the following we have noted the fact that at all times @ xmath12 the solution @ xmath13 changes randomly from @ xmath14 to @ xmath15 , and without these discontinuities the flow is normal . therefore , all the assumptions and assumptions of @ xcite are satisfied , modulo this re - evaluation of the differential equation ( * ? ? ? * ( 1 . 1 ) ) , where @ xmath16 should be replaced by @ xmath17 . ] , @ xmath18 : t = ( t ) ( t ) . , [ t . susf ] where @ xmath19 is the @ xmath20 - periodic delta function so that @ x##math21 for arnold @ xmath22 . the rate of evolution is obtained by coupling the suspension motion of arnold ##i . map with the motion of a closed loop , such that for @ xmath23 the evolution rate is @ xmath24x + \ varepsilon f ( x , w , t ) , & \ \ \ end { w } = 1 + \ varepsilon g ( x , w , t ) , \ end { cases } \ ] ] where @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 , @ xmath27 are @ xmath20 - like in their nature . for @ xmath28 the motions of @ xmath13 and @ xmath29 are independent . however , the relative phase @ xmath29 mod @ xmath30 among the two flows is independent . if @ xmath31 and if the interaction is dissipative ( in the general case , to be seen in the paper ) , then the paths of the two flow - paths can converge , so that the next event in the near future takes place on an orbit of size smaller than 1 , for the observed data of an nearest neighborood of the attractor . in@ xcite , we have constructed such an invariant in terms of a finite power series expansion of @ xmath32 , for @ xmath33 and a special case of dissipative functions @ xmath27 . in this way , we extend the analysis of @ xcite to @ xmath34 . our final result is the construction of the corresponding invariant ##s for @ xmath34 . [ 1 : 1 ] let @ xmath35 be the flow on @ xmath36 associated with the solution , with @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 included as their arguments . take @ xmath37 and assume there exist @ xmath38 such that @ xmath39 and @ xmath40 , independently of @ xmath41 . then there exist solutions @ xmath42 such that for @ xmath43 there exists a homemorphism @ xmath44 and a continuous function @ xmath45 , both hlder - continuous of and @ xmath46 , such that the flow @ xmath47 is invariant under the poincar flow @ xmath48 and the action of @ xmath48 on @ xmath49 .and to that of @ xmath50 by @ xmath51 , i . e . @ xmath52 the proof of this result is straightforward : it provides an efficient method for computing the generic ##ity of the perturbation ##s of @ xmath53 with respect to @ xmath32 , it shows how to compute it and how to prove convergence of the series . as a by - product , we show that the complex plane is holomorphic over @ xmath32 in a suitable domain of the complex plane , whose boundary is the circle . the construction also shows that @ xmath54 is an attractor . we denote by @ xmath55 the basin of , and by @ xmath56 the arbitrary open neighborood of @ xmath54 , in @ xmath55 such that @ xmath57 , with @ xmath58 the lesbegue measure on @ xmath59 . in addition to the definition of the invariant measure , in this paper we show how to define the invariant measure on the surface and the lyapunov measure , in terms of the series . more precisely , let @ xmath60 be the lesbegue measure restricted to @xmath56 , i . e . , defined by @ xmath61 the continuous function of @ xmath56 , @ xmath62 , for all measurable @ xmath63 . the ` ` ' ' ' limiting measure of the attractor , @ xmath64 , is defined by @ xmath65 for all continuous functions @ xmath66 and @ xmath60 - a . e . @ xmath67 , where @ xmath68 . the limiting measure @ xmath64 is defined by @ xmath54 and such that @ xmath69 . on the boundary , @ xmath64 - a . e . , defines a new base , i . e . a point of the complex plane , @ xmath70 , such that @ xmath71 the constants of the @ xmath72 are the lyapunov polynomials , and we have them defined as @ xmath73 ; in the limit we shall call @ xmath74 the _ central _ lyapunov exponent . our first main result is the following . [ 1 : 1 ] there is @ x##math75 shows that the conjecture is true . let @ xmath66 be an hlder continuous function on @ xmath59 . then @ xmath76 is hlder analytic in @ xmath32 , for @ xmath77 . if @ xmath66 is analytic , then @ xmath76 is analytic in @ xmath32 , for @ xmath78 and it is @ xmath66 - analytic in @ xmath79 . similarly , the lyapunov polynomials @ xmath72 , @ xmath80 , are analytic in @ xmath32 for @ xmath77 . in particular , the negative lyapunov polynomial is negative : @ xmath81 , for @ xmath82 . the paper is summarized as follows . section [ prop : 2 ] is quoted in section [ prop : 2 ] below . the proof follows the following procedure of @ xcite : ( 1 ) we first write the equations for the invariant ##s and solve them recursively at higher orders in @ xmath32 ; ( 2 ) then we express the result of the solution ( which is not necessarily a constantdefine ( @ xmath32 ) in terms of tree diagrams ( for graphs without nodes ) ; trees with @ xmath83 nodes are equivalent to @ xmath84 _ _ _ tree _ _ , which is not a function of @ xmath32 ; ( 3 ) finally , using the tree diagrams , we have an upper bound on the tree values . the fact that the constant is zero , of order @ xmath85 , produces bad factors @ xmath86 . the order of the tree diagrams , for each @ xmath87 depending on the case therefore , we need to show that for every tree @ xmath87 is less than a function of @ xmath83 , if @ xmath83 is the number of nodes in the tree . this is done by exhibiting the inequality , arising from the condition @ xmath39 . section [ prop : 2 ] is found in section [ sec : 2 ] . the proof adapts the tree representation to the computation of the local lyapunov polynomial @ xmath88 on the invariant ##s , in the spirit of ( * ? ? ? * * 2 ) and @ xcite . the proofthe lyapunov exponent @ xmath89 plays the role of the action constant for the energy measure @ xmath90 . thus , as a functional expansion for @ xmath89 , @ xmath90 can be constructed using # # ##ing ##s , as in ( * ? ? ? * chapter 2 ) . similarly , @ xmath72 can be used as one of the local exponents of the probability distribution . in section [ 1 : 2 ] , we present some numerical methods for the solution to non - linear decomposition of the invariant manifold , and also some others . in this section , we define the dynamics for the invariant manifold , by using a formula that maps the dynamics associated to the manifold onto the unperturbed manifold . the conjugation is given by @ xmath91 , with @ xmath92 where @ xmath93 is the dynamics of @ xmath94 . let @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 be the initial conditions at and @ xmath97 . we will look for a solution to of the equation @ xmath98 for @ xmath##99 , with the conditions @ xmath100 the following equation for @ xmath29 will be obtained by ` ` expanding the vector field at first order in @ xmath101 and at zeroth order in @ xmath102 ' ' , i . e . as @ xmath103 where @ xmath104 and g ( , t ) : = g ( s h ( ) + a ( , t ) , - _ 0 + a + b ( , t ) , t ) - _ 0 ( , t ) - _ 1 ( , t ) u ( , t ) . [ 2 . 5 ] the logic behind the equation is that the ( linear ) system as obtained by ignoring @ xmath105 is dissipative , with the rate equal to @ xmath32 , due to the second condition above : this will allow us to calculate the actual dynamics as a function of the second one . the approximation obtained by ignoring @ xmath105 is the only solution for this . in principle we could have expanded the field at first order both in @ xmath101 and in @ xmath106 , and the result would be qu##alitatively the same . we now take @ xmath107 and find @ xmath108 such that @ xmath109 ; thus we find @ xmath110 the formula for @ xmath13 , if expressed in terms of @ xmath111 , and , after solving , @ xmath112 for @ xmath113 , these become [ e : 2 . 8 ] @ xmath114 it is possible to add an additional parameter @ xmath115 , to find a set equal to @ xmath32 , and then and as [ eq : 2 . 8 ] @ xmath116 the idea is to first take @ xmath115 as a constant independent of @ xmath117 , and find the solution in the form of a power series in @ xmath32 , with coefficients dependent on @ xmath60 , and finally find that the ( @ xmath115 - dependent ) rate of convergence of the series in @ xmath32 is not @ xmath118 , @ xmath119 , but not @ xmath60 : this means that we should be able to solve@ xmath120 without spoiling the summability of the solution . summarizing , we can look for the solution of in the form @ xmath121 with [ e : 2 . 10 ] @ xmath122 and : @ xmath123 , with @ xmath11 and @ xmath124 as constraints ; @ xmath105 is put into ; @ xmath60 can be explicitly set back to @ xmath32 . the solution to - is looked for in the form of the infinite linear constraints of @ xmath117 ( at least @ xmath60 , in the form explained above ) . therefore , we take [ e : 2 . 10 ] @ xmath125 and put these constraints into . using the above definitions of @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 , we can find ( for @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 ) @ xmath128 where @ xmath129 in the direct form has the constraints @ xmath130 , and @ xmath131 and similarly for @ xmath132 ( note that @ xmath133and @ xmath6 ( the generators and eigenvectors of @ xmath134 ) ; here and , we have . by @ xmath135 the corresponding product is also @ xmath136 . for @ xmath137 where @ xmath138 and @ xmath139 . for this reason , we have since , that the product of @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 is , by the cauchy theorem , @ xmath140 for some notation @ xmath141 , which divides @ xmath142 ( with @ xmath143 ) . ( @ xmath144 , @ xmath145 , and @ xmath146 , with @ xmath147 ) . taking @ xmath148 and taking into , we have for @ xmath149 [ 1 : 0 . 5 ] @ xmath150 and the notation @ xmath151 where @ xmath152 . then and again , if @ xmath153 , the notation @ xmath154 should be written as , , and .for the other products of the form that @ xmath155 and / or @ xmath156 . similarly , for @ xmath157 , we find , for @ xmath158 , [ eq : 1 . 5 ] @ xmath159 where @ xmath160 . we then try to find the generic terms of the form resulting from the above equations ; the goal is to find that the @ xmath83 - derived term is , up to @ xmath161 , with @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 . we are trying to include all the coefficients of the terms of rooted trees ( or rooted trees , in the sense ) , in @ xcite . we return to ( * ? ? ? * _ ? ) for the definition of coefficients and terms . with respect to the trees in @ xcite in the first case there are three _ types _ of nodes . we find the symbols , , and , for them , of : @ xmath164 , @ xmath165 , @ xmath166 and @ xmath167 , where : they extend to up to @ xmath168, and . the constraint @ xmath129 allows any node of types 0 or 1 to be immediately preceded by any other node of these two types . suppose that a _ tree _ is a partially ordered set of nodes and lines ; the partial order relation is denoted by @ xmath169 and each line will be drawn as an arrow pointing from the node it exits to the node it enters . we denote @ xmath170 the set of nodes and @ xmath171 the set of leaves of the tree @ xmath172 . then by @ xcite we denote by @ xmath173 the node such that @ xmath174 for any node @ xmath175 : @ xmath173 will be called the _ special node _ and the line exiting @ xmath173 will be called the _ special node _ . the root line can be imagined to enter a single point , called the root , which , however , is not drawn as a line . with each node we associate a label @ xmath176 to denote the type and [ the variable @ xmath177 $ ] . with the nodes of types 2 and 3 we also associate a label @ xmat##h178 . denote by @ xmath179 the number of nodes from @ xmath29 to @ xmath180 , with types @ xmath181 and @ xmath29 respectively , then @ xmath182 where @ xmath183 if @ xmath184 , @ xmath185 if @ xmath186 , and @ xmath187 otherwise . for each node @ xmath181 , we denote by @ xmath188 the next node immediately preceding it ; next , we let @ xmath189 be the number of nodes of type @ xmath190 immediately preceding it ; if @ xmath191 , we can define @ xmath192 , @ xmath193 , to be the number of nodes @ xmath29 of type @ xmath190 with @ xmath194 immediately preceding it ( i . e . , that @ xmath195 ) . next , we define @ xmath196 , with @ xmath197 , and @ xmath198 . a node @ xmath181 is called a _ x - node_ if @ xmath199 , while it is not an _ _ node _ if it is not an end - node . the _ node factor _ @ xmath200 is defined as @ xmath201 where @ xmath202 is defined as equal to @ xmath203 , and the _ node factor _ is @ xmath204 with the definitions above , we denote by @ xmath205 the subset of the trees with @ xmath83 nodes , @ xmath206 , and the fact that nodes of type @ xmath164 and @ xmath165 may not be simultaneously represented by exactly one node of type @ xmath164 or @ xmath165 ; if @ xmath191 , we can denote by @ xmath207 the subset of by @ xmath205 with @ xmath208 . then , we can prove by induction that [ 1 : 1 . 5 ] @ xmath209 where @ xmath210 with the integrals to be obtained by using the right arrow , i . e . , starting from the end - nodes and then continuing towards the nodes . in the[ fig : n = 00003d1 ] the individual order labels are graphically shown , and the contributions of exiting @ xmath211 are shown in text [ fig : n = 00003d2 ] . for each order @ xmath181 , the label @ xmath212 is clearly placed over the label of @ xmath181 , for clarity purposes , and the order @ xmath213 ( to be carried out ) is also clearly shown . @ c = 2cm @ r = 1 . 5 ##cm @ < - [ o ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 08 ) v _ 0 & * + [ o ] [ f * : black ] & h ^ ( 1 ) ( ) = @ < - [ o ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 08 ) v _ 0 & * + [ o ] [ o ] + @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 08 ) v _ 0 & * + [ f * : black ] & h ^ ( 1 ) _ ( ) = @ < - [ o ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 08 ) v _ 0 & * + [ o ] @ r = 1 . 5cm @ r = 1 . 5 ##cm . *u ^ ( 2 ) ( ) = @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 0 & * + [ o ] [ f * : black ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 1 & * + [ o ] & + & @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 0 & * + [ o ] [ f * : black ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 0 & * + [ f * : black ] @ c = 1 . 5cm @ r = 0 . 12 ##cm u ^ ( 2 ) ( ) = @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 0 & * + [ o ] [ f ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 1 & * + [ o ] & + & @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 0 & * + [ o ] [ f ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 1 & * + [ f * : black ] @ c = 1 . 5cm @ r = 0 .5 # a ^ ( 2 ) _ ( ) = @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 15 ) v _ 0 & * + [ f * : black ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 1 & * + [ o ] & + & @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 0 & * + [ f * : black ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 15 ) v _ 1 & * + [ f * : black ] + @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 0 & * + [ f * : black ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 1 & * + [ o ] [ r ] & + & @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 0 & * + [ f * : black ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 1 & * + [ o ] [ f * : black ] @ c = 1 . 5cm @ c = 1 . 5 ##cm ##a ^ ( 2 ) _ ( ) = @ < - [ r ] ^- _ ( 1 . 15 ) v _ 0 & * + [ f ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 15 ) v _ 1 & * + [ f ] & + & @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 15 ) v _ 0 & * + [ f ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 1 & * + [ f * : black ] + @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 15 ) v _ 0 & * + [ f ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 15 ) v _ 1 & * + [ f ] [ f ] & + & @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 0 & * + [ f ] @ < - [ r ] ^ - _ ( 1 . 20 ) v _ 1 & * + [ f ] [ f * : black ] for @ xmath214 a few contributions to @ xmath215 are shown in figure [ 1 : 1 = 00003d3 ] . all the above contributions are obtained by replacing the nodes of the root node @ xmath173 with nodes of a different type , withthe fact that if only one node is @ xmath173 , it is a node of either 2 or 4 ;

node . similarly , with each node @ xmath181 with @ xmath321 , we associate a label @ xmath322 , and we define @ xmath323 for all nodes @ xmath181 with @ xmath324 ; with each node @ xmath181 with @ xmath325 , we associate a label @ xmath326 such that either @ xmath327 or @ xmath328 ( so that if @ xmath181 is a node of type @ xmath314 with @ xmath320 , so that either @ xmath329 or @ xmath330 = @ xmath331 ) , and a label @ xmath332 ; if @ xmath181 is of type @ xmath315 with @ xmath316 we define @ xmath187 . if@ xmath333 is the number of lines entering @ xmath181 and @ xmath334 the number of lines of entering @ xmath190 entering @ xmath181 , we have the types @ xmath335 and @ xmath336 . example : @ xmath337 ; @ xmath338 . if @ xmath339 and @ xmath340 is the nodes immediately preceding @ xmath181 then both @ xmath341 and @ xmath342 . if @ xmath343 , let @ xmath344 be the two nodes immediately preceding @ xmath181 ; if @ xmath345 , with no loss of detail we assume that @ xmath340 is of type @ xmath346 ( so that @ xmath347 is of type @ xmath314 ) ; if @ xmath348 , with no loss of detail we assume that @ xmath340 is of type @ xmath314 ( so that @ xmath347 is of type @ xmath315 ) ; in both cases wedefine the constraints that @ xmath349 , @ xmath350 and @ xmath351 . denoting by @ xmath188 the nodes immediately preceding @ xmath181 , we set @ xmath352 , and @ xmath353 we are then ready to define the _ _ _ _ associated with the nodes : @ xmath354 finally , after using the above definitions in figures [ fig : rappresentazione - grafica - di gamma ^ n ] and [ fig : rappresentazione - grafica - di gamma ^ n ] , we come up with one such that in figure [ fig : esempi - di - alberi graph , ##1 ] for @ xmath289 ; assume that the k - nodes are all of type @ xmath316 . if @ xmath286 the first constraint is that the first node @ xmath355 is of type @ xmath315 . with the definitions above , we define for @ xmath356 the number of labelled nodes after that @ xmath357 , @ xmath206 , and the constraints and constraints described above . then weis easy to prove by showing that @ xmath358 where @ xmath359 = @ xmath360 , we let @ xmath217 be the number of independent sets obtained from @ xmath218 , by the addition of the labels @ xmath219 . then , similarly , it is easy to prove that @ xmath361 } , \ ] ] which immediately implies that @ xmath362 } , \ ] ] for a fixed value @ xmath363 . moreover , the radius of convergence in @ xmath32 of the series for @ xmath255 and @ xmath364 is equal to @ xmath365 , which allows us to prove eventually @ xmath366 . the lyapunov labels @ xmath367 are the weighted average of the labels @ xmath368 . moreover , if @ xmath369 is the ratio of @ xmath370 to the labels @ xmath49 , the linear system @ xmath371 is conjugated to an asonov system and therefore it is unique : therefore time - independent observablesthen @ xmath41 - 1 . furthermore , there is a unique srb distribution @ xmath372 such that @ xmath373 the measure @ xmath374 can be found by reasoning , in ( * ? ? ? * chapter 10 ) . let @ xmath375 be the probability partition for @ xmath134 and @ xmath376 and set @ xmath377 . call @ xmath378 the symbolic code given by the first measure @ xmath379 and then call @ xmath380 the symbolic code of the measure @ xmath381 , i . e . @ xmath382 . then the convergence rate of @ xmath369 is the convergence manifold of @ xmath383 and @ xmath384 , where @ xmath385 with @ xmath386 is the linear combination and @ xmath387 . if @ xmath374 is the probability distribution for the transfer function @ xmath388 ( in ( * ? ? ? * chapter 10 ) ) , then the srb distribution @ xmath389 for the measure @ xmath##371 is @ xmath374 and can be computed from ( see ( * ? ? ? * chapter 2 ) ) . moreover , by construction , @ xmath388 is analytic in @ xmath32 and hlder - continuous in @ xmath380 . therefore , for any hlder - continuous in @ xmath390 , the absolute value @ xmath391 is hlder - continuous in @ xmath32 for @ xmath77 . if @ xmath66 is analytic for @ xmath32 , then there is a positive constant @ xmath392 , defined on @ xmath66 , such that @ xmath393 is analytic for @ xmath394 . in addition the lyapunov functions are analytic in @ xmath32 and , from , one finds @ xmath395 this is the result of theorem [ 1 : 1 ] . in this section , we discuss informally some of the results of our previous theorem , and also a conjecture about the transition from analytic to smooth ( er ) functions , which is proved by our theorem . from theorem [ prop : 1 ] we know that the function @ xmat##h54 of the above is that @ xmath396lder continuous , but we do not have any control over its global differentiability . this implies that our attractor must be continuous , and we would expect this to be the case for @ xmath32 positive and small integers . an analytic description of the total dimension of the system in terms of the lyapunov dimension is given by the _ lyapunov conjecture _ @ xmath397 , which is defined as follows . consider an integer ##al ##gol with an srb topology over its domain , and let @ xmath398 be the lyapunov dimension , together with their dimension . then , @ xmath399 where @ xmath400 is the smallest integer such that @ xmath401 . the _ kaplan - yorke conjecture _ @ xcite is that @ xmath402 counts with the hausdorff dimension of the system ( also known as the _ _ dimension _ , see , e . g . , ( * ? ? ? * chapt . 5 . 5 . 3 ) for a full list ) . in this case , weconsider @ xmath397 as a rough estimate of the maximum dimension of the graph , without worrying about the possible validity of the conjecture ( which has been successfully proven in some special cases , as e . g . ) . specializing the proof of @ xmath397 to our case , we find that , for @ xmath32 sufficiently small , d _ 2 = 2 + = 3 + + d _ 1 ( ) , [ e : fract ] where @ xmath403 is the taylor expansion of step 2 in @ xmath32 , which is computable only in terms of the convergent expansion given in the previous section . note that @ xmath404 , and that @ xmath405 is less than 3 ( as desired ) and is not in @ xmath32 , for @ xmath32 large . therefore , consistent with the kalpan - yorke conjecture , ( [ e : fract ] ) , that the graph is fractal for @ xmath32 small , and its maximum dimension increases ( as desired ) by increasing the size @ xmath32 of the dissipative expansion . it is also knownto go to the values of @ xmath32 ( and beyond the point of proof of the [ 1 : 1 ] ) , go to the point where , possibly , the first equality of @ xmath74 and @ xmath406 holds . in the simple case that @ xmath33 ( which is the case shown in @ xcite ) , the lyapunov exponents @ xmath407 are powers of @ xmath32 : @ xmath408 . then , in the basis of , we see that by increasing @ xmath32 the hausdorff dimension of the manifold increases from @ xmath167 to @ xmath166 until @ xmath32 reaches the critical value @ xmath409 , where @ xmath410 . therefore , this critical value is @ xmath411 ( higher order ) , the higher bound being computable via the expansion given in the previous section . for @ xmath412 , we define the attractor to be a smooth manifold of dimension two . the result is illustrated in fig . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] for the simple case that @ xmath33 and@ xmath413 , in which case the only valid value is @ xmath414 .
