inflation generically involves a wide range of density perturbations which are almost fully described @ xcite . in recent years the small non - spherical signal @ xcite has emerged as an important observable @ xcite , and can be measured with high precision by the _ space telescope _ satellite @ xcite . in the near future , as the data becomes more plentiful , it will be important to understand the non - spherical signal expected in a wide variety of models , and to determine what conclusions can be drawn about early - universe inflation from a prospective measurement of this non - gaussianity . in this paper , we propose a novel method for calculating the local non - gaussianity predicted by super - ##nova evolution in high - dimensional models of inflation . our method is based on the real - space distribution of gravitational parameter values on a flat hypersurface , which can be thought of as a probability density function whose distribution is given by a form of the collisionless differential equation . using a cumulant representation @ xcite to rotate our wave function around an arbitrary gaussian , we derive partial differential equations which describe the moments of this distribution . finally ,we show how these moments are related to other parameters , such as the dimensionless bispectrum measured by @ xmath1 @ xcite . we present numerical results which show that this method gives good agreement with previous methods . it is not necessary to make any assumptions about the wave model by calculating the canonical kinetic term and using the slow - roll approximation . since there are already numerous methods for computing the near - zero contribution to @ xmath1 , including the commonly used @ xmath0 method , we believe the method presented here has a number of advantages . first , this new method is well suited to unraveling the large contribution to @ xmath1 . this is because we follow the moments of the inflaton distribution function , which makes it straightforward to identify large contributions to the skewness or other properties . the wave equation for this moment is linear and possesses clearly defined energy levels , which are related to the action of the energy flow on the system . this provides a clear separation between two key aspects of intrinsic non - gaussianity . one of these is the intrinsic non - locality associated with evolution of the probability density function between successive periodic hypersurfaces ; the other is a gauge .from the potential to the curvature peturbation , @ xmath2 . it would be difficult or impossible to resolve this split within the framework of other calculational methods , such as the conventional @ xmath0 formalism . a major limitation of our method is connected with the computational complexity of numerical methods . numerical formulas for @ xmath1 are known in many cases , mostly in the context of the @ xmath0 framework , but only for very specific values of the moment @ xcite or the moment @ xcite . these formulas become increasingly useful as the number of fields increases , especially if one considers higher moments @ xcite . in the future , it seems clear that construction of mathematical models with many fields will increasingly rely on numerical methods . the standard @ xmath0 framework requires the solution to a system of ordinary differential equations which vary exponentially with the number of fields . since some models include groups of fields , this can be a difficult problem @ xcite . moreover , the @ xmath0 formalism depends crucially on a numerical optimization algorithm with high noise level , since finite differences must be extracted from perturbatively different boundary conditions . @ xmath3 e - phase of evolution . thus , the differential equationsmust be accurate to high accuracy , since any small error has no scope to propagate . in this way we can solve our problems necessary to determine the properties of matter in our models . our method provides the solution to a number of evolution equations which vary at most polynomially ( and in some cases , even exponential ) with the number of variables . it does not rely on extracting finite values , and it is much less susceptible to numerical noise . these advantages may be shared with other methods , such as the unified method currently employed by lehners & renaux - petel @ xcite . a third advantage , to which we hope to add in a future publication , is that our formalism yields explicit evolution equations with source terms . from an analysis of these source terms , we see that it may be possible to identify those physical features of the matter which lead to the existence of large multi - gaussianities . this article is organized as follows . in [ ref : computing _ fnl ] , we show how the non - zero parameter @ xmath1 can be computed in our model . the calculation is in euclidean space throughout ( as opposed to hilbert space ) , which explains the relationship between @ xmath1 and the multi -wave functions of the inflaton field . our formula for @ xmath1 draws a thin line between the transformation to non - gaussianity , especially between the intrinsic nonlinearity of the field , and the linear transformation between comoving and flat hypersurfaces . in [ sec : transport ] , we present our formula for the distribution of inflaton field values , which is the moment distribution " around a fixed point " . we derive the equations which govern the calculation of the distribution of this distribution in the one - and two - field cases . in [ sec : numerics ] , we present a comparison of our new formulas and those presented in the paper . we compute @ xmath1 numerically for several two - field cases , and find an equilibrium between them . we conclude in [ s : conclusions ] . in this paper , we present formulas in which @ xmath4 , and the reduced planck constant @ xmath5 are set to unity . in this paper , we introduce our new method for computing the non - gaussianity of @ xmath1 . this method involves three main steps : a formula for the moment perturbation , @ xmath2 , in terms of the moment values on thespatially invariant hypersurface ; expressions for the derivatives of the number of e - foldings , @ xmath6 , as a function of their values at horizon exit ; and a prescription for describing the curvature distribution from horizon exit to the horizon when we require the physical properties of @ xmath2 . the first two ingredients are given in ref . and , discussed at the end of [ ss : sep _ transport ] and [ sec : t - n ] respectively . the final element is given in [ sec : transport ] . once it became clear that non - existence of the microwave background anisotropies could be predicted by the wmap and _ ir _ parameters of @ xcite , the authors proposed higher - dimensional models of the curvature distribution . in early work , direct values of a correlation function were applied to the known case of the non - gaussianity @ xcite . this method works best if isocurvature modes are used , so that the curvature perturbation remains constant after horizon exit . in the more realistic case that isocurvature modes cause evolution at superhorizon scales , all correlation functions are time dependent . several formalisms have been proposed to describe this phenomenon . lyth &rodrguez @ xcite extended the @ xmath0 ##3 @ xcite beyond first order . this method is simple and well - suited to numerical calculation . rigopoulos , shellard and le tent @ xcite worked with a similar approach , solving the above equations in langevin form . the gradient model was used as a proxy for setting initial conditions at horizon crossing . a similar ` exact ' gradient formalism was written up by langlois & vernizzi @ xcite . in its perturbative form , this approach has been used by lehners & renaux - petel to obtain numerical results @ xcite . a numerical approach has been developed by smith & smith @ xcite . what exactly do we expect of a successful experiment ? consider a typical observer , chosen at random from an ensemble of realizations of gravity . in any of the formalisms described above , we want to estimate the statistical properties of the curvature perturbation which would be measured by such an observer . some objects may have statistical properties which are quite different from the ensemble properties , but these statistical properties are impossible unless statistical methods are in use . next we introduce a class of finite - sized spacetime objects whosethis scatter is destined to increase the microwave background anisotropy on a given scale . neglecting spatial gradients , each spacetime volume will follow a trajectory in the theory which is slightly different from its source . the difference between trajectories is determined by initial conditions , at horizon 0 , which are determined by promoting the background state to a classical state . the trajectory prediction is a function of the time taken by the data in the collection , taken as a whole . one never makes a prediction for a single trajectory . each spacetime volume follows a trajectory , which we label with its value @ xmath7 at a fixed time , to be more accurate later . throughout this section , the ` @ xmath8 ' indicates evaluation on a spatially flat hypersurface . consider the distribution of the volume of data , @ xmath9 , which is a type of trajectory . if we consider the distribution @ xmath10 we can calculate the values of @ xmath9 such as the @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 ^ m , \ ] ] where we have calculated the ensemble average of @ xmath9 , @ xmath14in ref . , @ xmath7 stands for a set of a number of quantities . it is the @ xmath12 which contains observable ##s . . defines what we will call the complete separate universe picture . it is often convenient to write @ xmath15 as a power series in the real values centered on a fixed point , or ` fid , ' @ xmath16 when eq . is used to evaluate the @ xmath12 , we refer to the ` perturbative ' separate universe picture . if all terms of the power series are retained , these two parts of the calculation are formally equivalent . in some cases , however , convergence may occur slowly or not at all . this result was stated in refs . although our calculation is formally perturbative , it is not formally equivalent to . . . we will discuss the relation of our calculation to curvature function theory in [ s : conclusions ] . by contrast , the local model @ xmath2 measures local variations in expansion history ( known as e - functions @ xmath6 ) , centered on a comoving hypersurface . in many models , the curvature function is synthesized by super##horizon theory , which reprocesses a set of gaussian fluctuations generated at a depth . in a single - field inflation , only the gaussian fluctuations will be present , which we call @ xmath17 . for these gradients , the total gravitational perturbation must also be a function of @ xmath17 alone . for @ xmath18 , this can be well - illustrated by @ xmath19 where @ xmath1 is independent of spatial position . note the so - called ` ` local ' ' form of non - gaussianity . this applies only when the interference effects can be excluded , making @ xmath2 a well - defined object rather than a superposition of the @ xcite . if this condition is satisfied , spatial position of @ xmath2 can be extracted and it follows that @ xmath1 can be estimated using the equation @ xmath20 where we have shown that @ xmath2 is also gaussian , or equivalently that @ xmath21 . with @ xmath1 spatially independent , fig . 2 applies only to single - field inflation . in this way one can accurately estimate @ xmath##1 by restricting etc . to a single trajectory with fixed initial conditions , as in the case of lehners & renaux - petel @ xcite . where more than one trajectory is possible , @ xmath1 may vary in shape because it depends on the isocurvature modes . in this case we can determine @ xmath1 statistically from a bundle of adjacent trajectories which sample the normal distribution of isocurvature modes . # then indispensible . following maldacena @ xcite , and following lyth & rodrguez @ xcite , we adopt etc . as our definition of @ xmath1 , whatever its origin . in real space , the definition @ xmath22 of eq . depends on the definition @ xmath23 . more precisely , this follows from the definition of @ xmath12 , eq . . in euclidean space , this rule is automatically satisfied by the disconnected trajectory , defined according to eq . . to calculate , we require estimates of the correlation functions @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . we first use the following formula , in which ` @ xmath8 ' is a flat hypersurface at a fixed pointtime . the symbol @ xmath26 denotes the number of e - foldings between this time slice and the corresponding comoving hypersurface , where @ xmath27 denotes the species of light - fields . the time scales in space can be written in the fiducial form as @ xmath28 where @ xmath29 . due to the condition that the time scales are constant around the horizon , we are free to choose the initial time scale of the hypersurface ` @ xmath8 ' at our convenience . in the general sense , ` @ xmath8 ' is assumed to be a few e - folds when our choice of spacetime volumes passes through the event horizon @ xcite . this model has several virtues . first , we need to consider the properties of the field variables @ xmath30 only at the time of horizon crossing , where they can be calculated without the use of large numbers @ xcite . second , as a consequence of the jelly - roll model , the @ xmath31 is uncorrelated at this time , leading to many problems . finally , the @ xmath0 model is a linear model from the field variables @ xmath##30 to the random variable @ xmath2 . from eqs . , and , one knows that @ xmath1 can be reduced to a simple approximation @ xcite @ xmath32 where @ xmath33 and for . we have chosen the ` @ xmath8 ' which indicates ease of calculation . a similar definition holds for @ xmath34 . . is accurate due to large scale non - gaussianities seen in the density fluctuations at horizon points . as a way of calculating @ xmath1 it is quite simple , and easy to use in many models . however , it also obscures the mechanism which determines @ xmath35 . for this reason it is difficult to calculate , from eq . 3 , those types of models in which @ xmath35 is always large or small . is not allowed . see , for example , [ . @ xcite . ] our method is quite different . we choose ` @ xmath8 ' to lie around the horizon when we evaluate the gauge transformation of @ xmath2 . the role of the @ xmath0 formula , viz . , is : to calculate _ _ _ the gauge transformation between the @ x##math36 and @ xmath2 . in [ sec : derivative - n ] section , we show how the appropriate gauge field is computed using the @ xmath0 model . in the present section we restrict our work to providing the formula for @ xmath1 under the assumption that the distribution of field values on ` @ xmath8 ' is linear . in [ sec : transport ] , we also provide the necessary equations to describe the distribution of field values between horizon exit and ` @ xmath8 ' . although the @ xmath31 are not random particles at horizon exit , correlations can be induced by subsequent interactions . we will also allow for off - diagonal effects in the zero - point model . assuming that we are working with a collection of spacetime volumes in euclidean space , all on a finite scale , we write @ xmath37 @ xmath38 does not vary in time , but it may be a function of the scale which characterizes our ensemble of spacetime volumes . in all but the simplest cases it may vary in time . it is therefore necessary to account for the non - linearities among the @ xmath31 , which are constant at horizon exit but still vary . we define @ xmath39likewise , @ xmath40 should be expressed as a function of time and scale . the natural values of the index value are that and that , for example , @ xmath41 . when written as , we place the values of symbols such as @ xmath42 in this form . for the simple ( @ xmath43 ) intrinsic four - point function , it follows that @ xmath44 now we specialize to the two - point function , parametrized by fields @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 . using eqs . , and , it follows that the two - point function of @ xmath2 is @ xmath47 the two - point function can be written @ xmath48 where we have only two linear contributions , labelled ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' . the ` 1 ' term includes all terms involving _ _ _ non - linear , those which arise from non - linear correlations among the field elements , @ xmath49 the ` 2 ' term encodes non - linearities arising directly from the linear contribution to @ xmath2 @ xmath50 the use of eq . , can be used to derive thenon - linearity parameter @ xmath1 . this decomposes it into two contributions @ xmath51 , which we shall discuss in more detail in [ sec : numerics ] . to use @ xmath1 in generic terms , we need expressions for the parameters @ xmath52 and @ xmath34 . for generic first and second times , these are easy to obtain . lyth & rodrguez @ xcite use numerical integration , which is effective for arbitrary real and constant jelly - shell parameters . vernizzi & rossi @ xcite compute derivatives of a mean - field model with an arbitrary sum - separable potential by introducing gaussian spherical coordinates on the space of dimensions . their method was extended to finite fields by battefeld & easther @ xcite . scale - free models can be obtained by the same method @ xcite . an equivalent method has been developed by yokoyama _ _ @ xcite . a further simplification occurs in the present case , because we can consider the derivatives evaluated between finite and comoving hypersurfaces which coincide in the entire universe . for all species @ xmath27 , and to first order , theslow - roll method , the number of half - folds @ xmath6 where the flat hypersurface ` @ xmath8 ' and the comoving hypersurface ` @ xmath53 ' satisfies @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 are the two elements acting on ` @ xmath8 ' and ` @ xmath53 , ' respectively . using the exponential expansion of @ xmath57 , we find that @ xmath52 obeys @ xmath58 note that this allows for an expression @ xmath59 , which does not factorize into the sum and product of values for the two variables @ xmath27 . in addition a contribution from variation of the integrand is required , which is called nave ##rn to extend the method of f . @ xcite to an arbitrary field . this result is by virtue of our supposition that ` @ xmath8 ' and ` @ xmath53 ' are infinitesimally separated . to extend @ xmath60 it is necessary to use a function @ xmath61 , which in the non - linear case agrees withthe conserved quantity of vernizzi & weiss @ xcite . for our first choice of a mean - field model , this takes the form @ xmath62 where the terms are conserved for a single spatial hypersurface . in the @ xmath63 - based model , we would obtain @ xmath64 the quantities which label the isocurvature of . the distribution of these quantities is described in equation . @ xcite . for non - isolated systems one can show using the equations of motion that @ xmath61 is conserved in time evolution to leading term in slow - roll . it is not conserved for isolated systems , but the variation can be conserved for infinitesimally small hypersurfaces . under a change of variables , @ xmath61 , according to the rules @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 the comoving hypersurface ` @ xmath53 ' is described by @ xmath67 we have assuming that the slow - roll condition holds , and that the kinetic energy may be neglected in accordance with the rule @ xmath59 . based on ` @ xmath53 ' we have @ xmath68 combining e##qs . , and we have expressions for @ xmath60 , and @ xmath69 where we have : @ xmath70 } . can also be obtained without use of @ xmath61 by replacing eq . with the formulas of ref . @ xcite , which are derived from the representation theory . thus , we get @ xmath71 to obtain , we consider the partial derivatives of @ xmath6 . these can be obtained directly from , after use of ref . . we find @ xmath72 ^ \ theta \ sin ^ 2 \ theta + 1 \ left ( \ frac { v } { v _ { , 1 } } \ theta ) ^ { \ theta \ } \ sin ^ 2 \ theta \ \ \ hspace { - 6 mm } \ mbox { } \ times \ left [ \ frac { v _ { , 1 } } { 1 } \ sin ^ 2 \ theta - \ frac { v _ { , 1 } v _ { , 1 } } { { v _ { , 1 } } \ sin ^ 2 \ theta - \ left ( \ frac { v _ { , 1 } } { 1} - \ frac { v _ { , 1 } } { align } + \ frac { v _ { , 1 } v _ { , 1 } } { v v _ { , 1 } } \ right ) \ sin ^ 2 \ theta \ theta ^ [ \ theta \ right ] ^ c . \ end { align } \ ] ] an explicit expression for @ xmath73 can be obtained from the previous expression @ xmath74 . the first expression is @ xmath75 ^ 2 \ \ \ hspace { - 1 } } \ mbox { } + \ cos ^ 2 \ theta \ left ( \ frac { v _ { , 1 } } { v _ { , 1 } } - \ frac { v v _ { , 1 } } { v _ { , 1 } ^ 2 } \ right ) ^ c . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] now that the exchange is complete , we can drop the terms ` @ xmath8 ' and ` @ xmath53 , ' since any two quantity are the same for either hypersurface . when this is done it can be seen that ( despite this ) v . is invariant to the same@ xmath76 . in this section we return to the rate of change between the height and the time of arrival , and to the link which describes the distribution of field components at these two times . we begin by considering the one - field case , which lacks the technical complexity of the two - field system , yet still exhibits some physical features which recur there . among these features are the phase difference of motion of the sample mean and the background field components , and the existence of moment evolution ##s . moreover , the mechanism of the moment mixing process is similar to that which obtains in the two - field case . for this reason , the one - field scenario is an excellent example of the techniques we wish to use . recall that we are in real time with a collection of comparably large spacetime volumes , each with a slightly different expansion rate , and the scatter of these histories is the microwave background field on a small spatial scale . for each volume the smoothed background field @ xmath77 takes a uniform value described by the correlation function @ xmath78 , where in this section we are using the notation ` @ xmath8 ' for evaluation of the separated hypersurfaces . our solutionone is to calculate the smallest bispectrum , @ xmath1 , which is the third moment of @ xmath78 . in the language of probability this is the limit , which we call @ xmath42 . the normal distribution has mean zero , and inflation theory requires that the skew is small . for this reason , rather than seek a distribution with non - zero third moment , as seen in cf . @ xcite , we can introduce higher moments as perturbative extensions to the gaussian . such a distribution is known as a _ cumulant expansion _ . the study of cumulant expansions is a fundamental problem in probability theory . we consider a distribution with mean @ xmath79 , mean @ xmath80 , and mean @ xmath42 , with all higher moments described by @ xmath81 and @ xmath42 respectively . the distribution with suitable parameters is @ xmath82 , \ ] ] where @ xmath83 \ ] ] denotes the standard gaussian and @ xmath84 denotes the @ xmath85 hermite polynomial , for which there are several naming conventions . wethen to normalize such that @ xmath86 which means that the leading term of @ xmath87 is @ xmath88 . this is sometimes called the ` ` probabilist ' convention . ' ' we define values of @ xmath89 by the usual rule , @ xmath90 the probability density function of eq . has the properties , and do not rely on the approximation that @ xmath42 is small . however , for large @ xmath42 the density function will be negative for all values of @ xmath77 . this also fails to be a probability density in the strict sense . this does not pose a problem in practice , since we are interested in distributions which are not gaussian , and for which @ xmath42 will typically be small . moreover , our principal distribution of e . serves as a # ##ism to extract evolution data for the moment . for this reason we will not know whether @ xmath78 is an honest probability density function in the strict mathematical sense . ] @ xmath91 the distributions @ xmath79 , @ xmath81 , and @ xmath42 may be time - independent , so thatof the probability density function which can be obtained by finding differential equations for these quantities . the velocity function defined in eq . is well - known and has been applied in many situations . it is a solution to the problem of approximating a nearly - uniform distribution whose parameters are known . ( [ x : p1d ] ) is in fact the first two terms of the _ gram charlier ` a ' series _ , also sometimes called the _ hermite series _ . in recent years it has found multiple applications to physics , of which our understanding is similar to that of taylor & watts @ xcite . these applications are described in ref . @ xcite . for a discussion of the ` a ' series and other near - zero probability distributions from an astrophysical perspective , see @ xcite . in this paper , we will refer to eq . and its natural extension to higher moments as the ` ` moment function . ' ' in the slow - motion case , the field of the spacetime volume has a simple law of expansion @ xmath92 where @ xmath6 records the number of e - moments of x . we refer to @ xmath93 as the velocity function . expanding @ x##math94 about the following inflation @ xmath79 gives @ xmath95 where @ xmath96 the distribution of @ xmath79 varies with time , and each diffusion coefficient is time - independent . hence , we do not assume that the velocity field is _ globally _ well - described by a quadratic taylor expansion , but merely that it is well - described by somewhere in the neighborhood of the global centroid . we take the velocity field to first order , although in principle this expansion could be carried to arbitrary scales . it remains to specify how the probability distribution evolves in time . conservation of probability according to the diffusion equation @ xmath97 eq . can also be interpreted as the expansion of the chapman kolmogorov distribution as the size of each hop tends to infinity . it is well known for us , from the study of starobinsky h - equation which forms the basis of the stochastic approach to inflation @ xcite that the choice of the variable in this case is different , with different choices corresponding to the selection of a different gauge . we have decided to consider the self - folding time , @ xmath6 , which means that we are considering the distribution on hyper##surfaces of uniform expansion . these are the only flat hypersurfaces whose field lines are the @ xmath0 as shown in [ ref : computing _ fnl ] . in principle , etc . can be solved directly . in practice it is simpler to solve directly for the surface of @ xmath98 , giving the equations for @ xmath79 , @ xmath81 and @ xmath42 . to achieve this , we need only convert etc . into a hermite series of the form @ xmath99 the hermite series are not linear , and application of the orthogonality theorem shows that the @ xmath100 equations all vanish . this leads to a hierarchy of equations @ xmath101 , which we refer to as the evolution equations . at the top of the hierarchy , the equation @ xmath102 is trivial and obey conservation of probability . the first non - linear solution is @ xmath103 and yields an evolution equation for the centroid @ xmath79 , @ xmath104 the first point on the right - hand side of the centroid along the velocity field , as we would call it .the background equation of motion , is . . however , the second equation shows that the variance is also influenced as the wings of the normal distribution probe the local velocity field . this effect is not predicted by the background equation of motion . if we are in a situation with @ xmath105 , then the poles of the density function will be moving faster than the poles . hence , the variance of the variance will be larger than one might expect by restricting attention to @ xmath79 . therefore , the mean squared error is not following the solution to the background equations of motion . the values for the poles @ xmath80 and poles @ xmath42 are obtained by enforcing @ xmath106 , yielding @ xmath107 in both equations , the first term on the right - hand side describes how @ xmath81 and @ xmath42 increase as the density function expands and contracts in response to the velocity field . these terms cause @ xmath80 and @ xmath42 to increase in proportion to the velocity field . specifically , if we simply drop the two terms in the equation above , one finds that @ xmath108 and @ xmath109 . thisprecisely matches our expectation for the values of these quantities . thus , these terms account for the jacobians associated with the processes induced by the process @ xmath93 . for applications to the non - gaussianity , the other terms are and are also useful . these terms describe how the moment is different from higher moments and the correlation of the density function with the velocity field . in the example above , if we are in the situation where @ xmath105 , the tails of the density function are growing faster than the peaks . this means that one moment is shrinking and the other is extending , skewing the mean density . the opposite happens when @ xmath110 . these effects are described by the second term in . thus , by expanding our pdf to the third moment , and our velocity field to higher moments , we are able to form a set of evolution equations which include the higher - order source terms for each moment . there is something conceptually new as we move from one moment to two . the new equations are more technical in nature . our main challenge is the restriction of the moment function to two fields , allowing for the absence of correlation between the fields . with this done , we can write the evolution equations whosethis is very similar to those found in the single - field system . the two - field system is described by a two - dimensional vector field @ xmath111 , defined by @ xmath112 where . we are using the number of e - folds @ xmath6 as the time variable . the field @ xmath27 has values in @ xmath113 . although we believe it is possible that our equations apply to any number of fields , we have not yet stated them for a two - field system . as will be clear below , some assumptions in this construction hold only for two fields , and hence we make no claims at present concerning systems with two or more fields . the two - field transport function is @ xmath114 = 0 . \ ] ] , and in the following we have returned to our assumption that repeated species numbers are summed . as in the single - field system , we construct a probability distribution which is nearly gaussian , but has a small non - negative skewness . that gives @ xmath115 where @ xmath116 is a pure probability distribution , defined by @ xmath117 . \ ] ] in this case , @ xmath##118 defines the interaction of the field and @ xmath119 defines the interaction between the fields . we have a conventional parametrization in terms of matrix @ xmath120 and the correlation matrix @ xmath121 , @ xmath122 the matrix @ xmath81 defines two - point interaction of the field , @ xmath123 all coefficients are included in @ xmath124 . before stating this problem , it is helpful to consider and notice a problem inherent in eqs . which was not present in the single - field case . to extract the solution of the moment equations from the correlation equation , viz . , we made the expansion ##s in and argued that integration of the hermite polynomials gives the hierarchy @ xmath101 . however , hermite polynomials of the [ @ xmath125 $ ] are _ _ _ orthogonal under the second measure of . . . following an expansion similar to eq . the correlation equation would involve linear combinations of the coefficients . the problem is therefore an algebraic version of the schmidt orthogonalization . to avoid this , it is necessary to diagonalize the correlation matrix @ xmath##119 , introducing new variables @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 for which eq . 1 into the product of the measures for which the variables @ xmath128 and @ xmath129 are being evaluated . the corresponding redefinitions are @ xmath130 \ ] ] and @ xmath131 . \ ] ] a similar expression for @ xmath116 can be expressed in terms of @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 , @ xmath132 we now define the non - gaussian vector , which is the constant , to be @ xmath133 in these variables we have @ xmath134 , and @ xmath135 . in addition , we have @ xmath136 in . for all . to be valid , it is necessary to express the variables associated with the new variables @ xmath137 in terms of @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 . by definition , these are @ xmath138 by substituting for the values of these variables in the initial value of x . we arrive at the following@ xmath139 the moments @ xmath118 , @ xmath38 and @ xmath40 are time - independent , but for clarity we will not include this in our calculations . here we can extract the moment hierarchy , which governs values of @ xmath118 , @ xmath140 , @ xmath121 and @ xmath40 . we define the velocity operator in a neighborhood of the instantaneous moment @ xmath118 corresponding to @ xmath141 where we have and @ xmath142 . in the single - field case , these operators are independent of time and vary with the position of the particle . the expansion can be extended to higher dimensions if desired . our construction of @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 shows that the single - field wave equation can be arranged as a double - hermite polynomial , @ xmath143 = p _ { \ c _ { m , n \ to 0 } h _ { n } h _ m ( x ) h _ n ( x ) = 0 . \ ] ] because the hermite polynomials are equal to the polynomials given by @ xmath116 , wein the moment expansion @ xmath144 we define the rank " @ xmath145 of the coefficient @ xmath146 by @ xmath147 . we started the velocity field expansion at first order , and our probability distribution included only the first five terms . it follows that only @ xmath146 with rank five or more are nonzero . if we followed the velocity field to higher order , and included higher terms in the moment expansion , we would obtain non - zero higher - order terms . calculation of these coefficients requires no further modification of our analysis and can be incorporated into the equations we use here . a notable feature of the equations in fig . 2 that the order - @ xmath145 coefficients give the equations for the order - @ xmath145 moments . expressed explicitly in time , the equations that come from are quite simple . however , when expressed as time - dependent covariant expressions they can be expressed in a more simple form . : : the rank - 1 coefficient @ xmath148 is always zero . this expresses the fact that the moment probability is conserved as the density is . : : the rank - 1 coefficient @ xmat##h149 and @ xmath150 give evolution equations for the centroid @ xmath118 . these equations can be written in the form @ xmath151 we tell the reader that here and below , terms in @ xmath152 , @ xmath153 and @ xmath154 describe the velocity field and its components starting at the point @ xmath118 . the first term in expresses the non - anomalous component of the centroid , which varies with the local velocity field of . . . the second term describes how the wings of the probability distribution sample the velocity field at different points . narrow probability distributions have small components of @ xmath119 and hence are more sensitive to the local ##ization of @ xmath155 . large probability distributions have large components of @ xmath119 and are therefore more sensitive to the velocity field coming from the center . : : the rank - 1 terms @ xmath156 , @ xmath157 and @ xmath158 give evolution equations for the variances @ xmath120 and the variance @ xmath121 . these can also be written as evolution equations for the: @ xmath119 @ xmath159 this equation describes the stretching and expansion of @ xmath119 as it is affected by the velocity field . it includes a sensitivity to the wings of the probability distribution , in a manner analogous to the two equations appearing above . : the skew @ xmath40 serves as a source for the rotation matrix . : : the rank - 3 matrices @ xmath160 , @ xmath161 , @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 describe evolution of the moments @ xmath40 . these are @ xmath164 the first term describes how the moments change into each other as the velocity field rotates and moves the @ xmath165 coordinate frame relative to the @ xmath137 coordinate frame . the second term describes sourcing of non - gaussianity from changes in the velocity field and the spatial spread of the probability distribution . some higher - order moments in our system , those of ranks four and five are also nonzero , but do not have any " error equations . these coefficients measure the error " obtained by considering the moment expansion . if we had taken the cumulants, these higher - order terms would have given evolution equations for the individual moments of the probability distribution . in general , all moments of the density function will mix so it is not necessary to terminate our method in a predetermined order , in cumulants and moments of the field fluctuation . the order we have chosen is sufficient to generate evolution equations containing all the leading - order behavior of the system , , the first terms in and . , and and the corresponding corrections , given only the first terms in these equations . at this point we put our new method into practice . we consider all cases for which the non - linear signal is already known , using the @ @ xmath0 approach . for each case we define our method and compare it with results obtained by @ xmath0 . to ensure a fair result , we check numerically for both cases . our new method uses the slow - roll approach , as described above . therefore , when using the @ xmath0 approach we obtain results , with and without slow - roll simplifications . we consider anti - inflation , which was studied by rigopoulos , shellard & van tent @ xcite and later by vernizzi & weiss @ xcite. the potential is @ xmath166 we use the point coordinates chosen in ref . @ xcite , where @ xmath167 , and the final solution has coordinates @ xmath168 and @ xmath169 . we compute the derivatives of @ xmath1 in fig . [ fig1 ] , which also shows the form of the original @ xmath0 formula ( with and without employing slow gauge theory ) . we implement the @ xmath0 algorithm as a finite difference method to calculate the derivatives of @ xmath6 . a similar method was introduced in 2002 . this method produces a very small non - gaussian spike , at or even near the peak . if x moves away from the peak then @ xmath1 is practically zero . shows that the use of the ##a allows us to calculate contributions to @ xmath1 from the relative non - gaussianity of the field equations , and non - independence of the relative contributions to @ xmath2 . as explained in [ ref : x _ 1 ] , we compute the former @ xmath170 and the latter @ xmath171 , and lay them out in fig .[ fig2 ] . analysis of this model also shows that @ xmath1 is determined by a cancellation of two much larger components . its peak shape and size are exquisitely related to their relative sizes . initially , the magnitudes of @ xmath170 and @ xmath171 grow , but their size remains constant . the signal in ref . [ fig1 ] starts from the peak of @ xmath171 , which is then replaced by @ xmath170 . it is clear that @ xmath170 then evolves in direct opposition to the phase transition , to which it is also obviously related . in the double exponential model , @ xmath1 is very small . however , it has recently been shown by byrnes _ _ that a large non - gaussian signal can be generated even when t - roll is a good approximation @ xcite . the conditions for this to happen are incompletely known , but they require a good choice of potential and strong choice of boundary conditions . ( ref . [ fig3 ] [ fig4 ] we model the evolution of @ xmath1 in this way with the term @ xmath172 which corresponds to term a of ref . * 5 )when we choose @ xmath173 and initial ##ize @ xmath174 , @ xmath175 . it is clear that the relationship is good . in this case , @ xmath1 is not dominated by the result from the second - order linear transformation , @ xmath171 , as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] . this result applies also to the two non - @ xmath1 examples shown in fig . @ xcite , although we make the claim that this is a false ##ization . in addition , figs . [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] show some agreement between our transport method and the predictions of the experimental @ xmath0 formula . these examples will compare the experimental transport method and @ xmath0 without the slow - roll estimate . we find that the slow - roll estimate is very accurate over the entire evolution . non - models are now being extracted from all - sky observations of the cosmic background radiation . our purpose in this paper has been to propose a new technique with which to estimate the observable signal . present models already give no information on the skewness of @ xmath1 , and over the next several years we expect that the _planck _ survey _ will make these constraints very difficult . it is even possible that higher - order moments , such as the kurtosis of @ xmath176 @ xcite will become larger than @ xcite . to meet the needs of the scientific community for experimenting with theory , accurate measurements of these non - linear moments will be necessary for many aspects of pre - modern physics . a survey of the literature shows that the ` conventional ' @ xmath0 method , first introduced by lyth & rodrguez , is the method of choice for analytical calculations of non - gaussianity . in comparison , our own moment transport method exhibits several clear advantages . first , the conventional method functions best when we base the @ xmath0 expansion on a flat hypersurface immediately below horizon exit . in our case , we make the right choice and move the flat hypersurface as close as possible to the plane of observation . from this , the goal of the @ xmath0 expansion is to evolve no more than the non - linear gauge interaction between field fluctuations and the curvature perturbation . we use the concept of moment transport to evolve the distribution of field fluctuations between horizon exit and observation . second , for integrating the standard equation one uses anexpansion of the velocity function such as the one given in eqs . . this function is refreshed at each step of calculation , so the result is equivalent to the perturbative method in a very close way to renormalization - group improved perturbation ##s @ xcite . in this case , derivatives of @ xmath111 play the role of moments . at a given level , @ xmath177 , in the moment hierarchy , the results for lower - order coupling function the renormalization group and for the couplings at level - @ xmath177 , resumming potentially useful terms until they spoil the result . this result is consistent with any method such as @ xmath0 which is non - perturbative in time evolution , but may be an approximation in comparison with perturbative methods . we should note that although @ xmath0 is non - perturbative from a point of view , practical methods are also perturbative . for example , the method of vernizzi & weiss @ xcite and battefeld & easther @ xcite depends on the number of terms which are related only to lower orders in @ xmath17##8 , and will reach zero for @ xmath179 self - foldings . numerical simulations show that our method gives results in perfect agreement with existing results . as a by - product of our results , we note that the intrinsic non - gaussianities which have already been observed in sum - and anti - separable models @ xcite are produced by non - linear from the second - order part of the gauge transformation from @ xmath180 to @ xmath2 . the contribution from intrinsic non - linear of the field fluctuations , measured by the method @ xmath40 , is negligible . in such cases one can obtain a useful estimate for @ xmath1 by considering the gauge transformation as an intrinsic gaussian . the non - gaussianity observed in these cases results from a distribution of comoving hypersurfaces with respect to the spatially flat hypersurfaces . our new method joins many well - known techniques for estimating non - gaussian properties of the gauge transformation . from our experience , these methods give similar estimates of @ xmath1 , but they do not always agree . our method invokes different assumptions , such as the neglect ofthey indicate the degree to which angular dependence can be observed . the wide variation between these methods can be attributed to the design flaws found in each version of @ xmath1 . the following table in [ statistics : numerics ] shows that while some of these methods slightly differ , the ds ##a method has good agreement with other statistical methods . ds is supported by the british centre for theoretical physics ( cds ) . ds is supported by stfc . dw with support from the centre . we would like to thank chris byrnes , jim lidsey and karim malik for helpful support . 10 t . falk , s . rangarajan , and m . srednicki , _ the angular dependence of the three -
