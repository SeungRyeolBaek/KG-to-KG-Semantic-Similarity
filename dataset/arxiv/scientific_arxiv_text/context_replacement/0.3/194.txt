the new scalar field with parameters @ xmath10 @ xmath11 gev ( atlas ) @ xcite , @ xmath12 gev ( atlas ) @ xcite , recently discovered in the lhc , has properties consistent with those of the long - period higgs particles of the standard model ( sm ) @ xcite . this also implies that the landau pole of the higgs self - assembly is well below the einstein gravity parameter @ xmath13 gev ( see , e . g . ref . ) , in the sm , the particle is stable , but possibly with a mass exceeding that of the universe by several orders of magnitude @ xcite . without the discovery of any further new particles , the sm is still an entirely self - consistent , weakly - interacting , effective field theory all the way up to the planck scale ( see ref . @ xcite for a detailed discussion ) . nevertheless , it is clear that the sm is unstable . in a number of fine - tuning problems ( such as the gravity and the cp problems ) , the sm is in conflict with the observations of non - zero # ##s , the conservation of matter over antimatter in the sm , and the presence of anti - bar##yonic dark matter . the most powerful theory that can account successfully for neutrino ##s and oscillations , baryogenesis , and dark matter , is the neutrino - mass theory ( @ xmath14msm ) @ xcite . it assumes the existence of the neutral neutral particle ( hnl ) and provides a guideline for the expected experimental sensitivity @ xcite . the search for these hnls is the focus of the present document . in addition to hnls , the detector will be subjected to several other types of physics experiments that produce weakly interacting elementary particles with a slow decay of the detector volume , see e . g . , . longer times and stronger couplings would be accessible compared to the experiments performed previously in the same experiment @ xcite . in the beginning of this document the theoretical motivation for hnl searches is presented in section [ sec : theo ] and the results from the experimental searches are then detailed in section [ sec : exp _ status ] . the actual experimental set - up is presented in section [ sec : exp ] and in section [ sec : bg ] the background effects are discussed , before the expected sensitivity is presented in section [ sec : er ] . the conclusions ofsee in section [ 1 : conc ] . in type - i seesaw models ( for a description see ref . @ xcite ) the filling of the sm ##e sector by three left - handed ( neutral ) particles , @ xmath15 , where @ xmath16 , is the leptonic sector similar to the quark sector ( see ref . [ ferm ] ) . irrespective of their masses , these neutral leptons help explain the mass oscillations of the background neutrinos . three different types of hnl ##s , @ xmath17 , are commonly used : msm all electrons have both left - and right - handed components and masses below the planck scale . , title = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 48 . 0 % ] msm [ ##ons have both left - and right - handed components and masses below the fermi scale . , title = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 48 . 0 % ] * models with hnls with @ xmath18gev @ xcite are dominated by grand unified theories . in these models the exotic baryon nature of the universe results from cp - violatingdecays of the hnls , which produces a lepton asymmetry @ xcite . this mass is then transformed into a large mass by sphalerons @ xcite . the large mass of the hnls results in a fine - tuning problem for the higgs mass . a possible solution is provided by low energy supersymmetry but at present this is not supported by experimental evidence . theories with very large scale particles are unable to account for dark matter and can only be further probed by experiments ;

[ taun ] . in [exp ] shows the first region , the @ xmath67 region , using the constraints from particle physics experiments . for the regions in fig . [ exp ] below the line marked ` ` seesaw ' ' , the coupling of the hnl with the neutrinos is too weak to match the expected pattern of the mass distribution . these considerations result in additional limits . if the hnls are required to provide a mechanism for baryogenesis , their coupling with matter should be too weak so that they fall below the bottom line marked ` ` bau ' ' . a hnl with the region to the right of the ` ` bbn ' ' line would take too long in the early universe to result in an overproduction of the helium - 4 in big bang theory @ xcite . the constraints used by the charm @ xcite , cern ps191 @ xcite and nutev @ xcite experiments are also shown . those from bebc @ xcite and ccfr @ xcite are also shown in fig .

[ pthnl ] . in order to maximise the geometric acceptance for a given effective size of the beam , the detection source must therefore be located as close as possible to the target . the production of the charm particles is driven by the spontaneous production of pions , electrons and long - lived light resonances . the spontaneous decays of these particles would result in a large number of muons and neutrinos . to detect these particles , a combination of a target and a neutron absorber of a few mm length , both made of as dense a material as possible , is required . to reduce the total occ##upancy and flux affected by the residual particle flux , a muon shield is required upstream of the hadron source . the experimental set - up must therefore balance the two requirements of placing the detector as close as possible to the source and of placing a sufficiently long muon shield outside of the fiducial volume of the detector to detect muon - related particles . the detector must be able to detect the final state particles from @ xmath71 decays , and be able to detect @ xmath34 . ] detect them , and determine the @ xmath72 invariant mass and the particle decay time with sufficient accuracy to reject backgrounds . to be sensitive to the decays @ xmath73 , @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 in addition to the @ xmath76 decay , a magnetic spectrometer , an electron calorimeter and a muon shield are required . the background particle flux and the residual muon flux in the detector constitute crucial parameters in the design of the detector . interactions of neutrinos inside the fiducial volume can mimic signal events , in particular via charged - particle interactions of anti - neutrinos . thismotivates evacuating the detector volume to a level where such background events are rare ( see section [ 1 : bg ] ) . decay of neutrinos and light in the vicinity of the detector volume , can produce long - lived @ xmath77 mesons , such as charged kaons , which can decay in the detector fiducial volume and cause background events . to observe neutrino - induced @ xmath77 background events from the downstream side of the beam shield , the neutrino background from light induced events must be reduced at the source . this is achieved by the use of target and hadron ##ic materials with the maximum possible focal length . in addition , the muon background must be sufficiently large to reduce light - induced @ xmath77 backgrounds to a level that is comparable to or smaller than the background from light . protection against cosmic rays is also required and the detector could therefore be placed in an electromagnetic field . a description of the observed beam line and its geometry is given below . the simulated hnl decays with @ xmath78 gev . , title = " fig : " , scaledwidth= 49 . 0 % ] [ contrast hnl decays with @ xmath78 gev . , image = " image : " , scaledwidth = 49 . 0 % ] the sps beam energy , beam intensity and the flexibility of the beam structure offer a perfectly good theoretical model for the proposed experiment . the recently completed cern neutrinos to gran sasso ( cngs ) experiment made use of @ xmath79gev pulses from the sps for a full cycle with 200 years of operation , 55 % power availability , and 50 % of the sps supercycle . this gives a total of @ xmath80 pulses on average per year . the experiment described above uses the same amount of beam energy as cngs and the same sps performance . in addition , the detailed design of the operational mode requires several modifications to the sps , maximises the efficiency of the proton beam lines and is compatible with the operation of both the lhc and the north sea fixed source experiments as they are currently operating . increased beam intensity could come as a by - product of a future sps upgrade from a typical beam intensity of about @ xmath81 protons per pulse to @ xmath82 proton##s per sample . the design of the current detector aims at taking advantage of such an upgrade but the detector does not rely on it . from the technical description given above , the design requirements include the choice of a relatively slow extraction to reduce the detector noise per cycle time , and to achieve a simple detector design based on dense matter . at the same time , the recovery time should not exceed significantly the sps cycle time as compared to cngs , and should reduce the constraints on the activation energy in the extraction chamber and the risk of damage to the extraction septum . three options exist , all of which would be acceptable from the point of view of the experiment , but the optimal one requires further consideration : * an extraction with a spill length of @ xmath83s . this would produce a @ xmath84s sps spill cycle , and consequently a reduction of the number of beams on target by 50 % ; * a quasi - pulsed slow extraction of o ( 1ms ) ; * an extraction similar to that of cngs of o ( @ xmath85s ) . the last two options are extraction with the sps rf system , and the beams debunched . this produces a quasi - pulsed spill that isor with a continuous detector readout , as described in fig [ ssec : synergy ] . the latter two extraction methods result in a lower detector occupancy . with detection of @ xmath86s , the large number of @ xmath49 ##s decay before mixing with the target , regardless of the target material . however , the flux of the electrons and holes , which give rise to a substantial muon flux from decays in flight , can be greatly reduced by the use of a dense target material with a short interaction length . for example , the use of aluminum , rather than copper , reduces the number of interacting pions and kaons by an order of magnitude . a 10 m long long tube would suffice . however , the beam energy spectrum must also be diluted in order to avoid causing thermal shock waves in the detector and to allow effective heat extraction . it may be possible to extract the entire beam line from water vapor . since the neutrinos produced in charm beams , which can mix with hnls , have in any case a very high transverse energy ( see fig . [ pthnl ] ) , there is no need to have a small beam line . the beam line iscan only be driven forward by the design requirements and constraints . for the same reason , the experiment does not impose any constraints on the physical properties of the extracted beam . the effect of the beam energy deposition mentioned above may therefore be achieved by allowing the transverse size of the beam to vary in a dedicated section of the beam transfer line , and by using a pair of orthogonally deflecting permanent magnets to produce a lissajous sweep of the target , similar to the lhc beam dump . preliminary investigation shows that it should be possible to achieve a beam transverse size of about @ xmath87 mm on the target and a beam width of 10 centimeters , with the only limitation being the beam divergence rather than the natural divergence of the produced hnls . the losses in the straight section leading to the target must be controlled and reduced to reduce the background neutrino flux . the use of a slow beam would simplify the beam design . to avoid damage to the target caused by mechanical failures in the beam design , the beam current would need to be interlocked with the field currents in the dedicated transfer line . the entire target would be required to have a field current of @ xmath88kw , corresponding to @ x##math89 ##2 per @ xmath90s / @ xmath79gev . further thermo - chemical studies will be required in order to produce a suitable target . to stop the remaining charged particles and electrons before they occur , a hadron absorber will immediately follow the target . by surrounding the target , the absorber will also stop electrons and ions at large angles which may also produce muons that fill the fiducial volume due to large angle scattering . the shield will also provide the first layer of lateral radiation shielding , as well as absorbing the residual non - interacting particles ( @ xmath91 of the downstream proton beam ) and the electromagnetic radiation trapped in the target . the physical requirements of the absorber are determined by the radiological requirements of the muon shield ( see the [ ssec : mushield ] below ) . as part of the absorber , a concrete shielding wall will cut - off the target beam volume from the downstream muon beam volume . the proton flux of the hadron beam is estimated from a sample of @ xmath92 @ xmath93 , generated with nuclei with a proton binding energy of 400gev and afixed proton target . the prompt component of the muon source originates from the electromagnetic decays of meson particles , namely @ xmath94 , @ xmath95 , @ xmath96 , @ xmath97 . the non - prompt component originates mainly from the decay and flight of alpha particles and electrons . for the present case , only the decay of primary pi and kaons are considered as non - prompt sources . secondary , tertiary , or higher order pi and kaon decays should have a uniform background spectrum that is more easily detected than the high - energy primary pi and kaon decays that impose the limits of the particle interaction length . the exact radial extent of the radiation shield can be defined based on a computer simulation to ensure that the particles from higher order decay , which generally have different polar angles , are not absorbed . the proton target and the proton absorber described above will be able to detect the decay . thus , a fraction @ xmath98 of the particles in the absorber will decay into muons before detection , where @ xmath99 is the interaction length of hadrons in the proton absorber ; @ x##math100 is the decay rate of the hadron and @ xmath101 , @ xmath102 and @ xmath45 are the decay lifetime , lab momentum and rest mass ; and @ xmath103 is the mass required for the decay of the hadron to muons ( 100 % for @ xmath104 and 100 % for @ xmath105 , other muon - like decay channels are neglected ) . a cross - check with the muon flux observed in the ` ` ` proton dump ' ' experiment @ xcite shows that the above formula for estimating the ` ` first - generation ' ' decay rate is the total rate of decay . the total decay flux is shown as a function of the lab momentum in question . [ 1 : muonfluxes ] . the muons from these events represent a small fraction of the total decay rate . @ xmath93 events occur with pythia with a proton beam of 400 gev and a single proton proton ( see text for details ) . the total flux of first - generation muons above a constant mass is shown . , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] . [ fig: muonfluxes ] indicates that if a device were put in place to stop muons below 350gev , the proton flux would be reduced by about two orders of magnitude to 1 ( 1 ) billion per @ xmath92 m on target . however , the muon - induced @ xmath77 production rate from decay would still be higher than that of the ##s that is computed in the [ sec : bg ] . instead , the detector will use a neutron trap that effectively stops nuclei with energies of up to 400gev , which requires a total of 52 m of uranium ( or 40 m of lead ) @ xcite . . . , scaledwidth = 1 . 5 % ] the proposed configuration of the beam line and detector will be based on an analysis of the proton # ##over , the target design , the neutron absorber and the resulting shield design , and the number of protons on target . the proposed beam line layout as described above is shown in fig . [ fig : 1 - sketch ] . the proposed beam line arrangement consists of a proton beam impinging on uranium @ xmath106 m on target , followed by a neutron absorberof @ xmath107 m long , a shielding wall to confine air and radiation , and a @ xmath108 m long lead and silver muon absorber built in steel and concrete . the experiment uses a new drift section from the existing beam line , which can be very similar to the one already used for the cngs facility . a short section of the line , consisting almost entirely of drift length to allow the beam energy density to be increased , will then bring the high energy protons to the target bunker that contains the target and the beam absorber . the design of the experiment should be such that it allows use of existing facilities . in particular , the facility will need to be provisioned with the equipment to reduce air and radiation contamination , to comply with radiation protection standards . the site should also be well within the cern boundaries . the construction and operation of the beam line and the facility can be such that the damage caused to running equipment is minimal . depending on these requirements and constraints , the target area could be a suitable site with a relatively short beam line of a few hundred metres , branching - off from tt20 , with a new beam line leading to the tdc2 target bunker . the beam line couldcould be arranged to allow the dedicated observation point to point to a target bunker of sufficient size and distance from the tcc2 target area to enable the excavation of the soil . further tests would be required to determine the exact location . a 10 m trenched area after the target bunker would enable the installation of the blast shelter , and an area at relatively high elevation just outside the target area hall would provide a suitable location for the location of the proposed detector area . the location of the proposed target area close to the tcc2 target area suggests that it may be possible to benefit from the environmental needs that are already met for the current target area in terms of activated water and air pollution . the detector consists of a small decay volume measured by the probe . for a given detector aperture , the detector diameter should be small . in the discussion , the 5 m aperture of the lhcb spectrometer @ xcite is used as a realistic example . the [ length ] shows a comparison of the length of the detector for only a single detector element and for all longitudinally aligned detector elements . for a given hnl lifetime and detector aperture , the number of hnls decaying in the apparatus with the decay products going through the spectrometerand as a function of the size of the detector . the use of two magnetic spectrometers increases the detector size by 50 % compared to a single detector . therefore , the combined detector will have two almost identical detector elements as depicted in fig . [ detector ] . a design of a third detector element is also shown in fig . [ detector3d ] . to reduce to a sufficient level the noise produced by interactions of neutrinos with the remaining particles and the decay volume , a vacuum of less than @ xmath109 mbar will be required ( see figure [ sec : bg ] ) . each detector element therefore consists of a @ xmath11050 m long cylindrical vacuum vessel of 5 m diameter . the two @ xmath111 m constitute the decay chamber and the subsequent 5 m are used for the magnetic spectrometer . the combined calorimeter and the detector have a diameter of 5 m . the magnetic detector includes a 4 m long dipole magnet , two tracking layers upstream of the magnet , and two tracking layers downstream of the magnet ( see fig . [ detector ] ) . for the required level of noise , the detector layer thickness and temperature are adjusted to give a similar contribution to themagnetic spectrometer ##s ( see ref . [ magfield ] ) . for vacuum chambers with @ xmath110120 @ xmath112 m resolution and with 1 . 5 % @ xmath113 , including those currently being used for the na62 experiment @ xcite , recent studies indicate that 1 . 5 m is shared between the chambers , giving @ xmath114 m length for each magnetic spectrometer . an iron calorimeter is located in each vacuum chamber for @ xmath115 reconstruction and lepton identification . the calorimeter itself is a modification of the electron filter for the original experiment , which consists of an iron chamber surrounded by a vacuum chamber . an additional tracking station at the end of each decay chain can be used to veto upstream particles entering the detector volume . these stations will also detect downstream particle interactions . for a mass @ xmath78gev , 75 % of the @ xmath72 decay products have both collided with mass @ xmath116gev . the energy and the mass resolution scales with the magnetic field of the magnets . a 1 . 5tm field integral results in a mass resolution of @ xmath117##mev for @ xmath116gev . ( see fig . [ kl ] ) . for a 1gev hnl this provides a contrast between the decay product and the high mass tail of the magnet @ xmath118 track . the optimisation of the magnetic field will need to take into account the shape of the high mass tail from such decays which may affect the high mass window . decay products with measured momenta in the left and right panels and the momentum spectrum of the decay product in the left panel . the momentum spectrum shown accounts for the measured momenta and is required for the comparison of the two decay products . [ hnl with > 1gev is possible . , scaledwidth = 1 . 0 % ] a feasibility study of a dipole magnet , similar to the lhcb magnet @ xcite , with a free diameter of @ 16m @ xmath119 and a field strength of @ xmath106tm , has been conducted . figure [ x - scketch ] shows a sketch of a magnet which fulfills the requirements of the proposed magnet @ xcite . with a radius with a dimension of @ xmath120m @ xmath121, and using al - 99 . 7 ##m , the resulting magnet has a magnetic field of @ xmath122 t , and is @ xmath123tm with a length of @ xmath124 t . for comparison , the lhcb magnet mentioned above contains @ xmath125 t iron for its yoke , and has three times the power . the proposed experiment will require two @ xmath11050 m high , 10 m diameter vacuum tanks each of which will be identical to that used in the na62 and @ xcite . the @ xmath109 mbar vacuum required to suppress neutrino ##s ( see figure [ sec : bg ] ) , is several orders of magnitude less powerful than the pressure used in the na62 vacuum tank ( @ xmath126 mbar ) and should therefore not represent a significant breakthrough . the tracking stations of the magnetic field will provide high spatial resolution and minimize the contribution from multiple sources . the na62 vacuum - tubes @ xcite , which are manufactured from thin metal terephthalate ( pet ) , are ideal to achieve both of these objectives . gas tightness of these tubes has beenaccuracy in long term experiments and the signal production process is also well understood . the reconstruction of @ xmath115 decay and the detection of electrons would be required to detect targets such as @ xmath127 and @ xmath128 . an electromagnetic calorimeter with a modest energy resolution would therefore greatly improve the scientific accuracy of the proposed experiment . the lhcb shashlik calorimeter has demonstrated the energy resolution of @ xmath129 , which is comparable to the momentum resolution of the proposed mass spectrometer in the 10 to 20gev energy range . the shashlik instrument also provides an optical solution with fine resolution , as well as a resolution greater than a few ns , which will be needed to correlate the target and source information . the sps provides a quasi - continuous record of data on target throughout the experiment period . a dead - timeless memory system such as that used for the lhcb and @ xcite would exist for the proposed experiment . this readout system will record data continuously in 25ns time - slices . the data will be sent back to read - out machines which in turn will send the data to a data - farmto complete the event building . tracks with matching times will be used to find two - dimensional events , and events with matching vertices will be maintained for further analysis . this part of the selection will be executed off - line during the event building , to reduce the data acquisition costs to a certain level . it is expected that storage of @ xmath11010tb / s would be required . the muon shield described above is designed to trap particles with momenta of up to 400gev , thereby reducing collision - related noise to a negligible level . the rate of charged - current interaction ##s ( s ) occurring at the downstream region of the muon shield is calculated by extrapolating from a measurement by per @ xcite , which showed 400gev protons interacting on a cu target . to extrapolate this rate to the cc model , the angular and momentum distributions of the targets are simulated by pythia @ xcite . this results in an average collision rate at the last interaction region of the muon shield of @ xmath130 per @ xmath131 , on average if a cu target were present . as a cross - check geant @ xcite isused to simulate the energy levels produced by a 400gev proton beam hitting a cu target . this yields a cc rate four times larger than the estimate based on the original experiment . replacing the cu target with a cc target lowers the cc rate by @ xmath132 % . the neutrinos from the geant experiment using the cu target are passed to genie @ xcite to simulate the cc and neutral - current ( nc ) neutrino interactions in the muon shield . this yields a mean ( n ) rate of @ xmath133 per unit length per @ xmath131 protons on target . then , this rate is used to evaluate the background . neutrino interactions in the decay volume could be a source of background . in a decay volume filled with water at atmospheric pressure , the above rate translates into @ xmath134 proton interactions per @ xmath131 protons on target . atmospheric pressure in the decay volume of 0 . 01 mbar reduces this background to a lower rate . another source of background is the rate of the neutrino interactions that occur in the nc shield just outside of the decay volume . a combination of geant and genie is used to predictthat in @ xmath114 % of the neutrino ##s between @ xmath135 and @ xmath136 will be emitted . this prediction is consistent with measurements by nomad @ xcite . for the first 5 m of the decay volume decay - leading vertices are both from @ xmath135 and @ xmath137 decay . for the remaining 5 m of the decay volume @ xmath138 % of two - prong vertices are from @ xmath139 decay . choosing one of the two decay products to be interpreted as a proton , yields @ xmath140 two - prong vertices and @ xmath131 protons w target . due to their different sizes , the theoretical mass of @ xmath139 decay products is significantly larger than that of hnl decay products . figure [ source : kl - w - 1 ] shows the invariant mass of these products together with their point of origin approach ( ip ) when sent back to the w target . with a 1gev invariant mass for the signal . , title = " source : " , scaledwidth = 48 . 0 % ] with a 1gev invariantas for the signal . , [ = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 48 . 0 % ] the ip @ xmath141 m reduces this background to the number of candidates for @ xmath131 protons on average , while the average of all other candidates is below 1 % . the ip of m could then be used to reject the background effects from the interactions in the surrounding material , like the vacuum tube or the plasma , and from cosmic rays . backgrounds that originate from these interactions could be vetoed from all the associated activity produced in the surrounding material , especially the lepton in cc interactions . this background has not been detected yet using the above yields and could be used to reduce the background to a negligible level . further detailed simulation work will be undertaken to determine the position of the ground stations at the bottom of the detector volume . if found to be advantageous , the first two lengths of both the proton shield and the muon filter could be instrumented in order to determine the products of neutrino interactions . the success of the simulation experiment depends on the final method used to reconstruct the background , and the number of interactions between the neutrino generations and the hnl##s . the region in @ xmath142 that will be used for the proposed experiment is then estimated by assuming only the charm @ xmath143 is used and considering the production of @ xmath144 . the relationship between @ xmath142 and @ xmath68 is discussed in ref . @ xcite . as detailed in section [ 1 : exp _ status ] , the present expected signals for @ xmath142 come from the charm of @ xcite and are at the @ xmath41 region for a mass of 0 . 5gev and a region at @ xmath145 for a mass of 1gev . the most optimal region for @ xmath146 is between @ xmath41 and @ xmath147 . the expected number of observed signals for the proposed experiment is given by @ xmath148 where @ xmath149 is the total number of events on charm , @ xmath150 is the ratio of the @ xmath151 decay cross - section with respect to the charm cross - section ( the ratio that accounts for the fact that charm is produced in charm ) , @ xmath152is the decay energy and @ xmath153 is the ratio of the decay and decay branching rates of the hnls . the quantity @ xmath152 can be calculated as the product of the probability that the hnls decay in the same direction and the trigger and reconstruction probability . the probability of decay is calculated with simulated experiments for all values of @ xmath142 and the efficiencies are estimated to be 100 % . the dependence on the hnl lifetime introduces a @ xmath142 dependence in @ xmath152 . since the factors @ xmath153 and @ xmath152 both depend on a factor @ xmath142 , this results in an overall @ xmath154 dependence . for @ xmath155 , an hnl lifetime of 1gev , @ xmath156 , @ xmath157s and @ xmath158 , @ xmath159 ##s produced @ xmath160 events would be observed , several orders of magnitude greater than the amount that would be observed in the charm region . for a system in the cosmologically closed region with @ xmath##161 , @ xmath162s and @ xmath163gev , the fully reconstructed @ xmath164 events would be expected in the current experiment . the new theory allows the reconstruction of decay modes with a neutral particle in the final state such as @ xmath75 , where the @ xmath165 , allowing the signal strength to be measured . channels with neutral , such as @ xmath166 , could also be reconstructed , allowing a significant increase in the yields and the parameter @ xmath167 to be measured . the decay modes with a neutral neutrino in the final state , e . g . @ xmath168 , are more challenging to select , since the measured mass will have a different distribution that could be distinguished from the background levels of particle flux ##es . both the background levels and the neutral neutrino flux could be measured by the experiment itself . the neutrino flux from charm - meson decays is more difficult to measure experimentally . a study of the @ xmath169 distribution of decay events in the calorimeter together with existing 400gev pcu data @ xcite and a computer simulation will provide a normalisation. in summary , for a hnl value of 2gev the proposed experiment has the potential for the cosmologically favoured region with @ xmath146 between @ xmath41 and a few times @ xmath170 . multiple beam experiments of the type proposed could be performed using both the fermilab and kek laser beams . the beams considered are the 800gev and 120gev fnal beams with @ xmath171 protons on target and @ xmath172 proton on target , respectively ; and the kek 30gev beam with @ xmath173 proton on target . at fnal , the 800gev beam would have a similar hnl result to that of the proposed sps experiment , i . e . the increased proton intensity would have largely accounted for the increase in the beam cross - section at the energy @ xcite . however , a much larger laser beam would be required due to the higher beam energy , which would be much more expensive , leading to a significant lack of acceptance . the fnal 120gev beam would have a factor 1 higher event yield than at the proposed sps experiment , while the kek beam would have a factor 1 . 5 event yield, the latter estimate has a significant uncertainty due to the poor resolution of the charm cross - section at high energies . the sensitivity of a colliding particle detector at the cern lhc is estimated at a luminosity of 1000fb @ xmath174 and an energy of 14tev , as is expected after three to four years of planning for the high energy experiment . the hnl detector site is expected to be about 60 m ##rad from the target , and 50mrad off - axis , in order to avoid the lhc beam path . the predicted hnl energy yield would be a factor approximately slightly larger than for the original sps experiment . although masses of the hnls are estimated to be in the gev - range , it is possible that they are heavier than @ xmath49 ##5 . if the hnls are heavier than @ xmath1105gev , they can be produced by large hadron decays . the most efficient hnl production mechanism with @ xmath175 decay would be the semileptonic @ xmath176 decays and the total detector mass would therefore be reduced to less than @ xmath177gev . the hcross - section for the decay of beauty particles with respect to h mesons means that the limits that could be derived from the proposed experiment at the lhc would be about four orders of magnitude weaker than those from classical decays . these limits would not be equal to the expected limits from the theoretical model of the baryon asymmetry . the sps at cern is considered the ideal facility to host the proposed experiment to search for hnls . the proposed experiment would search for new physics in the previously unknown domain of new , very large beauty particles with masses below the planck limit . this domain is inaccessible to the lhc experiments and to existing experiments at other research facilities . the proposed detector is dependent on existing experiments and therefore has a substantial r & d budget . a moderately sized team could build the entire detector in a few years . the design of the beam line is complex , in particular , the beam extraction and beam design , as well as the radiological aspects require further study . the solutions proposed are being actively discussed with physics experts . the impact that a design of the hnl would have on particle physics is difficult to overestimate . in short , it could solve one of the most important problems of the sm : the origin ofthe gravitational expansion of the universe , the generation of # ##s . in addition , the results of this experiment , together with astronomical and astrophysical data , could be used to determine the nature of dark energy . we are grateful to g . arduini , g . calviani , j . grenier , j . gschwendtner and j . vincke for stimulating discussions and providing information on the beam line and the target . we would like to thank m . rademakers for providing the three dimensional model of the target . w . flegel is warmly thanked for adapting the design of the lhcb experiment to our needs . we are grateful to v . gninenko and v . rozanov for stimulating discussions and to e . van herwijnen for setting up our web site . g . aad _ et al . _ , atlas collaboration , phys . * , 716 * ( 2012 ) 1 , arxiv : astro -
