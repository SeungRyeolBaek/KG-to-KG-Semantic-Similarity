almost all such measurements are performed via electromagnetic waves . the development of accurate gravitational wave measurements in the next decade or so will thus be a significant challenge for astronomers . in addition , since the emission of photons and gravitons could occur at a fundamental level , gravitational waves emitted by cosmologically - distant ` ` space - time sirens , ' ' such as two pairs of massive black holes , could be used as potential new sources of physics on cosmological scales . black holes with mass @ xmath0 are present at the center of several massive galaxies ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? ) such galaxies collide over cosmic distances , their central black holes exploding , releasing @ xmath1 sources of dark energy in the form of gravitational waves ( hereafter gws ) . to measure the gws emitted by these cosmologically - distant space - time sirens , esa and nasa will build the laser interferometer space telescope , lisa . gws emitted by black hole binaries have the # ##ity of providing a direct measurement of the closest light , @ xmath2 , to the black hole , without further calibration . owing to the highlycoherent measurements of gw include @ xcite , the stress ( or strain ) , @ xmath3 , pressure , @ xmath4 , and the value , @ xmath5 , of the second order ( quadrupolar ) gw inspiral ##ity scale , @ xmath6 ^ { 5 / 3 } f ^ { 2 / 3 } } { d _ c } , \ \ \ dot [ ( t ) & \ propto & \ dot [ ( 1 + 1 ) d _ c \ right ] ^ { 5 / 3 } f ^ { 2 / 3 } , \ dot { t } \ ] ] where @ xmath7 is the two primary gw sources , @ xmath8 , the black hole with ` ` b ' ' mass and @ xmath9 ' redshift . provided the gw source can be more accurately observed at the surface , the direct measurement of the chirping frequency leads to precise measurements of @ xmath3 , @ xmath4 , @ xmath5 and finally @ xmath2 , independently . as shown in fig . [ 1 : 1 ] , lisa b . method allows for the ` ` b ' ' ofgw . in the sky , to determine the viewing distance @ xmath10 deg @ xmath11 at @ xcite . this allows very accurate measurements , e . g . , with errors @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 typically @ xcite . these are independently measured to very high precision ( typically @ xmath14 ; e . g . , @ xcite ) = in addition , the same galactic localization that helps determine the distance to a galaxy accurately can be used to find the host galaxy of a pair of merging black holes seen in lisa . the accurate location of the host galaxy would enable a wide variety of future new black hole discoveries ( see [ ref : newbh ] ) . initially , the methods for finding the host galaxy of a pair of merging black holes were thought to be poor , simply because of the large number of galactic candidates seen in the @ xmath10 deg @ xmath11 lisa and error - free ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) however , however , this idea has been revived , with more positive conclusions @ xcite . using a computer , it is possible to translate the stellar luminosity distance measurementto the gw source into a single redshift slice in which the host galaxy should be located @ xcite . various solutions to the redshift errors that arise in performing this conversion are shown in fig . [ 1 : two ] , for a nearly jupiter - mass system , as a function of the gw source redshift @ xcite . at galaxies @ xmath15 , where many black hole light sources are likely to be found , weak lensing effects due to line - of - sight inhomogeneities ( on top of the above average values ) are the main limitation to the accurate calculation of the redshift slice in which the host galaxy ought to be located . @ xcite have described in detail the possibility that the three - dimensional resolution available ( viewing angle + redshift ##s ) could be used to single out a galaxy , or some other extremely rare object ( such as a star - bust ##er ) , in the lisa error box , after merger . finding such a very rare object post - merger would make it a good host or candidate for the newly - coalesced pair of black holes . = however , it is much more advantageous to use a pre - merger strategy toidentify the host galaxy of a pair of interacting black holes detected by lisa . thus , lisa can provide near real - time gw data in the sky area , in conjunction with the precise timing of the inspiral pulses , to predetermine well in detail where on the earth the merger is occurring . a successful host galaxy identification could then proceed through coordinated observations with other telescopes , thus searching near real time the sky area for possible gravitational signatures , as the coalescence progresses . a variety of mechanisms exist through which dark matter in the form of black hole nuclei can power electromagnetic emission during and after emission @ xcite . for example , at the time of coalescence , @ xmath16 pulses of electromagnetic radiation are transmitted to the recoiling black hole , and its environment , for typical electromagnetic emissions @ xmath17 m / s ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . this would lead to detectable emissions @ xcite and to the accurate identification of a new host galaxy . the exact nature of these electromagnetic emissions remains largely unknown , however . to a large extent , lisa has abilityto detect a long - lived source on the sky is due to the gw signal being modulated as a result of the detector axis revolution and change of orientation when the constellation orbits around the source ( cf . [ fig : one ] ) . even though most of the gw snr changes during the early stages of inspiral / coalescence for typical gw sources , no good information about sky structure will be available well before final coalescence since this information changes slowly , over the long range modulation ( orbital ) timescale . because of significant cross - correlation between sky localization and distance errors , it turns out that this data is probably not valid for measuring distance errors @ xcite . panel [ fig : three ] shows the pre - merger time series of luminosity distance and angular momentum localization errors for a binary black hole pair , @ xmath18 . they improve significantly at early times but their recovery breaks down significantly at late times . according to the panels , by accounting for random orientations of the sources and observation data ( such as best , worst and extreme times ) , accurate information is available days to weeks prior to the final coalescence @ xcite . including black hole pairs in the data has been doneto result in an improvement in the image during the last few minutes to hours prior to coalescence @ xcite . with the widespread availability , by the time lisa is launched , of sensitive wide field - of - view ( fov ) imaging instruments for weak lensing and other applications , it is important to consider the amount of time prior to merger during which the lisa sky area is within the fov of such an event . when this happens , electromagnetic monitoring of the designated sky area , until final fusion , becomes possible . @ xcite have done a detailed study of this possibility , using lsst and the @ xmath19 deg @ xmath11 fov as a reference . the [ fig : 1 ] shows prospects for two equal - mass sources , as a function of their total mass and redshift . the above contours suggest that prospects for electromagnetic monitoring days to weeks before the coalescence are good for detection at redshifts @ xmath13 @ xmath20 . monitoring for the sequence gw ##p ##x to @ xmath21 - @ xmath22 may also be possible @ xcite . a wide variety of new galactic black hole sources would be possible through successful use of thehost galaxies of coalescing black hole pairs . we have only a few examples , and refer the interested parties to @ xcite and @ xcite for further discussions . from the black hole masses , velocity and orbital orientation , all precisely constrained by the gw signal , we would be able to study the physics of the post - merger accretion process onto the host black hole @ xcite with unprecedented accuracy . this would include precise information on the mass distribution of the original source , its emission and composition , and possibly its physical properties . similarly , observations of the original host might inform us about the nature ( hot / wet ) and the timing of the galactic merger that resulted in the black hole pair formation . finally , the orbital parameters , @ xmath23 , for several host galaxies , together with the black hole masses known from the gw signal , would allow us to precisely map the evolution of the @ xmath24 @ xmath23 relation with space velocity , at least for such transitional objects as the hosts of the black hole pairs . another way of successfully mapping the host galaxies of coalescing black hole pairs is the ability to draw a gravitational phase diagram , i . e . onethat relates the optical separation distances , @ xmath2 , of these gw sources to the electromagnetic redshifts , @ xmath9 , of their host galaxies . one of the main advantages of a gravitational distance diagram arises from its relevance to the processes of gravitational radiation . theoretically , a gravitational distance diagram , which is based on direct distance measurements with well - known sources , is not subject to any significant effects from absorption , emission or emission of gws . in practice , however , the value of such a diagram is limited by line - of - sight energy differences , which generate significant lensing uncertainties in the corresponding @ xmath2 measurement ( see ) . [ fig : two ] ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? while the lensing effects can in theory be averaged out over a random line - of - sight , it may not be possible to do so for large pairs of massive black holes if lisa extinction event rates are high ( e . g . , a few times per year at @ xmath25 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?* ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? weak lensing effects in lisa events lead to large uncertainties ranging from @ xmath26 at @ xmath27 to @ xmath28 at @ xmath29 ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ) , which makes the gravitational force diagram difficult even at moderate distances . the extent to which lisa events can be used to construct a global gravitational diagram will likely depend strongly on the spatial distribution of massive black hole merger events with redshifts and the corresponding efficiency of host galaxy identifications . as we see in [ lisa : wd ] , however , studying dwarf mergers into massive black holes may be a formidable challenge for studying cosmology with lisa . the possibility that the rapid expansion of the universe results from a failure of general relativity has fueled much theoretical work on large scale modifications of gravity over the past few years . since building a satisfactory model of global gravitational effects is a formidable challenge , any insight that may be gained from direct theoretical research on the linearized gw regime should not be overlooked . lisa , with its ability to measure the gw emissions from cosmologically - distant galaxies , may well be one ofour model probes of modified gravity on cosmological scales @ xcite . we may expect these modifications to have a large length scale , @ xmath30 , beyond which gravity deviates from general relativity . in order to explain the observed slow expansion of the universe , this scale is expected to be of the order of the current length scale , @ xmath31 . an existence model of gravity of this scale is given by dgp - @ xcite , a braneworld model with an extra spatial dimension . @ xcite suggests the possibility that extra - dimensional modifications of gravity in dgp - gravity scenarios may lead to cosmologically - distant gw objects appearing closer than they actually are , from the loss of gw energy relative to the extra - dimensional bulk . however , in the presence of large distance leakage , flux conservation over the sun - centered hypersphere means that the gw energy increases with distance @ xmath32 from the source as @ xmath33 where @ xmath34 is the maximum number of space - time dimensions available to such modifications . however , for @ xmath35 , it differs from the usual @ xmath36 scaling . in particular , black hole formation events and gravitationalthe galaxies could thus experience the effects of gravity at scales of only a few hubble distances , by comparison to the finite planck distances , which are immune to gravitational leakage effects . this is only one of several possible modified gravity signatures for the gws from cosmologically - distant galaxies @ xcite . this class of signatures is related to the gw velocity signature , with possibly multiple signatures beyond the near - quadrupolar ( @ xmath7 ) signature of general relativity ( e . g . , * ? ? ? . ) that are in relation to the gw propagation velocity which , in modified gravity scenarios , can differ from the speed of light . in this case , the possibility to time the observed gw , relative to an electromagnetic event causally associated with the black hole merger , may offer unique diagnostics of large - scale modified gravity . this could mean , for instance , that the phase of the gw signal differs from general relativistic expectations , as propagated over long distances . @ xcite have explored all the possibilities of measuring photon and graviton arrival times from the same cosmological source . a major problem with this approach is that there must be both theoretical and a priorithe delay in the emission of photons , relative to the emission of gravitons , since the source must necessarily lag behind the incoming binary signal . this difficulty could be overcome if it were possible to determine the relative timing of the photon and graviton signals at the source . due to coalescence , matter present in the near vicinity of the black hole source would be gravitationally accelerated in such a way that it could produce a variable amplitude signal with a frequency closely resembling that of the leading - order quadrupolar perturbation induced by the incoming signal ( see fig . [ fig : 1 ] ) . this would help identify the gravitational counterparts of the gw signals . in addition , it would be possible to match the variability frequencies of the gravitational and gw signals . the offset in phase between the two components of the two signals with similar periods could be used to effectively determine the time delay in electromagnetic emission at the source . the inspiral and transit could be measured via the gw signal , so that the relative timing of the gravitational and electromagnetic signals would be known to be a fraction of the ' s arrival time . any drift in space - time with frequency between the gravitational and electromagnetic chi##rping ##s , as the source spends about a decade at gw frequency during the last 2 years before extinction , could then be attributed to a fundamental drift in the way photons and gravitons propagate over long distances . for example , such a drift could occur if the source is slow , resulting in a time - dependent propagation velocity ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this latter possibility is illustrated graphically in fig . [ 4 : five ] . ) , while gauge invariance has been extensively tested for standard model systems , gauge symmetry could be tested in the gravitational sector , and on large scales ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . with a good enough understanding of the source , gravitational approaches to black hole binary mergers could provide unique tests of symmetry violations in the gravitational sector , via the opportunity to match and track the gravitational and electromagnetic signals in frequency and phase . it would be possible , as the black hole binary moves toward final coalescence , spanning a range of frequencies , to measure the delays in graviton vs . photon propagation , as a result of increasing amplitude of the signal##rping ##s . the consistency test if lorentz violation is satisfied , the gravity sector could be tested directly for gravitons propagated over cosmological distances . to have any opportunity to perform such new applications of particle physics , one would need to observe the electromagnetic effects of coalescing pairs of massive black hole binaries as early as possible . this may be one of the strongest reasons behind ambitious efforts to localize these rare , unexpected events well before their coalescence . as seen before , a large number of data must be accumulated to turn a gravitational force diagram into a high precision tool for analysis . white dwarf frequently evolving into ( moderately ) massive black holes may offer new opportunities in this respect . an additional goal of the lisa project is the detection of gws emitted by massive objects and captured by massive black holes ( the so - called low mass ##less inspirals , or emris ) . @ xcite present a new mass estimation model for this class of lisa events and found that they could be detected with an snr out to a single @ xmath37 gpc . in addition , these authors found that the sky localization errors for these events ( @ xmath38 steradians , @ xmath37gpc ) is comparable to the frequency of black hole binary merger events . no electromagnetic emission is expected from emris of dense massive stars or low - mass black holes . on the other hand , partial ( or partial ) melting of inspiraling low - density white dwarfs ( wds ) could have electromagnetic counterparts and thus help identify candidate galaxies for such events . to the best of our knowledge , the possibility to find the electromagnetic properties of this subclass of lisa emris and use them for astronomical measurements has not been extensively discussed in the literature . as a result of its relatively low density , a typical wd undergoes complete disruption by a non - massive black hole of mass @ xmath39 . this mass limit is equivalent to mass @ xmath40 if the black hole is collapsing rapidly @ xcite . even if the wd were not disrupted , some level of partial melting of its low density outer layers ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ) may be observed during the inspiral ##ing . as the stream of material from the partially disrupted wd shocks against itself or the inspiraling wd ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ) , some level of electromagnetic emission during such emris is expected .a tidally - induced extension of the wd is yet another possibility @ xcite . all these results point to the possibility that electromagnetic counterparts may exist for a subset of all the emris detected at lisa ( the one closest to wd inspirals ) . the fraction of lisa emris which have wds is , therefore , likely to be large @ xcite . if electromagnetic counterparts for a subset of all lisa emris can be detected , the rewards will be enormous . much like black hole mass extinction events , emris with their identified sources and host galaxies could be used to construct a gravitational hubble model , with the significant result that , at distances as low as @ xmath41 @ xmath42 , weak lensing due to line - of - sight effects would be small or absent ( fig . [ 1 : two ] ) and that the @ xmath2 @ xmath9 relation at these low distances is highly sensitive to the dominant dark energy content . dark energy is also significant , affecting the expansion rate and structure of the universe , and at @ xmath2 , at @ xmath43 ( see , e . g . * ? ? ?* for a review ) . indeed , as stated in @ xcite , when cosmic microwave background anisotropies are measured by lisa , @ xmath2 will be known only at @ xmath44 , and a higher resolution ( @ xmath45 ) measurement will provide the best way to constrain the observed parameters . wd emris observations with lisa will occur frequently , and they could perhaps be ruled out on the basis of the comparatively large mass of the inspiraling compact objects . it remains to be determined how the lisa sky brightness error scales with pre - collision ( or pre - collision ) time for such observations and what is the nature of their electromagnetic counterparts . but altogether , the various advantages that we have outlined add to the need for a detailed study of the enormous potential of wd emris for studying cosmology with lisa . for centuries , astronomers have measured distances exclusively with lisa . direct gravitational measurements , gravitational phase diagrams and comparisons between the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational signals offer many new ways to measure distances at cosmological scales . the difficulties inherent in simultaneous , time - independent electromagnetic and gravitational measurements will require that considerable effort be made to reach consensus across the gw and lisa communities .
