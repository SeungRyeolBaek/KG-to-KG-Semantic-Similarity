supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most important extensions of the standard model . this extension solves the naturalness problem and allows strong field theory at the gut scale @ xmath1 . it also assumes the existence of superpartner of the standard model ( sm ) particles . from the above definition , their mass should be in tev range , hence these particles can be discovered in tevatron and large galaxy clusters ( lhc ) . mechanisms of susy breaking and its extension to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) sector is one of the most important problems in the susy phenomenology . in many cases , this problem is related to high energy physics far above the electroweak ( em ) scale , e . g . , gut scale or planck scale . once the mechanism is specified , mass spectrum and flavor distribution of susy particles at the gut scale can be determined by a large number of parameters . thus it may be possible to confirm or predict the mechanism by a search by phase - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) experiments in near infrared . if susy breaking is caused by gravity , the properties of susy particle and of scalars are affected bykhler potential . in the next section , we focus on the no - scale type khler potential , in which the hidden sector and the real sector are described as follows : @ xmath2 where @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 are hidden sector fields and real sector fields , respectively . this type of khler potential was originally described in 1984 . @ xcite with @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 . characteristic properties of the khler potential eq . ( [ q : noscalekahler ] ) are that the vector coupling and trilinear vector couplings ( a - b ) vanish and the coupling constant vanishes @ xcite . the main source of susy breaking are gaugino masses . although this model is not predictive , the phenomenological consequences are obtained with a few assumptions . the separation in eq . ( [ q : noscalekahler ] ) is that couplings of the hidden sector and the real sector are completely invariant , and contributions of susy particles to fcnc are suppressed . so this khler potential is very interesting from the perspective of the susy flavor theory . the no - scale structure of the khlerit is obtained in many cases . it has been shown that in some classes of string theory , for the weakly interacting @ xmath7 heterotic string theory , khler potential becomes the no - boundary type @ xcite . if the hidden sector and the observable field are separated in the superspace density of the supergravity lagrangian , the khler potential is then defined as in e . ( [ eq : noscalekahler ] ) . in the simplest cases , the gaugino potential can be obtained if the hidden sector fields couple to the gauge multiplets via the gauge wave function . recently it has been pointed out that the form e . ( [ e : noscalekahler ] ) is realized only in a two - dimensional model with two branes , namely , the sector scenario @ xcite . in this scenario , the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the hidden sector fields live on the other . it has been shown that the form of the khler potential of the string theory obtained by dimensional analysis is indeed e . ( [ eq : noscalekahler ] ) @ xcite . if the sm ##earing fields dwell in the sector , gaugino masses the su##sy depends on the hidden sector brane to the open sector brane and the no - scale boundary condition is given at the compactification scale of the fifth dimension ( gaugino mass @ xcite ) . in the no - scale scenario , degrees of freedom of susy particle mass distribution is high because the non - universal soft susy particle masses are gaugino mass and higgs breaking mass @ xmath8 at the energy scale where the boundary condition is satisfied . the phenomenological aspects of this problem have been studied in the past , mainly focusing on the mass spectrum . direct upper bounds and the boundary constraint ( i . e . , a charged particle can not be the lsp if the r - parity is negative ) were considered and allowed region in the configuration space was considered . for the boundary condition , the following three cases were considered . first , universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . in this case , the boundary constraint is severe and only the region @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 are allowed since stau tends to be light @ xcite . the second case is that universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . and the third case is that non - universal ga##ugino masses are given at the gut scale . in this case wino , higgsino and sneutrino can be the lsp . in the latter two cases , it is assumed that the cosmological bound is not severer than the first case . in the same paper , current constraints from the lightest higgs for @ xmath11 and the upper limit for @ xmath0 are also used to constrain the no - scale scenario . using these constraints , we will show that almost all the parameter region is excluded when the gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . however , when the above condition is applied above the gut scale , relatively large parameter region is excluded . we also consider the constraint that the non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . we will show that these constraints are satisfied when the higgsino - like neutralino is the lsp . this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : noscalsebc ] , we review the phenomenological aspects of the no - scale scenario , including indications of the local ##ization bounds and the cosmological limits . in section [ sec : higgsbsgamma ] , we will develop these models from the data##ggs mass bound and @ xmath12 result . both of these results for the tevatron are briefly discussed . our results are summarized in section [ 2 : 1 ] . in this paper , we briefly review phenomenological properties of susy models with gut - scale boundary condition , with explanation of the mass bound and direct mass distribution at lep 2 . we consider the following two scenarios . * universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . hereafter we call this case the minimal scenario . * universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale @ xmath13 . throughout this paper , we consider the theory su ( 2 ) to be the one above the gut scale as a good example . * non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . if one of the above boundary conditions is satisfied , mass spectrum of susy particles at the gut scale and their contribution to fcnc can be calculated . in this paper we solve the one - loop level rges to obtain the corresponding susy breaking mass parameters at the gut scale . the higgsino mass parameter @ xmath14 is given by the boundary condition at the one - loop level . next , we discuss the minimal scenario . inthis way , the same boundary condition is given on the corresponding diagram , @ xmath15 where @ xmath16 is the common invariant coupling and @ xmath17 the common trilinear scalar coupling . with this boundary condition , bino and right - handed sleptons are heavier than the susy particles . their masses are equal , @ xmath18 from eq . ( [ fig : minimalmneumtau ] ) we know that the only right - handed slepton is the lsp if the d - term @ xmath19 is zero , i . e . , @ xmath20 . so this parameter region is excluded from the standard model . on the other hand , lep 2 also gives the upper bound on the cross section for smuon - interactions , @ xmath21 for @ xmath22 and @ xmath23 @ xcite , so the parameter region @ xmath24 is shown in fig . [ fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] , allowed regions of the parameter space are shown in the @ xmath25 figure . the difference between the dash - dotted line and the dash -of the dash - and - dash line is excluded by 1 limit and lep 2 bound , smuon pair limit , etc . . the minimal scenario is constrained severely . here we consider the case that the two gaugino masses are both above the gut scale . in the minimal su ( 5 ) case , the left - handed slepton corresponds to 10 - plet , so the weak scale factor makes slepton mass irrelevant . for example , when @ xmath26 the bino mass and the right - handed slepton mass above the gut scale are both given , @ xmath27 . the minimum constraint is constrained severe because the stau parameter is small , and neutralino is the lsp of the large scale of @ xcite . in the fig . [ fig : limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ fig : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , the same results as in the fig . [ fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are shown . but in the minimal case , the stau search function at lep @ xcite is not reduced because mass difference between @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 is largerthan in the gut framework and it can be larger than the smuon model . from these figures we see that the @ xmath29 lsp is invalid unless @ xmath30 is larger than mass 0 . the null stau lsp can also be avoided if gaugino masses at the gut framework are non - zero @ xcite , i . e . , the following boundary condition is satisfied , @ xmath31 this boundary condition can be satisfied naturally in the gut framework @ xcite . in this case , not only bino - like neutralino , but also proton - like , higgsino - like neutralino and sneutrino can be the lsp . for @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 , the lsp is proton - like neutralino . for example , when @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 , then proton mass and then slepton mass are ( note that in this case the left - handed sleptons are smaller than right - handed sleptons ) ; @ xmath36 the higgsino is the lsp if @ xmath37 . for example , when @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 , then the higgsino isand the right - handed slepton mass . @ xmath40 in the two cases given above , neutral ##ino - higgsino is the lsp . in fact from fig . [ fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] - [ fig : limit12r232r0 . 5negmu ] we see that neural ##lo is the lsp in the parameter region , and it is cosmologically invariant . in the previous section we take into account the lep ##n constraint and the second scenario . we find that the minimal case is severely constrained , but the other two scenarios are not . in this section we also include the neutral higgs mass constraint and @ xmath41 constraint . as we will see , with the last two constraint , not only the minimal case but also the other two scenarios can be constrained more effectively . we will consider the possibility whether this scenario can be solved at the tevatron neural ##time or not . before we publish the numerical results , some remarks on our calculation of the higgs mass and @ xmath12 are in order . it is well known that radiative confinement is important when the neutral higgs particle is at @ xcite . in the first case , thelightest higgs mass is evaluated by means of the one - loop level of potential @ xcite . this potential is evaluated at the renormalization level of the joint product of the two loop effects , @ xmath42 . we compared our result with the two - loop result by using _ feynhiggs _ @ xcite , and found that the difference between these two results is smaller than 5 gev as long as @ xmath30 is smaller than 5 . when @ xmath30 is smaller to 5 , the difference can be 10 gev . so , as we will see later , higgs upper bound plays an important rule around @ xmath43 . and the two - loop results can make the higgs mass lighter than that measured at the one - loop level . so our result is conservative and is not significantly influenced by the two - loop results . we found the result , where the lightest higgs mass is lighter than the current 95 % c . p . limit from lep 2 ##e , @ xmath44 @ xcite . in the present paper , @ xmath12 is calculated with second order ( lo ) qcd corrections @ xcite , and compares it to the current cleo measurement. in the mssm , chargino contributions can be compared to the sm and the higgs contributions . they interfere with ( cancel ) each other when @ xmath45 ( @ xmath46 ) . the difference between the lo and the second - to - highest order ( nlo ) contribution can be sizable even when interference among the particles at the lo is dominated by the nlo contributions . as we can see , however , the @ xmath41 problem is severe when the lo is small . in the case of strong interference where the difference from the nlo result can be large , this constraint is not so important . so we expect that our conclusion is not changed significantly by the effect of the nlo corrections . for the experimental results , we get 95 % p . l . , from cleo , @ xmath47 @ xcite . first we consider the experimental results for the minimal case . the result for @ xmath48 is shown in fig . [ 1 : limitmimposmu ] . in this case , for small @ xmath30 particles , the relaxation time is not so large that radiative expansion factor @ xmath49 which determines the higgs contribution is zero . ( for example , @xmath50 gev and @ xmath51 gev for @ xmath52 gev and @ xmath53 ) . hence the higgs mass bound limits this region considerably . in fig . [ fig : limitmimposmu ] , the higgs mass bound and @ xmath12 constraint in the @ xmath54 model are shown . the regions below the shadow line and above the solid line are derived from the higgs mass and @ xmath12 constraints , respectively . the limit of @ xmath55 constrained by lep 2 @ xcite is also shown in this figure . from the figure we see that the higgs mass bound also excludes the region where the stau lsp is zero . note that , as we discussed above , the constraints we put on the higgs mass may be reduced , because the second dimensional limit may also reduce the higgs mass . the same result as for @ xmath56 is shown in fig . [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] . the @ xmath12 constraint constrains parameter ##ization strongly since chargino contribution to @ xmath0 interferes with neutral and neutral higgs ones constructively . the region above the dashedline is excluded by @ xmath12 constraint . we find that only one of the two constraints is sufficient to consider in the cases where cosmological bound and the smuon mass bound are equal . so if r - parity is conserved , i . e . , the mass bound is zero , this scenario with @ xmath56 is possible . next we consider the numerical solution for the case that the gravity scale is smaller than the gut scale . as a typical solution , we take the parameter su ( 5 ) from the theory of the gut scale . in fig . [ fig : limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ fig : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , solutions are shown for positive and negative @ xmath14 , respectively . in both cases , we take @ xmath58 gev . for @ xmath48 case , large parameter line is excluded and susy mass @ xmath59 can be as small as about 1 gev , which indicates the lsp mass @ xmath60 gev . for @ xmath56 , and in the minimal case , @ xmath12 constraint is excluded , and @ xmath59 can be larger than= 280 gev . we also checked the values of the boundary of @ xmath61 from @ xmath62 to @ xmath63 , and found that the value of the above parameters did not change too much . according to ref . @ xcite , tevatron proposed 2 experiments to go up to @ xmath64 gev for maximum luminosity @ xmath65 . even if @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 , susy particles cannot be used in the experiment . in this experiment , trilepton from chargino - neutralino mass production @ xmath68 , @ xmath69 , @ xmath70 is one of clean signals for susy particles . note that the two body decay @ xmath71 decay . the same sign , different sign dilepton from @ xmath72 decay may be useful . the two body decay allows us to calculate the outer edge of invariant mass of the leptons in the @ xmath73 . this is expressed in terms of the neutralino mass and the slepton mass as , @ xmath74 . table [ 1 : mllmax ] , the number of@ xmath73 = @ xmath61 is shown . here we fix @ xmath75 . notice that when @ xmath61 changes , the left - handed mass changes sizably while the neutralino masses do not . thus we can obtain the mass difference among them and also allow for @ xmath61 , which corresponds to the compactification scale of the inner sector region , by fixing @ xmath73 . on the other hand , since only @ xmath76 gev is allowed for @ xmath45 , the tevatron ii experiment can not survey this scenario , and we have to wait lhc time . next , we turn to the fact that gaugino masses are non - zero on the atomic scale . we consider the following three cases , proton - like neutralino lsp , higgsino - like neutralino lsp and the tau sneutrino lsp . we will see that in the wino - like neutralino lsp and tau sneutrino lsp cases , this is not too severe even if we use higgs ##ino data and @ xmath12 data , but in the higgsino - like lsp case wheresince are as large as sleptons and charginos , the total higgs mass has to be small , and therefore the higgs upper bound is important . first , we discuss the wino - lsp case . the results for @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 are shown in fig . [ fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] and fig . [ fig : limit12r432r2negmu ] , for @ xmath46 and @ xmath45 , respectively . in this case , we have a relatively large higgs mass since @ xmath77 is large and so are the masses of particles . however , for @ xmath46 , @ xmath78 can be as large as 100 gev for @ xmath43 , where the mass of the lsp @ xmath79 is around 100 gev . for @ xmath45 , though @ xmath12 ##0 is much larger than in the @ xmath46 case , @ xmath80 is smaller , which corresponds to @ xmath81 . also the super - lsp with mass around 100 gev is allowed . analysis of the energy distribution .this pair is shown as point a ( @ xmath46 ) and point b ( @ xmath45 ) in table [ tab : spectrum ] . at the two points , @ xmath59 is chosen to be at the smallest distance so that the constraints are avoided . in general , however , signals of @ xmath28 and @ xmath82 are highly degenerate when wino uses the lsp . in particular , from table [ tab : spectrum ] , we see that the mass difference is less than 1 gev . therefore , signal from @ xmath70 is very weak and trilepton signal analysis is not possible because the # ##off requires the smallest transverse momentum of the three from @ xmath83 to be larger than 1 gev @ xcite . the collider physics in these cases is studied in detail . it is shown that in range of @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 , susy effects which are different from those in the classical case can be detected . the observed degeneracy needs to include radiative effects to determine @ xmath85 @ xcite , which is beyond of this work . it deserves further study to understandthe temperature difference determines the energy . since the result for the sneutrino lsp ##s in the @ xmath86 case is similar to those in the non - lsp case , we show the result for @ xmath46 ##0 . 5 . [ 1 : limit12r2 . 532r1 . 5posmu ] . in the figure , we see @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 . notice that the decomposition of the lsp depends on @ xmath30 and the sneutrino is the lsp for @ xmath89 . an example of the observed signal is listed for the light source in figure [ 1 : 1 ] . in this case , trilepton signal comes from @ xmath90 , @ xmath91 , @ xmath92 . since @ xmath93 , @ xmath94 of the lepton from @ xmath82 , is unknown and this signal will be hard to be detected . we will need different techniques to explore this scenario . so , we turn to the higgsino lsp scenario . higgsino lsp scenario is realized when @ xmath77 is smaller than @of @ xmath78 , which means that the particles are heavier than in the original gaugino ##li ##q . hence the one - dimensional approximation to the higgs potential which enhances the higgs mass is small and the higgs mass constraint is large . the same results as fig . [ fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are shown in fig . [ fig : limit12r232r0 . 5posmu ] ( @ xmath46 ) and fig . [ fig : limit12r232r0 . 5negmu ] ( @ xmath45 ) for @ xmath95 and @ xmath39 . in order to satisfy the higgs mass constraint , @ xmath78 must be less than about 300 gev . unlike the result with @ xmath12 , this is severer , especially for @ xmath45 , where @ xmath96 is large . values of mass constraint in this scenario is given by , , and , in the [ tab : figure ] . so we have almost the same value of @ xmath78 where mass constraints are avoided . we assume that the lsp mass constraintand at times @ xmath97 for @ xmath46 and @ xmath98 for @ xmath45 . hence this scenario can also be explored at the tevatron run ##time . the gut - scale and boundary conditions are used in both types of susy models . this model is useful because it is very accurate and can be a solution to the susy model problem . in this paper we gave the indication of the current higgs mass and @ xmath41 constraint on susy models with the boundary conditions . first we considered the minimal case where the new gaugino mass is given at the gut scale . this scenario has been already constrained by the measurements of lep and the cosmological bound of , under the assumption of the weak r - parity . we showed that the higgs mass constraint and @ xmath41 constraint are also taken into account , then almost all the parameter region is excluded , a very narrow parameter region for @ xmath48 . then we considered the case that the boundary condition is given at the gut scale . since the cosmological bound is not satisfied , wide range of the parameter space is excluded . in the @ xmath46 case , tevatron have a chance toobserve susy signatures of trilepton events . the case @ xmath61 can be explored by measuring the minimum value of invariant mass of the leptons at the @ xmath73 . however for the @ xmath45 case , since @ xmath99 is required , we have to wait lhc . so we considered the case where non - zero gaugino particles are produced at the minimal case . we found that the higgs mass difference is smaller in the higgsino lsp case because stop ##ons are as large as sleptons and charginos . the mass of the higgsino - and neutralino must be less than about 245 gev and 370 gev for @ xmath46 and @ xmath45 , respectively . in the proton lsp and sneutrino lsp cases , the mass of the lsp may be as large as 400 gev . however , the mass difference between the lsp and the particles produced at the end is much smaller than in the minimal case , so acceptance conditions may be met . the author would like to thank t . yamaguchi for suggesting the subject , after long and thorough reading of the paper . he also thanked t . mor##oi and r . s . nojiri for more information . j . ellis , a . kounnas and d . v . nanopoulos , nucl . b247 ( 1984 ) 373 ; j . ellis , a . b . lahanas , d . v . nanopoulos and a . tamvakis , phys . b134 ( 1984 ) 439 ; a . b . lahanas and d . v . nanopoulos , phys .
