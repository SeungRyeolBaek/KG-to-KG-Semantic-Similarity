in recent years electron transfer ( et ) between molecular adsorbates and semiconductor nanomaterials and surfaces has been subject of much research @ xcite . the injection of an electron into the conduction band is a prototype process for a number of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical interfacial applications such as photography , solar power cells , quantum dot devices , etc . interfacial et between the molecular levels and a semiconductor surface is the simplest of all such processes : it involves only the injection of an electron , and therefore no bonds are broken @ xcite . the ultrafast nature of the charge transfer from adsorbed molecules to the conduction band of semiconductor surfaces was shown in the experiments @ xcite . the theoretical description of such experiments demands an adequate understanding of the et dynamics to be able to explain the time - dependent effects such as coherences . this must be done within the probability density matrix ( rdm ) model used in the theoretical contribution . in @ xcite the electron injection from a chromophore to a semiconductor absorption band was modeled using the time - dependent schrdinger equation , thus neglecting relaxation processes . the neglect of relaxation processes was motivated by the experimental finding that injected electrons relax to within 150 nm of theperylene - tio @ xmath0 system . here we use relaxation to be able to model a larger class of systems where , for example , the adsorbed system is replaced by a liquid bath , and at times . in the rdm , the full system is divided into a liquid system part and a system bath . thus the system hamiltonian consists of three parts the system part @ xmath1 , the bath part @ xmath2 , and the system - bath interaction @ xmath3 : @ xmath4 the rdm @ xmath5 is obtained from the rotation ##s of the full system by tracing over the degrees of freedom of the system . this , together with the second - order perturbative reduction of @ xmath3 and the relaxation approximation leads to the redfield interaction @ xcite : @ xmath6 + { \ mathcal r } \ , = { \ mathcal l } \ , . \ { { { : redfield } \ ] ] in this equation @ xmath7 denotes the redfield interaction . if one has a system - bath interaction with system part @ xmath8 and bath part @ xmath9 @ xmat##h10 we can take advantage of the following decomposition @ xcite : @ xmath11 + [ \ lambda \ rho , k ] + [ k , \ lambda \ lambda ^ { \ lambda } ] . \ { { eq : pf - form } \ ] ] the @ xmath12 reaction can be written in the form @ xmath13 where @ xmath14 is the operator @ xmath8 in the above equation . the electron hole interaction is taken to be represented in the reaction coordinate as well as in the reaction state . neither the plane model nor the standard model has been invoked . the so - called quantum mechanical approximation which has many applications @ xcite is not used because it could lead to negative results in the chemical reactions studied @ xcite . in the following we turn our attention to et , an excited ground state and a conduction band . the hamiltonian of this system consists of the ground and an excited state of the molecule and a quasi - continuum of the conduction band , with one vibrational coordinate @ xmath15 here @ xmath16 can be converted to @ xmath17 for the ground state , @ xmath18 for the excited state , and @ x##math19 for the s - continuum . as in ref . @ xcite we take the frequency of the transition state to be @ xmath20 . the coupling between the excited state and the ground states is assumed to be linear : @ xmath21 . a box - shaped uniform density of states is used . instead of modeling the excitation from the ground state explicitly we use an @ xmath22 - model . the excited state potential energy surface is chosen 0 . 2 along the reaction axis with respect to the ground state potential energy surface . this results in an initial vibrational wave based on the excited state with no changes in the lowest 4 - electron transition state . the shift between the excited state potential energy and the continuum parabola is 0 . 2 . the thermal bath is described by its uniform density @ xmath23 . because all the states have the same frequency the coupling to the bath can be given by the parameter @ xmath24 in the linear coupling approximation . for the effective temperature of the system given by @ xmath25 the frequency of the bath is chosen by @ xmath26 . to be able to model the effects of dissipation we donot model the quasi - continuum with such a large number of electronic states as in above . @ xcite . in that model a band of width 2 ev was described with an energy difference of 1 . 5 mev leading to 801 electronic surfaces . these problems are very demanding of wave packet theory but are impossible using direct - matrix methods . for solving such a large problem one would have to use the monte carlo wave function scheme @ xcite . we use a much simpler model and describe only that part of the conduction band which really takes part in the injection process . the actual size of the conduction band will be much larger . in the model , a band of width 0 . 75 ev is treated with 11 electronic surfaces . for each of these electronic surfaces the vibrational states are taken into account . we are aware that this is not a minimal model but also that it reduces the effect of noise in the electron injection process . here we look at two different populations involved in the process of electron injection . the time - dependent population of the electronic surfaces in the conduction band is calculated as the sum of the vibrational states of each electronic surface @ xmath27 . as a second quantity we look at the time - dependent population of the vibrational levels ofthe final excited state @ xmath28 . these two probability distributions give some hints about the effect of doping . figure 1 shows the electronic population for the quasi - continuum , i . e . the energy distribution of the injected electron , versus the energy of the conduction electrons . as described above , the four lowest energy states are affected only by @ xmath29 . the distribution shown in the upper part of fig . 1 was first explained by ramakrishna et al . and can be estimated using the golden rule . the electronic properties of the quasi - continuum are given as @ xmath30 where @ xmath31 is the initial vibronic distribution in the excited state and @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 are the vibronic distributions of the electron , in the excited and quasi - continuum states , respectively . the symbol @ xmath34 indicates the middle of the spectrum . turning to dissipation two things can be seen . first , the vibrational populations in the ground state of the molecule no longer only relax into the quasi - continuum states but also relax within the excited state ( see fig . 2 ) . second , the electronic populations also relax within the quasi - continuum states . the rec##urrences back into the excited state are much slower . only those parts of the wave function which are still high enough in energy can travel back to the molecule . in 2007 , we extended the work of ramakrishna , willig , and may @ xcite by including relaxation processes into the process of electron injection into the conduction band of a semiconductor . this has , at times , been used for modeling electron transport in the presence of a fluid surrounding the attached semiconductor .
