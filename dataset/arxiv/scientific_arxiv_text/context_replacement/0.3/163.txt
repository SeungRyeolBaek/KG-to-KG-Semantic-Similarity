the study of the high - redshift galaxies of today most massive galaxies can provide us with invaluable insight into the fundamental processes that shape the formation of galaxies in the high - energy regime . the new generation of galaxy evolution models are now able to explain the number densities and properties of massive galaxies at high distances . however , this is only part of the problem , as recent studies have posed new questions about how the morphologies of these galaxies evolve with size . in addition to the basic question of how high - redshift galaxies evolve with size , there is also still much debate about how these massive galaxies evolve in terms of their fundamental spectral type . recent studies of the local universe have revealed a bimodality in the colour - space plane , with spheroidal galaxies largely forming the central sequence and disk galaxies making up the blue cloud ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * baldry et al . 2004 ) ) . however , recent studies at both distances ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * bamford et al . 2009 ) ) and high energies ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * van der wel et al . 2011 ) ) have revealed a significantobservations of these disk - dominated systems , providing evidence that the chemical processes which drive star - formation may be different from those responsible for the physical transformations . this work is particularly interesting in light of the more detailed studies of high - mass spiral galaxies by and ( * ? ? ? * van der wel et al . ( 2011 ) ) which show that , in contrast to the general population of massive galaxies ( which is dominated by disk galaxies ) , at @ xmath6 the galaxies are not disk - dominated systems . in this work we attempt to achieve greatly greater clarity on these observations . the candels ( ( * ? ? ? * grogin et al . 2011 ) , ( * ? ? ? * koekemoer et al . 2011 ) ) near - infrared f160w observations provide the necessary level of depth , temporal resolution , and precision to enable the most detailed study to date of the free - space optical properties of massive ( @ xmath1 ) galaxies at @ xmath2 in the ukidss very large survey ( ( * ? ? ? * lawrence et al . 2007 ) ) . for this study we have selected a sample based on optical observations and stellar mass estimates which aredetermined using the stellar mass density function of ( * ? ? ? * bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ) and a chabrier stellar density function ( see ( * ? ? ? * bruce et al . 2012 ) for full details ) . this provides us with a nearly mass - complete sample of @ xmath7 galaxies . we have employed the galfit ( ( * ? ? ? * peng et al . 2002 ) ) morphology fitting method to determine the morphological properties for all the objects in our sample . to conduct the double - fitting we need three components : an srsic model estimated at @ xmath8 fit , an @ xmath9 fixed mass and a highly concentrated morphological model to account for the agn or other starbursts within our sample . these three components are combined to produce several alternative multiple component morphology fits , of varying quality , for each object in the sample . these components are often nested , and thus @ xmath10 fit can be used to produce the ` ` best ' ' fit with the appropriate set of morphological parameters . together with this unparalleled morphological information for massive galaxies at high redshift we can consider how the relative mass density of galaxies of different morphological type changes during the timestudies in natural history probed here . in fig . 1 we illustrate this by dividing our sample into three redshift ##s of which @ xmath11 , and consider three alternative cuts in morphological classification as measured by @ xmath12 from our bulge - dominated decompositions . in the left - hand panel of fig . 1 we have further divided the sample into two categories : bulge - dominated ( @ xmath13 ) and disk - dominated ( @ xmath14 ) . in the second panel we have divided the sample into three categories , with any object for which @ xmath15 classed as ` ` disk ' ' . finally , in the right - hand panel we have expanded this intermediate category to include all objects for which @ xmath16 . and consider three alternative cuts in morphological classification ( both to try to provide a complete picture , and to allow comparison with other studies in the field ) . , [ = 528 ] from these panels it can be seen that @ xmath6 marks a new evolutionary stage , in which the objects are predominantly bulge - dominated , and below which they become predominantly mixed bulge + disk systems . we also note that at the highest redshifts probed by this study ( @xmath17 ) it is seen that , while bulge - dominated galaxies are on the rise , pure - bulge ##s ( i . e . objects comparable to modern - day giant ellipticals ) have yet to emerge in significant numbers , with @ xmath18 % of these low - mass galaxies still having a thin disk component . this is compared with @ xmath19 of the local @ xmath1 galaxy population , which would be classified as pure - bulges from our definition ( @ xmath20 , corresponding to @ xmath21 ) from the definition of ( * ? ? ? * buitrago et al . ( 2013 ) ) . thus , our results will challenge existing models of star formation to account for the relatively rapid demise of massive bulge - forming galaxies , but the relatively slow emergence of new bulge - dominated objects . in addition to our morphological decompositions we also make use of the sed fitting method employed in the sample selection to determine the relationship between star - formation activity and morphological type . this shows specific star - formation activity ( @ xmath22 ) versus morphological type for the individual galaxies in our sample , where this is determined by the srsic index on the left - hand panel , and by the- to - - @ xmath23 - band ##ing ratio ( @ xmath12 ) in the right - hand panel . the values of @ xmath22 plotted were derived from the various optical - infrared sed fits employed in the sample analysis , and include corrections for dust , as expected from the best possible value of @ xmath24 plotted during the sed fitting . as a result of the apparent failure of this approach to accurately identify reddened , star - forming objects , we have also searched for 24 @ xmath25 m ##â˜‰ in the _ spitzer _ telescope _ imaging of the uds , and have found in blue stars those objects which have a red band in a search window of @ xmath26arcsec . to first glance , our results indicate that the well - established bimodality in the colour - space plane , at high resolution , where spheroidal galaxies inhabit the red region , while elliptical galaxies inhabit the blue , is at least partly already in place by @ xmath6 . however , the sample also already contains star - forming bulge - dominated objects and , perhaps more importantly , a significant number of dark dusty disk - dominated objects . to confirm andwithin this region we have identified by the panel on to the right the regions occupied by objects with disk - free disks and @ xmath27 . in the left - hand panel , disk - dominated is defined as @ xmath28 , and @ xmath29 % of the disk galaxies lie within this region ( if we combine the two @ xmath25 m detections ) , and in the right - hand panel , disk - dominated is defined as @ xmath14 , in which case @ xmath30 % of the quiescent objects lie within this region . the presence of a significant population of disk galaxies among the disk galaxy populations at these distances indicates that star - forming activity can occur without a disk galaxy being transformed back into a disk - free one , as was previously expected if the process that causes star formation is a spiral merger . a possible mechanism for this comes from the simultaneous use of hydrodynamical simulations ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * kere et al . 2005 ) , ( * ? ? ? * dekel et al . 2009a ) ) and analytic theories ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * birnboim &dekel 2003 ) ) , which suggests a secondary mechanism whereby at high temperatures star - formation is fed through jets of cold gas . another mechanism which may account for star - formation processes , whilst not necessarily consistent with the existence of active disks , is the presence of active disk material ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * dekel et al . 2009b ) ) , coupled with " quenching " ( ( * ? ? ? * martig et al . 2009 ) ) .
