the time - born - gerlach , sg , interaction of a relativistic fermion with an e . g . field has been used to produce beams of electrons with different spin , corresponding to different states @ xcite . we can see how the ##less electron beams change momentum with the magnetic field of the rf field . let us start with @ xmath1 the coordinates of the particles in the laboratory , and with @ xmath2 the coordinates in the particle rest frame , prf . call the latter the electromagnetic force that is the action of an inhomogeneous electromagnetic field on a particle , with a magnetic moment @ xmath3 = z _ sg = ( ^ * a ) = z ( ^ * b ) + z ( ^ * b ) + z ( ^ * b ) [ fsg ] with = ge2 m s [ mu ] . then @ xmath4 is the electromagnetic interaction with @ xmath5 for electrons and positrons , @ xmath6 , and @ xmath7 for antiprotons and electrons , @ xmath8 , making @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 either parallel or perpendicular to each other , .. @ xmath11 is the rest frame of the particle , @ xmath12 the gyromagnetic , and @ xmath13 the spin given by | = g - 22 = \ { ll 1 . 793 ( p = 5 . 586 ) & p , | | + + 1 . 160 10 ^ - 1 & e ^ . . [ anomalies ] note that in eq . ( [ fsg ] ) we have written the magnetic moment as @ xmath14 in the rest frame , rather than as @ xmath15 . in the rest frame the moment vector @ xmath10 , the spin , the vector @ xmath16 and the components perpendicular to the magnetic moment , can only take the following values : _ s = ( - s , - s + ) , . . . . , ( - s , s ) , [ s _ main ] where @ xmath17 is the reduced electromagnetic radiation coefficient . for ex . ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ s _ main ] ) we obtain for the magnetic moment , the prf = | | = g | e | 4 } = \ { ll 1 . 160 10 ^ - 26 jt ^ - 1 ++ 9 . 5 t ^ - 1 jt ^ - 1 . . [ mumod ] for a particle moving along the axis @ xmath18 , the linear transformations of the differential operators and of the coordinates are \ { lll x = x & y = y & z = ( 1 + 1 ##x ) + + f _ = 1f _ & g _ = f _ & ( f _ z = ce _ y ) [ dz ] . . [ ftransf ] the transformation ( [ fsg ] ) is applied to the coordinate system and f _ z = 1 x ( ^ * a ) + 1 x ( ^ * b ) + 1 ( ^ * b ) . [ f - g ] because of the linear transformations of the coordinates @ xcite @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 \ { + a = ( e + cb ) - ^ 2 + 1 ( e ) + + b = ( e - ce ) - ^ 2 + 1 ( e ) . . [ f ] the coordinates of the reference frame @ xmath21 = ( ^ * a ) = ^ * _ x ( b _ x + ce _ y ) + ^ * _ y ( b _ y - ce _ x ) +^ * _ f _ z . [ magen ] with fig . ( [ magen ] ) and ( [ c - z ] ) , by means of fig . ( [ dz ] ) , and using these we can now obtain the sg ##m equations in the following form : \ { l c _ z = ^ * _ x ( b _ xx + c e _ yx ) + ^ * _ x ( b _ yx - c e _ xx ) + 1 ^ * _ c _ zx + + f _ z = ^ * _ x ( b _ xx + c e _ yy ) + ^ * _ x ( b _ yy - c e _ xx ) + 1 ^ * _ c _ zy + + f _ z = ^ * _ c _ zx + ^ * _ yc _ zy + ^ * _ zc _ zz , . [ fsgz ] with \ { l c _ zx = ^ 2 + + f _ zy = ^ 3 + + f _ zz = ( b _ zz + c e _ zt ) . . [ czz ] these equations can also be derived from the standard differential equationsof the spin - @ xmath0 - particle @ xcite . let us consider the standard hamiltonian a = e + c ( p - ea ) + _ z } ^ 2 [ ham1 ] which makes use of the dirac s matrix = ( ) , _ y = ( ) , = _ z = ( ) , [ mat - p ] where @ xmath22 is the matrix whose components are the pauli s matrices _ x = ( ) , _ y = ( ) , _ z = ( ) , [ mat - p ] @ xmath23 is the @ xmath24 - matrix , @ xmath25 the null matrix and has chosen the @ xmath26 - axis corresponding to the normal magnetic moment . the standard derivation leads to the standard ##ised formulation of the hamiltonian for the sg ##m with the ` ` normal ' ' magnetic moment = e + ( p - ea ) ^ 2 - ( 1 ) [ hamp ] which agrees with the above equation and is used in the prf . to complete the derivation we can relate the energy from the normal magnetic moment to the total energy term of the above equation , with a = @ xmath27 , e - c= - ^ * b ^ * = 1 . [ sgenergy ] in order to obtain the @ xmath28 - component of the sg force in the laboratory frame along the direction of motion of the particle , we must obtain the explicit second law of 1 . ( [ hamp ] ) by imposing the differential operator @ xmath29 on the hilbert space @ xcite , which is the canonical transformation u ^ - - = = + ( _ 0b ) [ hilb ] that can be expressed in terms of the canonical operators for the @ xmath30 spinor : u = = + ( ) [ str ] with = , v = = = , v = ( = ) . [ defs ] from 1 . ( [ hilb ] ) and ( [ str ] ) , due to the unique properties of the @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 operators , we obtain in the laboratory frame the corresponding component of the sg force \ { lll } ^ - 1 ( _ 0 _ x ) s & = & _ 0 _ x + s ^ - 1 ( _ 0 _ y ) s & = & _ 0 _ y + s ^ - 1 ( _ 0 _ x ) s &= & ( _ z _ 0 ) + i _ z _ 5 . , [ evxyz ] with _ z = _ i _ 0 _ z _ 0 = + ( ) . [ g5 ] from eqs . ( [ evxyz ] ) we can deduce the expectation value of the sg ##f in the cavity , with a defined distribution - along the @ xmath26 - axis in our case - via the expectation values of the spin term and of the weak interaction term of the electromagnetic force f _ z = _ x _ y ^ 2 ^ * . [ fz4 ] in our case . the second of these . ( [ evxyz ] ) gives a non vanishing result , while both the second and third produce a significant contribution to the result , because of the symmetry of the two spin terms @ xmath33 and the symmetry of the @ xmath32 axis . let us consider the standing wave set up in a generic high - frequency cavity , corresponding to a generic te mode @ xcite . resonator dimensions are : width @ xmath13 , height @ xmath34 and length @ xmath35 , as shown in figure . [ 1 : 1 ]. along the helix axis , which intersects with the helix axis , the electric and magnetic fields are @ xcite @ xmath36 \ \ \ \ b _ y & = & - { b _ 0 \ over k _ c ^ 2 } \ left ( { m \ pi \ over d } \ right ) \ left ( { m \ pi \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { m \ pi x \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { m \ pi y \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { m \ pi z \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ , \ omega t \ \ \ \ b _ y & = & - { b _ 0 \ over k _ c ^ 2 } \ left ( { n \ pi \ over d } \ right ) \ sin ( { p \ pi \ over d } \ right ) \ cos \ left ( { m \ pi x \ over a } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { m \ pi x \ over b } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { m \ pi x \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ , \ omega t \ \ \ \= _ a & = & b _ 0 \ cos \ left ( { m \ pi z \ over d } \ left ) \ sin \ right ( { m \ pi y \ over b } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { m \ pi z \ over d } \ left ) \ , \ , \ , t \ end { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath37 is the maximum peak electric field , @ xmath11 , @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 are the maximum indeces , and = _ c = . [ 1 ] the angular velocity of the e . m . emitted from the wave ##guide is = _ = 2c _ = c . [ omegen ] in contrast with an open cavity , in a bounded cavity we can have a cavity wavelength @ xmath40 and a cavity wavelength @ xmath41 , as typical of the e . m . in a light microscope , according to the equation = _ = c . [ rphv ] and _ = _ c _ . [ cav - wl ] this gives : = _ c = _ = note that @ xmath42 can take any wavelength , even longer than c , sinceit is freely based on the cavity length parameters . thus , from fig . ( [ omegen ] ) and ( [ rphv ] ) we obtain d = _ _ _ = p _ [ cav - 1 ] which is the difference between the cavity length @ xmath35 and the wavelengths , as shown in fig . [ 2 : edge ] . for example , let us choose the preferred optical mode @ xmath43 , from fig . ( [ omegen ] ) and ( [ rphv ] ) reduce this to = _ = c = _ c _ = [ ombetap ] and , from the spectral index @ xmath44 , = _ = c = _ c _ = , [ ombeta1 ] which are the quantities pertaining to the preferred @ xmath45 mode whose mean - field components along the z axis are \ { - e _ y ( z , t ) = - b _ 0 ( ) t + + e _ y ( z , t ) = - b _ 0 ( ) . . . [ byex ] it is important to emphasize that when considering the spatial components , so far there is a clear distinction between spatial and temporal components , as functions of " waves . ", the boundary values of the electric and magnetic components of the e . t . determine the direction of the spatial component which , in turn , oscillates in time with the frequency @ xmath46 . thus , at the cavity entrance and exit the field components ( [ byex ] ) are on axis \ { l b _ x ( d , t ) = - b _ 0 t + + b _ x ( d , t ) = 0 . . [ edge - in ] and \ { l e _ y ( d , t ) = - e _ 0 t = e _ 0 t + + e _ y ( d , t ) = - t = 0 . . [ edge - out ] where @ xmath47 is the generic mode . the boundary values of @ xmath48 at the cavity entrance give a typical description of the applied electric field . from fig . ( [ fz4 ] ) , after some calculations , we obtain tha a single wave which crosses a high - frequency cavity , tuned to the frequency @ xmath49 mode , gains ( and loses ) an equal amount when interacts with the field components at the ` ` edge ' ' of the cavity . see fig . [fig : edge ] @ xcite ( u ) _ = _ 0 ^ df _ z dz = _ 0 ^ d ^ * b _ zydz = ^ d ^ 2 b _ z ^ * ( u + ) [ du - 1 ] this shows that the cavity is not precessing . however , since the cavity can not be completely filled it must have holes at both ends to allow the particle bean to pass through and it must have magnetic fields , in order to calculate the full field , it is necessary to deal with the interaction with these fields . this is shown right below . in order to satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ edge - in ] ) and ( [ edge - out ] ) , a cavity operating in its @ xmath45 state must be fully filled with either an even or an odd number of cavity dependent field wave - lengths , eq . ( [ cav - wl ] ) , as shown in figs . [ fig : edges ] and [ fig : edges ] . consider : a bunch of particles entering the cavity in accordance with the magnetic field . this requires that the bunch centre of mass that enters the cavity at the point @ xmath50 and would leave the cavity at @ xmath##51 , at these field values , \ h _ y ( 0 , 0 ) = - b _ 0 ##h _ y ( d , _ ) = b _ 0 [ edge - wise ] the field strengths at both ends decrease rapidly to zero at a small distance @ xmath52 , outside the cavity ( see figures . ) we can express these fringe fields as real - valued functions in the @ xmath53 - plane , since the force @ xmath54 required for a particle to travel over this distances will be very small in comparison with @ xmath55 , depending of course on the length of the vacuum tube , or \ { llllll _ & = & - b _ 0g ( z ) & & g ( - ) = 0 , & g ( 0 ) = 0 + + _ & = & b _ 0h ( z ) & & g ( z ) = 1 , & h ( 0 + ) = 0 . . [ z - flds ] under these conditions , a relativistic fermion with its beam travelling along the @ xmath26 - axis and traversing the cavity will experience a force ##r perpendicular to the @ xmath28 - axis ( direction of propagation ) , see figure . ([ fsgz ] ) c _ z = ^ * c _ zy [ fz ] where @ xmath56 is given by the limit of the density of states . ( [ czz ] ) . for the case we assume that the spin will change its direction during entering the fringe field @ xmath48 and the derivatives of this equation are almost always changing , because of the boundary conditions at the outside of the field and at the boundary conditions @ xmath57 and @ xmath58 . however , the energy @ xmath59 is always constant along the fringe field because of its relation to @ xmath60 , with @ xmath47 equal to the @ xmath54 as before . thus we have c _ zy ^ * , [ redczy ] and for the inner fringe field \ { lll _ & = & - b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 ( ) + + _ & = & b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 ( ) . . [ edge - forces ] by means of . . ( [ redczy ] ) and ( [ edge - forces ] ) , the energy of @ xmath61 _ { \ m _ } $ ]and @ xmath61 _ { \ , _ } $ ] related to the boundary fields . not evaluated since the terms @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 both depend upon the extreme values ( [ du - flds ] ) and do not depend upon the line that connects them . in particular @ xmath64 is an integral function . then we have for the energy exchange at the edges ( u ) _ = ( u ) _ = - b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 . [ cav - u ] the total energy exchange at the edges is : ( u ) _ = ( u ) _ + ( u ) _ = - 2b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 . [ ff - en ] . comparing the crossing contributions ( [ ff - en ] ) to the zero - crossing contributions ( [ du - en ] ) seen above , : ( u ) _ = ( u ) _ + ( u ) _ x = - ^ - b _ 0 ^ * . ( _ , ) [ du - x ] with f ( _ , ) = . [ du - x ] for # ##fine fields ( @ xmath65 ) = . ( [ du - x ] ) related to (( ) _ - ^ 2 b _ 0 ^ * ( u - _ ) . [ du - ur1 ] this last table has a few problems . in particular , if we set _ = _ d = _ = _ [ b2 ] the total energy contribution ( [ du - ur1 ] ) becomes , allowing a better understanding of the effect . on the other hand if we set _ = _ [ b3 ] the total energy contribution ( [ du - ur1 ] ) becomes ( u ) _ - 2 ^ 2 b _ 0 ^ * [ du - ur2 ] as derived from q . ( [ cav - beta ] ) . in table i we gather as derived from q . ( [ beta - beta ] ) for non - interacting and ultra - relativistic , for , either @ xmath66 or @ xmath67 , and # ##s . each @ xmath42 is accompanied by the same ratio of - length to cavity - height . * table ii : * @ xmath68 [ cols = " ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] however , if we have two contiguous cavities , there will be a difference between the positive @ xmath69at the end of the first cavity and the second @ xmath69 at the end of the second cavity , as shown in fig . [ 1 : cavx ] . in this case we shall consider the magnetic field at the origin as being dependent on @ xmath28 , that is _ [ gradx ] . what done before , \ rcl _ & = & - 2b _ 0 + + f _ z & = & - 2b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 + + ( u ) _ = ( u ) _ & = & _ - ^ f _ z dz = - 2b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 = - 2b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 which means that , for @ xmath70 ##0 , we shall have as a solution for # ##fine , ( u ) _ = + ( u ) _ - ( u - 1 ) ( u ) _ - ( u ) _ = \ { ll } & _ m = + + + f _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 & _ n = . . . [ full - text ] conversely , if @ xmath42 is even , particles with their spin axis always in the z direction will still exchange momentum with thestanding wave of a = ##v . a magnetic rotator @ xcite to align the particle magnetic moments either parallel or anti - parallel to the direction of the magnetic field tails , thus achieving the same energy transfer . this solution would be similar to what happens in the multi - stage van van de graaff , where the particles are repetitively accelerated by the applied magnetic field , or alternatively negative , via the addition of electrons , or positive , via electron stripping . unfortunately , the field gradient ( @ xmath71 tm , for @ xmath72 ) for attaining a steady state is so large that this solution is unpractical . however , the solution of @ xmath42 equal to an even number is much more suitable since does not require more magnets , but only longer ones ( compare fig . ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) ) . in general , the magnetic moments are ( de ) accelerated by the field tails at the two ends , while do nt change their energy when crossing the boundary . this solution resembles the wideroe linac where the charged particles are accelerated by the electric field of the contiguous vacuum regions , while do nt change their energy whileand the lines themselves . on the basis of the above results , we feel obliged to use the time - sg method as a method for measuring the spin state separation of an unpolarized beam of , say ( anti ) spin , since the number of particles with different spin states can differ and neither of the two states can be separated . as a first step of the development of a sensible cavity design , we intend to proceed with computer simulation . as a first step , we intend to verify the results of eqs . ( [ du - tot ] ) and ( [ beta - sg ] ) setting twice @ xmath66 and twice @ xmath67 , in a situation where the effects of interaction can be easily observed . within the limits of the present theory , there is also the possibility of measuring the field generated by the spin states inside the cavity , that we did not previously propose on this note . first , we shall propose a spin splitter scheme based on the lattice of an existing or planned ( anti ) spin crystal endowed with an array of splitting cavities . the main objective of the latter scheme is to observe the mixing of @ xcite @ xcite of the longitudinal in - plane filamentation , i. . . the elementary particles which could cause the actual spin splitting process . first , we want to thank waldo mackay , who has participated in so many discussions about the whole idea and who was not prevented by numerous commitments from contributing to the writing of the following paper . we thank renzo parodi for his contribution for trying to better understand the subtleties of the spin splitting set up . thanks are also due to chris tschalaer for his work on the theory of the gauge fields . m . conte , a . ferro , g . gemme , w . w . mackay , m . parodi , m . pusterla : the stern - gerlach interaction between a charged particle and a time varying magnetic field , infn / 2000 - 00 / 03 , 22 marzo 2000 .
