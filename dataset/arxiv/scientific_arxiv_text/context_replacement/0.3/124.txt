as in our previous work of run 1a and @ xcite , we perform a systematic search for the particles with a large natural width that decay to dijets . in particular , we search for the following particles shown in fig . [ 1 _ 1 ] : axigluons @ xcite from chiral atoms ( @ xmath7 ) , bound states @ xcite of molecular atoms ( @ xmath8 ) , the exotic technirhos @ xcite ( @ xmath9 ) , exotic vector particles ( @ xmath10 , @ xmath11 ) , and scalar @ xmath12 diquarks @ xcite ( @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 ) . using the data from run 1a and 1b , we obtain dijet energy carriers with a mass of 220 gev / c @ xmath1 , 241 gev / c @ xmath1 , 292 gev / c @ xmath1 , and 388 gev / c @ xmath1 with energy luminosities of = 3 . 5 in = 3 . 5 in = 3 . 5 in . 089 pb @ xmath0 , 0 . # ##p @xmath0 , 69 . 2 p @ xmath0 , and 69 . 8 p @ xmath0 % . jets are defined with a fixed cone clustering algorithm ( r = 0 . 7 ) and then analyzed for detector noise , energy difference in the cone , and collision event . we define the two highest @ xmath15 jets and assume that they have pseudorapidity @ xmath16 and [ cms - angle @ xmath17 | < 1 / 3 $ ] . the @ xmath18 jet provides uniform acceptance as a function of mass and reduces the background background which occurs at @ xmath19 . in fig . [ fig _ dijet ] the dijet mass distribution is presented as a 3d cross section in terms of the mass distribution ( @ xmath20 % ) . at constant mass the data is much higher than the data from pythia plus the cdf - simulation , similar to the inclusive of @ xmath21 spectrum @ xcite . to search for exotic particles we estimate the qcd background by fitting the data to a smooth function of three parameters @ xcite ; fig . [ fig _ dijet ] . the fractional difference between the data and the sample( @ xmath22 ) . we have upward resolutions of 200 gev / c @ xmath1 ( @ xmath23 ) , 550 gev / c @ xmath1 ( @ xmath24 ) and 850 gev / c @ xmath1 ( @ xmath25 ) . for mass , it is sufficient to measure the mass resolution for only one type of charged particle because the detector resolution is the same . in fig . [ fig _ resonance ] we measure the short resolution for excited states ( * * ) from decay and the cdf detector resolution ; the high resolution for low energies are from gluon decay . for the value of the measured energy in 550 gev / c @ xmath1 resonance , we perform a binned maximum likelihood fit of the energy to the observed parameterization and the observed measured energy . in fig . [ fig _ resonance ] we show the best fit and 95 % confidence level upper bound for the 550 gev / c @ xmath1 resonance . for the mass region @ xmath26 gev / c @ xmath1 , there are 2947 events in the resonance , @ xmath27 events ( @ xmath28) in the background for the fit without the resonance , @ xmath29 and ( @ xmath30 ) are the parameters for the fit that includes the resonance , and the value of the measured cross section from the background is @ xmath31 ##0 ( t ) . in fig . [ fig _ cos ] we study the angular distribution of the resonance in the mass distribution @ xmath26 gev / t @ xmath1 . the mass distribution is compatible with these models alone , and with = 3 . 3 in = 3 . 3 in qcd + 5 % excited state ( best fit ) . this amount of excited quark is coincidentally the same as found in the best fit . although the value is small , we conclude it is not yet = 3 . 3 in = 3 . 3 in or above , and begin to set limits on new particle production . = 3 . 3 in = 3 . 3 in from the angular distribution of experimental mass measurements @ xcite we find the 5 % cl ##ump bound in the cross section for the particles observed in fig . [ fig _ dijet _ t ] . we compare this to the cross section for axigluons ( ( @ xmath32gev / c @ xmath1 ) , spin states ( excluding @ xmath33 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , technirhos ( excluding @ xmath34 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , c @ xmath35 ( excluding @ xmath36 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , c @ xmath35 ( excluding @ xmath37 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , and e6 diquarks ( excluding @ xmath38 gev / c @ xmath1 ) . the others are second order @ xcite , cteq2l parton , @ xcite and one - dimensional @ xmath39 and require @ xmath16 and @ xmath40 . the effective mass of the top quark suggests that the third generation may be special . topcolor @ xcite suggests that the effective mass is large enough because of the new @ xmath5 symmetry introduced by a new spin dynamics coupling to the third generation . however the @ xmath41 of qcd is a higher spin state resulting from the introduction of the @ xmath42 coupling to the third generation andan @ xmath43 coupling to the first two generations follows . there are then three color - coded , topgluons @ xmath44 , which couples mainly to @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 . the topgluon is also produced and couples mainly to the third generation ( @ xmath45 ) with a very large natural width ( @ xmath46 ) . here we search for the topgluon in the @ xmath4 channel . an additional @ xmath47 coupling is used @ xcite to produce the @ xmath48 is light while the top ##color is heavy ; this leads to the topcolor @ xmath6 , which also couples largely to @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 . the topcolor @ xmath6 is electroweakly produced and couples mainly to the third generation ( @ xmath49 ) with a large natural width ( @ xmath50 ) . here we search for the topcolor @ xmath6 in both the the @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 channels ; the @ xmath5 channel is the most stable because the coupling to @ xmath##5 is better . we start with the dijet mass of 19 pb @ xmath0 of run 1a % @ xcite and require that at least one of the two leading particles be identified as a bottom particle . the b - tag identifies a displaced particle in the the secondary vertex detector @ xcite . the @ xmath4 event distribution is @ xmath51 % total of dijet mass . from fits to the @ xmath52 data , we estimate that the sample is about 50 % bottom , 30 % charm , and 10 % mistags of plain jets . pythia estimates that 1 / 3 of these bottom particles are direct @ xmath4 , and the rest are from gluon decay and charm decay . consequentially , at the @ xmath53 % @ xmath54 10 % of our sample is direct @ xmath4 . we expect both the accuracy and precision to increase when we use the run 1b dataset and a better tagging algorithm @ xcite . with increased tagging efficiency we should be able to make efficient use of the b - tagged data like the one in above . [ see _ btag _ data ] . = fig . 1 .= 0 . 5 in the fig . [ fig _ btag ] we show the b - tagged dijet mass distribution corrected for the @ xmath4 effect . also shown is the untagged dijet mass distribution from run 1a , and these data well match with our new parameterization @ xcite . the b - tagged dijet data shows an upward resolution of 600 gev / c @ xmath1 . we model the shape of the narrow resonance using pythia ##s @ xmath3 , and using cdf ##d simulation . in fig . [ fig _ btag ] we compare the b - tagged data to a 600 gev / c @ xmath1 narrow resonance , and get a cross section of @ xmath55 effect ( s ) . note that this is similar to the dijet data in both mass and rate . however , there are only 8 particles in the last two data bins of fig . [ fig _ btag ] , and the fluctuation has caused the @ xmath56 effect , so we need to set limits for the particle sizes . we have two types of fits for the limits . first , narrow resonances are modelled as described above , and the maximum size isthe cdf detector is shown in fig . [ fig _ b _ bbar _ res ] . recently , the field detection of topgluons @ xcite , including interference with the resonance , was incorporated into experiments and a cdf detector simulation . the mass region in fig . [ fig _ b _ bbar _ res ] displays destructive interference to the left of the resonance ; experiments with destructive interference on the right side of the resonance will be possible in the future . = 3 . 2 in = 3 . 5 in experiments for new particle sizes are shown in fig . [ fig _ btag _ res ] . the production cross sections are in order and have cteq2l parton symmetry . for the resonances the production cross sections are # ##h sufficient for us to calculate mass region at this time . for topgluons the production cross sections @ xcite are ordered , and we are able to calculate by 50 % the topgluons of width @ xmath57 in the mass region @ xmath58 gev / c @ xmath1 , @ xmath59 for @ xmath60 gev / c @ xmath1 , and @ xmath61 for @ xmat##h62 gev / c @ xmath1 . = 2 . 0 in = 3 . 0 in = 4 . 0 . to search for new events corresponding to @ xmath5 we started with the data obtained from the top mass measurement @ xcite . then we compared the decays to w + w events with at least one b - mode , and calculated these events on the basis of @ xmath63 , resulting in the top mass of @ xmath64 ( stat ) @ xmath65 ( sys ) gev / c @ xmath1 . that will be the entire event for the top hypothesis , discarding events with @ xmath66 ( best fit ) . here we add the additional constraint that the top mass is 176 gev / c @ xmath1 , which greatly enhances our resolution of the @ xmath5 mass . out of the 19 events in the @ xmath66 test when the top mass value is added to the data , leaving us with 17 events . the @ xmath5 mass , resulting from a narrow resonance , corresponding to the topcolor @ xmath6 ##3 rate @ xcite , is shown in bold . [ fig _ ttbar] . here we used sm @ xmath67 . also in fig . [ fig _ ttbar ] shows the monte carlo simulation of the sample , on the left standard model mass prediction from herwig , and on the right qcd w + 1 background from vecbos with parton showers from herwig . all of these include a cdf simulation simulation . on the right in fig . [ fig _ ttbar ] , the comparison of the topcolor of @ xmath3 to sm @ xmath5 , illustrates that in this particular case we are able to topcolor @ xmath6 ##9 to a mass of about 600 gev / c @ xmath1 . finally , on the right in fig . [ fig _ ttbar ] , we present the @ xmath5 candidate mass prediction from cdf simulation to the above standard model prediction . given the statistics the agreement is very good indeed . the upper shoulder of the data on a sample of @ xmath68 , the sm @ xmath69 gev / c @ xmath1 results is an accurate mass prediction , like the dijet and @ xmath4 candidate results , but is not statistically significant . upper shoulder of the@ xmath5 the section is a part of @ xmath5 , , and in the topcolor @ xmath6 , is in = 3 . = 3 . 1 . = 3 . 1 . we set results for the particles added to dijets , @ xmath4 , and @ xmath5 . in the dijet channel we set the most recent observed particle exclusions to date on the hadronic model of axigluons ( excluding @ xmath70 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , massive particles ( excluding @ xmath71 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , technirhos ( excluding @ xmath34 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , c @ xmath3 ( excluding @ xmath36 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , c @ xmath35 ( excluding @ xmath37 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , and for the first time e6 diquarks ( excluding @ xmath38 gev / c @ xmath1 ) . in the @ xmath4 channel we set the first results on topcolor , on the diof topgluons for width @ xmath57 and the mass region @ xmath58 gev / c @ xmath1 , @ xmath59 for @ xmath60 gev / c @ xmath1 , and @ xmath61 for @ xmath62 gev / c @ xmath1 . the search for topcolor in the @ xmath5 channel has already begun and measurements are in progress . limits are only a consolation here ; the main goal of our search is to determine the nature of the signal . although we do not have experimental evidence for single particle interactions , the @ xmath72 gev / c @ xmath1 signal shows strong fluctuations in all three channels . we must not ignore the remote possibility that these three separate fluctuations may be the first signs of a new universe beyond the standard model . the remaining integrated signal for channel 1b , currently being accumulated and analyzed , has the potential to either kill the signal or produce what may be the most exciting particle physics in its generation . + f . abe et al .
