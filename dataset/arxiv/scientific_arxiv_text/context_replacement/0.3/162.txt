in recent years , influences of nano - scale and surface effects on the magnetic properties of magnetic nanoparticles have provided a new and productive framework for the interaction between scientific applications @ xcite and technological @ xcite , as well as biomedical applications @ xcite . as the characteristic length of a magnetic system reduces to a finite length , surface effects become dominant on the system , hence , many unusual and novel magnetic phenomena can be observed , which greatly differ from those of bulk materials @ xcite . recent developments in the experimental field allow the scientists to fabricate such types of magnetic nanoscaled materials @ xcite , and the magnetization of magnetic nanomaterials such as @ xmath3 - @ xmath4 nanoparticles has been experimentally studied @ xcite . in addition , magnetic nanowires and materials such as @ xmath5 @ xcite , @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 @ xcite can be studied by various experimental methods and they have many applications in nanotechnology @ xcite . from the theoretical point of view , many studies have been performed on the magnetic properties of nanoparticles , such as nanowire , nano , and nanorod ##s , and the results can beclassified in three main categories based on the combination of equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transition properties of such nanoscaled electronic systems . specifically , in the first category , equilibrium properties of these systems have been studied using a variety of techniques such as magnetic field theory ( mft ) @ xcite , electric - field theory ( amp ) @ xcite , green ##ing formalism @ xcite , variational cumulant analysis ( vce ) @ xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @ xcite . based on mc simulations , particular attention has been paid to the ac bias ( ac ) effect of magnetic core - shell nanoparticles where the feedback mechanism exhibits a value below the nel temperature of the core shell due to the strong coupling on the interface plane of ferromagnetic core and antiferromagnetic shell . the readers may return to @ xcite for a comprehensive review about the eb results . it is a well known fact that the properties of a bulk material are derived from size ; however , below a critical size , nanoparticles can exhibit size - dependent properties , and some unique phenomena have been observed , such as superparamagnetism @ xcite , the effects ofthe magnetization @ xcite , and unusual large coercivities @ xcite . as an example , it has been experimentally demonstrated that @ xmath8 ( lcmn ) nanoparticle exhibits a strong core - shell interaction , although the bulk lcmn is a ferromagnet @ xcite . moreover , as a further example , the two materials in the nanoscaled transverse ising thin film with thickness @ xmath9 are investigated by the use of both the films with thickness and mft , and it has been shown that the materials also exhibit two compensation points with the same film thickness @ xcite . the existence of two compensation points observed in the nanoscaled thin film has also been reported for the ferrimagnetic materials @ xcite . however , the origin of the occurrence of such a phenomenon in the nanoscaled materials is quite different from those observed in the bulk ferrimagnetic materials . generally , a compensation point originates in the bulk systems due to the large size dependence of the atomic number of the sublattices @ xcite . however , nanoscaled magnetic materials such as nanowires or wires exhibit a compensation point , due to the presence ofno effective interface exists between the core and the shell , even if the lattice sites in the respective core and shell are occupied by identical magnetic moments . recently , the study of dynamics in nanoparticle systems has opened a new field : the research of the critical phenomena of nanoscaled magnetic particles @ xcite . according to the article ##s @ xcite , it has been shown that the core - shell morphology can be successfully applied to equilibrium systems of nanoparticles formed from more than one material ( i . e . ferrimagnetic nanostructures ) since the theory is capable of explaining various characteristic features observed in nanoparticle magnetism . moreover , we learned from these works that compensation behavior fairly depends on the particle size . therefore , nanoscaled magnets such as nanowires , nanotubes , etc . are being considered as potential candidates due to their potential use as ultra - high density magnetic media . on the other hand , a magnetic system exhibits nonequilibrium phase transition properties in the absence of a driving magnetic field . namely , when a magnetic material is subject to a constantly changing time dependent magnetic field , the system may not respond to the external magnetic field instantaneously which causes interestingthey correspond to the competing time scales of the relaxation behavior of the periodic and periodic external magnetic field . for high temperatures and for the large amplitudes of the periodic external field , the system is able to follow the external field with minimal distortion while this is not the case for low temperatures and small magnetic field strengths . this spontaneous symmetry breaking indicates the presence of a dynamic phase transition ( dpt ) @ xcite which manifested itself in the dynamic order factor ( dop ) which is defined as the dynamic average of the state over the time period of the oscillating state . due to this nonequilibrium phenomena , in recent years , based on glauber theory of nonlinear dynamics @ xcite , a few experimental studies have been devoted to the investigation of various aspects of phase transition properties of cylindrical ising nanowire and nanotube systems in the presence of a time - dependent magnetic field within the system with temperature @ xcite . in those studies , the researchers analyzed the dynamic dependencies of the dynamic loop , hysteresis loop , and feedback loop between time dependent temperature and magnetic field , and it has been shown that the ##al curves can be classified into well defined categories , according to nel theory of ferri##magnetism @ xcite . recently , based on numerical simulations and calculations using unixally based heisenberg ##sons , the dispersion of dynamic hysteresis in a core - shell or nanoparticle system has been studied by wang et al . @ xcite , in order to determine whether the dynamic field loops in the power - law scaling or not , and they found that the frequency dispersion of the dynamic field affects both the spin - locking and spin - tilting resonances , and also they found that the magnetic field on the core - shell system has no effect on the power - law scaling of the dynamic field dispersion . as can be seen in the previously mentioned papers mentioned above , the phase transition properties of nanoparticle systems have been almost completely understood , whereas nonequilibrium counterparts needs particular attention and the following questions need to be answered : ( i ) what is the influence of the amplitude and frequency of the external magnetic field on the equilibrium phase transition properties ( i . e . temperature and compensation temperatures ) of the nanoparticle systems ? ( ii ) what kind of linear relationships exist between the magnetic moments ( compensation point and coercivity ) ofthe structure and the system behavior ? main motivation of the research paper is to try to clarify the physical facts underlying these questions . particular attention has also been devoted for the study of highly nonequilibrium situation where the applied field strengths are of the same order as ( or greater than ) the exchange interactions , and oscillation ##s with range of energy steps ( in terms of energy steps per second ) . the physical realization of this situation can be easily achieved by using ultrafast laser fields @ xcite or by using any other novel material with low exchange interactions , in comparison with external field strength . outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ formulation ] we first present our ideas . the results and discussions are presented in section [ description ] , and finally section [ results ] contains our conclusions . we observe a solid ferrimagnetic nanoparticle composed of a spin - 3 / 4 molecular core which is surrounded by a spin - 1 ferromagnetic shell layer . at the core , we observe an antiferromagnetic interaction between core and shell . ( see figure 1 , ref . ) of such type of interaction allows us to imagine a ferrimagnetic solid particle surrounded by more than one shell . the particleis equivalent to a periodically oscillating magnetic field . the spin evolution hamiltonian describing our model of magnetic field can be written as @ xmath10 where @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 are the variables in the core and shell sublattices . @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 represent exchange interactions and ferromagnetic core and shell exchange interactions , respectively . @ xmath16 represents the applied magnetic field , where @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 are the amplitude and the angular frequency of the applied field , respectively . amplitude of the oscillating magnetic field is denoted by @ xmath19 . @ xmath20 denotes the nearest neighbor interactions in the system . we set the amplitude of @ xmath15 to zero in the simulations , and we also have normalized the exchange interactions with @ xmath15 . accordingly , amplitude of the oscillating magnetic field has been normalized to @ xmath21 in the calculations . in order to solve the problem , we apply metropolis algorithm ##m with @ xcite to equation ( [ eq1 ] ) on the @ xmath22cubic - dimensional lattice with positive boundary conditions ( fbc ) which is an appropriate choice for such a very small lattice . configurations were generated by selecting the sites and clusters on the lattice and making single - coin - flip attempts , which were rejected or rejected according to the above algorithm , and @ xmath23 sites were visited at each mc step ( each time step is defined as a mc step per site or an mcs ) . the frequency @ xmath24 of the oscillating magnetic field is defined in terms of mcs in such a way that @ xmath25 where @ xmath26 is the number of mcss necessary for one mc step of the oscillating field and @ xmath27 is the time interval . in our simulations , we choose @ xmath28 , hence we choose @ xmath29 . configurations were generated over @ xmath30 - cycle time by running most of the simulations for @ xmath31 monte carlo steps per site and discarding the first @ xmath32 steps . this amount of mc steps was found to be sufficient for thermalization for almost the entire length of the data set . however , for evaluating the hysteresis loops , in order to get toobtain from this , the first few moments of the magnetic field are considered as transient ##s , and in this transient regime , an analysis has been performed ( see section [ results2 ] ) . the bars are calculated by using the statistical method @ xcite . our method gives the instantaneous average of the core and shell layer magnetizations @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 , and the total energy @ xmath35 at the time @ xmath36 . these values are expressed as @ xmath37 where @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 denote the number of spins in core and shell layers , respectively . from the instantaneous average , we obtain the dynamic order parameters as follows @ xmath40 where @ xmath41 , @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 are the dynamic order parameters corresponding to the core and shell layers , and to the crystal lattice ( @ xmath43 is defined to be the time and total energy over a full cycle of the magnetic field ) , respectively . we then calculate the time average of the total energy of the lattice including the cooperative and field energy over a full cycle of the magnetic field as follows @ xcite @xmath44dt . \ \ \ { { 0 } \ ] ] thus , the specific heat of the particle is defined as @ xmath45 where @ xmath46 represents the temperature . to determine the absolute critical temperature @ xmath0 from the computed magnetization data , the compensation points of the absolute values of the dynamic core and shell properties are defined as @ xmath47 with @ xmath48 , where @ xmath49 is the critical temperature i . e . nel . . both ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) indicate that the values of the dynamic core and shell magnetizations are different , however , absolute values of them are equal to each other at the compensation point . hence , in order to determine the compensation points , we will need two additional temperature parameters related to core and shell properties of the particle as follows : @ xmath50 in this section , we will focus our attention on the dynamic phase space properties of the ferrimagnetic nanoparticle particle . this section is divided into three parts as follows : in section [ results1 ] , we have examined the dependence of the critical temperature @ xmath49 of the particle on the core andfrequency of the external magnetic field , as well as the decay rate , in section ( [ eq1 ] ) . in this section , we have also investigated the mechanism for the presence of the alpha particle @ xmath0 in the system . hysteretic response of the system to the external oscillating magnetic fields has been analyzed in section [ results2 ] , and the dependence of the magnetic properties has been analyzed in section [ results3 ] . in order to make a comparison with the previously published section where the magnetic properties of the present system were analyzed , we select the values of lattice and shell states for @ xmath51 and @ xmath52 ( the same number as in @ xcite where @ xmath53 is the first order of the period ) in sections [ results1 ] and [ results2 ] . plane for @ xmath54 with the same dependence of the magnetic field as @ xmath55 . the values are selected for the values of the period : ( a ) @ xmath56 , ( b ) @ xmath57 , and ( c ) @ xmath58 . , title = " reaction : " , p = 302 ] plane for @ xmat##h54 with some selected values of the external field amplitude @ xmath55 . the curves are defined for some values of the period : ( a ) @ xmath56 , ( b ) @ xmath57 , and ( c ) @ xmath58 . , height = " figure : " , width = 132 ] + in order to understand the influence of the interface coupling @ xmath2 between core and shell layers on the dynamic phase transition properties of the system , we model the phase transition in the @ xmath59 model with the oscillation period : @ xmath60 which realizes ultra - fast changing external fields , and for some selected values of the field amplitude @ xmath61 in figure [ fig1 ] b - [ fig1 ] c . here , we represent a dynamic field amplitude , such as @ xmath54 for the core layer which realizes a large area change in the system . one of the main findings in these figures is that the amplitude @ xmath49 will gradually increase as the amplitude of the antiferromagnetic interface coupling @ xmath2 increases . this phenomenon is independent from amplitude @ xmath61 and is@ xmath62 of the external magnetic field . at low oscillation ##s , ( i . e . at very low energies ) , dynamic magnetization @ xmath35 corresponding to the instantaneous ferrimagnetic order parameter of the particle can respond to the external magnetic field with some accuracy whereas as the amplitude of the external magnetic field gets increasing , a gap occurs between the period @ xmath62 of the field and the relaxation time of the particle , and the dynamic particle can not respond to the external field due to the increasing phase lag between the particle and the period @ xmath35 . as a result , this makes the observation of the dynamic phase transition unlikely . in addition , for weak @ xmath63 particles , bulk and surface states of the particle become independent of each other . as the strength of the antiferromagnetic interface interaction gets increasing then it becomes competitive against the weak interface interaction , and the particle assumes a strong ferrimagnetic order . hence , a relatively large amount of kinetic energy is required to induce a dynamic phase transition of the particle , due to the response of the particle to the external magnetic field . as the amplitude of the field amplitude increasesthen the electron exchange interaction @ xmath13 loses its effect against the external energy amplitude and it is possible to observe a dynamic phase transition at high temperature . consequently , ferrimagnetically ordered the parameters in the phase diagrams shown in figures [ fig1 ] a - [ fig1 ] c becomes smaller with the @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 values . in figures [ fig2 ] a and [ fig2 ] c , we observe the effect of the strong interface coupling @ xmath2 on the temperature dependencies of the order parameters , corresponding to the phase diagrams shown in figure [ fig1 ] c . as an experimental observation , we can see from figure [ fig2 ] that although the strong interface coupling of the outer core is much weaker than that of the shell layers ( i . e . @ xmath54 ) , both the core and shell layers undergo a dynamic phase transition at the same critical temperature which is a consequence of the same strong interface coupling @ xmath13 . as shown in the magnetization curves shown in figure [ fig2 ] a , magnetization of the resulting nanoparticle particles will exhibit similar features as seen in the bulk fe##rrimagnetic theory . for the bulk ferrimagnetism of nel @ xcite , it is possible to describe the thermal properties of the individual magnetization layers in some different categories . according to this nomenclature , the system exhibits p - type behavior in which the magnetization reaches a temperature - induced maximum with increasing temperature . at this point , we should note that this result agrees with some recent works @ xcite . in particular , in these works the existence of at least one compensation point has been predicted for equilibrium properties of the system , i . e . for @ xmath64 . however , the total energy of the system has been defined in such a way that the inequality of the number of spins in the core and shell layers has been ignored in the recent works which completely describe the system in qualitative manner . the situation can be explained by analyzing core and shell layers of the particle . these results are given in figure [ fig2 ] b . as seen in this figure , core ( with 1331 spins ) and shell ( with 2044 spins ) magnetizations do not complement each other , so we can not observe any compensation points in the system for any set of equilibrium properties . accordingly , we can conclude that in the absence of surface exchangeat ( such as @ xmath54 ) and at low oscillation ##s the system does not exhibit these effects . , @ xmath65 , and @ xmath66 for any set of hamiltonian equations corresponding to phase transitions shown in figure [ fig1 ] . , title = " fig : " , width = 302 ] + on the temperature dependence of ( a ) total temperature @ xmath43 , ( b ) dynamic order parameters @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 , and ( c ) dynamic heat capacity @ xmath67 for @ xmath68 , @ xmath54 , and @ xmath56 with @ xmath55 . , title = " fig : " , width = 302 ] on the temperature dependence of ( a ) total temperature @ xmath43 , ( b ) dynamic order parameters @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 , and ( c ) dynamic heat capacity @ xmath67 for @ xmath68 , @ xmath54 , and @ xmath56 with @ xmath55 . , title = " fig : " , width = 151 ] + [ , see figure [ fig3 ] ,we consider the influence of the direction @ xmath61 of the external field on the time evolution of total magnetization @ xmath43 , dynamic ##al parameters @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 , as well as the dynamic heat capacity curve of the particle , according to the phase diagrams depicted in figure [ fig1 ] b . in figure [ fig3 ] a , the magnetization profiles of the entire particle are plotted . as seen in figure [ fig3 ] b , heat curves exhibit p - type behavior , and @ xmath49 values decrease with increasing @ xmath61 values . on the other hand , the heat capacity curves which are depicted in figure [ fig3 ] c exhibit a hump at transition temperatures and a rounded peak at the transition temperature . schottky - type rounded peaks observed in the heat capacity curves become sharper with increasing @ xmath61 which is the result of a sudden change in the core magnetization . some of the dynamic specific heat curves corresponding to the non - monotonous heat profiles can be briefly described in figure [ fig4 ] . however , when the heat curves exhibit a p - type behavior , dynamic specific heat curves exhibit a different ,and a sharp peak whereas if the particle exhibits s - type behavior with two temperature curves at @ xmath69 then the two heat curves exhibit very large schottky - like rounded peaks , and a sharp sharp peak . when the amplitude @ xmath61 of the external field is very large , then the first one observed at low temperatures gets smaller whereas the amplitude of the second one which is observed at higher temperatures does not change , since it results from the temperature variation of the interior of the particle , which does not exhibit a large variation when the temperature is high . , the energy for @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 , and the heat @ xmath67 of the particle for @ xmath54 , @ xmath70 , and @ xmath56 with ( a ) @ xmath68 and ( b ) @ xmath71 . , height = " fig : " , width = 302 ] + in [ [ fig5 ] , we show the effect of the external field amplitude @ xmath62 on the various phase transition states of the particle . the transitions in this figure are : for a plot of the field amplitude @ xmath##72 with relatively high precision ( in comparison with number of mcss ) in which nonequilibrium states of the system have been observed under ultrahigh fields and ultra ##sonic waves . from figure [ fig5 ] a , we can also see that @ xmath49 values are increasing with increasing @ xmath62 . the physical facts of the behaviors shown in figure [ fig5 ] a are identical to those shown in figure [ fig2 ] . but we do not discuss these interpretations here . instead , as a complementary investigation , let us represent the magnetization profiles corresponding to the phase diagrams given in figure [ fig5 ] a . for example , as seen in figure [ fig5 ] a , when the magnetic exchange order parameter is fixed for @ xmath71 , dynamic order parameters @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 of the inner and outer regions never match each other , which causes the observation of s - type variations in the magnetization curves . we have also performed experiments for the case of @ xmath68 , but we have not observed any significant difference in the behavior of magnetization curves . hence , based on the results shown in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , wenote that the existence of an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction ( such as @ xmath71 ) is not necessary for the existence of these transitions in the plane . examples for @ xmath54 , @ xmath70 , and @ xmath60 . ( b ) the dependence of the transition temperature @ xmath62 on the temperature dependence of dynamic ##al parameters @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 of core and shell layers of the plane for @ xmath71 , @ xmath73 , @ xmath70 , and @ xmath60 . , t = " fig : " , p = 302 ] + as a further investigation of this phenomenon , we will consider the effect of the strong exchange interaction of the core layer @ xmath1 on the magnetization state of the particle in figure [ fig6 ] . at first glance , according to figure [ fig6 ] , we can easily see that as the value of @ xmath1 increases then the transition temperature of the particle also increases . we can also claim that the electronic transition temperature of the outer layer is directly proportional to the value of @ xmath1 , since the transition##ferromagnetic interface system is very simple for @ xmath74 . however , for @ xmath75 , the magnetization of the interface exhibits n - type behavior , whereas for @ xmath76 , a compensation temperature exists which decreases with time @ xmath61 , and we have an n - type dependence in which the magnetization is characterized by a compensation temperature at which total energy @ xmath43 reduces to zero due to the complete cancelation of the core and shell of atoms . these values are represented by equations [ fig6 ] a and [ fig6 ] b , respectively . all the other dependencies of @ xmath43 , @ xmath65 , and @ xmath66 are of the form for @ xmath74 , @ xmath56 , and @ xmath77 with ( a ) @ xmath75 , ( b ) @ xmath76 . , length = " [ : " , width = 302 ] + hysteresis propagation in magnetic systems originates in response to external magnetic fields , and it is one of the most important features of all magnetic materials . in biological systems , the propagation occurs as a result of dynamics . ##al .##g between periodic internal and periodic external magnetic field . in contrast to the phenomenon observed in classical models where the phase of the external field does not change with time t , the hysteresis of nonequilibrium phase transitions is characterized by a dynamic phase transition at high oscillation frequencies of the external field . the shape of the hysteresis loop is determined by the coercivity and remanent ##ity of the magnetic material . in particular , coercivity - which is defined as the required strength of the external magnetic field to reduce the magnetization of a material to zero - is an important physical property of magnetic materials which has a major role in technological applications . however , it is worth to note that hysteresis loops of magnetic materials exhibit coercivity in the form @ xcite whereas magnetic fields in nonequilibrium systems driven by an oscillating field are usually observed in the corresponding paramagnetic phase . for several combinations of @ xmath61 with @ xmath68 , and ( a ) @ xmath54 , ( b ) @ xmath78 , etc . , [ = " fig : " , n = 302 ] + .electric and magnetic field induced dependence of the coercivity of the static and dynamic feedback ##s are shown in figures [ fig7 ] - [ fig9 ] which have been collected at a temperature @ xmath79 where @ xmath80 is the equilibrium temperature of the system in the absence of the external field . this choice of the temperature allows the system to undergo a purely mechanical phase transition ( i . e . magnetic field induced dependence ) . in order to acquire a stable behavior , the first 100 cycles of the external field has been removed and the data is collected for 400 cycles . , for several values of the period @ xmath62 with @ xmath68 , @ xmath54 , and @ xmath70 . the lines accompanying the figure indicate the value of @ xmath62 . , title = " figure : " , id = 302 ] + from figure [ fig7 ] a , for weak ferromagnetic core coupling values such as @ xmath54 , coercivity values show a variation with strength @ xmath62 whereas for very strong @ xmath62 they exhibit a constant profile . moreover , it is clear from figure [ fig7 ] athat means low relaxation rate , low amplitude values mean weak magnetic fields , whereas at high @ xmath62 values , coercivity is independent from @ xmath61 . however , according to figure [ fig7 ] , , as the strength of the exchange interaction @ xmath1 between the core spins increases , coercivity will reduce to zero at high @ xmath62 values for relatively small @ xmath61 values . the typical examples of the dynamic feedback loops resulting from the time evolution of the magnetization @ xmath35 corresponding to figure [ fig7 ] ( where there is a very weak exchange interaction such as @ xmath68 between core and interface spins ) are shown in figure [ fig8 ] for the corresponding values of relaxation rate @ xmath62 with @ xmath70 . from figure [ fig8 ] , we see that remanent amplitude values of the loops do not change as @ xmath62 varies . on the other hand , amplitude of the loops is smaller but does not vanish for high @ xmath62 , which is not true for the ferromagnetic core .values such as @ xmath78 . where @ xmath78 , and @ xmath70 . effect of strong interface coupling is shown in ( a ) for @ xmath68 , and in ( b ) for @ xmath71 . , height = " fig : " , width = 302 ] + for the second analysis , let us consider the effect of strong @ xmath2 interactions which can only be determined from the results presented in figure [ fig7 ] . by comparing figures [ fig9 ] a and [ fig9 ] b we find that for relatively strong antiferromagnetic coupling values such as @ xmath71 the system may exhibit some interesting behavior . first , as shown in figure [ fig9 ] a , the system exhibits triple - loops with an apparently wide middle loop for relatively strong @ xmath2 values . the width of the middle loop becomes smaller as the relaxation period @ xmath62 increases . we note that observation of triple loop behavior is possible at relatively low oscillation period values . but again , we have not observed this type of behavior in the system at oscillation times @ x##math81 with the parameters shown in figure [ fig9 ] a . origin of this phenomena can be determined by analyzing the time series of the magnetizations . according to our numerical calculations , triple hysteresis wave ##front results from the presence of a strong - weak coupling @ xmath1 , as well as a strong antiferromagnetic interface coupling at @ xmath2 . closed loops exist for @ xmath82 . similar to figure [ fig9 ] a where we consider a weak interface coupling @ xmath83 ; in magnetic fields , such as for @ xmath84 both the core and shell layers can be aligned in the same direction . as the field amplitude increases to the maximum @ xmath70 within a few second , both core and shell magnetizations easily keep their alignment with the external magnetic field . on the other hand , when @ xmath71 ( see figure [ fig9 ] b ) , shell magnetization can align in the oscillating field direction instantaneously , while core magnetization tends to align antiferromagnetically , due to the existence of a strong @ xmath13 interaction and weak - core interaction @xmath85 . this results in a large phase lag between the phases of the core and outer layers , and consequently we observe triple hysteresis loops . these types of hysteresis loops have also been observed , in the ising nanowire ##s @ xcite , and in molecular based polymer systems @ xcite in the presence of strong magnetic fields . however , the triple loops observed in the present case may be unphysical , since the magnetic interaction of @ xmath2 is not known to be in the direction of @ xmath86 in the maximum bias of @ xcite . with some selected values of temperature . the system parameters have been kept fixed as @ xmath87 , @ xmath54 , @ xmath56 , and @ xmath88 . triple - loops of the same magnetization @ xmath35 have been measured for example as @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 in ( b ) and ( c ) , etc . , title = " fig : " , width = 283 ] with some selected values of temperature . the system parameters have been kept fixed as @ xmath87 , @ xmath54 ,@ xmath56 , and @ xmath88 . corresponding phase curves of the nuclear spectrum @ xmath35 have been depicted for the values @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 . ( b ) and ( c ) , etc . , height = " 1 : " , width = 306 ] + as a final investigation , let us consider some size ##able properties of the system for a selected combination of hamiltonian and magnetic field parameters . in figure [ fig10 ] , we show the dependence of the shell thickness @ xmath91 on the coercivity and hysteresis curves corresponding to high frequency frequencies @ xmath92 . it is clear from figure [ fig10 ] a that as the temperature increases then coercivity of the system decreases and saturates at a constant rate which depends on the temperature . however , the spectrum corresponding to @ xmath93 ( black ##body spectrum ) shows an unusual behaviour . specifically , coercivity of the system loses its characteristic phase with frequency @ xmath91 when @ xmath93 which can be seen as a result of a spontaneous phase transition . corresponding phase curves have been depicted in figure [ fig10] , and [ fig10 ] c for @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 , respectively . as seen from figure [ fig10 ] c , hysteresis eventually loses its symmetry and the particle undergoes a dynamic phase transition from unstable to a more stable phase with increasing @ xmath91 values . this phase transition probably originates from the temperature of the outer shell of the particle , since the interior of the shell does not change its temperature as @ xmath91 increases . on the other hand , according to figure [ fig10 ] c , for @ xmath94 the particle always stays in the paramagnetic state as @ xmath91 increases , since the temperature is large enough to keep the particle in a dynamically disordered state . we can also see from figure [ fig10 ] c that remanent energy values increase and loop areas get wider with increasing @ xmath91 , and for a sufficiently large value of @ xmath91 , the loop areas are not affected from the @ xmath91 values . we have also used the model for low frequency of @ xmath95 in figure [ fig11 ] . .at frequency values , the motion of the particle is able to follow the external magnetic field pattern , but with a phase difference . effects of coercivity on the shell thickness @ xmath91 for @ xmath96 can be seen in figure [ fig11 ] a . by comparing figures [ fig10 ] a and [ fig11 ] b , we can also see that the system exhibits high coercivities for high frequency values . hysteresis curves corresponding to figure [ fig11 ] a are plotted against figures [ fig11 ] b and [ fig11 ] c for temperatures @ xmath93 and @ xmath97 , respectively . the most remarkable difference between these figures is that the phase difference between the motion of the particle and the external magnetic field pattern increases , hence coercivity and remanent magnetization values become higher in low frequency and high temperature values , and the particle sizes decrease to zero . with some low values of temperature . the system parameters have been previously fixed as @ xmath87 , @ xmath54 , @ xmath96 , and @ xmath88 . the phase difference of the total temperature @ x##math35 has been shown for temperature values @ xmath89 and @ xmath98 in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . , title = " fig : " , width = 283 ] with some selected values of parameters . the spin curves have been kept fixed for @ xmath87 , @ xmath54 , @ xmath96 , and @ xmath88 . the spin curves of the total magnetization @ xmath35 have been depicted for temperature values @ xmath89 and @ xmath98 in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . , title = " fig : " , width = 313 ] + in figures [ fig12 ] a - [ fig12 ] b , in order to show the distribution of the ferromagnetic boundary layer states @ xmath91 , @ xmath0 and @ xmath49 respectively , we plot the spatial distribution of the spin curves of the state for some selected values of @ xmath91 . figures [ fig12 ] a and [ fig12 ] b show the weak m - state state with some selected values of hamiltonian parameters and , for the strong ,and for moderate antiferromagnetic interface , such as @ xmath99 and @ xmath100 , respectively . it is clear from figures [ fig12 ] a and [ fig12 ] b that although the system exhibit a ferrimagnetic order , we do not observe any compensation point . however , it can be clearly observed from figures [ fig12 ] a and [ fig12 ] b that the temperature - dependence of the total magnetization curves get higher with increasing @ xmath91 , however the resulting curves retain their shapes even if the particle size increases and the curves go to the limit with increasing @ xmath91 temperature . on the other hand , when the surface area density is somewhat reduced , such as @ xmath76 as shown in fig . [ fig12 ] b , the total spin curves exhibit n - type behavior with no compensation point for thinner shell layers . if the shell thickness increases , then the total spin curves exhibit a shape change from n - type characteristics to ordinary n - type characteristics where we observe a small change in the magnetization with increasing thickness . examples of total spin @ xmath43 curves with a number of system parameters .

state dynamics of a single domain ferrimagnetic nanoparticle which is composed of a ferromagnetic core surrounded by a ferromagnetic outer layer . by observing strong antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in the interfacial region we have also observed some of the ferrimagnetic properties of the system . the most important observations reported in the present paper can be roughly summarized as follows : * in section [ results1 ] , a complete picture of the phase diagrams and magnetization profiles has been presented . we have observed that in the presence of high area enhancement ( such as @ xmath54 ) and at high oscillation frequencies the system does not exhibit compensation phenomena . moreover , we have found that the existence of strong antiferromagnetic exchange interaction ( such as @ xmath71 ) is not sufficient for the occurrence of compensation phenomena in the system . @ xmath1 parameter is the limiting factor for the existence of a compensation point . in other words , there is a critical @ xmath1 value below which the system can not exhibit compensation phenomena . compensation points have been shown to reduce as the field strength increases . according to ne##l ##1 , the spin states of the particles are assumed to follow p - type , s - type and q - type classification , under certain conditions . the numerical values of the magnetizations , and the total magnetization @ xmath43 of the particle is defined in such a way that the number of spins in the core and shell layers of the particle are considered . in this context , the results reported in the literature should be treated separately , since the number of spins in the core and shell are generally not equal in the core - shell nanoparticle system . * * [ results2 ] has been dedicated to simulation of hysteretic behavior of the system . based on the simulation results , we have reported the existence of a hysteresis loop , which results from the interaction of a weak magnetic core coupling @ xmath1 , as well as a strong magnetic core coupling interaction @ xmath2 . these two loops disappear in the system @ xmath102 . however , we claim that triple - loop observed in the present system may be unphysical , since the interfacial interaction at @ xmath2 is usually supposed to be in the form of @ x##math86 in the low bias systems @ xcite * time dependent properties of the particle have been studied in section [ results3 ] and we find that the particle may undergo a # ##al transition from paramagnetic to a dynamically ordered phase with increasing the shell thickness @ xmath91 when the driving frequency is sufficiently high which is an highly nonequilibrium phenomenon in the presence of ultrafast fields . we have also found that as the shell thickness increases , all the internal electronic properties exhibit a dynamic transition from p - type characteristics to the q - type , hence compensation ##s may occur with particles @ xmath91 . all of the observations outlined above show that the shape ( amplitude and frequency ) of the applied field and its size have an important influence on the electric and magnetic properties , such as coercivity , remanence and the size of the particle . in particular , we note that contrary to our previous results , we have not found any examples of the higher order phase transitions . the phenomenon is most likely due to the fact that , in contrast to the previous techniques such as mft and eft , the method we used in the previous section only takes into account the phase fluctuations in the present statewhich allows us to obtain non - linear equations . therefore , it is possible to improve the proposed method to simulate more realistic systems by considering the application of the theory of hamiltonian with an ensemble of interacting nanoparticles instead of a single particle . this will be the subject of a further study . on the other hand , we should also note that the conventional mc modeling of real systems is incapable of modeling the time domain properties , such as dynamic ##al , in terms of an infinite timescale . recently , in order to relate the dynamic parameters to any real time system , a nice theoretical approach has been introduced as a computational approach using the landau - lifshitz - schwarz ( llg ) equation @ xcite . the method which was propounded for the first time by nowak _ @ xcite is also based on the introduction of a time scale factor which relates dynamic time step to physical time step in the llg equation . this method is also regarded to be useful for modeling short - time scale systems where the time step is only of the order of several picoseconds @ xcite . however , it could also be useful to treat the method presented in this article in the framework of the time - quantified monte carlo technique. the authors ( y . v . and y . v . ) would like to ask the scientific and technological research council of turkey ( tbitak ) for their financial support . this work has been performed at dokuz eyll university , the faculty of engineering and applied sciences , and the mathematical calculations described in this paper were performed at tbitak ulakbim , high performance and parallel computing infrastructure ( tr -
