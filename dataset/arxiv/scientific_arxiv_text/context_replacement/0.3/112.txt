the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) will rank as one of the major scientific achievements of this era . their detection will open up a new observation window to the universe , revealing new sources of strong field of gravity previously inaccessible through conventional astronomical instruments . our understanding of space - time and gravity under the most extreme conditions will be enhanced . although there has been no direct detection of gws to date , indirect evidence for their existence comes from high resolution , nobel - prize winning measurements of the pulsar psr 1913 + 1 and its companion neutron star ( [UNK] ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? the gw emission that causes the ' s orbital inclination is in agreement with the predictions of general relativity to better than 1 % @ xcite . when the binary neutron star ( sm ) systems first form , they are expected to produce copious amounts of gws @ xcite . these sources will be prime candidates for the next generation of gw detectors , led by advanced ligo ( aligo ; * ? ? ? * ) which is expected to begin observing during the second half of 2015 and advanced virgo a year later @ xcite . at full mass , these advanced detectors are expected to detect neutron stars at aboutrate within the range 0 . 4400 hz @ xmath0 @ xcite . compact neutron stars ( cbcs ) consisting of at least one black hole ( bh ) are common targets for gw detectors ; although there is strong evidence for their existence @ xcite , the time horizons of these candidates for aligo detection are not yet known . one hypothesis in the last decade is that transient ##s of ns / ns and ns / ns * could be the source of super - hard gamma ray bursts ( sgrbs ) ; transient ##s routinely occur throughout the electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum @ xcite . there are other types of em , radio and cosmic ray bursts that may also be associated with gw detectors . these include long - period gamma ray bursts ( lgrbs ; * ? ? ? * ) , short - ray repeaters @ xcite , pulses @ xcite , fast radio bursts @ xcite as well as others . history has also shown that multi - source astronomy can play an important role in discovering these bursts . in the last decade , x - ray , optical and radio follow - ups have all transformed and enabled new developments in our understanding of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ); combining em observations with those of the gw network would too provide new insight into the search mechanisms and algorithms that work with a variety of light sources . a new generation of large , wide - field telescopes , advancements in time domain astronomy and upgrades to infrared and cosmic ray detectors can provide a global network for em . the successful simultaneous detection of photons , neutrinos or high energy particles with gws would be a landmark achievement for em , marking a new era of _ _ multi - messenger _ _ astronomy , for the first time including gw . maximising the potential offered by gw also enables the development of a worldwide , multi - source network . australian collaborations are ideally placed to facilitate scientific exchanges in this new era and many have already been established . to conduct em follow - ups of gw observations , memorandum of understanding ( mous ) have been signed between the ligo / virgo gw collaboration and a number of telescopes either based in australia or with significant australian funding ; these include : the anglo - australian telescope , the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ; * ? ? ? * ) , the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ; * ? ? ? * ) , the high energy stereoscopic telescope ( hi. r . m . anderson ; * ? ? ? * ) , icecube @ xcite , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the skymapper @ xcite , the gw galactic transient observer ( goto ) and zadko @ xcite optical telescopes . in this paper , we focus on the most probable multi - messenger observations from the advanced detector systems ; those associated with grbs . whilst doing this , we discuss the contributions that the various facilities can make to the overall multi - messenger effort . the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 describes gw sources . sections 3 and 4 introduce sgrbs and lgrbs and describe how co - ordinated gw and multiwavelength observations of these events can provide useful results . section 5 serves as a guide for those unfamiliar with the techniques and methods of detection and data analysis often used in the gw domain ; this section is not designed to be comprehensive but to describe some of the most basic concepts of gw detection and data analysis . section 6 describes the data sensitivity and detection requirements for gw sources . the next two sections describe some of the concepts that form the basis for coordinated gwand em research in the gw era . section 7 discusses the first gw observations ; these could likely be the first coincident gw - em event through the gw data . section 8 discusses the successful follow - up of gw triggers ; this strategy is extremely challenging due to the high theoretical uncertainties of gw , but the potential rewards for success are without doubt highly significant . section 9 discusses the australian facilities involved in the co - operative science collaboration with aligo / adv and we highlight the ways in which they could contribute to this new frontier . finally , in section 10 we discuss the role neutrino follow - up plays in gw astronomy . gravitational waves are detected in regions of space - time that are distorted by high velocity bulk particles of matter . the timescale of the observations determines the strength of the gw signal ; ground based telescopes can target objects with frequencies in the range 110 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 , which is in the 1 hz10 frequency band . this frequency range , called the audio band , has motivated the concept of interferometric gw known as ` ` listening to the universe ' ' . instruments capable of such detections will begin operation in the second half of 2015 . advancedligo , a network of very advanced interferometric detectors at hanford and livingston ( usa * ? ? ? * ) will begin its first observational science run ( o1 ) in 2014 - 2015 ; a year later it will be joined by the italian telescope network ( adv ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) for its second observing run ( o2 ) . the ` ` new ' ' network of interferometric gw detectors will eventually have three times the sensitivity of the previous two detectors . the increased sensitivity translates into a factor @ xmath3 increase in observed volume , making observation difficult rather than plausible . more instruments are expected to eventually join the network . kagra , a chinese detector , is envisioned to begin operation in 2018 - 19 @ xcite and ligo - india is expected to be operational from 2020 , reaching a peak performance of the same level as aligo by late 2022 @ xcite . the gw observations made by these instruments will differ from most other em observations in several ways : 1 . gws are not scattered or obscured by intervening material or dust to provide a window into the outer regions of the universe . as gw detectors observe an abundance rather than a flux , the method of detect##ability has an inverse relationship with distance rather than the usual inverse square law . therefore , number counts of a given distribution of x - candle sources increases with distance , @ xmath4 , as , @ xmath5 , as than , @ xmath6 ; 3 . as gws orbit closely to the universe , even the local astronomical sources of gws tend to be highly energetic emitters of gravitational radiation ; 4 . gw detectors are highly sensitive , with a nearly @ xmath7 steradian sensitivity to astronomical sources with a better than average resolution of more than 90 % of the sky . the first point is that gw detectors can allow us to detect astronomical sources only by conventional means . the detection window can also enable further explorations into the low to intermediate redshift universe ( @ xmath8 ) of sources that are electromagnetically active for much , or all , of their lifetime . the second point means that a factor 4 increase in the sensitivity of a gw detector results in a factor 8 increase in the size of the source being probed . the third point emphasises a strong window for detecting the most highly energetic astronomical sources . the energy levels of gw sources are of the @xmath9 jy , far higher than the fluxes currently observed in the radio spectrum ( @ xmath10jy jy ) . the double emission means that gw emission can reach survey instruments over a wide band of frequencies ( 105000 mhz ) . there are a number of types of em counterparts that could be associated with gw emission @ xcite . while some of these models are quite speculative , this paper focuses on gw emission associated with grbs . possible sources of both em and gw emission include single as well as double emission lines from nss ; for a discussion of the latter , see the main article in this series @ xcite . in the next few pages we have a summary of the sgrbs and lgrbs and the type of gw / em interactions that could be targeted in the gw era . some of these models are based on solid foundations whilst some are quite speculative . in considering the latter , we note that when a new window of observation has been opened in the past , the discoveries that improve our understanding of the universe have often been the least understood . + gravitational effects from the merger of the binary systems of sm / ns and ns / sm are also predicted to be obser##vable em counterparts . this expectation is a consequence of the association between these events and sgrbs ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? the evidence comes from a number of different sources . firstly , the dynamic timescales of events predicted from the merger of cbcs are consistent with the existence of sgrbs . secondly , the break - up of sgrbs has not provided an em counterpart . third , sgrb ##s have been observed to galaxies with large stellar populations with offsets of order tens of kpc from their galactic center ; this is consistent with post - merger * ##backs of 100s of km s @ xmath0 , and consistent with the shorter and shorter duration afterglows expected from an old interstellar medium with a large radius . finally , as previously discussed by [ kilonova ] , the discovery of a new em transient by a _ kilonova _ has provided the strongest experimental evidence to date of the sgrb / cbc association . further proof of the cbc / sgrb association can be obtained from gw observations . coincident em and gw observations of sgrbs could beprovide a fascinating insight to the dominant mechanism at the core of grbs . low - power gw ##bs could provide multi - wavelength follow - up analysis of the prompt emission , constraining both the nuclear reaction rate and the emission mechanisms at hand . real - time multi - wavelength follow - ups could provide insight and further coverage of the sgrb mechanism . a number of em counterparts have been proposed to accompany the inspiral and merger of ns / ns and ns / cs systems . in figure [ fig _ 1 _ scenarios ] we discuss the possible outcomes of these scenarios and in the following sections we will also review the most likely em counterparts that could be observed . during the early stages of the merger of a close system , the system is expected to produce a highly energetic jet that interaction with itself and the surrounding region ( the standard model for grbs ; e . g . * ? ? ? ) of material moving at high velocities within the jet will lead to intense emission , giving short - lived bursts of gamma - rays that we detect as the sgrb prompt emission . if the accretion timescale is predicted to be @ xmath112 and @ xcite , the grbs associated withcompact binary bursts are generally shorter in duration than those associated with core - collapse supernovae ( see the relative abundance of grbs ; * ? ? ? . however , the difference between these two populations is not easily identifiable from the observed gamma - ray bursts alone ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . a number of _ fermi _ - observed grbs have observed @ xmath12gev emission ( even at distances as distant as @ xmath13 ) . these bursts were observed with gamma - ray bursts of energies up to 94gev ( grb 130427a ) and 62gev ( grb 131231a ) this supports the hypothesis that the # ##s may be higher than previously assumed @ xcite . significantly , these observations have not been limited to lgrbs , with sgrbs often exhibiting high energy photons and gev emission often continuing for several s of time after the initial burst . the fact that _ fermi _ - has detected a burst of energy 31gev during the prompt phase of grb 090510 @ xcite is promising for co - operative observations between gw ##p and ground - based cherenkov .arrays @ xcite and arrays @ xmath12 ##0 gev . additionally , sgrbs with time - extended emission have also been suggested as possible candidates for cherenkov - arrays @ xcite . another exciting possibility is the observation of prompt optical emission . so far , these processes have not been observed in lgrbs @ xcite . the prompt optical emission associated with the prompt x - ray could have a different origin due to the forward shocks @ xcite . a number of studies have suggested that compact binary mergers could generate prompt coherent radio bursts ( e . g . , * ? ? ? ) mechanisms from excitation of the plasma during a compact binary merger by gws @ xcite , from the self - generated magnetic field during the collision @ xcite , or from the onset of the collision of the forward shock with the surrounding medium @ xcite . however , the detectability of emission from these sources will be dependent upon the scattering by the surrounding environment @ xcite . therefore , these results suggest compact binary mergers are an interesting candidate for the generation of galactic radio bursts ( frbs ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which are currently unknown . bursts and flares in x - ray light emission at gr##bs show signatures of further energy release . this could be caused by late - stage accretion onto a central black hole ( unlikely in the closest star system ; possible also at * ? ? ? * ) , or from ongoing energy release from the spindown of a newly born neutron star . however , recent studies ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) have shown that the merger of two nss could result in a supramassive star ; a star with a mass greater than the non - stellar minimum mass but supported from further collapse and expansion @ xcite . over 60 % of x - ray burst light curves of sgrbs observed by the _ swift _ satellite @ xcite have shown periods exceeding 10010000 years after the burst ; these have been attributed to the spin - off emission from protomagnetars @ xcite formed via the merger of two neutron stars @ xcite . observations of the plateau phase can also be used to determine the stellar equation of state , with gw observations of the inspiral phase significantly affecting this phase @ xcite if the post - burst remnant is an intense , early morning afterglow as well as the magnitudethe r band ( at a temperature of @ xmath14 mpc ; see [ section _ temperature _ ranges ] ) could be produced from dissipation of a neutron - beamed protomagnetar ##ium @ xcite . this magnetar system could launch ejecta at high velocity which would interact with the surrounding medium and produce a very broadband afterglow from gravitational waves @ xcite . gravitational wave emission could also produce an energy loss if a millisecond magnetar is born from the source . several mechanisms for producing such gws exist in nascent neutron stars , including @ bar ##yon ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , @ xmath15 - 2 @ xcite , and magnetic - field induced stellar winds @ xcite . this phenomenon could be observable by aligo ##sing to @ xmath16 mpc @ xcite . in fact , the x - ray light curve itself can be used to estimate the total gw produced from these systems @ xcite . neutron stars with sgrbs have an extremely slow transition phase , often interpreted as the transition of the nascent neutron star tosee black hole @ xcite . gravitational waves could also produce a frb when the magnetic field lines snap as they cross the spectral line @ xcite , which is expected to occur @ xmath17 s after the event @ xcite . a low - gw trigger could enable further follow - ups to confirm this event @ xcite . as the relativistic field expands , it collides with the medium of the progenitor resulting in a forward shock extending into the surrounding medium , and a reverse shock extending back into the medium ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? these shock fronts produce multi - wavelength shock waves , initially peaking in the x - region and passing through the same wavelengths to radio as it does . the typical emission of grbs is similar to the forward shock , and the brightness of this afterglow is dependent upon a number of parameters , including the density of the surrounding medium . therefore , in a low density environment , the forward shock emission is expected to be very weak . the multi - wavelength spectra of sgrbs have been observed and are much brighter than those of lgrbs @ xcite . this is consistent with sgrb##s are less common than lgrbs and with their locations in lower density environments . the reverse phenomenon has also been observed for sgrb 051221a ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ) . a ` kilonova ' has been predicted to result from the merger of two nss . this unusual ##er emission is caused by the beta decay of the ejected neutron rich matter @ xcite and could be around 21 - 24 mag in the ir and 21 - 24 mag in the nir for a peak of 1 mpc @ xcite . recent optical and near - infrared follow - up observations of grb 130603b have provided the most conclusive evidence to date of this phenomenon , reinforcing the hypothesis that compact cluster mergers are the progenitors of sgrbs @ xcite . these observations have added significantly to other observational evidence in support of this hypothesis @ xcite . prompt em and gw observations could suggest that sgrbs are indeed the result of coalescing from clusters . an unusual prompt em emission due to the kilonova mechanism has also recently been suggested for @ xcite . this has been supported by studies that suggest a small fraction of the ejected neutron rich matter could decay fast enough to the s - typeand @ xcite . the result is that @ xmath18 - emission from free electrons in the outermost part of this ejecta could power optical pulses over a timescale of years after the merger , peaking at around magnitude 22 in the l - band for a source . for a source of 1 mpc this signal would peak at around magnitude 22 in the u - band and would act as a precursor to the kilonova . lgrbs are amongst the most powerful transient ##s in the universe in terms of em energy per unit viewing area . these radio bursts have been observed to range up to @ xmath19 and @ xcite and to have a total energy comparable to that of the sun over its entire 20 gyr lifetime . the high luminosities allow lgrbs to be seen out to large volumes , making them a part of the high energy universe ( @ xmath20 ) . the favoured scenario for these bursts is described in the collapsar model @ xcite in which the outer part of a wolf - rayet star slowly collapses to form a rapidly rotating black hole . high angular momentum causes the infalling gas to form an accretion disk , which in turnusing the energy released to drive an ultra - relativistic engine that winds its way through the solar wind . the observed radiation is produced by direct and / or indirect compton emission from the accelerated electrons in internal and external systems . some researchers have suggested instead that the central core may consist of magnetars @ xcite . there is observational evidence to support this scenario for at least a proportion of lgrbs @ xcite . the association between lgrbs with the collapse of massive stars @ xcite has been supported by afterglow observations in galaxies near other regions of active star - formation ; particularly dwarf starburst field galaxies @ xcite . as mentioned above , their cooler temperatures , as well as their higher light levels , mean that the multiwavelength afterglows of lgrbs are typically brighter than those that result from sgrbs @ xcite . in terms of gw emission from these events , a number of lgrbs have been associated with core - collapse supernova @ xcite . modeling the gw emission from these supernovae is very difficult , requiring a combination of the relativistic effects , magnetic fields , rotation , r ##s and chemical reactions @ xcite . these includeso far provides a picture of a highly complex and complex burst that includes shock waves and turbulence that create highly complex waveforms with multiple sharp bursts of varying durations . however , some studies suggest the burst would have to be within tens of kpc for detection . as most lgrbs occur at short distances , the vast majority of their gw signals would be out of reach for advanced detectors . the requirement for rapid rotation to rotate the disc of a grb @ xcite allows for complex spectral lines that could produce detectable gws out to tens of mpc @ xcite . fragmentation instabilities could be detected in the burst and in the disc @ xcite . rapid rotation could also give rise to rotational instabilities in the protoneutron star system @ xcite a number of studies have suggested there exists a sub - class of lgrbs known as low - luminosity grbs ( _ _ ll _ _ grbs ) . these stars have roughly similar x - ray luminosities 2 - 3 orders of magnitude to classical lgrbs @ xcite and have only been observed at z - @ xmath21 due to their low energy levels ( the highest is grb980425 at z = ) .0085 or 36mpc ) . as such their rates have been estimated to be 23 % of magnitude greater than lgrbs . observations have confirmed that both lgrbs and _ _ ll _ _ grbs produce supernovae , and that the _ _ ll _ _ grbs may actually be lower - energy events from the source of the burst . this has been a long going concern and attempts to address it have included an analysis @ xcite , approach to the galactic velocity distribution @ xcite , and simulation @ xcite . the suggestion that _ _ ll _ _ grbs could be a normal lgrbs viewed off - axis was rejected based on statistical arguments , as it would have a far greater local brightness variation than expected from lgrbs and would have higher observation angles for lgrbs than determined from the breaks in afterglow lightcurves @ xcite . recently , an analysis of _ _ ll _ _ grb 060218 has suggested that the brightness difference between the two bursts comes from an extremely low - mass envelope . _ _ the existence of such an envelope would reflect the light and produce a mildly relativistic jet resulting in a much lower luminosity than that produced by the anti - relativist##ic ##v that is able to pass through the same progenitor star . interestingly , the same evidence suggesting different mechanisms put forward by @ xcite could also support these two possible scenarios . it is also possible that gw emission mechanisms could be controlled by the same type of mechanism for both these scenarios . the output from a single gw detector consists of a time series data stream , @ xmath22 , composed of the frequency response to a gw signal , @ xmath23 , and the detector noise @ xmath24 : @ xmath25 in general , @ xmath23 will be a linear combination of the two corresponding transverse polarizations , @ xmath26 , represented by the dimensionless orthogonal scattering matrix used for the two polarizations @ xmath27 : @ xmath28 which represents the detector response to light of different wavelengths , incident from different directions @ xcite . the directions , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 , represent the direction to the source and @ xmath31 represents the polarization direction of the wave . a gw signal will follow the path of a gw signal , and the time series is generally represented in the frequency domain by the strain - energy density , @xmath32 . this quantity is defined through the power spectral density @ xmath33 , with @ xmath34 the fourier transform of the time series . similarly , one can define a signal power spectral density , @ xmath35 , and a strain power spectral density , @ xmath36 . the strain power spectral density is defined as : @ xmath37 with values of @ xmath38 @ xcite . this figure is often used in astronomy to display the results of gw detectors . a typical gw detector does not determine the polarization state or propagation direction of a given signal . to obtain source information , a widely separated network of gw detectors is essential . such a network may employ techniques such as _ simultaneous analysis _ , in which individual signals from different sources are combined in time @ xcite , or _ coherent analysis _ , in which synchronized signal outputs are merged before searching for a common pattern @ xcite . by effectively resolving the different times of arrival of gw signals from members of a network , the network analysis allows a phased array to provide an all - around image with high angular resolution in all viewing directions . this high angular resolution is of particular importance for gw / em associations . for the mostas in this example , directional ##ity is determined through analysis of arrival times . to reduce the time delays , and to improve directionality , it is advantageous that a network be as geographically - based as possible @ xcite and as such , a number of detectors are planned to join the aligo / adv network within the next decade . the japanese detector kagra , should begin operations sometime around 2018 - 2019 @ xcite ; by 2020 , this detector could increase the directional precision of a aligo / adv network by a factor of 1 . 5 - 2 and the detection rate by a similar factor @ xcite . ligo - india operating at aligo , will be added to the aligo / adv network by 2022 by 2020 bnss will be detectable out to @ xmath39200 mpc and up to 100 events are detected per second @ xcite . an advanced detector will increase the angular resolution required to increase the percentage of gw events detected per 100 deg @ xmath40 from 3 - 5 % to 17 % @ xcite . it has long been thought that a gw detector in india would add the longest signal to the already existing detector network ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; *? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? for example , adding an australian detector to an aligo / adv three detector network would reduce the error in solid angle to tens of arc - minutes for all signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) signals @ xcite , thus providing the ability to localise gw sources for multi - year follow - up observations . this benefit could be realized when next generation detectors such as the ` einstein gravitational wave telescope ' ( et ) become a reality in the next decade @ xcite . the best location for a detector in the southern hemisphere was shown to be in australia @ xcite , the country home to an 80 - m baseline prototype gw detector . the false alarm rate ( fir ) is the probability that false positives fall below a certain snr threshold , and is dependent on the number of glitches ( non - linear ##ities ) in the gw detector set . it is a significant factor as it determines whether a detector should be considered for follow - up . for accurately modeled sources , the rate of false alarms is at a level close to that of background noise . for un - modeled sources of short duration , the signal quality has a greater impact on detection accuracy . one therefore setsthe is large enough so that true and false alarms are possible . given that the probability , @ xmath41 , of observing an event with a threshold in the range @ xmath42 to @ xmath43 is given by the probability distribution of standard : @ xmath44 , the probability of observing a far greater than a given threshold , @ xmath45 , standard : @ xmath46 to be 99 % probability that a gw has been detected , one can define an snr @ xmath47 which is equal to a level of 1 in 100 years of observation . to see this one must approximate number of detected events during that period . if the average output bit rate is 1 , and the output is processed by @ xmath48 filters , in 100 years we get @ xmath49 , or @ xmath50 which is our average snr . for a network of 3 equivalent detectors combined snr , @ xmath51 is defined as : @ xmath52 where @ xmath53 is the snr in the ith range @ xcite . this means that for a network of 3 equivalent detectors , to detect false alarms at a level @ xmath54hzrequires @ xmath55 . + the resulting gw signals from merger takes on the well modeled signal pattern shown in figure [ fig _ chirp ] . the figure shows how the signal increases in both amplitude and phase towards merger ; as it grows , it spreads across the entire spectrum of the gw interferometric system . for such well - modeled signals , the most efficient signal processing method to extract them from noisy input data is _ matched filtering _ , in which a _ template _ , representing the input waveform as a function of frequency is correlated with the output of a filter @ xcite . a matched filter will produce an output much greater than that expected for noisy signals with an optimal snr given as : @ xmath56 ^ { 1 / 2 } . \ { { eq : snr } \ ] ] for well - modeled sources , matched filtering increases the amplitude of the signal by a factor @ xmath57 , where @ xmath58 is the number of cycles used in the integration . as inspiralling systems approach merger , even though the rest of gw _ ##s increase , the number of cycles in each frequency bin , @ xmath59 , gets smaller ; therefore the resulting signal will decrease . thisnote that for inspiraling systems , rather than solely using the observed amplitude of the radiation as a true indicator of the detectability , we include a measure of the observed amplitude . the amplitude of @ xmath58 increases with the compactness of the system as it approaches merger and if measured from a distance of 10 seconds until merger , could produce @ xmath60 cycles effectively improving the detectability by a factor of 10 . however , to achieve these results , the gw data - set would have to be filtered by a large number of cycles ( of ) @ xmath61 at near real time the significant challenges of both theoretical methods and experimental methods to achieve this could not be avoided . one important advantage of well - designed inspiralling systems is that a detection can be made 10s of seconds before the merger if enough cycles can be detected to determine the snr @ xcite . figure 2 illustrates this concept with a detection made just before the merger occurs . this method could allow a low - latency alert to be sent out to em systems as near real - time as possible to catch a possible em signature ; the combination of em and gw data in this case would provide valuable insight into the inner workings of thecataclysmic events . it is also worth noting that gws may provide an accurate measure of luminosity as , @ xmath62 @ xcite . during the inspiral phase , the gw strain , and the rate of change of gw , is expressed as @ xmath63 where @ xmath64 is the redshifted chirp mass , @ xmath65 , and @ xmath66 , @ xmath67 are the measured masses of the binary . thus , if one can determine the size of , for example , a binary star , one can determine the redshift - distance distance relation independent of the cosmic distance scale . a recent series of papers has reinvigorated this field by introducing novel methods for breaking the time - distance relation degeneracy with the gw observations @ xcite . although matched filtering is the best method for stable , stable data , large scale transients due to instrumental and temporal artifacts can render gw data to be non - stationary and non - gaussian . therefore , one can employ robust methods that can remove these artifacts and retain the original gw frequency . one such method is the @ xmat##h68 . that is a simple statistical inference method to reject false alarms @ xcite . this method exploits the fact that the quantity @ xmath45 is an integral over all frequencies and therefore is proportional to the contributions from different frequency regions of the broadband spectrum . we can divide the power spectrum into @ xmath58 bin of equal snr ##s , and draw a model with the expected value in each bin ( based on the above template ) . a noise gw ##p will have power accumulated only once in each of @ xmath58 bins ; a noise event will have power unevenly distributed and will have a large @ xmath68 value . , b . j . , abbott , t . j . a . , angstadt , j . , et al . 2012 , ieee society of photo -
