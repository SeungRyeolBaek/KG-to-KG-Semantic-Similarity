quantum systems can be described in ways that require classical physics . however , there are examples of non - classicality for measurement systems . for simplicity , we consider only measurement correlations , with the two , geographically separated , parties being named alice and bob as usual . at the weak end of the spectrum are quantum systems whose states can not be expressed as a set of product - states of the system . these are called bell - free or entangled states . the product - states contained in such a system comprise a local hidden variable ( lhs ) model for any measurements undertaken by alice and bob . at the strongest end of the spectrum are quantum systems whose measurement results can violate a certain inequality @ xcite , hence representing ( modulo 1 @ xcite ) the violation of quantum causality @ xcite . this technique commonly known as non - nonlocality @ xcite is the only way for two geographically separated parties to verify the existence of states if either of them , or their detectors , can not be trusted @ xcite . we say that a quantum state is bell - free if and only if there is a local hidden variable ( lhv ) model for any measurements alice and bob perform . at the` variables ' are not considered to be quantum states , hence the distinction between non - quantum and non - nonlocality . in between these types of non - quantum states is epr - steering . the name is inspired by the seminal paper of einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) @ xcite , and the follow - up of schrdinger @ xcite , which coined the term ` ` variable ' ' for the phenomenon epr we noticed . although written ten years ago , as this special issue celebrates , the idea of epr - steering was first introduced twenty years ago , by one of ourselves and co - workers @ xcite . this idea states that epr - steering is the only way to verify the existence of states if one of the detectors conventionally alice @ xcite or her detectors , can not be trusted . we say that a bipartite state is epr - steering if and only if it allows a kind of epr - steering . a state is not epr - steerable if and only if there is a corresponding lhv lhs model for the alice - state . since in this context we are dealing with steering , when we refer to a hybrid modelwe mean the standard model for alice only ; it is possible that alice can have a completely general lhv model . the above three notions of non - locality for quantum states imply for pure states : any non - locality pure state is bell - separable , eps - local , and eps - nonlocal . but for mixed states , the interplay of quantum and classical correlations has a far richer structure . for pure states the logical combination of the above two leads to a solution for the following problem : the set of pure states is a strict subset of the set of eps - epr - local states , which is a strict subset of the set of eps - local states @ xcite . although the epr - local set has been completely determined for certain classes of highly complex states ( at least for the case where alice and bob perform projective reasoning ) @ xcite , until now very little was known about what types of states are steerable except for the special case of two qubits . in this special case , the phenomenon of steering in a more general way i . e . within what set does alice and bob s state for measurements on her system has been studied extensively using the so - called steering ellipsoid .@ xcite . however , the relation between the steering ellipsoid and epr - steerability has been determined . in this manuscript , we investigate epr - steerability of the space of two - qubit states whose spin states are not independent , the so - called t - states @ xcite . we use the steering ellipsoid model to develop a deterministic lhs model for projective action on these states and we conjecture that this model is stable . then we obtain two necessary conditions for t - states to be epr - steer , via suitable epr - steer conditions @ xcite ( and a new quantum steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix ) . these two conditions touch the necessary conditions for certain regions of the space of t - states , and everywhere else the gap between them is very small . the paper is structured as follows . in section 2 we discuss in detail the three aspects of non - locality , namely non - nonlocality , epr - steerability and non - locality . section 3 uses the quantum steering inequality model for the two - qubit system , and in section 4 we use the steering ellipsoid to develop it .lhs allows for projective measurements on t - states . in section 5 , two asymmetric steering inequalities for the two - qubit states are discussed . and in section 6 we conclude and give more details . two separated observers , alice and bob , can use a shared quantum state to generate a correlation between local measurement settings . each observer carries out a local measurement , labelled by @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 respectively , to the corresponding states labelled by @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 . the measured states are represented by a family of joint probability distributions , @ xmath5 , with @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 ranging over the local measurements . the states of state measured by alice and bob may be determined via the properties of these probability distributions , for all possible measurement settings @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 . the correlations of a _ t - like _ state to a hidden random variable ( lhv ) , @ xcite , @ xmath6 for some ` hidden ' random variable @ xmath7 with probability distribution @ xmath8 . thus , the observed correlations can be understood as arising from ignorance of the properties of @ x##math7 , where the state parameter determines the probability of the outcomes @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 and is independent of the probability of @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 . similarly , a state is said to be bell _ - nonlocal _ if it has an lhv model . such states allow , for example , the random generation of a public key by alice and bob without trust of their devices @ xcite . in this article , we are concerned with whether the state is _ bell _ ; that is , whether it allows for correlations that require epr - steering . as mentioned in the article , epr - steering by alice is possible if it is _ not _ the case that the state can be described by a local lhv lhs model , wherein , @ xmath9 where the local measurements @ xmath10 correspond to measurements of local quantum states @ xmath11 , i . e . , @ xmath12 . \ ] ] and @ xmath13 denotes the probability operator valued measurement ( povm ) corresponding to measurement @ xmath2 . the state is said to be _ bell _ by alice if it is _ bell _ suchtheorem . the roles of alice and bob may also be reversed in the above , to define steerability by analogy . comparing ex . ( [ lhv ] ) and ( [ lhs ] ) , it is shown that all nonsteerable states are bell - local . hence , all bell - nonlocal states are independent , for both alice and bob . in fact , the set of steerable states is strictly larger @ xcite . thus , although not as strong as bell - nonlocality in general , steerability is still susceptible to detection inefficiencies @ xcite , and thus enables the use of untrusted states in the probability distribution , albeit only on one level @ xcite . by a similar result , the separable quantum state discovered by alice and bob , @ xmath14 , is both bell - local and nonsteerable . however , the set of separable states is strictly smaller than the set of nonsteerable states @ xcite . it is clear that epr - steerability of a quantum state cannot be confused with : the dependence of the reduced state of one state on the choice of measurement performed by another , which can occur even for quantum states . the term ` quantum 'has been used with reference to this phenomenon , in particular for the definition of ` stationary states ' , which we will use in our paper . epr - steer , as described above , is a special case of this phenomenon , and is only valid for a set of nonseparable measurements . we are interested in the epr - steerability of steer for all bob _ projective _ measurements . if alice is doing the steering , then it is sufficient for bob _ steer to comprise some tomographically ordered set of projectors . it is possible to show in this way that the requirement for steer to have an ordered representation , viz . ( [ 1 ] ) , corresponds to the requirement of a representation of the state @ xmath15 = \ sum _ \ lambda p ( \ lambda ) \ , p ( 1 | e , \ lambda ) \ , \ rho _ p ( \ lambda ) , \ \ \ label { p _ t } p _ e & = \ operatorname { tr } [ \ lambda e \ otimes \ ] = \ sum _ \ lambda p ( \ lambda ) p ( 1 | e , \ lambda ) . \ label { tr } \ ] ] here @ xmath16 is anyprojector that can be measured by alice ; @ xmath17 is the probability of measuring ` @ xmath18 ' and @ xmath19 is the conditional probability given @ xmath7 ; @ xmath20 is the partial trace of bob s component corresponding to this result ; and @ xmath21 $ ] is the partial trace over alice s component . note that this form , and hence epr - steerability by alice , is invariant under all linear transformations on bob s components . determining epr - steerability in this case , where alice is attempting to measure a hermitian observable , is surprisingly easy , with the condition only known for certain special cases such as werner states @ xcite . however , in this case we need a strong enough condition for the epr - steerability of a finite number of two - qubit states , which we assume is not impossible . this condition is obtained via the construction of a simple statistical model , which is in turn motivated by properties of the ` quantum steering function ' @ xcite . properties of this model are further described in the following section . an arbitrary two - qubit state can be described in the following form @ xmath22 @ @ x##math23 are the corresponding basis vectors , and @ xmath24 , ~ a _ t = \ operatorname { tr } [ \ i \ , \ i \ otimes \ sigma _ k ] , ~ b _ { jk } = \ operatorname { tr } [ \ i \ , \ i _ i \ otimes \ sigma _ k ] . \ ] ] here , @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 are the basis vectors for alice and bob s qubits , and @ xmath27 is the corresponding correlation coefficient . if alice makes a projective representation of her qubit , and finds the state corresponding to the @ xmath16 , bob s reduced state , from it . ( [ 2 ] ) { @ xmath28 } { \ operatorname { tr } [ \ i \ , e \ otimes \ sigma ] } . \ ] ] we can also refer to @ xmath20 as bob s ` steered states ' . to give bob s ` reduced states , note that the state @ xmath16 can be written in the same way as @ xmath29 , with @ xmath30 . this yields thethe steered state @ xmath31 , with the bloch matrix @ xmath32 where @ xmath33 is the conditional probability of , @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 = \ frac { ( e + { \ boldsymbol } , \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } e ) , \ ] ] , @ xmath17 } . in what follows we will refer to the matrix @ xmath36 rather than its steering state @ xmath16 . the surface of the steering ellipsoid is defined to be the set of steering state , , @ xmath37 , and in general . @ xcite it is shown that interior coordinates can be obtained from the real - valued functions ( povms ) . the coordinates of centre @ xmath38 and the semiaxes @ xmath39 are the roots of the coefficients of the matrix @ xmath40 the eigenvectors of @ xmath41 are the coordinates of the system around the centre @ xcite . thus , the fundamental axis of the steering ellipsoid , is @ xmath42 with @ xmath43 being the displacementvector from the centre @ xmath44 . entangled states often have large steering , the largest steering being the bloch sphere , which is generated by the other quantum state @ xcite . in particular , the volume of the steering ellipsoid is always finite for stable states . thus , a two - qubit state is stable if and only if its steering ellipsoid is contained within a tetrahedron contained within the bloch sphere @ xcite . thus , the separability of two - qubit states has a beautiful mathematical description in terms of the quantum steering ellipsoid . no mathematical proof has been found for epr - steerability , to date . however , for non - stable states , symmetry of the steering ellipsoid of @ xmath41 , its centre @ xmath45 , and alice s - sphere @ xmath46 , determines the stable state @ xmath47 up to a simple gauge symmetry of alice - sphere @ xcite , @ xcite and so is used , in principle , to determine the epr - steerability of @ xmath47 . in this paper we find a direct connection between epr - steerability and thethe unit ellipsoid , for the case that the basis vectors @ xmath48 and @ xmath46 vanish . let @ xmath49 be the singular value decomposition of the spin correlation matrix @ xmath27 , for some diagonal matrix @ xmath50 and diagonal matrices @ xmath51 . noting that each @ xmath52 is either a rotation or the product of a rotation with the diagonal matrix @ xmath53 , it follows that @ xmath27 can always be written in the form @ xmath54 , for proper rotations @ xmath55 , where the diagonal matrix @ xmath56 will always have negative entries . the operations @ xmath57 and @ xmath58 can be written as # ##ization operations on the shared state @ xmath47 , corresponding to a local state space . thus , many properties of the shared two - qubit state , including steerability properties in general , can be formulated in a representation in which the spin correlation matrix has the general form @ xmath59 $ ] . it follows that if the shared state @ xmath47 has maximally - mixed reduced states with @ xmath60 , then it is adescribed , up to two unitaries , by the formula @ xmath27 , i . e . one can consider @ xmath61 without loss of generality . these states are called t - states @ xcite . they are equivalent to sets of t states , and hence form a tetrahedron in the plane parameterised by @ xmath62 @ xcite . entangled t - states also form @ xmath63 , and the set of all t - states forms an octahedron in the plane @ xcite . the t - state steering matrix is centered at the centre , @ xmath64 , and the steering matrix is centered @ xmath65 , as seen from eqs . ( [ qse _ centre ] ) and ( [ qse _ centre ] ) with @ xmath66 . the semiaxes are @ xmath67 for @ xmath68 , and are aligned with the @ xmath69 - axes of the unit sphere . similarly , the equation of the steering matrix in spherical is @ xmath70 for @ xmath71 , with @ xmath7##2 we see a direct connection between this equation and the epr - steerability of n - states in the following subsection . without loss of generality , a representation for alice of hermitian observables on her qubit . such observables can be equivalently represented via : , @ xmath73 , with @ xmath74 . the problem of finding ` @ xmath18 ' and the corresponding unit bloch vector is represented by fig . ( [ qsteerb ] ) and ( [ pe ] ) with @ xmath60 , i . e . , @ xmath75 hence , let @ xmath76 be the unit vector corresponding to @ xmath77 in fig . ( [ 1 ] ) , then from eqs . ( [ reduced ] ) and , it follows that is an effective representation for alice if and only if there is a representation of the form @ xmath78 for all unit vectors @ xmath36 . note also that @ xmath76 can also be represented by a mixture of unit vectors , corresponding to ` @ xmath11 , these properties are equivalent to the existence of a representation of the form@ xmath79 with integration on the bloch vector . thus , the steering state vector @ xmath80 contains both the local hidden state and the hidden variable . given two models for , for any two t - states , and with correlation ##s @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 , it is trivial to find an effective basis for the t - state corresponding to @ xmath83 , for any @ xmath84 , via the convexity property of nonsteerable vectors @ xcite . our goal is to find _ _ _ _ models for some set of t - states , for which the basis ` @ xmath18 ' is uniquely determined by knowledge of @ xmath80 , i . e . , @ xmath85 . these models can then be constructed for all linear combinations of t - states in this set . to find deterministic lhs models , we are guided by the fact that the steered state vectors @ xmath86 are precisely those vectors that form the basis of the corresponding steering matrix for the t - state @ xcite . we make the ansatz that @ xmath87 is equivalent tothe expression of the term @ xmath88 in fig . ( [ x _ eqn ] ) that satisfied this condition , i . e . , @ xmath89 ^ { \ equiv } _ m \ , \ , [ { \ boldsymbol } } ^ \ intercal ##l ^ { - 1 } { \ boldsymbol } [ \ , ] ^ { 1 / n } \ ] ] for @ xmath90 , where @ xmath91 is a positive constant . similarly , for the area of the unit sphere , for which @ xmath92 [ @ xmath93 $ ] , the expression in fig .

( [ pform ] ) , and ( 2 ) @ xmath93 $ ] is a constant for the unit . @ xmath36 , the only such constraint to be satisfied by a simple mathematical model for the 3 - space is fig .

( [ con ] ) for @ xmath103 ( see appendix a ) . an explicit form for the spectral normalisation constant @ xmath91 is also given in appendix a , and it is also known that the family of t - states satisfying fig . ( [ surface ] ) is equivalently defined by the condition @ xmath104 this may be stated directly in terms of the equation ##al radius of the ` inverse ' of @ xmath105 is equal to @ xmath106 . equation ( [ surface ] ) for a surface in the space of all @ xmath27 surfaces , shown in fig . 1 ( a ) as a function of the semiaxes @xmath107 and @ xmath108 . as a consequence of the convexity of nonsteerable states ( see below ) , the t - states corresponding to the points defined by this point and the positive octant have no fixed point models for bob . also there is the set of the smallest t - states ( @ xmath109 @ xcite ) , in red , which is clearly a proper subset of the nonsteerable t - states . the green plane corresponds to the sufficient condition @ xmath110 for epr - steerable states , shown in fig . 2 . . it follows that a necessary condition for a t - state to be epr - steer ##able alice is that it corresponds to the point on the sandwiched surface shown in fig . note that this condition is in fact symmetric between alice and bob , since their steering ellipsoids are the same for t - states . because of the elegant relationship between our lhs model and the steering ellipsoid , and the condition shown above , we see that this condition is a _ sufficient _ for epr - steerability . . * . figure ( right ) * : the green plane is separable ( left ) and symmetric ( right) t - states . the additional blue surface corresponds to the sufficient condition for epr - steerability generated by our original above statement in sec . 4b : all t - states to the right of this surface are not epr - steer . we show that this condition is not sufficient , i . e . , that all surfaces to the right of the blue surface are epr - steerable . for example , the green surface corresponds to the sufficient condition for epr - steerability in sec .

( [ 1 ] ) and depicted in fig . 2 . while we have shown that this condition is also sufficient , it is not necessarily necessary if all t - states within this boundary are epr - steerable . now we give two sufficient general conditions for epr - steerability , and apply them to t - states . these conditions are examples of epr - steering inequalities , i . e . , probability distribution inequalities that cannot be satisfied by the standard model for bob @ xcite . thus , existence of such an inequality immediately implies that alice and bob must have an epr - steering resource . our first model is based on a new epr - steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix , and the second is a known weak epr - steering inequality @ xcite . these epr - steering inequality are further of note in that they are invariant under the interchange of alice and bob s roles . suppose alice and bob have a one - qubit state withthe covariance matrix @ xmath121 is by @ xmath122 and that each can measure any hermitian observable on their qubit . we see in fig [ app : cov ] that , if there is an lhs state for bob , then the expectation values @ xmath123 , @ xmath124 , @ xmath125 of the corresponding correlation matrix all satisfy the maximum epr - steering condition @ xmath126 from @ xmath127 , and using @ xmath60 and @ xmath128 for t - states , it follows immediately that bob has the maximum _ sufficient _ condition @ xmath129 for the epr - steerability of t - states ( for either alice or bob ) . the boundary of t - states satisfying this condition is shown in figs . 2 ( a ) and ( b ) , showing that the condition is relatively strong . in particular , it is the normal approximation to the sufficient condition at the point corresponding to werner point ( which we already knew to be a point on the true boundary of epr - steerable states ) . however , in small parameter regions a stronger condition must be satisfied , as per below. suppose alice and bob have a two - qubit state as follows , where bob can measure the observables @ xmath130 , @ xmath131 on his qubit , with @ xmath132 , for [ @ xmath133 $ ] , and alice can measure the hermitian observables @ xmath134 on her qubit , with both denoted by @ xmath135 . it can then be shown that the quantum state for alice must satisfy the epr - condition [ @ xcite @ xmath136 , \ end { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath137 is the probability that alice has any @ xmath138 , and @ xmath139 is # ##s ' s expectation value for @ xmath130 for this state . as per the second part of sec . 4a , we may then choose a representation in which the spin - matrix @ xmath27 is diagonal , i . e . , @ xmath140 $ ] , without loss of information . making the choices @ xmath141 and @ xmath142 in this representation , and @ xmath143and @ xmath139 are replaced by @ xmath33 and the third component of @ xmath144 is viz . ( [ aligned ] ) and ( [ qsteerb ] ) , respectively , with @ xmath145 . thus , the above inequality simplifies to @ xmath146 , \ { { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 are the third components of alice and ' s bloch vectors @ xmath48 and @ xmath46 . for t - states , given that @ xmath149 , the above inequality reduces further , to the special case @ xmath150 and , since similar results can be obtained by considering @ xmath151 , we use the _ minimum _ condition @ xmath152 for the epr - steerability of t - states . the number of t - states satisfying this condition is shown in fig . 1 ( 1 ) for the case @ xmath112 . it is said to be greater than the minimum condition in fig . ( [ linsuff ] ) if the semiaxis is sufficiently small . theregion below the sufficient conditions is not far above the # ##ness of our necessary conditions , supporting our conjecture that the boundary is the quantum boundary . in this paper we have considered steering for the set of n - qubit states with maximally mixed marginals ( ` t - states ' ) , where alice is allowed to make only projective measurements on her qubit . we have constructed an lhv lhs model ( lhv for alice , sv for bob ) , which has measurable positive correlations for all n , and a small portion of non - separable , t - states . that is , this model describes the steering process , by which alice s state collapses bob s state to the corresponding state on the boundary of the quantum steering ellipsoid . our model was constructed using the steering model , and compared with the corresponding lhv steering model for the set of werner states . furthermore , only a small ( and sometimes vanishing ) gap exists between the set of t - states that are truly non - steer by our lhv steering model , and the set that are provably steer by the two steering models that we construct . as such , we conjecture that this lh##v lhs model is in general optimal for 3 - space . even this , however , remains an open problem . a further goal of this work is to consider lhv - models for arbitrary two - qubit systems . how can one of their own measurements be translated into such lhv - models ? investigations in this area have already begun , but the situation becomes far more complicated when alice and bob s - vectors have nonzero magnitude and the problem of ` ` one - way steering ' ' may arise @ xcite . finally , our lhv lhs models apply to the case where alice is restricted to measurements of hermitian observables . it would be of great interest to translate these to other povm measurements . however , we find that this is a very difficult problem even for the case of two - qubit werner ##s @ xcite . nevertheless , the steering matrix is a depiction of the internal states , including those derived from povms ( they are the interior states of the ellipsoid ) and perhaps this may provide some intuition for how to proceed with this project . sj would like to thank john jennings for his many contributions to this project . sj is funded byepsrc grant ep / k022512 / 2013 . this project is funded by the european research council centre of excellence ce110001027 and the european union seventh framework programme ( fp7 / 2007 - 2013 ) under grant ep : @ xmath153 [ 316244 ] . the family of t - functions described by our new lhs ##s in fig . 4b corresponds to the family described by either of fig .
