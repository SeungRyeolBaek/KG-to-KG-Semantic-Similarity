precision experiments in the last two decades have elevated the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics from a promising theory to a general law of nature , emerging as a quantum field theory at the accuracy of 90 % or more . despite its name the sm is not an entirely new theory , however , because it has many theoretical problems . in particular , the particle hierarchy problem , _ i . e . _ , the determination of the electroweak scale @ xmath7 without radiative confinement , has spurred the imagination of many theorists and led to the development of a number of theories of physics like the sm that explain new phenomena at energies even well above the tev scale . a particularly promising proposal for stabilizing the electroweak scale , featuring one compact extra dimension with a non - factorizable anti - de ##duction ( ads @ xmath8 ) background , is the randall - sundrum ( sm ) model @ xcite , which by virtue of the ads / cft correspondence @ xcite can be thought of as dual to the strongly interacting four - dimensional ( 4d ) cft . with the d - branes acting as the boundaries of the warped extra dimension , the ads @ xmath8 background generates an antiunification of gauge theories , so that the natural energy at one orbifold fixed point ( the ultra - violet ( ir ) brane ) is much smaller than at the other ( the ultra - red ( ir ) brane ) , @ xmath9 . in the rs framework the gauge hierarchy problem is thus solved by gravitational red - shifting . there are many possibilities for building models of electroweak symmetry breaking in ads @ xmath8 . the main building blocks for the construction of a gauge theory include , among others , the existence of the bulk gauge group , the one - dimensional gauge group , and the possible mechanism for localizing the higgs field on ( or near ) the ir brane . while in the original rs proposal all elementary particles were assumed to lie on the grain boundary and the gauge group was restricted to ads @ xmath10 , it was soon realized that allowing gauge @ xcite and matter fields @ xcite to spread in the ads @ xmath8 framework not only avoids dangerous second - order interactions suppressed only by those of @ xmath11 , but also provides a complete understanding of the internal structure of the matter @ xcite via geometrical sequestering @ xcite . this way of constructing the##rmion ##ism also implies a large amount of detection of dangerous flavor - changing gauge currents ( fcncs ) @ xcite , a mechanism referred to as the rs - gim mechanism @ xcite . the corrections to the @ xmath1 parameter can be cured in an appropriate way by extending the local hypercharge group to @ xmath12 and extending it to @ xmath13 on the uv brane @ xcite . an appropriate embedding of the s - type sm quarks into the standard rs model also furnishes the means to reduce the high - level corrections to the @ xmath14 parameter @ xcite and its flavor - changing counterpart @ xcite . as a result , all the electroweak precision and cp - conserving fcnc ##s are fully satisfied for the detection of the lightest kaluza - type ( kk ) gauge currents below a few tev . however , in terms of the rs - gim mechanism , cp - violating interactions in the massive cp system @ xcite and contributions to the local electric dipole moment @ xcite tend to be very large for models with flavor anarchy , lowering the particle - physics scale to at least 10 tev andthus extending the reach of the cern large scale collider ( lhc ) . relaxing the latter condition allows to allow an exact symmetry alignment between the models and has triggered a lot of model - building activity . the purpose of this approach is to perform a thorough analysis of the structure of the rs model with the symmetry group @ xmath15 at the vertices , where @ xmath3 interchanges the two @ xmath16 vertices and is responsible for the protection of the @ xmath14 vertex . while in the existing literature on the @ rs model the couplings of the bulk particles to the higgs sector are treated as a problem , we instead construct the exact solutions to the einstein equations of motion ( eoms ) subject to the boundary conditions ( bcs ) . in that way we obtain exact solutions for the interactions and interactions of the @ sm ##es and their kk excitations . this approach is not only technically superior but also has several advantages over the perturbative approach . in particular , it facilitates the exact solution of all interactions of the @ xmath17 , including those resulting from the breaking of the @ xmath3 symmetry by the bcs and of the bulk particles . the general interpretation ofthe obtained results in terms of ( ir ) reducible models of symmetry breaking are clearly visible in our approach , while it is largely hidden if the couplings of the bulk fields to the higgs sector are considered as a whole from the very beginning . the new approach also permits to include the mixing of particles of different generations in a completely new model , making the dependence on the local physics of the matter sector clear . in addition , it is possible to address questions about the model - dependence of the local gauge - and higgs - boson interactions with the theory ##b . in summary , our work places the theory of the two - dimensions on a more sound basis , both at the field theoretical and phenomenological level . in our forthcoming paper we will apply the derived results to tree - level flavor - violating @ xmath18 and @ xmath19 theories of the matter sector . this article is structured as follows . after some important calculations and notations , we present in the [ sec : gauge ] the kk model of the bulk gauge field in the case of the brane - free higgs sector , working in the new @ xmath20 gauge . we will show how to compute properties ofkk towers of gauge bosons in complex form . the main discussion for bulk calculations is presented in section [ sec : fermions ] . special attention is given to the practical implementation of yukawa models containing @ xmath21 - type fermion profiles . in sections [ sec : custodialprotection ] and [ sec : higgscouplings ] we present the main results of our work . we first examine the effects of gauge - boson interactions with the strings and then examine the couplings of the higgs field to them . in the first case , we give the formulas that expose , on one hand , the mechanisms for obtaining the special properties of the left - handed @ xmath2 - type couplings and , on the other , which are the terms that can escape protection . in addition , we note also that no protection mechanism is present in the anti - current model . in the second case , the local dependence on the direction of the local sector of the higgs - string interaction is worked out . in our analysis we concentrate on the leading contributions to the observables of interest , including the effects of brane - like protection . @xcite . although the uv dynamics are not specified , it is natural to assume that these corrections are loop suppressed , so that they can be corrected to first order . the most important phenomenological implications of our work are described in section [ 2 : pheno ] . we begin by discussing the constraints imposed by the experimental models of the spin - quark - observables , including the tree - based corrections that require protection . we then consider the phenomenology of rare sm ##ologies in the extended rs model and compare it to the one of the standard model . finally , we discuss the possible changes of the higgs production cross section and branching fractions in the lhc , including all first - order quantum corrections obtained from the standard electroweak b - model and its extensions . in a series of papers we collect information on the properties of the standard bcs and higgs - like fcncs in the context of the @ xmath21 - even and - odd gauge theory , our input values for the sm ##c , and the explicit expressions for the correction factors needed to calculate the production cross section and the branching fraction of the higgs boson in the rs model . we start with the non - standard##izable rs ##t @ xmath22 where @ xmath23 denote the coordinates of the 4d hyper - sphere of dimension @ xmath24 with dimension @ xmath25 . the fifth dimension is the @ xmath26 orbifold of dimension @ xmath27 [ = @ xmath28 $ ] . the sixth dimension has orbifold reference points at @ xmath29 ( the uv brane ) and @ xmath30 ( the ir brane ) . since the product of the scale factor and the dimension , @ xmath31 , corresponds to the fundamental length scale of the 4d surface , the dimensional ##ity above can be tamed by an appropriate choice of the dimension @ xmath32 . in order to describe the difference between the electroweak scale , @ xmath33 , and the fundamental energy scale , @ xmath34 , one needs to write @ xmath35 . we will simply refer to @ xmath36 as the ` ` volume ' ' of the extra dimension . the dimension @ xmath37 also allows the energy scale for the low - lying kk scale of the theory ##e to be of order of the ` ` kk scale ' '@ xmath38 for example , the energies of the first kk photon and photon are approximately @ xmath39 . it will often be necessary to introduce the coordinate @ xmath40 , which equals @ xmath41 on the uv brane and 1 on the ir brane @ xcite . coordinates over the orbifold are then obtained using the following replacements @ xmath42 we now have enough definitions and calculations in place to complete our work . in this section we study the kk dimensions in the gauge theory and obtain exact results for the bulk fields , including the effects of an ir brane - localized higgs sector . in all the work on the rs ##t with experimental protection , the couplings of the higgs field to bulk fields were studied as a whole , describing the field in terms of @ xmath43 . this led to the necessity of using infinite - dimensional coordinates which need to be scaled , yielding only one ( or a few ) kk dimensions . while such an approach should in theory lead to approximate results @ xcite , it is worthwhile to study the set - up of the field of mass eigenstates , thus obtaining exact results @ xcite .thus , we will assume that the summation over the entire kk domain receives large contributions , which are lost by breaking @ xcite . as the result can be expressed in this form , it is convenient to work with the original sum and to expand the above expressions in terms of @ xmath43 . proceeding in this way one can clearly distinguish between bonding and subleading modes . alternatively we could use five - dimensional ( 5d ) propagators @ xcite , which would be equivalent to our method . an exhaustive treatment of the perturbative results featuring us after the first step can be found in @ xcite . we use the rs model with symmetry protection as proposed in @ xcite , with the weak gauge group @ xmath44 . on the uv brane , the symmetry - breaking of @ xmath45 provides the weak symmetry , which preserves the @ xmath1 symmetry . the weak @ xmath3 symmetry prevents the left - handed @ xmath46 model from losing the large contributions @ xcite . on the uv brane , the symmetry breaking @ xmath47 provides the sm gauge group . the symmetry breaking associated to @ xmath48 is related tothe existence of sec and ir bcs and will become clear later on . the 5d action of the gauge field takes the form @ xmath49 with the gauge - fixing terms @ xmath50 where @ xmath51 is the 5d action . as this is not necessary for our analysis , we use the faddeev - popov lagrangian . the higgs lagrangian @ xmath52 is based on the ir brane . a detailed description of how to deal with @ xmath53 has already been given in @ xcite and we refer the exact treatment to the [ sec : fermkk ] . the gauge - fixing lagrangian , @ xmath54 , will be given in the next section . we choose the four - dimensional components of the gauge fields to be even under the @ xmath21 transformation , while the remaining fifth ##s are odd , in order to arrive at a low - energy state that is consistent with it . the higgs anti - doublet , used for moving @ xmath55 to the diagonal of @ xmath56 on the ir brane , appears as @ xmath57 and explicitly as @ xmath58 where@ xmath59 are the vector fields , @ xmath60 , and @ xmath61 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field . @ xmath62 transformations act from the left of the z - axis , and the @ xmath63 transformations act from the right . the covariant transformation of the higgs sector replaces @ xmath64 with @ xmath65 . an inverse transformation leads to @ xmath66 \ \ [ - [ z ] & \ dots { aligned } + \ left { \ non - linear vector fields } \ , , \ nonumber \ dots { aligned } \ ] ] where we have : @ xmath67 the definition of ( [ z : cohigg ] ) motivates us to define the vector fields @ xcite @ xmath68 which correspond to a new mass matrix . we then defined the 4d - couplings @ xmath69 . the fields are analogous to the diagonal rotation of the @ xmath2 , and the fields of the sm , which are themselves analogous to ( [ z : za ] ) . thus , the mass matrix takes the form@ xmath70 and to the ground state @ xmath71 and by the higgs vev @ xmath72 . appropriate bcs from the neutral electroweak gauge group correspond to the neutral gauge group on the uv and @ xmath73 . , this is done by introducing the photon field @ xmath74 and the dirichlet bcs to @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 on the uv brane . the @ xmath13 hypercharge coupling is identical to the @ xmath77 coupling . @ xmath78 the photon - and neutral electroweak gauge groups are related in the standard way . @ xmath79 it follows that the values of the sine and cosine of the weak - interaction angle , @ xmath80 agree with the values in the standard . therefore , the fields @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 can be rotated to the photon field @ xmath83 and a vector @ xmath84 via @ xmath85 where @ xmath86 and we have @ xmath87 , where it is a linear combination of @ xmat##h88 and @ xmath89 , which are equivalent to @ xmath84 . we will see below . @ xmath90 in table [ tab : bcs ] we summarize the bcs that we calculated for the fields in order to obtain the corresponding mass values for the two gauge theories . they are given in terms of fields with individual bcs at the two different branes . in the following we will refer to these sets of fields as the uv and ir basis , respectively . the result is summarized in table [ tab : bases ] , where we will describe the symmetry - breaking patterns of the two branes . the bcs can easily be converted to this form at the cost of obtaining expressions that use different fields . the particle @ xmath91 has individual and spin - von neumann bcs at both branes , and thus its decay process is massless . note that there is just one additional parameter @ xmath92 entering the sm bcs , in contrast to the two parameters @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 appearing in the minimal model . in the minimal model , the different interactions for the two electroweak gauge bosons are accomplished by the same uvbcs of the gauge fields in the ir basis ( ref ( [ fig : 1 ] ) . ) . the fact that there is just one invariant basis vector is important for the custodial value of the @ xmath1 parameter . we will elaborate on this in ref [ fig : mwmzstu ] .

invariant lagrangian . as the higgs field is embedded in the r brane , it is natural to work in the ir basis for that field . for this reason , we define the 5d basis in the ir basis . the general form of the gauge theory will be given below : ( [ fig : sgf ] ) . after discussing the kk decomposition , we consider the coupling of the uv (right ) and ir ##l ( left ) . they are @ xmath95 \ left ( \ begin { array } { c } \ \ l _ m ^ \ pm \ \ r _ m ^ \ pm \ begin { array } \ right ) & = \ right ( \ begin { array } { c } \ sin \ theta _ w & -

dimensional matrices @ xmath110 , with @ xmath111 , representing the mixings of the two vectors ##s and their kk components . these vectors are arranged according to @ xmath112 so that the matrix @ xmath113 should in principle always carry a prefix @ xmath114 , indicating the group to which it belongs , but we will not show it , so the correct order should be always known from the data . the superscripts @ xmath115 and @ xmath116 indicate the form of bc we use on the profiles of the uv brane , _ i . e . _ , they are untwisted and twisted even functions - parity , which are dirichlet transforms on the uv brane and are thus not smooth at this orbifold fix ##ation . these functions are sometimes called odd , as they look like an odd function if one only considers all of the orbifold. untwisted even vectors correspond to ordinary profiles with [ . bcs . ] on the orbifold . note from the [ tab : bcs ] that these profiles have a unique basis at the frame boundary , which we need not denote explicitly by the symbol @ xmath115 to avoid the confusion of notation . let us also introduce the shorthand notations @ xmath117 for the basis of the uv profile . in contrast to the vector basis of @ xcite , the vectors @ xmath118 do not obey exact orthonormality conditions . this fact is equivalent to the decomposition of profiles with vector and dirichlet bcs into the corresponding 4d gauge - boson basis . the complete vectors @ xmath119 with @ xmath120 are not orthonormal to each other , @ xmath121 note also that the basis obeys the neumann orthonormality condition . we can denote the 4d goldstone bosons in the basis of mass eigenstates @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 by : @ xcite @ xmath124 using the notation introduced in this article , the gauge -

derivative by an infinite amount into the profile @ xcite . we can indicate this relaxation point by a superscript in the argument of the function , _ e . g . _ , by writing @ xmath135 . the appropriate ir bcs for the profile can be obtained by integrating the eoms ( [ tab : gaugeeom ] ) in an arbitrary region of @ xmath136 . at the 5d level they have already been obtained from the [ tab : bcs ] . however , since the derivatives of the vector components are required to be equal to the @ xmath24 -

changing properties . in this section we will show how to calculate the following sum of k - boson masses @ xmath176 weighted by inverse powers of the normalized kk - masses @ xmath177 , @ xmath178 which occurs when one tries to observe the wave - like exchange of the sm electroweak gauge boson accompanied by its kk excitations in the limit of infinite ( or negligibly large ) energy levels . the following sum ##mation ( [ eq : kksum1 ] ) can be calculated by using the methods used in @ xcite . we can calculate the eoms ( [ sec : gaugeeom ] ) directly , again for the bcs on both the sm and ir brane . after converting to @ xmath171 , this yields @ xmath179 \! { \ , p } _ { ( + ) } \ , \ frac { \ vec { \ epsilon } _ n ^ { \ , x } ( \ big ) } { \ , ( x _ n ^ { \ , ) ^ 2 } \ , , \ ] ] where we have obtained @ xmath180 by the equivalence relation @ xmath181 for the n - dimensional case , it is now possible to show that @ xmath182 where @ xmath183 . with these results at hand it is only a matter of some mathematical analysis to arrive at @ xmath184 \ \ [ x ] ] & \ phantom { 1 } + \ left [ \ , \ delta { 1 } -

64 terms in @ xmath196 . the terms due to the non - factorizable term @ xmath197 come from the second - order term @ xmath198 . factorizable terms due to the two - state @ xmath153 and @ xmath2 respectively are then given by the derivative of the warp factor with respect to the product from the sum of kk and @ xcite . we also see that the term @ xmath197 has the same 5dand of the standard model , which is lost when one considers only a few low - lying kk modes @ xcite . our experimental results for @ xmath199 and @ xmath200 will turn out to be phenomenologically quite important , as they allow for a clear understanding of the role of certain terms in @ xmath18 and @ xmath19 fcnc respectively . in particular , the exact form of the term @ xmath201 and its interplay with the term corresponding to the @ xmath202 unit matrix @ xmath203 are important conditions for the observed properties of the flavor - violating @ xmath14 vertices as well as of the flavor - violating @ xmath204 vertices . we will for the moment not only focus on this issue , but will return to it in detail in ref [ 1 : custodialprotection ] . before moving on , let us note that the kk modes involving photon and gluon excitations do not depend on whether the electroweak gauge symmetry is broken or not , so that the formulas for the partial sums ( excluding the transition modes ) can be carried over from @ xcite . we will also presentthe explicit representation of the quark field is the field under consideration . then we can return to the kk representation and compute the bulk profiles for the corresponding fields . if we want to construct a unified representation of the @ xmath205 and @ xcite , we impose a new @ xmath3 symmetry that relates the two @ xmath16 fields . as a result , the left - to right representation has to be part of the @ xmath206 t - doublet with isospin quantum number @ xmath207 ( see figure [ 2 : custodialprotection ] ) . this relates the quantum numbers of the corresponding fields , and implies the following multiplet structure for the corresponding fields with the @ xmath21 symmetry : @ xmath208 { \ cal t } _ 1 & \ equiv { \ cal t } _ { 1r } \ oplus { \ cal t } _ { 2r } \ equiv \ left ( \ text { 1 } { 1 } { \ lambda _ r ^ { \ prime \ , ( -

quality description of the field that is consistent with reality . the fields corresponding to the @ xmath48 and @ x##math209 charges , respectively , which are connected through the relations @ xmath210 and @ xmath211 . for current and future reference , we present the quantum states of the three charges in the [ tab : 1 ] . the right - handed up - type quarks need to be placed in an @ xmath63 frame in order to arrive at an @ xmath209 - like yukawa frame . note that we have chosen the same @ xmath55 frame for all three charges , which is necessary if one wants to fully incorporate quark ##s in the new theoretical approach to flavor - warped three dimensions . the two representations also play a key role in the suppression of flavor - changing right - handed @ xmath2 - like particles @ xcite . altogether they feature 15 different charge ##s in the up - type and 10 in the down - type sector . according to the bcs , there will be two k states in each sector to be associated with the sm quarks . these are accompanied by kk states which consist of groups of five and nine modes of similar energy in the up - and down - type - sector , respectively . moreover one canconsider a kk state of exotic magnetic particles of electric charge @ xmath212 , which has three excitations with a small difference between each one . in addition to ( [ eq : multiplets ] ) we have a second group of multiplets , corresponding to the states of different chirality . the three states obey opposite bcs . in fact , they all obey dirichlet bcs on the same brane . note that the @ xmath62 transformations act vertically , while the @ xmath63 transformations act horizontally on the multiplets . [ id = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , id = " header " , ] compared to electron - particle fusion , higgs - particle production and even gauge - particle production , @ xmath213 with @ xmath214 , which is known to be very important for discovery of the lhc , has only small corrections of : @ xmath215 ( @ xmath216 ) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath218 ) . the latter correction will affect associated @ xmath153 - particle production , @ xmath21##9 , which is the only one that in principle would account for the higgs discovery at the tevatron . the rs predictions for the scattering cross section for @ xmath220 at the tevatron and for @ xmath221 at the lhc are illustrated by the solid dashed lines in the left and right sides of the [ fig : prodplots ] , respectively . the corresponding sm results are taken from @ xcite and represented by the solid dashed lines . however , the cross section of the spin - down pair produced , @ xmath222 , can also experience a suppression . for measurements of the kk , in the case of @ xmath223 , this suppression can amount only to @ xmath224 . since @ xmath225 , @ xmath226 , and @ xmath227 are tree - like models , their rs predictions have only been obtained by a simple analysis of the corresponding sm results . in particular , we note that the main higgs - pair production results at the sm are suppressed in the beta decay ##s corresponding to the sm . suppression results for @ xmath228 were also reported in @ xcite. a direct direct comparison with our results is however not possible , since @ xcite only made single - mode corrections , and @ xcite studied rs variants that differed from the specific set - up considered here . in @ xcite the authors found corrections to proton - gluon interactions resulting from the confinement of light fermionic kk particles . there it has been shown that for a single set - up , with a symmetry @ xmath229 of a few hundred gev the higgs - boson interaction cross section via @ xmath228 can be significantly reduced . we would like to point out in this context that in order to achieve @ xmath230 with the embedding of rs as chosen in ( [ see : multiplets ] ) , the @ xmath3 symmetry has to be broken down via the different mass parameters of the @ xmath231 multiplets by choosing @ xmath232 as chosen away from @ xmath233 . while for @ xmath234 it is possible to use @ xmath235 and achieve an approximation of the @ xmath236 cross section , such combinations of parameters have to be fine - tuned to reproducethe measured energy distribution of the light quarks for the yukawa coupling . if , on the other hand , @ xmath237 , we find that @ xmath238 remains strictly negative , and as a result the @ xmath228 coupling experiences a reduction . we also add that breaking of @ xmath232 corresponding to a strong breaking of the @ xmath3 symmetry lead , without any accidental effects , to a strictly negative reduction of the @ xmath14 coupling ##s ( [ deltad2 ] ) , which is problematic in view of the stringent constraints arising from the @ xmath239 coupling observables . to which extent electroweak precision will leave the behavior of light fermionic kk ##b for further study . we now move on to study the decay ##s of the higgs boson . in this section , we will consider all processes with quarks and gauge interactions in the final model that can have important energy changes and have a mass fraction larger than @ xmath240 . since we have not explicitly discussed the embedding of the particles in the lepton sector , we assume decay into taus and ##ons .due to the mutual scattering of the leptonic particles , we can see that the decay widths of the higgs into charged leptons are all slit - like . however , we did not consider the contributions of kk leptons in our analysis of the @ xmath241 and @ xmath242 decay rates . we will focus on the full impact of this omission later . in order to be able to calculate the decay rates of the higgs back into the charged state , we will need to apply the above corrections to the @ xmath243 , @ xmath244 , and @ xmath245 tree - like vertices . due to the invariant @ xmath48 gauge symmetry , the @ xmath246 vertex remains invariant with respect to the gauge to all particles in @ xmath43 . the gauge interactions of the higgs boson are different from the gauge and quartic interactions according to ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) . for unitary gauge , the coupling terms in the lagrangian read @ xmath247 , \ ] ] where @ xmath248 + { { \ cal o } } \ left ( x _ 0^ ( \ right ) , \ begin { aligned } \ end { neutral } \ ] ] and @ xmath249 for @ xmath214 . in the case of the @ xmath3 term ( [ plr ] ) , one has @ xmath250 and @ xmath251 , which means that the coupling ##s due to @ xmath252 has the form @ xmath253 . for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath254 ) these terms lead to a suppression of the @ xmath243 and @ xmath244 terms by increasing @ xmath255 ( @ xmath256 ) relative to the original . note that in the standard gauge theory the expressions ( [ see : hbosoncoupl ] ) are in the form @ xmath257 , and that the corrections to the coupling of the higgs to the gauge field are reduced by about a factor of 2 . our assumption that the terms @ xmath243 and @ xmath244 show a departure from their initial position in the model - checking calculations made by @ xcite . the slow ##ness of @ xmath##258 of the higgs decay back to the ground state @ xmath259 is also obtained by rescaling the observed band widths . we replace @ xmath260 with @ xmath261 in the case of the decay of the higgs decay into a pair of @ xmath153 and @ xmath2 bosons , respectively . the relevant @ xmath262 parameters for decay into heavy nuclei , particles or bottom particles have also been defined as ( [ eq : kappagg ] ) and ( [ tbratios ] ) . in figure [ 1 : hprodec ] the diagrams inducing the decay into a pair of bottom quarks and the vector bosons are shown on the right in the upper right . apart from the changes in the @ xmath263 coupling , we consider the corrections to the three - body mode @ xmath264 , which relative to the two - body mode @ xmath265 lead to a loss of ( just about ) 50 % of the energy . given the magnitude of this effect , the number of possible new - physics changes in the @ xmath266 coupling that would affect the@ xmath267 channel is for all practical purposes irrelevant . in the case of the weak interaction with the photons , we employ @ xmath268 in ( [ fig : gammahtof ] ) , where @ xmath269 , @ xmath270 , @ xmath271 , @ xmath272 , @ xmath273 , and the corresponding expression for the scale factor @ xmath274 , encoding the @ xmath153 - boson contribution , can be found in figure [ app : formfactors ] . the first , second , and third terms in the numerator describe the amplitude of the k - photon , @ xmath153 - photon , and kk - photon contributions , respectively . the two closed - form models are shown on the right in the bottom plot of figure [ fig : hprodec ] and in the top plot of figure [ fig : hkkcontr ] . the amplitude @ xmath275 varies slightly with the weak contribution @ xmath276 , varying from @ xmath277 for @ xmath278 to @ xmath279 for the @ x##math280 approaching @ xmath281 and then approaching @ xmath282 in the limit @ xmath283 . comparing these values with the values for @ xmath276 given above , one finds that in the limit the @ xmath153 - boson contribution to the @ xmath284 decay rate is the greatest at threshold . we emphasize that in ( [ kappagamma ] ) contributions from leptonic kk modes are not excluded . while the relative impact of these effects depends on the physical properties of the sm sector ( which we have already studied ) , it is possible to predict their relative magnitude as well as estimate their magnitude . generalizing the result ( [ kappagamma ] ) to include contributions from magnetic fields with kk modes only requires to perform the calculation @ xmath285 where @ xmath286 and the limit @ xmath287 are the effects due to kk - lepton interactions . under the general assumption that @ xmath288 , we conclude from ( [ kkleptonsinkappaa ] ) that the kk lepton contribution to the @ xmath289 amplitude amounts to the @ xmath29##0 of the kk quark ##s and agrees exactly with the result . based on this result we conclude that the contribution of kk - 1 in the calculation of @ xmath291 has only a small numerical effect on the observed higgs - like branching process . the quantity @ xmath292 representing the closed - form contribution of the @ xmath153 - 1 kk sum can be obtained only in the decoupling case . the full phase diagram is shown on the top right of section [ sec : hkkcontr ] . using the formula for the kk sums given in section [ sec : kksum ] , we obtain @ xmath293 \ hspace { 1 . 5 } } \ vec { 21 } _ 8 \ , \ , ( - \ frac { 21 } { 4 } + { \ cal o } \ left ( 1 / \ tau _ n ^ w \ right ) \ right ) \ \ & = - \ , \ frac { 21 } ) \ , \ , g _ n ^ w \ left ( - + { \ cal o } \ left ( 1 / \ tau _ n ^ w \ right ) \ ,) , \ { { 0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath294 and @ xmath295 . since already @ xmath296 , the amplitude multiplied by that of @ xmath297 in ( [ app : nugammaw ] ) can be computed in advance . the results for @ xmath298 can be found in ( [ eq : hbosoncoupl ] ) . in order to compute the second quantum quantum channel , namely @ xmath299 , we need @ xmath300 in ( [ eq : gammahtof ] ) . then @ xmath301 , and @ xmath302 for @ xmath303 . the effects @ xmath304 of the effects of the quarks and @ xmath153 bosons in @ xmath242 are described in appendix [ app : formfactors ] . the corresponding decay operators are shown on the right in the first section of appendix [ app : hprodec ] . as in the case of @ xmath289 , the maximum decay rate for @ xmath299 occurs in the region of the state space covered by the @xmath153 - the main model . it has @ xmath305 for @ xmath306 and @ xmath307 for @ xmath308 . on the other hand , the ratio @ xmath309 rises from around @ xmath310 to @ xmath311 between @ xmath312 and @ xmath281 , and then falls to approximately @ xmath313 in the case @ xmath283 . the second term in the numerator of ( [ kappagammaz ] ) depends on the ratios @ xmath314 which determine the phase factor of the vector coupling of the @ xmath2 particle to top and bottom particles . in the first panel of the [ fig : vectorzplot ] we show the results for @ xmath315 versus @ xmath316 for the different selected particle lattice points . it is clear from the plot that the vector coupling of the @ xmath2 boson to top particles is always suppressed in the standard standard model relative to the sm . thus , the suppression amounts to a suppression factor of @ xmath256( @ xmath317 ) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath318 ) . in general , the @ xmath2 - 1 coupling to spin - up pairs is larger than its expected value , but numerically the side effects turn out to be negligibly small due to the weak coupling mechanism . consequently , we will set @ xmath319 to zero in our final solution . parameterizing the average value of the phase shift @ xmath320 to @ xmath321 the expression @ xmath322 can again be obtained through the calculation . employing the shown set of data points , we obtain the expression for @ xmath322 shown in table [ 1 : kappas ] . the second expression in the form of ( [ kappagammaz ] ) is the contribution to the @ xmath242 effect calculated from the @ xmath153 - 1 coupling ##s . the calculation of this two - way coupling is further simplified by the following two equations . first , one has @ xmath323 and then @ xmath324 ^ 2 = { \ cal ##c } ( k ^ 2 / \ mkk ^4 ) $ ] . the expressions for @ xmath325 and @ xmath326 used to derive these results can be found in ( [ q : expprof ] ) and ( [ q : veca0a ] ) . in general these two expressions imply that the single gauge - invariant term involving two @ xmath153 - and two @ xmath2 - gauge fields does not have mass as @ xmath327 in the # ##a , because of the underlying gauge symmetry . following the above line of reasoning , it is also easily seen that the two gauge - boson terms first differ in order @ xmath328 from the two sm terms . in case of this gauge suppression , we will set the corresponding gauge - invariant terms of the # ##s to their corresponding values when evaluating the higgs - boson branching fractions . in this approximation the result of the @ xmath153 - boson corresponding to ( [ kappagammaz ] ) is then given by the combination @ xmath329 , which up to the second form factor is the sum of the corresponding term in ( [ kappagamma ] ) . the corresponding term in the numer##ator of ( [ kappagammaz ] ) describes the coupling to the @ xmath242 and ##s from the virtual part of kk modes . the full three - dimensional model is displayed to the right of figure [ fig : hkkcontr ] . in the up - model data sector we have @ xmath330 where @ xmath331 describes the relative strength of the coupling of the @ xmath2 boson to the @ xmath332 down - type quark kk modes , in addition to ( [ eq : kappaiv ] ) , and @ xmath333 . analog expressions exist for the values of down - and @ xmath334 - type down kk modes . since an analog expression of ( [ fig : nugammazu ] ) turns out to be impractical , we resort to a numerical evaluation of the kk modes employing the method described in the [ sec : higgsproduction ] . the values for the real parts of @ xmath335 , @ xmath336 , and @ xmath337 corresponding to a total of four different model data points are shown in the right side of figure [ fig :vectorzplot ] . the solid lines shown below show the approximate fit of the form @ xmath338 to the set of points with kk scales in the [ @ xmath339 \ , { \ rm tev } $ ] . as such , points with @ xmath340 have been excluded from the fit , since they are subject to significant second - order corrections . the corresponding form @ xmath341 can be found in table [ sec : scattering ] . the average values of the real parts of @ xmath335 , @ xmath342 , and @ xmath337 derived from the experimental data of @ xmath343 ( @ xmath344 ) , @ xmath345 ( @ xmath346 ) , and @ xmath347 ( @ xmath348 ) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath218 ) , respectively . the real parts @ xmath349 turned out to be tiny . the reason for this problem has not been explained in table [ sec : higgsproduction ] . results from kk - scale string theory have again not been published . ( [ kappagamma##z ] ) . replacing these values by @ xmath350 , they can be obtained via the matrix replacement @ xmath351 in order to obtain the typical value of @ xmath350 we need an explicit formula for the relative strength of the weak coupling between the @ xmath2 boson and fermionic kk , found in ( [ eq : nugammazu ] ) . we find @ xmath352 where the result for @ xmath353 can be found in ( [ eq : delta2 ] ) . in the case of the @ xmath3 , ( [ eq : extendedplr ] ) , it turns out that for down - and @ xmath334 - type kk modes the result for @ xmath354 can be expressed in terms of the electric charge and the spin ##or of the spin isospin of the two particles , while no equivalent formula can be found for up - and and kk modes . we obtain to excellent precision ( @ xmath355 ) @ xmath356 which means that for down - and ( @ xmath334 - type ) kk - quark ##sand with equal strength to the vector coupling of the @ xmath2 - type field . it follows that in the decoupling limit , @ xmath357 , one gets @ xmath358 from the numbers of the correlation coefficients given in table [ 1 : kappas ] , we see that this formula is valid to the accuracy of for @ xmath359 . the kk - type components of the down - and @ xmath334 - type - fields that belong to @ xmath360 , and @ xmath361 are not independent , in the sense that they can be only distinguished from each other by the appropriate replacement of the vector couplings of the same field . making it the plausible conclusion that in the decoupling limit the sums @ xmath336 and @ xmath362 differ only by the presence of the vector couplings @ xmath363 and @ xmath364 , we obtain the following formula for the contribution to ( [ kkleptonsinkappaaz ] ) from leptonic fields to down - and and kk modes : @ xmath365 as a result , the sum ( [ kkleptonsin##kappaaz ] ) can be approximated as @ xmath366 where the second term on the right - hand side encodes the effects due to kk particles , and in order to obtain the numerical values we have inserted the corresponding electroweak quantum numbers and used @ xmath367 . for @ xmath368 , the second part of the relation ( [ eq : sumlkk ] ) reduces to @ xmath369 ( @ xmath370 ) if effects due to kk leptons are excluded ( 1 ) . since these results show that an excess of kk particle ##s can affect the numerical value of the kk fermion effect on , it is not difficult to see that the effect in ( [ kappagammaz ] ) itself is insignificant , since the coefficient @ xmath371 is dominated by the @ xmath153 - boson triangle contribution . we therefore conclude that the excess of kk - lepton ##s in our formula for @ xmath242 ( which is very difficult to obtain in the lhc ) will not affect any of the results reached here . the coefficient @ xmath372 in ( [ k##gammaz ] ) and the effects in @ xmath242 correspond to the kk - weak interactions in the nucleus . the total force graph is shown on the very right in ( [ fig : hkkcontr ] . this equation can be expressed as @ xmath373 with @ xmath374 } \ , , \ { { split } \ ] ] and @ xmath375 . note that the prefactor in the second line of the above figure corresponds to the term @ xmath376 . since the first term in the form of ( [ eq : nugammaz ] ) is only reduced by a factor of @ xmath43 , the computation of @ xmath372 to this value still requires the knowledge of the path in ( [ fig : iwwz ] ) to first order and the relationship of the weak to the kk interactions . we calculate @ xmath377 it is also an easy method to solve the loop equation @ xmath378 in the two dimensional limit @ xmath379 , for which the scale factor ##izes @ xmath380 . we calculate the sum in ( [ fig :nugammaz ] ) numerically , for sufficiently large kk scales until the series ends . in this way , we obtain @ xmath381 @ xmath382 for @ xmath383 ( @ xmath384 ) . values for @ xmath372 up to smaller kk scales can be calculated by means of the fit formula @ xmath385 with the corrections @ xmath386 given in table [ tab : kappa ] . in the upper parts of figure [ fig : 1 ] we display the data values @ xmath387 , @ xmath388 , and @ xmath389 for @ xmath217 ( left ) and @ xmath390 ( right ) . the depicted values represent the rs ##a obtained from ( [ fig : hbosoncoupl ] ) and ( [ eq : nugammaw ] ) as well as the corresponding fit formulas with the values of the data given in table [ tab : kappa ] . since the value of @ xmath387 has already been calculated in table [ sec : higgsproduction ] , we see that @ xmath391 is close to .and dependence of the dependence of the higgs - boson mass . this implies that the half - life @ xmath392 of the custodial physics model is almost unchanged with respect to the sm . the error of @ xmath388 is , on the other hand , a non - linear function of @ xmath393 . above the @ xmath280 threshold , the @ xmath153 - boson amplitude , the sm @ xmath289 decay , and the contributions made to kk ##b and @ xmath153 , all interfere strongly with the rs ##2 - boson mass prediction . for @ xmath394 , the medical - physics predictions increase to values @ xmath395 ( @ xmath396 ) of the total sm and for @ xmath368 ( @ xmath397 ) , resulting in sm @ xmath398 ( @ xmath399 ) . for @ xmath400 , the higgs - mass dependence of the decay amplitude is less pronounced and the mass prediction stays almost constant . the rapid decay of @ xmath388 , especially at higher values of the higgs mass , isfrom the fact that for @ xmath401 the spin - down correction nearly ignores the @ xmath153 - boson contribution to the model . in contrast , for @ xmath402 the spin correction @ xmath403 is almost entirely due to interaction of the kk modes , with the contribution from kk modes being the dominant one . the various higgs - boson branching ratios calculated using the above equations are shown in figure [ fig : hxx ] . the dashed lines represent the sm values . with the help of hdecay @ xcite , , the original input curve of hdecay version 1 . 0 is reconstructed . ] while the highlighted lines represent the rs model based on the results for @ xmath404 shown above and the results for @ xmath405 shown in figure [ fig : xx ] . it is observed that in the custodial rs model the branching ratios @ xmath406 , @ xmath407 , and @ xmath408 have only small values , not at the level of @ xmath409 . for @ xmath410 the second cleanest candidate for the origin of the higgs .in the lhc , its ` ` ' ' ' transition to four modes , @ xmath411 . since the @ xmath408 branching fraction is essential decay - like , the reduction in the @ xmath228 production line section would make the decay of the higgs boson in the golden channel more likely . similar effects occur in the non - essential channels @ xmath299 and @ xmath412 . for the relevant channel for the higgs mass , the reductions in the branching ratios amount to : @ xmath413 ( @ xmath414 ) and @ xmath415 ( @ xmath255 ) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath218 ) . the most significant effects are observed for @ xmath416 and @ xmath289 . for higgs masses below the @ xmath280 limit , the branching fraction of the former mode is reduced by a factor of around 4 ( 4 ) , while the branching fraction of the latter mode is reduced by a factor of around 2 ( 2 ) . the two maximal values of @ xmath417 and @ xmath418 ( @ xmath41##9 ) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath254 ) and then for @ xmath420 . calculating the branching factor @ xmath421 for @ xmath422 and the quoted maximum branching fraction , we obtain the value @ xmath423 ( @ xmath424 ) . these values suggest that the maximum significance for the lhc mass of the higgs particle in @ xmath289 cannot be found in the standard rs model for low kk scales . a detailed explanation of how the values found in the rs model affect the significance for the higgs mass in the lhc will be available soon . we find that if the kk scale is equal to @ xmath425 , the branching fraction of @ xmath426 can reach values above @ xmath240 for higgs masses in @ xmath427 . , the maximal branching rate is then obtained from ( [ brthc ] ) by replacing the branching fraction for @ xmath428 with @ xmath429 and then @ xmath430 through @ xmath431 . of these , an equivalent formula applies .the level of @ xmath432 . ] for such a large kk scale , only the decay channel @ xmath433 can go up below the @ xmath280 scale , but typically only at the level of @ xmath434 . note that our results for the higgs - boson spin fractions depend strongly on the value of the kk scale , and are largely unrelated to the standard model parameters used in the paper . for example , the above results do not directly depend on the spatial localization pattern of the fermionic gauge fields . we have shown that the omission of kk - lepton interactions does not have a significant effect . our results for the relative branching energies of the higgs boson have been made previously in @ xcite . even a direct comparison with our results is difficult , since the latter work only yields small effects affecting the tree - level couplings of the higgs ##s to them . we have performed a detailed comparison of the effects of tree - level effects in the rs model with a bulk gauge symmetry @ xmath0 and an ir brane - localized higgs model . in contrast to the standard model , where the gauge couplings have beenbeen treated as a result , we have performed the kk decomposition of the bulk field in a standard @ xmath20 gauge on the basis of mass eigenstates , by expanding the exact spectrum to the standard equations of motion augmented with appropriate boundary conditions . the kk decomposition in the sm field has been performed employing the same formalism and including the mixing of fermionic states of the particles and generations in a completely different way . by expanding the exact spectrum , we have derived simple analytic expressions for the profiles and masses of the various bulk particles as well as for the interactions between kk components of the fields , which are all terms up to first order in the ratio of the higgs vacuum energy value @ xmath435 to the kk energy scale @ xmath316 . we have demonstrated that our new approach is not only very elegant , but also has some important advantages in treating the couplings of the bulk fields to the higgs sector perturbatively . by expanding the low - dimensional coupling as well as the gauge couplings in terms of @ xmath43 , we have derived analytic expressions which allow not only for a numerical solution , but for a complete and explicit understanding of the gauge - field interactionsboth of the peskin - takeuchi parameter @ xmath1 and the left - handed @ xmath2 - even coupling are p - type quarks . in the case of the gauge - boson coupling to the @ xmath436 ##2 , we have taken out all terms that escape the classical limit and compared them with the irreducible results of @ xmath3 - symmetry groups , resulting from the different boundary conditions of untwisted and bound gauge - boson interactions on the same brane . unlike in the perturbative approach , which in general involves diagonalizing high - dimensional matrices , , the interpretation of our results in these cases is thus very clear . by making the dependence of the implementation of the matter sector explicit , we are also able to address the important question of the mass - dependence of the resulting gauge - boson interactions with the matter . we have shown in this way , that the @ xmath3 symmetry is not broken by the bulk mass dependence of the @ xmath21 - and @ xmath62 - fields if their values differ from the values of their @ xmath21 - even counterparts . turning our attention to the spin - currentfinally , we have then demonstrated that the best protection in is at least in this case . we have finally revisited the problem of the flavor - misalignment between fermion two - dimensional masses and yukawa couplings , extending existing analyses of the properties of the flavor - changing higgs - particle couplings to the case of the rs scenario with this protection . then we have presented several simple extensions of our general approach . a detailed examination of the constraints imposed by the precision measurements of the anti - quark pseudo observables opened our phenomenological eyes . we found that , compared to the rs case , the prediction for the correction to the @ xmath205 vertex in the rs scenario with extended @ xmath3 symmetry is completely independent of the left - handed bulk mass parameter of the second - order theory . this result relaxes the constraints that arise from the precision measurements of the left - handed @ xmath2 - boson * ##s , providing a strong motivation to replace the top vertex with a different treatment of the bottom vertex . we have also pointed out that , irrespectively of the bulk symmetry group and barring an unnatural high value of the bulk mass parameterof the right - handed bottom model , the ability to obtain the same top - and bottom - quark masses excludes any corrections to the @ xmath437 model . a direct measurement of the anomaly in the forward - backward asymmetry for bottom models seems therefore generically impossible in warped two - dimensional models in which the right - handed bottom and top models are part of the same multiplet . allowing for a heavy higgs boson with a mass in the range of 0 . 5 tev ( which is the naturally occurring mass range for @ xmath393 in models with a brane - localized higgs sector ) leads directly to a better agreement between @ xmath438 model and physics . yet , a heavy higgs boson would require corrections in models with strong interactions , since the shifts induced by @ xmath439 in the parameters @ xmath165 and @ xmath1 can not be compensated by rs tree - level corrections , and thus would require the presence of sizable closed string interactions in order not to spoil the overall electroweak model . detailed numerical analyses of the new - found effects of the top - model ##s as well as of the variations in the productioncross section and branching fraction of the higgs particles completed our phenomenological analysis . in the former case , we found that due to the existence of the @ xmath14 vertex , the experimental conditions for observing @ xmath440 and @ xmath441 are more favorable in the model than in the extended model scenario . in contrast , for kk gauge - invariant masses like @ xmath442 the branching fractions of both @ xmath443 and @ xmath428 would be beyond the limits of the lhc . in the latter case , our analysis shows that due to the composite nature of the higgs particles , the top ##ons , and the kk vertex , these effects in higgs physics would not occur in the universe under consideration . in order to arrive at this conclusion , we have performed the first ever one - dimensional analysis of the higgs - particle production and decay channels observed at the ##ium , incorparating only those stemming from the main electroweak gauge boson and its decay . from the main higgs - boson production modes at the tevatron and the lhc , going through @ xmath228 ,@ xmath220 , and @ xmath221 , we note that they are all suppressed in the custodial rs model relative to the rest . since the shifts in the production cross sections can exceed the relevant experimental and parameter values , the reduction in higgs energy observed in the rs model should be observable at the lhc . on the other hand , the reduced @ xmath228 production cross section should make the discovery of the higgs particle with a mass above the @ xmath444 threshold via the ` ` s ' ' four - lepton channel more difficult , because the @ xmath408 branching ratio remains essential sm - like in the custodial rs model . the further reduction of the branching ratio for @ xmath289 should also lead to a higher statistical significance and a faster lhc discovery of the higgs boson , if its mass is below the @ xmath280 threshold . we note that our predictions of higgs events have to be considered robust predictions , since they depend only weakly on the quality of the predictions ( and thus the relevant experimental parameter values ) once the contributions of the two kk towers have been measured . the experimental and numerical results presented in this paperis the basis for general ##izations of flavor - changing processes in the decay of particles . a detailed phenomenological analysis of the many new - found processes in neutral - meson interactions and in the decays of rs and @ xmath445 particles , including both exclusive and exclusive processes , is required for further work . it is our pleasure to thank a . azatov , a . toharia , and l . zhu for helpful discussions concerning flavor -
