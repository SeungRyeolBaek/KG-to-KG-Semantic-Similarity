it has been known for several decades that bright low - mass x - ray stars ( lmxbs ) are @ xmath1 - rich in galaxy clusters ( gcs ) close to the galactic field ( katz 1975 ; lewis 1975 ) . more specifically , clusters contain most of the @ xmath1 and ##est lmxbs , but only @ xmath20 . 01 % of the total stellar mass population of the cluster . the reason for this is thought to be the lack of _ _ _ lmxb formation channels , which are only available in the galactic cores . potential examples include the orbital collision of a neutron star ( ns ) with a gas giants ( verbunt 1987 , smith et al . 1992 , ivanova et al . 2005 ) , the tidal bombardment of a main sequence star by a planet ( davies , pringle & rees 1975 ; bailyn & grindlay 1987 ) and the reactions between nss and primordial stars ( hilles 1976 ; rasio et al . 2000 ) . if the different lmxb formation channels are different in space and the galactic core , the properties of their respective lmxb components may also be different . in fact , most of the bright lmx##bs in parentheses may indicate ultracompact x - ray sources ( ucxbs ; bildsten & deloye 2004 , ivanova et al . ucxbs , which are binary systems with extremely small angular separation ( @ xmath3 min ) and short orbital periods ( @ xmath4 min min ) , seem to be rare amongst the light field lmxb populations : the list of confirmed ucxbs ( with measured @ xmath5 ) in int zand et al . ( 2007 ) contains only 5 stars that belong to this population . in comparison , 3 of the 13 gc lmxbs are confirmed ucxbs ; these are 4u1820 - 02 in ngc6624 ( @ xmath6 min , stella et al . 1987 ) , 4u1850 - 087 in ngc6712 ( @ xmath7 min , stella et al . 1996 ) and cxoj212958 . 1 + 121002 - m15 ( = m15 - x2 ; dieball et al . 2005 ) , with several more suggested to be ultracompact x - ray sources on the basis of more recent observations ( see e . g . verbunt & lewin2006 for a review ) . since the mass distribution of gc lmxbs can be a direct tracer of the many close encounters taking place at their cores , it is important to determine orbital periods for as many of these sources as possible . doing so could potentially lead to a significant reduction in the size of the total ucxb sample . this is important , because ucxbs are astrophysically important systems in their own right . this is because they provide laboratories for accretion and binary observations in extreme cases , and because they are powerful gravitational wave sources that can be detected by lisa ( nelemans & jonker 2006 ; nelemans 2009 ) . here , we have time - resolved , far - uv images of the lmxb 4u 0513 - 40 in ngc 1851 , which was suspected to be a ucxb based on two strands of circumstantial evidence ( deutsch etal 2000 ; verbunt 2005 ; nelemans & jonker 2006 ; int zand etal . 2007 ) . our far - uv data of this source shows an @ xmath8 17 min # ##ity that is consistent in all three observing epochs , is consistent with being active and is likely caused by the presence ofassociated with the dark surface of the central region of this system . based on all this , we argue that the observed brightness variability has an unusual character , and thus that 4u 0513 - 1 should be classified as a typical ucxb with @ xmath9 detection . ngc 1851 was observed three times with the f140lp filter in the planetary system camera ( sbc ) of the australian camera for spectroscopy ( acs ) on board the _ hst _ . this instrument / camera / filter combination had a plate scale of 0 . 032 pixel @ xmath10 , a pivot scale of @ xmath11 , and an rms ##e of @ xmath12 . all of the observations took place in august of 2006 . the observing session consisted of the _ hst _ orbits , broken down into a series of 90 different exposures . in total , we observed 273 of these exposures . in addition , we also examined three images taken in august of 1999 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , using the fuv - 1 / f25qtz instrument / filter combination , with a plate scale of 0 . 025 pixel @ xmath10 , @ xmath13 and @ xmath14. a full summary of the data , as well as their reduction and analysis will be provided in a separate article ( zurek et al . 2009 , in preparation ) . however , all of the fuv count rates and parameters presented in this article were calculated via multiple aperture photometry techniques , as described in the _ daophot _ package _ _ iraf _ . for the photometry of our acs / sbc ( stis / fuv - mama ) images , we need an aperture radius of 4 ( 4 ) pixels and a background annulus extending from 10 to 35 ( 20 to 35 ) pixels . this radius is sufficient for our purposes because the fuv count is not very large ( see figure 1 ) . the wavelength - dependent throughput ##s of the ac / sbc / f140lp and stis / fuv - mama / f25qtz camera / detector / camera combinations are very similar , though not identical . . we checked for far - field interference by comparing the ac and stis count rates , after checking for wavelength differences and the different photometric aperture sizes and background regions that are used . we then calculated this correction factor from a set of ( light - dependent branch ) values that are applicable to both .of astronomy . we find that for these stars , our acs / sbc count rates are 1 . 5 times higher than our stis / f25qtz rates . homer et al . ( 2001 ) have also used the hst / stis / f25qtz data to determine the optical / far - uv components of 4u 0513 - 40 . they confirm the suggestion of deutsch et al . ( 2000 ) that ` ` star a ' ' ( in the words of deutsch et al . ) is the blue counterpart to the lmxb , while two other light sources , identified as possible counterparts by aurire , bonnet - bidaud & koch - miramond ( 1994 ) , designated as x - 1 and x - 2b , are consistent with the observed chandra components of 4u 0513 - 40 . figure 1 shows the location of these two sources in our acs / sbc data . since homer et al . ( 2001 ) have not reported a positive correlation for far - uv variability associated with star a in the stis data , we started by focusing on the other , more signal - to - noise ratio source . the chandra - based far - uv light sources of all 3 sources are shown in figure 2 .it is immediately obvious that star a , the counterpart observed by deutsch et al . ( 2000 ) and homer et al . ( 2001 ) , does , in fact , show significant far - uv variability , even between the two observing sources . for example , the spectral count rate drops by a factor of about 2 between epochs 2 and 3 . a similar change in count rate is observed for sources x - 2a or x - 2b , which bracket star a in far - uv variability . we have searched for _ periodic _ signals in the data by carrying out a simple spectral analysis . figure 1 shows the lomb - scargle power spectra obtained for all 3 sources from the combined observing data sets . it is immediately obvious that only star a shows any indication of a signal at a frequency other than hst s - band ( @ xmath15 ) . more specifically , there is an obvious signal at a frequency of about @ xmath16 or about @ xmath10 ( which corresponds to a period of @ xmath17 min ) . in an attempt to better understand the star a power spectrum ( specifically the spectral excess at @ xmath15 and the sidebands at @ xmath18 ) , we have developed a simple modelpower curve . this model uses exactly the same time sampling as the observations , contains a single 17 - min periodic signal with amplitude 0 . 75 % at @ xmath10 and accounts for the dominant long - term variability in the data , making the observed mean count rate in each epoch equal to the observed one . the power spectrum obtained from this simple error free model is shown in the second quadrant of figure 3 ( labelled ` ` in a simulation ' ' ) , and clearly captures some of the important features of the data . this means that both the sidebands at @ xmath19 and the only apparent signal at @ xmath15 have significant errors . the latter , in turn , is due to leakage from the low - frequency power spectrum associated with the long - term variability . in order to determine if the 17 min signal is correct , we carried out power curve analysis for each epoch again , where we now also included the stis data that was obtained 7 years after the first observations . the result is shown in figure 4 . the periodicity was clearly present in all the observations ( 1 stis + 1 c ) , but was noticeably weaker in the stis epoch and in the third acs epoch . taken in isolation , the power excessat @ xmath19 , each of those epochs would be marginally significant at present . both figures 3 and 4 show that there are several plausible trends associated with the 1 min signal . in order to determine the relative likelihoods for each of these and get estimates of the trends associated with each of them , we carried out a statistical analysis . only the acs data was used for this analysis , since the correlation is weakest in the stis data and since no observed cycle count can be attributed to the short time interval between the stis and acs observations . we began by eliminating long - term trends from the data stream by taking the cycle count rate for each hst orbit and subtracting these averages from the data . next , we created a mock time series by sampling with data from the orbit - mean - rounded acs data . finally , we created power spectra for all of these fake data , and selected the values corresponding to peak flux . the histogram created from this set of peak flux is shown in figure 5 ( based on the orbit - mean subtracted power spectrum for all of the data , which is shown in the same region ) . as expected from the power spectrum , there are clearly two dominant plausible trends. the relative number of bootstrap peaks associated with each alias provides a measure of the probability that this alias is the correct alias ( see southworth et al 2006 , 2007 , 2008 and dillon et al . 2008 ) . similarly , the location and width of the # ##s associated with each alias provides a rough estimate of the period and period amplitude for this alias . our final results for the three possible aliases are : @ xmath20 we have tried to determine more precisely whether the periodic signal is consistent with being coherent across all of our data and whether the evidence for a constant amplitude is compelling . to this end , we carried out a least - squares fit to the root - and - neutron stis + acs data set for star clusters . in this fit , the amplitude is kept fixed at @ xmath21 that are present in the time series of the _ combined _ stis + acs [ . ] , so the free parameters are the phase and amplitude ( both assumed to be constant across the data ) . the result of this fit is shown in figure 6 . this illustrates quite clearly that the amplitude is not constant across time . as we noted above , the signal is constant across acs epochs 1 and 2 and inin the stis data and the # ##s . the fit also shows that the assumption of constant phase is correct , i . e . the observed signal is consistent with being coherent across the entire data set . in order both to test for the coherent properties of the signal , and to determine the average waveform , we then folded the original stis + 1 data stream for sample a onto the same ( double - ) alias that was used for the signal in figure 6 . the result is shown in figure 7 , along with the double - alias average waveform . thus , the result appears to be consistent with the assumption that the signal is fully coherent . however , the observed signal is fairly simple and roughly sinusoidal . as a first step , we carried out multiple fits with fixed period to each sample epoch in order to quantify the changing phase of the 17 - min signal . figure 1 shows the sample decay rates and frequencies as well as the amplitudes of the signal as obtained from these fits . the fractional amplitude varies by over a factor of 10 between epochs , from about 5 % to 20 % , with the largest change happening across the 17 - min gap between acs epochs 2 and 3 . it is also worth noting thatthere appears to be a correlation between the fuv brightness of the system ( i . e . the mean brightness amplitude ) and the amplitude of the 17 - min signal , in the sense that the amplitude is highest when the system is brightest . this correlation exists regardless of whether the amplitude is measured in absolute or fractional terms . it is worth noting that there is a connection between our claim that the 17 - min signal is present in the stis observations , and the non - detection of the periodicity in the same data set as homer et al . ( 2001 ) . as mentioned above , the signal is only partially detectable if this data set is analysed in detail . what makes the weak power excess in the stis observations possible is that it is located at the same frequency as the periodic signal in the acs data set . therefore , homer et al . ( 2001 ) put a formal upper limit of 5 % on the amplitude of the signal between 5 min and 6 hrs . this is also consistent with our own estimate of a 5 % amplitude for the 17 min signal in the stis data ( see table below ) . we have shown that the fuv corresponding to 4u 0513 - 40 in ngc 1851 is a strong power signal with@ xmath0 min . this signal is roughly sinusoidal , has an amplitude of 3 % - 10 % , is observed in all known fuv observing systems and is consistent with being fully coherent . these properties are in line with those of the orbital signals observed in uv / visible observations of the ucxb ( e . g . anderson et al . 1996 ; anderson et al . 1997 ; dieball et al . 2005 ) and with the theoretical model in which these signals are due to a ` ` halo effect ' ' associated with the irradiated donor region of the system ( arons & king 1993 ) . in the arons & king ( 1993 ) model , there are two sources that contribute to the fuv / optical signal : the rotating outer face of the donor star ( which is assumed to be a low - mass , metal - rich white dwarf ) , and the debris disk , whose energy release is also caused by rotation . the resulting orbital signal is due to the total kinetic energy of the rotating portion of the donor star , with the fractional amplitude being determined by the relative sensitivity of the disk and debris to the time - averaged fuv / optical light . we have checked that this total .model matches roughly the fractional fuv amplitude using different choices of parameters ( including the low - to - high ratio ) . the dependence of the fuv amplitude is complicated further by different fuv responses of the source and donor to changes in the irradiating x - ray luminosity . in this context , a factor of @ xmath8 2 change in total fuv and fractional amplitude would produce roughly an order of magnitude variation in @ xmath22 . this is consistent with the x - ray variability of the source in the rxte data set , where factors of 3 changes in decay rate are seen on time - scales as short as 3 . for comparison , the largest of observed variations in x - ray luminosity from this source were a factor of 5 ( grindlay & hertz 1983 ) . it is likely that additional factors such as changes in temperature , changes in reprocessing efficiency , and uv shielding , play a significant role in the change of the amplitude of the uv signal . based on all this , we are confident that the fuv signal we have discovered is orbital in nature and probably due to a solar wind effect . we can identify 4u 0513 - 1 as a ucxb with @ x##math17 ##4 , making it the fourth confirmed ucxb in the galactic gc . the identification of this source as a ucxb is entirely consistent with existing circumstantial evidence regarding its existence . more specifically , the extreme ultraviolet , x - ray emission and burst spectra of 4u 0513 - 1 have been known for some time to point towards the ucxb classification ( e . g . verbunt 2005 ) . given the very short orbital period we have observed , it is reasonable to ask if the gravitational radiation energy produced by this source would be predicted by lisa . the gravitational radiation energy for a circular orbit is given in a simplified form by nelemans , yungelson & portegies zwart ( 2001 ) as : @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 , @ xmath25 is the mass of the neutron star donor , and @ xmath26 is the mass of the white dwarf donor , and with the hydrogen leaking out entirely in the second half , for a circular orbit . if we substitute @ xmath27 , @ xmath28 kpc ( , 1996 ) and @ xmath29 ( ) for this @ xmath5 by the mass - energy relations of deloye &bildsten [ 2003 ] ) , we find the strain of @ xmath30 . this is at about the sub - @ xmath31 level for a one year mission with lisa , suggesting that the system may be detectable if the mission duration is several years . in practice , this will , however , strongly depend on the position and time - dependence of the gravitational - wave energy due to the wds , which may be significant in the relevant frequency regime ( @ xmath32 ) ; e . g . nelemans et al . an additional challenge for detecting gravitational radiation from this object would be dealing with the possible effects of acceleration of the binary on the gravitational potential of the globular cluster , which could lead to a measurable frequency drift over several years , for which a correction would have to be made in order to keep all the gravitational wave observations in a single data set . the fact that the location and time of the burst are already known ( and the latter can still be substantially determined before lisa launches ) would be helpful in this regard and also ameliorate the hidden source problem . we also point out that , as more ucxb sources are being measured , it seems increasingly likely that there are significant differences in the frequency distributions of theand field ucxbs . all four of the confirmed field ucxbs have @ xmath33 min , whereas all four of the confirmed field ucxbs have @ xmath34 min ( nelemans & jonker 2006 ; int zand , jonker & markwardt 2007 ) . clearly , this comparison can not yet be taken at face value : the present data are still very limited and selection effects have not been taken into account . furthermore , there is still no clear dividing line between the different orbital period distributions . for example , the binary lmxb 4u 1543 - 624 ##b has an orbital period of around 18 years ( wang & chakrabarty 2004 ) , even though it is not yet included in the list of confirmed ucxbs compiled by nelemans & jonker ( 2006 ) and int zand et al . ( 2007 ) . moreover , the period distributions are in line with the hypothesis that different ucxb orbital periods should dominate in the two different environments . if so , it may be possible to use the period distribution of field ucxbs as a trace of binary evolution , and that of gc ucxbs as a trace of stellar evolution in both environments . this hypothesis is supported bynasa grant grant 2006 - 10184 from the space telescope science center , which is sponsored by aura , inc . , and nasa grant nas5 - 26555 . we thank professor verbunt for pointing out that all the x - ray galaxies with rotation periods less than half an hour are actually open clusters . arons , a . & smith , d . r . 1993 , apj , 413 , l121 aurire , j . , de fvre , j . & terzan , j . 1984 , a & b , 138 , 415 bailyn , j . a . & grindlay , j . d . 1987 , apj , 316 , l25 bildsten , j . & deloye , j . j . 2004 , apj , 607 , l119 miller , j . b . 1975 , apj , 199 , l143 miller , j . b . , benz , j . & miller , j . b . 1992 , apj , 401 , 246 deutsch , j . w . , margon , j . , & miller , s . a . 2000 , , 530 , l21 dieball a . , knigge a . , zurek s . a . , sharaj . a . , smith j . a . , williams p . a . , hannikainen p . a . , van zyl j . , 2005 , apj , 634 , l105 dillon , m . , gansicke , j . j . , augwerojwit , j . , rodriguez - gil , m . , smith , m . j . , barros , m . j . a . , szkody , m . , williams , j . , krajci , m . & oksanen , m . 2008 , mnras , 386 , 1568 hill p . a . , pringle j . a . , rees j . a . , 1975 , mnras , 172 , 15p williams , p . a . 1996 , aj , 112 , 1487 hill p . a . , 1976 , mnras , 175p , 1 hill , l . , williams , p . a . , naylor , j . et al . 1996 , mnras , 282 , l37 hill l . , hill j . a . , margon j . , deutsch j . a . , hill j . j . , 2001 , apj , 550 , l155 homer , p .2003 , kitp conference : ` ` the evolution of ultracompact galactic objects ' ' ( may 1 - 3 , 2003 ) , authors : j . bildsten , s . chakrabarty , g . nelemans , http : / / www . itp . ucsb . edu / conference / workshop _ c03 / . int zand c . j . a . , jonker p . g . , markwardt m . j . , 2007 , a & b , 465 , 953 ivanova , a . , rasio , f . a . , lombardi , g . m . , dooley , m . j . & proulx , j . m . 2005 , apj , 621 , l109 katz , m . a . 1975 , b , 253 , 698 nelemans , g . 2009 , arxiv : 0901 . 1778 nelemans g . , jonker p . g . , 2006 , astro , arxiv : astro - ph / 0605722 rasio , f . a . , pfahl , m . j . & rappaport j . 2000 , apj , 532 , l47 katz , m . ,priedhorsky , j . , & smith , j . r . 1987 , apj , 312 , l17 southworth , j . , gansicke , b . t . , marsh , t . r . , de martino , d . , hakala , p . , littlefair , m . , rodriguez - gil , m . & szkody , m . 2006 , mnras , 373 , 687 southworth , j . , marsh , t . r . , gansicke , b . t . , augwerojwit , a . , hakala , p . , de martino , d . & lehto , m . 2007 , mnras , 382 , 1145 southworth , j . , gansicke , b . t . , marsh , t . r . , torres , j . m . . d . , steeghs , m . , hakala , p . , copperwheat , j . r . , aungwerojwit , a . , & mukadam , m . 2008 , mnras , 391 , 591 verbunt , a . 1987 , apj , 312 , l23 verbunt a . , 2005 , multiple - use: origins , challenges , and outcomes , aip conference proceedings , aip conference proceedings , 797 , 2006 verbunt j . , lewin j . h . s . , 2006 , astronomy _ the stellar x - ray telescope _ , cambridge university press : cambridge , uk ( w . lewin , m . van der klis ##s . )
