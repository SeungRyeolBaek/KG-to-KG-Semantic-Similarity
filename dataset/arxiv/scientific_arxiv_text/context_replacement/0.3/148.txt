neutrino magnetic moments are no doubt among the most well theoretically understood and widely studied in their field . @ xcite as it was shown in ago @ xcite , in a wide range of theoretical physics neutrino magnetic moment is proportional to the electron mass and in general is small . for instance , for the very dense standard model the average neutrino magnetic moment is given by @ xcite : @ xmath0 at the same time , the magnetic moment of the heavy particles ( with mass @ xmath1 ) is @ xmath2 @ xcite . it should be noted however that much higher values for the neutrino magnetic moments are possible for large extensions of the standard model ( as , for example , ago @ xcite ) constraints on the average magnetic moment can be obtained in @ xmath3 based experiments from the observed lack of distortions of the recoil electron energy spectrum . recent collaborative research provides us with the following upper bounds for the neutrino magnetic moment : @ xmath4 ( munu collaboration @ xcite ) , @ xmath5 ( texono collaboration @ xcite ) . the same collaboration will obtain the world best result @ xmath6@ xcite . another kind of neutrino experiment borexino ( for photon scattering ) has obtained a lower bound : @ xmath7 @ xcite . the best experimental bounds on the effective magnetic moment have been obtained from observation of the gas giants cooling @ xmath8 @ xcite . as it was pointed out , the most accurate experimental constraints on a few effective magnetic moments have been obtained in ( anti ) free - electron scattering experiments and the work to obtain further estimates of the bounds is in process . in particular , it is expected that the new bound at the level of @ xmath9 can be reached by the gemma collaboration with a new series of measurements at the hiroshima nuclear power plant with much smaller proximity of the detector to the reactor that can have increased the neutrino flux ( see @ xcite ) . an attempt to reasonably improve the experimental bounds on the effective magnetic moment was undertaken in @ xcite where it was shown that the correction for the electron scattering energy in atom can significantly reduce the electromagnetic contribution to the scattering cross section with respect to the electron when the free electron approximation is used in calculations of the cross section . however , as it was shown in a series ofin @ xcite the neutrino reactor experiments and measurements of neutrino magnetic moment are not related to the electron binding effect , so that the free electron approximation cannot be used for them . one may expect that the magnetic properties can be much easier visualized when neutrino is propagating in external magnetic fields and dense matter . however , wave propagation in matter is a rather new research field nevertheless still having development and obtaining a lot of interesting results for these problems . the new and simple way for analysis of neutrino interaction processes in matter has been recently presented in a series of papers @ xcite . the developed method is based on the analysis of solutions of the modified wave propagation for neutrino in matter in feynman diagrams . the method was developed specifically for studies of different problems in quantum electrodynamics and is called ` ` ` the method of exact solutions ' ' @ xcite the gain from the introduction of the method was sustained by experiments and the mathematical description of the new phenomenon of the spin evolution of neutrino in matter ( the @ xmath10 ) , first predicted by @ xcite by the non - classical description of the spin evolution . the essence of the @ xmath10 isthe electromagnetic force in the transition between the different helicity states in matter . the limitations of the theoretical approach , such as use of the uniform , unpolarized and non - moving particles , and of the plasma influence on the radiated photon , makes the question of the process relevance in astrophysical settings different from the practical one . in this new paper we should like to take a step towards the completeness of the physical picture and to show the interesting and first hand nature of the plasmon mass observed in the @ xmath10 . the importance of these effects for the @ xmath10 in physics was first pointed out in @ xcite . the experiments already carried out in this paper @ xcite show that the plasmon mass in the @ xmath10 has a considerable mass that can affect the physics of the plasma . to see how the plasmon mass affects the @ xmath10 , we turn to the theory of exact solutions and carry out all the experiments related to the @ xmath10 . in this respect , in order to obtain the results we also apply all the methods for the task the same as for the studies of the @ xmath10 . in particular ,we take only the standard model neutrino ##s and take it instead of electrons . in the final solutions section , one starts with the modified dirac equation for the neutrino in question in order to find initial and final quantum numbers , which would enter the process above . the expression is as : @ xcite : @ xmath11 where in the case of free motion through the non - interacting and unpolarized medium @ xmath12 with @ xmath13 being matter ( particle ) energy density . under this conditions the equation ( [ ref : dirac ] ) has plane - wave spectrum given by two - dimensional @ xmath14 and quantum numbers of helicity @ xmath15 and sign of energy @ xmath16 . for the ease of the identification and general form of the wave function @ xmath17 the process is referred to @ xcite and @ xcite , but we cite only the expression for the total energy spectrum : @ xmath18 the steady - state of the process is the single two - vertex @ xmath19 + i \ { ^ { 5 } { \ bf \ { } \ { \ } $ ] and for given spinors forthe initial and final neutrino states @ xmath20 can be written as @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 is the transition polarization length , @ xmath23 is the transition magnetic moment and @ xmath24 is the normalization length . the wave - function and spinors convolution part lead to the two laws @ xmath25 with expressions for the initial and final neutrinos @ xmath26 , in accordance to ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) . for the photon ##s , for the purposes of our calculations it is necessary to use the above expression @ xmath27 . as was shown in our previous studies , the @ xmath10 @ xcite the most appropriate conditions for the photon to manifest its energy are found in dense astrophysical plasma . this is the setting we will use here for the process and in the case of dense plasma the plasmon mass should be taken as @ xmath28 the numerical expansion at the density parameter @ xmath29 , at the density parameter @ xmath30 . let us now consider the influence of dense plasma on the generation of spin light of interest . according to the first spin light model weconsider the case of a neutrino with the helicity quantum number @ xmath31 and the corresponding zero neutrino helicity number @ xmath32 . using the neutrino energies ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) with corresponding helicities one can solve the equation ( [ q : conservation ] ) in addition to plasmon , which is not equal to the energy since we take into account the dispersion of the incident photon in plasma ( [ photon dispersion ] ) . for ease of calculations it is possible to use the above simplification . in most cases the zero mass happens to be the smallest parameter in the fundamental equation and it is several times smaller than any other parameter in the equation . so we could not examine our method of approximation of zero - mass , and we should not assume that only neutrino with non - zero mass could also have the same mass . this our problem should be considered only as a technical one . it should be noted here that in order to obtain the consistent description of the @ xmath10 one should account for the values of the # ##s in the dispersion relation and the neutrino wave functions . from theenergy - conservation : it follows @ xcite that the process is kinematically possible only under the condition ( taking advantage of the above - mentioned simplification ) : @ xmath33 provided with the plasmon , we proceed with calculation of the @ xmath10 decay rate and total power . the exact calculation of the rate is an intricate problem and the final result is too complicated to be shown clearly . however one can use the most notable set of parameters to show the peculiarities of the rate equation . first of all we calculate the rate for the decay of the @ xmath10 without gravitational influence . this can be done by taking the term @ xmath34 and the final result is in perfect agreement with @ xcite : @ xmath35 from ( [ gammasl ] ) one can calculate the @ xmath10 rate for the important cases , _ i . e . _ low and ultra - high levels of matter just by taking correspondingly @ xmath14 or @ xmath36 with the last term in the brackets . while neutrino energy is the smallest quantity , our system is in the range of the initial decay energies . the corresponding expression for the total power also includes the andultra - low density : @ xcite as well as the second case where the density parameter and the neutrino momentum are equal : @ xmath37 if we look for the gravitational effect ( thus , @ xmath38 ) on the @ xmath10 we can see two different situations . one is the area of density near the threshold , and the other is concerned with the integration of @ xmath39 into the radiation rate expression . the second case is particularly important for this reason , because it serves the purpose of the present article in determining the conditions under which the plasmon mass should actually be measured . for more extreme conditions the density parameter usually appears to be less then the plasmon mass , which in this case is less then the neutrino momentum : @ xmath40 . then the threshold value ( [ threshold ] ) should be considered . as we have the conditions applied to different astronomical objects it is natural to consider high - energy decay . from the series expansion of the total rate one could calculate the rate of the decay in the following form : @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 . at the threshold ( @ xmath43 ) , the rate ( [ gammaslseries ] ) istheoretically , however it is valid for rather wide range of parameters with @ xmath44 and @ xmath45 . near the threshold the the total power can be expressed in the form @ xmath46 . the exact coefficient is too unwieldy to be shown here . concerning the power of the @ xmath10 with plasmon , one can use the formula : @ xmath47 the expansion ( [ intensslseries ] ) is correct only if the system meets the threshold @ xmath48 . otherwise one should use higher values of the @ xmath49 in the expansion to obtain a higher value of intensity . near the threshold the power has the same dependence on the ` ` distance ' ' from the source @ xmath50 and the efficiency of the process . there is an increasing interest to neutrino electromagnetic properties and neutrino magnetic moments in general . this interest is stimulated , both by the advances in upper bounds on magnetic moments which have been recently published , as well as theoretical studies of new processes , related to the magnetic moments , such as the @ xmath10 and a rise in its importance for possible practical applications . further developing the theory of the white dwarfs of the##utrino , we have explicitly shown that the value of plasmon mass is zero ( ( ( [ gammaslseries ] ) and ( [ intensslseries ] ) ) when the parameter @ xmath51 is replaced with @ xmath52 , this corresponds to the system near the threshold . as long as the is @ xmath48 ( and the system is far from the threshold ) one can use the @ xmath10 radiation energy and total power from @ xcite or their rather simple generalizations ( [ gammaslseries ] ) and ( [ intensslseries ] ) where the plasmon mass is accounted for as a minor adjustment . since high energy particles present in matter could be rather common objects in astrophysics , for example in neutron stars , the effect of photon ##s in matter on the @ xmath10 system can be ignored and the threshold generated by the non - zero plasmon mass should not be taken into account . however , the existence of exact solutions of the wave equation provides us with exact solutions for probability and uncertainty in the whole range of the parameters . one of the authors ( n . d . ) is thankful to giorgio bellettini , giorgio sc##arelli , mario greco and gino isidori for the invitation to participate in les rencontres de physics de la vallee daoste . problems and problems in theoretical physics .
