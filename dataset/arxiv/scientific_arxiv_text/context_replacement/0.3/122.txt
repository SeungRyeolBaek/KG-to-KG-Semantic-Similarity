a new idea about possible application of topological superconductors to quantum information processing has attracted both theoretical and experimental interest @ xcite . according to this idea , a quantum information unit , qubit , can be detected and processed by means of majorana mode ( see , for e . g . , ref . ) , located at the end of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) wire in a topological superconductor @ xcite . recent studies suggest several detection mechanisms of such a majorana mode @ xcite such as the observation of a large peak of the tunneling current through a topological superconductor ( s ) - n metal ( n ) junction and fractional peak of the josephson current through s - n - s junction . more recently , systems involving 1d semiconductor wires has been shown to exhibit such modes ; the mechanism of the detection of such modes arises from the combination of the soi , proximity - induced superconducting field , weak interaction and the zeeman field in these wires @ xcite . two majorana modes in the josephson current , located at either topological insulator edges or one - dimensional superconducting nanowires separated by barrier , hybridize resulting in splitting of the zero energy modes . this zero energydepends not only on the phase difference of the two superconductors but also on the relative orientation of the spin axis on the two side of the barrier . the effect of the josephson effect in two such superconductors separated by insulator and metal as a function of their phase difference , with @ xmath9 , instead of a conventional @ xmath10 periodicity due to hybridization of majorana states was predicted by kitaev @ xcite for an idealized example of a 1d spinless p - type superconductor . following this , kwon _ et al _ . @ xcite proposed that the similar effect can be observed in quasi - 1d or 2d unconventional superconducting potential barrier systems where the superconductors are separated by an insulating region , usually modeled by a wave function potential barrier . these systems do not have soi or magnetic field ; p - like effects appeared in these systems from the unconventional nature of the p ##s . and it was realized in 2011 . that a manifestation of the same josephson effect occurs in which a large josephson current , @ xmath11 , in the presence of a high voltage @ xmath12 applied across thejunction . these effects have been interpreted in terms of the josephson current being carried by electrons rather than cooper pairs @ xcite . initially , it was predicted that a circular josephson effect could be realized at topological junction edge @ xcite . this phenomenon has later been extended to topological edges @ xcite . recent activities have established that a topological insulator with proximity - dependence similar to an s - type superconductor exhibits a superconductivity - magnetic interaction @ xcite , revealing the fractional correlation not only with superconducting orientation difference but also with the presence of zeeman magnetic field . in this interaction , the magnetic field on one side of the junction rotates in the plane opposite to the direction of an effective magnetic field of the soi ; however , the spin - mediated josephson current changes direction after @ xmath13 rotation of the magnetic field orientation and reveals an unconventional @ xmath9 periodic magneto - josephson effect in response to rotation of the magnetic field orientation in the topological junction edge @ xcite . moreover , a dissipationless circular josephson effect mediated along with @ xmath14 periodicity has been also predicted @ xcite at the interface ofa quantum spin coupling effect . the josephson effect in terms of the superconducting ( s ) and normal ( n ) states , has been observed in @ xcite . these works also report a pair of spin coupling states located at s - band frequencies , and a fractional josephson current with @ xmath9 periodicity @ xcite . these early works in the field have pointed out the importance of the fractional josephson and the spin - josephson effect in 1d superconducting devices or atop the surface of a magnetic surface . however , the nature of spin - orbit interactions and the strong magnetic field behind these phenomena has not been systematically studied in these earlier works . now a detailed study is the main focus of the current research . to this end , we observe the josephson effect between two 1d nanowires connected along @ xmath0 with an induced @ xmath1 - n superconducting pairing and separated by a narrow gap with a rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) of strength @ xmath2 and magnetic fields ( @ xmath3 along @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 in the @ xmath6 direction ) . aschematic representation of the experimental setup is shown in fig . [ josephson ] . the main results of our study are as follows . first , we present a general method for calculating the andreev bound states energy of these junctions . such a method is a extension of the method of ref . to junctions with strong magnetic fields and spin - orbit coupling . second , in this method , we present analytic expressions for the energy of the andreev bound states in some specific cases and for their dependence on the josephson current . for example , we demonstrate that in the absence of the magnetic fields the energy difference between these bound states decreases with the rashba soi constant and eventually to level , while in the absence of rashba soi , they display oscillatory behaviour with orientational angle of @ xmath15 . third , we present analytic expressions for the internal josephson current charting out their dependence on both @ xmath5 and @ xmath3 and the soi correlation coefficient . fourth , we demonstrate the existence of the anti - josephson current in these junctions in the absence of the magnetic fields and provide analytic expressions for its dependence on @ xmath2 , @ xmath7 and @ xmath3 . finally, we study the ac josephson effect in the presence of the soi ( for @ xmath8 ) and an electromagnetic field and find that the width of the resulting shapiro step in such a system can be determined by varying @ xmath2 . we discuss experiments which will test our experimental results . the rest of the presentation of the paper is as follows . in sec . [ sec2 ] , we describe the model and an explicit representation of hamiltonian is given . the hybridization energy of edge atoms is described in sec . [ sec3 ] , where the explicit expressions for the josephson coupling energy are obtained . this is followed by a discussion of the ac josephson effect in sec . [ sec4 ] . the ac josephson effect in these system and the effect of the shapiro step on soi , are studied in sec . finally we conclude in sec . the results of our experiment are specified in the paper . we consider a junction of two 1d nanowires with violation of @ xmath1 - wave ##leigh symmetry in the presence of rashba spin - orbit interaction and a magnetic field . the explicit representation of such a junction is shown in sec . [ josephson ] where the two supercondu##ctors are not shown for clarity . - effective coupling potential for magnetic fields @ xmath16 and @ xmath5 . - like and due to spin - orbit interaction respectively . the corresponding s - wave superconductors which induces superconductivity in the wires are not shown for clarity . , height = 245 ] in what case we assume the coupling is induced by two different @ xmath1 - wave superconductors which lead to effective coupling potentials @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 between the two wires . the hamiltonian for such a pairing reads @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 represents hamiltonian of the nanowire in the presence of external magnetic fields and @ xmath21 represents rashba soi . the second state is given by @ xmath22 \ sigma _ x + h \ sigma _ x + h \ { [ \ sigma _ x \ cos \ phi _ 1 + \ sigma _ y \ sin \ phi _ 2 ] \ theta ( - x ) + [ \ sigma _ x \ sin \ phi _ 1 + \ sigma _ y \ sin \ phi _ 2 ] \ theta ( x ) \ } \ big ) \ }_ { \ sigma ' } ( x ) \ nonumber \ \ & & + ( \ delta _ 1 \ theta ( - x ) + \ delta _ 2 \ theta ( x ) ) \ psi _ { \ uparrow } ^ { \ dag } ( x ) \ psi _ { \ downarrow } ^ { \ theta } ( x ) + { \ rm ##y . c . } \ { \ } , \ { { \ - x } \ { { \ } \ ] ] where @ xmath23 is the electron recoil operator as seen from the fermi surface @ xmath24 , @ xmath25 is the electron annihilation operator , @ xmath3 and @ xmath5 are external external magnetic fields in @ xmath26 plane and in the @ xmath6 plane respectively , @ xmath27 is the electron correlation operator , and @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 are pauli and newman operators defined in phase space . note that the magnetic field @ xmath5 has an interface @ xmath30 with wire which can be adjusted accordingly . in what follows , we place @ xmath5 on the right side of the junctionto be aligned along the junction ( @ xmath31 ) while in the opposite direction it is chosen to make an angle @ xmath30 with it ( @ xmath32 ) . in e . ( [ h - 1 ] ) , the direction of @ xmath18 in the direction of the junction is chosen to make a phase angle @ xmath33 compared to its left direction : @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 . the potential of @ xmath36 is the barrier potential between two superconductors located at @ xmath37 . the hamiltonian of rashba soi can be written as @ xmath38 \ dot _ { \ dot ' } ( h ) , \ dot { rashba - sc } \ dot { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath2 represents the strength of rashba soi which is chosen to be the same for all wires . in what follows , we shall look for the corresponding subgap andreev bound states with @ xmath39 for the josephson junction of the nanowires described by e . ( [ h ] ) . in this way , we first obtain results for the andreev bound states for junctions described by e. ( [ h ] ) . to do this , it is necessary to use the two - field operator given by @ xmath40 here the first subscript of the field operator ( which we shall designate here as @ xmath41 ) denotes the right - ( @ xmath42 ) and the left - ( @ xmath43 ) , respectively while the second @ xmath44 denotes the right ( @ xmath45 ) or left ( @ xmath46 ) superconductor . in terms of the field operator given by . . ( [ op1 ] ) , the hamiltonian ( . . ( [ h ] ) ) can be written as @ xmath47 using the corresponding indices @ xmath48 in spin - and @ xmath49 in spin - spin - . from . . ( [ h ] ) and ( [ h - 1 ] ) , we get @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 . in . . ( [ h2 ] ) , the energy density of the electrons is linearized around the positive and negative magnetic momenta corresponding to @ xmath52 , where @ xmath53 is thekinetic energy . note that the hamiltonians @ xmath54 exhibit a magnetism - wave interaction @ xcite in the absence of the kinetic energy , implying that it becomes invariant under the interaction @ xmath55 . the phenomenon of the magneto - josephson effect in a topological insulator is known to be a consequence of this duality @ xcite . we shall note that for the system we consider , the magneto - josephson effect takes place only in the absence of the additional effective kinetic energy term of the interaction . the energy spectrum of quasi - particles in a topological superconductor in the presence of soi and external magnetic fields and their behavior for an asymptotic is calculated in the [ appa ] . note that in our model , the energies are different from the fermi energy ; therefore the condition for realization of a topological superconducting phase with an @ xmath56 - wave pairing is @ xmath57 , @ xcite . however , the realization of such a topological phase requires strong @ xmath58 , @ xmath3 and so on so that only the kinetic energy of a single spin state remains on the fermi energy . in what follows we shallnote on the special case where the energies of high spin species are at the critical level and the barrier is an s - potential . the bogolyubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations for the superconductors in the right - and left sides of the diagram are expressed as @ xmath59 where @ xmath60 denotes the bdg wave function . for the systems described by the s - potential @ xmath61 , they satisfy the boundary condition @ xmath62 where @ xmath63 and the diffusion coefficient @ xmath64 are expressed through @ xmath65 as @ xmath66 . for obtaining the energy of the andreev bound states for our system , we first note that measurement of the energy spectrum of the first superconductor ( see , eq . ( [ eo ] ) ) shows that the rashba soi measures the energy spectrum of states along the z axis leading to the fermi points through @ xmath67 ( see , eqs . ( [ e100 ] ) and ( [ k100 ] ) ) . the energy to the andreev bound states comes from momenta at these four points. the external magnetic field attracts spin - up and spin - down electrons ( see , cf . ( [ e011 ] ) and ( [ k011 ] ) ) , and the components of the resulting wavefunction are redistributed between the two points due to the presence of such a boundary . finally , the presence of a boundary between the two superconductors leads to superposition of the right and left moving components . therefore , the bdg wavefunction @ xmath60 can be written as a linear combination of its right and left moving components around each boundary point and with two different coefficients . since we look for bound state solutions , the corresponding solution of eq . ( [ sch ] ) with ( [ h2 ] ) can be written as @ xmath68 % \ end { displaymath } \ end { wave } \ end { wave } \ ] ] where @ xmath69 is the path length of the bound state , and @ xmath70 for @ xmath71 . therefore , we shall rename the solutions as @ xmath72 , @ xmath73 , and @ xmath##74 , @ xmath75 for example . substituting the basis functions ( [ ab ] ) into the boundary functions ( [ ab ] ) one finds eight ordinary differential equations for @ xmath76 , @ xmath77 , @ xmath78 , and @ xmath79 with @ xmath80 which can be expressed in terms of the @ xmath81 matrix @ xmath82 and the column elements @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 . the details of this calculation is given below in section [ appa2 ] . the value of the andreev spin ##or can then be calculated from @ xmath85 . we note that since the states of @ xmath86 vanish in the presence of soi and gauge field ; in this case , either @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 or both @ xmath78 and @ xmath79 vanish . the product of four elements of the @ xmath81 matrix , and on @ xmath89 become equal to the four column elements as @ xmath90 , and the matrix @ xmath82 .as @ xmath91 and @ xmath92 . _ andreev bound states at @ xmath93 : _ in this example , the andreev bound states are calculated at @ xmath94 , written for electron and hole pairs with opposite spins @ xcite . the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) for the wave equation ( [ bc ] ) , written in the front of the soi , by definition yield again eight equations for four coefficients @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 ; these equations are bdg : for a p - type superconductor with p - 1 eigenfunctions @ xmath97 and @ xmath98 , where the overline of the matrix ( e . g . , @ xmath99 ) means the opposite side of sign . one finds four coefficients corresponding to an electron - hole pair with opposite spins . the determinant corresponding to the term ( written as @ xmath100 in the [ appa2 ] ) in the middle of the equation @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 is defined to be @ xmath101 where @ xmath102 \ left[ \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { + , \ uparrow , + } } { \ eta _ { + , \ downarrow , - } } - \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { - , \ uparrow , + } } { \ eta _ { - , \ downarrow , - } } \ right ] - \ \ \ nonumber ( - - 1 ) \ left [ \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { + , \ uparrow , - } } { \ eta _ { + , \ downarrow , + } } - \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { - , \ uparrow , + } } { \ eta _ { - , \ downarrow , - } } \ right ] \ left [ \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { - , \ uparrow , - } } { \ eta _ { - , \ downarrow , + } } - \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { + , \ uparrow , + } } { \ eta _ { + , \ downar##row , - } } \ } ] . \ label { energy0 } \ label { aligned } \ ] ] setting this expression to zero one gets the formula to calculate the energy spectrum @ xcite . note that the first two equations have the same expression with the spin numbers going back to @ xmath103 . it is easy to see that the condition to find the andreev steady state energy in this case , where @ xmath82 has no @ xmath94 states , is satisfied by equating @ xmath104 to 0 . in order to get the same expression for the energy spectrum @ xmath97 and @ xmath98 we write . . ( [ sch ] ) for finite @ xmath58 , @ xmath3 and @ xmath2 as @ xmath105 . . ( [ sch1 ] ) . . ( [ sch4 ] ) allows us to calculate all the ratios @ xmath106 , @ xmath107 , and @ xmath108 , @ xmath109 . finally , we see that since the ratio @ xmath110 has a -and for @ xmath111 . we shall return to this case below . first , we note from fig . ( [ sch1 ] ) . . ( [ sch4 ] ) that the solutions of these equations for @ xmath30 and @ xmath33 are completely removed . writing the wave function of @ xmath112 in the second basis one gets @ xmath113 the two ratios that appear on the left - side of fig . [ dagup - up ] . . [ spin - up ] can be expressed as follows . the ratio @ xmath106 corresponds to the amplitude of the andreev reflection channel which represents reflection of an electron - like quasiparticle to a hole - like particle with opposite orientation on the p - n interface . in contrast , the ratio @ xmath114 which is finite only in the presence of soi and / or magnetic field , represents amplitude of andreev reflection channel where the electron - like quasiparticle incident on the interface is reflected to a hole - like quasiparticle incident with the opposite spin orientation . finally , the ratio @ xmath115 represents the maximum reflection channel of an electron -a particle crosses the boundary without creation of a spin pair in a superconducting part of the boundary . since these terms enter the expressions of @ xmath116 , these also include andreev and landau terms , involving electron - like and hole - like particles in the same ( @ xmath117 ) and same ( @ xmath118 ) boundary regions . we note that the distribution of wavefunctions in eq . ( [ dagup - up ] ) depends on both @ xmath30 and @ xmath33 while those in fig . ( [ dagup - down ] ) and ( [ up - down ] ) depend on either @ xmath33 or @ xmath30 . this means that the ratios ( [ dagup - up ] ) and ( [ dagup - down ] ) are responsible for the dependence of observable ##s on the order n of difference @ xmath33 , whereas the ratios ( [ dagup - down ] ) and ( [ up - down ] ) are responsible for the dependence on the magnetic field strength of @ xmath30 . the ratios @ xmath119 and @ xmath##120 is derived from eqs . ( [ sch1 ] ) - ( [ sch4 ] ) - @ xmath121 where the second ( negative ) term @ xmath122 ( @ xmath123 ) corresponds to : @ xmath124 ( @ xmath125 ) . from q . ( [ f - up - down ] ) , one gets , after a few minutes of work , the results for @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 for : @ xmath5 , @ xmath3 and @ xmath2 . @ xmath128 ^ 2 \ nonumber \ \ & & - 4d | \ delta | ^ 2 ( e ^ 2 + \ alpha ^ 2 k ^ 2 ) ^ 2 \ \ ^ { \ frac { \ varphi } { \ } \ { \ } ( | \ delta | ^ 2 ( e ^ 2 + \ alpha ^ 2 k ^ 2 ) ^ 2 ) ^ { - 1 } , \ { { f - up - down } \ nonumber \ \ \ { { \ } \ ] ] , @ xmath129 the contribution to the spin field equation is :from expression of @ xmath130 , and , these ratios are . by setting @ xmath131 ( q . ( [ f - up - down ] ) ) to , and using the expressions ( [ e000 ] ) and ( [ k000 ] ) for the energy and momentum in this limit , one gets the expression for the bound state energy in consistent with kwon _ et ##h _ . , @ xcite , @ xmath132 . our paper uses the best known expression in the literature in this limit . in the presence of the magnetic fields a contribution to the bound state due to soi comes from the _ _ _ andreev reflection of electron - like and hole - like states with opposite spins . these can be expressed as @ xmath133 where @ xmath134 can be obtained using q . [ f - up - down ] and [ energy0 ] . in general , the main electron spin in the presence of the magnetic fields constitutes an electron - like quasiparticle with a given spin , with andreev reflection to a hole - like quasiparticle , with the same spin . the contribution to the bound state comes from thisthis is @ xmath135 where @ xmath136 is determined by @ xmath137 we find that @ xmath138 ( = @ xmath139 ) . net . ( [ feqss ] ) is determined from net . ( [ energy0 ] ) by replacing the term @ xmath140 in @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 . the result for @ xmath114 can be obtained from net .

[ alpha _ d - dep ] . our work allows for two possible future applications . first , a numerical solution of the condition @ xmath320 yielding andreev bound state energies in the case where @ xmath321 will lead to a better understanding of the interplay of these parameters to understand the distribution of the bound state energies . second , the formalism that wesecond here to be applied to systems of strong @ xmath2 where the presence of unconventional bound states explains the characteristics of the josephson current . finally , our formalism may be applied to systems where the superconducting pair - potential is unconventional ( for example p - type ) ; indeed , interplay of these unconventional pair - potentials and so coupling may lead to additional interesting characteristics in the josepshon system . we hope to explore these phenomena in future research . in particular , we have studied josephson effect in the unction of two 1d nanowires in the presence of soi and si junctions . we have studied the josephson current in these junctions and obtained analytical results of the andreev bound states in several experimental cases . we have also demonstrated the presence of anti - josephson effect in these junctions and studied the shapiro - width of the josephson effect and the soi strength . our theoretical results are shown to be confirmed by the experiments with these systems . the authors invited v . osipov for discussion of this paper and others . the reported study was funded jointly by azerbaijan - jinr foundation , the science development foundation of the president of the republic azerbaijan - grant - eif - ketpl - e -2015 - 1 ( 1 ) - 1 / 01 / 1 , the rfbr refers to the research papers 165245011 @ xmath322india , 155161011 @ xmath322egypt , 152901217 and dst - rfbr 2015 . the expression @ xmath323 for the energy spectrum of * @ xmath324 where @ xmath325 , @ xmath326 , @ xmath327 , and @ xmath328 . calculation of this expression for the energy spectrum of the ` ` ' ' ' @ xmath329 superconductor @ xmath330 this expression is a change in the term , which is the result of the interaction of @ xmath16 and the external magnetic field of the soi @ xmath331 . we have different special cases below . * * the case of * @ xmath332 . the energy spectrum of @ xmath333 the energy spectrum of bdg * - electrons are in the plane , symmetrical to the metal surface , with * @ xmath334 * * the case of * @ xmath172 , * @xmath197 and @ xmath195 . the energy spectrum ( [ eo ] ) in this limiting case is factorized @ xmath335 \ left [ ( e - 1 ) ^ 2 + ( v _ f + \ delta ) ^ 2k ^ 2 - | \ delta | ^ 2 \ right ] = 0 . \ { { e100 } \ ] ] one has for the single - electron of @ xmath336 where @ xmath163 . the energies are split by @ xmath337 soi and / or the factor @ xmath3 splits the electron and proton energies due to rashba ##k - splitting and / or neutron splitting . the fermi energies of @ xmath338 and @ xmath339 are split also due to these conditions . * * the energies of * @ xmath153 , and @ xmath340 , @ xmath197 . the ( [ eo ] ) under these conditions is @ xmath341 \ left [ \ { ( e - \ sqrt { e ^ 2 + a ^ 2 } \ right ) ^ 2 + v _ f ^ 2k ^ 2 - | \ delta| ^ [ \ right ] = [ , \ ] ] gives the following expression for the energy of @ xmath342 the states at the critical points @ xmath338 and @ xmath339 and at @ xmath343 the expressions for the energy and momentum of the regions of @ xmath153 , @ xmath111 , @ xmath197 or of @ xmath153 , @ xmath194 and @ xmath344 are easily obtained from ( [ e011 ] ) and ( [ k011 ] ) . note that a new superconducting gas phase is obtained when @ xmath345 is replaced with a . @ xcite . in this section , we work on the expression for @ xmath82 . transforming the wave functions ( [ boundary ] ) into the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) one finds the linear differential equations for @ xmath76 , @ xmath77 , @ xmath78 , and @ xmath79 with @ xmath80 ##0 as in the main section . we can write these equations in terms of the @ xmath346hence @ xmath82 and the inverse of @ xmath347 as @ xmath84 . the inverse of the andreev energy matrix can also be obtained from @ xmath348 . the expression for the matrix @ xmath82 , obtained from numerical linear algebra , is given by @ xmath349 where @ xmath350 and @ xmath351 are values @ xmath352 . we note that it is difficult to obtain the inverse of @ xmath353 for general values of @ xmath58 , @ xmath2 and @ xmath3 . however , the physical content of the physical terms in this equation can be summarized as follows . we define the matrices of the selected values of @ xmath82 as @ xmath354 , @ xmath355 , @ xmath356 , @ xmath357 . if we define the @ xmath358 and @ xmath359 the determinants of these matrices are denoted by @ xmath360 and @ xmath361 . thus we can also obtain expressions for @ xmath362 and @ xmat##h363 . note that all these blocks are interpreted to refer to a single physical state as explained in the main text . all of these blocks are the basis of the andreev bound states as given in fig .
