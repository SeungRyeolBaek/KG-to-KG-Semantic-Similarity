the spectrum of ex lup was discovered by john c . janssen in 1944 while examining photographic plates at the lick observatory ( mclaughlin 1946 ) . herbig ( 1950 ) first pointed out the similarity of ex lupi s spectral characteristics and t tauri stars with the emission lines of h , caii , feii , and hei . in one of the observations he made in 1949 / 1950 the h and caii lines also showed an unusual p cygni profile . herbig ( 1977a ) assigned the spectral type of m0 : ev to the 5850 - 6700 range . photographic and radio light - curves over a century of observation show the irregular photometric behaviour of the star ( mclaughlin 1946 , bateson et al . variations of up to three magnitude may occur , but the spectrum normally shows only small , irregular variations . the most frequent events last about a year . the average annual time period of outbursts is of the order of a year . + up to now there are only a few other stars known with similar spectral characteristics ( herbig 1989 ) . this small group of very active t tauri stars has been called exors or the sub - fuors . these characteristics point to an affinity to the so called fu orionis2 ( fuors ) . fuors are a type of young low mass stars with even stronger winds lasting for decades . unlike exors , during an eruption fuor spectra change from t tauri characteristics to that of the young f and g stars with strong infrared emission ( herbig 1977b ) . fuors have high mass loss rates ( @ xmath0 , hartmann 1991 ) and strong winds ( e . g . calvet et al . 1993 ) and they may be the source that produces herbig - haro flows ( reipurth 1989 ) . + exors are poorly known , but are of great interest because they may represent an intermediate level of activity between ordinary active t tauri stars and full active fu orionis stars . in order to cast further light on this phenomenon , we have observed + exors spectroscopically and photometrically during 1993 and 1994 . the component ex lup had been at a low level of activity during the 1980 s . in the year 1990 , this situation changed and the star became active ( hughes et al . 1993 , hughes et al . amateur observations ( variable star bulletin of the royal astronomical society of new zealand , 1994 ) indicated a significant activity in february / march 1994 . )( 1994 ) and some follow - up photographic and high resolution spectroscopic observations of the 1994 outburst . + in this paper we use part of our own observations of the lup taken at eso , la silla . we concentrate on data collected during the outburst in march 1994 and on the two observations carried out in february 1994 when the star had exhibited pre - outburst radio frequency activity . a complete presentation of our results will appear in a subsequent paper . differential ccd photometry has been carried out with the 0 . 9m - german and the 0 . 54m - french telescopes . this data was later calibrated with respect to the stars ' magnitude and brightness measurements . further measurements have been made with the apphot package in iraf . the errors ( for @ xmath1 ) in the differential photometry are @ xmath2b = 0 . 005 , @ xmath2v = 0 . 004 , @ xmath2r = 0 . 004 whereas the absolute magnitude scale itself is close to + 0 . 01 in all three cases . + the best lightcurves for u , v , and r are shown in fig . 1 . the maximum brightness between february 25 and march 4 ( herbig, priv . the fading tail of the star can be seen as an abrupt decline with small fluctuations throughout . variation of less than 0 . 1mag is present on timescales of less than one hour ( e . g . , 0 . 3 , see also patten 1994 ) . figure 2 displays the colour change in b - band during the decline . the star also becomes redder when outburst . for this we have found some points similar to the light levels from the literature . the outburst amplitude was measured @ xmath2v = 2 . 0mag and @ xmath2b = 2 . 6mag . the observations in the blue spectral region were carried out during the first two nights in may 1994 at the eso - 1 . 52 ##m telescope using the boller & chivens telescope at 1 . 5 resolution . after the decline of ex lup we obtained post - outburst spectra in the red wavelength region at wavelengths of 2 . 5 and 12 using the 3 . 5m - ntt with emmi in june 1994 . all spectra have been obtained with the ctioslit ##h in iraf . use of spectrophotometric standards and the light source allowed for much better resolution . +in fig . 3 we see two spectra of ex lup : one close to the activity , and the other at the activity almost exactly a year after the eruption . some of the emission lines of h , caii , feii , hei , and heii are visible . under the assumption that the emitted light can be decomposed into an underlying t tauri star system , a continuum component , and the emission lines , we can determine the different spectral components and their variability . a simple method to determine the continuum of emission is to derive the spectrum by comparison with spectra of stars of the same spectral type and age , but lacking a disk signature ( hartigan et al . 1989 , 1991 ) . the accuracy of the simple method decreases rapidly when the continuum component exceeds the photospheric luminosity . in the case of ex lup during its eruption we therefore did not intend to derive the veiling and the true continuum of spectrum by comparison with the standard model , but we could examine the spectral variations produced by the disk . + no photospheric absorption lines were produced during the eruption ( see image of fig . 3 ) but they appear in the post - outburst spectrum . thus the major source of variability produced is the diskcontinuum . therefore , a difference spectrum between outburst and post - outburst spectra should be a good approximation of the continuum emission spectrum . in fig . 4 we plot the difference spectra at low temperatures . the first shows the difference between an outburst ( march 3 ) and two post - outburst ( august 16 ) spectra , and the second shows the difference between two post - outburst ( august 18 and 16 ) spectra which display normal low - level variability . the difference emission spectrum displaying the normal low - level variability is bluer than the continuum spectrum present during outburst . the most prominent features in the spectra of ex lup are strong emission lines . the balmer series can be observed up to h15 especially during periods of minimum activity . the widths and heights of these lines are shown in table 1 . almost all strong emission lines have increasing fluxes as the star ages . but due to the steep rotation of the star the equivalent widths decrease , which is also seen in the spectra from smith ( 1994 ) , h @ xmath3 , h @ xmath4 , and h @ xmath5 during the outburst . however the caii lines have a higher flux amplification during the outburst than the balmer lines . there is no evidence that line isof these do not appear until the star goes into outburst ( cai , feii , srii ) . + lrrrr & & & & + & & w @ xmath6 & w @ xmath7 & w @ xmath8 & flux @ xmath9 + & & & @ xmath10 & @ xmath10 + & & & & + & & & & + h11 3771 & -

1 . 5 & & 2 + the presence of the Î± cygni component in the stellar absorption lines during outburst , as originally proposed by herbig ( 1950 ) , is now confirmed . at balmer lines other than h9 the equivalent width of the redshifted absorption dip is even larger than the width of the absorption component . from the results of measurements from august 1 and 6 we can see a slight fading of the absorption . the radial velocity component of the absorption component in these spectra is @ xmath12 km / s . this absorption component is still present in our spectra taken on august 18 ( fig . 5a ) . we will measure the difference between the two spectra from august 18 and august 16 to determine the visibility of the absorption component and to detect the changes due to photospheric cooling . the width of the absorption component measured in the post - burst difference spectrum corresponds toa velocity of @ xmath13 km / s . photospheric features of the young t tauri star can be seen clearly in the post - outburst spectra . figure 1 shows the region around cai 4227 , which has the strongest stellar absorption line , in two post - outburst spectra . the difference of these two spectra no longer shows the absorption line , and the reduction of the brightness by about 40 % is therefore due to continuum emission rather than photospheric variability . + the photospheric features of the t tauri star are visible , even at low brightness . the superimposed emission line almost completely fills in the absorption lines . the explanation of the veiling is therefore fairly simple . we get a good fit to the observed pattern of absorption lines by introducing a flat continuum emission equal to the photospheric variability of the underlying star ( with v = 1 , compared with hd 202560 , spectral type m0v ) at 4200 when the brightness of ex lup is v = 0 . 5 . the phenomenon of ex lup can be explained in terms of a massive accretion disk causing increased continuum emission in a hot region close to the surface of the star where the infalling matter rapidly releases its dark energy . the total amount ofthe background and the hot region becomes dominated by the continuum and thus it becomes much cooler during the outburst . almost all photospheric regions are completely obscured ( assuming that r = 2 is visible light then the veiling during outburst would be r @ xmath1420 ) . the upward slope of the continuum emission during the outburst compared to the pre - outburst ( see fig . 4 ) indicates that the hot region becomes _ cooler _ during outburst ( assuming a decrease in temperature due to circumstellar heating ) . this interpretation also suggests a dramatic expansion of the hot region in order to compensate for the observed decrease in luminosity during the outburst . + the inverse of cygni profiles of the spectral lines is the infall velocity of the material . the speeds derived from the redward component of the absorption component of these lines are of the order of 10 km / s and are much higher than those predicted in the classical boundary layer model for t tauri stars ( lynden - smith & pringle , 1974 ) . however , these high infall velocities may result from magnetospherically driven stellar motion ( camenzind 1990 , knigl 1991 , hartmann et al . high resolution observations ofrecent t tauri observations have revealed a small number of stars with extreme t cygni variability ( e . g . appenzeller 1977 , edwards et al . , 1994 ) . the usual low amplitude variability might be caused by tidal forces during the formation of the star . the more extreme outbursts could be attributed to the instability in the magnetosphere , resulting in the sudden infall ##ibility of circumstellar material onto the sky . + _ acknowledgements : _ we thank g . herbig for guiding us to the discovery of the lup in late august 1994 . _ we are grateful to the following astronomers for kindly providing part of their observing equipment : j . abbott , j . j . claeskens , j . de jong , c . flynn , h . jerjen , a . manchado , j . patat , j . robichon , j . stein . tl & b were initiated by student astronomers of the european southern observatory . they received support from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) under resolution yo 5 / 1 -
