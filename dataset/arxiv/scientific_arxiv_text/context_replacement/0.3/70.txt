x - ray studies of " normal " galaxies , with high - energy emission lines and dominated by a luminous active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , have now been extended to cosmologically significant galaxies in the near field ( cdf ) surveys , which have now reached 1 cm of depth ( cdf - n : hornschemeier et al . 2001 , in paper ii ; brandt et al . 2001b , in paper v ; cdf - s : tozzi et al . 2001 ; g . rosati et al . , in prep . ) . galaxies with @ xmath8 are detected in appreciable abundance at 0 . 52 kev and with @ xmath9 , @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 ( e . g . , paper i ) ; the cdf - n survey goes about two orders of magnitude further , finding significant numbers of normal galaxies among the population of x - ray galaxies in the diffuse x - ray belt ( xrb ; paper ii ; a . j . barger et al . , in prep . ) . these normal galaxies contribute as much as 510 % of the xrb flux in the 0 . 5 kev range . the rest of the total fluxof the xrb is largely dominated by agn , but the nature of the typical " galaxy , whether the x - ray population is dominated by a variety of x - ray sources , hot molecular gas , or even a low - luminosity agn , is an increasingly important function of deep x - ray surveys . normal galaxies are expected to be the most abundant " x - ray sources in the universe and are expected to dominate the number " at 0 . 1 kev fluxes of @ xmath10 @ xmath11 and @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 ( ptak et al . 2001 ) . the cdf - 1 has reached the depths necessary to detect the " closest [ @ xmath12 ; @ xmath13 is from 0 . 52 kev ] @ xmath14 galaxies to @ xmath15 , corresponding to a look - back time of @ xmath16 gyr ( @ xmath17 km s @ xmath7 mpc @ xmath7 , @ xmath18 , and @ xmath19 are included in this list ) . reaching larger look - back times opens the exciting possibility of detecting the same x - ray sources tothe highest star - formation rate at @ xmath203 ( e . g . , madau et al . 1996 ) . one thus expects the x - ray emission per unit @ xmath2 - band luminosity to be highest at @ xmath211 in the future due to the increased population density of x - ray binary stars at @ xmath203 ; this x - ray emission " provides direct evidence " of past epochs of star formation ( e . g . , ghosh & singh 2001 ; ptak et al . therefore , measurements of the x - ray emission of individual galaxies can constrain models of x - ray binary stars in galaxies . while x - ray emission from individual galaxies is not easily detected at @ xmath22 , it is possible to detect the sources at their very high flux levels using statistical methods such as averaging , a technique used successfully in the cdf - n ##d data in several recent studies . these include the detection of x - ray emission from the single @ xmath21 bright ( @ xmath23 ) galaxy in the galaxy deep field - survey ( ) described by brandt et al . ( 2001a , hereafter section iv ) and astudy of x - ray emission from @ xmath244 lyman source was identified in the ( cohen et al . 2001c , hereafter paper vii ) . encouraged by the success of these studies , we extend from the study of normal galaxies to the entire dark - matter area , now focusing on galaxies in @ xmath25 to complement the study of @ xmath26 ##4 mentioned in paper vii . we focus on this broad region due to the extensive galaxy data coverage ( cohen et al . 2000 and discussed below ) and superb imaging which has allowed a comprehensive galaxy structure study ( van den bergh , cohen , & crabbe 2001 ) . the cdf - n data has extremely good x - ray coverage over this region ( see section 7 of paper vii for the # ##s of this region ) ; the point - source detection limits for this region of the cdf - n data in the 0 . 52 kev and 28 kev range are @ xmath27 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 and @ xmath28 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 , respectively . in this study , we set further limits on the determination of the ratio ofx - ray ratio to @ xmath2 - the ratio of 12 " spiral galaxies relative to @ xmath29 ; this ratio is an indicator of the high level of star formation in the galaxy ( e . g . , david , smith , & forman 1992 ; smith et al . we also have data on the fraction of the observed xrb produced by galaxies located just outside the cdf - # ##d ) , and thus the contribution to the xrb by these galaxies . the redshifts for the range are drawn from the catalogs of cohen et al . ( 2000 ) , cohen ( 2001 ) , and cohen et al . ( 2001 ) for the range @ xmath30 . accurate distance determination is difficult in the range @ xmath31 due to the absence of bright features in the free - frame optical band and the absence of the lyman alpha signal used to detect high mass objects . we have therefore used the deep photometric redshift catalog of fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil ( 1999 ) for the redshift range @ xmath32 , which allows for overlap in redshift ##s with the other .for cross - section . the two catalogs cover the entire hdf - n plus a substantial portion of the flanking fields area , whereas the first catalog only covers the hdf - n . we shall refer to these two samples as the " optical " and the photometric sample " for the rest of this article . for the optical sample , the @ xmath33 - 2 magnitude is used to filter the sources ' peak luminosity , as this is best suited to rest - mass @ xmath2 over most of the redshift ##s under consideration here . the @ xmath33 values are those given by barger et al . ( 1999 ) for the entire flanking fields area . for the optical sample , the f814w ( and @ xmath34 ) measurements of fernndez - soto et al . ( 1999 ) were used . we chose sources which had an x - ray intensity of only in the 0 . 25 kev ( full ) , 0 . 52 kev ( soft ) and 1 kev ( soft ) bands corresponding to the wavdetect ( smith et al . 2002 ) detection threshold of @ xmath35 in the full acis spectral set ofpaper vi . this low detection limit means that our study does not include sources with x - ray wavelengths well below the high detection limit of paper v . we have attempted to create a sample of galaxies similar to the galaxies in the early catalog . to accomplish this , we have used the morphological classification of van den bergh et al . ( 2001 ) for galaxies from @ xmath36 to the hdf - 1 and the nearby fields . to simplify the morphological filtering , we have cast galaxies in the van den bergh et al . ( 2001 ) catalog into the following four classes : ( 1 ) e / s0 " and " " , ( 2 ) merger " , ( 3 ) peculiar " and " , including sub - spirals and spiral / irregulars , and ( 4 ) irr " , and " and / or " " . we have filtered the catalog to include the types ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . analyzing the resulting data is very difficult due to the faintness of some of the sources and also due to the problems with them . we have used the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) classifications of fernndez - soto et al . ( 2001 ) to include all galaxies of type " " . comparison of the four classesnote that , in the area covered by both , @ xmath37 70 % of objects identified in the sloan surveys are more distant . since the evolution of x - ray galaxies with distance is of interest , we have made an effort to find objects with different optical luminosities at different wavelengths . this is especially important due to the non - linear relationship between x - ray intensity and @ xmath2 - band luminosity for some types of elliptical galaxies ( @ xmath38 ; e . g . fabbiano & wilson 2001 ) . using the value of @ xmath39 in the @ xmath40 - band as calculated by blanton et al . ( 2001 ) for a large number of galaxies in the sloan all sky survey , we obtain the value of @ xmath39 in the @ xmath2 - band . the sloan value @ xmath40 is then matched to @ xmath2 ; the corresponding value of @ xmath39 in the @ xmath2 band is @ xmath41 . to ensure that our results are not sensitively dependent upon the actual sed used to determine the galaxy parameters , we have used both the sloan andsuper - seds of poggianti et al . ( 1997 ) to calculate @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 vs . @ xmath42 for an @ xmath39 galaxy using the statistical software called synphot in iraf . these results are shown in the [ sub _ definition ] . note the close relationship between the sa and sc bands ; this is because the @ xmath33 band corresponds to half - frame @ xmath2 in the middle of our redshift range . also shown in figure 1 are the 151 galaxies in the spectroscopic sample with spiral - merger classification having @ xmath43 and the 651 galaxies in the photometric sample with sed class other than sa " having @ xmath44 . these samples were estimated by light flux to lie within 0 . 5 mags of the @ xmath39 galaxy as discussed above ; the two samples , assuming sa and sc seds were identical ( or nearly identical ) for all redshifts up to @ xmath45 . galaxies meeting the high magnitude criteria were then divided by distance into two bins ; these bins were constructed to ensure that there were @ xmath46 galaxies per bin . thenumber of galaxies , median redshift , median look - back , and average optical magnitude for each bin are listed in table 1 . in figure 1 , we mark all the galaxies in the chandra sed sample with colors from the different redshift bins . table 1 also includes the number of galaxies removed from the same bin due to the lack of an x - ray source within 40 ; this matching radius ensures that our results will not be adversely affected by the wings of the psf of very bright x - ray sources . these galaxies satisfied both the optical magnitude and morphology filtering criteria and were removed only due to x - ray detection . this exclusion radius is very conservative , however , so that our model is accurate to @ xmath476 for the galaxies under consideration ( see paper iii ) . to allow for the off - axis detection of some of the x - ray sources found in these galaxies ( e . g . , paper iv ) , we consider galaxies to be very confident x - ray sources if the x - ray source is within 15 of the galaxy center . this matching radius is also well matched to the chandra model . off - axis for 0 . 55 kev and the 95 % encircled - energy limit for 0 . 5 ke##v . ] we will also give the number of galaxies having an x - ray detection within range in table 1 . the x - ray detection ##s at each band were stacked in the same manner as in paper vii , for the 30 galaxies whose centers fall within an aperture of about 15 . the detection significance in each band was assessed by performing 100 , 000 monte - carlo stacking studies of local background regions described in paper vii . the detection is considered to be significantly significant if the number of observations over background exceeds that of 99 . 99 % of the population . no single source of the stacking process appears to affect the distribution , demonstrating the effectiveness of our selection process . all of the galaxies in the sample bins described in table [ sample _ table ] and figure [ sample _ table ] resulted in significant detection in the same way for all of the redshift groups up to @ xmath48 ( see figure 2 ) . we also stacked galaxies in the redshift bin @ xmath49 , but there was not a significant detection . the images for the three different x - sed groups were identical or exactly identical except for the detection in the highest density bin ( @ xmath50 ) . we adopt the @ xmat##h51 power values for the distribution of x - ray fluxes and luminosities , assuming that these sources are similar to spiral galaxies in the local region and have their x - ray spectra dominated by x - ray binaries ( e . g . , kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1992 ) . while there were several cases of significant detections in the soft band , there were no other significant detections in the hard band . given the distribution of effective noise and decay rate with time , the signal - to - noise ratio for sources with the same spectrum is highest in the soft band and lowest in the hard band , and this result is expected . the flux level of the soft - band detections for the spectroscopic sample is ( 56 ) @ xmath52 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 . the corresponding rest - frame 0 . 52 kev value for the spiral galaxy is @ xmath53 er s @ xmath7 for the lowest flux bin and @ xmath54 er s @ xmath7 for the highest flux bin . for the photometric sample , the hard - band flux level of the detector is ( 56 ) @xmath52 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 . we also give fluxes for the most significant sources in the sample range for those redshift ##s having highly significant soft - band emission . we have listed the properties of the sources which were rejected from the stacking samples prior to the x - ray detection at or near the position of the galaxy ( the numbers of rejected sources are shown in the first column of table 1 ) . there are only 15 distinct galaxies with x - ray detections within us . of these 15 galaxies , three have broad - line agn , which are therefore not normal galaxies . one object has a measured brightness which differs significantly from its measured redshift . since the observed properties of this object at its measured redshift place it outside our sample range , we have rejected it . one object is very near another x - ray source which has been positively identified with a narrow - line agn . therefore , there are a total of " 5 " galaxies positively identified with x - ray sources in this table , consituting a small minority of the galaxies under consideration here . the worst case is in the lowest redshift , where 15 % of the galaxies hadx - ray detected . figure [ sbhistogram ] shows a set of @ xmath55 values calculated for both the stacking galaxies and the individually x - ray detected galaxies . the individually x - ray detected data set does possibly include the lower - luminosity agn , not the agn itself ( see papers iii and iv ) . with the exception of the objects in the sample bin with the @ xmath56 , figure [ sbhistogram ] shows that typically the x - ray luminosities of the individually detected galaxies are on average much higher than those of the stacked galaxies ; they are sufficiently more luminous as to be part of the total galaxy population . for the lowest redshift bin , it is plausible that our results are more accurate with the exclusion of the x - ray detected objects . in addition , we may also have results which include the individually x - ray detected galaxies in the sample average for this lowest redshift bin . for further comparison , we have compared the radio properties of the individually detected galaxies and the stacked galaxies with the results of smith et al . ( 1998 ) and smith ( 2000 ) . the percentage of radio properties among the individually x - ray detected galaxies is approximatelythan that among the stacked samples ( @ xmath57 % vs . @ xmath585 % ) . this possible difference between the two samples is significant at the 93 % level as determined by the fisher information probability test for two stacked samples ( see siegel & castellan 1988 ) . due to the x - ray luminosity ratio and possible differences in optical emissions , and to the fact that these objects constitute a small fraction of those under study , we are confident we have not biased our determination of the sensitivity of the observed galaxies by omitting these x - ray detected objects from further study . in figure [ lxlb ] a , we calculated the x - ray - to - gamma sensitivity ratio @ xmath59 for each stacked sample , where @ xmath13 is used for the in - frame 0 . 52 kev band . we have also calculated our approximate sensitivity limit in figure [ lxlb ] b , which is approximately the unit @ xmath60 x - ray - sensitivity limit , for the 30 % stacking analysis divided by @ xmath61 . we do not expect to find galaxies with less x - ray emission per unit @ xmath2 - band taken than this limit .for comparison with the local universe , we can plot the average @ xmath59 for the galaxies of comparable @ xmath62 from the sample of brown et al . this sample includes 234 spiral galaxies observed with _ x _ and _ agn where the x - ray emission is more dominated by the sun . the galaxies in the brown et al . ( 2001 ) sample all have @ xmath63 ; median value is @ xmath64 . in figure [ lxlb ] b , we plot @ xmath59 versus @ xmath65 ; the values up to @ xmath66 are consistent with what is observed in the shapley et al . sample for galaxies with comparable @ xmath65 , although they are toward the lower end of what is observed . this is consistent with figure [ lxlb ] c , which shows the average @ xmath59 resulting from this being slightly higher than that for the brown et al . sample of comparable sample size . there is a slight decrease ( factor of 0 . 5 ) in the average @ xmath67 from the local universe to @ xmath68 . for the median redshift ,( @ xmath50 ) , the model become more sensitive to the galaxy sed it uses for all the optical observations . we find that the average galaxy sed is more accurate for this epoch due to the greater rate of star formation . for this sed , we find that @ xmath69 has increased somewhat more rapidly ( @ xmath70 times ) than @ xmath50 . we may also constrain star - formation models using only the x - ray intensity of these galaxies . the average x - ray intensity of the two galaxies in the shapley et al . ( 2001 ) sample having the same value of @ xmath65 times used in this study is @ xmath71 / / @ xmath7 ( converted to 1 . 5 kev ) . the average galaxy in our stacking sample has a value @ xmath72 times higher at @ xmath68 . this corresponds to @ xmath73 times higher at @ xmath74 . the @ xmath68 value is most likely influenced by other factors due to the number of other candidate galaxies in the lowest range ##s ( figure 3 ) . if we include these galaxiesx - ray observed objects , then the first galaxy in our stacking sample has a luminosity @ xmath75 times higher at @ xmath68 , consistent with the prediction of ghosh & white ( 2001 ) that the x - ray emission of the first pre - sbc spiral galaxy should be @ xmath75 times higher at @ xmath76 . counting the x - ray detected objects does not significantly affect our results for the interval @ xmath77 ( the difference is @ xmath78 % ) . however , since the x - ray emission of the x - ray detected objects with @ xmath74 are substantially higher ( by an order of magnitude ) than the x - ray observed objects ( see figure 2 ) , it is not appropriate to include these objects in the calculation of the average x - ray luminosity . we also observe a significant increase in the average x - ray emission of galaxies with @ xmath79 than the increase by a factor of @ xmath80 predicted by ghosh & white ( 2001 ) . we conclude that the average x - ray luminosities of galaxies have not increased upward by more than a factor of@ xmath73 s @ xmath74 , regardless of type or inclusion of x - ray source objects . the range of average 0 . 52 kev flux for the spiral galaxies studied here is ( @ xmath46 @ xmath5 erg @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 . these x - ray spectra are consistent with independent predictions made by ptak et al . ( 2001 ) that galaxies of this type could be detected with 0 . 52 kev flux ##es of @ xmath81 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 ( converted from their 210 kev prediction to an @ xmath82 power factor ) . assuming a 0 . 52 kev xrb flux ##es of @ xmath83 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 deg @ xmath84 ( garmire et al . 2001 ) , we have detected @ xmath85 % of the observed xrb as observed from spiral galaxies not yet individually detected in deep space . many of these objects should be sufficently able to be detected with acis flux of @ xmath86 % , which should be sufficientfor the last several days of the project . we thank alice smith for our helpful and useful data . we also acknowledge the financial support of nasa grant nas ##t - 38252 ( gpg , pi ) , nasa gsrp grant ngt5 - 50247 ( aeh ) , nsf grant award ast - 9983783 ( wnb , dma , doe ) , and nasa grant ast99 - 00703 ( doe ) . this mission would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of the entire team . ccccccc + 0 . 500 . 00 & sc & 0 . 635 & 6 . 1 & 8 . 1 & 3 & 3 / 4 + 0 . 750 . 00 & sc & 0 . 821 & 0 . 83 & 7 . 83 & 38 & 3 / 4 + 0 . 901 . 00 & sc & 0 . 960 & 22 . 05 & 22 . 05 & 37 & 3 / 4 + + + 0 . 501 . 00 & sc & 0 . 920 & 7 . 03 & 22 . 05 & 37 & 3 / 4 + 0 . 001 . 50 & sc & 0 . 95 & 1 . 99 & 8 . 1 & 2 & 3 / 4+ 1 . 001 . 0 & sc & 1 . 240 & 10 . 09 & 10 . 0 & sc & 8 / 8 + rrrrrrrrrcrrc + 0 . 400 . 0 & sc & 99 . 0 & 99 . 0 & 99 . 0 & @ xmath87 & 0 . 41 & 0 . 0 & 0 . 60 & 0 . 75 & 2 . 5 & 0 . 68 & 0 . 75 + 0 . 750 . 0 & sc & 34 . 0 & 0 . 5 & @ xmath87 & @ xmath87 & 33 . 05 & 33 . 09 & 0 . 12 & 0 . 13 & 0 . 14 & 0 . 07 & 0 . 08 + 0 . 901 . 0 & sc & 54 . 0 & 0 . 5 & @ xmath87 & @ xmath87 & 26 . 0 & 1 . 0 & 1 . 47 & 0 . 51 & 8 . 44 & 0 . 75 & 0 . 75 + + + 0 . 501 . 00 & sc & 33 . 0 & 2 . 5 & 0 . 5 & @ xmath87 & 4 . 0 & 0 . 54 & 0 . 47 & 0 . 51 & 0 . 75 &0 . 40 & 1 . 0 + 1 . 001 . 50 & sa & 38 . 5 & 38 . 5 & 0 . 94 & @ xmath87 & 0 . 67 & 0 . 73 & 0 . 34 & 0 . 79 & 0 . 34 & 0 . 06 & 0 . 79 + 1 . 001 . 50 & sa & 34 . 6 & 34 . 2 & 98 . 5 & 99 . 5 & 0 . 61 & 0 . 22 & 0 . 22 & 0 . 23 & 0 . 25 & 0 . 81 & 0 . 81 + . the blue curves give @ xmath33 vs . @ xmath42 for @ xmath39 sa and sc galaxies ( the blue curve has higher # ##s for the sc galaxies ) . galaxies without a colored line were not included in the stacking list because they either were not in the range of optical luminosity , or because no x - ray detection was possible within them .
