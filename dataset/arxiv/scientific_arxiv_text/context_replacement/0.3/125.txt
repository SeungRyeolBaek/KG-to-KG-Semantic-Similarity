in our experiment , we start with an initial characterization of the qds and observe a significantly reduced spectral linewidth of the emitted photons from a resonantly - neutral qd coupled with incoherent rf methods including via above - bandgap and above - shell using cw lasers . the @ xmath3s2 ( 1 - b ) is a direct comparison of the spectral linewidth of the emitted photon from a single qd ( qd2 ) neutral exciton for the cw - driven rf method . at low power regime ( around threshold ) , the cw photoluminescence spectra arising from both band - gap and _ _ _ - band modulation yields a linewidth of @ xmath52 . 5ghz ( see fig . @ xmath3s2a ) and @ xmath51 . 5ghz ( fig . @ xmath3s2b ) , respectively . on the other hand , cw driven photons ( see fig . @ xmath3s2c ) yield a significantly reduced linewidth of @ xmath50 . 48ghz . at high power regime ( above saturation ( see @ xmat##h46 ) where the mollow frequency is @ xcite . figure @ xmath3s2d shows a range of cw rf spectra at high laser power . the decay time @ xmath47 = ( using the corrected eqn . ( 1 ) from fig . @ xcite ) from the cw rf spectra at @ xmath46 is due to be radiative - limited : @ xmath47 / @ xmath48 = 0 . 390 ( 6 ) , where @ xmath49 is the exciton frequency which is measured separately to that of 390 ( 6 ) ps in time - varying cw spectra . this is consistent with the fact that the w _ s _ - shell ##ing mode can produce dephasings associated with the incoherent excitation at @ xcite . a high - resolution cw rf spectrum from qd2 is shown in fig . @ xmath3s3 . for a range of laser power from 0 . 93 @ xmath0 to @ xmath0 pulse , we compare the rf spectra with the voigt profile to find the inhomogeneous ( n ) linewidth ( @ xmath##50 ) . as shown on the inset of fig . @ xmath3s3 , the @ xmath50 shows a increase and lower peak power , which is in good agreement with the investigations of light - induced thermal diffusion @ xcite . the @ xmath3s4a - b shows the peak of full intensity based on qd2 . one of five clusters occurs periodically with a period of @ xmath1112 . 5 ns . the central cluster shows an even higher rf count compared to the side clusters due to the single - crystal nature of the source . the hom clusters are tested with @ xmath0 , 0 . 72 @ xmath0 and 0 . 79 @ xmath0 pulse excitation where the rf counts are @ xmath6 @ xmath51 , @ xmath6 @ xmath52 and @ xmath6 @ xmath53 , ##s , and have the visibilities of 0 . 903 ( 56 ) , 0 . 912 ( 56 ) and 0 . 934 ( 56 ) , respectively ( see fig . @ xmath34 ( a - d ) ) . taking into account of the residualsingle - photon emission : for this qd , @ xmath54 , and the optical imperfections of our interferometric system ( such as in the previous article ) , we have the values of indistinguishability to be 0 . 956 ( 54 ) , 0 . 966 ( 59 ) , 0 . 989 ( 61 ) for the @ xmath0 , 0 . 59 @ xmath0 and 0 . 61 @ xmath0 states , respectively .
