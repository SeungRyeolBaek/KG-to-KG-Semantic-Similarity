polluted white dwarfs ( typed with a suffix ` ` z ' ' ) provide an opportunity to determine the future composition of these objects . although planets have not yet been detected around white dwarfs , the evidence for the presence of planetary debris around these objects is in their outer atmospheres . approximately one quarter of white dwarfs show the presence of elements heavier than hydrogen in their atmospheres @ xcite and about one quarter of these have a near - infrared ( mid ) excess that is consistent with a circumstellar , debris disc @ xcite . studies recently using the gamma ray camera on the _ hubble space telescope _ @ xcite have shown that about half of all white dwarfs with surface temperatures ranging from 17000 k to 27000 k have polluted atmosphere . several recent studies of the white dwarfs have revealed significant differences in the composition of the accreted material . based on a study of ultraviolet ( uv ) spectroscopy of a sample of white dwarfs ( 19000 < @ xmath0 ##2 ) , @ xcite showed that the abundance found in the accreted material is similar to that observed among solar system meteorites , although the effect of selective radiative radiation effects on decay rate distribution was neglected . @ xcite showed thatthe radiation effects on trace elements , silicon for example , shapes the abundance patterns in hot white dwarfs ( @ xmath1 k ) . after including this effect in their analysis , @ xcite concluded that at least 27 % of their white dwarf sample , which includes the @ xcite data , would be currently accreting , and in 20 % of these objects , being among the warmest in their sample , the effect of radiative levitation shapes the abundance pattern . the absence of this effect also leads to a reduction in the estimated accretion flow in some objects with @ xmath2 k ( e . g . , wd0431 + 126 ) . the analysis of infrared and ultraviolet spectra of two hot white dwarfs by @ xcite show the primary source to be of a rocky composition where the abundance of trace elements is enhanced compared to other elements . however , @ xcite found that the cool , iron - rich and rocky white dwarf nltt 43806 ( typed dazh ) is rich in aluminium but poor in silicon which suggests that the source material is similar to the surrounding material . this has been detected in hot white dwarfs ( e . g . , galex j1931 + 0117; * ? ? ? * ) , and , in some of these objects , the amount of oxygen with respect to the other heavier elements also suggests that the parent material contains significant amount of water . for example , in - 61 @ xcite found that the parent material contained oxygen in excess of the amount expected to be carried by the oxides , suggesting that the parent material contained water . a similar effect , but with a smaller amount of water , was found in the spectra of sdss j124231 . 07 @ xmath3522626 . 0 @ xcite . the material present in the core of a white dwarf is due to two processes : heavier elements are often mixed into the convective envelope of cool white dwarfs , and diffuse - out below the convection zone for a period of time much longer than diffusion timescales @ xcite . temperature measurements @ xcite of diffusion timescales suggest that signs of an evolutionary event are visible in the photosphere of a cool ( 6000 k ) hydrogen - rich white dwarf for several @ xmath4 years and much longer ( several @ xmath5 years ) for cool helium - rich white dwarfs . thus , the observed abundance would follow that of thethis composition , and the presence of heavy elements is highly transitory when compared to the average age of hot white dwarfs ( @ xmath6 ##8 ) . we present a spectroscopic and spectral analysis of the hitherto unknown hot , polluted white dwarf ( nltt 19868 ) from the revised nltt data of @ xcite . we provide details of the new observations in section 2 : we present new low - and high - dispersion spectra as well as new and archival photometric measurements used to create a surface energy map ( sed ) . in section 3 , we analyze our observed data and derive atmospheric parameters : temperature , atmospheric pressure , and humidity . then , in section 4 , we attempt to reconstruct the accretion history onto this data . then , we draw a comparison with the ages of hot white dwarfs highlighting the unusual photospheric composition of the cool white dwarf nltt 19868 , and , finally , we summarize our findings . we present new spectral and photometric measurements of the newly identified white dwarf nltt 19868 . we will observe nltt 19868 with the eso variable object spectrograph and camera ( efosc2 ) attached to the space technology telescope ( ntt) at la silla observatory on ut 2009 march 1 . using grism number 2 ( 2 lines / s ) with the slit - width set to 1 arcsec , we obtained a resolution of @ xmath7 . the two consecutive resolutions of 1800 s each revealed a hot daz white dwarf with strong h & v emission . we followed up on our initial results with three sets of echelle spectra of from the x - shooter spectrograph @ xcite ##r to the ut3 at paranal observatory on ut 2014 may 28 , 29 and june 1 . the slit - width was set to 0 . 5 , 0 . 5 and 0 . 5 arcsec for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively . this setup provided a resolving power of 9900 , 7450 and 7780 for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively . the resolution ##s for the uvb and vis arms were 2940 and 3000 s , respectively , and for the nir arm we obtained five resolutions of 600 s each . we used the same images from the efosc2 and x - shooter cameras to obtain resolutions of @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 and of nltt 19868 , respectively . finally , we used thethe discovery of nltt 19868 and of a second comparison star ( ra [ j2000 ] = 08h ##10 . 03 . 44s , ra [ j2000 ] = @ xmath101005525 ) with four measurements ( @ xmath11 mag , @ xmath12 mag , @ xmath13 mag , and @ xmath14 mag ) from the aavso chandra all - sky survey ( apass ) . apass is an all - sky survey , using three instruments ( johnson @ xmath15 and @ xmath9 , and sloan @ xmath16 , @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 ) with a magnitude range from about 10 up to 20 . we converted the sloan @ xmath17 magnitude to the johnson @ xmath8 magnitude using the following formula of lupton ( 2005 ) : [ multiblock error : ] @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 we calculated @ xmath8 using two instruments and used the difference of the two measurements ( @ xmath21 mag ) . finally , using the difference between the two magnitudes of nltt 19868 and the comparison star , we calculated @ xmath22mag and @ xmath23 mag for nltt 19868 . note that the uncertainties for @ xmath9 and @ xmath8 are statistical only and exclude any possible gravitational effects . we used ir ##i measurements from the 2 ##m infrared sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ? * ) and _ _ w _ _ ide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ; * ? ? ? the measurements which are available for the vega system are listed in the [ tbl _ phot ] . the @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 measurements are not listed because only lower limits were available for this measurement . we also examined the _ wise _ images in conjunction with our six - shooter @ xmath9 acquisition data . these images show that there is a nearby star 5 . 2 au away at a distance of p . a . = 107 @ xmath26 . the crowded star does not have the brown dwarf proper motion and , therefore , is not closely associated . assuming the proper motion of nltt 19868 the distance between the nearby star and nltt 19868 would have been 5 . 2 au at p . a . = 107 @ xmath26 at the time the _ wise _results were obtained ( 2010 ) . since the photon correlation functions ( pbs ) of @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 are 6 . 1 and 6 . 4 arcsec , respectively , the _ z _ z measurements listed in the [ tbl _ catalog ] should include both nltt 19868 and the nearby object . the degree of contamination is unknown since the spectral type of the nearby object is unknown , although the sed shows it to be a young object ( @ xmath29k ) . we have examined the 2mass images which show that nltt 19868 and the nearby object are well separated , and we conclude that the 2mass photometric measurements of nltt 19868 are not contaminated by the nearby object . the 2mass catalog did not show any flags that would suggest contamination with the @ xmath30 ##k . . spectroscopy and astrometry [ cols = " < , ^ , ^ " , options = " ^ " , ] # ##s of cool , very old white dwarfs attempt to determine the frequency of stellar debris at an advanced cooling stage , i . e . , long after the parent star leaves the main - sequence . however , because of the longer cooling timescales predicted for older starsrecently , these effects have become more apparent , especially during a discrete extinction event . in this case , the spread of diffusion timescales among a group of elements would lead to time - dependent changes to isotope ##s allowing for a better understanding of the chemical environment at the base of the transition zone ( see * ? ? ? * ) . the number of cool daz white dwarfs remains low compared to the number of their hot daz counterparts , compared to the hydrogen - rich dz white dwarfs . concentrating our attention on the hydrogen - rich objects will help determine whether their environment is similar to the other hot dzs . in this context , our study of the cool daz white dwarfs nltt 19868 and similar objects is important . nltt 19868 is among the hottest known daz white dwarfs . only three other daz white dwarfs have temperatures above 5500 k : g174 - 50 ( @ xmath31 k , @ xcite ) , nltt 10480 ( @ xmath32 k , @ xcite ) and g77 - 50 ( @ xmath33 k , @ xcite ) . the reference temperature adopted for g77 - 50 is the weighted average of the temperature measurements from @ xcite and @ x##cite . fig . [ fig _ ratio ] ( top panel ) plots the calcium abundance of seven known * daz white dwarfs with temperatures greater than 7000 k . the surface temperature for seven of these objects was compared with the results of @ xcite . the calcium abundance varies by several orders of magnitudes , compared with previous data ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this variation of abundance is possibly the result of small changes in the accreted mass and of a large time lapse since the last accretion event resulting in a diffusion - induced variation in the calcium abundance . [ fig _ ratio ] ( top panel ) also plots the fe / ca abundance ratio for objects with no known calcium abundance . even though the ratio is small , a slight dispersion ( @ xmath34 ) of the fe / ca abundance ratio is observed . in the small sample of objects depicted in fig . [ fig _ ratio ] , @ xmath35 > @ xmath36 , which is lower than the bulk - earth abundance ratio of @ xmath37 @ xcite but is still consistent given the @ xmath38 of the sample . we compare our small sample to the larger sample of the pollutedwhite dwarfs occur in @ xcite which compares white dwarfs with @ xmath39 k to @ xmath40 k . our cool sample has a slightly smaller abundance and a larger mean than what is observed in the @ xcite sample which has an average of @ xmath41 and at @ xmath42 . the main reason for the difference in the ratios is that in the cool sample the dispersion is higher than in the cooler sample and hence breaks down the ratios in the @ xcite sample . hence , the ratios at @ xmath43 ( nltt 888 ; * ? ? ? * ) and @ xmath44 ( nltt 19868 ) are similar . the abundance ratio observed in the nltt 888 is only similar to that of the cool dz white dwarf sdss j1043 + 3516 ( @ xmath45 , * ? ? ? * ) . fe / h at nltt 19868 is slightly lower than in the cool daz nltt 43806 ( @ xmath46 , * ? ? ? the observed abundance ratio @ xmath47 / nltt 19868 is also the lowest ratio among the cool white dwarfs , and thelow relative abundance of fe with respect to the other heavier elements . this abundance ratio is slightly lower than that of nltt 43806 ( @ xmath48 = - 0 . 4 , * ? ? ? . finally , the abundance ratio @ xmath49 is among the lowest in the white dwarf atmospheres , in fact it is the second lowest after the heavily polluted dbaz - 362 ( @ xmath50 , * ? ? ? * ) . a comparison with the population of the 60 polluted white dwarfs showing mg @ xcite , for which the average is @ xmath51 with a ratio of 0 . 4 , clearly places nltt 19868 at the oxygen - deficient end of the distribution . being at the bottom of the oxidation zone changes the observed abundance ratio over a time period much longer than diffusion timescales . elements with shorter diffusion timescales relative to other elements are depleted , and the abundance ratios also change over time . in the regime of fast mass accretion , the @ z1 / z2 abundance ratio is usually replaced by @ xmath52 . in the cooling phase , i . e . , slow mass accretion ) , the time ( @ xmath53) the abundance pattern is given by @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 are the diffusion timescales at the bottom of the convection zone which are assumed to be highly correlated . unfortunately , diffusion timescales are uncertain . few data are available for materials with effective temperatures below 6000 k . the abundance pattern in the parent material @ xmath56 is also uncertain and may , for example , correspond to mantle ( see * ? ? ? * ) , mantle , crust , or the mantle @ xcite . other types of materials , based on an interaction with solar system bodies such as those of meteorites or asteroids must also be considered . a study of the fe / ca abundance ratio in the extreme cases of nltt 888 ( @ xmath57 k ) and nltt 19868 ( @ xmath58 k ) and of applicable data supports large abundance variations in the parent material with some variation brought upon by diffusion effects . the expected fe / ca ratio is 1 in nltt 888 and 0 . 59 in nltt 19868 . in both cases , steady - state diffusion effects does not significantly alter the abundance ratio relative to the parent material itself . first , we consider the case of nltt 888 .comparing the tables of @ xcite between 5000 and 6000 years , we find @ xmath59 and the abundance ratios in both media are nearly identical . the timescales from @ xcite , @ xmath60 , comes to the same conclusion . however , the estimated ratio of the core material fe / ca @ xmath61 years exceeds that of bulk - ( @ xmath6213 . 4 ) and mantle - ( ( @ xmath621 . 4 ) assuming that the accreted material in nltt 888 consists of 64 % core material and 34 % mantle - mass data correspond to abundance fractions for these various media from @ xcite and @ xcite . considering that the fe / ca abundance ratio is expected to decrease over the diffusion time of ( @ xmath63 years ) in the event that accretion is turned off , the inferred amount of core material present in the main body of the core material of nltt 888 can be considered a lower value . the presence of core material also implies the likely presence of the , previously unknown , trace elements such as iron and sulfur @ xcite . a small amount of iron (1 % ( mass , * ? * ) is also predicted to be present in the core , although if both core and earth are to be considered , most of the material would come from the core . among the larger population of polluted white dwarfs , including higher mass stars , such as , the rate of @ xcite iron - enrichment is also high , for example , when compared to earth , both pg 0843 @ xmath3516 and pg 1015 @ xmath3161 sample material where the fe / si ratio is comparable to the planet earth . however , in comparison of the fe / ca ratios for stars in their sample , galex 1931 @ xmath30117 is the one with the highest fe / ca ratio @ xcite and is only slightly higher than that of nltt 888 . arguments for nltt 19868 are that , on the surface , core - type material is largely absent and that the accreted material is most likely composed of core - type material . during steady - state accretion , the low iron content in the core implies a significant deficiency in the parent material , i . e . , much lower than the ' s ' composition . assuming a deficiency of iron in the parent material ,i . e . , below that of the earth s mantle , may not be necessary . the observed fe / ca abundance ratio is well known if the accretion of earth s mantle produced material cooled off @ xmath64 years ago , allowing to significantly increase the fe / ca abundance ratio in the convection zone to the present ratio . note that diffusion timescales tabulated by @ xcite are systematically lower than those used by @ xcite , up to a factor of 10 . the difference arises because the convection zone has depth in the models used by @ xcite where it would operate in a denser medium . the depth of the convection zone at atmospheric pressure ( @ xmath65 years ) is not affected by the various treatments of the mixing length , but , rather by different treatments of the equation - of - motion and of the mixing medium @ xcite . in the tables of @ xcite and @ xcite between 5000 and 6000 years , we find @ xmath66 and 0 . 59 , respectively . assuming mantle composition in the model , the original fe / ca ratio of 1 . 59 would be equal to the present ratio of 0 . 59 in @ xmath67 years in @ xcite or as mucha period of @ xmath68 g following @ xcite . a shorter estimated time implied by the calculations of @ xcite after an extremely large convection event ( @ xmath69 ) . using the shorter elapsed time implied by the calculations of @ xcite , we can calculate the estimated total abundance of fe / ca @ xmath70 ##0 : @ xmath71 where the estimated time since the accretion event is @ xmath72 , and the initial timescale is @ xmath73 years . suppose that the mass of the convection event is @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 @ xcite , respectively @ xmath76 g , and the total amount of iron deposited onto the white dwarf is @ xmath77 g , so , assuming an estimated mass fraction of 6 % in the earth , the initial convection event would have been @ xmath78 g . this also amounts to less than one thousandth of the mass of the earth ( @ xmath79 ) . the most general scenario , but employing earth - gravity characterized by a higher fe / ca mass fraction than inthe latter , would require a large settling time period ( elapsed by @ xmath80 ##1 ) to explain the low , present - day fe / ca abundance ##s . for an accretion event as large as the collision zone itself , the calcium would have dropped below the detection level ( @ xmath81 ) after @ xmath80 years . in addition , we have found a very cool , polluted white dwarf with strong lines of calcium among weak lines of magnesium , aluminium , and iron . our initial atmosphere analysis revealed the highest iron to calcium abundance ratio of any known polluted white dwarf . applying heavy ion diffusion models , we find that the collision event of another peculiar daz white dwarf , nltt 888 , and that of nltt 19868 are clearly related . the material injected into the surface of nltt 888 is composed mainly of the iron - rich planetary core material , while the material accreted onto the surface of nltt 19868 is more akin to earth mantle material . in the case of nltt 19868 , the collision event most likely occurred several diffusion timescales apart . although these models appear accurate , many of the calculations rest upon uncertain diffusion timescale calculations . a .k . and s . k . received grants from the grant agency of the czech republic ( 13 -
