it is believed that solar magnetic fields are generated in the tachocline , the transition between the magnetic interior and the radiative interior . due to tidal forces , they move outward and emerge into the upper atmosphere in the form of @ xmath0 - sized plasma ##s @ xcite . the largest known active regions contain plasma with magnetic flux in excess of @ xmath4 mx and lasts of several weeks to months . smaller active regions consist of clouds and contain an order of magnitude less plasma , persisting over days to weeks . the largest emerging regions detected to date are the so - called active regions . they have fluxes between @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 mx and lasts in the range from hours to days ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . outside of active regions , the quiet sun has shown to be full of magnetic fields with strengths roughly in equipartition with the photospheric convective plasma @ xcite . an important question is the origin of these fields . @ xcite suggests that horizontal internetwork loops are concentrated loops of flux brought to the surface by the upflow##s of tidal forces caused by gravitational buoyancy . in a 2013 study , @ xcite indirectly observed the emergence of magnetic flux and reconstructed , for the first time , the three dimensional structure of the magnetic flux vector in quiet regions of the solar photosphere . it was found that at least 20 % of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun is generated by low - lying magnetic loops . additionally , @ xcite studied time series of spectropolarimetric observations made with the @ ##actic telescope @ _ hinode _ . these observations followed the time evolution of the magnetic loop on the internetwork , showing that they appear on spatial scales smaller than the @ xmath7 . @ xcite and @ xcite suggest that the emergence of magnetic loops in granular cells brings large amounts of horizontal fields to the photosphere both in quiet regions and in the quiet sun . another example of flux emergence has been reported by @ xcite . it shows the emergence and subsequent disappearance of what appear to be _ magnetic _ loops in the center of granular cells . the observations also suggest that a large fraction of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun may be the result of the emergence of small - lying magnetic loops . however , where do the loops come from ? are theywhether by the global solar wind , by the solar dynamo , or by recycling of magma from decaying shield volcanoes ? is the emergence process a local phenomenon confined to the photosphere or does the magnetic flux reach higher atmospheric layers ? the answers to these questions bear important consequences for our understanding of the physical and thermal properties of the upper atmosphere . for example , @ xcite claim that the magnetic energy stored in the quiet sun is sufficient to balance the radiative heating of the atmosphere . quiet sun magnetic fields are excellent candidates to balance the chromospheric and coronal heating problems , but a mechanism capable of transferring their energy to the upper layers has not been found yet . from a theoretical point of view , it is not clear whether the fields of the quiet sun photosphere can penetrate to the surface . @ xcite have proposed mhd simulations in which the magnetic energy emerges into the atmosphere in the form of small - scale @ xmath0 - waves . they enter the atmosphere and are reconnected with the local solar vertical magnetic field , heating the atmosphere and generating high frequency mhd waves that propagate into the corona . however , the magnetoconvection simulations of @ xcite show @ x##math0 - particles that accelerate as they travel through the solar system . these results indicate the need for further research aimed at determining whether magnetic fields penetrating into the quiet sun are able to penetrate higher atmospheric pressures . here we use multi - wavelength observations taken by _ hinode _ and the dutch open telescope to answer this question . we also characterize the magnetic properties of small - scale magnetic fields in the quiet sun , providing estimates of their magnetic properties , emergence rates , shapes , sizes , and properties . the data presented in this article consist of time series of polarimetric and optical observations of quiet sun regions at disk center . they were taken in three consecutive days ( 25 - 27 september , 1 and 2 october 2007 ) using the instruments of the large optical telescope , hinode @ xcite and the dutch open telescope ( dot ; * ? ? ? * ) at observatorio de san roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) . the observations belong to the _ hinode _ operation plan _ , the ` ` hinode / canary islands campaign ' ' . the _ hinode _ spectro - polarimeter ( sp ; * ? ? ? * )scanned the full width region of the series of images at 630 nm with a narrow field of view ( fov ) of @ xmath8 . this region was scanned with a cadence of 1 % during 4 - 6 hours per scan ( see [ tabla _ obs ] ) . the exposure time per single scan was set to 1 . 5 s to avoid more frequent scanning . however , this mode of operation also led to a noise intensity of @ xmath9 in place of the continuum intensity @ xmath10 . with a pixel size of @ xmath11 along the axis and @ xmath12 perpendicular to it , the sp measurements have a spatial resolution of about @ xmath13 . the hinode narrowband fourier imager ( nfi ; tsuneta et al . 2008 ) acquired stokes i and ii filtergrams in the direction of the chromospheric mg i at 517 . 3 nm line , @ xmath14 ##Â° , from its source . the nfi was operated in shutterless mode to reach an effective exposure time of 9 . 5 s per scan and polarization angle , with an fov of @ xmath15 . the ii filtergrams had a pixel size of 0 . 08@ xmath7 , and we rebined them to the sp pixel size in order to further reduce the resolution . the _ hinode _ based _ imager ( bfi ; * ? ? ? * ) took two images of the atmosphere in the cn bandhead at 388 . 3 nm ( filter width of 0 . 22 nm ) and the atmosphere in the caiih line at 396 . 85 nm ( filter width of 0 . 22 nm ) . the exposure times were 0 . 2 s and 0 . 3 s , respectively . the bfi observed a region of @ xmath16 with a filter width of @ xmath17 . both the nfi and the bfi took images with a resolution of 1 s . the area scanned by the sp represents a small fraction of the combined fov of the nfi and the bfi . therefore , we made cospatial and cotemporal observations of the quiet atmosphere in different layers of the atmosphere . the sp observed photospheric and chromospheric layers by means of a tunable lyot camera that observed the spectral lines of the cn @ xmath18 line in different wavelength pairs ( @ xmath19 , @ xmath##20 , and 0 ) . the passband of the dot was 0 . 25 . speckle ##s of 10 frames were taken at each wavelength band for 30 s . after the interference reduction procedure for the dot , the two filtergrams were combined using a noise reduction algorithm ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . the combined images have a fov of @ xmath21 and have a spatial resolution of + 0 . 5 . the dot and _ hinode _ carry out separate observations , and there is little overlap between them because of bad observing conditions . the sp data has been analyzed for dark current , flat - line , and radar cross - section using the sp _ prep . pro routine included in the solarsoft package . the algorithm applied to the hinode filtergrams ( fg _ prep . pro ) removed dark current , hot pixels , and cosmic rays . the spectropolarimetric data and the various filtergrams have been aligned with high resolution using the granulation , g - band data points , and other elements as a reference . in fig . [ calcio ] we show time - series h filtergrams and the magnetograms for the two days of observation . the remaining images have been compared to thesize of the total fov . the columns represent the regions scanned by the sp . note the presence of two brigthenings in the same region , as usual for the quiet regions , free of any interference . + ccccc date & 1st period & 2nd period & date & time + & ( ut ) & ( ut ) & & & 1 + 25 @ xmath22 sep & 07 : 00 -

scale magnetic fields through the solar system . to this end , we use photospheric and chromospheric observables . the sp ##m makes it possible to determine the strength of the field in the photosphere . the information is provided by the cn filtergrams , where bright spots associated with magnetic fields are clearly visible . we compute the total circular polarization as the integral of the unsigned stokes @ xmath24 profile . the integration is carried out in the frequency range from @ xmath25 pm to @ xmath26 pm . the total linear polarization is computed as the integral of the stokes @ xmath27 profile of 603 . 25 nm , with the same initial and final conditions . we then inspect the same region to look for the linear coupling between two patches of circular polarization with opposite polarity . since in general the linear polarization signals are very small in the frequency range , we attribute those signals to loop - like structures . after corroborating thatthe circular component is represented by symmetric stokes @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 profiles . figure [ _ _ ejemplo ] is the first example of the effect of a small - scale magnetic field as seen in the 630 . 25 s line . the three profiles represent continuum intensity ( top ) , weak negative signal ( middle ) , and strong circular polarization ( bottom ) . straight lines represent enhanced linear polarization . black and white contours mark the intersection of strong negative and positive linear signals . at @ xmath30 s , a patch of linear ##ity shows up in the center of the image . it corresponds to the horizontal component of the magnetic field projected into the image . between @ xmath31 and 60 s , two circular ##ized patches of opposite polarity appear next to it , in the center of the granular surface . the fact that the linear component is detected earlier than the circular polarization indicates that the magnetic structure takes the form of an @ xmath0 - cone : the apex shows linear polarization and the vertical portions of the footpoints give rise to circular and @ xcite . the linear polarization disappears in the noise at @ xmath32 s . thefootpoints increase with time . this sequence of events is consistent with a loop that forms and moves slowly in the medium . the distance between the footpoints keeps increasing until they reach the edges of the area covered by the sp . the time evolution of this loop can be seen in [ 2 ] . the stokes @ xmath33 and @ xmath24 filtergrams obtained in the red and blue regions of the spectral line give information about the upper pressure / temperature transition region @ xcite . we have used them to generate both magnetograms ( @ xmath34 ) and dopplergrams ( @ xmath35 ) . @ xmath36 where the subscripts a and b represent the distances of @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 away from the sp , respectively . to first order , the magnetograms obtained in this way are not affected by particle motions . the stokes @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 have been converted into magnetic flux densities and line - of - sight measurements according to @ xmath39 with @ xmath40 in mx cm @ xmath1 and @ xmath42 in km cm @ xmath3 .equation [ dopplergram ] is used in the range @ xmath43 and b @ xmath3 . these expresions have been obtained from measurements of the s - shape in the fourier transform spectrometer atlas of the quiet sun @ xcite and give only rough estimates of the magnetic flux density and temperature at the end of range of the b measurements . since the s and u were not measured , the mg ##b magnetograms can only be used to detect relatively vertical fields such as those expected at the footpoints of magnetic loops . by definition , fields flowing towards the observer and upflows will always be zero . note that our sign convention for the velocity differs from that commonly used in astronomy . in the chromosphere we do not have polarimetric information . instead , magnetic fields can be detected by brightness enhancements in the h filtergrams . the passband of the _ hinode _ b _ includes a significant photospheric contribution , and it has a long range that extends deep into the sun @ xcite . finally , information about the upper atmosphere is provided by the h @ xmath18 measurements taken at the dot . we have used them to construct dopplergrams .and one in the chromosphere . we calculate the magnetic flux density from the corresponding @ xmath24 profiles of the 630 field lines using the weak field equation ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ) @ xmath44 where @ xmath45 is the magnetic flux density , @ xmath46 the filling factor , @ xmath47 the field strength , @ xmath48 the direction of the field with respect to the vertical , @ xmath49 the filling factor that depends on the radio wavelength @ xmath50 and the total land area @ xmath51 of the field , and @ xmath33 is the filling factor . the values of @ xmath40 are equal and @ xmath1 when @ xmath50 is included separately . the magnetic flux density is calculated from the least - squares minimization of the { @ xmath52 } { \ partial \ lambda } = 0 , \ frac { \ lambda } { \ partial \ lambda } \ left [ \ lambda _ i \ left ( c _ i + \ partial ) \ frac { \ partial i } { \ partial \ lambda } _ i \ right ) ^ 2 \ right ] = 0 ,\ label { weakfield } \ ] ] which includes all the wavelength samples in the sample ( index @ xmath53 ) and is much more accurate that is based on the magnetogram measurements . this calculation is repeated for each pixel and each spectral line separately . the final result is @ xmath54 to reduce the uncertainty caused by photon ##s we use a data set containing only stokes distributions with a standard deviation of @ xmath55 @ xmath10 . the analysis of this data set using eq . [ eq2 ] leads to a stokes - distributed distribution for the magnetic flux , which is centered at 0 and has a standard deviation of @ xmath56 / cm @ xmath1 . in figure [ hist _ z _ 1 ] we make the calculation based on the zeeman regime . the plot shows a histogram of the ratio between the magnetic flux densities derived from 630 . 15 and 630 . 25 nm . only the low v spectra at the footpoints of the peaks with values of 10 times the noise level have been measured . as can be seen , the ratio is linear and centered at 1 . the figure below shows a scatter plot of the magnetic flux density##sities correspond with the spectral lines . the fact that most of the loops are located near the poles implies that in the majority of cases the spectral lines have the same magnetic field . this strongly supports the hypothesis that the lines are related . during several hours of observation we have confirmed the existence of several loop - like structures in the @ xmath57 region scanned with the hinode spectropolarimeter . table [ tabla ] shows their properties . the observed loops followed very similar evolution patterns . in this section we describe some examples to illustrate the evolution process , alternating between loops that migrated to the chromosphere and loops that remain low - lying . one of the first examples of a loop that entered the chromosphere was loop ml09 , observed on october 25 , 2007 at 14 : 39 utc . its evolution is shown in columns . [ ej1 _ crom ] and [ ej1 _ crom2 ] . each row shows a different loop , for a total of 1020 seconds . from left to right we show cn filtergrams , photospheric los velocities derived from the observed @ xmath24 zero - crossing data of 630 . 25 s , and circular polarization maps in 632 . 05namely , magnetic flux densities computed from at 517 . 3 nm , los velocities at the height of formation of the b loop , and h ##2 - core filtergrams . los values represent upflows . note that the time lines are not evenly spaced ; rather , we have spaced them to better describe the various stages of the loop . the red contours show regions of large circular negative signal in 630 . 25 nm . when the footpoints of the loop are visible in the blue , we plot regions of 630 . 25 nm circular regions in black and white for the negative and positive signals , respectively . when the footpoints are not visible in the b magnetogram we plot them in blue and red . the first part of fig . [ ej1 _ crom ] shows the emergence of linear polarization in a patch ( cf . the green arrow in the cn filtergram ) . this is caused by the vertical axis of the loop reaching the ground . the footpoints are not yet visible but it appear ' s later , very close to the onset of linear polarization . < @ xmath58 the loop is well defined . it is not a granular region , perhaps becausethe rapidly moving structures cause the field lines to emerge from below the ground surface @ xcite . the los angeles maps show photospheric upflows and the position of the footpoints , indicating that the loop is rising . for the loop , however , the magnetic field remains in the same range : we do not see circular field signals in the b magnetograms or brightenings in caiih that could be associated with the loop . however , the circular photospheric field element with negative components located towards the top of the scan , at a height of about one fourth of the total fov , is clearly visible both in the b magnetograms and the ca filtergrams , and will remain so during most of the time period . this nicely illustrates the capabilities of our observations : the structures that are visible in the polarization signals but not in b or ca are intrinsically lower in the solar atmosphere . between @ xmath59 s and @ xmath60 h the circular field signals disappear below the surface . the positive footpoint has drifted to an intergranular region and is concentrated , whereas the negative footpoint continues to be rooted in the ground and is more diffuse . the distance between them is steadily. we can see upward motion in the photospheric field lines . since the loop is confined to these layers , it is reasonable to assume that the upward polarization disappears because the apex of the loop leaves the formation zone of the 630 nm lines . however , no traces of the loop are found yet in g or h . at @ xmath61 s , weak linear velocity signals cospatial with the photospheric footpoints are detected in the b magnetograms for the first time . this indicates that the loop has reached the upper photospheric / lower chromospheric boundary where the positive end of the b line forms . however , the b dopplergram shows downflows of from @ xmath62 km to @ xmath3 at the position of the positive footpoint . the downflows could represent water moving along the legs of the loop as the whole loop enters high density layers . these changes could be necessary for the loop to get rid of some of its water before it can emerge into a more stable region . at @ xmath63 s , the loop is pulled out of the region created by the sp . the signals in the b magnetogram are much more intense and areto footpoints rooted in intergranular lanes . from then on the distance between the footpoints will increase , but at a slower rate than when they are crossing magnetic structures . this starting point can be seen in fig . [ dist ] , where we consider the footpoint separation as a function of time . the distance is computed from when the two footpoints are separated , both in the a ( circles ) and in the b magnetograms ( circles ) . in the first 500 s of the loop evolution , the distance between the footpoints increases , at a rate of 2 . 9 km s @ xmath3 . thus , the separation rate of the footpoints is 2 . 95 km s @ xmath3 , a rate compatible with the nature of the magnetic structure . the slow increase of the separation with time is a characteristic feature of the loops and means that they do not undergo a free random motion ( otherwise the distance would increase by the square root of time ) . towards the end of the loop , the separation rate slows down , along with the migration of the footpoints to intergranular lanes . finally , the field results in a field and the resulting granular fields drive the .straight lines to the closest intergranular points , where strong downdrafts capture and stabilize them . when this happens , the separation of the footpoints is about 4000 km . at @ xmath64 s , the footpoints are clearly visible in the b magnetogram and show downflows in the b dopplergram . the h signal is rising because the footpoints continue to separate . however , no brightenings are detected in the b filtergrams . we mention in detail that a new loop appears in the fov at this time , very close to the point of formation of the structure we are studying in detail . they have a linear h signal in all the legs , which makes it difficult to detect . at @ xmath65 s , the structure has entered the loop since we detected the first brightenings associated with the footpoints ( in fig . [ ej1 _ crom2 ] , the points have been replaced with arrows for reference ) . the legs of the loop still show downflows in the b dopplergrams and , for the first time , the points are detected in the cn ##om ##its the location of the footpoints . the last part of fig . [ e##j1 _ crom2 ] shows the pattern of the loop decay . the positive footpoint is very weak , although it still shows downflows at the border of each of the two loops . it will mix with the noise patch , together with the signal , at the end of the loop . the positive footpoint is approaching a negative noise patch with whom it will also mix . the negative footpoint shows downflows and features associated with a weak point in h . these features will survive the disappearance of the footpoint due to the interaction with the loop itself . in this figure we present a simple example of a loop which do not have chromospheric signatures and thus are low - quality . figure [ ej1 _ nocrom ] shows all the data points for this loop ( ml23 ) , just as in fig . [ ej1 _ crom ] . in the first example , a patch of positive polarization is observed to exist at the border of the loop ( see the white arrow ) . the footpoints can also be seen in the intergranular loop , but they are very weak . at this point the photospheric distribution also exhibits a patch of upflows at the end of the loop ,confirming the rise through the solar wind . at @ xmath66 s the loop reaches its maximum radius ( 520 nm ) while the upflows continue to decrease . the horizontal polarization and the upward plasma motions are almost gone at @ xmath67 s . in the next frame , at @ xmath68 s , the loop is no longer seen . the disappearance of the loop is so rapid that it appears and disappears twice at the same place . interestingly , the footpoints never approach each other . this rules out submergence below the planetary surface as the cause of the loop disappearance . all the structures that stay in the atmosphere exhibit very similar behaviors . in general , the disappear very quickly , disappearing very far from the region where they formed . none of these structures exhibit downflows in the b line or brightenings in the cn - h filtergrams . in the previous frame we have shown that small - scale magnetic fields in the neutral zone may travel through the atmosphere and reach the region where the outer part of the @ 517 . 5 nm line has formed . some of them also exhibit h brightness ##es . in this frame , the question naturally arises as to the maximum brightness that these structures can attain . are they notto reach the upper atmosphere or even the sun ? " we use the h @ xmath18 measurements of the dot to provide a simple answer to this question . unfortunately , there is little overlap between the _ hinode _ and dot measurements because of different seeing conditions . however , for one of the loops detected by _ there is some data from the dot . we use these measurements to attempt to predict the distance of the dot to the solar chromosphere . the model is not simple and can be refined with euv and x - ray observations related to the detection of such complex patterns in the hot corona . the loop detected both by _ hinode _ and the dot ( ml20 ) appeared on september 1 , 2007 , at 09 : 06 ut . in fig . [ ej2 _ crom _ todos ] we show its location in the solar / solar corona region using the 630 . 5 nm circular radial array and the b magnetograms ( first and second columns , respectively ) . the figure also displays h @ xmath18 from center filtergrams , as well as h @ xmath18 dopplergrams and @ xmath20 and @ xmath19 from line center . if thethus in the layers where when @ xmath18 is present , it should first appear in the fifth column , then in the sixth , and finally in the sixth . the loop appears as a small patch of linear material at the border of the granule ( @ xmath69 s , not above ) . its subsequent formation is similar to that of the loop shown in fig . [ ej1 _ crom ] . the footpoints of the loop are detected in the photosphere for the first time at @ xmath70 s . the loop initially shows upflows in the class v zero - crossing maps , indicating an ascent . however , the negative footpoint is close to the center of the fov scanned by the sp and soon disappears from the photospheric map . the loop becomes visible in the b magnetograms at @ xmath71 s . at this point there is clear signal in the negative footpoint and weaker signal in the positive leg . at @ xmath65 s the footpoints show stronger magnetogram ##s but the distance between them has not increased . the return of the loop to the surface is associated with downflows in the b dopplergram and brightenings inthe caiih line - core images . the and b signals start to follow h @ xmath72 s until the loop emerges simultaneously from the lower and the upper photospheric regions . the h @ xmath18 line core images and the dopplergrams do not show any particular pattern that could be associated with the appearence of an isolated loop system in the sky . it is important to note that the maximum separation between the footpoints of this loop is about 760 km . it may well be that a larger distance was required for the tip of the loop to reach the upper chromosphere . in fact , the magnetic tension would prevent the new loop from forming . keeping in mind these considerations , we do not expect that the loops with larger separations will be observed in future h @ xmath18 images . in this section we characterize the physical properties of the large - scale closed loops observed with _ weak examples and those very close to strong interaction areas or in crowded areas are omitted from the data to maintain the accuracy of the results . this leaves us with 33 loops , which represents 20 % of the total data . the [ tabla ] describes the basic parameters of the loop , the lifetimes ( @ xmath##73 ) , the distance between footpoints ( @ xmath74 ) , speeds at which the footpoints separate initially ( @ xmath75 ) , maximum magnetic fluxes ( @ xmath76 ) and maximum flux densities ( @ xmath77 ) in the loop , estimates of maximum magnetic flux densities at the time of each of the b loops ( @ xmath78 ) , and an estimate of the largest downflows detected by the b dopplergrams ( @ xmath79 ) . the lifetime is the time elapsed between the arrival and disappearance of the loop signals . when two numbers are used , the first indicates the time passed until one of the footpoints replaces with a new loop element . the second indicates the time of disappearance proper ; if this is indicated by an interval , then the polarization signals of the loop are still present at the end of the lifetime . to compute the total magnetic flux we define the footpoints as those regions where the flux density is greater than @ xmath80 at the end of the loop . the value of @ xmath81 shown in the [ tabla ] is the maximum flux density at oneof the footpoints during the photon ##ing , and the second indicates the error in @ xmath81 caused by photon ##s . the last two columns of the [ tabla ] represent the time interval between the detection of the errors in the data and their detection in the b magnetograms , the c dopplergrams , the n - core images , and the cn filtergrams . we consider that a loop is formed in each of these maps when at least one of the footpoints shows up correctly . the two columns in this column correspond to the positive footpoint ( left ) and the negative one ( right ) . cccccccccccccc ##cc & t & t @ xmath82 & @ xmath83 ##t & t @ xmath84 & @ xmath85 & @ xmath86 & @ xmath87 & @ xmath88 & @ xmath89 & @ xmath83t @ xmath90 & @ xmath83t @ xmath91 & @ xmath83t @ xmath92 & @ xmath83t @ xmath93 + & (09 / 07 ) & ( km ) & ( km ) & ( km ) & ( km / s ) & ( km ) & ( km / @ xmath94 ) & ( mx / @ xmath94 ) & ( km / s ) & ( km ) & ( km ) & ( km ) & ( km ) + ml01 & 25 & 13 : 36 : 15 & 240 & 800 & 3 . 0 & 2 . 0 @ xmath9510 @ xmath9610 @ xmath97 & @ xmath98 & & & & & & + ml02 & 25 & 13 : 36 : 15 & 12 / 1020 & 1220 & 2 . 0 & 3 . 0 @ xmath9510 @ xmath9910 @ xmath97 & @ xmath100 & & & & & & + ml03 & 25 & 13 : 36 : 15 & 330 & 560 & 5 . 0 & 2 . 0 @ xmath9510 @ xmath9610 @ xmath97 & @ xmath101 & & & & & & + ml04 & 25 & 13 : 36 : 15 &1 / 480 & 690 & 8 . 1 & 1 . 0 @ xmath9510 @ xmath9610 @ xmath97 & @ xmath102 & & & & & & + ml05 & & & 13 : 36 : 15 & 240 & 790 & 1 . 0 & 1 . 5 @ xmath9510 @ xmath10310 @ xmath97 & @ xmath104 & & & & & & + ml06 & & & 13 : 36 : 15 & 240 & 910 & 4 . 5 & 5 . 0 @ xmath9510 @ xmath10510 @ xmath106 & @ xmath107 & & & & & & + ml07 & & & 13 : 45 : 15 & 240 & 490 & 2 . 0 & 1 . 5 @ xmath9510 @ xmath10810 @ xmath106 & @ xmath109 & & & & & & + ml08 & & & 13 : 36 : 15 & 630 & 800 & 1 . 0 & 1 . 0 @ xmath9510 @ xmath9610@ xmath97 & @ xmath110 & & & & & & + ml09 & & & 14 : 42 : 00 & 960 / 1200 & 4000 & 4 . 0 & 4 . 5 @ xmath9510 @ xmath10310 @ xmath97 & @ xmath111 & 2 . 0 @ xmath112 & -

1 . 60 * & * 295 * & * 406 * & * 513 * & * 514 * + + as can be seen in table [ tabla ] , there is a wide range of loop parameters . the lifetimes vary from about 10 minutes up to 10 min , although most of the loops disappear in less than 10 minutes . the maximum separation between the footpoints is a strong indicator of the lifetime and ranges from @ xmath142 * to 4000 km . many loops have physical dimensions similar to , or larger than , those of spheres . therefore , they can be viewed as solid structures capable of withstanding the forces of the granular cells for a relatively long time . the initial velocity of separation between the footpoints does not seem to have any relationship with the loop parameters listed in the table . values of 0 . 1 to 6 km for @ xmath3 are common . as already mentioned , the initial velocity tends to decrease when the footpoints cross the intergranular boundary , likely because horizontal forces there are not as vigorous as in the interior of granular cells . the longitudinal force field measured at the foot##points range from @ xmath143 to @ xmath144 cm . the time of formation of the 630 nm lines is , considerably larger than the rest of values . this may be an artifact caused by the difficult nature of ml24 and the strong resolution element with which it interacts . ] . however , the loops have smaller dimensions than ephemeral regions and should be placed at the lower end of the flux density range in the dynamic region . the magnetic flux density in the footpoints is about 2040 mx cm @ xmath3 . to infer the magnetic field strength from the magnetic flux density values we need to know the filling factor of the field lines that build the loop , and their inclination . the footpoints should be approximately vertical because of these reasons . assuming that the loops occupy most of the resolution element , i . e . , that the magnetic filling factor is close to unity the field strength of the loops can be estimated to be of about 10 - 20 g . only if the filling factor is much higher than unity would the field strength rise to higher values , but we consider this highly unlikely in terms of g . [ hist _ ratio _ 1 ] . an important result is that 100 % of the loops are located in theb magnetograms make their appearance in the photosphere ( 45 % out of 100 ) . it takes an average of 5 minutes for the loops to move from the photosphere to the height at which the b measurements form , although shorter and faster ascents have been observed too . all the loops detected in the b magnetograms have downflows at the same height . in addition , 90 % of the loops are seen as bright spots in the line - core filtergrams . this means that an important part of the magnetic flux that goes into the photosphere is the chromosphere . as they travel upward , the loops are observed in the magnetograms , the b magnetograms , the b dopplergrams , the h line - core ##s , and the cn filtergrams ( in this order ) . in contrast , 10 % of the loops only make it to the atmosphere . we have been unable to determine any parameter on whether a given loop will rise or fall . this includes the total magnetic flux and the magnetic flux density . however , low - energy loops tend to have lifetimes shorter than 10 years and separations smaller than 500 km . or it may simply be that they do not last long enoughto explain high atmospheric temperatures . further work is clearly needed to understand why a substantial fraction of the structures are low - lying . also , the relation between these structures and the transient horizontal fields observed in @ xcite should be investigated , given their similar lifetimes and possible topologies . the observations described above demonstrate that magnetic fields do emerge into the inner solar system in the form of small - scale loops , confirming the predictions of @ xcite and @ xcite . the loops are detected as a region of linear fields surrounded by two circular polarization signals of opposite polarity . in almost all the observations the loop signal appeared before or at the same time than the corresponding @ xmath24 signal , as can be expected from @ xmath0 - shaped loops appearing in the atmosphere . only in two out out of four observations we detected linear polarization after the loops had already formed . in those cases , the footpoints were opposite each other . this behavior is consistent with a loop that forms and then submerges in the atmosphere , associated with a ` ` magnetic bubble ' ' , i . e . , a circle of parallel magnetic lines . the long duration of our observation series has allowed us to discover the existence of emergence ##s in which these loops appear .or the other . for example , there is the @ xmath146 region of the solar surface where we have detected three loops in a time period of 1 h . the complete set of loops covering this period is shown in an animated animation in the 2008 edition of the astronomical journal . some of the loops even occur at the very same position . the region shown in fig . [ ej1 _ crom ] belongs to this region . the existence of magnetic fields may have important implications for the origin of the universe . these loops appear as subsurface reservoirs of magnetic field that is transferred intermittently to the photosphere by an as yet unkwnown mechanism . the loops generally appear as clusters or at their edges , although there are exceptions of loops appearing in these areas . as the loops emerge the footpoints disappear and the magnetic field fades away . in most cases , the footpoints do not follow fixed trajectories . the [ trayectorias ] shows the paths taken by the two components of the loops observed on september 25 , 2007 ( loops ml09 to ml17 in the table below ) . the resulting curves correspond to the ones discussed in fig . [ ej1 _ crom ] . inthis makes the footpoints described quite a simple pattern , compared to the active regions and passive regions . however , the majority of loops have more complex patterns . the reason is that , in general , they emerge from granules and drift toward the nearest intergranular lane . when the footpoints reach the intergranular lane they stay there and are not absorbed by the fluid . this creates complicated patterns . the important point , however , is that the magnetic field is so strong as to be pushed and moved around by the fluid flow , but _ without being destroyed in the process _ . the loops remain constant during all their lifetime , as if the fluid flow did not exist . during their evolution , the loops interact with the magnetic elements ##es that cross their paths . if the loops stay long in the photosphere , the footpoints cancel with elements of opposite polarity and are absorbed by elements of the same orientation . loops that experience a long evolution have high probability of absorbing other magnetic elements and often disappear without making an interaction . when seeking the origin of the loops it is of interest to determine the magnetic orientation of their footpoints . if the loops are produced by the active solar dynamo, one may expect a random orientation of the footpoints at the moment of observation . this is what happens in active loops , where the signs of the leader and follower polarities are determined by hale ##s . ( see , e . g . , * ? ? ? ) the loops probably first appeared in the northern hemisphere during solar cycle 23 . in that cycle , the polarities were positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern hemisphere . the [ tilt ] is an histogram of the orientation of our small - scale active regions . the tilt angle is assumed to be the angle between the solar equator and the line joining the positive footpoint with the negative one , measured from the west . the values compatible with the order of sunspot polarities during solar cycle 23 in the northern hemisphere are those between 90 and 270 @ xmath147 . even if the statistical error is not very large , the loops tend to have a random orientation . thus , we expect that they do not follow hale s polarity pattern , much in the same way as the shortest - lived active regions @ xcite . recent observations of hanle - sensitive lines @ xcite and zeeman - sensitive lines @ xcite show that a large fraction of the quiet sun is occupied bymagnetic fields . however , these fields are randomly and isotropically distributed with inclination @ xcite . one way to shed light on their nature is to understand how they emerge from the atmosphere and what their contribution is to the energy balance of the solar atmosphere . on granular data , magnetic flux appears in the solar photosphere as transient horizontal loops @ xcite and small - scale vertical loops @ xcite . we have studied the phenomenon in detail using error - correction observations provided by _ hinode _ . after 28 days of _ hinode _ observations we have detected 69 small - scale loops emerging in a quiet sun region of size @ xmath148 the disk center . the flux rate is ~ 0 . 02 events hr @ xmath3 arcsec @ xmath1 . the loops have clear spectropolarimetric patterns with a central patch of circular polarization and two patches of circular polarization of opposite orientation . the average flux rate in each footpoint ranges from @ xmath143 to @ xmath144 mx , with an average of @ xmath149 mx . this indicates that the loops represent the fastest magnetic flux regions observed to date ( ephemeral regions have fluxes above 10 @ xmath##150 ##5 ; zwaan 1987 ) . the rate at which the flux is released to the upper photosphere by the loop can be estimated to be @ xmath151 mx , @ xmath3 arcsec @ xmath1 , and @ xmath152 mx over the solar surface per day . this is about half the rate observed by lites et al . ( 1996 ) for the internetwork loops , but still enormous ( see @ xcite for a comparison with the different emergence rates in active and passive regions ) . in the loop , the linear component associated with the length of the loop disappears soon , and the field lines of the two loops are observed to increase with time . this behavior is consistent with field lines moving upward through the upper atmosphere . only the upflows observed in the low v zero - crossing regions at the top of the footpoints indicate the existence of the loops . 23 % of the loops are observed in b magnetograms that sample the quiet zone or the solar minimum zone ( 1 , 400 km above the continuum forming layer ) . there is a time delay of about 10 minutes between the first detection in the photosphere and the second in the bmagnetograms , implying an arrival time of the order of 1 km @ xmath3 . some of the loops continue to move upward and are visible in spectral analysis - based filtergrams as minor brightness enhancements . thus , a few of the loops are able to reach the low layers , carrying magnetic flux with them . the rise of small - scale magnetic loops could provide an alternative way to transfer large amounts of energy from the corona to the chromosphere . this would support claims by @ xcite and @ xcite that the tangled rings of the quiet sun store sufficient energy to reach the corona . a related question is whether the small - scale loops rise up to the transition zone or reach the corona . the observations required to answer this question are more difficult due to the different spatial resolutions associated with present day optical , euv , and x - ray telescopes , which should be comparable . about 77 % of the loops that form in the solar corona never rise to the corona . these loops have the shortest lifetimes and show the smallest footpoint size ; other than that , they do not differ from those in lower layers . usually , they are close to their starting point . the structures associated with these loops may represent thethe solar sun was deduced from hanle and @ xcite , but a definite conclusion could not be reached without studying the results of hanle and the measurements . what is the origin of the small - scale magnetic loops ? one possibility is that they are created by the solar dynamo at the bottom of the convection zone , as part of a weak toroidal flux tube . @ xcite performed three - dimensional mhd measurements of the various stages of the formation of one flux tube . they found a horizontal tube at the bottom of the convection zone , directly above the photosphere . when the initial magnetic field is greater than @ xmath15310 @ xmath150 mx , the tube is not sufficiently buoyant to rise coherently against the convective flows and fragments . at the surface , the process of flux emergence occurs on both small spatial scales ( ~ 100 - 2000 ms ) and short time scales ( 5 ms ) . these properties are compatible with our observations . however , the small - scale loops we have observed may simply be the result of weak flux tubes distorted by the wind as they move from the convection zone into the atmosphere . the fragmentation of the tubes may explain why there are emergence centers where loops form recurrently oneafter the experiment . a preliminary analysis of the footpoint data suggests that the loops do not show a tendency to be aligned according to the ##s law . this can be regarded as a theoretical argument against the idea that the origin of the loops is the solar dynamo . however , it may not be a direct consequence of the interaction of the tube s fragments with the near - surface solar convection if it contains all the flux provided originally by the loops . another possibility is that the magnetic loops represent flux tubes from decaying active regions . in this sense , the mhd simulations of abbett ( 2007 ) , @ xcite , and @ xcite model such a process , because all of them assume an external magnetic field in the computational range which could be provided by decaying active regions . in the simulation , the loops evolve and interact with the granular convection . this interaction generates a large number of horizontal fields , even if the initial field is purely vertical . moreover , the simulations show the emergence of magnetic loops on large scales . the loops are less coherent than classical flux tubes and do not connect to deeply rooted field lines . in this scenario , the magnetic field of the early sun , and thus the magnetic events we have observed , would be the consequence of external forces acting onthe remnants of previously active volcanoes . " another possibility is that the loops represent the horizontal magnetic fields brought to the surface by the internal motion of granules or by surface currents , as modeled by @ xcite . but in that case , the origin of such submerged fields would be unknown . nowadays , we do not have enough experimental data to distinguish between a surface dynamo or a ` ` exploding ' ' magnetic flux ##es ##p from the solar interior . " the nature of the magnetic loops observed in internetwork data is important for a better understanding of the nature of the solar sun and its role in the heating of the solar atmosphere . future efforts should concentrate on the solution of these problems . in addition to high - resolution photospheric observations , optical measurements in the sky are recquired to determine the nature of the loops with precision . these data can also be provided by two - dimensional telescopes like ibis , isis , and imax . we thank andrs asensio ramos , philippe dmoulin and rafael manso sainz for their helpful discussions , and vronique bommier for carefully editing the paper . we are grateful to all the scientists who participated in the _ hinode _ operation _ b , and atisas / jaxa and for the leiden - leiden observatory . special thanks are due to suguru kamio ( naoj ) for leading the campaign and to jan stterlin ( leiden observatory ) for taking the observations at the dutch leiden observatory and publishing them . hinode is a communications satellite developed and launched by isas / jaxa , with naoj as a domestic partner , and nasa and stfc ( france ) as international partners . it is operated by these partners in collaboration with esa and nasa ( usa ) . part of this work was carried out while one of us ( mjmg ) was a visiting scientist at the instituto de astrofsica de andaluca . we have the support from the organization micinn through projects esp2006 - 13030 - c06 - 02 , pci2006 - a7 - 0624 , and aya2007 - 63881 , and from universidad de andaluca through project p07 - tep - 2687 . , m . , bellot rubio , j . m . , del toro iniesta , j . m . , tsuneta , t . , lites , j . w . , ichimoto , t . , katsukawa, t . , nagata , t . , shimizu , t . , smith , j . j . , suematsu , t . , smith , j . m . , & smith , j . r . 2007 , apj , 670 , .
