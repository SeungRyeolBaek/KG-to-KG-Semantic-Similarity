about a decade ago , galactic plane surveys discovered large numbers of luminous blue spots ( irdcs , @ xcite ; @ xcite ) . these were identified as dark spots against the diffuse ##d near - infrared background . first observations of very luminous irdcs suggested that these have unusually long wavelengths , focal lengths , and brightness ( @ xmath2 \ gtrsim { } 10 ^ 5 ~ \ rm { } cm ^ { - 3 } $ ] , @ xmath3 \ gtrsim { } 10 ^ { 23 } ~ \ rm { } cm ^ { - 2 } $ ] , @ xmath4 ; @ xcite ) . since they are dark , they are likely to be in an early evolutionary stage . included in irdcs are ` ` clusters ' ' of a few hundred solar systems @ xcite . it has also been suggested that many irdcs are the long - lived remnants of clouds just at the edge of the formation of massive stars and ( super - ) clusters . this hypothesis was supported by observations of very luminous stars in a few individual irdcs ( @ xcite ; @ xcite ; @ xcite ) . these observations also provided the basis of models for irdc evolution (e . g . , @ xcite , @ xcite ) and orion ( e . g . , @ xcite , @ xcite ) . irdc ##s are usually compared to regions of rapid star formation ( msf ) , such as m1 and m17 ( e . g . , @ xcite ) . [ ref : introduction ] this picture may not be complete , however . the above studies ( and @ xcite ) show that regions of low and intermediate mass stars will only appear as shadows in stars at mid - infrared wavelengths @ xcite . most irdcs will not be massive stars . therefore , the fraction of irdcs headed towards msf is still not known . fractions up to 50 % have been reported in the past ( section [ ref : stars - stars - irdc ] ) . in this letter , we will use a new method to provide the first ever quantitative evidence that very large irdcs are headed towards msf . this aids identifying pre - msf irdcs as candidates for alma and others . as a result , the msf was identified below the theoretical upper limit of this kind informs theory . in papers i and ii @ xcite , we found that solar molecular clouds composed of msf ( specifically :orion , ophiuchus , taurus , and ( nebula ) generally have @ xmath5 irdcs submitting to them . ( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) would resemble , e . g . , hercules and orion , but not orion ( which in eq . [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) . section [ sec : msf - limit ] states that clouds suitable for msf cannot exceed fig . ( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) . since star formation necessitates an enormous mass reservoir , msf requires that a large mass be concentrated in a relatively small volume . based on more detailed theoretical calculations , section [ sec : msf - limits ] puts quantitative limits on this intuitively simple concept . as seen in fig . [ fig : msf - limit ] , the clouds in this msf region are well within the actual upper limit bound by fig . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) . measurements of msf data confirm eq . ( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) as a true msf region ( section [ fig : msf - limit ] ) . thissuggests to use sec . ( [ sec : mass - size - limit ] ) to help distinguish irdcs with ( the ) msf from those without . this letter is organized as follows . based on data from section [ sec : method ] , section [ sec : msf - method ] shows ( using the msf values ) that sec . ( [ sec : mass - size - limit ] ) approximates the msf value . many well - studied irdcs ( 100 % / % ) fall short of this limit ( section [ sec : well - studied - irdcs ] ) . less recent evidence for complete irdc ##s is that most irdcs obey sec . ( [ sec : mass - size - limit ] ) , and will thus not be massive stars ( section [ sec : typical - irdcs ] ) . however , most of the matter contained in irdcs will reside in clouds of massive stars ( i . e . , those with sec .

[ fig : mass - size - limit ] ; _ yellow _ _ ) . at small distances , msf clouds ( _ _ _ _ _ ) must contain fragments separated by the same msf - limit . depending on the time of transit , @ xmath7 , and intercept , @ xmath8 , these fragments must also at least @ xmath9 be more massive than fragments in non - msf clouds . [ fig : msf - limit ] ] data for solar neighbourhood clouds with forming new stars ( examples : hercules , orion , ophiuchus , pipe nebula ) are available from paper sources ( and published online ) . we rely on bolometer surveys to explore msf sites : @ xcite explore fir ##s - selected msf clouds with cs - rich molecular clouds but no gas continuum ; @ xcite study gas droplets embedded in cs clumps of high bolometric luminosity ( @ xmath10 ) ; @ xcite explore helium - and hydrogen - compact hii regions ; @ xcite explore thenearby low - x msf stars ( we use their ` clumps ' ) . to exclude fragments not from these stars , we will use the ` type a ' sources ( @ xmath11 and / or @ xmath12 ##a , highly energetic radio sources ) from the @ xcite survey , and use the two ` type - b ' sources ( without masers and hii regions ) in the @ xcite survey . the irdc samples were collected using msx and spitzer instruments . @ xcite ( @ xcite ; using extinction ) and @ xcite ( @ xcite ; with @ xmath13 contrast ) - on clouds with high @ xmath13 contrast . @ xcite and @ xmath14 - based data for all irdcs collected in their @ xmath14 galactic plane images . @ xcite catalogue ##s - for @ xmath15 spitzer @ xmath13 irdcs with unknown composition . the mass - density data for the collected samples are summarized in paper ii ( using methods described in section 2 . 1 and fig . 1 of paper i ) . they are based on mass density data collected from dust detectors ( radar and bolocam ) and the( 2mass ) above . in a dendogram model introduced by @ xcite , derived from a set of known column density distributions , a given column density distribution is contoured with infinitesimal column density . every column defines the size of a cloud fragment . we derive the contour - defined mass and the column density , @ xmath16 . subsequent particles / columns are usually nested . this gives distances between cloud fragments , essentially yielding series of mass - size measurements . in fig . [ fig : mass - size - comparison ] , such series are drawn in straight lines . to obtain the values from the observed observations , we assume that column density and mass density are related by @ xmath17 @ xcite . to compare dust emission and extinction observations , they must be calibrated with respect to one another . in practice , we use @ xcite observed opacities ( multiplied by a factor of . 5 , to match observed opacity values ; section 4 . 2 of paper ii ) for mass - size comparisons . for this , we must scale the values to the observed density laws from paper ii . therefore , it is necessary to compare the different values of mass and size . the scaled values are shownin ref . [ 2 : mass - temperature - effects ] . where possible , we use dust temperatures predicted by the original model . here , we substitute our choice of dust opacities and the corresponding 1 . 5 scaling factor . @ xmath14 masses are directly taken from @ xcite , since their @ xmath14 - to - mass - effect is in rough agreement with ( i . e . , by factors of 1 . 5 . much larger than ) the emission - absorption relationship derived from @ xcite . we assume that light intensity at @ xmath18 wavelength and light depth at @ xmath19 wavelength are related by @ xmath20 ( 1 . 5 of @ xcite ) , and calculate dust temperatures from these ratios ( using dust temperatures @ xmath21 , and using the 1 . 5 scaling factor ) . we thus reduce the @ xcite values ( from their case ` 0 ' ) by a factor of .

( 2 ) of @ xcite . ] . in many cases ( @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite ) , the size listed in the original publication refers to the contour at half peak intensity , while the actual size includes areas at a lower intensity . in these cases , we assume that the sources have a near - spherical shape ( not as explicitly stated in many of the original papers ) . for these sources , the mass listed in the half peak - density contour is only a fraction @ xmath23 of the total mass ( e . g . half of @ xcite ; the area at half peak intensity is @ xmath24 ^ [ $ ] ) . thus we reduce the size to a fraction @ xmath25 , and use half of the published fwhm data as the total mass . @ xcite list is for a sphere , not an atom , and so the mass ( except for the sum of their radii ) has to be broken down by a distance of order @ xmath26 ( @ xcite , eq . 2 ) . if more than one distance is used for a given source , we adopt the smaller distance ( with a lower massto @ xmath6 / m _ { \ rm { } lim } [ r ] $ ] ( below ) . lc ) approximate a mass - size limit for msf ( section [ fig : msf - threshold ] ) . only a fraction of the irdcs exceed this msf limit ( fig .

[ fig : mass - size - comparison ] . the compactness has a range of values in the sample . this range is captured by taking the percentiles . as shown by fig . [ fig : mass - size - comparison ] , we can clearly see in fig . [ fig : compactness ] that regions forming massive clouds are , at given values , more compact than the limiting region , @ xmath31 . in all samples of msf data , @ xmath32 of the clouds have a mass , @ xmath33 . one sample @ xcite contains a very small number of regions ( @ xmath34 ) less compact than predicted by fig . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) . these regions may be good targets for follow - up studies . in general , however , this analysis ignores the fact that eq . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) is a model for msf . figure [ fig : density ] provides a compactness model for irdcs . we can characterize the @ x##cite sample size and comparing their ` em ' cores with associated @ xmath13 targets ( which are not dark ) . ` ` true ' ' irdcs will have properties in between these extremes . two interesting properties appear in these @ xmath27 samples . first , irdcs have masses which are , for given size , similar to those of solar wind stars and red giant stars ( e . g . , vega and jupiter ) . of all these , @ xmath35 of all targets have greater than @ xmath36 . except for the @ xcite targets , @ xmath37 of all targets exceed mass . ( [ 1 : mass - upper - limit ] ) by a factor @ xmath38 . second , irdcs are less compact than those with dark stars . for example , excluding the @ xcite targets , @ xmath32 of all irdcs are less compact than those ( @ xmath32 ) of the msf targets . in addition , the irdcs studied will have ( for given size ) properties in between those of regions with and without msf ( where ` ` true ' ' @ xcite irdcs have properties in between the two extremes( ) . more clearly , they do not fall in the mass - size range unambiguously associated with the formation of massive stars . however , before reaching final conclusions , let us consider some factors affecting our results . first , @ xcite derives masses using clumpfind , while @ xcite use gaussclumps . for the former , paper i states explicitly that the derived masses are , for any radius , only @ xmath39 of those derived from our dendrogram ##s . for the latter , the opposite is expected , since the measured fits only describe a fraction of the mass . in a given radius , our prediction scheme from papers i and ii would not find the masses . these biases are offset by other factors , however . we use the ` case a ' model ( assuming strong ir emission ) derived by @ xcite . following @ xcite , their ` case b ' ( assuming hydrogen ) appears to be more realistic . the masses could also be predicted by the factor @ xmath40 @ xcite . similarly , @ xcite suggests @ xmath14 - to - mass ratio , lower than calculated by @ xcite . in any case , similar biases affect the results for msf .. differences between these and irdcs are not likely to necessarily arise from theoretical uncertainties . however , many of the irdcs in the @ xcite , @ xcite , and @ xcite collections are ` ` typical ' ' for the early galactic period . @ xcite and @ xcite select samples which are unusually small in @ xmath19 images . @ xcite only selects irdcs which are unusually large and dense , and are clearly visible in @ xmath14 emission . . this excludes irdcs of low mass and density from the samples . less biased irdc ##s should thus be less compact than normal samples . the @ xcite catalogue contains irdc sample sizes and relative densities for the early galactic region studied by spitzer . it thus provides an important way to derive a rough estimate of the irdc ##s . since they do represent ( to our current knowledge ) the typical reservoir of galactic star - forming regions , irdc characteristics may indicate the early state of galactic star forming regions .

[ fig : msf - limit ] are these limits for a star of @ xmath58 , based on the @ xcite . the free - space timescales of their galactic cores @ xmath59 @ xcite also imply @ xmath60 . 5 , @ xmath61 ( @ xcite , fig . 2 ) and @ xmath62 @ xcite . since these stars might form spontaneously , and the star formation process is not known yet , we study @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 in detail . [ fig : msf - limit ] ] and timescales from spitzer measurements of their stellar dynamics .within the model , cloud formation will only yield a massive cloud if formed within the boundaries set by gravity . ( [ fig : msf - ff ] [ fig : msf - ff ] ) . @ xcite provides a similar limit , derived so that the massive cloud is surrounded by a cluster of low - density clouds ( in our terminology , they use @ xmath65 ) . in order to achieve msf , at least a few major components in msf clouds must remain within the exact msf boundaries mentioned above ( fig . [ fig : msf - efficiency ] ) . the global distribution of these components can usually be described by power laws , @ xmath66 , with @ xmath67 ( type 1 ) . these power laws imply that msf clouds violate @ xmath68 ( eq . [ fig : mass - efficiency - limit ] ) . depending on slope ( @ xmath7 ) , mass ( @ xmath8 ) , and their size , such excesses are calculated for radii @ xmath69 ( fig . [ fig : msf - efficiency ] ) . this is exactly what we expect for msf clouds ( fig . [ fig : mass -size - comparison ] [ b ] ) . msf is therefore only applicable if the cloud slopes are shallow , they are small , or large , when compared to eq . ( [ b : cloud - size - comparison ] ) . this permits a simple way to directly compare the properties of clouds with and without msf . the differences in @ xmath8 imply that msf and non - msf clouds may differ in their cloud properties . differences in @ @ xmath7 , however , imply _ relative _ changes in the structure , such as changes from the hierarchical cloud structure . the irdc ##s mentioned in the paper ( @ xmath2 \ gtrsim { } 10 ^ { ~ \ rm { } cm ^ { - 3 } $ ] , @ xmath3 \ gtrsim { } 10 ^ { 5 } ~ \ rm { } cm ^ { - 3 } $ ] , @ xmath4 ) only serve to describe the cloud properties of very large and complex irdcs . they are not well suited to describe irdcs on paper . large irdcs with @ xmath68 might slowly evolve and eventually become msf . and these cloud properties could , in principle ,erroneously , @ xmath68 where the same is true . however , these caveats are not often used when using irdc data to determine msf . therefore we abstain from such studies . our study suggests that many irdcs , if not all , are not related to msf . one also needs to be prudent when using irdc data to determine msf boundary conditions . previous studies discussing irdcs as pre - msf sites focused on very opaque irdcs of small angular size . these clouds often violate eq . ( [ tab : mass - size - relation ] ) , and many of them are not msf candidates . @ xcite suggest that most of the new star formation will come from irdcs . the absence of other known reservoirs of star - forming gas evinces this too . in comparison , most irdcs are likely to form clusters and disks of low and intermediate mass , just as ophiuchus and neptune do . however , many irdcs will tend towards msf . interestingly , @ [ tab : peretto - fuller ] suggests that most of the gas located in irdcs is the gas that can form new stars . for example , the 250 mostdark clouds from the @ xcite data ( all of a common origin ) contain more than 90 % of the mass - specific gas density of all irdcs . this implies that they may contain a significant portion of the gas seen in irdcs . if this reasoning is correct , just few @ xmath1 irdcs ( and not all @ xmath70 : @ xcite ) may contain most of the ' rapid ' - forming gas . given the uncertain nature of the gas observed from the @ xcite data ( section [ fig : non - irdcs ] ) , this conclusion is far from certain , though . this letter studies whether infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) are able to form massive stars . our main conclusions are as follows . * observations of clouds with and without rapid star formation ( msf ) show that the condition @ xmath71 ( eq . [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) has a threshold for msf ( section [ fig : msf - threshold ] ) . msf values differ from those in eq . ( [ fig : mass - size - limit ] ) by mass - size , or intercept ( fig . [ fig : msf - limit ] , section[ sec : msf - limits ] ) . * most irdcs ( section [ sec : most - studied - irdcs ] ) , if not all ( section [ sec : most - irdcs ] ) , do not exceed eq . ( [ sec : minimum - mass - limit ] ) . without significant further evolution , molecular clouds are unlikely candidates for msf , but they can still contain stars and planets of low to intermediate mass ( see perseus and ophiuchus ) . * large irdcs of large enough size are likely msf candidates . * if mass - neutral models can be trusted , then the @ xmath1 irdcs might contain a small amount of the galaxy ' star - forming gas ( section [ sec : most - studied - irdc ] ) . these irdcs would be stable and large enough to host msf . abergel , j . , martin , j . m . , boulanger , f . , cesarsky , j . , martin , j . m . , falgarone , m . , lagache , m . , perault , m . , puget , j . - l . , martin , j . m . , nordh , j . ,olofsson , m . , huldtgren , m . , kaas , j . m . , andre , m . , johnson , s . , burgdorf , m . , copet , m . , martin , m . , montmerle , m . , persi , m . , & sibille , m . 1996 , astronomy and physics davis , m . j . , dunham , j . m . , van rgensen , j . a . , enoch , j . m . , mern , m . , van dishoeck , j . m . , alcal , j . m . , myers , m . j . , stapelfeldt , m . j . , huard , j . m . , smith , l . m . , smith , p . j . , van kempen , m . , smith , l . m . , koerner , m . j . , mundy , d . j . , padgett , d . j . , & smith , p . m . 2009 , , 181 , 321 perault , m . , omont , m . , martin , m . , seguin , m . , ojha, m . , blommaert , m . , felli , m . , gilmore , m . , guglielmo , m . , habing , m . , miller , m . , miller , j . , de batz , m . , cesarsky , m . , elbaz , m . , epchtein , m . , fouque , p . , miller , m . , levine , m . , smith , m . , prusti , m . , siebenmorgen , m . , testi , m . , & tiphene , m . 1996 , mathematics and physics
