the complex electronic structure of mono - layered graphenes received much attention especially for @ ##ly , @ xcite although they were not the subject of theoretically study prior to the fabrication . @ xcite multilayer ##s which contain more than two layers can also be fabricated , and different phenomena depending on the layer number have been reported . @ xcite in this article we present a theoretical study of the electronic structure in multilayer graphenes . the electronic structure of the monolayer graphene is quite different from the metals , because the band and transport bands touch at @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 , in the brillouin plane , at which the molecule looks more like a single atom . in multi - layered graphenes , the interlayer structure creates a complex structure for the bands respectively . the electronic structures of graphene bilayer were theoretically studied for the band structure @ xcite and the transport properties . @ xcite for few - layered graphenes of more than two stacks , the electronic structure is described theoretically by a @ xmath3 model , @ xcite a density functional calculation , @ xcite and a two - band model . @ xcite on the other side , the electronic structures of graphenes from two to fourthey were recently observed by angle - dependent infrared spectroscopy . @ xcite the orbital disorder of graphene - like systems was first studied for a monolayer as a simple model to explain the large diamagnetism of it . @ xcite it was found that the system becomes highly diamagnetic at @ xmath4 ( band touching point ) even though the density of states vanishes there . the study was extended to both @ xcite and to multi - layered graphenes as a model of graphite like phenomena . @ xcite the fermi surface of the graphite is known to be trigonally warped at the band touching point @ xcite and the effect of the disorder on magnetization was studied within the perturbational model . @ xcite recently , the disorder effects on the thermal oscillation @ xcite and on the relaxation @ xcite were studied for the monolayer graphene . here we have a systematic study of the orbital magnetism for multilayer graphenes with arbitrary band thickness within the given temperature range . we show that the hamiltonian of the multilayer graphene can be divided into those equivalent to monolayer and bilayer , which allows us tonote the dependence of the susceptibility on layer numbers . we take the trigonal boundary effect into the calculation and show that the atomic structure around zero temperature gives rise to large magnetic moments . we describe the atomic hamiltonian and its decomposition into subsystems in sec . [ sec _ form ] , and then the description of the system in sec . [ sec _ mag ] . the discussion and summary is presented in sec . [ sec _ form ] . we consider a multilayer graphene composed of @ xmath5 layers of a uniform cubic shape , which are arranged in the ab ( bernal ) direction , as shown in sec . [ fig _ schem ] . the unit cell contains @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 layers in the layer @ xmath8 . for example we divide carbon atoms into two groups as @ xmath9 the atoms of group i are arranged in parallel lines parallel to the layer plane , and those of group ii are above or below the center of hexagons in the neighboring layers . the lattice distance within each layer is denoted by @ xmath10 nm and the distance between adjacent layers @ xmath11 nm . the system can be described by k * k *@ xmath12 * - * hamiltonian , corresponds to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattice structure . @ xcite the lowest energy state is given by the energy in the vicinity of @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 points in the brillouin lattice . let @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 be the wave functions at the @ xmath1 point , corresponding to the @ xmath15 and @ xmath16 sublattices , respectively , of layer @ xmath17 . for monolayer graphene , the hamiltonian of @ xmath1 point for the basis @ xmath18 , @ xmath19 is given as @ xcite @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 with @ xmath23 represents the nearest - neighbor coupling of a single layer . we use the same basis @ xmath24 ev . @ xcite for the two - layer coupling , we use basis @ xmath25 , and @ xmath26 , with the hamiltonian as given for the bilayer graphene . @ xcite where @ xmath25 represents the coupling between two different atoms of type 2 ( @xmath27 ) , and @ xmath26 for type ii atoms in neighboring layers ( @ xmath28 ) , which are equivalent to @ xmath29 ev , @ xcite and @ xmath30 ev . @ xcite if we look at the interface between layers 1 and 2 , the matrix element @ xmath31 , corresponding to the x axis , becomes @ xmath25 with the in - plane vector matrix . the matrix element @ xmath32 is calculated as @ xmath33 with @ xmath34 corresponding to the intra - atomic axis @ xmath35 , as the in - plane vector components from @ xmath36 to @ xmath37 are equivalent to those from @ xmath38 to @ xmath36 . similarly , if the matrix is calculated from @ xmath39 ; @ xmath40 ; @ xmath41 ; @ xmath42 , the hamiltonian for the multilayer graphene of the @ xmath1 atom is @ xmath43 with @ xmath44 the corresponding hamiltonian for @ xmath2 is obtained by combining @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 and then @ xmat##h25 with @ xmath47 . the definition of the effective hamiltonian based on the tight - binding model is given in ( [ e _ app _ a ] . we show in the appendix that the hamiltonian of ( [ eq _ h ] ) can be block - diagonalized into two matrices by choosing an effective basis consisting of @ xmath48 . first , we set the basis to the order of group i and of group j , i . e . , @ xmath19 , @ xmath49 , @ xmath50 , @ xmath41 ; @ xmath18 , @ xmath51 , @ xmath52 , @ xmath41 . then , etc . ( [ eq _ h ] ) gives @ xmath53 with @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 matrices defined by @ xmath56 where the upper and lower indices correspond to odd and even @ xmath5 , respectively . if we choose @ xmath57 ( the @ xmath1 basis ) , @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 respectively . thus @ xmath60 is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a two - dimensional tight - binding model withthe nearest - neighbor coupling @ xmath25 , is a product of eigenenergies @ xmath61 with @ xmath62 . , @ xmath63 is an even integer when the value of @ xmath5 is even , and @ xmath63 is even when @ xmath5 is odd , and thus @ xmath64 is useful only for computing @ xmath5 . the corresponding wave function is explicitly defined as @ xmath65 , \ { { x _ 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath66 is the amplitudes at @ xmath19 , @ xmath49 , @ xmath50 , @ xmath41 and at @ xmath67 we define the relation between the wave functions @ xmath68 and @ xmath69 as @ xmath70 now we construct the relation by assigning @ xmath71 to the atoms of group i and ii of @ xmath72 and attempting to define the hamiltonian ( [ x _ Ïˆ ] ) . the remaining elements within group i come from @ xmath60 and ii , as is clear from the above, @ xmath73 off - diagonal elements of @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 are obtained from @ xmath58 as @ xmath76 by the first step we have overlap ( [ bi _ 0 ] ) and intersection ( [ bi _ 1 ] ) . finally , the matrix elements of equality order are obtained from @ xmath59 as @ xmath77 \ nonumber \ \ + \ ! \ ! & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! & \ gamma ' ( k _ x \ sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { j - 1 } ( - 1 ) ^ * \ = [ \ psi _ { m ' } ^ * ( j + 1 ) \ psi _ { m } ( j ) - \ psi _ { m ' } ^ * ( j ) \ psi _ { m } ( j + 1 ) \ ! ] \ nonumber \ \ = & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! & \ gamma ' \ sum _ { n , m } ( k _ x \ delta _ { n , 1 ' } + | k _ x \ delta _ { n , - 1 ' } ) . \ ] ] the hamiltonian istherefore , in the basis @ xmath78 for all @ xmath79 . similarly , @ xmath64 is special in that the basis is generated with the same elements @ xmath80 , but this is absent for even - layered graphenes . the sub - basis is written as @ xmath81 which is composed of @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 , and corresponds to the hamiltonian of the monolayer graphene . for @ xmath82 , we write the basis as @ xmath83 where we have @ xmath84 without loss of information . we then replace @ xmath85 with @ xmath86 . this is identical to the hamiltonian of the bilayer graphene except that @ xmath25 and @ xmath87 @ xmath88 are multiplied by @ xmath89 . thus the hamiltonian of odd - layered graphene is composed of both monolayer - type and @ xmath90 bilayer - type subbands while that of even - layered graphene is composed of @ xmath91 bilayers but no monolayer . the basic idea was first proposedfor trilayer graphene without @ xmath26 , where it was shown that the energy spectrum is a sum of that for a monolayer and for a bilayer . @ xcite , we have extended this result to decomposition of the hamiltonian basis , and to systems with arbitrary number of layers without the trigonal warping . we also show that @ xmath48 - independence of the basis becomes important in the following sections , since this enables us to calculate the magnetization as a sum of those from non - hamiltonians , which are not calculated . several other parameters were introduced for the study of the electronic structure of bulk graphite . @ xcite the parameter @ xmath92 couples group i and ii atoms located in the neighboring layers , such as @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 . this parameter does not represent the dominant feature of the low - energy state and therefore is not important . @ xcite the @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 are the hoppings of the low - order neighboring atoms for group i and iii atoms , respectively . further , @ xmath97 is the energy difference between the group i and ii atoms due to difference in the chemical bond .each of these states @ xmath95 , @ xmath96 , and @ xmath97 allows opening up of small open gaps between the conduction and the absorption bands . however , these gaps do not play important roles in the structure as will be shown in the figure . in the case , @ xmath98 , the eigenstate is a pair of opposite traveling waves with @ xmath99 along the z axis . the relation between the states @ xmath63 and @ xmath100 is obtained by comparing the eigenenergy of @ xmath60 , eq . ( [ fig _ 1d ] ) , to that of the 2d limit , @ xmath101 , and @ xmath102 the 3d structure of the hamiltonian ( [ fig _ 2 ] ) can be obtained by replacing @ xmath25 by @ xmath103 and @ xmath26 by @ xmath104 like that of the bilayer . @ xcite we plot in 2d . [ fig _ band0 ] the expression for @ xmath105 , which is the full rotational symmetry . the ditwo subbands come together at @ xmath106 and the remaining two bands are only in the energy range @ xmath107 . if we define @ xmath26 , the effective hamiltonian for @ xmath108 is @ xmath109 which holds for the same energy @ xmath110 ( a more symmetric dispersion with the same mass @ xmath111 ) with @ xmath105 and @ xmath112 . @ xmath113 is represented by two horizontal lines . this panel shows zoom out of the image . ( 2 ) 3d plot of the entire second band at the band sticking point . four fermi points in @ xmath4 represented by [ . , n = 302 ] the energy proportional to @ xmath26 is responsible for the band sticking effect , which is most pronounced around the band sticking point @ xmath114 . let us define @ xmath115 in the energy range @ xmath116 , the fermi line splits into three small pockets , one center part and two leg parts located trigonally , which merge into four fermi points associated with @ xmath117 . wenote that @ xmath118 is proportional to @ xmath119 and is very similar to @ xmath89 , while the energy of the higher - energy state , @ xmath103 , behaves similarly to @ xmath89 . the maximum of @ xmath89 approaches infinity as the atomic number increases , so that @ xmath118 becomes as large as @ xmath120 mev . figure [ x _ 1 ] shows the band structures around the @ xmath1 point on the @ xmath121 axis of the multilayer graphenes with @ xmath122 , 3 , 4 , and 5 and @ xmath123 . the energies of @ xmath124 are given by @ xmath125 . we have only @ xmath23 , @ xmath25 , and @ xmath26 in our graphene model , the extra electrons neglected here may cause significant changes to the band structure . the energy distribution of a multi - layered graphene has been used in the density functional theory @ xcite and the self - binding theory . @ xcite those results differ from ours , in that the band structure may change depending on@ xmath63 , and that a energy gap opens where the conduction and absorption bands ( within the different @ xmath63 ) touch , and where the bands ( with different @ xmath63 directions ) cross . these are related to properties of atoms such as @ xmath95 , @ xmath96 , and @ xmath97 , which are mentioned above . in terms of the effective mass hamiltonian ( [ eq _ 1 ] ) , those properties appear as matrix elements without being multiplied by the wave functions @ xmath121 and @ xmath126 , since they are associated with a rotation along the @ xmath127 axis by another matrix element . however , they do not vanish at @ xmath128 ( @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 ) and cause the energy to open the gap . apart from the gap itself , the main feature of the energy warping is not discussed in the main article . it should also be noted that an energy gap is induced by an electric field perpendicular to the layer exchange axis , @ xcite where the electric field appears as matrix element independent of @ xmath12##1 and @ xmath126 as well . with @ xmath123 , around the @ xmath1 point ( known as x ) along the @ xmath121 axis . the figure shows the figure - out of the system . numbers next to numbers are @ xmath63 . , [ = 302 ] for the electric field , we defined the following equation based on the frequency response of , @ xcite @ xmath129 with @ xmath130 where @ xmath131 is the system number , @ xmath132 is the system number , and @ xmath133 is the system number . we defined [ @ xmath134 , @ xmath135 , @ xmath136 , and @ xmath137 ^ { - 1 } $ ] with the chemical potential @ xmath138 and the energy @ xmath139 . the expression valid only for the hamiltonian ( [ see : bilayer _ potential _ energy ] ) is given in appendix [ see _ app _ chi ] . for integration by parts in eq . ( [ eq _ 1 ] ) , weand @ xmath140 showing that the susceptibility at non - zero temperature is defined in terms of that at zero temperature . the dependence of @ xmath141 over @ xmath138 is independent of @ xmath139 . we calculate the observed scattering effects by using the self - energy @ xmath142 in the green - limit , i . e . , @ xmath143 in ( [ eq _ 1 ] ) is replaced by @ xmath144 . here we can define the scattering effect @ xmath145 to be independent of energy . using the properties of the hamiltonian , the magnetization of the @ xmath5 - layer graphene can be written as a summation over the self - hamiltonian . the contribution from @ xmath64 is approximately equivalent to the contribution of the monolayer graphene , @ xcite which occurs at zero temperature and in the green limit , @ xmath146 showing , the odd - layer graphene always has a positive energy dependence at zero temperature . the s - function dependence of @ xmath147 agrees with the general dependence of the molecule in comparison withand the @ xmath148 - linear hamiltonian , as described in sec . [ sec _ 1 ] . in the case of disorder , the g - domain is broadened into a lorentzian with constant @ xmath149 and the same area , @ xcite i . e . @ xmath150 in the general case assuming a constant @ xmath149 . the shape of the domain itself depends on the particular disorder and we may consider some different types of disorder in a more general treatment . in particular , for the monolayer graphene it was shown in the self - consistent born model @ xcite that @ xmath141 has a much sharper peak for @ xmath151 than the lorentzian and also a smaller peak compared to @ xmath152 for @ xmath153 . @ xcite in multi - disorder ##ed cases of disorder are more complicated because of the presence of other disorder . this article is out of the scope of this article . the area of the bilayer graphene described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq _ hm ] ) was analytically calculated for the case of @ xmath154 . @ xcite the expression for @xmath155 and @ xmath156 is given by @ xmath157 with @ xmath86 , where @ xmath158 is the step function defined as @ xmath159 the peak increases logarithmically toward @ xmath0 , becomes slightly larger for @ xmath160 , and decreases for @ xmath161 where the absorption subband enters . in the absence of doping , the peak energy is defined again as @ xmath162 . the integration of @ xmath141 in fig . ( [ e _ chi _ mono ] ) of the laser spectrum makes @ xmath163 independent of @ xmath25 , which is about twice as large as that of the monolayer graphene ( [ e _ chi _ mono ] ) . this arises due to the fact that the integral of @ xmath141 over the fermi energy is determined only in terms of the hamiltonian term , proportional to @ xmath121 and @ xmath126 , and is composed of terms independent of @ xmath121 and @ xmath126 . aproof of this important fact is given in fig . [ fig _ pi ] . if we include the extra band parameter @ xmath26 , the low - energy state of the material ( [ e _ chi _ hm ] ) also occurs relative to the crystal structure around the first touching point . to see this , we can calculate @ xmath141 for the hamiltonian ( [ chi _ hm ] ) in the units of the corresponding trigonal warp , @ xmath164 . figure [ fig _ 1 ] shows the susceptibility as a function of @ xmath165 with several values of @ xmath149 . we get @ xmath166 , where the fermi transition also occurs ( rather than @ xmath167 . for reference we can write the energy without the trigonal warp , @ xmath168 , as a dashed line . ) consider the multilayer graphene with @ xmath169 , @ xmath123 and several band parameters @ xmath149 . energy is scaled in units of @ xmath167 . dashed lines show plots for @ xmath170 . shown at the top is thestarting out of the top panel ( @ xmath171 ) with units of energy @ xmath25 . , [ = 302 ] when we move away from the energy in the top panel ( the current @ xmath149 ) , the energy gradually deviates away from the energy dependence of @ xmath168 , and takes a sharp decline in @ xmath172 . remarkably we have a small ripple effect on @ xmath4 , which is known as the relaxation of the energy gradient around the energy . the integral of @ xmath141 over the high energy remains almost constant @ xmath173 as discussed in sec . [ sec _ 1 ] , suggesting that the reduction in the energies compensates the low energy peak . as @ xmath149 becomes broad , the peak tends to decrease with the increase in the energy and the peak of @ xmath26 ##2 disappears when @ xmath174 . in contrast , the energy associated with the monolayer of @ xmath64 becomes larger in @ xmath149 but never disappears , as discussed in eq . ( [ eq : monolayer _ with _ broadening ] ). figure [ fig _ chi _ multi ] shows @ xmath175 of graphenes with layer numbers from @ xmath176 to 5 with several different strengths @ xmath149 . for @ xmath177 , we show the peaks from each of bilayer - type bands . the band of odd @ xmath5 always contains a monolayer - like component , which is exactly the same as @ xmath176 and is absent from the figure . we can see that odd - layered graphenes exhibit a very small peak , which always comes from the monolayer - type band . the bilayer - like component has a small peak due to the crystal structure and a large peak at high energies , in accordance with experiment . [ fig _ 2 ] . the layer - number dependence of the susceptibility of multilayer graphene has been studied for the graphite intercalation compounds . @ xcite this system can be viewed as two multilayer graphenes bound by the intercalant system , and the intercalants have a strong electrostatic force in the stacking direction , due to the charge transfer among the layers . @ xcite as a result the crystal structure and the structureis very different from our system with a uniform electric field in the opposite direction . for the multilayer graphenes studied in recent years , we may have a large difference among them depending on the experimental environment , and this may also be affected by the external electric field already mentioned . in sec . [ x _ chi ] , we can show that , as long as the field is not too high to affect the overall band structure , this does not change the qualitative feature of the material . the zero energy state in the bilayer - s subband originates in dirac - like dispersions centered at four # ##ons . for the known configuration of the bilayer , @ xcite we can show that the sequence of the landau levels in the center pocket approximately becomes @ xmath178 with @ xmath179 , and those in the outer - parts @ xmath180 , where @ xmath181 is the magnetic field . since the susceptibility is determined solely by the charge distribution , we apply this to the monolayer - sequence @ xmath182 and then @ xmath141 from each pocket by using @ xmath183 in eq . ( [ eq _ chi _mono ] ) . we end up with @ xmath184 except for a factor coming from the difference of the two energy states . the lower - energy state in fig . [ fig _ multi ] fits perfectly to the lorentzian with parameters @ xmath149 and the dependence of the delta - function ( [ eq _ chi _ fine ] ) , as well as @ xmath185 . the parameter corresponding to @ xmath147 is as large as 0 . 5 when @ xmath164 and @ xmath123 , and therefore the effect is not too small compared with that of the monolayer . for @ xmath5 - layered graphene , a simple calculation @ xmath186 leads to the estimate of ( [ eq _ chi _ fine ] ) for all the bilayer - sized subbands , @ xmath187 in fig . [ fig _ chi _ multi ] the peak height is a bit lower than this estimation due to interference with the thermal expansion . the delta - function dependence of @ xmath141 - monolayer graphene is a characteristic feature unique to the @ xmath148 - layered hamiltonian . this can beshown by the above equation . we have the hamiltonian @ xmath188 which has only the coefficients ##ly @ xmath121 and @ xmath126 . we change the energy and particle number , by an additional factor @ xmath189 and @ xmath190 then the hamiltonian becomes almost identical under this transformation , since the coefficients of @ xmath148 - linear terms in the hamiltonian remain unchanged . going back to the values of @ xmath141 with ( [ f _ e ] ) and ( [ f _ scale ] ) , @ xmath191 is scaled as @ xmath192 the function @ xmath193 should depend only on the coefficients of @ xmath148 - linear terms and scale transformations , and it is invariant under the scale transformation , so we have @ xmath194 . with ( [ eq _ f _ scale ] ) , we come up with the function , @ xmath195 which is given solely by @ xmath196 - constant @ xmath15 ##5 equal to the integral of the function @ xmath175 over the free surface @ xmath##165 . from ( [ eq _ li ] ) , we generally have @ xmath197 where the integral path @ xmath198 is a circle with an integral radius with anti - clockwise direction . in the following system , ( [ eq _ f _ li ] ) immediately follows the integral path @ xmath199 . this is the integral of the real function @ xmath200 and so is true . from eq . ( [ eq _ f _ li ] ) with parameters @ xmath15 and ref . ( [ eq _ li ] ) , we can obtain the explicit form of the high - temperature model as @ xmath201 as shown in ref . [ sec _ form ] , the band boundary in most realistic models has an energy gap in the center due to extra band parameters neglected in the present model . it was previously mentioned that the external magnetic field along this direction has an energy gap . one might expect that the gap would strongly reduce the large energy of the energy gap boundary . however , we can show within the effective mass approximation that the integral of susceptibility as @ xmath165 is independent of the number of band parameters without@ xmath121 and @ xmath126 , which are adjusted for gap width . this is clear from the general formula ( [ x _ 1 _ oint ] ) ; even if the hamiltonian contains @ xmath148 - independent terms in addition to @ xmath148 - linear terms , they can be safely neglected in the integral because they are infinitesimal compared to @ xmath202 and the corresponding @ xmath198 . in the effective - field model of the multilayer graphene we immediately conclude that the integral is independent of @ xmath25 , @ xmath95 , @ xmath96 , @ xmath97 , and any other terms outside of the wave vector . thus we conclude that the resulting energy gap is still visible even when the gap opens , but it will get reduced in size by the gap width . the diamagnetism of energy gap systems is known as bismuth @ xcite and recently studied for the gapped dirac fermion . @ xcite . this also requires a direct calculation of the integral with extra variables , but we leave this for the future study . the calculation of the suscept##ibility can be calculated from the hamiltonian with the @ xmath148 - linear terms dropped , and it depends only on the dominant parameter associated with @ xmath148 - linear terms . in our model ( [ eq _ 2 ] ) , the correction is mainly given by the dominant parameter @ xmath23 , and @ xmath26 gives a correction at most of the coefficients of @ xmath203 . the correction must be the first term in @ xmath26 because we can convert @ xmath26 to @ xmath204 and the hamiltonian with a unitary transformation of the coefficients on layer @ xmath17 by @ xmath205 . as a result , the value of @ xmath175 for the bilayer - type hamiltonian becomes approximately twice as large as the monolayer s , and the integral over all the coefficients of @ xmath5 - layered graphene becomes approximately @ xmath5 times as large as the monolayer s . it is instructive to derive the susceptibility starting from the two - level model . for the monolayer graphene , the coupling constant @ xmath206 is approximately[ @ xmath207 \ ! \ } , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 with @ xmath210 , and @ xmath211 is transfer function which then goes to zero for @ xmath212 with the term @ xmath213 . we can write this [ @ xmath214 where @ xmath215 , \ ] ] with @ xmath216 . using the term @ xmath217 with respect to @ xmath218 , we can have @ xmath219 \ nonumber \ \ = & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! & \ int _ d ^ \ infty h ( x ) \ ^ - { 1 \ over 12 } d ^ [ \ !

( [ e : high _ potential : _ monolayer _ graphene ] ) , as is usual . in the bilayer graphene , the energy associated with @ xmath154 and the region @ xmath230 can be calculated from the hamiltonian ( [ e : bilayer _ high _ energy ] ) : @ xcite @ xmath231 where @ xmath232 with @ xmat##h233 appears in fig . ( [ e _ mstar ] ) , @ xmath234 , and @ xmath235 . we have two degenerate states at zero energy ( @ xmath236 , @ xmath234 ) , and the energy also becomes constant as @ xmath237 goes higher . in a similar but more complicated manner , the susceptibility is calculated from @ xmath238 which also represents the energy band at zero energy in the above expression ( [ e _ bi _ alt ] ) , as well . a constant term independent of energy is found in fig . ( [ e _ e _ bi _ alt ] ) since this depends on all the low - energy states which are used in this calculation . we can understand the energy dependence directly by looking into the landau - level sequence . the landau level energy can be calculated for large @ xmath237 as @ xmath239 , \ ] ] where the first term gives the energy interval , and the second gives a trajectory toward zero energy , which is known as @ xmath240 . for @ xmath241, for example , the change in the free energy due to the chemical reaction is calculated from @ xmath242 giving the @ xmath243 value of the susceptibility . for the hamiltonian ( [ e : bilayer _ free _ energy ] ) with terms similar to @ xmath244 , the above relation ( [ e _ chi ] ) with ( [ e _ chi ] ) is no longer valid , since this was only derived for systems in which @ xmath245 corresponds with @ xmath246 and @ xmath247 . the modified formula should be @ xmath248 this is reflected in the [ e _ app _ b ] . a similar scheme similar to the case of the monolayer graphene then gives @ xmath249 . this again leads to the energy dependence of @ xmath141 on the fermi surface , which coincides with ( [ e _ chi _ bi _ pi ] ) , from the equation . the first studies of the behavior of two - dimensional quantum systems were done in the semiconductor heterostructures , by using the superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) @xcite is using the torque method . @ xcite we found that the study of the graphene magnetism is also possible with those techniques . we have modeled the orbital ##s of multilayer graphene with the bernal stacking in the effective mass approximation . we have demonstrated that the hamiltonian and therefore the susceptibility can be decomposed into those corresponding to the monolayer or bilayer bands . the monolayer - like band exists only in multi - layered graphenes and gives a strong diamagnetic disorder at @ xmath250 . the bilayer - like bands always exist and give a strong diamagnetism in the vicinity of zero energy , unless the fine - structure produced by @ xmath26 is affected by the disorder . this work has been funded in part by the 21st century coe institute of tokyo for large - scale theoretical physics and by grants - in - aid for scientific research from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan . we obtained from the following the effective mass approximation ##s . ( [ x _ h ] ) of states in the vicinity of @ xmath1 , for a multilayer graphene , by starting from the two - orbital self - binding model .the following is simple but not straightforward example of the monolayer case . @ xcite is a tight - binding site , the wave function is written as @ xmath251 , \ { { \ } \ ] ] where @ xmath252 is the atomic position , @ xmath253 is the wave function of the @ xmath254 component of a single atom located on the layer , as a function of two - dimensional space @ xmath255 . @ xmath256 is the two - dimensional component of the site @ xmath257 , and @ xmath258 is a two - dimensional component of @ xmath259 , localized to the layer . in the example with hopping sites @ xmath23 , @ xmath25 , and @ xmath26 ##0 in fig . [ free _ 1 ] , schrdinger # ##nr can be written as follows : for : @ xmath17 , @ xmath260 , \ \ \ vare \ , _ { b _ { j } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ _ $ } } _ { b _ { j } } ) & = & - \ \_ 1 \ psi _ { j = 1 } ^ 2 \ psi _ { a _ { j } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { a _ { j } } + { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ 1 ) \ nonumber \ \ & & \ hspace { \ gamma } + \ psi _ 1 \ quad [ \ psi _ { a _ { j + 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { b _ { j } } ) + \ psi _ { b _ { j - 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { b _ { j } } ) \ [ ] . \ quad \ dot { a _ sch1 } \ dot { 1 } \ ] ] for [ @ xmath17 , @ xmath261 , \ quad \ \ \ vare \ psi _ { a _ { j } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { b _ { j } } ) & = & - \ gamma _ 1 \a _ { l = 1 } ^ 3 \ psi _ { a _ { j } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { a _ { j } } + { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ l ) \ nonumber \ \ & & \ hspace { - 1 \ } + \ psi _ 1 \ psi _ { j = 1 } ^ 3 \ , [ \ psi _ { a _ { j + 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { b _ { j } } - { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ l ) + \ psi _ { a _ { j - 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { a _ { j } } - { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ l ) \ \ ] . \ begin { b _ sch2 } \ begin { l } \ ] ] . we compare the traffic from a site to the two class b sites : @ xmath262 , @ xmat##h263 , and @ xmath264 , and we set @ xmath265 . the value of @ xmath1 , can be expressed in terms of the time - varying values of @ xmath266 and @ xmath267 where @ xmath268 , and @ xmath269 , @ xmath270 are envelope functions defined by @ xmath271 with @ xmath272 . when @ xmath273 is much larger than the full values of the envelope functions , we set @ xmath274 with @ xmath275 and @ xmath7 . by replacing e . ( [ e _ env ] ) with ( [ e _ approx ] ) , into schrdinger e . ( [ e _ sch1 ] ) and ( [ e _ sch2 ] ) , we set for example @ xmath17 , @ xmath276 \ nonumber \ \ \ vare f _ { b _ j } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ _ $ } } ) & = & \ \ f _ + f _ { b _ j }( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) + \ k _ - \ left [ f _ { a _ { j - 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) + f _ { a _ { j + 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) \ right ] , \ nonumber \ \ \ text { \ } \ ] ] and for [ @ xmath17 , @ xmath277 , \ nonumber \ \ \ vare f _ { a _ j } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) & = & \ \ k _ + f _ { a _ j } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) + \ gamma ' f _ - \ left [ f _ { a _ { j - 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) + f _ { a _ { j + 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) \ right ], \ nonumber \ \ \ end { \ } \ ] ] where @ xmath21 with @ xmath278 , @ xmath279 . we also have the operator @ xmath280 if we convert this system of equations into the following form for a valley @ xmath281 , we can get the hamiltonian of ( [ e _ chi ] ) . the effective hamiltonian for the valley @ xmath282 can be derived in a similar manner , since @ xmath283 and @ xmath284 are described in eq . ( [ eq _ c ] ) . the corresponding operator ( [ eq _ chi ] ) with ( [ e _ c ] ) has been derived for the luttinger - kohn representation of the wave function @ xcite and therefore it is given by the hamiltonian consisting of the total effective kinetic energy @ xmath285 and terms appearing in @ xmath286 . @ xcite we get from the above formula which is valid for the general hamiltonian @ xmath287 which includes @ xmath148 - square roots and off - diagonal matrix elements as well as@ xmath148 - all ##ele . we shall restrict ourselves to the state without electron - hole interactions for simplicity . consider the system described by the schrdinger equation @ xmath288 with @ xmath289 and @ xmath290 as the interaction states . the interaction state @ xmath206 is given by @ xmath291 \ , \ } \ nonumber \ \ & = & - k _ { \ rm r } \ \ , k _ { \ rm c } \ frac { 1 } { 1 } \ int { \ varepsilon \ , \ left ( \ ! - \ ! { i \ , \ mu } \ , ) { \ rm r \ } \ , { \ rm tr } \ , \ frac { 1 } { \ vare - { \ cal ##c } + i0 } \ nonumber \ \ & & \ qquad \ qquad \ , \ ln \ , \ { \ \ ! + \ ! \ exp [ \ , ( \ , \ ! - \ ! \ varepsilon ) ] \ , \ } , \ begin { k _ 1 } \ , { 1 } \] ] where @ xmath292 is the system number and @ xmath293 is the system volume . we assume an ideal system and consider the vector potential @ xmath294 , with @ xmath295 where we are going to consider the short term , @ xmath296 , for which the field has the strength the same as that due to a perfectly uniform magnetic field . in the absence of this vector potential , the hamiltonian changes from @ xmath297 to @ xmath298 , with @ xmath299 , where @ xmath300 . the hamiltonian can be written as @ xmath301 where @ xmath302 , @ xmath303 , and @ xmath304 . note that the resulting @ xmath148 - dimensional hamiltonian @ xmath305 does not agree with @ xmath246 but does with @ xmath306 . expanding the hamiltonian up to the second term of the strength of the magnetic field @ xmath16 , we get @ xmath307 where @ xmath308 is the magnetic field , @ xmat##h309 , @ xmath310 , and we assumed that the structure is phase stable ( using the phase equation in the case of water ) . we then expand @ xmath311 up to the last step , @ xmath312 , to replace @ xmath313 with @ xmath314 . this expansion causes the change of the surface of @ xmath315 with e . ( [ f _ gen ] ) . the susceptibility @ xmath141 is increased by the substitution @ xmath316 , @ xmath317 this replaces e .
