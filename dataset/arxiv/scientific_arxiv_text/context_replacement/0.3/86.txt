cataclysmic systems ( cv ) are short - period binaries containing a white dwarf ( wd ) primary ( with mass @ xmath2 ) and a low mass main sequence secondary ( with mass @ xmath3 ) . the primary fills its roche lobe and transfers mass to the wd through the secondary lagrangian ( @ xmath4 ) point . the main features of the orbital period distribution of systems with hydrogen - oxygen are the presence of systems in the 2 - 3 hr time range ( the so - called period limit ) and the maximum cut ##off of the distribution at around 10 hr , as can be seen in figure [ combined ] ( upper frame ; e . g . ritter & kolb 1998 ) . so far no models have been able to predict the exact position of the cv short - period cut - off and observed shape of the cv orbital period distribution at this cut - off . this is shown in figure [ combined ] . systems that are under the influence of gravitational forces ( gr ; kraft et al . 1962 ) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum ( e ) reach their minimum period at @ xmath5 minutes ( figure [ combined ] , lower frame ; paczyski 1971 ; kolb& baraffe 1999 ) . the probability of finding a system within a given orbital range is proportional to the time required to evolve through this range . we thus have p ( p ) , for the number @ xmath6 of systems found within a given orbital period range , @ xmath7 , and @ xmath8 is the orbital time derivative of this number . we also have an increase of mass ( or spike ) at @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 ( figure [ combined ] , lower frame ) , while no such spike is present in the observed system ( figure [ combined ] , upper frame ) . the orbital period also affects the radius change of the mass donor , which in turn is affected by two competing effects . mass transfer breaks thermal equilibrium and expands the star . thermal relaxation breaks thermal equilibrium and expands the star back to its equilibrium radius . the minimum expansion is where the two different time scales , the mass transfer time @ xmath11 and the maximum ( kelvin - helmholtz ) time @ xmath12 are about equal ( e . g . paczyski 1971 ; brown 1988 ) . if @ xmath13 then the star is forced to contract in response to mass transfer ,but if @ xmath14 the star will not shrink rapidly enough and will be oversized for its lifetime . the position of the cv period is strongly influenced by the assumed mass transfer rate , and in particular by the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum ( am ) loss . in this section we investigate ways to increase the am , without increasing the mass transfer rate , and propose ways to ` ` hide ' ' the effect by using a range of @ xmath9 values in the cv period . in particular , we study the existence of a form of consequential am loss ( caml ) where the am is lost as a consequence of the mass transferred from the secondary , i . e . @ xmath15 ( see e . g . webbink 1985 ) . in section [ theory ] we make our own theoretical assumptions and introduce the formula for caml . in section [ sec22 ] we present theoretical calculations of the long - term evolution of cvs , and in section [ comptest ] we compare the assumed short term cv period distributions with various theoretical equivalent age distributions based on the calculations in section 2 . in this section we present general solutions to the relationship between the observed and predicted minimum orbital periods of stars . the orbital am loss rate @xmath16 of a cv can be expressed as the sum of two terms , = _ sys + _ caml , where @ xmath17 is the ` ` ` ' ' am loss rate , such as gravitational wave loss , that is independent of mass transfer , while @ xmath18 is an inverse function of the mass loss rate . we assume = 0 and _ caml0 _ . we consider the special case in which the caml mechanism , along with other mass transfers , causes a fraction of the nova mass to leave the system . this fraction may be less than unity because the primary stars lose more mass during a nova outburst than was lost since the previous outburst . we make a generic case of the existence of a caml mechanism , thus avoiding the need to explain its physical nature . other caml mechanisms include a magnetic disk , i . e . a disk containing a rapidly rotating magnetic wd where some of the nova mass gains its momentum from the wd spin through interaction with the wd s magnetic field ( see e . g . wynn , jones & horne 1997 ) , and an electric disc , ( see e . g . livio & pringle 1994 ) . our caml model generally uses the notationof king & kolb ( 1995 ) . the secondary is assumed to be lost via mass loss that is non - linear with respect to an axis not centered on the wd axis but perpendicular to the galactic plane . we define @ xmath19 as the total amount of mass lost from the secondary that leaves the system . we assume then that a fraction @ xmath20 ( @ xmath21 ) of the secondary mass leaves the system with some fraction @ xmath22 of the angular momentum it lost in leaving the @ xmath4 system . we also consider mass that is lost from the secondary via secondary mass loss , which in the long term can be interpreted as an isotropic wind from the primary ( see e . g . kolb et al . this material will carry away the total orbital angular momentum of the primary and will account for the fraction ( @ xmath23 ) of the mass loss . we then define _ caml = b ^ 2 _ 2 + , where we define @ xmath24 as the caml constant . for comparison with king & kolb ( 1995 ) we equate this to [ eq : jdotcaml ] _ caml = j , > 1 , and to [ e##q : nufinal ] = ( - + q ) ( ) ^ 2 + . for our calculations given above we use the formula , - + - , ^ 2 = . this is an extension of the formula given by kopal ( 1959 ) and is accurate to within 1 % of the range @ xmath25 . in this way we give examples of the long - term evolution of systems as they grow and evolve beyond the period minimum . for the computations we use the genetic code of mazzitelli ( 1989 ) , adapted to cvs by kolb & ritter ( 1992 ) . both of these data sequences are the basis for the two cv ##s distributions we present in figure [ comptest ] below . we modeled the evolution of individual systems that were adapted to caml according to figures [ eq : jdotcaml ] and [ fig : nufinal ] . we chose @ xmath26 and the minimum bounce @ xmath27 , with the distribution of caml and @ xmath28 as shown in figure [ fig : fullcaml ] . the systems initially evolve from the periods towards the maximum bounce ( right to left ) at a constant mass - rate . the maximum bounce decreases with thecaml increases to a maximum of around 90 % for @ xmath29 . mass transfer stability sets an upper limit on the caml efficiency . an obvious upper limit is zero , where only the angular momentum of the transferred material is ejected from the system . although the transferred material may lose more angular momentum than is transferred ( as in the case of a spin system where the angular momentum is extracted from the spin of the wd ) this does not mean the total loss of the angular momentum . the maximum caml efficiency still compatible with mass transfer stability could be greater than zero . the stability of @ xmath30 which is the equation for steady - state mass transfer , equation [ fig : stab ] ( e . g . king & kolb 1995 ) may be greater than zero ; this sets an upper limit for @ xmath31 . [ eq : 2 ] - _ 1 = - _ 2 ( ) a plot of @ xmath30 against @ xmath32 for an initially marginally stable system ( @ xmath33 , @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 ) is given by equation [ fig : dq ] . the system initially exhibits cycles of high mass transfer when @ xmath36 ( @ xmath##30 close to 0 ) and a low mass transfer rate @ xmath37 . the two periods are short lived , on the order of @ xmath38 years ( see figure [ 1 : highmdot ] ) . the period finally ends with @ xmath39 . the time @ xmath40 @ xmath30 continues to vary , but eventually remains constant , peaking at a value around @ xmath41 . the tidal deformation of the secondary may have an effect on the period minimum . calculations by renvoiz , baraffe , kolb & ritter ( 2002 ) , [ see also kolb 2002 ] using 3dimensional sph , suggest that the secondary is moving in the non - spherical roche potential such that its gravitational potential radius is about 1 . 06 times that of the primary star in orbit . we express this effect in our 1 - dimensional fine structure code by multiplying the calculated radius by a factor of @ xmath42 . the mass transfer rate is calculated from the difference between the radius and the roche potential , via - _ - = _ - ( - ) . here @ xmath43 is the mass transfer rate of a star in which the secondary fully reaches its roche potential and @ x##math44 = the photospheric - maximum height of the star ( see e . g . ritter 1988 ) . figure [ by : barraffe ] shows the effects on the minimum period and mass transfer rate for stars with different deformation factors @ xmath42 , ranging from 1 ( zero deformation ) to 1 . 18 . the mass transfer rate is expected to decrease with increasing mass . this can be seen from the observed effects on the period and donor mass of the classical quadrupole formula for the am ##r component due to gamma radiation ( see e . g . miller & lifschitz 1958 ) . although the quadrupole formula is generally valid only if the components are point masses , rezzolla , ury & yoshida ( 2001 ) found that the gr ##c obtained using a full 3 - dimensional model of the neutron star differs from the point mass rate by more than a few percent . it can be seen from the figure that with the deformation factor 1 . 06 the minimum period varies from around 50 min to around 100 min , consistent with renvoiz et al ( 2002 ) for geometrical parameters alone . a deformation factor of around 1 . 18 is expected to raise the minimum period to the observed value of @ xmath45 min . this ismuch lower than the theoretical expectation ( ) ^ = ( ) ^ = 1 . 06 from kepler - law and roche theory . in our calculations we consider the special case in which only the external thermal effects are taken into account . the inclusion of the thermal effects considered by renvoiz et al ( 2002 ) have the net effect of reducing @ xmath9 , possibly by about 2 % compared to the case with quantum mechanical . one additional physical factor that could cause the deformation down to the value of 1 . 06 is magnetic fields inside the system , as suggested by dantona ( 2000 ) . we note that patterson ( 2000 ) claims to find observational evidence for ` ` ` ' ' systems in short period c . on the basis of the mass estimates from the initial superhump excess , he concluded that the donors have @ xmath46 larger mass than those from two dimensional . , or deformed , models if gravitational radiation is the only possible sink . even if true , this observation can not distinguish between an intrinsic equilibrium of the donor system and the non - equilibrium caused by orbital am ##s in excess of the gr rate . to prove the statistical validity of the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems at the period c ( ` `period distribution ' ' ) we use the probability distribution of model systems for making assumptions about evolutionary rates . for each system a series of random tracks are generated , typically around 0 . the tracks evolve after the minimum period a point is reached ( or when @ xmath47 falls behind @ xmath48 ) where the changes in @ xmath47 become so large that the henyey scheme no longer converges . the stellar model uses tables to calculate / update the opacities and equation of motion for each track , and in this case the results are increasingly uncertain . to extend the model we used a semi - empirical method as follows . the tracks are terminated at a value of @ xmath49 , where @ xmath50 is the energy transfer rate at the minimum period for the track . the radius of the star for the final part of the track is given by r _ 2 = r _ 0m _ 2 ^ , where @ xmath51 and @ xmath52 are assumed to be constant . the values of @ xmath51 and @ xmath52 were calculated from the final few data points for each track . ( @ xmath52 has a typical value of around 0 . 5for systems with the period bounce . ) to generate the parameters to the system we first generate @ xmath7 from the roche lobe condition , and @ xmath53 from the stationarity condition . figure [ minpnumeric ] ( see figure [ combined ] , middle section for an example of an extended algorithm ) . we weight the probability of detection to the two systems by 1 , 000 . 5 . for the detection probability . we tested the same detection probability distribution for various values of the unknown parameter @ xmath54 against the corresponding cv ##e distribution . a k - s ( kolmogorov - smirnov ) test is applied to the differences between the model distributions . the greatest differences in the cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) of the parent and child distributions occur at the boundaries of the cdfs , i . e . in the least sensitive region for the k - s test ( ritter et al 1992 ) . we then decided to use the slightly modified @ xmath55 test . for each model , 10000 model distributions out of 134 systems were generated . ; ritter & kolb 1998 , internal report june 2001 , as of january 2002 the number of systems in this period distribution is only 152 though this may affect the values of .the @ xmath55 test , the trends and all the results . . ] the sample was tested against the model parent distribution in a @ xmath55 range , with 1 , 2 and 3 minute bins . this range bridges the gap for good accuracy and significance of the @ xmath55 test which requires a minimum number of cvs per bin . the observed child distribution was tested against the model parent distribution also , giving the reduced @ xmath55 value @ xmath56 . the fraction @ xmath22 of generated samples with a reduced @ xmath55 value less than @ xmath56 is used as a measure of the rejection level of rejecting the hypothesis that the child distribution is different from the parent distribution . in the following we calculate the rejection level as = @ xmath22 . kolb & baraffe ( 1999 ) found that the observed distribution of non - magnetic cvs ( figure [ fig : mnmcvs ] , left frame ) , and the observed distribution of magnetic cvs ( figure [ fig : mnmcvs ] , right frame ) show no significant differences in the period distribution . to test and quantify this we calculate these distributions for @ xmath57 min , giving the reduced @xmath55 consists of 0 . 1213 . hence we can not rule out that the distributions are derived from the same underlying parent distribution . this is borne out by the results of comparing both distributions with a new distribution that is called : @ xmath7 ( see the table [ tab : tabcomb ] , # f and g ) which give the rejection ##s ( pr = 0 . 709 and pr = 0 . 781 , respectively ) . we can see no significant difference between the two distributions . in the following we will compare them against the combined magnetic and non - magnetic properties of magnetic materials . the absence of any flat features in the combined observed period distribution ( see [ fig : mnmcvs ] , reference 1 ) does not suggest an essentially flat distribution for the underlying parent distribution . the flat distribution gives pr = 0 . 552 ( for the 1 - bin width , see table [ tab : tabcomb ] ) . we use this value as a benchmark for the models described below . [ pr = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] king , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) found a ( nearly ) uniform probability distribution by superimposing individual idealized pdfswith different bounce periods @ xmath58 according to a more appropriate method . for the two ring - shaped idealised pdfs represented by the pdf shown in our figure [ 1 ] ( lower case ) the required range is @ xmath59 $ ] ( @ xmath60 is the observed bounce period ) . this weighting method effectively preserves the shape of the individual peaked individual pdfs . king et al . ( 2002 ) showed that the range @ xmath61 is sufficient to wash out the peak spike . it is clear that this method involves a certain degree of fine - tuning for @ xmath62 if the shape of the observed pdf is known . such a fine - tuning cannot occur as the two parameters involved here are two very different statistical parameters . we applied the range @ xmath62 quoted in king et al . ( 2002 ) to our non - idealized model pdfs that used the caml efficiency and the scale factor as a parameter to vary @ xmath58 . the weighting produced a much worse result ( @ xmath63 versus @ xmath64 ; 1 % better ) for the caml pdfs compared to the original model based on the observed camlthe spectrum we discussed earlier . in part this is due to the fact that the upper limit of @ xmath31 does not cover the full dynamic range of @ xmath58 . in the case of the deformation factor pdfs the fit marginally improved ( @ xmath65 versus @ xmath66 ; non - binning , @ xmath67 ) . it is possible to improve the fit by adding systems with deformation factors up to 1 . 5 , and by increasing the [ @ xmath68 $ ] , but this still leaves the fairly large value @ xmath69 ( see also figure [ fig : kings ] ) . however , adding a # ##age is inconsistent with the age gap for longer periods . this can be seen from figure [ fig : barraffe ] systems that are subject to larger deformation factors would fit into the age gap , hence the gap would be populated in this model . for completeness we show in figure [ fig : grsum1 ] the behaviour of the system suggested by king , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) if real rather than idealised pdfs are used . this model assumes no significant a ##f ( @ xmath70 ; @ caml ,( deformation effects , @ xmath71 ) , the coupling parameter for varying @ xmath58 , and the energy as in king et al . the main feature of above 2 min bounce period is the result of the chemical reaction of the donor molecule and turn - on of mass transfer ( see e . g . ritter & kolb 1992 ) . such a mechanism is absent from the observed distribution . if these effects were taken into account the predicted am losses required to wash out the @ xmath9 spike would cover a similar period but at a different rate . the resulting observed distribution would be similar to the one shown in figure [ fig : grsum1 ] we have investigated mechanisms that could reduce the bounce period for cvs from the expected theoretical value @ xmath0 min to the observed value @ xmath72 min , and also to wash out the theoretically predicted spikes of systems near the bounce period ( the average spike ) . unlike ritter , schenker & hameury 2002 we focus on effects other than the systemic angular momentum ( am ) loss , i . e . we assume that gravitational attraction is the only possible source of orbital energy . we assume that at the maximal ##ly # energy loss ( cam##l ) mechanism can not estimate the bounce period minimum . as the real cv population is likely to include systems with a minimum of caml , we would in this case expect to have a distribution of systems down to @ xmath0 ##9 , rather than the actual time cut - off . we have donor stars that are ` ` bloated ' ' due to intrinsic factors , such as the tidal effects seen in ultra - dim . sph simulations of roche - type filling ##s . an extremely large deformation factor of about 1 . 18 is required to achieve a bounce period of @ xmath45 min . a possible alternative interpretation of @ xmath9 as an age bounce rather than a mass bounce ( king & schenker 2002 ) would limit the donor mass in any cv in a cv population dominated by metal poor , unevolved stars to @ xmath73 . any system with donor mass values less than this would either have an orbital period greater than 78 days or would have already evolved beyond the period minimum . there are indeed systems with suspected @ xmath74 ; notable examples are wz sge ( @ xmath75 ; patterson et al 1998 ) and oy car ( @ xmath76 ;pratt et al . 1999 ) . it is also possible that systems decay or disappear before reaching the period bounce , and thus are known as cvs . the fact that the two different groups of non - electric and magnetic systems show almost identical values of @ xmath9 ( see figure [ fig : mnmcvs ] ) strongly suggests that the physical cause for the potential fading would have to be rooted in the donor physics or the evolution rather than the decay processes or emission processes of the systems . even if the full period bounce is observed we see in all the model populations ( except for the magnitude limit model ) a pronounced remaining effect due to the accumulation of energy near the bounce . we used a modified @ xmath55 test to measure the ` ` strength ' ' of systems against the original sample . an f - test ( pratt et al 1992 ) was also applied to the population of @ xmath77 models and the same general trends observed . none of our synthesized model populations fits as well to the distribution which is relatively flat for bounce periods ( with probability @ xmath78 ) . only populations where the systems have a far greater strength than expected from a typical magnitude limit model ( scale probability @ xmath79 with@ xmath80 ( than @ xmath81 ) gives similar results for @ xmath82 . however , most of our models with @ xmath83 canot are rejected unambiguously on the basis of this uncertainty . models attempting to ` ` smooth out ' ' the period gap by introducing a small spread of the caml distribution do much better than those models based on donor masses that are subject to a large spread of orbital deformation ##s . for all systems the bounce probability decreases if the full wd ##v distribution is taken into account , as this introduces an additional spread of the bounce rate . population populations where all systems form at long time periods ( chiefly above the period gap ) give a generally better result than models that model newborn cvs with low donor mass . adding these systems to the population introduces a general trend of the orbital energy density towards short periods , thus making the period spike more pronounced . this suggests that most systems must have formed over long periods and evolved through the period gap to become short - period systems . this is consistent with the evidence that most young systems have already evolved ( baraffe & kolb 2000 ; schenker et al . 2002 ; thorstensen et al 2002 ) . recently , king, schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) constructed a flat bounce period distribution by superimposing two pdfs that describe populations of systems with a fixed initial donor mass and fixed wd mass , but different bounce periods . this experiment produced a strongly increasing number of systems with increasing bounce periods . we repeated this experiment with a realistic pdf , but failed to produce a markedly improved fit . in conclusion , we conclude that the period minimum problem and the period spike problem remain an open issue . it is possible to construct cv model , where the period maximum is washed out sufficiently much that it can easily be ruled out , on the basis of an objective statisticial test against the observed cv period distribution . we thank graham wynn , david king and isabelle baraffe for helpful comments . andrew conway and chris jones also gave advice on the same method . we also thank andrew norton for a good reading of the paper and the referee jean - marie hameury for helpful comments .
