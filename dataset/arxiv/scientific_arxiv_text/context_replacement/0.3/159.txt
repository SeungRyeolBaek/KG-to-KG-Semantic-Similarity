we can consider simple and simple graphs . let @ xmath1 be a graph with vertex set @ xmath4 and edge set @ xmath5 . a perfect matching or 1 - matching @ xmath0 of a graph @ xmath1 is a set of edges of @ xmath1 such that each vertex of @ xmath1 is incident with exactly one edge in @ xmath0 . a kekul structure of a molecular structure ( for example , water and alcohol ) starts with a perfect matching of the graph . randi and klein @ xcite proposed the _ _ number of symmetry _ of a kekul structure , i . e . the total number of chemical bonds can determine this particular molecular structure , and it is called the forcing number of harary et al . @ xcite . the _ forcing set _ @ xmath6 of a perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath1 is the subset of @ xmath0 such that @ xmath6 is contained in all other perfect matchings of @ xmath1 . the _ forcing number _ of @ xmath0 is the forcing number over all forcing sets of @ xmat##h0 , denoted by @ xmath7 . an edge of @ xmath1 is called an _ forcing edge _ if it is simultaneously in exactly one perfect matching of @ xmath1 . the _ _ _ _ ( _ ) _ forcing number _ of @ xmath1 is the minimum ( resp . maximum ) value of the numbers of all perfect matchings of @ xmath1 , denoted by @ xmath8 ( resp . @ xmath9 ) . in general to find the maximum forcing number of a graph with the maximum value of is an np - complete problem @ xcite . let @ xmath0 be a perfect matching of the graph @ xmath1 . a subset @ xmath10 of @ xmath1 is called a _ @ xmath0 - alternating cycle _ if the edges of @ xmath10 are simultaneously in @ xmath0 and @ xmath11 . @ xcite [ 2 ] a subset @ xmath12 is a forcing set of @ xmath0 if and only if every @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 contains at least one edge of @ xmath6 . for a subset##partite graphs , pachter and kim obtained the following minimax theorem by using lucchesi and ' s result on cycles @ xcite . [ cycle ] @ xcite let @ xmath0 be a perfect cycle in the complete bipartite graph @ xmath1 . let @ xmath13 , where @ xmath14 is the maximum number of disjoint @ xmath0 - alternating cycles of @ xmath1 . a perfect system ( or benzenoid ) is a simply - connected finite plane graph such that every vertex face is a regular cycle of side length one . it can also be defined as a cycle with an interior in the corresponding binary system in the plane ( graphene ) . a perfect system with a perfect matching is defined as the n - skeleton of a benzenoid hydrocarbon . let @ xmath3 be a hexagonal system with a perfect matching @ xmath0 . a set of _ _ _ @ xmath0 - alternating hexagons of @ xmath3 is called an @ xmath0 - _ _ _ _ . a set of @ xmath0- alternating set of @ xmath3 ( the intersection is 0 ) is called an @ xmath0 - _ fries set _ . a maximum alternating set of @ xmath3 over all perfect matchings is a _ clar number _ of _ clar set _ , and its size is the _ clar number _ of @ xmath3 , denoted by @ xmath15 ( ) . a fries set of @ xmath3 is a maximum alternating set of @ xmath3 over all perfect matchings and the fries number of @ xmath3 , denoted by @ xmath16 , is the size of a fries set of @ xmath3 . the clar number and fries number can measure the number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons @ xcite . @ xcite [ clar ] let @ xmath3 be a complete graph . then @ xmath17 . in this case we define the anti - crossing number of a graph , which was first defined by vukievi and trinajsti @ xcite as the maximum number of edges whose removal results in a subgraph with a single perfect matching ( see also @ xcitefor some more on this section ) . in an analogous manner to the forcing number we define the anti - forcing number , denoted by @ xmath2 , of a perfect matching @ xmath0 of a graph @ xmath1 as the minimum number of vertices not in @ xmath0 whose removal to fix a new perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath1 . we also see that the anti - forcing number of a graph @ xmath1 is the maximum anti - forcing number of all perfect matchings of @ xmath1 . we also see that the anti - forcing number has a close relationship with forcing number : for any perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath1 , @ xmath18 , where @ xmath19 is the maximum degree of @ xmath1 . for any regular graph @ xmath1 , we obtain the minimax relation : for any perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath1 , the anti - forcing number of @ xmath0 is the maximal number of @ xmath0 - alternating cycles of @ xmath1 , two copies of which meet only at vertices in @ xmath0 . forfor given graph @ xmath3 , we show that the _ anti - forcing number of @ xmath3 equals the fries number of @ xmath3 . as a result , we have that the fries number of @ xmath3 lies between the clar ##cs of @ xmath3 and 3 . thus for the extremal information about the anti - forcing numbers show the anti - forcing set of a graph @ xmath1 with the maximum degree that can be the maximum forcing number or more . the anti - forcing set @ xmath6 of a graph @ xmath1 is a set of cycles of @ xmath1 such that @ xmath20 is a unique perfect matching . the maximum cardinality of anti - forcing sets of @ xmath1 is called the _ anti - forcing set _ of @ xmath1 and denoted by @ xmath21 . given the perfect matching @ xmath0 of a graph @ xmath1 . if @ xmath10 is an @ xmath0 - alternating matching of @ xmath1 , then the symmetric matching @ xmath22 is a perfect matching of @ xmath1 . then @ xmath##10 can be viewed as its edge - complement . a subset @ xmath23 is called an anti - forcing set of @ xmath0 if @ xmath20 has a unique perfect matching , that is , @ xmath0 . [ anti ] the set @ xmath6 of edges of @ xmath1 contained in @ xmath0 is an anti - forcing set of @ xmath0 if and only if @ xmath6 contains at least one edge of every @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 . if @ xmath6 is an anti - forcing set of @ xmath0 , then @ xmath20 has a unique perfect matching , i . e . @ xmath0 . hence @ xmath20 is an @ xmath0 - alternating cycle . similarly , if @ xmath20 has no @ xmath0 - alternating cycle @ xmath10 , then the corresponding subset @ xmath22 has another perfect matching of @ xmath20 different from @ xmath0 , a contradiction . hence every @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 contains at least one edge of @ xmat##h6 . similarly , suppose that @ xmath6 has at most perfect matching of each @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 . that is , @ xmath20 has no @ xmath0 - alternating cycles , but @ xmath20 has a unique perfect matching . the maximum number of anti - forcing sets of @ xmath0 is called the anti - forcing number of @ xmath0 and denoted by @ xmath2 . then we have the following relations for the forcing set and anti - forcing number . [ 1 ] let @ xmath1 be a graph with the maximum degree @ xmath19 . for any perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath1 , we have @ xmath24 for each anti - forcing set @ xmath6 of @ xmath0 . for each edge @ xmath25 in @ xmath6 , let @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 be the edges in @ xmath0 belonging to @ xmath25 . all other edges @ xmath25 and @ xmath6 are replaced with edges of @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 toget the set @ xmath28 of edges in @ xmath0 . it is obvious that @ xmath29 . now we say that @ xmath28 is a forcing set of @ xmath0 . for each @ xmath0 - alternating pair @ xmath10 of @ xmath1 , by lemma [ forcing ] @ xmath10 must contain one edge @ xmath25 in @ xmath6 . then @ xmath10 must pass through both @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 . by the definition for @ xmath28 , @ xmath10 contains at least one edge of @ xmath28 . so , [ forcing ] says that @ xmath28 is a forcing set of @ xmath0 . hence the inequality holds . then @ xmath30 , and the first inequality is true . now we get the second inequality . let @ xmath31 be a complete forcing set of @ xmath0 . then @ xmath32 . for each edge @ xmath25 in @ xmath31 , we consider all the edges not in @ xmath0 incident with an edge of @ xmath##25 . all such cycles form a set @ xmath33 of size no larger than @ xmath34 , which is identified with @ xmath0 . we claim that @ xmath33 is an anti - forcing set of @ xmath0 . however , theorem [ anti ] states that @ xmath35 is an @ xmath0 - spanning tree @ xmath10 . since each edge of @ xmath31 is a single edge of @ xmath35 , @ xmath10 does not pass through an edge of @ xmath31 . this implies that @ xmath31 is a forcing set of @ xmath0 . theorem [ anti ] . define @ xmath36 . @ xmath37 . by the definition the following result is true . thus we can say , @ xmath21 is the _ maximum anti - forcing number _ of @ xmath1 . whereas , @ xmath38 is the _ maximum anti - forcing number _ of @ xmath1 . the following is an alternative proof of theorem [ anti ] . [ bound ] let @ xmath1 be a graph with a perfect matching and the highest degree@ xmath19 . , @ xmath39 . , @ xmath40 and @ xmath41 are called the _ forcing spectrum _ @ xcite and the _ anti - forcing spectrum _ of @ xmath1 respectively . for example , @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 ( see fig . [ spec ] ( a ) ) , @ xmath44 @ xcite ( see fig . [ spec ] ( b ) ) . randi and vukievi @ xcite studied the distributions of forcing spectra of kekul and of @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 respectively . for a finite set @ xmath1 with a perfect matching @ xmath0 , we also have the anti - forcing number @ xmath2 . if @ xmath1 has two @ xmath0 - alternating cycles that either are disconnected or exist only at edges of @ xmath0 , then by definition [ anti ] _ anti - forcing spectrum of @ xmath0 contains an edge of exactly one of the @ xmath0 - alternating cycles . thus it therefore allows us to find a novel solution : a matching @ xmath47 of @xmath0 - alternating sets of @ xmath1 are _ a _ compatible @ xmath0 - alternating set _ if any two members of @ xmath47 either are identical or intersect only at points in @ xmath0 . let @ xmath48 denote the maximum number of all @ xmath0 - alternating sets of @ xmath1 . using the above definition we have the following immediate result . [ ineqality ] for every perfect matching @ xmath0 of a graph @ xmath1 , we have @ xmath49 . for all directed graphs @ xmath1 we can see that the result of the above lemma always holds . the vertices of @ xmath1 are colored with red and black such that every pair of adjacent vertices receive two colors . such two color pairs form a bipartition of @ xmath1 . [ minimax ] let @ xmath1 be a directed bipartite graph with a perfect matching @ xmath0 . then @ xmath50 to obtain such a minimax result we need a previous result of lucchesi and younger @ xcite for directed graphs ; its original proof wasever consider a lovsz @ xcite . let @ xmath51 be a finite directed graph . feedback set _ of @ xmath51 is the set of arcs that contain at least one arc of a directed cycle of @ xmath51 . @ xcite [ ly ] for any finite directed graph , a finite feedback set has cardinality equal to that of the maximum collection of arc - disjoint directed graphs . _ proof of theorem [ minimax ] . _ first assign a new orientation of @ xmath1 concerning @ xmath0 to be a digraph @ xmath52 : each edge of @ xmath0 is directed from white end to black end , and the edges of in @ xmath0 are directed from black ends to white ends . obviously the @ xmath0 - directed cycles of @ xmath1 correspond naturally to the cycles of its orientation . then assign each edge of @ xmath0 in @ xmath52 to a cycle ( i . e . find the cycle and identify its ends ) to get a new orientation , denoted by @ xmath53 . we can show that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the @ x##math0 - alternating cycles of @ xmath1 and directed cycles of @ xmath53 . that is , an @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 is a directed cycle @ xmath53 , and a directed cycle of @ xmath53 can become an @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 when a vertex is restored to an edge of @ xmath0 . then by theorem [ 2 ] a compatible @ xmath23 is an anti - clockwise subset of @ xmath0 if and only if @ xmath6 is a feedback set of @ xmath53 . thus @ xmath2 has the maximum cardinality of feedback sets of @ xmath53 . on the other hand , a compatible @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 corresponds to a set of arc - independent directed cycles of @ xmath53 . that means that @ xmath48 has the maximum number of arc - independent directed cycles of @ xmath53 . note that @ xmath53 is a planar graph . by theorem [ ly ] , @ xmath54 . @xmath55 0 . 2 . however , the statement in bold [ ineqality ] does not always hold in general . the proof is simple ( see fig . [ 1 ] ( 2 ) ) ; for this particular perfect matching given by # ##er , it can be shown that there are at most two such alternating cycles , but its anti - forcing number is at most one . in this proof we extend our consideration to a hexagonal system @ xmath3 with a perfect matching @ xmath0 . without loss of generality , @ xmath3 is placed in the plane such that the x - axis is vertical and the peaks ( i . e . those peaks of @ xmath3 that each have two low neighbors , and no high neighbors ) are parallel . an @ xmath0 - alternating cycle @ xmath10 of @ xmath3 is said to be _ odd _ ( resp . _ improper _ ) if an edge of @ xmath10 in @ xmath0 goes from white end to black end ( resp . from black end to white end ) along the opposite direction of @ xmath10 . the order of @ xmath3 is theboundary of the outer face . every edge on the boundary is a free edge . the following general result is that the resulting non - forcing number equals the forcing number of any hexagonal system . [ 1 ] let @ xmath3 be a perfect system with a perfect matching . then @ xmath56 . since the alternating set of @ xmath3 is a compatible @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath47 for any perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 , we have that @ xmath57 from to [ minimax ] . so we can prove that @ xmath58 . it follows to show that for any compatible alternating set @ xmath47 of @ xmath3 with @ xmath59 , we can find a fries set @ xmath31 of @ xmath3 with that @ xmath60 . for any compatible @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath47 of @ xmath3 with a perfect matching @ xmath0 . the sets @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 of @ xmath47 have _ crossing _ if they share an edge @ xmath25then @ xmath0 and the two edges belonging to @ xmath25 are between @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 ( i . e . @ xmath61 enters into @ xmath62 from one side and exits from the other side via @ xmath25 ) . such an edge @ xmath25 is said to be non crossing . for example , see below . we have @ xmath47 = _ non - crossing _ if the two edges in @ xmath47 are non crossing . - two edges @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 ( bold edges represent edges in @ xmath0 ) . ] * = 1 . * for each compatible @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath47 of @ xmath3 , we can find the unique non - crossing set @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath63 of @ xmath3 such that @ xmath64 . * @ xmath47 has odd pairs of crossing between @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 . in fact @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 have even pairs of2 . let @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 have two other vertices , which are not in @ xmath0 . then we can see that the counterclockwise direction @ xmath62 from to @ xmath65 goes into the edge of @ xmath61 , and then the edge @ xmath66 . suppose that @ xmath67 is the first vertex of @ xmath62 leaving from @ xmath61 and @ xmath68 the first vertex of @ xmath62 leaving from @ xmath61 after @ xmath67 . for example , if the edge @ xmath10 in @ xmath3 has two vertices @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 , we can denote by @ xmath71 the path from @ xmath69 to @ xmath70 along @ xmath10 ##1 . if @ xmath61 is a proper @ xmath0 - alternating cycle and @ xmath62 is an improper @ xmath0 - alternating cycle , let @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 ( 2 ) .2 ( right ) ) . if @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 in are compatible ( resp . improper ) @ xmath0 - alternating cycles , let @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 ( see fig . 2 ( right ) ) . in these three cases @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 in @ xmath47 can be combined with @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 to form a new compatible @ xmath0 - alternating set of @ xmath3 and thus a pair of cycles @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 exists . since such a pair does not produce any more crossings , by repeating the same cycle we finally get a compatible @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath63 of @ xmath3 that is non - incompatible . it is obvious that @ xmath64 . for each cycle @ xmath10 of @ xmath3 , let @ xmath78 be the number of crossings in the set of @ xmath10 . by doing this we can get a perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath3and a maximum compatible @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath47 such that ( i ) @ xmath59 and ( ii ) @ xmath47 are non - minimal , and @ xmath79 is as minimal as possible according to ( i ) and ( ii ) . we call @ xmath80 the @ xmath81 - _ interior _ of @ xmath47 . by the following theorem we know that for any two cycles in @ xmath47 their interiors either are identical or each contains the other cycle . hence the cycles in @ xmath47 have a _ poset _ according to the equivalence relation of their interiors . since every @ xmath0 - alternating set has an @ xmath0 - alternating set in its interior ( cf . @ xcite ) , we can make the following claim . * theorem 1 . * every minimal member of @ xmath47 is a cycle . it follows to prove that all members of @ xmath47 are hexagons . note to the contrary that @ xmath47 has at least one non - minimal member . let @ xmath10 have a minimal member- is contained in @ xmath47 .

( for a survey of independent domination , see @ xcite ) for any perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 , by theorem [ 1 ] we have that @ xmath172 . note that @ xmath3 contains no other vertices . since each @ xmath0 - alternating vertex of @ xmath3 has an @ xmath0 - alternating hexagon in its interior , @ xmath14 equals the maximum number of disjoint @ xmath0 - alternating vertices of @ xmath3 . it is known that for each hexa##gon of @ xmath3 a non - fusing edge belongs to @ xmath0 if and only if the three non - joining edges belong to @ xmath0 . choose a maximum subset @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 such that @ xmath173 . let @ xmath6 be a maximum set of independent @ xmath0 - alternating sets of @ xmath3 and @ xmath174 . then @ xmath175 . we say that @ xmath176 is an independent maximum set of @ xmath158 . let @ xmath81 be a subset of @ xmath3 contained in @ xmath6 . if some subset @ xmath177 of @ xmath3 adjacent to @ xmath81 matches the three non - joining edges of @ xmath0 , then @ xmath178 . therefore , @ xmath81 is an @ xmath0 - alternating set . since @ xmath179 and @ xmath6 are independent , any hexagon of @ xmath3 adjacent to@ xmath81 must belong to @ xmath6 . if the claim holds , and @ xmath180 . then , . the unique minimum possible set @ xmath176 of @ xmath158 . is a perfect matching @ xmath181 of @ xmath3 as follows . the three non - adjacent edges of each vertex of @ xmath6 are known as edges of @ xmath181 . for any edge of @ xmath3 not in @ xmath6 , any single edge that is a single edge not connected with the other hexagon ##s in @ xmath6 is also an edge of @ xmath181 . so we can see that @ xmath181 is a perfect matching of @ xmath3 and any hexagon of @ xmath3 not in @ xmath6 is not @ xmath181 - alternating . so @ xmath6 is the minimum set of @ xmath181 - alternating hexagons of @ xmath3 . so @ xmath182 . = @ xmath183 . according to the above definition ,@ xmath6 is the set of all @ xmath181 - colored copies of @ xmath3 . hence @ xmath184 . on the other hand , for a perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 , @ xmath185 , and thus @ xmath186 . these conditions imply the second inequality . beyer et al . @ xcite gave an algorithm of linear time to compute the independent forcing number of a tree . only the minimum forcing numbers of all - kink catahexes can be computed in linear time . for example , fig . [ cata ] shows the minimum forcing number of two all - kink catahexes . but the anti - forcing number of an all - edge catahex can be larger than the minimum forcing number ; for example , the triphenylene has the minimum forcing number 1 and the anti - forcing number 2 ( see fig . [ spec ] ( a ) ) . integers @ xcite gave the structure of binary trees with an anti - forcing edge ( i . e . an edge that itself forms an anti - forcing edge ) . for integers @ xmath188 , let@ xmath189 is a hexagonal graph with @ xmath190 the rows of @ xmath188 hexagons and one hexagon of each row are shown below and to the right of the first row of the previous row , and we call it _ truncated parallelogram _ @ xcite ; for details , see fig . [ para ] . in fact , @ xmath191 with @ xmath192 and @ xmath193 and @ xmath194 with @ xmath193 are linear and linear chains respectively . note that a truncated graph can be constructed and modified in three ways . namely , a single hexagon has three anti - forcing edges , a linear chain has four anti - forcing edges , and a parallelogram has two anti - forcing edges . a true truncated graph has just one anti - forcing edge ( see fig . [ para ] ) . in the following we can give a construction for hexagonal systems with the anti - forcing property 2 . see more preliminary information needed . let @ xmath1 be a connected , bipartite graph . each edge of @ xmath1 is said to be _ fixedsingle _ _ ( _ ) if it belongs to no ( resp . all ) perfect matchings of @ xmath1 . @ xmath1 is _ normal _ or _ normal _ if @ xmath1 has no fixed normal block . the non - normal edges of @ xmath1 form a subgraph whose components are normal and thus simply - connected components , which are called _ normal components _ of @ xmath1 . further , a normal component of @ xmath1 is _ a _ normal block _ if it is formed by a pair of @ xmath1 with normal neighbors . a pendant vertex of a graph is a vertex of degree one , and its single edge is a normal vertex . @ xcite [ component ] let @ xmath3 be a connected , connected graph with a perfect matching . if all the vertices of @ xmath1 are of the same color and lie at the origin , then @ xmath1 has at least one normal block . if @ xmath1 has a normal single edge and @ xmath197 , then @ xmath1 has at least two normal blocks . let @ xmath3 be a connected graph with a perfect matching. let @ xmath198 be a set of parallel edges of @ xmath3 such that @ xmath199 and @ xmath200 belong to the same set and the @ xmath26 and @ xmath201 are parallel edges . then @ xmath202 is the edge - complement of @ xmath3 and @ xmath203 is optimal for all edge matchings @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 . by theorem [ component ] @ xmath3 has at least two normal components . a normal component is a diagonal matrix with the anti - forcing number at least one . note that the anti - forcing number of @ xmath3 equals the sum of the anti - forcing numbers of such normal components . hence @ xmath204 if and only if @ xmath3 has exactly two normal components , which are truncated parallelograms . theorem [ component ] . [ af2 ] let @ xmath3 be a normal component of . hence @ xmath204 if and only if @ xmath3 is not a parallelogram and @ xmath3 can be constructed by gluing .truncated edges @ xmath205 and @ xmath206 have their two edges form a fused path @ xmath207 of equal length such that + ( i ) an edge - less edge of @ xmath205 lies on the edge , + ( ii ) the hexagons of edge @ xmath208 with an edge of @ xmath207 form a linear chain or a chain with one turn ( i . e . the dual dual is a chain with exactly one turning point ) , and + ( iii ) when the fused path @ xmath207 passes an edge @ xmath209 ( or @ xmath210 ) of @ xmath205 , the edges of @ xmath205 ( resp . @ xmath206 ) with an edge of @ xmath207 form a linear chain that contains the first ( or only ) edge of @ xmath205 ( resp . a edge with one kink ) . ( see fig . [ 2 ] ) such that @ xmath204 . then @ xmath3 has distinct edges @ xmath25 and @ xmath##211 states that @ xmath212 has a unique perfect edge @ xmath0 . so by lemma [ unique ] @ xmath82 has two pendant vertices with different colors . the one of @ xmath25 and @ xmath211 , called @ xmath25 , must be a boundary edge of @ xmath3 ; so @ xmath82 has at most one pendant vertex , a contradiction . otherwise , suppose that @ xmath25 has two ends with degree three . then @ xmath213 has the same degree three . if @ xmath213 is 2 - regular , it must be a regular graph rather than truncated graph , so that @ xmath213 has a non - normal edge @ xmath211 . if @ xmath213 has a normal edge , the formula [ component ] @ xmath213 has at most two normal components . so @ xmath214 , is a contradiction , and has 1 only . so @ xmath213 has a pendant vertex @ xmath67 . the edge @ xmath215 between @ xmath67 and @this belongs to all perfect matchings of @ xmath213 , and is therefore anti - forced by @ xmath25 . from the ends of this graph and pendant edges , the pendant edges of the following graph also belong to all perfect matchings of @ xmath213 , and these edges are anti - forced by @ xmath25 . repeating the above steps , until to get a graph without pendant edges , forced by @ xmath216 . if @ xmath216 is forcing , then @ xmath25 is an anti - forcing edge of @ xmath3 , a contradiction . otherwise , @ xmath216 has a perfect matching and the maximum degree is . suppose that the two faces of @ xmath216 are hexagons . using the similar arguments as the proof of claim 1 , we see that @ xmath216 is a forcing graph with an anti - forcing edge @ xmath211 . hence claim 2 holds . without loss of generality , suppose that edge @ xmath25 is from the left - low end @ xmath67 to the right - low end . then @ xmath215 has a forcing edge. let @ xmath69 be the line with edge @ xmath25 , @ xmath217 the vertical edge of @ xmath69 adjacent to @ xmath25 , @ xmath218 the horizontal edge of @ xmath69 adjacent to @ xmath25 . from the edge @ xmath219 of @ xmath69 draw a line parallel to and starting from @ xmath217 ( resp . @ xmath215 ) draw a line of @ xmath210 at @ xmath47 ( resp . , @ xmath209 and @ xmath86 ) note that @ xmath220 ( resp . @ xmath221 ) also passes through edge of @ xmath3 . let @ xmath222 and @ xmath223 be the two edges of @ xmath3 and of edges of @ xmath220 and @ xmath221 ; see ref . [ case1 ] . for the same statement as claim 2 , we need the following statement . in claim 3 we can say that @ xmath3has no edges from parallel to @ xmath222 . let @ xmath225 denote a series of edges in @ xmath222 parallel to @ xmath215 and above @ xmath220 , @ xmath226 denote a series of edges in @ xmath222 parallel to @ xmath218 and above @ xmath220 ( see ref . [ case1 ] ) . then @ xmath227 are anti - forced by @ xmath25 ##0 , and thus belong to @ xmath0 . let @ xmath228 be the chain consisting of the hexagons adjacent to @ xmath222 and not in . if @ xmath229 is a free element of @ xmath3 , then @ xmath230 are also anti - forced by @ xmath25 and thus belong to @ xmath0 . then @ xmath228 is a directed graph with an adjacent edge in @ xmath223 , and thus @ xmath228 has at most two edges as @ xmath222 . otherwise , by the [ constant] we have that the two edges in @ xmath228 are fixed single edges , contradicting that @ xmath3 is fixed . in general , for @ xmath231 let @ xmath232 be the chain consisting of the edges adjacent to @ xmath233 and define x . if @ xmath232 has a # ##s left to the left end hexagon of @ xmath233 , by the same formula as above we have that @ xmath232 is a linear chain with an end vertex in @ xmath223 and the edges in @ xmath232 belonging to @ xmath218 are anti - forced by @ xmath25 and thus belong to @ xmath0 . there are two cases to be considered . in this case there must be an integer @ xmath234 such that for example @ xmath97 , @ xmath235 is a linear chain with an end vertex in @ xmath223 and @ xmath235 has at least two edges in @ xmath236 , but @ xmath232 hasthe hexagon is adjacent to the corresponding end hexagon of @ xmath233 . thus @ xmath3 is a truncated parallelogram , a lattice . along columns @ xmath223 , and along rows @ xmath235 we can write @ xmath237 in parallel and prove the following fact : there must be an element @ xmath238 such that for each @ xmath239 , @ xmath240 is a linear chain with an initial row in @ xmath222 and @ xmath240 and at least two rows in @ xmath241 , and @ xmath242 is the hexagon from below to the lowest hexagon of @ xmath243 ( see fig . 2 ) . then @ xmath233 and @ xmath243 have exactly one hexagon @ xmath244 in common . let @ xmath245 be the center of @ xmath244 , @ xmath63 the center of the lower - left ##most axis of @ xmath233 and @ xmath87 the center of the lowest hevertex of @ xmath246 . hence @ xmath247 is in the subhexagonal region located in right - hand side of the vertex @ xmath248 . let @ xmath205 be the graph consisting of @ xmath249 and @ xmath250 . it is obvious that @ xmath205 is a complete graph , @ xmath205 and @ xmath206 intersect in a path of equal length , and statements ( i ) and ( ii ) hold . * case 2 * . @ xmath3 has hexagons adjacent right to @ xmath223 . let @ xmath252 be the graph consisting of edges of @ xmath3 adjacent right to @ xmath223 . let @ xmath234 be the least vertex such that @ xmath253 is the left ##most hexagon closest to the vertex of @ xmath252 . note that @ xmath234 may be empty . let @ xmath254 have a pair of vertical edges of @ xmath255 on its right side ( see ) . [ case2 ]) . ( the vertices @ xmath256 are edge - connected by @ xmath25 and therefore belong to @ xmath0 . if each @ xmath235 is a linear chain and @ xmath257 has many paths adjacent left to the right - end edge of @ xmath236 , then @ xmath252 is a linear chain that intersect @ xmath223 at a distance of equal length , so @ xmath258 must be a complete parallelogram consisting of @ xmath252 and its right side . thus , using these definitions we have that for each @ xmath97 , @ xmath235 is a linear chain with left end hexagon in @ xmath223 and @ xmath235 has at most many hexagons in @ xmath236 , but @ xmath232 has a path adjacent right to the left end hexagon of @ xmath233 . let @ xmath244 be the right end hexagon of @ xmath233 , @ xmath245 the center of @ xmath244, @ xmath63 the center of the upper - right ##most edge of @ xmath233 and @ xmath87 the center of the edge of @ xmath244 adjacent above to @ xmath259 . then @ xmath247 also lies in @ xmath248 , and @ xmath205 part of @ xmath260 ( see fig . [ case2 ] ) . so the theorem is true . now , suppose that @ xmath3 is obtained from the graph that the theorem describes . we can show that the anti - forcing edge @ xmath25 of @ xmath205 is anti - forcing all edges and single edges of @ xmath205 except for the edge @ xmath207 . that is , @ xmath261 . hence @ xmath262 . since @ xmath3 is a complete parallelogram , @ xmath204 . then we have two ways of obtaining the result of theorem [ af2 ] as shown in fig . [ case ] . the last way has the minimum cycle length 1 . in particular , zhang and wang @ xcite , and hansen and zheng @ xciteand in systems with a single constraint . by comparing systems @ xmath3 with @ xmath262 , we can see that in response to certain sets of constraints , we can have that @ xmath263 . + * acknowledgments * * h . abeledo , j . a . atkinson , unimodularity of the clar mating problem , linear algebra appl . 420 ( 2007 ) 441448 m . wang , m . mahdian , e . s . mahmoodian , on the forced matching number of directed graphs , discrete math . 281 ( 2004 ) 112 . p . afshani , m . hatami , e . s . mahmoodian , on the computation of the forced matching number of graphs , australas . j . combin . 3 ( 2004 ) 147160 . m . beyer , m . proskurowski , m . hedetniemi , m . wang , graph coloring in graphs , congr .
