in quantum information processing , information is stored and processed with a quantum system . a quantum system is always in contact with its external environment , which leads to decoherence of the quantum system . decoherence must be suppressed for the information stored in qubits to remain intact . there are several ways to fight against decoherence . quantum error correction , abriviated as qec hereafter , is one of the most promising candidate to reduce environmental interference , which leads to decoherence @ xcite . by adding additional ancillary qubits , in analogy with classical error correction , it is possible to encode a syndrome qubit to an @ xmath4 - qubit codeword in such a way that an error which occurs in the original quantum channel is identified by having another set of ancillary qubits added for a syndrome error . then the correct codeword is recovered from a codeword or from a possible error by applying a substitution operation , whose exact form is determined by the error syndrome readout . in contrast with the conventional scheme outlined in the previous section , there is a scheme in which neither syndrome - nor syndrome - ancilla qubits are used @ xcite . in particular , in @ xcite, a general efficient scheme was proposed . a data qubit is encoded with the ancilla qubits by the same encoding circuit as the original one , in which a quantum filter is applied to the codeword . subsequently , the inverse of the encoding circuit is applied on a codeword , which also suffers from an error . the resulting state is a linear product of the data qubit state with a known error and the ancilla qubit state . it is possible to correct the data qubit state by using correction gates with the ancilla qubits as target qubits and the data qubit as a target qubit . this article presents some examples of error correction codes falling into the second category . the original quantum channel is assumed to be strongly correlated @ xcite , which means all the qubits in the codeword are subject to the same error operator . in most physical models of a quantum channel , the register size is typically on the order of a few centimeters or less , while the background noise , such as a wave , has a size on the order of a few millimeters or centimeters . thus it is reasonable to assume all the qubits in the register suffer from the same error operator . to demonstratethe case of the second case , we restrict ourselves to the unitary operators @ xmath7 in the channel , where @ xmath3 is the number of possible qubits in the codeword . we assume that there is an @ xmath4 - qubit encoding which accommodates an @ xmath5 - qubit date state if @ xmath4 is odd and an @ xmath6 - qubit date state if @ xmath4 is even . although the channel is somewhat similar as an ordinary channel , we can apply our error correction scheme in the next section . suppose alice wants to send qubits to bob . their qubit bases differ by the values @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 . even when they do not know which basis the other party uses , the two parties send qubits by sending two extra qubits ( when @ xmath4 is odd ) and two extra qubits ( when @ xmath4 is even ) . we describe the results and prove them in the following section . the last section is devoted to summary and proof . in the following , @ xmath10 is the @ xmath11th basis of the identity matrices and wedefine the vector s @ xmath12 such that @ xmath13 is zero . we have vectors @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 acting on the @ xmath4 - qubit ##s @ xmath16 , where @ xmath3 is mentioned above . let @ xmath17 be @ xmath18 real numbers , and let @ xmath19 . denote by @ xmath20 the ( smallest ) rank - @ xmath21 - projection of @ xmath22 , which is the projection of @ xmath23 such that @ xmath24 for all @ xmath18 rank - @ xmath21 - projection @ xmath25 @ xcite . a quantum channel of the form @ xmath26 is an @ xmath21 - based quantum error correction code ( qecc ) if and only if @ xmath27 . to prove this theorem , we need to satisfy the knill - laflamme correctability theorem , which states that for a quantum channel @ xmath28 with the operators @ xmath29 , @ xmath30 is a qecc of @ xmath31 if and only if@ xmath32 , where @ xmath33 is the unit vector with the dimension of @ xmath30 @ xcite . it should be shown that @ xmath34 if and only if there is a qecc with dimension @ xmath21 . then it follows from @ xmath35 and the cases @ xmath36 when @ xmath4 is even and @ xmath37 when @ xmath4 is odd that the set ( [ x : corrch ] ) has an @ xmath21 - dimensional qecc if and only if @ xmath38 . showing that @ xmath39 is of dimension @ xmath25 , we have @ xmath40 if and only if @ xmath41 . [ thm1 ] if @ xmath3 is odd . then @ xmath42 . our proof is simple . for @ xmath43 , denote @ xmath44 . for @ xmath45 denote @ xmath46 , where @ xmath47 is the number of @ xmath48 - dimensional from @ xmath4 to . since @ xmath49 we have @ xmat##h50 let @ xmath25 be the orthogonal projection onto @ xmath30 . then the above theorem implies that @ xmath51 and @ xmath52 . hence , @ xmath53 , which means that @ xmath54 and therefore @ xmath30 is said to be an @ xmath55 - dimensional qecc . _ proof let us return to the simple @ xmath4 theorem . we first have the lemma which is used to prove the theorem . [ lem1 ] let @ xmath56 be a square matrix . then the rank - @ xmath21 - norm of @ xmath57 is the sum of the convex hulls of the @ xmath58 norm of @ xmath57 . the proof of the theorem is given by @ xcite . [ thm2 ] , @ xmath3 is even . not @ xmath59 but @ xmath60 . _ proof . @ xmath61 . by definition [ thm1 ] , @ xmath62 . is @ xmath63 such that the projection @ xmath25 onto @ xmath64 satisfies @ x##math65 and @ xmath52 and then @ xmath66 , which becomes @ xmath59 . _ since @ xmath67 is a diagonal matrix , @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 can be swapped again . we first assume that @ xmath68 since @ xmath69 , we have @ xmath70 let us assume that @ xmath71 . we then use the formula @ xmath72 for hermitian @ xmath73 . let us replace @ xmath74 by @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 by @ xmath77 to get @ xmath78 . since @ xmath75 and @ xmath77 ##8 , @ xmath79 is diagonal and hence [ lem1 ] is diagonal . from ex . ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , we have @ xmath79 = inverse @ xmath80 and the matrix is @ xmath81 - - normal . by replacing @ xmath82 and @ x##math83 in the [ lem1 ] , we define the rank - @ xmath55 projection decomposition of @ xmath79 at the intersection of the convex hull of any @ xmath84 projection . since each eigenvalue has rank @ xmath81 , the convex hull involves at least two points . by adding two points located in the complex plane , we can find the intersection of all the convex hull of a single point @ xmath85 , which is @ xmath71 . similarly , we prove @ xmath86 . from these , we obtain @ xmath87 and @ xmath42 . let @ xmath25 be a rank - @ xmath55 projection such that @ xmath88 . [ @ xmath89 \ ] ] where also @ xmath90 has rank @ xmath91 . from @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 , we have two distinct projections @ xmath94 . @ xmath95 is the singular value decomposition of @ xmath96 , where @ xmath9##7 is a nonnegative diagonal matrix and @ xmath98 . then the diagonal equations are written as @ xmath99 . combining these equations , we get the diagonal matrix is written as @ xmath100 \ [ \ begin { array } { cc } d & u \ \ 0 & d \ begin { array } \ ] \ [ \ begin { array } { cc } d ^ \ dagger & u \ \ 0 & d ^ \ dagger \ end { array } \ ] \ , . \ ] ] since for @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 , it follows from @ xmath103 that @ xmath104 . = @ xmath105 . let @ xmath57 and @ xmath106 are non - negative . on the other hand , the identity @ xmath107 implies @ xmath108 and not @ xmath109 , which is a contradiction . hence , @ xmath60 . in the following , we have an explicit implementation of qecc for @ xmath31 . c . ( [ c : corrch ] ) with rank @ xmath4 . the result isbased on the [ thm1 ] and the formula in @ xcite . let @ xmath110 be the @ xmath111 matrix with columns in the set @ xmath112 and the @ xmath113 [ @ xmath114 $ ] . in our qec , the @ xmath5 - qubit state @ xmath115 is encoded with the ancilla qubit @ xmath116 and @ xmath117 . suppose a noisy output channel @ xmath31 is connected to the input state and then the recovery function @ xmath118 is applied so that the decoded state simply appears in the output with no further restrictions . our qec is then summarized as @ xmath119 where @ xmath120 . choosing an encoding amounts to assigning each of @ xmath81 column vectors in @ xmath110 a basis vector of the whole state space without restrictions . thus there are two degrees of freedom in the choice of encoding . in the above examples , we have chosen one whose integrated circuit can be implemented with the least number of cnot gates . since our recovery function is the inverse of the encodinghowever , it is usually used with the same number of cnot operations . when @ xmath121 , the error term @ xmath122 can be chosen as @ xmath123 when @ xmath124 , @ xmath122 can be chosen as @ xmath125 . [ nodd ] - the state of the matrix @ xmath122 for @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 . [ nodd ] - qubit ##s @ xmath115 with a single ancilla qubit , and the matrix @ xmath128 . ( a ) is for @ xmath126 . ( b ) is for @ xmath127 . the output state in the diagram represents a random state with the possible states shown in parentheses . the single ancilla state is @ xmath129 for the states @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 ( @ xmath132 and @ xmath133 ) for @ xmath126 and @ xmath129 for @ xmath134 and @ xmath135 ( @ xmath136 and @ x##math137 ) for @ xmath127 . , width = 529 ] it follows from eq . ( [ qecc ] ) that the recovery circuit is the inverse of the encoding circuit . it seems , at first sight , that the circuits shown in fig . 1 contradict with fig . ( [ qecc ] ) since the controlled not gate in the middle of the recovery circuit is missing from the encoding circuit . note , however , that the top qubit is set to @ xmath138 , and the controlled not gate is not omitted without the encoding . we have a decoherence - invariant code when @ xmath4 is defined as above . the codeword in this example is equivalent to the noise problem , which is the problem of the function / subsystem defined by @ xcite . if @ xmath139 exist , the vector @ xmath140 is separately invariant under the action of @ xmath141 and @ xmath9 . there are @ xmath142 basis vectors of the form , e . g . we have basis vectors , @ xmath143 for @ xmath144 . then we find a decoherence- free encoding for @ xmath145 qubits by projecting onto this vector space spanned by these basis . it should be noted that the mapping of @ xmath25 to the space @ xmath146 spanned by the vector basis in question . ( [ nss ] ) satisfies both @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 , which shows @ xmath149 . it is possible to extend this result to states with rank @ xmath150 . here [ neven ] ( a ) and ( b ) are the states for ( a ) @ xmath144 and ( b ) @ xmath151 , respectively . [ neven ] - qubit ##s @ xmath115 with an ancilla qubit ##s with the state @ xmath152 . ( a ) is for @ xmath144 . ( b ) is for @ xmath151 . the output channel in the example is a random channel with no correlated noise . in fact . the output ancilla state is always @ xmath153 , because of noise that acted on the channel . , [ = 529 ] wewe shown that there is a quantum error correction which produces partially correlated codes of the form @ xmath154 , in which @ xmath4 qubits are combined to produce ( i ) @ xmath155 data qubit states when @ xmath4 is odd and ( ii ) @ xmath156 data qubit states when @ xmath4 is even . we have proved these statements by an operator theoretical method . neither syndrome measurements nor ancilla qubits for syndrome measurement are required for our scheme , which makes physical verification of our scheme quite practical . codes with @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 were analyzed in detail and the equivalent circuits for our qec with the same number of cnot gate gates developed . since the error operators are closed under matrix multiplication , they can be corrected only when they act on the codeword many times . a very similar qec has been found with @ xcite . they use a partially correlated scheme , where the error operators act on a fixed subset of the codeword qubits only . they have shown that the block packing problem was violated by taking advantage of some of the codes . justification of such a violated problem , however ,seems to be very difficult . they have also shown that correlated noise acting on an arbitrary number @ xmath4 of qubits can create @ xmath157 data qubits . in addition , we have used a fully correlated noise , which shows the highest efficiency , and have shown that @ xmath158 data qubits can be encoded with an @ xmath4 - qubit codeword when @ xmath4 is odd . however , our qec ##s - correlated noise is limited as it is known that one can not use @ xmath4 qubits as data qubits for odd @ xmath4 and we have shown that one can not use @ xmath155 qubits for even @ xmath4 . ckl was supported by a usa ##id grant , a hk rgc grant , the 2011 macarthur fellowship , and the 2011 shanxi university fellowship program . he is an associate professor of university of hong kong , taiyuan institute of technology , and shanghai university . he and ht were supported by ` ` china research network ' ' project for educational research : matching fund subsidy from mext ( ministry of education , culture , sports , science and2 ) . ytp was supported by a usa ##id grant . nss was supported by a hk rgc grant .
