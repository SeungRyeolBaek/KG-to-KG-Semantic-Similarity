the photo - nuclear cross section parameterized by the geant4 includes all the photon ##s from hadron ##ic to p - ic . the parameterization is divided into seven different regions , each corresponding to the decay process that occurs . these are the global magnetic resonance ( gdr ) region , the ` ` proton - proton ' ' region , the @ xmath3 isobar region characterized by the dominant peak in the cross section which extends from the nuclear transition to 450 mev , the proton decay region that extends from about 450 mev to 1 . 1 gev , and the reggeon - pomeron region at 1 . 1 gev . from the geant4 @ xcite photo - nuclear data , currently seven parameters are used in defining the parameterization : @ xmath4h , @ xmath5h , @ xmath6he , @ xmath7li , @ xmath8li , @ xmath9be , @ xmath10c , @ xmath11o , @ xmath12al , @ xmath13ca , sb , sn , sb , and sb . the parameter is a combination of @ xmath0 and @ x##math1 , where @ xmath2 is the nuclear resonance energy . the cross - section is the sum of the components which parameterize the target nucleus . + the cross section of the gdr region can be interpreted as the sum of two functions , @ xmath14 the exponential describes the falling edge of the resonance which has power law properties . the function @ xmath15 describes the rising edge of the resonance . it is the nuclear - electron - reflection function and acts as a threshold , cutting off the resonance . the two functions @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 . @ xmath18 the @ xmath0 - 1 parameters @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 are defined for each of the target nuclei and are defined for different regions . + the @ xmath3 isobar region is parameterized by @ xmath22 where @ xmath23 is an energy normalization factor . @ xmath24 can be interpreted as the sum of the @ xmath3 width and @ xmath25 is the inverse @ xmath3 width . @ xmath26 is the reflection function . the @ xmath0 -one of these yields is as follows : * @ xmath27 ( for @ xmath4h it is 0 . 54 , for @ xmath5h it is 0 . 54 ) , i . e . the @ xmath3 yield is due to @ xmath0 ; * @ xmath28 . @ xmath29 shows how the yield threshold depends on @ xmath0 . * @ xmath30 for @ xmath31 and 0 . 04 for @ xmath32 ; * @ xmath33 , which shows that the ` ` decay ' ' of the @ xmath3 yield tends to higher values ; * @ xmath34 . @ xmath25 = 0 . 5 for @ xmath4h . the @ xmath0 - dependence of the @ xmath35 , @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 yields is due to the @ xmath36 decay , which can take place in the transition region below the yield threshold . + the anti - fission contribution is parameterized with the same parameters as the @ xmath3 yield but without the # ##s : @ xmath37 for @ xmat##h4h and @ xmath5h the quasi - deuteron contribution is not used . for these nuclei the standard baryonic resonance is used instead , and the values for these two nuclei are not different , but equal . the parameter values are shown below . * @ xmath38 , where @ xmath39 . the @ xmath0 - dependence of the quasi - proton contribution is less than @ xmath40 it contributes only one for these nuclei . for @ xmath4h it is 0 . 078 and for @ xmath5h it is 0 . 08 . * @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 . the data is used to fix their @ xmath0 - dependence . for both @ xmath4h and @ xmath5h we have @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 . the roper contribution is parameterized by the same parameters as the quasi - deuteron contribution : @ xmath45 and @ xmath39 , the values of the parameters are * @ xmath46 . for @ xmath4h it is 0 . 18 and for @ xmath5h it is 0 . 22 .* @ xmath47 ( for @ xmath4h and for @ xmath5h it is 6 . 0 ) , so the rest mass agrees with @ xmath0 . * @ xmath48 . for @ xmath4h it is 12 . 0 and for @ xmath5h it is 15 . 0 . the regge - pomeron model is parametrized in terms of the equations for the pomeron and higher reggeon contributions as : @ xmath49 with @ xmath50 . for the simplest model for x - ray reactions , we are using the chiral invariant phase - space ( chips ) approach @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite . the chips model uses a set of selection rules which use microscopic quark - like particles to model macroscopic hadronic systems . the invariant phase space involved in the state of thermalized chaos is restricted to quarks , and simple kinematic rules are used to model the hadronization of chaos into states . together with simple kinematics and the conservation of quantum information , the following concepts are used : the quasmon is any excited hadronic system , and .be considered as a compact hadron . at the microscopic level , the quasmon may be thought of as a system of quark - parton particles in which the particles are massless . the quark - partons in the quasmon are massless and homogeneously distributed over the entire phase space . it may also be viewed as a model of the three - dimensional feynman - teller @ xcite parton gas . the standard model is a particle defined by quantum numbers and a fixed length and width . the quark content of the hadron is a physical quantity constrained by the quantum numbers . the quasmon , however , is defined by the particle length and width , and the concept of a well behaved particle with quantum numbers is of secondary importance . the quark fusion hypothesis determines the rules of final state energy production , with energy spectra describing the energy distribution of the quarks in the system . fusion occurs when a quark - partons in a quasmon combines to form a nucleus . in formation of a quasmon , quark - partons may be exchanged between the two quasmons . resulting hadrons are assumed to be determined by energy alone . the mass of the resulting hadron is determined bycombinatoric and kinematic factors consistent with conservation laws . the only non - kinematic factor is the existence of a critical temperature of the quasmon . this has a 30 - year history , starting with fig . @ xcite and being based on the experimental observation of regularities in the energy spectra of hadrons produced by nuclear reactions at high energies . however , the critical temperature theorem states that the quasmon can not be excited above a certain temperature . adding more energy to the system increases only the number of free non - partons while the temperature remains constant . the critical temperature @ xmath51 mev is the principal parameter of the model . the choice of this parameter was motivated from the results given in fig . [ apcmul ] . for the sake of briefness , we will also include the solution of the above equations in this paper , and also for the solution of the on - line equations to the chips publications @ xcite , @ xcite . to generate energy spectra from free quasmons , the number of partons in the system must be constant . for a given number of @ xmath52 partons with a total invariant mass @ xmath53 , the invariant momentum space integral , @xmath54 , is proportional to @ xmath55 . for constant mass @ xmath56 the probability distribution of particles is proportional to @ xmath57 and the probability to find a system of @ xmath52 n - partons in a system with mass @ xmath53 is @ xmath58 . for this type of probability distribution the mean value of @ xmath59 is @ xmath60 for large @ xmath52 we obtain for massless particles the well - known @ xmath61 distribution . when a nucleon hits an emitted n - parton , such as a real or hypothetical photon , for example , the newly emitted quasmon produces a system of @ xmath52 n - partons , where @ xmath52 is given by : . [ temperature ] . for each of these quark - partons with mass @ xmath62 as the center of the mass ( cms ) of @ xmath52 partons , the mass of the remaining @ xmath63 quark - partons is given by @ xmath64 where @ xmath65 is the total energy of the @ xmath6##3 decay - partons . the effective mass is a function of the total energy @ xmath53 , @ xmath66 so that the above expression for the decay - parton spectrum is : @ xmath67 in order to split a quasmon into a primary and a residual quasmon , one uses the sum of two decay - partons to calculate the effective mass of the hadron . we calculate the spectrum of the second decay - parton , using the same argument as to calculate eq . [ spectrum _ 1 ] . this quark - parton is chosen from the list @ xmath63 . it has an energy @ xmath24 and the mass of the @ xmath63 decay - partons . the mass is calculated by substituting @ xmath63 for @ xmath52 and @ xmath65 for @ xmath53 using eq . [ spectrum _ 1 ] and then using ex . [ m _ n - 1 ] to calculate @ xmath68 to ensure that the split will result in no loss of mass @ xmath69 , we apply the mass shell formula for the outgoing .##ron , @ xmath70 , @ xmath71 is the difference between the values * p * and * q * of the two super - partons in the range of @ xmath63 , . the kinematic - average value for a super super - parton with energy @ xmath62 is therefore : @ xmath72 using the @ xmath73 - rule to perform the integration of @ xmath24 one gets : @ xmath74 . @ xmath75 using the integral @ xmath76 , this yields @ xmath77 where the points of integration are @ xmath78 when @ xmath79 , and @ xmath80 when @ xmath81 . the average value of @ xmath71 is : @ xmath82 . integrating from @ xmath78 to @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 and integrating from @ xmath78 to @ xmath85 yields the total kinematic probability for hadronization of a super - parton with energy @ xmath62 into a super##ron with expression @ xmath69 : @ xmath86 the ratio of expressions [ kin _ probab ] and [ spin _ kin _ probab ] can be written as a real number , @ xmath87 , and distributed on the interval [ 0 , 1 ] . solving for @ xmath83 then gives @ xmath88 { 1 } \ cdot z _ { \ max } . \ left { z _ random } \ ] ] in addition to the kinematic properties of the two n - partons in the fusion process , the quark spin of the quasmon and the spin of the resulting final hadron are used to calculate the probability that a particular type of particle is produced . because only the relative hadron formation factors are known , the formation factors can be dropped . while the fusion probability can be written as @ xmath89 ##1 , only the factor @ xmath90 is used since the formation factors in expression [ tot _ kin _ probab ] are constant for all and for the final particle . the factor @ xmath91 gives the initial spin of the final hadron of spin @ xmath92, and @ xmath93 is the number of times the candidate hadron can be formed from combinations of the proton and the quasmon . for making these combinations , the standard electron wave functions for nuclei and electrons were used . for @ xmath94 and @ xmath95 mesons the electron wave functions @ xmath96 and @ xmath97 were used . no mixing was assumed for the @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 ##9 states , hence @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 . at high energies we need quark - spin field theory and a diffractive ansatz for electron spin to describe the reactions of real and artificial nuclei with electrons . a description of the means of doing this can be found in a separate paper in the present journal @ xcite . electro - nuclear reactions are closely related with photo - nuclear reactions . they are sometimes called ` ` photo - nuclear ' ' because the proton - electron exchange mechanism dominates the reaction . in this sense it can be replaced by a source of light energy . this is not completely accurate , because at low energies diffractive effects are possible ,all these types of reactions are beyond the scope of this article . the longitudinal photon method ( epa ) was proposed by a . fermi @ xcite and developed by a . weizsacker and e . cohen @ xcite and by a . cohen and a . lifshitz @ xcite . the covariant version of the epa method was published in 1994 . @ xcite and @ xcite . when using this method it is necessary to take into account that real particles are always transversely polarized while virtual ones can be independently generated . in epa the differential cross section of the electro - nuclear scattering can be written as @ xmath102 where @ xmath103 the differential cross section of the electro - nuclear scattering can be rewritten as @ xmath104 where @ xmath105 for small @ xmath106 and is written as a function of @ xmath107 , @ xmath108 , and @ xmath106 for large @ xmath106 . energies of longitudinal photons are usually included in the differential @ xmath109 cross section through the @ xmath107 factor , but in the epa method , thecross section of virtual particles is considered to be @ xmath107 - 1 . the electro - nuclear scattering , with respect to the number of virtual particles with electrons , can thus be divided into two . at the @ xmath106 it is necessary to use the @ xmath110 cross section . at the @ xmath111 limit it is necessary to use the corresponding @ xmath112 cross section . + using the above notation , the canonical cross section of electro - nuclear scattering can be related to the number of equivalent photons @ xmath113 . for @ xmath114 and @ xmath115 the canonical integral @ xcite leads to @ xmath116 for @ xcite , integration over @ xmath106 for @ xmath117 leads to @ xmath118 at the @ xmath114 limit this formula leads to eq . ( [ neq ] ) . + the correspondence with fig . ( [ neq ] ) can be made more precise if the path integral @ xmath119 where @ xmath120 , @ xmath121 , @ xmath122 , @ x##math123 , is used for @ xmath124 . the term @ xmath125 is used instead to calculate @ xmath126 , which can be considered as the boundary between the low and high @ xmath106 regions . the total photon flux can be written as an approximation of e . ( [ diff ] ) with the maximum or upper bound @ xmath127 it can be calculated by @ xmath128 where @ xmath129 . it should be pointed out that neither this approximation nor eq . ( [ diff ] ) apply at @ xmath130 . the formal name of the equation is @ xmath131 . + to the ` ` photon flux ' ' for ( a ) @ xmath132 ions and ( b ) @ xmath133 ions . in figures ( c ) and ( d ) the photon flux @ xmath134 is determined by the photo - absorption cross section and averaged over @ xmath106 . the dashed lines are integral over low @ xmath106 ( under the dashed lines in the first two figures ) , the solid lines are integral over high -@ xmath106 ( see the dotted lines in the first two figures ) . , [ = 321 ] ] . [ nsigma ] ( a , b ) is the energy density for the emitted photon . the low - @ xmath106 flux is calculated using cf . ( [ neq ] ) ( dotted lines ) and cf . ( [ diff ] ) ( dotted lines ) . the total flux is calculated using cf . ( [ neqhq ] ) ( the dotted lines ) and using cf . ( [ diff ] ) with the upper limit given by cf . ( [ q2max ] ) ( above - dotted lines visible from around @ xmath135 ) . we find that to calculate the flux of low - @ xmath106 equivalent ##s or the total number of equivalent ##s we must use the approximations given by cf . ( [ neq ] ) and eq . ( [ neqhq ] ) , respectively , instead of using cf . ( [ diff ] ) . using the low - @ xmath106 photon flux and the total photon flux we find that the low - @ xmath106 photon flux is aboutdecrease of the the constant . from the theoretical point of view the decrease of @ xmath136 with increasing @ xmath106 can be calculated . the cross section distribution for the virtual photon with energy @ xmath106 is governed by several parameters . the cross section starts with @ xmath106 as the squared - nucleon sub - factor @ xmath137 and the then the @ xmath138 values are added to the @ xmath108 as the factor @ xmath139 , which is the difference between the @ xmath140 and @ xmath108 values . using the method used by @ xcite , @ xmath141 at large @ xmath106 can be approximated as @ xmath142 where @ xmath143 . the @ xmath107 - reduction of the @ xmath144 and @ xmath145 functions is trivial , so for example the @ xmath146 and @ xmath147 functions are averaged over @ xmath107 . they can be approximated as @ xmath148 the virtual photon is averaged with the cross sectionillustrated by fig . ( [ 1 ] ) and illustrated in fig . [ nsigma ] ( c , d ) . we show here the low - @ xmath106 region ( @ xmath149 , dashed lines ) , and the high - @ xmath106 region ( @ xmath150 , solid lines ) . these regions will be used at @ xmath151 , hence because of the magnetic dipole # ##s , the low - @ xmath106 part has more than twice the total @ xmath152 cross section . + at @ xmath153 , where the electron mass increases , the high @ xmath106 part dominates . in this case , for a direct simulation of the production of light - electrons , it is possible to simulate the high - @ xmath106 part as well as the low - @ xmath106 part . + taking into account the contribution of low - @ xmath106 , it is possible to use eq . ( [ neqhq ] ) with the over - estimated @ xmath105 cross section . the slightly over - estimated electro - nuclear cross section of @xmath154 where @ xmath155 @ xmath156 @ xmath157 the total photon number @ xmath158 can be obtained for a single photon of @ xmath87 from the equation @ xmath159 where . ( [ diff ] ) is more convenient for the randomization of @ xmath106 . there is an easily calculated value which approximates fig . ( [ diff ] ) at the hadronic point ( @ xmath160 ) . this is @ xmath161 where @ xmath162 @ xmath163 @ xmath164 @ xmath165 @ xmath166 the @ xmath106 value can also be calculated as @ xmath167 where @ xmath87 is a photon number . in fig . [ q2dep ] , eq . ( [ diff ] ) ( curved line ) is compared to fig . ( [ rq2hh ] ) ( straight line ) . because the two curves are nearly indistinguishable in the figure , this can be used as an illustration of the @ xmath10##6 spectrum of virtual photons , which is the derivative of these curves . an alternative approach is to use e . ( [ diff ] ) for the randomization with the two photon spectrum @ xmath168 . spectrum of virtual electrons for the values @ xmath169 , @ xmath170 , and @ xmath132 , @ xmath171 , @ xmath172 , and @ xmath173 . the solid line corresponds to e . ( [ diff ] ) and the dashed line ( which almost exactly coincides with the solid line ) corresponds to eq . ( [ diff ] ) . , [ = 321 ] once the @ xmath108 and @ xmath106 values have been found , the value of @ xmath174 is calculated as e . ( [ abc ] ) . note that if @ xmath175 , no decay occurs and the process keeps going . these values are generated using the single photon energy method . sampling the single photon energy described in the previous section allows to generate an elementary model that in turn can be treated as the method used for cosmic ray scattering . the question to be answered is that of the quantumanalysis of these results in the context of parton exchange diagrams . in the analysis of the photo - nuclear reactions given in the comparison section , and the description of @ xmath176 proton and neutron spectra in @ xmath177 reactions at @ xmath178 mev , the assumption of the initial quasmon exchange diagrams was the same . the analysis of the @ xmath176 data was similar , but the secondary particles showed a strong angular dependence , since the number of quasmons produced in the initial state was large , and the fragmentation process was not isotropic . however , the angular dependence of these particles in photo - nuclear reactions is very strong even at low energies ( see , for example , ) . this is a challenging experimental problem which is difficult to solve in any way . it s safe to say that if the angular dependence of secondary particles in the @ xmath179ca reaction at 1 mev is analyzed in terms of a boost , then the velocity of the source should be @ xmath180 ; and the mass of the source should be less than the proton . the main aim of the present publication is to show that the quark - exchangemechanism used in the chips model can not only model the clusterization of nucleons in nuclei and hadronization of intra - nuclear particles into nuclear fragments , but can also model the mechanisms of exchange of photons and hadrons in nuclear matter . photon - exchange diagrams : to keep track of the mechanism of the photon - exchange and to trace the mechanism to the direct interaction of a photon with the nucleus , it is necessary to assume that the quark - exchange process takes place in nuclei continuously , and without any external interaction . particles with high momenta do not reach the nucleus because of the lack of excess energy . the hypothesis of the chips model is that the photon - exchange forces of nucleons @ xcite themselves in waves in the nuclei . since a low - energy photon ( below the pion absorption threshold ) can only be absorbed by a single nucleus , other physical mechanisms involving more than one nucleon have to be used . the simplest mechanism is the absorption by a quark - parton of the nucleus . at low energies and in vacuum this does not work because there is no single excited baryonic state . but in nuclear matter there is a way to exchange this state with a neighboring, producing a nuclear fragment . the diagram for the first is shown in the upper part of fig . [ diagram1 ] . in this case the photon is absorbed by a cluster - parton from the parent cluster @ xmath181 , and then the secondary cluster or cluster @ xmath182 absorbs the angular momentum of the proton and photon . the exchange quark - parton @ xmath24 changes the balance of color , producing the final - emitted photon q and the exchange quasmon rq . the result looks like a burst of a quasi - free particle or fragment out of the cluster . it should be noted that in this scenario the nuclear fragment generator produces not only ` ` quasi - free ' ' fragments but ` ` quasi - free ' ' fragments too . the energy of these quasi - free particles or fragments is measured in the z axis . the second scenario , shown in the lower part of fig . [ diagram1 ] which accounts for the energy dependence of the absorption of the photon by a colored cluster ( @ xmath183 , fig . [ diagram1 ] ) . in this scenario , both the primary cluster - parton with cluster @ xmath##62 and the fragment with momentum @ xmath184 is replaced by a daughter cluster ( @ xmath182 in the phase diagram of fig . [ diagram1 ] ) , and the residual neutron - parton with momentum @ xmath24 does not fully compensate the fragment @ xmath185 . as a result the fragmentation of the parent cluster in the forward direction is more probable . in both cases the time dependence is defined by the physical principle of hadronization . the total fragmentation of the parent quasmon is : [ . . , n = 302 ] it was shown in 2008 that the energy density of the partons in the quasmon can be calculated as @ xmath186 where @ xmath187 is the energy of the residual neutron - parton in the center of the system ( cs ) of the quasmon , @ xmath53 is the temperature of the quasmon , and @ xmath52 , the number of quark - partons in the quasmon , can be calculated from the equation @ xmath188 where @ xmath56 is the temperature of the nucleus . in the hypothetical scenario of the @ xmath13##8 interaction ( cf . [ diagram1 ] ) , since both interacting particles are massless , we see that the cross section for the interaction of the photon with a particular photon - parton is proportional to the mass of the photon - parton system , and is proportional to the momentum of the photon - parton system @ xmath189 , which can be calculated as @ xmath190 where @ xmath98 is the mass of the photon , and @ xmath62 is the momentum of the photon - parton in the quantum state ( s ) : @ xmath191 in the case of a virtual photon , equation ( [ s ] ) can be calculated as @ xmath192 where @ xmath184 is the momentum of the virtual photon . in both cases equation ( [ s _ 1iii ] ) transforms into @ xmath193 and the angular momentum of @ xmath194 transforms to the @ xmath195 - function : in the case of a real photon @ xmath196 , and in the case of a virtual photon @ xmath197 . in the second case for the interaction , ( see part of fig. [ diagram1 ] ) we assume that both the photon and the primary anti - parton , selected according to spectrum ( [ spectrum _ 1iii ] ) , enter the daughter cluster @ xmath182 , and after that the same process of quark exchange continues , in which the recoiling quark - parton @ xmath24 returns to the parent cluster . an important parameter of the model is the energy production of the particles . at the first stage we assumed kinetic energy , but in the end , when more experimental data are obtained , this parameter can be neglected . we compared the model with the data on energy production from the @ xmath13ca @ xmath198 reaction at @ xmath176 at 5965 mev @ xcite , and at @ xmath199 and @ xmath200 at 6000 mev @ xcite . we used these data , to compare the angular momentum generated by them with experimental data . the data are presented as a function of the total electron cross section @ xmath201 depending on the value @ xmath202 , where @ xmath203 and @ xmath204 are the kinetic energy and the momentum of the free electrons .as one can see from fig . [ gam62iii ] , the angular momentum of the proton ##s in energy - states at @ xmath13ca and @ xmath205 mev is reproduced very well by the chips model results . the second set of measurements that we need for the benchmark comparison deals with the secondary electron yields in @ xmath10c @ xmath198 reactions at 123 and 151 mev @ xcite , which are still below the energy production threshold for a free nucleon . inclusive yields of protons have been measured in @ xmath206c reactions at @ xmath207 , @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 , @ xmath210 , and @ xmath211 . originally , these data were calculated as a function of the free electrons . we combine the data from fig . [ gam _ 123 ] and [ gm _ 151 ] , with chips models in the form of the invariant inclusive cross section measured on @ xmath62 . the similarity between the combined data and the chips model results is very remarkable . the measurements and calculations show the strength of the invariant inclusive cross section relative to the kinematicrate of the reaction . the angular distribution in the data is not as good as in the experimental data , but agrees well qualitatively . using the same parameters , we compared the chips event generator to the @ xmath10c ( p , or @ xmath212p ) spectrum measured in ref . @ xcite . the resulting spectra were measured in the experiment in the form of a photon with energy @ xmath213 mev and energy @ xmath214 mev / @ xmath215 . to account for the experimental conditions in the chips event generator , we measured the signals generated in the opposite direction with respect to the energy of the virtual photon , with the same angle @ xmath216 . the chips angular distribution and the experimental data are shown in fig . [ vgam ] in the form of the invariant symbol ##s , as a function of @ xmath62 . the chips event generator works well with ground states of atoms . we did not find any significant effects for @ xmath217 - shell knockout or for other shells . so we found that the chips event generator works in the so - called ` ` @ xmath218 - shell knockout ' ' region, which is usually not smeared by a lorentzian @ xcite . in the regular ##ized model the spectrum of protons at @ xmath219 mev is linear ; it is down to the kinematic limit . the additional energy at @ xmath220 mev is a combination of the spontaneous quantum act of hadronization with the quark - spin . the slope associated with momentum is approximated exactly by the energy , but it is obvious that the yield close to the kinematic limit of the @ xmath221 reaction can only be described in detail if the electronic properties of the residual proton are taken into account . the angular dependence of the proton yield for low - energy non - nuclear reactions is described in the standard model and the above . the most important step in the description is the hypothesis of a direct interaction of the proton with an electrically stable electron in the nucleus , even at low energies . this means that asymptotic results of qcd and dispersion sum rules @ xcite can in no way be generalized for low energies . the knockout of a proton from a nuclear reaction by the probability distribution of nuclear evaporation can also explain significant angular dependence at low energies .the same model appears to be capable of modeling the yields of such reactions as the @ xmath11c ( or , e @ xmath212p ) model , at mit . @ xcite , where it was shown that the region of lowest energy of 10 mev is ` ` two - or - more - electron knockout ' ' ( or the ` ` knockout ' ' in case of the chips model ) . the chip model may help to understand and predict such phenomena .
