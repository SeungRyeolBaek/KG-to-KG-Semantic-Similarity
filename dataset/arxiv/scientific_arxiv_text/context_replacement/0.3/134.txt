one of the most promising solutions to the hierarchy problem is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model @ xcite . in this model there is a single - dimension compactified manifold @ xmath1 with the non - factorizable boundary of @ xmath2 @ xmath3 . @ xmath4 is the extra - dimensional curvature , and @ xmath5 is the boundary of the @ xmath6 curvature , @ xmath7 . two branes are the boundaries of the extra dimension . one , at @ xmath8 , is called the uv , or planck , brane . the other , at @ xmath9 , is the ir , or tev , brane . at @ xmath10 , which is interested in complex physical systems , solved the hierarchy problem @ xcite . in the original rs model the sm was coupled to the uv brane , and the sm propagated in the bulk @ xcite . it has since been realized that both gauge and fermion theories can exist in the case of a realistic manifold @ xcite . these theories are equivalent , but the free energy can be greatly reduced by applying electroweak theory . much of this problem can be generalized to thenote that the extra gauge fields receive a contribution to their energy from the background , which does not affect the custodial @ xmath11 . this can be done by changing the gauge group to @ xmath12 , which also increases the electroweak symmetry @ xcite . the breaking of this extra electroweak symmetry occurs in three ways : on the uv brane @ xmath13 ; on the uv brane @ xmath14 , where @ xmath15 is the sum of the @ xmath16 components . this paper describes the properties of the higgs sector that drive this breaking . we will ask what causes the breaking of this brane . on the planck brane all degrees of freedom will have different scale values , so we can ignore them . we can then explain the breaking with boundary conditions to good effect . this leads to the boundary conditions : @ xmath8 @ xmath17 . @ xmath18 and @ xmath19 are composed of 5d gauge fields : @ xmath20 , and @ xmath21 . on the tev brane , the breaking will have tev scale , so we should look at the higgs sector in detail . the simplest structure thatwill create the breaking point is a single higgs that is not bidoublet under @ xmath22 . this reduces to the boundary conditions at @ xmath9 @ xmath23 so that in the @ xmath24 limit we have the same higgsless boundary conditions , and this then reduces to the higgsless model in @ xcite . we will use this parameter , @ xmath25 to distinguish between the charged limit ( @ xmath26 ) , and the higgsless limit . [ fig : wroot ] to break up the effective 4d theory , we convert the 5d fields into kaluza ##v ( kk ) fields , @ xmath27 we will then obtain the gauge field wavefunctions by using the equations of state corresponding to the boundary conditions ( [ fig : gaugebcr ] ) and ( [ fig : gaugebcrp ] ) . this is a set of energies corresponding to the excitations of the gauge field . the lowest energies in each of the charged and neutral sectors , correspond to the @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 modes . the charged sector also has a neutral mode , corresponding to the photon . the[ fig : wroot ] shows the eigenvalue for the @ xmath28 as a function of the parameter @ xmath25 . [ fig : wcoup ] an interesting feature of this model is that the @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 wavefunctions are suppressed in the ir brane , as can be seen by changing the boundary conditions . this also allows for increasing @ xmath25 . this means that the coupling of the gauge field to the higgs can generically be neglected . [ fig : wcoup ] shows the coupling of the @ xmath28 to the higgs . for values of @ xmath25 at infinity the lep dependence on the higgs mass can be greatly reduced . ( for larger values of @ xmath25 the model is nearly higgsless . ) the fermion sector of this model is more complicated . first , the higgs vev has the boundary conditions that allow left and right magnetic fields to give the same masses . however , there are two different degrees of freedom . first , since 5d particles are achiral , ther can only measure the mass term in the parameter @ xmath30 . thethe effect of this symmetry is to shift the location of the local zero mode in the bulk . by changing this , we can cause the zero mode to be located very near the planck ##ian ir brane , and also can change the degree of this shift . this allows us to determine the overlap of the zero mode with the ir brane , and thus the strength with which the particles interact with the higgs . in this way the number of possible masses can be reduced by order of magnitude in the 5d masses . the second complication comes from the @ xmath31 symmetry which requires that , for example , @ xmath32 if broken . this mass constraint can be broken by interaction with other particles closer to the ir brane , where the @ xmath31 is broken . for more details , see @ xcite . note that there are high - level corrections to the electroweak observables , coming largely from the kk symmetry of the gauge sector . however , the magnitude of these corrections is highly sensitive to the configuration of the gauge sector . for the standard configuration given in @ xcite we find the approximate @ xmath33 . there are , however ,at points in the fermion parameter space where the coupling is trivial , then a wide range of @ xmath25 should be considered . the final paradigm used in higgs properties is in the couplings to massless field theories , _ i . e . _ particles and fields . the coupling of the higgs to gluon loop is induced through these loops . however , in this case the kk can also couple to the higgs . also , note that we have very small 4d yukawa coupling for the colored fermions and the wavefunction ##s with the would - be coupling ##es . the 5d yukawa coupling are all order 1 , and the excited states exhibit _ no _ wavefunction ##s . hence there are large contributions to the higgs - glue - like coupling from the kk excitations of _ no _ colored particles . this leads to an increase in that coupling , as seen in fig . [ fig : hgg ] . there are also contributions to the higgs - to - particle coupling . the situation here is more complicated , however , since there are large contributions from @ xmath28 boson interactions , which are dominant in the sm , and the hi##ggs coupling to @ xmath28s is possible . we will also look at the behavior of the higgs interaction ratios , as shown in fig . [ fig : widthbr ] . note in particular the expansion of @ xmath34 over a wide range , and the sudden onset of @ xmath35 . this is followed by the @ xmath31 symmetry , which gives a significant reduction of the @ xmath36 - quark yukawa , and the introduction of the gauge weak interaction . see also the introduction of the @ xmath37 mode . this will make production at the lhc difficult . the reduction of the coupling to gauge bosons also means that production at the ilc will be reduced , making this higgs a very difficult particle to produce . however , it will be necessary to measure the higgs interactions with precision to identify a new fourth dimension in the standard formulation of particle physics , if indeed this is what is realized in nature . john a . anderson , arxiv : astro - ph / 0505074 . l . randall and r . sundrum , phys . lett . * * * , 3370 ( 1999 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 990##5221 ] . j . a . goldberger and j . a . smith , phys . * 83 * , 4922 ( 1999 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9907447 ] . h . davoudiasl , j . l . hewett and t . g . rizzo , phys . lett . * 83 * , 2080 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9909255 ] . h . davoudiasl , j . l . hewett and t . g . rizzo , phys . b * 473 * , 151 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9911262 ] and phys . b * 83 * , 075004 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0006041 ] ; a . pomarol , phys . b * 486 * , 153 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9911294 ] ; a . grossman and a . neubert , phys . b * 474 * , 361 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9912408] ; g . gherghetta and g . pomarol , nucl . d * 586 * , 141 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : j - ph / 0003129 ] . s . agashe , m . delgado , m . j . garcia and s . sundrum , jhep * 0308 * , 050 ( 2003 ) [ arxiv : j - ph / 0308036 ] . c . csaki , c . grojean , t . murayama , l . pilo and j . terning , phys . d * 70 * , 055006 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : j - ph / 0305237 ] . c . csaki , c . grojean , l . pilo and j . terning , phys . * 70 * , 101802 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : j - ph / 0308038 ] . a . cacciapaglia , c . csaki , c . grojean and j . terning , phys . d * 70 * , 075014 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : j - ph / 0401160 ] and phys .d * 71 * , 035015 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0409126 ] ; m . cacciapaglia , m . csaki , m . grojean , m . reece and m . terning , arxiv : astro - ph / 0505001 . s . nomura , jhep * 0311 * , 050 ( 2003 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0309189 ] . m . barbieri , m . pomarol and g . rattazzi , phys . d * 591 * , 141 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0310285 ] . m . davoudiasl , j . l . hewett , b . smith and t . g . rizzo , phys . d * 71 * , 015006 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0312193 ] and jhep * 0405 * , 015 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0403300 ] ; j . l . hewett , b . smith and t . g . rizzo ,jhep * 0410 * , 014 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0407059 ] ; a . a . chivukula , a . j . simmons , y . h . lee , t . kurachi and t . tanabashi , phys . d * 60 * , 075008 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0406077 ] and phys . d * 603 * , 210 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0408262 ] . a . birkedal , a . matchev and a . perelstein , phys . * 94 * , 191803 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0412278 ] . a . csaki , j . grojean , j . hubisz , a . shirman and j . terning , phys . d * 94 * , 015012 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0310355 ] .
