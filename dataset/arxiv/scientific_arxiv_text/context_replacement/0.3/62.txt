galactic x - ray sources have a wide range of temporal variabilities ( from milliseconds to years ) . but none of these is as exotic and diverse as the x - ray intensity variation observed from the black hole microquasar grs 1915 + 1 ( castro - tirado , brandt , & miller 1992 ; greiner , morgan , & remillard 1996 ; morgan , remillard & greiner 1997 ; muno , morgan & remillard 1999 ) . this source is one of two known galactic x - ray sources that exhibit superluminal radio jets ( mirabel & rodrigues 1994 ) . the presence of gravity waves and radio jets in hi indicates that the source is behind the spiral arm at a distance of 12 . 5 @ xmath3 kpc ( mirabel & rodrigues 1994 ) . this distance limits visible / infrared sources to weak sources with energies greater than 1 micron ( mirabel et al . the source is likely to be a black hole ) because of its spectral and temporal similarities with the other known x - ray source with superluminal radio jets , gro j1655 - 40 ( zhang et al 1994 ) , which has a frequency distribution function indicative of ablack 2002 . ( bailyn et al . 1995 ) . estimates for the mass of the compact disk in grs 1915 + 1 range from 1 to 10 @ xmath4 . even with the uncertainty of distance , its peak x - ray luminosity is very high , i . e . , @ xmath5 km / sec , which is also the peak value for the @ xmath6 @ xmath4 object . in spite of these observations it has been especially illusive to study the x - ray light curve of grs1915 . it is not entirely clear that even the short time scales caused by the variability have been successfully explained . belloni et al . ( 1997a , b ) account for the observations with an instability model in which the inner disk component ` ` remains ' ' in the high - rate state , and is only observed on a viscous time scale . the parameters of their model are : the inner disk component , @ xmath7 ; the mean effective temperature of the disk @ xmath8 , and an ad - hoc non - thermal power source ( which is possibly present in the inner corona ) . although no detailed theoretical model for the instability is given , some interesting observationsof behavior for @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 , as well as several other observables , were derived from the data , and the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter was found to be very small ( which may indicate that the standard viscosity parameter is wrong for this source ) . the rather small values of @ xmath7 found in these experiments can be used to distinguish between different models of the thermal flow of grs 1915 ( see below and [ sect : previous ] ) . abramowicz , chen & taam ( 1995 ) suggested a model for the high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) observed in some x - ray sources , in which a disturbance in the _ _ _ _ disk leads to very irregular oscillatory behavior . with these observations , this model could reasonably be expected to account for at least some of the temporal behavior of grs 1915 + 105 as well ( taam , chen & wang 1997 ) . however , it appears to us that the model of abramowicz et al . ( 1995 ) and taam et al . ( 1997 ) has an error in the heating / cooling equation for the corona which, when correct , constrains their model to have the same stability properties as the thin shakura - sunyaev disk , and is therefore unlikely to explain the grs 1915 + 105 observations ( see figure 2 ) . we note more generally in appendix [ sect : framework ] that neither a thin central region , nor an advection - like flow , nor a ` ` slim ' ' cold disk are compatible with the observations of grs 1915 + 105 . ( ` ` slim ' ' accretion disk theory was examined in the most detail by abramowicz et al . 1988 ; it is similar to a standard thin shakura - sunyaev disk , except for the central flow , which incorporates the radial flow of energy into the black hole . ) in this chapter , we attempt to undertake a more detailed study of the models observed in grs 1915 + 105 in the context of the ` ` cold disk @ xmath9hot ##e ' ' picture . in [ sect : framework ] we present a general framework that will aid us in our development of a general ( though somewhat ad - hoc ) prescription for the model in cases where the energy flux is substantial ( [ sect : framework ] ) . the details of our new modelto solve the time - dependent disk problem with the use of this new viscosity equations are given in [ sect : code ] . in [ sect : previous ] , we present the results of our time - dependent disk experiment . the calculated light curves are found to agree well with the other results of grs 1915 + 105 . in particular , the light curve shape and duty cycles are in perfect agreement with the observations . also , the comparison of the transit rate with the average accretion rate , @ xmath10 has the same effect . however , there are important disagreements as well . we then present a more elaborate model in [ sect : jet ] , where , in accordance with the observations ( e . g . , mirabel & rodrigues 1994 ) , the inner disk is expected to release some of its energy in the form of a non - rotating disk . we assume that the ejected energy is not observed as x - rays , but rather that it ultimately is radio waves . we find that this more elaborate model agrees with the grs 1915 + 105 observations much better , thus indicating that we are finally developing a first order model of the geometry and the most important phenomena of this inner disk . in [ sect : previous ] we presentour results in the light of the previous observations on grs 1915 , and in [ sect : discussion ] we reach our conclusions . figure 1 shows three panels of typical x - ray light emission from grs 1915 taken with the rxte instrument ( see , e . g . , morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ) . it appears that the spectrum undergoes a limit - cycle pattern of decay ; the peak values in panels ( a ) ( b ) are @ xmath1 2400 , 1000 , 1200 , and 800 ms , respectively . within the pattern shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) there appear several more quasi - periodic oscillations of a shorter time scale . the shortest time scale over which a significant change in the x - ray spectrum occurs is @ xmath1 1000 sec . we will associate the longer behavior with the geologic time scales of the underlying dust disk , whereas the more extreme behavior will be associated to the geological time scales . the x - ray spectrum of grs 1915 + 105 varies greatly with x - ray intensity ; and the spectral type is highly correlated ( or non - correlated ) with intensity ( e . g . , belloni et al . 1997a , b ; ta##am et al . 1997 ; muno et al . " today , the source is typically found to be composed of a multi - phase disk component , hereafter the thermal component " , and a power - law component with a single temperature index . however , the source has a wide range of qpos with central frequencies in the range of 0 . 01 - 10 hz . the amplitude and phase of the qpos appear to be strongly correlated with the spectral lines of grs 1915 + 105 ( am et al . 1997 ; muno et al . 1999 ) . the idea of using a single disk component to test time - dependent phenomena in accretion disks around black holes is not new ( e . g . , taam & lin 1984 ; lin & taam 1994 ; and also discussed below in this section ) . but let us examine in more detail how the various disk components relate to the properties of grs 1915 + 105 in general . for very large disks the advection of energy is not possible . the viscous time scale is much longer than both the thermal and hydrostatic time scales ( see wang et al . 1992 ) , unless @ xmath11 which is unlikely for this source ( belloni et al . 1997b ). in this case , however , the equation for vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and the relationship between thermal losses and radiative losses should be considered . it is customary and practical to plot the disk effective temperature @ xmath12 versus the energy balance @ xmath13 to investigate the stability properties of disks . in the one dimensional case , the equation for ##static equilibrium in the vertical disk is @ xmath14 where @ xmath15 is the radius of the black hole , @ xmath16 is the scale factor and @ xmath17 is the surface distance from the central object . the gas pressure is given by @ xmath18 ( for electron dense disks ) , where @ xmath19 is the mid - plane pressure , @ xmath20 is the proton pressure , and the electron pressure is @ xmath21 . the energy balance equation is given by @ xmath22 where @ xmath23 is the electron radiation pressure , @ xmath24 is the penetration pressure of the disk , @ xmath25 , and @ xmath26 is the radiative losses ( assumed to be caused by electron thermal expansion ) , @ xmath27 is the diffusion coefficient( see , e . g . , shapiro & teukolsky , 14 . 2 ) , and @ xmath28 is the keplerian angular momentum . as we noted earlier , in the standard shakura - sunyaev theory , the stress tensor is proportional to the specific pressure , @ xmath29 we can then combine with ( [ eq1 ] ) ( [ ss ] ) to calculate the stress tensor and then derive the expression to obtain the @ xmath12 @ xmath13 curve for a given viscosity . in addition ( [ 1 : scurve ] ) we have some other @ xmath12 @ xmath13 curves to help in our selection of @ xmath0 . the second line is the curve that the standard shakura - sunyaev model with @ xmath30 const ##rued . such a curve becomes thermally and viscously unstable when the slope of the @ xmath12 @ xmath13 curve is negative ( e . g . , frank et al . 1992 ) , which would be a good result in the case of the model observed in grs 1915 + 105 . however , the above stress curves require a thermal - stable acc##retion occurs for the low - energy state as well , which is _ not predicted _ by the standard model ( shown at the bottom of app . 1 ) . this prediction ( as made by belloni et al . 1997a , b and taam et al . 1997 ) is supported by the fact that in some cases the high energy state of the source is even longer than the low energy , which is presumably the only gas - phase - dominated state . the @ xmath12 - @ xmath13 system that has a stable high - luminosity state is shown in figure ( [ fig : scurve ] , s curve ) . it has the name ` ` s - shape ' ' , derived from the studies of the thermal stability observed in solar sources ( e . g . , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 , meyer & pringle 1982 , cannizzo , rossi & livio 1995 , and rossi et al . 1992 , app . 1 ) or from studies of radiation - pressure - dynamics in , e . g . , taam & lin ( 1984 ) and lin & taam ( 1994 ) . it is well known that solutions of an s - shape that have a stablethey are unstable . in short , when the @ xmath12 - @ xmath13 flow has an s - curve , the unstable region of the solution oscillates between the two unstable branches of the flow , which gives rise to the high and low luminosity regions . so far , we have not observed flows where advection is involved . as adafs ( spin dominated accretion flows ) will be discussed in [ sect : adaf ] , here we concentrate on the slim solid disks ( abramowicz et al . these flows produce a very stable @ xmath10 solution , with the higher temperature being due to the faster cooling ( energy transfer ) via advection . however , the s - curves produced by these flows produce the upper stable branch for @ xmath31 solution ( see , e . g . , see fig . 2 in chen & taam 1993 ) . in other words , if one were to place the upper stable branch of the slim solid disks on our graph ( [ fig : scurve ] ) , then it would look similar to the corresponding lower branch of the solid disks on the graph , except that it would be positioned higher by a factor of about @xmath32 ( for a given @ xmath13 ) . however , if one assumes that an unstable state of the disk is a transition from the unstable branch of the s - process back to the stable branch , and that @ xmath13 remains approximately constant during this process , then the rotation rate in the inner disk will increase by too much a factor of a few hundred to several thousand to reach the stable advective state . while this may not be a problem in terms of the luminosity output , since most of the disk is rotating inwards and the luminosity of the disk saturates at @ xmath33 ( see fig . 2 in szuszkiewicz , malkan & abramowicz 1996 ) , the gravitational waves produced will always be very spiky and the duty cycle of the high state is always much higher than the values of @ xmath34 that were first measured in grs 1915 + 1 . the main cause of the outburst behavior is the vast difference between the accretion rates of the high and low states . as we will see here in [ table : 1 ] , an outburst occurs because ` ` too high ' ' mass ( column : @ xmath##13 ) has now accumulated to the maximum possible stable state of @ xmath35 ( i . e . , @ xmath13 is the lower half of the s - axis in figure [ 1 : scurve ] ) . if the high - state decay rate is very much larger than the low state decay rate , it probably takes only a very short time in the high state to remove this extra mass from the slim disk . in other words , it would not be possible to maintain mass conservation if the decay rate remained in the high state for very long . this is also evident from the temperature curves calculated for slim disks by szuszkiewicz & colleagues ( 1998 , see their pages 7 - 9 ) . however , we note that slim disks are more likely to fully account for the effects of grs 1915 + 1 , at least , if one has a theory capable of explaining all of the variations in this source . the model of our slim disk model is that of the standard shakura - sunyaev configuration ( except for the central component ) , with a perfect corona . here we present the set of equations that we use to follow the temporal evolution of this disk ; these equations are applicable to all known viscos##ity ##b . further discussion of the law itself is needed until [ sect : prescription ] . the two euler equations for conservation of mass and angular momentum in the disk ( see , e . g . , frank et al . 1992 ) can be combined in the following way to yield the equation describing the expansion of the energy density : @ xmath36 \ { \ } \ , , \ label { eq4 } \ ] ] where all of the terms , except for @ xmath37 , were used in the previous section . thus @ xmath37 is the term that is related to @ xmath0 by @ xmath38 = @ xmath39 . the time - dependent energy equation describes the heating and cooling components of temperature ( [ eq2 ] ) , but should also be extended to take into account large time components of temperature , and therefore includes a number of additional terms . the form of the energy equation that we use is the formalism of abramowicz et al . ( 1995 ) with some modifications , and is given by @ xmath40 \ nonumber \ \ = f ^ { + } - f ^ { - } - { f \ over 1 } \ ,{ \ , ( \ f _ r \ ) \ , \ { r } + \ , \ dot { eq5 } \ dot { r } \ ] ] where @ xmath41 , @ xmath42 is the ratio of the radiation to the gas constant , @ xmath43 is the ratio of specific entropy ( @ xmath44 ) and @ xmath45 is given by abramowicz et al . ( the radial direction @ xmath46 is given by the standard formula ( fig . 5 . 2 of wilson et al . 1992 ) : @ xmath47 . \ label { vr } \ ] ] the terms on the left hand side of equation ( [ eq5 ] ) represent the specific time derivative ( e . g . , @ xmath48 ) of the specific entropy , and the terms on the right represent the thermal diffusion , the energy flux in the radial direction , the diffusion of energy in the radial direction , and the thermal diffusion of thermal energy . following cannizzo ( 1993 ; and others cited therein ) , we define @ xmath49 $ ] to be the specific energy flux carried by viscous thermal diffusion , where @ xmath50 is the specificheat at room temperature . @ xmath51 is the accretion disk heating rate per unit area , and is given by @ xmath52 the radiation flux in the horizontal direction . @ xmath53 the total radiation flux ( rather than simply that from radiative cooling ) in the vertical direction is given by @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 is the fraction of the energy that is transferred to the disk area by means other than the usual thermal diffusion ( cf . abramowicz et al . 1995 , svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) . terms ( [ heatr ] ) and ( [ fvert ] ) differ from those used by abramowicz et al . ( 1995 ) for concepts that are described in appendix b . we note that in the most general sense , the quantity @ xmath56 should be thought of as a factor determining the total energy flux in the total energy transport equation . in our understanding of the theory , it is computationally irrelevant whether this amount of energy is deposited in the corona and radiated by a non - thermal power - law component , or it contributes to the blackbody radiation flux , since we are concerned only with the bolometric properties ofthe same for now . the worst case could be avoided if this additional energy source were to replace the original source below the surface of the disk . of course , if our model produces energy curves that are in reasonable agreement with those of grs 1915 + 105 , then a future model , one that would better fit the different energy sources , will be necessary . equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , together with the equation of thermal equilibrium ( [ eq1 ] ) , are a closed set of coupled , time - dependent equations for evolving the variables t and @ xmath13 . for solving these equations we have a simple explicit formula with a fixed time scale . the time scale is chosen to be only a multiple of the smallest possible time scale in the disk ( i . e . , in its inner boundary ) . we also use a fixed radius in @ xmath17 . the spacing is uniform in @ xmath57 , and we use up to 300 sample points . we will also refer to the radial coordinate in a dimensionless way , i . e . , @ xmath58 , where @ xmath59 is the schwarzschild radius . the outer boundaryof the disk is fixed at a fixed radius , @ xmath60 to tens to a thousand , so that the disk at @ xmath61 is not gas - gas dominated . however , the outer boundary conditions are given by @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 for @ xmath64 , where @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 are the radius and the column is in the shakura - sunyaev formulation of that radius for the given @ xmath67 , @ xmath10 and @ xmath68 , where @ xmath69 is the viscosity law for a gas - dominated disk ( see below ) . the inner boundary of the disk is fixed at @ xmath70 , and the boundary conditions there are @ xmath71 and @ xmath72 . in this section we present our own viscosity law that we developed to account for the observed behavior of grs 1915 + 105 . the shakura - sunyaev viscosity law states that the viscous pressure at @ xmath27 is given by : ( [ ss ] ) , where the radius @ xmath0 is defined as @xmath73 and where @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 are the mean - length and scale - length , respectively , @ xmath76 is the rotational speed , and @ xmath77 is the nova ##tric magnetic field energy density . obviously , this approach is valid only when @ xmath0 is approximately constant , i . e . , independent of the internal thermodynamic state of the gas , which is probably the case in a number of cases . whenever the internal state of the accreting gas changes significantly , it is hard to see why @ xmath0 would not exist . one example of this is the well - known spin ( ionization ) behavior of the solutions of the nova ##e ( e . g . , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 ; bath & pringle 1982 ; cannizzo , chen & livio 1995 ; and li et al . 1992 ; 5 . 8 ) . it has been shown in this paper that the @ xmath0 - value tends to be larger on the high stability branch than it is on the unstable branch of the model . some more recent research suggests that , in general , @ xmath0 should have apower - law dependence on @ xmath78 , e . g . , @ xmath79 , in order to explain the observed rapid temperature decline of the neutron star outbursts ( cannizzo et al . 1995 ; vishniac & smith 1996 ) . further , based on theoretical considerations , different authors have proposed different versions of the prescription for @ xmath27 when @ xmath80 . for example , lightman & eardley ( 1974 ; hereafter le74 ) , and miller & rosner ( 1984 ; hereafter sr84 ) suggested that @ xmath81 where @ xmath69 is a constant . their theoretical formulation is based on the expectation that the magnetic fields should be generated by the gas itself only . in contrast , sakimoto & coronitti ( 1989 ; @ sc89 ) showed that even if one assumes that magnetic fields are primarily generated by radiation - absorbing materials , magnetic pressure actually expels these fields from the gas . since the gas itself must be produced to a large extent by magnetic fields , this also implies that the @ xmath0 - parameter must decrease when the gas itself is dominant . an important feature ofthis stability prescription ( fig . [ le ] ) ignores the fact that it is stable only when @ xmath80 , as shown by the positive feedback provided by this model for the track in @ xmath12 @ xmath13 free space ( see the stability curve in fig . [ 2 : scurve ] ) . at the same time , however , this viscosity prescription ( to which we will refer as the lightman - eardley prescription ) describes no unstable region at all , and thus fails to explain the unstable region described in grs 1915 + 1 . of course , the results of le74 , sr84 and sc89 should be regarded as speculative , at best , since it is not always feasible to describe the electric and magnetic fields immersed in a radiation - dominated fluid in a quantitative and time - efficient way . in this paper , we adopt the view that it may still be possible to couple the radiation to the particles ' collisions and thereby allow the radiation pressure to contribute to the viscosity when @ xmath82 is not too large . for example , sr84 argued that the energy density in the applied electric field does not exceed the particle energy density , since it is the case thatgenerates the magnetic fields in the first place . however , as long as @ xmath83 , the magnetic field pressure does not exceed the gas pressure ( because then @ xmath84 ) , so that the sr84 parameters are superfluous . to put our model into a simpler form , we have adopted a viscosity prescription somewhere between those of shakura - sunyaev and lightman - eardley . our viscosity law is proportional to the total pressure for small to medium values of @ xmath42 , while for large values of @ xmath85 , it is proportional to the gas pressure . we have adopted the following simple formula for the second law that smoothly joins these two parameters , such that @ xmath0 is replaced by @ xmath86 where @ xmath87 is an unknown parameter . the s - curve plotted in figure ( [ fig : scurve ] ) was derived from this viscosity law with @ xmath88 . there are only 5 other parameters of the model that need to be specified and / or systematically tested to ascertain the accuracy of the results to their values : ( _ i _ ) the black hole radius , @ xmath15, ( _ ii _ ) the stellar rotation rate , @ xmath10 , ( _ iii _ ) the aspect ratio , @ xmath69 , for the star - dominated region , ( _ iv _ ) @ xmath87 , the measured mass @ xmath82 , and ( _ v _ ) @ xmath67 , the fraction of the luminosity carried out by means other than radiative diffusion . we selected a value of @ xmath89 , which is typical of the measured mass of galactic black hole stars in binary systems ( see , e . g . , barret et al . 1996 ) . for purposes of comparison , we chose a value of @ xmath69 relative to @ xmath90 , since it corresponds to viscous ##ity processes similar to those observed . finally , we selected a value of @ xmath91 , in part because it produces a reasonable light - curve . finally , we used a range of other values as well ( from @ xmath92 to @ xmath93 ) , and found that @ xmath94 matches the grs 1915 + 1 observations very well . we used a very differentcycles and series of the following runs in the solar corona in figure ( [ fig : feqo ] ) and ( [ fig : sol _ tau _ distr ] ) , respectively , for each cycle of two parameters : @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 . in figure ( [ fig : temp _ tau _ distr ] ) , parameters ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) are the values of the solar effective temperature @ xmath97 , the ratio of radiation to gas pressure ( @ xmath85 ) , the disk angular optical velocity @ xmath24 and the radial optical velocity @ xmath98 . note that since we are currently working only with the curve integrated over all the parameters , we define @ xmath97 to be the emissivity from _ both _ the corona and the disk , i . e . , @ xmath99 , where @ xmath100 is defined by = ( [ fvert ] ) . in this case , the series of parameters are for all periods of @ xmath101 sec . the curve with the smallest value @ xmath10##2 ( where @ xmath103 ) . the upper right part of figure ( [ fig : t _ tau _ distr ] ) refers to the part of the disk formed at the start of the outburst . the outburst starts in the innermost part of the disk , when a few particles of the smallest radii can make a transition to the most stable branch of the disk ( high state ) . although this is not obvious from above . ( [ fig : t _ tau _ distr ] ) , the viscosity of the high state is greater than it is in the low state , because @ xmath104 , and , even though @ xmath0 decreases , the increase in @ xmath76 and @ xmath16 leads to a larger @ xmath37 . the increased viscosity allows the gas to transfer of its angular momentum quickly , thus allowing a faster entry of the gas into the black hole . because of this momentum transfer , the angular momentum of the gas that enters into the black hole is transferred to smaller @ xmath17 , where it produces an increase of angular momentum , and then some matter then flows to smaller @ xmath17 , which is seensee figure ( d ) of figure ( [ fig : temp _ tau _ distr ] ) for a change in the radial velocity equation . a density wave is generated and propagates from the inner disk to the @ xmath17 ( cf . [ fig : tau _ tau _ distr ] a ) . this wave is often referred to as either a ` density wave ' or a ` pressure wave ' . as the wave travels outward , the material on the inside of the hole becomes hot and shifts into the high pressure state . it then rapidly loses its angular momentum and is sucked into the inner disk , where the material continuously flows into the hole . since the most important region is a ` ` bottle - neck ' ' for the hot gas , some material ends up there , which explains the instability of @ xmath13 in that region as shown in figure ( [ fig : tau _ tau _ distr ] c ) during the process . when the density wave reaches @ xmath105 , the instability stops , since the disk in that region is not high - pressure dependent ( for the example @ xmath10 and @ xmath67 ) . .the density wave fades out , the remaining unstable regions are emptied of the excess mass and cool off . they are now in the low viscosity state , and so the rate of mass flux into the innermost regions of the disk increases . an inward expanding density wave is formed and the wave dies out . the remaining excess mass from the unstable region disappears into the hole . finally , a new cycle begins with the release of new excess mass ( since the local accretion rate is lower than the average rate ) . we now systematically tested the disk behavior with the low viscosity state , in order to directly compare the results with the gross disk behavior of grs 1915 + 1 . we found an energy - level @ xmath67 = 0 . 26 . as with the previous models , we also tested a wide range of values of @ xmath67 , and found that @ xmath106 is the most stable due to the physical properties . the threshold for the onset of the decay is : @ xmath107 0 . 9 for @ xmath108 0 . 9 , and expressed as : @ xmath109 ^ { - 9 / 2 } \ label { dmo } \ ] ]( see svensson & zdziarski 1994 and note that their value of @ xmath10 differs from ours by a factor that accounts for the full disk radiative efficiency , i . e . , @ xmath110 ) . it seems that observationally that @ xmath111 should be lower by a factor of at least @ xmath112 than the value of @ xmath113 due to the transition from the temperature - to - energy - ratio regime of the standard model . however , if we assume that the extreme luminosity of @ xmath114 erg sec @ xmath115 observed in grs 1915 + 105 corresponds to the upper limit for this region , then the instability appears to occur only for @ xmath116 . in addition , other black hole clusters ( gbhcs ) with a more persistent temperature , or more stable structure , have not exhibited such extreme instability as grs 1915 + 105 does , and therefore none of them are as bright as @ xmath117 ( see , e . g . , barret , mcclintok & grindlay 1996 ) . we will consider the instability @ xmath67as in [ sect : gross ] . in figure ( [ sect : lcurves ] ) we see the stability of the resulting disk structure as a function of time for the minimum values of the values listed above and for @ xmath118 @ xmath119 , 0 . 31 , 0 . 26 , and 1 . 5 . in comparison with figure ( [ dmo ] ) , we find that for values of @ xmath10 and 0 . 31 the disk is stable , because there is no radiation - - like effect on the disk . we also find , in general , that as the value of @ xmath10 increases , the maximum value ( i . e . , the fraction of time that the disk is in the stable state ) increases , from approximately 10 % when @ xmath118 0 . 26 , to approximately 50 % when @ xmath118 1 . 5 . similarly , the ratio of maximum to minimum values of the disk increases with increasing @ xmath10 . the time for the disk to complete one of its cycles ( known as the cycle time ) also increases with @ xmath10 , except for very near the maximum value of @ xmath118 0 . 26where the instability only appears in ; here the cycle time actually decreases with increasing @ xmath10 . the reason is that there seems to be a ` ` critical excess mass ' ' in the inner disk region , such that the instability will appear only when the mass of the disk reaches this value . the formula for building up the excess mass is @ xmath120 , where @ xmath111 is the maximum possible accretion rate given by the ( [ dmo ] ) , and so a significant increase in @ xmath10 or @ xmath111 will bring about a significant decrease in the cycle time . for larger burst rates , the cycle time tends to increase with the burst rate , because a larger region of the disk is affected , and it takes longer to clear the excess mass during the outburst . we will then compare our model presented in panel ( [ 1 : lcurves ] ) with that of grs 1915 + 105 . we should note at the outset that it seems a difficult task to attempt to explain with a simple model the diverse , unstable behavior exhibited by this system , but we expect to benefit from a comparison of even the simplest properties of our model with the data . " ( a )of figure ( [ fig : lcurves ] ) is similar to figure ( [ fig : data ] . ) in that of both figures there exists a second phase of mass accumulation ( the low state ) . furthermore , an examination of the grs 1915 + 1 data shows that the # ##al event occurs when the mass accumulation rate is lower than @ xmath121 m / sec , so that there actually is a threshold accretion rate at which the event does not occur . in addition , the spiky nature of the data is explained by the fact that only a very narrow region at @ xmath17 of the data is unstable , and it takes very little time to get rid of the excess mass in that region . the similarities with fig . ( 1a ) are mainly due to the fact that an outburst in the data does not occur to completely remove the excess mass , and that more oscillations follow with a gradually declining rate , whereas in the simulation the low state persists until all the excess mass is absorbed by the black hole . panel ( a ) of fig . ( [ fig : data ] ) is also very similar to panels ( b ) and ( c ) of the simulations ( fig . [ fig : lcurves ] ) .the progression of time scales and the average luminosity ( i . e . , roughly speaking , the decay rate ) from panel ( a ) to ( b ) in fig . ( [ fig : data ] ) is similar to that from panel ( a ) to ( b ) in fig . ( [ fig : lcurves ] ) as well . the main reason for the cycle time being shorter with increasing @ xmath10 is that the excess mass can build up faster for higher accretion rates . however , panel ( c ) in fig ( [ fig : data ] ) is also interesting from the point of view that the excess energy is long lasting and is clearly stable at least for the first time . panel ( c ) of the simulations does account for some of the effects of this variability pattern . in particular , the duty cycle increased in both the simulations and the data as the accretion rate increased . the cycle time did not increase fast enough in the simulations , however . it could be made longer by adding a panel @ xmath69 , but then the time scales in all the other panels would increase as well , which does not seem likely . also , the similar trend seen in the first three panels ( a - c ) in both the simulationsand the simulations show that the graph of each burst curve shows a slight upward rise in brightness as the burst sets off . this is a clear indication of the disk expanding slowly until it reaches a critical instability . we note that panel ( d ) of figure ( [ fig : 1 ] ) appears to be quite different from the other disk variability panels . if the high state is again defined as the one with high count rates , then the peculiarity of panel ( d ) is that the count rate first decreases and then increases by the time of the high state occurs . this is the opposite of what is seen for the other states , such as that shown in panel ( e ) of fig . ( 2 ) . from a theoretical point of view , this is a very interesting phenomenon . in all of our simulations , we observed that as the burst progresses , the amount of mass in the local disk region builds up because of the greater and greater release of mass from larger radii . when in a stable ( high or low ) energy state , the local disk density is equal to the local disk density @ xmath13 , which can be seen from figure ( [ fig : scurve ] ) . therefore , during an explosion , the lumin##osity occurs only when the outer disk settles down and the transfer of mass stops , leading to a decrease of @ xmath13 in the inner disk . however , the observed behavior of the disk is such that the mean time of @ xmath122 is always negative , never positive as seen in panel ( d ) of figure 1 . we do not have a clear reason for this change in the parameters of the current model , but we will assume that there would be a natural explanation for this change if a jet were present ( [ sect : jet ] ) . also , we note that in a few of the panels in question ( [ fig : lcurves ] ) , the first ( and sometimes even the last ) peak in the phase curve is of slightly lower intensity and duration than the peaks that come later in the sequence . this is probably a consequence of the disk adjusting to its semi - regular cyclic pattern and graduating from the same boundary conditions that are satisfied by the shakura - sunyaev model up to the mean value of @ xmath10 . let us now discus the rather extreme case for @ xmath67 invoked here , which means that as much as @ xmath123 of the accretion process is carried out ofthe latter involve processes other than the usual radiative diffusion . if this process is either convection or some other mhd mechanism heating the corona , then there appears to be a correlation with the flux of grs 1915 + 105 . the luminous flux in the spectrum of this source is generally small in the low state , but it can be large in the high state ( muno , smith & remillard 1999 ) . one could say here that as much as @ xmath124 of the x - rays emitted from the source towards the disk may be absorbed into the soft disk region , ( e . g . , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) if the absorption / emission takes place in a _ neutral medium _ ( especially in the sense of high - density elements like nickel and iron , that are important for the reflection spectrum ) . however , in theory , the luminous flux could exceed that of the non - neutral regime by the figure @ xmath125 ( see eqs . 1 and haardt & maraschi 1991 with their figures @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 ) . the very low inferred disk flux of grs 1915+ 105 , e . g . , @ xmath128 kev ( belloni et al . 1997a ) , rules out the possibility of neutral reflection , however . as shown by nayakshin & miller ( 1998 ) and nayakshin ( 1998 ) , the integrated albedo of the electromagnetic spectrum in the vicinity of a strongly rotating disk can be much higher than the standard 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 of the neutral reflector ( i . e . , @ xmath129 in fig . 2 of haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , and so it seems difficult to estimate @ xmath67 as high as 0 . 2 given the large amount of soft matter ejected from the disk . a possible way out of this dilemma is that the standard distribution of @ xmath67 does not accurately reflect the energy flux from the disk into the corona . indeed , equation ( [ fvert ] ) shows that the energy flux out of the corona will be @ xmath56 ##0 higher than that reflected by the standard distribution of energy . diffusion of energy in the opposite direction ( e . g . , bisnovatiy - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ; miller & wandel 1995 ; and according to##in ) is one physical phenomenon that can speed up the transfer of energy out of the disk . mhd electrons dissipating their energy before they reach the corona could be another . in addition , there is no proof that the vertical cooling mechanism ( i . e . , a one dimensional approximation ) used in the large - disk theory does not lead to a significant increase of the vertical energy of ##es of the disk . for example , if @ xmath130 , where @ xmath131 is , then @ xmath111 becomes @ xmath132 ( = sz94 ) , and thus we could have @ xmath111 as large as that observed in grs 1915 + " due to a new or simpler vertical - cooling mechanism rather than due to the transfer of some of the disk energy into the corona . it is possible that model ( s ) of . . ( [ see : data ] ) shows rapid corona cooling as fast as @ xmath1 tens of times at the end of the high period , whereas our models do not show a similar phenomenon . also , note that the rise / fall time scales are smaller in the model than they are in our models . "note that the heating of the unstable region in grs1915 occurs on a time scale that is very much longer than the average time . in contrast , the outermost part of the unstable region of the simulated disk becomes unstable only after @ xmath133 the duration of the hot burst , that is of the order of the average cycle time for the high energy cases . the explanation given could be that these fast oscillations are called upon by the disk to make a state transition from the high to the low state . further , during these fast oscillations the disk is much brighter than it is in the low state , which could be interpreted as an indication that only a part of the disk ( most likely the innermost part ) in grs 1915 + 1 takes part in these rapid oscillations , whereas the rest of the simulated disk is still on the upper stable end of the s - state . for this to be true , the inner disk must be able to differ to some extent from the rest of the unstable disk , and be variable on a much longer time scale than the outer disk . to test this idea , we have carried out several experiments in which the @ xmath0 - parameter is a constant functionof course . our understanding is that in this case , since @ xmath0 in the inner disk is smaller than that in the outer disk , the time scale for oscillations of the inner disk will be much shorter than the average relaxation time , which explains the term @ xmath134 ( e . g . , wang et al . 1992 ) . in fact ( [ fig : variable _ alpha ] ) we show one such simulation , in which the reference value was chosen to be @ xmath135 $ ] . this modified form allows the @ xmath0 - value to be roughly @ xmath136 for the inner disk region ( @ xmath137 ) , and to be @ xmath138 for @ xmath139 . the presence of these two time scales is obvious just from a comparison of the observed phase curves . simulations of the inner disk produce the # ##s of the initial peak in fig . ( [ fig : variable _ alpha ] ) . the relative magnitude is small because the amount of kinetic energy available in the inner disk is small compared to that in the outer disk . furthermore , in the simulation the inner disk differs from the outer disk .at the beginning of the outburst , not at the end as is seen in the grs 1915 + 105 data . this is due to the fact that once the outer disk undergoes a transition to the high state , the large mass transfer to the inner disk forces the disk to go into the high state as well and remain cool . in addition , replacing the @ xmath0 - parameter with radial distance does not seem to be a sufficient explanation for the rapid thermal oscillations observed in the data which are dependent on the very short time - scale of evolution . an alternative way of explaining the exponential decay could have been provided if the heating / cooling fronts disappear and are reflected back by cooling / heating fronts . this behavior was observed in simulations of the classical thermal dust disk studied by cannizzo ( 1993 , see also above his equation 5 ) , where it happened to be an observed phenomenon . however , we have not been able to find any stalled transition fronts ( except for the case described in ref . [ 1 : variable _ alpha ] ) , which should not be too surprising , due to the fact that the underlying mechanism of the ionization disk and the one explored in this paper are vastly different , and one would not expect a direct correspondence between theseseveral reasons . although we will not present actual light curves , we should mention that we have also attempted to allow the expression @ xmath67 to be a function of @ xmath85 , since the transition from @ xmath140 to @ xmath141 means a significant change in the physical conditions of the system . our hope is that the freedom in the @ xmath142 might help to reproduce the disk flickering . however , all our attempts in this regard ( with @ xmath67 decreasing and increasing with the freedom in @ xmath85 ) have been unsuccessful . although our model is able to reproduce a lot of the observed trends seen in the light curve of grs 1915 + 105 , the rise / fall time scales are always larger in the data than they are in the simulations . the observed rises and falls are probably the reason why the shape of an outburst in some of the actual light curves of grs 1915 + 105 ( e . g . , the ( s ) of fig . [ fig : c ] ) is reminiscent of a half - moon spiral shape rather than the linear shapes that the outburst shows in the simulations ( see fig . [ fig : lcurves ] d ) . the difference betweenour simulations and the data are new enough to us to consider the addition of a new feature to our model and test whether it will bring the data closer to the observations . the following considerations have guided us in choosing the additional features of our model . the speed with which the hot state propagates outward in the closed disk is equal to the speed of the transition front , which was studied theoretically by , e . g . , meyer ( 1984 ) and then by menou , hameury & stehle ( 1998 ) . both of these studies find that the average speed of the transition wave is @ xmath143 . the time scale for the transition wave to reach the unstable region of level 1 is @ xmath144 , i . e . , the transition in the model will take @ xmath145 times longer than the average time scale of the larger part of the closed disk region . this is the reason why the rises and falls take so long in the simulations compared to the data . also , note that during the first stage of the transition from the low to the high state , the temperature rises very rapidly in the disk ( see figure [ 1 : lcurves ] below ) , at a rate probablyas well as that observed in the disk . however , if some physical process managed to ` ` cut ' ' the observed light curve of , say , @ xmath146 , so that anything observed by the disk at this time _ is not seen _ by the observer , then the observed profile would be much more consistent with the data . to find a process able to ` ` cut ' ' the light curves , we should assume that the plasma ##s are known to occur in grs 1915 + 1 ( e . g . , mirabel and rodriguez 1994 ) . however , eikenberry et al . ( 1998 ) , mirabel et al . ( 1997 ) and fender & pooley ( 1998 ) have shown that there is a strong correlation between the x - ray emission and emission in the infrared and radio bands . the radio and infrared emission is related to the ejection events taking place in the outer part of the disk . the minimum pressure level at the center of the jet ( that may consist of the emission events ) was found ( e . g . , gliozzi , bodo & ghisellini 1999 ) to be as high as @ xmath147 / @ xmath148 / / @ x##math115 for the model first proposed by mirabel and rodriguez ( 1994 ) . during later studies ( e . g . , eikenberry et al . 1998 ) , the thermal emissions had a factor of @ xmath149 greater than the ones discovered by mirabel & rodriguez ( 1994 ) , which still may require @ xmath150 and @ xmath151 values of @ xmath115 ejected into the jet , which is as large as the largest x - ray energy produced by the source . however , if one were to model these thermal effects in the framework of our model , one would have to allow for a large amount of the thermal _ energy _ to be ejected into the jet . from here on , we can therefore see that the total galactic disk power @ xmath152 consists of two parts : the first is the x - ray luminosity @ xmath153 , that is equal to the sum of the thermal thermal and non - thermal coronal luminosities ; and the second part @ xmath154 is the ` ` thermal energy ' ' , i . e . , the energy ejected into the jet . for .we will assume that the disk power is not present in x - rays , and therefore not in the infrared or other non - x - ray wavelengths . as before , the locally produced total disk power is given by : ( [ fvert ] ) , where we will again assume that @ xmath155 . the total luminosity is then @ xmath156 where @ xmath157 is the fraction of power that escapes from the disk into the atmosphere . this fraction ( @ xmath158 ) may be a constant , or it may be a function of local disk conditions or a function of a global variable , e . g . , the total disk power @ xmath152 . since the fraction of cooling due to the radiative cooling is roughly given by the fraction @ xmath159 , and since according to our model in the [ see : geometry ] @ xmath160 of this source , the fraction of cooling is not present in our model . thus , the total x - ray power @ xmath153 will consist from the disk power ( = @ xmath161 of the total disk power ) and the jet power which is given byan equation similar to that ( [ lj ] ) except with a jet @ xmath162 instead of @ xmath158 in the disk . to minimize the error of our calculation , we assume that the jet power is divided among the disk , the corona , and the jet as @ xmath161 , @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 , respectively . we should also mention that the amount of mass carried away by the jet is small compared to that going into the black hole , so we minimize the error in the mass conservation ( eq . [ eq4 ] ) . the second rule is very simple : if the ultimate source of the jet power is the entire galactic corona , then to produce one jet proton in the jet , all electrons in the jet must transfer their gravitational energy ( which is small compared with their own energy ) to that one jet proton . these electrons would then have to go into the black hole in order to produce another proton into the jet . more precisely , the net outflow rate is @ xmath165 , where @ xmath166 ##₀ is the terminal bulk lorenz factor of the jet . thisis to be compared with the flow rate of the jet , that is equal to @ xmath167 , where @ xmath168 is the ` ` radiative ' ' efficiency of the jet and @ xmath152 is the total disk energy . accordingly , @ xmath169 since @ xmath170 . this equation is very conservative . for example , if the jet power is increased by magnetic fields or by electron - hole interactions , then the energy carried away by the jet is much smaller . a further consideration allows us to estimate the angular momentum outflow from the disk into the jet . we point out however that the latter value depends on the speed of the jet ; if the charged particles also gain a considerable amount of the angular momentum as they are carried away from the disk , then the shock induced by the jet on the disk may be non - negligible . we want to explore these questions in future papers . eikenberry et al . ( 1998 ) found that the shock waves were absent during the low state and present at the surface and during the high state . we therefore can accept a parameterization of @ xmath158 such that it is close to zero when theit is in the low state , and it is very large ( but much less than that , of course ) when the disk is in the high state . we will explore some more illustrative prescriptions for the function @ xmath158 to show the possible effects of the driving power being converted into a jet . let us assume that the disk @ xmath158 is described by the following ( very carefully chosen ) equation : @ xmath171 where @ xmath172 is the total energy of the disk in terms of its surface luminosity . this equation is not reasonable since one expects particles to be ejected from the disk when the luminosity @ xmath102 approaches ( and thus exceeds ) the upper limit . while the radiation may not reach the full driving power of the disk , the increased pressure may cause more particles to be ejected and thus produce stronger jets . we show in detail ( [ fig : steady1 ] ) the total x - ray absorption curve ( straight line ) and the total disk luminosity @ xmath152 ( represented by a spherical curve ; scaled down by the factor of 2 to fit the figure ) for an ideal disk @ xmat##h173 . note that the overall light curve is the same as we would have had with our basic model for the same choice of @ xmath67 and @ xmath10 , but with fewer air bubbles ( see [ sect : basic ] & [ sect : basic ] ) . the intensity of the outburst indeed is less than a square - root , and even the rises and falls appear to be sharper than they are for the choice with @ xmath174 , thus making it possible to reproduce this feature of the overall light - curve ( in particular , panel ( c ) of fig . [ fig : data ] ) . as a further example , we have the following formula for the jet burst : @ xmath175 ( this prescription , in addition to the one provided by fig . [ [ fj1 ] ] , was chosen among several that we used to reproduce the panel ( c ) and ( d ) of fig . [ [ fig : data ] ] simultaneously as described in [ sect : test3 ] ) . the corresponding x - ray light curve and the total luminosity of the burst are shown in red ( [ sect : steady2 ] ) . one notices that the profile of the system inx - rays are now emitted with respect to the actual radiated power . when the jet contains most of the energy fraction , the x - ray light curve also has a peak component , since most of the energy is absorbed into the jet during that period . this effect may be responsible for the ` ` s ' ' shape of the disk shown in figure ( 1 ) of image ( [ fig : 1 ] ) . as a final step we consider a sequence of light curves described by our model with a fixed value for the total energy fraction @ xmath158 and with the accretion rate as the only parameter that is varied . the energy dependence of @ xmath158 is again given by : . ( [ fj ] ) . then , motivated by the fact that the x - ray energy can vary wildly when it is in the high state ( see fig . 1 ) , whereas it does not fluctuate as much in the low luminosity state , we expect the fraction @ xmath67 far away from the disk other than by the usual linear diffusion to fluctuate around some point . thus , the @ xmath67 - factor will now contain the _ factor of @ xmath176 , andthat @ xmath177 : @ xmath178 where @ xmath179 is the radius , is at the randomly chosen value of @ xmath180 , @ xmath181 is a random number distributed uniformly between - 1 and + 1 ( a new value of @ xmath181 is randomly chosen every 3 years ) , and @ xmath182 is a function of radius @ xmath183 such that it approaches unity for the inner disk and it approaches unity for @ xmath184 . the latter model dependence is ignored here to avoid confusion with the inner disk condition at @ xmath185 , where we expect the disk structure to be that given by the gas - like shakura - sunyaev configuration with a radius @ xmath186 ( see [ sect : 1 ] ) . the value of the function @ xmath187 is also completely invariant for the resulting light curves as long as @ xmath188 is large , since none of the disk structures is derived from the inner disk structure . finally , although the last term on the right hand side of the equation ( [ ft ] ) appears to be linear and model - dependent , its presence is not, and serves only to make the light curve look even more random . most of the final results of this paper depend on the correct choice for the random part of @ xmath67 . figure ( [ fig : xandj ] ) shows the resulting x - ray light curves for the different expansion rates . it is like comparing figure ( [ fig : xandj ] ) with figure ( [ fig : lcurves ] ) , in which the random ejections and random fluctuations in @ xmath67 are ignored . the case with the gas jet just above @ xmath111 ( i . e . , panel d in fig . [ fig : lcurves ] ) has not been studied as much as that with the higher expansion rate ; this is of course due to the fact that little light is extracted from the jet in the former plane than with the latter . the panels ( b ) and ( c ) do look quite random , which is entirely due to the random part in the plane @ xmath67 ( see fig . ( [ ft ] ) . analyzing panels ( c ) and ( d ) of this paper , one finds that it turns out to be impossible to makeboth the sharp square - shaped ' pattern ( c ) and the ` ` inverted ' ' pattern ( d ) of figure 1 with the _ z _ symbol for @ xmath158 . it is the same pattern , i . e . , the disk ejection , that allows our model to better fit the simulation ( panel [ c ] and [ d ] of fig . 1 ) ; the only difference is that in panel ( c ) the energy component of the disk energy is much larger than in panel ( d ) . for the purpose of comparison , we will model the fusion power @ xmath154 with a dotted curve in space . ( [ fig : jet1 ] ) according to the results presented in panel ( c ) of fig . ( [ fig : xandj ] ) . given the very good agreement between the simulations and the observations of grs 1915 + 105 , we believe that we may have a better understanding on the physical characteristics of accretion from this source . although we are less certain about the shape of the dotted - curve in the @ xmath189 space , we believe that the geometry of the plasma produced in grs 1915 + 105 is that of a geometrically thin and infinitely thick disk (( [ sect : geometry ] ) . most of the x - ray luminosity is supplied by an extremely thin disk , that may cover the entire solar disk or consist of localized solar corona flares ( e . g . , haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; nayakshin & smith 1997 ; nayakshin 1998 ) . in the latter case , the ratio @ xmath67 of the power transported from the disk into the corona and the jet must be thought of as a time averaged variable . further , we believe that plasma ejection events may be an integral part of the accretion process , and are likely to be the result of an extremely large radiation pressure . we will address this issue in a similar way in [ sect : geometry ] . belloni et al . ( 1997a , b ) were the first to fit the data in grs 1915 + 1 with a two - component model , consisting of a multi - temperature disk - jet with a variable inner disk radius and a power - jet . very quickly , these authors found that much of the inner disk variability could be explained by a small change in the inner disk radius @ xmath7 and a corresponding change in the size of thedisk instability @ xmath7 . they have also shown a correlation between the disk filling time r and the inferred temperature of the inner disk . our results are qualitatively similar to the results of the disk instability found by belloni et al . for grs 1915 + 105 since in the low state the inner disk is relatively dim ( up to a factor of 10 - 20 , see figure [ 1 : 2 ] ) compared with what it should have been if the disk were stable . thus , the inner part of the disk can be largely dim and can be said to be ` ` normal ' ' . at the same time , in the high state , the inner disk is brighter than the overall disk by typically a factor of a few , which can make the outer part of the disk ( that is , and so carries all the ` ` normal ' ' flux ) appear comparatively dim . under these conditions , it may be non - desirable to distinguish observationally between a disk where the temperature is a constant function of r ( @ xmath190 ) and a disk where the temperature is lower than expected for the outer part of the disk , since the outer disk carries a small fraction of the overall flux . in addition ,the inner disk is almost completely devoid of gas in our simulations , although the difference between the inner disk surface temperature in the high versus that in the low state may be a factor of @ xmath1 few to 10 ( see fig . [ ref : dim _ z _ distr ] . ) . note that @ xmath7 as calculated by belloni et al . should be identified with the largest radius produced by the gravitational wave in our simulations . more precisely , during the high state , @ xmath7 should be defined as the radius of the central region , whereas during the low state it is approximately equal to the largest radius of the disk produces which @ xmath191 ( i . e . , @ xmath192 for example . [ 1 : 2 ] ) . our values of @ xmath7 are in general much larger than those calculated by belloni et al . the value of @ xmath193 obtained from the observations could be larger if one were to fit the grs 1915 + 105 emission with a less intense ( and likely more diffuse ) spectrum than a multi - spectral spectrum appropriate for a shakura - sunyaev disk . moreover , for the high accretion rates observedin this source , the star would be effectively optically thin and thus behave as a modified ( rather than a pure ) blackbody ( see discussion in taam et al . since blackbody radiation produces the same flux for a given temperature , the resulting flux would be a larger @ xmath7 . however , the values of @ xmath7 obtained by experiment would also be smaller for a kerr black hole . we hope to answer this question in the future . belloni et al . ( 1997b ) showed that the outburst duration is proportional to the duration of the preceding quiescent phase , but there is no correlation between the former and the initial period of the outburst . measurements of periods in our data are not available , so we assume we have a correlation among these three quantities in comparison to the belloni et al . data . on the other hand , in many studies ( other than the one presented in belloni et al . 1997b ) grs 1915 + 105 does not show a good correlation between the duration of the outburst and the preceding quiescent phase ( t . belloni 1999 , selected papers ) . we have thoroughly studied the physical mechanisms underlying the behavior of grs 1915 + 105 , and have arrived at several important conclusionssee the structure of the time - dependent accretion rate in this article . as mentioned in appendix [ 1 : 2 ] , very thick advection - dominated flows are unsuitable for this effect , since they would produce burst - like instabilities with a very high duty cycle compared to those shown in the figure , for decay rates smaller than the observed value . to produce bursts as long as @ xmath194 days , geometrically thick disk flows would have implausibly high values of @ xmath0 . however , if the accretion rate is highly super - eddington , then a large adaf burst could yield bursts with a reasonable duty cycle ( @ xmath34 ) . but since the viscous temperature scale for very thick flows is as short as the thermal scale , their light curve would be rather flat which further limits the effect ( see , e . g . , panels c & d of fig . it is also unclear how the observation ( e . g . , belloni et al . 1997a , b ; muno , a & remillard 1999 ) that the disk extends outward to the innermost elliptical orbit during the high state can be reconciled with the structure of ageometrically flat , spherical and optically thin spheres . for these reasons , the standard model gas disk with a high power density , hot core , and plasma envelope seems to be the only reasonable choice . as we have shown in this paper , this model also allows us to make a good general agreement between the theory and observations , and to understand the features of the light curve in terms of specific physical processes . however , a casual reader may question whether the very large number of parameters introduced by us in this work allows us to pin - point the value of these parameters . we hope that the answer to this question is ` ` no ' ' , because these constraints , applied only sparingly here , may prove to be quite restrictive for future studies . for example , we have shown about the total ultraviolet light curve in this paper , whereas the data also provide a lot of information about the spectral properties of grs 1915 + 105 ( belloni et al . 1997 ; muno et al . 1999 ) . if future observations also provide more details of the light - temperature connection ( e . g . , eikenberry et al . 1998 ) , then we have a means of determining the dependence of both @ xmath158and the total effect @ xmath67 on the observed spectrum . further , we should also attempt to explore the possibility that the transient and the black hole bursts do not exhibit behavior similar to grs 1915 + 1 , at least not to the same extreme extent . however , putting all these experimental and theoretical constraints together may be very useful in limiting the theoretical possibilities for the model and the burst and jet bursts . as an example of the need for a theoretical analysis of the burst and qpos in the context of our model , we point out the following . from the results of muno et al . ( 1999 ) it appears that qpos are present when the power - law instability affects the burst , which usually occurs in the low state ( ` ` low ' ' means the lower count rate ) . however , these results suggest that for the burst , similar to the one shown in fig . 1 ( d ) , the qpos are present during the ` ` high ' ' state , which is similar to that of the other cases . if qpos indeed track the onset of a vigorous burst , this would imply that although our panel ( d ) in fig . ( [ fig : xandj ] ) looks similar to the. . ( d ) , it does not explain the actual situation very well . however , the models seem to imply that the higher count rate states will have higher count rates in the inner disk than the lower rate states ( because excess luminosity escapes into the jet ) . it is thus possible that plasma ejections occur during the sharp phases in fig 1 ( d ) rather than during the short phases ( e . g . , from @ xmath195 to @ xmath1 960 ##0 in this example ) . the ` ` m - shape ' ' of the outbursts in fig . ( [ fig : data ] . ) may then be understood because these would be the high states being tracked by the accretion disk , and the high states of the three main regions ( a - c ) of fig . ( [ fig : data ] ) show similar shapes albeit with lower count rates . although we have not yet made a detailed study of this phenomenon , we can easily accommodate it within our model , but only if we allow the parameters of our power law to depend on the plasma geometry . _ note , however , that in this case we will need plasma data from the inner disk in order to understand1 ( d ) of fig . ( 1 ) . _ the discussion above of course focuses on the particular choice of the viscosity law that we have presented in this paper . we know that our model is still largely empirical and we have not identified the exact physics of the second law in grs 1915 + 1 . the actual model might therefore be much more complex , and in fact , the existence of the s - curve might be due to other than radiation pressure instabilities , possibly causing an effect that we do not fully understand . however , based on the data presented in this paper , we are confident that there is an s - curve in this model , and that this curve can be described exactly by the viscosity law given in above ( [ eq3 ] ) . a clear example of our work is the formation of a non - rotating disk around a non - spinning black hole . we plan to use this in our future work . we hope that this will change the ` ` reasonable ' ' values of the parameters that we used , such as the fraction @ xmath67 , and the inner radius r , of interest , but that it will not change the general ##ity of our conclusions . the authors thank t . r##oni , m . taam , m . muno , j . smith , j . remillard , a . vishniac and a . kazanas for further discussions . this work is funded in part by research grants nag5 - 8239 and nag5 - 4057 , through the string theory program .
