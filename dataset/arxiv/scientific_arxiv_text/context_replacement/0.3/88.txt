having been discovered more than a century ago @ xcite , these waves become one of the most important waves in plasmas . em waves ( also known as em in solid state physics ) are high - frequency ( l ) ( in analogy with the electron - cyclotron frequency , @ xmath0 ) left - handed , polarized ( rcp ) electromagnetic ( em ) waves generated almost by the external magnetic field in dense plasma . because of the increase of their wave size with the frequency , @ xmath1 ( see , e . g . ref . @ xcite ) , the lf waves decay later giving them a strong down - effect even at atomic level . stenzel in his classic paper stenzel demonstrated experimentally the existence of magnetic field - induced plasma perturbations caused by the ponderomotive force exerted by the em waves . whistler waves are produced not only in space plasmas due to particle - particle interactions , but also in terrestrial plasmas using helium for efficient plasma production as well as in dense astrophysical plasma whistlertheory1 , whistlertheory2 , mi , whistlertheory3 ( nearsonic ) , whistlertheory4 , whistle##rtheory5 , whistlerparametricinstability . on the other hand , large amplitude whistlers waves in a magnetized plasma can cause a great variety of plasma effects , e . g . , light - wave interactions , parametric effects @ xcite , modulational effects and the envelope wave formation whistlertheory1 , whistlertheory2 , mi . the latter which , in turn , cause an overall density increase and reduction in plasmas , are considered as a tool for understanding the plasma properties of pellets @ xcite , pulsar radiation interaction with the ambient magnetosphere ambientmagnetosphere , whistler wave formation in solar wind solarwind etc . recent the experiment @ xcite and data from the freja spacecraft @ xcite show the clear evidence for the formation of large amplitude solitons accompanied by high density electrons . moreover , electrons in van allen radiation belts can be accelerated to mev energies within a short time by large amplitude waves @ xcite . the latter have also been observed by the cluster spacecraft @ xcite , the stereos cattell and the themis @ xcite . furthermore , the experiments @ xcite and the confirmation @ xcite havedemonstrated the interaction of the whistler spheromaks with fields beyond the ambient magnetic field . whistlers also contribute to quantum plasma reconnection and plasma dynamics in two - beam laser - solid density plasma interaction experiments @ xcite . recently , there has been a notably growing interest in investigating various quantum plasma effects in view of some experimental results in nanoscale plasma @ xcite , ultracold plasma @ xcite , spintronics @ xcite and plasmonics @ xcite . on the other hand , superdense quantum plasma are found in other physical objects , e . g . , the interiors of massive white dwarfs , interiors of jupitors , magnetars etc . @ xcite , as well as in the next most intense laser - solid density plasma interaction experiment @ xcite . in quantum mechanics , degenerate electrons follow maxwell - dirac power laws , and there are strong magnetic forces associated with the bohm de ##hn effect , which causes spin dispersion in nanoscales quantum1 , quantum2 , quantum3 . furthermore , the motion of the electron is by itself in terms of the magnetic field field , as well spin coupling , which can be describedby extending the pauli equations to fluid - like variables @ xcite . more elaborate kinetic models have also been developed @ xcite . hence the dynamics of electrons in a degenerate plasma can be affected not only by the electromagnetic field , but also by the effects of the statistical mechanics , the bohm force as well as the effects due to intrinsic spin of electrons . we ought to mention that in a dense magnetized plasma there can exist em waves , which can be generated by intense magnetic fluxes . therefore , nonlinear models of em waves , in particular those in very dense plasmas need to be developed in their own right , for all these quantum effects . recently , the theory of the ponderomotive force in plasmas has been developed to account for the contribution from the intrinsic spin of electrons @ xcite . it has been demonstrated that an em pulse could affect a spin - dominated plasma with this spin - ponderomotive force ( spf ) . such force could also play an important role in the propagation of lf density waves , e . g . , whistlers , alfvn waves . our objective now is to conduct a detailed study of the em wave packets interacting nonlinearly with the lf density .that is reinforced by the positive ponderomotive force ( cpf ) @ xcite as well as the interaction @ xcite . the effects of the ion ##osphere as well as the scattering effects due to charge separation and the electron tunneling are also taken into account . we will consider the locally aligned velocity perturbation ( of electron density ) associated with the lf motion , and in turn , generalize the related experimental results that exist in the literature ( see , e . g . , refs . whistlertheory1 , whistlertheory2 ) . the above results could be useful for understanding the behavior of the em field which can occur in the interior of hot white dwarfs , magnetars as well as in the next generation intense laser - solid state physics experiments . let us consider the propagation of nonlinearly distributed em whistlers and ion - electron ( ia ) density perturbations along a constant em field @ xmath2 in a quantum metal - ion system where any local drift velocity is zero . in the modulational case , the high - frequency ( hr ) h - field for the rcp system is given by @ xmath3c . c . , where @ xmath4 is theslowly varying ( both in space and time ) components of the whistler h - field and e . c . p for the complex numbers . finally , @ xmath5 @ xmath6 is the electron wave function ( frequency ) . the basic equations for the spin of the electrons , are spin1 , spinponderomotive , spinevolutioneqn . @ xmath7 @ xmath8 @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 @ xmath11 @ xmath12 denote the electron spin , charge and mass of , respectively , @ xmath13 is the electric field and @ xmath14 is the electron partial energy . finally , @ xmath15 is the electron angular momentum with its absolute value @ xmath16 @ xmath17where @ xmath18 is the electron @ xmath19 - factor and @ xmath20 is the - factor . the equations ( [ b1 ] ) - ( [ b3 ] ) are then replaced by the first two equations with @ xmath21 . @ xmath22 @ xmath23the equations ( [ b1 ] ) - ( [ b3 ] ) representthe nonrelativistic evolution of the @ xmath24 follows , and is applicable even when spin states with spin - up and spin - down ( relative to the magnetic field ) can be accurately described by a weighted average . this does , however , apply in the regimes of very strong magnetic fields ( and a few low temperature plasma ) , where generally the electrons occupy the highest energy spin states . on the other hand , for a time - scale longer than the spin - down frequency , the equilibrium spin state is well - described by the standard equilibrium spin model , and in this case the above equations can easily be applied . however , the case in which the macroscopic spin state will be changed by a factor decreasing the absolute value of @ xmath25 below @ xmath26 , will not be directly applicable in the present work . as a result , our work will be focused on the regime of strong magnetic fields and high temperature plasmas . taking the form of eq . ( [ b2 ] ) and using fig . ( [ b3 ] ) - ( [ b5 ] ) we can obtain the following evolution equation for a . @ xmath27 \ notag \ \ & - \frac { 2 \ mu } { - \ hbar } \ frac { \ partial } { \ partial t } \ left [ \ frac { 1 } { m _ { e } } \ nabla \ times \ left ( \ nabla \ times m _ { e } \ mathbf { t } \ right ) \ right ] + \ frac { 1 } { m _ { e } \ m _ { e } n _ { e } } \ nabla \ times \ left [ \ left ( \ nabla \ times \ mathbf { t } \ right ) \ times \ mathbf { t } \ right ] + \ frac { 2 \ mu } { m _ { e } \ hbar } \ nabla \ times \ left ( a ^ { a } \ nabla n _ { e } \ right ) \ notag \ \ & - \ frac { \ varepsilon _ { e } } { m _ { e } n _ { e } } \ nabla \ times \ left ( \ frac { \ times \ mathbf { t } } { \ partial t } \ times \ mathbf { t } \ right ) - \ frac { 2 \ mu } { -_ { e } \ hbar n _ { e } } \ nabla \ times \ left [ \ left ( \ nabla \ left n _ { e } \ mathbf { a } \ right ) \ times \ mathbf { a } \ right ] . \ left { ev } \ end { e } \ ] ] in the linear limit , the wave number @ xmath5 and the wave number @ xmath28 are related by the following nonlinear dispersion relation in the nonrelativistic limit ( see for details , cf . @ xcite ) . @ xmath29 where @ xmath30 is the magnetic frequency , @ xmath31 is the wavelength corresponding to the induced spin , and @ xmath32 is the electron skin , with @ xmath33 is the electron ( s ) spin depth . also , @ xmath34is the electron - cyclotron frequency and @ xmath35 is the electron spin - spin frequency . the nonlinear behavior of whistler spin plasma is the combination of the spin , associated with the spin ia , and of the magnetic phase - shift induced by the magnetic ##ally aligned free streaming of electrons withthe speed @ xmath36 can be calculated by the following nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) - type equation which is derived from the em ##f ##g ( [ 3 ] ) , @ xmath37where @ xmath38 and the group velocity , @ xmath39 [ see eq . @ xmath40 ( 11 ) , cf . @ xcite ] and the magnetic dispersion , @ xmath41 of which is given by @ xmath42 @ xmath43 . \ ] ] the nonlinear ##ity , @ xmath44 is given by @ xmath45 , \ label { 3 } \ ] ] where @ xmath46and @ xmath47 is the relative plasma temperature . by solving the above , we can recover the previous equation @ xcite . note that the term @ xmath48 , the doppler shift due to the plasma streaming along the external magnetic field , is no longer relevant , but will be added to the previous two terms , and will therefore change the sign of the nonlinearity as well . more specifically , both @ xmath49 and @ xmath44 will change their sign depending on the frequency .to be considered as well are the terms from the spin correction term . finally , we will see that the change of sign is necessary for the formation of the spin packets at the higher frequencies . the quantities @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 are related to each other by the electron modulation equation . @ xmath52 note that the ponderomotive force associated to the magnetic whistlers usually drives the lf ( compared to the electron wave frequency @ xmath5 ) density waves which propagate along the field lines with two - phase speed ( compared to the electron wave frequency ) . thus , the lf density wave equation satisfies the angular momentum equation @ xmath53where @ xmath54 is the spin component of the electron density field and @ xmath55 @ xmath56 is the fermi speed relevant for a low density , @ xcite . where @ xmath57and @ xmath58 is the boltzmann constant . the term @ xmath59 is the spin correction term with the bohm de broglie potential . the ponderomotive force terms are related to the terms @ xmath60 and @ xmath6##1 where @ xmath62 of which the first two appear due to cpf @ xcite and the last two @ xmath63 are due to the magnetic spinponderomotive . the equations for the magnetic shock waves observed in the experiment in ##m are @ xmath64 @ xmath65 @ xmath66 ##and @ xmath67 @ xmath68 @ xmath69 and disregarding the equations @ xmath70 we obtain from eqs . ( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) - ( [ 8 ] ) the driven coupled equation for the ##v of the boussinesq - theory is @ xmath71where @ xmath72and @ xmath73 @ xmath74 is the ion - screening speed and @ xmath75 is the ion screening speed for electrostatic ##s . thus , we obtain a system of three coupled equations , namely ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) , derived from the results by the experiment and the theory , which describe the strong interaction of the ion .with the same quantum mechanical coupling matrix . these results can be obtained by rotating the coefficients back to @ xmath76 @ xmath77 , in which case we get @ xmath78 @ xmath79and @ xmath80 n \ notag \ \ & = \ lambda _ { 1 } \ frac { \ partial ^ { 2 } } { \ partial t ^ { 2 } } \ left ( 1 + \ frac { \ partial ^ { 2 } } { \ partial t ^ { 2 } } \ right ) | z | ^ { 2 } - \ lambda _ { 1 } \ frac { \ partial ^ { 2 } } { \ partial t \ partial t } \ left ( 1 + \ frac { \ partial ^ { 2 } } { \ partial t ^ { 2 } } \ right ) @ xmath81 @ xmath82 @ xmath83 @ xmath84 is the quantum coupling constant , @ xmath85and @ xmath86 . ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 12 ] ) are the original results of the original experiment . in particular , the results @ xcite can be obtained by rotating##ing the spin contribution @ xmath87 as well as the particle contribution @ xmath88 and using , e . g . , the standard equation of state ( valid for low and moderate density plasmas ) . in this case we will study the behaviour of the whistlers by solving numerically the eqs . ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 12 ] ) for the stationary state @ xmath89 ( where @ xmath90 @ xmath91 . we will consider the different regimes for the density and the magnetic field for which the nonrelativistic fluid model is valid and which are restricted to the cpf . we will also note that the case in which spin dominates over the cpf will correspond to the strongly interacting superdense plasmas where relativistic treatement may be observed . however , before proceeding further to these , let us first consider the special case in which the dispersion due to spin separtion ( quasineutrality ) is negligibe . the latter can be observed even when the spin particles dominate , i . e . , @ xmath92 @ xcite . from the equation @ xmath93wenote that the quasineutrality of @ xmath94 holds for nonrelativistic ( @ xmath95 ) plasmas as well as @ xmath96and @ xmath97 @ xmath98 . thus , we can see that in a single plasma regime , these conditions can be satisfied for all the ( @ xmath99 @ xmath100 ) plasma systems . in this case , @ xmath101 combines and @ xmath102 @ xcite with @ xmath103 so , when @ xmath104 the output from the system @ xmath105 @ xmath106 will be larger than that @ xmath105 @ xmath107since @ xmath108 thus , in the quasineutral case , we get from fig . ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 13 ] ) the following nls : . @ xmath109together with @ xmath110then we can use eq . ( [ 14 ] ) for @ xmath111 , where @ xmath112 is written as @ xmat##h113where @ xmath114 physically , the electrons resist a net force exerted at the front of the electromagnetic pulse , and thus gain a net energy . the electrons gain energy during the longitudinal front of the pulse , but are slow down by the backward ponderomotive - nuclear force . thus , they can approach the group velocity of the whistler when it reaches the energy peak at the front . from fig . ( [ 2 ] ) , we see that this can be done for @ xmath115 , which can happen for a whistler pulse like @ xmath116 and for high temperature ( @ xmath117m @ xmath118 ) and highly cooled ( @ xmath119 t ) pulses . in this case , the fermi energy can exceed the critical speed ( @ xmath120 ) . on the other hand , referring to the poles as in fig . 2 above , @ xmath121 and @ xmath122 mean that @ xmath123 @ xmath124 and @ xmath125 respectively , means that the electrons can freely move along the lines of the external magnetic field . the group velocity per##turbations would also require an additional density change in order to satisfy the conservation of energy ( conservation of continuity ) under such conditions . thus , the first density change after the phase - change is @ xmath126 where @ xmath127 ) and ( [ 19 ] ) with associated electric field @ xmath128 ( upper panel ) and density change @ xmath50 ( lower panel ) for @ xmath129 ( solid line ) and @ xmath130 ( dashed line ) . the other parameter values are @ xmath131m @ xmath118 , @ xmath132 ##m , @ xmath133 , @ xmath134 @ xmath135m / s @ xmath136 , width = 288 , height = 288 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) with associated electric field @ xmath128 ( upper panel ) and density change @ xmath50 ( lower panel ) for @ xmath137 t ( solid line ) and @ xmath138 t ( dashed line ) . the other parameter values are @ xmath131m @ xmath118 , @ xmat##h129 , @ xmath139 the two @ xmath90 terms are @ xmath140 ( solid line ) and @ xmath141 ( liquid line ) . , width = 288 , height = 288 ] clearly , @ xmath142 changes phase whenever the spin term @ xmath87 of fig . ( [ delta ] ) dominates over the other two terms . thus , for lf waves of light , @ xmath143and as in the previous example , @ xmath144 @ xmath145 is smaller compared to @ xmath146 when the spin term dominates . similarly , for the quasineutral wave system , the amplitude and frequency components are positive and negative such as the plane wave ##front , subsonic or back [ see ref . ( [ 22 ] ) ] . however , the light ( plane ) wave solutions of fig . ( [ delta ] ) allow for the modulational effect ( stability ) when @ xmath147 for lf and @ xmath148 when @ xmath149 , @ xmath150 @ xmath151 and @ xmath15##2 according to @ xmath153 hence , a possible stationary state of the mi could be a small ( subsonic ) bright ( dark ) star - like object in a quasineutral or stationary state . # ( [ 2 ] ) gives an exact numerical solution ( when @ xmath112 and @ xmath154 have the same parameters ) of the [ @ xmath155 , \ ] ] where @ xmath156 are constants . the two special cases , namely the quasistationary lf density problem ( i . e . , @ xmath157 for which @ xmath158 @ xcite and the case of bragg scattering ( near sonic ) ) in which the quasineutrality is not a stable solution @ xcite will not be discussed here as those solutions are not directly relevant to the time frame to be considered , so we will focus on our main problem . ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 13 ] ) . first , we look for the solutions of eqs . ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 13 ] ) in the stationary frame @ xmath89 . then we find @ xmath##159 to be of the form @ xmath160where @ xmath128 is a real function and @ xmath161 is a real function . ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 12 ] ) corresponding to @ xmath162 @ xmath163where @ xmath164 we can solve the equations ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) using the method with the boundary of @ xmath165 @ xmath166 @ xmath167 @ xmath168 ##s @ xmath169 . we expect the electric and magnetic field components to vary between @ xmath170m @ xmath118 and @ xmath119 ##s . figure 1 illustrates the combination of t - waves and the envelope ##s with the frequency values for the combination of components : @ xmath171m @ xmath172 @ xmath173 t , @ xmath174 and @ xmath175 the corresponding parameters are @ xmath176s @ xmath177 @ xmath178 and @ xmath179s @ xmat##h180 ##m , @ xmath181 @ xmath182 m and @ xmath183 m / s . thus , the whistlers have negative group size with @ xmath184 from the above , we obtained @ xmath185m @ xmath177 which corresponds to whistlers with a density of @ xmath186 m , and the sound speed is @ xmath187 m / s . thus , the same frequency shift is obtained with @ xmath188 . the energy depletion is observed is small due to the group size ( compared to the sound speed ) of the sound waves . in the example ( fig . 2 ) with a higher magnetic field , we presented a dark - cloud - like structure correlated with a dark hump . the intensity of the light waves decreases as the magnetic field increases . in fig . 3 we have presented the same structure when the density is very low ( @ xmath189m @ xmath118 ) . this also corresponds to the structure when @ xmath190 however , in this case one must note that the sound speed is close to or may even be larger than thespeed of light is general and therefore , nonrelativistic quantum mechanical model will no longer be appropriate . the quantum parameter @ xmath191 plays no important role for the problems considered here , it can be seen that @ xmath192 mainly dominates in the term @ xmath193 [ ex . ( [ 1 ] ) ] , because of large particle size ( @ xmath194 ) . in order that @ xmath191 can be reduced to @ xmath90 , one would need to consider much higher temperature @ xmath195m @ xmath196 and weakly magnetized @ xmath197 ##m . however , in this case the coefficient @ xmath198 ( @ xmath199 ) will be much higher than the other coefficients , which will prevent any search for a solution . as shown in fig . 4 , one can consider a nondiverging system with a higher temperature coefficient than other terms , e . g . , @ xmath200 @ xmath201 @ xmath202m @ xmath118 and @ xmath173 , for which @ xmath203 @xmath204 @ xmath205 m / s , @ xmath206 , @ xmath207 m / s , @ xmath208 m / s . this value corresponds to a pulse , with electric field - ( density per ( @ xmath209 ) and ( [ 19 ] ) with associated electric field @ xmath128 ( upper panel ) and density per @ xmath50 ( lower panel ) for @ xmath210 ( solid line ) and @ xmath211 ( dashed and dotted ine ) . the other three values are @ xmath132 ##m , @ xmath212m @ xmath118 ( for solid and dashed line ) and @ xmath213m @ xmath118 ( for dotted line ) , @ xmath214 . the values of @ xmath90 are @ xmath215 ( for solid and dashed line ) and @ xmath216 ( for dotted line ) . , width = 288 , height = 288 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) with associated electric field @ xmath128 ( upper panel ) and density per##turbation @ xmath50 ( front panel ) for @ xmath217 @ xmath132 ##m , @ xmath218m @ xmath118 , @ xmath219 . the wave parameters are @ xmath220 @ xmath221 m / s . , width = 288 , height = 288 ] nonlinear behavior of the magnetic pump em waves @ xmath222 with the magnetic field . perturbations @ xmath223 will rise up and lower in bands with amplitude and wave shape . @ xmath224 and @ xmath225 the latter interact with the pump and thus produces a nonlinear ponderomotive wave which eventually reinforces the induced magnetic force . when all the perturbations are aligned with the applied magnetic field , the nonlinear behavior of em waves can be described from eqs . ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 12 ] ) using the following linear equations . @ xmath226 \ notag \ \ & = 4v _ { 0 } e _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \ left ( 1 - \ & ^ { 2 } \ right) \ left ( \ gamma _ { 1 } + + \ gamma _ { 2 } \ omega \ right ) \ right ( ( \ gamma _ { 1 } + \ omega \ omega \ right ) , \ lambda { 1 } \ lambda { 2 } \ ] ] where @ xmath227 and @ xmath228 @ xmath28 have been replaced by @ xmath100 and @ xmath229 respectively . further steps can be in progress . note that under the quasineutrality assumption , the coefficient of @ xmath230 @ xmath231 and the term @ xmath232as well as the term @ xmath233 in the coefficient of @ xmath234 do not appear . however , for higher values of , @ xmath235 @ xmath236 is faster and thus much faster . thus , the term of the form @ xmath237 in the coefficient of @ xmath238 ( which is due to the non - zero @ xmath51 ) and the constant of @ xmath239 appears as @ xmath240 and we need @ xmath241 forspin effects to be considered . however , in this case the above expression reduces to @ xmath242where @ xmath243 in which @ xmath244 etc . are also used . clearly , this sets out for case of nonlinear : @ xmath245 or @ xmath246 for highly nonlinear medium and when @ xmath247 the growth rate of instability @ xmath248 is then given by @ xmath249 hence , in the short - wavelength case ( @ xmath250 maximum growth rate of instability can be considered , and is roughly proportional to the pump wave magnetic field @ xmath251 and @ xmath252 for which , in fig . 1 , we see @ xmath253 which basically reduces the particle length - scale to a minimum length for the decay of the solitons through scattering . in the present section focusing on pump waves we point out that the spin effect is zero when @ xmath254 i . e . , when @ xmath255 and @ xmath256 this corresponds to the case in which the magnetic field is , @ xmath257 and the particlethis is very small , i . e . , @ xmath258m @ xmath118 for which the magnetic field is non - uniform and does not affect the thermodynamic motion of electrons . however , in some cases , the electron velocity may equal or exceed the ia group speed ( close to @ xmath259 in the above study ) , and so the nonrelativistic quantum mechanical model may no longer be necessary to consider . in the latter case , we have considered @ xmath119 ##m and the density to vary in the direction @ xmath260m @ xmath118 in order that the nonrelativistic fluid model is valid to some extent . moreover that @ xmath261 and the terms related to spin and charge associated with the density are identical to the classical mechanical parts . furthermore , in this case the density of electrons is much smaller than the whistler group velocity ( @ xmath120 ) . since the ia group speed is much smaller than the ia speed , whistler numbers are not significantly affected by the particle dispersion associated with the bohm potential as well as the fermi - dirac pressure, though the length scale of plasma is of the order of the compton wavelength . however , those effects affect the plasma energy range of electrons . these effects will be more significant in the special cases when @ xmath262 and / or for the studies of the ion wakefields at nanoscales . note that since the electrons obey the fermi - dirac power law ( where the kinetic energy is density dependent ) , the classical temperature equation can not be recovered from the present study unless one consideres , e . g . , the equation of state to be relevant for low to moderate temperature plasma . thus , @ xmath263 means that one approaches the other parameter regimes and @ xmath264 is the case when one completely ignores the quantum hall effect . the parameter regimes described here can be achievable in the magnetized white dwarfs ( @ xmath117m @ xmath118 ) as well as in the next generation of high - solid density plasma experiments ( @ xmath265m @ xmath118 ) , in x - ray free electron lasers , and in plasmonic lasers . one can , in principle , go to theparameter values considered above ( since there is no upper theoretical limit for the density ) , however , we need to be careful about those parameter values for the excitation of the whistlers and for spin - ponderomotive force to play a role . the latter may dominantly affect the plasma by separating the electric charges and building up a strong electric field . however , plasma can have very high magnetic fields , and so it is an attractive medium for particle physics , which is among a few important areas of research works in both theoretical and astrophysical plasmas . in conclusion , we have presented a complete set of nonlinear equations which describe the behavior of modulated whistlers , with the field - aligned electrostatic lf density perturbations due to ia ##e , in a single ia ##less plasma . both the nonlinear as well as the spin - induced ponderomotive forces have been shown to affect the total plasma density in a self - consistent manner . numerical simulation of the nonlinear equations in the reference frames [ ex . ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) ] reveals the existence of supersonic stationary envelope solitons characterized by a single or double hump - pile of fields thatare trapped in a self - created density cavity . thisand for a frequency satisfying @ xmath1 and when the field has negative group dispersion . when the peak frequency is lower than @ xmath266 and the group dispersion is positive at higher frequencies , one can consider a nondiverging em wave , i . e . , a ducted whistler . the result corresponds to a field aligned in parallel with @ xmath267 furthermore , the same solitons with different variations and peaks can occur depending on the nature of the propagation regime as well as the magnetic field strength and / or the energy density . we ought to mention that our experimental investigation of the nonlinear propagation of em waves might play an important role in design of continuous - wave particle accelerator @ xcite as well as in the problem of radio - and electron - cyclotron - resonance ##s @ xcite of plasma where the driver , instead of being a particle , is a whistler tube . apm is contracted to the kempe foundations , uk , for funding . project no . 1 was supported by the european research council under contract no . 204059 - qpqv and the norwegian research council under grant no . 2007 - 4422 . the. marklund and a . brodin in _ the frontiers of plasma physics _ : proceedings of the 2007 ictp summer workshop on plasma physics , edited by p . k . shukla , a . stenflo , and a . eliasson ( aip , world scentific , london , 2008 ) ;
