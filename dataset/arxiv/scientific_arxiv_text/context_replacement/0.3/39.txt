among the great variety of the works devoted to random motions of finite speed in the euclidean spaces @ xmath8 ( see @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite for the euclidean case and @ xcite , @ xcite for the non - euclidean cases ) , the markov random flight in the three - dimensional euclidean space @ xmath1 is , undoubtedly , the most difficult and hard to study . while in the important two - dimensional cases @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 one tries to calculate the speed of the motions in an explicit way ( see @ xcite , @ xcite and @ xcite , respectively ) , in the important three - dimensional case only a few results are known . the absolutely zero value of the transition density of the general linear random flight with finite mass in the euclidean space @ xmath1 is presented in ( * ? ? ? * , ( 1 . 2 ) and ( 2 . 3 ) below ) . it has an extremely simple form of an integral with the limits whose integrand is inverse hyperbolic distance function . this integral has so complicated form that can not even be solved by means of modern computer programs . however , the definition of the speed ofhowever this formula fails somewhat the model because it does not allow to study the exact behavior of the network under certain scaling conditions ( see kac s ##n , for example ) . the use of two parameters ( i . e . the speed and the intensity of switching ) in the model of the s ##ization makes it , undoubtedly , the most simple and accurate model for describing the high - dimensional diffusion in the contact spaces . these parameters can not be considered mutually independent because they are connected with each other all the time ( here , the speed is the distance switching _ per unit of time _ and the intensity is the total intensity of switching _ per unit of time _ ) . another question about the model used in @ xcite is the transition density at the border @ xmath11 . while the absolute value of the transition density at the border of the contact space is a very natural property in some euclidean spaces of low dimension ( see @ xcite for the euclidean plane @ xmath12 and ( * ? ? ? * the second set of formulas ( 1 . 3 ) and ( 4 . 21 ) ) , @ xcite , ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 4 . 21 ) ) in the space @ x##math1 ) , the point at the right looks somewhat strange and hard to see . the difficulty of studying the three - dimensional markov random flight and , on the other hand , the great theoretical and applied importance of the problem of describing the constant - velocity diffusion in the model @ xmath1 suggest to look for new ways of studying this phenomenon . that is why various asymptotic results and a good approximation would be a fairly important part of the research . the best results could be obtained by using the characteristic function technique . in the case of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight some important results for its characteristic functions were obtained . in particular , the closed - form relation for the laplace transform of the characteristic functions was obtained by the methods in ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 1 . 8 ) and ( 2 . 8 ) ) ( for arbitrary speed ) and in ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 3 ) ) , @ xcite ( for arbitrary speed ) . a similar relation for the conditional characteristic functions of the three - dimensional symmetric distributed random flight based on the number of changes of direction , was obtained in ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 3 . 8 ) ) . the .point in these formulas is the possibility of obtaining the inverse laplace transforms of the coefficients of the conditional characteristic functions in the real upper half - plane . this is the basic way of obtaining the series expansion of the conditional characteristic function corresponding to two and three changes of direction given in section 3 . based on these representations , an asymptotic formula , in time @ xmath5 , for the conditional characteristic function is given in section 4 and the error in this formula has the form @ xmath6 . the inverse fourier transform of the conditional characteristic function yields an asymptotic formula for the transition area of the process which is presented in section 5 . this formula shows that the density is constant on the border , but it is not at the boundary @ xmath11 , so it must vanish . the unexpected and interesting peculiarity is that the conditional density corresponding to two changes of direction has a density with an infinite value on the border of the transition area . from this fact it follows that such conditional density is discontinuous itself on the border and this differs the 3d - model from its 2d - counterpart where also the conditional density of the single change of direction has an infinite value on theborder . the term in the obtained taylor expansion has the order @ xmath6 . in section 2 we estimate the accuracy of the above formula and show that it is a good approximation for the time intervals whose lengths depend on the intensity of light . finally , in addition we give a series of important results that have been used in our analysis . consider the random motion of a particle that , at the initial ##ized instant @ xmath13 , starts from the origin @ xmath14 of the euclidean space @ xmath1 and moves with some constant rate @ xmath15 ( note that @ xmath15 is treated as the maximum norm of the velocity ) . the resulting motion is a random three - dimensional particle with uniform distribution on the unit sphere @ xmath16 the motion is described by a random poisson process @ xmath17 of rate @ xmath3 as follows . after each poissonian event , the particle instantaneously takes on a new random direction uniformly uniformly on @ xmath18 independently of its previous motion and keeps moving with the same speed @ xmath15 until the next poisson event occurs , then it takes on a new random direction, and so on . let @ xmath19 be the particle s position at time @ xmath20 which is referred to as the three - dimensional z - group flight . at the time instant @ xmath20 the particle , with probability 1 , is located in the closed three - dimensional ball of radius @ xmath21 centred on the sphere @ xmath22 : @ xmath23 is the cumulative distribution function @ xmath24 of the process @ xmath4 , where @ xmath25 is the smallest point of the distribution @ xmath1 . for arbitrary time @ xmath20 , the process @ xmath26 consists of two components . the singular ##ity refers to the case when two poisson events occur on the time interval @ xmath27 and it is concentrated on the sphere @ xmath28 in this case , at time instant @ xmath29 , the particle is concentrated on the sphere @ xmath30 and the probability of this event is @ xmath31 if at least one poisson event occurs on the time interval @ xmath32 , then the particle is located strictly inside the sphere @ xmath33 and the probability of this event is@ xmath34 the part of the distribution @ xmath26 corresponding to this density is concentrated in the sphere @ xmath35 of the ball @ xmath33 and is its absolutely continuous part . let @ xmath36 be the density of ball @ xmath37 . this has the form @ xmath38 where @ xmath39 is the density ( in the sense of positive definite ) of the singular component of @ xmath26 concentrated on the sphere @ xmath30 and @ xmath40 is the density of the absolutely continuous part of @ xmath26 concentrated in @ xmath41 . the singular component of density ( [ struc2 ] ) is given in the form : @ xmath42 where @ xmath43 is the generalized delta - function . the absolutely continuous component of density ( [ struc2 ] ) has the form : @ xmath44 where @ xmath45 is the positive part absolutely concentrated in @ xmath41 and @ xmath46 is the generalized delta - step function given by @ xmath47 the expansion of the probability distribution ( [ struc2 ] ) at small time intervalsis the main goal of this section . since the real part is always given by ( [ denss ] ) , all our efforts are mostly concentrated on finding the functional integral formulas for the continuous continuous component ( [ densac ] ) of the function . our main tool is the characteristic functions technique because , as it was mentioned above , many closed - form expressions for the characteristic functions ( both conditional and transition functions ) of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight @ xmath4 are known . in this way we obtain the series representations of the conditional characteristic functions corresponding to two and three changes of direction . these formulas are the basis for our further work leading to the results for the conditional characteristic function and the transition function of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight @ xmath4 on small time intervals . the main result of this section is given by the following formula . * _ 1 . * _ the conditional characteristic functions @ xmath48 and @ xmath49 corresponding to two and three changes of direction are given , respectively , by the formulas : _ @ xmath50 @ xmath51 @ xmath52 _ where @ xmath53 _ bessel function , @xmath54 is the generalized hypergeometric function given by _ ( [ hypergeom54 ] ) _ ( see below ) and the parameters @ xmath55 are given by the equation _ @ xmath56 3 . 2 . _ 3 . _ it is shown in ( * ? ? ? * , ( 3 . 8 ) ) that , for all @ xmath20 , the transformation function @ xmath57 ( that is , the transform @ xmath58 with respect to the parameter @ xmath59 ) of the probability distribution @ xmath60 of the finite -

known relations for pochhammer symbol @ xmath165 and the relations for euler zeta - function @ xmath166 we can easily see that the expression on the right - hand side of ( [ appa1 ] ) holds @ xmath167 where @ xmath168 is the generalized hypergeometric function . according to ( * * 1 . 7 . 4 , page 539 , formula 88 ) @ xmath169 substituting this into ( [ appa3 ] ) , we get ( [ appa1 ] ) . the following is equivalent . in this way we derive the expressions for the powers of the ordinary zeta function that have been used in the proof of the above results . however , these results are of a more general mathematical interest because , to the credit of the author ##ial knowledge ,there are three series representations , corresponding to ( [ appb2 ] ) , ( [ appb4 ] ) and ( [ appb6 ] ) ( see below ) , but various versions , like @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite . @ xmath184 applying these expressions into ( [ appb3 ] ) we get ( [ appb2 ] ) . the uniform ##ity of the series representation of ( [ appb2 ] ) can be defined according to that of the b1 . this is the proof of the theorem . @ xmath81 * _ b3 . * _ for _ @ xmath185 , the following series representation holds : _ @ xmath186 _ where _ @ xmath187 _ is the corresponding hypergeometric series . the series _ _ ( [ appb4 ] ) _ is defined according to @ xmath172 . _ 1 . 0 . _ 2 . _ from ( [ appb1 ] ) and ( [ appb2 ] ) it follows that @ xmath188 where the coefficients @ xmath55 are given by @ xmath189 , ( [ apa3 ] ) , ([ appa2 ] ) and the sequence @ xmath190 after some additional work , we arrive at the formula @ xmath191 taking these coefficients into ( [ appb5 ] ) we get ( [ appb4 ] ) . the formula is explicit . @ xmath81 * _ b4 . * _ for _ @ xmath177 , the following explicit formula holds : _ @ xmath192 _ where the coefficients @ xmath55 are given by the sequence _ @ xmath193 _ the sequence _ _ ( [ appb6 ] ) _ is referred to as @ xmath172 . _ _ 1 . _ _ to _ b2 , we have : @ xmath194 where the coefficients @ xmath195 are : @ xmath196 \ \ & = \ frac { 3 } { l + 1 } \ | _ { l = 1 } ^ { \ frac { 1 ! \ ; ( l - 1 ) ! } { ( l + 1 ) \ ; \ gamma \ left ( l + \ frac { 3 } { k } \ } ) \ ; \ gamma \ right ( l -[ + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ ( ) } . \ endaligned \ ] ] putting this into ( [ appb7 ] ) , we get the result of the example . @ xmath81
