the statistical mechanics of pure systems most prominently the topic of phase transitions and their associated related phenomena has been a subject of fairly extensive research in recent years . several basic principles for pure systems ( the gibbs phase equation , wulff construction , etc . ) have been established on a mathematically rigorous footing and , if necessary , supplemented with appropriate conditions for their validity . the related phenomena in systems with several equilibrium states , like liquids , have also been well - established on the basis of theoretical physics . however , they have not received much mathematically rigorous attention and in particular have not been derived rigorously enough from a single experiment . a natural task is to use the results from statistical mechanics of pure systems to develop a high level of understanding for phase transitions in solutions . this is particularly desirable in light of the important role that basic physics of these systems plays in sciences , both pure ( chemistry , physics , oceanography ) and applied ( engineering , etc . ) . see e . g . @ xcite for more information . among the perhaps most interesting aspects of phase transitions in pure systems is a dramatic _ phase separation _ of phases upon heating ( or boiling ) . a well - known example from ` ` marine life ' ' is the formation of brine bubbles in frozen sea water .however , two important physical phenomena are observed : 1 . migration of nearly all the salt into whatever portion of salt / water mixture remains liquid . no evidence of _ facetting _ at the water - ice interface . the analysis also reveals the following phenomenon : 1 . salted water freezes at temperatures lower than the freezing point of pure water . this is the phenomenon of _ freezing point depression _ . phenomenon ( 1 ) is what ` ` defines ' ' the structure of sea ice and is therefore largely responsible for the variety of other effects that have been observed , see e . g . @ xcite . however , ( 2 ) are not special to the salt - water mixture ; they are caused by a large number of the so called _ non - polar _ solutions . a discussion of the physical properties of migration / migration of solutions often referred to as _ colligative _ properties can be found in @ xcite . of course , on a heuristic level , the above phenomena are far from mysterious . indeed , ( 1 ) follows from the fact that , generally , the liquid phase provides a more hospitable environment for water than the solid phase . phenomenon ( 2 ) follows from noting that the addition of salt increases the entropic rate of freezing of theenergy - momentum coupling forces the freezing point to a higher temperature . finally , in observation ( 2 ) we note that , due to the crystalline nature of ice , the ice - water surface tension must be negative . therefore , to describe the shape of brine water , a wulff model has to be used with the caveat that only the crystalline structure is on the outside . in summary , what is underlying these models is a phase separation accompanied by the emergence of a crystal structure . in the case of pure water , such topics have been well studied at the level of theoretical physics for quite some time @ xcite and , recently ( as seen on the planck time scale ) , also at the level of statistical theorems in lower @ xcite and higher @ xcite dimensions . the aim of this and a subsequent paper is to study the experimental results of observation ( 1 ) in the field of equilibrium statistical mechanics . however , the most realistic model of salted water / ice system is far beyond that of rigorous physics . ( in fact , even in pure water , the phenomenon of freezing is so rare that crystalization in these models has only rarely and only marginally been observed in numerical simulations @ xcite . ) so we must resort to aa version in which both and both types of water are represented by discrete random particles located at vertices of a crystal lattice . for these models we assume that phase separation dominates the non - trivial _ region _ of chemical potential in the phase , a situation quite unlike the classical system where phase separation can occur only at a single value ( say , the equilibrium value ) of the chemical potential . the spectral lines of the phase - separation region can be easily calculated and shown to agree with the exact solutions of the corresponding equations in the physical - chemical domain . the above is the subject of the following paper . in a subsequent paper @ xcite we will note that , for infinitesimal water concentrations adjusted appropriately with the temperature of the system , phase separation can still occur dramatically in the case that a non - trivial fraction of the system suddenly expands ( bubbles ) to form a pocket ( depression ) . in these circumstances the amount of water needed is proportional to the _ boundary _ of the pocket which implies that the onset of freezing - point change is not a physical phenomenon . on a practical level , both of the aforementioned conclusions should apply to all non - volatile systems under the conditions when the solvent freezes ( or boils ) . notwithstanding , throughout this and the subsequent paper wewill use the _ presence _ of salted water and refer to the solid phase of the liquid as ice , to the liquid phase as ice - water , and to the solute as salt . our model will be defined as the @ xmath0 - dimensional hypercubic system @ xmath1 . we will take the ( formal ) nearest - neighbor hamiltonian of the following states : @ xmath2 where @ xmath3 denotes the inverse operator ( not incorporated into the hamitonian ) , @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 denotes both , @ xmath1 and @ xmath6 denotes a neighboring pair of sites . the quantities @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 are the solid ( liquid ) , liquid ( salt ) and solid variables , which will have values in @ xmath10 with the additional variable @ xmath11 is for the site @ xmath4 . we will assume that @ xmath12 is the _ presence of ice _ at @ xmath4 and , similarly , @ xmath8 the _ presence of salt _ at @ xmath4 . since a single water molecule can not possibly exist in anice state , it is natural to use the phrase @ xmath12 as referring to the physical state of the particles in the vicinity of @ xmath4 which is enacting an ice - salt state , though we do not explicitly introduce such a viewpoint into our model . the other terms involved are all self - contradictory : an interaction between adjacent ice points , similarly for neighboring liquid points ( we also assume these to be attractive ) , an additional term @ xmath13 for a simultaneous presence of salt and ice at each point , and , finally , a compensation for ice and water . for simplicity ( and tractability ) , there is no direct salt - ice interaction , except for the exclusion rule of at least one term ` ` ice ' ' at each point . additional terms which could have been included are missing due to the confusion . we must assume throughout that @ xmath14 , so that the salt - ice interaction expresses the negative affinity of salt to the ice state of water . this term is indirectly and not solely responsible for the observed phenomenon of freezing point elevation . we assume that by suitably considering the interaction , the hamiltonian in would just as well describe a system with boiling point elevation . if we say , theand @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 indicate the presence of ice and liquid water at site @ xmath4 , respectively . the assumption @ xmath15 is that _ something _ has to be present at @ xmath4 ( the presence of ice in water is unknown ) ; what is perhaps unrealistic is the restriction of @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 to only the extreme values , namely @ xmath16 . be it to say that the authors are confident ( e . g . , on the basis of @ xcite ) that virtually all the results of this note can be extended to the case of continuous variables . however , we will not make any specific theoretical claims ; much of this work will rely heavily on preexisting technology which , generally speaking , has not yet developed to account for the general case . a similar discussion applies , of course , to the continuous case . however , our restriction to @ xmath17 is intended to ease the discussion ; and many of our results directly extend to the case when @ xmath9 has all ( all ) real values subject to some _ a priori _ assumptions . it is not difficult to show that the ` ` ice - waterthe ' ' of the above hamiltonian reduces to a single ising spin ##or . on a practical level , this is achieved by referring to the ising variables @ xmath18 , which in light of the constraint gives @ xmath19 by combining these into , we arrive at the following hamiltonian : @ xmath20 where the new parameters @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 are given by @ xmath23 we remark that the last term above is usually expressed in terms of ` ` ' ' ' , so that @ xmath24 will have a well defined value even if @ xmath25 , which refers to the salt entirely in ice - free sites . ( notwithstanding , the bulk of this expression is restricted to finite @ xmath13 . ) with an additional restriction to finite values , the extended hamitonian allows us to define the corresponding gibbs equation . we refer the further discussion to section [ sec2 . 1 ] . the hamiltonian thus defined foretells the existence of changes in the salt concentration . however , this is _ not _ the case which is of particular interest . indeed , in an ideal system it is possible that the salt concentration will , indeed , adjust itselfuntil the system reaches a stable phase . on the basis of the description provided , it is shown that , using grand canonical variables , the individual particles can be completely integrated , the result of the ising model being a constant @ xmath21 and a field @ xmath26 , where @ xmath27 in this case , the coexistence is restricted to the region @ xmath28 , i . e . , a simple region in the @ xmath29 - plane . unfortunately , as is well known @ xcite , not much insight on the phenomenon of _ _ separation _ is to be gained by placing the ising model in an external context . indeed , if ( for example ) minus boundary conditions , once @ xmath22 reaches its minimum value , a liquid will form which all but doubles the unit volume . the transitional value of @ xmath22 varies inversely with the linear structure of the system ; the exact constants and the exact size of the droplet depend on the choice of the boundary conditions . the described ` ` s ' ' of the grand canonical description shows that the equilibrium ensemble in this case is the one with a minimum amount of salt per unit volume . ( the above definition uses conditioning fromthe absolute total measure ; see section [ sec2 . 1 ] . ) this problem is physically more complicated because , at the point of freezing , the salt solution does not have the ` ` mobility ' ' to be gradually removed from the system . it is noted that , when the total amount of salt is removed , the chemical potential @ xmath30 drops because of the fact the relevant parameter is now the salt concentration . as will be seen in section [ sec2 ] , in our ising - based model of the solvent - solute system , removing the salt concentration only leads to _ the _ phase separation in the ising system . moreover , this happens for an _ amount _ of time of the magnetic field @ xmath22 . thus , the difference between the salt concentration and the _ external field will be a particular property of the magnetization , even under conditions which would force a liquid ( or a crystal , depending on the initial condition ) into the system . [ rem0 ] we begin by noting that , although the parameter @ xmath22 is completely unrelated to temperature , it does to a certain extent play the role of temperature in that it reflects the _ a priori _ degree of preference of the system for temperature _ of _ice . so the natural phase diagram to study is in the @ xmath31 - plane . the result which led to formula ##tes for the immediate heuristic solution of our current problem . the first simplification which essentially comes down to the theory of spin - salt interactions is that for each ising configuration , the total mass of salt , i . e . , the total energy distributed over salt configurations , depends only on the overall magnetization and not on the nature of how the salt is distributed in the system . in terms of the scale @ xmath32 , let @ xmath33 be the total partition function for the ising configuration with constrained overall magnetization @ xmath34 . the total partition function @ xmath35 with constrained salt concentration @ xmath36 can then be written as @ xmath37 where @ xmath38 denotes the value of the salt part of the total energy which only depends on the ising configuration via the total mass @ xmath34over the salt configurations with concentration @ xmath36 . as usual , the physical components of the equation are those bringing the aggregate contribution to the equation ##mation . let us replace the above arguments by , usingthe case @ xmath39 ( which is @ xmath40 ) , i . e . , the original ising model with magnetic field @ xmath22 . here we recall that @ xmath41 can also be written { @ xmath42 } , \ ] ] where @ xmath43 is a randomly chosen variable and @ xmath44 is the ( normalized ) canonical free variable . the principal fact about @ xmath44 is that it vanishes for @ xmath45 in the interval @ xmath46 $ ] , where @ xmath47 is the taylor expansion of the ising model in time @ xmath21 , and it is strictly positive and strictly convex for @ xmath45 with @ xmath48 . the presence of the ` ` flat line ' ' in the spectrum of @ xmath44 provides further evidence for the existence of the phase transition in the ising model : for @ xmath49 the dominant contribution to the overall continuum partition ##ing is from @ xmath50 . for @ xmath51 the dominant contributions of the overall continuum are @ xmath52 . however , for @ xmath53which , for@ xmath54 with @ xmath55 whenever @ xmath56a phase separation occurs at @ xmath57 . the change of salt variables also changes the phase picture . indeed , as we can see in figure [ thm1 ] , the salt partition of @ xmath38 will exhibit a nontrivial exponential behavior which is characterized by a _ _ zero _ free energy . the resulting _ growth rate of @ xmath58 for @ xmath59 is thus no longer a function with a closed domain and , for each @ xmath22 there is a _ optimal _ value of @ xmath45 that optimizes the corresponding free energy . thus ( again , due to the absence of salt - salt interactions ) now that @ xmath45 has been replaced , the two states are the same ising model with overall value @ xmath60 . in particular , whenever @ xmath35 is replaced by values of @ xmath60 for each @ xmath61 , a _ _ droplet _ develops in the system . thus , due to the one - to - one interaction between @ xmath22 and the overall value of @ xmath45 , phase separation occurs forthe _ average _ of concentration of @ xmath22 at a given temperature ; see fig . [ fig1 ] . we begin with an overview of the content of this paper and some parts of the previous paper @ xcite . in section [ sec2 ] we define as the measure of concentration and present our main results concerning the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding measure on spin and salt configurations with constant concentration of salt . along with the results comes a discussion of the phase diagram and a discussion of freezing - point conditions , phase separation , etc . , see section [ sec2 . 2 ] . our main results are summarized in section [ sec3 ] . in @ xcite we investigate the problem of measuring salt concentration . first , we note that , in order to measure phase separation , the lattice needs to scale at least to the maximum linear size of the system . with the ( formal ) hamiltonian in mind , we will now start by developing the _ optimal _ layout of the system . to define the layout , we will need to restrict ourselves to certain subsets of the lattice . we will first focus on rectangular regions @ xmath62 of @ xmath63 , centered at the origin . our convention for theone , @ xmath64 , of the set @ xmath65 will be the set of sites outside @ xmath66 with a site inside @ xmath66 . for all @ xmath67 , we have the water and salt variables , @ xmath68 and @ xmath17 . on the boundary , we will have the configurations @ xmath69 ; most of the time we will be using the parameters @ xmath70 and @ xmath71 , referred to as plus and minus boundary conditions . since there is no salt - salt interaction , we may as well use @ xmath72 for all @ xmath73 . we will start by using the interaction hamiltonian . let @ xmath65 be a basis set . for a fixed configuration @ xmath69 and the set @ xmath74 of water and salt variables , we let @ xmath75 here , as before , @ xmath6 is the nearest - neighbor value of @ xmath1 and the parameters @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 and @ xmath13 are as described above . ( in terms of the results from the [ sec1. 3 ] the last term in has been removed . ) the probability distribution of the pair @ xmath74 takes the following gibbs - gibbs form : @ xmath76 where the rate function , @ xmath77 , is the partition function . the mixture in @ xmath78 with the plus and minus boundary conditions will be denoted by @ xmath79 and @ xmath80 , respectively . for those mentioned before we will be interested in the problems with a fixed salt [ @ xmath81 $ ] . in finite volume , we take this to mean that the total concentration of salt , @ xmath82 is fixed . to simplify future discussions , we will use the convention that ` ` ` @ xmath36 ' ' means that @ xmath83 , i . e . , @ xmath84 . we will then define the finite volume mixture probability distribution with salt in @ xmath36 and plus ( or minus ) boundary conditions denoted by @ xmath85 ( or @ xmath86 ) . in terms of , these are given by the formulas @ xmath87 both measures @ xmath88 based on the parameters@ xmath21 and @ xmath13 represent the hamiltonian . however , we will always keep these terms fixed and drop them from the formula whenever possible . in order to obtain our first set of results , we will need to bring to light a few standard facts about the ising model . for each spin configuration @ xmath89 let us define the overall magnetization of @ xmath78 using the formula @ xmath90 and @ xmath91 denote the value of the ising model with coupling constant @ xmath21 and magnetic moment @ xmath92 . as is well known , from the statement of theorem [ thm3 . 2 ] , @ xmath93 continuously ( and strictly ) increases from the value of the overall magnetization @ xmath94 to 1 as @ xmath22 decreases out @ xmath95 . in particular , for each @ xmath96 , there is a unique @ xmath97 such that @ xmath98 . then we will use the above formula to define the term @ xmath99 , which is the canonical free form of the ising model in . as it turns out , the[ thm3 . 1 ] in case [ sec3 ] we also define @ xmath100 as previously stated , if @ xmath101 , where @ xmath102 is the mean rate constant of the ising model , then @ xmath103 and [ @ xmath104 for @ xmath105 $ ] . ( since @ xmath106 stands for @ xmath56 , the term ` ` ' ' ' ' in the graph of @ xmath107 appears only in case @ xmath56 . ) from the perspective of the large - deviation model , for @ xcite , @ xmath107 is the large - deviation rate constant for the graph of the ( full ) ising model ; see also case [ thm3 . 1 ] . let @ xmath108 be the correlation coefficient of the bernoulli distribution with parameter @ xmath109 . ( we can define @ xmath110 whenever @ xmath111 $ ] . ) for [ @ xmath112 , [ @ xmath81 $ ] and [ @ xmath113 $ ] , then @ xmat##h114 as we will see in table [ sec3 ] , this value is the number of measurements with fixed salt concentration @ xmath36 , fixed spin concentration @ xmath45 and fixed fraction @ xmath115 of the salt concentration ` ` on the plus spins ' ' ( and not @ xmath116 ` ` on the minus spins ' ' ) . having obtained the following properties , we are ready to publish our results . we start with a large - scale calculation for the entropy of the measures @ xmath88 : [ thm1 ] let @ xmath117 and @ xmath14 be fixed . for each @ xmath118 , each @ xmath119 and each @ xmath112 , we have @ xmath120 . @ xmath121 is given by @ xmath122 } { \ mathscr { \ } } _ { m , \ } ( \ , \ } ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath123 the function @ xmath121 is convex and is continuous in @ xmath124 with @ xmath125 . therefore , the entropy minimizer @ xmat##h126 of @ xmath121 is constant in volume @ xmath36 and @ xmath22 and is equal to @ xmath22 . on the basis of the above standard - model result , we can now compute the typical values of the measures @ xmath88 . consider the ising model with a constant @ xmath21 and an external parameter and let @ xmath127 be the first gibbs measure in the @ xmath78 and @ xmath128 - boundary condition . our general ##ization in this case is given as follows : [ thm2 ] = @ xmath117 and @ xmath14 ##8 . . take @ xmath118 and @ xmath119 , and compute two sets of gibbs measures @ xmath129 and @ xmath130 $ ] with the formula @ xmath131 \ bigr ) = p _ l ^ { \ pm , n , m } ( p _ l \ , ml ^ 2 ) , \ qquad [ \ in [ - 1 , 1 ] . \ ] ] the measures @ xmath129 allow us to compute the first value of the distribution @ .##math88 as a convex hull of the ising measures with fixed mass ; i . e . , for each set @ xmath132 of configurations @ xmath133 , we have @ xmath134 similarly , if @ xmath126 is the global minimizer of the measure @ xmath121 from , then the following properties are known : 1 . for the spin configuration on a finite set @ xmath65 , the spin variables at @ xmath66 are not independent . explicitly , for each finite set @ xmath65 and the spin configurations @ xmath135 and @ xmath136 , @ xmath137 where the numbers @ xmath138 $ ] are uniquely determined by the equations @ xmath139 $ . the measure @ xmath129 converges uniformly to a fixed mass at @ xmath126 , @ xmath140 in particular , the ising - invariant part of the measure @ xmath88 is not bounded by the corresponding ising measure associated with the overall magnetization @ xmath141 , where @ xmath45 minimizes @xmath121 . the fact that concentration @ xmath88 for a fixed amount of salt produces the ising sector the same conditioning which is the amount of salt concentration related to the degree of salt - salt interaction . the principal conclusions of the above theorem are in sections ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , which states that the use of a particular combination of external _ forces _ the ising sector to produce a particular value of magnetization energy . the underlying variational theory provides insight into the physical effects of phase change upon formation of crystals . ( we refer the reader back to section [ sec1 . 1 ] for the physical implications of these results . ) we will begin by discussing the implications of these results for the phase behavior of the model and , in particular , the effects of freezing point depression . theorem [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] are stated in section [ sec3 . 1 ] . [ fig1 ] . the horizontal line represents the concentration of the salt in the system , the vertical line represents the external forces acting on the ising spins . 2 . for constant concentrations @ xmath142 , the system stays in the liquid - solid phase with a non - zero value of the concentration of @ xmath##22a manifestation of the freezing - point depression . for @ xmath143 in the shaded region , a non - trivial fraction of the system is frozen into ice . once @ xmath143 is on the left of the shaded region , the entire system is in the ice state . for moderate values of @ xmath13 , the type of convexity of the transition lines may change from convex to convex . @ xmath144 ; see the original paper @ xcite . , [ = 336 ] . the horizontal line represents the concentration of the system in the system , the vertical line represents the magnetic field acting on the ising . see figure . for positive values @ xmath142 , the system stays in the liquid - solid phase . the non - trivial fraction of moderate values of @ xmath22a manifestation of the freezing - point depression . for @ xmath143 in the shaded region , a non - trivial fraction of the system is frozen into ice . once @ xmath143 is on the right of the shaded region , the entire system is in the ice state . for moderate values of @ xmath13 , the type of convexity of the transition lines may change from convex to convex[ @ xmath144 ; see the mode distribution @ xcite . , width = 336 ] the representation along with the formula allows us to express the distribution @ xmath88 in terms of the mode distribution of the ising ferromagnet . together , these results show that the distribution of ising states induced by @ xmath88 is very much like that in the distribution @ xmath127 based on the fact that the initial state @ xmath145 is near the distribution @ xmath146 . as a result , the asymptotic properties ( e . g . , the wulff construction ) that have been ( or will be ) established for the spin configurations in the ising model with zero magnetization will also hold for the non - marginal of the @ xmath88 as well . a particular topic of discussion in this paper is phase transitions . recall that @ xmath47 denotes the overall state of the ising system in measure @ xmath21 . thus we can anticipate the following statement for spin configurations in measure @ xmath88 : 1 . if @ xmath147 , then the overall state ( with( boundary conditions ) will look like the minus state of the ising configuration whose external field is adjusted so that the overall phase on the system @ xmath148 is roughly @ xmath146 . 2 . if @ xmath149 , then the system ( with minus boundary conditions ) will look like the ising minus state with similarly adjusted external field . if @ xmath150 , then , again , the system has phase transitions in the sense that both states have a large droplet of one phase near the other . the volume fraction occupied by the droplet is such that the overall phase is roughly @ xmath151 . the outer phase of the system agrees with the boundary condition . the conclusions ( 1 - 2 ) with minus boundary conditions that is , the minus boundary conditions in ( 1 ) and the plus boundary conditions in ( 2 ) are defined as follows ; the difference is that now there has to be a large point near the boundary flipping to the ` ` correct ' ' boundary condition . [ rem1 ] we have no doubt that the aforementioned conclusions ( 1 - 2 ) hold for all @ xmath56 and all @ xmath101 ( with the correct choice of the _ droplet_ ( part ( 1 ) , of course ) . however , the accuracy of part ( 1 ) depends on the level of the wulff construction , which is at times rather different in dimensions @ xmath152 and @ xmath153 . thus , while in @ xmath152 the results of @ xcite allow us to conclude that for dimensions @ xmath101 and for dimensions @ xmath61 , the system will exhibit a certain phase diagram with appropriate properties , in @ xmath153 this statement is known to be @ xcite only for ` ` @ xmath154 - 1 ' ' and only for @ xmath61 which are not the endpoints . ( moreover , not all values of @ xmath101 are , in general , permitted ; see @ xcite for a detailed discussion of these restrictions . ) we return to @ xcite for an overview of the results . despite the technical difficulties of wulff construction , the result allows us to characterize the phase diagram of the system at hand . as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] , the @ xmath155 and @ xmath156 diagram fall into two distinct parts : the_ phase - ice _ region , the _ phase _ region and the _ phase transition _ region , which correspond to the points of ( 1 - 3 ) , respectively . the boundary lines of the phase - separation region are obtained by setting @ xmath157 which in terms of strict monotonicity of @ xmath158 allows us to define @ xmath22 as the solution of @ xmath36 . the value of can be found on the basis of the following observation : [ prop2b ] , @ xmath105 $ ] and @ xmath81 $ ] and denote the quantities @ xmath159 $ . let @ xmath22 be the solution to @ xmath160 . then we have : @ xmath161 in addition , there are two increasing and decreasing [ @ xmath162 $ ] with @ xmath163 for all @ xmath142 , such that @ xmath164 is equal to @ xmath165 for all @ xmath142 . proposition [ prop2b ] is given at the very end of proposition [ sec3 . 2 ] . here is an equivalent statement of this result : the quantities @xmath166 are the _ mole ##s _ of particles in non - water and air , respectively . in mathematical terms , @ xmath167 is the probability of finding a charged particle with a given positive spin , and @ xmath168 is the same quantity for minus spins , respectively . this is the change of the chemical potential of the solution ( which is given by @ xmath169 in this case ) due to the motion of the solute . this is a manifestation of _ freezing point depression _ , see also : [ rem0 ] . in the asymptotic when @ xmath170 we have @ xmath171 this relation , found in many chemistry and physics books on the auspicies of the ` ` usual formula , ' ' is an essential tool in the " analysis of colligative properties of solutions @ xcite . " the relation is a direct consequence of a simple ( albeit simplistic ) model which also offers the possibility of systematically calculating higher - order corrections . the proofs of our gibbs theorem are , more or less , straightforward exercises in large - scale analysis of gibbs equations . we first consider and prove a couple of basic lemmas ; the actual solution##s . see section [ sec3 . 1 ] . the starting point of the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] ( and , therefore , theorem [ thm2 ] ) is the following p - o formula for the ising model with zero external field : [ thm3 . 1 ] for the ising model with a constant @ xmath172 and zero external field . let @ xmath127 be the only ( non - ) gibbs constant in the @ xmath78 and @ xmath128 - like conditions . then for [ @ xmath173 $ ] , @ xmath174 where @ xmath145 is defined in and @ xmath175 is as defined in . if the formula is considered here , see e . g . ( * ? ? ? * , ii . 1 ) , and follows from a straightforward calculation of the linear relations between the internal energy , magnetization and external field . for convenience ( and non - trivial ) we will use a formula . consider the equation @ xmath176 , where @ xmath177 is the derivative with respect to @ xmath127 , and let @ xmath178. the limit is by subadditivity , and is independent of the boundary conditions . the function @ xmath179 is convex on @ xmath180 , real valued ( by the hamilton - hamilton theorem @ xcite ) on @ xmath181 , and hence it is also convex on @ xmath180 . by the @ xmath182 symmetry there is a point at @ xmath57 whenever @ xmath183 . it follows that for every @ xmath184 there is a point @ xmath185 such that @ xmath186 , with @ xmath187 increases continuously from @ xmath188 to @ xmath189 and @ xmath45 increases from @ xmath190 to @ xmath191 . the n - body theorem implies that a similar statement holds for the points in @ xmath192 $ ] . let @ xmath193 denote the legendre transform of @ xmath194 , i . e . , @ xmath195 $ ] . from the symmetry group of @ xmath179 we infer that @ xmath196 when @xmath197 and @ xmath198 , and @ xmath199 for @ xmath105 $ ] . by the grtner - schwarz theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem v . 6 ) and ( * ? ? ? * theorem v . v . 6 ) ) , we can start with @ xmath200 for all @ xmath201 $ ] which is the sum of so many independent points of @ xmath193 . since @ xmath202 and the derivative of @ xmath203 is @ xmath187 , this @ xmath175 is given by the line of . to find when @ xmath105 $ ] , we first assume that the right - hand side of is nonpositive and converge at @ xmath45 . ( this follows by partitioning @ xmath78 into independent points with their own own boundary and taking the line as the boundary . ) since @ xmath44 tends to converge and @ xmath45 tends to @ xmath204 we also have that for @ xmath105 $ ] as well . the ` ` x ' ' symbol ofthe grtner - ellis theorem ( * ? ? ? * theorem v . 1 ) also guarantees the following _ maximum - deviation ##s _ : @ xmath205 for any open set @ xmath206 while @ xmath207 } \ phi ^ \ { ( 1 ) \ ] ] for any closed set @ xmath208 . ( [ @ xmath209 for @ xmath173 $ ] and @ xmath210 $ . ) the above proof starts by referring to @ xmath211 - 1 of the sequence @ xmath45 and [ @ xmath212 . the @ xmath105 $ ] cases i . e , the non - critical points are to be dealt with first . the above is the core of our proof of the [ thm1 ] . the next step will be to bring the quantities @ xmath36 and @ xmath22 into consideration . this , as we shall see , is best done if we condition on the total energy . ( the efficiency of this process will be estimated first . ) indeed , as a result of the nature of acid - base interaction , the energy measure can be rather easily calculated . let us consider theconsider of the quantity @ xmath213 from which comes the total amount of salt in the system . for any spin configuration @ xmath89 and any spin configuration @ xmath214 , let us consider the quantity @ xmath215 representing the total amount of salt ` ` including the plus sign . ' ' then we have : [ lemma3 . 2 ] for any given spin configuration @ xmath216 , all salt configurations @ xmath217 with the same @ xmath213 and @ xmath218 have the same probability in the conditional distribution @ xmath219 . moreover , for any @ xmath220 with @ xmath221 and for any @ xmath173 $ ] , @ xmath222 where the correlation function is given by @ xmath223 here @ xmath177 is the expectation with respect to @ xmath127 . ' the fact that all spin configurations with given @ xmath213 and @ xmath218 have the same probability as @ xmath219 is a consequence of the fact that the time - dependent part of the hamiltonian depends only on @ xmat##h218 . the numbers ( [ 3 . 3 ] [ 3 . 4 ] ) come from a partial rewrite of the above conditional distribution . the characterization of the conditional distribution @ xmath224 from lemma [ lemma3 . 2 ] allows us to directly evaluate the configurational entropy carried by the salt . now , given a spin configuration @ xmath89 and numbers @ xmath225 , and @ xmath226 the total entropy is by the law of exponential decay of the value of @ xmath227 which can be converted to the value @ xmath228 from as follows : [ lemma3 . 2 ] for each @ xmath229 and each @ xmath230 there is a number @ xmath231 such that the following is true for any @ xmath225 , any @ xmath112 that contains @ xmath232 , @ xmath233 and any @ xmath234 : if @ xmath89 has a spin configuration with @ xmath235 , then @ xmath236 . we want to distribute @ xmath237 salt particles to @ xmath##238 positions , so that exactly @ xmath239 of them depends on @ xmath240 plus sites and @ xmath241 on @ xmath242 minus sites . this can be done in latexmath : [ \ [ \ label { 3 . 8a } ] of ] . now these expressions scale down to @ xmath238 which , using stirling series methods , shows that the first term is within , say , @ xmath244 multiple of @ xmath245 and @ xmath234 , with @ xmath246 depending only on @ xmath247 . a similar result is true for the second term with @ xmath115 replaced by @ xmath116 and @ xmath45 by @ xmath248 . using these expressions we find that @ xmath249 is within @ xmath250 multiple of @ xmath251 and @ xmath32 is very large . for the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] , we will first give an estimate of how many salt ##ions and @ xmath227 take their positions in a given range @ xmath252. to that extent , for each @ xmath253 and each @ xmath135 we will have the value @ xmath254 . the moment that ##3 reveals , @ xmath255 can be interpreted as the probability that @ xmath256 occurs in ( possibly ) any homogeneous product measure where @ xmath214 happens to be @ xmath257 and @ xmath258 . it is therefore not surprising that , for spin , @ xmath259 with for spin , @ xmath260 will tend to homogeneous product measure on @ xmath261 . a simple characterization of this property is as follows : [ lemma3 . 2 ] for each @ xmath262 , each @ xmath263 and each @ xmath230 there exists @ xmath231 such that the following [ for each @ xmath234 , all @ xmath252 with @ xmath264 , all @ xmath45 with @ xmath232 and [ @ xmath265 $ ] for which @ xmath266 with @ xmath267 $ ] : if @ xmath##89 is a spin configuration such that @ xmath235 and @ xmath135 are the spin configuration of @ xmath66 , and @ xmath268 proof we can build on the result from [ [ lemma3 . 2 ] . ] , from we have an expression for the quantities and . returning to the proof , introducing the quantities @ xmath269 and the quantity @ xmath270 the same reasoning as we used to , allows us to define the object @ xmath271 and @ xmath272 , where the two parameters are as follows : the quantities @ xmath273 represent the corresponding amounts of plus and minus in the object , respectively , @ xmath274 represents the number of salt ##ings of plus and minus , and , respectively , @ xmath275 represents the corresponding quantities for the object @ xmath66 , respectively . since and the quantities [ @ xmath232 and @ xmath265 $ ] imply that @ xmath276 , @ xmath277 , @ xmath278 , @ xmath279 , @ xmath28##0 and @ xmath281 both add up to @ xmath238 , uniformly for @ xmath259 and @ xmath282 , while @ xmath283 and @ xmath284 are bounded by @ xmath285which , our limit is greater than @ xmath286we ##pt is a situation where it makes sense to use an alternative form of the @ xmath287 . using the quantities @ xmath288 which are equal for the limits @ xmath289 and @ xmath290 with @ xmath291 , we can prove that @ xmath292 since @ xmath293 and @ xmath294 exceed @ xmath295 , and @ xmath283 , @ xmath296 , @ xmath284 and @ xmath297 stay constant , the same claim made by the @ xmath32 as well . the reader will have noticed that , in all of our previous examples , @ xmath115 and @ xmath45 are restricted to areas far from the boundary line . to control the area near the boundaryfirst , we want to prove the following property : [ lemma3 . 0 ] for each @ xmath298 and each @ xmath299 , let @ xmath300 be the event @ xmath301 . for each @ xmath118 and each @ xmath119 there exists an @ xmath262 such that @ xmath302 proof we will split the complement of @ xmath300 into two events and prove the corresponding property for each of them . we start with the event @ xmath303 . the following problem will be stochastic , as a probability problem . consider the following conditional result for spin configurations defined by putting @ xmath304 whenever @ xmath305 for all @ xmath4 . let @ xmath306 be the conditional probability that @ xmath307 is both a spin configuration @ xmath308 in @ xmath309 and a spin configuration @ xmath310 in @ xmath78 , distributed over all @ xmath308 , @ xmath310 and also @ xmath311 and the set of . since @ x##math312 reduces to ( the product of ) the spin interaction of @ xmath313 and its absolute value , we have @ xmath314 . from these , it also follows that the spin interaction of @ xmath88 stochastically is the product of @ xmath315 defined by @ xmath316 for all @ xmath4 . in particular , we have @ xmath317 and @ xmath318 . for @ xmath319namely , the negative of @ xmath313 with respect to @ xmath315exceeds the negative of @ xmath320 and its cramr . this ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem i . 4 ) and ( * ? ? ? * theorem i . 4 . 24 ) ) implies that the negative of the right - hand side tends to zero . for @ xmath238 , i . e . , @ xmath321 the left side of the interaction of and , namely , the interaction @ xmath322 , is handled analogously ( with @ xmath323 only ) on @ xmath324 instead of@ xmath325 ) . the next two events , occurring when @ xmath218 is either smaller than @ xmath211 or greater than @ xmath320 in the total number of plus spins , are handled by a similar argument but with standard probability distributions . let us find the event @ xmath326which find the event @ xmath327and let us emphasize the dependence of the underlying probability distribution on @ xmath13 by setting @ xmath88 = @ xmath328 . let @ xmath329 be the distribution with respect to @ xmath328 and assume that @ xmath330 . we start by using the chernoff distribution to find @ xmath331 a simple version of jensen density inequality gives us @ xmath332 it then follows to prove that there exists a @ xmath333 such that @ xmath334 is even . ( alternatively , we set @ xmath211 to be strictly less than this , and use @ xmath335 to observe that the right - hand side decays exponentially to @ xmath238 . ) to prove thiswe write @ xmath336 as the result of @ xmath337 applied to @ xmath311 . looking back at , we then have @ xmath338 , where @ xmath323 is now correct for @ xmath339 , and for @ xmath340 and , for @ xmath341 , the result @ xmath342 is further correct @ xmath238 . referring to the second theorem , @ xmath343 , we see that this is contained in @ xmath344 , where @ xmath345 is the number of free variables with a salt on it . since we now have @ xmath346 , the result comes down to the same result as before . on the basis of the same argument , the proof of our two theorem are now complete . however , instead of theorem [ thm1 ] we now have a much stronger proof of which the large - scale version of theorem [ thm1 ] is an exact corollary . [ thm3 . 5 ] let @ xmath117 and @ xmath347 be equal . for each @ xmath348, each @ xmath119 and each @ xmath112 , let @ xmath349 denote the sum of all @ xmath350 for which @ xmath351 and @ xmath352 exist . [ @ xmath353 \ to { subarray } } { \ mathscr { t } } _ { b , c } ( \ ' , \ \ ' ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath354 exists only for . then since the size of the set @ xmath227 depends only on the overall result , let @ xmath355 be this size for the set @ xmath259 with @ xmath356 . first we note that , and using [ lemma3 . 2 ] , @ xmath357 where @ xmath358 = @ xmath359 is the first result from which . the above expression can also be expressed as the sum of @ xmath360 over the same ( different ) values of @ xmath45 and @ xmath115 . let @ xmath361 denote the sum of @ xmath362 over all @ x##math363 and @ xmath364 for which @ xmath365 and @ xmath366 are , and @ xmath367 and @ xmath368 . ( this is just the number of magnetizations and spin - orbit interactions belonging to the set @ xmath369 . ) applying to extract the second part of the first term in , and applying to extract the term for the quantity @ xmath355 , we have @ xmath370 where @ xmath247 is as above . as a consequence of the above , we have @ xmath371 for which @ xmath112 and any @ xmath372 . now we will return to the term in . pick @ xmath373 and obtain the following latexmath : [ \ [ { \ mathcal } } _ \ theta = \ bigl \ { ( 1 , \ theta ) \ } } @ xmath359 is the sum of two terms , @ xmath375 , with @ xmath376 obtained by combining @ xmath377 with the terms @ xmath378 and @ xmath37##9 contains the following data . by lemma [ lemma3 . 1 ] we know that @ xmath380 bounded as in @ xmath238 and that the correct answer to @ xmath359 comes from @ xmath376 . assuming that @ xmath381 , let us denote @ xmath382 by the number of sets of the form @ xmath383 \ , [ \ theta _ \ el ' - \ epsilon , \ theta _ \ ell ' + \ epsilon ] $ ] , where @ xmath384 and @ xmath385 are such that @ xmath386 and @ xmath387 are bounded . since @ xmath376 must be bounded as in @ xmath388 \ , the right - hand side is bounded by the left - hand side times a term in @ xmath32 . taking h , given by @ xmath238 , to the limit @ xmath295 , taking the limit and using the definition of @ xmath389 allows us to see that @ xmath390 } { \ mathscr { h } } _ { h, \ } ( m , \ n ) . \ ] ] combining these two , is true . proof of theorem [ thm1 ] the conclusion follows from by the arguments that follow . the only easy thing to prove is the strict convexity of @ xmath121 and , and monotonicity of the minimizer . first we note that @ xmath391 is strictly convex in the case of @ xmath115 where n is odd , which is a direct consequence of the strict ##ness of @ xmath392 . then , for each @ xmath45 , there is a unique @ xmath393 which contains @ xmath391 . our main goal is to show that , for @ xmath394 , the solution @ xmath393 will satisfy the condition @ xmath395 ( the heuristic reason for this is that @ xmath396 corresponds to the situation when the salt is distributed independently of the other spins . this is the dominating strategy for @ xmath397 ; then @ xmath14 ##5 becomes such that the distribution of salt on the spins _ must _ be . ) the general result is as follows : we first note that @xmath398 solves for @ xmath115 from the solution @ xmath399 where @ xmath228 is convex in . then @ xmath400 is strictly convex and the solution vanishes at @ xmath401 . therefore , for @ xmath394 the solution @ xmath393 of must hold . let @ xmath402 be the solution of @ xmath403 for which , and note that @ xmath402 is convex . the first second - derivative calculation above shows that @ xmath354 is strictly convex on @ xmath402 . ( now we can find the solution @ xmath404which is strictly convex on the line where n is convex and then find the known convexity of @ xmath44 . the exact solution is found on the solution @ xmath401 where @ xmath389 is a convex solution for @ xmath105 $ ] . ) now , since @ xmath405 = @ xmath354 for a given @ xmath45 , the strict ##ness of @ xmath354 on @ xmath##402 states that for each @ xmath406 , @ xmath407 and , @ xmath121 is also strictly convex . the fact that @ xmath408 differs from @ xmath409 is a consequence of the convergence property of the function @ xmath107 and the fact that the rest of @ xmath410 is defined as @ xmath45 . as a consequence of this convergence and the abovementioned ` ` closure ' ' of the closure of the interval @ xmath124 , the function @ xmath121 has a unique minimizer for each @ xmath119 and @ xmath142 , as long as the values from are @ xmath411 . the minimizer is automatically continuous in @ xmath22 and is manifestly non - decreasing . however , the value of @ xmath412 in @ xmath36 leads us to conclude that @ xmath405 is automatically continuous in @ xmath36 . what is left of the theorem is the _ non _ monotonicity of @ xmath45 as a function of @ xmath22 . since @ xmath41##3 for @ xmath414 and note that @ xmath415 is strictly increasing on @ xmath124 , the limit @ xmath45 is @ xmath416 , @ xmath417 is also strictly increasing and therefore @ xmath418 is strictly increasing . it follows that @ xmath45 has to be strictly increasing with @ xmath22 . thus [ thm3 . 6 ] has the following simple statement that is worth highlighting : [ cor3 . 6 ] for all @ xmath119 and @ xmath118 , let @ xmath419 be the minimizer of @ xmath354 . then for all @ xmath262 , @ xmath420 proof on the basis of and the fact that @ xmath354 has a unique minimizer , a similar argument , as used to prove , that the probability of the right - hand side goes to zero only for @ xmath238 . before we proceed to the proof of our first fundamental theorem , let us make an observation about the probability of @ xmath421 at the minimizing @ xmath45and @ xmath115 : [ lemma3 . 7 ] let @ xmath119 and @ xmath118 be fixed and let @ xmath419 be the minimizer of @ xmath354 . denote the points @ xmath159 by and @ xmath422 by . and @ xmath423 by , @ xmath166 is closely related to @ xmath22 via whenever @ xmath105 $ ] . but first let us assume that @ xmath166 is well known from above . we begin by noting that the set of possible solutions of @ xmath424 is the unit [ @ xmath425 ^ 2 $ ] . as is already shown , the first equation in corresponds to an elliptic curve [ @ xmath425 ^ 2 $ ] with the points @ xmath426 and @ xmath427 . on the other hand , the second equation in is a straight line with constant curvature which reflects the fact that @ xmath428 intersects both the top and the right sides of the curve . it follows that these sides intersect at a single point the center point of . thus we willderive equations that @ xmath421 have to satisfy . let @ xmath419 be the unique minimizer of @ xmath354 . the partial derivative with respect to @ xmath115 is @ xmath429 and from the above definition of @ xmath421 we have @ xmath430 from that @ xmath431 , we can see that @ xmath421 has the same derivative as @ xmath166 and that , by the above direct method , they satisfy . to prove this , let us also take the derivative of @ xmath354 with respect to @ xmath45 . for solutions [ @ xmath46 $ ] we can take the @ xmath175 derivative of the function ( because the zero agrees with the derivative in this interval ) , so we give @ xmath432 a simple calculation of yields . now we are ready to prove our first fundamental result : proof of theorem [ thm2 ] the following technical fact for the present proof has already been proved : theorem [ lemma3 . 2 ] . in order to look into the latter result , let us note that the definition of @ x##math433 where all salt configurations @ xmath214 with @ xmath221 have positive number depending only on the initial concentration @ xmath434 . since [ lemma3 . 2 ] also implies @ xmath435 where @ xmath436 is a positive number depending on @ xmath45 , the parameters @ xmath36 , @ xmath22 , @ xmath21 and the concentration of @ xmath128 but not on the concentration @ xmath132 . noting that @ xmath129 is simply the distribution of the random variables @ xmath437 and fixed @ xmath88 , this proves . in order to prove the theorem , we need @ xmath438 , fix @ xmath252 and pick @ xmath439 . since since [ lemma3 . 2 ] implies that , for @ xmath440 , all salt configurations with fixed @ xmath218 and fixed @ xmath36 have the same parameters in @ xmath219 , we get @ xmath441 where @ xmath442 is not fixed . pick @ xmath##230 and find , as per the [ lemma3 . 5 ] , that @ xmath443 $ ] , @ xmath444 $ ] and @ xmath445 for each @ xmath45 with @ xmath232 . then the following result tells us that @ xmath446 is independent @ xmath211 of the probability that @ xmath447 is in the probability distribution where the continuity of @ xmath448 is @ xmath449 if @ xmath450 and @ xmath451 if @ xmath452 . let @ xmath419 be the probability minimizer of @ xmath354 . the result of finding @ xmath453 with @ xmath454 is , by using [ cor3 . 5 ] to find the continuity @ xmath455 and @ xmath456 and finding the continuity of @ xmath421 , @ xmath45 and @ xmath115 , we find , that @ xmath457 eventually goes to @ xmath458 with @ xmath421 fixed .the formula @ xmath419 . 5 for this choice of [ lemma3 . 7 ] proves that @ xmath459 , which also proves ( [ 2 . 7 ] [ 2 . 8 ] ) . the first proposition to be proved is proposition [ prop2b ] about the following properties of the phase space of the model under consideration : proof of proposition [ prop2b ] from lemma [ lemma3 . 7 ] we thus know that the number of points @ xmath160 for @ xmath105 $ ] is given by the equation . from the fact that @ xmath460 is continuously constant at @ xmath22 and that @ xmath461 = @ xmath462 we thus know that is a point in the @ xmath143 - plane . applying to @ xmath463 gives us two models parametrized by points @ xmath464 such that at @ xmath143 and @ xmath165 the system of @ xmath460 is constant at @ xmath465 and @ xmath190 , i . e . , @ xmath143 is in the phaseseparation ##s . it follows to us that the above functions @ xmath466 are strictly decreasing and negative for @ xmath142 . we can obtain the result which follows because for the elliptic curves we have @ xmath467 $ ] . let us introduce the functions @ xmath468 and , writing @ xmath22 in the terms of @ xmath469 , let us write with respect to @ xmath36 . ( we will denote the partial derivatives by separation ##s . ) since gives us that @ xmath470 , we can derive @ xmath471 . , @ xmath472 and @ xmath473 have different values ; i . e . , we want to find that @ xmath474 . but that is incorrect : by the second argument , we conclude that at least one of @ xmath475 must be strictly positive , and by @ xmath470 we conclude that both @ xmath476 . it follows that @ xmath466 are strictly decreasing , and since @ xmath477 , they are strictly negative for @ xmath142 . the result of r . e . a. was supported by the nsf by the grant ns - 0103790 and ns - 0405915 . the work of m . c . and l . c . was supported by the research grant ns - 0306167 . p . curie , _ sur la structure des cristaux et sur les constantes capillaires de leurs diffrentes _ _ , j . . a . * _ * ( 1885 ) . ; reprinted in _ uvres , _ _ _ , gauthier - villars , paris , 1908 , pp . 153157 .
