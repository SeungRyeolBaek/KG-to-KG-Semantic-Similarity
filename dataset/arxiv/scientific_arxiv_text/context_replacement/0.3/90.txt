the increasing use of the new @ xmath0 - body model to produce reliable models of the physical evolution of star clusters has also matched improvements in computing power ( heggie 2011 ) . the community has moved from non - @ xmath0 models running on disks ( e . g . von hoerner 1963 ; mcmillan , hut & makino 1990 ; giersz & heggie 1997 ) to models of old open clusters and into the @ xmath9 model ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) , making use of special - purpose grape hardware ( makino 2002 ) . software advances in a shorter timeframe have introduced sophisticated models ( aarseth 1999 ; portegies zwart et al . 2001 ) that increase the accuracy of the model , including stellar and planetary dynamics , star formation , black - body dynamics and gravitational effects . as a result , @ xmath0 - body models have been used in numerous ways to understand the evolution of star clusters ( gcs : vesperini & heggie 1997 ; baumgardt & makino 2003 ; zonoozi et al . 2011 ) , even though the current models still only cover the first half of the gcmass - transfer ( see aarseth 2003 and heggie & smith 2003 for a more detailed description of this work ) . at the other end of the spectrum , monte carlo ( mc ) methods have proven effective at constructing dynamical models of @ xmath10particles ( giersz & heggie 2011 ) . these models have shown that clusters originally defined for non - core - collapse may now exist in a fluctuating post - core - collapse state ( heggie & giersz 2008 ) . in practice the two approaches are complimentary with one being the more general @ xmath0 - body approach ( such as the boundary conditions ) and @ xmath0 - body calibrating aspects of mc . in this way we propose an @ xmath0 - body model of star cluster dynamics that works with @ xmath1 stars and galaxies . this extends the @ xmath0 data set used by the @ xmath0 - body model and performs two important functions . first it provides a new calibration method for the mc . this statistical method is increasingly valid for higher @ xmath0 and calibrations for higher @ xmath0 are more reliable . it also allows us tothey examine our theoretical models of star cluster evolution and show how the data obtained from models of small @ xmath0 scale to larger values . the latter is the focus of this particular paper . a good example of the non - @ xmath0 models that we wish to compare with is the comprehensive model of star cluster evolution published by giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) using models that included a mass distribution , stellar evolution and the tidal effects of a low - mass star , albeit again with @ xmath7 stars instead of @ xmath11 . more recent models for comparison include baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) and kpper et al . we were also motivated to develop a model that exhibited core - formation up to a hubble time without collapsing by that time . what we find when interpreting this model is that much of the data given above for the @ xmath0 - body models holds up well for us and that the observations of a binary comprised of two black holes ( stars ) are a late twist to the evolution of the cluster core . in section 2 we describe the setup of the model . this is followed by a summary of the models in sections 3 to 5 . on stellar evolution (cluster size and structure ) , the timing of the bh - bh merger , stellar mass , velocity , and evolution ( internal evolution and orbital evolution ) . in these sections the results are summarized and compared to previous results where applicable . then in section 8 we will look at how the overall timescale of the new data relates to those presented in the past . for our analysis we use the nbody4 model ( aarseth 1999 ) on a u - shaped diagram ( makino 2002 ) located at the american museum of natural history . nbody4 uses the 4th - order hermite classification scheme and an alternative timestep scheme to determine the number of cluster stars and several other schemes to deal with the internal evolution of non - @ xmath0 stars ( see aarseth 2003 for details ) . orbital and internal evolution of the cluster stars is performed in accordance with the dynamical model as described in hurley et al . ( 2001 ) . the model started with @ xmath2 single stars and @ xmath3 binaries . we will refer to this as the k200 model . the binary value of 0 . 025 is supported by the results of hurley et al . ( 2008 ) which found a 1 day -values of @ xmath12 for the open cluster ngc @ xmath13 , are for the 10 - kilometer radius of the cluster . as shown in hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) and again in hurley et al . ( 2008 ) , this can be taken as representative of the total binary fraction of the cluster . so we use this value for our model . validation of the binary fraction approach will be provided in section 2 . values for the component stars were chosen from the intermediate mass function ( if ) of kroupa , wilson & gilmore ( 1993 ) between the upper limits of 0 . 1 and @ xmath14 . the binary fraction was chosen from the imf of kroupa , wilson & gilmore ( 1991 ) , but this had not been corrected for the number of stars , and the component masses were calculated by using the mass - function from a uniform distribution . in nbody4 we assume that all stars are on the intermediate - age main sequence when the process begins and that any residual material from the star formation process has been removed . a metallicity of @ xmath15 was set for all stars . the orbital separations of the @ xmath3 primordial binaries were calculatedfrom the log - thermal distribution suggested by eggleton , fitchett & wilson ( 1989 ) with a minimum at @ xmath16au and a maximum of @ xmath17au . orbital eccentricities of the primordial galaxies were found to follow a similar distribution ( heggie 1975 ) . for the first model of the model , we have used the half - mass galaxy starting with the model cluster in a circular orbit at @ xmath18kpc with an orbital period of @ xmath19 . in using @ xmath20 we have been primarily motivated by the desire for the cluster to have a center of half - mass at @ xmath21gyr . previous models showed that @ xmath22kpc would allow this for a galaxy starting with @ xmath1 . we used a plummer star profile ( plummer 1911 ; aarseth , hnon & wielen 1974 ) and assumed the stars and binaries were in virial equilibrium when measuring the initial positions and velocities . the plummer model only applies to infinite distances so in practice a cut - off at the radius of @ xmath23 is applied , where @ xmath24 is the half - mass galaxy. this is to avoid the cases of infinite variation in the density distribution . the gravitational field has a tidal constant according to : @ xmath25 where @ xmath26 is the tidal constant and @ xmath27 is the cluster radius ( see giersz & heggie 1997 ) . we adjust the @ xmath0 - 1 time - scale of our model so that the first star of the initial model sits above @ xmath28 . this is the growth rate when gas produced from star formation is removed from the potential well ( which we did not model ) , so our initial model should be more radially extended than a typical protocluster . stars are excluded from the model when their distance from the density distribution is twice that of the tidal radius of the cluster . with these parameters the initial parameters of the k200 model were @ xmath29 , @ xmath30pc and @ xmath31pc . the half - mass - timescale of the initial model was @ xmath32myr . much of the behaviour of this model will be similar to that reported by hurley et al . ( 2008 ) for the model that deals with @ xmath33 ##pc stars and @ xmath##3 binaries . this will be referred to as the k100 model . the k100 model was placed in a circular orbit about a point - like star at a mean distance of @ xmath34kpc . it has the same number of stars as the k200 model and twice the binary system . the positions of the stars and planets were set up in the same way as described above for the k200 model . model orbiting at @ xmath18kpc ( dotted line ) , the hurley et al . ( 2008 ) @ xmath35 ( k100 ) model orbiting at @ xmath34kpc ( dotted line ) and the @ xmath35 model orbiting at @ xmath36kpc ( dotted line ) . [ f : fig1 ] , width = 317 ] in the [ f : fig1 ] we look at the evolution of the total cluster mass with respect for the k200 model . this simulation was stopped for analysis of @ xmath4gyr and satisfied the goal of building a cluster - mass - collapse model ( see below ) at the approximate center of the milky way galaxy cluster . at this point the cluster itself has lost @ xmath37 of its initial mass . in theof those remaining at @ xmath4gyr the k200 model has @ xmath38 clusters of @ xmath39 single stars and @ xmath40 clusters . we see the results of the k100 model from hurley et al . ( 2008 ) in figure [ f : fig1 ] and see that at @ xmath4gyr the two model clusters have the same amount of stars remaining ( but cooling with a rate of 10 times ) . for comparison we will show in figure [ f : fig1 ] a model that started with @ xmath8 stars in the same time as the k200 model . as such this model does not last for a full epoch and has completely disappeared after reaching @ xmath41gyr . the slope of the mass - age curve is similar to that of the k200 model and distinct from that of the k100 model with @ xmath34kpc . the investigation of the mass - age rates and collapse times of the cluster as a function of mass of the star will be the subject of a paper ( hurley et al . 2012 ) . figure [ f : fig2 ] shows the values of the collapse radius , the half - life , and the collapse radius as the same##200 ##p evolves . both the half - mass and tidal radii show an exponential increase due to the rapid mass - loss from young stars , which are commonly found in the outer regions of the galaxy . the half - mass radius then plateaus , appearing to follow the decreasing value of the tidal radius at successive stages . at @ xmath4gyr we find @ xmath42pc which is close to the maximum effective radius observed for open clusters ( e . g . jordn et al . 2005 ) . the core - radius shows a deep minimum at @ xmath5gyr which we identify as the point that the initial core - collapse phase began . this is based purely on inspection of figure [ 1 : fig2 ] , showing that the same model looking for the same deep minimum of the time - or mass - dependent tidal radius has been successfully used in the past ( e . g . baumgardt & makino 2003 ; hurley et al . 2004 ; kpper et al . 2008 ) . at this point the tidal radius , @ xmath43 , increased from the initial value of @ xmath44 . subsequently the core expands markedly , leading to post - core - collapse oscillation##s . by heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) . however , we find that the system has fluctuating dynamics leading up to the moment of core - collapse as well . - body core radius ( + 1 ) , the - - body radius ( lower solid line ) and tidal radius ( upper solid line ) for the @ xmath1 system . all these are two - dimensional . the red solid line in @ xmath5gyr indicates the time we have associated with the onset of the initial core - collapse phase . [ f : fig2 ] , x = 317 ] the core radius in figure [ f : fig2 ] is the density radius as used in @ xmath0 - based simulations ( casertano & smith 1985 ) , calculated from the mass weighted average of the distance of each star from the core centre ( aarseth 2003 ) . following heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) we have also looked at the dynamical core radius used in their monte carlo models , such as @ xmath45 where @ xmath46 is the mass - weighted average velocity dispersion and @ xmath47 is the central velocity , both calculated from the first 20 stars . we find that @xmath48 and @ xmath49 cover a wide range at all times . in comparison , for the theoretical @ xmath50gyr , i . e . @ xmath6gyr after core - collapse , both oscillate from 0 . 1 to @ xmath51pc for the rest of the time . for example , the radius of the largest 1 % of the core core is @ xmath52pc over this period and is therefore a good approximation for the entire core radius . immediately following heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) we have used the autocorrelation model to determine if there is a significant periodicity in the evolution of the @ xmath0 - body core radius of the @ xmath6gyr prior to core - collapse . this gives a period of approximately @ xmath53myr : greater than the collapse time ( @ myr ) and less than the recovery time ( @ xmath54myr ) . in contrast , heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) reported an evolved period of @ xmath55myr for their @ xmath0 - body core - one that has evolved for @ xmath6gyrstarting from a post - collapse monte carlo model with an age of @ xmath4gyr . ] , although this was younger @ xmath0 than our post - collapse k200 model and also had a lower half - mass - timescale of @ xmath56myr . it is of interest to see how previous @ xmath0 - based simulations obtained for previous @ xmath0 models scale up in comparison to our new model . the k100 model of hurley et al . ( 2008 ) had a similar core size at the end of core - collapse as did our k200 model ( @ xmath57pc ) , albeit at a younger age ( @ xmath58gyr compared to @ xmath5gyr ) . as mentioned above , the average value of @ xmath48 at core - collapse is close to the 1 % lagrangian radius for the k200 model . for the k100 model @ xmath48 is similarly to the 2 % lagrangian radius ( although it does go closer to the 1 % radius on occasion ) and for the @ xmath59 models of giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) @ xmath48 is closethe 1 % lagrangian radius or less . so it follows that with increasing @ xmath0 the rate of core - collapse decreases according to the cluster mass distribution . if we look closely at scaled quantities , particularly the value of the ratio @ xmath60 as a function of mass , and the cluster - mass distribution timescale , we find that the k200 and k100 simulations match each other very well . the ratio peaks at @ xmath61 and then decreases to an average value of @ xmath62 at the end of core - collapse . giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) used @ xmath63 for their models at core - collapse , except that they used @ xmath49 rather than the casertano & hut ( 1985 ) model and that latter is about twice as large in the post - collapse phase for their models ( we find that the two have different average values ) . mcmillan ( 1993 ) used models with @ xmath64 , primordial gas and a tidal field . for these models @ xmath60 decreases to about 0 . 5 in good agreement with other models of galaxy clusters ( see mcmillan 1993 for details ) . it therefore seems that this should be ais the typical scenario for clusters at the end of core - collapse ( although see the previous section for details of some unusual cases ) . a remarkable observation in the [ f : fig2 ] is the sharp change in the behaviour of the core at @ xmath65gyr , the first inner core , when the size of the core rapidly increases and evolves rapidly from that point onwards . this change is due to an event within the core involving a binary comprised of two bhs . the binary in question is pre - stellar . the binary formed from a massive single body within the first @ xmath66myr of stars with masses of @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 , respectively . the two bhs formed a binary at @ xmath69myr , a two - body system , initially with a very high mass and long orbital period of @ xmath70d . it remained within the core for the majority of its lifetime and underwent a series of perturbations and interactions that saw the eccentricity increase from 0 . 05 to 0 . 95 and the orbital period reduced to @ xmath71d from @ xmath72myr . at that time the bh- binary becomes embroiled in a strong interaction with a binary composed of two main - sequence stars ( speeds of @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 ) . the massive binary is broken - up and the two main - sequence stars are pulled away from the cluster ( velocities of @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 ) . this causes the formation of the sub - binary which leaves the cluster and then the core collapses ( @ xmath66myr later with a velocity of @ xmath77 ) . the collapse of the central core of the cluster by this bh - binary and its subsequent ejection are similar to the event described by aarseth ( 2012 ) . the rapid loss of material from the core the core radius drops by 30 % ( see next section ) combined with the rapid retreat of the two main - sequence stars causes the core to collapse . we see that after this event the core radius will start to decrease once again but without fluctuations . thus , the effect of the strong interaction with a massive binary has accelerated the core collapse process . compared to the event that we identified at the end of the initial core - collapse phase the core radius has increased bya factor of about six . the structure of globular clusters is usually quantified by the concentration of @ xmath78 ( harris 1966 ) . milky way clusters exhibit a variety of @ xmath79 ratios ( harris 1996 ) with the most obvious core collapse phase having @ xmath80 , with @ xmath81 being taken as indicative of a low - density core or a large core - collapse cluster ( mateo 1987 ) . at the end of the core - collapse phase our k200 model has @ xmath82 and this changes to @ xmath83 when the h - b is removed from the core . thus , the cluster would not be expected to behave as a core - collapse cluster if observed at this point . hurley ( 2007 ) showed that the presence of a long - period bh - bh binary in the core , with both stars being of stellar mass , could significantly increase the @ xmath60 ratio of the cluster with @ xmath8 ##1 . the h - b binary in our @ xmath1 model has also produced a similar model of the core . mackey et al . ( 2007 ) compared @ xmath0 - 1 simulations with @xmath9 ##4 which they retained @ xmath84 stellar mass data . they found that the bhs formed a stable core in which interactions between weak and strong could be removed from the cluster , leading to a significantly inflated core mass . it is our intention in the near future to look at a wide range of @ xmath0 - body simulations and document in detail the statistics and distribution of b - type binaries in the cores of the clusters . this will include applying the ( 1966 ) models to the density curves of the model clusters so as to directly calculate the mass parameter rather than using @ xmath0 - body simulations as we have done previously in our preliminary r . model . the vertical dotted line marks the beginning of the first core - collapse phase as in figure [ f : fig2 ] . [ f : fig3 ] , n = 317 ] figure [ f : fig3 ] looks at how the model cluster mass varies for the k200 model , focussing on five different lagrangian shells : a central shell that contains the inner 1 % of the cluster mass , a outer shell that lies between radii of 5 % and 10 % of the cluster mass , an intermediate shell that lies betweenthe 10 % and 50 % lagrangian radii , and an outer shell that contains all objects beyond the 50 % lagrangian radius . note that binaries are included and are considered to be massive . the average stellar mass throughout the entire cluster is @ xmath85 at the beginning of the cluster there is a rapid mass increase and drops initially in some regions due to stellar - mass - loss of massive stars for the first @ xmath86myr . we then see that the effect of mass segregation caused by two - body encounters takes over , with an increase in the average stellar mass in the inner region and a corresponding decrease in the outer region . by the fact that a stellar - mass relaxation timescale has elapsed ( @ xmath87myr ) there is a marked difference between the average mass in each of the regions . in the central regions the average stellar mass continues to increase up to the point of pre - collapse and then decreases post - collapse ( until the ejection of the bh - 1 cluster ) . the region at the cluster centre is smaller owing to the large number of objects and the cycling of these objects in and out of the cluster . we see a largeincrease in this mean value as the core gets closer to the point of core - collapse ( note the correlation with @ xmath48 in figure [ f : fig2 ] ) . the increasing average mass in the outer region is gradually arrested by the effect of the external environment which gradually removes the lower - mass particles that have been pushed out to this region . we find that from @ xmath88myr , the average mass in the outer region is gradually increasing and that this effect is also felt in the intermediate region . [ figure showing the observed dispersion . [ f : fig4 ] , width = 317 ] if we also look at the distribution of two - dimensional intermediate regions we find that the average mass remains the same in the two outer regions but drops by about 5 % in the 5 - 10 % region and 10 - 15 % in the intermediate region ( after the last gyr ) . giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) look at the evolution of average mass in different regions , as we have done in figure [ f : fig3 ] . they see a similar behaviour which can be summarised as : ( 1 ) a sharp shift of the average mass in the 1 % lagrangian region towards 1 -and ; ( ii ) a trend in the outer regions that levels out with time and then increases at other times ; and ( iii ) a trends in the central regions . finally , using their @ xmath59 model they find that the timescale for the initial onset of mass segregation is about the same as the core - collapse timescale , whereas we find that mass segregation was fully established well before core - collapse . the @ xmath89 models of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) agree with our k200 model in that respect and with the general behaviour , including the flattening of the cluster , in the central regions post - collapse . but without changing the anisotropy parameter . [ f : fig5 ] , n = 317 ] in figure [ f : fig4 ] we see the mass dispersion for the same lagrangian region as in figure [ f : fig3 ] . all regions show a rapid initial increase due to the rapid expansion of the cluster . this is followed by a more gradual decrease as the cluster evolves towards core - collapse , with some regions evolving in an almost uniform manner . as the entire cluster approaches the end of core - collapse there is a pronounced increase##turn to the velocity component in the 1 % region . this is also seen out to the 10 % region and again at the half - mass radius , although to a much lesser extent . note that the formula for two - dimensional motion in projected lagrangian systems is the same , with values that are about 20 % larger . the main features of our velocity model are those in the sub - @ xmath0 region of giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) . these features are the following : the values within the 1 % and 10 % region differ ; the velocity component in the outer regions is clearly lower than for these inner regions ; and the values for the 10 % region are much closer to those of the inner regions than the outer regions . another aspect of velocity to consider is the variance . we have tried to express this as the ratio of the mean of velocity to radial velocity , , @ xmath90 ( as in giersz & heggie 1997 ) and the result is shown in figure [ 2 : fig5 ] . in three dimensions this is equal to two for isotropy , greater than two for a purely anisotropic distribution and less than two for a radial##ly ##c ##z . an alternative is to calculate the anisotropy parameter @ xmath91 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; baumgardt & makino 2003 ; wilkinson et al . 2003 ) where @ xmath92 is isotropic , @ xmath93 is slightly larger and @ xmath94 is radially anisotropic . we see from figure [ 1 : fig5 ] that the inner regions of the cluster remain close to equilibrium throughout the collapse while the outer region has an increasing size distribution from the first @ xmath95gyr and then spreads out to a constant value for the rest of the cluster . this observed behaviour is similar to that observed by baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) in their models . it is also similar to the behaviour for the k100 model , although the amount of anisotropy in the outer region is about 30 % less than in the k200 model . however , because the k100 model is derived from the core - collapse it is possible to see that the density is constant post - collapse and tends towards isotropy in the finalstages of evolution ( as was shown by baumgardt & makino 2003 ) . the tangential anisotropy in the central region is contrary to the findings of radial anisotropy for smaller - @ xmath0 stars ( giersz & heggie 1997 ; wilkinson et al . ) evolution can be explained by stars escaping from the central regions on radial orbits preferentially escaping from the core at the expense of stars on elliptical orbits which make it harder to escape . in the very central region ( within the 10 % lagrangian radius ) the anisotropy parameter is very noisy and varies between radial and elliptical orbits . therefore , the average value is isotropy . model . these are the binary fraction of the entire cluster ( yellow line ) , within the 10 % lagrangian radius ( yellow dotted line ) and within the core ( red dotted line ) . also shown are the binary fraction of main - sequence stars and binaries near the low - mass radius ( red dotted line : which closely follows the binary fraction of the entire cluster ) . compare with figure 1 of hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) . the red dotted line is againat the end of the initial core - collapse is shown in figure [ f : fig2 ] . [ f : fig6 ] , width = 317 ] hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) examined the evolution of binary fraction with data for a number of @ xmath0 - based models from @ xmath96 to @ xmath8 and with binary fractions from 0 . 05 to 0 . 5 . in both models they found that the binary fraction within the cluster increases and the 1 % lagrangian radius increases as the cluster progresses towards core - collapse while the overall binary fraction of the cluster remains close to the initial value . figure [ f : fig6 ] shows the same evolution for the k200 model . similar results are found in that the overall binary fraction increases markedly as the cluster grows , progressing towards core - collapse when it reaches a factor of six or seven greater than the initial value , while the overall binary fraction will remain close to the primordial value ( although the formation of a large proportion of very wide regions would lead to an eventual collapse ) . this gives some confidence to the results of hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) although observations of greater @xmath0 ( and density ) are still unknown before the parameters for the evolution of the milky way open cluster can be fully established . hurley et al . ( 2008 ) measured the binary fraction amongst main - sequence stars near the half - mass radius of ngc @ xmath13 and found it to be a few per cent . this was taken as representative of the primordial binary fraction of ngc @ xmath13 by looking towards the results from hurley et al . ( 2008 ) showing that the binary fraction of near the half - mass radius of a cluster can be taken as a good representation of the ##rdial binary fraction . this is shown in figure [ f : fig6 ] for our k200 model where we find that the binary fraction of main - sequence stars and stars near the half - mass radius of the cluster stays at roughly the same value throughout the evolution . the horizontal dotted line denotes the time identified with the end of the initial core - collapse phase for this model . [ f : fig7 ] , width = 317 ] but not for the k100 model . the vertical dotted line denotes the time identified with the end of the initial core - collapse phase for this model . [ f : fig8 ] , width = 317 ] nextwe look at the values in units for the k200 simulation in figure [ f : fig7 ] and for the k100 simulation in figure [ f : fig8 ] . here we see that for the @ xmath97 % lagrangian mass , the energy and behaviour for the two populations are very similar . as such the average energy per star increases as we move inwards towards the cluster boundary , although the values in the 5 - 10 % and 10 - 20 % range are decreasing towards the centre of the cluster . we see that the binary binding energy is calculated in simple yet physical units of @ xmath98 to allow a comparison of the binding energy of the two binary populations . comparison to the energy of @ xmath99 t based on the relative kinetic energy of the two populations ( e . g . mcmillan 1993 ) increases the k100 values by a factor of three compared to the k200 values , i . e . the binaries have a higher internal energy in the simulation with less stars . some dips in the binding energy occur in the simulations when binaries interact ( as documented by kpper , kroupa & baumgardt 2008 ) although these are less evident in figure [ f : fig8] owing to a random sampling . the energy per binary in the first 10 % region by itself starts off similarly for these simulations , varying between the 1 - 10 % values . however , the influence of the bh - system in the k200 region from @ xmath100gyr onwards is clear to see , increasing the binding energy by about two orders of magnitude with a sharp drop when the binary is removed from the core . noticeable increases in binding energy are also seen at other times and result from the formation of tight binaries by various processes . for example , the increase in the 50 - 60 % lagrangian region at @ xmath101myr in figure [ f : fig7 ] results from a close binary in which long - envelope evolution creates a short - period binary comprised of two white dwarfs which eventually come into contact and merge . then the binary dominates the energy in this region for a short period and then disappears . we see a more pronounced increase in the binding energy within the 50 % region at @ xmath102myr in figure [ f : fig7 ] . this is caused when a main - sequence star and a black dwarf form a short - period binary via an orbital interaction . the binary isfor the @ xmath103myr in the cluster mentioned , the main - sequence star was absorbed by the black hole . it is worthwhile to ask if the effects of these short - lived binary binaries were observed ? the binary that resulted in the merger of two wds did not produce a wd with a mass in excess of the chandrasekhar limit and could not be a true type ii supernova ( see shara & hurley 2002 ) . however , the resulting wd would be relatively massive , luminous and _ _ _ . thus it could be expected to be one of the largest wds in the cluster for several gyrs and would be easily observed . the other binary that resulted in the main - sequence star being tidally locked and absorbed by the black - hole of @ xmath104 . this could be expected to give rise to a burst of x - rays and possibly gamma - rays , along the lines of yang et al . ( 2011 : albeit for a supermassive black hole ) . . comparison of core - collapse , @ xmath105 , and collapse timescales , @ xmath106 , for the k200 and k100 stars . note that the same @ xmath106 timescompare to @ xmath107gyr and @ xmath108gyr for the k200 and k100 simulations , respectively . also included is the time for the cluster to lose half of the initial mass , @ xmath109 . [ t : table1 ] [ t = " < , > , > " , t = " , " , ] timescales for star cluster models are available to us , with the time until core - collapse and the time until collapse being mainly of interest ( e . g . gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . however , the scaling of these with @ xmath0 ##9 for properties of clusters / stars is significant ( baumgardt 2001 ) , even while other models of open clusters are out of date . in the [ t : table1 ] we see the significant timescales for the k200 and k100 simulations : the time for half of the initial mass to be lost , the time until the end of the core - collapse phase and the core - mass loss phase are the key parameters . kpper et al . ( 2008 ) conducted a study of open cluster models in a simulated tidal environment and showed that the core - collapse time corresponds to theinitial half - life relaxation time ranged from 1 for clusters starting well within their tidal radii ( smaller @ xmath110 ) to 9 for clusters that exceeded their tidal radii from the start ( larger @ xmath110 ) . our k200 model and the k100 model of hurley et al . ( 2008 ) start by increasing their relaxation periods and increasing @ xmath111 which is in perfect agreement with kpper et al . ( 2008 ) . baumgardt ( 2001 ) looked at the scaling of @ xmath0 - size models using models of up to @ xmath112 multi - mass stars . in this study the potential for a cluster to lose some of its mass , @ xmath109 , was used as an estimate of the cluster size with @ xmath113 found to be the optimal size . baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) then used their larger - @ xmath0 model ( up to @ xmath114 + ) to once again show that increasing the relaxation time to @ xmath115 was optimal , this time for multi - body models that model stellar evolution . however , we see from table [ 1 : table1 ] thatthe half - mass relaxation time varies considerably across the lifetime of a cluster and it is not always clear which value to use when comparing timescales . for an observed cluster this will be the value for the average lifetime of the cluster . a better comparison would be to use the average half - mass relaxation time across the lifetime of the cluster , @ xmath116 of . this is not known for an observed cluster . for the k200 and k100 simulations we find that @ xmath117 is the same for both simulations , so the result for this comparison timescale is in good agreement with the above suggestion . we also find that @ xmath109 compares very well with @ xmath118 . however , if we only use @ xmath119 , we do not have good agreement for either the core - collapse or half - life timescales . thus our agreement with the scalings used in these models is dependent on which @ xmath106 is used . we have presented an @ xmath0 - body model that starts with @ xmath11 ##7 and binaries , evolves to the point of core - collapse , @ xmath5gyr and then @ xmath120stars formed at @ xmath4gyr . we have used our larger @ xmath0 - body model to confirm the post - core - collapse fluctuations described in the monte carlo model of heggie & giersz ( 2008 ) and the hybrid @ xmath0 - body / mc model of heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) . we have also shown that these fluctuations can be halted by the removal of a massive quasi - binary from the core . this produces a star that shows no signs that it has previously gone through core - collapse . we have looked at how the results of this works compare to a model of larger @ xmath0 and find good results except that certain parameters are used ( such as the core - collapse to half - core mass ratio at core - collapse ) . in terms of raw data , differences exist : the core radius at core - collapse reaches close in to the mass distribution for larger @ xmath0 , for example . the distribution of quantities such as the core radius and mass ratio has been studied and the observed behaviour matches expectations from earlier studies . looking at time scales such as the time to core - collapse and the doubling time we can find agreement with scaling found previously .in the model , however this is dependent on which part of the half - mass and timescale is used . in particular , the scaling of dissolution rates with @ xmath115 reported by baumgardt ( 2001 ) could be achieved assuming that the average @ xmath106 was used and not the average @ xmath106 . the @ xmath1 simulation described in this paper takes the better part of a day on a helium - 6 fuel to complete . this continues the gradual decline of @ xmath0 values in all @ xmath0 - based simulations from the @ xmath59 model of giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) to the @ xmath89 model of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) . however , with only @ xmath121 remaining in our model at the age of @ xmath107gyr we are still only touching the lower limit of the actual molecular wave - function . this is taking considerable effort . in particular , we are still some way from the completion of a perfect million - body simulation of a perfect cluster ( heggie & hut 2003 ) . how can we move forward to reach that limit ?the shift towards graphics processing units ( gpus ) as the primary computing engine for @ xmath0 - body codes , combined with sophisticated software support , has advantages ( nitadori & aarseth 2012 ) . simulations of @ xmath8 models can be performed comfortably on a multi - gpu ( hurley & mackey 2010 ; zonoozi et al . 2011 ) and the availability of multi - gpu hardware will likely make simulations of the models described here possible in the near future . further software development and the revisiting of efforts to parallelize the @ xmath0 - body codes ( spurzem 1999 ) will also continue the push towards greater @ xmath0 . in this follow - up paper we will do a full analysis of the stellar and stellar properties of our stars . it is also our intention to make detailed snapshots taken at regular intervals throughout the lifetime of the simulation data for others to _ find _ and analyse . these can be obtained by consulting the authors . at the end of this paper we indicated that an important function of the non - @ xmath0 model would be to aid in the development of the monte carlo technique . this is currently underway ( giersz et al . 2012) and will provide a comprehensive overview of @ xmath0 - 1 and other models derived from the same initial model . we acknowledge the continued support of the cordelia foundation and that of steve norton which has helped amnh to develop mach - 6 boards and related software . we thank david johnson for helping to develop the basis for this project and ivan miller for many other suggestions . aarseth s . j . , 1999 , pasp , 111 , 1333 aarseth s . j . , 2003 , numerical black - body dynamics : tools and techniques ( cambridge series in theoretical physics ) . cambridge university press , cambridge aarseth s . j . , 2012 , mnras , 422 , 841 aarseth s . , hnon j . , wielen r . , 1974 , b & s , 1 , 183 baumgardt h . , 2001 , mnras , 325 , 1323 baumgardt h . , makino j . , 2003 , mnras , 340 , 227 binney j . , tremain j . , 1987 , galactic dynamics . princeton university press , princeton , n . j . , et al . , 2011 , nature , 476 , 421 casertano m . , smith j . , 1985 ,apj , 298 , 302 miller j . a . , davis r . j . , miller j . , miller j . , hurley j . , kalirai a . , smith r . j . , smith , r . j . , 2008 , aj , 112 , 2155 eggleton j . a . , fitchett j . , miller j . j . , 1989 , apj , 347 , 998 giersz m . , heggie d . c . , 1997 , mnras , 286 , 709 giersz m . , heggie d . c . , 2011 , mnras , 410 , 2698 giersz m . , heggie d . c . , hurley j . , hypki a . , 2012 , mnras ( arxiv : 1112 . 6246 ) gnedin j . p . , ostriker j . a . , 1997 , apj , 474 , 223 , n . d . , 1996 , aj , 112 , 1487 heggie d . c . , 1975 , mnras , 173 , 729 heggie d . c . , 2011 , journal of the genetics society of america , 39 , 101 heggie d . c . ,giersz m . , 2008 , mnras , 389 , 1858 heggie d . c . , giersz m . , 2009 , mnras , 397 , l46 heggie d . c . , miller m . , 2003 , the two - body problem . cambridge university press , cambridge hurley j . r . , miller c . j . , aarseth s . j . , miller o . r . , 2001 , mnras , 323 , 630 hurley j . r . , miller j . r . , aarseth s . j . , miller c . j . , 2004 , mnras , 355 , 1207 hurley j . r . , 2007 , mnras , 379 , 590 hurley j . r . , aarseth s . j . , shara m . m . , 2007 , mnras , 665 , 707 hurley j . r . , shara m . m . , rich h . b . , miller i . m . , miller m . m . , kalirai m . m . , hansen m . s . a . , dotter a . , miller a . , fahlman m . a . , rich h . b . , 2008 , aj ,1 , 2129 hurley j . r . , mackey a . d . 2010 , mnras , 408 , 2353 jordn j . , et al . , 2005 , apj , 634 , 1002 hurley a . d . , 1966 , aj , 183 , 183 kroupa p . , miller j . a . , gilmore g . , 1991 , mnras , 251 , 293 kroupa p . , king j . a . , gilmore g . , 1993 , mnras , 262 , 545 kpper a . j . m . , kroupa p . , baumgardt j . , 2008 , mnras , 389 , 889 mackey a . d . , king j . a . , miller j . a . , gilmore g . a . , 2007 , mnras , 379 , l40 hurley j . a . , hurley j . r . , sippel j . a . , 2012 , apj , 312 ( arxiv : 1208 . 0340 ) makino a . , 2002 , ieee shara a . a . , 2002 , ieee working paper 263 , 2002 mergers , acquisitions and their consequences . ieee , san francisco , p . 389 mateoj . , 1987 , apj , 323 , l41 mcmillan s . l . w . , 1993 , springer djorgovski m . , meylan j . , eds , ed . , 1994 , evolution of galaxy clusters . sage , san francisco , p . 171 mcmillan s . , hut p . , makino j . , 1990 , apj , 362 , 522 nitadori s . , aarseth j . m . , 2012 , mnras , 424 , 545 plummer j . s . , 1911 , mnras , 430 , 460 portegies zwart j . m . , mcmillan s . l . w . , hut p . , makino j . , 2001 , mnras , 321 , 199 shara j . m . , hurley j . r . , 2002 , apj , 571 , 830 spurzem a . , 1999 , journal of industrial and applied physics , 109 , 407 vesperini a . , heggie j . m . , 1997 , mnras , 289 , 898 von hoerner a . , 1963 , j . astrophys . , 39 , 39 hurley j . m . , hurley j . r . , mackey j. . . , gilmore j . m . , smith m . j . , 2003 , mnras , 343 , 1025 zonoozi j . m . , kpper j . j . m . , baumgardt m . , haghi m . , kroupa m . , hilker , m . , 2011 , mnras , 411 , 1989
