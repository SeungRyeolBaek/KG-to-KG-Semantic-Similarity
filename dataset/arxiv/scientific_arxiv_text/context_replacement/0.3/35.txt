to study the reactivity of cu surfaces with nitrogen oxides ( no @ xmath0 ) is an important goal for development of new electronic materials effective in the no @ xmath0 reduction process @ xcite . the molecular adsorption of no @ xmath0 , for example , was found to be less efficient on cu , compared with highly reactive ni , ir , ru , cu , and ni surfaces , although dissociative addition was reported at high concentrations in no @ xcite . in order to provide suitable surfaces for the study , both thin films and high temperature surfaces were used in one no @ xcite . in the atomic structure simulations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) , on the other hand , dissociative adsorption of cu was found to be possible but energetically un - favored compared with molecular no @ xcite . we found that the simulations were often performed with respect to nm on stable cu surfaces . although the theoretical results suggested less reactivity of cu bulk surfaces for no @ xmath0 reduction , there could be increased stability of some nano - like atomic structures of cu . when we consider wider range of nano - scale structures other than cu .of these cu crystals , one could find another clue . in this line of research , indeed , many theoretical investigations with computer simulations have been done . to explore possibility of _ e . g . _ no - no structures of various metals @ xcite . to explore possible no structures , we consider ultra ##fine no structures . in this study , we focus on a cu boundary layer , that is the cubic lattice of cu . we used structural optimization techniques based on molecular structure calculations to find a stable cubic cubic lattice ( cu - tl ) . on this cubic structure , we adsorbed an no molecule and performed an optical experiment . after studying molecular adsorbed structures , we looked for dissociative adsorption of the cu molecule . to find a possible reaction mechanism and to propose a reduction process , we performed calculations for reaction path estimation . in the discussion of this study , by comparing the obtained adsorption ##s with each other , we can discuss a possible no @ xmath0 reduction process by using the nano - scale . we performed the electronic structure calculations based on the density matrix of @ xcite to determine the electronic state , and to obtain inter - atomic forces . in this study , the kohn - sham wavefunctions were used in theplane - waves and the total charge density was given by on the real axis , and on the fourier transform . an approximation for the exchange - correlation energy functional by perdew , brown , and ernzerhof @ xcite using the techniques of the generalized fourier method was obtained . the ultra - soft pseudo - potential @ xcite was used to describe the free electron dynamics . all of our simulations were done in the same package , the 3d mesh @ xcite . the boundary conditions are summarized as follows . the energy cut - off for the wave function expansion was 240 [ ry ] , while the cut - off for the charge density was 240 [ ry ] . the brillouin zone integration was done using 8 @ xmath1 instead of 8 @ xmath28 @ xmath21 for the first unit cell simulations . these calculations were refined , if the computational facility allowed for faster calculations . the final result for the force vector was that the expansion ended , when the absolute value of the total force vector became less than 8 @ xmath210 @ xmath3 [ ry / e . u . ] . to determine possible internal dimensions of the nano - structures , we considered nano - scale structures . an important structure for our discussionis the cu triangular lattice ( cu - tl ) . in this simulation , we obtained models for molecular and electronic properties of cu - cl . we obtained an optimized lattice structure for the cu atomic layer in a cubic super cell . major calculation conditions were the same as those given in fig [ 2 ] . the @ xmath1 - point mesh was calculated @ xmath224 @ xmath21 in this simulation . the mesh was given as a hexagonal shape . the vacuum layer had thickness of 3 . in this simulation , the shape of the cubic structure was optimized . the bond length was chosen to be 2 . 55 . [ fig : cu - tl - c - a ] ) this value is rather small compared to the bond length 2 . 55 of the bulk cu structure . the reason for shrink ##ing the bond length is mainly to reduce the total bond energy . the band gap of cu is energetically lower than the bulk cu by 1 . 5 ev per cubic cu atom . of the triangular lattice of cu . the value of @ xmath4 @ rydberg is given as a function of the lattice constant @ xmath5 [ ] . , [ = 302 ] starting from these initial calculations , wefound appearance of cu - tl in optimized simulations . as another evidence to show the local stability of cu - t , we used an atomic two - layer structure ( atls ) . this structure was created by cutting the bulk of cu atoms and was placed in a simulation unit - cell . the resulting structure was perpendicular to the ( z ) direction of bulk cu and it was contained in an orthorhombic unit cell . the difference between atls and cu - t was 0 . 11 ev per a cu atom . the theoretical analysis of the structure concluded local stability . however , atls was not kept against the reconstruction which was observed when an no molecule was placed on it . instead , we used a randomly selected structure starting from a no molecule adsorbed on atls . this means that using atls as an experimental structure , surprisingly enough , we used simulated annealing in our simulation . compared with this un - stable structure , cu - tl was found to be stable . when the molecule was adsorbed on atls , formation of atls happened and formation of cu - tl was observed in our simulation . conversely , we could show that cu - t was stable against molecules making advances toward atls .even when one considers local ##ization of the atomic structure by atoms , however , the experimental description of the phenomenon would be impossible to be done with real data . formation of an atomically thin layer , _ i . e . _ cu - layer , will require development of a fabrication method . recently , formation of an atomic layer of pb on the cu ( 111 ) substrate was reported @ xcite . in this superconducting pb system , positions of pb atoms are affected by the atomic structure of the substrate and inter - atomic distance between the atoms is not determined independently from the substrate . the most recent example of natural formation of the atomic layer is graphene @ xcite . this highly flexible structure of carbon is possible to be supported in silicon according to the modified c - c sp @ xmath6 bond . taking a graphene film and pasting it on a di - di - oxide surface , graphene is obtained efficiently from silicon . in case of silicon , we may expect formation of an atomic layer on a suitable silicon substrate . we would be able to produce the atomic layer as a film , on a support with a nano - meter - diameter hole . thus , the properties of the atomic layer would be accounted for . a good##ene sheet @ xcite . ) for our assumption of no adsorption , the local structure of copper is important . therefore , we assume an atomic - scale local structure of a layer of nano - scale copper . the transition of states ( ts ) of cu - tl is shown in 3d . [ fig : cu111 - m - band ] . the major peaks are shown similarly to the bulk structure . looking up from the low energy level , we see that the 4s band starts from - 4 . 05 ev and spreads out to the 3d level . sharp peaks of 2d levels are seen from - 4 . 04 ev but the 3d levels stop at the fermi level . therefore , parfectly the 3d band with the @ xmath7 band is shown and the rest described as an @ xmath8 band . these same features are present in the electronic band structure of cu - tl , too . [ fig : 1 - 2d - band ] ) along the @ xmath9 - m line , and the non - @ xmath9 line , we see hybridization of the 2d band and a 3d level . comparison with the cu ( 111 ) surface allows us to evaluate similarity and difference between cu - tl andthe bulk cu surface . the density of states in the 3d bands leveled almost around 0 . 2 owing to two - dimensional nature . dos in the 3d bands peaked well above 4 for cu - 111 in the unit of states / atoms per a unit area , while the value ranged from 3 to 6 , except for the singularity at the top of the 3d bands , for the cu ( 111 ) surface . the shorter bond lengths of cu atoms , the peak in dos should be lower for a 3d lattice structure . thus , the higher dos peak for cu - 111 than for the bulk cu suggests that two - dimensional nature of cu - tl favors dos . since dos at the fermi level is nearly the same for both cu - 111 and the cu ( 111 ) surface , the electronic behavior of both is expected to be similar , if the surface is kept undeformed . however , we should note that the energy of cu - surface is much closer to the fermi energy for cu - 111 than the cu ( 111 ) surface . this tendency affects the reactivity of cu - tl against no . when the primary adsorption site is the flat - top surface , similarity between the energy and the surface energy would be expected .however , if a solid site or a hollow site became stable for no on cu - tl , we could have differed significantly in the surface area from that of the cu ( 111 ) surface . this is because much easy modification of the molecular atomic structure is required for cu - 111 and the bond formation between no and cu - tl will form defects . in the next section , we discuss occurrence of strong reactions between no and cu - 111 . we consider adsorption of no on cu - 111 and an atomic step like structure ( ass ) based on an cu atomic structure . the first example was found in optimization simulations of no adsorption on atls . observing simulations of step - like structures produced from atls , we identified a stable substrate structure in the super cell as cu - tl with ass in our simulations . therefore , we identified cu - tl and ass as typical atomic - scale atomic structures of cu . several possible adsorption sites for no were found in these structures . the adsorbed structures were obtained by structural simulations . starting from an atomic structure with a single molecule with little separated from the substrate , cu - tl , ass and atls , each atomic structure was determined . by a series of simulations, we found the following general rules for molecular adsorption . on cu - tl , adsorption to a single site is the most favorable . on ass , a single site on the same surface is energetically most favorable among sites including an on - top site , a hollow site in the front surface , and a bridge site on the back surface . however , we describe these locally stable structures only in the following discussion . first , structures corresponding to molecular adsorption were found by locating n and o atoms a little separated from the surface and then observing the whole structure . we also found the locally stable dissociative crystal structures on cu - tl and on ass . the structures are shown in fig . [ fig : 2 - sideview ] . as for structures , we describe these structures below . we calculate the adsorption energy using the following formula . @ xmath10 is , @ xmath11 is the molecular binding energy , and @ xmath12 is the molecular adsorption energy . the values of @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 are the total energy of a cu slab with n and that of another slab with a cu atom and an oatom formation on the cu slab , @ xmath15 is the total energy of the cu slab without no , and @ xmath16 is the total energy of the no molecule formed in a super cell with the same energy as the above values . the total energy is given as , @ xmath17 . structures found in our study are shown in the following list . the adsorption energy is also given in each figure for example . molecular adsorption on cu - tl : : in adsorption of a no molecule on a surface of cu - tl , a bridge site ( - 0 . 92 ev ) is selected . see the center figure of fig . [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( a ) . atom formation on ass : : in formation of a no molecule on an atomic step - like structure , a bridge site ( - 1 . 69 ev ) is selected . see the center figure of fig . [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( b ) . dissociative formation : : dissociative formation of no is found on tl ( - 0 . 92 ev ) and on ass ( - 1 . 69 ev ) . thethe right figures of fig . [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( a ) and ( b ) . now , two adsorption mechanisms are discussed . we have two different dissociative cubic structures on cu - cu and on cu . in the cubic structure , the nitrogen atom locates at the center of the surrounding oxygen atoms . ( see the right figures of fig . [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( a ) . ) this structure may be regarded as a typical interstitial impurity in the cubic structure . arrangement of cu is largely distorted from the tl , so that the n atom is embedded in cu layer . the o atom is at a hollow site and o is embedded in cu layer . the crystal structure of these impurity sites are ncu @ xmath18 and ocu @ xmath19 . here , the ocu @ xmath19 structure is shown . a reason for appearance of the different coordination sites for cu and o is that the structure is not largely distorted and that 3d @ xmath20 structure is almost perfect . both sites are in solid states and that the sites 3d @ xmath3 and 3d @ xmath21 are efficiently screened byneighboring five and four nitrogen atoms . in ass , we found another molecular adsorbed site for no . the nitrogen atom is also present in the cubic structure . ( see the right figure of fig . [ 2 : ss - sideview ] ( b ) . ) in this case , the hydrogen atom is at the center site and has two - fold coordination , while the nitrogen atom has four - fold coordination . then we compare the obtained values of binding energy with those of the complex . the molecular binding energy is higher for ass than those on cu - s . as for a case of a non - central site on the back side of ass , the nitrogen reaches the bridge site of the step - like structure . this general tendency is remarkable in comparison to the cubic structures known in the literature . the most notable feature of our study is the finding of the large molecular binding energy . we found that the molecular adsorption can occur , when the nitrogen atom can go to an central site of a cubic structure . the energy value of @ xmath12 ( - 1 . 92 ev on tl and - 1 . 96 ev on ass ) is also possible , since these structures .the coordination of no with the no atom . on the clean cu ( 111 ) surface , this favors the negative adsorption ( with the interaction energy of - 1 . 22 ev estimated in ref . @ xcite ) against the dissociation of no , where the negative adsorption energy is estimated to be - 1 . 79 ev in ref . @ xcite . the qualitative comparison between data for the two surfaces and our result should be based on positions of cu atoms in the reconstruction ##s . in our simulation , positions of cu atoms are rather easily determined because the atomic structure of no is only a single layer . even with the simplest model , we can expect the nitrogen atom in the cu structure . from the present result , we get the following picture . if a cu atom has a configurational change owing to the chemical reaction with no , the nitrogen atom can move into the cu structure and form the local ncu @ xmath22 configuration . ( @ xmath23 or 5 . ) owing to the energy reduction coming from the large interaction energy of the local ncu @ xmath22 configuration , we can expect only the dissociative effect of no on no . in the local cu nano - structure ,there can happen large distortion of the configuration owing to finite temperatures and molecular local structure . therefore , our model , which is constructed using the atomic layer of cu , we have derived a hidden possible mechanism of the no dissociative adsorption on molecular surface . to estimate the reaction rate on the no reduction on cu - nm , we measured the local structure and the energy of a transition state using the nudged - elastic - band method . the initial configuration was the molecular local structure on cu - tl and the final configuration was the dissociative local structure obtained in [ ads - nm ] . the dissociation reaction was calculated by measuring the transition state with an equation @ xmath24 for the no reduction process . the activation energy for dissociation of no in the atomic layer was calculated using the next definition . @ xmath25 an upper bound of the transition state barrier is estimated to be 0 . 4 ev . in the transition state , the cu was adsorbed on cu - nm with the nitrogen atom bonded to the oxygen molecule . in the transition state , the oxygen atom made # ##ized connections with the cu atoms to increase the activation energy . to achieve this local structure in the transition state , the two different atomicboth were optimized , without any change in cu - bonding . utilizing the dft - gga model , we have shown that the molecular adsorption can happen on an atomic cu layer , which is the cubic structure of cu atoms ( cu - 111 ) . the reactivity of cu - tl against molecular adsorption of no was found to be confined to the cu ( 111 ) surface . some stable sites for no were found to have molecular stability . moreover , our optimization simulation revealed that there was a molecular - adsorbed structure of n and o atoms , which was much stronger at 0 . 08ev than the molecular adsorbed cu - tl structure . a further rate estimation revealed existence of a path with an energy difference of 1 . 4ev . thus , we may conclude the stability of no on the atomic cu layer . the negative dissociation potential appears due to formation of local n - cu and o - cu structures and creation of local o - cu @ xmath26 and o - cu @ xmath22 structures . we also considered an atomic fold - out structure ( ass ) of no , which caused an atomic - scale wrinkle in the cu - tl. . the absolute value of the molecular bond energy on the ass is lower than the value found for cu - like surfaces like cu - si . our study showed that there existed a complex adsorbed structure in which a nitrogen binding site embedded in a cubic structure was created . the absolute dissociation energy of no became - 0 . 5 ev on ass . flexibility against modification of this cu atomic structure on the nano - meter scale is decisive both to stabilize dissociative effects of no and to reduce the energy barrier of the co - reduction path . the activity of cu to reduce no should result in the atomically flexible cu networks . therefore , in order to study cu - based no @ xmath0 ##2 pathways , it is necessary to study atomic structures of no , _ i . e . _ atomic scale , atomic scale layers , and atomic scale chains , which undergo conformational change . this work was funded by the national science and technology project and supported by grants - in - aid for technical research and development projects ( no . 19051016 ) and a grants - in - aid for scientific research ( no . 22360049 ) . the computation was partly done using the computer software of issp , un##iv . of japan , and ri2 t , japan u . & satterfied u . 1996 _ heterogeneous systems in industrial practice _ , 2nd ed .
