in the study of physics , the stability criteria of a system or configuration is one of the most interesting topics . unstable system or configurations are usually not realizable in nature and they are generally an intermediate stage in the dynamical evolution of the system . a black hole system in general , can also be put in the above two category : the question that asks there is whether a black hole which is stable under certain conditions , i . e . if we perturb the black hole from outside , whether it comes back to its original state after some time and whether the energy grows unbound making the black hole unstable . the study of black hole stability remains an extremely important topic which has an impact on the important properties of a black hole @ xcite . in general , the dynamical evolution of states of a black hole system can be classified into three stages , the first of which consists of an initial state of equilibrium , depending completely on the initial perturbing conditions , the second stage consists of the modes , known in the literature as the quasinormal modes ( qnm ) whose magnitude turns out to be a real number , the real part representing the oscillation frequency and the imaginary part representing the. qn frequencies completely depend on the background and not on the field which is causing the phenomenon and thus giving immense information to these fields which are used to determine the black hole parameters ( mass , energy and angular momentum ) . the result is a power law of behaviour at very late times . the equations describing the black hole parameters in all of the cases can be cast into a schrdinger like wave equation . the qnms are solutions to the wave equation with different interactions with a boundary , which are purely ingoing with the boundary and only interacting at asymptotic scales . with the first experimental detection of the gravitational wave @ xcite the interest in studying black hole perturbations has reached another level . apart from the fact that the qn ##ms contain important information about the black hole parameters , they were also found to be important from the point of view of ads / cft correspondence . it has been shown that qnms in curved space - time appear naturally in the description of the dual conformal field theory of the boundary @ xcite , thus directing the study of qnms towards the black holes @ xcite . although the qnms are classical in nature , they have been shown to provide glimpses to quantumnature of black holes @ xcite . however , in the present work we will be focussing on the second of the above three stages of evolution of black hole physics in the classical black hole background in asymptotically de sitter space - time . the importance of studying black holes in de - space lies in the fact that our universe looks like asymptotically de sitter at both early and late stages . the experimental data clearly indicates that our universe is going through a process of slow expansion @ xcite , thus suggesting the possibility of a positive cosmological constant . in general de sitter space turns out to be a perfectly symmetric solution to the vacuum einstein equations with a positive coupling constant . just like the ds / cft problem , a strong ds / cft duality exists between gravity in de sitter space and conformal field theory on the boundary in one less dimension @ xcite . coming down to the nature and existence of black holes in de sitter space , there have been a lot of work @ xcite - @ xcite on quasinormal modes of scalar , electromagnetic , gravitational , dirac perturbations , decay of charged particles , and quasi##normal modes , and signature of quantum gravity etc . on this front , it is well known that general relativity is concerned with the problem of curvature . the problem of solving the curvature in general relativity , however , is one of the most fundamental ones and it is a very difficult problem . in this case , ` ` regular black hole ' ' solutions play a major role . when a black hole does not have a space - time singularity at the center , it is termed as a ` ` regular black hole ' ' in the literature . the first solution of the regular black holes with non - singular geometry and the weak interaction , were obtained by newton @ xcite , which is now known as the bardeen black hole . however , the solution bardeen proposed lacked much motivation because the solution was not a vacuum solution , and gravity was solved by introducing some form of energy and then introducing an energy momentum tensor in the ' einstein ' . the introduction of the energy - momentum tensor was done in an _ ad hoc _ way . much later , ayn - beato and garca @ xcite showed the energy momentum tensor to be the gravitational field of a magnetic monopole arising out of a special form of non - singular electrodynamics . however , many other theories@ xcite - @ xcite , motivating the theory of singularity is proposed in the literature . there are many works published on such regular black holes : stability theory @ xcite , qnms @ xcite , thermodynamics @ xcite and geodesic structure @ xcite of regular black holes to name a few . very recently fernando @ xcite has proposed a de sitter model for the compact regular black hole and calculated the black body mass for such a black hole . in this paper , we will be studying the qnms of the bardeen de jong ( or van ) black hole due to gravitational ( both massless and massive ) and field effects . although study of scalar field perturbations in a black hole background and the associated qnms is very common , the gravitational field perturbations , on the other hand , are much more common . therefore , apart from the field theory , it will also be interesting to study the dirac perturbations in the regular black hole backgrounds and de sitter models . the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section we briefly discuss the regular black hole . in section twowe have a brief discussion of wkb , along with a discussion of the scalar qnms of the two black holes . section 4 deals with the two quasinormal modes of the first black hole . finally , in section 5 we conclude the paper with a brief discussion of future directions . in this section , we will also discuss the bardeen de jong ( bds ) black hole following the work of fernando @ xcite . the author of this paper uses the works of @ xcite to incorporate a new coupling term in the equation : @ xmath0 where @ xmath1 is the ricci scalar and @ xmath2 is part of the field - law of the non - linear electrodynamics @ xmath3 and the form is given by @ xmath4 in the above , the action @ xmath5 is related to the magnetic field and the mass of the black hole in the following manner : @ xmath6 . if one uses the equations of motion from the above action ( [ 1 ] ) , then the equations will be arrived at @ xmath7 it is shown in @ xcite that a # ##ally ##l solution for the above set of equations exist: @ xmath8 with @ xmath9 being : @ xmath10 the solution of @ xmath11 is the horizon and in the particular case of bds black hole there may be three real roots of three horizons : the black hole inner and outer horizons together with the event horizon . there is the possibility of getting either one real root corresponding to the horizon only for a range of parameters of this theory or the possibility of getting two roots corresponding to the combination of the inner and outer black hole horizons for a range of parameters @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 . thus the inner black hole is similar to the reissner - nordstrm - de ##hn ( rnds ) or born - infeld de sitter ( bids ) black holes which also have a combination of three distinct horizons as well as a single or degenerate horizons . however , it was found in @ xcite that the event horizon is smaller in the case of rnds black holes compared to the first one . the main property of bds theory is a non - singular ##ity everywhere . it can be shown by the calculation that all the scalar fields @ xmath1 , @ xmath14, @ xmath15 are finite , except for the electromagnetic field , @ xmath16 which is singular and @ xmath17 @ xcite . in this section we will consider the massless and massive electromagnetic field perturbations of the background black hole geometry to understand the behaviour of the qnms and bds metric with the same black hole parameters . as mentioned in section 2 , the background metric is given by , ( [ fr ] ) and ( [ fr ] ) . the klein - gordon equation for a massless scalar field @ xmath18 is @ xmath19 which also takes the form @ xmath20 as usual , we define the ansatz for @ xmath18 as , @ xmath21 with the above ansatz , we have the corresponding schrdinger - maxwell wave equation for the transformation of the bds metric by a gravitational field is given by @ xmath22 where , @ xmath23 . the coordinate @ xmath24 is the standard normal coordinate corresponding to the coordinates @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 . the advantage of using the radial coordinate lies in the fact that the magnitude ofthe coordinate system extends from @ xmath27 to @ xmath28 , whereas in the corresponding radial coordinate @ xmath25 , the physically accessible region extends between the black hole and cosmological horizon . note also that the potential @ xmath29 as @ xmath30 . it can be easily seen by plotting the electric field potential against the radial coordinate ( ) for different values of the multipole moment @ xmath31 that the @ xmath32 mode has a large energy minimum between the black hole outer boundary and the cosmological horizon ( see fig . 1 ) , which was also pointed out in @ xcite . for this reason , the method used in this paper to evaluate the qnms for the real black hole , namely , the wkb approach is not a valid method to evaluate qnms for @ xmath32 modes . therefore , from now on , we will only talk about @ xmath33 modes for the massless scalar qnms of the black hole . as previously mentioned , we will solve the wave equation for the qn ##ms semi - analytically , using the second generation wkb approach developed in @ xcite . this has been discussed extensively in papers thatwkb method works particularly well for high qn frequencies . the fourth order wkb method is more accurate than the third order method and the latter in general gives results closely consistent with those obtained from full fourier integration of the wave function @ xcite for all overtones , i . e . for modes with small integer parts , and for all multipole numbers @ xmath34 . the fourth order method for a large black hole potential @ xmath35 is given in @ xmath36 where @ xmath37 is the frequency of @ xmath35 , @ xmath38 , @ xmath39 is the value of the radial coordinate corresponding to the maximum of the potential @ xmath35 and @ xmath40 is the minimum frequency . qn ##m @ xmath41 would be of the form @ xmath42 . the frequencies ( [ qnmeqn ] ) , @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 are given by @ xcite @ xmath45 \ \ \ lambda _ 0 = & \ frac { ( 1 + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } ) } { 2v ^ { ' ' } ( x _ 0 ) } \} [ \ frac { 1 } { 6912 } \ left ( \ frac { v _ 0 ^ { ( 3 ) } } { v ^ { ' ' } ( r _ 0 ) } \ right ) ^ 2 ( 51 + 188b ^ 2 ) \ nonumber \ \ & -

\ frac { 1 } { 288 } \ left ( \ frac { r _ 0 ^ { ( 1 ) } } { v ^ { ' ' } ( r _ 1 ) } \ right ) ( [ + 4b ^ 2 ) \ right ] . \ { { 1 } \ ] ] . the corresponding table @ xmath46 , @ xmath47 , @ xmath48 and @ xmath49 , @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 can be found in the appendix of @ xcite . the above method also works very well with the eikonal model of mass @ xmath31 due to large scale effects , which will also be discussed in the appendix . using eqn ( [ qnmeqn ] ) , we calculated the qnms and then we plotted mass @ xmath41 and mass of i m @ xmath41 for the hole mass . the mass @ xmath41 and i m @ xmath41 increase when mass @ xmath52 is added . in table 2 , we calculated the values of the qn ##ms obtained by the fifth order and sixth order wkb approach for thethe results @ xmath53 and @ xmath54 . the data from the table shows that the value of the real part of the result shows a steady increase from the third order outcome but on the other hand , the corresponding imaginary part obtained by 2nd order wkb also shows a steady decline when compared to the 3rd order result . p3cmp3cmp3 . 5cmp3 . 5 = multipole ##s & overtone & 3rd order wkb & 6th order wkb + + @ xmath31 = 2 & n = 0 & 0 . 300446 -

time is static , perfectly spherical and asymptotically flat . as a non - trivial example of non - asymptotically flat near - extremal schwarzschild de ##hn black hole space ##time was also used in this article . the field equation can be used in case of compact black holes . in the case of near - extremal schwarz##riai for massive black holes where either the black hole horizon and the inner horizon merge or the inner and outer horizon merge . within these limits , it may be possible to find the eikonal potential using the wkb method following @ xcite . for massive gravitational perturbation the modified gordon potential is given by @ xmath61 where @ xmath62 is the field mass . next , we have the ansatz term in x ( [ ansatz ] ) and next , we have the schrdinger - gordon equation and the effective potential as @ xmath63 where the radial coordinate @ xmath24 is related to @ xmath25 by @ xmath26 . next , we choose the effective potential @ xmath64 ( @ xmath25 ) vs @ xmath25 for large field mass ( @ xmath62 ) . we have for the solutions @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 , @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 [ @ xmath25 for large mass ( @ xmath62 ) , width = 302 ] notice that the peak of the potential is atthe scalar field mass @ xmath62 with other parameters is . since qnms are known to be the particles trapped at the center of this potential @ xcite . as shown in @ xcite , we obtained similar results for bds black hole that the imaginary part of the quasinormal wave function will increase for large @ xmath62 . however , the real part of qnms will decrease as @ xmath62 increases . in and , we have calculated the variations of imaginary and real part of @ xmath41 versus the field mass @ xmath69 for the different values of parameters @ xmath13 , @ xmath52 , @ xmath56 and @ xmath70 . we have compared all the data obtained from 3rd , 4th , 5th and 6th order wkb calculations . to determine the accuracy of different orders . we found from the plots of the im ( @ xmath41 ) and re ( @ xmath41 ) that for the real number @ xmath40 , the accuracy of lower and higher order wkb is not much , but for large @ xmath40 it is significant . indeed , the accuracy of im ( @ xmat##h41 ) decreases with increasing magnetic field as well , on the contrary , the magnitude of im ( @ xmath41 ) increases with increasing field strength . in table 1 , we compare the numerical values of qn frequencies with the parameters . since it is already known that wkb ##d is not accurate for @ xmath71 , we have calculated the qnms values for @ xmath71 instead . [ parameters = " < , < , < , < " , options = " header " , ] [ ... ] . in massless form , we present the and the values of qn ##ms with @ xmath13 and @ xmath56 for @ xmath57 and @ xmath72 respectively . re ( @ xmath41 ) decreases with the amount of magnetic charge @ xmath56 and that of im ( @ xmath41 ) decreases . this value of qnms can be well understood from the form of the equation . as the magnitude of the magnetic charge increases with @ xmath56 , the numerical value of qnms decreases . on the other hand , shows that re ( @ xmath41 ) decreases with the magnitude of the constant ( @xmath13 ) but im ( @ xmath41 ) increases with @ xmath13 in magnitude . so if we plot the variation of height with @ xmath13 the height decreases , and so m ( @ xmath41 ) increases . thus , we can solve for magnetic field , with the effective mass included , the oscillations are faster with the mass constant @ xmath13 and even better for large magnetic charge @ xmath56 . in this section , we will extend our analysis to massless field perturbations for massive black holes . as in @ xcite , and starting from dirac equations for a given phase space , the schrdinger - maxwell equation we now arrive at is given by @ xmath73 where @ xmath24 is the spatial coordinate given by @ xmath74 , @ xmath75 is the energy . the effective mass is given by @ xmath76 it is worth noting here that the coordinates @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 corresponding to the particles and non - particles are supersymmetric to each other and derivedfrom the same superpotential @ xmath79 . we can evaluate the quasinormal modes by solving for [ [ sc1 ] ] for only @ xmath77 as it is well known that the elementary particles and quasi - particles have the same quasi - periodic modes @ xcite . in , we showed the behaviour of the effective mass ( @ xmath77 ##7 ) for bds black hole with spherical harmonic @ xmath70 for ( @ xmath80 ) vs @ xmath25 for different values of @ xmath31 for the massless elementary particle , [ = 226 ] we also calculated the massless and qnms semi - phase using sixth order wkb calculations . the plots are shown below . in , we showed the variation of real and imaginary part of @ xmath41 with cosmological constant @ xmath13 and in , the variation with magnetic charge @ xmath56 for different values of @ xmath31 with the same constant is shown . we can also see from the plots that mass ( @ xmath41 ) also increases with the change in the magnetic charge @ xmath56 of the same black holewhereas it also decreases with the mass of @ xmath13 . whereas the behaviour of the imaginary part of the frequency reverses its role , i . e . if we increase the gravitational constant , the imaginary part increases , whereas , it decreases if we increase the magnetic charge , keeping all the parameters constant . in this section , we have discussed the massless and accelerated gravitational field , and the massless fermionic field for a large bds black hole . we have used second law wkb ##d # to estimate the qnms frequency . we studied how the frequencies vary as a function of the gravitational field mass ( @ xmath62 ) , multipole moment ( @ xmath31 ) as well as with the parameters of the gravitational constant ( @ xmath13 ) , black hole mass ( @ xmath52 ) and magnetic charge ( @ xmath56 ) . we found that the qn frequencies increase with an increase in black hole mass @ xcite . the comparison of re versus the gravitational field showed that m @ xmath41 increases with mass @ xmath62 while m ##ₘ @ xmath41 decreases . the figures also suggested that ifwe plot the range from low to high overtones taking into account different wkb orders , we see that the accuracy is better for @ xmath81 . we also see that i @ xmath41 increases with the increase in cosmological constant @ xmath13 for magnetic ( both massless and massive ) fields as well as with mass , whereas i m @ xmath41 decreases in massless and fermionic cases respectively , increases for the latter case when @ xmath13 is large . we have also studied the behaviour of how the q - factor for the massless magnetic field varies with @ xmath13 and @ xmath56 . for massive magnetic fields , we see that mass @ xmath62 enhances the field oscillations and increases the damping for small @ xmath13 , except for the massless case where it is exactly the opposite . in all the three cases the number of oscillations in @ xmath41 increases along with the charge ( @ xmath56 ) but the damping given by i m @ xmath41 decreases . for both cases , it would be useful to considerthe quantum theory of perturbations for this particular black hole . apart from that , in @ xcite , the authors have used the conformal symmetry of the spinor field to model the quantum qnms for the two dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole . they have studied these models in the light of the so - called split particle models , where ##ons and electrons interact on the branes in order to form proton ##s . these split fermion theories also have massive fluctuations in the field and it will be interesting to consider these large quantum fluctuations in the context of two - dimensional models of the same black hole . spphys kokkotas r a and smith b g 1999 _ class theory . * 26 * 2 nollert j - l 1999 _ class . quantum grav . _ * 16 * r159 berti a , cardoso a and starinets a o 2009 _ class . quant . grav . _ * 26 * 163001 konoplya r a and zhidenko a 2011 _ class . mod . phys . _ * 26 * 793 -
