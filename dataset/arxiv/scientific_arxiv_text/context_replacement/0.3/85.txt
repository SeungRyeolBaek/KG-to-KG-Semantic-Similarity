a smooth flow in a particular direction on a smooth manifold depends on a smooth map an interval exchange transformation . behavior of such flows has been extensively studied during these last few years providing applications to convex and convex geometry , to measured flows on surfaces , to teichmller geometry and topology , etc . interval exchange transformations are closely related to abelian differentials on riemann surfaces . it is well known that the continued fraction encode cutting points of elliptic curves in the poincar ##t * - plane . moreover , the rauzy - veech algorithm ( related to euclidean algorithm ) provides a discrete model for the teichmller geodesics flow ( @ xcite ) . using this , h . masur in @ xcite and m . a . veech in @ xcite have independently proved the keane s conjecture ( the existence of almost all interval exchange transformations ) . using combinatorics of rauzy induction , kontsevich and zorich classified the connected components of some of the tangent spaces of abelian groups @ xcite . more recently , avila , gouzel and yoccoz studied the exponential decay of f for the teichmller geodes##ic flow also uses the renormalization of the rauzy - veech induction ( see @ xcite ) . avila and viana used combinatorics of rauzy - veech induction to prove the simplicity of the essential ##s of the lyapunov construction of the teichmller translation flow on the basis of abelian differentials ( see @ xcite ) . also bufetov and gurevich proved the existence and existence of the problem of weak mixing for the teichmller geodesic flow on the basis space of abelian differentials @ xcite . avila and forni proved the weak mixing for almost all interval exchange transformations and translation flows @ xcite . these results show that rauzy - veech induction which was later elaborated to the existence of interval exchange transformations and ergodicity of the teichmller geodesic flow is , actually , very efficient far beyond these initial conditions . however , all the above results consider only the basis spaces of abelian differential . the corresponding questions for solutions of the quadratic equations ( i . e . of those , which are not the squares of abelian differential ) remain open . note that the ( co ) tangent .to the total space of strata is naturally identified with the total space of _ _ _ _ . from this point of view , the strata of abelian varieties are the orbifolds of high codimension in the total space of the tangent bundle . our interest in teichmller elliptic and properties of the strata of strict elliptic differentials is one of the main motivations for the rauzy - veech induction for elliptic differentials . further generalizations of linear linear transformations were introduced by danthony and nogueira in @ xcite ( see also @ xcite ) for cross sections of linear foliations on surfaces . they introduced the notion of linear maps , as well as the notion of rauzy induction for these maps . in lyapunov extensions of the teichmller elliptic ##s kontsevich and zorich have performed series of experimental experiments with linear involutions corresponding to quadratic differentials @ xcite . these experiments indicated appearance of attractors for the rauzy - veech induction , as well as examples of generalized functions such that the resulting linear involutions are minimal for the case of functions of finite measure , and non minimalfor a given value of is also of positive order ( examples of this case are given in figure [ rauzy : 1 : 2ii ] and figure [ 1 : rauzy : 1 ] , appendix @ xmath2 ) . but at this time , there is no combinatorial basis . therefore , in order to generalize technique of rauzy - veech induction to quadratic differentials in a useful way it was necessary to establish corresponding criteria allowing to distinguish the domains , which correspond to attractors and those of , which are cross sections of the theory of quadratic differentials . it was also necessary to identify those generalized permutation which give rise to minimal linear involution , and to identify the domains of appropriate parameters . in this paper we established the corresponding criteria , which enable us to apply technique of rauzy - veech induction for elliptic differential . the results in this direction were obtained by the same method in @ xcite . we also study relations between combinatorics , topology and theory of linear involutions . to compare similarities and differences between linear equations corresponding to abelian and to elliptic differentials let us first briefly describe the situation in the followingtheorem . an interval exchange transformation is given by a combinatorial function ( permutation @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 elements ) and by a linear function ( composition @ xmath5 of the intervals ) . recall that the keane ##n criterion ( see below ) is the criterion of ` ` always ' ' ( which , in turn , implies minimality ) of an interval exchange transformation . this criterion is satisfied for almost all elements @ xmath6 when the permutation @ xmath3 is irrational ( i . e . @ xmath7 , and when @ xmath3 is irrational , the corresponding interval exchange transformation is _ never _ ) . on the other hand the irrational interval exchange transformations are just those that arise as cross products of minimal continuous flows on well defined transverse intervals . the rauzy - veech induction consists in applying the first return map of the interval exchange transformation to an even smaller interval . this induction can be viewed as a linear transformation on a finite - dimensional space of interval exchange maps . the behavior of an orbit of the induction provides important information on dynamics of the interval exchange transformation on the starting set . this information is especially useful when all parameters are well defined and whenthe length of the underlying subintervals tends to infinity . an interval exchange transformation satisfying the latter conditions is said to have _ property _ . for a finite irreducible set @ xmath3 , the subset of sets @ xmath6 which give rise to interval exchange transformations with keane s property contains no irrational parameters , and so it is a finite lebesgue measure subset . similarly , for the set of interval exchange transformations with irreducible _ properties , the above exchange transformation is recurrent with respect to the lebesgue measure ( and is ergodic by a theorem of veech ) . note that the corresponding invariant measure has infinite invariant mass . in this paper we let the definition of _ linear ##ity _ be the inverse of @ xmath8 given by @ xmath9 . a linear involution is a transformation @ xmath10 , from @ xmath8 into itself , of the form @ xmath11 , where @ xmath12 is an involution of @ xmath8 without a limit , continuous only in infinitely many points , and which is the lebesgue measure . in this paper we may also considerlinear involutions with the same property . the intersection of @ xmath12 at @ xmath13 at @ xmath14 if @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 belong to the same connected component , and @ xmath13 otherwise ; see the convention [ convention : 1 ] . ] proposed by danthony and nogueira ( with @ xcite ) . as usual , a _ linear map _ is encoded by a combinatorial data ( ` ` generalized permutation ' ' ) and a continuous function . a generalized permutation of at @ xmath16 ( with @ xmath17 ) is a two - to - one mapping @ xmath18 to an integer @ xmath19 . a generalized polynomial is called _ irreducible _ if there exists a linear map associated to this generalized permutation , which is the appropriate inner product of the vertical foliation of the quadratic differential . a generalized permutation is called _ - irreducible _ if there exists a _ linear map associated to this generalized polynomial . it is easy to see that a _ generalized polynomial is _ ir##reducible ; the converse is not true in general as we will see . locally and dynamically equivalent generalized permutations can be characterized by different criteria or in simple combinatorial terms . the corresponding definitions are given in definition [ def : irred ] and definition [ def : dyn : irr ] respectively . consider a dynamically equivalent generalized permutation @ xmath3 . the parameter space of the linear involutions associated to @ xmath3 is represented by a hyperplane section of the manifold . we have an explicit definition which assigns to the generalized permutation @ xmath3 an open subset of the parameter space defined by the system of linear inequalities determined by @ xmath3 . this subset is called the set of _ _ parameters _ . when @ xmath3 is global , the set of _ parameters coincides with the parameter space ; in general it is smaller . the explicit definition gives a more precise statement than for @ xmath2 in the dynamically equivalent case . @ xmath20 1 . if @ xmath3 is not locally irreducible , then if @ xmath3 is dynamicallyirreducible , but @ xmath6 does not belong to the set of minimal parameters , the linear involution @ xmath21 is not minimal . if @ xmath3 is dynamically irreducible , then for almost all minimal parameters @ xmath6 the linear combination @ xmath21 has the keane s property , and t is minimal . since the rauzy - veech induction agrees with t , it projectivizes to a sequence @ xmath22 on the set of normalized linear combinations ; we shall call this sequence the _ _ rauzy - veech induction _ . let t be a linear involution on the unit interval and let us define the sequence @ xmath23 of t by the renormalized rauzy - veech induction @ xmath22 . theorem . if @ xmath10 has the keane s property , then there exists @ xmath24 such that @ xmath25 is minimal for all @ xmath26 . the renormalized rauzy - veech induction , given by the sequence @ xmath27 , is rec##urrent . for a generalized permutation @ xmath3 we can consider one or two other generalized operations @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 as the possibilities for the proof of the rauzy - veech induction @ xmath30 . these two rauzy operations induce a partial order on the class of generalized permutations represented by an oriented graph . rauzy class _ is the connected component of this order . note that geometry of the rauzy classes is somewhat different and more complicated than in the case of ` ` true ' ' permutations since for some irreducible generalized permutations some of the rauzy operations may be not defined . from theorem @ xmath31 we can deduce that a rauzy class is an equivalence class for the equivalence classes induced by these combinatorial operations ( see proposition [ 1 : classes ] ) . in analogy with the case of the ` ` true ' ' operation , we define one more equivalence operation for generalized operations and define _ _ rauzy classes _ as minimal classes of the generalized permutations invariant under these corresponding three operations . the moduli spaces of abelian groupsand of quadratic differential are given by multiplicities of the zeroes of the generalized strata . we denote the stratum of the moduli space of a quadratic differential ( with the most simple poles ) by @ xmath32 , where @ xmath33 denotes the multiplicities of the zeroes ( @ xmath34 corresponds to a pole ) . extended rauzy classes of the generalized strata are in one - to - one correspondence with connected components of strata of the moduli space of the differentials . indeed , extended rauzy classes where serve to prove the non - existence of the category of abelian groups . for groups of a small number of elements , it is possible to construct from the subset of generalized strata and then use the rauzy operations to decompose it into a disjoint union of extended rauzy classes . using this , veech proved that the minimal strata in genus @ xmath35 has two connected components and arnoux proved that the minimal stratum in genus @ xmath36 has three connected components ( for abelian groups ) . they proved the extensioncombinatorial proof of irreducibility of a finite permutation ( namely theorem @ xmath2 ) one can apply theorem @ xmath37 to all the connected components of all strata of quadratic differentials of sufficiently small degree . this justifies , in particular , the first experimental result of zorich . each of the remaining four exceptional strata of these differentials @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 contains exactly two connected components . note that a theorem of the second theorem @ xcite classifies all connected components of all exceptional strata of meromorphic quadratic differentials with at most two components . these strata are either disconnected , or contain exactly two connected components one of which is hyperelliptic . the same theorem @ xcite shows that each of the remaining four exceptional strata might contain at most two connected components . however , the only currently available proof of the fact they are disconnected is the one based on the calculation of the corresponding rauzy classes and corresponds to the theorem of zorich . it would be interesting to have an arithmetic - geometrico proof of the above theorem ; with a similar invariant as in the kontsevich - zorich s theorem @ xcite . note also that a theorem of zorich @xcite provides explicits of elements for the corresponding rauzy classes . see also @ xcite for programs and classes of these rauzy classes . in section [ sec : iem ] we recall the properties of algebraic groups , moduli spaces and their generating functions . in particular we recall the rauzy - veech induction and its basic properties . we apply these properties to irreducibility . + in section [ sec : giem ] we use the definition of the linear involution and its basics properties . then in section [ combinatoric ] we define a general proof of irreducibility , and prove the first part of theorem @ xmath2 . the main tool we use to prove this theorem is the one given by marmi , moussa and yoccoz which appears in @ xcite + in section [ sec : dyn ] we use the keane s property for the linear group and prove the second part of theorem @ xmath2 , that is theorem @ xmath40 . for that we say that @ xmath10 has the keane s property if and only if the rauzy - veech induction is always well defined and the order of equal to .. then if @ xmath10 does not satisfy the keane conjecture , we say that there exists @ xmath24 and that @ xmath41 is locally reducible which also implies that @ xmath10 is not locally invariant . + in section [ dyn : rauzy : veech ] , we study the action of the extended rauzy - veech map on the space of the linear involutions , and the theorem @ xmath31 . for that we use the teichmller geometry and the definition of the volume of the map given by masur and veech ( see @ xcite ) . + section [ rauzy : s : giem ] is devoted to a proof of theorem @ xmath37 on the rauzy classes ; we give a result of zorich based on an explicit calculation of these classes for low genera . + in the section we present the explicit rauzy classes as illustration of the properties which appear in the general case . we also give a result on the extended rauzy classes . we thank anton zorich for useful information . we thank arnaldo nogueira for comments and information on a complete proof of this result .+ this paper is partially supported by the anr ` ` teichmller projet blanc ' ' anr - 06 - blan - 0038 . in this paper we discuss general topics concerning flat surfaces , metric spaces and interval function theory . for general purposes we use @ xcite and @ xcite . in this paper we will also use notations used in the article @ xcite , or equivalently @ xcite . a _ _ surface _ is a ( smooth , compact , connected ) genus @ xmath42 surface equipped with a flat surface ( with all conical curves ) such that the holonomy group belongs to @ xmath43 . the holonomy means that the smooth transport of a vector along a long line takes the vector either to itself or to the origin . this implies that all the angles are integer powers of @ xmath3 . equivalently a flat surface is a triple @ xmath44 such that @ xmath45 is a topological compact flat surface , @ xmath46 is a finite subset of @ xmath45 ( whose elements are conical _ curves _ ) and @ xmath47 is an element of @ xmath48 such that the transition maps @ xmath##49 are translations or half - turns : @ xmath50 , and for each @ xmath51 , there is a neighborhood of @ xmath52 isometric to the translation cone . thus we define the _ _ differential _ form by and the coordinates @ xmath53 by the coordinates @ xmath54 . this form corresponds to the points of @ xmath46 to translations , not points or fixed points ( see @ xcite ) . we will sometimes use the notation @ xmath55 or simply @ xmath45 . observe that the holonomy is trivial if and only if there exists a half - turn such that all the points are translations or equivalently if the global differential @ xmath56 is the global differential of an abelian group . we will then show that @ xmath45 is a translation cone . for @ xmath57 , we define the moduli space of abelian groups @ xmath58 as the set of pairs @ xmath59 modulo the equivalence relation generated by : @ xmath60 if there exists an induced isomorphism @ xmath61 such that @ xmath62 . + for @ xmath63 ,we will define the vector space of quadratic functions @ xmath64 as the moduli space of functions @ xmath65 ( where @ xmath56 is not the inverse square of an abelian differential ) modulo the equivalence relation generated by : @ xmath66 if there exists an algebraic curve @ xmath61 such that @ xmath67 . the moduli space of abelian differential ( respectively elliptic differentials ) is defined by the order of the curve . we will denote by @ xmath68 ( or @ xmath69 ) the vector space of holomorphic one - forms ( respectively elliptic functions ) with @ xmath70 poles ( or poles ) of multiplicities @ xmath71 . these poles are non - zero in general ( for a general definition see @ xcite in the abelian differential case and @ xcite in the rational function case ) . the group action of the @ xmath72 - th group of diagonal matrices @ xmath73 on the flat line has a special interest . it is a measure - preserving flow with respect to athe flow @ xmath74 , preserving each stratum of area one algebraic differential . this flow is known as the _ teichmller _ flow _ . masur and veech proved the following theorem . the teichmller geodesic flow depends ergodically on each linear component of each one of the analytic spaces of area one abelian and elliptic varieties ( with respect to the total measure in the lebesgue measure ) . this theorem was proved by masur @ xcite and veech @ xcite for the @ xmath68 case and for the @ xmath75 case . + the theorem of the teichmller geodesic flow was proved in full generality in @ xcite , and @ xmath76 . the finiteness of the measure appears in the @ xmath77 preprints of veech : linear systems on analytic spaces of finite dimension i , ii ( see also @ xcite p . 445 ) . these preprints have been published in @ xmath78 @ xcite . in this section we talk about the theory of interval continuous functions . we will show that , .simple combinatorial ##ly , such transformations exist such as poincar ##t ##m of open intervals and geodesic projections on translation lines . here we will discuss the rauzy - veech induction and its geometric and topological applications ( see @ xcite for more details ) . let @ xmath79 be an open interval and let us consider a finite subset @ xmath80 of @ xmath81 . its closure is the union of @ xmath82 - subintervals . an infinite order function is a one - to - one map @ xmath10 from @ xmath83 to a non - empty subset of @ xmath81 that is a function on each subinterval of the definition domain . it is easy to see that @ xmath10 is uniquely determined by the following data : a function @ xmath84 that describes how the intervals are ordered ( such that the i - th interval , when numerated from the left to the right , is mapped by @ xmath10 to the set @ xmath85 ) , and a function with a norm that encodes the order of the intervals . ( marmi , mo##ussa , yoccoz @ xcite , we denote these intervals by @ xmath86 , with @ xmath19 a regular alphabet . the length of the intervals is a pair @ xmath87 , and the input data is a pair @ xmath88 of one - to - one maps @ xmath89 . then @ xmath84 is a one - to - one map from @ xmath90 into itself , by @ xmath91 . we will then denote such a pair by a sequence : @ xmath92 [ 0 : 1 ] let us identify the smallest pair @ xmath93 with @ xmath94 . then we define a pair @ xmath3 as follows . @ xmath95 in this section we introduce the concepts of winner and loser , using the terminology of the university of avila , gouzel and yoccoz @ xcite . for @ xmath21 we denote the _ type _ @ xmath96 of @ xmath10 by @ xmath97 . we will then assume that @ xmath98 is the winner and @ xmat##h99 is the constant . then we define a subinterval @ xmath100 of @ xmath81 , taking the value of @ xmath81 as well . @ xmath101 the rauzy - veech map @ xmath102 of @ xmath10 is defined as the new return data of @ xmath10 to the subinterval @ xmath100 . it is easy to see that this is just an interval - map , defined by @ xmath4 . ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . we then decide how to define the data of the new map . there are two ways to define depending on whether @ xmath10 is of type @ xmath103 or @ xmath72 ; the return data of @ xmath30 only depends on @ xmath3 and not the type of @ xmath10 . this produces two types @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 of @ xmath106 , with @ xmath96 the type of @ xmath10 . 1 . @ xmath10 has type @ xmath103 ;equivalently the winner is @ xmath107 . + in that case , we define @ xmath108 by @ xmath109 where @ xmath110 . in an equivalent way @ xmath111 . then @ xmath112 where @ xmath113 and @ xmath114 we have @ xmath115 if @ xmath116 and @ xmath117 . + . @ xmath10 ##8 = @ xmath72 ; equivalently the winner is @ xmath118 . + in that case , we define @ xmath108 by @ xmath119 where @ xmath120 . in an equivalent way @ xmath121 . then @ xmath122 where @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 we have @ xmath115 if @ xmath125 and @ xmath126 . let @ xmath93 be an example . let us consider the type @ xmath3 of type [ 1 : 1 ] . for @ xmath127 we have that the rauzy - veechthis is well defined if and only if the two resulting elements do not have the same signature i . e . @ xmath128 . in the following , we want to define the rauzy - veech induction on a linear system defined on the space of interval exchange transformations . thus we want the properties of the rauzy - veech induction on @ xmath10 to be very well defined . we also want this induction to be a good renormalization group , in the sense that the iterates correspond to operations on subintervals that sum to zero . this leads to the notion of reducibility and to the keane s property . we will say that @ xmath88 is reducible if there exists @ xmath129 and that @ xmath130 is invariant to @ xmath91 . this implies also that @ xmath10 splits into two interval exchange transformations . we will say that @ xmath10 satisfies the keane s property ( also called the infinite # ##ness condition or o . d . s . s . condition ) , if the values of the singularities of @ xmath131 by @ xmath10 are unique .this implies that @ xmath3 is unique and the results of the rauzy - veech induction are always well defined . if the @ xmath132 are rationally independent intervals , that is @ xmath133 for all nonzero integer and @ xmath134 , then @ xmath10 has the keane s property ( see @ xcite ) . but the converse is not true . note that if @ xmath10 has the keane s property then @ xmath10 is unique . let @ xmath21 be an integer generating function . let us denote by @ xmath135 the length of the interval associated to the intervals @ xmath136 for the @ xmath70 - th powers of @ xmath10 and @ xmath137 ; we denote @ xmath138 if it is well defined . the following are equivalent . 1 . @ xmath10 satisfies the keane s property . the rauzy - veech induction @ xmath137 is always well - defined and for every @ xmath136 , the length of the interval @ xmath139 associated tozero as @ xmath70 tends to infinity . now we will see this result is very similar in the case of linear systems . if we want to study the rauzy - veech induction of a linear system on the set of interval linear maps , it is useful to consider the rauzy - veech renormalisation on the projective space of lengths parameters space . the first such object is the following rauzy - veech induction defined on exactly one interval : @ xmath140 given a graph @ xmath3 , we can identify two consecutive permutations @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 . therefore , any permutation @ xmath143 has exactly two predecessors : there are exactly two graphs @ xmath144 and @ xmath145 such that @ xmath146 . note that @ xmath3 is directed if and only if @ xmath141 is directed . thus the relation given by @ xmath147 is a partial order on the set of consecutive permutations ; we define it as a directed graph @ xmath148 . we canrauzy classes the connected components of this graph . the equivalence class is an equivalence relation on the set of vertices . in particular , the equivalent class of a permutation is the rauzy class . the key argument is the following : if @ xmath149 then there exists @ xmath150 such that @ xmath151 . we assume there exists an oriented path in @ xmath148 between @ xmath3 and @ xmath152 , _ i . e . _ there exist @ xmath153 such that @ xmath154 . then there exists @ xmath155 such that @ xmath156 . iterating this result , there exists @ xmath157 such that @ xmath158 . thus there exists an oriented path in @ xmath148 that connects @ xmath152 and @ xmath3 . we can see that there is an analogous result in the theory of directed graphs although the situation is much more complicated . here we consider the action of the _ map _ over the _ flat map @ xmath10 , that is the _ map for which @ xmath10 is thefirst return control of the vertical flow of a well defined vector . let @ xmath21 be an instance of vector . a _ for a _ for @ xmath10 is a set of vectors @ xmath159 such that : 1 . 2 . @ xmath161 . 3 . @ xmath162 . as a subset of @ xmath163 , we consider the broken line @ xmath164 and @ xmath165 defined by multiplication of the vectors @ xmath166 ( in this order ) for @ xmath167 with starting point at the origin ( see image [ fig : suspension : iet ] ) . similarly , we consider the broken line @ xmath168 defined by multiplication of the vectors @ xmath169 ( in this order ) for @ xmath167 with starting point at the origin . if the vectors @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 have no origin other than the endpoints , then we can construct a flat vector @ xmath45 as follows : we can replace the vector @ xmath170 on @ xmath164 with the vector @ xmath##170 define @ xmath168 by binary translation ( in the latter case , we can use the veech zippered string method , see section [ subsec : 1 ] ) . let @ xmath171 be the general interval defined by @ xmath172 . then the interval data for @ xmath10 is precisely the interval defined by the corresponding exchange map to @ xmath81 of the data stored on @ xmath45 . [ ] [ ] @ xmath173 [ ] [ ] @ xmath174 [ ] [ ] @ xmath175 [ ] [ ] @ xmath176 we have not yet proved the existence of such a suspension data for the general interval exchange map . the necessary condition for @ xmath10 to have suspension data is that @ xmath3 is positive . however , if we define @ xmath177 such that @ xmath178 , and let @ xmath179 be a sequence of complex numbers , then : @ xmath180 . the imaginary part of this number can not be both positive and negative , and @ xmath163 is not the suspension data for @xmath10 . if @ xmath3 is irreducible , the existence of the suspension data was proved by masur and veech independently ( see @ xcite page 174 and @ xcite formula @ xmath181 page 207 ) . we present the proof here . first , let us remark that @ xmath88 is continuous if and only if @ xmath182 of . if @ xmath3 is continuous , then so is @ xmath183 , therefore @ xmath184 let us define the collection of suspension numbers @ xmath179 as follows : @ xmath185 the following and , the collection @ xmath186 is the suspension data over @ xmath10 . here we have an alternative definition of the suspension as an interval exchange map that holds for _ any _ suspension data , using the so called s - theorem due to veech @ xcite . let @ xmath21 be an interval exchange map , and let us assume that @ xmath3 is continuous . let @ xmath163 be any suspension over @ xmath10 . then we define @ xmath187 .@ xmath188 for example @ xmath189 let us consider a rectangle @ xmath190 of width @ xmath191 and of length @ xmath192 based on @ xmath193 . the resulting surface itself is the original surface @ xmath194 where @ xmath195 has the following equivalence relation : we denote the top and the bottom of these spaces by @ xmath196 for @ xmath197 . then we ` ` define ' ' the vertical dimensions of these spaces that are equivalent ( see figure [ fig : 1 : iet ] ; see also @ xcite for a more detailed description ) .

[ def : * ] in this paper , we are dealing with _ _ measured functions defined on _ _ _ surfaces . note that the orientability of the surface @ xmath45 is the only constraint on the derivative of @ xmath##10 . definition [ def : giem ] . the previous definition is motivated by the following remark . the first return map of the vertical segment foliation on the vertical segment @ xmath242 in a flat neighborhood @ xmath45 defines a linear involution in the following way . take a positive vertical segment in a neighborhood of @ xmath242 , and replace @ xmath242 with two copies of @ xmath242 shown in figure [ ttilde ] . we denote by @ xmath266 the one on the top and by @ xmath267 the one on the bottom . then we consider the first return map on @ xmath8 of vertical geodesics , where a map starting from @ xmath266 is taken in the positive vertical direction , and a one starting from @ xmath268 is taken in the negative direction . we consider a map @ xmath258 and it is easy to see that @ xmath258 meets the condition of definition [ def : giem ] . then it is clear that the map @ xmath269 of the successive intersections of the vertical segment with@ xmath242 . recall that the following relations are encoded in combinatorial and metric data : these are a vector and a vector with positive rank . we define an equivalence relation for linear involutions . [ def2 ] let @ xmath270 be an alphabet of @ xmath4 strings . a _ generalized permutation _ of type @ xmath16 , with @ xmath271 , defines a two - to - one alphabet @ xmath272 . we can then define such a alphabet in the table : @ xmath273 a generalized permutation @ xmath274 defines an alphabet @ xmath275 without fixed points by the following way @ xmath276 note that a vector is in a natural way a generalized vector . we can see how a linear transformation operator defines a generalized vector . let @ xmath10 be the linear involution and let @ xmath258 be the linear involution as in definition [ def : giem ] . the result of addition of @ xmath258 is a _ union @ xmath277of these sets , where @ xmath278 are subintervals of @ xmath266 and @ xmath279 are subintervals of @ xmath268 . since @ xmath258 is an ordinary map without fixed point , each @ xmath249 is mapped isometrically to a @ xmath280 , with @ xmath281 , and @ xmath258 induces an operation without fixed point @ xmath282 and @ xmath283 . as in figure [ ex : iem ] , we assign the sequence @ xmath284 to each a @ xmath285 and we define a generalized map in the form of the following , which is defined similarly to a one - to - one map of @ xmath19 . [ example1 ] in view of figure [ ex : giem ] , let us identify the two pairs @ xmath93 with @ xmath286 . then we define a generalized map @ xmath3 as follows . @ xmath287 in an analogous way , we can define an involu##tion without additional parameters in order to represent @ xmath3 . @ xmath288 we represent @ xmath274 in the following : @ xmath289 one can see that the generalized operator associated to the linear combination shown in figure [ 2 : giem ] is the generalized operator @ xmath3 . note that @ xmath3 performs a ` ` true ' ' operation on @ xmath4 letters if and only if @ xmath290 and for all @ xmath291 , @ xmath292 . in this example ( if @ xmath293 ) : @ xmath294 letters , let @ xmath274 be a generalized permutation of type @ xmath16 and let @ xmath275 be the linear combination . if @ xmath274 is not a ` ` true ' ' permutation , then an absolutely necessary and sufficient condition for @ xmath274 to arise from a linear combination is that there exist at least two letters @ xmath295 and @ xmath296 such that @ xmath297 and @xmath298 . [ conv : p ] from here , unless explicitly specified ( in particular in section [ suff : cond ] ) , we will simply assume that generalized functions must satisfy the following convention . there are at least two values @ xmath295 and @ xmath296 such that @ xmath297 and @ xmath298 . let @ xmath299 be a collection of positive real numbers such that @ xmath300 it is possible to define a linear function on the data @ xmath301 with the data @ xmath302 . as in section [ ref : iem ] , we will denote by @ xmath303 a linear involution . we use the _ rauzy - veech induction _ on linear functions given by danthony and nogueira ( see @ xcite 1 . 473 ) . let @ xmath303 be a linear function of @ xmath301 , with @ xmath274 of type @ xmath16 . if @ xmath304 , then the rauzy - veech induction @xmath102 of @ xmath10 is the linear involution map from the first return value of @ xmath10 to @ xmath305 as in the case of the exchange operations , the combinatorial data of the second linear relation depends only on the input data of @ xmath10 and whether @ xmath306 or @ xmath307 . as before , we assume that @ xmath10 has type @ xmath103 and type @ xmath72 respectively . the two output data are given by @ xmath308 for @ xmath142 respectively . note that if @ xmath274 is a linear transfer function , the values @ xmath309 and @ xmath310 can be empty because @ xmath311 and because of the linear relation on the @ xmath312 that must be satisfied . we can use the two rauzy operations @ xmath313 . let @ xmath275 map the associated value to @ xmath274 . + . map @ xmath314 . + @xmath315 if @ xmath316 and if @ xmath317 then we define @ xmath318 to be of type @ xmath16 and such that : @ xmath319 @ xmath315 if @ xmath320 , and if there exists a pair @ xmath321 included in @ xmath322 then we define @ xmath323 to be of type @ xmath324 and such that : @ xmath325 @ xmath315 if @ xmath326 is not defined . . + @ xmath315 if @ xmath328 and if @ xmath317 then we define @ xmath329 to be of type @ xmath16 such that : @ xmath330 @ xmath315 if @ xmath331 and if there exists a pair @ xmath321 included in @ xmath332 then @ xmath329 is of type @ xmath333 and : @ xmath334 @ xmath315 otherwise @ xmath335 is not defined . we also define therauzy - veech defined @ xmath30 of @ xmath10 : * if @ xmath303 has type @ xmath103 , then @ xmath336 , with @ xmath337 if @ xmath338 and @ xmath339 . * if @ xmath303 has type @ xmath72 , then @ xmath340 , with @ xmath337 if @ xmath341 and @ xmath342 . let us consider the example of example [ example1 ] , namely @ xmath343 . then @ xmath344 [ ex2 ] let us consider the example @ xmath274 . for the example @ xmath345 if @ xmath346 . then @ xmath347 and @ xmath348 are also defined . finally , consider the other example with @ xmath274 as a proof . then we necessarily have @ xmath349 . we necessarily have @ xmath350 and @ xmath351 to exist . [ ex3 ] consider the per@ xmath274 defined for the basis @ xmath352 = @ xmath353 . then @ xmath354 is not defined for any @ xmath96 . however , for any linear combination with @ xmath274 as combinatorial data . then we must have @ xmath355 , because the rauzy - veech induction of @ xmath10 is not defined for any basis . in the case of generalized linear maps , we can define the rauzy - veech induction of for irreducible linear data . hence we have not yet defined irreducibility . however , it will appear in the [ combinatoric ] that some important phenomena with respect to rauzy - veech induction appear only in the special case . in the next section we can give a definition of irreducibility which is sufficient to have a definition of . it is easy to see that a generalized basis @ xmath274 such that neither @ xmath356 nor @ xmath348 is defined is not reducible . however , the permutation @ xmath274 of the [ ex2 ] is irred##ucible ( see definition [ def : irred ] and definition [ cns ] ) while @ xmath348 is not true . starting from a linear involution @ xmath10 , we want to construct a flat line and a line segment whose corresponding constant return maps @ xmath357 of the segment to give @ xmath10 . this segment will be called a _ suspension _ over @ xmath10 , and the parameters for this construction will be called _ suspension data _ . let @ xmath10 be a linear combination and let @ xmath358 be the sum of the two parameters . let @ xmath359 be a collection of complex numbers such that : 1 . 2 . @ xmath361 3 . @ xmath362 4 . @ xmath363 . the collection @ xmath364 is called a _ suspension data _ over @ xmath10 . we can also speak of an obvious way of _ suspension data for a linear permutation . let @ xmath164 be a straight line ( with a finite number of points ) on the plane such that the edge of @ xmath365 is marked bythe complex number @ xmath366 , for @ xmath367 , and @ xmath168 represents a broken line that intersects on the same point as @ xmath164 , and whose edge at @ xmath368 is represented by the complex number @ xmath369 for @ xmath370 ( see [ figure : suspension : suspension ] ) . if @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 both intersect on their endpoints , then @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 form a line whose edge intersects in pairs and for each pair the corresponding sides are parallel and of the same length . then joining these sides together , one gets a flat surface . it is necessary to check that the normal intersection point of the vertical line and the line corresponding to @ xmath242 in @ xmath45 has the same normal form as @ xmath10 , so we have constructed a suspension for @ xmath10 . we will show in this section that @ xmath163 defines a _ suitable polygon _ . the vertical lines @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 both intersect each .points ( see section [ right : wrong : polygon ] ) . however , we can still define a flat surface by using an analogous construction , the closed circle construction . we now give a description of this construction ( see e . g . @ xcite for the details of interval arithmetic operations , see section [ subsec : zip ] ) . this construction is very similar to the previous one , although the precise definition is more complicated . still , for simplicity , we give an equivalent but rather implicit construction . we first consider the special case when @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 form a suitable pair . for each point of interval @ xmath371 on @ xmath242 , the value in @ xmath372 of the suspension data returning from @ xmath373 and returning to @ xmath374 is zero . this value depends both on the base point and on the imaginary part of the suspension data @ xmath163 . there is a natural embedding of the closed rectangle @ xmath375 into the flat surface @ xmath45 and this map is obtained from @ xmath376 by acting on theboundaries of the @ xmath377 . identifications for the horizontal parameters @ xmath378 $ ] are given by the linear equations and equations for the vertical parameters that depend on the corresponding permutation and of @ xmath379 . . ] for the general case , we define the triangle @ xmath377 using the following formulas . identifications for the horizontal sides are given . identifications for the vertical sides , that do not depend on the horizontal parameters , can be best understood in the following steps . let @ xmath163 be the corresponding data for the linear equation @ xmath10 , and let @ xmath274 be the corresponding generalized data . there is a linear involution @ xmath380 and a suspension data @ xmath381 for @ xmath382 such that : * the generalized data corresponding to @ xmath382 is @ xmath274 . * for any @ xmath383 the two numbers @ xmath384 and @ xmath385 have the same real value . * the suspension data @ xmath381 defines a suitable2 . we can assume that @ xmath386 ( the negative case is , and there is nothing to do when the sum is zero ) . it is clear that @ xmath387 , there would be no possible suspension data . if @ xmath388 , then we can shorten the imaginary part of @ xmath389 , with condition ( 1 ) ( 2 ) above , and create a suspension data @ xmath381 with the same imaginary part as @ xmath163 , and such that @ xmath390 . this last condition implies that @ xmath381 defines a suitable triangle . if @ xmath331 , then then @ xmath391 implies that @ xmath392 is similar rather than @ xmath393 . however , we can still change @ xmath163 into a suspension data @ xmath381 , with an imaginary part , and such that @ xmath394 is also similar to @ xmath395 . in that case , @ xmath381 also defines a suitable polygon . see @ xcite , lemma 3 . 3 for more details . we have also used the zipper##ed rectangle ##s for any suspension data . note that we have not yet discussed the definition of a suspension data . this will be done in the next section . this definition is equivalent . see @ xcite and the following sections . [ id : irr : natural ] let @ xmath45 be a flat surface with no vertical saddle connections and let @ xmath242 be a closed interval attached to a point on the surface . let @ xmath396 be the right line passing through the left endpoint of @ xmath242 , we say that @ xmath396 reaches a singularity , returning to @ xmath242 , in positive or negative direction . let @ xmath21 be the linear map given by the cross section on @ xmath242 of the vertical flow . there exists a suspension data @ xmath163 such that @ xmath204 is a surface isometric to @ xmath45 . see the construction used in the proof of proposition @ xmath397 and @ xcite . we can define the rauzy - veech metric on the space of circles , as well as on the space of open intervals .let @ xmath303 be a linear combination and let @ xmath163 be a suspension over @ xmath10 . then we define @ xmath398 as such . * if @ xmath303 has type @ xmath103 , then @ xmath399 , with @ xmath400 if @ xmath338 and @ xmath401 . * if @ xmath303 has type @ xmath72 , then @ xmath402 , with @ xmath400 if @ xmath341 and @ xmath403 . we then show that @ xmath404 is a suspension over @ xmath30 and is a surface corresponding to the surface corresponding to @ xmath405 . as in the theory of continuous functions , we consider the following rauzy - veech induction ##s on lengths of intervals : @ xmath140 one can perform exactly the following renormalized rauzy - veech induction on the same interval by dividing the two intervals by the function @ xmath406 which determines the shape of the resulting flat surface . in this case we givea necessary and sufficient condition for a generalized inclusion to be a suspension ; this will be the first part of definition @ xmath2 . let us first use some notations to make up the definition . _ notation : _ if @ xmath407 is an inclusion , we will denote by @ xmath408 the subset with multiplicities @ xmath409 of type @ xmath410 , and we will use analogous notation for subsets of @ xmath19 . we will also call _ top _ ( respectively _ top _ ) the restriction of a generalized inclusion @ xmath274 to @ xmath411 ( or @ xmath412 ) where @ xmath16 is the complement of @ xmath274 . _ notation : _ let @ xmath413 be ( possibly empty ) any subsets of @ xmath19 or @ xmath408 . we say that a generalized inclusion @ xmath274 of type @ xmath16 is free if @ xmath414 and there exist @ xmath415 and @ xmath416 such that * @ xmat##h417 * @ xmath418 * @ xmath419 * @ xmath420 . the corners @ xmath421 , and @ xmath422 will be represented as top - left , top - right , bottom - left and bottom - right , respectively . we do not say that @ xmath423 , nor @ xmath424 . [ def : irred ] we do say that @ xmath274 is _ empty _ if @ xmath274 has a closure @ xmath425 where the corners @ xmath426 are not _ empty and one of the following statements holds 1 . no corner is empty 2 . exactly one corner is empty and it is on the right . 3 . exactly two corners are empty and they are either both on the left , either is on the right . every corner that is _ empty is _ irreducible _ . the main result of this section is the next statement which , when combined with proposition [ prop : irr : natural ] implies first statement of theorem @ xmath2 . we make clear that in this section , we only speak of suspensions given in the construction of proposition [ su##sp : giem ] . [ 1 ] let @ xmath21 be a linear combination . then @ xmath10 admits a suspension @ xmath163 if and only if the corresponding generalized module @ xmath3 is irreducible . note that the existence or not of a suspension is independent of the length of @ xmath6 . one can see that this reducibility property is not universal with respect to the left / right , contrary to the case of interval exchange maps . therefore , the choice of attaching a suspension on the left end of the interval in the case of @ [ susp : giem ] requires a real number . this will have an immediate consequence in terms of the rauzy classes . [ rem : sp : lim ] in the usual case of interval exchange maps , one can always define @ xmath163 in such a way that @ xmath427 ( _ i . e . _ _ is a singularity on the left and on the right of the interval ) . but it is not always true . more generally one can show that @ xmath10 admits such a suspension with this additional condition if and only if for every decomposition of@ xmath274 as in equation @ xmath428 above , all the corners are empty . [ cn ] a simple generalized function does not have any suspension data . let us call @ xmath3 a simple generalized permutation . it is required to satisfy these conditions . let us assume that there is a suspension @ xmath163 over @ xmath3 . then we define @ xmath429 the natural number @ xmath430 ; we define @ xmath431 if the corner @ xmath2 is empty . then we define @ xmath432 , @ xmath433 and @ xmath4 in an equivalent way for @ xmath434 and @ xmath37 . we also define @ xmath435 . we give ourselves the following definition [ def : irred ] . _ i - no corner is empty . _ + satisfy the following conditions for @ xmath436 subtracting the second corner from the first one , and the second one from the third one , we get : @ xmath437 which is a contradiction . _ ii - if no corner is empty , and itand on the right . _ + we can assume without need of argument that this is the top - left triangle . that means that @ xmath2 , @ xmath40 are empty , and @ xmath31 , @ xmath37 are nonempty . therefore the following inequalities hold : @ xmath438 subtracting the first inequality from the second one , we have @ xmath439 , which contradicts the first one . _ + - exactly two corners are empty . _ + if they are both on the left side , then we have @ xmath40 and @ xmath31 , and @ xmath37 non negative . this implies that @ xmath440 is both positive and negative , which is impossible . + if they are both on the right side , it is impossible . if the two corners of the triangle were empty , then it is easy to see that all the corners would be empty , since this inequality does not occur by itself . the theorem is proven . in this case , we need not necessarily assume that all corners are the [ conv : 0 ] , since for technical reasons , some additional conditions of this section must be satisfied foran _ generalized suspension . we would have to focus only on the real part of the @ xmath441 in order to construct a suspension . hence , in order to simplify the problem we must use the previous ones . we will use this one only in this section .

[ flip : donc : reducible : theorem ] let @ xmath274 be a strictly irreducible generalized permutation . let @ xmath451 be a pseudo - suspension which is better than @ xmath455 and maximal . then @ xmath451 is a strict pseudo - suspension . proof .note that @ xmath451 is not empty . from statements [ lemmea ] and [ lemmeb ] and then [ 2 ] we obtain the canonical definition of @ xmath274 . @ xmath559 with @ xmath560 , @ xmath561 and @ xmath562 by definition , and with the condition that either @ xmath563 is equal , or at least one of them is empty ( and similar statements for the pair @ xmath564 ) ; and the condition that if @ xmath558 , they are either equal , or at least one of them is empty , or one of them is @ xmath565 ( and similar statements for @ xmath566 ) . by convention from now on , we will use the pairs @ xmath40 and @ xmath31 , when they are either equal to @ xmath565 or @ xmath567 , and therefore not of @ xmath461 or @ xmath463 . let us assume that if there is a vanishing index in @ xmath568 or in @ xmath569 , the upper ##most term isjust then . but if @ xmath451 is not strict , then there are at least a pair of nonempty corners in the top and in the bottom . if there is a vanishing index on the top , then the two top corners are non - empty . so it is easy to see that either there is a corner with either @ xmath570 or @ xmath37 , or the corners are only @ xmath571 and @ xmath572 , with @ xmath573 nonempty . from this the argument [ lemmea ] implies that there must be a vanishing index in @ xmath574 . since there must be a vanishing index in the top , and in the bottom , the same argument implies that either @ xmath274 is not strongly strict , or there is a corner that only consists of one corner @ xmath575 or @ xmath37 . thanks to the [ theorem ] , we assume that this is the upper - left corner ; this leads to the two following results . the main idea of the first part of the proof is first to remove the cases that correspond to not strongly irreducible sets , and then show that thethese cases correspond to a non - trivial non - solution . _ + case : the bottom - left corner is @ xmath40 . _ + case is necessary for vanishing index in @ xmath568 , and hence the bottom - right corner is not empty . it also does not contain element @ xmath565 , so it is not @ xmath40 , @ xmath37 or @ xmath572 . recall that @ xmath3 is required to be strongly independent , so the bottom - right corner is not @ xmath40 . if the bottom - right corner were @ xmath37 , the generalized element @ xmath274 would decompose into @ xmath576 and @ xmath577 which are not strongly irreducible . hence the bottom - right corner is not @ xmath37 . this also implies that @ xmath463 will not be independent . let us assume that there are no vanishing indices in the bottom corner . we take the element @ xmath578 , @ xmath579 , and @ xmath580 and change @ xmath581 , @ xmath582 , @xmath583 replaces @ xmath584 and @ xmath585 by @ xmath586 . if @ xmath96 is small enough , then the identity matrix @ xmath450 is smaller than @ xmath451 , which implies its maximality . so , the matrix has vanishing indices ; then the bottom - right corner must be @ xmath587 or @ xmath588 . let us consider these examples in detail . * @ xmath31 : the bottom - right corner is @ xmath31 , @ xmath37 , @ xmath589 . in the first and second cases , @ xmath274 is not strongly irreducible . if for example , the bottom - corner is @ xmath572 , then @ xmath274 decomposes as @ xmath590 and therefore @ xmath274 is not strongly equivalent . the other case is similar . * @ xmath567 * @ xmath591 : in that case , the bottom - right corner is @ @ xmath37 and we have already proved that @ xmath3 is not strongly ir##reducible in this case . * @ xmath2 by @ xmath592 : we have a simple pseudo - code @ xmath452 . + let @ xmath593 be the smallest index such that @ xmath594 and let @ xmath595 be the largest index . let @ xmath509 be the smallest - index . there exists @ xmath596 such that @ xmath597 otherwise the top - index would be the decomposition of @ xmath598 , and @ xmath274 would be not yet defined . let @ xmath599 be the largest decomposition of @ xmath489 ( see figure [ exemple2 ] ) . + . we define @ xmath450 in the following way : @ xmath600 in the extremal case @ xmath601 , the following arguments will behave similarly if we replace @ xmath602 by @ xmath603 . we define @ xmath604 by @ xmath605 is the difference between the number of elements in @ xmath606 less than or equal to @ xmath108 ,and number of indices in @ xmath607 greater than or equal to @ xmath108 . this value is _ _ _ greater than or equal to zero for @ xmath608 , and is always greater than zero when @ xmath108 is the first vanishing index . + then @ xmath609 is the difference between the number of indices in @ xmath610 that are in @ xmath611 , and number of indices in @ xmath612 that are in @ xmath611 . this value might be positive . let @ xmath613 be respectively the first and the second vanishing indices . we have the following values : * * @ xmath614 otherwise the bottom - left corner is @ xmath31 . * * @ xmath615 otherwise the bottom - right corner is @ xmath37 . + then it is easy to check that @ xmath609 will be more positive than for @ xmath616 and @ xmath617 . + then if @ xmath96 is good enough , @ xmath450 is a self - suspension , and is better than @ xmath451( see also [ exemple2 ] ) , which implies the maximality of @ xmath451 . less than @ xmath451 . ] _ second case : the top - right corner is @ xmath2 . _ + we assume that there are no corners @ xmath40 or @ xmath31 , since this case has already been proved . let us assume that there is a vanishing index in the bottom corner . then , according to lemma [ lemmea ] , @ xmath618 ; and the top - right corner is @ xmath565 or @ xmath40 . if @ xmath463 is empty , then @ xmath274 turns into @ xmath619 . @ xmath274 is not necessarily empty . if @ xmath463 is not empty , we take the corner @ xmath620 , @ xmath621 , @ xmath622 , and replace @ xmath623 by @ xmath624 , @ xmath581 by @ xmath625 , and @ xmath583 by @ xmath626 .this new sub - list we have here is equivalent that the previous one for @ xmath96 long enough . if there are two values in the list , then the bottom - right corner belongs to the list : @ xmath627 and @ xmath567 . * @ xmath2 : the permutation @ xmath274 is then , not strongly irreducible . * @ xmath592 : the bottom - right corner is between @ xmath37 and @ xmath628 . if the bottom - right corner where @ xmath37 , then @ xmath274 would be not strongly equivalent . in particular , that index @ xmath461 is not necessary . suppose there exists @ xmath629 such that @ xmath630 and @ xmath631 . then we take any index @ xmath620 and any index @ xmath632 , and then : @ xmath633 then @ xmath450 is greater than @ xmath451 for @ xmath634 long enough , which is the maximality . * @ xmath635 , and @ xmat##h567 . the bottom - left corner is necessary @ xmath37 . if @ xmath461 is empty , then the bottom - right corner is also @ xmath37 , and therefore @ xmath274 is not strongly maximal . if @ xmath461 is not empty , then we take @ xmath620 , @ xmath621 and @ xmath579 , and set : @ xmath636 and @ xmath450 are better than @ xmath451 . the theorem is true . we now have the necessary conditions for proving our desired result . we only have to satisfy the sufficient condition . we consider a self - generator @ xmath451 better than @ xmath455 and check for this condition . we can assume that @ xmath637 is not strongly maximal ( i . e . at least one corner is not empty in the decomposition ) . the theorem follows from theorem [ lm : maximal : irred ] and theorem [ max : donc : max : maximal ] . let us consider a decomposition of @ xmath274 and @ xmath638 where @ xmath6##39 is equivalent . note that @ xmath640 is a normal permutation which is not strongly normal by assumption . note also that @ xmath641 does not necessary the convention [ conv : normal ] , even if @ xmath274 has that convention . we have @ xmath642 ; from proposition [ r : donc : reducible : star ] , the restriction of @ xmath451 to @ xmath643 is valid for @ xmath641 . since @ xmath274 is normal , there are one or two left corners of the square . * if only one corner is normal , then it is on the right . so we can see that @ xmath274 decomposes to : @ xmath644 with @ xmath645 being normal . + let @ xmath509 be the first vanishing index of the first line of @ xmath274 and @ xmath510 be the first vanishing index of the second line . consider @ xmath646 the smallest index such that @ xmath647 . = @ xmath648 . this would be asubdecomposition of @ xmath274 into @ xmath649 and @ xmath274 would be trivial . we choose @ xmath650 and then @ xmath579 . we set : @ xmath651 if @ xmath96 is small enough , then @ xmath450 defines : * * for all @ xmath652 . * * for all @ xmath653 . + and then , we can deduce from @ xmath450 a suspension over @ xmath274 . * if the intervals are finite , then we can see that @ xmath274 transforms as : @ xmath654 with @ xmath655 irreducible . if we choose @ xmath578 and @ xmath579 , and then set : @ xmath656 then @ xmath450 defines a suspension over @ xmath274 for @ xmath96 small enough . the theorem is equivalent . for an odd - size @ xmath21 , the underlying permutation is empty and then the theorem is not trivial . @ xmath##3 is true and @ xmath10 has the keane s property ( and it is true ) for almost every @ xmath6 ( see also [ 2 : iem ] ) . * @ xmath10 is a connection if and only if @ xmath3 is good . + + the smallest set for which the geometry of @ xmath10 is good agrees with the set for which the geometry is good . as we will see , the proof is more complicated than the general case . in this section we prove theorem @ xmath40 and the first version of theorem @ xmath2 . a linear involution has a connection ( of length @ xmath657 ) if there exist @ xmath658 and @ xmath659 such that * @ xmath14 is a connection for @ xmath131 . * @ xmath660 is a connection for @ xmath10 . a linear involution with a connection is said to have the keane s property . note that , by definition of a connection , if we have a connection of length @ xmath657 starting from @ xmath14 , .@ xmath661 has not a connection for @ xmath10 . we can consider the following condition : [ x : 0 ] let @ xmath10 be a linear involution . the following conditions are equivalent . 1 . @ xmath10 satisfies the keane ##n ##f . @ xmath662 is well defined for both @ xmath663 and the lengths of the maps @ xmath664 corresponding to @ xmath103 and @ xmath70 ##0 to infinity . thus in the above example the transformation @ xmath10 is linear . we denote by @ xmath664 the local ##ization of the map @ xmath665 , by @ xmath666 , @ xmath667 , @ xmath668 the local parameters , and by @ xmath669 the subinterval of @ xmath242 corresponding to @ xmath665 . let us assume that @ xmath10 has no connection . then all the iterates of @ xmath10 under the rauzy - veech transformation are well defined . then it is easy to see that @ xmath10 hasthe keane s property if and only if its image @ xmath30 . the rauzy - veech theorem is well defined and has the keane s property . hence if @ xmath10 has the keane s property , then by induction , all the iterates by @ xmath227 are well defined and have the keane s property . now we want to show that @ xmath664 tends to zero and @ xmath70 tends to zero . let @ xmath670 be the subset of x @ xmath671 , that @ xmath672 spends an infinite amount of time in the subset @ xmath673 , and let @ xmath674 be its complement . repeating the proof for the theorem and sections 1 and 2 of section 4 . 1 in @ xcite , we find that : * for @ xmath70 large enough , the function @ xmath666 can be written as : @ xmath675 with @ xmath676 * for all @ xmath677 , @ xmath678 tends to zero . if @ xmath679 , then the perhas proven . so we can prove that @ xmath670 is a proper subset of @ xmath19 . note that @ xmath670 need not be defined . therefore , we can have @ xmath680 for both @ xmath681 and @ xmath682 . this implies that @ xmath683 has a connection of length 1 , and @ xmath10 has a connection . this proves the theorem . so we have proved that if @ xmath10 has no connections , then the sequence @ xmath673 of connections of @ xmath10 under the rauzy - veech induction is infinite and the length connections of @ xmath684 tend to zero when @ xmath70 tends to zero . so we assume that @ xmath10 has a connection . therefore , there exists @ xmath685 for @ xmath8 which is a singularity of @ xmath131 , and so that the sequence @ xmath686 of connections by @ xmath10 is infinite , with @ xmath687 a limit of @ xmath10 .we define by @ xmath688 the projections of @ xmath689 and @ xmath242 . let @ xmath690 be the projection of @ xmath691 whose inverse projection to @ xmath242 is defined . we define @ xmath692 . if for all @ xmath663 , the maximal @ xmath683 is well defined and @ xmath693 , then @ xmath669 does not tend to zero , and thus there exists @ xmath694 such that @ xmath135 does not tend to zero . then we can assume that there exists a maximal @ xmath24 ##2 that @ xmath695 is well defined , and @ xmath696 contains @ xmath697 . we want to assume that @ xmath698 is well defined . suppose that @ xmath698 is defined , and @ xmath699 . since @ xmath695 is an acceleration of @ xmath10 , there must be an iterate of @ xmath690 by @ xmath10, and @ xmath700 which is a singular for @ xmath695 . either @ xmath701 is in @ xmath702 , or it is its right end . however , @ xmath702 does not contain @ xmath697 , and @ xmath703 . therefore , we also have @ xmath704 , and @ xmath690 is a singular for @ xmath695 . we prove in the same way that @ xmath690 is not a singular for @ xmath705 . this means that we are now testing the case when the rauzy - veech induction is not true . so we have proved that if @ xmath10 has no limit , then if the set @ xmath706 is infinite , either the length of or not all tend to zero . this proves the first part of the proposition . now let @ xmath10 be a linear sequence on @ xmath242 with the keane s property . suppose that @ xmath10 is defined on the set @ xmath255 . let us consider the following linear sequence @ xmat##h244 = @ xmath707 . by definition of @ xmath244 , one has for each @ xmath14 a return time @ xmath708 so that @ xmath709 . then @ xmath10 is piecewise linear . for any @ xmath710 in a dense neighborhood of @ xmath14 , the return time @ xmath711 . since the derivative of @ xmath10 is @ xmath72 if @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 belong to the same connected pair and @ xmath13 exists , the derivative of @ xmath244 is also @ xmath72 . so @ xmath244 is a _ _ exchange _ function . obviously @ xmath244 has no derivative since it is an acceleration of @ xmath10 , so @ xmath244 is minimal . however , the corresponding return time @ xmath253 of @ xmath10 on @ xmath267 is not minimal . since @ xmath10 satisfies the [ conv : x ] , the neighborhood of @ xmath10 is minimal . @xmath707 and @ xmath267 . @ xmath10 is minimal . the proof is complete . [ def : dyn : irr ] let @ xmath303 be a generalized involution . we can say that @ xmath6 is _ minimal _ for @ xmath3 ( and @ xmath10 with corresponding parameters ) if none of the following conditions satisfy : 1 . [ def : 1 ] @ xmath274 transforms as @ xmath712 + with @ xmath713 and @ xmath714 non empty in the two remaining cases . [ def : 2 ] this is a decomposition of @ xmath274 into @ xmath715 , with ( up to switching the top and the bottom of @ xmath274 ) @ xmath716 and the corresponding parameters @ xmath6 satisfying the following : @ xmath717 a generalized permutation @ xmath274 will be minimal _ _ _ _ if the empty set of corresponding parameters is nonempty . the set of admissible parameters of a generalized function is not empty . [ rm: th : 1 ] these two basic notions of reducibility were introduced in the second group ( see @ xcite ) . observe that if @ xmath6 is not minimal for @ xmath274 , then @ xmath21 has a connection of length @ xmath103 to @ xmath72 depending on definition or of definition [ def : dyn : irr ] , and is therefore minimal . more precisely there exist two distinct parameters of equal order . + one . also note that if @ xmath3 is minimal then @ xmath3 is also irreducible ( the set of admissible parameters being the entire parameters space ) . the length parameters for @ xmath10 need not be linearly independent of @ xmath718 since they must satisfy a nontrivial relation with integer coefficients . a linear involution @ xmath719 is said to have _ _ parameters _ if @ xmath720 is an @ xmath718 - dimensional vector of length @ xmath721 . not all linear involutions have irrational coefficients , and this property is satisfied by the rauzy - veech induction . if @xmath3 is not minimal , the term minimality comes from remark [ rm : def : length ] . _ let us assume that @ xmath3 is a unique irreducible function and that @ xmath21 is a linear sequence with irrational coefficients and @ xmath6 admissible for @ xmath3 . we still denote by @ xmath664 the length parameters of @ xmath722 and by @ xmath666 , @ xmath667 , @ xmath668 the sequence itself . the proof takes two steps : first we show by proposition [ no : length ] that if @ xmath10 does not satisfy the keane ##y property , then there exists @ xmath24 ##5 that @ xmath695 does not have admissible length ( proof of proposition [ def : dyn : irr ] ) . then we show that in this case @ xmath6 is not admissible for @ xmath274 . this will prove the theorem . _ second step : _ we show that the sequence is minimal . then there exists @ xmath695 that has no rauzy - veech2 . since @ xmath723 is irrational , either @ xmath724 , or @ xmath725 belongs to the only pair @ xmath726 on the top of the permutation and @ xmath727 belongs to the only pair @ xmath728 on the top of the permutation . in this case , @ xmath695 does not have any parameter ( case ) . thus we see that the lengths parameters do not necessarily sum to 0 . so in the proof of proposition [ 1 : connection ] , for @ xmath70 ##0 , , the resulting pair @ xmath666 proceeds as : @ xmath729 with @ xmath730 , for some @ xmath731 and some @ xmath732 and @ xmath733 . note that @ xmath734 the pair @ xmath683 has length 0 , so @ xmath666 will proceed as : @ xmath735 with @ xmath684 does not have ##missible parameter ( case ) . _ second example : _ it is enough to see that if @ xmat##h736 does not have this parameter , and so does @ xmath10 . we also show without loss of generality that the following rauzy - veech transformation yields @ xmath104 . we denote by @ xmath737 the data of @ xmath10 and by @ xmath738 the data of @ xmath382 . if @ xmath739 decomposes as : @ xmath740 let us call @ xmath741 the last point of the top line . its value @ xmath742 is in the bottom - left corner , and is not @ xmath743 . we denote by @ xmath744 . then it is clear that we obtain @ xmath274 by removing @ xmath745 from that place and placing it on the bottom - right of the bottom line . so @ xmath10 does not have ##missible parameter ( s ) . now we show that @ xmath739 transforms as : @ xmath746 if @ xmath742 is on the top line , the case is analogous to the above case . if so , then we denote by@ xmath747 and @ xmath748 , and we get @ xmath274 by removing @ xmath745 from @ xmath749 and putting it on the right - end of the bottom line . if this element is in the top - right corner , then clearly , @ xmath10 does not have admissible parameter ( case ) . however , it may be the only element of the top - right corner . in that case , setting @ xmath750 , the binary permutation @ xmath274 transforms to : @ xmath751 with @ xmath752 and @ xmath753 , so @ xmath10 does not have ##missible parameter ( case ) . now we see that @ xmath739 decomposes as @ xmath754 . we obtain @ xmath274 from @ xmath739 by removing an element on the top - left corner or in the bottom - right corner , and putting it at the right - end of the bottom line . but @ xmath10 does not have admissible parameter ( case ) . the other cases are similar . as we have seen above , @consider two definitions of irreducibility for a linear transformation . * ` ` geometrical irreducibility ' ' as stated in section [ combinatoric ] , that we can define irreducibility . * define irreducibility as stated in section [ sec : dyn ] . in this section , we first show that the set of all linear transformations is an attractor for the renormalized rauzy - veech induction . then we show that ( analogously to the case of interval linear transformations ) the renormalized rauzy - veech induction is valid for almost all interval linear transformations . we can take any non - zero pseudo - integer @ xmath755 ( see definition [ def : 0 ] ) otherwise it is necessary to show that @ xmath10 does not have a parameter ( case ( 1 ) ) . for example @ xmath383 , we denote by @ xmath170 the edge number @ xmath756 . then , as in section [ sec : red12 ] , we define a real line @ xmath164 which ends at @ xmath103 , and whose edge number@ xmath365 is represented by the complex number @ xmath366 , for @ xmath757 . then we find a smooth curve @ xmath168 , which starts at the same point as @ xmath164 , and whose complex number @ xmath368 is represented by the complex number @ xmath369 for @ xmath370 . is the first return map of the vertical flow on a union of saddle connections . ] _ special case : _ we assume that @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 only depend on their endpoints . then they intersect a flat surface @ xmath45 , and @ xmath10 serves as the first return map of the vertical flow on a segment @ xmath242 which is a union of horizontal saddle connections ( see also [ special : _ ] ) . using @ xmath70 ##0 of the rauzy - veech induction , the resulting linear map @ xmath683 is the first return map of the vertical flow of @ xmath45 on a flat segment @ xmath669 , which is equivalent to the same singularity as @ x##math242 . since @ xmath10 has no connection , then the area of @ xmath669 tends to zero when @ xmath70 tends to zero by the first part of proposition [ prop : connection ] . hence for @ xmath70 large enough , @ xmath683 is the first return map of the vertical saddle of @ xmath45 on that segment , adjacent to a singularity , and with no singularities on the manifold . with our knowledge of @ xmath45 , it is clear that any vertical saddle connection would satisfy @ xmath242 and would give a connection with @ xmath45 . since @ xmath10 has no connection , the manifold @ xmath45 has no vertical saddle connection ( note that this is not true in general for a first return map on a transverse segment ) . according to proposition [ prop : irr : connection ] , @ xmath758 admits a suspension and the proposition [ cns ] states that @ xmath25 is connected . the theorem is true for that manifold . for a first return map on a transverse segment of the surface @ xmath759 . ] _ general case : _the two parallel lines @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 will have different end points . we first show this still defines a flat surface . we take the line @ xmath760 that starts at the complex point @ xmath761 . then we join the end points of @ xmath762 and @ xmath168 into a vertical line , and do the same for their ends . ( see figure [ general : 1 ] ) . this is a triangle and the two opposite sides are by pairs , so we can glue them as one . there are no horizontal segments left . we split each vertical segment into a pair of vertical segments of the same length and join them together ( see the figure ) . this gives a point for each end point . we denote by @ xmath759 the resulting flat surface . the first return point of the vertical flow on the horizontal surface @ xmath763 between the two points is @ xmath10 . the surface @ xmath759 has two horizontal saddle connections of length @ xmath96 ##3 from the poles , but there is no other horizontal saddle connection on @ xmath759 since @ xmath##10 . no loops . when @ xmath96 tends to zero , the two left saddle ##s are the only connections that shrink to zero . hence there is no sequence that tends to zero . furthermore , the first self - loop is nonzero , so the limit of @ xmath759 is bounded from below . however , the sequence @ xmath759 does not degenerate when @ xmath96 tends to zero and therefore there exists a sequence @ xmath764 that tends to zero so that @ xmath765 corresponds to the loop @ xmath45 . the segment @ xmath766 corresponding to the limit of @ xmath767 , when @ xmath108 tends to zero , can be very large and the first return map on @ xmath242 is not well defined . the segment @ xmath683 is the first return map of the forward limit of @ xmath768 . the first horizontal connection @ xmath769 , corresponding to one of the loops . if @ xmath70 is large enough , then the segment @ xmath770 corresponding to the limit of @ xmath771and no singularity on the surface . since the surgery corresponding to precisely @ xmath96 does not have the the vertical foliation , the first return point of the vertical connection of @ xmath45 to @ xmath669 is precisely @ xmath683 . so in the first case , the surgery @ xmath45 does not have a vertical - connection , so the vertical surgery corresponding to @ xmath683 is known and the theorem is proven . the second proposition is equivalent to theorem 9 . 1 . @ xcite . [ lem : 1 ] let @ xmath10 be the linear map to @ xmath301 with no connection and let @ xmath772 be a singularity for @ xmath10 . let @ xmath773 be the subinterval corresponding to the linear map @ xmath683 . there exists @ xmath150 such that @ xmath774 . since @ xmath10 has no connection , there exists a point @ xmath150 such that @ xmath775 . so @ xmath##776 , and @ xmath14 is also a replacement for @ xmath777 . we construct @ xmath684 from @ xmath777 by placing the first return value on the largest subinterval @ xmath778 whose left side belongs to a point of @ xmath777 . define @ xmath774 . let @ xmath779 be an arbitrary generalized permutation , and let @ xmath31 be the set of generalized permutations that can be constructed with consideration of the maps @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 ( when possible ) . we define @ xmath780 . we have defined the rauzy - veech map on the space @ xmath214 . this is an almost everywhere invertible map : if @ xmath781 then @ xmath204 has been the preimage for @ xmath137 . we define the quotient @ xmath782 of @ xmath214 by the linear relation induced by @ xmath783 . we can define the@ xmath223 the natural lebesgue measure preserves @ xmath214 i . e . @ xmath784 , where @ xmath226 is the natural lebesgue measure on the hyperplane @ xmath785 , and @ xmath786 is the natural measure . the matrix @ xmath227 preserves @ xmath223 , so it has a measure , , defined by @ xmath223 by @ xmath782 . the matrix @ xmath230 acts on @ xmath214 by @ xmath229 , where @ xmath230 acts on @ xmath231 linearly . this matrix preserves the measure @ xmath223 by @ xmath214 and commutes with @ xmath227 , so it leads to a measure preserving flow on @ xmath787 , the teichmller flow . if @ xmath204 is a linear flow , we denote by @ xmath788 the length of the unit circle , _ i . e . _ @ xmath789 . the matrix @ xmath790consider the fundamental point of @ xmath214 for the measure @ xmath195 and the first return point of the teichmller function . @ xmath791 proves the first rauzy - veech theorem on suspensions . the zippered cover construction is a finite cover @ xmath792 from @ xmath782 to a point of the measure in the left component of a subset @ xmath793 of the metric space of quadratic forms . the degree of this cover is @ xmath794 where @ xmath795 is the genus of the stratum . at @ xmath796 ( @ xmath42 is the genus of the surfaces ) . let @ xmath45 be a ( generic ) compact surface at @ xmath793 with no vertical and no horizontal line connection . consider a given separatrix @ xmath797 adjacent to a given point @ xmath798 . we have _ the _ line at @ xmath242 adjacent to @ xmath798 , such that the vertical line passing .the left end of @ xmath242 meets a point , corresponding to @ xmath242 , in positive and negative directions . then , [ prop : irr : x ] implies that there exists a corresponding suspension data @ xmath163 such that @ xmath799 . conversely , any @ xmath163 such that @ xmath799 is given by this formula . now let @ xmath800 be the line segments , and let @ xmath801 be the corresponding suspension data . we can show without loss of argument that @ xmath802 and their left endpoint are the singularity @ xmath798 . let @ xmath803 be the linear map corresponding to @ xmath800 . the right endpoint of @ xmath804 corresponds to a point of @ xmath253 . then there exists @ xmath663 such that @ xmath805 , and therefore @ xmath806 . so we have such that for any point @ xmath797 adjacent to a singularity , there is exactly one preimage of @xmath45 is the cover @ xmath792 . thus @ xmath792 is a finite covering . the degree of @ xmath792 is obvious by induction . if @ xmath807 is the number of possible choices of horizontal labels then the degree of @ xmath792 is @ xmath794 ( choices of labels and the degree of the mapping @ xmath255 ) . for a surface , one has @ xmath808 ##2 . in @ xmath809 the proposition is true . the cover @ xmath810 corresponding to surfaces of genus 2 is a finite ramified cover of a finite component of a family of quadratic differential , and the corresponding lebesgue measures are proportional . by theorem 1 . 2 in @ xcite the volume of the dual space of the differential is finite , and hence , @ xmath810 has finite volume . thus the teichmller continuous function on @ xmath782 is recurrent for the lebesgue measure . recall that the rauzy - veech renormalization for suspensions @ x##math811 is the cross section of the teichmller continuous function , @ xmath241 ; and the rauzy - veech renormalization for this is valid . we have @ xmath812 , and the rauzy - veech theorem agrees with the theorem @ xmath813 . so , for almost all n @ xmath6 , the sequence @ xmath814 is recurrent . note that the proof of theorem @ xmath31 does not use the fact that a linear combination with the keane s property is minimal . we can use this fact to give an alternative proof of the minimality of such sequences . let @ xmath10 be a linear combination with the keane s property . from theorem @ xmath31 , there exists @ xmath815 such that @ xmath816 is the cross section of the vertical line on a smooth surface with an infinite vertical connection . the minimal vertical geodesic on such a surface is minimal ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . thus @ xmath662 is minimal and so is @ xmath10 . as we have seen previously, the two generalized classes are an attractor for the rauzy - veech induction . in this case , we prove that there is no such attractor . we also prove that @ xmath37 . we can define the rauzy classes and then the extended rauzy classes . given a permutation @ xmath3 , we can replace _ at most _ two generalized classes @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 when @ xmath817 is well defined . the map @ xmath818 generates a partial order on the set of generalized classes ; we define it as the connected graph @ xmath148 , and as for permutations , we can call rauzy classes the connected components of this graph . in the case of binary operations , the existence of the maps @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 gives an easy proof of the fact that the above relation is an equivalence relation ( one of the [ rauzy : classes : iem ] ) . here the proof fails because these maps are not necessarily periodic , and it may be that @ xmath819 is well defined , but not @ xmat##h820 . 2 , the above statement is still true . [ class : class ] the generalized partial order is an equivalence relation on the set of _ _ _ generalized permutations . let @ xmath274 and @ xmath739 be two generalized sequences . suppose that there is a sequence of parameters @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 that maps @ xmath274 to @ xmath739 . if @ xmath821 , then for any parameters @ xmath822 , there exist a @ xmath823 such that @ xmath824 . iterating this way , there exist @ xmath825 and @ xmath24 such that @ xmath826 . then for any @ xmath6 in a sufficiently small neighborhood @ xmath827 of @ xmath828 , the generalized sequence corresponding to @ xmath829 is @ xmath152 . note that the rauzy - veech ##ai map is defined ( for @ xmath31 ) . one can find @ xmath830 such that the parameters @ xmath814go back to a neighborhood of @ xmath302 infinitely many times . let , @ xmath831 . then @ xmath814 is the set of all forms that leave @ xmath641 and then enter @ xmath274 . so , it gives the sum of the forms @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 that take @ xmath739 to @ xmath274 . this is the proposition . let @ xmath832 . we define the symmetric subset @ xmath52 of @ xmath833 by @ xmath834 . if @ xmath274 is a generalized permutation of type @ xmath16 defined on the set @ xmath19 of @ xmath4 ##a , we define the generalized permutation @ xmath835 to be of type @ xmath836 . @ xmath837 we obtain from an arbitrary generalized form @ xmath274 and we define the subset of all generalized forms that can be obtained from @ xmath274 by the sum of the types @ xmath838, and @ xmath52 . the extension of this class by the equivalence relation generated by @ xmath839 for any bijective map @ xmath264 from @ xmath270 onto @ xmath270 is called the _ extended rauzy class _ of @ xmath274 . the quotient by the equivalence relation generated by @ xmath840 implies that we look for generalized operations , up to renumbering . this is done for technical reasons in the case of theorem @ xmath37 . in contrast to the case of the generalized operations , the definition of irreducibility we give in section [ combinatoric ] is not invariant by the theorem @ xmath52 : for example , the generalized operation @ xmath841 is irreducible and @ xmath842 is reducible . thus the extended rauzy class is obtained after taking the set of generalized permutations obtained from @ xmath274 by the extended rauzy operations , and considering this set of the generalized operations . the results from the previous section show that our definition of irreducibility is the correct one with respect tothe rauzy - veech induction , where we assume that the choice of the ` ` left - end point ' ' is a rational choice . let @ xmath10 be a return map defined on an interval @ xmath301 . recall that rauzy - veech induction of on @ xmath10 consists of considering the first return map on @ xmath843 , where @ xmath844 is the maximal element of @ xmath845 that corresponds to a singular of @ xmath10 . in terms of generalized addition , this corresponds to the @ xmath817 map . we can consider the first return map of @ xmath10 on the interval @ xmath846 , where @ xmath847 is the maximal element of @ xmath845 that corresponds to a singular of @ xmath10 . in terms of generalized addition , this corresponds to the the conjugaison of @ xmath848 map . we can call this the ` ` rauzy - veech induction of @ xmath10 by moving to the limit of @ xmath242 ' ' , or the ` .##uzy - veech induction will do the opposite of the ` ` rauzy - veech induction of @ xmath10 by cutting to the right of @ xmath242 ' ' . let @ xmath475 be an open differential permutation . the whole space of suspension data is convex ( even convex ) , so the set of points constructed from the suspension data , using the zippered set construction , corresponds to the connected component of the metric space of closed sets . it is also connected and closed by the action of the teichmller continuous flow , so this is a subset of # ##ness and ergodicity . let @ xmath849 be a generalized manifold that corresponds to the same connected component of the suspension space . then there exists a surface @ xmath45 and two surfaces @ xmath850 and @ xmath851 , each surface being adjacent to a point @ xmath852 and @ xmath853 , such that for each @ xmath365 , the linear map @ xmath854 induced by the first return point on @ xmath249 has .and @ xmath482 . we can assume that @ xmath45 has no such a map . we recall that data @ xmath249 has an orientation so that the corresponding map @ xmath855 is in its right direction . consider the vertical separatrix @ xmath797 , from @ xmath853 , in the right direction and let @ xmath856 be the vertical intersection point with @ xmath857 . by the usual rauzy - veech induction for @ xmath858 , the map @ xmath859 is a first return map of the vertical direction on the subinterval @ xmath860 , corresponding to @ xmath853 . if @ xmath70 is large enough , then @ xmath859 is equivalent to the first return map on the subinterval @ xmath861 , of the same length as @ xmath862 . we assume also that @ xmath863 , and this first return map is identical with the vertical direction on @ xmath850 . we now need to apply rauzy - veech induction ( to the right andon the right ) on @ xmath253 until we find the first argument value to @ xmath864 with the generalized permutation @ xmath865 . since @ xmath865 is by definition , up to renumbering the function , in the same rauzy domain as @ xmath849 , we will therefore find the values of the maps @ xmath817 , @ xmath866 that send @ xmath475 to @ xmath849 . note that @ xmath867 does not correspond to map to some singularities of @ xmath253 , so the rauzy - veech induction of @ xmath850 will give the result @ xmath864 . if @ xmath868 and @ xmath869 is a function , so we can cut the interval on the right until @ xmath856 is the left end , this will not happen because of lemma [ 1 : 1 ] . then by cutting on the left @ xmath867 will be the right end of the corresponding interval . if @ xmath870 , then similarly , by cutting on the right andthen on the left , we get the linear involutions corresponding to first order functions that only differ by a different choice of basis . hence we have defined the properties of the maps @ xmath817 , @ xmath866 that send @ xmath475 to another @ xmath865 , so that @ xmath871 is in the same rauzy class as @ xmath849 . hence we have shown that if two distinct generalized functions belong to the same suspension component , then they are in the same extended rauzy class . to prove the converse , we can define a much more general class of functions that do not necessary corresponds to a singularity on the left . the ` ` ` extended ' ' suspension ##s satisfy 1 . 2 . @ xmath873 3 . @ xmath874 4 . @ xmath363 for all @ xmath875 ( the case @ xmath876 belongs to suspension ##s as mentioned previously ) . then we can extend the zippered suspension ##s to these extended suspension ##s . as in the usual case , the set of extended suspension data corresponding to a generalized permutation is convex, so the components of x corresponding to a given generalized curve belong to the connected component of it . thus it is easy to see that if @ xmath143 is obtained from @ xmath3 by the formula @ xmath104 , @ xmath105 , @ xmath52 , then the other connected component is the same . recently , extended rauzy classes have been used to prove the non connectedness of the stratum of abelian differentials ( see for example @ xcite ) . for this case , the topological invariants were proved by kontsevich and zorich @ xcite ( hyperellipticity and differential structure ) . for the case of differential forms , the non - connected components ( the four special cases ) are determined by hyperellipticity @ xcite . for the four ` ` special cases ' ' , the only known result up to now is the exact sum of the four extended rauzy classes . see @ xmath37 , which is still not proven . the existence of the following the strata @ xmath877 , @ xmath878 , @ xmath879 and @ xmath880 arenon connected . the generalized strata @ xmath881 and @ xmath882 are irreducible . the two generalized strata belong to the stratum @ xmath883 . according to zorich s . , these generalized permutations do not belong to the other two rauzy classes ( see the [ table : rauzy ] in the figure ) . hence the stratum @ xmath883 is non connected . in fact this strata has only two connected components belonging to the two extended rauzy classes . we reach similar conclusions for the surfaces with the same boundary properties . for the stratum @ xmath884 one can consider the generalized strata @ xmath885 for the strata @ xmath886 one can consider the generalized permutations @ xmath887 for the strata @ xmath888 one can consider the generalized permutations @ xmath889 the theorem is proved . now we give explicit examples of _ reduced _ rauzy classes ( _ i . e . _ up to the strata @ xmath839 , for any permut##ation @ xmath264 of @ xmath19 ) . it is easy to see that there is only one rauzy class filled with ( irreducible ) generalized addition defined over @ xmath35 letters . in that case the rauzy class contains @ xmath36 letter , and the class is filled if and only if it is not irreducible . but there is an interesting phenomenon about this ` ` simple ' ' class . if we consider a much more complicated case , for simple permutations defined over @ xmath36 , we get an interesting phenomenon . figure [ rauzy : 3 : 2ii ] shows such a rauzy class . it belongs to the class @ xmath890 . the simple permutations @ xmath891 and @ xmath892 are not included in the rauzy class since they are not , but we can see there is also the ` ` simple ' ' phenomenon . as we can see the ( reduced ) rauzy classes for generalized addition are in general much more complicated than the classes for simple permutation since the property is either of the one orof regular graphs . see also [ fig : rauzy : table ] we have a more general example with the ` ` ' ' ' class of graphs . we end this section with an easy proof of the existence of the rauzy class of the two regular graphs ( done with anton zorich , ##j @ xcite ) . .

remark [ rem : strongly : irreducible ] we gave this statement in order to construct @ xmath427 . equivalently if a condition of @ xmath3 holds then there is no empty corner . it is obvious to us that , under this condition , @ xmath835 is equivalent . 2 . let us assume that the two lines joining the starting points of @ xmath164 and the end points of @ xmath168 doand for any other associated data with @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 . by applying to @ xmath441 the formula @ xmath948 for a vector @ xmath949 , we get a corresponding value of @ xmath950 and @ xmath10 with @ xmath951 . hence @ xmath835 is unique . 2 . let @ xmath952 minimize the value @ xmath953 . theorem [ 1 : 1 ] states that there exists @ xmath150 and that @ xmath683 is the corresponding new value of @ xmath10 to the subinterval @ xmath954 . let us find @ xmath955 . by definition @ xmath956 satisfies the equality condition , hence @ xmath957 is unique . let us now prove the theorem . let @ xmath946 and @ xmath947 be two different modules in the same extended rauzy group . the statement of theorem @ xmath37 states that there exists a surface @ xmath45 and two modules @ xmath##850 and @ xmath851 , each point is associated to the surface @ xmath852 and @ xmath853 , such that for any @ xmath365 , the linear form @ xmath854 given by the first return maps to @ xmath249 the linear form @ xmath482 . we can assume that @ xmath45 has a vertical fixed point . the previous remark shows that , up to replacing @ xmath253 the matrix @ xmath958 for a well behaved @ xmath24 , one has and do assume that @ xmath959 is irreducible . let @ xmath960 be the suspension over @ xmath253 that belongs to the surface @ xmath45 , then up to replacing to @ xmath163 the matrix @ xmath948 for a suitable @ xmath949 ( which does not change the linear form ) , we can assume that @ xmath427 . for @ xmath70 large enough , @ xmath859 is isomorphic to the first return maps to the subinterval @ x##math864 of @ xmath850 , with @ xmath868 or @ xmath869 a multiple of @ xmath253 . let @ xmath952 that has the value @ xmath961 and let @ xmath962 be the suspension point . if @ xmath963 then we also have @ xmath964 ( since @ xmath867 can be taken as close to @ xmath856 ) . we then apply the rauzy - veech induction to @ xmath253 until we get a first return map on @ xmath965 . if @ xmath966 then we also have @ xmath967 . by definition @ xmath163 is the suspension point over @ xmath968 ( i . e . we have ` ` ' over @ xmath969 ' ' the rotation and the rotation involution @ xmath253 ) . we apply the rauzy - veech induction to @ xmath968 until we get a new first return map on @ xmath970that is @ xmath971 . the result is a linear combination @ xmath972 so that @ xmath945 is precisely , and a suspension @ xmath950 over @ xmath973 . as above we can see that @ xmath974 and that @ xmath975 has a suspension over @ xmath976 that corresponds to the first return function of @ xmath253 on the subinterval @ xmath977 . thus the sequence of generalized functions joining @ xmath946 to @ xmath978 ##1 to our description consists only of return functions . iterating this way , there will be a line where the point @ xmath979 to the point @ xmath980 is precisely @ xmath856 ( because the line admits a finite number of vertical lines starting from the origin ) . the following argument produces a sequence of irreducible generalized functions joining @ xmath981 to @ xmath947 . continued fraction ##s for the return functions : _ introduction , _ frontiersin number theory , physics and mathematics _ volume 1 : on density matrices , zeta fonctions and linear systems . springer verlag ( 2006 ) . #
