one of the fundamental problems in the classification of complex surfaces is to find a new classification of complex surfaces of general type with @ xmath0 . in this paper we find new simply connected _ _ campedelli surfaces _ with an order , i . e . simply connected minimal complex surfaces of general type with @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 , that have an automorphism of order @ xmath5 . there has been a recent classification for complex surfaces of general type with @ xmath0 having an order ; a . j . keum - y . lee @ xcite , calabri - ciliberto - mendes # @ xcite , calabri - mendes ##i - pardini @ xcite , a . lee - y . lee @ xcite , rito @ xcite . a classification of _ numerical godeaux surfaces _ ( i . e . minimal complex surfaces of general type with @ xmath0 and @ xmath2 ) with an order is given by calabri - ciliberto - mendes # @ xcite . it is known that the dual space of a numerical godeaux surface and its involution is eithersimilar but birational to an enriques surface , and the bicanonical map of the numerical godeaux surface factors through the quotient map . however , the map is not involved in the study of numerical campedelli surfaces , because the bicanonical map does not factor through the quotient map ; cf . calabri - mendes lopes - pardini @ xcite . in general it may happen that the quotient is of general type . more precisely , let @ xmath6 be a numerical campedelli surface with an resolution @ xmath7 . if @ xmath7 has four fixed points and no fixed points , then the minimal resolution @ xmath8 of the surface @ xmath9 is a numerical godeaux surface and @ xmath7 has only four fixed points ; cf . barlow @ xcite . conversely , if @ xmath8 is of general type , then @ xmath7 has only four fixed points and no fixed points ; calabri - mendes lopez - pardini @ xcite . here are some examples of numerical campedelli surfaces @ xmath6 with an resolution @ xmath7 and only four fixedj . barlow @ xcite constructed examples with @ xmath10 . barlow @ xcite also constructed examples with @ xmath11 whose numerical resolution of the quotient of the lattice is the first example of a _ lattice or _ numerical godeaux surface . not all catanese elliptic curves @ xcite have both an involution and @ xmath12 . mendes calabri , mendes lopes , and pardini @ xcite constructed a numerical campedelli surface with lattice @ xmath13 and other examples . frapporti @ xcite proved that there is an example having only two fixed points of the numerical campedelli surface with @ xmath14 constructed first by bauer - catanese - grunewald - pignatelli @ xcite . it is known that the values of the algebraic symmetry groups of numerical campedelli surfaces are at lattice @ xmath15 and the dihedral groups @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 can also be determined . finally , the general conjecture for numerical campedelli surfaces with @ xmath18 was settled by the construction of examples with @ xmath19 ; frapporti @ xcite and h . .- j . lee @ xcite . hence it would be an easy task to find numerical campedelli surfaces with an involution with @ xmath20 for each fundamental group @ xmath21 with @ xmath22 . but we are concerned with the simply connected case because the fundamental groups of all the known surfaces with an involution have finite order : @ xmath23 . thus the first example of _ simply connected _ numerical campedelli surfaces is very simple ( j . lee - k . park ) , and we have no doubt about the existence of an involution in their case . the main result of this paper is : there exist simply connected minimal complex surfaces @ xmath6 of general type with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 which have an involution @ xmath7 such that the minimal resolution @ xmath8 of the quotient @ xmath9 is a simply connected minimal complex surface of general type with @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 . we also know that the minimal resolution @ xmath8 of the group @ xmath9 is a smooth deformation ##s of dimension @ xmath28 corresponding to deformations @xmath29 of @ xmath8 such that its minimal resolution @ xmath30 is the minimal resolution of the resolution @ xmath31 of a numerical campedelli surface @ xmath32 by the involution @ xmath33 ; theorem [ proposition : invariant - part ] . in particular , we showed that the resolution @ xmath8 should be always simply connected if the double cover @ xmath6 is always simply connected ; theorem [ proposition : simply - connected = > simply - connected ] . thus barlow @ xcite showed that if the resolution @ xmath8 is a simply connected global godeaux surface then the minimal order of the algebraic group action of the double cover @ xmath6 is @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 , @ xmath36 , @ xmath37 , or @ xmath15 . as far as we know , the resolution of barlow @ xcite was the first example whose quotient is simply connected . it was @ xmath38 as mentioned above . hence we find an example with @ xmath39 . hence it would be an intriguing problem in this case to find an example with @ xmath40 . the orderto construct the examples , we combine a universal algorithm and an @ xmath3 - gorenstein smoothing method developed by k . lee - k . park . first we construct singular surfaces by cutting up curves and then smoothing them on a specific optimal singular surface . these singular surfaces grow by contracting certain @ xmath41 - curves . if we contract all of the @ xmath41 - curves , we get a stable surface @ xmath42 in the sense of kollr shepherd - barron @ xcite , and we prove that the space of @ xmath3 - gorenstein deformations of @ xmath42 is finite and @ xmath43 dimensional ; proposition [ propsotion : stable - godeaux ] . a ( @ xmath3 - gorenstein ) deformation of @ xmath42 in this space produces simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces . in particular , the deformation of @ xmath42 gives the existence of a three dimensional family of simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces with two @ xmath41 - curves ; proposition [ corollary : stability ] . we also prove that a three dimensional deformation in this space produces simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces with a @ xmath5 - divisible di##visor consisting of four disjoint @ xmath41 - curves ; theorem [ theorem : smooth - smoothing - of - points ] and theorem [ theorem : invariant - part ] . these numerical godeaux surfaces are used to compute the numerical campedelli surfaces with an extension . the corresponding numerical campedelli surfaces are obtained by finding smooth sections of the numerical godeaux surfaces , and the four distinct @ xmath41 - curves ; theorem [ theorem : campedelli ] . on the other hand we can also use the campedelli surface obtained from a singular elliptic surface @ xmath44 . this comes from setting up points and cutting curves on a compact singular elliptic surface ; theorem [ theorem : campexplicit ] . the @ xmath3 - gorenstein space of points of @ xmath44 is smooth and @ xmath45 dimensional ; theorem [ proposition : q - campedelli ] . in the godeaux and campedelli cases we use @ xmath46 to find the local - to - global coordinates to deform them ; theorem [ theorem : h2 ( ty ) = 0 ] and theorem [ theorem : h2 ( ty ) = 0 ] . this is a new result ( theorem[ see : burns - wahl ] ) which is a result of burns - wahl @ xcite ##s the set of first n elements of a singular ##ity curve with no rational double points . self - quotient curve ( located at @ xmath47 of ) @ xmath48 , where @ xmath49 with @ xmath50 . @ xmath51 - th ##ratic form of @ xmath34 , @ xmath52 , and @ xmath53 , and denoted by @ xmath54 . @ xmath55 . @ xmath56 . a @ xmath57 - curve ( or @ xmath41 - curve ) on a smooth curve is an equation @ xmath58 with self - intersection @ xmath59 ( respectively , @ xmath60 ) . in this article we use the first letter to denote the curve and its proper genus under a birational transformation . a curve of genus @ xmath61 is a quotient curve which admits an @ xmath3 - gorenstein - parameter ##ization . they are all rational double points . @ xmath62 with @ xmath63 and @ x##math64 ; see kollr . - barron @ xcite . for the normal form @ xmath6 its normal form @ xmath65 is @ xmath66 . the form of @ xmath67 is @ xmath68 . the authors would like to thank professor yongnam kim for the help during the work , the editing of the original paper , and other helpful comments . the authors also like to thank professor jenia tevelev for making a contribution in the original version of this paper , and the secretary general for the work on the proof of proposition 3 . 7 which makes it simpler . heesang park was supported by basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) grant funded by the korean government ( 2011 - 0012111 ) . dongsoo shin was supported by basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) grant funded by the korean government ( 2010 - 0002678 ) . giancarlo urza was supported by the fondecyt inicio grant funded by the chilean government ( 11110047 ) . in this paper we construct a family of simply connected generalized godeaux functions having a @ xmath5 - divisible di##visor construction of two disjoint @ xmath41 - surfaces by constructing the singular surface @ xmath69 ; theorem [ theorem : smooth - intersection - of - curves ] . this is the equivalent to constructing the campedelli surfaces with the involution . in addition , we construct the explicit stable model of the singular surface @ xmath69 . in particular , we construct a non - projective surface @ xmath42 with the curves @ xmath70 , @ xmath70 , @ xmath71 , @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 ample . thus @ xmath42 is a singular surface ( cf . kollr - garcia - barron @ xcite , barron @ xcite ) . we also show that the versal @ xmath3 - gorenstein - smoothing @ xmath74 ( cf . barron @ xcite ) is compact and @ xmath43 dimensional , and that the @ xmath3 - gorenstein smoothings of @ xmath42 are simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces . in particular , this means that there are simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces whose stable model is precisely four @ xmath70 -; theorem [ theorem : godeaux ] . furthermore the four - curve @ @ xmath74 has the following simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces with a @ xmath5 - smooth divisor consisting of the @ @ xmath41 - surfaces ; theorem [ theorem : invariant - smoothing - of - curves ] and theorem [ theorem : invariant - convergence ] . we start with a rational elliptic surface @ xmath75 with an @ xmath76 - singular fiber , an @ xmath77 - singular fiber , and a nodal point ##ities . in fact we will find the first rational elliptic surface @ xmath75 in the papers h . shin - h . shin @ xcite . first , we need to sketch the geometry of @ xmath75 to show the smooth ##ness that can be used to construct the elliptic surfaces @ xmath69 and @ xmath42 . let @ xmath78 , @ xmath79 , @ xmath80 , and @ xmath81 be lines in @ xmath82 and let @ xmath83 be a smooth conic in @ xmath82 given bythe following equations . they intersect again in figure [ 1 : 1 ] . @ xmath84 we obtain the pencil of cubics @ xmath85 \ { \ mathbb { cp } ^ { \ } \ ] ] generated by the two elliptic curves @ xmath86 and @ xmath87 . this pencil has four singular points @ xmath88 , @ xmath89 , @ xmath90 , @ xmath91 , and three singular points corresponding to @ xmath92 = [ 1 : 0 ] , [ 1 : 1 ] , [ 1 : 2 \ sqrt { 3 } ] , [ 2 : - 3 \ sqrt { 4 } ] $ ] . the other two singular points are nodal points , denoted by @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 $ . they have nodes [ @ xmath95 $ ] and @ xmath96 $ ] , respectively . in order to obtain a complete elliptic curve @ xmath75 from the pencil , we remove all the vertices ( including the singular base - points ) of the pencil by blowing - up @ xmath15 times as needed . we first blow up at the base@ xmath88 , @ xmath89 , @ xmath90 , @ xmath91 . let @ xmath97 , @ xmath98 , @ xmath99 , @ xmath100 be the exceptional divisors over @ xmath88 , @ xmath89 , @ xmath90 , @ xmath91 , respectively . we blow up again at the intersection points @ xmath101 , @ xmath102 , @ xmath103 . let @ xmath104 , @ xmath105 , @ xmath106 be the exceptional ##s over the intersection points , respectively . we then blow up at the two points @ xmath107 and @ xmath108 . let @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 be the exceptional ##ities over the blow - up points . we then construct a new elliptic surface @ xmath111 , @ xmath58 ;
