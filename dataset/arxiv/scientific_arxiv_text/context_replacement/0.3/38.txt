in single - mode photonic crystal fibers ( pcf ) the air - silica microstructured cladding ( see ref . [ fig1 ] ) gives rise to a number of novel properties @ xcite including large - surface area ( lma ) non - single mode bending @ xcite . though pcfs typically have optical properties very different from that of standard fibers they of course share many of the overall properties such as the resistance of the fibers to macro - bending . macrobending - induced attenuation in pcfs has been addressed both physically as well as theoretically / theoretically in a number of experiments @ xcite . however , measuring micro - loss is no simple task and often requires a direct numerical solution of the s equations as well as use of a phenomenological free parameter , _ e . g . _ _ _ core radius . in this paper we revisit the subject and show how macro - bending loss measurements in high - quality pcfs can be made with high accuracy using easy - to - evaluate empirical relations . measurements of macro - bending induced loss in photonic crystal fibers have been made using various approaches including m - method for bent standard fibers @ xcite , fiber - quality criteria @ xcite, and phenomenological ##ly is the z - axis of @ xcite . here , we also use the k - theory of sakai and kimura @ xcite , in addition to refs . @ xcite we make a linear transformation of optical - fiber parameters such as @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 , and @ xmath0 @ xcite to the parameters appropriate to low - index optical pcfs with a cubic lattice of organic molecules . in the low - effective case , we use ( see figure ) @ xmath3 for the beta - decay , @ xmath4 , for the absorption . for the transformation to the large - index @ xmath5 should be multiplied by @ xmath6 . in ref . ( [ alpha _ lma ] ) , @ xmath7 is the core radius , @ xmath8 is the core radius @ xcite , @ xmath9 is the radius of silica , and @ xmath10 is the newly discovered effective v - parameter of a pcf @ xcite . the strength of our transformation is that it has no free parameters ( such as the effective core radius ) and furthermore empirical expressions , based only on @ xmath##11 and @ xmath12 , have been published , for example @ xmath8 and @ xmath13 @ xcite . from the argument @ xmath14 we can define the linear dependence of the critical bending radius @ xmath15 . the dependence increases significantly when the argument is greater than 1 and thus we may define the critical bending radius from @ xmath16 where @ xmath17 . typically the pcf is operated according to cut - back where @ xmath18 @ xcite so that the result may be expressed as @ xmath19 this dependence was first reported and later confirmed by birks _ et al . _ @ xcite and recently a pre - factor of near unity was also demonstrated experimentally in ref . we have constructed three lma fibers by the stack - and - core method and characterized them using the linear cut - back method . all three fibers have a single air - hole , and a solid core formed by a single small air - hole in the center of the structure , see fig . [ fig1 ] . for the lma - fiber critical - bending radius has been measured for the values of r = 5 cm and r = 10 cm and the results are shown in ref. the results of fig . ( [ @ _ lma ] ) are also included . it is clear that the results are based on the empirical relations for @ xmath8 and @ xmath13 provided in refs . @ xcite and @ xcite , and therefore do not require any numerical calculations . the results are shown in ref . [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] for the lma - 30 and lma - 35 models , respectively . the pcf , in general , has both a short and long - wavelength bend - edge . however , the results given here only indicate a short - wavelength bend - edge . the reason for this is that the long - wavelength bend - edge occurs for @ xmath20 @ xcite . for the lma - pcfs it is only observed in the semi - transparent wavelength regime of silica . in conclusion we have shown that macro - bending frequency response for high - quality pcfs can be calculated with good accuracy from easy - to - evaluate empirical models with only @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 as input parameters . since macro - bending attenuation for many purposes and applications is the limiting factor we hope that the present results will be useful for practical applications ofboth methods are photonic - based . the starting point is the zero - loss approximation for the optical curvature of the standard - fiber @ xcite @ xmath23 where @ xmath8 is the effective length , @ xmath24 is the bending length , @ xmath7 is the bending radius , and the standard - fiber parameters are given by @ xcite @ xmath25 combining these parameters into 1 . ( [ alpha1 ] ) we get @ xmath26 in the relevant case where @ xmath27 . 2 , @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 and eqs . ( [ alpha _ lma ] ) and ( [ alpha _ pcf ] ) have been introduced . for large - mode optical fibers we have a further simplification for the optical propagation constant ; using that @ xmath30 we get at eq .
