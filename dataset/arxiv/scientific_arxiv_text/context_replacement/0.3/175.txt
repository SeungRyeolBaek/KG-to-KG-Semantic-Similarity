apart from the innocuous _ sequence , @ xmath0 which determines a sequence of numbers with absolute values @ xmath1 these numbers will be called _ pseudo - factorials _ , since the omission of the _ alternation @ xmath2 this sequence yields the sequence of numbers , @ xmath3 at the expense of one of us ( bacher , sloane 2004 ) , they have been included as sequence * a098777 * in the _ on - line encyclopedia of _ numbers _ @ xcite , which was also written by sloane and a host of other contributors . the purpose of this note is to show that these numbers , while not unique , have a number of interesting properties . the _ exponential _ function _ , @ xmath4 is central to our discussion . ( the fact that the absolute values @ xmath5 are determined by [UNK] implies that @ xmath6 is exponential at least once @ xmath7 . ) we first consider the relation between @ xmath6 and exponential function of a sequence published by john cardew dixon in 1890 ( _ vide _ @ xcite ) , and then the reduction to the more general weierstraexamples of @ xmath8functions : this forms the framework of sections [ dixon - sec ] and [ weier - sec ] . a further consequence of the above result , set out in section [ lat - sec ] , is the expression of pseudo - factorials as sums over a hexagonal matrix . here , we define a continued fraction of a finite type , corresponding to the _ _ generating function _ of pseudo - factorials , @ xmath9 to be expressed in the form of formal power series since the constant of convergence is 0 . to see : @ xmath10 where the coefficients are successively @ xmath11 , and the coefficients are @ xmath12 . such a power sequence of order _ , what is known as a _ jacobi fraction _ is somewhat unusual . the fraction was first discovered by using it . sections [ sradd - sec ] [ proofadd - sec ] is the main subject of the following paper . finally , the convergents of the continued fraction can be made explicit , via generating functions : this is equivalent to what appears to be a new class of ` ` orthogonal polynomials ' ' in the work of lomont brillhart @ xcite; see section [ ortho - sec ] . from section [ cong - sec ] , we then get the rest of the recent results , in the form of hankel determinant properties and the general properties of pseudo - factorials . as was suggested by a friend and by the editor of _ the ramanujan journal _ , we have a few comments as to the reasons for this , such as the present one . the primary motivation is to get a deeper understanding of a still mysterious class of continued fraction , the ones that have coefficients that are polynomial ( or rational ) functions in the s @ xmath13 . this very interesting but somewhat obscure class of continuous functions seems to have been first noticed by pollaczek s @ xcite . it is important to note that apery ##c - s @ xcite , which has led to the irrationality test of the s @ xmath14 , has rational coefficients and sextic coefficients , a property also shared by the conrad continued fractions @ xcite relative to the dixonian s @ xmath15 , themselves closely related to pseudo - factorials ( section [ dixon - sec ] ) . our own continued fraction ( theorem[ main - math ] ) and pollaczek in a slightly different sense : it has integer coefficients , but modulated by an unsual periodicity of order 2 . in another register , the relation of elliptic functions to continued fraction is an ancient subject , going back at least to eisenstein , stieljes , milne , and ramanujan . whereas the @ xmath16series and @ xmath17function aspects are not immediately relevant to our discussion , we may note that the continued fraction associated to the jacobian functions @ xmath18 have additional properties : together with the hankel determinant product properties that they imply , they have been used by conway in his penetrating study @ xcite of representations of integers as representations of @ xmath19 or @ xmath20 , or triangular numbers . in this spirit , we give some useful hankel determinant products in section [ cong - math ] , but we leave to others the task of determining whether they are of any practical use . the class of orthogonal polynomials associated to the continued fraction , whose coefficients are polynomials - in - the - plane , is also of interest . many instances of this degree have been given by chihara in @ x##cite . ` ` elliptic polynomials ' ' , that is , the polynomials associated with rings consisting of elliptic functions , a topic that goes back at least to carlitz @ xcite and they are the subject of the following article by lomont and brillhart @ xcite . the discovery of a new class ( section [ ortho - sec ] ) is of interest in this section . indeed , the pseudo - factorials are often associated with @ xmath21 , as seen from our study of lattice sums in section [ quad - sec ] . in this context , it is also worth noting a particular elliptic continued fraction for @ xmath22 , also obtained by tanguy rivoal @ xcite , which is of the sextic duodecimic type ( ! ) . this and previous observations highlight the fact that our understanding of an array of structures , including pollaczek continued fraction , elliptic functions , elliptic polynomials , and diophantine approximation properties , is still incomplete ; but they also show that ` ` hidden ' ' structures are yet to be discovered in this area ( see also our previous conclusion in section [ concl - sec ] ) . this also serves to establish the close relationship between pseudo - factorials and elliptic functions .the starting function is the exponential generating function given above ; it satisfies a functional equation , @ xmath23 which directly translates the linear recurrence . to solve @ xmath6 ##24 , take the functional equation and integrate it , so that @ xmath24 since , by definition , one has @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 . in order to solve the nonlinear functional equation , ` ` cleverly ' ' multiply ##es @ xmath27 to yield @ xmath28 which is enough to yield @ xmath29 with @ xmath30 a yet unspecified constant . equivalently , one has @ xmath31 which upon some more work yields @ xmath32 where use has been made of the initial value @ xmath33 . the constant @ xmath30 is finally obtained by means of a simple taylor expansion ( with @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 ) , to the extent that one will have @ xmath36 . ( the computations are those of @ xcite . ) in view of our subsequent treatment , it is possible to expand . a simple change of variables yields @ xmath37 where we have taken into account that @ xmath##36 . in this case , the fundamental integral is @ xmath38 ( the period of the function @ xmath39 defined below in ) , @ xmath40 where the evaluation follows from the classical eulerian integral @ xcite : @ xmath41 ( here , with @ xmath42 a continued fraction , indicates that @ xmath42 is an integral of @ xmath43 to the last digit of . ] , we find @ xmath44 . ) a further computation shows that @ xmath45 and that we can find @ xmath46 the function @ xmath6 can also be expressed in terms of the elliptic functions introduced by j . c . dixon in his first paper @ xcite . denote the function @ xmath47 by the function @ xmath48 here , the computation of and allows us to find @ xmath6 . [ x - 1 ] the exponential elliptic function of pseudo - elliptic functions @ xmath49 where the dixonian elliptic function @ xmath47 is as in and @ xmath38 is the constant . we can offer a few examples of dixonian elliptic . there is an a _ _ _ of ` `higher - order ' ' ' functions , @ xmath39 and @ xmath50 , where @ xmath39 and @ xmath50 are functions of a sine and a tangent function , respectively . their values can be derived from basic equations , first developed by dixon , by and flajolet @ xcite , starting with the first equation , @ xmath51 and initial conditions @ xmath52 , @ xmath53 . ( see also the work of lundberg @ xcite and the later work of lindquist and peetre @ xcite for a yet more general derivation . ) for the record , we note that @ xmath54 whose coefficients ( @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 ) are respectively * a104133 * and * a104134 * of sloane _ _ _ _ . the works of dixon and flajolet @ xcite give continued fraction ##s for the two rational functions of these coefficients , and these are then extended to the values of @ xmath15 at @ xmath57 , and _ _ _ at @ xmath58 , as well . finally , we note that , by the definition and the, we have the pair @ xmath59 such that the pair @ xmath60 parametrizes the _ fermat cubic _ @ xmath61 , by the polynomial @ xmath62 , which is of degree 2 . it is _ a priori _ possible to reduce the _ generating function @ xmath6 of k - polynomials to any of the several canonical pairs of generating functions . first , we know , by using methods similar to the one of the previous section , how to arrive immediately at an expression for the weierstra function @ xmath8 . we recall that this function @ xmath63 is classically defined by the ordinary differential equation @ xcite @ xmath64 , with the boundary condition @ xmath65 as @ xmath66 . by contrast , the pair @ xmath67 parametrizes the elliptic curve @ xmath68 , with equation @ xmath69 . the starting point is the linear relation , namely , @ xmath70 . we then obtain the pair @ xmath71 the identity is obtained by assuming that the derivative of the right - hand side is 1 , @ xmath72( the following equation : ) , combined with the additional condition @ xmath33 . 2 , we have @ xmath73 again by means of . now , @ xmath74 the first direct connection is given by the linear relation @ xmath75 which is also of the weierstra ##ss . to prove this , it suffices to square the two sides of the equation and , then square the sides . equation ( 2 ) then shows that @ xmath76 is directly related to the elliptic curve @ xmath77 . by @ xmath78 the curve @ xmath77 contains six integral points , since it is known that the mordell curve @ xmath79 contains six integral points ; see , for instance , the simath polynomials that are found at www . www . metro - manila . ac . jp / simath / mordell / mordell + . ] ( with the point at infinity corresponding to the identity element of the fundamental group ) is a cyclic group of order 8 . the non - singular points of this group are : @ xmath80 ( of order @ xmath81 ) , @ xmath82 ( of order @ xmath8##3 ) and @ xmath84 ( of order @ xmath85 ) . since @ xmath86 , the index @ xmath76 is the integral of the weierstra function @ xmath8 to the 0 - @ xmath81 - th element @ xmath80 of @ xmath77 . the following algorithm recovers @ xmath6 from @ xmath87 and is the main result of this section .

we now call it the ` ` primary ' ' hexagonal lattice . there are two generators of @ xmath6 in the fundamental plane , at @ xmath157 and @ xmath158 , which , upon multiplication by @ xmath131 , form the ` ` secondary ' ' cubic lattice . the generator of @ xmath6 ( formed from and ) , is now found to be of the form @ xmat##h159 gives a result of the form @ xmath160 $ ] , which corresponds to the 3colouring of the regular cubic lattice ( since @ xmath161 is the square root of unity ) . the corresponding continued fraction result results for @ xmath6 . similarly , the factf $ ] gives the value of @ xmath162 using the following power series or analytic function @ xmath163 . ] that , for @ xmath124 , @ xmath164 \ left ( \ frac { 1 } { z - a } + \ frac { 1 } { a } + \ frac { z } { a ^ n } \ right ) = - \ frac { 1 } { a ^ { n + 1 } } . \ ] ] gives the corresponding 3 - sum result for @ xmath121 . the representation of the 3 - factorials is the 3 - dimensional representation of spherical and euler numbers , and that is relative to the hexagonal lattice . it may be of interest to investigate the continued fraction relative to the hexagonal lattice ##s . it is also of interest that the representations of the ` ` lemniscatic' ' functions , related to the square root , have been introduced by hurwitz @ xcite . this section attempts to develop the computational technology needed to develop an ordinary continued fraction expansion from an addition formula of a given form . an experimental approach as to pseudo - sums follows , in section [ experadd - sec ] . we can then reap the crop in section [ proofadd - sec ] and finally obtain our main continued fraction expansion ( section [ main - thm ] ) . stieltjes and rogers independently discovered that the continued fraction expansion of an ordinary generating function , @ xmath165 , is closely related to _ addition formula _ satisfied by the corresponding ordinary generating function , @ xmath166 . consider , by definition . let @ xmath167 be a formal power series . it is said to satisfy an _ addition formula of the stieltjes addition formula _ if there are nonzero sums @ xmath168 and a power series @ xmath169 , such that @ xmath170 where @ xmath171 has value @ xmath123 and is normalized by @ xmath172 . in , the valuation depends on@ xmath173 is essential , the notation @ xmath174 being a useful convenience for what follows . the addition formula gives rise to an algorithm for finding the @ xmath175 , and @ xmath176 , either directly or via the taylor expansion . first , setting @ xmath177 in the addition formula means that @ xmath176 will be equal to @ xmath178 ( this makes use of the normalization @ xmath179 ) . second , suppose that the coefficients @ xmath180 and the coefficients @ xmath181 have already been found . then , by setting @ xmath182 in the addition formula with respect to @ xmath183 , then setting @ xmath177 , one finds @ xmath184 _ { x = x } = \ int _ \ omega \ varphi _ \ omega ( x ) . \ ] ] upon finding the coefficients of @ xmath185 from the taylor expansion of both sides , we find that _ at _ _ the nonzero coefficient @ xmath186 can satisfy the equation , and the coefficients @ xmath187. once this choice has been made , the @ xmath188 is then identified as a linear combination of the previous @ xmath189 , together with that of @ xmath190 , and the process will continue . this property also determines the broad class of functions for which the @ xmath175 results : _ x @ xmath175 belongs to the vector space generated over @ xmath191 by the partial derivatives @ xmath192 of the function @ xmath176 _ . this construction , albeit suboptimal from a mathematical point of view , allows one to work with addition formulae related to the generating function of a given number , @ xmath193 , a technique that will be very valuable in the [ experadd - sec ] . addition formulas of the stieltjes rogers type are roughly equivalent to continued fraction expansions as shown in the figure : theorem ##s attributed to stieltjes @ xcite and rogers @ xcite ;

thm ] , provides the continued fraction expansion : @ xmath208 where the coefficients @ xmath209 , are defined , as sums of consecutive real numbers . the followingof these terms reflects the definition of @ xmath210 . the [ sradd - 2 ] has shown that , in order to use the definition of a continued fraction expansion for n - series , we need to find a suitable constrained addition formula for their main coordinate function @ xmath6 , which is known . we looked first in an experimental manner in order to infer the likely shape of such an addition formula . once this had been done , the study of our general continued fraction reduces to purely theoretical verifications to be carried out in the next section . a new idea that comes to mind is to look for an addition formula of a form similar to the original formula , namely , @ xmath211 for the function ( or power series ) @ xmath212 . however , all such formulae can only come from the class of elliptic functions that have _ five _ parametrized coefficients , of which two are @ xmath213 ( this is a result of a classification of orthogonal coordinate functions due to meixner @ xcite . ) obviously , elliptic functions are not amongst this group . another source of inspiration is a continued fraction relative to elliptic functions , which is also due to stiel##tjes and smith . with @ xmath18 the jacobian generating functions , as classically defined , where we have the form @ xmath214 therefore , we have @ xmath215 , for example @ xcite . this can be put into an ' stieltjes ' form ( up to 1 ) , namely , @ xmath216 corresponding to the continued fraction expansion @ xmath217 where @ xmath218 \ cn ( x ) $ ] . we now refer to the continued fraction expansion corresponding to pseudo - polynomials which , by using [ sradd - 1 ] , is now the general addition formula for @ xmath6 . based on experiments under the above system as well as on results from the classical and jacobian cases , we are looking for an addition formula of the form @ xmath219 for the power series @ xmath220 , with ( at most ) @ xmath221 , and @ xmath222 all in @ xmath223 . since a constant factor is included in the continued fraction , it is necessary that to prove that @ xmath224 , @ xmath225 ,which then leads to the ` ` even - numbered ' ' addition formula , @ xmath226 where @ xmath227 \ xi ( w ) $ ] and @ xmath228 \ xi ( w ) $ ] . in the case of , we can look for an addition formula of the form @ xmath229 where @ xmath230 implies that the ratio @ xmath231 is a constant . the pleasant effect of the above formulas and is that their plausibility can be effectively verified . indeed , from the previous section , we have found an algorithm that can determine the ( constant ) @ xmath232 up to @ xmath233 , this to any given result . one then proceeds to find that @ xmath234 each of these relations for half a dozen of the @ xmath235 and till series in the range 50100 tells us that we are on the right track . in addition , we found out that @ xmath236 up to @ xmath237 , the series starting from @ xmath238 and , the ratio @ xmath239 that results in will be equal to @ xmath##240 of the addition formula , whose expression appears as @ xmath241 . that function @ xmath240 must itself , on certain grounds , be a linear combination of @ xmath6 and @ xmath242 without a factor , so that @ xmath243 finally , assuming the second law of the coefficients of the continued fraction to hold true , we can deduce the only possible values of the @ xmath244 and @ xmath245 coefficients . the function @ xmath246 is then defined on the basis of the fact that @ xmath247 must be a linear combination of @ xmath248 . all in all , every ingredient of the addition formula of type is in question , and we are thus led to find an addition formula for @ xmath6 @ xmath249 which we shall use in the next section . at this point , we know that establishing the continued fraction equivalent to the ordinary generating function @ xmath250 of k - factorials amounts to deciding the value of the conjectured addition formula for the ordinary generating function @ xmath6 . the method we have is a computer - assisted one . if weshall note , it only performs basic algebraic manipulations ; namely , elementary function operations , normalizations , multiplication , as well as elementary polynomial operations . the calculations are performed using the maple computer algebra system ( version 11 ) . without any attempt at optimization ( we have designed our program to rely only on the most basic algebraic equations ) , the actual verification amounts to the average amount of a few billion math instructions currently , just a few seconds of cpu time .
