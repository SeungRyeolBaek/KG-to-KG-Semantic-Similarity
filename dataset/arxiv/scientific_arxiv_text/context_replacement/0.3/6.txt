[ main _ 2 ] @ xmath246 the proof is similar to that of proposition [ main _ 1 ] . we see below that proposition [ main _ 2 ] is much more useful than proposition [ main _ 2 ] in the context of thedilated @ xmath0 - sine ##2 . however the latter is needed for the calculation of the main _ [ inprovement ] . it is of course natural to ask what result can be derived from the corresponding result in lemma [ toep ] . for @ xmath247 we have @ xmath248 . but the same calculation as in the case of the [ main _ 1 ] and [ main _ 2 ] would lead to , and in this case there is no consequence . our main goal in this section is to establish that the inverse of the function associated to the function @ xmath21 is not beyond the limit of that of . we start by recalling a calculation which was performed in the case of ( * ? ? ? * . 4 . 2 ) and which will be invoked several times over . let @ xmath249 be the inverse function of @ xmath250 . then @ xmath251 indeed , dividing by x , and applying the variable of x to @ xmath252 , @ xmath253 ' \ to ( x \ to x ) { \ mathrm { x } } \ \ \ & = - \ frac{ 2 \ sqrt { 2 } \ pi _ { p , q } } { 1 ^ 2 \ n ^ 2 } \ int _ j ^ 1 \ right \ left ( \ frac { j \ right } { \ pi _ { p , q } } } ( 2 ) \ right ) { \ mathrm { d } } t . \ dot { aligned } \ ] ] [ inprovement ] @ @ xmath57 . suppose that the pair @ xmath254 is such that the following two conditions are satisfied 1 .

[ beyond2 ] for @ xmath57 and @ xmath423 . note that 1 . @ xmath290 , @ xmath245 and @ xmath424 for each other @ xmath425 . 2 . @ xmath426 . if @ xmath427 then @ xmath43 is true . suppose that the hypotheses are and . the combination of and gives @ xmath428 and @ xmath429 and . the result follows from . we will consider the combination of the two methods given in the previous section with those of the above @ xcite , @ xcite and @ xcite . for this , we consider various approximate approximations of @ xmath207 and @ xmath430 . these methods are based on the following two formulae : @ xmath431 and @ xmath432 where @ xmath433 is the generalized beta function , @ xmath434 is the gamma function and @ xmath43##5 is the correlation function . now , by following up the procedure used by @ xcite for the case of ( * ? ? ? * ( 4 . 0 ) ) , it follows that @ xmath436 { \ mathrm { d } } x \ \ & = \ frac { \ sqrt { 1 } } { \ pi } \ int _ x ^ 2 \ ! \ ! [ \ ! \ left ( \ frac { \ pi } { x } \ { \ mathcal { p } } \ ! \ ! \ left ( \ frac1q , \ frac { p - q } { 1 } ; x ^ 2 \ right ) \ left ) \ right ] { \ mathrm { d } } \ . \ pi { x } \ ] ] . the values of @ xmath37 , @ xmath437 and the value of @ xmath438 are used only for statistical analysis , so we have not shown that @ xmath439 . green indicates relevance to the special case @ xmath20 . white indicates relevance for the case @ xmath57 . [ impro _ x _ 0 = 1 ] , p = 241 ] let us start with the value of @2 . see also [ impro _ p _ p = 1 ] . as stated in the figure , @ xmath440 for @ xmath41 . the condition @ xmath441 is true for all @ xmath442 where @ xmath443 . the corresponding condition @ xmath444 for all @ xmath445 whenever @ xmath446 . then we have to return to @ xmath447 , for a further verification of the existence of and [ beyond2 ] for @ xmath448 . now we have the following . 1 . for @ xmath449 , the conditions are true only for @ xmath450 where @ xmath451 . 2 . for @ xmath447 the condition will hold only for @ xmath452 where @ xmath68 . this means that that the condition for invertibility of @ xmath43 in the hilbert space defined for @ xmath14 is at most @ xmath453 . now we have the general formula . the regions shown in figure [ th10ab ] and [ th10c ] correspond to regions of the @ xmath44 - thfor @ xmath454 . curves in figure [ th10ab ] that are colored black are relevant only to the color space of @ xmath57 . these lines correspond to @ xmath20 . figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( a ) _ and the line shown on figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( b ) _ , are two solid ( dashed ) lines . one that shows the limit of proof of theorem [ impro _ implicit ] - [ aimplicit ] and one that shows the limit of proof of the proof of @ xcite . the dashed line indicates where occurs . to the left of that line is not possible . there are two shaded regions of different length , _ ( a ) _ , which indicate where @ xmath455 and where @ xmath456 for @ xmath208 . theorem [ beyond2 ] is not applicable to the middle of these regions . we also show the point where @ xmath457 and @ xmath458 . the line forms part of the boundary of this region . the second dashed line corresponds to the limit of proof of theorem [ impro _ implicit ] - [ bimplicit ]is also included in figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( c ) ( d ) _ . to the right of that figure , in the same figure , we see that @ xmath43 is also for @ xmath57 . the figure in figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( d ) _ clearly illustrates the difference between theorem [ impro _ explicit ] - [ aimplicit ] and theorem [ impro _ implicit ] - [ bimplicit ] in this @ xmath57 figure . the @ xmath459 is the point of intersection for the points where @ xmath29 for @ xmath123 . these points are included in figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( d ) _ is for @ xmath460 and @ xmath461 . in this figure , we also see the boundary of the region where @ xmath455 and the region where @ xmath456 is for @ xmath462 . note that the points for @ xmath463 and @ xmath458 are part of the boundary of the region . between _ ( d ) _ and _ ( c ) _ , the only curve that cuts the@ xmath16 axis for @ xmath464 corresponds to the region of where proposition [ beyond2 ] for @ xmath465 is true ( for @ xmath16 to the right of this line ) . the difference between the two further curves ( case @ xmath57 ) is that proposition [ beyond2 ] can also improve the threshold for basisness with respect to a possible consequence of proposition [ impro _ 1 ] - [ bimplicit ] . as we approach @ xmath466 , the value of the corresponding region moves to the left , like the blowups in figure [ th10ab ] - _ ( d ) _ and _ ( e ) _ . the two further curves in blue , shown close to the horizontal line , correspond to the precise value of the parameter @ xmath466 where proposition [ beyond2 ] allows a sense of invertibility for the set of values which explains the break up above . for @ xmath467 the region does not include the dashed dashed line , for @ xmath447 it does include this line . the region shown in blue indicates a specific place where corollary [ theorem _ 1 ] may not apply , allowing an interpretation in this casecitation needed . theorem [ th10c ] concerns the statement of theorem [ impro _ implicit ] - [ cimplicit ] . the small region shown in green is the only region where the former is true . as it happens , it appears that the properties of corollary [ main _ statement ] allow it to be useful for the invertibility of @ xmath43 in a region of @ xmath454 . but in the region shown in green , the upper bound on the riesz product coefficient of is sharper than that obtained from . part of the motivation for the proof of basisness for the family @ xmath21 in the region @ xmath470 is to do the fact that the constant coefficients of @ xmath471 are those of the family @ xmath472 . in this appendix we show that , indeed @ xmath473 such that @ xmath474 let @ xmath475 be the ( unique ) value , such that @ xmath476 then @ xmath477 let @ xmath478 be the line segment between the points @ xmath479 and @ xmath480 . there is a unique value @xmath481 such that @ xmath482 this equality is valid because of monotonicity of both sides of this equality , and it exists by definition . as all the terms involved are continuous in @ xmath16 , then also @ xmath483 is continuous in the domain @ xmath16 . moreover , @ xmath484 and , by taking the term defining @ xmath483 , we get @ xmath485 the right hand side , and hence the left hand side , approaches 0 as @ xmath388 . then , one ( and thus both ) of the two terms involved on the left should approach 0 . then @ xmath486 cover the domain which has a boundary ( ordered by ) @ xmath487 as @ xmath488 @ xmath489 \ { \ { 0 \ } ) \ { ( \ { 0 \ } \ { [ 0 , 1 ] ) $ ] in hausdorff space . then the graph of @ xmath486 approaches 0 as @ xmath388 . similarly , @ xmath486 covers the graph of @ xmath490 for @ xmath##491 . 1 @ xmath492 hence , there is a point @ xmath493 in the set of @ xmath494 such that @ xmath495 and @ xmath496 the proof of is completed from the fact that , since @ xmath494 is convex ( because the entire graph is convex ) , the piecewise linear interpolant of @ xmath494 for the set of points @ xmath497 has a value below that of @ xmath494 . the following computer code written in the open source languages octave and python can be used to perform some of the numerical calculations presented in this article . code for computing @ xmath207 with 10 -
