with significant research efforts being directed to the development of neurocomputers based on the structure of the brain , a paradigm shift is underway in the domain of computing based on the traditional von - neumann model . the @ xmath0 @ xcite , @ xmath1 @ xcite and the ibm @ xmath2 @ xcite are instances of recent computational neuromorphic projects that aim to develop brain - inspired computing platforms suitable for recognition ( image , video , sound ) , classification and learning problems . while most computation is based on the sequential fetch , decode and execute model , such neuromorphic computing platforms are massively parallel and data - driven and are particularly appealing for pattern recognition applications and neural network . to that end , researchers have proposed novel nanoelectronic devices where the underlying quantum mechanism provides a solution to the neural and synaptic functions performed in the brain . the main motivation behind the use of such non - von neumann non - cmos technologies in neural and computational devices stems from the fact that the direct interaction between the cmos transistors and the underlying neuroscience mechanisms results in significant area and energy overhead for a corresponding hardware device . a very recent instance is the simulation ofa cat model based on ibm - blue gene , where the power consumption is estimated to be of the order of a watt @ xmath3 @ xcite . while the power required to power the human brain can rise significantly as we move along the pathway in the animal kingdom , the power consumption in the human brain is only a few tens of watts . in a neuromorphic neural platform , synapses form the connections between neurons and their connections determine the strength of the signal transmitted between the neurons . the exact mechanisms that control the ` ` learning ' ' or ` ` plasticity ' ' of these neural networks are still under debate . meanwhile , researchers have started to study several different patterns observed in the network in nanoelectronic devices like phase change memories @ xcite , @ xmath4 memristors @ xcite and spintronic devices @ xcite , etc . however , majority of the studies have focused on non - volatile phase changes of the network in comparison to the spiking patterns of the neurons it connects corresponding to long - term memory @ xcite and the volatility of human neurons has been largely ignored . as a matter of fact , neuroscience studies performed in@ xcite have shown that synapses have an inherent memory mechanism where they undergo temporary plasticity , and then undergo long - term memory conditionally based on the strength of the incoming action potential . such volatile or meta - stable memory transition mechanisms can lead to neuromorphic architectures where the synaptic memory can adapt itself to a new environment since sections of the brain that have been not receiving frequent stimulus can be now activated and utilized to receive more accurate information . therefore , it is important to include these volatile memory transition mechanisms in a neuromorphic architecture in order to benefit from the computational power that such meta - stable memory plasticity mechanisms have to offer . [ drawing1 ] ( a ) demonstrates the basic mechanisms involved in these volatile synaptic transition mechanisms . during the transmission of an action potential from the pre - neurons to the post - neuron through the synapse , an influx of ionic species like @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 causes the release of neurotransmitters from the pre - to the post - neurons . this results in temporary strengthening of the ionic strength . however , in absence of the action potential , the ionic species concentration drops back to .equilibrium value and the synapse concentration increase . this phenomenon is known as short - term plasticity ( ltd ) @ xcite . however , if the action can occur slowly , the cells of the neurons do not have enough concentration to build up to the equilibrium value and this loss of concentration eventually results in long - term strengthening of the synaptic junction . this phenomenon is known as short - term potentiation ( ltp ) . while ltd is a meta - ##otic state and lasts for a very small time duration , ltp is a stable synaptic state which can last for hours , days or even years @ xcite . a similar discussion is valid for the case where there is a short - term decline in synaptic concentration with frequent stimulus and then the condition is referred to as long - term depression ( ltd ) . the stp and ltp mechanisms have been strongly correlated to the short - term memory ( ltd ) and long - term memory ( ltm ) models proposed by atkinson and shiffrin @ xcite ( fig . [ drawing1 ] ( 2 ) ) . this latter model partitions the working memory into an ltd and an ltm . on the arrival of the first stimulus , information is first processedin the stm . however , upon frequent rehearsal , information gets transferred to the lt . while the ` ` rehearsal ' ' phenomena occur at a slow rate in the stm , information can be stored for a much longer time in the lt . in order to overcome such volatile synaptic plasticity conditions , a nanoelectronic device is required that is able to undergo meta - stable phase transitions depending on the frequency of the input and to transition to a long - term stable stable state on frequent rehearsal . therefore , as for the memory space , strengthening and energy loss is a crucial requirement for such nanoelectronic synapses . in the next section , we will describe the mapping of the magnetization dynamics of the nanomagnet to the various electrical plasticity mechanisms present in the brain . let us now describe the device structure and mode of operation of an mtj @ xcite as shown in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( a ) . the tb consists of two thin layers separated by a tunneling oxide layer ( tb ) . the surface of one of the layers is magnetically ` ` pinned ' ' and hence it is termed as the ` ` pinning ' ' layer ( pl ) .the magnetization of the outer layer , known as the ` ` outer layer ' ' ( fl ) , can be manipulated by the high spin current @ xmath7 . the mtj structure has two distinct low resting states the low conductive ` ` anti - parallel ' ' orientation ( ap ) , where pl and fl magnetizations are opposite , and the high conductive ` ` parallel ' ' orientation ( hp ) , where the magnetization of the two layers is in the opposite direction . let us consider that the resting state of the mtj structure is in the high - ap state . for the stimulus stimulus ( s ) to flow from terminal t2 to terminal t1 , electrons will flow from terminal t1 to t2 and get spin - polarized by the pl of the mtj . subsequently , these spin - polarized electrons will move to orient the pl of the mtj ` ` parallel ' ' to the pl . it is worth noting here that the spin - release of the electrons in the mtj is analogous to the release of neurotransmitters in a biological cell . the ph and ltp effects exhibited in the mtj due to the spin - polarization of the excited electrons can be describedby the energy profile of the surface of the mtj . let the angle between the fl magnetization , @ xmath8 , and the pl ##ization , @ xmath9 , be given by @ xmath10 . the fl energy as a function of @ xmath10 has been shown in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( a ) where the two energy profile components ( @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 ) are given by the energy profile , @ xmath13 . during the transition from the ap state to the ap state , the fl has to transition from @ xmath12 to @ xmath11 . upon the introduction of an input stimulus , the fl magnetization goes ` ` up ' ' in the energy profile ( from the point 1 to point 2 in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( b ) ) . however , since point 2 is a meta - ap state , it keeps going ` ` down ' ' to point 1 , until the stimulus is removed . if the input stimulus is not persistent enough , the fl will try to transition back to the ap state after the stimulus . however , if the stimulus is repeated , the fl will not get enough energy to reach point 2 and ultimately will beand to overcome the energy barrier ( point 4 in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( a ) ) . it is worth noting here , that on crossing the energy barrier at @ xmath14 , it becomes progressively difficult for the mtj to exit stp and transition back to the initial ap state . this is in contrast with the standard model of working memory where it becomes increasingly difficult for the memory to ` ` forget ' ' information during transition from ap to ap . hence , once it has crossed the energy barrier , it must transition from the ap to the ltp state ( point 4 in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( b ) ) . the size of the mtj in the ltp state is dictated by the size of the energy barrier . the lifetime of the ltp state is exponentially related to the energy barrier @ xcite . for example , for an energy barrier of @ xmath15 years in this model , the ltp lifetime is @ xmath16 years while the lifetime can be calculated to be @ xmath17 years by using the barrier state of @ xmath18 . the lifetime can be varied by varying the energy barrier , or equivalently , volume of the mtj . the ap - ltpbehavior of the mtj can be also derived from the magnetic behavior of the pl described by landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) , with the equations to solve for the ground state . according to slonczewski @ xcite , @ xmath19 where , @ xmath20 is the unit vector of # ##s , @ xmath21 is the gyromagnetic ratio for fl , @ xmath22 is gilberts ' constant , @ xmath23 is the effective magnetic field . the magnetic anisotropy is for the pl . from @ xcite , @ xmath24 is the number of electrons in each layer of volume @ xmath25 ( @ xmath26 is saturation magnetization and @ xmath27 is bohr effect ) , and @ xmath28 is the electric noise induced by the input signal @ xmath29 ( @ xmath30 is the time - relaxation time of the pl ) . the noise is replaced by an additional electrical noise @ xcite , @ xmath31 , where @ xmath32 is the gaussian noise with zero mean and zero standard deviation , @ xmath33 isboltzmann constant , @ xmath34 is the input and @ xmath35 is the next time step . equation [ llg ] can be expressed by simple mathematical manipulations : , @ xmath36 hence , in the absence of an input , the magnetization of the device starts increasing due to integration of the input . however , in the absence of the input , it starts leaking current due to the first two terms in the rhs of the above equation . it is worth noting , that , like traditional fast circuits , frequency and amplitude of the input stimulus will also have an effect on the stp - ltp transition of the synapse . therefore , frequency of the input is a critical factor in this scenario . even if the total flux through the channel is same , the fl will conditionally change its activity if the frequency of the input is different . we see that this functionality is provided by mtjs by using llg models ( without the noise ) . the conductance of the mtj as a function of @ xmath10 can be represented by , @ xmath37 where , @ xmath38 ( @ xmath39 ) is the mtj conductance in the ac ( ap ) domain of .as shown in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( a ) , the mtj conductance undergoes meta - stable transition ( ts ) and is not able to undergo ltp when the time interval of the input pulses is short ( @ xmath40 ) . however , after frequent stimulation with time interval as @ xmath41 , the device undergoes ltp transition incrementally . [ drawing2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) show the interaction between sensory reinforcement and signal decay in an mtj structure that is crucial to implement ct and ltp in the device . we used simulation parameters to verify the ct and ltp mechanisms in the mtj structure based on the time interval of stimulations . the device simulation parameters were derived from experimental data @ xcite and have been shown in table i . [ table ] table i . device simulation parameters [ cols = " ^ , ^ " , ] + the mtj was limited to 10 ms , each stimulation produced a current transition of between @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 in duration . as shown in fig . [ drawing3 ] , the probability of ltp transition and the electrical conductance at the end of each stimulation decreased with decrease of the timecontrast between the stimuli . the dependence on the time interval can be further characterized by measurements relating to paired - stimulus response ( ppf : synaptic plasticity increase when a second stimulus encounters a first stimulus stimulus ) and post - stimulation potentiation ( ptp : total neural activity increment when a large number of such stimuli are received simultaneously ) @ xcite . [ drawing4 ] depicts such ppf ( after 2nd stimulus ) and ptp ( after 10th stimulus ) measurements for the mtj synapse with variations in the stimulation rate . the results closely resemble those obtained in the gap experiment @ xcite where ppf measurements revealed that there was a rapid synaptic activity increase when the stimulation rate was high , while ptp measurements indicated ltp transition on low stimulation with a fast decay in electrical conductivity with changes in the stimulation rate . thus , stimulation rate variability plays a critical role in the mtj synapse to determine the probability of ltp transition . the psychological effects of stm and ltm on the mtj synapses was further explored in the @ xmath44 ##2 experiment . the array was stimulated with a binary image of the purdue university .where a maximum of two pulses ( orders of magnitude @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 in duration ) was generated for each target pixel . the snapshots of the conductance changes of the memory array after each stimulus have been obtained for two different stimulation ##s of @ xmath47 and @ xmath48 respectively . while the memory array attempts to remember the displayed information right after stimulation , it fails to transfer to memory for the case @ xmath49 and the memory is subsequently lost @ xmath50 after stimulation . however , it is transferred to memory progressively for @ xmath51 . it is worth noting however , that the same amount of flux is transferred to the mtj in both cases . the simulation not only provides a # ##ization of the time evolution of a large array of mtj neurons as a result of stimulation but also provides tools for the design of complex neuromorphic systems exploiting the concepts of stm and ltm . researchers interested in the practical implementation of such types of spintronic devices are referred to ref . the advantages of this work over state - of - the - art approaches can be summarized as follows . this is the first experimental demonstration of st and ltp integration in an mtj2 . we studied the ratio of neurotransmitter release from a single cell to the total number of electrons in an mtj and performed extensive simulations to determine the effect of stimulus frequency on the ltp mechanism of such an mtj structure . there have been recent proposals of other emerging structures that can exhibit such stp - ltp mechanisms like @ xmath52 synapses @ xcite and @ xmath53 memristors @ xcite . however , it is worth noting here , that input stimulus frequencies are typically in the order of volts ( 0 . 3v in @ xcite and 80mv in @ xcite ) and response times are of the order of a few seconds ( 1ms ##v @ xcite and 0 . 5 ##m @ xcite ) . in contrast , similar behavior can be exhibited in mtj structures with much lower energy levels ( with the magnitudes of a few thousand @ xmath54 and duration of a few @ xmath55 ) . we believe that this work will be proof - of - concept work to realize the mtj synapses that could potentially pave the way for future ultra - low power intelligent neuromorphic systemsjournal of remote sensing . the work was funded in part by , center for spintronic materials , sensors , and network architectures ( c - net ) , the marco and darpa funded starnet project , by the microsoft research corporation , the national science foundation , intel corporation and by the national defense research and development faculty association . j . schemmel , m . fieres , and m . meier , _ _ neural networks , 2008 . ijcnn 2008 .
