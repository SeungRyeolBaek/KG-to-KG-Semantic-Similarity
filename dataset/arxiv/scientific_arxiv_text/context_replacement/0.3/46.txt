super symmetric galaxies ( csos ) are a class of extragalactic radio galaxies comprising about 3 % of flux - flow samples selected at radio wavelengths ( taylor , readhead , & pearson 1996 ; wilson & wilson 2001 ) . their defining feature is the presence of high luminosity jet components on both sides of a jet engine at sub - kiloparsec scales with little or no radio emission present . csos typically exhibit large hotspots which move outward at subluminal speeds ( owsianik & conway 1998 ; gugliucci et al . ) . en route , the core and the counter jet where they form , tend to move faster , and superluminal jets in the jets are observed in a few sources ( taylor , readhead & pearson 2000 ) . the jets can be similar or much brighter than the counterjets . csos on the whole have low radio emission , very low radio absorption and high core luminosities . their hosts are most general elliptical galaxies ( readhead et al . 1996 ) but there are a few notable exceptions identified with seyferts and quasars . the general consensus that has developed is that csos are young radio galaxies , with ages between 100 and 10000 years . since they were discovered for thebecause of relatively unbeamed bright - spots and lobes , their orientation on the sky is uncertain . orientation may still indicate the presence of detectable spin polarization ( gugliucci et al . 2007 ) , or emission from a gas associated with the molecular gas and dust cloud that surrounds the central engine and is thought to be oriented perpendicular to the jet axis ( schmidt et al . 2000 ; pihlstrm et al . 2003 ) . however , since the latter effects are less dominant , we have the added benefit of observing the jet from both sides of the jet . csos provide a good opportunity to determine the gravitational potential , and a direct measurement of the distance to an object can be made by observing angular velocity around it , if the intrinsic angular velocity can be ascertained directly . basically , it is the time scale of a laser ruler , with the only difference that the angular motion can be faster than light . from five years of observations of the cso 1946 + 708 . 5 ghz schmidt & vermeulen ( 1997 ) placed a lower value of h @ xmath4 @ xmath2 , and h @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 . we know what can belearned from continuing this process yields more comprehensive data . we can use this classification system , for which the geometry of the jet can be precisely determined , to probe the details of jet formation . kinematic ages for the radio jets in csos can be obtained by measuring the rotational period of the hot jet over time and comparing this to the initial jet separation ( owsianik & conway 1998 ; gugliucci et al . 2005 ) . at the present , the cso age distribution seems to be disproportionally biased towards younger sources . however , there are a number of other factors that need to be considered before the entire data set can be properly interpreted . older sources are well - covered by vlbi observations so that measuring the expansion becomes easier ; more slowly expanding sources require longer time baselines to obtain accurate estimates . in this article we present estimates of the cso 1946 + 708 Â± 16 years . it is of considerable interest to pursue this line of research to address the evolution of these sources . we assume @ xmath1 = # ##5 ##c @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 and the current cosmology assumes that x = 1 . 835 kpc and an expansion velocity of 1 km / y = 1 .- looking at the frequency ( 0 . 1008 ) of the radio source 1946 + 708 ( peck & taylor 2001 ) . the observations were carried out at 8 . 4 ghz and 9 . 4 ghz over the course of eight years , taken between 1995 june 22 , 1996 july 07 , 1998 july 06 , 1999 july 11 , 2001 july 17 , and at 9 . 4 ghz again in 2003 jan 24 / 2003 feb 10 , 2006 feb 8 , and 2008 feb 9 ( see table below ) . observations in 1995 , 1998 , and 2001 were observed using all ten elements of the vlba of the nrao , and observations from 2003 on were performed using the global array , all ten elements of the vlba , and the elements from the european vlbi network ( evn ) including the 100 m telescope at effelsberg , the westerbork global array , onsala , medicina , and from 2003 on , the telescope at noto . due to problems at the st . croix and long island stations , epochs in 1996 and 1999 were performed using two vlba elements each . problems in 2003 prevented effelsberg from participating . both right and left circular polarizations were recorded for the first two observations , andthe other three where observed only in right circular polarization . all three employed 2 bit sampling across if ##s of 8 mhz . the vlba correlator used 16 bit channels for each if during it ' s integration . we also include in our list the 15 ghz observations made between 1992 and 1995 by taylor & vermeulen ( 1997 ) , all of which are contemporaneous with the 8 . 4 and 15 ghz observations listed above . parallactic time errors resulting from the altitude - azimuth antenna operation were calculated using the aips task clcor . amplitude calibration for each station was derived from measurements of antenna heights and antenna temperatures during each operation . delays in the stations operation were calculated using the aips task fring ( schwab & taylor 1983 ) . analysis was performed by analyzing the multi - station data set , prior to the editing , imaging , deconvolution and self - calibration in difmap ( taylor , pearson , & taylor 1994 , 1995 ) . multiple rounds of both self - calibration and imaging were applied to each station before any attempt at amplitude self - calibration was made . the mathematical techniques developed in difmap were subsequently applied in aips toand phase corrections , to reduce the leakage terms between the rcp and lcp components and to account for residual phase differences between them . the analysis and self - calibration were performed in difmap . model fitting of the components to the self - calibrated visibility data was also performed in difmap . the sizes of the components were determined by fitting to the 1995 epoch ; for the rest of the analysis each component was allowed only to move and to vary its spectral density in order to fit the independently self - calibrated visibility data . each frequency band ( 6 , 8 . 4 and 15 . 4 ghz ) was modelfit independently in order to allow for differences in component sizes and frequencies . for our last three observations from 2003 to 2008 , all global 8 . 4 ghz observations , an additional set of components had to be fitted on each side of the spectrum ( epoch 4 . 1 ) . differences in the sizes and frequencies for components were derived from signal - to - noise ratios and component sizes ( fomalont 1999 ) . this implies that components are not static , which should be the case for the large , well - defined components that we observed in this epoch of 1946 + 708 . while theof the few objects to be confirmed as a bona - fide compact binary object , 1946 + 708 is in a few ways unusual for this type . the source is remarkably ` ` rotation ' ' symmetric ( see table 1 and 2 ) . narrow , well defined jets emerge from a large , flat spectrum core and move outward before terminating in well defined hot spots . faint ` ` lobes ' ' of plasma are seen at 90 angles to the jet . the jets of the jet are seen to extend out from the core to the hot spots on both the northern ( jet ) side and the southern ( non - jet ) side . our most uniform , consistent , and highest resolution set of images is that at 8 . 4 ghz . the 8 . 4 ghz images cover the period from march 1995 to march 2008 , and have noise levels ranging from 163 @ xmath5jy / beam , to 38 @ xmath5jy / beam ( table 3 ) . no magnetic field has been detected from 1946 + 708 at either 8 . 4 or 8 . 4 ghz in any epoch . typical 2 @ xmath6 based on the standard infrared images ##es ##1 @ xmath7100 @ xmath5jy @ 8 . 41 and @ xmath7170 @ xmath5jy at 15 . 4 mas . this process is quite important for the formation of strong and weak jet streams . in addition to the previously mentioned components n2 / s2 and n5 / s5 , we report here on the discovery of a new set of components which we name n6 / s6 ( no . 1 ) . like the previous sets , these new components appear to have been observed simultaneously as a pair , and appear to be moving away from the core in opposite directions . the angular separation of the two components ( n6 and s6 ) measured in our 2008 epoch is 1 . 288 mas . the total relative distance between n6 and s6 and the core is difficult to determine owing to the interactions of these components with the core , but the actual distance can be compared with the 2006 epoch in which it was 1 . 045 mas . the total apparent separation rate between the components over the past 100 years is thus 0 . 238 mas / year or 0 . 72 % . this is the ejection rate for the new pair at 1997 . 1 . further evidence of the new component formation can be found in the 2003 epoch , and to a lesser extent in 2001 . the sum ofthe core mass density and the mass density of the new components n6 and s6 during this period ( fig . 3 ) are increasing steadily , and this seems to be reversed later on , as the new components move further away from the core . in fig . 4 we see the positions of the four known jet components ( n2 , n5 , s5 and s2 ) , from modelfitting using gaussians to the observed data at 1 . 5 c . the long - distance jet components close to the core , n5 and s5 , appear to move out with the same apparent velocity ( figure 2 and fig . 5 ; and see also the moviegbtaylor / ] ) , with n5 being the fastest at an apparent velocity of 0 . 088 c , and s5 being about a third that in a nearly the opposite direction . note that these are apparent speeds measured in the plane of the sky , as opposed to real , two - dimensional data . the more distant pair of components ( n2 / s2 ) appears to be moving at roughly twice the apparent velocity of the inner ( n5 / s5 ) component . from this fact one might be able to conclude that the jet moves very fast and that##elerates with time . if this is the case , and the deceleration is uniform , then we would expect to see the n5 / s5 pair slowing down , but this is not possible . even with 12 years of monitoring and a distance estimate close to 10 % of the radius of the jet , there is no direct evidence for separation of any of the components . the @ xmath8 values are remarkably good approximation to a straight line for all components ( the @ xmath8 values may be much higher in declination than in right ascension owing to the north - south orientation of most of the components ) . if the velocities remain constant then the n5 / s5 pair will catch up with the n2 / s2 pair in @ xmath075 ##0 , corresponding to the time that they enter the hot spots . alternatively , it could be that there is a uniform deceleration of the jet , at a distance from the jet between 3 . 5 and 4 mas ( on the far side ) . this gap is defined by the minimum distance of 9 mas for n2 in 1995 and the maximum distance for n5 observed in 2008 . this is in the region where the jet bends the most ( @ xmath9 )towards the central hot spot , such a deceleration region should not be drawn out prematurely . considering the other pair of stars , n6 / s6 , their total angular momentum difference is 1 . 72c , more than that of the n2 / s2 pair ( 1 . 63 c ) , than the n5 / s5 pair ( 1 . 66 c ) . observations over the 10 @ xmath05 period should settle the question of whether they emerge with their own , repeating set of velocities , or if they emerge in a fixed pattern of rotation and deceleration . if there is a fixed , repeating pattern , then it may be possible to apply it to a galactic jet model . in a helical model , the rotational speed could be constant while the orientation changes in time to explain the observed variations in the observed radial velocities . such a model also explains the rotational period of 1946 + 708 and has been found to explain observations over 10 years of the galactic jet in ss433 ( roberts et al . 2008 , hjellming & johnston 1981 ) . the orbits of the inner jet components of 1946 + 708 ( n5 and s5 ) would be fairly close to within the galacticfrom the measurements . there is a suggestion of a bend in the trajectory of n5 after the 2006 epoch ( epoch 5 in fig . 4 ) , but this relies almost entirely on the position at the 2008 epoch . for the more distant northern component ( n2 ) there are changes in the core temperature near epochs 1994 , 2001 and 2006 ( epoch 2 , 7 and 9 in fig . 4 ) . there also appears to be an offset at the 15 ghz positions ( see fig . this suggests a weak component on the southern side of this offset . a similar effect is suggested by the multi - frequency phase plot of s2 based on the 10 and 15 ghz observations , but since the positions are different and the component is weak it is difficult to be sure if the spectral gradient is positive . another bend is found in the s2 after the 2003 epoch ( epoch 6 in fig . 4 ) . in well studied core - collapse models , such as 3c345 ( zensus et al . 1995 , unwin et al . 1997 ) , jet streams are found to move along curved paths and to change their speeds . this phenomenon has been used as justification for magnetically driven jets , as opposed to purely hydrodynamical structures ( vlak##his & konigl 2004 ) . by analogy with these core - jet sources , we draw a general conclusion that the cores of 1946 + 708 are likely to be magnetically stable . note , however , that intrinsic energies of jet components of core - jet agns are typically in the range @ xmath10 , much lower than we observed at the cso 1946 + 708 of 1 . 5 @ xmath11 ##1 . 5 ( see below ) . even before the core of 1946 + 708 was discovered based on 5 ghz observations , the first two epochs at 5 ghz determined its location by observing bi - directional motions away from the center of the source . given these motions and the symmetry of the source ( fig . 1 and 2 ) , it is reasonable to assert that n5 and s5 were discovered at the same time , and likewise n2 and s2 . indeed , we were fortunate enough to observe the fusion of n6 and s6 at @ xmath01997 as discussed above . further observations at 8 . 4 ghz ( see fig . 3 ) , show that there is continuous emission from the jet close to the hot core . the jet is probably not made up of tiny particlesthat can be best illustrated by the elliptical gaussian jet that we observe and modelfit . here the jet appears to be a continuous wave , with waves of enhanced emission ( shocks ? ) that slow down the jet . under the assumption that components are ejected in pairs , and that the effects are due to pressure boosting and light travel time difference , we can use the observed apparent motion rates and differences to solve for the intrinsic component velocity and distance . for simultaneously ejected components moving in opposite directions at an angle @ xmath12 to the line of sight with an equal velocity @ xmath13 , it follows that from the light travel time difference that the ratio of apparent component distances from the origin ( @ xmath14 for the approaching side , @ xmath15 for the receding side ) as well as the ratio of apparent distances ( approaching : @ xmath16 , outgoing : @ xmath17 ) are given at any point by ( taylor & vermeulen 1997 ) : @ xmath18 our only necessary constraint , the velocity that @ xmath13 and @ xmath12 can be calculated from the separation rate @ xmath19 , is not subject to the uncertainty of the fixed point. from geometry and the ratio of angular to linear velocity we get : @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 is the projected angular velocity , @ xmath22 is the angular velocity distance to the star , and @ xmath23 is the distance . note that fig . 2 has a distance bound , but fig . 3 does not , so we can solve the equations above for the distance and hence the hubble constant . for the n5 / s5 pair we have an angular velocity speed @ xmath24 of 3 . 50 @ xmath25 0 . 44 . this reduces to @ xmath26 = 3 . 50 @ xmath25 0 . 04 . at the same time , the apparent velocity speed of the n5 / s5 pair is 3 . 40 @ xmath25 0 . 01 c . the two equations above are shown graphically in fig . 6 ( bottom right ) . assuming the standard model and h @ xmath4 = 71 ##5 ##h @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 we have a simple solution for an apparent velocity of 0 . 88 @ xmath25 0 . 03 c , at an angle of h @ xmath255 . a further analysis for the n2 / s2 pair ( top right of fig . 4 ) , with an intrinsic velocity of 0 . 9 @ xmath25 0 . 11 c and with an inclination of 1 @ xmath25 c . the intrinsic velocity also changes from 0 . 9 c for n5 / s5 to 0 . 9 c for n2 / s2 ( a change of 0 . 9 @ xmath6 ) . there is no single intrinsic velocity that can match the values for both pairs , and cannot be used to directly measure the gravitational constant . we can , however , place a lower limit on the intrinsic velocity based on the assumption that the intrinsic velocity must be faster than the speed of light . we find that h @ xmath4 @ xmath2 28 km s @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 in order to achieve a valid solution for the n5 / s5 pair , and the weaker bound that h @ xmath4 @ xmath2 28 km s @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 in order to achieve a valid solution for the n2 / s2 pair . since the velocities of n2 / s2 andfrom those of n5 / s5 respectively , we see no reason why the origin should be particularly close to earth , so for the solution of this equation we adopt h @ xmath4 = 71 km s @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 . the solutions given above to equations 1 and 2 are based on assuming that the components in a pair , as observed , are oppositely directed and equally spaced . we derive angles near 45 ; the line of sight depth difference between the components in the pair would therefore be an exact fraction of their total distance from the horizon line to the core , and therefore equal to the distance projected onto the plane of the sky . we derive the angles that are an exact fraction of the speed of light . in particular , the depth and velocity ratios imply that the outgoing component , due to the significant light travel distance difference , should be observed at a rather younger age ( 70 % - 80 % ) than the incoming component , and at a correspondingly larger total distance from the core . however , the observed arm length ratios ( @ xmath27 ) are lower by a factor of about 10 compared to the apparent velocity ratios ( 2 . 75 vs . 2 . 76 for n2 / s##2 ; and 1 . 50 vs . 1 . 50 for n5 / s5 ) . this requires that currently the radial - velocity differences between the approaching and receding components are more significant with respect to the motion of the stars than our simple speed and distance solutions suggest . the arm length ratios depend on the time period of each of the components , and the greater degree of variation in arm lengths seems to imply that for a significant part of their lifetime the stars were stationary and / or moving more along the plane of the sky than they are now . a fully self - consistent solution then must incorporate a model for the galactic core , and for this change in velocity , since , inevitably , it implies that the approaching component is seen at a greater distance and therefore with a lower velocity than its neighbours . this leads to an extension of equations 1 and 2 , into a set where the arm length ratio is directly related ; the jet model may provide a basis for this extension . however , it is beyond the scope of this article . to properly verify such a model in the case of 1946 + 708 will require observations spanning several decades . nevertheless , we believe the velocities we have obtained , while not fully self - consistent , are indicative of the fact that the starsof this pair contain features that move with speeds that are an appreciable fraction of the speed of light , and are much greater than the advance velocity of the hot stars . furthermore , the differences in angle ( by at least 50 % ) as well as in speed ( by at least 50 % ) between the n2 / s2 and n5 / s5 components are good indications of the kinds of changes in angular velocity that are evidently occurring in and around the stars . both the observed pulse length ratios and the observed changes in projection of the overall flux on the plane of the sky provide interesting information . the time evolution of the flux ##es of the n2 / s2 and n5 / s5 pair is shown in detail . the n2 flux has shown a steady rise by @ xmath020 % over several years of monitoring at 8 . 5 mhz . during that same time s2 has only slightly declined . recently both n5 and s5 have been observed . that appears to have dropped significantly starting in 2006 . the rate of the decline is 70 % for n5 and 57 % for s5 . we are now in the unusual situation where s5 appears to be larger than n5 , which would at first not becontrary to the predictions from the data . however , we have to bear in mind that the light from s5 is delayed compared to the light that we see from n5 ( by several years for the 2008 epoch according to the geometry described above ) and that the history of variability must be taken into account when attempting to calculate flux density ratios between the pairs . a more detailed analysis of the flux density ratios , taking into account the time period , should eventually be possible . even then , it may not be possible to explain the very significant changes in flux density shown in fig . 4 . given the stability of the component pairs ( see fig . 5 ) . local variations ( e . g . , changes in magnetic field strength and particle velocity ) , and the interaction of the jet components with their surroundings , may affect the synchrotron emissivity of the jet components . the curvature in the core of 1946 + 708 ( fig . 7 ) could be explained by either ( 1 ) radial motion from the galactic nucleus ; or ( 2 ) circular motion of the core . in the first case we would expect components to travel in straight lines at high radial velocities . in the second case we would expect that components to travelalong helical jets have intrinsic velocities that vary in direction . although there is no direct evidence available for deviation from the intrinsic velocities , there do appear to be some changes or irregularities in the jets , and in particular if one considers also the earliest 1 ghz measurement ( c1 , fig . 2 ) , then there appears to have been a change in direction of several degrees . this supports the second model of a helically confined jet . likewise , the presence of continuous jets within the jet , seemingly confined , even if traveling at high intrinsic velocities ( n5 - n2 ) , supports the first model of an intrinsically confined jet . from the modelfit , it is difficult to measure the velocity of the source . certainly it is clear that the motion is much slower than the jet itself . but the northern hot spot is very faint and compact , and is correspondingly less amenable to modelfitting than the compact jet components . the southern hot spot does have a faint and compact feature , and one can measure with great accuracy its velocity relative to the source . the mean velocity is @ xmath70 . 01 mas / y , at the point that one has tois concerned about possible motions of the core component due to the rotation of the n6 / s6 region . since the modelfit results are referenced to the core component , any apparent apparent motion of the source translates into the loss of a systematic relative velocity to both components . an alternative approach is to compute a difference map between two components , well separated in time . apparent motions then show up as alternating positive and negative motions . 8 shows us an image constructed by differencing the images from the 1996 and 2008 epochs - both of which are of very high quality and low noise , and are aligned with the light - beam . lighter components in fig . 8 indicate where the source was brighter in 2008 . in fig . 8 one can see a very clear signature of light coming from the edge of the southern hot spot , which appears as a positive ( dark ) structure ( closer to the core ) and a negative ( whiter ) structure ( farther from the core ) in the 2008 image . the more slowly moving core components show lighter structures . from measuring the position of the edge of the southern hot spot we estimate this apparent motion to be 0 . 008 @ xmath25 ##0 . 002 mas / y . since the apparent motion here is relative tothe northern hot spot , this is the average apparent expansion rate of the star , and the apparent size of the southern hot spot would presumably be below this value , or 0 . 004 km / s , corresponding to a mean rotational velocity of 0 . 024 c ( 7000 km / s ) . based on the measurement of the apparent expansion rate , we can calculate a kinematic age for 1946 + 708 assuming a constant expansion rate . the age measurement given above gives a kinematic age of 4000 @ xmath25 ##0 years . this is at the long end of cso ages measured to date ( gugliucci et al . 2005 ) , which have been measured between 2000 and 3000 years , and the results are admittedly rather poor . however , there is a selection effect that the expansions take longer to complete . the ratio of 1 : 1 for the northern to southern hot spot mass densities ( derived from modelfitting ) , is difficult to explain in terms of doppler shift given the very high apparent velocities observed for the hot spots . a more likely explanation is that the interstellar medium may be cooler on the northern side , consistent with the presence of greater hi opacity to the south ( peck & taylor 2001) . the arm length ratio between northern and southern hot spots is close to parity , 0 . 94 : 1 , with the northern hot spot being a little closer to the core . in the case of density boosting we would expect the northern hot spot to be further away from the core , but we favor a cooler medium on the northern side to be responsible for the difference in gas densities and arm length ratios between the two hot spots . the low observed polarization ( less than 0 . 1 % for the core , less than @ xmath00 . 3 % for the jet region , and less than 0 . 1 % for the southern hot spot at 8 . 4 % in 1996 ) , can be explained by the effects due to the core and a magnetic field tangled on scales smaller than the angular resolution of the observations . this situation could naturally be due to magnetic fields and free electrons interacting with the outer disk . all of this has only been observed in a few csos to date ( gugliucci et al . those few instances of low brightness occur in the approaching regions of csos which are more dense and core - like than typical csos , probably indicating a smaller contribution to the core -of - sight , and therefore a very shallow faraday screen . after a detailed , multi - frequency , multi - phase study of the close binary star 1946 + 708 , we estimate the kinematic age of the extant jet system to be @ xmath04000 years . on timescales of @ xmath010 years , outbursts result from jet components that emerge from the star and travel at intrinsic speeds between 0 . 6 and 0 . 8 c towards the hot spots . most of the individual jet components were observed to travel along either bent , or kinked paths , but no components have yet been observed to change their direction . the jet components in general appear to be highly symmetric , and to lie within the ` ` ` s - symmetric ' ' region of the star . we find that the jets are helically confined , rather than linear in nature . the infrared emission from the jets or hot - spots was detected down to very low levels ( 0 . 1 to 0 . 4 % ) , consistent with observations of csos in 2006 . further observations in the next decade should allow for a detailed analysis of the newly ejected jet , n6 / s6 . consistent with continued observations of n2 / s2 and n5 / s5it should be possible to measure variations in the jet components , and to determine if each jet pair has an intrinsic component that is lost upon impact . a more detailed analysis , taking into account the flux ##es of the jet components , could give a more accurate measurement of the boosting in 1946 + 708 and help ascertain the extent to which interactions with the environment are important . we thank h . brown for help with the data reduction of the 1998 and 1999 epochs . he gratefully acknowledges the university of bordeaux for hosting the visit during which much of this work was undertaken . this work has benefited from additional funding from the astronomical ' s seventh framework programme under radionet r113ct 2003 5058187 . the national radio astronomy observatory is operated by radio astronomers , inc . , in cooperative agreement with the national science foundation . the european vlbi network is a joint project of european , american , south african and other radio astronomy researchers supported by their national science funding . gugliucci , n . e . , taylor , g . b . , taylor , j . b . , & giroletti , m . 2005 apj , 622 , 136 gugliucci , n . e . , taylor , g . b . ,peck , a . b . , & giroletti , m . 2007 apj , 661 , 000 hjellming , j . c . , & hansen , c . e . 1981 , , 246 , l141 fomalont , j . a . 1999 , radio waves , radio waves 2 , 2 , 301 owsianik , i . & conway , j . e . 1998 , a & a , 337 , 339 peck , a . b . , taylor , g . b . , fassnacht , j . . e . , readhead , a . c . s . , & vermeulen , r . c . 2000 , apj , 534 , 104 peck , a . b . , & taylor , g . b . 2001 , apjl , 554 , l147 pihlstrm , j . e . , conway , j . e . , & vermeulen , r . c . 2003 , a & a , 404 , 871 readhead , a . c . s . , taylor , g . b . , xu , y . , pearson , j . m . , smith , j . m . , & polatidis , g . s . 1996 , apj, 460 , 612 wilson , j . a . , wardle , j . a . m . , lipnick , j . a . , selesnick , j . a . , & slutsky , m . 2008 , , 676 , 584 schwab , j . a . , & wilson , j . a . 1983 , aj , 25 , 688 shepherd , m . c . , pearson , t . j . , & taylor , g . b . 1994 , aj , 95 , 987 shepherd , m . c . , pearson , t . j . , & taylor , g . b . 1995 , aj , 95 , 903 taylor , g . b . , vermeulen , r . c . , pearson , t . j . , readhead , a . c . s . , henstock , j . m . , wilson , j . a . m . , & smith , p . n . 1994 , apjs , 47 , 345 taylor , g . b . , readhead , a . c . s . , & pearson , t . j . 1996 , apj , 463 , 000 taylor , g . b . , & vermeulen , r . c . 1997 ,apjl , 485 , l9 smith , m . a . , marr , j . a . , readhead , m . j . a . , & pearson , j . a . 2000 , apj , 541 , 112 unwin , s . c . wehrle , j . a . , lobanov , v . p . , zensus , j . a . , madejski , j . a . , smith , m . a . , & aller , j . a . 1997 , apj , 480 , 596 vlahakis , a . & konigl , m . 2004 , apj , 605 , 656 zensus , j . a . , cohen , j . a . , & unwin , s . c . 1995 , apj , 443 , 11 -
