the construction of background field formalism for n = 2 super - yang - mills theory ( sym ) in projective hyperspace ( @ xmath0 ) @ xcite is an open problem . such a construction is desirable for any ( non - ) supersymmetric theory as it allows ( linear ) operations and other intermediate steps involving gauge connections . a major obstacle in solving this problem for the n = 2 case seems to be the lack of information relating the gauge connection to the projective hyperfield @ xmath1 , which is the sym multiplet for all practical purposes @ xcite . we note that the closely related @ xcite n = 2 projective superspace ( @ xmath2 ) @ xcite does not solve this issue . the hyperfield , @ xmath3 of the sym multiplet is itself a connection , @ xmath4 . in fact , background field formalism in projective superspace has quite a straightforward construction @ xcite . although the construction has some problems , it has been solved in a series of papers along with the results @ xcite . in this way , we solve the problem of constructing the background field theory in projective superspace without the need for describing the connections explicitly ininstead of @ xmath1 . this is done by allowing the background fields to be in a ` real ' representation ( @ xmath5 ) and the background fields to be in the ` analytic ' representation ( @ xmath6 ) . this is reminiscent of the non - chiral , non - real representation used in n = 1 superspace @ xcite . what this does is make the effective representation independent of @ xmath7 and dependent on background fields ( like @ xmath8 ) with ` dimension ' greater than @ xmath9 ( since the lowest dimension is a spinor ) . non - existence of @ xmath9 - invariant background fields ( like @ xmath7 ) is a crucial condition for the non - renormalization theorem to hold as stated in @ xcite . this also leads to a proof of finiteness at 1 - loop . ( a similar method for proof of finiteness has been used in @ xcite . ) the reduction of quantum fields to background fields is by the ' s projective constraint alone , which simplifies the vertex structure to bit . the problems are further simplified at 1 - loop as most @ xmath10 - loops turn out to be trivial since the background fieldshave an @ xmath10 - integration . this means that the @ xmath10 - integration effectively vanishes from the effective theory and as expected from the supergraph theory , only one @ xmath11 - integration survives at the end of the calculations . we will work in fermi - ##onic gauge so there are no more problems to worry about when evaluating the super - feynman theory . another important problem is the ghost nature of the fields in this new theory . apart from the usual faddeev - popov ( fermionic @ xmath12 ) and cohen - kallosh ( bosonic @ xmath13 ) ghosts , we require two additional extra ghosts , namely real bosonic @ xmath14 and real fermionic @ xmath15 . this is in contrast to n = 1 sym which is equivalent to the taylor expansion of n = 2 theory . heuristically , we can easily see that such extra field contributions would yield a unique @ xmath16 - function for n = 2 . however , we can see that the combined contributions of @ xmath1 and extra ghosts have spurious properties arising due to the @ xmath17 decay . these are very similarto the ` coinciding ghosts ' effects in the @ xmath2 case , which manifest themselves at closed - loop points via the assumption regarding existence of similar field determinants . however , the @ xmath0 case , we do not find any striking effects . only the effects turn out to be similar , leading to a difference between the basic hyperfield theory results and that of the extra ghosts . the vector fields in the effective case are generated by these extra ghosts only . this construction is not built on the usual projective superspace construction of sym as in @ xcite . we review it further , for the sake of continuity . we can use the 6d notation to simplify some algebraic formulas for ordinary differential operators and indeed , the results carry over to n = 2 6d sym in a trivial manner with this notation . the projective hyperspace comprises of two spacetime coordinates ( @ xmath18 ) , four fermionic coordinates ( @ xmath11 ) and a complex representation on cp @ xmath19 ( @ xmath10 ) . the full n = 2 superspace requires two additional fermionic coordinates ( @ xmath20 ) in addition to these projective coordinates . thenon - real derivatives corresponding to these different @ xmath20 s form a projective hyperfield ( @ xmath21 ) via the constraint @ xmath22 . the definition of the covariant derivatives can be found below . we see here that in the ` real ' representation ( the ` real ' representation @ xcite and the one we use here in this paper ) the @ xmath23 functions are @ xmath10 - dependent . their anti - linear relation over the @ xmath10 s is all that we need for : @ xmath24 the vector hypermultiplet is described by an ` ideal ' hyperfield ( @ xmath25 ) that contains all non - zero powers of @ xmath10 and the vector hypermultiplet by a ` field ' @ xmath1 , which contains all powers of @ xmath10 . to define the relevant measure , the integral over this vector space is assumed to be the usual elliptic integral , with the contour being a circle around the origin ( for our purposes see this paper ) . so , the projective measure simply becomes : @ xmath26 ( with the usual factor of @ xmath27theorem ( ) . now , we are going to look into the structure of the gauge theory here . the two gauge fields , @ xmath28 , with n = 2 sym satisfy the following ( non - ) gauge relations ( written in 6d notation ) : @ xmath29 = - _ { } w _ a ^ { } \ , , \ \ \ { _ { } } , w _ b ^ { } \ } = { { \ cal ##c } } _ { { } _ { } ^ { } - \ tfrac { { \ pi { \ lambda } } } { } } - _ { { } , _ { } ^ { } \ , , \ \ [ _ { } , ^ { } ] = - _ ^ { [ } _ ^ { ] } \ , , \ \ [ _ { } , _ x ] = _ { } \ , , \ \ [ _ { } , _ x ] = [ \ , , \ _ { dyd } \ _ { y } \ ] ] where the su ( 2 ) fields @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 are the gauge fields , and @ xmath33consider the case of quantum fields . the 4d - chiral field strength , @ xmath34 is related to the spinor field strength via the spinor operators . we obtain the above expression for @ xmath35 by setting @ xmath36 , where @ xmath37 is an arbitrary complex hyperfield . we can choose a background derivative of @ xmath37 ( corresponding to n = 2 superspace ) such that @ xmath38 with @ xmath39 is the quantum field derivative . we can now choose ` real ' representations for the background derivative , such that @ xmath40 . this simplifies the @ xmath10 - integral of the connection : @ xmath41 since these derivatives have an @ xmath10 - dependence , the @ xmath10 - integral in the classical action can be easily computed . however , the quantum derivatives of the effective covariant action , can be taken to be the ` real ' representations , @ xmath42 , @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 . the projective ( projective ) constraint on hyperfields ` belongs ' to @ xmath45 . we cannow define a background projective hyperfield @ xmath46 and @ xmath47 such that @ xmath48 . then , the vector hypermultiplet ##ic action is : @ xmath49 the vector hyperfield @ xmath1 s action is the same as in the above case ; the difference is that the @ xmath1 action below is only the center action and is not projective : @ xmath50 we know from @ xcite that this expression should give the expression for @ xmath7 and hence the ` s ' action for vector hyperfields is a projective representation . the coordinate dependence of @ xmath1 is through the projective derivative and the projective covariant derivative of . the following results will be useful for proving that and the other results in the following section : @ xmath51 _ ^ 2 \ , , \ \ _ { 2 } ^ 4 _ { 2 } ^ 2 = \ left [ y _ { 12 } { { \ cal ##c } } _ { } + \ tfrac { 1 } { 1 } y _ { 12 } ^ 2 { \ cal { } } + \ tfrac { 2 } { 2 } y _ { 12 } ^ 2{ \ , ( } _ { , } ^ { } _ { , } + w _ { } ^ _ { , } + 2 { { \ cal ##c } } _ { } { \ , ) } + w _ { , } ^ { _ { 2 } ^ 4 \ , ] _ { 2 } ^ { \ , , \ , { 2 } \ ] ] where @ xmath52 is the non - trivial dalembertian and @ xmath53 . as the above terms do not appear explicitly in the theory , we must avoid the usage of special fonts to represent the gauge fields ( as has been done before ) and also the notation ` @ xmath54 ' on @ xmath55 from now on . the action process of the quantum gauge proceeds similarly to the ordinary gauge . the second terms are the background - invariant , and @ xmath56 is replaced by @ xmath57 ( or @ xmath58 ) . . moreover , we need no ghosts for the theory to be consistent in this case . we go further in the following subsections . the quantum hypermultiplet is still projective but the structure of the action is not the sameas in the ordinary case . that means the kinetic operator defined in the equations of motion in @ xmath59 , @ xmath42 , @ xmath60 still holds . so the definition of the kinetic operator in @ xcite ##s is by employing these equations : @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 : @ xmath63 the point - vector for the first hypermultiplet due to faddeev - popov ( fp ) , is not applicable to the ordinary case and we can write the equation with some modifications : @ xmath64v _ 1 \ , ; \ label { sgfinv } \ \ { { \ cal ##c } } _ { fp } & = - { \ bar { tr } } \ int dx \ , x ^ { \ bar \ , c \ , \ left [ \ bar { c } \ , x + \ bar { c } \ , y + ( y \ , x + \ bar { c } ) \ frac { v } { 2 } \ , ( v + \ frac { \ bar { c } } { 2 } \ , ) + . . . \ , ] . \ label { fpac##tion } \ , { \ } \ ] ] the equations for the fp ##v are related to the corresponding hypermultiplet and will be written out here . we can also work with pseudo - feynman gauge ( @ xmath65 ) . let us replace the propagator for @ xmath1 with the @ xmath66 . this equation will be useful later . we can remove the terms appearing in @ xmath1 from the above equation and the corresponding hypermultiplet , to get @ xmath67 _ { 12 } ^ 2 x _ 1 \ nonumber \ \ = & - \ frac { { \ text { tr } } } { 2g ^ 2 } \ int dx \ , d ^ 1 \ , d _ 1 \ , d _ 2 \ , v _ 2 \ frac { 1 } { y _ { 12 } ^ 2 } \ left [ 1 + \ frac { 1 } { } { \ left ( } - 1 + \ frac { y _ 1 + y _ 2 } { 1 } ( y _ { 12 } ) { \ right ) } \ right ] y _ { 12 } ^ 2 \ left (\ frac { 1 } { 2 } { \ text { } } + \ cdots \ right ) v _ 2 \ nonumber \ \ = & -

dx \ , y ^ 2 \ , y _ 2 \ , { { \ cal j } } _ 2v _ 2 \ , \ } . \ end { svj } \ , { 2 } \ ] ] thus , @ xmath70 is also known to be ( non ) projective . thus , equation of state for @ xmath1 : @ xmath71 \ frac { _ { 2 } ^ 4 } { y _ { 2 } ^ 4 } = { { \ cal j } } _ 2 \ , , \ end { eomf } \ ] ] which we can use to solve @ xmath1 in terms of @ xmath70 . this leads to solving the same equation for @ xmath1 which we can write . using the same ansatz for @ xmath1 : @ xmath72 and leads us to( [ eomf ] ) , we are going to @ xmath73 because @ xmath74 \ , [ 1 + \ frac { - 1 + y _ { ( y _ { 02 } ) } { } \ , ] = ( y _ { 02 } ) \ , . \ ] ] with ( [ eomf ] ) and ( [ fjk ] ) in the form ( [ svj ] ) , we get @ xmath75 which leads to the following expression , which derived ( for the general case ) : @ xcite @ xmath76 this expression gives @ xcite for @ xmath65 to @ xmath77 ##8 for the general form of the effective action @ xmath78 in background field theory , the inverse wave equation leads to many calculations apart from the fp ##n , which leads to the 1 - d formulation . to see that , consider the effective action @ xmath79 given by the following expression : @ xmath80 where @ xmath81 is given by the boundary of @ xmath82 . this gives @ xmath83 so ( [ expg ] ) simpl##ifies to @ xmath84 we can write the last term as @ xmath85 where @ xmath86 are real hyperfields . # as to the taylor expansion @ xcite , we take @ xmath87 and introduce nielsen - kallosh ( nk ) ghost @ xmath13 to account for the resulting jacobian . this means the n - th term for n = 2 sym coupled to matter simplifies to : @ xmath88 for n = 4 , the scalar hypermultiplet is in adjoint representation and this term will be the combined fp and nk ##s contributions . the other two terms are spurious divergences due to the @ xmath17 s but their joint effect appears to be zero , which will turn out to be the case if we investigate this problem further . to introduce the effect of @ xmath86 ##s alone into the path integral , we choose to introduce a complex particle @ xmath14 and a complex fermion @ xmath15 as follows : @ xmath89 where @ xmath90 means the electromagnetic field requires two fermionic particles @ xmath91 and abosonic action @ xmath92 and the corresponding quantum action for n = 2 sym relative to matter are : @ xmath93 + s _ { fp } ( v , r , e ) + s _ { nk } ( b , e ) + s _ { xr } ( v , e , r ) + s _ { } ( r , ) . \ ] ] the fp and nk ghosts are background projective hyperfields . the actions for these ghosts are the same as those in the case of non - background fields . the action for fp ghost is given in brackets ( [ fpaction ] ) and that for nk ghost is similar to the vector hypermultiplet ghost action . that and their actions are the generalizations and read @ xmath94 here , we focus on the new ingredient of the background field action : the vector ghosts . in the same way as the vector hypermultiplet , we can continue the analysis of these ghosts . let us now focus on the scalar ghost action . the fermionic ghost can be written as : @ xmath95x _ n \ \ = & \ , - \ frac { { \ begin { tr} } } { 4 } dx d ^ 4dy _ { 1 , 2 } \ , x _ 1 \ , [ { \ left ( } \ frac { x _ 1 } { y _ { 12 } } + \ frac { y _ 1 } { y _ { 12 } } { \ right ) } \ frac { 2 } { y _ { 12 } ^ 2 } { \ widehat { } } \ right ] x _ 1 \ \ = & \ , -

factor component of @ xmath56 ) , which will connect the loop with the vector connection and background fields . for the extra ghosts , we can also simplify the nave equation by noticing that the vertices of @ xmath104 - factor and the propagator will generate such a term as the numeratordue to the failure of @ xmath105 . 0 , we can remove them from the very beginning and work with the associated vector and vertex for the purpose of calculating them . let us now consider all the relevant feynman rules below . @ xmath106 { \ left ( } { \ widehat { } } -

divergent action too ) is not available via the methods described above . we note that such an action occurs in the n = 1 background , especially when the vector multiplets in the space are connected . the calculations can not be done covariantly and the gauge fields appear in addition to the vectors . [ [ vector ] ] vector + + + + + + the contribution to one - loop one - loop action from vector hypermultiplet running through the loop would be given by the following: @ xmath107 where the internal dependence of @ xmath108 equals the internal external dependence . as such , to complete the entire @ xmath109 - cycle , at least one @ xmath110 should be removed from the diagram and replaced @ xmath111 . the other non - trivial contribution is from the 4 - point diagram : @ xmath112 . the @ xmath17 effects lead to an @ xmath113 effect , leading to ` quantum harmonic ' effects on @ xmath2 . these effects disappear when we take into account the @ xmath114 effect .

( [ 4pfinite ] ) is the complete four - dimensional effective theory . assuming them to be time independent , we can now write this expression in terms of the u ( 2 ) field theory and take the integral of space - time to get @ xmath120 where we used the reduction to 4d for @ xmath121 . using this and the fact that @ xmath122 is equivalent to @ xmath123 , we get the first non - holomorphic4 - point approximation ( with the full superspace of @ xmath124 ) to a = 4 sym action , directly when compared to the calculation done in @ xcite ( for similar reasons in @ xmath2 and , for example , @ xcite ) . [ [ loops ] ] 2 - loops + + + + + + + we can now see that there are no net loops at 2 - loops . the proof is similar to that given in the previous case , _ i . e . _ , absence of sufficient @ xmath125 s . the loop diagrams shown in fig . [ v2hbg ] are supposed to exist at 2 - loops . all of them will be according to the @ xmath126 - algebra unless we get at least 4 @ xmath110 s from the background of the diagram . this , as we have seen above , results in 4 additional @ xmath56 s making these 2 - loop diagrams equivalent . furthermore , we see that the results of @ xcite apply in our case since there is no basis for @ xmath7 , there can not be any loops at 4 or any loops from the previous series . this situation is differentthan @ xmath2 where such ` 0 - 1 ' objects are present and are similar to the example given above involving pairs of @ xmath35 operators have to be used and at the loops they can be quite useful @ xcite . we have formulated the quantum field theory for n = 2 , 4d projective superspace . the crucial step was to recognize that different representations for classical and quantum pieces of the hypermultiplets are required . the real representation for the background field allows non - renormalization results to be proved , as the higher - dimensional fields involved are spinors . the correct choice of real representation for the background fields allows us to make a simple application of the existing ` classical ' hilbert - feynman rules to the background quantum field . however , there are extra ghosts required ( apart from fp and nk tensor ) to generate the full sym effective theory . these extra ghosts also exist in the harmonic case . in projective dimensions , they replace the extra ` harmonic ' parts coming from the hypermultiplet in a straightforward manner and the extra finite parts are only necessary for n = 2 . the extra harmonic parts come only from the two ( fp and nk ) tensor and thehypermultiplet . however , their contribution could not be directly calculated in the formalism developed earlier for matter described in paper [ 2 ] . we also have a similar 2 - loop argument for finiteness of n = 2 sym coupled with matter . this is easily illustrated by the power of argument of @ xcite in general , which then leads to the argument for finiteness of 1 - loop . for n = 2 background matter , there exist improved techniques as showcased in @ xcite and our hope is that such techniques could be applied to what we have described in this paper . that would lead to a further extension of the 2 - loop argument , also allowing the calculation of the extended hypermultiplet and 1 - loop contribution . this research project was supported in part by research grant no . phy - 0969739 .
