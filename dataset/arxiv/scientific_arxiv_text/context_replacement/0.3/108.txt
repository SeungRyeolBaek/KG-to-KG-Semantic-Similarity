laser - cooling @ xcite aims to cool ions and molecules to very low temperatures . for this purpose , the correct understanding of the effects of the various atomic parameters determining the cooling process is very important . among the various approaches , raman sideband cooling has been demonstrated to be a very successful method for cooling atoms to the ground state of a harmonic laser @ xcite . this cooling process involves two stable and unstable atomic ground states , which we call @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 , connected by electronic transitions to a stable ground state @ xmath2 . the transitions are usually driven by alternating current . a typical sequence is a coherent pulse , in which the atom is initially scattered from @ xmath0 to @ xmath1 via a computer controlled raman laser , with a laser - pumping pulse , in which the atom is incoherently re - scattered to @ xmath0 by means of a laser resonant with @ xmath3 . the change of the motional frequency during the repumping is a process of first order . the transitions @ xmath4 of the trap frequency @ xmath5 and the trap frequency @ xmath6 , with @ xmath7being the energy of the atom and @ xmath8 the wave vector of the one - electron laser . in the brown - dicke scheme , where @ xmath9 , the probability for a change of the excited state is , and therefore , on the average , the atom is cooled at a rate of one phonon of energy @ xmath10 per cooling cycle . since there is a finite probability for the atom to be returned to the state @ xmath1 instead of being repumped , a series of incoherent pumping pulses will be required before the atom is finally converted into @ xmath0 , which significantly increases the laser energy at the end of the pulse cycle , reducing the cooling efficiency . however , since two and three electron schemes are used for zeeman or other substates , decays from @ xmath2 into other electronic substates may occur , leading to further problems . + in this work we quantify the effect of a high branching frequency in the raman sideband ##s by calculating the average shift and diffusion of the laser energy level at the end of each incoherent pumping pulse . it should be pointed out that recent work on self - cooling for multilev##el ##ls exist , which systematically use the branching ratio in their description @ xcite . those authors have focused on the lamb - dicke regime and on certain cooling schemes . first , we find out the effect of the branching ratio on cooling for an arbitrary ratio @ xmath4 by some selection rules . next , we infer the cooling coefficients in the lamb - dicke regime and we discuss the results outside the lamb - dicke regime in connection with the proposal in @ xcite . in addition , we show that at certain temperature , the cooling effect of the single photon scattering can be compared with the effective wave function @ xmath11 for the ` ` effective ' ' two - level transition @ xmath12 @ xcite . + this section is organized as follows . in section 2 we consider the model for the diffusion of a single ion during the repumping pulse of the raman laser , and we consider the phase shift and decay of the ion energy at the end of the pulse . in section 3 we extend our analysis to cases where the channels of diffusion are different . in section 4 we reach some conclusions , and in the appendix we present the details of our calculations . we assume a two level transition . in fig . [ fig : scheme0 ], whose energy levels are the ground state @ xmath13 , excited and ground state @ xmath14 and excited state @ xmath15 of radiative energy @ xmath16 ; @ xmath17 , @ xmath18 are dipole moments , with equal rates of decay @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 , where @ xmath21 . a resonance resonantly follows the transition @ xmath18 with rabi energy @ xmath22 . in the limit we consider the wave function for these transitions to be equal to @ xmath8 , which is a good approximation if , e . g . , @ xmath14 and @ xmath13 are linear transformations of the ground state . we consider the ion ##ization in one - dimensional . + the master equation for the electron density of @ xmath23 is written as ( @ xmath24 ) : @ xmath25 + [ \ { _ { , \ { { master0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath26 has the form : @ xmath27 = , @ xmath28 is the detuning of the electron and the @ xmath290 , which we take to be zero , and @ xmath6 is the frequency of the harmonic expansion which traps the ion along the @ xmath30 - axis , with @ xmath31 annihilation and creation operator , respectively . the interaction of the ion with the laser light is described in the second part of the equation @ xmath32 : @ xmath33 with @ xmath34 ( with @ xmath35 ) the moment operator , @ xmath36 the adjoint , and @ xmath30 the inverse of the ion . by writing ( [ coherent1 ] ) , ( [ master0 ] ) we have applied the classical wave equation and we have referred to the reference state , not the laser light . thus , the quantum spin operator has the form @ xmath37 where @ xmath38 is the wave pattern of the electron emission , which we call @ xmath39 . + in the form @ xmath40 we can model the ground state @ xmath2 using second order quantum theory @ xcite , and reduce the two - level scheme to a single level scheme , with ground state @ xmath14 and line##width @ xmath41 @ xcite . in the limit @ xmath42 the differential equation for the solutions of @ xmath43 , and of @ xmath23 in the limit @ xmath44 , can be written as @ xcite : @ xmath45 + \ sum _ { \ left [ j _ f \ right + j _ g \ left \ right ] , \ left { master1 } \ ] ] with @ xmath46 the hamiltonian @ xmath47 , @ xmath48 are obtained , given by : where @ xmath50 and where @ xmath51 the value of q . ( [ master1 ] ) can be written as follows @ xcite : @ xmath52 with @ xmath53 , and @ xmath54 with the equation for the effective hamiltonian : @ xmath55 with q . ( [ master ] ) the following solutions to the multiple scattering event are singled out : the first term on the right corresponds to the case in which at time @ xmath56 a spontaneous emission has occurred . the second term describes the single scattering event , and the @ xmath57 -the term @ xmath58 scattering event . the value of each term corresponds to the path associated with each event , and we can then calculate q . ( [ sol ] ) as the sum of all the possible paths of the scattering event multiplied by their respective values . for @ xmath59 , @ xmath60 , the atom is in @ xmath0 and @ xmath61 . for a pulse of length @ xmath62 we can replace @ xmath56 by @ xmath63 in the integral of q . ( [ sol ] ) and assume that the atom has been scattered into @ xmath0 at the end of the pulse . thus , each term in the integral of q . ( [ sol ] ) corresponds to the path associated with a given number of scattering events into @ xmath1 . the atom is finally scattered into @ xmath0 . from ( [ sol ] ) we can evaluate the shift and the difference of the energy levels at the end of the repumping pulse , which is defined as : @ xmath64 where @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 is the total kinetic energy of the atom . forin the form of the equation presented below , we define the basis @ xmath67 as follows : @ xmath68 where @ xmath69 , @ xmath70 are defined as : @ xmath71 | , \ rangle \ langle \ | , & \ \ & \ { { \ } \ } = \ sum _ 1 \ to _ { l _ 1 , l _ 1 \ neq \ } and where @ xmath72 is the basis of eigenstates of the harmonic operator . for @ xmath73 , with @ xmath74 initial distribution over the stationary states , and according to definition . ( [ sol ] ) the steady state term has the form : @ xmath75 where @ xmath76 is the initial distribution over the stationary states . the second term has the form of ( [ sol1 ] ) is the sum of the paths from @ xmath1 into @ xmath0 , where for each jump the second operator is included in the basis @ xmath72 , whereas the first term contains all the others . these two terms can be neglected @ xcite, and for @ xmath77 the following relation holds : @ xmath78 | [ \ rangle = p _ n ( s ) . \ end { distri } \ ] ] here , @ xmath79 is the expression for the signal to be received in the system @ xmath80 at @ xmath59 , and the ground state @ xmath81 at @ xmath82 . using the closed form ( [ shift ] ) of @ xmath69 and ( [ distri ] ) , @ xmath79 has the form : @ xmath83 where we have derived the expression @ xmath84 , with @ xmath85 being of the ground state of the harmonic system . translating ( [ shift ] ) into a . ( [ shift0 ] ) , ( [ diff0 ] ) , and using the above relations of @ xmath31 [ see the figure ] , we obtain : @ xmath86 , \ end { width1 } \ end { height } \ ] ] where @ xmath87 is the maxwell - dicke constant . for ( [ center1] ) is the phase corresponding to the vibrational state at the end of the repumping pulse . for @ xmath88 this corresponds to the average kinetic energy @ xmath89 associated with the incoherent raman branching into @ xmath0 . in this case , the second term in the equation of eq . ( [ width1 ] ) , , and eqs . ( [ center1 ] ) , ( [ width1 ] ) describe the effect of a photon of wave vector @ xmath90 on the initial two - level transition @ xmath91 . , for @ xmath92 an average wave vector @ xmath11 can be defined for the single scattering on the two - level transition @ xmath91 , which takes the form @ xmath93 . , @ xmath94 describes the quantum mechanical effect on the # ##ization from the single scattering of light during the repumping pulse of a raman transition with branching into @ xmath95 : this expression is valid in the case in which we can find the second term in the equation of ( [ width1 ] ) , _ i . e . _for @ xmath20 and / or @ xmath96 is known . in fig . 2 the new value of as of eq . ( [ width1 ] ) is compared with the previous value for @ xmath97 , for different values of the lamb - dicke parameter and as the value of @ xmath20 . here , we see that @ xmath11 characterizes the scattering rate for almost any branching ratio in the lamb - dicke regime , whereas for @ xmath98 an abrupt difference is not present in @ xmath99 . + from ( [ width _ eff ] ) we can find the new lamb - dicke parameter @ xmath100 for an incoherent scattering into the state @ xmath0 . this parameter gives an immediate indication of the effect of the branching ratio on scattering . for @ xmath101 , if @ xmath102 the state is still in the lamb - dicke regime , it has been completely transformed into @ xmath0 . thus , the coarse - grained state of the system can be described by a rate equation for the motional state @ xmath103 projected onto @ xmat##h0 , where the rate of cooling ( h ) is the real part of the sum of two terms : one corresponding to the component of the fluctuation spectrum of the nuclear energy at time @ xmath6 ( @ xmath104 ) , the other to the diffusion coefficient corresponding to spontaneous emission from the excited state @ xcite . this latter term is proportional to the corresponding lamb - dicke coefficient for the electron scattering , and thus limits our result to @ xmath105 . from the well - known form of the rate of @ xcite , the latter term gives the ground state average vibrational number @ xmath106 , which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient . + in the lamb - dicke regime , when @ xmath107 is equal to , or larger than , @ xmath6 , there are no estabilished steady - state laser - cooling techniques for trapped atoms . therefore , we discuss our result in relation to the results in @ xcite . recently , a cooling technique similar to raman sideband cooling has been presented , where pulses which cool the atoms to the excited state alternate with pulses cooling the atoms to a narrow range of low energies . these cooling techniquesfor two - photon detuning @ xmath108 to the red of the two - photon beam , , where @ xmath109 . then , the lack of a branching ratio can be taken into account by using @ xmath110 . in this case , beams which can withstand the initial kick @ xmath111 can be used , provided that the following condition is fulfilled : @ xmath112 where @ xmath113 is the dependence on @ xmath30 of the two - photon wave function of the starting beam . for the counterpropagating beams parallel to @ xmath30 , @ xmath114 and ( [ valid ] ) is valid for @ xmath115 , i . e . due to branching at @ xmath116 . finally , outside the maxwell - dicke regime the first term in the rhs of is . ( [ width1 ] ) can also be neglected . thus , the diffusion is reduced , and the efficiency of branching will decrease , as @ xmath20 ##6 . in the following , we show that the effective branching ratio with the repumping pulse in multilevel - mode can be described in the same way as discussedsee the previous sections . + let us consider the level - 2 of fig . 3 ( a ) , where we have applied to the solution of fig . 3 a new channel of energy from @ xmath2 into the stable and metastable state @ xmath117 , with probability of decay @ xmath118 so that @ xmath119 , where @ xmath120 , @ xmath121 are the probability of decay onto @ xmath122 , respectively . this solution resonantly makes the state @ xmath123 with rabi and @ xmath124 . for @ xmath125 the state @ xmath2 can be adiabatically derived from the equation of state . in this case the above equation aquires the state @ xmath126 \ \ & & + p _ g ' \ gamma ^ { \ prime } p _ g \ & + p _ g \ gamma ^ { \ prime } p _ 1 \ & + p _ g ' \ gamma ^ { \ prime } p _ g \ { , \ nonumber \ { { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath127 , with @ xmath##128 . the corresponding hamiltonian is now : @ xmath129 with @ xmath130 . the dynamics of @ xmath59 can be written as : @ xmath131 hence , the mean and variance take the form evaluated at vs . ( [ center1 ] ) , ( [ width1 ] ) where now the transitions @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 are written as @ xmath132 , @ xmath133 ( @ xmath21 ) . in a similar way we have calculated these dynamics for schemes like the one shown in fig . 3 ( b ) , where the first excited state @ xmath134 is coupled to @ xmath1 via the energy transfer mechanism acting on the transition @ xmath135 . for all the treatment , we assume that the fourth state resonantly follows the transition @ xmath136 with rabi frequency @ xmath137 ( see also , fig . 3 ( b ) ) . similarly , for the saturation vs . ( [ mastermany ] ) , the dynamics , where : @ xmath138 ( @ xmath139 ) , with @ xmat##h140 being the rate of decay of the excited state @ xmath141 ( @ xmath142 ) . assuming that @ xmath137 , and that @ xmath143 , the expression in eqs . ( [ center1 ] ) , ( [ width1 ] ) reduces to this case : , where : @ xmath20 is defined as : @ xmath144 and the probability @ xmath19 of decaying into @ xmath0 is @ xmath145 . + the result ( [ x _ prob ] ) shows that the laser intensity is minimum for @ xmath146 , which can be determined by choosing either the maximum intensity of the repumping lasers , or simply by detecting degeneracies in the excited multiplet , for example with the application of a magnetic field . we have shown the motional instability associated with a large branching ratio and in the shape of the decay and emission channels at the end of the repumping pulse in raman sideband ##s . the first and second moments of the laser energy levels have been determined analytically , and the integral of the branching ratio has been worked out . we have shown that for thein range of temperatures the system can be modeled with an exponential wave function @ xmath11 , corresponding to an effective - dicke parameter @ xmath147 for the thermal diffusion in the two - level transition @ xmath12 . finally , on the basis of this model we have discussed the possibility of raman sideband cooling and of a new type of ground - state cooling in the lamb - dicke model @ xcite . + the same theory and techniques can be applied to raman cooling for free atoms @ xcite . in that case the calculations are much simpler , since the angular momentum of radiation and absorption is a conserved quantity after the same event . + in general , these results can be applied to cooling schemes in free atoms . the authors have many stimulating discussions with a . khler and v . ludsteck . j . m . thanks j . i . cirac , a . eschner and a . lambropoulos for many stimulating discussions . this work is supported in parts by the european network of the tmr - networks erb - fmrx - ct96 - 0087 and erb - fmrx - ct96 - 0077 . using ( [ distri] ) , we write ( [ shift0 ] ) and ( [ diff0 ] ) as : the operator ##mation @ xmath151 can be represented by such that @ xmath152 . similarly , using the spectral sequence of the bosonic operator @ xmath153 and the following formula for the eigenstates of the contraction operator , and .
