active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are the most abundant , steady sources of luminosity in the universe . it is believed that the center regions of agn consist of a massive black hole ( smbh ) surrounded by an expanding disk . in some cases powerful stellar jets are found in agn , perpendicular to the plane of the disk . the origin of jets is still unknown . agns whose jets are located at a small angle to its axis are called blazars . the radio ( radio to @ xmath4 - ray ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars shows two broad non - thermal # ##s . the low - energy peak is thought to result from electron synchrotron emission . the leptonic model suggests that the second peak forms due to the compton emission . this may be due to upscattering , or the large non - thermal population of stars responsible for the background radiation , and stimulated emission ( post - compton : ssc ) @ xcite . blazars often show strong flux variability , that may or may not appear correlated in the different spectral bands . simultaneous observation are then crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying them . in thishere we discuss the code that we have used to obtain an estimation of the characteristic parameters of the ssc model . the ssc model has a formula for the total electron density @ xmath5 , which is a simple power law with exponents @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 . the minimum , maximum and minimum correction factors for the parameters are therefore called @ xmath8 , @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 respectively . the transition region is assumed to be a blob of radius @ xmath11 moving with a velocity @ xmath3 with respect to the surface in a magnetic field of intensity @ xmath1 . the model is thus characterized by two characteristic parameters . ' ' ' ' ' @ xmath12 ' ' ' ' ' in the previous section we have a @ xmath8 constant and equal to zero , which is a satisfactory approximation when used in the model . the estimation of the two characteristic parameters has been done by finding their best values and derived from a @ xmath13 , in which multi - dimensional experimental data have been applied to the ssc model known as a @ xcite . this has been confirmed by thelevenberg - marquardt algorithm @ xcite , which is an efficient algorithm for non - linear least - squares minimization that simultaneously interpolates between two different numerical approaches , namely the inverse hessian method and the gradient descent method . for completeness , we will present the pseudo - code for the algorithm in table i . the crucial point in our analysis is that from @ xcite we can easily obtain a good approximation to the ssc spectrum , in the form of a sampled sed . on the other hand , from table i , we see that at each step the calculation of the @ xmath14 requires the calculation of the sed for all the observed frequencies . although an observed frequency will likely not be one of the sampled points obtained from @ xcite , it will be between the sampled points , so that interpolation can be used to approximate the value of the sed . at the same time , the levenberg - marquardt method requires the calculation of the time derivatives of @ xmath14 with respect to the ssc spectrum . these derivatives have already been calculated numerically by evaluating the likelihood function of the @ xmath14 with respect to a sufficiently large , and adjusted .of each parameter . this method could have introduced a potential inefficiency in the algorithm , due to the constant need to compute the sed at many , many different points of parameter ##ization , this being the most demanding operation in terms of computation time . for this reason we speed up the algorithm to minimize the number of calls to @ xcite across the time . the @ xmath0 fit during the iterations are shown in fig . 1 . . data sets used in this study . the observation period of each parameter can be shown in fig . 2 . [ cols = " < , ^ , ^ , ^ " , id = " 0 " , ] [ l2ea4 - t1 ] in order to compare the behavior of systems with different activity , we use mrk421 ( table 1 ) , given the larger size of mwl data sets and the lower cost , and less time for ebl correction of vhe data . the @ xmath0 fitted seds are shown in fig . 2 . in addition to the @ xmath0 fit , we can measure the accuracy of the model using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test . considering the behavior of different physical processes ( synchr##otron and ( compton , at substantially different energies ) , and the corresponding values of low - and high - energy data , we used a _ piecewise _ test _ , _ i . e . _ we applied the ks test both to low - and high - energy data . _ the ks test also confirms that the compton residuals are present at 100 % confidence level . our results show that in mkn421 , @ xmath1 decreases with source activity whereas @ xmath15 and @ xmath3 increase ( fig . 2 top ) . this can be interpreted in a frame where the emitted power and peak frequency remain constant with increasing source activity , decreasing the energy and increasing the number of high energy electrons . this also results in an increased electron - hole scattering efficiency and results in an increased compton power . the decay modes are uncorrelated with source activity . in fig . 3 ( bottom ) , the @ xmath1 - @ xmath15 cross - correlation results from a relatively constant synchrotron peak frequency . the @ xmath1 - @ xmath3 correlation suggests that the compton power of mkn421 is still in the upper limit . the @ xmath3 - @ xmat##h15 correlation is an expression of the constant ##s and compton frequencies of the radiation emitted by a plasma in bulk in motion towards the observer .
