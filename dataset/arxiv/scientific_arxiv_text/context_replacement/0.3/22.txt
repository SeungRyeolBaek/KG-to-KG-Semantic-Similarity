the magnitude limited complete census of variable stars in nearby dwarf galaxies allows important contributions to the star formation history of these systems . measurements of the variable stars can provide important age data for the observed system , others will provide important data for the population analysis . different types of stars can greatly influence the understanding of the star formation history of these system , serving as tracers of star formation during different periods . we found the data set of our long term survey program to be especially well suited to study the distribution of the long - period stars and to re - examine the distribution of cepheids with @ xmath1 days as described by sandage & carlson ( 1985 ) . we selected a sample of six local red dwarf irregular galaxies which are visible with the 1 . 8 m telescope of our institute at mt . the observations and additional data from the literature compiled by mateo ( 1998 ) are summarized in table 1 . . names , absolute star counts , absolute @ xmath2 - day changes in stars , and absolute distance estimation in kpc for the six galaxies studied in our project . the data are taken from the literature compilation by mateo ( 1995 ) . for leo , the data are from the work of dolphin et . al ( 2002 ) and from this work . [[ = " < , < , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] @ xmath3 this means the observations so far were carried out in @ xmath4 and @ xmath2 - band , each sampling a two year period , with last observations in 1999 . this part of the data set should be used for long period variable stars with periods up to @ xmath5 days . the data from @ xmath4 , @ xmath2 and @ xmath6 - band were collected during the same periods at the 1 . 23 m telescope on calar alto , sampling for two year time periods . these observations should provide a basis for a search for variable stars with shorter periods , from @ xmath7 days up to @ xmath8 days . the observed data were bias subtracted , re - aligned and gamma rays added . finally , the images from each epoch were astrometrically aligned to a common reference frame and combined with image weights proportional to their @ xmath9 . for each epoch , out of all the stacked images of a single night , a difference image against a single deep reference frame was created using an image ( gssl & riffeser , 2002 , 2003 ) of thealard algorithm ( alard & lupton , 1998 ) . finally , these difference data were convolved with the stellar data . to extract lightcurves from the reduced image , only the pixels deviating significantly ( @ xmath10 ) from the reference image and the minimum number of epochs @ xmath11 are flagged , utilizing the typical per - pixel pulse propagation of our data mining algorithm . then , using these pixels as reference , data and associated information are extracted from the reference image and the lightcurve data are assembled . to account for periodic variations in the observed light curve , the lomb ( 1976 ) algorithm using the data from scargle ( 1982 ) is used . the first analysis was conducted on the hst data set by schulte - ladbeck et al . for the galaxies leo a , and ugca b , we had a very good monitoring and a large fraction of the data passed above the threshold . the leo a data set served as best case : a total of six variable variable candidates were identified . among them , we identified two very important period parameters ( typical period values @ xmath12 , and @ xmath13 , [ 1 ] @ xmath14 ) ,and we have identified further candidates for lpvs . in addition we were able to identify two new candidates for @ xmath0 cephei stars with a fitting periods of 6 . 4 and 1 . 69 days . the second candidate was previously identified by dolphin et al . ( 2002 ) as c2 - v58 with a period of 6 . 4 days . the dolphin et al . period method fails in obtaining a reliable lightcurve with our data , yet , adding our measured value to their data set yields reasonable results . the two best lightcurves for the two @ xmath0 cephei stars are shown in figure 1 . the apparent magnitude as shown in the left corner of figure 1 is based upon the hst data collected by johnson et al . ( 1996 ) and schulte - ladbeck et al . represented by bigger numbers are those variables from our data that lie outside the hst field of view , the @ xmath0 cephei variables in the instability strip ( regions ) and the parameters for long ##ening periods ( triangles ) in the spectrum of the red dwarf . johnson et al . ( 1996 ) based on ground - based observations calculated a distance modulus for leo a of 24 .2000 and a resulting distance of 690 kpc ( see also schulte - ladbeck et al . ) . this result got further support by the search for short period variables with the wiyn telescope for 3 million times in dec . 2000 ( dolphin et al . our data supported this dataset for short periods . the right hand side of figure 1 shows the period - luminosity ( pl ) relation of the smc shifted to the one determined by tolstoy et al . the short period variables discussed by dolphin coincide with the shown pl relation . the overplotted data for the other cepheids from our survey ( crosses ) support this relationship even in the case of shorter periods . we presented the data for our survey for the stars as a sample of the local and dwarf galaxies . for the leo a dwarf galaxy , the best analysed case so far , we already had a total of 26 candidates for variability , 10 of these being short period variables and 10 @ xmath0 cephei ##ds . we compared the later with the period - diameter relation and the short period variables discussed by dolphin et al . we found , that our cepheids strongly supported their relationship and the resulting distance estimate for leo a . this result is used injoint results with the trgb collaboration ( schmidt et al . , schulte - ladbeck et al . ) . the appearance of the lpvs in the color - magnitude diagram indicates that most of them are early asymptotic giant branch stars . while a complete census of these early type stars is impossible for most of the local type stars , a detailed reconstruction of their spectra can allow the reconstruction of the star formation history at the scale of several gyr ##s - assuming the age metalicity degeneracy due to color magnitude diagram errors . we want to thank drs . a . drozdovsky , m . maraston , a . j . schulte - ladbeck , and e . schmidt for their assistance . we have the support of the calar ##co and wendelstein staff . a . fliri and a . riffeser carried out some of our work . the project was funded by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft grant ho 1812 / 3 - 1 and ho 1812 / 3 - 2 . alard , c . & lupton , j . h . , , 503 , 325 smith , r . j . et al . 2002 , , 123 , 3154 gssl r . j .& riffeser a . 2002 , , 381 , 1095 gssl , j . a . & riffeser , a . 2003 , , conf . 295 , 229 lomb j . a . 1976 , , 37 , 447 mateo j . a . 1998 , , 37 , 435 sandage , j . & carlson , j . 1985 , , 37 , 1464 scargle j . a . 1982 , , 263 , 835 schulte - ladbeck a . et al . 2002 , , 124 , 896 sanchez a . et al . 1996 , , 116 , 1244
