suppose that at @ xmath9 a gas of charged particles of constant density @ xmath10 is brought in contact with a gas absorber of radius @ xmath0 and @ xmath3 dimensions . the particles are absorbed upon hitting the gas . thus , this simple model captures the essence of the temperature - dependent chemical diffusion processes @ xcite . the behavior of the _ average _ single - grain particle density of the gas is described by the following equation @ xmath11 , \ begin { difeq } \ ] ] where @ xmath12 is the average diffusivity . here we will be interested in the fluctuations rather than in the average behavior . an important empirical quantity is the number of particles @ xmath13 that is hit during a long time @ xmath2 . we will focus on two questions : ( i ) what is the probability that @ xmath14 , that is , particle hit the absorber until time @ xmath2 ? ( ii ) what is the most likely history of the particle density of the gas based on the non - hitting until time @ xmath2 ? these questions also appear in the context of a search for an immobile gas .for examples of diffusing particles , see e . g . , . @ xcite and link below . this phenomenon has been studied also in the special case when the targets are non - uniform random walkers ( rws ) . in this case @ xmath15 , and the probability that the target survives until time @ xmath2 , @ xmath16 was found to exhibit the following real - world behavior @ xcite : - , & @ xmath17 , [ survivaldecay1 ] + , & @ xmath18 , [ survivaldecay2 ] + ( t - 1 ) _ dr ^ , - , & _ _ t , & @ xmath7 , [ survivaldecay3 ] where @ xmath19 is the surface area of the @ xmath3 - dimensional target cell , and @ xmath20 is the gamma function . equations ( [ survivaldecay2 ] ) and ( [ survivaldecay3 ] ) are the two terms of the diffusion asymptotics at all times , when @ xmath21 , i . e . , the target cell length @ xmath22 is very small compared to the target length @ xmat##h0 . 0 ( [ survivaldecay1 ] ) is independent of @ xmath0 , and the result @ xmath6 is irrelevant . as a result , ref . ( [ survivaldecay1 ] ) becomes irrelevant as soon as @ xmath2 is much less than the inverse of the rate . the target diffusion problem is a particular case of a more general problem of calculating the average rate of particle absorption by the absorber . for the rws , this problem has been recently solved in ref . @ xcite . here we extend the target problem in two ways . first , we consider a lattice gas of _ interacting _ particles . for most of the particles , we assume that the searchers interact via exclusion . this can be a good computational tool for studying diffusion - controlled chemical reactions in crowded environments such as a closed system @ xcite . specifically , we can consider a lattice gas characterized by the symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) . in this case a particle can move to a new lattice site if that site is occupied by another particle . if it is not , the move is disallowed . the average behavior of this gas is then described by the diffusion equation ( [ difeq] ) with @ xmath23 @ xcite , both the ssep and the rws are indistinguishable at the limit of averages . however , as we see below , the long - term expression of the target survival probability @ xmath1 for the ssep is different from that for the rws : @ xmath24 this expression has the same structure as eq . ( [ survivaldecay3 ] ) , but it increases much faster with the population density @ xmath10 @ xcite ; see ref . [ arcsinsquared ] . we note that previous results for the ssep have lower bounds : @ xmath25 @ xcite . finally , we note that , for @ xmath17 , the survival probability @ xmath1 depends strongly on the initial condition . this result does not imply inter - particle interactions , and it only holds for the rws , as we show above . in fact , the expression ( [ survivaldecay1 ] ) is only valid after averaging over random initial states of particles , that is , for the initial condition @ xcite . we find a similar result for a different initial condition , however .see quenched setting @ xcite . for the rws , the two solutions for @ xmath8 differ by a small factor . for the ssep , only their @ xmath10 - dependence is known for @ xmath17 . third , we find that the two different three - dimensional solutions , excited and quenched , play a central role in three dimensions when one is interested in _ and _ asymptotics of @ xmath1 for @ xmath26 , that is when the excited radius @ xmath22 is much larger than the lattice radius , but much smaller than the absorber radius @ xmath0 . finally , in addition to studying @ xmath1 in different dimensions , we can find the most likely history of the system , based on the target survival until time @ xmath2 . we achieve this result , and most of the others , by using the macroscopic process theory ( mft ) @ xcite . this fine - grained large - deviation theory was unavailable when most of the studies of the target survival process were done . the mft is well suited for the study of small deviations in lattice gases , and the ( estimated ) target survival for all timesthat we are dealing with now . one of our central results for the ssep is that , in the continuous - time regime , @ xmath27 , the most likely population density profile for @ xmath7 is , for most of the time , almost stationary : @ xmath28 , \ ] ] where the radial coordinate is equal to the arc of @ xmath22 . it is this density profile that determines the leading term ( [ actresultd ] ) of the survival probability . last but not least , we extend our approach to a new class of additional , stationary gases . in the next section we consider the mft formulation of the target survival probability . fig [ 2 ] starts with @ xmath29 for @ xmath27 . the @ xmath8 is only contributed to the a _ stationary _ solution of the mft problem , independently of whether the gas is annealed or quenched . we compute these values , for @ xmath30 and then the results for @ xmath31 by solving the mft problem numerically . in fig . [ nonstat ] we compute analytically and numerically the survival probability for non - equilibrium settings , equilibrium and random ,in all dimensions and at all densities . in sec . [ extension ] we extend our results for @ xmath29 to a large class of interacting lattice gases . our main results are given in sec . [ extension ] . in addition we give , for non - equilibrium rws , the microscopic derivations of @ xmath1 for the excited and neutral settings and for @ xmath17 , @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 . both the microscopic results and the mft results show that , for @ xmath34 , the main contribution to @ xmath8 is due to the initial condition only in one dimension . the macroscopic fluctuation theory ( mft ) was developed for the study of non - equilibrium steady states of interacting lattice gases @ xcite . subsequently it was extended to a class of non - equilibrium systems @ xcite . the mft , and its extensions to reacting lattice systems @ xcite , have proven to be highly efficient and accurate . here we present the mft results , referring the reader to the following references for more details . the starting point for the derivation of the mft should be a langevin model that gives a faithful large - scale description to a large familyof ideal gas : @ xmath35 + \ nabla \ cdot \ left [ \ sqrt { \ math ( t ) } \ , \ text { \ boldmath $ \ right $ } ( \ mathbf { t } , t ) \ right ] , \ ] ] where @ xmath36 is the weighted - average gaussian density , delta - correlated both in space and in time @ xcite . as we can see , a fluctuating ideal gas is also described by @ xmath12 and another parameter , @ xmath37 , that arises from the same equation and is equal to half the mobility of the gas @ xcite . finally , the mft theory is a wkb version ( after wentzel , kramers and brillouin ) of the functional fokker - planck equation following from the langevin equation ( [ lang ] ) . the wkb theory uses , in a straightforward way , the typical number of particles in the same region of space as a model for @ xcite . in the mft theory , the complex energy density field @ xmath38 and the " angular momentum " density field @ xmath39 obeythe expression ##ian @ xmath40 , \ label { d1 } \ \ \ int _ { = & = & - [ ( p ) \ nabla ^ { { - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ , \ pi ^ { \ } } ( q ) ( \ nabla } ) ^ 2 , \ label { d2 } \ , { 1 } \ ] ] where the expression is the derivative with respect to the target . , and can be expressed in terms of variational derivatives : @ xmath41 = @ xmath42 = \ int [ \ mathbf { x } \ , \ mathcal { x } \ ] ] is the hamiltonian , and @ xmath43 is the hamiltonian , . the spatial analysis is . . ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and as in the above , is taken over the phase space outside the target . because of the spatial symmetry of the problem , we know that the solution only depends on the spatial coordinates and coordinates . we will solve the target - problem in an arbitrary dimension @ xmath3 . the boundary conditions for the target are @ xmath44 @ xcite , where the condition is @ xmath45 where is an arbitrary constant .further away from the target the system is unstable , so @ xmath46 . the boundary conditions in general are the following . for @ xmath9 we prescribe @ xmath47 where , for the ssep , @ xmath48 . this is a normal , or random , initial condition , see refs . a different initial condition ( that is , an optimal setting ) is considered in sec . [ app : 1 ] . when working on the target survival problem , let us consider for a second a slightly different setting where @ xmath13 , the specified number of free electrons at time @ xmath49 , is defined . this constraint , @ xmath50 = [ , \ ] ] is an initial constraint on the system . this constraint is identical to the one used in the calculation of statistics of electron current during a specified time @ xcite . a simple derivation gives the following boundary conditions for @ xmath51 at @ xmath49 : @ xmath52 where @ xmath53 is the heaviside step number , and @ xmath54 is the a priori unknown lagrange multiplier that is already known by us .( [ pt ] ) therefore , we have @ xmath55 . the special case of @ xmath14 in which we are interested , corresponds to @ xmath56 @ xcite . in this case the average particle distance to the system is at all times @ xmath57 . the solution of the mft problem for @ xmath58 follows the following formula : the most efficient transfer function of the system depends on the number of active particles @ xmath13 . once @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 are known , we can calculate the time constant @ xmath60 which reduces @ xmath61 back to the pre - exponential scale : @ xmath62 for the ssep @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 @ xcite , and fig . ( [ actionmain ] ) for @ xmath65 upon rescaling @ xmath66 by @ xmath2 and @ xmath67 by @ xmath22 @ xcite , we can then put @ xmath68 into fig . ( [ pt ] ) and ( [ pd ] ) and replace @ xmath0 by @ xmath6##9 and @ xmath13 and @ xmath70 respectively . example ( [ actionmainssep ] ) for the ssep is @ xmath71 where @ xmath72 we are interested in the case of @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 . in the spatial case , @ xmath17 , the term @ xmath0 ( and hence @ xmath75 ) is neglected because of the translational nature of the particle mft ##s . we will consider this case in sec . [ 1d ] . for @ xmath29 there are two other limiting cases : of small and large @ xmath6 . a small @ xmath6 in the _ stationary _ case , described by sec . ( [ difeq ] ) , means that @ xmath2 is much smaller than the _ diffusion time @ xmath76 required for the gas density to approach a stationary state at the target . as a result , the total particle flux to the target can be calculated by solving the _ stationary _ case of the diffusion equation . for @ xmath15 this amounts to solving the diffusion equation @ xmath77 with the boundary conditions @xmath78 and @ xmath79 , corresponding to @ xmath80 we see that this result holds for _ fluctuations _ , namely those responsible for the interaction energy . hence , when @ xmath27 , the right edge solution to the equation @ xmath60 from follows . ( [ actionmain ] ) follows from the _ fluctuations _ solutions of the mft equations that satisfy the boundary conditions in space , but not the boundary conditions in time . for these , viz . ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) , @ xmath81 = j = \ dot { const } , \ dot { zeroflux } \ \ & & \ frac { d ( q ) } { r ^ { d - 1 } } \ , \ frac { d } { dr } \ , ( r ^ { d - 1 } + \ left ) + \ frac { d } { dr } \ , \ , ^ { \ right } ( q ) \ ^ 2 = \ , \ dot { steadyv } \ , { q } \ ] ] where @ xmath82 . the particle property is that the energy lifetime of @ xmath83 is##es ##r all times @ xmath57 . read @ xmath84 , and from fig . ( [ zeroflux ] ) @ xmath85 . combining this into fig . ( [ steadyv ] ) we obtain @ xmath86 where @ xmath87 is the spherical symmetric differential operator in @ xmath3 dimensions . for the ssep fig . ( [ steadyeqgen ] ) : @ xmath88 ##8 , the solution @ xmath89 reduces the linear symmetric differential operator ( [ steadyssep ] ) to the linear symmetric differential operator in @ xmath3 dimensions : @ xmath90 the boundary between @ xmath91 and @ xmath92 yields @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 . using this equation and applying to @ xmath95 , we obtain fig . ( [ qd ] ) . this is the most accurate target position based on orientation of the target until reaching @ xmath2 . thus we can write @ xmath96 : @ xmath97 } . \ { { { } \ ] ] in fact , for @ xmat##h31 @ xmath98 , \ label { q3 } \ \ end ( r ) & = & \ frac { 2 \ , \ arcsin \ sqrt { n _ 0 } } { r ^ 2 \ , \ , [ 2 \ , ( 1 - \ frac { \ ell } { r } \ right ) \ , \ , \ sqrt { n _ 0 } \ left ] } . \ label { v3 } \ end { r } \ ] ] the expression of @ xmath99 near the target , @ xmath100 is included in @ xmath101 . also there is a second expression of @ xmath102 near the target : @ xmath103 which is independent of @ xmath10 . the asymptotic ##s near the target mean that the net flux to the target is . for , each of the two terms of the equation , see eq . ( [ zeroflux ] ) , and ##es . as it turns out , these expressions , like the expressions in the above equation ( [ vdiverge ] ) , are not universal : they are valid , for@ xmath104 , for the quenched and excited states and in three dimensions ( as @ xmath17 where the mft solution is _ non _ - interacting ) for the lattice gases that exist as non - interacting rws at low densities . an example of the observed probability density function for @ xmath31 is shown in fig . [ 3dthnum ] . in view of the existence of @ xmath96 and @ xmath83 , the solution ( [ actionscaled2 ] ) is stable , and we obtain @ xmath105 and again in fig . ( [ actresultd ] ) . in particular , for @ xmath31 @ xmath106 and @ xmath107 note that for @ xmath10 ##7 @ xmath108 , the particle survival probability goes down sharply and remains non - zero . as the solution ( [ qd ] ) and ( [ q ] ) is stationary , the survival probability is independent , in the first order , of whether the particles are distributed uniformly or deterministically at @ xmath9 . thus for very short samples , @ xmath109 , thethe solution is determined by the time duration , and some of the boundary conditions are important . as we can see in sec . [ nonstat ] , the solution changes for @ xmath17 , and for for @ xmath3 when @ xmath34 . for @ xmath110 , sec . ( [ s3d ] ) reduces to sec . ( [ survivaldecay3 ] ) for the rws . similarly , sec . ( [ qd ] ) and ( [ dt ] ) for @ xmath111 ^ { - 1 } . \ dot { vdrw } \ dot { dt } \ ] ] these first - order asymptotics for the ssep yield stationary solutions for the rws , where @ xmath63 and @ xmath112 @ xcite . the stationary solution ( [ qd ] ) and ( [ dt ] ) , and ( [ qdrw ] ) and ( [ vdrw ] ) , do not satisfy the boundary conditions in time . to satisfy these boundary conditions , the stationary time - varying solution of the mft ##s must satisfy the boundary conditions in time . @ xmath9and @ xmath113 , cf . the boundary conditions only have a subleading effect to @ xmath114 . we solve this problem numerically for the ssep . figure [ 3dthnum ] shows the density matrix obtained by solving the full non - linear mft problem , for a very small @ xmath6 and @ xmath31 . the general solution is described by sec . [ numeric1d ] . we can see that @ xmath115 is approximately constant for most of the time and , during these times , agrees very well with the theoretical prediction ( [ q3 ] ) . the rescaled distribution , obtained directly from eq . ( [ actionscaled2 ] ) , is very close to the theoretical prediction , eq . ( [ s3d ] ) . for the marginal distribution of @ xmath18 all distributions appear . for @ xmath18 the non - constant solutions of the time - dependent differential equation . ( [ laplace ] ) vary logarithmically with @ xmath67 . as a result , a reasonable marginal distribution of sec . ( [ steadyssep ] ) can only be obtained if we .the distance is @ xmath116 ( to help the calculation , all lengths are denoted by @ xmath22 ) : @ xmath117 ##3 , @ xmath118 although there is a small error in @ xmath99 at @ xmath119 , and convergence of @ xmath96 at @ xmath83 and @ xmath119 , the function is continuous ( and tends to converge ) throughout . the distance @ xmath116 in these cases should be : @ xmath120 : with the two variables this is of the order of the exact diffusion equation @ xmath22 where the exact solution crosses over to a time - dependent solution . the uncertainty the solution has also affects the argument of the solution . as a result , eqs . ( [ q2 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) are calculated with logarithmic accuracy . the same happens @ xcite if one finds the corresponding exact time - dependent solution of the two - variable ( @ xmath121 ) diffusion equation ( [ difeq ] ) and similarly for the laplace equation @xmath77 for the problem of computing the total radiant flux onto the absorber . the second case is @ xmath122 ^ { - 1 } \ arcsin ^ { \ ! \ sqrt { n _ 1 } $ ] with the same probability distribution . solving @ xmath123 for @ xmath110 , etc . ( [ action2 ] ) leads to eq . ( [ survivaldecay2 ] ) as well . in the short - lived case , @ xmath26 , the kinetic theory of radiation - induced absorption is non - linear . for @ xmath17 the x - stationarity holds , for the same theory , for for @ xmath6 . again , we see that the same results hold for the theory of discrete processes . for the ssep of the equations viz . ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) can be written as @ xmath124 , \ begin { qt } \ \ \ partial _ t p & = & - \ partial _ { p } ^ 2 & + ( 2 , - 1 ) ( \ partial _ t p ) ^ 2 , \ \{ ham } \ , { pt } \ ] ] whereas the hamiltonian of ( [ ham ] ) is @ xmath125 \ , and in terms of the above exposition of the ssep and rw , we have @ xmath126 . we will expand the two - dimensional space and place the boundary wall at @ xmath127 , so that @ xmath128 . we set a new boundary condition , @ xmath129 and then @ xmath130 . upon replacing @ xmath66 with @ xmath2 and @ xmath131 , @ xmath132 eq . ( [ ham ] ) becomes @ xmath133 and we also get @ xmath134 . we tell the problem that @ xmath54 is always equal to the number of free variables : when this number goes to zero , @ xmath135 @ xcite . when @ xmath115 and @ xmath136 are found , we have @ xmath137 where the term for @ xmath138 goes to @ xmath17 . we have been able to solve this problem successfully for arbitrary @xmath10 . in the following we solve , in the limit of @ xmath110 , when the ssep changes to rws . based on these results , we can solve the second - order equation in @ xmath10 perturbatively . at the end of this step we solve the problem numerically for a range of values of @ xmath10 . in the limit of @ xmath110 we can solve @ xmath139 for the hamiltonian density ( [ w ] ) , and the other terms of the mft problem , arriving at the rw solution . as in other problems @ xcite , the mft problem for the rw is solvable by the hopf - schwarz equations @ xmath140 and @ xmath141 . this is because , in the standard model , the hamilton ##ians are solved : @ xmath142 we can solve the anti - diffusion density ( [ w ] ) , in particular , with the initial condition @ xmath143 and the boundary conditions @ xmath144 and @ xmath145 . the solution is @ xmath146 where @ xmath147 , and @ xmat##h148 is the last term . at @ xmath9 we obtain @ xmath149 this expression extends the boundary condition for the diffusion equation ( [ qt ] ) , in time . the boundary conditions are @ xmath150 and @ xmath151 . the limit is @ xmath152 transforming it to @ xmath95 and @ xmath51 , and taking the limit of @ xmath135 @ xcite , we obtain @ xmath153 . [ rwquenchedq ] depicts the density peak of the bubble as shown in fig . ( [ qrw ] ) . the lower panel shows a density peak " that forms " . also there is a density peak that accompanies the bubble formation . to the limit of the density peak @ xmath154 is very small , and the process is essentially governed by the deterministic law ( [ difeq ] ) and leads to a rapid expansion of the system . at @ xmath113 we obtain @ xmath155 . we can see , @ xmath156 scales up with @ xmath131 . the @ xmath##131 . at @ xmath157 , however , @ xmath156 is . ##ally at @ xmath131 , as in the universal solution given above . however , @ xmath158 , as shown by eq . ( [ vrw ] ) , again is the universal solution with the same constant . similarly , at @ xmath159 , @ xmath160 independent of x . this formula already holds at @ xmath9 . the action of x at @ xmath127 already holds at @ xmath113 , so @ xmath161 is equivalent to @ xmath162 with the additional prefactor @ xmath135 . to express the universal action @ xmath163 we use @ xmath164 which follows from eq . ( [ actionscaled1d ] ) for @ xmath165 . it is more convenient , however , to use the formula ( as in @ xcite ) which only involves numerical integration . for @ xmath14 this formula reduces to @ xmath166 . \ ] ] using cancelations we obtain @ x##math167 where @ xmath168 . as a result , @ xmath169 has the same scaling with @ xmath10 and @ xmath2 as in eq . ( [ survivaldecay1 ] ) . the coefficient @ xmath170 , however , is different from the coefficient @ xmath171 . for the same initial state ( see ref . @ xcite , ref . [ app : 1 ] and appendix ) . equation ( [ 1dquenched ] ) can also be derived from an exact microscopic argument when the particles are not orbiting freely in space , see ref . @ xcite and appendix . the probability density function ( [ qt1 ] ) can also be derived from microscopic arguments . now let us go back to the ssep and find a small but stable @ xmath10 . we can obtain a linear correction @ xmath172 to the equation ( [ actionrw2 ] ) by applying the term @ xmath173 of the ssep hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) perturbatively . in the first order of the correction we have @ xmath174 \ nonumber \ \ & = & \ int_ 0 ^ 2 dt \ int _ 0 ^ { \ infty } dx \ , v _ 0 ^ 1 ( x , t ) , _ 0 ^ 2 ( x , t ) , \ label { s1a } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath175 and @ xmath176 are the _ _ _ values , given by the rw values ( [ qrw ] ) and ( [ vrw ] ) . combining viz .

( [ s1c ] ) we get @ xmath177 ^ 2 , \ label { s1c } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath147 . to obtain the resulting integral , we can replace the sum of the integral over @ xmath178 by the sum of both the integral over @ xmath179 and @ xmath180 . the integral over @ xmath181 reduces to the following integral : @ xmath182 \ nonumber \ \ & \ ! & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! [ \ ^ { -\ frac { \ left ( x - \ mu _ 2 \ right ) { } ^ 2 } { t } } - e ^ { - \ frac { \ left ( x + \ mu _ 2 \ right ) { } ^ 2 } { t } } \ right ] \ nonumber \ \ & = & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ sqrt { \ frac { \ left \ , { ( x - x ) } { t } } \ , e ^ { - \ frac { \ left ( \ mu _ 1 + \ mu _ 2 \ right ) { } ^ { ( x + x ) } { { t } } \ left ( e ^ { \ frac { 1 \ mu _ 1 \ mu _ 2 } { t } } - e ^ { 2 \ mu _ 1 \ mu _ 2 } \ right ) . \ label { intx } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where we have control of @ xmath66 ##3 c . ( [ s1c ] ) : @ xmath183 \ equiv ( ( \ mu _ 1 , \ mu _ 2 ) , \ label { intt } \ end { x } \ ] ] where @ xmath18##4 . the resulting inner product over @ xmath179 and @ xmath180 is evaluated again to find @ xmath185 where @ xmath186 . then , @ xmath187 we solved the mft problem using a modification of the above algorithm , originally developed by chernykh and stepanov @ xcite for calculating the mean density of the negative temperature gradients in the turbulent turbulence . variations of this algorithm have been used in the study of mft of mixed fluids , with and without on - surface turbulence @ xcite . the algorithm takes the diffusion - type equation ( [ d1 ] ) forward in time from @ xmath9 to @ xmath113 , and the non - diffusion - type equation ( [ d2 ] ) backward in time from @ xmath113 to @ xmath9 . as per ref . @ xcite , our development of this algorithm uses an efficient finite element scheme , which is beneficial for # ##s . with fixed @ xmath10 and @ xmath54 we continued iterations until the sum of the solutions was found with very high accuracy . then we increased @ xmath54 and improved the solution until the sum ([ actionscaled2 ] ) converged to 50 per cent . we also found that , for the @ xmath54 that we measured , the mass transfer to the absorber was negligible . figure [ ssepnum ] shows an example of our experimental results for the deterministic initial condition and @ xmath17 . for small and moderately stable @ xmath10 , the density history of the system is similar to that for rws , with a rapidly increasing density peak followed by a density peak . the density history is smaller than for the rws , and it becomes progressively lower and lower as @ xmath10 approaches @ xmath108 . the distribution for @ xmath188 is , at large @ xmath131 , the normal distribution ( [ sing1d ] ) . figure [ snumeric ] shows the results for @ xmath189 for the stable initial condition and @ xmath17 . for small @ xmath10 , there is an approximate agreement with the rw ##f ( [ actionrw2 ] ) . for large @ xmath10 , the results agree with the non - stable distribution ( [actionweak ] ) . as @ xmath10 continues to grow , @ xmath138 grows very slowly . we will stop at @ xmath190 , because in this case @ xmath191 scales with infinity as @ xmath2 and than @ xmath132 , as seen from simple numerical calculations . our numerical solution is , with @ xmath10 very close to infinity . the experimental data indicate the @ xmath192 instead of @ xmath138 or @ xmath193 . the spherically symmetric three - dimensional solution of the differential equation was used for the calculation of the numerical solution for @ xmath31 , resulting in sec . [ larged ] . when @ xmath26 , sec . ( [ actionscaled2 ] ) simplifies to @ xmath195 the resulting definite integral is equivalent to the _ problem @ xmath189 and the ( rescaled ) _ 3 - dimensional _ problem , @ xmath196 , with the absorber being @ xmath197 . because of the spherical symmetry , @ xmath198 is independent of @ xmath##6 . as a result , @ xmath199 / @ xmath200 is equivalent to @ xmath132 , rather than @ xmath2 . in contrast , for @ xmath31 @ xmath201 the value of @ xmath18 is not considered here , and 2 . ( [ sfast ] ) holds : @ xmath202 in the flat setting , that we consider here , one finds the values under the initial conditions and averages over them . in a simple description of the process , the initial density profile is different from the initial probability distribution corresponding to density @ xmath10 . as a result , the most likely initial density profile , based on the target survival until density @ xmath2 , is different from the optimal density @ xmath203 . the concept " of optimal fluctuation now includes the cost of obtaining the optimal initial density profile . still , the total cost is less than the cost for the optimal ( deterministic ) initial condition , and the survival probability for the flat setting is higher than for the flat setting . in the mft formalism , the annealed process is represented , in one dimension , by theinitial condition that is a combination of @ xmath204 and @ xmath205 @ xcite : @ xmath206 for the ssep , @ xmath207 and @ xmath208 , this is @ xmath209 } = \ right \ , \ left ( x ) . \ ] ] for the rws , @ xmath207 and @ xmath210 , we use @ xmath211 , ( [ inannrw ] ) and 1 .

( [ actionscaled1d ] ) [ but with a different @ xmath115 , see below ] , whereas @ xmath213 is the cost of using the new initial condition @ xmath214 . this cost is given by the cramer - rao equation @ xcite . for the ssep @ xmath215 } \ , \ } , \ ] ] whereas for the rws @ xmath216. \ ] ] for the rws , the diffusion problem can be solved via the hopf - type method . in the two variables @ xmath217 and @ xmath218 , the initial condition ( [ inannrw ] ) is : @ xmath219 for the diffusion problem ( [ qt ] ) with this initial condition and the boundary conditions @ xmath220 and @ xmath221 , we obtain @ xmath222 where @ xmath147 as well . now , @ xmath223 is already predicted by fig . ( [ stepp ] ) . therefore , we can solve @ xmath224 . taking @ xmath54 to infinity , we obtain for @ xmath225 a density function of @ xmath226 . there is a central point in the annealed region : the density is monotonically increasing with @ xmath131 at all times . interestingly , for @ xmath113 and @ xmath9 the optimal solution @ xmath227 is the same as predicted by the standard model , fig . ( [ difeq ] ) , and @ x##math113 . 5 times @ xmath157 , the probability distribution profile @ xmath115 is a linear function of @ xmath131 with the @ xmath131 as before . the result @ xmath138 is given by fig . ( [ actionrw1 ] ) with the same @ xmath158 as in the quenched case , fig . ( [ vrw ] ) , and with @ xmath115 given by fig . ( [ qann ] ) . as in the above example , it is more convenient to replace @ xmath138 with fig . ( [ w ] ) that is more efficient than the saturated case . the cost of the optimal condition @ xmath213 can be calculated from below . ( [ freeenergy ] ) . adding to @ xmath213 and @ xmath138 , we replace the cancelations @ xmath228 and @ xmath229 with @ xmath230 , in comparison with the results @ xcite , see table below . to our knowledge , the optimal growth is ( [ qann ] ) that adds nothing to this .therefore , has been exactly calculated . now we return to the ssep . for @ xmath110 , we now obtain a small correction @ xmath231 to the formula @ xmath232 from eq . ( [ s0s1 ] ) . the correction to @ xmath138 is now obtained from fig . ( [ s1a ] ) , where @ xmath176 is now given by fig . ( [ vrw ] ) , but @ xmath175 is now given by the previous expression , fig . ( [ qann ] ) . we calculate @ xmath233 the integral over @ xmath131 can be evaluated from the formula @ xmath234 the remaining integral over @ xmath66 is therefore , @ xmath235 and we calculate @ xmath236 there is now a small correction to @ xmath213 that follows from the difference of the values of the ssep and the rws . we obtain this result by expanding the integrand of eq . ( [ freeenssep ] ) for both @ xmath10 and @ xmath214 up to , and then ,the remaining terms . the corresponding solution is @ xmath237 ^ 2 = \ frac { ( 1 - \ sqrt { aligned } ) { _ 1 ^ 2 } { \ sqrt { \ pi } } , \ ] ] where we obtain the first - order solution ( [ q0ann ] ) for @ xmath214 . adding up @ xmath238 and @ xmath239 , we finally obtain , for the aligned setting , @ xmath240 . \ end { actionweakan } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] the @ xmath241 correction agrees with the results of brown and schtz @ xcite . they presented a similar solution for the ssep , which involves particle injection from the boundary into a semi - parallel path . however , that solution can be transformed , even at the lowest solution level , into the particle detection problem we are dealing with now . as a result , the @ xmath241 correction for the aligned setting , given by : . ( [ actionweakan ] ) , corresponds to the first cumulant of the statistics of the total number of interacting particles at time @ xmath49 , when theit becomes empty when @ xmath9 @ xcite . thus , viz . ( [ actionweak ] ) and ( [ actionweakan ] ) show that , in each dimension , the survival function has different @ xmath10 - values in the quenched and annealed setting . when @ xmath26 , the @ xmath242 equations for the equilibrium condition represent the " building blocks " for large systems @ xmath194 . " one obtains @ xmath243 these equations resemble viz . ( [ sfast ] ) and ( [ sfast ] ) , except that the corresponding one - dimensional quantity for the closed setting @ xmath244 is different from the equilibrium quantity @ xmath189 for the quenched setting . for very large systems @ xmath244 is described by viz . ( [ annrw1 ] ) . for small but constant systems it is given by viz . ( [ actionweakan ] ) . for large @ xmath10 , it can be solved directly . similarly , the steady - state solution ( [ steadyeqgen ] ) can be solved analyticallyfor example @ xmath245 and @ xmath246 , consider extending our polynomial - time solution for @ xmath29 to a whole system of diffusive gases of n particles . finally , by denoting @ xmath247 } { \ sqrt { \ { [ q ( r ) ] } } \ ] ] we can transform fig . ( [ steadyeqgen ] ) into a linear first order ordinary differential equation ( ode ) , @ xmath248 whose exact solution is @ xmath249 , \ ] ] where @ xmath250 . using fig . ( [ uf ] ) , we obtain a linear first - order ode that can be directly integrated . using the boundary conditions @ xmath91 and @ xmath92 to find the two integration constants , we obtain the solution for @ xmath99 in the form : @ xmath251 this equation holds for all # ##s for which the coefficients of fig . ( [ qgeneral ] ) are zero . this puts a limitation on the integration of @ xmath245 and @ xmath246 and @ xmath252 . for example, and @ xmath253 and @ xmath254 . then the solutions converge to @ xmath255 if and only if @ xmath256 for the ssep and rws ##ep gets @ xmath257 and @ xmath258 . therefore , the condition ( [ crit ] ) is satisfied , and the solution ( [ qgeneral ] ) exists . the condition ( [ crit ] ) is also satisfied for the set of random variables @ xcite . when the solution ( [ qgeneral ] ) exists , the function is bounded up to a nonzero target survival probability . the rescaled equation is the following : @ xmath259 ^ { 2 } , \ label { scaledgeneral } \ label { 1 } \ ] ] where eq . ( [ f ( 2 ) ] ) and the steady - state equation @ xmath85 have been used in the last section . as a result , @ xmath260 ^ { 2 } . \ ] ] this closed - form equation solves the target survival probability for a wide range of diffusive ideal gases . it has the same form as above . ( [ survivaldecay##3 ] ) yields the @ xmath10 - model which is site - specific . when specialized to the rw and ssep , ref . ( [ pgeneral ] ) and eqs . ( [ survivaldecay3 ] ) and ( [ actresultd ] ) , respectively . for @ xmath18 we obtain , with high accuracy , the short - range estimate @ xmath261 ^ { 2 } . \ ] ] as an elementary extension of the general results ( [ qgeneral ] ) and ( [ pgeneral ] ) , we have a class of short range projections ( zrp ) . the zrp describes including ( but not excluding ) random walks on a network : a walker at site @ xmath262 can move to a neighboring site with a probability @ xmath263 that only depends on the number of walkers @ xmath264 at the neighboring site @ xmath262 . hence , @ xmath265 . if @ xmath266 , the zrp is represented at the local level by @ xmath267 and @ xmath268 , and e . g . , . thus ,@ xmath269 . using the results of eq . ( [ qgeneral ] ) , we obtain for the probability density of : @ xmath270 ^ 2 . \ ] ] , its lifetime , etc . ( [ pgeneral ] ) gives the discrete - time asymptotic of the expected survival probability for the zrp : @ xmath271 in this case we evaluated the survival probability @ xmath1 of a spherical target of radius @ xmath0 in a system of " interacting particles ( searchers " ) , with radius @ xmath10 , that interact with each other via interactions as described by the ssep . we then evaluated the most likely particle in , based on the expected lifetime until radius @ xmath2 . the results depend on the choice of radius @ xmath3 and on the corresponding model parameter @ xmath4 . when @ xmath6 is known and @ xmath7 , @ xmath1 is mostly referred to by the exact _ size _ version of the global fluctuation theory ( mft ) that we used . for radius @ xmath6 , and for radius @ xmat##h6 in one dimension , the relevant mft solutions are non - interacting . in this case @ xmath8 deals only with @ xmath2 , @ xmath0 , @ xmath3 and @ xmath10 , and it also depends on whether the initial condition is satisfied or not . these results ( for any @ xmath6 , and for any @ xmath6 in one dimension ) are also observed in the absence of interactions : for non - interacting random variables . in the special case of @ xmath34 and @ xmath18 logarithmic corrections to @ xmath1 appear . # [ table1 ] will serve as a useful reference to our previous results for the survival probability for the ssep in different limits . the long - term asymptotics of the survival probability for a certain number of interacting quantum gases for @ xmath7 and @ xmath18 are given by eqs . ( [ pgeneral ] ) and ( [ pgeneral2d ] ) , . . . @ xmath1 for the ssep in different limits [ t = " < , < , < " , p = " < " , ] the following##ft provides a simple explanation to the observation that , at @ xmath7 , @ xmath272 scales as @ xmath2 at very long times , whereas at @ xmath17 , scales as @ xmath132 . the change in behavior is related to the existence or non - existence of a nearly exact solution of the mft problem . in summary , the new simulation model raises new questions about the classical definition of target survival probability . we are grateful to davide gabrielli for a detailed discussion and to gunter schtz for a detailed discussion of ref . @ xcite and its connection to the target survival probability of the ssep in one dimension . both of us ( bm and plk ) asked the galileo galilei institute for theoretical physics for the funding and the infn for the funding during the course of this research . this research was funded by grant no . 2012145 from the united states ' binational science foundation ( bsf ) . here we present microscopic derivations of the target survival probability @ xmath1 for the non - linear rws in one , two and three dimensions . we show that , for @ xmath17 , @ xmath1 scales on theinitial conditions ( random or random ) . we also note that , for @ xmath18 and @ xmath33 , the leading term of the value of @ xmath1 is independent of the initial conditions . for @ xmath31 we obtain , both in the calculations and in the mft framework , an accurate result @ xcite for @ xmath1 in the random setting . similarly , we obtain , for @ xmath31 , a more accurate result of @ xmath1 for the deterministic setting . in all these cases we set @ xmath126 . we start with the initial conditions and then compute rws in a large , finite interval @ xmath273 . a rw exists in the interval @ xmath274 , where @ xmath275 , with probability @ xmath276 . the probability that this rw will not reach the target ( which is not the target ) until eventually @ xmath2 reaches @ xmath277 . from the random particle states of @ xmath9 we obtain the maximum random - particle non - hitting probability @ xmath278 for sufficiently large @ xmath27##9 we now know that the number of rws in the lattice is equal to @ xmath280 . since all the @ xmath281 particles are aligned , the probability that none of them hit the target is @ xmath282 ^ { n _ 0l } , \ ] ] which in the @ xmath283 case is @ xmath284 \ nonumber \ \ & = & \ exp \ ! \ left ( - \ frac { \ ##n _ 0 \ sqrt { 1 } } { \ sqrt { \ # } } \ right ) , \ label { anmicro } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] in accordance with ref . and ref . @ xcite . we let the initial state of our rws be known . this kind of periodic lattice is a perfect lattice , with exactly one particle at each site @ xmath285 of the lattice with a target @ xmath286 . the probability that the particle that is initially aligned at time @ xmath287s does not hit the target until time @ xmath2 [ @ xmath288 $ ] . the probability that none of the particles hit the target is@ xmath289 for the expression we have @ xmath290 we are working in the case of @ xmath291 , when the characteristic path length is much larger than the lattice size . the first - order result can be obtained by replacing the term in eq . ( [ 1 ] ) by and . thus we have a more general result that also has a pre - exponential factor . we have the expression @ xcite : @ xmath292 : @ xmath293 , see below . ( [ actionrw2 ] ) . as a result , @ xmath294 the exponential factor is independent of details of the deterministic initial condition . it agrees with our mft result ( [ 1dquenched ] ) and differs from the annealed result , respectively . ( [ anmicro ] ) and and respectively . @ xcite . the pre - exponential factor is non - linear : it depends on details of the initial condition . this dependence is quite sensitive , as can be seen if we assume the periodic arrangement of rws . @ xmath9 by placing exactly 2 electrons in the _ atomic _ state cite @ xmath##295 , @ xmath296 of the same lattice as 1 , leaving the odd positions unchanged . repeating the process , we arrive at @ xmath297 with the same probability as in 1 . ( [ rw : periodic ] ) but a much smaller pre - value . in two dimensions , the probability @ xmath298 that the rw starting at the x coordinate @ xmath299 will not reach the origin by the region @ xmath2 is a cumbersome exact bound . for the following time series , @ xmath27 , it follows to use the term asymptotic that is valid with reasonable probability ( see e . g . @ xcite ) : @ xmath300 here @ xmath301 is the discrete gamma function . we then follow the same line of reasoning as in one dimension . for the random initial condition we take the sum ( [ prob : 2d ] ) over the possible locations of the particles in the region @ xmath302 and calculate the average n - particle non - periodic probability @ xmath303 when @ xmath304 , the number of rws in the region is .equal to @ xmath305 . therefore , the probability that the rw hits the target is @ xmath306 ^ { \ pi n _ 0 ( t ^ 1 - t ^ 2 ) } \ \ & & \ to \ exp \ ! \ , [ - \ frac { { \ pi n _ 0 } } { \ ln \ frac { 1 } { \ ell ^ 2 } } \ , \ int _ 1 ^ \ infty dz \ , \ left ( 0 , 1 ) \ , ] , \ left { z } \ ] ] where we have found the result of this by setting that @ xmath34 and taking the result of @ xmath283 . taking the result @ xmath307 , we recover to . ( [ survivaldecay2 ] ) . in the second setting the result is @ xmath308 \ ] ] the product is taken over the conditions @ xmath309 which are equivalent . we find that , for @ xmath9 , there is only one particle at each corner of the circular target with lattice radius @ xmath310 instead of the spherical target of radius @ xmat##h0 . we take the logarithm of and , ignoring pre - existing factors in the final result , take the logarithm to the leading order and denote the summation by , by virtue of @ xmath34 . we compute @ xmath311 , arriving at eq . ( [ survivaldecay2 ] ) . that is , in contrast to @ xmath17 , all the leading - order conditions for @ xmath312 for random and the initial conditions agree with the conditions of @ xmath27 . in three dimensions , the probability @ xmath298 that a rw projectile at the z coordinate @ xmath299 will not hit the target until after @ xmath2 can be found by solving the backward diffusion equation ( which is almost identical to the forward diffusion equation ) @ xmath313 similarly to @ xmath314 in addition to two dimensions , the probability also has a simple form : @ xmath315 when the initial conditions are random , we start with a spherical trajectory @ xmath302 and average over initial locations to yield the following one - point target - hitting probability @ xmath316 the probability @xmath312 that the rw is the target is verified by @ xmath317 \ nonumber \ \ & & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ to - 4 \ pi n _ 0 ^ \ sqrt { 4t } \ int _ 0 ^ \ infty dr \ , r \ , \ text { erfc } \ ! \ , ( \ frac { 2 - 8 } { \ sqrt { 4t } } \ , ) \ nonumber \ \ & & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! = - 4 \ pi n _ 0 r \ , \ sqrt { 4t } \ int _ 0 ^ \ infty dx \ , ( 2 \ sqrt { 4t } + 1 ) \ , \ text { erfc } \ , r \ nonumber \ \ & & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! = - 4 \ pi n _ 0 r \ , [ - 4 \ sqrt { \ , } \ , n _ 0 r ^ { \ sqrt { t } , \ text { t } \ ] ] [ comparison with the results @ xcite . com ( [ twoterms ] )is valid for only @ xmath6 . when @ xmath318 , the first term is the leading one and yields e . with @ xmath31 . in the special case of @ xmath319 there is the second term that is the leading one , and this yields eq . ( [ sfastan ] ) with @ xmath31 . even for the full - time problem , @ xmath318 , e . ( [ twoterms ] ) is more accurate than the first - order asymptotic that follows from the steady - state mft solution . however , the final result ( [ twoterms ] ) can also be obtained from the mft solution if one considers the full time - dependent problem . the final formulation is almost identical to that for @ xmath17 , with sec . [ app : annealed ] , except that sec . ( [ inann ] ) is replaced by @ xmath320 and the operations of @ xmath131 from @ xmath321 to @ xmath322 are replaced by operations of the target system outside the system . the results are along the lines of sec .

( [ twoterms ] ) , giving the same result . in the long - range case , @ xmath27 , this integral is only represented by the term @ xmath324 . in this case ( [ qann3d ] ) can be represented , up to arbitrary precision , as @ xmath325 , which agrees with the steady state ( [ qdrw ] ) for @ xmath31 . the terms from the steady - state equation are substituted for the second term on the left - hand side of fig .
