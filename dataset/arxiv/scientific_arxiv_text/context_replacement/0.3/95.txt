this is one of the important problems in statistical mechanics , mainly because it can induce additional symmetry and reduce the system to energy rich low - temperature states . the so - called two - dimensional ( 2d ) fully frustrated xy models have undergone an extensive investigation in the last two years @ xcite . due to the frustration the models possess only discrete reflection symmetry @ xmath7 , apart from the full spin rotation symmetry @ xmath8 . the breakdown of these symmetries is the result of two types of phase transitions , namely one leading to the magnetic transition of kosterlitz - thouless ( k ) type @ xcite and the other to the chiral ordering . whether these transitions are decoupled or occur at the same temperature has long been a question @ xcite . another important question is whether the universality class of the chiral ordering corresponds to the ising ##lass class or not @ xcite . the system has a corresponding physical realization on both planar domains of coupled josephson junctions in a transverse magnetic field @ xcite and discotic cubic crystals @ xcite . in a k - xy system , two lattice ##s are frequently studied numerically . the first one is the square lattice where the lattice will be a complex mixture of ferro##magnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) models ( villain model ) @ xcite . the other one is the af ##f model for the triangular lattice @ xcite . as for the af xy model , the effect of the @ xmath9 - fold symmetry - breaking fields is an open problem @ xcite ; that is , the same as treating the @ xmath9 - state clock model , where only the magnetic fields are used for the angle of the xy spins . the @ xmath8 symmetry of the villain model is replaced by the 2d @ xmath10 symmetry of the @ xmath9 - state clock model . it is from @ xcite that the 2d @ xmath9 - state clock model has two phase transitions of the form at @ xmath11 and @ xmath0 ( @ xmath12 ) for @ xmath13 . there is an intermediate well - ordered phase , a low - temperature ordered phase ( @ xmath14 ) and a high - temperature disordered phase ( @ xmath15 ) . it is quite difficult to investigate the effect of the @ xmath9 - fold symmetry - breaking fields on theinstead of the fully ordered lattice ##s . quite recently , noh _ et al . _ @ xcite modeled the af six - hour clock cycle on the cubic lattice using the same monte carlo simulation because of the experimental results to the @ xmath16br monolayers physisorbed on graphite @ xcite . however , they did not pay attention to the lower order phase transition of this type . it is to be noted that the existing controversy has very high values . the studies on single transition scenario still do not consider the possibility of two very different critical temperatures . meanwhile , the studies in favor of double transition scenario always found that the critical phase transitions occur at slightly higher temperatures . therefore , it is desirable to provide more detailed information . recently , much progress has been made in the development of the field of monte carlo simulation . especially , several algorithms have been proposed for the monte carlo method to calculate the energy density of systems ( dos ) directly . examples are the multicanonical method @ xcite , the vector histogram method @ xcite , the random vector method @ xcite , and the wang and landau method @ xcite . all of these algorithms use the random walk in the state space . in this paper we report our monte carlobased on the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice . the ground state ( gs ) of the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice has the same configuration as the af clock villain ; therefore this model is regarded as a suitable gs model for the fully frustrated villain model . on the other hand , the eight - state clock model on the square lattice ( villain model ) has different gs configurations since there exist extra degeneracies . the discovery of such gs configurations may bring about another interest in the fully frustrated six - state clock model . however , we will not cover this topic in the main article . the xy villain and the eight - state clock villain models are similar because they have the same gs configuration . for the monte carlo method , we use the wang - landau algorithm @ xcite , and the resulting model is refined by the use of the quantum histogram relation @ xcite . the fact that the energy of the six - state clock model is given by the value of @ xmath17 , where @ xmath18 is the coupling constant , is an important fact for the study of the six - state clock model ; it is convenient to treat the energy as the monte carlosimulation of calculating the dos directly . the text of the original paper is given as follows : in the first section we define the model and we explain the simulation results . details of the calculation and results will be published in sec . the next section is devoted to the concluding results . the xy spin model is written with the hamiltonian @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 is the sum over nearest neighbor vectors , @ xmath21 the unit planar basis vector of the @ xmath22 - th site , and @ xmath23 the vector associated with the @ xmath22 - th spin . here , we can represent the solid - state clock system ; therefore the system has discrete components , @ xmath24 with @ xmath25 . the coupling is given by @ xmath26 . for the villain lattice on the square lattice this can be achieved by using a combination of dc and af coupling . for the villain lattice on the other hand , @ xmath26 are simply chosen to have the af coupling , @ xmath27 , so that the system becomes fully frustrated . the hamiltonian ( [ x ] ) is invariant under the action of the zero spin , @ xmath8and the global configuration as @ xmath7 . the breaking of these bonds is known to have two types of configurations , which roughly correspond to magnetic order and chiral ##ity . the gs configuration is also known as @ xmath28 - 3 , where the two sites are in @ xmath28 , in order , which is shown in fig . [ gsconf ] . we divide the molecule into three different sublattices for each magnetic order . each site in a triangle belongs to one of the sublattices , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 . we assign the magnetic order parameter to @ xmath31 where @ xmath32 is the magnetization of sublattice @ xmath33 , and @ xmath34 is the number of spins ; @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 are the same parameters for the sublattices @ xmath37 and @ xmath30 . . spins are indicated by arrows . sites belonging to the same sublattice have the same orientation of spins . the @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 signs indicate the order of the two chiralities . the ground statehas 7 - fold symmetry . ] to discuss the local spin reflection @ xmath7 , we deal with the chirality . the local chirality on the \ triangle is defined as @ xmath40 } _ { = \ frac { { } { { \ sqrt 3 } \ theta _ { j , k \ in { \ triangle } } \ left ( \ theta _ k - \ theta _ j ) , \ ] ] where the @ xmath41 component of the vector chirality is zero . the numerical value in fig . ( [ chiral ] ) is chosen so that the value of the numerical value is 1 . in the gs configuration shown in fig . [ gsconf ] , the vector chirality takes a rotation pattern of the right - handed ( positive ) orientation and the left - handed ( negative ) orientation . then , the vector chirality @ xmath42 is the order parameter for the @ xmath7 symmetry phase transition . the gs configuration has @ xmath43 - fold degeneracy which is given by the local vector spin reflection of @ xmath44 with @ xmath45 - fold and without @ xmath7 , with@ xmath46 - fold . the existence of this degeneracy is considered as one of the necessary conditions for the calculation of energy distribution . we use the monte carlo method to calculate the total dos and to obtain the kinetic energy . first , we briefly describe the wang - landau algorithm @ xcite . this algorithm is similar to the multicanonical method ( entropic sampling ) of lee @ xcite , the broad spectrum method @ xcite and the narrow histogram method @ xcite ; the method is based on the assumption that performing a random walk in phase space with a rate proportional to the size of the dos , @ xmath47 , will result in a full change of energy distribution . the wang - landau algorithm uses a diffusion model to describe the behavior of the random walk in the next step of the process . since the dos is not known at the time , it is simply set @ xmath48 for all states @ xmath49 . the transition is from energy @ xmath50 to @ xmath51 [ @ xmath52 , \ { { trans } \ ] ] and the dos @ xmath53 is iteratively calculated from @ xmath54 each time the statenot visited . the scale of @ xmath55 is gradually reduced to unity by increasing the ` energy ' of the average state ; the value for a state @ xmath49 is always less than some value of the average histogram , say , 0 . 5 . we can use the broad ##ening relation for getting a refined dos . in using the broad histogram method , oliveira _ et al . _ @ xcite pays attention to the number of potential moves , or the average of the potential state change , @ xmath56 , for a given state @ xmath57 . the maximum number of moves is @ xmath58 for a given coin flip process of the ising model above . the energy dos is related to the number of potential moves as @ xmath59 where @ xmath60 is the microcanonical state with fixed @ xmath49 . this relation is shown to be true on general ##ization @ xcite , and we use it . ( [ bhr ] ) the broad histogram method . we measure the average of the potential moves , @ xmath61 , and use this information for getting a rough estimate of the energy dos . it is stressed @xcite that @ xmath56 is a physical quantity , which is the advantage of counting the number of potential moves . we should also note that the physical quantities relation does not depend on the particular dynamic model one adopts , and the microcanonical values of the potential moves can be calculated by a number of monte carlo methods . in order to reduce calculation time for larger system sizes , we divide dos into different energy ranges and perform independent runs for each different range of energy . the individual pieces of the dos are joined together and averaged to produce the mass average with the inverse relation @ xmath62 and the standard relation @ xmath63 using the same algorithm , we perform the measurements of the physical quantities @ xmath64 according to @ xmath65 monte carlo method . then , we perform two independent runs for each system size in order to compare the results and to evaluate statistical errors . then we present the model for the af ##fine - tuned dos based on the periodic lattice . we then treated the dos with the linear relation @ xmath66 = 12 , 36 , 48 , 60 , and 72 . we apply the periodic ##ity method . we normalize the dos , using the relation @ xmath67 , and thedegeneracy of the kinetic energy , @ xmath68 , is used in order to improve the accuracy of the calculation . in fig . [ ds48 ] , we use the different dos of different size @ xmath69 as an example . here , the mass is represented in units of @ xmath17 , and the kinetic energy is given by @ xmath70 . . the energy is represented in units of @ xmath17 . ] the energy - dependent data of the @ xmath71 is used to calculate the kinetic energy @ xmath72 , using fig . ( [ ave ] ) . we calculate the specific heat per spin using the formula @ xmath73 , \ ] ] where @ xmath74 is the boltzmann constant . = 1 , 36 , 50 , 60 , and 100 . ] we show the energy dependence of specific heat for different lattice sizes in fig . the divergent peak around @ xmath75 in units of @ xmath76 shows a positive sign of the onset of second - order phase transition . we also see a hump on the lower right side around @ xmath77 , which may be related to the transition ofphase transition . first , we should consider the magnetic and chiral orders for the detailed analysis of the phase transition . the critical dimension and the transition time can be investigated more precisely from the definition of the transition parameter or the phase correlation function . the magnetic and chirality correlation functions are defined as the following : @ xmath78 where @ xmath79 is the average distance between them . formally , the distance @ xmath79 is a constant , but we have used a different method . one of the original authors @ xcite showed that the evaluation of the correlation function with small distances is a useful tool for the analysis of the high - order phase transition as well as for the kt transition , and this correlation ratio can be used for the generalization of the probability - changing statistical model @ xcite . at the critical point , on the critical plane , the correlation function @ xmath80 for an infinite system varies as a function of @ xmath79 , @ xmath81 where @ xmath82 is the critical dimension and @ xmath83 the decay time . for a finite system in the critical plane , the correlation function depends on two length scales , @ xmat##h84 where @ xmath85 is the system length . finally , the sum of the correlation functions with fixed distances has a system - size , ( fss ) , with a single scale factor , @ xmath86 if we have two ratios , @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 . in the present example , we use @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 for the ratios . next , we evaluate the correlation ratios @ xmath91 and @ xmath92 , where @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 are referred to to eqs . ( [ magchi1 ] ) and ( [ magchi2 ] ) . it is possible for two magnetic spins to belong to the same sublattice ; since the fixed distances are referred to @ xmath89 and @ xmath95 , we define the system size as a multiple of @ xmath43 . we evaluate the correlation functions respectively for the ( a ) magnetic and ( b ) chiral spins in fig . [ corf ] . from the spin dependence of the magnetic correlation functions shown in fig . [ corf ] ( 2 ) , we observe that the spinof these sizes merge for the middle temperature range ( @ xmath96 ) , and spray together for the low - temperature and high - temperature ranges . this behavior is the same as that for the unfrustrated two - phase crystal model @ xcite , which suggests that there are two phase transitions of this type at @ xmath11 and @ xmath0 . the hump in the lower temperature plot of the specific heat , fig . [ spht ] , may correspond to the higher temperature phase transition at @ xmath11 . the lower temperature phase transition at @ xmath0 is not obvious from the specific heat , as it is dominated by the small fluctuations due to the chiral transition . we then make a fss analysis based on the kt form of the correlation length , @ xmath97 , where @ xmath98 . the @ xmath66 form of @ xmath99 is replaced by @ xmath100 using the data of the heat flux at @ xmath101 for different sizes , we estimate the kt transition times . we consider the temperature - dependent process that gives the value @ xmath102 . in fig . [ t##12 ] , we plot @ xmath99 as a combination of @ xmath103 with @ xmath104 for the best - known parameters in fig . ( [ t _ k ] ) . for model selection , we have chosen a quadratic expression of @ xmath103 to represent the parameters . the value of @ xmath102 has been set to be 0 . 85 , 0 . 88 and 0 . 95 for the determination of @ xmath0 , whereas @ xmath102 has been set to be 0 . 95 , 0 . 985 and 0 . 99 for @ xmath11 . the parameters with different @ xmath102 are represented at different points in fig . [ t12 ] , but they are based on a single point in this figure , which means that @ xmath105 depends on @ xmath102 using eq . ( [ t _ k ] ) and the dependence of @ xmath102 can be seen as the @ xmath102 dependence of @ xmath105 . we estimate the absolute temperatures of the magnetic poles using fig . ( [ t _ k ] ) and @ xmat##h106 where the numbers in the parentheses denote the results of the previous step . the estimate of @ xmath0 is slightly lower than the estimate of noh _ @ xcite , @ xmath107 . this is due to the fact that the same model is used in fig . @ xcite , and the estimate of the absolute value is higher because of large differences to fss @ xcite . and ( d ) @ xmath108 of the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice for @ xmath66 = 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , and 72 , where @ xmath109 . the data for @ xmath102 = 0 . 96 , 0 . 98 and 0 . 90 are shown as different numbers : ( a ) , and those for @ xmath102 = 0 . 96 , 0 . 985 and 0 . 999 ##5 ( b ) . , [ = " fig : " ] + and ( c ) @ xmath108 of the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice for @ xmath66 = 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , and 72 , where @ xmath109 . the data for @ xmath##102 = 0 . 87 , 0 . 88 and 0 . 90 are shown as the marks in ( a ) , and those for @ xmath102 = 0 . 96 , 0 . 985 and 0 . 98 in ( b ) . , title = " figure : " ] . we consider the slope of @ xmath83 . we then look at the corresponding distribution of correlation function @ xmath102 for different values and find the corresponding correlation function @ xmath110 . we give consideration to the power - law dependence of the correlation function on the sample size , @ xmath111 , which can be obtained from fig . ( [ corr _ 1 ] ) and @ xmath82 is shown to be large . we plot @ xmath110 versus @ xmath66 for the @ xmath102 values on logarithmic scale . fig . [ 2 ] . the slope of @ xmath83 is shown as the slope of the cross - fit function for the distribution of correlation ratio . the squared error estimates for the kt transition @ xcite are shown to be small compared to the errors . we plot @ xmath8##3 thus holds with respect to the thermal correlation coefficient @ xmath102 in fig . [ eta ] . in the s domain , @ xmath102 is directly proportional to the temperature . we should note that the expression @ xmath83 is valid only in the frequency range @ xmath112 in the experimental basis . we consider the values of @ xmath102 s which give @ xmath11 and @ xmath0 by inclusion in brackets . as can be seen , the decay of @ xmath83 behaves like a periodic phase function ; that is , the exponent @ xmath83 continuously changes with the change of the kt phase . since @ xmath83 is almost constant for smaller @ xmath102 in fig . [ eta ] , the exponent for the lower kt is @ xmath11 ##2 expressed as @ xmath113 for the @ xmath102 ( higher temperature ) side , @ xmath83 depends on @ xmath102 due to corrections in fig . [ eta ] . using the fact that the initial value of @ xmath105 in fig . ( [[ _ t ] ) based on the data from the transition temperature , that is , @ xmath114 , we estimate the value @ xmath83 at the same transition temperature @ xmath0 by mass . the values @ xmath83 and @ xmath105 are , for example , 0 . 310 and 0 . 76 for @ xmath115 , 0 . 298 and 1 . 05 for @ xmath116 , and 0 . 284 and 1 . 05 for @ xmath117 . taking the @ xmath83 s as a function of @ xmath118 , and extrapolating to @ xmath119 , we obtain @ xmath120 of course , other values such as @ xmath121 are possible ; but an error is shown in the figure . in fig . [ eta ] we find the value of @ xmath102 which follows @ xmath0 without the error . the @ xmath83 at this @ xmath102 is identical with the previous value , @ xmath122 . for the unfrustrated 24 - hour time model , the value##s @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 were predicted as 1 / 4 and 1 / 6 respectively @ xcite , and they were confirmed numerically @ xcite . the present results show that the exponents associated with the phase transition are universal even for the frustrated model , which the previous results @ xcite failed to show . versus @ xmath66 . [ the value of the best - fit straight line of each corresponding @ xmath102 is the value of exponent @ xmath83 . ] of the phase as a function of magnetic correlation ratio @ xmath102 . this is just guide to the results . ] the temperature plot of the chiral correlation ratio was also plotted in fig . [ corf ] ( 2 ) . the existence of chiral phase transition can be clearly observed . in the plot , there is a central critical point which indicates the second - order phase transition ; this corresponds to the central point in the original heat equation . by using the fss model of chirality correlation ratio , as shown in fig . [ nu1 ] , we can find the temperature value and the @ xmath125 of chiral ##ity . the value of @ xmat##h126 our result for that the chiral ##ity occurs at temperatures higher than @ xmath0 of the transition is consistent with previous studies in favor of the transition scenario . quite recently , korshunov @ xcite has discussed that the phase transition associated with the formation of vortex pairs takes place at a higher temperature than the initial phase transition associated with proliferation of the ising - type vortex pairs . our result for the estimated @ xmath125 is consistent with the results by lee and lee @ xcite and by ozeki and ito @ xcite , but not with the results by olsson @ xcite ; that is , the observed phenomena are not predicted by the ising - class . we have also observed an observed temperature increase of the estimated @ xmath125 up to our estimated system size , @ xmath127 . olsson @ xcite showed that corrections to the scaling are important in the highly stable xy model , and the data are consistent with @ xmath128 . et al . _ also postulated that only for small enough system the ising - type behavior is observed . however , a nonequilibrium relaxation study for large enough system up to @xmath129 , ozeki and ito @ xcite ##s observed the @ xmath130 , which suggests that the corrections to fss are not very serious . however , more detailed calculations will be needed for the observed phenomena of chiral transition . . in addition , we have investigated the af six - state clock model of the triangular system using the wang - wang method combined with the broad histogram method . the model is closely related to the 2d - state clock model . we have observed that the system possesses two orders , spin ordering and chiral ordering . the former undergoes the phase transition and the latter undergoes the second - order transition . we have also observed the lower order kt transition due to the discrete nature of the triangular system . our estimates of the higher kt temperature @ xmath0 and the lower temperature of chiral ordering @ xmath1 , that is , @ xmath2 and @ xmath3 , suggest the same resonance scenario . the lower transition temperature is estimated as @ xmath4 . the decay exponents of the transition are estimated as @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 , which suggests that the exponents associated with the two states are equaland for the general one . for the general case of the chiral model , our estimate of the parameter @ xmath125 , that is , @ xmath131 , suggests that the model does indeed belong to the ising theory family , but more detailed analysis is still required . the authors wish to thank t . kawashima , t . otsuka , t . yamaguchi , t . suzuki , and t . ozeki for their contributions . each of the author ( s ) gratefully acknowledges the support provided by the ministry of education , sports , sports and culture , japan . this fellowship is supported by a grant - in - aid for the research from the japan society for the advancement of science . the majority of this work has been conducted using the facilities of tokyo imperial university and those of the research institute , institute for solid state physics , university of tokyo . j . teitel and c . jayaprakash , phys . b * 27 * , 598 ( 1983 ) . e . granato , j . p . kosterlitz , j . smith and j . p . smith , phys . lett . * 27 * , 1090 ( 1991 ) . m . ramirez - santiago and m. j . jose , phys . b * 49 * , 9567 ( 1994 ) . j . lee and j - h . lee , phys . b * 49 * , 15184 ( 1994 ) . m . olsson , phys . lett . * 77 * , 2758 ( 1995 ) ;
