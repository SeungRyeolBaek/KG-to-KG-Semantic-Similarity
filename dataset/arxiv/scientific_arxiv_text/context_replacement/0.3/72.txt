there is strong observational evidence that a significant fraction of massive , spheroidal star systems is still in existence at present @ xmath4 . however , only a small percentage of these systems is fully formed @ xcite . the galaxies are smaller by a factor of three to five compared to present - day ellipticals of similar size . their effective stellar mass densities are at least one order of magnitude higher @ xcite with significantly higher surface temperatures compared to their low redshift analogs . these results are difficult to reconcile with some other star formation scenarios for elliptical galaxies . a simple conclusion from the data is that most early - type galaxies can neither have fully formed by a simple monolithic collapse nor a binary merger of gas - rich disks at high temperatures , unless their increase in size can be explained by secular processes such as adiabatic expansion driven by stellar winds , and / or positive feedback @ xcite . additionally , the passive evolution of the stellar disks is in contradiction with that of local ellipticals @ xcite . + dwarf ( i . e . gas - poor , collisionless ) mergers and stellar extinction events are the prime candidates for the strong active and passive evolution of the spheroids . @ xmath5@ xcite . the mere presence of a dissipative component in a major merger process would explain the size increase ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . the observed ellipticals are not very large at 0 z , thus we know from the shape of the mass function that minor mergers should be much more common than major mergers until z = 0 . major early - type galaxies can undergo much more than one major merger ( with typically a cool gas phase , see also @ xcite ) since @ xmath6 ( @ xcite , see also @ xcite ) with a small contribution from minor mergers for the mass of @ xcite . the low number of observed major early - type galaxies is best explained by theoretical evidence that minor ( @ xmath7 ) galaxies at @ xmath8 typically experience only one major merger or two until @ xmath9 and minor mergers are much more common @ xcite . on average , this is not enough to account for the required mass and size increase ( see also @ xcite ) . large major mergers at most increase the size of a simple - component galaxy by a factor of two and allowing for dark matter emission reduces the size even at @ xcite . with this letter weuse , as a matter of principle , a very high resolution cosmological simulation of the dynamics of a galaxy with no major mergers below @ xmath10 in accordance with the above equations to show that the extremely rapid star formation and density evolution of elliptical galaxies can be explained by minor mergers and small collision events . the problem is computationally very complex . at high resolution the observed ellipticals have low - mass sizes of @ xmath11 with inner disks of even greater size . as we see from the above simulations ( see e . g . @ xcite ) , to model such a system reasonably , we need a gravitational constant of 10 % of the effective radius , which in our case is of the order of @ xmath12 and we need the sizes of @ xmath13 to resolve the galaxy in a different cosmological context over the hubble model . finally , to accurately model the galaxy high resolution and integration accuracy are required . using the virial model we make a simple estimate of how an initial one - component stellar systems behave when mass in stellar systems is added . we assume that a compact initial stellar system is formed dissipatively from mass . this systemassume a total energy @ xmath14 , a mass @ xmath15 , a gravitational radius @ xmath16 , and the mean square speed of the stars is @ xmath17 . according to the virial equation @ xcite the total energy of the system is @ xmath18 we can assume that stars are accreted with energies totaling @ xmath19 , masses totaling @ xmath20 , gravitational radius @ xmath21 and mean square speeds totaling @ xmath22 . we take the fractional energy calculated from measuring the final material @ xmath23 and the total total energy of the material as @ xmath24 , further defining @ xmath25 . for energy conservation ( the parameters from computer simulations show that most stars are on parabolic orbits ) , the total energy of the final system is @ xmath26 the mass of the final system is @ xmath27 . then the ratio of the final to initial mean square speeds is @ xmath28 similarly , the ratio of the final to initial gravitational radius is @ xmath29 and for the ratio of the densities we have @ xmath30 if during one or more mergers thea massive system increases its mass by a factor of two with @ xmath31 . this mass increase can be caused by an intermediate - mass system in which all the mean square velocities of the two systems are identical and remain constant in the final system ( eqn . [ disp ] ) . the radius increases by a factor of two ( eqn . [ rr ] ) and the density decreases by a factor of three ( eqn . [ rr ] ) ( see also @ xcite ) . if , however , the initial mass increase by a factor of two is caused by systems of very low mass with @ xmath32 or @ xmath33 , then the mean square values are increased by a factor of , the radius is three times , and the density is reduced by a factor of 32 with respect to the final system ( see also @ xcite for a similar derivation of the scaling factor ) . we know from the shape of the schechter function for the distribution of stellar masses that a massive system ( @ xmath34 ) gets most of its mass from low mass , and thus the simple formula above makes it very plausible that even though stellar masses can cause thethey are the main driver for the change in size and shape of massive galaxies . ) the halo formed by the formation of in - situ stars , at high resolution ( @ xmath35 ) accretion is more dominant . , [ = 302 ] we have performed a successful gravitational - wave / sph high - resolution re - run of the active galaxy a . the process of setting up the initial conditions is described in detail in @ xcite and is being reviewed . we have re - run galaxy a at @ xmath36 high resolution using the wmap - based @ xcite cosmology with a model parameter of @ xmath37 ( @ xmath38 = , @ xmath39 , @ xmath40mpc @ xmath40 ) with @ xmath41 = 0 . 1 , @ xmath42 = 0 . 5 , @ xmath43 = 0 . 3 , and @ xmath44 = 0 . 5 . to re - run the target galaxy at high resolution we set the particle size to @ xmath45 , and dark matter particles within a small volume at the @ xmath46 containing the particles that end up in thevirialized region ( we assumed a fixed resolution of @ xmath47 ) of the galaxy was @ xmath9 . the gravitational forces from particles within the increasing resolution cube were replaced by increasingly massive dark matter particles in 5 boundary layers of decreasing resolution . the galaxy was also affected by massive boundary layers . the virial ##ization . is indicated by the dashed black lines . the gray area is the gravitational softening region . , width = 302 ] the simulation was performed with linux - based @ xcite and woodhen at the chicago picscie hpc , using a total of 177 , 000 # ##s on 64 computers . we assumed a constant comoving radius until @ xmath48 , and thereafter the softening , e . g . for the galaxy , remained fixed at physical @ xmath49 . the mass of each individual star particle was @ xmath50 and we assumed two stars per sph particle . star formation and feedback from stars was modeled using the sub - scale multiphase model of @ xcite . we used the mass - density model of @ xmath51 for the onset of star formation to avoid spurious star formation at high redshift . the critical number density for star formation was@ xmath52 and the halo formation time - scale is @ xmath53 . we also have an uniform cosmic background radiation field interacting strongly at @ xmath54 ( see @ xcite ) . at present the galaxy has a central virial mass of @ xmath55 and a central stellar mass of @ xmath0 . the ratio of central stellar mass to stellar mass is about a factor of two larger than predicted from gravitational lensing in @ xcite , however , it is similar to some other predictions made for the milky way galaxy ( e . g . @ xcite , see however @ xcite ) . the central stellar component resembles an elliptical galaxy with properties very similar to the results presented in @ xcite and in this letter we will focus on particular ##s of the assembly and the evolution of the central component . ( black hole ) . from @ xmath56 to @ xmath9 the size increases by a factor of @ xmath57 . we also have the evolution of the r - group x - band ( golden triangle ) and v - band ( golden triangle ) half - light radius . these include several merger events , e . g . the most massive ( 1 : 1 ) merger since z = 3 .z = 5 . 3 . , width = 302 ] during the formation of the central galaxy we have divided the stars at a minimum radius of @ xmath58 in their chemical composition into stars that have formed in - situ from gas in the galaxy and stars that have formed outside this radius and have accreted head - on . the mass evolution history of the in - situ and gas flows of the stellar system are shown in fig . the early mass evolution of @ xmath59 is characterized by the assembly of in - situ stars with a large contribution towards @ xmath60 . below this point , gas stars have formed in @ xmath58 . the final 10 % of stars are formed thereafter by assembly of systems formed outside the main stellar system at radii larger than @ xmath58 . the first panel of fig . [ the _ stellar _ systems _ feed _ the _ galaxy ] shows the mass profiles of the in - situ stars formed around z = 5 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 1 . between z = 5 and z = 6 the central galaxy is still building stars from gas , feeding the central galaxy of the galaxy directly , forming a new stellar system . the in -situ central stellar components increase by more than an order of magnitude towards higher distances . the spherical half - mass radii of the in - situ central component , suggest that the in - situ component is more massive ( see also @ xcite ) than @ xmath10 @ xmath61 and its size decreases by about a factor of two ( @ xmath62 ) until n = 1 . in the second part of fig . [ rho _ ins _ acc _ feed _ out _ 1 ] we show the density profiles for the stars that have formed at @ xmath58 and have been accreted later - on . this component is more massive at lower distances and has a shallower density profile . the central density is roughly constant towards @ xmath63 and the density at larger distances also increases towards @ xmath9 . the half - mass radius of this component is significantly larger than for the in - situ component ( @ xmath64 ) . the central component of the galaxy is always dominated by in - situ stars whereas at redshifts of @ xmath65 and at radii larger than @ xmath66 the core is dominated by accret##ed stars . ( black dots ) and @ xmath9 ( red dots ) . the black and red dots are the best fitting sersic profile . at high distances the galaxy has a higher central surface brightness and is more compact . , width = 302 ] in fig . [ re ] we show the time evolution of the edge - on and half mass distribution of stars in the host galaxy within the theoretical model @ xmath58 as a function of time . in @ xmath10 the stellar system resembles a compact disk - like or disk - like galaxy with a peak ellipticity of @ xmath67 and a size of @ xmath68 at z = 3 . thereafter the size increases by a factor of @ xmath69 to its maximum size of @ xmath70 . we also model the observed half - mass radii of the rest frame k - and v - bands using the stellar population distribution of @ xcite assuming solar metalicity . in general the half - mass radii match the half - light radius even at great distances reasonably well . the k - band rest - frame surface brightness ##es for edge - on projections at z = 2 and z = 3 are shown .fig . [ kmag _ all ] in accordance with the above fitting sersic index . repeat the fitting procedure of @ xcite excluding the central three arc lengths . at high redshift the system is more compact , @ xmath71 , and has a moderate sersic index of @ xmath72 . this is in accordance with the system being flattened and star - like . at low redshift the system is less compact @ xmath73 , and the sersic index has increased to @ xmath74 . the galaxy is slightly more compact than most sdss early - type galaxies at this mass and lies outside the observed region ( @ xcite , see also @ xcite ) . the values shown in the figure are typical errors for a radial projection . as we have shown before the change in surface brightness is primarily caused by the evolution in surface temperature and not the radial evolution . at z = 0 the system has a maximum effective mass of @ xmath75 with an effective mass @ xmath76 and a corresponding effective radius of @ xmath77 . the maximum radial line - of - sight velocity dispersion is @ xmath78 . the corresponding values at z = 0hence @ xmath79 , @ xmath80 , @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 , which is a typical value for early - type galaxies at this mass @ xcite . from z = 0 to z = 3 the system revolves around @ xmath83 ( see also [ new ] ) and we can opt for the simple scaling relation @ xmath84 and @ xmath33 ( which is a good assumption as most mass is conserved in such small systems and we found the most likely merger since z = 3 with a mass ratio of 1 : 1 ) . the z = 0 values of the simulated galaxy are close to the simple values , however , the size increase as well as the decrease in mass and dispersion are more significant . this is however unlikely as the real evolution of the system is more complicated and there is non - negligible in - situ star formation between z = 0 and z = 1 . still , the simple scaling relations for the accretion predict the evolution of the system from z = 3 to z = 0 as well . however , observations of more massive ellipticals than the one shown here indicate an even greater mass increase @ xcite .this behavior can be observed if the assembly of these massive stars is much more dominated by minor mergers and stellar formation . in particular , the increase in velocity distribution is in quantitative agreement with the direct observations by @ xcite . however , @ xcite has reported a very weak evolution of the density within a 1kpc of only a factor 1 - 3 . this data is in qualitative agreement with our data which show a change of only a factor 0 . 5 from z = 2 to z = 0 . we also note that the stellar population of the galaxy has strongly evolved at high temperatures . in @ xmath8 the galaxy has a stellar mass of @ xmath85 and a local star formation rate of only @ xmath86 and an average stellar age of @ xmath87 . in this paper we show that the local size and density evolution of the spheroids agrees with what is to be expected from a high resolution computer simulation of a galaxy which grows at all times predominantly by minor mergers and formation of stars . we can successfully use simple linear equations derived from the virial theorem to demonstrate that that the size increase and decrease in density and velocity dispersion is a natural consequence ofmass assembly by much less massive stellar systems and accretion @ xcite and could also be explained by mass assembly histories dominated by large stellar mergers . in the simulation , a short phase @ xmath88 dominated by in - situ star formation from the surrounding stars ( see e . g . @ xcite and discussed therein ) produces a large and dense star system with sizes @ xmath89 . this phase of the formation of the cores of ellipticals is followed by an extended phase @ xmath90 with little in - situ star formation but significant accretion of new material . this material can be stripped to larger radii and increases the size of the system with time . at the same time the central concentration is increased by the material from the surviving stars ( see @ xcite ) . the resulting density increase is explained by the gravitational dominance of the in - situ component being heated and , at larger radii , ejected ultimately by the surrounding stars . from z = 1 to z = 10 the effective radius of the star increases by a factor of 1 . 5 with a decrease in the stellar density of more than an order of magnitude and a decrease in velocity increase of 10 % , in good agreement with thefrom the scaling relations for the accretion of minor mergers . recent results of dark matter simulations ( see e . g . @ xcite ) as well as recent studies ( see e . g . @ xcite ) of the mass assembly processes of early - type galaxies and their dark matter halos show the significance of minor mergers . in addition , due to the shape of the mass function , massive systems at high redshift are more likely to undergo minor mergers , than lower mass galaxies . if the size increase is in general driven by minor mergers we would expect a large mass increase , e . g . , if high redshift systems are larger than lower mass systems . at the same time minor mergers may also play an important role for the gravitational heating of the gas , thus suppressing the formation of new stars @ xcite . a picture of a two phase merger model for large elliptical galaxies has a number of virtues . in the first dissipative phase at high mass stars form clusters and build the galactic progenitor of present - day ellipticals . in fact , it is of minor importance if the gas is transported to the center through processes of mergers of other gas dominated galaxies ( see e . g . @ xcite ) .long as it is on a short timescale . the stars formed at this initial phase are expected to be highly enriched in alpha - elements as seen from both @ xcite and from the inner core of the host galaxy . later on metal - poor stars from small galaxies are formed and form the halo of the galaxy resulting from the observed metalicity increase . this inside out formation process is also made possible by recent observations of @ xcite . there is an interesting interpretation of the hypothesis presented in this paper . if so , then the outer parts of massive galactic ellipticals would tend to be red , blue , metal - poor and not uniform from galaxy to galaxy since they are all composed mainly of the debris from tidally destroyed giant star systems . the research was performed at the la picscie hpc observatory . this research is supported by the dfg center of active galaxies and regions of the universe . we thank marijn franx , pieter van dokkum and ignacio trujillo for their comments on the paper . , e . f . , naab , t . , brown , d . j . , somerville , r . s . , brown , j . r . m . , barden , m . , brown , c . ,rix , j . -
