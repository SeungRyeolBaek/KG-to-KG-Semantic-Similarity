the effects of temperature and angular momentum on pairing properties is an interesting subject in the field of theoretical physics . because of its simplicity , the bcs theory is widely used , which offers a good example of pairing properties in the macroscopic systems such as crystalline superconductors . it predicts the collapse of the pairing gap in @ xmath0 , which causes the sharp superfluid - liquid ( sl ) phase transition at finite temperature . the bcs theory , however , ignores quantal and thermal fluctuations , which are significant in finite temperature systems . therefore , it needs to be modified for the application to finite nuclei . various theoretical approaches have been proposed to study the effects of fluctuations in pairing properties @ xcite . their results show that , at zero angular momentum , thermal fluctuations cancel out the sharp sn phase transition , resulting in a pairing gap , which does not collapse at finite temperature . in rotating systems , a phenomenon of heat - pair splitting , which reflects the strong fluctuations of the coupling constant in small systems , has also been observed @ xcite . the latest theoretical approach , called the dynamic bcs ( mbcs ) theory @ xcite has shown , for the first time , that the heat source causing the self - consistent pairing gap is the quasipar##ticle - spin coupling ( qnf ) . recently , we published the self - interacting - random - phase approximation ( scqrpa ) @ xcite , which includes the qnf as well as the quantal corrections due to the coupling to pair interactions . the purpose of this work is to extend this model to finite energy and finite angular momentum . the pairing hamiltonian is : , which describes a pair of @ xmath1 particles interacting via a mutual interaction with the momentum @ xmath2 and energy with the velocity @ xmath3 and a corresponding angular momentum vector @ xmath4 on the particle ( or particle ) . @ xmath5 is : @ xmath6 where @ xmath7 ( @ xmath8 ) is the force that creates ( creates ) the particle with angular momentum @ xmath9 , spin energy @ xmath10 , @ xmath11 , and energy @ xmath12 . for simplicity , the operators @ xmath9 denote the single - particle states @ xmath13 with @ xmath14 0 , whereas @ xmath15 denote the time - reversal operator @ xmath16 .the particle pairing operator @ xmath17 is defined as @ xmath18 , whereas @ xmath19 is the @ xmath20 - component of total angular momentum . the variational principle is used to determine the expectation value of this hamiltonian in the grand canonical ensemble . the method yields the expectation values for the pairing operator , particle energy and total angular momentum , which include the value of qnf in the ensemble @ xmath21 @ xmath22 ~ , \ hspace { 5 ##n } ] = \ sum _ { m _ n ( m _ k ^ { + } - n _ k ^ { - } ) ~ , \ hat { 0 } \ ] ] where the quasiparticle energy @ xmath23 and renormalized quasi - particle energy @ xmath24 are given as @ xmath25 @ xmath26 with @ xmath27 , and @ xmath28 . the expectation values @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 are obtained by solving a set of differential equations , which include the scqrpa @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 respectively . the qnf is given as @ xmath33 , where the sum##particle occupation operators @ xmath34 are obtained from the state equation @ xmath35 ^ { 2 } + [ \ gamma _ { n } ^ { \ omega } ( \ omega ) ] ^ 2 } d \ omega ~ , \ { { nkcoupling } \ ] ] with the occupation operator @ xmath36 $ by combining the set of equations for discrete - time linear ' s operators and those of a system interacting with scqrpa . ##wise . the energy dampings are given as @ xmath37 $ ] . the proposed approach is called the ftbcs1 + scqrpa theory . with the coupling to scqrpa , i . e . the interactions @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 , it is the ftbcs1 theory , which is different from the proposed ftbcs ##1 with the addition of the qnf . the effect of particle number at the angular level is then obtained by using the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method . the proposed approaches are called the ftln1 + scqrpa and ftln1 . the numerical calculations are carried out with the @ xmath38 .##ubly - based model with the number @ xmath38 of nuclei equal to that of particles , @ xmath1 , as well as for @ xmath39o , @ xmath40ca , @ xmath41fe , and @ xmath42sn . the results obtained show that , for zero angular momentum , and the effect of qnf on the ftbcs1 ( ftln1 ) , the predicted sn phase transition predicted by the ftbcs ##1 is cancelled out . as the result , the band gap does not end at @ xmath43 , but has a tail , which leads to high @ xmath44 . the dynamic approach to the scqrpa model significantly improved the agreement with the experimental results for the binding energy and binding capacity obtained for @ xmath45 as well as those obtained @ xmath41fe using the two - dimensional quantum monte carlo method @ xcite [ cf . [ fig ] ( b ) [ fig ] ( c ) ] . however , for large molecules such as @ xmath42sn , the scqrpa effects were found to be weak in comparison with the ftbcs1 (ftln1 ) ] . for @ xmath39o and @ xmath40ca , the ftbcs1 pairing correlation , obtained at different @ xmath4 , decreases as @ xmath44 , and do not collapse at high @ xmath44 . for @ xmath4 greater than the maximum at @ xmath46 , where the ftbcs gap for @ xmath47 disappears , there are two stable pairing ##s , of which the ftbcs1 gap collapses at a high @ xmath48 , and remains finite at @ xmath49 [ cf . [ fig ] ( 2 ) ] . this phenomenon is mediated by the qnf of the ftbcs1 gap . at @ xmath47 , the qnf is finite , and the ftbcs and ftbcs1 gaps are the same as those of @ xmath4 ( or @ xmath3 ) , and both collapse at @ xmath50 . however , with increasing @ xmath44 , the ftbcs1 gaps , which are obtained at different @ xmath44 , collapse at @ xmath51 , and remain finite even at a high @ xmat##h44 , whereas those used in the original ftbcs , are ##es @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 [ fig .
