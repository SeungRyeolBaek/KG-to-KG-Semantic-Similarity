it is well known that the classical magnetoresistance ( mr ) in metals or alloys with a closed - electron metal surface increases quadratically with the magnetic field @ xmath2 for @ xmath3 and decreases when @ xmath4 . here @ xmath5 is the zero - magnetic - field limit . hence , the unexpected high and low law ( lmr ) , which describes this familiar rule , has been given much attention as far as its application . in the past decade , this unexpected lmr has been observed in copper chalcogenide , @ xcite copper antimonide , @ xcite silicon , @ xcite mnas - gaas composite ##s , @ xcite and graphene . @ xcite kapitza the high law @ xcite indicates that the metal has a magnetoresistance linear in the magnetic field when it has an open fermi surface and a mean free path longer than the open larmor surface . recently , another two models , irrespective of the open electron surface , have been proposed to explore possible mechanisms for the lmr phenomenon . abrikosov proposed a lower - limit origin of lmr for the homogen##ous system with a gapless linear energy gap . @ xcite his model requires that landau levels are well formed and the electron density so small that all electrons occupy only the one energy band . however , parish and littlewood developed a similar model without involving linear spectrum . @ xcite ignoring the concrete microscopic situation , they attributed this unusual mr to the mobility effects of a highly inhomogenous system . topological materials @ xcite ( 2013 ) are topological materials with a full energy gap in bulk , while there are gapless surface states . due to its unique band structure with only a single dirac cone and linear energy dispersion , @ xcite the surface states of the ti bi @ xmath0se @ xmath1 provide an excellent model for the behavior of quantum - limit lmr . the first experiment in this flat topological system , however , showed that the large scale mr , which becomes very linear in the magnetic field of @ xmath6 @ xmath7 @ xmath8 t , is observed even in an extreme situation where the photon number density is high that electrons occupy more than one landau levels . @ xcite also , they showed that room temperature to room temperature almost has no effect on the observed mr##r . it is clear that this observation is in conflict with abrikosov s model and not with the standard hardy - littlewood model . so far a complete theoretical model capable of explaining this particular experiment has still been lacking . in this paper , we apply the balance - theory of @ xcite to a system of the surface states of a two - dimensional surface to study the two - dimensional magnetotransport of ti . we find that a positive , nonsaturating and dominantly linear magnetoresistance can appear in quite narrow magnetic - field range in the ti surface state with a positive and negative local g - factor . this linear magnetoresistance shows up in the system of high carrier density and low temperature when electrons are in many states and are over many different energy levels , and persists up to room temperature , providing a possible mechanism for the recently observed linear magnetoresistance in topological surfaces ##s @ xmath0se @ xmath1 nanoribbons . @ xcite we study the surface states of a bi @ xmath0se @ xmath1 - a large bulk of ti in the @ xmath9 - @ xmath10 - under the influence of a uniform magnetic field @ xmat##h11 , on the @ xmath12 axis . @ xcite in the above example , @ xcite we assume that the binding energy is in the bottom of the bulk band and at the critical point , i . e . the neutral atoms and electrons . however , the separations of the fermi energy from the bottom of bulk band and dirac point are much larger than the critical value ( @ xmath13 ) used in this work . also , the contribution from the bulk band to the magnetotransport is large . these electrons , surrounded by randomly distributed electrons and free phonons , are driven by a strong in - plane electric field @ xmath14 on the magnetic axis . the hamiltonian of this electron - electron and phonon system consists of an electron part @ xmath15 , a phonon part @ xmath16 , and electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 : @ xmath19 here , the full hamiltonian is given in the form @ xmath20 , \ ] ] in which @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 , @ xmath23 and @ xmat##h24 , 26 , respectively , for the relative position , position , momentum and energy operators of the @ xmath25th state . coordinates @ xmath26 , @ xmath27 is the vector potential of the external magnetic field @ xmath28 in the standard approach , @ xmath29 is the electron surface , @ xmath30 is the total g - vector of the free electron , and @ xmath31 is the bohr radius with @ xmath32 the total electron mass . the mass index @ xmath25 in eq .

trivial part @ xmath54 of the hamiltonian , and. . . the c . m . coordinate and the free motion of ti are truly different from each other . the interactions between the two emerge only through the electron impurity and electron phonon interactions . therefore , the magnetic field @ xmath55 shows up only in @ xmath38 . and , in terms of @ xmath56 = { \ rm i } \ delta _ { \ alpha \ beta } ( \ delta _ { ij } -

branch levels and the range of ` ` @ xmath100 ' ' - branch levels are completely filled , that they are open to electron occupation . special attention has to be paid to the @ xmath104 case , since , depending on the direction of doping , the effective g - factor of a given excited state , @ xmath30 , can be positive , negative or negative . @ xcite the direction and magnitude of the effective g - factor determines how the states of the zero level should be included in or excluded from the possible potential for electron occupation in the case of @ xmath120 - doping with a zero field . ( i ) if @ xmath131 , the @ x##math104 level center is called the @ xmath132 and the center is black - hole symmetric . the total number of negative energy states ( including the states of the lower half of the @ xmath104 level and states of the @ xmath100 " - branch levels ) and that of positive energy states ( including the states of the upper half of the @ xmath104 level and states of the @ xmath99 " - branch levels ) do not change when in magnetic field . however , the lower - half negative energy states of this level are not occupied and the upper - half positive - energy states of them are used for the generation of particles which are used as particles when in transport in the form of @ xmath120 - doping . ( 2 ) for a very large @ xmath133 , the @ xmath104 level @ xmath134 moves downward to lower energy and the distance to the nearest @ xmath100 " - branch level is @ xmath135 rather than to the nearest + " - branch level . finite magnetic field is @ xmath2 . this is equivalent to the opening of an infinitely enlarged ( with ) @ xmath2) energy gap between the + " - branch states and the states of the zero - level and the @ xmath100 " - branch states . the existence of a large energy gap means that with increasing magnetic field the states of the + " - branch states would no longer shrink into the zero - level , and thus the @ xmath104 level should be completely removed from the energy band , i . e . , particles occupying the + " - branch states are considered as electrons participating in transport in the states of @ xmath120 - doping , when the magnetic field @ xmath2 gets larger than a certain value ( depending on the value of @ xmath30 ) .

[ the measured sheet density @ xmath169 and the lattice temperature @ xmath183 . , scaledwidth = 47 . 0 % ] in the following we will give a detailed examination of the rapidly increasing magnetoresistance in the mobility @ xmath30 case . fig . [ rhob ] shows the calculated mobility @ xmath157 versus the magnetic field strength @ xmath2 and lattice temperature @ xmath183 for system of the sheet density @ xmath169 and @ xmath173 , and the zero - field strengths @ xmath184 and @ xmath180 . all the curves for mobility @ xmath185 show a variation in the magnetic - field strength and are a matter of approximation at the magnetic field shown in the figure . however , for the mobility @ xmath170 , the observed behavior , as compared to the zero field of @ xmath186 , as shown in the figure of fig . [ rhob ]( 2007 ) . this result is the theoretical mr which saturates with a large magnetic field @ xmath187 . note that here we only present the calculated @ xmath157 for a value @ xmath2 larger than @ xmath188 . , for which a sufficient energy of @ xmath135 is assumed to open that with the increase of the magnetic field the electrons in the ` ` + ' ' - state can no longer shrink into the zero level and so they should be isolated from the conduction electrons . this is of course not true for a weak magnetic field . when @ xmath189 the energy reaches @ xmath190 , the situation is similar to the case of @ xmath131 : the entire upper half of the zero - level states are available to charge carriers and we should have a flat changing @ xmath157 when the magnetic field . with increasing @ xmath2 the half of the zero - level states available to conduction electrons increase until the magnetic field reaches @ xmath191 . as a result the resistivity @ xmath157 should have a crossover from a flat changing at increasing @ xmath2 to positively changingincreasing to @ xmath192 . this is just the phenomenon observed in the ti model @ xmath0se @ xmath1 . @ xcite shows that in the case of @ xmath170 , the two landau - level widths are always smaller than the neighboring level interval : @ xmath193 , which [ @ xmath194 ^ \ $ ] , holds for the same landau value @ xmath195 , i . e . the resulting landau - level spectrum is different . with increasing the magnetic - field , the magnitude of resistivity @ xmath157 decreases , and when the broadened landau - level width is larger than the neighboring level interval , @ xmath196 , a local sdh will begin to form around the linearly - dependent peak value of @ xmath157 for higher values of the magnetic field strength , as shown in cf . [ rhob ] ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) for @ xmath197 and @ xmath198 . on the other hand , in the case of high frequencies , e . g . @ xmath199 , where the two landau - level width@ xmath200 are much smaller than the landau level interval even for the index @ xmath120 as large as @ xmath201 , the magnetoresistivity shows the sdh oscillation and the integer - independent behavior of , with the appearance of quantum hall effect , @ xcite is shown in fig . [ rhob ] ( f ) . abrikosov field model for the lmr has the quantum magnetic field large enough to reach the quantum limit at which all the carriers are within the lowest landau level , @ xcite while it is possible that more than one landau level is present in the experimental data in the model , at which the stable and non - stable magnetoresistivity is observed . @ xcite for the total magnetic surface density @ xmath202 , the number of occupied landau levels , or the filling of @ xmath172 , in different magnetic fields is shown in fig . [ rhob ] ( f ) , as well as in the fig .

[ diffg ] b . the observed sdh measurements in the experiment @ xmath0se @ xmath1 nanoribbon exhibiting nonsaturating surface lmr in the experiment @ xcite favor the following properties : a finite magnetic current @ xmath133 . is defined as a function of the critical magnetic mobility @ xmath33 . zero mobility @ xmath204 : ( a ) at different values of zero - field mobility @ xmath5 , and ( b ) at different values of zero - field conductivity @ xmath205 . , scaledwidth = 40 . 0 % ] at different critical temperatures . here the zero - mean - field mobility at critical temperature is @ xmath206 . , scaledwidth = 40 . 0 %] here , we show the density - dependence of the linear magnetoresistivity . to contrast with abrikosov and quantum magnetoresistance which suggests the @ xmath207 behavior , @ xcite we show the mobility @ xmath208 for the lmr versus the carrier sheet of @ xmath33 in t . [ rhon ] for the magnetic field @ xmath209 ##m . the mobility is chosen respectively to be @ xmath210 and @ xmath211m @ xmath212 / t to make the gap in the lmr smaller . a strong density dependence of @ xmath213 on the surface density @ xmath33 is observed in both cases , indicating that this non - linear surface density is almost inversely proportional to the surface density . in the figure we also show @ xmath208 versus @ xmath33 under the conditions of different given conductivity @ xmath214 and @ xmath215 . in this case the half - life @ xmath216 is independent of surface density . the density dependence still remains , indicating that this mobility behavior is very similar to the mobility @ xmath##33 - dependence of landau level broadening @ xmath216 as long as the system is in the overlapped landau level state . from the above discussion , it is obvious that lmr shows up in the system having two landau levels and the difference of landau levels makes the mr deviation from the equilibrium increase . at high temperature , the increased energy would increase the landau separation and phonon scattering further broaden landau levels . therefore , it is expected that this lmr will be robust against raising temperature . this is indeed the case as seen in fig . [ rhot ] , where we compare the local magnetoresistivity @ xmath157 for the above example with high - energy linear mobility @ xmath217m @ xmath212 / 3 versus the magnetic field at different spatial frequencies . we can see that raising temperature to higher temperature has no effect on the linearity of motion . due to the increased energy at higher temperature from phonon scattering , the local sdh oscillation in the linear mobility tends to vanish . these features are in good agreement with the above report . @ xcite in summary , we have observed the two - dimensional magnetotransport on the inner surface of a three - dimensionalti , which arises from the excited state with a wavevector - like energy dispersion and a finite , discrete zeeman energy within the same energy gap . when the energy separation is equal to or greater than the landau - level , and the conduction electrons move through the landau levels , a positive , dominantly linear and non - uniform magnetoresistance appears within a very narrow range of magnetic field and persists up to room temperature . this remarkable lmr provides a possible explanation for the first observed linear magnetoresistance in topological insulator ##s @ xmath0se @ xmath1 nanoribbons . @ xcite in contrast to the hall effect which appears in the case of well formed landau levels and to abrikosov ##ian quantum magnetotransport , @ xcite which is restricted to the extreme upper limit that all electrons coalesce into the same landau level , the discussed lmr is a phenomena of pure , two - dimensional magnetotransport in a system having zero - energy - gap , and in the case of all landau levels , irrespective of electrons showing up in the high magnetic field strength . therefore , the present scheme deals with the uniform case without anythe process results in a completely inhomogeneous state , which is required in the classical parish and littlewood model to form a lmr . @ xcite the appearance of this significant positive - increasing effective magnetoresistance depends on the case of a positive and sizable effective g - factor . if the effective energy splitting was very small the resistivity @ xmath157 would show little change with increasing magnetic field . in the case of a negative and sizable effective g - factor the magnetoresistivity would decrease significantly with increasing magnetic field . therefore , the measurement of the longitudinal field versus magnetic field can be a useful way for judging the shape and the size of the effective zeeman energy splitting of ti surface states . this work was funded by the national science foundation of china ( grant no . 11104002 ) , the national basic research program of china ( grant no . 2012cb927403 ) and by the institute for science & technology research conducted in universities of henan province ( grant no . 2012hastit029 ) .
