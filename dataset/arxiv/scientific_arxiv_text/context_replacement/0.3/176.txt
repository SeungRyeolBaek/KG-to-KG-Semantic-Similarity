particle and transverse energy production in the central rapidity region of heavy ion collisions can be modelled as a mixture of bulk / semihard parton production and soft particle production . with higher energies , the fundamental side - effects are expected to become more important . this is due to two reasons : firstly , that in @ xmath2 collisions the rapid rise of the total and transverse cross sections can be explained by copious production of small partons , _ minijets _ , with large momenta @ xmath3 gev @ xcite . this is also expected to happen in @ xmath4 collisions at very high energies . secondly , the soft particle production increases to @ xmath5 , so that for large particles the production of the partons is reduced further @ xcite . the slow , non - perturbative , particle production of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions can be modelled _ e . g . _ through light @ xcite or through a very strong background colour field @ xcite . the time taken for producing partons and transverse energy into the central rapidity region by such collisions is approximately , where @ xmath6 @ xmath1 , where @ xmath7gev is the smallest transverse momentum used in the computation . the soft collisions are completed at all stages of the process , with @ xmath8 @ xmath1 . if the number of partons produced in the hard and semihard stages of the soft particle collision is large enough - which may be the case - a reduction in the initial parton production can occur @ xcite , and softer particle production will be achieved . the fortunate consequence of this is that the larger component of parton production at the higher rapidities will be _ + _ from perturbative data ( pqcd ) at higher energies and the energy yield from soft collisions with @ xmath9 gev becomes smaller . therefore , the result is that at the sps ( pb + au at @ xmath10 @ xmath11gev ) , the soft component dominates , and at the lhc ( pb + pb at @ xmath12 @ xmath11tev ) the hard component is the dominant component . at the rhic ( au + au at @ xmath13 @ xmath11gev ) one will be in the intermediate region , and other factors should be taken into account . a lotof effort has also been devoted for building plasma ##s @ xcite showing the dominance of nuclear particles in nuclear collisions at high energies . these have generated so much research and generated much interest during the recent years . also recently , a very novel approach to minijet ##s has been developed @ xcite . i have divided this approach basically into two parts . in the first one , i will discuss the basic features of the parton production and review our experimental results @ xcite . the main objective of these studies is to find out the initial conditions for early qgp - formation at @ xmath14 @ xmath1 , determine the transverse energy production into the mid - infrared region , the composition of the parton material , and , to determine the possibility of a very fast thermalization and estimate the initial , baryon - to - entropy ratio . it is especially important to study the early formation of strongly interacting partonic matter , since the initial formation of the qgp , the final , global observables , and the suggested properties of the plasma ##s all depend on the initial conditions . the second half i will use for discussion of an additional method for parton and transverse energy production : minijets from a bfkl - 1@ xcite . thus , we can estimate the total amount of kinetic energy one should expect from the bfkl - minijets in heavy ion collisions . hadronic jets formed from the @ xmath15 electrons and holes are easily observed , but when the partons have @ xmath16 gev the jets become very difficult to distinguish @ xcite from the actual jets . in heavy ion collisions , where we have hundreds ( rhic ) or thousands ( lhc ) of minijets with @ xmath17 gev being produced , detection of individual minijets may be difficult . however , the individual partons are expected to contribute dramatically to the early detection of qgp . the observation of multiple production of the electrons and holes in @ xmath18 and @ xmath4 collisions is based on a picture of independent binary parton - parton distributions . the first quantity is the total scattering cross section , @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 are the fractional values of the two partons @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 , and @ xmath23 are the parton values in @ xmath24 ( @ xmat##h25 ) . the ratio 2 comes from the fact that , for the lowest order ( lo ) pqcd , there are 2 partons produced in each individual subcollision . in the eikonal model for @ xmath18 and @ xcite the ratio @ xmath26 can be expressed as the total number of collision events in one individual sample . the results that can be found in the following @ xcite are obtained with the mrsh @ xcite and mrsd - @ xcite parton distributions with a scale choice @ xmath27 . more detailed results can be found in ref . @ xcite , and the evaluation of eq . ( [ sigmajet ] ) in ref . @ xcite . the ratio 2 is obtained for the lowest order ( lo ) , @ xmath28 . here the - factor @ xmath29 is used to simulate the behavior of nlo jets . studies of the nlo jet - factor @ xmath30 @ xcite show that ( with a scale choice @ xmath27 and with a sample of @ xmath31 ) this is a reasonable factor @ xcite . strictly speaking , however , a factor @ xmath32 - factor @only is defined for quantities where a well - defined , fail - safe acceptance value can be obtained @ xcite . for @ xmath33 - 4 for nuclear collisions , the acceptance value in the whole central heating unit defines such a value . for this acceptance criteria and for @ xmath17 gev the full nlo value has not been computed yet . the best estimate of the average behaviour of produced semihard partons with @ xmath34 in an @ xmath4 collision with a given lattice parameter @ xmath35 can be expressed as @ xcite @ xmath36 and the average transverse energy carried by these partons as @ xcite @ xmath37 where @ xmath38 is the nuclear value of @ xcite which is @ xmath39 , describing exactly the average behaviour of the nuclei in nuclear collisions . the cut is @ xmath40 and , for the samples with woods - saxon energy densities , @ xmath41 . the acceptance value defined for the samples @ xmath42 and for @ xmath43 will be @ xmath44 , and the corresponding cuts will be defined as @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 . in eqs .( [ et ] ) and ( [ et ] ) above , @ xmath47 is the total number of semihard particles and @ xmath48 is the average total energy carried by the partons produced by each of these collisions . we fix @ xmath49 gev , _ i . e . _ we fix the initial energy at @ xmath50 @ xmath1 . the results for the total energy unit of b - b collisions at the rhic and lhc regions are summarized in figure 1 . also , results from proton , proton and neutron collisions are summarized in @ xcite . at @ xmath51 can be found in ref . ] in the example above , we have observed nuclear effects from parton collisions : @ xmath52 . in reality , however , in the typical @ xmath53 - and @ xmath54 there are quite large size corrections @ xcite , especially for the lhc nuclear region . also , the scale evolution of the nuclear shadowing was shown to be very important for the calculations in ref . @ xcite . however , a re - analysis with the input from hera at small - @ xmath53 @ x##cite has to be used for getting a more accurate prediction of the observed effects of minijet production . the rapid rise of the structure of @ xmath55 and the increase of @ xmath53 and at hera @ xcite does not affect the production of the 1 gev minijets at rhic energies very much but it has quite dramatic consequences at the lhc scale . as seen in @ xcite , there is a clear enhancement of minijet production due to the new parton distributions . therefore , the more rapidly the gluon energies rise , the more efficient should be nuclear production due to the glrmq - effect @ xcite . however , a more quantitative prediction depends on the scale factor of the nuclear shadowing as well . the average masses of semihard partons are @ xmath0 @ xmath1 with @ xmath44 and @ xmath56 gev with central pb - b distribution , as given below : . ( [ * ] ) . * is not included and @ xmath57 . the upper bounds are obtained with mrsh and the lower ones with mrsd - parton distribution . * ( * ) * the average total energy carried bythese partons , as predicted by e . ( [ et ] ) . [ parameters = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , options = " header " , ] [ table1 ] let us now have a closer look at the data from fig 1 . there are four important findings . firstly , the gluons can affect both the initial parton and transverse part production : the initial parton production is about 90 % glue . secondly , the effective transverse area of the produced semihard partons is @ xmath58 . comparing this with the effective effective transverse area , @ xmath59 , we find that @ xmath60 _ i . e . _ the parton production at the lhc in fig . 1 @ xmath1 is not large enough so that a lot of parton production can take place @ xcite . in this case , the system @ xmath61 has high _ dynamical _ stability . at rhic , since @ xmath62 , production occurs at the level of @ xmath15 ( since @ xmath63 @ xmath1 ) , and in the region where pqcd can not be achieved . this quali##tative effect is explained by a more quantitative , although still phenomenological , version of ref . @ xcite , where we find that for sufficiently large electrons ( lhc ) and large nuclei ( @ xmath64 ) , a large critical mass is generated , causing a reduction of the minijet cross section @ xcite at a perturbative temperature like @ xmath65 . the result is that the internal parton production is screened and its relative importance becomes irrelevant . the third interesting observation is that the gluonic gas in the high temperature system @ xmath66 can thermalize very rapidly , at least in the lhc nuclear state . in the perturbatively stable system the ( kinetic ) energy per particle is @ xmath67 gev and the energy density of the gas at @ xmath68 ##2 / @ xmath69 / @ xmath70 . the temperature @ xmath71 of an ideal ( massless ideal ) gas in a perfect thermal ( = both physical and chemical ) system with this energy density can be computed from @ xmath72 , and we get @ xmath73 = . 988 ( x. 14 ) gev with the mrsh ( mrsd - ) system . finally , we find @ xcite @ xmath74 note that in the lhc the average number of particles is exactly that in an ideal system in thermal equilibrium . only isotropization is needed , and a rapid thermalization is therefore possible . this instant thermalization would in turn have important effects on _ e . g . _ thermal dileptons , for which a high initial temperature plays a crucial role @ xcite . note that our conclusion of the possibility of an almost rapid thermalization is due to the near - @ xmath53 difference in the total gluon ratio . from the proton / gluon ratio it also follows that thermalization for rhic is likely to occur somewhat quickly . note however , that above i did not consider isotropization of the system at all . in the simplified picture shown here , the decay rate of the atomic nuclei , @ xmath75 , and the total parton spread , @ xmath76 for the partons which will be produced in the mid - rapidity , are known . then a bjorken - like diffusion - like effect is given , and inthe energy density a ##ᵢ for @ xmath77 is the scale parameter . for a more detailed discussion of isotropization , a more detailed microscopic space - time model needs to be given , as described in refs . @ xcite ( see also the discussion in @ xcite ) . the first observation @ xcite is that : , at @ xmath14 fm / @ xmath69 , the net baryon number density in the nuclear heating region is _ small as compared to the energy density , _ larger _ than the particle number density ( 0 . 17 @ xmath78 ) , even though the two nuclei are not already far apart , especially in the lhc where @ xmath79 . more precisely , we estimate @ xmath80 with the mrsh ( mrsd - ) parton distributions . computing the net baryon - to - entropy ratio by solving @ xmath81 for the first noble gas , _ initially _ , and @ xmath0 fm / @ xmath69 : @ xmath82 for lhc , and @ xmath83 for rhic . we assume that for the large colliders we willstill , far away from the initial conditions of the nuclear collisions , where the value of the specific entropy is @ xmath84 @ xcite . for the lhc , given an instant thermalization of the gluon system at @ xmath0 @ xmath1 , and an initial entropy of , the final entropy will be given by the initial entropy of gluons @ xcite . the non - perturbative mechanism for entropy production will not increase the entropy much but will increase the net baryon number . if the non - perturbative component to the net particle number distribution is taken to be of the same order of magnitude as for the initial pb + 1 collision at sps , the _ final _ entropy - to - entropy ratio for the lhc will be @ xmath85 . for the rhic nuclear collisions , thermalization is most likely not as important , but following much the same line of reasoning , and taking into account that the non - perturbative component becomes important , for entropy production , we use @ xmath86 for the final _ baryon - to - entropy ratio . minijet production i have shown that , based on collinear factorization , wherethe perturbative partonic cross sections are obtained at the large scale @ xmath87 from the parton equation with nonperturbative corrections . here , i will give an additional model for minijet and transverse energy transfer , where momentum is not used . the small - @ xmath53 rise in the wave function @ xmath88 observed at leading @ xmath89 gev @ xmath90 @ xcite can be explained by the leading @ xmath91 dglap - ladder @ xcite and also by the leading @ xmath92 ladder @ xcite . also a power - like behaviour , @ xmath93 , observed from the leading @ xmath94 bfkl - ladder @ xcite , does not fit the model . in the following , let us assume that the small - @ xmath53 increase is not due to the bfkl - physics . then , with this assumption , we can see what is the _ small _ transverse energy transfer in the low rapidity region due to the minijets or from the bfkl - ladder in the lhc - region . at rhic the bfkl - minijet##s is not expected to change in any significant way because the bfkl - process takes place only at @ xmath95 . therefore , this latter part of my model , which is based on . . @ xcite , will be useful only for the lhc . it is instructive to start from the example of fully inclusive minijets with two separate jets separated by a small rapidity gap , as described by mueller and navelet @ xcite . the ( first ) subprocess appears first in fig . 1a , where the two partons have momentum components @ xmath96 and @ xmath97 , the tagging jet rapidites @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 ( @ xmath100 ) and transverse ##ly @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 , respectively . between the tagging jets there are @ xmath103 gluons trapped , separated by . . . . @ xmath103 . thus the final jet is represented by a feynman graph with 2 incoming and @ xmath104 outgoing in - shell gluons . the colour - coded bfkl - pomeron model iswhen these feynman moments are taken and , . in the kinematic region we will be interested in , the moments are well ordered , @ xmath105 , and the transverse moments are not , @ xmath106 . thus , the relative degrees of freedom of the motion of the virtual particles become important . the gas jets of fig . 1a have transverse momenta on a perturbative basis , so that we may use collinear ##ity to write the first section above as : @ xmath107 where only gluons are considered . the strong transverse ordering simplifies the continued fraction to @ xmath108 and @ xmath109 , and the parton densities factor out of the sum . for the process @ xmath110 the leading approximation to the small @ xmath111 limit comes from the @ xmath112 - 1 approximation . in a physical gauge , this approximation is also gauge invariant up to the subleading operator . the matrix of @ xmath113 consists then of the following building blocks : in the small @ xmath111 approximation , in a physical gauge and with the strong gauge approximation , eachgluon can be regarded as emitted from an independent non - local lipatov - vertex , where bremsstrahlung from initial and second legs and energy from the source energy are summed . these are represented by the black blobs in figure 1 . also the results are effective ones since they are exponentiated ( reggeized ) after computing the leading virtual link to the @ xmath112 - channel gluon exchange . the effective ones are drawn by the ( black ) lines in fig . 2 . original paper , the details and applications of these concepts can be found in the useful technical article by del duca @ xcite . first , we consider each state element @ xmath113 , and thanks to the proper choice in rapidities , the singlet states with @ xmath104 rungs are formed . the colour algebra can be obtained by summing ( averaging ) over the different ( initial ) state elements , and the resulting sums can be computed . with help of _ e . g . _ laplace - transform ( in @ xmath114 ) , the colour integrals can be disentangled . finally , the sum over @ xmath##103 , one has an ordinary differential equation , the modified bfkl - equation @ xcite ( see also @ xcite ) , which describes the integration of a jet into the non - singlet - pomeron ladder . the bfkl - ladder is represented by @ xmath115 in fig 1a . the cross section ( [ fact ] ) then reads : @ xmath116 where @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 . if all the real corrections and the virtual corrections are equal , the ladder reduces into @ xmath119 , and the upper limit for the two jets separated by a fixed generic factor is recovered @ xcite . let us then study the problem with tagging jets further . on one side of the ladder , as shown in fig . 1 is possible to sum the coefficients with gluon coefficients between the fixed jet @ xmath120 and the fixed minijet @ xmath69 , and , between the minijet @ xmath69 and the fixed jet @ xmath121 . this creates a factor on each side of the first rung . especially , we see that a generic factor @ xmath##122 , which describes the phase - space expansion and contraction of the two lipatov functions associated with the step @ xmath69 , arises from fixing the the step @ xmath69 . the inner product becomes @ xcite @ xmath123 our goal is to study the leading bfkl minijet model , which is @ xmath124 . as illustrated in fig . 2 , we therefore relax the requirement of no tagging jets . the coupling of the pomeron ladder to the hadron becomes more non - perturbative and a beta - distribution , or , rather , a parton distribution , can be obtained . however , now that we do not have any such jets , we have to give up collinear ##ity . we do not have any perturbative coupling processes to compare with , either . therefore , the best we can do is to use the procedure for deep energy scattering ( dis ) , @ xcite , where the addition of a particle into the pomeron ladder between the two hadrons and nuclei is expected to be described by the _ homogeneous _ bfkl equation for the _ energy density @ xmath125 , @xmath126 . \ left { hbfkl } \ ] ] normalization for this time - invariant distribution is given by the gluon number @ xmath127 obtained from the input @ xcite . . using the knowledge of the parameters obtained from fixing the parameters of the bfkl - pomeron ladder , the inclusive minijet cross section from the bfkl - ladder can now be written down as @ xcite @ xmath128 where @ xmath15 and @ xmath129 are the angular momentum and the energy ( from the measured cms ) of the minijet . from momentum conservation and multi - regge , the remaining parameters are @ xmath130 . due to the fact that in this case we do not have an ` ` external ' ' particle model for the observed particle with an associated quark , as a whole , nor an outer - shell born cross section to relax into , we can not fix the overall dimensionless mass of @ xmath131 . . however , we are able to find the _ z _ of the minijet @ xmath15 - distribution , which will be useful for determining the upper limit oftransverse energy production from the bfkl - ladder . the minijet cross section of eq . ( [ bfklmini ] ) is shown in fig . 1 @ xcite . for the bfkl - ladder we have : the bulk energy distributions associated with the lo - @ xmath53 are in the distribution mrsd - @ xcite . for example , the more complex ( cfltlo ) minijet cross sections , discussed in the second part of the article , are now shown with the mrsd - parton distributions . the nlo - analysis @ xcite shows that lo + nlo calculation with the factorization gives the standard jet cross section of . therefore , at @ xmath132 gev , the bfkl - minijet contribution should be greater than the collinearly contribution . we can therefore argue that @ xmath133 . the transverse energy production due to the minijets from the bfkl - ladders , @ xmath134 and @ xmath4 , can now be calculated @ xcite from @ xmath135 the solution of the bfkl ladder is obtained when we remove the point , and the crossit diverges from @ xmath136 . a cut - off is , however , needed only for the bfkl case . the decrease of the cfltlo - minijet cross section in the lhc p - p collision ( as shown in the second part of the figure ) , means that the bfkl - cross section should not be much higher than the curve shown in fig . [ dsdpt ] . therefore , we should not trust the bfkl - contribution with @ xmath137 below @ xmath138 gev . with these numbers , we solve for central p - p collisions in the lhc , @ xmath139 gev with fixed @ xmath140 , and , 4940 gev with ( _ _ hoc _ ) fixed @ xmath141 . comparing these numbers to the figure 15330 gev in figure 1b for gluons , we find that the bfkl - contribution is at least a one hundred % correction to the result in @ xcite . on the other hand , we should not evaluate the results at the same level of approximations , ( _ lo _ , @ xmath142 fixed ) _ _ .e . _ _ , and a . fig . [ dsdpt ] below . _ the two contributions are of similar magnitude . in this case , however , the @ xmath61 from the cfltlo - theory should be larger than 2 gev , and the bfkl contribution would therefore be the smaller one . we worked under the assumption that the bfkl - evolution is true for _ all _ the leading - @ xmath53 contributions at infinity , _ i . e . _ we found the _ small _ contribution from the kinematical theory relevant for the hard bfkl - pomeron . since the above results cannot be explained by the leading @ xmath143 and / or the leading @ xmath144 contributions , the leading @ xmath94 - evolution is obviously not the dominant contribution at the highest values of @ xmath53 . therefore , my conclusion is that the bfkl - minijets can bridge the way towards classical physics at @ xmath145 gev , but the boundary conditions required for the hard qgp - reactions in the lhc - reactions are dominantly given by the minijets computed in collinear pairs . * p .* the figures given in this article are based on calculations . i would like to thank k . kajantie , a . leonidov , a . mller , v . ruuskanen and y . - wang for their work . i also give my thanks to a . leonidov and v . ruuskanen for getting our bfkl - project started and to m . blaizot and m . mueller , nucl . phys . * b289 * ( 1987 ) 847 . k . kajantie , j . j . landshoff and j . lindfors , phys . * 2000 * ( 1987 ) 2517 ; + c . j . eskola , k . kajantie and j . lindfors , nucl . phys . * b323 * ( 1989 ) 188 . eskola , k . kajantie and v . ruuskanen , phys . b332 * ( 1994 ) 191 . a . andersson , b . gustafson , a . johansson - almqvist , nucl . b281 * ( 1986 ) 289 . a . werner , phys .
