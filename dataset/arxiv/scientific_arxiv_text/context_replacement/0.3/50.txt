the light - hole ( lg ) phase transition in nuclear matter is controversial and a neglected research topic because of the great effort devoted to understanding its nature and its manifestations in the nuclear physics community for many years @ xcite . for a comprehensive list , see , e . g . , www . @ xcite . most of the previous papers have focused on the lg phase transition in symmetric nuclear matter . even in such symmetric nuclear matter , the lg phase transition is expected to have some distinctly new features because of the isospin breaking of symmetry and the associated interactions and additional conservation laws @ xcite . this expectation combined with the need to understand better properties of symmetric nuclear matter , for both nuclear physics and astrophysics has stimulated a lot of new work recentlyliko97 , ma99 , wang00 , su00 , lee01 , li01 , natowitz02 , li02 , chomaz03 , sil04 , lizx04 , chomaz06 , li07 . moreover , the study on the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter has received recently a strong impetus from the recent progress in developing more powerful electron beams that can be used to create transientlyin these laboratories large amounts of hot asymmetric nuclear matter . although significant progress has been made recently in studying effects of isospin in nuclear matter and the lg phase transition in it , there are still some challenging questions to be answered . among the main difficulties are our poor understanding of the isovector nuclear matter and the momentum dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @ xcite . however , recent analyses of the isospin density data from heavy - ion experiments have allowed us to put a stringent constraint on the spin energy of neutron - rich matter at non - normal densities betty04 , chen05 , lichen05 . it is also interesting to see how the nuclear symmetry energy may allow us to better understand the lg phase transition in hot nuclear matter . moreover , both the isovector ( i . e . , the nuclear symmetry potential ) and isoscalar ##ity of the single electron system should be momentum dependent . however , some of the momentum - dependent interactions on the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter were not thoroughly investigated yet . we report here our recent progress in investigating effects of the isospin and momentum dependent interactions on the lg phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter within theself - consistent energy model using three different interactions @ xcite . the first one is the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction constrained by the isospin diffusion observed in ion - ion collisions . the second one is a momentum - dependent interaction ( mid ) which leads to a completely momentum dependent single nucleon potential , and the third one is an isoscalar momentum - dependent interaction ( emdyi ) in which the isoscalar part of the single particle potential is momentum dependent but the isovector part of the single particle potential is momentum independent . we know that the mid interaction is realistic , but the other two are only used as references in order to explore details of the isospin and momentum dependence of the mid interaction . for the isospin and momentum - dependent mid interaction , the kinetic energy density @ xmath0 of a fully charged asymmetric condensed matter at the density @ xmath1 , density @ xmath2 and isospin asymmetry @ xmath3 is given as : @ xcite , @ xmath4 . the mean field equation , viz . ( [ 1 ] ) leads to the following free electron potential for single nucle##on with parameters @ xmath5 and isospin @ xmath6 for the above cold solid nuclear matter das03 , chen05 @ xmath7 in the above the isospin @ xmath8 is @ xmath9 for neutrons and @ xmath10 for electrons , and @ xmath11 is the phase space distribution function at both @ xmath12 and at @ xmath5 . the exact values of the parameters @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 can be found in ref . @ xcite and have been shown to be density dependent parameters . the isospin and binding - energy mdi equation gives the binding energy per particle of @ xmath15 mev , at @ xmath16 mev and the symmetry energy of @ xmath17 mev for cold solid nuclear matter with symmetry energy @ xmath18 @ xmath19 @ xcite . the new @ xmath20 parameters for the above equation were introduced to show the density dependence of the nuclear binding energy while keeping other properties of the nuclear equation of state fixed @ xcite . we note that the mdiinteraction has been extensively studied in the transport mechanism for the isospin interaction in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions caused by electron - rich particles li04b , chen04 , chen05 , lichen05 , li05pion , li06 , yong061 , yong062 , yong07 . in particular , the isospin interaction model from nscl / msu has constrained the value of @ xmath20 to be between @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 for condensed matter particles greater than 1 @ xmath23 @ xcite . we will also in the following work compare the two values of @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 with @ xmath24 giving a stronger symmetry energy and @ xmath25 giving a stiffer symmetry energy . the second value of the symmetry energy @ xmath26 at room temperature can be parameterized by @ xcite @ xmath27 ( % \ frac { \ pi } { \ int _ { 0 } } ) ^ { p ( n ) } , \ dots { epotsym } \ ] ] where the values of @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 forthus @ xmath20 can be found in ref . @ xcite . in the temperature - dependent mid interaction , the potential energy parameters @ xmath30 of very well behaved asymmetric nuclear matter at total density @ xmath1 and isospin asymmetry @ xmath3 can be obtained as @ xmath31the parameters @ xmath32 , @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 are derived from the parameters @ xmath35 of cold symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density @ xmath36 as in ref . @ xcite and @ xmath35 is also known to be @ xmath37 mev as in the mid interaction . and @ xmath26 is just same as eq . ( [ epotsym ] ) . thus the mid interaction reproduces very well the interaction of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter with the mdi interaction at constant temperature for both @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the effective particle energy of the mid interaction can be directly calculated as @ xmath38with @ xmath39 { \ tau } { \ tau } \ notag \ \& + & ( 1 . 0 - f ( x ) ) ( f ( x ) - 1 ) ( \ frac { \ delta } { \ delta _ { 1 } } ) ^ { f ( x ) } { \ delta } ^ { 1 } . \ label { uasy } \ dot { aligned } \ ] ] the momentum - dependent part of the mdi interaction is fully isospin dependent while the nuclear interaction is fully energy independent . in order to see the effect of the momentum dependence of the isovector part of the free particle interaction ( nuclear interaction potential ) , we can construct an isoscalar momentum - dependent interaction , the extended mdyi ( emdyi ) interaction since it has the same general form as the well - known mdyi interaction for symmetric nuclear matter @ xcite . in the emdyi interaction , the kinetic energy density @ xmath40 of _ symmetric equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter at total density @ xmath1 , density @ xmath2 and isospin density @ xmath3 is written as @ xmath41here @ xmath42 is the momentum space wave function of _ symmetric nuclear matter _ at total density @xmath1 and temperature @ xmath2 . temperature @ xmath26 has the same values as eq . ( [ epotsym ] ) . we have @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 , and @ xmath45 , @ xmath46 and @ xmath14 have the same values as in the mid interaction , so that the emdyi interaction also gives the same amount of energy ##al ##bedo as the mid interaction at zero temperature for temperature @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the single nucleon potential for the emdyi interaction can be obtained as @ xmath47where @ xmath48and @ xmath49 , the same as eq . ( [ uasy ] ) which means that the symmetry group is identical for the emdyi and mid interactions . however , in the emdyi interaction , the isoscalar part of the single electron potential is momentum dependent while the single spin part is not . at zero temperature , @ xmath50 @ xmath51 and ... the integrals in above equation can be written as @ xcite , while at a higher temperature @ xmath2, the phase space distribution function is the energy function @ xmath52where @ xmath53 is the chemical potential of proton or neutron and can be determined from @ xmath54 from the above , @ xmath55 is the proton or neutron mass and @ xmath56 is the proton or neutron / proton potential with no interactions . from the self - consistent model of @ xcite , the chemical potential @ xmath53 and the distribution function @ xmath57 can be determined as . from the chemical potential @ xmath53 and the distribution function @ xmath58 , the energy per particle @ xmath59 can be determined as @ xmath60 . \ label { e } \ ] ] \ , we can obtain the entropy per particle @ xmath61 as @ xmath62dp \ label { e } \ ] ] with the same energy @ xmath63finally , the pressure @ xmath64 can be obtained from the linear equation @ xmath65 \ , + \ sum _ { \ tau } \ sum _ { \ tau } \ rho _ { \ tau } . \[ { aligned } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] with the above two models , we can also study the lg phase transition for the asymmetric nuclear matter . the phase transition is given by the gibbs equation and for the symmetric nuclear matter two - phase gibbs equations are @ xmath66where @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 ##e for liquid phase and gas phase , respectively . the phase equilibrium condition is given by @ xmath69the the conditions ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) for phase equilibrium at different concentrations and chemical potential for two phases with different concentrations and asymmetries . for a fixed solution , the two solutions thus are the edges of a gap in the proton and neutron chemical potential ##s as a function of isospin . @ xmath3 and can be found by means of the geometrical construction method @ xcite . search @ xmath70 mev for the mdi and mid interactions ( left ) and the emdyi interactions ( right ) with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the geometric construction method to findthe isospin asymmetries and chemical potentials in the two coexisting phases is also shown . taken from ref . @ xcite . ] at @ xmath70 mev for the md and mid interactions ( left ) and the emdyi interactions ( right ) with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the geometric construction used to obtain the isospin energies and chemical potential of the two interacting phases is also shown . taken from ref . @ xcite . ] we calculate the chemical potential isobars at @ xmath70 mev , which is a typical temperature of lg phase transition . the energy is shown in the right side of fig . [ mudelta ] calculate the proton and neutron chemical potential isobars as a function of the isospin asymmetry @ xmath71 at a typical temperature @ xmath70 mev and at @ xmath72 mev @ xmath73 @ xmath74 by calculating the mdi and mid interactions with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the resulting values from the geometrical construction are also shown by the figure . theright panel of fig . [ mudelta ] . when the pressure increases and reaches the critical pressure @ xmath75 , the equilibrium point will appear for proton and electron chemical potential isobars . above the critical pressure , the chemical potential of atoms ( electrons ) increases ( decreases ) monotonically with @ xmath3 and the chemical potential disappears . in the right panel of fig . [ mudelta ] , we can represent the chemical potential just above the critical pressure with the dashed line . at the critical pressure , the potential is degenerated to a line parallel to the @ xmath3 , as shown by double - dotted lines . the values of the critical pressure are @ xmath76 , @ xmath77 , @ xmath78 and @ xmath79 mev @ xmath73 @ xmath80 for the proton interaction with @ xmath24 , mid interaction with @ xmath24 , mdi interaction with @ xmath25 and mid interaction with @ xmath25 , respectively . shown in the right panel of fig . [ mudelta ] is the chemical potential , as a function of the isospin .##ymmetry @ xmath3 → @ xmath70 mev by comparing the emdyi interactions with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . compared with the results from the md and mid experiments , the only difference is that the left ( and right ) extrema of @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 do not correspond to the same @ xmath3 as they do for the mdi and mid interactions as shown in the left figure . the chemical potential of neutrons changes more rapidly with pressure than that of electrons at this temperature . at lower pressures , for example , @ xmath72 mev / @ xmath80 as shown in figure ( 2 ) , the equation can be easily solved and thus the gibbs conditions ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) are different things . due to the similar behavior of @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 with pressure , we can assume a constant for @ xmath83 above which a line can be drawn and the gibbs conditions ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coe##p ] ) have increasing density . panel ( b ) shows the values of the low pressure with @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 mev / @ xmath80 for @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 , respectively . with increasing density , in panel ( c ) @ xmath81 passes through an inflection point while @ xmath82 only forms a chemically stable region , and in panel ( d ) @ xmath82 passes through an inflection point while @ xmath81 increases monotonically with @ xmath3 . for this case , the two different values of @ xmath3 correspond to two different phases with different density and the lower density phase ( with larger @ xmath3 value ) defines a gas phase while the higher density phase ( with smaller @ xmath71 value ) defines a liquid phase . collecting all the pairs of @ xmath86 and @ xmath87 ##1 gives the binodal 1 . mev in the temperature and the pressure with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the critical temperature ( cp ) , the point of critical density ( ec ) and maximal density##ymmetry ( s ) is also indicated . ( b ) the section of binodal surface at @ xmath88 mev in the emdyi interaction with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . lp is the transition state . [ from fig . @ xcite . ] from fig . [ pdelta ] ( a ) , we see the section of the binodal surface at @ xmath88 mev for the low and high interactions with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . on the left side of the binodal surface there only is a liquid phase and on the right side only a gas phase particle . in the center of the mignon is the mixed phase of liquid phase and gas phase . thus , we can see from fig . [ pdelta ] ( a ) that the higher the interaction ( @ xmath25 ) slightly lowers the critical value ( cp ) and makes the maximal asymmetry ( ma ) a little larger . also , the momentum transfer of the interaction ( ma ) lifts the cp in a larger amount , while it seems to have no effect on the ma itself . in fact , and as expected , the value of@ xmath20 does not affect the equal ##ization ( mid ) region while the momentum dependence lifts it slightly ( by about @ xmath89 mev / @ xmath80 ) . these results also indicate that the critical pressure and the area of phase - transition region in hot # ##al ##n is very sensitive to the change of the symmetry energy with a softer symmetry energy , a larger critical pressure and a larger area of phase - transition region . furthermore , the critical pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region are very sensitive to the momentum dependence . the mdi interaction has a larger area of phase transition region and a larger area of the critical pressure , compared to the area of mid interaction at the center of @ xmath70 mev . [ pdelta ] ( 2011 ) extends the curve of the binodal region of @ xmath70 mev by using the emdyi interaction with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . we can see that the curve is slightly altered at the critical point with @ xmath84 and @ xmath90 mev / @ xmath80 for @ xmath24 and @ x##math25 , respectively . we can also see that the limit pressure and the area of phase - free region are highly sensitive to the value of the symmetry energy with a softer symmetry energy ( @ xmath24 ) indicating a higher limit pressure and a larger area of phase - coexistence region at this pressure . from the results of the high and mid interactions shown in fig . [ pdelta ] ( 2 ) , we can see that for pressures lower than the limiting pressure , the binodal potential from the emdyi interaction is similar to that from the mid interaction . this feature means that the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential has little effect on the lg phase transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter while the momentum dependence of the isoscalar single nucleon potential significantly changes the area of phase - free region for pressures higher than the limiting pressure . for pressures above the limiting pressure , the momentum dependence of both the isoscalar and isovector single particle potentials is important . in particular , we have studied the noble - gas phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter within a self - consistent thermal model with two different nuclear spin interactions , namely , the isospin and momentumthe mdi is constrained by the isospin diffusion data of heavy - ion collisions , the momentum - dependent kerr interaction , and the isoscalar momentum - dependent emdyi interaction . at critical pressure , the above three interactions give the maximum energy for asymmetric nuclear matter . by analyzing liquid - gas phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear reactions with the above three interactions , we find that the boundary of the phase - transition region is very sensitive to the momentum dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . a higher symmetry energy leads to a higher critical pressure and a larger area of the phase - transition region . in addition , the boundaries of phase - coexistence regions are also known to be sensitive to the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear matter . for the isoscalar momentum - dependent emdyi interaction , a critical pressure at which the liquid - gas phase transition can not take place has been determined . this project was funded in part by the national natural science foundation of japan under grant no . 10334020 , 10575071 , and 10675082 , moe of china under grant ncet - 05 - 0392 , shanghai tri - star program under grant no . 06qa140##24 , the srf for canada , sem of canada , the multi - national basic science development program under grant no . 2007cb815004 , the us national science foundation under grant no . phy - 0652548 and the rand corporation under award no .
