recent developments in photoelectron ##ics have challenged the relatively simple truth that the fermi surface of cuprate superconductors is actually the surface closest to lda band structure with the net effect of the closeness to the mott - hubbard insulator being a high extinction coefficient of the band width . the discovery of the ` shadow state ' @ xcite , the temperature dependent pseudogap in the underdoped devices @ xcite and the strong temperature dependence of the quasiparticle band structure @ xcite leave little doubt that a simple two - dimensional model is quite possibly inadequate for these materials . indeed , photoemission experiments in one - dimensional ( 1d ) silicon devices @ xcite have shown very clear evidence of the charge conservation . the equally clear nonobservation of these signatures in the cuprate superconductors at any doping level advises against the more simple truth , namely that the fermi surface observed in the cuprates is simply that of the ` spinons ' in a modified version of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) observed at 1d . motivated by these developments , we have done a detailed exact diagonalization study of the electron removal mechanism of the 1d and devices @ xmath0 @ x##math1 @ xmath2 @ . this model extends @ xmath7 , where the ` spin ' fermion operators are defined as @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 denotes the spin operator on x @ xmath10 . the model @ xmath11 extends over all pairs of nearest neighbors in a 1d / 2d crystal lattice . + the electron energy spectrum is defined as @ xmath12 denote the ground state energy and correlation function . for large finite clusters , this model can be solved exactly by means of the lanczos algoritm @ xcite . + for 1d the @ xmath0 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 model is solvable as an ansatz in the case @ xmath2 @ xmath13 @ xmath14 @ xcite , but even for this model the complexity of the resulting ansatz equations requires the evaluation of dynamical correlation functions . for the closely related hubbard model in the case @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 the bethe - ansatz equations simplify @ xcite , and the exact evaluation of the correlation function is possible @ xcite. in all these cases lanczos theory is the only way to obtain numerical results for @ xmath18 @ xcite . + in order to obtain our numerical results , we first need to have an intuitive understanding of the scaling properties of the elementary excitations in 1d , which will turn out to be true only in 2d . it has been shown by ogata and shiba @ xcite that for @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 the wave functions can be expressed as functions of a spinless fermion wave function , which depends only on the number of the holes , and a spin wave function , which depends only on the number of spins . a simple explanation for this scaling property is the ` splitting ' of a system created in a nel - spin state into an uncharged charge - like domain wall , and a charged spinless domain wall . then , since it is the kinetic energy @ xmath19 @ xmath0 which propagates the charge - like domain walls , whereas the potential energy @ xmath19 @ xmath2 moves the charge - like domain walls , we may say that the two types of domain walls have different energy levels . since the excitations ofthe elementary parts of the correlation function ( i . e . , the ` holons ' ) have @ xmath0 as their energy scale , whereas those of the spin part ( i . e . , the ` spinons ' ) have @ xmath2 as their energy scale . scanning the high energy excitation spectrum of 1d @ xmath0 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 , , shows that the majority of the excited states have excitation energies of the form @ xmath20 @ xcite , which indicates the existence of two free electron excitations with different energy scales . + surprisingly , the low energy spectrum of the 2d model shows the same general behavior of the excitation energies as in 1d @ xcite , which seems to indicate the existence of two types of spin and holes , if of different energies also in this model . the cluster effects indicate , however , that these two types of particles do not exist for ` free electrons ' : the electron spin correlation function , which corresponds to the ` electron - hole excitations ' of holons and shows very low energy peaks in 1d @ xcite is completely incoherent in 2d and shows absolutely no significantlow energy part @ xcite . the optical conductivity in 2d shows an incoherent low energy part with energy 1 @ xmath2 @ xcite - which is rather unexpected for the correlation function of the spin operator which depends only on the charge degrees of freedom . there is also rather clear experimental evidence @ xcite that the spin - like low energy excitations can be described to very good approximation as spin @ xmath21 ` spin ##on ' @ xcite - i . e . , electrons dressed up in a dense cloud of electronic excitations . + to obtain further information about similarities and differences between 1d and 2d , also in comparison to the experimental data , we have performed a systematic study of the electron removal mechanisms in both cases . it has become apparent , there are some similarities , but also clear differences . we assume that the only interaction between 1d and 2d is a strong weak interaction between ` spinon ' and ` holon ' in 2d , which leads to a band of bound states being formed out of the continuum of the spinon and holon states . this band of bound states - which are nothing but simple spin @ xmath21 fermions bound to the black holes - then enters the stagefor the low energy physics of the system , i . e . , true spin - orbit transition ##s in 1d models occurs . we begin with a discussion of the 1d model and half - life . figure [ fig1 ] shows the electron energy spectrum for the @ xmath22 - site system . let us first consider the first panel , where energies are given in units of @ xmath2 . here , we will distinguish different types of states according to their energy behavior with @ xmath0 : there is a ` band ' of peaks ( connected by the thin spectral line ) whose energies corresponding to the free - electron ground state at @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath24 are essentially unchanged on a scale of @ xmath0 , i . e . , these states have @ xmath2 as their energy scale . as a simple example , this ` band ' completely disappears half - way through the brillouin zone , i . e . , there are no peaks whose energy scales with @ xmath2 or @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath24 . this looks like a gas - filled free - electron band with a single level peak at @ xmath24, which however is not remarkable because inverse scattering is not observed in space - filling . next , in addition to this ` @ xmath2 - band ' , there are several sets of states whose excitation energy follows a similar systematic pattern with @ xmath0 . indeed , when plotting the same peaks and expressing them in terms of @ xmath0 ( right side of fig . [ fig1 ] ) these peaks coalesce , i . e . , to excellent effect the energy scale of these peaks is @ xmath0 . this sequence of states with different energy scales can be clearly seen in the ` double bond ' for @ xmath25 @ xmath13 @ xmath26 and momentum @ xmath27 : the state with lower binding energy falls into the @ xmath2 - band , the state with the higher binding energy belongs to the @ xmath0 - band . the dispersion of the @ xmath0 - band is a large asymmetric parabola with maximum energy @ xmath24 for the low excitation energy that we are considering . the states that fall onto this band lead to the creation of a spinon with minimum @ xmat##h4 @ xmath13 @ xmath28 , and the holon of momentum @ xmath29 . since the spinon momentum is fixed , this group of states therefore simply traces out the holon distribution . on the other hand , the ` @ xmath2 - peak ' corresponds to the holon of momentum located at the center of the holon distribution , and therefore traces out the spinon momentum . + this starting point for the spectrum can be traced back . thus , one can expect that not only @ xmath4 but any spinon momentum may serve as the starting point for a new branch of states which traces out the full holon distribution . that this is not the case is shown in fig . [ fig2 ] . there , the basic structure of the spectrum is shown and we have chosen the zero of energy at the peak instead of either the highest ` @ xmath2 - peak ' at @ xmath30 ( left panel ) or the topmost ` @ xmath2 - peak ' at @ xmath31 ( right panel ) . due to this choice of the zero of energy , the ` @ xmath6 of the spinon withthe angular momentum drops off . then , when measuring energies in units of @ xmath0 , holon ##s ` are sharp ' , i . e . , their energy _ relative to the total spinon energy _ scales associated with @ xmath0 . therefore , these two sets of energies to an approximation all trace out the same simple backfolded nearest neighbor with dispersion , i . e . , the basis of the holon is at @ xmath32 . as shown above , the complete holon band is constructed from the spinons fermi ##ons , @ xmath30 , so that the dispersion at the local minimum of @ xmath33 could be seen in detail . we have also verified that by alligning the spinon band at @ xmath34 , another complete holon band can be constructed . + we can thus infer the following uncertainty relation for the wave function : the basis for the energy spectrum is the ` half - filled ' spinon band , with dispersion @ xmath35 ; this is shown by the two straight lines in fig . then , each @ xmath36 - point of this band provides the ` basis ' for the complete holon band @ xmat##h37 , which is ` hooked on ' to the spinon band at the band maximum ; these holon bands are represented by the four full lines in fig . [ fig3 ] ( a ) . comparison with the experimental results ( in this case for the @ xmath38 - site pair ) in fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) shows that up to excellent accuracy the poles of the single electron single lines map onto these lines . there are some deviations at high binding energies , which however is most probably a result of the lanczos calculations , which are highly accurate even at low excitation energies . moreover , the holon bands in fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) have been slightly shifted , i . e . , they are ` hooked on ' to the spinon band , yet at their maximum - we have verified that this shift has an effect for all chain bonds , so that it only has a finite size effect . as an interesting note , the pole weight seems to be different for each of these holon bands , i . e . , the weight is a function only of the spinon band ( this seems not to be true for @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath17 and@ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath39 ; here it should be noted that for these , the holon band intersects itself , which leads to a decrease of the peak weight ) . in the upper limit , the number of bands increases , while also their peak weight decreases , resulting in new continua . comparing with the experimental results of sorella and parola @ xcite for the case @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 it is obvious that the first holon band in our universe , originating from the spinon angular momentum , turns into a disk - like singularity of the same weight . the spinon band itself , whose energy level is @ xmath2 , turns into a second dispersionless band in this case , which appears with the same energy as @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath17 and @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath24 . sorella and parola found the peak weight of the second band to be @ xmath40 , which corresponds to both the backfolded and the nearest - neighborband , @ xmath41 . + summarizing the data for 1d we find that the entire electron removal spectrum has a very simple building principle , which moreover holds for all momenta and frequencies . analyzing the comparison of the spectral features with @ xmath2 and @ xmath0 we can identify ` clusters ' of states which carry out the dispersion of the most elementary states of the tll , including the lowest energy and charge excitations . the dispersions of the spinons and holons are both consistent with simple nearest neighbor absorption bands , the spinons also have a half - filled absorption band . although these results may not be really interesting or interesting , we find that they demonstrate that exploiting the scaling properties of these bands is a very simple method to distinguish the different ` subbands ' . in the following , we will make extensive use of this information to solve the much less understood problems of 2d and 3d scattering . we proceed to the standard model , and we consider first the case of half filled . the clusters shown below correspond to the single @ xmath38 - site cluster , which is the only cluster for which the scaling of the electron removal spectrum is done . in the dopedcase . the @ xmath42 - site for this cluster , which is shown in fig . [ fig3a ] , consists of the group of peaks which generally follows the @ xmath43 line , and a small range of @ xmath44 @ xmath16 @ xmath45 . we would like to show that spectra for other clusters are completely consistent with those for the @ xmath38 - site cluster . then , the left panel of fig . [ fig4 ] shows the photoemission spectrum for this cluster at high - resolution ; thereby we again focus on energies of a peak @ xmath2 from the top of the band and on energies in excess of @ xmath2 . when the peaks are located at the top of the band , the energies of the most dominant low energy peaks do not show a significant variation with @ xmath0 . these peaks do show a slight but significant variation with @ xmath0 , which energy is much lower than the 1d . another notable feature is the peak of @ xmath46 , whose peak excitation energy decreases rather than increases with @ xmath0 . inspection shows , however , that the ( very strong ) peaks along the top@ xmath44 @ xmath16 @ xmath45 ( i . e . , the lowest three terms in fig . [ fig4 ] ) combine with @ xmath0 to good approximation . another possible explanation is the fact that a hole in a 2d string has two different mechanisms for propagation , firstly by ` string hopping ' , which gives effective hopping ##s @ xmath19 @ xmath2 , and secondly by hopping along spiral paths @ xcite , which gives ( smaller ) effective hopping # @ xmath19 @ xmath0 @ xcite . it can be from @ xcite that the dispersion relation for a 2d hole to good approximation can be written as @ xmath47 where @ xmath48 are coupling constants . the first term , which comes from the string hopping mechanism , gives the hole which is degenerate along @ xmath44 @ xmath16 @ xmath45 and this term is related to the second term which is the one from the spiral path ; this also explains the coupling of the hole along this path with @ xmath0 . comparing with 1d we note that with the exceptionof @ xmath49 the ` @ xmath2 - band ' is present in the entire brillouin spectrum , i . e . , the spinon - surface seen at high - energy in 1d does not exist . + we refer to the right side of fig . [ fig4 ] ( 2 ) , which shows the full width of the spectrum , with energies measured in units of @ xmath0 . it is first of all quite obvious that the spectra generally are more ` diffuse ' than in 1d , with the peaks appearing only in the immediate vicinity of the top of the spectrum ( except for a very brief high energy peak in @ xmath49 ) . however , among the diffuse peaks at high energy levels are those whose energy level corresponds with @ xmath0 . although these ` peaks ' are very diffuse , so that the assignment of a dispersion is not really necessary , their distribution of mass can be roughly described by the symbol @ xmath50 , which is representative of the dispersion of the ` holon - band ' observed by sorella and parola @ xcite in 1d . an important difference as compared to 1d is the fact that this @ xmath0 - band doesnone seem to reach the top of the energy spectrum - rather each has an energy of @ xmath19 @ xmath0 below the @ xmath2 - band , which forms the first ionization state . we say that ` in 1d state ' the most plausible interpretation of the data is the concept of bound states of spinon and holon : assuming a strong attraction between these two states , which may differ , e . g . , from the well - known strong attraction for hole states in an antiferromagnet @ xcite , one may expect that this band of bound states is pulled out of the band of bound spinons and holons . this band of bound states corresponds to the @ xmath2 - band ( which however has a small contribution @ xmath51 in its energy due to the spiral path effect ) . such a bound state of spinon and holon should be a bean - shaped like the @ xmath21 fermion , i . e . , a sphere , dressed with spin excitations . there is no experimental evidence @ xcite , that this is unlike the character of the low energy states in materials with high doping . one may expect , however , thatsuch a bound state may not be stable for all interactions , and we believe that this is the reason for the existence of a @ xmath2 - band at @ xmath49 . in this case , the 2d analogue of the holon is not a coherently coupled excitation , because it is bound to the much slower spinon by the linearly coupled string structure . this result fits well with the general ##ization of the dynamical spin correlation function in 2d @ xcite : this function , which in a tll should describe basically the behavior of the free holons , in 2d has almost exclusively diffuse high energy ` peaks ' , with virtually no sharp high energy peaks . moreover , the diffuse ( in the absence of spin charge separation ) behavior of @ xmath2 at different scales in the optical spectrum is also well understood in terms of the self - excitations of a single spinon - holon pair @ xcite . + summarizing the results for 2d , we have a band of sharp peaks , which also includes @ xmath2 at the energy scale , and a diffuse high energy ` band ' with the scale @ xmath0 . both , the absence of the ` spinonfermi surface ' , as well as the presence of sharp ` holon bands ' are in stark contrast to the situation in 1d . the presence of transition states of spinon and holon , resulting in a split - open ring of bean - shaped high spin @ xmath21 fermions explains this in a natural way . we return to 1d and consider the second case . figure [ fig5 ] shows the wave function for the @ xmath22 - type atom with @ xmath26 holes . expressing the energy in terms of @ xmath2 ( left panel ) we can easily determine the spinon band . for @ xmath26 holes in @ xmath22 , the nominal fermi surface is @ xmath4 @ xmath13 @ xmath52 ( i . e . , half way between @ xmath31 and @ xmath24 ) and the spinon band is up to this momentum . as was the case in half - life , the other atoms show a slight increase of their excitation energy , and changing the unit of energy to @ xmath0 ( right panel ) again makes a more sharp ` holon band ' visible to which these peaks correspond .the holon band again takes the form of a backfolded tight - binding band , but this time the top of the band at @ xmath23 @ xmath13 @ xmath24 is missing . the holon band also appears to contain the fermi energy at @ xmath4 and at @ xmath5 @ xmath13 @ xmath53 ( the angular momentum is half way between @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 ) . this calculation of the spectral line nicely corresponds with the more exact calculation in the limit @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 . penc _ et al . _ @ xcite : on the photoemission energy , this experiment has a high intensity ` band ' which is very similar to the backfolded tight - binding band of the holon band . in addition there is a dispersionless high intensity band at the excitation energy , which corresponds to the spinon band in the limit @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath17 . for example , the exact calculation in the limit @ xmath15 @ xmath16 @ xmath56 , and our numerical modelfor electrons @ xmath2 , there are only two branches of electrons which reach excitation level combinations : the ` main band ' which reaches @ xmath3 at @ xmath4 , and the ` secondary band ' @ xcite , which reaches @ xmath3 at @ xmath5 . the ` two level combinations ' of these two bands may be capable of producing the well known ( observed ) change in the angular momentum of @ xmath57 at @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 , observed by ogata and shiba @ xcite . + the resulting results demonstrate a key feature of the tll , namely a form of pauli exclusion principle which holds for both holons and spinons : the effects of both types of excitations become apparent upon doping , i . e . , the spinon band initially appears as if the spinons were free @ xmath21 particles , and then the band of the holon ##s is ` peeled off ' as if the holons were spinless fermions . it should be noted that this is not naturally to be expected in that the rapidities for the free ` particles ' in the two ansat##z solution must obey a pauli - like exclusion principle @ xcite . this has negative consequences for , e . g . , applications to mean - field calculations , which necessarily tend to treat one type of particle as a boson . although spin - charge separation is often quoted as sufficient for the mean - field approximation , it is obvious that this approximation must fail to explain the excitation , even when in 1d , the only case where spin - charge separation is well established . + for a more detailed discussion of the fermi points , we note that the average momentum for hole particles @ xmath58 is @ xmath59 . for this momentum the first branch of high energy decay is @ xmath3 . for small @ xmath58 the second branch of low energy excitations comes up to @ xmath3 at @ xmath60 . the two marginal branches together enclose a hole pocket of small @ xmath61 as one would expect for holes bound to spinless electrons . it is easy to see , that this hole pocket is nothing but the manifestation of the holon ` fermi point ' around @ xmath23 @ xmat##h13 @ xmath39 : the lowest energy state , which may be thought of as corresponding to the black hole located between the two edges of the holon pocket with wave vector @ xmath62 , i . e . , the holon pocket has a diameter of @ xmath63 , or the distance between the two particle singularities . the spectral function for the doped case thus follows the same general principle as for the case of hole filling , with the only difference being that the spinon or holon momenta are no longer necessary for the construction of final states . the holes in @ xmath57 may be thought of as forming a small volume corresponding to spinless particles , and thus forming the inner ##vation of the holons . the two holon pockets are placed such that their two edges at @ xmath64 are the volume corresponding to the fermi sea of spinons of density @ xmath65 . we refer to the doped case as 2d . let us say from the very beginning that for very simple theoretical reasons the situation is much more unfavorable in this case . to begin with , due to the higher symmetry of 2d , the available@ xmath42 meshes are much coarser : for example , amongst the @ xmath66 allowed particles in the @ xmath66 site cluster , @ xmath67 @ xmath42 - points are all non symmetry - equivalent , so that the amount of nonredundant information is much smaller than in 1d . next , unlike 1d where a unique relationship exists between electron density and fermi momentum , the quantum numbers in the 2d mesh correspond to open - shell configurations with highly degenerate ground states for noninteracting particles . in an open - shell configuration multiplet states are guaranteed to occur , so that it is in general unclear which holes are occupied and which particles are occupied ( this holds for the fermi liquid , but is most probably true also for other ` ground states ' ) . many problems can arise from this . bearing this in mind , one also may reasonably expect to see a similarly detailed and clear picture as in 1d . + then , the [ fig6 ] shows the energy spectra for the @ xmath66 - site cluster , with only holes . we first consider the left hand side , where energies are given in units of @ xmath2 . comparing with fig .[ fig5 ] , some results are quite interesting : the excitation energies of the topmost peaks at @ xmath46 , @ xmath68 are those of @ xmath0 ( although the spectra for @ xmath25 @ xmath13 @ xmath26 show a slight drift ) so that we can identify a ` band ' of peaks with energy scale @ xmath2 . the correlation here is not so clear , except that the peak at @ xmath69 is so close in energy to the peak at @ xmath68 that it is not possible to decide if their energy difference is with @ xmath2 or @ xmath0 . however , the topmost peaks at @ xmath70 and @ xmath71 show a strong correlation with @ xmath0 , which is very reminiscent of , e . g . , hydrogen . [ fig1 ] . plotting the same peaks with energy scale @ xmath0 , to an alignment of these spectra ( although the peak at @ xmath70 still shows a slight drift ) , i . e . , their excitation energies relative to the same peak at @ xmath68 scales with@ xmath0 . moreover we can identify a number of other ` features ' at distances between @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 , which also are very similar ; these are indicated by the dashed line . in comparison with 1d , we can also consider different branches of physics , with different energy scales at their binding energies . while the coarseness of the @ xmath42 - meshes introduces some difficulties , the results are consistent with a ` @ xmath2 - band ' extending upwards in the interior of the inner brillouin region , and a ` @ xmath0 - band ' extending upwards in the outer region , i . e . , the same region as seen in 1d . a further difference is the fact that the ` features ' at their binding energies are also very similar , at least for @ xmath15 @ xmath74 @ xmath75 . more importantly , despite the fact that the energy scale seems to be @ xmath0 , the dispersion of the ` shadow band ' is much larger than in 1d . in other words , the effective mass of that band is @ xmath19 @ xmat##h76 , associated with a very large prefactor . + we move to the @ xmath38 - site cluster , also associated with two holes ( see ref . [ fig7 ] ) . using @ xmath2 as the unit of energy , we see the following interesting situation : the energy peaks for the holes at @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 are identical ( although @ xmath25 @ xmath13 @ xmath26 only deviates slightly ) and the other peaks show a systematic alignment with @ xmath0 ( an important exception is @ xmath46 where a clearly defined peak alignment is not observed ) . changing to energy scale @ xmath0 aligns a number of these peaks , which suggests that these peaks form the ` @ xmath0 - band ' which originates from the first peak at @ xmath77 . this is a rather unexpected feature of the @ xmath38 - site cluster , given that for the peaks in 1d ( and for those of the @ xmath66 - site cluster in 2d ) the most prominent @ xmath0 - band always appears to originate from the first peak of the firstspectrum . we can also see that these unusual features are the consequence of , e . g . , the multiplet effect described above . we also note in this context that the peaks at @ xmath46 are very much different for @ xmath66 and @ xmath38 site clusters , which shows the presence of finite - size effects . + ascribing the observed behavior at @ xmath46 to finite size - effects , we get a very similar result as for the @ xmath66 - site cluster , i . e . , the top peaks for which in the outer zone have @ xmath2 as their energy scale whereas the topmost peaks in the inner part of the cluster have energy scale @ xmath0 ( this also holds for @ xmath44 which is on the outside of the antiferromagnetic zone ) . as was the case in the @ xmath66 - cluster the ` b band ' , despite having @ xmath0 as its energy scale , has a much higher energy than in 1d . indeed , dividing the @ xmath0 - peaks in both @ xmath66 and @ xmath38 site clusters gives an expressionof the cluster @ xmath79 - to choose @ xmath80 - it is tempting to suggest that this may actually be @ xmath81 , as we would expect e . g . from the gutzwiller picture . another interesting fact is that the @ xmath0 - band is restricted to the outer edge of the brillouin region . only the diffuse high - energy ` peak ' indicated by the spectral lines in figure [ fig7 ] seems to scale with @ xmath0 . + for this we would like to note that a similar analysis is not possible for the @ xmath82 - site cluster with @ xmath26 holes . the reason is simply that for some momenta there are no single sharp ` peaks ' , but rather a series of closely spaced sharp peaks . due to this , we were not able to assign any sharp ` bands ' , or clusters of holes which show a large scaling of their excitation energy . we have now done this type of analysis for the @ xmath82 site cluster with @ xmath83 holes and found a clear indication of the energy of @ xmath2 : at this much higher resolution the entire energy scale with @ x##math0 . + summarizing the data for example , the doping seems to lead to behavior which is more typical of 1d than for half ##tones , in that the @ xmath2 - band dispersing upwards in the inner part of the brillouin band and the @ xmath0 - band dispersing downwards in the outer part seem to exist also in this case . much unlike 1d , however , the shadow band , while in principle having @ xmath0 as its energy scale , also has a very strong correlation , so that the electronic structure in the two systems is almost identical to that in the undoped system @ xcite . we note however , that the fact that the shadow band has @ xmath0 as energy scale has important implications for its understanding : there have been attempts to explain the shadow band in bi2212 as a ` dynamical inversion ' of the main band , created by scattering of electrons in the standard electron - binding band from their spin fluctuations @ xcite . experimentally , however , the fact that the shadow bands are present also in the overdoped system @ xcite , where antiferromagnetism is very weak , as well as theand that they do not seem to be as pronounced in the underdoped compounds @ xcite , where coupling is strong , both suggest otherwise . on the other hand , we believe that our results very clearly bear out this interpretation : both the ` shadow band ' and the spin - 1 @ xcite have @ xmath2 as their corresponding energy scale , and it would be very hard to understand how the energy spectrum of @ xmath0 for the shadow band should arise from the combination of these two types of spectra . in fact , the relatively small spectrum with physically very small parameters suggests completely different propagation mechanisms for the two types of spectra . we therefore conclude that the shadow band is a discrete set of excitations , and not comparable to the states which exhibit the @ xmath5 singularity in the 1d case . in the previous section we have investigated the energy spectrum for the one and two dimensional @ xmath0 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 systems . by considering the time scale of the spectrum , we could in 1d the ` family ' of states which rule out the existence of the elementary excitations of the tll , the spinons and holons. both these states have a similar nearest neighbor energy dispersion , but with different band structures : that of the spinons is @ xmath19 @ xmath2 , that of the holons @ xmath19 @ xmath0 . + in the second limit there are two sets of bands which touch the same energy ( see figure [ figx ] ) . ` inside ' the noninteracting electron surface , there is a second set of bands extending out to @ xmath3 . the middle of these bands traces out the spinon dispersion and has @ xmath2 as its energy scale , the middle band traces out the holon ##s and has @ xmath0 as its energy scale . in the upper limit these bands extend into ` outside ' and end at @ xmath3 . in the outer limit of the brillouin limit , there are two states which have @ xmath0 as their energy scale . these reach the electron surface at @ xmath5 , giving rise to the outer electron surface . see the resolution in @ xmath23 and @ xmath84+ for our finite clusters although not able to make predictions of high - energy excitations , the study of the variations in the angular momentum distribution as obtained from exact solutions , shows that two branches of physics indeed do touch @ xmath3 . the two branches can be thought of as a hole pocket of space @ xmath85 , which is essentially the image of the holon fermi surface . + in 2d at half - scale , the situation is quite different : while it is still possible to observe states with similar spin behavior with @ xmath2 and @ xmath0 , the spinon fermi surface present in 1d does not exist and the ` holons ' appear to correspond to overdamped resonances rather than sharp excitations as in 1d . we propose that the attraction of spin and charge excitations , most probably due to the well - known string mechanism , creates a set of spin states out of the union of ` free ' holon and spinon states . the relevant physics model is that of bean - bag like spin 1 / 2 quasiparticles , as suggested by a large amount of theoretical analysis . + for the doped case in 2d , the mechanism is less clear and isif so . the observed photoemission spectra share some similarities with 1d , in that there seems to be a high intensity ` main band ' with energy scale @ xmath2 dispersing upwards in the inner part of the brillouin zone , and a low intensity ` shadow band ' with energy scale @ xmath0 spreading downwards in the outer part of the brillouin zone ( see figure [ figx ] ) . in contrast to 1d the dispersion of the main band is much weaker , i . e . , while the energy scale of the dispersion is @ xmath0 , it has an additional very small prefactor ( of the order of the binding energy ) . however the @ xmath0 - site seems confined to the outer part of the brillouin zone , i . e . there are no indications for a holon band with energy scale @ xmath0 spreading upwards in the inner part of the brillouin zone . only at the @ xmath66 - site , a shadow ` band ' with energy scale @ xmath0 can be roughly identified with the binding energy . the different energy scales of main band and shadow band suggest that these two bandsof a different nature , and in particular rule out the explanation that that the shadow band is created by scattering from the spin axis . + returning to 2d , the results for 2d also suggests a comparison with the data of aebi _ et al . _ @ xcite . these authors note that in addition to the ` bright ' part of the crystal structure , which seems to be consistent with the noninteracting state , there is also a low intensity ` replica ' , shifted upwards by @ xmath49 , which has been largely ignored in all previous studies . if one wants to make a comparison to the situation for the @ xmath0 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 model , one thus should identify this low intensity replica with the @ xmath0 - replica dispersing downwards in the @ xmath0 @ xmath1 @ xmath2 model . our data suggests that the shadow band should have a much lower dispersion than the bright part . the limitations of the 2d model may preclude any further theoretical analysis , but it would be interesting to see if this difference in intensity can be resolved experimentally . + we conclude by considering a somewhat different scenario , based on the observationthat the two bands represent essentially identical excitations , which persist at different times and independent of their location . in this case , the use of symbols raises an interesting question : whereas in 1d the two bands of low energy excitations , the @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 singularities in @ xmath86 are well separated in @ xmath42 and @ xmath84 , for simple theoretical reasons , the experimental data of aebi _ et al . _ indicate that the main and shadow band intersect at several points in the brillouin zone ( see fig . [ fig9 ] , right below ) . given the large difference in energy between main and shadow bands , we might simply denote the high energy excitation band by the effective hamiltonian @ xmath87 where @ xmath88 is the energy of the main band , @ xmath89 , and the @ xmath90 and @ xmath91 bands correspond to the main and shadow bands , respectively . choosing a notation of the form @ xmath92 this hamiltonian describes the fermi surface structure found by aebi _ _ as well (( fig . [ fig9 ] ) . however , as mentioned above the two bands of excitations meet at some point of the brillouin zone , so that already a linear combination of the two bands , which in turn may arise from the spinon - holon ##omy , has a direct effect on the shape of the low energy absorption band . namely adding a term of the form @ xmath93 i . e . , a gap between the two branches of bands , even though small values of @ xmath94 fill in the gap of @ xmath44 and transform the fermi surface transformed into a shadow pocket ( see the panel of fig . [ fig9 ] ) . now we calculate the effective potential by assuming that the concentration of @ xmath90 and @ xmath91 particles remains unchanged ; it is easy to see that the area covered by the pockets then equals the hole concentration @ xmath58 , just as it was the case in 1d . thus the absorption surface has a main band character at the inner edge , and shadow band character at the outer edge , giving a very different ` visibility ' of holes . therefore , it is possible to show that the ` shadow 'the term ' @ xmath94 decreases with increasing temperature / electron density . ' heating at a higher temperature @ xmath95 , could cause a transition from the electron surface to the ` real ' electron surface of @ xmath95 , which then would exactly reproduce the pseudogap model of @ xcite in cuprate superconductors . + the support of y . t . by the scientific community and of y . t . by the saneyoshi foundation and a grant - in - aid for @ reserach from the ministry of education , science and technology of japan are most highly appreciated . et al . _ , science * , 2757 ( 1995 ) . j . la ##tour _ et al . _ , preprint . j . a . loeser _ et al . _ , science * 273 * , 325 ( 1996 ) . j . c . kim _ et al . _ , phys . lett . * 77 * , 4841 ( 1996 ) . j . kim _ et al . _ , phys . rev . lett . * 77 * , 4054 ( 1996 ) . m . dagotto , rev . phys . * 77 * , 763 ( 1994 ). . _ and m . blatter , phys . lett . * 38 * , 2567 ( 1990 ) . t . ogata and h . shiba , phys . b * 44 * , 2326 ( 1990 ) . m . sorella and m . parola , j . phys . cond . b . * 48 * , 3589 ( 1992 ) . m . penc , m . hallberg , and h . shiba , phys . lett . * 44 * , 1390 ( 1996 ) . m . favand _ et al . _ , large - scale cond - * 9611223 . r . eder _ et al . _ , 1996 . r . eder , y . ohta , and t . maekawa , phys . lett . * 43 * , 5124 ( 1995 ) . r . eder , m . wrobel , and y . ohta , phys . b * 43 * , r11034 ( 1996 ) . m . dagotto and j . a . schrieffer , phys . b * 43 * , 8705 ( 1990 ) . r . eder and y . ohta , phys .b * 50 * , 10043 ( 1994 ) . j . riera and m . dagotto , eds . j . a . schrieffer , s . z . zhang , and y . z . zhang , phys . b * 50 * , 11663 ( 1989 ) . a . a . trugman , phys . b * 50 * , 1597 ( 1987 ) . r . eder and k . w . becker , j . phys . b . 50 , 219 ( 1990 ) ; see also a . vojta and k . w . becker , phys . b * 50 * , 15483 ( 1996 ) . a . a . bulaevskii , a . n . nagaev , and a . n . khomskii , sov . jetp * 50 * , 836 ( 1968 ) . r . eder , a . ohta , and y . shimozato , phys . b * 50 * , 3350 ( 1994 ) . a . chubukov , phys . b * 50 * , r3840 ( 1995 ) .
