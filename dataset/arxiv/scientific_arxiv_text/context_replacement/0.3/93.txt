considered to be the direct origin of the jet - effects observed @ xcite and beta - decay at rhic ##1 @ xmath2 @ xmath3 , parton energy loss via self - radiation is expected to depend on the properties ( gluon charge and mass ) of the ` medium ' involved in the interaction and on the properties ( electron charge and mass ) of the ` probe ' parton @ xcite . light gluons would lose more energy than heavy nuclei due to the strong color coupling with the medium . in addition , charm and beauty quarks are qualitatively smaller probes with respect to hard partons , since their energy loss is expected to be larger , as a consequence of the mass - energy restriction in the phase - space into which gluon radiation can occur @ xcite . we study quenching effects for heavy nuclei by performing perturbative mass measurements of the observed @ xmath4 distributions with high - medium energy loss , obtained via the bdmps ##i effects . the corresponding weights , computed for light quarks and gluons in @ xcite and for heavy nuclei in @ xcite , depend on thetransport coefficient @ xmath5 , a function of the electron density , and of the in - plane path length . these values are averaged at a parton - to - parton ratio , giving a glauber - type mathematical description of the current @ xmath5 current in the radial direction @ xcite . the @ xmath5 value was calculated in order to calculate the heavy - flavor particles nuclear modification factor @ xmath6 measured at central frequency . @ xmath7 ( fig . [ fig : rhic ] , left ) : the value covered by the expression for the parton - type transport coefficient is @ xmath8 @ xmath9 . [ x = " < , ^ " , ] heavy - flavor energy transfer is also measured at rhic using measurements of the nuclear modification factor @ xmath10 of ` non - photonic ' ( @ xmath11 - conversion - and @ xmath12 - dalitz - conversion ) single electrons . the most detailed data for phenix @ xcite and alpha @ xcite , reaching out to 5 and 10 gev , respectively , are shown in fig . [ fig : rhic ] ( right ) . since this is an inclusive measurement, with charm decay dominating at low @ xmath4 and resonance decays dominating at high @ xmath4 , the comparison with mass - dependent energy level predictions should rely on a reliable and well - validated pp baseline . such data is still available at the moment , as we see in the following . the state - of - the - art perturbative predictions ( fonll ) , that we use at pp baseline , show that , in pp collisions , charm occurs in the electron @ xmath4 , up to about 5 gev @ xcite . however , there is a significant perturbative uncertainty on position of @ xmath4 of the @ xmath13 - decay / @ xmath14 - decay crossing point : depending on the choice of the energy and renormalization scales this uncertainty can range from 1 to 10 gev @ xcite . in addition , the uncertainty tends to underpredict the non - photonic electron density observed in pp collisions @ xcite . for our electron @ xmath10 results ( cf . [ 2 : rhic ] , below ) , in addition to the uncertainty on the medium density ( as for @ xmath8 , 10 , @ xmath##9 ) , we can account for the perturbative uncertainty by varying the values of the scales and of the @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 effective masses ( these lines correspond to the @ xmath15 ( ) @ xcite . we note that the nuclear mass factor of single electrons is about 0 . 2 larger than that of light - mass electrons . thus , electrons are in fact sensitive to the mass hierarchy of parton energy loss . the available data neither allow us to support claims of consistency between theory and experiment , nor do they support determining the expected mass hierarchy . it is important to note that , in principle , the perturbative uncertainty in determining the partonic mass ##s is comparable to the model - intrinsic uncertainty in determining @ xmath5 . if future experimental work by rhic succeeded in determining the charm and mass attributed to single electrons , the accuracy in the experimental - theoretical comparison would be greatly improved . ( left ) and @ xmath1 ( right ) , for the case of realistic heavy - quark models and for a model [ in which the quark mass hierarchy of parton energy loss is determined @ xcite , scaledwidth = 0 . 0 % ]the quarks will be observed with large cross sections at lhc energy and the detector will be equipped with detectors optimized for the detection of beauty and mass at vertices . thus , it should be possible to carry out a direct measurement of the mass of light - flavor hadrons , @ xmath0 particles , and @ xmath1 mesons . we calculate the corresponding nuclear modification factor @ xmath10 exploring a conservatively - large value of the medium required for the collisions . @ xmath16 : @ xmath17 . we apply the nlo perturbative methods for the @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 @ xmath4 - large cross sections @ xcite . the [ figure : lhc ] ( thick box ) shows our predictions for the heavy - to - light ratio of @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 mesons @ xcite , defined as the ratio of the nuclear modification factors of @ xmath18 , to that of light - flavor hadrons ( @ xmath19 ) : @ xmath20 . we estimate the effect of the ratio by artificially neglecting the mass dependence of parton numbers , ( light ##ness ) .the increase above that that persists in the @ xmath21 cases is probably due to the color - charge dependence of energy loss , since at lhc energy most of the light - flavor particles will escape from their light source . our calculations show that , for @ xmath0 particles , the mass effect is small and limited the to @ xmath22 , while for @ xmath1 mesons a large effect can be expected up to @ xmath23 . therefore , the comparison of the high - @ xmath4 and for @ xmath0 particles and for light - flavor hadrons will test the color - charge dependence ( proton parent vs . gluon parent ) of parton energy loss , while the comparison for @ xmath1 particles and for light - flavor particles will test the mass effect @ xcite .
