the unitary molecular gas is a basic many - body problem which describes the interacting states ranging from ultracold matter at a feshbach resonance @ xcite to dilute condensed matter . the properties in the dilute case are independent of the microscopic nature of the interaction states and share a common universal phase diagram . a universal critical point ( qcp ) at zero temperature governs the critical state of the whole phase diagram as a function of temperature @ xmath0 , interaction energy @ xmath7 , detuning from the feshbach resonance @ xmath8 , and magnetic field @ xmath9 @ xcite . whereas conventional qcps separate two components of the density , in our case the density itself is the universal minimum which holds for @ xmath10 and assumes a finite value for @ xmath11 @ xcite . in the quantum mechanical state @ xmath12 , and the universal @ xmath13 the fermi gas is unitary and scale ##less . in terms of the thermal length @ xmath14 the corresponding equation of state @ xmath15 is a continuous function which has been measured experimentally @ xcite . the unitary molecular gas is superfluid at the universal @ xmat##h16 @ xcite , see ref . [ ref : phase ] . in this work we focus on the quantum mechanical regime @ xmath17 above the qcp at @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 and @ xmath18 , where @ xmath19 is the coupling constant . since the thermal length @ xmath20 is comparable to the mean particle spacing @ xmath21 , quantum and classical effects are very different . this is a small parameter , and it is a theoretical challenge to determine the critical properties . recent measurements @ xcite and at @ xcite of the equation of state also go to the percent scale . however , the precise determination of critical properties is much more demanding . in order to reliably determine the coefficients we perform the calculations in a series - @ xmath5 and @ xcite . due to the lack of an intrinsic small parameter we introduce an intrinsic small parameter , @ xmath22 , which divides the different physical processes , including thermal processes , into orders of @ xmath22 . the original order is retained in the expansion @ xmath23 . one can perform these calculations , including all diagrams up to a certain point in @ xmath22 , and theseapproximations can be further improved by approximation to higher order . this approach is similar to the @ xmath24 expansion in the dimension of 2 . the advantage over perturbation theory is that it is valid only at weak interactions , and in contrast to quantum monte carlo it works directly in the classical limit and needs no sample size model . we can obtain similar results for the bulk entropy density @ xcite and the transport rate in the quantum critical region . the bulk viscosity @ xmath25 assumes a constant value at @ xmath18 . the kinetic theory @ xmath26 is given by the pressure @ xmath27 and the viscous relaxation time @ xmath28 , which is related to the thermal relaxation time of the gapless critical excitations above the qcp . the entropy density @ xmath29 at @ xmath18 is exactly proportional to the pressure , @ xmath30 , and the pressure to temperature ratio ( in @ xmath23 ) @ xmath31 is a real multiple _ _ of _ _ . the temperature independent ratio @ xmath4 has been found in the kinetic theories @ xcite and is known to hold at a constantcompare to experimental results @ xcite . strongly interacting quantum gases which saturate this bound are called large - @ xcite . among the non - equilibrium fluids the free fermi gas is close to the equilibrium and is also perfect @ xcite , but for graphene the viscosity decreases logarithmically with temperature in the quantum critical regime @ xcite . we compare our large - @ xmath5 results at @ xmath23 @ xcite with experimental results @ xcite and other experimental methods , including self - consistent luttinger - method @ xcite and bold diagrammatic monte carlo ( bdmc ) @ xcite . , see also [ ref : vals ] . . thermodynamic properties and mechanical properties of the unitary quantum gases in the quantum critical regime @ xmath18 , @ xmath17 : temperature @ xmath32 , pressure @ xmath27 , bulk density @ xmath33 , and bulk density @ xmath6 , and shear density @ xmath34 , with bulk gas @ xmath35 . large - @ xmath5 is similar to @ xmath23 . [ cols = " < ,< , < , < , < " , options = " , " , ] the good agreement between simulation and bdmc provides a useful reference to evaluate the accuracy of other calculations . we find very good agreement of the density @ xmath27 with large - @ xmath5 ( @ xmath36 above bdmc ) and luttinger - ward ( @ xmath37 above ) values , but just below the error bars , and we find similarly good agreement for the contact density @ xmath33 . from the bdmc equation of state calculation of @ xcite , we can obtain ( via the pair method ) a preliminary estimate for the contact density @ xcite @ xmath38 . our large - @ xmath5 value is just @ xmath39 below the bdmc value , which is good considering how simple the method is , and the luttinger - ward value is just @ xmath40 above the bdmc value , just below the error bars . compare estimates of the density @ xcite and @ xmath41 for the trapped gas at @ xmath18 ( @ xmath42 ) , which agrees well with the averaged density @ xcite . however , theof the trap averaged calculations does not allow us to reconstruct the equilibrium value for the homogeneous system , so we start from a direct calculation . dynamical and transport properties such as @ xmath2 are harder to compute than equilibrium values , which makes the approximations all the more difficult : we find that @ xmath2 reduces to @ xmath40 between the - @ xmath5 and luttinger - ward theory , giving a narrow approximation . the behavior of the unitary gas has been measured experimentally and agrees with trap averaged calculations @ xcite , but differs from the behavior of the homogeneous system . the rest of this article describes how these values are derived : in section [ sec : ufg ] we compare the renormalization group ( group ) theory of the unitary fermi gas and its associated phase diagram , in section [ sec : largen ] we compare thermodynamic and transport properties for the very large - @ xmath5 expansion , and in section [ sec : lw ] we compare the @ xmath18 data from the self - consistent luttinger - ward calculation , before proceeding in section [ sec : mw ] . in addition , in section [ app: . ] we give a simplified formulation of the tan adiabatic and kinetic equations and show that they are solved _ exactly _ by self - consistent luttinger - tan equations , the appendix [ app : boltz ] provides technical details on the effective field theory . the standard two - component fermi ##on is described by the equation @ xmath43 where @ xmath44 are grassmann variables for the particles @ xmath45 of critical temperature @ xmath46 , and the energy unit @ xmath47 is equal to the critical temperature @ xmath48 ( we use , where @ xmath49 ) . @ xmath50 is the effective potential of species @ xmath51 , so we can only consider the type - 1 particles @ xmath52 . in @ xmath53 , the scattering amplitude for small relative momenta @ xmath54 can be expressed in the form @ xcite @ xmath55 where the scattering amplitude @ xmath56 can be determined experimentally by an external electromagnetic field , and the effective energy @ xmath57 depends on the details of the interatomic interaction . by fine - tuning to the feshbach equation @ xmath58the single - particle scattering remains universal at finite energy @ xmath59 and at the unitarity limit @ xmath60 independent of @ xmath57 . the low - energy properties are universal at finite energy @ xmath61 if @ xmath57 is much shorter than the finite particle spacing @ xmath21 . this resonance @ xmath62 is valid both for a dilute plasma and for a broad feshbach plasma , the @ xmath63li @ xcite . the finite @ xmath57 describes the attractive interaction at long wavelengths ( uv ) , and for a finite momentum coupling @ xmath64 the detuning @ xmath8 is related to the bare interaction @ xmath65 in finite @ xmath66 note that the resonance @ xmath13 can only be reached for the finite @ xmath67 , when a transition energy of the interatomic interaction is below the continuum threshold . more precisely , this can be seen from an empirical analysis of the model : at constant temperature and pressure the electric current @ xmath68 obeys the _ energy _ flow equation @ xcite @ xmath69 which in @xmath70 has an unstable fixed point at @ xmath71 corresponding to the feshbach resonance . for smaller @ xmath72 the process will form a bec of fermion states ; for larger @ xmath73 the process proceeds toward the stable fixed point @ xmath74 of the free fermi gas ( bcs ##n ) . at the feshbach resonance fixed point the detuning @ xmath8 is a relevant perturbation with scaling dimension @ xmath75 = d - [ $ ] . the low temperature phase diagram exhibits a universal critical point at the feshbach resonance @ xmath13 , zero chemical potential @ xmath18 , and zero spin imbalance @ xmath12 , where the ` ` magnetic moment ' ' @ xmath9 corresponds to the change in chemical potential @ xmath76 . this critical point forms a universal phase diagram for finite @ xmath0 , @ xmath8 , @ xmath7 and @ xmath9 @ xcite . in this case we concentrate on the spin free state @ xmath12 and unitarity @ xmath13 : the phase diagram for finite @xmath0 and @ xmath7 are shown in red . [ fig : 1 ] . on the upper left for @ xmath77 there is a superfluid phase of fermion pairs , while the left part shows the normal fermi liquid phase at room temperature . the phase transition for @ xmath78 @ xcite is universal and always positive , in contrast to the corresponding phase transition for a normal bose gas @ xcite . on the left for @ xmath79 the fermi liquid crosses over to a dilute classical state . the line @ xmath1 , @ xmath10 has zero density ( vacuum ) . next we focus on the low - density and critical values @ xmath80 , and in the following we compute the thermodynamic and kinetic equations above for the critical value @ xmath18 . it is useful to use a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to describe the strong interaction . we introduce a pairing field @ xmath81 with a photon pair and then the non - fermi field @ xmath82 note that the pairing field @ xmath83 has a phase gap because @ xmath##67 is the feshbach action . the action has the same general behavior as the two - channel atom - particle model at the long - range critical point @ xcite . one can then proceed by working out the fermions to obtain an effective bosonic action for the magnetic field @ xmath83 . this action has bosonic vertices with any even value @ xmath84 of energy which are connected to a bare fermion loop with @ xmath84 field insertions . in contrast to the repulsive pairing action , where these vertices are irrelevant in the standard model , for the unitary pairing action these vertices still have marginal energy . already the particle - particle loop ( @ xmath85 ) , which contributes to the self - stabilization of the @ xmath83 field , reduces the bare scaling dimension @ xmath86 = [ / 2 $ ] of the @ xmath83 field to an equal contribution @ xmath87 to the bare scaling dimension @ xmath86 = ( [ + \ eta _ \ eta ) / 2 = 1 $ ] , which is independent of @ xmath88 ( for @ xmath70 ) . however , all thebosonic vertices @ xmath89 are singular for all external directions and time and scale changes in the ir flow . it takes no additional parameter to suppress these closed ground states , and they are _ a priori _ very important in the infrared ( ir ) . at zero density the @ xmath90 particle @ xmath91 functions are different from the @ xmath92 particle @ xmath91 functions in eq . , which is not exact . nevertheless , there may also be a three - particle resonance ( efimov effect ) in the three - particle @ xmath91 field depending on the mass , and whether the particles are electrons or bosons @ xcite . this changes the ground state from a two - particle to a three - particle bound state and leads to limit cycles in the ir flow @ xcite . at high density the higher bosonic vertices decay back into the self - energy of the @ xmath83 particles . in order to understand the relative importance of these higher vertices , one may use an additional expansion parameter such as the expression @ xmath93 for @ xmath70 @ xcite or @ xmath22 for @the number of fermion flavors @ xmath5 @ xcite . alternatively , we can perform a monte carlo simulation of an @ xcite . in this case we create a large - @ xmath5 flavor and compare it with the results from previous experiments . we obtain the bose - einstein action by creating @ xmath5 - flavors , or pairs , of @ xmath94 and @ xmath95 together , followed by @ xmath96 with @ xmath97 and the flavor of @ xmath98 . the flavor of @ xmath83 is used to create an @ xmath99 ##5 of same flavor , and we obtain the product @ xcite @ xmath100 this action is @ xmath101 invariant under changes in flavor p . the gaussian action of the electromagnetic field is the corresponding bosonic action @ xmath102 \ \ - \ frac { 1 } { n _ 1 } | \ phi | ^ { \ bigr \ } \ \ = n t \ sum _ { \ sum _ n } \ sum _ { { \ mathbfk } } \ bigl \ { \ sum _\ , \ ln t _ { - \ pi } ( k , \ omega _ m ) \ \ - \ mathcal t ^ { - 1 } ( k , \ omega _ m ) | \ sigma ( k , \ omega _ m ) | ^ \ + \ mathcal o ( | \ phi | ^ { \ geq 1 } ) \ bigr \ } \ hat { n } \ ] ] with the term running over the spin of @ xmath51 . the free particle propagator @ xmath103 is given by @ xmath104 with inverse @ xmath105 , and the bosonic propagator @ xmath106 is given by the inverse @ xmath0 - . in particular , @ xmath107 the number of particles @ xmath5 appears only as a single prefactor in the medium , hence a closed taylor series is needed @ xcite . each free fermion particle is a flavor of @ xmath5 , while the @ xmath83 propagator is suppressed by @ xmath22 . even though the higher bosonic vertices do have higher spin , their contributions to the effective action are not .or by means of @ xmath22 . for @ xmath108 the system is in the stationary state , and the system has a starting point at @ xmath109 . to read @ xmath110 the quantum potential is @ xmath111 so that this version of the @ xmath22 theory corresponding to @ xmath23 is called the nozires schmitt - type ( nsr ) theory @ xcite . the matsubara correlation function can be expressed up to the form , @ xmath112 \ \ - \ frac { 1 } { n } \ int _ { - \ infty } ^ \ infty \ frac { - \ nu } { \ nu } \ , [ ( \ nu ) \ , \ , ( 1 , \ omega , \ omega , \ nu ) \ bigr \ } \ end { n } \ ] ] with the correlation operator = @ xmath113 and the correlation = @ xmath114 ^ { - 1 } $ ] . as for @ xmath53 the @ xmath0 - matrix is ( in the n - 1 case @ xmath12 ) @xmath115 \ , . \ { { aligned } \ ] ] the integral is simple and is evaluated numerically . thus we obtain for the density @ xmath116 ( equation of state ) at @ xmath18 , @ xmath13 , @ xmath12 and @ xmath17 : @ xmath117 where @ xmath118 since the quantum number ##onic is gauge invariant the internal energy density @ xmath24 is proportional to the pressure @ xcite @ xmath119 . the energy density @ xmath120 at unitarity and @ xmath18 is proportional to the pressure , @ xmath121 the density at @ xmath18 to the @ xmath110 : @ xmath122 where @ xmath123 if this part of the @ xmath22 integral is evaluated at @ xmath23 ( nsr ) we obtain for the density @ xmath124 the ratio of wave amplitude to the wave spacing , @ xmath125 , is of order 2 , so quantum and thermal effects are equally important in the low - energy and thermal effects . the density of the fermitemperature @ xmath126 which is easy to compare with data given in terms of the reduced temperature @ xmath127 . , the total spectral energy is defined as the total molecular energy ( density ) of the electric field @ xcite @ xmath128 and @ xmath23 the result can be expressed in terms of @ xmath129 , and . which and @ xmath130 . this is equivalent to the non - self - inverse @ xmath0 ##3 of @ xcite and agrees with the bdmc result within @ xmath39 ( see figure [ 1 : vals ] ) , but it differs from the result within @ xcite by a factor of 2 . note that the first adiabatic theorem @ xcite @ xmath131 is fulfilled exactly by the @ xmath22 calculation : the change of the scattering with detuning is @ xmath132 because the change of scattering phase shift with detuning is @ xmath133 , and using eq . we obtain . at @ xmath134 the fermions are free : when the plane wave is emitted from the excited state it will continue forever , and the dynamic shear vis##cosity of @ xmath135 the drude weight is proportional to the pressure , in accordance with the viscosity selection of @ xcite . at order @ xmath22 the fermions have a self - energy tail with scattering and pairing effects , so for large @ xmath5 the fermions are almost always quasi - particles with lifetime @ xmath136 and the energy tail of the quasi - particle is @ xmath137 . in kinetic theory the effective mass becomes @ xmath138 with the same relaxation time @ xmath139 : the @ xmath140 term in is broadened to a function of width @ xmath22 and length @ xmath5 . note that the self - energy tail @ xmath141 @ xcite is not seen in kinetic theory @ xcite . in order to calculate transport functions for large @ xmath5 it is justified to use the following boltzmann equation @ xcite : ( i ) the particles propagate as free particles in space , subject to subleading time , ( ii ) the collision integral @ xmath142 contains the quasi - particle effect caused by themedium @ xmath0 - matrix @ xmath143 [ , . ] because electron - hole interaction occurs at higher orders , and ( 2 ) in addition to the scattering ( kinetic ) term there is a term of the scattering ( kinetic ) term @ xmath137 of the same order . however , this is only a subleading correction to the leading real term @ xmath144 ( see below ) and can be ignored . based on these equations we arrive at the following equation @ xcite @ xmath145 \ end { aligned } \ ] ] for the transfer function @ xmath146 , where @ xmath147 $ ] is the collision energy . for the bulk state we consider the velocity field @ xmath148 with a small velocity gradient @ xmath149 , and the shear equilibrium equation @ xmath150 with @ xmath151 . in the stationary state the shear equation is @ xcite @ xmath152 \ , . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] the velocity field induces a momentum current at @ xmath153 relative to @ xmath149 , with the coefficient ofconsider the equilibrium equation @ xmath34 . we replace the energy from the normal distribution , @ xmath154 with @ xmath155 and @ xmath156 , so that the equilibrium energy density is @ xmath157 this is equal to the pressure for free electrons ( @ xmath134 ) at room temperature , as can be seen by integrating by parts . we can also put @ xmath158 in and take advantage of the boltzmann equation by treating both sides with @ xmath159 . the left - hand side yields @ xmath160 . the right - hand side yields the above equation @ xcite @ xmath161 \ notag \ \ & = \ frac { t \ int \ frac { d ^ 3p } { ( 2 \ pi ) ^ 3 } \ , p _ y p _ x \ int \ frac { d ^ 3p _ 3 } { ( 2 \ pi ) ^ 3 } \ , \ int d \ omega \ , \ frac { d \ omega } { d \ omega } \ , | { \ mathbfv } -

matrix @ xmath170 in the same limit the center - of - mass term depends only on the relative momentum @ xmath54 , @ xmath171 . at the limit there is an additional dependence on the relative momentum @ xmath172 of the system @ xmath0 - matrix @ xmath173 . the angular momentum the momentum term is 0 . 2 @ xcite @ xmath174 the collision integral over is @ xmath175 \ end { aligned } \ ] ] with the @ xmath176 - wave angular average @ xmath177 over the momentum term is derived directly from appendix [ app : boltz ] ( the @ xmath88 - wave average @ xmath178 contributes only @ xmath179 to the energy ) . therefore , only collision integral over the spatial coordinates @ xmath172 and @ xmath54 have to be calculated . in the dilute gas phase the collision integral can be computed analytically , @ xmath180 with the @ xmath181 , and in the latter case the integral is @ xmath182 .the entropy is then given by @ xcite @ xmath183 in the high - temperature quantum critical regime @ xmath17 , @ xmath18 the volume integral has to be solved with the full medium @ xmath0 - matrix @ xmath184 from above . , which is solved with and at @ xmath185 and then with the solution of first order at @ xmath22 , @ xmath186 , we obtain in the quantum critical regime @ xmath187 this value is in @ xmath188 less than in the ideal gas limit , which is lower due to the reduced pressure , while the ratio of entropy density and the entropy density almost cancel each other in @ xmath189 . with the time - evolution @ xmath190 and the entropy density @ xmath191 we obtain the universal temperature to pressure ratio independent of temperature , @ xmath192 a related calculation of the viscosity of the medium @ xmath0 - matrix has been performed for large scale interaction @ xmath193 which found @ xmath194 for @ xmath18 ##3 @ xmath19##5 @ xcite , much larger than our value for @ xmath23 . note that we have calculated @ xmath34 using only a partial solution of the boltzmann equation , but is recently been shown that corrections to @ xmath34 from higher dimensions are greater than @ xmath196 @ xcite . a similar exact evaluation of the medium @ xmath0 - matrix in higher dimensions has been done recently @ xcite . the luttinger - ward functional provides a systematic way to obtain self - consistent and exact approximations , such that the green s functions satisfy the symmetries and conservation laws of the medium @ xcite . the luttinger - ward functional @ xmath197 $ ] can be expressed in terms of full fermionic generators @ xmath198 and full bosonic propagators @ xmath199 . the exact theory is provided by an extensive list of theoretical contributions to the @ xmath200 , which can only be used in diagrams , so typically one uses a subclass of diagrams . for the unitary fermi gas a more successful approximation is to use ladder diagrams with full fermionic green s functions @ xcite . then the system @xmath0 - matrix is given by an expression similar to that with full green s function , @ xmath201 since we are working in the low - temperature transition region we use instead the expression used in the gas phase . the luttinger - green equation then prescribes that the @ xmath94 fermionic p - energy is given by scattering a @ xmath95 fermion electron , as described by the expression @ xmath0 - matrix , @ xmath202 and solving for @ xmath203 . the dyson equation determines the full fermionic green s function @ xmath204 this system of equations is solved self - similarly by iteration @ xcite . the resulting green s functions in matsubara frequency can be used directly to obtain the spectral functions in real time , which show substantial effects near @ xmath205 and large excitations beyond the single single - peak peak @ xcite . similar effects are observed in the highly polarized state @ xcite . the potential @ xmath116 is derived from the grand potential @ xcite @ xmath206 - \ ln \ mathcal m ( k , \ int _( ) \ bigr \ } \ end { gathered } \ ] ] evaluated from the self - consistent fermion model and the full @ xmath0 - matrix . we derive the high - energy - critical behavior from the existing thermodynamic data @ xcite and at @ xmath18 . specifically , we make a cubic spline approximation of @ xmath207 and find the ratio of @ xmath208 to @ xmath209 , which implies @ xmath210 . furthermore , we find @ xmath211 , @ xmath212 , and @ xmath213 , which can be recast in terms of @ xmath20 . these values are given in table [ 1 : vals ] and are remarkably close to the above values . the surface viscosity @ xmath214 has been described in luttinger - ward theory as a function of temperature and pressure @ xcite : it has a lorentzian tail at high temperature , followed by a short tail @ xmath215 proportional to the electron density . we make a cubic spline approximation of @ xmath216 and find the ratioat @ xmath217 , which yields @ xmath218 . this value is much lower than the large - @ xmath5 value in . . . we note that in this self - consistent calculation the value of @ xmath219 was found at a somewhat lower temperature @ xmath220 @ xcite . the unitary fermi gas in the high - temperature quantum mechanical region is a challenging many - body problem . it is strongly interacting , with the density almost twice the non - interacting density of @ xmath18 @ xcite , and has no small scale relations . however , our large - @ xmath5 results in the first non - zero order for the free fermi gas are still very close to reliable experimental and theoretical results @ xcite . a key result of the original paper is that this is true even for the same system @ xmath2 once medium dimensions are included in the quantum kinetic ##s . a major reason for this close agreement is that large - @ xmath5 and luttinger - ward theory satisfy the tan adiabatic and scale relations exactly , as we see in appendix [ app : tan ] . in particular , luttinger - ward theories exactly satisfy the tanproperties of the unitary quantum system @ xcite . for a better comparison of calculations for the quantum system and trap it would be useful to make local measurements in the spirit of ref . @ xcite , for the contact and spin properties , since the comparison of the energy dependence is less due to the effects of the temperature dependence . a promising step in this direction is to directly observe atoms near the center of the trap in order to determine the contact properties from the measurements of the spin distribution @ xcite . i wish to thank lars fritz , subir sachdev , jrg schmalian , richard schmidt , and wilhelm zwerger for their work and peter ku , peter schfer , chris schmidt , flix werner , and peter zwierlein for developing their ideas . consider the fermionic case : a local measurement of the spin term , @ xmath221 , will lead to a change in the chemical potential @ xmath222 with the term running through space , time and possibly spin indices . however , this equation is easily neglected if approximations are made for the corresponding spin spectral function @ xmath223 . a key feature of these approximations , which are derived from the luttinger- ward functional @ xmath224 $ ] , is that eq . 2 exactly true for both @ xmath225 and @ xmath223 @ xcite . for the strongly interacting noble gas it is possible to start from the green - fermi action and write the luttinger - ward functional @ xmath197 $ ] in terms of the fermionic and bosonic green ##ian functions @ xcite . if a change of the microscopic parameters @ xmath226 and / or @ xmath227 induces a change of the grand function @ xcite @ xmath228 again , this exact equation continues to hold in the limit with the self - consistent equations @ xmath198 and @ xmath229 . we can also see that the tan ##tric formula @ xcite @ xmath230 and the kinetic energy formula @ xcite @ xmath231 are solutions of and therefore valid not only in the exact equation but in any conserving approximation , using the self - consistent @ xmath0 - matrix as described in section [ 2 : lw ] . the choice of detuning involves only the bosonic and##ratic term @ xmath232 in the case , @ xmath233 the energy of the grand potential is , @ xmath234 with the variation of mass given by the tan contact relation , @ xmath235 inserting into this equation the energy theorem . in order to obtain the energy formula we need a variation of mass , @ xmath236 . this is just the potential energy ( cf . ( 1 ) , @ xcite ) , but in our case the energy term @ xmath237 also depends on mass , which is the total internal energy @ xmath238 including the potential energy . specifically , @ xmath239 and with the momentum transfer term @ xmath240 we obtain the internal energy , @ xmath241 where the @ xmath54 integral corresponds to the momentum term @ xmath242 . the regularization term @ xmath243 can be written as @ xmath244 , and we arrive at the energy formula . in a similar way the tan contact relation has been derived in the luttinger - rosen theory as an energy scale transformation on the grand potential @ xcite . this is our theorythat the above conditions are satisfied results in the self - consistent @ xmath0 - 1 approximation . a special property of @ xmath53 ##9 is that the angular averages of the two parameters can be calculated directly . we can write the distribution of the ##ons associated with @ xmath169 and @ xmath245 [ 1 - f ( \ varepsilon _ { { \ mathbfq } / 2 - { \ mathbfk } ' } ) ] \ \ = \ frac { 1 } { f ( \ dots { a } + \ begin { bx } ) ( \ dots { a } + \ dots { bx ' } ) } \ dots { 1 } \ ] ] with @ xmath246 , @ xmath247 and @ xmath248 , @ xmath249 . the angular averages of the three values of the parameters @ xmath250 , @ xmath251 and @ xmath252 is then @ xmath253 [ 1 - f ] \ \ = \ frac { 1 ^ 2 } { f } \ bigl ( f _ { \ alpha = 1 } ^ 2 (( , - ) - - _ { \ nu = 2 } ^ { ( q , r ) \ bigr ) \ end { gathered } \ ] ] where we have calculated the @ xmath176 - wave average sum of the correlation coefficient @ xmath254 with legendre transform @ xmath255 . the @ xmath33 - wave average is given by @ xmath256 } { \ { [ ( a - b ) / 2 ] } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] . the @ xmath88 - wave average can be expressed in terms of polylogarithms @ xmath257 , @ xmath258 . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] therefore , all the integration can be done directly and only the two angular sums over @ xmath172 and @ xmath54 in g . need to be performed directly .
