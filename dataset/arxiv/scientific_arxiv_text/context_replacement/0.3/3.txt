the transport properties of complex non - linear nonlinear systems are far from well - understood @ xcite . consider in particular so - called ratchet systems which are essentially periodic systems where an ensemble of particles undergo directed transport @ xcite . the origins of the interest in this lie in considerations about extracting experimental work from such noisy fluctuations as known to occur in chaotic systems @ xcite . recently attention has been focused on the study of deterministic chaotic systems @ xcite as well as hamiltonian systems @ xcite . chaotic systems are defined as those which are sensitively dependent on initial conditions . whether chaotic or not , the behavior of nonlinear systems in the transition from regular to chaotic behavior is in general sensitively dependent on the structure of the system . that is , the phase - space structure is often quite complex , consisting of stable islands embedded in chaotic seas , for example , or of multiple co - existing islands . this can change significantly as parameters change . for example , stability islands may merge into each other , or break apart , and the chaotic sea itself may be pinched , or shape changes , or it may break symmetry or bifurcate . this means that the transport properties can change dramatically as well . a few years ago, mateos @ xcite proposed a specific system associated with a periodically forced underdamped particle . he looked at an ensemble of particles , calculated the velocity for the particles , averaged over time and the resulting ensemble . he showed that this quantity , which is an extremely simple function of ` the current ' , could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude @ xmath0 of the periodic forcing for the particle . at the same time , there exist systems of @ xmath0 where the trajectory of an individual particle exhibits chaotic behavior . mateos found a connection between these two systems , specifically that the reversal of current dynamics was correlated with the change from chaotic to periodic forcing in the trajectory dynamics . even though it is unlikely that such a model would be completely valid for such chaotic ##al systems , it would still be extremely useful to have general heuristic ##s such as this . these general ##izations would allow some # ##ability of the many different types of dynamics that are possible in such systems . a later proof @ xcite of the mateos conjecture by barbi and colleagues , however , argued that this was not a valid result even for the particular system considered by mateos . they found results showing that it was possible tohave current reversals in the absence of transition from periodic to chaotic states . they suggested an alternative origin for the current reversal , since it was related to the local transport properties of the rotating periodic orbits of the system . these latter results are quite different . however , this paper bases its arguments about currents on the behavior of a _ single _ state system compared to an ensemble . this paper suggests that the dynamics of the system is ergodic . this is not true in general for chaotic systems of the type being considered . in particular , there may be extreme dependence of the result on the dynamics of the system being considered . this has been pointed out in the paper @ xcite which laid out a detailed methodology for studying transport properties in such a mixed regular and chaotic system . depending on the parameter ##ization , the chaotic system under consideration has multiple possible chaotic or regular states or a mixture of both . it is hence appropriate to understand how a chaotic ensemble might behave in such a system . the details of the dependence on the parameters are also relevant to the question of the exact experimental validation of these results , since experiments are always conducted , by means of finite - precision , over finite time and in space . it is therefore interesting to probe the possibility of barbiand , with regard to the details of the transport rule , and more formally , to show how ergodicity affects our considerations about the current , as we do in this paper . we report on our findings on the behavior of the current in a chaotic deterministic system , or the transport system as considered by mateos @ xcite and barbi and sanchez @ xcite . we consider the impact of different types of ensembles of particles on the current and show that the current depends only on the details of the initial conditions . we also show that it is necessary to consider transients in quantifying the current . this is one of the important messages of this paper : phase fluctuations are rare in chaotic systems , and hence it is important to understand the time - dependence in any study of the transport rule of chaotic ratchets . having established this , we then proceed to discuss the relationship between the phase fluctuations for the current and the behavior of the current . we find that while we agree with some of the details of barbi and salerno ##s results , the broader conclusion still holds . that is , it is still possible to study phase fluctuations in the absence of changes from chaos to chaos ##ity as well .but without any net current reversals . the result of our investigation is therefore that the transport properties of the chaotic ratchet are not as important as the initial conditions . however , we can find solutions for a modified version of mateos s equation . that is , in general , solutions for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter tend to be associated with abrupt changes in the current . depending on the specific direction of the current , these abrupt changes may cause the net current to change direction , but not necessarily so . we start off with a preparatory section trying to understand the problem of the connection between bifurcations and current reversal , where we discuss the dynamics and phase - space for single trajectories for this system , where we can define a bifurcation diagram for this system . in the next section , we discuss the problem of finding the connection between the dynamics of the systems and of currents . from this , we are able to compare details of specific trajectory bifurcation ##s with current reversal , and thus with our broader discussion above , from which we continue . the goal of these studies is to understand the behavior of the chaotic ratchets . the approach taken here is that to find heuristic rules we can considerspecific considerations in more detail need explanation . we use the term @ xmath1 - dimensional as considered previously by mateos @ xcite , as well as barbi and others @ xcite . we consider an ensemble of particles moving in an elliptic periodic potential , driven by a small time - dependent net force , where the force has a large time - dependence . there is no shock in the system , so it is completely stable , although there is noise . the equations of motion for an elliptic trajectory for such a system are given in dimensionless form : @ xmath2 where the periodic asymmetric potential can be written in the form @ xmath3 + \ frac { 1 } { 4 } \ { [ [ \ pi ( 1 - x _ 0 ) ] \ bigg ] . \ ] ] in this equation @ xmath4 have been introduced for systems such that one potential minimum exists at the origin with @ xmath5 and the term @ xmath6 . ( a ) classical phase space for the periodic potential . for @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 , two potential attractors emerge with @ xmath9 ( b ) @ xmath##10 ( 1 ) and a period 1 attractor consisting of the four centers of the sphere with @ xmath11 . , title = " fig : " , n = 302 ] the phase - space of the undamped undriven ratchet the space corresponding to the action potential @ xmath12 looks like a kind of a pendula . that is , individual trajectories have one of two possible non - asymptotic properties : ( i ) inside the two wells , orbits and all their properties change , leading to corresponding net transport . outside the wells , the orbits either ( ii ) move to the right or ( iii ) to the left , with corresponding net transport depending upon the conditions . there are also ( iv ) restrictions on the size of the stable and librating orbits , moving between the fixed points in constant time , as well as the stable and stable fixed points themselves , both of which form a space of finite measure . when this is introduced via the @ xmath13 - dependent term in fig . [ eq : dyn ] , it makes the stable fixed points the onlyattractors for the particles . when the driving is turned off , the phase - space becomes chaotic with the usual pattern of intertwining separatrices and resulting homoclinic loops . the dynamics of individual particles in such a system are often very complex in nature and depend heavily on the choice of time and initial conditions . we see snapshots of the dynamics of this kind of problem in the set of poincar sections fig . ( [ figure1 ] b , c ) together with a period - four orbit represented by the center of the circles . a simple representation of the dynamics of the problem as a function of the parameter ( @ xmath14 or @ xmath15 ) emerges from the bifurcation diagram . this can be constructed in several different and somewhat equivalent ways . the relatively standard method that we use is as follows : first choose the bifurcation parameter ( let us say @ xmath0 ) and correspondingly choose the values of @ xmath16 , and end with a corresponding value for @ xmath17 . then iterate the initial conditions , recording the value of the particle at time @ xmath18 at time @ xmath19 from an integrated model ( here we record@ xmath20 . this is observed stroboscopically at discrete times @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 and @ xmath23 form an interval @ xmath24 with @ xmath25 the total number of observations observed . of these , take observations at times other than the cut - off time @ xmath26 and plot the remaining points against @ xmath27 . it should be noted that some transient behavior is necessary to get observations which are independent of the condition , and we shall discuss this further , in the context of the net current or potential . if the system is a one - point orbit then all of the points lie at a particular location @ xmath28 . a periodic orbit with period @ xmath29 ( that is , with periods associated with the period ) shows , with @ xmath30 points occupying times @ xmath31 and locations of @ xmath32 for @ xmath27 . all periodic orbits , including periodic orbits of finite periods occur in a simply - connected or simply - connected finite collection of points . for the next time @ xmath33 , the maximum computed value of @ xmath34then @ xmath35 are used as initial conditions , and finally , results are obtained at infinity and so on until @ xmath36 . that is , the following diagram is generated by taking the relevant parameter , in this case @ xmath0 , from @ xmath27 to some value of @ xmath37 . this diagram is used to represent all coexisting attractors of the system with the specified energy range . note that several initial conditions are being used troughout the system , and the given diagram is not the result of a single experiment . we have created several plots , as a result , with different initial conditions and the results below are summarized . we have given examples of this kind of bifurcation ##s below , where they are being compared with the observed behavior of the system . having broadly understood the wide range of behavior for individual particles in this system , we will turn in the next section to a discussion of the non - equilibrium properties of a statistical ensemble of these trajectories , specifically the current for an ensemble . the current @ xmath38 for an ensemble of the system is defined in an analogous manner by mateos @ xcite as the time - derivative of the average .over an ensemble of initial conditions . that is , an average over several initial conditions is performed for a given observation time @ xmath39 to yield the average velocity over the time @ xmath40 this average velocity is then also time - independent ; using the observation time @ xmath39 for , this leads to the second equation @ xmath41 where @ xmath25 is the number of time - observations made . for this to be a relevant parameter to compare with bifurcation ##s , @ xmath38 should be independent of the time @ xmath42 but still strongly dependent on @ xmath43 . a second strong parameter that is being used in the definition above is the size and location of the ensemble being sampled . that is , the transport properties of the ensemble in a chaotic system depend in part on the part of the state - space being sampled . it is therefore necessary to consider many different initial conditions to generate a model . the most straightforward example we show in fig . ( [ figure2 ] ) is that in the case of chaotic systems , a single trajectory often has properties very different from that of many others . however , it turns out that in the chaotic case , it is possible to use thethe trajectory to get essentially the same result is obtained from the above . now consider the bifurcation shown in fig . ( [ figure3 ] ) where we consider the phase ensemble resulting from varying the number of points in the phase ensemble . thus , the convergence is greatly improved as a result of @ xmath0 for the @ xmath44 . even more important is the fact that the smaller trajectory data ( @ xmath45 ) may contain current points that do not exist in the larger @ xmath44 data . current @ xmath38 versus the set of trajectories @ xmath44 for @ xmath7 ; liquid lines correspond to a regular motion with @ xmath46 while solid lines correspond to a chaotic motion with @ xmath47 . note that a single trajectory is sufficient for a chaotic motion . the convergence in the general case is only achieved if the @ xmath44 exceeds a certain value , @ xmath48 . , title = " time : " , n = 302 ] current @ xmath38 versus @ xmath0 for both sets of trajectories @ xmath44 ; @ xmath45 ( 1 ) , @xmath49 ( square ) and @ xmath50 ( dashed line ) . note that a single trajectory exists in the stable regime where all the curves converge . in the chaotic regime , as @ xmath44 increases , the curves converge towards the next one . , [ = " ] : " , [ = 302 ] however , note that single - trajectory stable values are typically much higher than chaotic values . this follows from the fact that a carefully chosen ensemble has configurations with idiosyncratic currents which can average out . as our result , with these ensembles we see about @ xmath51 for example , where barbi and salerno have shown about @ xmath52 and greater . however , it is also obvious that only a few configurations dominate the ensemble completely , else there would not be a distribution of the current as a function of @ xmath44 . all this is illustrated in fig . ( [ figure3 ] ) . we note that the * / * drift of an ensemble can be a lot closer to @ xmath53 than the behavior of an individual configuration . it should also be noted that there is a dependence of the drift on the behavior of the initial configuration , this is particularly .for small @ xmath44 , of course . the location is defined by its width @ xmath54 . for @ xmath45 , it is trivially shown that the local location corresponds to the absolute value of the time - averaged velocity , given that this is a non - linear and chaotic process . further , considering a periodic ensemble , however , the width of the region also affects the details of the state , and can show , for example , a phase transition , as shown in fig . ( [ current - bifur1 ] , [ current - bifur2 ] ) for example . note also that in fig . ( [ current - bifur1 ] ) , small @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 , the deviations between the two states are particularly large . these points are analogous to bifurcation points where some sort of symmetry breaking is clearly visible , which puts our emphasis on the relevance of specifying these points in the description of unstable states . however , why these specific bifurcations should stand out among all the states in the energy spectrum , is not entirely clear . to see how to incorporate this information into description of the current , we, consider the fact that if we look at the local phase space for the hamiltonian or underdamped @ xmath57 system , we see the general structure of stable systems embedded in a chaotic sea which exhibit quite similar behavior @ xcite . in such a situation , the dynamics only depends on the location of the initial conditions . however , we are interested in the hamiltonian situation when the damping is dependent . in this case , the phase - space is in collections of attractors . that is , if the ##s are discarded , the current is not likely to depend significantly on the location of the initial conditions or on the spread of the initial ensemble . in contrast , in the regular regime of a non - hamiltonian system , the initial state needs to be chosen less than a certain size to achieve convergence . however , in the regular regime , it is not important to have a small ensemble and a random trajectory can converge , as long as we have time to discard the transients . that is to say , in the case of networks , the distribution of the current needs to be modified to : @ xmath58 where @ xmath59 is an empirically obtained trade - off such that we have a converged current ( for instance , in ourcalculations , we have converged ( with @ xmath60 ) . when this new method is used , the convergence ( non - convergence ) is more pronounced as a function of @ xmath61 and the values of the intial parameters . armed with this background , we are now now in a position to compare these diagrams with the current , which we do in the next section . our results are shown in the series of images fig . ( [ figure5 ] ) fig . ( [ rev - nobifur ] ) , in each of which we present both the ensemble current and the current diagram as a function of the parameters @ xmath0 . the main point of these numerical results can be distilled into a series of mathematical statements which we state below ; these are written with roman letters . for @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 , we plot current ( upper ) with @ xmath62 and bifurcation ##s ( lower ) versus @ xmath0 . note that there is a * and * current , while there are two * reversed in the same frequency range . , title = " source : " , id = 302 ] , fig . ( [ figure##5 ] ) , which shows the approximate range @ xmath63 varies relatively arbitrarily . in this example , we see several period - doubling bifurcations corresponding to 1 - 2 transitions , such as for example , the approximate range @ xmath64 . however , there is only one instance of current - doubling , at @ xmath65 . note , however , that the current is not without structure and changes fairly dramatically as a function of parameter . this fact is made even more clear in fig . ( [ figure6 ] ) where the current remains consistently above @ xmath53 , and hence there are in fact , no current reversals at all . note also , however , that the current has some structure , even while remaining negative . for @ xmath66 and @ xmath8 , note the current ( upper ) and lower ##s ( lower ) versus @ xmath0 with @ xmath62 . , the current remains consistently below @ xmath53 . , title = " [ : " , period = 302 ] current and lower versus @ xmath0 . in ( a ) and ( b ) we see ensemble dynamics , specifically in ( a ) the black hole .for an ensemble of trajectories starting from at the stable fixed point @ xmath67 with a root - mean - square of width of @ xmath68 , and the blue line for trajectories starting from the stable fixed point @ xmath69 and of width @ xmath68 . in ( b ) , all ensembles are centered at the stable fixed point , the blue line for an ensemble of width @ xmath68 , with a width of @ xmath70 and black with width @ xmath71 . ( c ) is the state of the ensemble @ xmath38 without transients ( black ) and with transient ( white ) and with the non - ensemble results in blue ( see barbi and brown ) . the initial points for the ensembles are centered at @ xmath67 with a mean square of gaussian of width @ xmath68 . ( d ) is the corresponding phase diagram . , title = " fig : " , width = 302 ] it is possible to do two versions of this with different assumptions , leading to the negative conclusion , therefore , that * ( i ) not all bifurcations lead to current* * . therefore , we are looking for positive particles , and at this point we have not reached the more general statement that all current particles are associated with states , which results in the mateos conjecture . we then can move onto comparing our results against the previous results of barbi and salerno in solution of this problem . in particular , we look at their results . ( 2 , 3a , 3b ) , where they use the parameter s @ xmath72 . the distinction between their results and ours is that we are studying _ ensembles _ of particles , and are studying the distribution of these results as a function of number of particles @ xmath44 , the size of the ensemble in 3 - space , as well as the ##s @ xmath73 . our data with larger @ xmath44 yield similar results in general , as we show in the recomputed versions of these figures , shown here in bold . ( [ current - bifur1 ] , [ current - bifur2 ] ) . specifically , ( a ) the single - particle results are , not surprisingly , cleaner and can be more easily interpreted as examples of transitions in the behavior of the physical properties of the periodic ensemble .the ensemble results on the other hand , even when converged , show considerable roughness . ( b ) the ensemble results are consistent with barbi and salerno in general , although disagreeing in some details . for instance , ( c ) the bifurcation at @ xmath74 has a much gentler effect on the ensemble current , which has been stable for a time , while the single - trajectory result changes little . note , ( d ) the very interesting fact that the single - trajectory result completely ignores the current - associated spikes at @ xmath75 . furthermore , ( e ) the barbi and gallo discussion of the distribution of the current in the region @ xmath76 is found to be flawed our results are consistent with theirs , however , the individual spikes are found to be associated with spikes despite their statements to the contrary . on the other hand ( f ) , the ensemble result shows a pattern [ - ref . ( [ ) - bifur2 ] ) , at @ xmath77 of current reversal that does not appear to be associated with bifurcations . in this case , the current abruptly drops below @ xmath53 and then rises above it again . the single trajectory result .for this side effect , as can be seen . the bifurcation diagram indicates that in this case the important events occurred either before or after the transition . all of this adds up to two statements : the first is a consequence of the fact that there is some information about the ensemble current that can not be obtained from the non - ensemble current . the second is that the heuristic that follows from this is also a logical conclusion , that * ( iii ) _ all current transitions are associated with bifurcations . * where does this leave us in the search for ` interesting ' results , that is , useful information ? one possible way of testing the mateos hypothesis is to weaken it , i . e . force it into the case that * ( iii ) _ all _ current transitions are associated with bifurcations . * same as above . ( [ . - bifur1 ] ) . for the case of @ xmath0 [ . , range = " fig : " , range = 302 ] for @ xmath78 and @ xmath8 , there is transition ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @ xmath0 with @ xmath62 . * in thein this figure that eyeball effect can be misleading . we see reversals without jumps in ( a ) whereas the second figure ( b ) shows that there are examples of normal and chaotic behavior . this is further evidence that spikes in the graph correspond in general to jumps . , title = " fig : " , width = 302 ] for @ xmath7 and @ xmath79 , graph ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @ xmath0 . , title = " fig : " , width = 302 ] finally , a * * * rule of thumb , previously not known , emerges from our work . this generalizes mateos conjecture to say that * ( lower ) bifurcations correspond to sudden current changes ( spikes or jumps ) * . note that this means these changes in current are not necessarily changes of direction . if this current change or spike goes through zero , this corresponds with a direction reversal , making the mateos conjecture a special case . the theoretical basis of this argument is the fact that ensembles of _ in _ between _ can _ have a directed behavior . the details of this behavior depend very sensitively on the system parameters . this # ##ization is greatly reduced when the bifur##cation transition , when the dynamics of the current two - phase system is a mass to mass - doubling transition , for example , or one from chaos to regular behavior . from the above figures , we see that this is a very good rule of thumb . for example , it also explains the behaviour of fig . ( [ figure6 ] ) which could not be understood as being an application of the mateos conjecture , or even a proof thereof . as such , this rule significantly enhances our ability to characterize changes in the behavior of the current as a function of parameter . a good example of where this fundamental conjecture leads us is by looking for a complete negation of the mateos conjecture , that is , an example where we expect to see current - reversal without disorder , as in fig . ( [ figure - bifur ] ) . the current - changes in that region of phase space seem to be in the chaotic regime and are independent of bifurcation . however , this turns out to be a ` hidden ' because when we look in to the chaotic regime , we see only periodic windows . this is also consistent with our assumption that sudden current changes are associated with bifurcations . study of the transition from regular behavior to chaos and chaos is afor the current to flow . however , in not all such cases can these corresponding bifurcations be found . we can see an example of this in fig . ( [ rev - nobifur ] ) . the current is expected to flow smoothly . @ xmath80 with seemingly no corresponding problem , even when we do a statistical analysis on the data , as in fig . ( [ rev - bifur ] ) . however , arguably , although subjective , this result is close to the # ##s . this result , that there are cases where the parameters simply do not seem to work , are part of the open problems dealing with this problem , of course . we note , however , that we have shown that these same assumptions hold when we vary the parameters as well ( but not only here ) . in particular , in this paper we have taken the view that it is useful to use general rules of thumb ( even if not universally valid ) to understand the chaotic nature of non - linear nonlinear statistical control systems . in the case of chaotic deterministic ratchets , we have shown that it is important to factor in factors of size , shape , spread , and time when computing the ` noise ' due to the event before wesupport for these rules , and that the dependence of ensemble parameters is only true at the bifurcation point . we have also argued that the following heuristic ##s hold : bifurcations in single - particle behavior usually correspond to sudden spikes or jumps in the parameters for an ensemble in the same state . current reversals are a special case of this . however , not all spikes or jumps correspond to a bifurcation , nor vice versa . the open question is how to figure out if the reason for when these rules are false or are true can be made more concrete . a . k . p . t . barsch and kamal p . singh for further discussions , the reimar lst , and financial support from the alexander von humboldt foundation in berlin . a . k . p . is grateful to carleton college for the ` anderson , wallin , and winter of 1949 ' research fellowships , and to the mpipks for hosting him for a sabbatical year , which led to this paper . further discussions with j . - h . rost on these results are also available . p . hnggi and bartussek , the nonlinear physics of complex systems , lecture notes in physics vol . 476 , edited by m . parisi , s. a . mueller , and a . zimmermann ( springer verlag , berlin , 1996 ) , pp . 294 - 308 ; a . a . asturmian , e * 276 * , 917 ( 1997 ) ; a . jlicher , a . ajdari , and a . prost , j . math . phys . * 54 * , 1269 ( 1997 ) ; a . dring , nuovo cimento e * 66 * , 685 ( 1995 ) s . flach , a . schmidt , and y . zolotaryuk , phys . rev . lett . * 54 * , 2358 ( 2000 ) ; v . schmidt , s . flach , y . zolotaryuk , and v . v . ovchinnikov , europhys . lett . * 54 * , 141 ( 2001 ) ; a . denisov et al . , * 54 * , 041104 ( 2002 )
