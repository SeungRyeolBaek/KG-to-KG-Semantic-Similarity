as the number of agn discovered by _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ increases , it is becoming clear that the vast majority is looking for a narrow ( discovered by _ xmm _ ) line at @ xmath1 1 . 4 kev , due to emission from metallic elements ; recent studies describing these lines include gondoin ( 2003 ; ngc 3227 ) , brown ( 2003 ; mrk 896 ) , brown ( 2003 ; mrk 766 ) , petrucci ( 2002 ; mrk 841 ) , brown ( 2002 ; ngc 3516 ) , obrien ( 2001 ; mrk 359 ) , brown ( 2001 ; mrk 205 ) and many others . in a number of cases ( e . g . , ngc 3783 kaspi 2002 ; ngc 5548 yaqoob 2001 ) the lines have not been detected yet _ , with fwhm = typically @ xmath5 5000 ##0 = @ xmath6 . _ the @ xmath0 line was first identified as a common line in _ ginga _ ( pounds 1990 ; nandra & singh 1994 ) ; studies by _ asca _ tend to show relatively narrow lines , although re - examination of some ofthe data indicates that the line _ may _ be narrower than originally thought ( lubinski & zdziarski 2001 ) . there is some disagreement over these results , however , with yaqoob ( 2002 ) suggesting that the _ asca _ parameter changes have a negligible effect on the line profile . very few such lines have been observed in _ xmm _ data to date , examples being mcg @ xmath76 @ xmath730 @ xmath715 ( reeves 2002 ) , mrk 205 ( reeves 2001 ) and mrk 509 ( pounds 2001 ) . however , not all these line profiles are the same , with mcg @ xmath76 @ xmath730 @ xmath715 having a strongly asymmetric profile , possibly due to the strong gravitational forces and high temperature in the # ##most region . mrk 205 , however , is more well - explained by the relativistic disc - rotating effect if the disc is strongly rotating , since the observed emission is r @ xmath1 ##1 . 5 kev . this is not the only possible source , as pounds ( 2001 ) discuss : the emission could be from a singledistribution of clouds , other than the inner accretion disc ; or , the broad line may simply consist of a blend of different , distinct lines . the broad line in mrk 509 is also not unique . the narrow emission lines observed by _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ are interpreted as low k fluorescence from dark ( diffuse ) clouds originating from the inner accretion disc . candidates for the origin of the broad line include the outer molecular cloud , the broad line region ( blr ) and the very outer - most regions of the scattered cloud . the baldwin line is well known for ir / uv emission lines , with baldwin ( 1977 ) first finding that the brightness of the c iv ( @ xmath8 = 1549 ) has decreased with increasing uv radiation . since then , significant anti - correlations have been found between the luminosity and certain other lines , such as [ x , # ##x , c iii ] , c ii and ly @ xmath0 ( e . g . , tytler & smith 1992 ; zamorani 1992 ; smith , forster & kuraszkiewicz 2001 ; smith 2002 ) , although the nature of these interactions is still unclear . it shouldbeing aware that , although the baldwin effect is generally accepted to be an anti - correlation between equivalent magnitude and brightness , green ( 2001 ) claim that ew is actually more strongly correlated with magnitude than luminosity for their data . however , croom ( 2002 ) found that , for 13 of the 14 lines observed , the stronger correlation is with absolute magnitude rather than redshift . iwasawa & taniguchi ( 1993 ) reported an x - ray baldwin effect in the # ##rmi lines found in _ ginga _ observations of agn . they reported a similar correlation for their seyfert lines , but were unable to conclude that this holds for qsos , due to poor data ; there is also a baldwin effect for the broad w lines found in _ asca _ observations ( nandra 1997 ) . these w lines are thought to be produced by rotation of the accretion disc itself . nandra suggests , based on an earlier observation ( nandra 1995 ) , that this baldwin effect is due to the presence of highly colored skin on the outer surface , with the degree of color increasing with rotation ; see also nayakshin ( 2000a , b ) . nandra ( 1997 ) also find that thenarrow line core drops in size as the distance increases , but conclude that the entire baldwin effect in their data can be attributed to the narrow line alone . in this paper we show , and attempt to explain , a baldwin effect for the 3 fe ##r @ xmath0 lines measured in _ xmm _ data , for a sample of the seyfert galaxies and qsos . this sample consists of six type i agn ( table [ 1 ] ) , these are essentially a combination of our own published data and the data obtained from the online _ xmm _ data archive . a literature search has identified four additional objects for which the original data has been lost ( ngc 5506 vaughan 2001 ; ngc 3516 turner 2002 ; 1h 0707 @ xmath7495 boller 2002 ; ton s180 vaughan 2002 and turner 2003 , private papers ) . . the type i agn are in this table , ordered by redshift in the radio - quiet and radio - loud range . the limits were calculated for the 210 kev rest frame and 90 per cent lower / upper limits were calculated for the rest - frame equivalent ##s . @ xmath9 - 1 seyfert galaxies ##h ; @ xmath##10 broad line seyfert variable galaxies ; @ xmath11 qsos [ cols = " < , < , < , < , < " , ] . [ x - lum ] plots the de - dark ew against the de - dark 210 kev luminosity . it can easily be seen that there is a change in the sr as the light approaches the ` x - ray baldwin effect ' . the asurv ( advanced data vector ; feigelson & smith 1985 ) method can be used in the analysis of sr ( upper limit ) data . this allows the spearman rank ( sr ) method to be applied to the sr dataset , and gives an anti - correlation between the sr and luminosity of @ xmath4 99 . 99 per cent ( @ xmath1 98 . 99 per cent if the upper limits are used ) . due to selection effects , luminosity and sr are not strongly correlated , as shown in figure [ lum - z ] . therefore , it is very difficult to determine whether the change in sr is with z or sr . using the simple spearman rank , a strong correlation ( 99 per cent ; 79 .5 per ( if the upper limits are used ) was found between the line length and the distance . an alternative method for checking is the partial spearman rank , which gives an indication as to which of the two methods is stronger . in this case , agreeing with the partial spearman rank , the ew - h correlation appears to be the dominant relationship . weighted linear regression can be used to find the slope of the best - fit line to the log - log value of ew against , that is , the power - law fit . this was performed using two different methods . firstly the upper limit measurements were completely removed ; this yielded a value of @ xmath70 . 17 @ xmath12 0 . 08 . the second method used the linear regression method of asurv ; although upper limit measurements are accounted for , this method does not include the errors on the actual data . in this method , the slope is very similar , with a value of @ xmath70 . 17 @ xmath12 0 . 04 . in a further attempt to determine whether the overall effect could be attributed to gravity , the objects with higher redshifts were completely removed from the sample . it was found , however , that , not only thoseagn at z @ xmath5 0 . 08 , there also was an inverse relationship between ew and rr which was equal in magnitude ( as of 0 . 08 @ xmath12 0 . 08 using asurv ) with that observed for the complete sample . this implies that the difference in line brightness is not a frequency - dependent effect . there is a further complication in that the higher luminosity agn tend to be radio - quiet , since the average x - ray emission from radio - quiet agn is about three times lower than that from radio - loud ones ( zamorani 1981 ; worrall 1987 ) . the main worry , however , is that the emission is very loud at the highest frequencies because of dilution and scattering effects . however , as fig . [ 2 - lum ] shows , there are lower - luminosity radio - loud agn in this sample which have corresponding lower values . similarly , pb 5062 and pg 1634 + 706 radio - quiet agn with luminosities of @ xmath1 10 @ xmath13 erg s @ xmath6 have corresponding upper values of 10 @ xmath563 ev for their mass . however , the anti - correlation effect is not simply due to radiation . to show the beaming effect more clearly , figure [ bins ] was created . this shows the average ew for a number of luminosity spectra considering all the objects ( top plot ) and just the radio - quiet objects ( bottom ) . in both plots , the decrease in value is small . to create figure [ bins ] , upper limits were taken to be half of the value , together with an equally sized index bar ; a slight decrease in value is also seen if the upper limits are ignored , although the energy range used is larger . figure [ ew - 1 ] plots the values against the power - law values measured over the 210 kev rest - frame absorption band . since flatter slopes are often assumed to be indicative of reflection , it might be expected that they would lead to shorter spectral lines ( since the fluorescence effect may come about from reflection processes ) , although the 210 kev band is not very sensitive to reflection processes . however , this is clearly not the case ; if anything , there is a slight shift in the opposite direction , with some of the higher slopes having the highest ews . as for the otherof the thin fe k @ xmath0 line between the normal iron line and the blr ; these properties will be discussed in the following section , describing both the nature of the line , and possible explanations for the x - ray trapping effect . yaqoob ( 2001 ) derived the following equation for the ew of the narrow line in agn , for low light intensity : @ xmath14 @ xmath15 where e @ xmath16 is the energy of the free electron ( 0 . 5 kev for neutral fe ) and e @ xmath17 the effective energy of the line , expressed in units of kev . a @ xmath18 is the fraction of the area covered by blr clouds ; a @ xmath19 , the amount of iron exposed to sun , where 0 . 68 @ xmath20 10 @ xmath21 is the solar value ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) ; n @ xmath22 , the effective size of the line ; @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 , the fluorescence yield ( = 0 . 5 for neutral fe ) . based on this particular blr model , yaqoob showed that the strength of the fe k@ xmath0 ##2 in ngc 5548 is likely to be too large to come directly from the blr ; the observed ew is 36 ev , whereas the measured value is almost three times larger , at 133 ev . they suggest that these differences could be caused by a decline in the continuum level shortly after the observation ; in this case , the line would not have enough time to respond to the smaller continuum level and , so , would appear too large . given the explantion for ngc 5548 , if the blr model is correct , the reason why most of the lines in the [ objects ] have relatively high ew values compared to those predicted by the above equation must be determined . it must also be determined whether a variation in the spectrum could explain the observed ew - k differences . the observed k line is produced by a different physical process ( fluoresence ) from the optical / uv k lines ( photoionisation ) . however , variations in scale factor and abundance , for example , can be reflected in the blr optical / uv spectrum , so it is briefly discussed whether such variations exist . one possibility is that the mass fraction of the blr clouds is systematically underestimated in the above formula and increases with increasing lumin##osity . there is no experimental evidence for very high blr band thickness , however , and the measured values of ir / uv ratio can be reproduced in high precision ( within factor of 1 ) . for the agn measurements shown here , no correlation is found between the ew of the w spectral line and those of civ @ xmath81549 and ly @ xmath0 ( values taken from wang , lu & li 1998 and constantin & constantin 2003 ) . similarly , no correlation is found with the h @ xmath25 / civ ratio , which can be interpreted as a color index , or with the h @ xmath25 fwhm ( taken from dewangan 2002 ; kaspi 2000 ) or both ( marziani 2003 ; v ' eron - cetty , v ' eron & gonalves 2001 ) ; this is shown in figure [ hbetafwhm ] . h @ xmath25 the fluxes for the h @ xmath25 / civ ratio are taken from marziani ( 2003 ) , cruz - gonz ' alez ( 1994 ) and mulchaey ( 1994 ) . measuring the strength of the correlation relation is difficult , as itoptical / uv spectra have different slopes . for example , using the same formula given in this article , croom ( 2002 ) find a slope for the civ line , determined by the blr , of h @ xmath2 l @ xmath26 . they also use h @ xmath2 l @ xmath27 for the ciii ] [ ( ciii ] , aliii and siiii ] ) . green ( 2002 ) find a range of baldwin relation values for the two lines , ranging between @ xmath1 @ xmath70 . 5 and + 0 . 02 , for example @ xmath28 = 65 km s @ xmath6 mpc @ xmath6 and @ xmath29 = 0 . they mention that using the baldwin relation of 0 . 02 increases the slope by @ xmath5 1 per cent . green et al . ( 2001 ) find a different slope , using h @ xmath28 = 50 km s @ xmath6 mpc @ xmath6 and @ xmath29 = 0 . the first impression in the optical / uv spectrum of a correlation between the values of the baldwin relation and the l2 , or a change in the average continuum shape with luminosity or redshift ( depending which is the correlation found in that particular study ) . it is possible that the x - ray absorption effect described here is produced by a slight variation in the shape of the continuum illuminating the surrounding material , although one might expect then to see some correlations with the observed emission / absorption lines . the description of properties of the agn in this study over - laps with those described by dietrich ( 2002 ) . upon comparison of all the data with those with log @ xmath8l @ xmath30 ( 1450 ) @ xmath4 ##l , they find no difference in the slope of the linear relation for the two objects , and the fact that qsos tend to have higher log @ xmath31 / log @ xmath32 ratios than seyfert galaxies is not likely to be an important factor . thus it could be argued that the iron abundance has been measured and correlated with iron . predicting the trend of metallicity in agn is difficult since their evolutionary history is not known very well . blr metallicities appear to be extra - stellar , but comparison of blr ##s with detailed photoion##isation models suggest that blr metallicity will increase with age ( e . g . , hamann & ferland 1993 ; shemmer & netzer 2002 ) . this is oppposite to the trend , if the x - ray baldwin effect is to be replaced by an abundance effect . obtaining the observed spectra from spectral line measurements is made difficult due to the absorption effect of fe ii ( which is the dominant component ) . for the present example , there is no correlation between the strength of the x - ray fe k @ xmath0 line and the observed fe ii absorption at @ xmath84590 ( figure [ feii ] ; fe ii ews from marziani 2003 ) . the predicted absorption is linearly dependent on column density in the above model , but yaqoob et al . ( 2001 ) show that the approximations are only valid for n @ xmath22 @ xmath5 3 . 5 @ xmath20 6 @ xmath33 @ xmath23 ( i . e . , an fe ii absorption optical depth of greater than 1 ) . although some blr models predict higher column densities ( e . g . , radovich & rafane##lli 1994 ; recondo - gonzalez 1997 ) , and @ xmath34 @ xmath23 are considered ` normal ' . the blr velocities are of the order 5000 km s @ xmath6 , which is resolvable by _ chandra _ . to date , the angular width of the narrow iron lines has only been measured a few times , and the results are not entirely clear . kaspi ( 2002 ) measured the line profile of ngc 3783 with the _ chandra _ high ion - mass spectrometer ( hetgs ) , finding a fwhm velocity of @ xmath1 1700 km s @ xmath6 , which is unusual for a blr but consistent with originating from the outer regions of the galaxy . similarly , smith ( 2000 ) found ##s fwhm velocity of 1800 @ xmath12 200 km s @ xmath6 for the nickel - iron @ xmath0 line profile in ngc 4151 . the width of the iron lines in [UNK] @ xmath76 @ xmath730 @ xmath715 has also been measured with the hetgs . the situation is complicated by the presence of the two principal directions of the line .this is , both resolved and unresolved , narrow and broad . however , lee ( 2002 ) obtain a value of 11 000 @ xmath35 km s @ xmath6 for the very narrow component when measuring the full spectrum ; this corresponds to 3600 @ xmath36 km s @ xmath6 for the ` high ' flux state . despite the errors , these measurements are consistent with a fwhm of @ xmath1 6000 km s @ xmath6 , which would indicate that the line is not formed in the disk . yaqoob ( 2001 ) give a fwhm of @ xmath1 4500 km s @ xmath6 for ngc 5548 , which also supports an origin in the blr . it should be noted that , although the measurements are very highly accurate , and indicate an origin in either the galactic blr or disk , there are very few grating ##s of the line , and it is unclear how narrow the galactic disk itself is . an alternative explanation is that the ` narrow ' line may not have formed in the galactic disk itself . nayakshin ( 2000a , b ) explain how a baldwin line could be formed by the expansion of the size ofthe latter , as the luminosity increases . a recent study by yaqoob et al . ( 2003 ) suggests that such narrow lines may originate from a star which is tilted edge - on and has a different emissivity profile . similar suggestions have been made for optical / infrared blr lines . however , as mentioned above , no difference is found directly between the narrow line mean ew and the h @ xmath25 emission . there is no difference between the blrs found in narrow iron and narrow line seyfert . the nls1s have much narrower emission lines , hence their name . it has been also noted that nls1s tend to show weaker h @ xmath25 emission ( e . g . , brown 1985 ) and this was confirmed upon comparing the h @ xmath25 ew of samples of nls1s and bls1s ( taken from marziani 2003 ) student - t - test gave a very high correlation of the two lines originating in the same population , with the nls1s having a much larger mean ew . for the few samples from the same sample , this difference in line length was also significant . when comparing the sample k @ xmath0 ##5, however , there is no appreciable difference between the narrow - and broad - line flux , produced both by the x - band and asurv ( to account for the upper limit ) . possible support for the scattered disc origin lies in the variability of the narrow lines in mrk 841 ( petrucci 2002 ) . they found that the line varies between two observations separated by several hours , although , within the interval , the change in line flux is not large . such a rapid change is hard to detect if the line is produced by the reprocessing matter , indicating the origin might be closer to the central star ; the line flux is now known to be @ xmath5 - 1 . to date , mrk 841 is the only object in which this line has been observed . overall , while the blr is a possible explanation for some of the observed iron lines , we are unable to explain how the blr alone could produce the many observed iron lines nor why the baldwin line should exist . in particular , it is unclear why the more luminous objects should have fairly normal blrs compared to the lower - mass objects , as judged from their visible / infrared blr lines , which have a detectable < 0 .4 kev iron k . krolik , madau & . zycki ( 1994 ) discuss the nature of the # k @ xmath0 line in the galaxy . they note that for a high optical depth , @ xmath37 , of 0 . 51 , the ew of the line should be of the order 100 ev , for an unobscured view ; for @ xmath37 = 2 , this value nearly doubles , to 100 ev . they also note a slight decrease in energy for the opening angle of the column . the value of @ xmath1 100 ev , for a low optical depth , is , as they point out , in good agreement with the values measured in other seyfert type galaxies , suggesting that the # ##k @ xmath0 emission line could be due solely to absorption / emission from the gas and not linked to the accretion disc or blr at all . ghisellini , haardt & smith ( 1994 ) also mention that the torus could produce an emission line of 1 @ xmath1 90 ev , if the gas density was @ xmath38 10 @ xmath39 @ xmath23 . this should benote that both of these studies use a value of 4 . 68 @ xmath20 10 @ xmath21 for the relative abundance of hydrogen , rather than the 4 . 68 @ xmath20 10 @ xmath21 used by yaqoob ( 2000 ) . since the temperature scales linearly with the pressure , the results from krolik ( 1994 ) and ghisellini ( 1994 ) should be scaled to @ xmath1 141 or @ xmath1 127 ev , respectively , to correspond to yaqoob s ##nr . as mentioned above , the existence of a neutral reflection component would imply the existence of cool , compton scattering material ( guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & wilson 1988 ; george & wilson 1991 ) , such as the torus . some of the objects here show evidence for such material , although the properties are still poorly understood . this is not entirely surprising however , since most of the objects are at very low energies , and that the rest absorption bands described by _ xmm _ do not extend much above @ xmath1 141 kev , and the neutral reflection component is expected to peak at 3050 kev ; reflection components may not be present in the present universe , butthat is not to say that they do not exist . _ if _ , however , these lines are not found in the sample , this does not necessarily rule out the sample as the source of the narrow line . alternatively , the surface of the torus could be very thin ; if this were the case , no strong reflection field would be produced . matt , guainazzi & maiolino ( 2003 ) show that , for a compton thin torus with l @ xmath22 = l @ xmath20 10 @ xmath33 @ xmath23 , a thin iron line with n @ xmath1 1 % would be produced . this is , therefore , a good model for detection of the narrow line . knigl & kartje ( 1994 ) discuss a simple disc - driven hydromagnetic field model for the torus , showing that , if l @ xmath40 @ xmath38 ##1 . 5 @ xmath20 10 @ xmath41 ( l / 10 @ xmath42 ) erg 2 @ xmath6 , where l @ xmath40 is the 2100 @ xmath43 long infrared wavelength , then the resulting pressure field could be expected toflatten the dust grains ; this causes the opening angle of the torus to decrease , leading to a reduction in the covering factor . this led to krolik ( 1994 ) , who found that the size of the fe k @ xmath0 line increases slightly with increasing opening angle . in this case , an increase in luminosity and subsequent decrease in covering factor could lead to a large galaxy . this model is similar to that done by mushotzky & ferland ( 1984 ) , who used a luminosity - dependent structure factor and , therefore , covering factor to explain the observed kerr effect . an alternative explanation , proposed by ohsuga & umemura ( 2001 ) , is that relatively low - luminous agn are more likely to form dusty walls of gas , supported by radiation pressure from a circumnuclear starburst ; the stronger radiation pressure from the more luminous agn would prevent these from forming . if the x - ray kerr effect is , however , supported by a decrease in the covering factor of the torus , then this has implications for the formation of type - ia qsos . many seyfert 2 galaxies are known , but very few such qsos have yet been discovered ( see. g . , derry 2003 and ( therein ) . a time - dependent decrease that the covering factor provides goes some way towards preventing the formation of high quality obscured sources , although obscuration should still arise due to mergers and the formation of the qsos . there is an apparent x - ray baldwin effect for the narrow , weak spectral line observed in many agn : as the 210 kev rest frame luminosity increases , the effective width of the line decreases . the reason for this correlation is unknown , but one possibility is a decline in the covering factor of the surrounding molecular clouds as the luminosity decreases . this decline in covering fraction could be due to increased gas pressure in the cloud , leading to an increased viewing angle and , hence , increased covering fraction . although the blr is a possibility for the origin of some of the narrow lines , it is difficult to explain how the strongest lines could be formed , or what it is that contributes to the baldwin effect . the observed correlation between strength of the line and the width of the line is not solely due to the shielding effect or beaming in the radio - loud sources , since the effect is also observed in the radio - quiet sources themselves . given theresolution of these and the _ chandra _ hetgs , it is not yet possible to figure out the origin of the radiation from either the blr ##s or the off dark matter ( i . e . , the photon ) . future observations with ground - based x - ray detectors ( such as the x - ray detector on - board _ astro - e2 _ , or _ xeus _ ) will provide sufficient spatial resolution , of the order a few hundred km s @ xmath6 , to be able to resolve this issue . the work in this paper is based on observations with _ xmm - 1 _ , an esa funded mission , with instruments and data also funded by esa and nasa . the authors would like to thank the esa team for supporting their work during the design phase , and the soc and ssc team for making the discovery and publication possible . this research has made use of the nasa / ipac infrared telescope ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administation . contributions from a pparc studentship was acknowledged by klp . anders e . , grevesse a . , 1989 , geochim . act##a , 197 , 197 williams j . c . , 1977 , apj , 214 , 679 blustin j . m . , branduardi -
