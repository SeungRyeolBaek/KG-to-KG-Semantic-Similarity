the so - called ` ` nucleon spin problem ' ' raised by the european physics collaboration ( emc ) measurement in 1988 is one of the most outstanding developments in the history of particle physics @ xcite , @ xcite . the development of the field of high energy deep compton scattering is greatly related to this epoch - making finding . however , one of the most important developments made recently in this field of physics is the discovery and the deeper understanding of completely new observables called generalized parton distribution functions ( gpd ) . it has been revealed that the gpds , which can be obtained through the so - called deep - virtual compton scatterings ( dvcs ) or the deep - virtual meson productions ( dvmp ) , contain surprisingly richer information than the classical parton distribution functions @ xcite @ xcite . roughly speaking , the gpds are generalization of the parton distributions and the generalized scale factors of the particles . the gpds in the most general case are composed of three kinematical variables : the average longitudinal momentum parameter @ xmath1 of the original parton in the initial and final states , the skewdness parameter @ xmath3 which measures the angle betweentwo momentum transfer , and the two - momentum - th square @ xmath4 of the initial and final states . in the forward limit @ xmath5 , some of the gpds reduce to the usual spin , proton and neutron distributions . on the other hand , from the @ xmath0 - th moment of the gpds with respect to the square @ xmath1 , one gets the generalizations of the electromagnetic form factors of the electron , which are called the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon . the complex nature of the gpds , i . e . the fact that they are functions of one another , makes it very difficult to grasp their full meaning both physically and theoretically . from the theoretical perspective , it may be practical to begin studies with the two special cases . the one is the forward limit of zero momentum transfer . we have shown that , in this limit , some of the gpds reduce to the usual parton distribution , depending on one variable @ xmath1 . however , it turns out that , even in this limit , there appear two completely different wave functions , which can not be accessed by the ordinary inclusive deep - inelastic scattering method . very ., it was shown by ji that each of these distributions provides the information on the total angular momentum contributed by the quark fields in the spin @ xcite @ xcite . this information , combined with the magnetic properties of the longitudinal quark ##s , makes it possible to determine the total total angular momentum contribution to the total nucleon field purely directly . two relatively - easy - to - handle quantities are the generalized form factors of the spin @ xcite , @ xcite , which are given as the pull - apart nucleon matrix elements of the spin - @ xmath0 , twist - two , and spin operators . since these two quantities are given as the spin matrix elements of these operators , they can be part of lattice qcd simulations . ( these should be replaced with parton distributions . the direct calculation of parton distributions is beyond the scope of lattice quantum simulations , since it has to consider the nucleon matrix elements of quark bilinears , which are _ nonlocal _ z _ . ) in fact , two groups , the lhpc , and the qcdsf , independently measured the generalized form factors of the distributions , and made some interesting predictions , whichwill in principle be confirmed by the measurement of gpds in the near future @ xcite @ xcite . although possible , there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe that the predictions of these lattice simulations are accurate enough . the reason is mainly that the above mentioned lattice simulation were carried out in the heavy pion regime around @ xmath6 with one of the so - called bell diagrams . our real world is rather close to the chiral limit with heavy pion mass , and we know that , in this limit , the heavy nucleus plays very important roles in the intrinsic properties of the nucleon . the lattice simulation carried out in the heavy pion regime is in danger of losing the important properties of chiral ##ity . on the other hand , the chiral - soliton model ( cqsm ) is an effective model of lattice , which also incorporates the chiral ##ity of qcd and its spontaneous extensions @ xcite , @ xcite . ( see @ xcite @ xcite for recent reviews . ) it is already applied to the physics of the parton distribution , with remarkable results @ xcite @ xcite . for example , the important role of proton - like quark - like##quark correlation was found to be necessary to understand the famous nmc measurement , which revealed the superiority of the @ xmath7 - proton over the @ xmath8 - proton and the proton @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite . then , it would be possible to determine what predictions the cqsm would give for the quantities mentioned above . however , the main aim of the present study is to study the generalized form factors of the proton in the scheme of the cqsm and compare these predictions with those of the lattice quantum simulations . of our main interest here is to determine the consistency of the theoretical calculations against the predictions of the proton mass . such an analysis is necessary to provide a basis for evaluating the reliability of the lattice qcd calculations at the present time for the observables in question . the scope of the study is as follows . in sect . ii , we shall briefly explain how to introduce the nonzero proton mass into the scheme of the cqsm with pauli - villars regularization . in sect . iii , we present the mathematical models for the generalized form factors of the proton . sect . iv is devoted to the discussion of the results of the lattice simulations .the concluding results are then given in sect . 2 . we start with the total effective lagrangian of the chiral spin soliton , in the chiral state given by @ xmath9 with @ xmath10 which describes the effective quark mass , with a dynamically invariant term @ xmath11 , and interacting with pions @ xcite , @ xcite . since one of the main purposes of the present paper is to see how the physical observables depend on these interactions , we add to @ xmath12 an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term @ xmath13 given by @ xcite @ xmath14 . \ { { eq : lsb } \ ] ] . the term in ( [ x : lsb ] ) has to be taken with respect to the change . the total effective lagrangian is therefore given by @ xmath15 naturally , one could have taken an alternative choice in which the explicit chiral - symmetry - breaking term is introduced in the form of a quark mass term in @ xmath16 . we could not do so , because we do not have a consistent combination of the effective lagrangian with the effective quark massin the context of the levy - villars ##ian theorem , is described in terms of @ xcite . the canonical action corresponding to the classical lagrangian is defined as @ xmath17 = s _ m [ u ] + s _ n [ u ] , \ label { { : energsol } \ ] ] with @ xmath18 = - \ , - \ , m _ 2 \ , \ mbox { sp } \ , \ ln ( \ \ , \ ! \ partial - [ \ ^ { \ pi _ 2 } ) , \ ] ] and @ xmath19 = \ int \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ , f _ { \ pi } ^ 2 \ , f _ { \ pi } ^ 2 \ , \ mbox { tr } _ 2 \ , [ f ( x ) + \ ^ { \ pi } ( x ) - 1 ] \ , \ ^ { 2 . \ ] ] . @ xmath20 with @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 are the values of the - delta function and the operators ( isospins ) , respectively . the real ( real ) side of the above equation is the -violet errors . to remove these errors , we must introduce new parameters . for the purpose of regularization , first we apply the taylor - villars selection rule . as explained in @ xcite , we must eliminate not only the violet error contained in @ xmath23 $ ] but also the linear and logarithmic errors contained in the equation of motion described below . to get rid of all these violet errors , we introduce at least two subtraction factors . the wave action is thus defined as @ xmath24 = s _ f ^ { reg } [ u ] + s _ f [ u ] , \ ] ] where @ xmath25 = s _ f [ u ] - \ sum _ { i = 1 } ^ 2 \ , s _ i \ , s _ f ^ { \ sum _ i } [ u ] . \ ] ] . @ xmath26 is derived from @ xmath27 $ ] with @ xmath11 replaced by the taylor - villars regulator in @ xmath28 . these parameters are calculated as follows . similarly , the ##ratic and violet errors contained in the equation of motion( as in the case of the vacuum quark condensate ) and , respectively , removed if the two constants satisfy the following two conditions : @ xmath29 ( we see that the condition which removes the [ value of @ xmath23 $ ] just agrees with the 1st of the above conditions . ) by solving the above equations for @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 , we obtain @ xmath32 which removes the values of @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 , since @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 are known . for determining @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 , we need two equations @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 which amounts to both the correct value of the proton kinetic energy in the effective mass lagrangian and to the correct value of the proton kinetic energy . to obtain the equations of state , we must first write down a mathematical expression for the static soliton field . using the hedgehog ansatz @ xmath37 for the static magnetic field , it is written in the form : @ xmath##38 = e _ m ^ { reg } [ f ( r ) ] + e _ m [ f ( r ) ] , \ ] ] where the proton ( pion ) part is given by @ xmath39 = - \ , f _ { \ pi } ^ 2 \ , f _ { \ pi } ^ 2 \ int x ^ { - \ , [ \ , f ( r ) - \ ] , \ ] ] and the neutron ( quark ) part is given by @ xmath40 = e _ { val } + e _ { - \ } ^ { reg } , \ label { q : estatic } \ ] ] with @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 being the two single - particle states , separated by the eigenvalues of the corresponding vacuum hamiltonian in the set of states : @ xmath43 with @ xmath44 , \ label { q : dirach } \ ] ] while @ xmath45 has the dependence of the vacuum hamiltonian given by ( [ q : dirach ] ) with @ xmath46 ( = @ xmath47 ) . the final state @ xmath48, which is a lower steady - state , coming from the lowest energy level under the influence of the hedgehog mean value , also called the energy level . the term @ xmath49 $ ( [ x : regenerg ] ) is the summation over all the positive energy eigenstates of @ xmath50 , i . e . the negative part is delta . the soliton equation of motion is obtained from the steady state of @ xmath51 $ ] with respect to the derivative of the wave function @ xmath52 : @ xmath53 \ nonumber \ \ & = & = \ , \ ^ 2 \ , \ , \ { - \ , } \ , [ s ( r ) \ sin f ( r ) - s ( r ) \ sin f ( r ) ] + f _ { \ pi } ^ 2 f _ { \ pi } ^ 2 \ sin f ( r ) \ right \ } , \ , { - } \ ] ] which yields @ xmath54 here @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 are regularized real and pseudoscalar probability distributions associated by @ xmath57 with @ xmath58 and @xmath59 and @ xmath60 are the energy densities , with the regulator mass @ xmath28 instead of the associated regulator mass @ xmath11 . we also note that @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 . as such , the self - consistency energy profile is calculated as follows with use of kahana and ripka - discretized energy profiles @ xcite , @ xcite . first , using the same ( though different ) energy profile @ xmath52 , the energy problem of the dirac hamiltonian is solved . using the corresponding eigenfunctions and their corresponding eigenenergies , we can calculate the regularized real and pseudoscalar values @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 . with use of these @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 , eq . ( [ eq : 1 ] ) can then be used to calculate a new energy profile @ xmath52 . the calculation process above is repeated with this new profile @ xmath52 until the self - consistency is achieved . since the generalized magnetic moments of the nucleon are defined as functions of generalized form##on the ( gpds ) , it is convenient to start with the corresponding values of the unpolarized gpds @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 in the cqsm . from the expression in @ xcite , @ xcite , we obtain the values @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 respectively , the isoscalar and isovector values respectively corresponding to the sum and the product of the two quantities @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 . the relationship between these quantities and the le parton values of @ xmath71 and @ xmath72 is obtained most easily in the so - called breit formula . they are given by @ xmath73 where @ xmath74 these two possible values of @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 can be extracted from the second index of @ xmath75 as @ xmath76 where tr " is the trace at the origin , for @ xmath77 . now , within the cqsm , it is possible to obtain the right - hand side ( right ) of ( [ q : hetrace ] ) and ( [ eq : het##trace ] ) . since the results are already given in the other section @ xcite @ xcite , we need not repeat the derivation . here we rely instead on the following general ##ization of the above formula for the observables in the cqsm . the leading contribution term corresponds to the total field strength , which is independent of the local rotational velocity @ xmath78 of the local soliton . the next - to - leading contribution term takes account of the local response of the internal field ##s to the rotational velocity of an independent perturbation , and so it is equal to @ xmath78 . it is known that the leading - contribution term contributes to the isoscalar part of @ xmath79 and to the isovector part of @ xmath80 , while the isoscalar part of @ xmath79 and the isovector part of @ xmath80 survived only at the next - to - leading order of @ xmath78 ( instead of @ xmath81 ) . the leading - order gpds are usually written as @ xmath82 . the term @ xmath83 denotes the sum over the terms ( the total##nce for high - ( dirac ##ian ) spin orbitals in the strong magnetic field . on the other hand , the spin calculations for the isovector part of @ xmath84 and the isoscalar part of @ xmath85 , which are to the second - to - fourth order , are a bit more complicated . they are calculated as direct sums of the single - orbitals of @ xmath86 \ , e ^ { i } ##y _ { z ^ 2 } \ nonumber \ \ & \ , & \ hspace { n \ } \ , \ \ langle n | \ tau ^ a | n \ rangle \ langle m | \ , \ tau ^ a \ , ( m + \ tau ^ a \ gamma ^ a ) \ , e ^ { -

1 group of gpds . for the first moment , we confine ourselves to the 1st and the 2nd moments , which respectively correspond to the standard ##ised form factor of the nucleon and the so - called generalized form factors . we are especially interested in the second moment , since they are able to provide valuable information about the electronic structure of the molecule through the ##tter - momentum - rule @ xcite , @ xcite . for each isospin channel , the 1st and the 2nd moments of @ xmath89 define the sachs - electric and gravito - magnetic form factors as @ xmath90 and @ xmath91 on the other hand , the 1st and the 2nd moments of @ xmath92 respectively define the sachs - electric and gravito - magnetic form factors as @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 on the second ,we shall see how we can calculate the corresponding form factors based on the corresponding values of corresponding gpds , by taking @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 as examples . taking @ xmath97 and integrating over @ xmath98 into ( [ q : gpdheis ] ) , we have @ xmath99 integrating this expression into ( [ eq : ge10def ] ) , we have @ xmath100 it is easy to see that , given the local rotational symmetry of the electron system , the term containing the factor @ xmath101 then arises , so that @ xmath102 is reduced to a single term as follows : @ xmath103 apart from the factor @ xmath104 , this is all of the known expression for the isoscalar sachs - teller form factor of the electron in the cqsm @ xcite . a less simple expression is @ xmath96 , which is defined as the magnetic moment of @ xmath105 . inserting ( [ q : heis ] ) into ( [ q : ge10def ] ) and carrying out the integration of @ xmat##h1 , we obtain @ xmath106 using the s - q expansion of @ xmath107 , this can be divided by @ xmath108 this can then be divided into two expressions : @ xmath109 where @ xmath110 with @ xmath111 to go by , we first note that , by using the generalized spherical symmetry , @ xmath112 holds and when @ xmath113 , i . e . @ xmath114 which leads to the expression : @ xmath115 to obtain @ xmath116 , we first note that @ xmath117 ^ { ( \ 0 ) } . \ ] ] however , the generalized spherical symmetry implies that @ xmath118 must be zero , so that the value of the above expression is not equal to @ xmath119 ^ { ( 0 ) } . \ ] ] this expression is @ xmath120 ^ { ( 0 ) } \ , \ lambda _ { ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ $ $ } } ) . \ , { \ } \ ] ] due to the identity @ xmath121 we havefrom that @ xmath122 , we find the next term @ xmath123 . from @ xmath124 ^ { ( \ lambda ) } \ \ sim \ -

taylor form factors of the. . therefore , we can call @ xmath96 the gravitoelectric form factor of the particle ( spin matrix part ) , since it is related to the nonforward nucleon matrix part of the spin component of the nuclear angular momentum vector . the other two form factors can be used in a similar way . the isovector part of the generalized magnetic form factors survive only at the next - to - leading order of @ xmath78 . they are given as @ xmath136 and @ xmath137 ^ { ( 1 ) } \ , { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } ] ^ { ( 1 ) } \ , { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } \ , | | n \ rangle \ tau \ } . \ , { aligned } \ ] ] the isoscalar part of the generalized magnetic form factors can survive only at the next - to - leading order of @ xmath78 , so that they are treated as partial sums of the two - electron orbitals in the applied magnetic field . @ xmath138 and @ xmath139we find that @ xmath140 just agrees with the standard expression of the isoscalar sachs - magnetic form factor of the electron in the cqsm @ xcite . on the other hand , @ xmath141 is sometimes called the gravitomagnetic form factor of the nucleon ( the isoscalar part ) , which we can define in the qcsm based on the well known expression . similarly , the second - order terms to the isovector sum of the generalized magnetic form factor are given as @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 . unknown to us are the values of the generalized form factor to the forward limit @ xmath5 . the use of this relation is also useful for the consistency of our theoretical analyses , since it leads to fundamental selection as shown below . we first consider the forward limit of @ xmath95 . from ( [ q : inthe10is ] ) , we find that @ xmath144 subtracting the corresponding second contribution , this leads to @ xmath145 . if we remember the expression @ xmath146 the forward limit of ( [ q : inthe10is ] ) also givesto the following rule : @ xmath147 which means that the sum of the @ xmath69 - proton and @ xmath70 - quark numbers for the proton is three . then we get to the upper limit of @ xmath96 , which is @ xmath148 it is easy to see that , after regularization and further calculations , the first term of the solution of the above equation corresponds to the proton ( electron ) part of the soliton term , i . e . @ xmath149 in ( [ eq : estatic ] ) . it was proved by @ xcite that , for the cqsm with finite electron mass , the following identity holds : @ xmath150 in the case of finite electron mass , which we are considering , this identity does not hold . however , we can prove ( see below ) that @ xmath151 that is , the first term of the parenthesis of terms of eq . ( [ eq : momsum ] ) just agrees with the pion part of the proton energy ( electron mass ) . since the sum of the proton and electron part .the corresponding soliton is @ xmath152 , we also have that @ xmath153 in terms of unity . ( [ ref : inthe20is ] ) , this result can also be written as @ xmath154 which denotes that the total mass fraction produced by the proton ( the @ xmath69 - and @ xmath70 - nuclei ) is just unity . this is the correct result , since the cqsm contains quark ##s , ( note that the pion is not an integral product of quarks ) , and that the total angular momentum should be saturated by the magnetic field z . for the backward limit of @ xmath155 , we are also subject to a simple sum rule , given by the parameter low . in particular , we have @ xmath156 ##9 leading to @ xmath157 which denotes that the product of the @ xmath69 - quark and the @ xmath70 - quark ##s in the proton is just unity . on the other hand , the forward limit of @ xmath158 leads to the same nontrivial sum rule as @ xmath159 since thishowever , which is the unit of kinetic energy carried by the @ xmath69 - particle and the @ xmath70 - particle in the system , is not defined by any physical theory , its exact value can be estimated only indirectly . here we return to the discussion of the forward limit of the time integral ##s of . first , the forward limit of @ xmath140 gives @ xmath160 which is the known expression of the isoscalar magnetic moment of the nucleon in the cqsm @ xcite . on the other hand , the forward limit of @ xmath141 gives @ xmath161 it is shown in @ xcite that the value of the above equation is just one , i . e . @ xmath162 in terms of ( [ x : gm2nd ] ) , this identity can be recast into a slightly different form as @ xmath163 \ , d ^ . \ , { aligned } \ ] ] using the \ angular momentum sum ##mation \ to ji @ xmath164 \ , [ x = x ^ { x + d } , \ ] ] the above equation claims that @ xmath165 whichnote that the nucleon spin is saturated by the quark spin alone . this is not a surprising result , because the cqsm is an effective quark model which contains no explicit magnetic fields . the derived model ( [ e : gm20ist0 ] ) has still this form . using the fact that @ xmath141 consists of such terms as @ xmath166 eq .

( [ e : mgivform ] ) , we get @ xmath170 which is the known value of the isovector magnetic form factor of the particle in the cqsm . on the other hand , for @ xmath5 and ( [ e : mg2ivform ]) , we have @ xmath171 as used in @ xcite , this selection factor can be recast into the following : @ xmath172 where @ xmath173 consists of two terms : @ xmath174 here , the first term is given as the proton - element of the _ free field _ _ for the isovector ##ial _ p operator of . ##s : @ xmath175 with @ xmath176 \ , \ , ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ $ $ } } ) \ , d ^ { n \ nonumber \ \ & = & \ hat { l } _ n ^ { ( i = 1 ) } + \ frac { 1 } { 1 } \ , \ hat { \ psi } ^ { ( i = 1 ) } . \ hat { l } \ ] ] on the other hand , the second term is given as @ xmath177 | [ \ rangle . \ ] ] the model of the chiral model contains two parameters , the weak pion coupling constant @ xmath178 and the weak quark constant @ xmath11 . as such , @ xmath178 is equivalent toits physical value , i . e . @ xmath179 . for the physical value @ xmath11 , there is strong evidence based on the instanton - state of the standard model that it is not extremely different from @ xmath180 @ xcite . the first phenomenological analyses of the static ##al observables based on this model found a much larger value of @ xmath11 than @ xmath180 and @ xmath181 @ xcite @ xcite . in the second analysis , we use the value @ xmath182 . with this value of @ xmath182 , we prepare self - consistent model solutions for the values of @ xmath183 , i . e . @ xmath184 and @ xmath185 , in order to see the local mass dependence of the local scale factors etc . the physical predictions of the model can be obtained by using the values of @ xmath182 and @ xmath186 , since this value gives a self - consistent model , similar to the phenomenologically correct one found with @ xmath187 and @ xmath188consider the two - particle sachs - villars model of @ xcite @ xcite . we can show in fig . [ fig : 1 ] the soliton wave functions @ xmath52 , with several variants of @ xmath183 , i . e . @ xmath189 , and @ xmath185 . one sees that the average size of the soliton waves becomes more and more large as the quantum number increases . and @ xmath190 , and @ xmath185 . , width = 340 , height = 264 ] we are now able to test the theoretical predictions of the cqsm for the generalized form factors . since the theoretical lattice predictions are given for the generalized form factors @ xmath191 and @ xmath192 , which are the dual of the generalized sachs and sachs form factors , we can write out the relationship between these form factors and the generalized sachs - sachs coefficients , which we have found in the cqsm . they are given by @ xmath193 \ , / \ , ( 1 + \ tau ) , \ \ , _ { t } ^ { 1 + 1 } ( t ) & = & \& [ \ , g _ { e , 20 } ^ { ( i = 1 ) } ( t ) + \ tau \ , g _ { e , 20 } ^ { ( i = 1 ) } ( t ) \ right ] \ , / \ , ( 1 + \ tau ) , \ \ a _ { 10 } ^ { u - d } ( t ) & = & \ left [ \ , g _ { e , 20 } ^ { ( i = 0 ) } ( t ) + \ tau \ , g _ { m , 20 } ^ { ( i = 1 ) } ( t ) \ right ] \ , / \ , ( 1 + \ tau ) , \ \ a _ { 10 } ^ { u - d } ( t ) & = & \ left [ \ , g _ { e , 10 } ^ { ( i = 1 ) } ( t ) + \ tau \ , g _ { e , 20 } ^ { ( i = 0 ) } ( t ) \ right ] \ , / \ , ( 1 + \ tau ) , \ , { t } \ ] ] and @ xmath194 \ , / \ , ( 1 + \ tau ) , \ \ a _ { t } ^ {u + d } ( t ) & = & \ left [ \ , g _ { m , 10 } ^ { ( i = 1 ) } ( t ) - g _ { e , 20 } ^ { ( i = 0 ) } ( t ) \ right ] \ , / \ , ( 1 + \ tau ) , \ \ g _ { 20 } ^ { u - d } ( t ) & = & \ left [ \ , g _ { m , 10 } ^ { ( i = 0 ) } ( t ) - g _ { e , 20 } ^ { ( i = 1 ) } ( t ) \ right ] \ , / \ , ( 1 + \ tau ) , \ \ g _ { 20 } ^ { u - d } ( t ) & = & \ left [ \ , g _ { e , 20 } ^ { ( i = 0 ) } ( t ) - g _ { e , 20 } ^ { ( i = 1 ) } ( t ) \ right ] \ , / \ , ( 1 + \ tau ) , \ , { t } \ ] ] where @ xmath195 . we note that @ xmath196 and @ xmath197 are different but the sameeinstein and sachs form factors of the form : @ xmath198 since the lattice calculations of the lhpc and qcdsf groups were carried out in the small mass region of @ xmath199 and since the simulation in the large - mass region was hard to perform , we think it appropriate to investigate the local mass dependence of the generalized form factors within the parameters of the cqsm . for simplicity , we shall show the local mass dependence of the generalized form factors at the zero momentum transfer point . we think it appropriate for our purposes because the generalized form factors at the zero momentum point provide the most useful information for clarifying the underlying physical structure of the system . at zero momentum transfer , the relations between the generalized dirac and sachs form factors and the generalized sachs - type form factors are extended to consider @ xmath200 and @ xmath201 and @ xmath202 as functions of @ xmath183 ( the two diamonds ) , together with the corresponding lattice predictions . thus , the open squares correspond to the predictions of the lhpc group @ xcite , and the closed squares to those of the qcdsf group @ xcite . , x =604 , height = 264 ] ] . [ fig : a1020is ] shows the predictions of the cqsm for @ xmath203 and @ xmath202 as functions of @ xmath183 , together with the corresponding lattice prediction . as for @ xmath203 , the cqsm predictions and the lattice prediction function are as functions of @ xmath183 and together with the predictions of the large number . ##mation : @ xmath204 with high - precision . turning to @ xmath202 , one sees a sizable difference between the predictions of the cqsm and of the lattice qcd . the lattice qcd predicts that @ xmath205 which means that in the @ xmath206 of the total electron momentum is carried by the gauge fields , while the rest is carried by the gluon fields . on the other hand , the cqsm predictions for the same quantity is @ xmath207 which means that the gauge fields carry the total electron momentum . this may certainly be the result of an elementary quark model , which has no explicit gauge fields . note , however , that thethe quark energy of @ xmath202 is a scale dependent function . the lattice prediction corresponds to the energy scale of @ xmath208 @ xcite , so the cqsm value should be interpreted as that of the model energy scale of @ xmath209 @ xcite . we shall therefore make a meaningful comparison by taking account of the scale dependence of relevant observables . and @ xmath210 are representations of @ xmath183 , together with the corresponding lattice prediction @ xcite , @ xcite . the meanings of the symbols are the same as in fig . [ fig : a1020is ] . , width = 604 , height = 264 ] next , in fig . [ fig : a1020iv ] , we show the isovector combination of the generalized representations of @ xmath211 and @ xmath210 . the meanings of the symbols are the same as in fig . [ fig : a1020is ] . as for @ xmath211 , both the cqsm and the lattice prediction use the complex number representation of @ xmath212 with good accuracy . similarly to @ xmath210 , one sees that theprediction of the cqsm has somewhat peculiar effects on the pion region . starting from a very small value in the chiral limit ( @ xmath213 ) , it gradually increases as @ xmath183 increases , but as @ xmath183 further increases it begins to decrease , thus showing a tendency to match the lattice prediction in the heavy pion region . more interestingly , to put aside the absolute value , a similar @ xmath183 effect is also observed in the chiral limit of the lattice prediction for the momentum fraction @ xmath214 shown in fig . 25 of @ xcite . here , the quantity @ xmath210 is the meaning of the difference of the momentum fraction carried by the @ xmath69 - quark and the @ xmath70 - particle . the empirical information for this is @ xmath215 @ xcite . one assumes that the prediction of the cqsm in the chiral limit is not derived from this empirical information , although more accurate predictions must take account of the scale factor of @ xmath216 . and @ xmath217 is part of @ xmath183 , together with the otherlattice predictions @ xcite , @ xcite . the dimensions of the measurements are the same as in fig . [ fig : a1020is ] . , width = 604 , length = 264 ] . , as in fig . [ fig : b1020is ] . the cqsm predictions for @ xmath218 and @ xmath217 . the observed value is related to the isoscalar value of the nucleon combined magnetic moment as @ xmath219 . ( we find that the observed value is @ xmath220 . ) we find that this quantity is very close to the value of the atomic mass . it appears that the cqsm prediction @ xmath221 corresponding to chiral limit underestimates the quantity significantly . however , the error is not too great in this case . in fact , if we carry out a calculation of the combined isoscalar magnetic moment of the measurements @ xmath222 , the cqsm for the chiral limit is @ xmath223 in comparison with the observed value @ xmath224 . to our knowledge , the lattice predictions are made for this quantity by means of the lhpc or qc##dsf ##d . the right side of fig . 4 shows the predictions for @ xmath217 , which is sometimes called the isoscalar contribution of the nucleon anomalous gravitomagnetic moment , or simply the _ total _ contribution to the _ anomalous gravitomagnetic moment _ . as previously pointed out , the value of the cqsm for this quantity is not zero : i . e . @ xmath169 the following experimental calculation also shows this . it should be noted that the experimental result @ xmath225 is in the cqsm is just a direct sum of the _ total sum rule _ and the _ total nucleon momentum sum rule _ , both of which are saturated in the experiment and only in the cqsm as @ xmath226 and @ xmath227 \ = \ \ langle ^ \ rangle ^ { u + 1 } \ = \ \ frac { 1 } { u } . \ ] ] in the qcd , the energy term contributes to these sum rules , thus leading to the general identities : @ xmath228 + [ a _ { u } ^ 2 ( 0 ) + [_ { 20 } ^ { ( x ) ] = 0 , \ { { 0 } \ ] ] which means that only the sum of @ xmath217 and @ xmath229 is forced to vanish as @ xmath230 ( since we mention here the presence of more particles than the @ xmath69 - and @ xmath70 - combinations , it loses no importance in our discussion here . in fact , to include them , we have had to replace the term @ xmath231 by @ xmath232 . ) the second nontrivial identity implies that the net contributions of vector and vector contributions to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon must be equal . an important question is whether the vector and gluon contribution to the net gravitomagnetic moment vanishes , or they are equally large with opposite sign . a perturbative analysis based on a very simple statistical model indicates the latter possibility @ xcite . on the other hand , a nonperturbative analysis in the framework of the model itself indicates that the net vector contribution to the anomalous gravitom##agnetic , very small , near zero , @ xmath233 @ xcite , @ xcite . ( to be more precise , we sees that the result of the lhpc group for @ xmath217 is slightly negative @ xcite , while that of the qcdsf group is slightly positive @ xcite . ) this strongly suggests the strong possibility that the proton and electron contributions to the net gravitomagnetic moment of the universe may separately vanish . worthy of special mention here is an important argument given by teryaev many years ago , claiming that the vanishing of these contributions to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the universe , observed in string theory , is unlikely to be satisfied in the nonperturbative case due to the confinement @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite . very surprisingly , once this actually happens , it leads to a surprisingly simple result , i . e . the proportionality of the quark mass and angular momentum of @ xmath234 as advocated by teryaev @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite . a far reaching theoretical consequence arising from this argument was also discussed in ourthe predictions @ xcite . ( see also the table at the end of this section . ) and @ xmath235 are predictions of @ xmath183 , together with the corresponding lattice parameters @ xcite , @ xcite . the order of the parameters is the same as in fig . [ fig : a1020is ] . , width = 604 , height = 264 ] finally , we present in fig . [ fig : b1020iv ] the predictions for the isovector values , i . e . @ xmath236 and @ xmath235 . we show here that the parameter @ xmath236 is the isovector value of the nucleon cloud magnetic moment @ xmath237 , the empirical value of which is known to be @ xmath238 . one find that this quantity is very sensitive to the variation of the electron cloud distribution of @ xmath239 . this is only true if one remembers the important role of the electron cloud in the isovector magnetic moment of the atom . ( one may find that the value of the cqsm for @ xmath240 changes a little the empirical value evenin the chiral limit . we note , however , that , within the framework of the cqsm , there is an important @ xmath241 correction or the second order first correction to this type of isovector . ( the isovector is that of the nucleon in question or the wave - vector coupling constant of the particle @ xcite @ xcite . this second - to - last correction for @ xmath241 should also be taken into account in more detailed calculations . ) shown in the right side of fig . [ 1 : b1020iv ] is the lattice predictions for @ xmath235 , the half of which can be interpreted as the difference of the total angular momentum carried by the @ xmath69 - particle and the @ xmath70 - quark fields according to the s angular momentum equation ##mation @ xcite . the cqsm gives rather small value for this quantity , in comparison to the lattice predictions of sizable quantities . it seems that the strong spin dependence rescues this quantity only partially . also we note that , the reason why the cqsm ( in the chiral limit ) gives rather small value for this quantity is intimately connected with the quantum@ xmath1 dependence of the reflection @ xmath242 , the upper bound of the isovector unpolarized spin - 1 gpd of the reflection . to show it , we must note that , within the theoretical physics work of the cqsm , @ xmath236 as well as @ xmath243 are the distribution functions of @ xmath244 and @ xmath245 and of @ xmath246 and @ xmath247 , respectively , and @ xmath248 although the quantities of the rhs can be calculated directly without reference to the distribution functions , they can also be evaluated as @ xmath1 - the integrals of the two gpds of @ xmath249 the distribution function @ xmath242 has already been used in the cqsm in our original paper @ xcite . as stated above , the mean square contribution to this term reaches a sizably significant peak around @ xmath250 . since this small peak due to the weak dirac - string interaction is approximately symmetric with respect to the reflection @ xmath251 , it hardly contributes to the second term@ xmath252 , whereas it gives a sizable increase to the peak value @ xmath253 . the most important effect of @ xmath242 and @ xmath250 can physically be interpreted as the effects of pion cloud . it can be interpreted in two ways . first , we see how this value of @ xmath242 changes as the background cloud is increased . obtained with @ xmath182 and @ xmath239 . , width = 340 , height = 264 ] instead of @ xmath254 . , width = 604 , height = 264 ] . in fig . [ fig : eiv _ pi0 ] and in fig . [ fig : eiv _ pi24 ] are the cqsm predictions for @ xmath242 with the values of @ xmath183 . i . e . @ xmath255 , and @ xmath256 . one clearly sees that the size of the peak around @ xmath250 , due to the large s - type frame , decreases rapidly as @ xmath183 increases . this is our interpretation of this effect as the effects of pion cloud . .the other way , one also finds that the value of the spin sea contribution , measured at @ xmath257 , gradually decreases as @ xmath183 becomes large . this dependence of @ xmath242 turns out to be a rather unexpected @ xmath183 dependence of @ xmath253 and @ xmath252 . as a dependence of @ xmath183 , the spin sea contribution to @ xmath253 decreases rapidly , whereas the spin sea contribution to it increases slowly , so that the net @ xmath253 is a decreasing function of @ xmath183 . on the other hand , due to the approximate odd - function nature of the spin sea contribution to @ xmath258 with respect to @ xmath1 , it hardly contributes to @ xmath259 independent of the effective temperature , while the valence sea contribution to @ xmath258 is an increasing function of @ xmath183 , thus leading to the conclusion that the net @ xmath259 is a increasing function of @ xmath183 . starting with @ xmath182 and @ xmath239. , width = 340 , height = 264 ] dependence of @ xmath260 . , width = 604 , height = 264 ] we can give yet more support to the above - mentioned interpretation of the nature of the anti - sea distribution . to support it , we must note that the theoretical unpolarized distribution of @ xmath261 used in the measurement @ xmath262 also has a sizable peak in @ xmath250 due to the observed anti - sea distribution . as shown in fig . [ fig : fiv _ pi0 ] and in fig . [ fig : fiv _ pi24 ] , this peak is actually a rapidly decreasing function of @ xmath183 , supporting our interpretation of it as the effects of beta decay . here , we can explain this . we point out that this small - @ xmath1 distribution of @ xmath261 is exactly what was predicted by the famous nmc measurement @ xcite . to confirm it , we remember that the distribution @ xmath263 in the negative @ xmath1 distribution should actually be interpreted as the distribution of beta . to be explicit , it follows that @ x##math264 the large and large value of @ xmath261 in the smaller @ xmath1 region close to @ xmath250 indicates that @ xmath265 is negative , i . e . the value of the @ xmath7 - particle and the @ xmath8 - quark in the proton , which has been measured in the nmc experiment @ xcite . corresponding to @ xmath266 and @ xmath267 [ consistent with the wang and nutev measurements for the corresponding energy scales @ xcite , @ xcite . , width = 340 , length = 283 ] shown in fig . [ right : dbdu ] are the predictions of the cqsm for @ xmath268 corresponding to the corresponding energy scale corresponding to the experimental experiment @ xcite . ( the same predictions above were obtained with @ xmath182 and @ xmath269 . ) the model describes exactly the observed behavior of @ xmath268 , although the magnitude of the flavor asymmetry in the @ xmath1 region seems to be greatly overestimated . it is a generally accepted fact that this flavor variation of the # ##borg distribution inthe effects can physically be understood as the effects of proton clouds at least . @ xcite @ xcite . this paper expands our understanding of the effects of the neutral super - proton ##borg . @ xmath242 and @ xmath261 . the effects of proton clouds . . the @ xmath270 papers of @ xmath271 , @ xmath272 , and @ xmath273 compare the cqsm with @ xmath182 . [ tabivb20 ] [ id = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , id = " header " , ] in this paper , we have investigated the generalized form factors of the lattice , which can be determined through mean - field measurements of the generalized parton wave function , within the framework of the cqsm . a special emphasis is placed on the energy density , as well as the scale dependence of the model predictions , which we compare with the experimental predictions of the lattice ##s by the lhpc and the qcdsf , carried out in the heavy ion region . @ xmath199 . the generalized form factors are the ordinary electromagnetic form factors of thenucleon such as the tau and tau form factors of the proton and the neutron . we have shown that the cqsm with good chiral ##ity describes well the physical behaviors of the various nuclear form factors , but the lattice simulations of the above two groups show a tendency to ignore the electromagnetic properties of the nucleus . undoubtedly , this should not be unrelated to the fact that the above two group simulations were performed with unrealistically large pion masses . we have also tried to find out the underlying electronic structure of the nucleus by the analysis of the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic form factors of the nucleon , by taking account of the pion mass despondencies as well as of the scale dependencies of the lattice parameters . by taking account of the scale dependence by means of the qcd field equations at the nlo and the @ xmath274 scale , the cqsm predicts , at @ xmath275 , that @ xmath276 , and @ xmath277 , which means that the nuclear spin angular momentum carries some amount of total nucleon spin even at such a very high energy level . this contradictsthe predictions of the lhpc and qcdsf are indicating that the total spin angular momentum of quarks is very small or consistent with this . it should be recognized , however , that the prediction of the cqsm for the total spin angular momentum is not very different from the previous lattice prediction @ xmath278 at the same renormalization group . the possibility of discrepancy can also be traced back to the lhpc and qcdsf lattice qcd prediction for the quark spin fraction @ xmath279 = 0 . 5 , which supports not only the prediction of the cqsm but also the emc observation . as was shown in our previous prediction @ xcite , @ xmath279 is such a quantity that is extremely sensitive to the variation of the top spin , especially in the region close to the chiral ##ity . more serious lattice prediction based on the @ xmath270 - prediction of @ xmath279 is highly desirable . worthy of special mention is the fact that , once we accept a new model @ xmath280 , i . e , the absence of the top quark due to the anomalous gravitomagnetic spinof the nucleon , which is supported by results of the lhpc and qcdsf ##d simulations , we are then subject to two surprisingly simple relations , @ xmath281 and @ xmath282 , i . e . the product of the energy and angular momentum components carried by the electrons and the nuclei . using these relations , together with the existing empirical values for the unpolarized and the spin polarized pdfs , we can obtain _ scale - independent values _ for the quark and proton contents of the standard model . for example , with combined results of the mrst2004 fit @ xcite and the dns2005 fit @ xcite , we obtain @ xmath283 , @ xmath284 , and @ xmath285 at @ xmath275 . since @ xmath286 ( as well as @ xmath287 ) is a rapidly decreasing function of the energy scale , while the scale factor of @ xmath279 is very small , we can conclude that the former is much more effective over the latter at the scale of @ xmath288 where any other energy scales are supposed to2 . the problem is a bit more complicated in the flavor - nonsinglet ( non isovector ) case , because @ xmath289 , and also because the cqsm and the lattice theory have fairly similar predictions for @ xmath271 . when combined with the same predictions for @ xmath271 and @ xmath290 , the predictions of the cqsm turn out to be for @ xmath291 . we have shown that the relatively small value of @ xmath246 obtained by the cqsm is intimately connected with the small @ xmath1 enhancement of the generalized parton distribution @ xmath292 , which is characterized by the clouds of pionic @ xmath293 excitation around @ xmath294 . ( we recall that the smallest enhancement of @ xmath292 is @ xmath246 . ) however , such an @ xmath1 - like value for @ xmath292 can not be predicted within the framework of lattice theory . thus , the relatively small @ xmath1 enhancement of @ xmath295 as well as of @ xmath296 indicates that the presence of a##ral ##v exploits the nucleon effect in physics , which has not been fully accounted for in the full computer simulation at the present time . this work is funded in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research for ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan ( reg . no - 16540253 ) . we closely follow the proof of the electron conservation rule given in @ xcite , by taking into account every necessary step in the formulation of @ xmath297 . the starting point is the following formula for the soliton mass ( or the total electron mass ) : @ xmath298 \ - \ ( h \ rightarrow e _ 0 ) \ + \ e _ 0 , \ ] ] with @ xmath299 \ = \ - \ , m _ \ pi ^ 2 \ , h _ \ pi ^ 2 \ , \ int \ , [ \ cos f ( x ) - 1 ] \ , h ^ { 1 . \ label { h : emeson } \ ] ] the soliton mass can be conserved with respect to an invariant component of the chiral field @ xmath300 or equivalently the field of @ xmath##52 , which lead to the fixed point theorem : @ xmath301 \ + \ \ delta e _ m \ = \ , . \ ] ] . we have a special ( dilatational ) case of chiral ##ity @ xmath302 for ( @ xmath3 , we have @ xmath303 such that @ xmath304 \ = \ \ , \ , ( [ x ^ k \ partial _ k , h ] - k \ gamma ^ k \ gamma ^ k \ partial _ k ) . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] for the ( @ xmath305 ) \ = \ \ mbox { sp } ( [ \ , \ , ( e _ m - h + h \ varepsilon ) ] x ^ k \ partial _ k ) \ = \ \ , \ begin { aligned } \ ] ] we now have the solution : @ xmath306 = - \ , \ delta e _ m . \ end { x : keyid } \ ] ] now , by adding ( [ x : emeson ] ) together with the identity , @ xmath307 we get @ xmath308 . , on account of thethe condition @ xmath309 we can find : @ xmath310 we can find the equivalence relation : @ xmath311 putting this relation into ( [ x : keyid ] ) , we get @ xmath312 or @ xmath313 if we evaluate the direct sum ##mation . given the eigenstates of the static dirac hamiltonian @ xmath50 , a complete set of equations , ( [ eq : traceap ] ) can then be written as @ xmath314 which is the result given in ( [ x : alfp ] ) . we find out that our solution is the correct chiral ##ity , since @ xmath315 is @ xmath316 and therefore @ xmath317 in accordance with the result given in ref . @ xcite .
