several decades later , @ xcite demonstrated that the absorption lines observed in the spectra of distant qsos are related to the surrounding gaseous halos of the galaxies . since that time , astronomers have identified the galaxies associated with the observed lines ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and have used qso spectroscopy of various two - phase ultraviolet transitions to facilitate the study of baryonic processes in the outer envelope of galaxies , e . g . , feedback , heating , and cooling @ xcite . these lines include ly @ xmath9 and lines that probe cold , photoionized material @ xcite , and and lines that probe warmer , more diffuse material @ xcite . however , while the high brightness of qsos provides large signal - to - noise , high spectral resolution datasets , they can obscure the galaxies themselves , and thus limit follow - up observations , especially for high impact parameters . furthermore , qsos are too large in the sky to cover many distant galaxies with multiple sightlines . therefore , constraints on the spectral fraction ( @ xmath10 ) and spatial distribution of the gas may be imposed ( e . g . , * ?? ? * ; * ? ? ? the @ xmath11 doublet in particular has been studied extensively , as it is easily detected at long wavelengths and by @ xmath12 and traces cool regions ( with detection @ xmath13 ; * ? ? ? * ) in a wide range of neutral - gas regions ( @ xmath14 @ xmath15 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in spite of this , the exact origins of the gas giving rise to them remain . several studies ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ) propose an infall model for this gas ; for example , @ xcite propose an infall model with which they model the observed frequency distribution patterns for galaxies as well as their physical properties @ xcite . other studies @ xcite suggest instead that these systems arise in gas which has been sucked out of star - forming galaxies via superwinds . in support of this latter scenario , a recent study by @ xcite of changes in coadded deep2 spectra of a sample of star - forming galaxies by @ xmath16 reveals numerous , and even ubiquitous , observations of this gas . @ xcite can produce very high velocitywinds in @ xmath17 post - starburst galaxies occur by absorption . such winds can redistribute absorbing gas , extending to the ' s halo , although the distances to which the winds extend remain uncertain . in one of the first studies addressing this issue , @ xcite detected cool outflowing gas several kiloparsecs from the nuclei of a pair of @ xmath18 ultraluminous spiral galaxies . in addition , galaxy surveys can also study the halo ##s of individual galaxies along the sightline ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this survey also has several advantages over qso - galaxy cluster surveys ( cf . koo et al . 2009 , in detail ) . the projected mass density of galaxies in the cluster is much greater than that of qsos ; increasing the number of galaxies can vastly increase the number of potential background sources for a given galaxy pair . additionally , many galaxies have background sources which provide the opportunity to study galaxies along multiple lines of sight in a given galactic region , including their own ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? integrated field unit ( ifu ) spectrographs can also be used to study the haloof the mass and the spatial distribution of the gas . close transverse pairs of galaxies can be identified in either optical or photometric techniques so that a targeted search for foreground absorption in the background galaxy spectra can be performed . this technique has been used at @ xmath19 to measure the gas caused by transitions such as near lyman break detected at @ xcite ; but it has not yet been used at high redshifts where high resolution imaging and spectroscopy can be obtained for this galaxy . in the course of carrying out a recent survey to measure outflow ##s in galaxies at @ xmath20 , we identified a close transverse pair of galaxies in which the detection of the more distant object ( @ xmath2 ) allowed the detection ( and absorption ) of gas in the spectrum of the foreground galaxy ( at @ xmath0 and the impact parameter @ xmath21 kpc ) . this foreground absorber shows signs of strong stellar activity , has a gas content consistent with that of a non - starburst galaxy , and is host to a low - luminosity agn . next we analyze the spectrum of the background galaxy to examine the ##s in the foreground galaxy . we discuss our observations ofthe galaxy pair and its properties in [ tab . thepair ] . analysis of the halo components of the pair and the foreground radio absorption is done in [ sec . analysis ] . the possible origins of the cosmic background halo gas are discussed in [ sec . analysis ] , and we conclude in [ sec . conclusions ] . we adopt the @ xmath22 system with @ xmath23 , @ xmath24 , and @ xmath25 . where it is not explicitly stated , we adopt @ xmath26 . , and are in the same system . our new galaxy pair is located in the goods - smith system ( smithsonian galactic origins project ; * ? ? ? * ) and has been observed using the hst ##2 camera for surveys in the f group ( f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp , or @ xmath27 , @ xmath28 , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 ) . galaxy properties derived in these studies and surveys are given in table [ tab . photinfo ] . we perform images of the galaxies using the high resolution infrared spectrometer ( lris ) on keck 1 @xcite ##r 2008 may 30 - 31 ut . we used the @ xmath31 grism blazed at 4000 on the blue side and the @ xmath31 light source at 7500 on the red side with the d560 dichroic . this data provided an fwhm resolution coverage between @ xmath6 and @ xmath32 and wavelength coverage between @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 . two sets of data were obtained . we first used a slitmask to place an @ xmath35 slitlet across the center of the elliptical ##ly - ne and obtained @ xmath36 images with fwhm @ xmath37 seeing . we then used an @ xmath38 - wide longslit across the center and obtained @ xmath39 images with @ xmath40 seeing ( see figure [ 2 . im ] ) . the data were reduced using the xidl lowreduxxavier / lowredux / ] data processing pipeline . the pipeline includes source ##ing and re - fielding , source selection , source detection , source correction , source isolation , cosmic ray rejection , and flux correction . vacuum and heliocentric corrections are2 . because the distance between the galaxies is about 0 . 5 , we used a slightly separated window centered on the background galaxy to weight the extracted spectrum ( with @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 for the blue and red sides , respectively ) . this limits measurement of the extracted spectrum by lines from the background galaxy to @ xmath43 . using a different absorption window ( @ xmath44 ) will also reduce the optical resolution ( ews ) of the spectrum ( e . g . , h9 , ) measured for the foreground galaxy , but this does not affect the accuracy of our stellar evolution models ( discussed in [ ref . fg ] ) . we derive values for the two galaxies using idl codes adapted for use in the deep2 survey ( cf . faber et al . 2009 , in ref ; * ? ? ? * ) from the publicly available code developed for the sdss . ] in brief , this code calculates the minimum @ xmath45 value as a function of the lag between an extracted spectrum and a linear combination of two templates . one template is an extracted spectral line spectrum with parameters selected for consistency with the optical resolution of @ xmath46 ,one of the coadded average of thousands of absorption - type background galaxies @ xcite , and one of each individual star cluster . the latter , which includes the uv absorption lines was also used to constrain the fits . each galaxy redshift has also been measured by eye . we assume that the spectra of the background and interacting galaxies are @ xmath47 and @ xmath48 , respectively . the differences are the formal @ xmath49 uncertainties of the fitted parameters . these redshifts are within @ xmath50 of the values measured by the first keck radio sky survey ( tkrs ; * ? ? ? * ) for these objects . we assume the infrared spectrum of each galaxy to be at the same galaxy redshift . figures [ fig . im ] and [ fig . fullspec ] show hst spectra of the galaxy , and our lris spectrum of the interacting galaxy , respectively . uv absorption lines in the z - plane of the background galaxy are predominantly in infrared and are offset to negative velocity from infrared , indicating the presence of an outflow . emission due to , as well as emission from the absorption lines , is also evident . the absorption lines and absorptionare visible at the light curve of the foreground galaxy in question ; these marks coincide with strong lines in the background , and are presumably due to gas associated with the @ xmath51 target galaxy . we obtained samples of absorption and emission features after normalizing the data to the continuum level . this level was determined via a linear approximation to the size of the feature of interest . we obtained different continuum levels for each feature with widths between 1 and 3 . we used the pattern - finding code described by @ xcite to identify and measure the boxcar effect in the halo and absorption lines with @ xmath52 ( table [ tab . 1 ] ) . the foreground galaxy halo / disk absorption is an extension to @ xmath53 and is known " an ultrastrong " with @ xcite . @ xmath54 values this value are rare in surveys of galaxies in qso sightlines ; e . g . , galaxies with @ xmath55 make up only 1 % of the number of galaxy absorbers with @ xmath56 @ xcite . although the number of known x - qso galaxy pairs with impact parameters greater than @ xmath57 is quite small , only two of these have @xmath55 . ( we are not comparing the strong - absorber spectra from the results of @ xcite here , as they lack spectroscopic information of the redshifts of the associated galaxies . ) this system also exhibits @ xmath58 and is described as " strong " ( @ xmath59 ) absorber @ xcite . the @ xmath60 of this disk / disk system is among the largest measured for the galaxy in the @ xcite image . we find no evidence of gas ( e . g . , [ ] @ xmath61 ) due to this gas exceeding the size of the background galaxy in either the slitmask or the longslit image . however , the other galaxies shown in the hst image are much smaller and lie at larger radial parameters than the previously identified foreground galaxies . we conclude that the background galaxy is consistent with this galaxy shown in @ xmath62 from the perspective of the background galaxy , where the center is determined from the spectral analysis of the @ xmath29 - 2 image by j . lotz ( 2008 , galaxy analysis ) , using the data described in @ xcite . the background galaxy is one of the brightest galaxiesin the @ xmath27 - star in the tkrs @ xcite has its redshift and " among the bluest stars in the blue cloud " in the galaxy magnitude - magnitude scale ( cmd ) , as shown in the left section of the [ www . cmd ] . we calculate the star formation rate ( sfr ) of @ xmath63 using the luminosity of the h @ xmath64 object measured by @ xcite and assuming an @ xcite dust density curve with a v - band of emission @ xmath65 , derived from the solar mass modeling described above . we use model b ##2 to calculate the h @ xmath9 star and apply the definition of @ xcite to convert this to sfr . @ xcite has an oxygen abundance of @ xmath66 , close to the solar mass limit of 8 . 72 . our lris analysis shows a weak [ ] @ xmath67 emission line , which indicates the star is close to an agn ( e . g . , * ? ? ? agn ) may also explain the sfr , and the distribution of the oxygen abundance . because the [ ] line is weak ,a close fit to the line profile results in a rest - frame value of @ xmath68 ; this value is within @ xmath69 of the instrumental velocity value at this wavelength . ( the instrumental velocity values reported are calculated by making a weighted least - squares fit of the gaussian to the appropriate emission line and the corresponding continuum and subtracting the instrumental velocity dispersion from the observed value @ xmath70 in quadrature . the regions are found to extend at distance 7 from line center . ) we also observe strong emission that results in a sub - cygni line - profile ( figure [ fig . fullspec ] ) , as well as a number of emission features near the resonance , which we interpret as fine - structure transitions from excited states of . to our knowledge , this is the only known example of _ narrow _ fine - structure transitions from any known spectrum . these emission features may be attributed to agn activity , or perhaps could be attributed to some other molecular mechanism . their origin will be discussed in a later section . to determine the contribution of the agn to the continuum structure , we use @ xcite ##s population synthesis algorithm to generate a set of randomstarburst galaxy spectra . these models model an old stellar population , including a 10 gyr - old nova - burst stellar population ( ssp7 ) with solar metallicity , and the stellar population of an 100 myr - old ongoing galaxy with constant star formation rate . these particular choices of old and young stellar populations are motivated by @ xcite , who use them to model non - starburst galaxies via stellar population modeling . to each of these spectra , we add a featureless power - law component with a variable value to model the agn emission to the galaxy spectrum . we also look for a small amount of dust attenuation , parametrized by @ xmath71 . ( details of the model are available in [ j . fg ] and j . rubin et al . 2009 , in ref . ) the spectrum is fit to by parameters with a value of @ xmath72 that model a strong starburst with a power - law component that contributes less than 30 % of the emission at 4200 in the reference frame . we conclude that the best fit is consistent with a galaxy spectrum that is dominated by intense star formation , rather than agn emission . because of its high surface brightness and a strong blueward of the wavelength@ xmath73 , this galaxy is an excellent and promising candidate for hot gas in foreground regions . at the same time , its spectrum may be used to probe cool gas ( via low - temperature emission ) associated with its own ism and , if not to its own star - forming regions . as noted previously ( see [ www . thepair ] ) , the spectrum of tkrs4389 provides evidence for a substantial amount of hot gas . a quantitative study of the physical properties ( e . g . , velocity , @ xmath10 , effects on the outflow column density , and mass loss rate ) of a large number of galaxies like this one will be undertaken by k . rubin et al . ( 2009 , in preparation ) . 2 . @ xmath74 for tkrs galaxies with @ xmath75 ( left - hand panel ) and @ xmath76 ( right - hand panel ) . background ( tkrs4389 ) and background ( tkrs4259 ) galaxies are marked with a red circle and triangle , respectively . the solid disk separates the main sequence " from the gas cloud " as shown in @ xcite . the central disk lies" the so - called bright sequence " and they correspond to the lower half of the normal spectrum ( e . g . , * ? ? ? [ fig . cmd ] , width = 172 ] and @ xmath77 ; 2 ) . the smoothed intensity values in the data are shown with the dotted line . emission lines and the central regions of balmer absorption lines in the observed spectrum were masked out prior to observation ( these regions are shown in green ) , as the observed spectrum did not show line emission from agn central regions . these regions were not masked out . experiments with 600myr @ xmath78 ##1 . 4gyr can reproduce the observed balmer , l and l ##r absorption in the [ . [ sec . specmodel ] ] kpc . the radial velocity is marked with vertical absorption lines . the central line indicates the continuum level . the rest level of @ xmath4 absorption due to the galactic center is @ xmath5 . we note that these absorption lines are asymmetric at the deepest part of each line . the lines are highly symmetric ( see [ sec . psb _ scenario ] ) and have energies of @ xmath79 % of the continuum level . this is one ofand @ xmath10 for dust clouds of @ xmath80 . [ fig . fgspecstamps ] ] the structure of this galaxy also allows us to determine the halo properties of the foreground galaxy using the impact parameter of @ xmath3 kpc . to understand these properties in detail , we must present an image of the central halo of the background galaxy . tkrs4259 is a young ( @ xmath8 , where @ xmath81 is the stellar number ; @ xcite ) , relatively luminous galaxy , located in the " gap " between the red sequence and the dust cloud of the @ xmath82 galaxy . @ xmath74 cmd ( figure [ fig . cmd ] ; * ? ? ? although the gini / m20 data ( j . lotz , 2008 , galaxy communication ) indicates tkrs4259 is an early - type galaxy , it shows evidence of a disturbed gas and dust ##iness in all of the hst / im images ( i . e . , a low surface brightness halo feature ; figure [ fig . im ] ) . both its location in the cmd and its shape indicate the galaxy may be evolving from a primitive pre -forming up to a fully quenched state . tkrs emission of both @ xmath74 and above have approximately 2 oxygen # ##s greater @ xcite . the [ ] , @ xmath83 , and [ ] emission - line emission for this galaxy are measured by @ xcite and are listed in table [ tab . photinfo ] . we also have narrow [ ] @ xmath67 emission with in - frame emission of @ xmath84 ( see table [ tab . ref ] ) , so this galaxy hosts an agn . before calculating the sfr based on the @ xmath83 and [ ] luminosities , we consider the lower agn due to this narrow emission line emission . the observed luminosity ratio [ ] @ xmath85 ; the ratio falls well below the [ ] @ xmath86 ratio of adams ( at lower values ) and seyferts ( at higher values ) in the system of star regions described above , e . g . , @ xcite , @ xcite and @ xcite . unfortunately , we do not have emission lines of [ ] and @ xmath87 and can onlystrictly , this counts as a binary . however , because [ ] / h @ xmath9 is correlated with metallicity in star - forming galaxies , and because there is a tight relation between mass and metallicity in these galaxies ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ) , we can use @ xmath81 as a proxy for [ ] / h @ xmath9 . this is illustrated in figure 2 of @ xcite , which shows a correlation between a @ xmath88 - band color and absolute [ ] / h @ xmath9 and [ ] / h @ xmath64 in the dwarf galaxies . our foreground galaxy is viewed from the center of star - forming galaxies in [ ] / h @ xmath64 - @ xmath81 space , with a @ xmath89 ratio higher than in galaxies with similar [ ] / h @ xmath64 ratios in the tkrs . it also meets the agn criterion of r . yan et al . ( 2009 , in astronomy ) , we find that @ xmath82 space may serve as a proxy for [ ] / h @ xmath9 as well . we find that liner or agnactivity exceeds the observed line emission . in addition , @ xcite has an x - ray emission of @ xmath90 for this object . this luminosity is low enough to be produced by star formation ; however , based on our measurements of the emission spectrum , we attribute the x - ray emission to weak agn emission . we do not , however , rule out recent star formation based on this information alone . the upper limit on the sfr is that @ xmath83 emission is due to star formation ( and taking the distance @ xmath71 from the range derived from stellar mass counts , @ xmath91 , as discussed above ) , is @ xmath92 . we measure a velocity dispersion of @ xmath93 for this object , and conclude that a line of this width may originate from weak agn , since the emission from agn has been found to have approximately the same velocity dispersion as the emission of the agn from galaxies @ xcite . in order to further determine the rate of current and future star formation , we use synthetic starburst spectra as described in [ 2 . bg ] . discussed above , these spectra include a 1 . 0 g##yr - old short - burst star model ( ssp7 ) of stars @ xmath94 with solar metallicity ( @ xmath95 ) and # @ myr - old model with solar sfr which shows solar activity in stars @ xmath96 . we generate a new set of models with supersolar metallicity ( @ xmath97 ) . the spectrum of the signal is parametrized by @ xmath98 , where @ xmath99 ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ) . we generate models with @ xmath100 and match them to the lris spectrum of the host galaxy at 5620 @ xmath101 7550 ( see the [ ref . specmodel ] ) . we do not find the portion of the signal blueward of this range , because it is on the opposite side of the d560 dichroic , and because it lacks spectral information useful for understanding star formation processes . the portion redward of this range is quite noisy and is sensitive to atmospheric pressure . for this reason , we find the best - fit value of @ xmath102 , with the attenuation curve parametrized by @ xcite, by performing a @ xmath45 experiment . the models do not include uv or agn line lines , and these lines in the data are masked out prior to analysis . we find that the solar and sub - solar metallicity model spectra do not simultaneously match the values of the balmer absorption and the g and # ##n absorption in the data . the addition of a gravitational power - output ( qso ) component ( @ xmath103 with @ xmath104 ; * ? ? ? * ) does not improve the resolution significantly . these results suggest that there is still ongoing star formation in this galaxy . a strictly passively evolved model is left out by the results as well . we also need to investigate possible star formation histories . a possible star formation history that repeats itself , based on the position of the galaxy in the cmd as well as its morphology , is one in which the galaxy existed passively for several million years and then experienced a period of star formation , which has since ceased . we again examine a series of solar metallicity models , all with an ssp which occurred 1 gyr ago . a model with an sfr lasting 5 myr is added to each model at the time @ xmath105 ,where @ xmath105 varies between 1 . 8 gyr ago and 1 myr ago . as shown below , this range of burst age reflects the range in values for models which provide a better fit to the data . values are high @ xmath106 . we look for the value of the qso power - law continuum component as shown above . we find the best - fit value of @ xmath71 and the fraction of light contributed by the power - law component at 1 @ xmath45 for each model in our sample . we do a visual inspection of the fit of each model , and find that models with intermediate @ xmath105 values and low values of @ xmath98 are most effective in fitting the deep balmer components and k and l - absorption components to the data . the best - fit model has a high value of @ xmath98 ( @ xmath107 ; other models give lower values ) and a 1 gyr - ago value ; this model is shown in figure [ 2 . specmodel ] . the best - fit value of @ xmath108 , and the fraction of the total light contributed by the power - law component at 4200 inthe time - series is @ xmath109 . models with @ xmath110 , with @ xmath111 and @ xmath112 , and with @ xmath113 can not simultaneously fit the balmer , r and l band absorption ##s and thus yield poor fits . models with @ xmath114 yield good fits if @ xmath98 is large enough at older ages , with the range of values @ xmath71 being between 0 and 0 . 5 . we find that a starburst occurred in the galaxy between 1 . 4gyr and 600myr ago . the results are similar for @ xmath97 models . + in summary , we find that the foreground galaxy is host to a low mass agn and has a temperature continuum consistent with that of a post - starburst galaxy . it has an elliptical morphology and is " in the rift valley " of the cmd . we note that the behavior of this object in the @ xmath115 model is in fact consistent with that of the galaxy in @ xmath116 before the final merger @ xcite . these results can be explained by a model in which the galaxyrecently experienced a burst which caused a starburst . the starburst then ceased , perhaps because the hot gas inside was exhausted and expelled . in this case , the gas will migrate to the red region . + from our observations of the background galaxy ( tkrs4389 ) which is also the orbital parameter of @ xmath117 , we identify strong , , and absorption from gas associated with the solid lines . a subset of these features are shown in figure [ ref . fgspecstamps ] with values corresponding to the systemic spectrum of tkrs4259 . the spectrum obtained was obtained with the slitlet associated with the solid lines in figure [ fig . im ] ; however , the spectrum associated with the longslit ( marked with solid lines in figure [ fig . im ] ) exhibits several absorption line features with similar depths and shapes to those observed . the resulting @ xmath4 spectrum is therefore : @ xmath53 . the optical strengths of the lines in the doublet have a ratio 2 : 1 , and as the optical strength of the lines increases and they disappear , the absorption ratio of the doublet increases from 2 : 1 to 3 : 1 . thethe ratio of the lines in our spectrum is @ xmath118 , indicating a high degree of saturation . in the case of heavily coupled lines , the @ xmath54 ratio is indicative of complex kinematics , i . e . , a large velocity component of @ xmath119 @ xcite . with such a large impact parameter , it is possible that our line of sight is probing gas in the outer disk of the galaxy . however , even if the galaxy were edge - on ( it is not ) , the predicted differential rotation of the disk at this impact parameter would be of the order of few degrees of @ xmath120 . we conclude that the gas dynamics are caused by non - uniform motions and that the movement of gas is extraplanar , i . e . , tracing back in the direction of tkrs4259 . because the lines are strongly coupled , the intensity of the lines depends both on the fraction of the background dark energy that is absorbed by the gas ( @ xmath10 ) and the spectral resolution . the deepest parts of the line profiles from the spectrum associated with the under _ both _ orientations reach @ xmath79 % of the continuum level , which indicates a non -@ xmath121 . the very low energy resolution of the profiles , and the deepest parts of the spectra may in fact be at much higher energy resolution than when observed at higher resolutions . this constraint of @ xmath10 is particularly significant given the large beam size provided by the host galaxy : the distance between the two brightest knots in this galaxy is @ xmath122 kpc and @ xmath0 . this would suggest that the background gas complex almost completely surrounds the light source and has a large velocity dispersion at all the locations involved . this is consistent with previous results from @ xcite , which report velocity variations in the spectrum on @ xmath123 kpc scales . we leave the analysis of the effect of such a large beam size on the observed absorption to a future study ( although see @ xcite for an explanation of the effect of grb vs . qso beam size on the spectrum studies ) . here we examine several possible scenarios for the formation of the gas in the foreground galaxy halo . in the galaxy formation scenario proposed by @ xcite and @ xcite , @ xmath124 clouds rise out of the background gas in the halo as it cools . the gasdensity of these clouds is half that of the galaxy itself ; we may therefore estimate the total halo - non - absorbing energy as the halo mass for the galaxy . using the relation between halo mass and halo velocity derived in @ xcite via the " matching " method , we estimate that the halo mass ( @ xmath125 ) of the cool cloud is @ xmath126 for @ xmath127 . using the relation between @ xmath125 and the virial mass given in @ xcite and assuming a singular ##ity model for the halo mass distribution , we find that the mean fwhm of the line - of - sight velocity distribution for cool clouds in a halo this massive is @ xmath128 . this model could then produce a @ xmath129 @ xcite , consistent with the model @ xmath54 for this galaxy . the thermal expansion analysis of the hot gas surrounding galaxies performed in @ xcite showed that in the case of an expanding halo more massive than that of the milky way ( @ xmath130 ; * ? ? ? * ) , the highly dense , gaseous halo is stable to thermal expansion and therefore does notand into cool clouds . however , this study does not account for the amount of heat inflow from the igm ; nor does the assumption of a very hot outer medium necessarily apply in this case , given that our own halo is a merger region . the three - dimensional cosmological simulations of @ xcite show that even in regions well " the transition " mass ( @ xmath131 ) , in which hot , virialized atmospheres form via shock - waves during the accretion , cold flows of gas from the outer medium ( igm ) can penetrate deep into the hot core . at high redshifts ( @ xmath132 ) , these cold flows reach the host star and cause star formation . unlike @ xmath133 , in the case of a @ xmath134 star , the filaments penetrate to and about the virial envelope , and can fragment into large , cold clouds via collisions , cooling instabilities , or other mechanisms . if these clouds are virialized within the halo , they will have a high density , and form a large @ xmath135 , as discussed above . however , we do not consider cold flows from theigm to determine the most likely source of the red ##dened gas we found . however , our detection of @ xmath136 @ xmath4 halo emission and @ xmath137 red ##t emission in this gas ( as shown in [ fig . thepair ] ; see the figure [ fig . fgspecstamps ] and in [ fig . 2 ] ) may suggest that the surrounding gas is enriched with gas and dust . we can not measure the metallicity and metal content of this gas directly , because we lack the necessary spectral coverage . however , strong absorption lines in the redshift of @ xmath138 have been shown to strongly redden at qsos @ xcite ; however , the degree of reddening increases with @ xmath135 . @ xcite shows that for those with @ xmath139 and @ xmath51 , the average light - intensity @ xmath140 ( see their figure 18 ) . they also find that absorbers with @ xmath56 have an average dust - to - metals ratio similar to those found in the milky way ism . similar results for the average dust - to - metals ratio of strong stars have been reported by@ xcite , we additionally show that dust content increases with increasing @ xmath60 ( see * * ? ? ? ) noted that , the absorption we see has an @ xmath60 value as large as the observed values in these data . these results suggest that there may be a substantial amount of dust in this system . however , we do not see the dust particles because of our low spatial resolution ( @ xmath141 ) ; however , we note that the sight line profiles in figure [ fig . fgspecstamps ] show that . @ xcite find that cool gas clouds , such that the dust content is proportional to the total mass contained in the isothermal spherical halo tend to have a symmetric velocity profile , although this depends on the number of absorbing particles in the halo and the particular sightline profile . both the relatively high dust content of the absorption spectrum and the degree of asymmetry suggest an alternate origin for the observed cool gas . we also consider whether the observed cool gas could have either originated in the ism of the parent galaxy or progenitor galaxies which had formed during a previous starburst , merger or an agn event . if this event occurred @ xmath137 gyr ago( as is ##m ; see [ ref . psb _ 1 ] ) , cool clouds would have had to reach speeds of only @ xmath142 to reach a projected size of @ xmath3 kpc today , where @ xmath143 is the angle between the plane of the cloud and the direction taken by the gas . cool clouds commonly reach speeds in excess of @ xmath144 in starburst galaxies @ xcite and have even been observed in non - starburst galaxies at high redshifts @ xcite . the gas which has been tidally stripped from the cool cloud of this stripping process can also give rise to enriched halo lines with size @ xmath54 , provided that the gas spread in the stripped clouds is large enough @ xcite . the magellanic cloud , for instance , has a velocity distribution of @ xmath145 @ xcite , and so could not produce the large @ xmath54 in the absence of other gas . additionally , the mixing of the gas or its tails could also produce enriched halo line profiles . we assume that the gas which is stripped or stripped out of the galactic star -forming gas during a past starburst , merger or agn phase is a possible origin for this phenomenon . if in reality the gas originated in a cold inflow or merger , as discussed in [ cf . multiphase ] , our finding that the galaxy experienced a starburst @ xmath137 gyr , is simply a coincidence , and is not necessarily related to the actual ejected gas . we note that it is unlikely that there was an expulsion of ism , since there is no current star formation activity in the galaxy , and the observed agn phase is weak . therefore , in this scenario , if the absorbed gas was ejected or stripped , it is likely to have remained cold for approximately 1 gyr , i . e . , since the starburst occurred . the analysis of @ xcite suggests that ejected _ hot _ gas could not have cooled by condensation , although again , the assumptions made in that analysis do not apply in this case . some gas being ejected or ejected from the ism and moving through a cold medium may be due to the einstein - rosen instability . @ xcite showed that thermal fluctuations on the surface of a cloud do not completely disrupt the cloud unless its cooling time is longer than its star crossing time. at @ xcite , we find an isothermal halo with temperature @ xmath146 and with a density profile @ xmath147 , where @ xmath148 is the total baryon density @ xcite , and @ xmath149 is the maximum rotation velocity of the halo ( equal to the virial velocity in this case ; see @ xcite for details ) . we find that the cool atoms arrive at @ xmath150 and that they immediately go into pressure equilibrium with the surrounding neutral gas as soon as they leave the cloud . the sound crossing time for the cloud is given by the ratio of the cloud pressure to the cloud rotation velocity ( @ xmath151 ) . to calculate the cooling time of the cloud , we use equation derived from @ xcite . we find that the sound crossing time exceeds the cooling time by at least one order of magnitude for clouds with temperature @ xmath152 equal to the maximum virial velocity ( @ xmath153 kpc ) . we conclude that these clouds must be stable against the kelvin - lambert instability . we also note that the atoms at the upper end of this temperature range are evaporated by conduction at timescales of @xmath154 gyr , where the time timescale is given by = 1 in @ xcite . if we assume that the hot gas temperature does not change substantially with time , we can conclude that cold gas released into the halo from the sun during a starburst or merger event @ xmath137 gyr ago should remain cold throughout , and last for at least 1 gyr longer . outflow during the same starburst , merger or other agn event may have been powered by a variety of mechanisms . the galaxy formation hypothesis advocated above ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) suggests that in a helium rich past , gas is driven to the center of the galaxies once they have coalesced , causing the starburst ##s and black hole growth and producing a hot qso . energy from nuclear reactions is also used to drive outflows during starburst ##s ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and could have contributed all of the energy needed to accelerate the cool gas to velocities of @ xmath155 . simulations of major galaxies @ xcite show that they can produce a super - heated gas wind ,thus forcing cool gas into the halo . in addition , material from the galaxy that was tidally stripped during the merger event would have been left behind at large scale parameters . thus , the merger agn could have contributed to forcing cool gas into the galactic halo and to the quenching of star formation . in the @ xcite scenario , the phase in which the original ism material is blown away and the qso is revealed is expected to occur within a few hundred myr of the merger itself . the phase in which the qso has disappeared and the merger material reddens and forms the post - starburst galactic halo occurs @ xmath156 after the merger . our observations of the star formation history , evolution , and evolution of this galaxy fit well into this scenario . however , we note that we have the strongest evidence that the galaxy is post - starburst ; the occurrence of a quasar merger is highly unlikely . we also consider whether clouds ejected from the galaxy would have a large spread of velocities of @ xmath157 1 gyr after the starburst event has ceased . to determine this , we use a toy model of the behavior of the outflowing gas in the halo itself . to start, we follow @ xcite and find that the velocity ( @ xmath158 ) of the outflowing gas as a function of distance from the starburst point ( @ xmath159 ) is given by @ xmath160 , where @ xmath161 is the radial velocity dispersion , @ xmath162 is the upper limit of the starburst velocity required to cover a certain amount of the galactic halo , when it is sufficiently large , and @ xmath163 is the angular velocity of the gas . this equation applies until the terminal point is reached , @ xmath164 . for @ xmath165 , @ xmath166 kpc and @ xmath167 , the gas is accelerated to speeds of @ xmath168 kpc during a 1 myr - long starburst . the results are similar to the results of @ xmath169 as well as @ xmath170 ; however , @ xmath171 and @ xmath163 both have values such that the gas does not fall back onto the halo in 1 gyr . if @ xmath##166 kpc , values of @ xmath172 are viable ; if @ xmath163 is viable , the higher values of @ xmath173 cover larger distances and are large enough so that they remain in the halo for the necessary amount of time . we now assume that the starburst stops abruptly , and that the clouds from the wind are therefore subject only to the gravitational potential of the halo , and not the effects of drag resulting from the surrounding hot halo gas . by combining the equations of motion for clouds with mass @ xmath174 kpc and with the velocity given by the above equation for @ xmath158 , we calculate the final positions and distances after 1 gyr . a new trajectory for the cloud with an opening angle of @ xmath175 is assumed , consistent with measurements of the opening angle of the outflow cones found in h @ xmath9 and the one in m82 ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , so that our line of sight crosses both outflow cones and is parallel to the axis passing through the center of the halo . we assume the line - of -sight velocities for the clouds that are at a projected distance of @ xmath176 kpc between 1 and 2 gyr . the velocity spread is well above @ xmath177 at all time increments . while this model is somewhat rudimentary , it suggests that clouds coming out of the galaxy 1 gyr away may have the largest velocity spread that is expected , and that they will maintain this large spread for at least another 2 gyr . from all of the evidence discussed above , we conclude that the absorption spectrum is most likely from fragments of the dust from the merger that we observe . this dust may have been ejected by a wind generated by a starburst , merger , or agn , or tidally stripped from the surrounding galaxies . if all these clouds originated in the ism , this is one of the first indications of the radial extent of such ejected or tidally stripped clouds in the distant universe and suggests that it reaches far beyond the stellar envelope . because the clouds we observe are likely dusty ( see [ sec . 2 ] ) , this mechanism may be responsible for limiting the diffuse dust detected in galaxy halos to angular sizes much larger than the size of galacticdisks @ xcite . a complementary technique which has recently been used to study the host galaxies of blue stars measures the halo mass of a large sample of absorbers with respect to that of the background stars ( lrgs ) , to determine the mean halo mass at which absorbers of different types are present . these studies have shown that there is a strong anticorrelation between @ xmath135 and the density of systems at @ xmath179 . this has been interpreted as an anticorrelation with the mean halo mass , measured at the 1 @ xmath70 level ; i . e . , absorbers with 1 . 5 @ xmath180 1 . 5 have mean halo mass @ xmath181 , and @ xmath182 absorbers have mean halo mass @ xmath183 ( @ xcite ; see also @ xcite and @ xcite ) . the number of @ xmath184 absorbers in these studies is very small ; however , the @ xmath185 we use for our foreground images , while larger than the mean halo mass of strong absorbers mentioned above , is well below the uncertainties in the calculation of the mean halo mass for_ both _ weak and strong _ ( see figure 7c , * ? ? ? ) explanation proposed by @ xcite for the origin of strong absorbers is that cool gas is drawn into galactic halos via starburst - like winds . these authors argue that winds are more likely to pull gas from galactic halo in more potential wells , and therefore expect strong absorption to be preferentially found in low - mass halos . @ xcite argues , however , that the origin of strong absorbers is _ unbiased _ with respect to dark matter , and thus strong absorption does not occur preferentially in lower masses . however , the present study provides one example of strong absorption which is most likely due to past collisions or impact events in a high mass ( @ xmath186 ) halo . our conclusion is that while galactic winds may be an important source of cool dark matter , they should not necessarily be the main contributor to only low mass halo , and indeed _ they _ also occur preferentially in high mass halo if they are to fully explain the bias results of @ xcite . this alternative picture was inspired by simulations of , e . g . , @ xcite and @ xcite , which provide support for the" " halo mass , above which cold gas is greatly enriched as it is blown onto a star as discussed in [ cf . multiphase ] . @ xcite shows that an anticorrelation between @ xmath125 and @ xmath135 , as well as the observed frequency response of absorbers , can be observed in a gas occupation model which includes only the transition mass , so that the most massive halos are far too cold to form at @ xmath54 . lower mass halos contain more cool gas and can give rise to high @ xmath54 systems . as shown in @ xcite , cold flows can then pass through the hot gas in the halo at @ xmath187 and form cold gas , which can even then fuel future star formation . since our universe is unusual in that it is post - starburst , the existence of the _ enriched _ @ xmath188 system in a halo with " mass well beyond the transition mass " is consistent with this picture , and if the cold gas is indeed an halo , implies that ( 1 ) the effects of star formation on halo gas are observed well into the temperature range in which hot gas largely dominates the cold gas accret##ion , or ( * ) , is a spread - transition mass for the galaxy halos . through multiwavelength analysis of the luminous components of a galaxy at @ xmath0 in conjunction with observations of a bright , close - background source at @ xmath2 , we demonstrate that the halo gas produced by absorption in the foreground hot halo with impact parameter @ xmath189 kpc most likely originated in the core of the present galaxy or its progenitors . this galaxy has no ongoing star formation and exhibits only weak agn emission ; however , it experienced a starburst @ xmath137 gyr ##o , which may have been caused by a merger event . the hot halo gas could have easily been driven or pushed away from the star - forming regions during this early merger event , and could have remained in the hot halo since that time . our rudimentary toy model for the presence of clouds driven into the halo by a past starburst suggests that these clouds would have a relative abundance at @ xmath190 today , consistent with our observations . we conclude that the analysis of the luminous components of this galaxy achieves an unprecedented level of detail in the field of studies of the absorption - selected galaxieswith @ xmath191 . such data is important because of the extensive dataset available as well , including the galaxy images from tkrs @ xcite and our lris data . we were able to identify the post - starburst and pre - date it from this dataset ; previous works could not even find such a source , and instead present a more complete view of the host galaxies of these stars . @ xcite searched for @ xmath87 emission near @ xmath192 absorbers and @ xmath133 to investigate the starburst galaxy for absorption ; this data can not be used to find other galaxies without @ xmath87 emission , such as post - starbursts with weak agn activity . @ xcite investigated environments of @ xmath193 galaxies by measuring the corresponding qso fields ; however , they lacked spectroscopic confirmation of strong - star sources and have not determined the star formation history of their sources . our research only aims to demonstrate the power of cosmic background light to probe foreground background gas . several large scale studies have recently concluded they are nearing conclusions that can be used to identify galaxies suitable for a targeted search for foreground2 . spectroscopic imaging with an instrument such as lris requires that the background source be red and blue so that the high signal - to - noise ratio of @ xmath194 to @ xmath195 can be acquired in a reasonable short time ( i . e . , @ xmath196 takes less than 2 hours ) . this @ xmath197 is needed to achieve a @ xmath198 ew detection ratio of 0 . 5 for a star at @ xmath179 . there are @ xmath199 galaxy pairs with redshifts obtained as part of the deep2 survey of the extended groth system ( egs ) with similar separations @ xmath200 @ xcite which meet these requirements . surveys such as deep - x @ xcite and zcosmos @ xcite will provide pair candidates with distances of the same order as deep2 , as will the new vimos vlt survey @ xcite . the new surveyeisenste / r / [ . html ] @ xcite will measure galaxy distances over 1000 square degrees and should enable selection of over 1500 galaxy pairs . the inter - galactic survey , which will measure 1200 square degrees in diameterfilters to @ xmath201 , will provide an unprecedented number of possible redshifts . using the average sampling rate and the average background sampling rate of the egs ##s of the deep2 survey @ xcite to reduce the number of galaxy pairs to that expected from a normal survey , and additionally scale back the 2400 - fold increase in sky brightness with pan - starrs , we expect that @ xmath202 galaxy pairs will be available for detailed analysis . the use of filters as background probes is complementary to that of grb sightlines , which have a negligible apparent size but will allow for detailed analysis of the galaxy host @ xcite . under good seeing conditions and with extended background galaxies , one can see multiple sightlines through a large foreground halo . size scales larger than @ xmath203 kpc and @ xmath204 are not currently accessible because of technical limitations . however , with improved optics and ifus on 10m - aperture telescopes and binoculars , spatially extended background galaxies will allow study of the morphology and distribution of halo absorption in conjunction with detailed analysis of the optical properties of their hosts . the authors want to thank dr . tremonti forfor providing her stellar line modeling code , m . cooksey for providing her stellar line -
