stephan s quintet ( hereafter sq ) is a strongly interacting compact galaxy which has produced a highly energetic intragroup medium ( igm ) @ xcite through a long sequence of collisions and harrassment @ xcite . this interaction has caused a large - scale gravitational shock - heating , first observed as a narrow filament in the radio continuum @ xcite , and subsequently detected in the x - ray @ xcite . the high - energy ( @ xmath61000 or ( @ xmath13 ) interaction of an intruder galaxy , ngc 7318b , with the intergalactic component of the continuum @ xcite is thought to be responsible for the shock - heating of the x - ray background gas . the emission line lines and observed broad linewidths provide evidence that the region is characterized by strong interactions and not star formation ( xu et al . 2003 ; duc et al . 2010 , in press ) . the main features of stephan s quintet are shown in figure 1 . central to the region is the primary shock , as indicated by the 20 cm radio wave amplitude . ngc 7318b , the intruder galaxy , lies to the north of the shock , and the large seyfert 2 galaxy @ xcite ,lies to the south . other members of the group are also interacting . the peculiar extranuclear star forming region , the sq - a @ xcite , lies at the extreme northern end of the main shock zone . ngc 7318a ( prototype of ngc 7318b ) is also a strongly interacting group member , with ngc 7317 moving away from the core . the recent discovery of extremely powerful , non - molecular h @ xmath9 line emission from the center of the h @ xcite , using the _ spitzer _ telescope _ @ xcite , has generated new observations of the sq system . the molecular line emission was found with a line emission of the x - ray luminosity from the core . the mid - infrared ( mir ) h @ xmath9 linewidth was found ( @ xmath14 870 , s @ xmath13 ) showing that the h @ xmath9 - type stars have a high bulk - kinetic energy , representing a large percentage of the energy available in the system . a recent model of sq , involving the interaction of two inhomogeneous gas giants , describes h @ xmath9 formation out of the multiphase , dense gas , and highly efficient cooling mechanism forhigh - energy shocks are an alternative to x - ray sources @ xcite since the sq detection , many other systems with similarly strong h @ xmath9 emission have been observed . @ xcite shows that a large - subset of the local 3cr cluster galaxies have the strong mir rotational h @ xmath9 emission , often measured against a very weak thermal continuum . the low agn and star formation rates are insufficient to explain the mir h @ xmath5 emission . mechanical shock caused by the gas jet associated with the sq galaxy , is the dominant mechanism . in addition , mir h @ xmath9 luminosities in the range @ xmath15 to s @ xmath13 have been detected in several small cluster galaxies close to @ xmath16 ( * ? ? ? * m . de messieres - university of paris , radio communication ) and in others in s @ xcite . the study of nearby prototypes may provide some insight into the nature of these very rare sources . the large scale ( @ xmath6 30 kpc ) of the sq system is well - suited for such a study . in this regard also , we compare the single star observations of @ xcite to the spectral maps ofsq using the irs instrument on the _ spitzer _ space telescope , _ _ spitzer _ . in section ii , we will present the three - dimensional radial coordinates of the h @ xmath5 region on the face of the x - ray emitting galaxy , and compare them with ours . in addition , several other papers are being published by our team which will show the relationship between the h / x - ray emission and emission from dust . in section 2 , we present our observations and data reduction methods . in section 3 we present the mapping results for various detected objects . in sections 4 , 5 and 6 we present our discussion on the properties of the shock and in section 7 the implication for galaxy formation . in section 8 we present our observations . additional information is presented as well , with a discussion on ngc 7319 in appendix a , and a reanalysis of the high energy mir model of the shock , as well as renanalysis of the x - ray emission lines in appendix b and c , respectively . in this paper , we present the systemic velocity of @ xmath17 for the shock , corresponding to a distance of 1 mpc with @ xmath18 . near - infrared spectroscopy of the shock region of sq was performed bythe 3d instrument @ xcite onboard _ spitzer _ . results were done in low - resolution mapping mode , using the short - low ( @ xmath19 ; @ xmath20 ) and long - high ( @ xmath21 ; @ xmath22 ) modules and published on december 10 2008 and december 10 2007 , respectively . figure 1 displays the outline of the area observed superimposed on a 3d model of the shock . the sl ##o mapping consists of two different , but identical maps , oriented north and south of the x - ray emission associated with the shock . the map was constructed with 23 steps of 2 . 0 ( 0 . 75 @ xmath2 slit width ) perpendicular to the slit and one parallel step of 2 . 2 . it consists of 60s integrations with 5 cycles per step . the ll map was used to map an area of @ xmath23 using 23 steps of 2 . 0 ( 0 . 75 @ xmath2 slit width ) perpendicular to the slit and a parallel step of 24 . 2 . an integration time of 24 was obtained with 5 cycles per step . the data processing was done by the _ spitzer _ science _ ( ssc ) software , version s17 . 2 . 0 and s##17 . 2 . 0 for sl and ll respectively , which include standard techniques such as curve correction , dark background , and flat - fielding . the sampling for ll data was done by subtracting stray off - source observations , with the same sampling mode , almost immediately after the sampling sequence . in the case of sl , where for scheduling , the dedicated ` ` local ' ' observations were too far away in time to be optimal , images were taken from observations at the periphery of the map that showed no spectral line signatures . examination of the data products revealed that the stray - off - source images ( that account for the reflections from the bottom - up arrays onto the sl1 / 2 spectral lines ) showed wavelength - based over - correlation in some of the images , possibly due to the high concentration of stray rays during the sl portion of the mapping . to negate this problem , the same flat - fielded images ( also available from the science pipeline ) that are uncorrected for sl and straylight correction were used . it was found that after background subtraction , the uncorrected stray light in the higher spectral extraction areas was still at the @ xmath24 % level . the stray - light correction was unne##ccesary , and the subsequent basic calibrated digital ( bcd ) images , were of higher resolution than the original bcds . for all images , the frames for the pointing were re - combined and the ` ` bad ' ' pixels were removed using customised software that allowed for an ` ` average ' ' resolution . the images were converted into spectral maps for each point using the software tool , called @ xcite . further , pixel removal was performed within minutes . spectral maps were obtained by placing continuum maps on either side of a feature and subtracting the resulting continuum map from the corresponding emission line map . one dimensional spectra were then extracted from the data , using matched apertures . narrow - band images at 12 and 24 @ xmath25 ghz were obtained with the _ spitzer _ optical _ peak - resolution imager ( pui ) and the mips instrument . the pui was used in a 5 x 5 experiment with 5 cycles of 30s duration each on 2007 july 29 . the optical instrument @ xcite on _ spitzer _ performed further measurements of sq on 2008 july 29 , at a spatial resolution of @ xmath66 . further data collection was performed by the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc )science pipeline ( version s18 . 0 . 2 ) ran through the mopex software , and for the final image a smooth , flat background was further used to correct for the large - scale background effects . _ spitzer _ irac 3 . 0 , 5 . 5 , 5 . 0 and 6 . 0 pixels of sq ( e . g . houck ) were obtained from the ssc data ; these were reduced using science pipeline version s18 . 0 . 3 . the final images had a sample size of 0 . 5 . the internal excited state of molecular clouds can be excited by several mechanisms . these include fuv ( magnetic field ) proton pumping , and possible additional collisional heating , of the h @ xmath5 via photodissociation events associated with star formation ( e . g . black & van dishoeck 1987 , hollenbach & tielens 1997 ) , hard x - rays penetrating and heating regions within molecular clouds , which in turn excite h @ xmath5 via collisions with electrons in the atoms ( lepp & mccray 1983 ; draine & smith 1992 ) and additional collisional heating of h @ xmath5 due to acceleration produced by electrons ( e . g . shull & co##llenbach 1978 ) . the three rotational mir ##i ratios are not especially useful tools for distinguishing between these mechanisms since all line ratios alone can lead to well thermalized temperature measurements of low - temperature rotational states . the rotational h @ xmath5 level lines do , however , allow us to detect gas at different temperatures and compare with model predictions ( this will be the main focus of paper 2 ) . the level lines from - - s ( 1 ) - s ( 5 ) tend to detect warmer gas , whereas the s ( 2 ) and s ( 1 ) lines are sensitive to the ` ` coolest ' ' of h @ xmath5 . although the line ratios themselves can not be interpreted directly as physical mechanisms , in stephan s quintet the combination of large - scale x - ray and radio emission , plus the emission line ratios , provide strong evidence that the gas filament observed in paper 1 is the result of a gravitational shock . in wang et al . ( 2006 ) this fact was used to reveal the surprising association of detected h @ xmath5 emission with the shock . however , in this paper we can see a more direct association of the emission with the shock by means of spectral maps . the spectral maps were used to extract images ofall the pure rotational emission lines of molecular hydrogen that were observed , including the 0 - z s ( 0 ) 28 . 05 , s ( 1 ) 8 . 03 , s ( 2 ) 8 . 05 , s ( 3 ) 8 . 05 , s ( 4 ) 8 . 03 and s ( 5 ) 8 . 03 lines . specific spectral lines ##s of these lines are presented in figure 1 based on the @ xmath26 - 2 image of the region from @ xcite . the s ( 0 ) and s ( 1 ) lines were mapped by the ll modules , while s ( 2 ) - s ( 5 ) lines were mapped by the sl modules of the region . as shown in figure 1 , the sl modules were placed on the main shock to provide high sensitivity to noise ( s / n ) measurements available . as a result , these measurements do not fully cover sq - 1 and ngc 7319 . we note that the s ( 0 ) band at 8 . 03 ( 8 . 2e ) is weak , and it suffers from contamination from the pah bands at 7 . 5 and 8 . 6 . the contours show powerful , widespread winds running north - south along the shock axis ( see fig . 1 ) . in addition we detect theemission from the star forming region , sq - 1 , as well as interaction with ngc 7319 . we discuss the details of the agn - and mir emission lines from ngc 7319 in appendix a . figures 2a - 3 show a new h @ xmath5 structure extending eastward from the ` ` main ' ' galactic plane . in what follows , we refer to this feature as the ` ` bridge ' ' . this structure is observed faintly in the _ chandra _ @ xcite and xmm @ xcite x - ray sources and described as ' h @ xmath27 ##a by @ xcite , but is clearly visible in the telescope images . as is shown in figure 2a , there is distinct variation in the distribution of the faint h @ xmath5 lines . the faint 0 - 0 s ( 0 ) emission ( fig . 2a ) appears to be concentrated towards the north of the bridge , whereas the 1 - 0 s ( 1 ) transition line ( fig . 2b ) is more concentrated towards the south . the s ( 0 ) and s ( 1 ) lines suggest that the h @ xmath5 in the bridge lies in a large region a few degrees south of the center of the seyfert spiral galaxy ngc 7319, and in a small area to the north ( as in the s ( 1 ) map which has the symbol s / n ) . the s ( 1 ) through s ( 5 ) lines clearly show that the strong h @ xmath5 emission breaks into two in the region . despite the limited coverage compared to the ll mapping , the bulk of the ` ` observation ' ' is covered and sq - a is partially covered . sq - a is partially covered by the sl2 map ( because of fortuitous ` ` off ##line ' ' coverage ) and hence the s ( 5 ) emission line shows that in sq - a the h @ xmath5 emission is also clumpy . the two - line maps provide considerable information about the distribution of the h @ xmath5 within and without the x - ray shock , but these discussions will be limited to the detailed 3 - d modelling of the h @ xmath5 emission in section 2 ( appleton et al . , in 1985 ) . thus we shall limit ourselves to the models of the h @ xmath5 here . in section [ ii ] we shall consider models of some local components of the emission and discuss a detailed excitation model for theshock . to further demonstrate the close relationship between the h @ xmath5 line and the main global shock - ridge , sq , we will show the distribution of the h @ xmath5 in relation to the x - ray and hydrogen plasma . figure [ 1 : xray _ 1 ] a and b show the s ( 0 ) and s ( 3 ) contours based on the xmm - resolution x - ray h @ xcite of stephan ##os ##t . the warm molecular plasma is distributed along the axis of the main north - south ( nw ) x - ray - ridge and along the ` ` bridge ' ' , demonstrating the remarkable close relationship of of hot x - ray plasma ( h @ xmath28 @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 10 @ xmath30 k ) and cold h @ xmath5 ( 10 @ xmath31 @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 10 @ xmath32 k ) . although the h @ xmath5 appears to follow the x - ray , there are some differences . the cold s ( 0 ) plasma has been concentrated to the north and follows the x - ray less closely compared to the warmer s ( 3 )line . the s ( 2 ) line shows a close correspondence to the x - rays , notably at the center of the shock , where we find radiation of both types . however the region of greatest shock energy , as indicated by the strongest x - ray emission , appears to correspond to the higher - j h @ xmath5 transitions , thus implying a causal connection . the intergalactic star system , sq - 1 , is essentially absent in x - ray spectra , as shown in the [ fig : xray _ rad ] diagram , but is strongly present in h @ xmath9 . we find a similar picture in the radio continuum ( fig . [ fig : xray _ rad ] c & d ) with the s ( 3 ) line in correspondence with the main shock , but dominated by emission from the region where we find most powerful radio sources . the s ( 3 ) ( and s ( 2 ) , fig . 2c ) line presents a much tighter correspondence with regions of the shock that are more radio luminous than the lower - j regions . the radio emission is quite likely sensitive to the more compressed regions of the shock where cosmic ray sources are interacting more strongly @ xcite , whereas the strongest x - ray sources are cooler due to the fastest regionsof the shock @ xcite . as previously mentioned the ` ` bridge ' ' emission is detected only faintly in the x - rays and is weak and absent at the infrared wavelengths . this spectral difference compared to the main shock likely implies that the lines that give rise to strong synchrotron radiation in the main shock are absent in the bridge . emission from fine - structure lines are key clues that indicate the relationship between the various components of the main shock medium . shock @ xcite the spectra were limited to the very center of the shock and very weak emission was detected from all but two metal lines , namely @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 83 ( this data has been reanalysed and is shown in figure 2 ) . in this section we describe the relative strength of emission from the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 , @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] 26 . 89 , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 95 , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ]12 . 80 , @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 and @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 respectively . in figure [ fig : f ] we present the spectral intensity spectrum of the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 and @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 89 respectively , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 spectral lines . given the high spectral resolution of the sl and ll modules of _ spitzer _ , we can not distinguish the emission from @ xmath10fe ##ii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 48 and @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 . however , looking in the vicinity of the seyfert nebula in ngc 7319 , the emission and infrared spectrum in figure [ fig : f ] , is assumed to be [ @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] with no difference from @ xmath10oiv@ xmath11 $ ] . there is strong evidence from the observation of low - pressure states from the shock region in sq . for example , @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] has an excitation energy of 10 ev ( compared to 0 . 5 ev of @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] ) , and the @ xcite has shown that the @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ratio is due to low - pressure conditions for the gas in the region , as discussed in fig [ 2 ] . note that , starting from towards ngc 7319 , @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] and the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] + @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] region , we have the signals from @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 0 . 1 . the location of the source of the shock ( as indicated by the x - ray ` ` hotspot ' ' in sq . [ fig : xray _ x##d ] . ) . the energy requirements for it to produce strong @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] emission are highly present in @ xmath33 shocks and the energy requirements of @ xmath34 shocks are present in the @ xcite . we will discuss the production of @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] in the region in figure 6 . 2 . the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 emission is shown in figure [ fig : f ] b . this fine emission line acts as the phase boundary of hii regions @ xcite and we see emission from sq - a and from other regions of gas formation in the region ( see section [ sf ] ) . in the main sf region the emission of @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] are time - symmetric . in marked contrast to the [ @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] emission , which produces weak @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 emission ( fig . [ fig : f ] c) , which follows the normal ( s ) distribution closely with respect to the initial shock , as shown by x - ray spectra ( cf . [ fig : ne ] d ) . although @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] is only found in the hii regions , we will note below that , apart from in sq - 1 , the strong silicon distribution does not coincide with regions of strong pah distribution ( during the shock ) in sq , but instead closely follows the normal @ xmath5 and x - ray ( s ) distributions . @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] acts as an effective moderator of x - ray - irradiated materials and is predicted to be one of the top four cooling agents under these conditions @ xcite . we will discuss the role of @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] in the shock , section 6 . 2 . @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 6 . 2 ( with an emission energy of 1 . 5 ev ) is best represented in the shock , as shown by the [ fig : ne ] d , although it is also emitted from some hii regions associated withstar formation , such as sq - a and the star - forming regions south of ngc 7318b ( see section [ sf ] ) . the @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 3 . 5 lines ( with an electric potential of 10 ev ) are shown in figure [ fig : 1 ] , and are associated with events from the shock , as well as from regions of star formation ( see section [ sf ] ) . the higher energy line of @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] is much weaker than the shock line , but regions of emission correspond closely to those seen for the h @ xmath5 s ( 3 ) line . the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] line , however , shows more extended emission with regions of high luminosity than those seen for the h @ xmath5 s ( 3 ) line . the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] emission suggests excitation from the shock , with @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] emission indicating the location of the source of the shock , similar to what was seen for @ xmath10fe##ii @ xmath11 $ ] . the observations and studies of sq @ xcite have shown that there are distinct regions of star formation associated with the spiral arms of the intruder , ngc 7318b . we discuss in this way how these regions , which have a different temperature distribution from the surrounding gas , are associated with the pah distribution we detect in the irs spectra . in figure [ fig : dust ] a there is a strong correlation between the 11 . 3 pah maps ( from the irs spectrum ) and on the near - uv signal from _ galex _ @ xcite , which shows the strong emission from the gas associated with weak star formation from the dust . this correlation indicates that the pah maps are excited by star formation . a similar strong correlation is shown in figure [ fig : dust ] b where we see the 11 . 3 map on the irac infrared spectrum , which is dominated by the 7 . 7 and 8 . 6 @ xmath25 spectral lines . it is possible , however , that regions with strong 11 . 3 emission in the infrared , do not behave similarly as at 8 . this point will be illustrated in figure 1 . 4 . we relate the 11 . 3 pah map to the distribution of warm dustin figure [ fig : dust ] c , showing the same 24 @ xmath25 m image of sq . again , it is shown that there is a good correlation between the pah emission and the thermal dust , most of which seems very poorly associated with the shock wave . the lack of spontaneous star formation in the ridge is also demonstrated by @ xcite . the important point we make here is that the thermal , pah and gas emission appears to be associated with all known star formation regions and no spontaneous star formation is observed in the shock ; this can be seen in figure [ fig : dust ] d showing the h @ xmath5 - - 0 - ( 1 ) image based on an irac satellite image . there is little correlation between the 24 @ xmath5 emission in the shock and h @ xmath25 m ( hot gas plus pah ) image . this is important because it shows that there is very little triggered star formation in the hot gas associated with the non - excited h @ xmath5 . figure [ fig : dust ] c shows that there is also some dust emission at 24 @ xmath25 m from the shock ridge . the presence of dust in the shock is required in the case of guillardet al . ( 2009 ) to investigate the formation of 24 @ xmath5 after the shock and we do observe evidence of melting onto the surface ( see section 6 . 2 ) . thus the faint ##er emission could be the result of destruction of very small grains ( vsgs ) , with the larger grains surviving , which suggests that the grains are cold and radiating uv radiation at longer wavelengths , where _ spitzer _ has the highest spatial resolution . a more detailed understanding of the strong and weak pah emission in the sq region ( including data from mips 70 imaging ) is discussed in separate articles ( guillard et al . 2010 . ; natale et al . 2009 , in preparation ) . guillard et al . ( 2010 ) show that the 24 emission from the shock is faint due to dust being surrounded by a very high intensity uv radiation , and having a galactic pah / vsg abundance low in this region . a more detailed understanding of the likely presence of cool dust behind the shock would require greater spatial resolution and a broader spectral range than that provided by _ spitzer _ . despite the lack of data from the main shock , the 24 @ xmath25 m map presents a better result , which is less than in previous studies ,namely that the dominant regions of star formation in sq lie not in the shocks themselves , but in two very strong , and similarly shaped regions at each end of the shock . the region to the north is the well studied sq - north , while the region to the south ( which we refer to as 7318b - south ) is also very strong and both regions lie at the ends of the shock , as indicated by the h @ xmath5 line . this may not be a coincidence , and we will explain this further in figure 6 . 2 . the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 , @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 15 . 81 and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 micro - grain lines , as mentioned above , are also indicative of star formation in sq as these lines are often associated with hii regions . the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 emission appears to reflect _ both _ the h @ xmath5 and the star formation regions ( see ref . [ fig : 1 ] a ) , appearing more strongly in the south than the [ h @xmath5 emission and pointing to where star formation regions , ngc 7318b - south , are observed optically , and through pah emission ( see ref . [ fig : dust ] ) . the excited molecular hydrogen in stephan s ##n reflects the x - ray heating in the main shock and forms the ` ` bridge ' ' structure . this might suggest that the molecular hydrogen is excited directly by the x - ray heating . however , we also note that the h @ xmath5 emission reduces by at least a factor of 10 the x - ray emission from the main shocked core , thus ruling out direct x - ray excitation from the core . to determine the strength of the h @ xmath5 emission , we used spectra from the rectangular sub - regions of sq which are defined in figure [ fig : ext ] . the spectra were extracted from the data built from each irs core , and so to make a continous spectrum no computer was used to generate the spectra . figure [ fig : ext ] a , b and c represent the spectral extraction ##s of the main ns ##e , shock sub - region of the core and a characteristic part of the ` ` bridge ' ' . the shock sub - region ofappears to be just north of the center of the shock , avoiding regions contaminated by star formation in the shock . spectra for these regions are shown in figures [ fig : spectra ] a , b and c . all these regions , share the common property that they are contaminated by molecular oxygen emission . the shock sub - region ( fig . [ fig : spectra ] b ) , unlike figure [ fig : spectra ] a , is less contaminated by the star forming regions described in the previous section . the mir continuum of the main shock is cooler than the shock sub - region with stronger emission from the dust ; this is probably the result of contamination from star - forming regions in the main shock extraction . the bridge shows a similarly weak infrared emission compared to the shock sub - region . figure [ fig : spectra ] b shows images from the irac camera , 16 cm - intensity image ( pui ) and r - ray images based on the infrared camera . these are used to determine conditions in the shock , in particular star formation ( see fig 1 . 2 ) . stellar light in the extraction area , from an extended spiral arm of ngc 7318b , produces most of the ir spectrum , visible ir and emission shortwards of r , in both ngc 8a and2 . there exists a striking similarity between the mid - ir spectrum of both these regions , showing powerful strong @ xmath5 lines and low intensity weak lines from fine absorption lines . even the pah lines seen in the image of the shock core , and in the image of the ` ` bridge ' ' in the irac ##2 image ( cf . [ fig : 1 ] b ) , appears weak . this suggests that these lines , seen in the @ xcite observations of the shock core , extend to both the full area of the main shock and the ` ` bridge ' ' . this , and the fact that the ` ` bridge ' ' has similar cosmic - ray properties to the main shock ( see later ) suggests that the shock is a ` ` scaled - down ' ' version of the main shock . the weaker seismic wave emission at this location is significant . one possibility , that the ` ` bridge ' ' is larger than the main shock , and the cosmic rays compressed in it have cooled significantly , will be discussed further in paper ii . thus the new seismic observations seem to suggest that more than one large - scale galaxy - wide shock is present in the region . this could be the result of multiple shock heating and imply multiple shock heating events have taken placein sq , consistent with what is seen in the x - rays @ xcite . figures [ fig : ext ] c and [ fig : spectra ] d show the extraction ##s and spectrum of sq - a , the extragalactic star - forming region . in this case , although h @ xmath5 lines are still present , a rising continuum and an increase in the intensity of the metal lines relative to the h @ xmath5 are consistent with a spectrum that is increasingly dominated by star formation , and which is already known from the astronomical observations @ xcite . the values for all the h @ xmath5 and metal lines in the region shown above are shown in figure [ tableh2fluxes ] and table [ tablemetalfluxes ] , respectively . we estimate the luminosity emitted from the h @ xmath5 lines at the maximum as shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] a . the emission from the x - 1 s ( s ) line , can be calculated from figure [ tableh2fluxes ] ( for sq = 94 mpc ) to be 0 . 1 @ xmath210 @ xmath35 ergs @ xmath13 . thus the metal lines in theobserved transitions for the main shock ( 0 - 0 s ( 0 ) , s ( 1 ) , ) and also an extra 1 % emission from other sources ( see external link to excitation diagram below ) , yields a peak h @ xmath5 line emission from the main shock of 9 . 5 @ xmath210 @ xmath35 ergs @ xmath13 . this extra power in the other emission sources increases by a factor of two the next highest low - ir line , which [ @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 5 with a peak emission of [ @ xmath36 = 9 . 5 @ xmath210 @ xmath35 ] @ xmath13 . figure [ 1 : excite ] presents the excitation diagram of the low - j ##0 - 0 h @ xmath5 line for the main shock extraction . the points are then represented in a graph with three additional components ( t @ xmath37 = 158 @ xmath38k , t @ xmath9 = 412 @ xmath39k , and t @ xmath40 = 1500 @ xmath41k ). it is clear that in sq , many different heat sources are present in the shock , and the two - dimensional map is only an approximation . however , it does allow us to obtain an estimate of the total mass of the h @ xmath5 of 1 . 5 @ xmath4210 @ xmath43m @ xmath44 . temperature h @ xmath9 is more complex than formally described in the paper because it depends on the value of the s ( t ) value , which may be systematically too low due to pah contamination ( see fig . [ 2 : 1 ] ) . in phase ii we will present a more detailed two - dimensional map of the motion of the h @ xmath5 in sq and the changes in the shape of the excitation diagram within and across the shock in more detail . our observations have shown that h @ xmath5 is the dominant thermal coolant in the mir . however , how does it interact with the most important phenomenon in high - speed shocks namely the x - ray emission ? @ xcite showed that the h @ xmath5 emission was stronger than the x - ray emission at the shock center . this can now be evaluated over much of the shocksq ##2 . we performed a complete reanalysis of the xmm - based observations of sq using the latest calibrations ( see appendix a for more details ) in order to improve the intensity and luminosities of the x - ray emission to match our previous results . the results show the relative dominance of the h @ xmath5 line as compared with the x - ray emission from the other regions . for the main shock , the x - ray ` ` x ' ' value of h @ xmath45 = 2 . 95 @ xmath2 10 @ xmath46erg s @ xmath13 @ xmath47 corresponds to 2 . 95 @ xmath2 10 @ xmath35 @ h @ xmath13 , and l ( h @ xmath5 ) / l @ xmath45 = 2 . 9 . this is a lower limit since we have not attempted to determine the contribution to the main shock aperture of the entire galaxy - wide x - ray cloud upon which the emission from the shock depends . therefore it is likely that the h @ xmath5 line only dominates over the main shock x - ray gas by a h @ x##math48 ##5 . similar calculations can be done for the extended regions for which h @ xmath5 spectra have been obtained . for example , in the ` ` bridge ' ' region , which we have already indicated has many of the same properties as the main region , we find that ( h @ xmath5 ) / h @ xmath45 = 3 . 5 . these results show that throughout the extended regions of sq , the molecular - oxygen emission dominates over the x - rays in this shocked region . this is a very important finding , upturning the previous view that x - ray emission only undergoes cooling in the early stages of evolution in large groups of stars . the fine - structure constant ##s ( see also [ tablemetalfluxes ] ) can be used to determine the structure within the extracted regions of sq . the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 % provides an estimate of the sources of excitation in the region . as mentioned above , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] is mainly a study of hii emission , whereas enhanced @ xmath10##siii @ xmath11 $ ] emission can be measured via two methods , in thermal expansion of x - rays ( xdrs ) , or in shock . in the main example , the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 ratio of @ xmath6 1 . 59 is large compared to , for example , the intruder galaxies ( @ xmath6 1 . 8 ) and agn ( @ xmath6 1 . 9 ) in the same sample @ xcite . however , this large aperture is exceeded by star ##light coming from sq - a and the intruder galaxies . a better approximation is provided by the smaller shock sub - region , where the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 ratio is @ xmath49 . thus it is clear that the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] emission is well outside the normal range of radiation , even for a well - studied agn . thus the upper limit value for @ xmath##10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 0 for the ` ` x ' ' region , we find the range of @ xmath50 again values well outside the range of normal galactic radio waves . however , these high values are typical of recent supernova ##e where the energy is well determined ( e . g . * ?

are these distributions consistent with the hypothesis that the universe is created where the spiral galaxy ngc 7318b collided with a pre - existing tidal filament of hydrogen drawn out of ngc 7319 after a nuclear collision with the group h @ xcite ? this is motion pictureappears , as can be seen in figure [ 1 : hi + h2 ] which shows that the h @ xmath5 distribution ` ` fills in ' ' the gap in the hi magnetic field as predicted by the vla @ xcite . the result is that the hi has been split into both a cold x - ray component and a warm h @ xmath5 component by the collision of the latter with the now cool hi . part of the puzzle of how this high - temperature ( @ xmath60 @ xmath61 kms @ xmath13 ) gas can lead to intense x - ray and to strong hydrogen star formation is illustrated in the figure by @ xcite . the high - temperature collision of ngc 7318b with the hi gas ( assumed to be part of a multiphase medium ) leads to multiple shocks passing through and compressing dense clumps ( which become dusty nucleation centers for h @ xmath5 formation ) as opposed to the low - temperature gas , which is shock - resistant to x - ray tempertures . the h @ xmath5 therefore forms much cooler regions with fewer shocks . thus the coexistence of the hot x - ray gas , and thethis material is a direct consequence of the surrounding temperature of the pre - shocked material . modeling of the h @ xmath5 emission by @ xcite demonstrates that the emission can be reproduced by high velocity ( @ xmath62 ) magnetohydrodynamic clouds in the hot ( @ xmath63 ) h @ xmath5 material . the gas will last long enough to be driven by turbulence in the hot - core component , tapping into the large available kinetic energy of the gas . this observation is consistent with both the cold h @ xmath5 linewidth ( 870kms @ xmath13 ) measured in the high - velocity # ##s of @ xcite , and the velocity profile of the hot h @ xmath5 ( based on new irs instrument calibrations - see table b ) which places the gas at intermediate velocity between the intruder and the surrounding igm . all these measurements are consistent with h @ xmath5 being produced in the hot pre - shocked layer . high pre - shock temperatures and post - shock temperatures result in regions of dust and hii that have cooled , but where the molecular material has been destroyed @ xcite . pre- the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) which would have been embedded in the hi ##bla , would be highly compressed and collapse rapidly , possibly forming clouds . this scenario , proposed for sq - 1 by @ xcite , would also apply to 7318b - south . however , if this was the case , it would fail to explain why two such gmcs happen to be located at the extreme end of the same shock by apparent coincidence . more likely , however , is that the geometry of the shock somehow favors the formation of clouds at the ends of the shock perhaps in regions where the initial shock is less efficient . as outlined above , the distribution of spectral lines in the shock region of sq can be understood in terms of a spectrum of shock velocities . the fastest shock frequencies ( @ xmath64 and @ xmath0 ) are associated with the high temperature pre - shock plasma and the post - shock x - ray emitting plasma . these are fast @ xmath33 km and show a discontinous distribution of hydrodynamic variables and are highly compressed @ xcite . @ xmath34 shocks have a stable transition region such that the transition from pre - shock to post - shock is continuous and are highlynon - dissociative @ xcite . the lowest energy shocks associated with the initial h @ xmath5 emission are @ xmath62 @ xmath34 shocks @ xcite . @ xcite have optical emission line ratios consistent with shock models that do not predict a radiative shock @ xcite . the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 emission associated with the shock model in sq is very weak , but coincides with the most violent phase of the shock model produced by the x - rays ( cf . [ 1 : 1 ] ) . we also find the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 emission associated with the sq shock . fe and iron have a similar first and second ionization potential . their first emission potential ( 7 . 15 and 8 . 15 ev for fe and si , respectively ) are lower than that of si . their second emission potential is higher ( 14 . 35 and 16 . 35 ev ) . the mir @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] emission ratios observed from the sq shock could also arisefrom the co , as well as noble gas . we calculate the ne from the noble gas using the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath65m ) / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath66 ##m ) and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath67m ) / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath66 ##m ) line ratio . the [ @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath66m ) / @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath68 ##m ) ir - ir line ratio ( see figure 1 ) shows that @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] has the highest known concentration of ne in the sq range . unlike co and co , it is not completely free in the @ xcite . because the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] @ xmath66 m line has a high molecular mass ( @ xmath69 @xmath57 , allen and keto 2007 ) , the observed field strength scales with the density limit of the shock wave . the optical line emission from the sq ##d was discussed in detail by xu et al . the line ratio of the @ xmath10oi @ xmath11 $ ] ( 6300 ) and @ xmath10nii @ xmath11 $ ] ( 6584 ) lines to the @ xmath27 line ratios are evidence of shock ionization . the [ @ xmath10sii @ xmath11 $ ] ( 6716 / 6731 ) line ratio as well as the mir @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] line ratio corresponds to the lower density limit ( see figure 5 ) and comparison with the experimental models of allen et al . ( 2008 ) shows the pre - shock line density to be h @ xmath70 @ xmath57 or higher . in the [ ref : sil _ 2 ] we show the region ( in red ) corresponding to the low mir limit ( between the upper and lower limits ) for the @ xmath10neii @ xmath1112 . 81 \ [ $ ] \ [ emission .( in section 4 ) . for comparison the expected emission from the shock reaction of @ xcite is given for the pre - shock shock reaction of @ xmath70 @ xmath57 and the values of the shock parameters , @ xmath58 = 2 . 5 and 2 . for comparison of the results , the shock parameters from 100 to 300kms @ xmath13 are used and the values , which do not match the [ @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] / @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] expected emission values ( in section 5 ) are discarded . the values @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath65m ) / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath66 m ) and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath67m ) / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath66 m ) ratios are much smaller than the above ratio . the carbon and silicon atoms are not observed in presence of intense radiation . thegas abundances of these species do not reflect the chemical structure of the gas and the line emission roughly scale with the gas ##eous ##s . we also consider the offset between the experimental values and model values as estimates for fe and si respectively . we consider the values of the effects indicated by the arrow ( @ xmath650 % and @ xmath660 % for fe and si , respectively ) and the [ fig : sil _ ne ] as lower limits since there could be a contribution to the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] line emission from non - ionizing @ xmath33 - shocks into the h @ xcite . such events could also contribute to the @ xmath10oi @ xmath11 $ ] ( 6300 ) line emission as described by guillard et al . forthcoming observations of the h @ xmath9 ##3 - ray line emission in the near - infrared should allow us to determine whether they might be significant . the contribution from non - absorbing events to the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10##siii @ xmath11 $ ] line emission will raise the concentration of both fe and si as well as the fe / si depletion rate because non - thermal shocks do not affect @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] line emission and the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath71m ) / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath72 ##m ) the emission ratio for @ xmath33 - shocks from dense gas is lower than for shocks observed in figure [ fig : sil _ 1 ] . a key limitation to understanding the emission we observe in sq , as well as a limitation of the standard model of h @ xmath5 emission , is the concentration and distribution of cold h @ xmath5 , as measured by si . a reservoir of cold h @ xmath5 compared with the dense gas found in sq would provide key insight into radiation in the microwave region . in figure [ fig : si ] we use the bima ##p ( 1 - 3 ) integrated temperature measurements from @ xcite , shown with the h @ xmath5s ( 0 ) and s ( 1 ) , contours , appear on an optical image of sq . these interferometric observations use the large primary beam of light , centered on the shock , to determine areas of high column densities in the core . the co includes areas of strong star formation , at 24 and 25 the nuv ( see fig [ sf ] ) , in sq - a and 7318b - south . as determined by @ xcite , the co of ngc 7319 is concentrated in two complexes . the nuclear complex is composed of the nucleus residing in a large tidal feature . the nuclear core is elongated perpendicular to the stellar disk indicating a deficiency of known star formation in the disk . the co concentration does not correlate with the concentration of hot h @ xmath5 levels , found around ngc 7319 . the warm h @ xmath5 levels are clearly distinguished from the concentrations of cold h @ xmath9 . even the s ( 1 ) emission line ( see fig . [ sf : sf ] a ) , which follows the very warm h @ xmath9 , does not show peaks corresponding to the strongest co concentration . in a recent study ( guillard et al . 2010 , in preparation ) ,we will repeat the co observations of @ xmath73co ( 1 - 1 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) lines , along with the mir h @ xmath9 in the sq system , using the multi - spectral 10 cm iram telescope . these observations show that much of the ir emission from the shock has been lost by us ( because of the broad linewidth ) and show that the ir emission is still present in the shock , and extended along the h @ xmath9 - sq bridge and towards ngc 7319 . the region of the ir spectrum lying outside of star - forming regions , in the r system , appears to be strongly disturbed with a broad linewidth in agreement with the appleton et al . ( 2006 ) interpretation that the mir h @ xmath5 lines were still very broad and resolved by the high resolution analysis of irs . the new data also agrees with our re - examination of the appleton et al . ( 2006 ) data ( see table a ) using more recent and reliable wavelength calibration , which shows the emission of the h @ xmath5 lines at velocities similar to that of the intruder and the data supporting the conclusion that the h @ x##math5 gas is produced in the shock . section [ sf ] discussed the star forming regions observed in sq and noted that there was very little evidence for star formation in the intruder region with the warm h @ xmath5 emission . the main shock contains a large quantity of neutral molecular hydrogen ( 5 . 2 @ xmath210 @ xmath43m @ xmath44 ) providing a reservoir of fuel for star formation once it cools ( see section [ sf ] ) . we investigate star formation in the warm h @ xmath9 - dominated region by studying the shock sub - region , chosen to avoid star forming regions in the intruder region , and likely still subject to some radiation from these regions . pah molecule is a strong tracer of star formation , but the molecules are unstable and easily destroyed in strong magnetic fields . in the spectra of the main shock and subregion ( fig . [ fig : 2 ] a and b ) the pah # bands at 7 . 2 , 7 . 4 and 7 . 8 are far weaker compared to the 11 . 3 bands , which when observed are predominantly dominated by the pah ##2 @ xcite . in the shock subregion we find an upper limit value for the 6 . 2 pah of@ xmath74 wm @ xmath75 and instead of @ xmath76 wm @ xmath75 and @ xmath77 wm @ xmath75 for the 7 . 7 and 11 . 3 bands respectively . this corresponds to a 7 . 7 / 11 . 3 pah ratio of 0 . 35 , very low compared to the median value found for the sings sample of 3 . 5 @ xcite . the reduction of the 7 . 7 / 11 . 3 pah ratio has been observed in agn environments ( e . g . low - luminosity agn in the sings sample of * ? ? ? * ) and is favored to be the result of the presence of pah molecules large enough to emit the 7 . 7 . pah reduction in the shock due to larger molecules being more fragile than smaller ones is discussed further in guillard et al . an alternative explanation is that the pah molecules are relatively large and neutral in the shock , producing the 7 . 7 , in comparison to the smaller pah molecules . a detailed comparison of the dust and pah emission spectra can be found in guillard et al . ( 2010 ) . dust emission in the mid - and late -this can be used to infer the rate of star formation taking place @ xcite . we have a low flux in this region of 0 . 408 mjy , corresponding to a low luminosity ( @ xmath78 ) of @ xmath79 . this low flux is associated with the weak mir effect ( cf . [ see : spectra ] below ) , arising from emission from vsgs heated by the uv radiation source . we can combine this with a measure of the h @ xmath27 emission in this region to obtain a star formation rate ( sfr ) , assuming that they are related ( h @ xmath27 tracing the young stellar population and r is a measure of dust - induced stellar light ) . we find @ xmath80 , but caution that the @ xmath27 emission in sq is not the result of dust - induced @ xcite and should be considered an upper limit for future star formation . when we combine @ xmath81 with @ xmath82 , using the emission of @ xcite , we obtain an sfr of @ xmath290 . 05 @ xmath83 . a similar rate of star formation can be obtained fromthe pah emission . using the sample of @ xcite , derived from the starburst sample of @ xcite , we can use the 7 . 7 flux density as a measure of star formation . the shock subregion has a 7 . 7 flux density of 0 . 5 mjy which corresponds to a sfr of @ xmath84 , in good agreement with our previous calculation , but also an upper limit for some pah emission indicates contamination from known star formation galaxies in the group . a point of concern , however , is that this star formation sample may be biased so that we have the 7 . 7 flux compared to the 11 . 3 pah . comparing the @ xmath85 ( 7 . 7 ) / @ xmath82 ratio to the sample ' density , we find that the value of @ xmath86 is typical of star - forming galaxies @ xcite , which suggests that both types of star formation are different , but self - consistent . the low _ upper limit _ for the sfr of the shock indicates that star formation is different in the shock sample from in the main starburst , sq - a , which has an sfr of @ xmath87 . the strength of the shock @ x##cite . this would be illustrated with a cloud of molecular hydrogen being compressed by mhd shocks in the turbulent universe . since the jeans mass increases with increasing temperature and turbulence and the morions will prevent collapse , the compressed molecular hydrogen gas may be too short - lived or unstable to sustain collapse and produce significant star formation @ xcite . the existence of a large reservoir of molecular gas in the universe is a key consideration in this scenario , as discussed in figure [ co ] . the present observations show that the line emission in dense clumps is a large fraction of the kinetic energy released by high - speed collisions . for reference , and to provide a glimpse of what this group would look like at high redshift when filling a single galaxy , we show in figure [ fig : full ] the data obtained for the whole group ( i . e . including the three neighboring galaxies and the shock ) . the rotational h @ xmath5 line emission from the whole group h @ xmath8 and is still the most dominant mir signal . however the intensity of the rotational h @ xmath5 line is sufficient that it could be detected at high redshift with a far - infrared , sub - mm - like sp##ica or safir ( see appleton et al . how likely is it , then , that high - energy shocks play a role in the formation of galaxies ? there is no evidence that galaxies at high energies are h @ xcite and are clumpy ( e . g . conselice et al . 2005 , elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) . indeed bournaud & elmegreen ( 2009 ) discuss the role of the cooling process in massive gas clumps , forming galaxies like h @ xmath88 ##9 , and favor at least a small percentage of the galaxy systems being formed in such media , very similar to those discussed by dekel et al . to what extent the break - up of these galaxies is considered ` ` smooth ' ' is not yet known since the medium is likely to be a multiphase medium . in a more standard model , galaxies forming into the most extreme dark halos will experience larger shocks , most likely in an inhomogenious region ( e . g . greif et al . 2008 ) . it raises the question of how effective h @ xmath9 cooling may be in these extreme cases . observations of the collapse of the first structures suggest that strong absorption lines inand the cooling over molecular hydrogen when the first particles entered the universe . it is now usually assumed that , except at the early stages , molecular hydrogen is a minority coolant of matter that forms the first major structures ( e . g . bromm et al . 2001 , santoro and shull 2006 ) . however , our observations suggest that , under the right conditions , especially in high metallicity environments , molecular hydrogen can be extremely powerful in this , dominating by a factor of ten over the usually powerful @ xmath10siii @ xmath1134 . [ \ mu $ ] m . @ strong shocks . if there are regions at high redshift where strong shocks collapse into a clumpy , multiphase medium , then our observations imply that molecular hydrogen cooling would not be expected to be negligible . on the other hand , this will not be a trivial problem . our theoretical model of stephan ##o . @ xcite involves the formation of h @ xmath5 in a complex , turbulent environment in which shocks destroy dust in some places , but its remains in others - thus encouraging h @ xmath5 formation . in the early universe , this enhanced cooling , which has so far been observed , will depend on thedistribution and nature of the first dust grains , in concert with the formation , temperature and density of stars , and the gravitational effects from the first stars and agn . in this paper we have presented the results of the near - infrared spectral mapping of the stephan s ##1 system using the _ spitzer space telescope _ . we highlight here our two main findings : * the warm h @ xmath5 line produced by @ xcite ##s represents only a small fraction of the galaxy - wide warm h @ xmath5 ( with a lower peak luminosity of @ xmath89 spread over @ xmath90 kpc @ xmath7 ) that dominates the mid - infrared region of the system . there is evidence for a super - massive feature , the so - called h @ xmath5 bridge between the main shock and ngc 7319 , which is probably a remnant of the gravitational forces within the group . the spatial variation in the magnitude of the h @ xmath5 0 - 1 spectral ratios implies differences in temperature and excitation in the shocked region - this will be explained fully in part 2 . * the * l ( h @ xmath5 ) / h @ xmath91 boundary of the main shock is @xmath92 , and @ xmath62 . 5 in the new ` ` bridge ' ' model . the results confirm that mir ##i @ xmath9 lines produce a stronger signal than x - ray emission from the shock waves , indicating a new cooling pathway occurring on a large scale in sq . this modifies the traditional view that x - rays are present at all times in the later stages of compact spiral galaxies . since i @ xmath5 forms on the surfaces of the galaxies , we expect dust emission associated with these regions , but the low background radiation field produces very little emission at them . * unlike traditional interpretations of the line ratios in the optical , we consider the ionic lines within the framework of the ( @ xmath93 and @ xmath0 ) ion ##osphere . comparison of the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] , @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] line ratios indicates that both silicon and iron were released onto dust . this result indicates that silicon was not destroyed in the explosion .* star formation in sq is dominated by sq -

wide collision @ xcite . the cooling effect of warm h @ xmath5 emission we observe galaxy - wide in sq is clearly a significant , albeit uncertain , mechanism for such systems . to determine the likely dominant cooling mechanism in sq , we require an inventory of heating and cooling processes at all wavelengths . the shock waves @ xcite suggest that , apart fromthe recent data from h @ xmath5 , and from sources such as @ xmath10oi @ xmath11 $ ] 63 . 2 , @ xmath10cii @ xmath11 $ ] 157 . 2 and the recent contribution of h @ xmath50 @ xcite could be useful . we want to explore this region more fully , and the further study of the region , using the capabilities of the _ x _ space observatory . in addition , we do not rule out possible spectral line -

ray emission @ xcite and is prominent at radio frequencies @ xcite . however , we see an overlap between the peak of the h @ xmath5 emission in ngc 7319 and the seyfert nucleus , which suggests that the ` ` bridge ' ' is a separate entity and not directly excited by the agn . the agn in ngc 7319 does not have a well - defined jet , but rather two lobes with two hotspots , asymetrically distributed along the long axis of the h @ xcite . this jet runs ne / sw and its orientation relative to the h @ xmath5 filament ( which runs ew ) is also consistent with causing the peak of the h @ xmath5 emission . this is also evident from the relatively weak emission in the agn , as inferred by the spectral line analysis described above , and in the x - ray where there is only a fraction of @ xmath62 greater than the amount associated with the bow shock and ` ` bridge ' ' . in figure [ 2 : fs ] we see the two intensity contours of the @ xmath##10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 ( compare with @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 @ xmath25 ##0 ) , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 emission lines . given the high - resolution of the sl and ll values of _ spitzer _ , we can easily distinguish the emission from @ xmath10fe ##ii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] . the agn at ngc 7319 is known to be strong , with @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] emission lines occurring in x -

ir . spitzer imaging reveals not only the galactic core , but also extended emission regions in the core . [ the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 81 @ xmath25m / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 ratio as a result of radio astronomy , we find a value of @ xmath61 . 5 which is low compared to the same value found for agn galaxies ( @ xmath94 ) in the _ spitzer _ infrared _ sky survey ( ras ) , but high compared to star - forming galaxies ( @ xmath95 ) in thesee also @ xcite . this is a relatively large agn . the @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 18 . 56 / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 ratio is a measure of radiation field strength and the range of 0 . 97 indicates a high radiation field strength relative to the agn ( the sample of weedman et al . 2005 shows a range of @ xmath60 . 17 to 0 . 96 ) . the total electron density , calculated from the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 18 . 56 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 ratio of @ xmath60 . 17 , and @ xmath59 @ xmath57 @ xcite , setting the electron - mass limit for this h @ xcite . the sources of the h @ xmath5 emission of ngc 7319 are limited to the very short wavelength range observed in irs - ll ( the galaxy just outside the region dominated by sl ) . as a result , the phase diagram shows only two lines giving only an approximate estimate of the h @ xmath5 mass , since without the hthermal coverage to provide information on the warm components , we are able to overestimate the mass of the h @ xmath5 by fitting a straight line to the system . any hotter component would contribute to the flux of the 1 - 0 - ( w ) line thus leading to a decrease of the flux ( and increase in h @ xmath5 mass ) for the warmer component . finally , to provide the limit , we estimate the mass of h @ xmath5 @ xmath96171 @ xmath97 ##10 ( assuming the system is in thermal equilibrium and has an ortho - para ##bola of 2 . 65 ) and the total h @ xmath5 mass of 3 . 0 @ xmath9810 @ xmath3m @ xmath4 . we consider this a lower limit to the total warm component if ( it is assumed ) more than one component is present . gao & xu ( 2000 ) estimated the _ cold _ molecular hydrogen mass of ngc 7319 based on @ xmath73co ( 1 - 0 ) and as @ xmath88 3 . 0 @ xmath210 @ xmath99m @ xmath4 , a factor ofroughly slightly less than the total h @ xmath5 mass . such a ratio is highly atypical of large elliptical galaxies @ xcite . the high sh spectrum at the center of the cluster in sq , measured by @ xcite , has been reanalysed with the improved calibrations used for the new instrument ( ssc , @ s17 ) and is shown in figure [ 1 : hr ] . this has shown that the h @ xmath5 cluster moves at a velocity of 6360 ( @ xmath100100 ) , ##s @ xmath13 , between the velocity of the shock ( 6600 s @ xmath13 ) and the velocity of the intruder ( 5700 s @ xmath13 ) . this is consistent with the model of gas being accelerated by the shock , as well as the velocity determined by the broad linewidth of the h @ xmath5 in the shock ( 860 kms @ xmath13 ) . the new sh spectrum shows that with the new measurements , the 11 . 3 pah feature was detected , although weakly . this is consistent with what is seen in the data extractions that show the 11 . 3 pah feature compared to thepah features appear in 6 . 2 and 7 . 3 . in this section we consider the x - ray emission in the three regions shown in figure [ 1 : ext ] . the reanalysis of the data is necessary to obtain accurate values and estimates for the x - ray emission in the three regions matched to our original data . we use the xmm - newton epic - pn method ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) to obtain the most accurate results . a new data set was generated and filtered with high quality flags , and then cleaned of all errors . a 0 . 32 kev image was then extracted and analyzed for the results . all point - like sources were masked back to @ xmath101 for the analysis of diffuse sources , and the total background level was estimated within a @ xmath102 arcmin @ xmath7 rectangular region away from the galactic center . for the region in fig . 1 , " background - level " count values were calculated to 0 . 32 kev and 2 " ( 0 . 00110 kev ) x - ray fluxes . an absorbed thermal plasma model of metallicity 0 . 1 solar , with temperatureas follows from the results of osullivan et al .
