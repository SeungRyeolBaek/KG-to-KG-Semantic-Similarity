the lep experiments at the pole of @ xmath1 - boson have extended the standard model ( sm ) at atomic level , measuring the @ xmath1 - decay into spin ##ons with an accuracy of a part in the thousands . the good correlation of the lep experiments with the sm predictions have effectively constrained the behavior of particle physics at the @ xmath1 - pole . taking these constraints into account we can imagine that the production of @ xmath1 - decay will again play the central role in the development of particle physics if the next generation @ xmath1 experiment comes up with the expected @ xmath1 events several orders of magnitude larger than that of the lep . this situation can be seen in the gigaz option of the international linear collider ( ilc ) @ xcite . the ilc is a proposed electron - positron collider with tunable energy beams from @ xmath12 to @ xmath13 and energy beams in its gas phase , and the gigaz option contributes to the construction on top of the pole of @ xmath1 boson by providing a bypass to the main decay structure . given the high energies , @ xmath14, and the cross section of the sequence of @ xmath1 events , @ xmath15 , about @ xmath16 @ xmath1 events can be seen in the operational simulation of @ xmath17 of gigaz , which means that the overall contribution to the branching ratio of @ xmath1 - decay can be reduced from @ xmath18 at the lep to @ xmath19 at the gigaz @ xcite . in view of this , the @ xmath1 - boson family , with its unique and exotic properties which are now considered to be important to particle physics , should be studied further to evaluate their potential for probing new physics . among the rare @ xmath1 - decay , the flavor changing ( fc ) processes were also extensively studied to determine the flavor texture in particle physics @ xcite , and it was found that , although these processes are very limited in the sm , their branching ratios in new physics experiments can be greatly enhanced to @ xmath19 for lepton flavor violation decay @ xcite and @ xmath20 for proton flavor violation decays @ xcite . among the fc processes , the @ xmath1 - decay into vs .##ggs boson ( s ) is another type of elementary particle that was widely studied , e . g . the decay @ xmath21 ( @ xmath22 ) with the particle @ xmath0 denoting a massive higgs boson was studied in @ xcite , the decay @ xmath23 was studied in the two higgs model extensions ( 2hdm ) @ xcite and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @ xcite , and the decay @ xmath4 was studied in a completely independent way @ xcite , in 2hdm @ xcite and finally in mssm @ xcite . these results show that , in contrast with the kinematic forbidden of these decay in the past , the size of these decay cannot be as large as @ xmath18 in current physics experiments , which lie in the temperature range of the gigaz . in this way , we extend the previous results of these decay to the new extensions and investigate these results further . we are motivated by the recent studies on the new extension of the mssm , such as the small - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @ xcite and the new minimal super##symmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @ xcite , where a light cp - odd higgs like @ xmath0 with non - dominant component would naturally arise from the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry like @ xmath24 or peccei - quuin ##e @ xcite . these non - interacting supersymmetric particles can not only solve the @ xmath25 - violation , but also solve the spin hierarchy by creating such a light higgs like @ xmath0 @ xcite . we are also surprised by that , with the sm model , the properties of the heavy higgs boson are more stringently constrained than before . but it is worth mentioning the previous discussion . so , there is no model - specific lower bound for the heavy higgs of mass . in the sm , it would be less than @ xmath26 gev , derived from the null observation of the higgs boson , lep ##k . however , due to the more complex nature of the higgs interactions in the model of the sm , this lower bound can be somewhat relaxed according to some studies , e . g . , for the cp - odd higgs sector @ xmath0 we have@ xmath27 gev in the nmssm @ xcite , @ xmath28 gev in the nmssm @ xcite , and @ xmath29 gev in the non - specific 2hdm ( l2hdm ) @ xcite . with such a large cp - odd higgs number , the light - curves into one or more @ xmath0 models open up . assuming that the decay @ xmath30 is not due to spontaneous fission , we in this way study the rare @ xmath1 - decays @ xmath6 ( @ xmath22 ) , @ xmath31 and @ xmath4 in a systematic fashion for different models , namely the type - specific 2hdm @ xcite , the l2hdm @ xcite , the nmssm and the nmssm . in our study , we examine all the constraints on the decay @ xmath0 from four different experimental results . this work is organized as follows . in sec . ii we first describe the four different physics models . in sec . iii we present the details of the rare @ xmath1 - decays . in sec . iv we examine the constraints on the lightnew physics models . in sec . , we show the same results for the second order of the - @ xmath1 - decays in different ways . again , the conclusion is given in sec . in the most efficient way , the sm uses one higgs field to break the electroweak symmetry . as a result , the sm predicts only one physical higgs boson with its mass being determined by the free parameters . in new physics models , the higgs model is further extended by adding higgs doublets and / or particles , and thus , more physical higgs bosons are predicted , with more free parameters involved , . the sm 2hdm includes the @ xmath32 - higgs , @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 , and with the assumption of cp - symmetry , its interaction energy can be parameterized as @ xcite : @ xmath35 , \ dots { t } \ ] ] where @ xmath36 ( @ xmath37 ) are the dimensionless parameters , and @ xmath38 ( @ xmath39 ) are the parameters with # ##less . after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the energy of this higgs field is the masslesstwo electrons , which become the decay products of @ xmath40 and @ xmath1 respectively , and four other physical particles : two cp - even higgs particles @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 , a large cp - even higgs particle @ xmath0 and a pair of large higgs particles @ xmath43 . noting the correlation @ xmath44 with @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 being the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 respectively , we choose @ xmath47 as the transition , with @ xmath48 , and @ xmath49 being the phase transition that diagonalizes the charge distribution of the cp - even higgs particles . the difference between the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm comes from the strong coupling of the higgs particles to quark / particle . in the type - ii 2hdm , one higgs doublet @ xmath34 generates the masses of up - type particles and the other doublet @ xmath33 generates the masses of down - type quarks and neutral leptons ; whilein the l2hdm one higgs particle @ xmath33 couples only to electrons and the other one @ xmath34 couples only to quarks . thus the soft coupling of @ xmath0 to electrons in these two cases is enhanced by @ xcite @ xmath50 with @ xmath51 being the coupling . however , in the l - - 2hdm the @ xmath52 coupling and the @ xmath53 coupling can be further enhanced by @ xmath54 , while in the l2hdm , the @ xmath53 coupling is enhanced by @ xmath55 . the structures of the nmssm and the nmssm are described by their superpotentials and their soft - coupling terms , which are given by @ xcite @ xmath56 where @ xmath57 is the superpotential of the mssm without the @ xmath25 coupling , @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 are higgs - and singlet superfields with @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 being their coupling components respectively , @ xmath62 , @ xmath6##3 , @ xmath64 , @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 are soft breaking terms , and @ xmath68 and @ xmath69 are components of the higgs self interaction . with the superpotentials and the soft - breaking terms , we can get the higgs particles of the nmssm and the nmssm itself . in the 2hdm , the higgs particles with the cp property are chosen and the mass eigenstates are calculated by computing the resulting mass matrices : @ xmath70 where the fields on the two hands of the matrix are the fields of @ xmath71 , @ xmath72 and @ xmath61 defined by @ xmath73 @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 are respectively the cp - even and cp - odd neutral higgs particles , @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 are the particles defined by @ xmath1 and @ xmath78 , and @ xmath79 is the neutral higgs particle . thus , the nmssm and nmssm are thecp - even higgs ##ons , two cp - odd higgs ##s and a pair of odd higgs # . in general , the single cp - even higgs @ xmath0 in these models is the sum of the free field @ xmath80 and the free field of , @ xmath81 , i . e . @ xmath82 and the interactions to low - mass quarks are then proportional to @ xmath83 . so for the dominated @ xmath0 , @ xmath84 is small and the interactions are suppressed . as a result , the interactions of @ xmath0 with the background are dominated by @ xcite @ xmath85 i . e . the interaction does not occur when @ xmath86 is large . just like the 2hdm where we choose the vevs of the higgs field as fundamental parameters , we choose @ xmath68 , @ xmath69 , @ xmath87 , @ xmath88 , @ xmath66 and @ xmath89 as fundamental parameters for the nmssm @ xcite and @ xmath68, @ xmath54 , @ xmath88 , @ xmath65 , @ xmath90 and @ xmath91 are input parameters for the nmssm @ xcite . between the nmssm and the nmssm , two points should be noted . the first is for the two parameters , there is no explicit @ xmath92term , and the effective @ xmath25 term ( @ xmath93 ) is used when the breaking term of @ xmath59 has a vev . the second is , the nmssm is almost identical to the nmssm with @ xmath94 @ xcite , because the breaking term @ xmath95 and the corresponding breaking term @ xmath96 in the nmssm do not induce any interaction , except for the spin - based higgs boson interactions and the boundary conditions . and the third is because of the above , the nmssm has its own mass , which comes from the neutralino distribution . in the model @ xmath97 , the neutralino mass distribution is given by @ xcite @ xmath98 where @ xmath99and @ xmath100 for @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 gaugino , respectively , @ xmath103 , @ xmath104 , @ xmath105 and @ xmath106 . by diagonalizing this matrix one can get the corresponding eigenstate of the particle neutralino @ xmath107 with mass taking the form : @ xcite @ xmath108 this also implies that @ xmath107 must be less than 1 @ xmath109 gev for @ xmath110 ( from lower bound on chargnio bound ) and @ xmath111 ( perturbativity bound ) . like the other supersymmetric particles , @ xmath107 , the electron sparticle acts as the dark matter in the universe , but due to its singlino - dominated nature , it is necessary to annihilate it to get the correct mass for the current model . calculating the energy density of @ xmath107 is a useful way in calculating the model parameters . for example , as predicted by @ xcite , for @ xmath112 , there is a way to calculate thecorrect energy is , and for the general case , @ xmath107 is obtained by exchanging @ xmath1 mass for @ xmath113 , or by exchanging a light cp - odd higgs particle @ xmath0 with one satisfying the relation @ xmath114 for @ xmath115 . for the annihilation , @ xmath54 and @ xmath25 are required to be less than 10 and @ xmath116 , because through etc . ( [ x - exp ] ) the collision @ xmath87 or @ xmath25 will suppress @ xmath117 to make the annihilation more efficient . the properties of the light cp - odd higgs particle @ xmath0 , such as its mass and charge , are also bound , since @ xmath0 plays an important role in @ xmath107 decay . the nature of the nmssm is also rather complicated , and this is discussed in detail in @ xcite . in the h - i 2hdm , l2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , the particle @ xmath##1 - 4 @ xmath118 ( @ xmath22 ) , @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 all come from the two diagrams shown in fig . [ fig1 ] , fig . [ fig2 ] and fig . [ fig3 ] respectively . for these diagrams , the transition state @ xmath119 contains all possible cp - violating higgs states in the standard model , i . e . @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 in type - 2 2hdm and l2hdm and @ xmath41 , @ xmath42 and @ xmath120 in nmssm and nmssm . in order to take into account the strong interaction effects of @ xmath119 in fig . [ fig1 ] ( b ) for @ xmath2 and fig . [ fig3 ] ( c ) for @ xmath11 , we have included all the decay ##s of @ xmath119 and have included the decay ##s of the transition . as to the decay @ xmath121 , two points should be considered . this point , for the decays @ xmath6 and @ xmath11 ,this decay proceeds only by loops mediated by electrons / leptons in the type - ii 2hdm and l2hdm , and additionally by sparticles in the nmssm and nmssm . but in both cases the contribution should be much smaller than the other ones . the other , due to cp - invariance , loops mediated by squarks / sleptons make no contribution to the decay @ xcite . in actual calculation , this is reflected in the fact that the coupling coefficient of @ xmath122 differs from that of @ xmath123 by the opposite sign ( see eq . ( [ asqsq ] ) ) , and as a result , the squark - free contributions to @ xmath121 are not ruled out . with regard to the rare decay @ xmath11 , we have more information . in the first case , this decay proceeds by the process shown in fig . [ fig3 ] ( a ) , and hence we would think that , as a rough estimate , it is best to only consider the contributions from fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) . also , we note that in some cases of the type - ii 2hdm and l2hdm, due to the cancelation of the contributions from the @ xmath119 in fig . [ fig3 ] ( 2 ) and also due to the very large of @ xmath124 couplings ( i . e . larger than the electroweak coupling @ xmath125 ) , the radiative correction from the higgs - mediated loop may dominate over the tree level contribution even when the tree level contribution of the loop , @ xmath126 , exceeds @ xmath20 . on the other hand , we found the contributions from quark / lepton - mediated loops can be safely neglected if @ xmath127 is the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm . in the nmssm and the nmssm , besides the contributions from the higgs - and quark / lepton - mediated loops , particles and sparticles such as electrons , charginos and neutralinos can also contribute to the corrections . we have found that the contributions from squarks and charginos can be safely neglected if @ xmath127 . we also found part of the same neutralino correction ( ) that we were checking for @ xmath128 .for ( correction ! ) and , they can be repeated indefinitely . since almost all the radiative corrections would make our model calculations very slow , we only consider the most important corrections , namely that from higgs - mediated loops , when presenting our results for the two models . one can further understand the relative importance of the sparticle contribution to @ xmath11 as follows . first consider the squark contribution which is provided by the @ xmath129 interaction ( @ xmath130 denotes the squark in chirality diagrams ) and the @ xmath131 interaction in the diagrams . because the @ xmath132 interaction conserves the chirality of the molecule and the @ xmath133 interaction violates the chirality , to make non - trivial contribution to @ xmath11 from the second interaction , at least four chiral flippings are required , with two of them provided by @ xmath131 interaction and the third one by the left - right - mixing . this means that , if one calculates the scale of the chirality basis with the matrix multiplication method , the amplitude is given by the scale of @ xmath13##4 with @ xmath135 , the off center element of squark mass theory . we consider the chargino / neutralino contribution . since for the experiment @ xmath0 , the spin component , parameterized as @ xmath84 in fig . ( [ 4 ] ) , is usually zero , the interaction of @ xmath0 with the sparticles can also be tremendously large @ xcite . but the chargino / neutralino contributions are very significant here . in our analysis of the interactions , we work in the spin eigenstates of sparticles instead of in the chirality basis . for the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm , we consider the following constraints @ xcite : * the constraints of @ xmath136 from perturbativity , unitarity and assuming that the magnetic field is finit in all three directions and contains all decay ##s @ xcite , which implies that @ xmath137 * the data from the lep experiment for neutral higgs interactions . we compare the signals from the higgs - strahlung experiment @ xmath138 ( @ xmath139 ) with@ xmath140 @ xcite and from the experimental data @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 @ xcite , and compare them with the experimental lep data which has been inputted into our database . we then derive the constraints from @ xmath138 , solving for the peak of @ xmath143 with the peak of @ xmath1 - 2 @ xcite and the peak of @ xmath144 mev when @ xmath145 @ xcite . + these constraints define the term defined by @ xmath146 \ to br ( x _ b \ to \ to { a } ] ) $ ] in the @ xmath147 term with the the term @ xmath148 as the coupling constant of the @ xmath149 term . they also define a domain - specific lower bound on @ xmath150 , e . g . , @ xmath151 for the l - i 2hdm ( from our experimental data ) , @ xmath152 for the l2hdm @ xcite , and @ xmath153 for the nmssm @ xcite . these constraints aresignificantly lower than that of the sm , i . e . @ xmath154 , partially because in new physics models , the decay modes of @ xmath155 and as @ xmath156 will open up . according to the nmssm , a possible explanation for finding a much lighter cp - even higgs boson is that the interaction will be cp - dominated in this model . + with regard to the lightest cp - even higgs , @ xmath0 , we checked that there is no upper bound on its mass as long as the @ xmath157 interaction is weak and @ xmath155 is very heavy . * the constraints from the lep search for a lighter higgs boson via the yukawa limit @ xmath158 with @ xmath22 and @ xmath61 with the limit @ xcite . these constraints will impose the @ xmath159 coupling versus @ xmath160 in new physics models . * the constraints from the cleo - iii constraints on @ xmath161 and the von babar limits on @ xmath162 . these constraints will impose very strong constraints on the @ xmath##163 , for @ xmath164 . in our analysis , we use the results of fig . 1 of the original analysis of @ xcite to explain the unfavored results . * the constraints from @ xmath165 apply . since the higgs interactions can give much higher energy corrections to @ xmath165 couplings , we apply them to the energy level and require the resulting @ xmath165 values to be in the @ xmath166 range of their fitted values . the corresponding ##es for the couplings at @ xmath1 - 2 are given by @ xmath167 and @ xmath168 @ xcite , and the fitted values are given by @ xmath169 and @ xmath170 , for @ xcite . we apply the formula in @ xcite to the 2hdm in our calculation . * the constraints from @ xmath171 leptonic decay . we require the particle physics correction to the mass of @ xmath172 to be in the range of @ xmath173 @ xcite . we use the formula in @ xcite in our calculation . + apply the constraints ( 5 ) and ( 6) , two points should be noted . one is that higgs sectors are involved in the calculation of : the self energy of @ xmath171 decay , the @ xmath174 vertex correction or the @ xmath175 vertex correction , and in the box model for @ xmath176 @ xcite . since the weak couplings of the higgs sector to @ xmath171 decay are enhanced by @ xmath54 and with all the corrections , @ xmath54 must be upper bound for given properties of the higgs sector . generally speaking , the lighter @ xmath0 decay , the more that @ xmath54 is than @ xcite . the second point is that the l - type 2hdm , @ xmath177 , non - local observables as well as @ xmath178 decay discussed above can limit the model in a different way than the models ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) since the weak couplings of @ xmath171 decay and @ xmath179 decay are also enhanced by @ xmath54 . as for the l2hdm , because only the weak .##s of @ xmath171 can be solved ( see eq . [ 2 ] ) , the parameters ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are more effective in solving @ xmath54 . * * contributions from the other electroweak observables such as @ xmath180 , @ xmath181 and @ xmath182 , and their derivatives @ xmath183 @ xcite . we require @ xmath184 to be compatible with the lep / sld values of @ xmath185 energy and @ xcite . we also require that the value of @ xmath186 be in the @ xmath187 range of the measured value . the latest results for @ xmath188 are @ xmath189 ( measured prediction ) and @ xmath190 ( theoretical prediction ) for @ xmath191 gev @ xcite . in our calculations , we compare the parameters for these observables found in @ xcite to the l - i 2hdm and the l2hdm respectively . + when comparing @ xmath180 , @ xmath181 and @ xmath182 ,we assume that these observables have the contributions from the self energies of the gauge fields @ xmath1 , @ xmath192 and @ xmath193 . since there is no @ xmath194 coupling or @ xmath195 coupling , @ xmath0 must be coupled with the other higgs fields to contribute to the self energies . so by the slow convergence of these quantities , one can see that , for the case of the light @ xmath0 and @ xmath196 , these quantities depend on the spectrum of the higgs field in a way that @ xmath197 has leading edge , which means that the light @ xmath0 will still satisfy the constraints from the other electroweak observables like the coupling points @ xmath150 and @ xmath198 but not @ xcite . * the contributions from other physics observables such as the coupling points for @ xmath199 , @ xmath200 and @ xmath201 , and the phase transitions @ xmath202 and @ xmath203 . we consider their theoretical predictions to agree with the experimental prevalues of @ xmath187 level . + for the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm , only the charged higgs particle contributes to these observables in general , so we can see that @ xmath198 versus @ xmath54 is to be expected . combined analysis of the results in the type - ii 2hdm has been done by the ckmfitter group , and the upper bound of @ xmath204 as a function of @ xmath87 was given in fig . 11 of @ xcite . this result indicates that @ xmath198 will be larger than @ xmath205 and @ xmath185 c . g . regardless the value of @ xmath54 . in this case , we use the results of fig . 11 of @ xcite to find the unfavored points . + for the l2hdm , b ##m actually does not have the value @ xcite because in this model the couplings of the charged higgs particle to itself are equal to @ xmath206 and in the case of large @ xmath54 which we are interested in , they are not . in ourinstead of the l2hdm , we put the lep constraint on @ xmath198 , i . e . @ xmath207 @ xcite . * the contribution from the muon is magnetic moment @ xmath208 . * both the theoretical value and the actual measured value of @ xmath208 have reached a remarkable maximum , but a significant deviation still exists : @ xmath209 @ xcite . in the 2hdm , @ xmath208 gets the contributions from the two - loop diagrams mediated by the higgs , and also from the two - loop barr - zee diagrams mediated by @ xmath0 and @ xmath155 @ xcite . if the higgs particles are much heavier than @ xmath25 lepton ##s , the contributions from the barr - zee diagrams are very important , and to help correct the value of @ xmath208 , one uses the particle @ xmath0 along with its own contribution to @ xmath25 , and contributions to other particles such as the quark and @ xmath171 lepton to push back the value of the barr - zee . @xcite . the cp - violating higgs particles are also considered to be unstable since their contributions to @ xmath208 are negative . + for the type - ii 2hdm , because @ xmath54 is not constrained by the process @ xmath210 involving the lep @ xcite and the @ xmath178 at @ xcite , the barr - zee diagram alone is able to enhance @ xmath208 to @ xmath187 level around the theoretical value @ xcite . + in our case , we require the type - ii 2hdm to enhance @ xmath208 to @ xmath211 level . + for the l2hdm , @ xmath54 is less constrained than with the type - ii 2hdm , and the barr - zee diagram involving the @ xmath171 - decay is capable to speed up greatly the theoretical value of @ xmath208 @ xcite . therefore , we require the l2hdm to explain the decay at @ xmath187 level . + unlike the other constraints mentioned above , the @ xmath208 - constraint put a two - dimensional constraint on @ xmath##54 since on the one hand , one expects too small @ xmath54 to produce the barr - mann model , but on the other hand , too large @ xmath54 will result in an exponential decay @ xmath208 . * since this model relies on a light @ xmath0 , the process @ xmath212 will end up with a possible large decay width . we require the width of any higgs boson to be larger than its mass to produce a large fat higgs boson @ xcite . we note that for the scenario described by @ xmath213 , the scale of @ xmath214 interaction is usually smaller than the electroweak scale @ xmath125 , and consequently a large decay width is required . for the nmssm and nmssm , the decay ##s become more complicated because in these models , not only more higgs bosons are allowed in , but also sparticles enter the constraints . so it is not possible to understand many of the constraints intuitively . take the process @ xmath199 as an example . in the supersymmetric model , besides the large higgs contribution , chargino loops , gluino loops are wellthe neutralino particles also contribute to the process @ xcite , and depending on the susy parameters , any of these contributions can become dominated by or even canceled by other contributions . as a result , although the charged higgs enters the process in the same way as that of the type - ii 2hdm , a higgs as large as @ xmath215 is still required only for @ xmath216 @ xcite . since among the particles , @ xmath208 is rather peculiar in that it needs new physics to explain the discrepancy between @ xmath217 and @ xmath218 , we discuss more about its dependence on susy parameters . in the nmssm and the nmssm , @ xmath208 receives contributions from higgs loops and neutralino / chargino loops . for the higgs contribution , it is quite similar to that of the type - ii 2hdm in that the higgs loops are involved in @ xcite . for the neutralino / chargino contribution , in the upper bino case ( i . e . @ xmath219 ) , it can be written as @ xcite @ xmath220 for @ x##math221 with @ xmath222 being smuon 1 . by combining the two contributions together , we can see that a universe @ xmath0 ##2 with light @ xmath54 and / or a smuon with large @ xmath87 are sufficient to describe the universe . because these constraints are included in the design of the supersymmetric models , we need following additional constraints to further limit their value : * upper bounds on sparticle masses from the lep1 , the lep2 and the tevatron experiments @ xcite . * the lep1 bound on invisible beta decay @ xmath223 ; the lep2 bound on neutralino particles @ xmath224 and @ xmath225 @ xcite . * dark matter mass from the wmap relic density 0 . 0975 @ xmath226 0 . 1213 @ xcite . note that among the above constraints , the constraint ( b ) on higgs mass and the constraint ( c ) on neutralino sector are very different . this is because in the supersymmetric models , the low - mass higgs is only bounded at about @ xmath227 at xby and by setting @ xmath228 at each level , and that the relic ##t restricts the lsp in cross section to a very narrow range . in our version of the nmssm , we define the constraints ( 3 ) and ( 4 - 5 ) for ourselves and write the code nmssmtools @ xcite to implement the remaining constraints . we then write nmssmtools to the nmssm to implement the rest . for the extension , the most difficult thing we know is how to adapt the code micromegas @ xcite to the nmssm specification . we solve this problem by applying the following constraints : * as we mentioned before , the nmssm is actually same as the nmssm with the trilinear singlet frequency equal to zero . so we can utilize the input signal of the nmssm as the input of the micromegas and set @ xmath229 . * since in the nmssm , the lsp is too small to fit into higgs states , there is no need to reconstruct the individual higgs states to find out the energy of @ xmath230 with @ xmath61 denoting any of the##ggs . @ xcite . we consult the authors of the nmssmtools for a discussion of this extension when we use the extension @ xcite . with the above parameters , we perform four independent random scans over the parameter space of the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively . we set the parameters in four groups : @ xmath231 for the type - ii 2hdm , @ xmath232 for the l2hdm , @ xmath233 for the nmssm , and @ xmath234 for the nmssm . in performing the scan , we note that for the nmssm and the nmssm , the constraints may depend on the gaugino parameters and the symmetry group parameters of the core sector and the slepton sector . since these parameters are some of the parameters of @ xmath0 , we use them to increase the number of possible parameters in our calculation . for the core sector , we use the @ xmath235 extension which assumes that the critical energy levels for the higher order squarks are constant : @ xmath236 800 gev ,and that the trilinear parameters of the second order model are all equal , @ xmath237 with @ xmath238 . for the slepton sector , we assume all the soft - coupling parameters and trilinear parameters to be 1 gev . this setting is suitable for the nmssm since this model is able to predict the muon - interactions of @ xmath239 and for the sleptons @ xcite . finally , we assume the gauge unification of @ xmath240 for the gaugino sector with @ xmath241 being the structure constants of the critical point group . with large number of surviving points in the model , we finally get about @ xmath242 , @ xmath243 , @ xmath244 and @ xmath242 , for the m - i 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm , which predict the collision and of @ xmath245 . then the properties of the @ xmath0 indicates that for all of the surviving points in the nmssm and the nmssm , its gauge field is the gauge field ( numerical##ly speaking , @ xmath246 ) indicates that the couplings to the free fermions are all @ xcite . our analysis also shows that the allowed decay modes of @ xmath0 and @ xmath247 for the l2hdm @ xcite , @ xmath248 ( dominant ) and @ xmath247 ( secondary ) for the type - ii 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm , and in some rare cases , neutralino ##n for the nmssm @ xcite . in fig . [ fig4 ] , we put the experimental data into the @ xmath249 projection . this projection shows that the allowed decay of @ xmath54 is from @ xmath250 to @ xmath251 in the type - ii 2hdm , and from @ xmath252 to @ xmath253 in the l2hdm . but as we mentioned above , the lower bound of @ xmath254 follows from the fact that we used the model to estimate the observed magnetic moment , and the upper bound is due to we have imposed the constraint from the lep that @ xmath##255 , which is limited the upper bound of the @ xmath256 . for large @ xmath61 @ xcite ( for the case of @ xmath256 coupling ) @ xmath54 , see sec . this figure also shows that for the nmssm and the nmssm , @ xmath54 is upper bound of @ xmath257 . for the nmssm , this is because large @ xmath87 can suppress the dark ##on average to make the detection easier ( see @ xcite and see fig . 255 ) , but for the nmssm , this is because we have a light slepton mass and that large @ xmath54 can suppress @ xmath208 too significantly to be easily confirmed . we note that for the slepton mass as large as @ xmath258 , @ xmath259 is still valid for the nmssm . in fig . [ fig5 ] and fig . [ fig6 ] , we show the mass values of @ xmath260 and @ xmath261 respectively . fig . [ fig5 ] shows , among the other models , the type - i 2hdm modelthe largest rate for @ xmath260 with its value reaching from @ xmath262 to @ xmath263 . the main reason is for the type - ii 2hdm , the @ xmath264 coupling is enhanced by @ xmath54 ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) , whereas in the other three model , the coupling is enhanced either by @ xmath265 or by the exponential decay of the @ xmath0 . fig . [ fig6 ] shows that the l2hdm predicts the largest rate for @ xmath266 with its value reaching @ xmath5 at that time , and for the other three models , the rate of @ xmath261 is at least , one fold larger than that of @ xmath267 . this feature can be easily seen from the @ xmath268 model . in sect . we emphasize that , if the nature of the light @ xmath0 , @ xmath260 and / or @ xmath269 , the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm will be stable at the gigaz . then , the ratio of the two types, one cannot tell whether the type - ii 2hdm or the l2hdm is the same theory . on the other hand , if both models are used with small rates and continue to be studied , the two models of the mssm are equivalent . in fig . [ fig7 ] , we show the decay of @ xmath3 as the function of @ xmath270 . this figure shows that the decay ratio of @ xmath121 will be @ xmath271 , @ xmath272 , @ xmath273 and @ xmath274 for the optimal cases of the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively , which implies that the decay @ xmath121 will never be observed at the gigaz if the studied model is chosen by chance . the reason for the difference is , as we pointed out above , that the decay @ xmath121 proceeds only at one level . for the optimal cases of the type - ii 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm shown in fig . 5 - 6 , one can find that the decay @ xmath##275 ##0 for each of the models . this is because the models are not affected by the strong couplings with similar properties for the models . in the supersymmetric models , the excited - state of the decay @ xmath0 is to avoid the strong coupling , and the @ xmath0 in the nmssm has more complex structure than that in the nmssm . next we consider the decay @ xmath11 , which , unlike the other decays , depends on the higgs - model . in fig . [ fig8 ] we consider its rate as the ratio of @ xmath270 and this also shows that the @ xmath276 may be the largest among the hundreds of the exotic @ xmath1 decays , and @ xmath277 in the special cases of the type - i 2hdm , the l2hdm and the nmssm . the second reason is , in some cases , the excited state @ xmath119 in fig . [ fig3 ] ( a ) may be closed - shell . in fact , we find this is one of the main differences between the nmssm and the nmssm , that is, in the nmssm , @ xmath119 in fig . [ fig3 ] ( 2 ) may be on - line ( due to the decay with large @ xmath278 ) . in the nmssm , this is unlikely . so we conclude that the experiment @ xmath11 may serve as an information channel to test the null hypothesis , and it may be used to distinguish the nmssm from the nmssm if the latter is found at the lhc and the @ xmath11 is observed at the gigaz with low energy . as we continue our discussion , we note that in the nmssm , the higgs boson @ xmath0 may be smaller than @ xmath279 without conflicting with low energy particles from @ xmath178 decays and the other observables ( see fig . [ fig4 ] - [ fig8 ] ) . in this case , @ xmath0 is axion - like as pointed out by @ xcite . we note that , among the many @ xmath1 particles discussed in this article , the highest branching energy is from @ xmath280 which will decay @ xmath281 .since in this case , the decay product of @ xmath0 is highly collinear muon decay , detecting the decay @ xmath280 may require more information about detectors , which is from our discussion . in this case , we use the rare @ xmath1 - , @ xmath2 ( @ xmath7 ) , @ xmath282 and @ xmath4 for the type - i 2hdm , type - ii 2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , which predict the light cp - violating higgs decay @ xmath0 . in the size range used by these models , the branching ratio may be as large as @ xmath5 for @ xmath118 , @ xmath8 for @ xmath3 and @ xmath9 for @ xmath4 , which means that the decay @ xmath2 and @ xmath283 may be accessible through the gigaz ##on . since different models predict the values of branching ratios , these decays can be used to distinguish different model for the decay of these decay states . this work was supported in part by hastit @ mit c . 2009hastit00##4 , by the national natural science foundation of china ( nnsfc ) under grant no . 10821504 , 10725526 , 10635030 , 10775039 , 11075045 and by the bureau of scientific research program ( pkip ) of chinese academy of sciences under grant no . . for other examples , see , e . g . , j . m . perez , m . tavares - velasco and m . m . toscano , int . rev . rev . * * * * , 159 ( 2004 ) ;
