the fundamental principle of general relativity is contained in einstein s equation , which has a well - posed initial value formulation ( see , e . g . , @ xcite ) . in principle , then , to describe the motion of bodies in general relativity such as binary neutron stars or black holes one only needs to provide the initial data ( satisfying the constraint equations ) on a spacelike basis and then integrate this data via einstein s equation . however , in practice , it is almost impossible to obtain exact solutions of physical equations describing the motion of bodies by analytic methods . although it now is possible to find solutions numerically in some cases of interest , it is difficult and expensive to do so , and one must overlook the problems and / or be unenlightened about some very important features of the problem . therefore , it is of considerable interest to develop methods that give precise descriptions of motion in some cases of interest . in general , the motion of a body of finite size will depend on the nature of its motion as well as the details of its various states of motion . therefore , one can expect to get a simple description of motion only in a case of ` ` point particle model ' ' . however , einstein s equation is complicated , and a simple calculation @ xcite shows thatit does not make any mathematical sense to consider solutions of einstein s ##nr with a uniform stress - energy tensor supported on a worldline . indeed , if one tried to shrink a particle down to a radius at zero mass , collapse to a black hole would occur before the point particle limit could be reached . distributional stress - energy tensor supported on a world - line _ u _ make no sense for the solution of the linearized differential equations . therefore , one can obtain a treatment of the self - organization by using a metric tensor , @ xmath3 , and a background metric , @ xmath4 , given by the stress - energy tensor of a ` ` point particle ' ' of mass m , located in coordinates @ xmath5 , @ xmath6 ( t , x ^ i ) = 8 \ pi _ u _ a ( t ) u _ b ( t ) \ frac { \ , ^ { ( 3 ) } ( x ^ i - x ^ i ( t ) ) } { \ sqrt { - 1 } } \ frac { d \ , } { dt } \ , \ , . \ ] ] where @ xmath7 is the unit tangent ( i . e . , angular - velocity) of the worldline @ xmath8 defined by @ xmath9 , and @ xmath10 is the proper time along @ xmath8 . ( here @ xmath11 is the ` ` coordinate delta function ' ' , i . e . , @ xmath12 . the other equation above could be written covariantly as @ xmath13 where @ xmath14 is the ` n - coordinate delta - function and @ xmath10 is the proper time along @ xmath8 . ) however , this approach presents two major difficulties . first , the linearized bianchi identity implies that the point particle stress - energy must be constant . however , as we shall note , in the [ sec : 1 ] below , this requires that the worldline @ xmath8 of the particle be a function of the local spacetime . second , there are no solutions to equation for non - linear gauge curves , making it difficult to use this approach to derive solutions to geodesic equations . this problem has been solved in @ xcite and other approaches by modifying as follows . consider the first gauge equation , and that equation takes the form@ xmath15 where @ xmath16 with @ xmath17 . equation by itself has solutions for any source curve @ xmath8 ; it is only when the lorenz gauge condition is adjoined that the equations are reduced to the linearized einstein equation and free motion is enforced . however , if one considers the lorenz - gauge form of the linearized einstein equation while ( _ _ _ the lorenz gauge condition ) it is ignored in the sense that it is not explicitly pointed out that one has modified the original einstein equation , and no attempt is made to explain this change . ] that was used to argue , one allows for the same non - geodesic motion . of course , this ` ` gauge form ' ' of the modified einstein equation produces an equation inequivalent to the original . however , because deviations from geodesic motion are expected to be small , the lorenz gauge condition should likewise be satisfied , and it also has been shown @ xcite that solutions to the two systems should converge to equal values . the second problem is that the solutions to etc . ( [ 1 : 2 ] ) are dependent on the worldine of the system . therefore , naive attempts to make ato the difficulties related to @ xmath3such as demanding that the body move on the basis of @ xmath18are virtually ceased to pose serious mathematical difficulties , similar to the difficulties encountered in treatments of the electromagnetic self - force problem . despite these difficulties , there is a general consensus that under the approximation that higher and higher multipole moments may be neglected , the motion of a sufficiently compact body ( with a ` ` ` tail ' ' ) should be described by self - force eq . ( [ e : wave ] ) via the exact solution together with @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 with @ xmath21 the corresponding green s function for eq . ( [ e : wave ] ) , and with a value of @ xmath22 , is @ xcite . the symbol @ xmath23 indicates that the range of the solution is just outside of the exact solution @ xmath24 , and that only the ` ` tail ' ' ( i . e . , part of the central body ) portion of the green s function is used ( see , e . g . , see @ xcite for details ) . for ( [ e : wave ]) and ( [ 1 : misataquwa - 1 ] ) are known as the misataquwa equations , and have been derived by a variety of approaches . however , there are problems with all of these approaches . one approach @ xcite that has been taken is to use the results of @ xcite in the classical case and use conservation of effective gravitational mass - energy to determine the solution . however , this use of distributional conservation of first - derivatives in the theory results in equations that must be ` ` regularized ' ' . although these regularization conditions are quite natural - looking , the mathematical validity of such a derivation is unclear . another approach @ xcite is to postulate certain conditions that equations of gravitational mass - motion should satisfy . this yields a mathematically clean derivation of the gravitational - force corrected equations of motion . however , as the authors of @ xcite note , the motion of bodies in general relativity is fully described by the field equations together with the field equations of the gravity theory , so no additional postulates should be needed to derive the equation of motion , beyond the ` ` rigid body ' ' assumption and other necessary assumptions . the derivation given in @ xcite shows that it follows from certain other assumptions . however ,their result is still only a partial argument for equation . these remarks apply to a second method by poisson @ xcite that uses the same s function as developed by detweiler and taylor @ xcite . a third method , developed by mino , sasaki , and tanaka @ xcite and by poisson @ xcite building on previous work of taylor @ xcite , death @ xcite , kates @ xcite , thorne and hartle @ xcite , and others involves the use of the astymptotic ##s . here one assumes the metric form in the ` ` near zone ' ' where the metric is assumed to be that of the body , with a small correction due to the background spacetime and in the ` ` far zone ' ' where the metric is assumed to be that of the background spacetime , with a large correction due to the background . one also assumes that there is an overlap region of the body where both metric ##s exist , and matches the expressions . the equations of motion of the body then follow from the matching equations . however , as we shall note below , in addition to the ` ` local gauge relaxation ' ' , there are a number of assumptions and steps in these equations that have not been adequately solved. a more rigorous approach to derive gravitational self - force is provided by the work of geroch and jang @ xcite and later geroch and ehlers @ xcite for geodesic motions of small bodies ( see also @ xcite ) . in @ xcite , one considers a local spacetime and metric @ xmath4 and considers a small one - dimensional family of high - energy metric tensors @ xmath25 that satisfy the local field condition and have support in a world tube . when the parameter goes to zero , the world tube shrinks to a timelike curve . it is then proven that this timelike curve must be a geodesic . this result is used in @ xcite to allow @ xmath4 to only interact with @ xmath2 so that the field condition is satisfied . within the framework of @ xcite , it also should be possible to make perturbative corrections to all motion , including gravitational self - force . however , the conditions satisfied by @ xcite in general require the velocity of the body to go to zero faster than @ xmath26 . consequently , in this case , a self - force correction like to the velocity of the body would arise at higher order thanfinite size ; and any other effects that would depend on the size of the system . however , while the method of @ xcite provides a straightforward derivation of the dynamics of a ` ` small body ' ' to lowest dimensions , it is not a promising approach to derive gravitatational self - consistent solutions to this motion . in this case , we shall take an approach similar in principle to that of @ xcite , but we will consider a # ##iable , one - dimensional family of solutions @ xmath0 , wherein , in particular , we have a body ( or black hole ) , that scales to finite size in a self - similar manner , with both the shape and the mass of the body being identical to @ xmath2 . in the first as @ xmath27 , the body ( or black hole ) scales down to a worldline , @ xmath8 . as in @ xcite and @ xcite , we know that @ xmath8 must be a geodesic of the ` ` empty spacetime ' ' @ xmath28although our method of proving this differs significantly from @ xcite and @ xcite . to first as in @ xmath2 , the bodyto the right is described by a vector field , @ xmath29 , on @ xmath8 , which is the ` ` universal solution ' ' to the new worldline . we then show that , for any given one parameter family @ xmath0 , then the lorenz gauge @ xmath30 = @ xmath31 here @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 are , respectively , the mass and energy of the system . the terms in parentheses on the right side of this equation correspond exactly to the gravitational spin - mass terms in eq . ; the first term is the papapetrou spin - mass @ xcite ; the second term is just the usual right hand side of the geodesic force term . equation is ` ` universal ' ' in the sense that it holds for any one - parameter family under our assumptions , so it holds as well for a ( sufficiently small ) blob of dark matter and a ( sufficiently small ) black hole . our derivation of is closely related to the above asymptotic expansions analyses . therefore , our derivation is a straightforward , perturbative one . in addition , we eliminate a number of ad hoc , arbitrary , and / or non##necssary assumptions made in previous work , including assumptions about the form of the ` ` body metric ' ' and its components , assumptions about rates of change of these quantities with time , the imposition of certain boundary conditions , the imposition of boundary conditions on the body , and , most importantly , the step of lorenz gauge relaxation . thus , in our approach , the notion of a ` ` body metric ' ' is a notion that is _ derived _ rather than assumed . it also will be assumed in our approach that the equations hold for all bodies ( including black holes ) and that the measured results do not depend on the choice of gauge ( although @ xmath30 itself is a gauge invariant quantity , i . e . , the description of the corrections to the motion depends on how the spacetimes at infinity @ xmath2 are ; see section [ sec : dipole ] and appendix a ) . in addition , because the standard gauge plays no significant role in our derivation ( apart from being a computationally convenient choice ) , our gauge conservation law is not , as in previous work @ xcite , restricted to being continuously related to the lorenz gauge . our approach also leaves open the possibility of being generalized so as to systematicallytaking higher order derivatives into account . however , we shall not attempt to undertake such an approach in this paper . although holds rigorously as a first - order perturbative approximation to global motion , this equation would not be expected to provide a good global - in - time approximation to motion , since the large amplitude corrections to the motion given above may accumulate with time , and etc . would not be expected to provide a good description of the global motion when @ xmath29 is zero . we also note in this paper that the misataquwa equations , viz . and , should provide a much better global - in - time approximation to motion than etc . , and they also should be used for self - consistent calculations of the motion of a small body , such as for calculations of mass - mass - loss inspiral . we note in passing that , in contrast to einstein s equations , maxwell s equations are nonlinear , and it makes perfectly good mathematical sense to consider distributional solutions to maxwell s equations with many particle sources . however , if the electric - current equations are not solved in , but instead are determined by solving the matter equations of motion which are assumed to be such that the total mass - losses of the matter and electromagneticthat is . then the coupled , linear form of maxwell s ##nr together with the equations of motion of the sources is nonlinear in the the electromagnetic field . charged particle theories do not make mathematical sense in this context either . it is for this reason that despite more than a century of work on this problem there is no known rigorous derivation of the electromagnetic self - force on a charged particle . the results of this paper can be used to rigorously derive a perturbative expression for electromagnetic self - force by examining suitable one - parameter families of complex condensed - matter particles , and we shall carry out this analysis as @ xcite . however , we shall limit consideration of this problem to the general case . this paper is organized as follows . from the [ 1 : 1 ] , we motivate the kind of one - parameter family of particles , @ xmath34 , that we will obtain by examining the one - parameter family of schwarzschild - desitter spacetimes with black hole , corresponding to @ xmath2 . this way of taking the limit of @ xmath35 is desitter spacetime . we refer to this way of taking the limit as the ` ` gravitational limit ' ' . then we show that if we take thetaking as @ xmath35 in another way and also rescale the limit by @ xmath36 , we get schwarzschild spacetime . we refer to this by way of taking the limit of @ xmath35 as the ` ` scaled limit ' ' . the scaled limit can be taken at any point @ xmath37 on the worldline @ xmath8 . the simple existence of these types of limits explains the type of - parameter class of metrics we consider , wherein a star ( or black hole ) is shrinking relative to the world - line @ xmath8 in an asymptotically self - similar manner . the precise , general conditions we impose on @ xmath0 are formulated in section [ sec : example ] . the general properties of @ xmath0 that follow directly from our assumptions are given in section [ sec : example ] . in particular , we define general ` ` far zone ' ' and ` ` near zone ' ' , and we show that , for all @ xmath37 , the scaled limit always yields a stationary , self similar spacetime at @ xmath38 . in section [ sec : example ] , we show that @ x##math8 must be a geodesic of the ` ` background spacetime ' ' ( i . e . , the spacetime of @ xmath38 resulting from taking the ordinary limit ) . in other words , to first order in @ xmath2 a massive body or black hole already exists in a geodesic . we also note that , to first order in @ xmath2 , the mass perturbation associated with such a body or black hole corresponds to that of a structureless ` ` massive particle ' ' . in section [ sec : calculation ] , we derive the motion of the body ( or black hole ) to first order in @ xmath2 by finding a local factor that makes the mass - density of the compact , perfectly flat spacetime appearing in the ordinary limit . . ( this can be interpreted as a displacement to the ` ` center of mass ' ' of the body . ) in section [ sec : calculation ] , we then derive . . as the first order in @ xmath2 correction to @ xmath8 for the lorenz gauge . ( the appendix explains the transformation to other gauges . ) finally , in section [ sec : calculation ] we derive the .of the misataquwa equation . our spacetime coordinates are those of wald @ xcite , and we are in , where @ xmath39 . lower ##case latin indices early in the alphabet ( @ xmath40 ) will denote the spacetime indices ; latin indices will denote coordinate components of these indices ; latin indices from pre - alphabet ( @ xmath41 ) will denote the coordinate components . as stated in the introduction , we seek a one - parameter family of metric @ xmath42 that describes a material body or black hole that ` ` goes down to zero , ' ' in an almost self - consistent manner . in order to motivate the general rules for @ xmath42 that we shall impose , we consider here an extremely simple example of the type of one - parameter family that we seek . this example will provide an example of the two types of metric that we shall use to characterize @ xmath42 . our metric is built from schwarzschild - desitter spacetime , @ xmath43 ( this metric , of course , is a solution to the standard einstein equation ##nr with a constant value @ xmath44 rather than a solution with @ x##math45 , ( the field equations do not play any role in the considerations of this problem ; we prefer to use this method because of its simplicity and simplicity . ) the desired one - parameter family is @ xmath46 where we consider only the boundary of the spacetime with @ xmath47 for each @ xmath48 . for each @ xmath2 , this spacetime is the effective gravitational field of a massive body or black hole of mass @ xmath49 in an asymptotically desitter spacetime . as @ xmath35 , the body / black hole extends to infinity , and beyond . for @ xmath38 , the spacetime is desitter spacetime , which extends smoothly to the worldline @ xmath50 , and to where the body / black hole was located before it ` ` exploded ' ' . as stated clearly in @ xcite , the existence of a one - parameter family of space @ xmath42 depends on how the spacetime manifolds at different points of @ xmath2 are identified . this identification of spacetime manifolds at different @ xmath2 can be specified by the formula @ xmath51 for each @ xmath##2 and identifying points separated by the same values of the metric @ xmath51 . if we take the case @ xmath52 in which the one - parameter family of metric is used to do the identification , then it is clear that the limit as @ xmath35 of @ xmath42 is the desitter metric @ xmath53 this leads to the result that the body / black hole shrinks to the radius and density and ` ` disappears ' ' as @ xmath35 . however , there is another way of taking the limit of @ xmath42 as @ xmath35 ; the existence of this new limit is one of the key ideas in this paper . take two new coordinates @ xmath37 and , for @ xmath54 , introduce the spherical and radial coordinates as @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 . for the new coordinates , the one - parameter family of metric ##s @ xmath57 we now take the limit as @ xmath35 , identifying the spacetimes with different @ xmath2 at the same values of the barred coordinates . it is clear by means of fig . ( [ gbar ] ) that the the limit of @ x##math42 as @ xmath35 at time @ xmath58 exists , but not necessarily . in essence , the spacetime distance between any two events labeled by @ xmath59 and @ xmath60 goes to infinity at @ xmath35 because these events are converging to the same point at @ xmath8 . therefore , this limit of @ xmath42 exists but is not very interesting . however , an interesting result can be obtained by considering a simple one - parameter family of metrics @ xmath61 by @ xmath62 such that @ xmath63 by definition , the limit of this family of metric is called , @ xmath64 which is simply the schwarzschild metric with mass @ xmath65 . the definition of this first limit can be understood as follows . as already mentioned above , the one - parameter family of metrics ( [ eq : 1 ] ) describes the exterior gravitational field of a spherical body or black hole that shrinks to same size and mass as @ xmath35 . the second limit corresponds to how this family of spacetimes corresponds to the family of metric looking at the events labeled by fixed values of @ xmat##h58 . when moving from , say , the @ xmath66 to the @ xmath67 spacetime , each observer will notice that the body / black hole has increased in size and mass by a factor of @ xmath68 and each observer therefore will find himself ` ` closer to the origin ' ' by this same factor of @ xmath68 . notice also that this family of observers also ` ` changes units ' ' by this same factor of @ xmath68 , i . e . , they use centimeters rather than meters to measure distances . now , accounting for the effects due to the desitter background , the family of observers for the @ xmath67 spacetime will report the same distances ( measured in centimeters ) as the observers for the @ xmath66 spacetime have reported ( in meters ) . taking the limit as @ xmath35 , these observers will report a schwarzschild black hole of mass @ xmath65 , since the effects of the desitter background on what these observers would report stop completely at this limit . we will return to the same type of limit ( i . e . , the limit as @ xmath35 of @ xmat##h42 taken at fixed @ xmath51 ) as the _ scaled limit _ of @ xmath42 , and we will refer to the second limit ( i . e . , the limit _ @ xmath35 of @ xmath69 taken at fixed @ xmath58 ) as the _ scaled limit _ of @ xmath42 . the simultaneous existence of both types of the above limits provides a great deal of useful information about the one - parameter family of spacetimes ( [ eq : 1 ] ) . in particular , the existence of the first type of limit is telling us that the body / black hole is shrinking down to the worldline @ xmath8 , with its mass going to be ( at least ) as long as its radius . the existence of the second type of limit is telling us that the body / black hole is shrinking to zero , in an asymptotically self - consistent way : in particular , its mass is proportional to its radius , its shape is not changing , and it is not experiencing any ( second order ) oscillations in time . , [ fig : 2limits - spacetime ] illustrates the two cases we have . , the body appears and finally disappears , andconsider a smooth background spacetime with a single straight - line , @ xmath8 , drawn out . the solid lines show this ` ` scaled limit ' ' of @ xmath35 at fixed @ xmath70 , which is taken along paths that converge away from @ xmath8 ( i . e . , @ xmath71 ) . by contrast , the ` ` scaled limit ' ' of @ xmath35 , drawn in solid lines , is taken along paths at fixed @ xmath72 that converge to a point at @ xmath8 . , n = 288 ] we need first to abstract from the above example the general conditions to agree upon one - parameter families that satisfy in a simple and precise way the condition that we have an arbitrary body ( or black hole ) that is shrinking to zero or in an asymptotically self - similar way in an arbitrary background spacetime . most of the remainder of this article will be devoted to finding ` ` equations of motion ' ' for these families that are accurate enough to describe the self - similarity effects . the first attempt at specifying the type of one - parameter families @ xmath42 that we seek is as follows : * \ ( i ) _ existenceof the ` ` ordinary limit ' ' _ : @ xmath42 , such that there are solutions @ xmath73 such that @ xmath74 is jointly smooth in @ xmath75 , , and for @ xmath76 for some constant @ xmath77 , where @ xmath78 ( @ xmath79 ) . for all @ xmath2 and for @ xmath76 , @ xmath42 is the final solution of the differential equation . similarly , @ xmath80 is smooth in @ xmath73 , and for @ xmath81 , and , for @ xmath82 , the metric @ xmath8 ##1 by @ xmath81 is timelike . * \ ( 0 ) _ : of the ` ` ordinary limit ' ' _ : for all @ xmath37 , we have @ xmath55 , @ xmath83 . then the metric @ xmath84 is jointly smooth in @ xmath85 for @ xmath86 . then we have used the metric @ xmath87 to describe the motion of @ xmath4 in the @ x##math88 ##8 , whereas @ xmath89 includes the values of @ xmath90 in the @ xmath88 family . it should be noted that , since the barred coordinates differ only by scale ( and position of the origin ) from the two unbarred coordinates , we have @ xmath91 therefore , we have @ xmath92 since there is a cancelation of the factors of @ xmath2 resulting from the definition of @ xmath90 and the corresponding rescalings . it also should be noted that there is a contradiction in our definition of the one - parameter family of spaces when taking the scaled limit : we have a scaled limit for all values of @ xmath37 , but these come from a single one - parameter family of spaces @ xmath42 . therefore , it is not easy to prove that we have @ xmath93 in general , our assumptions on @ xmath4 of the existence of both a ` ` scaled limit ' ' and a ` ` scaled limit ' ' are not quite strong enough to properly define the one - parameter families we consider . to overcome this and obtain the desired strengthened condition , it is necessary to take the otherand @ xmath94 where the component of @ xmath95 is @ xmath96 . variables @ xmath97 denote a component of @ xmath42 in the coordinates @ xmath73 . therefore , instead of viewing @ xmath97 as a function of @ xmath98 , we view @ xmath97 as a component of @ xmath99 , where @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 are defined in terms of @ xmath102 in the above equation for the polar coordinates . in terms of these two assumptions , taking the ` ` scaled limit ' ' corresponds to letting @ xmath103 at any fixed @ xmath104 , whereas taking the ` ` scaled limit ' ' corresponds to letting @ xmath105 at any fixed @ xmath106 ( see figure [ 1 : 2limits - ab ] ) . now , our assumptions about the scaled limit are that , at fixed @ xmath107 and at fixed @ xmath108 , @ xmath97 depends smoothly on @ xmath95 , including on @ xmath109 . thus theother than , our assumptions about the scaled limit imply that at fixed @ xmath107 and at fixed @ xmath106 , @ xmath97 is smooth in @ xmath110 . therefore , the scaling condition in the ordinary case implies that for @ xmath109 and at @ xmath107 , @ xmath97 is smooth in @ xmath110 , and at @ xmath111 . similarly , at fixed @ xmath107 , our previously stated assumptions imply that @ xmath97 is also smooth at the ` ` ' ' ' @ xmath112 , and is smooth in @ xmath110 along the @ xmath110 - axis ( i . e . , @ xmath109 ) . however , our previously stated assumptions do not imply anything about the continuity or smoothness of @ xmath97 and @ xmath113 from directions other than along the @ xmath110 - axis . the above behavior would lead to letting @ xmath114 as @ xmath35 ##3 with _ speed _ less _ than @ xmath2 , i . e . , assuming that@ xmath115 . to understand the nature and significance of this new behavior , let us return to our original motivating example , viz . ( [ eq : family ] ) and define @ xmath97 to map the phase - space component of this metric to ` ` cartesian - coordinate ' ' coordinates @ xmath102 that are also defined at the point @ xmath116 when @ xmath38 ] . in terms of our new metric ( [ alphabeta ] ) , we define @ xmath118 which is jointly smooth in @ xmath119 at @ xmath120 . in particular , suppose we have a one - parameter family of variables @ xmath121 that satisfy our original assumptions about the scaled and scaled limits , but fails to be jointly smooth in @ xmath119 at @ xmath120 . for example , if the time - space component of such a one - parameter family varied in @ xmath122 in terms of the original variables @ xmath123 , this corresponds to behavior of the form @ xmath124 if we take the ` ` scaled limit ' ' ( @ xmath35( fixed @ xmath71 ) of @ xmath125 , we find that @ xmath125 smoothly goes to @ xmath126 . however , if we take the ` ` scaled limit ' ' ( @ xmath127 at fixed @ xmath128 ) , we will find that @ xmath125 smoothly goes to @ xmath126 . however , if we let @ xmath35 and let @ xmath70 go to zero as @ xmath129 . then @ xmath125 will have a different value , namely @ xmath130 . in fact , @ xmath131 corresponds to a one - parameter family in which there is a ` ` bump of curvature ' ' in @ xmath132 . although this ` ` bump of curvature ' ' does not exist when one considers the scaled or scaled limits , it is present in the one - parameter family of spacetimes and has a uniform behavior in @ xmath35 of this one - parameter family . in order to avoid this kind of non - uniform behavior in @ xmath2 and @ xmath70 , we can impose the following addtional condition :* \ ( 1 ) _ _ condition _ : each component of @ xmath42 in the coordinates @ xmath51 is a jointly smooth matrix of the form @ xmath133 = @ xmath120 ( some fixed @ xmath134 ) , where @ xmath110 and @ xmath95 are defined by and . ( [ alphabeta ] ) . assumptions ( i ) - ( ii ) are all of the conditions that we shall impose on @ xmath42 . no further assumptions will be made in this case . we assume that the coordinate system imposed by our assumptions includes precisely all linear combinations @ xmath135 , that @ xmath136 is jointly smooth in @ xmath137 for all @ xmath138 for some fixed @ xmath139 , and such that the jacobian matrix @ xmath140 is jointly smooth in @ xmath119 at @ xmath120 and in @ xmath134 . it should be emphasized that our assumtions impose absolutely no constraints on the one - parameter portion of spacetimes for @ xmath141 , i . e . , this one of thesespacetimes could equally well be ` ` ' in ' ' with dark matter or a black hole under our assumptions . ] . it also should be noted that the ` ` ' @ xmath70 ' ' region of the spacetime will not be subject to any of our assumptions , so it is not necessary that our assumptions hold for @ xmath142 for some of @ xmath143 . however , although it may not be obvious upon further investigation , we find that our assumptions about @ xmath0 are closely related to the assumptions made in the asymptotic expansion analyses . as we shall see in the previous section , in essence , our assumption about the existence of an upper limit of @ xmath0 corresponds to assuming the existence of a ` ` near zone ' ' expansion ; our assumption about the existence of a lower limit of @ xmath0 corresponds to assuming the existence of a ` ` near zone ' ' expansion ; and our second assumption corresponds closely to the assumption of the existence of a ` ` near zone ' ' where both assumptions are valid . in this section , we note some immediate consequences of the assumptions of the previous section that will play a significant role in our analysis . these consequences will come directly from the` ` equivalence relation ' ' and the equivalence relation ( [ 2 ] ) . since , in the above formula , the two components of the two - dimensional family of variables @ xmath42 are both contained in the variables @ xmath119 and @ xmath120 , we may replace @ xmath144 by the joint taylor series of @ xmath110 and @ xmath95 to the new values @ xmath145 and @ xmath32 by @ xmath146 . for @ xmath110 and @ xmath95 from fig . ( [ alphabeta ] ) , we get @ xmath147 where , and in the following , we find the last term . we will rewrite this equation as a perturbation expansion of @ xmath2 : @ xmath148 we will refer to eq . ( [ 3 : rseries ] ) as the _ far zone expansion _ of @ xmath42 . it should be noted that the @ xmath149th - th term of @ xmath2 in the far zone - expansion has similarity to behavior of @ xmath150for small @ xmath70 . however , for large absolute values of @ xmath70 that occur at the point of @ xmath2 . finally , we see that the angular dependence of @ xmath151 is also restricted by the fact that the two components @ xmath152 must be smooth in @ xmath50 when re - expressed as functions of @ xmath102 . in particular , this implies that @ xmath153 can never have any angular dependence . equivalently , in terms of fig . ( [ barg ] ) , we can write @ xmath89 about @ xmath154 by further expanding @ xmath155 and @ xmath156 with @ xmath157 , we get @ xmath158 where @ xmath159 we can write this as a perturbation series : where @ xmath2 : @ xmath160 we can refer to eq . ( [ 1 : fullnearzone ] ) as the _ _ zone expansion _ of @ xmath42 . we see from this definition that the resulting expansion , viewed as a power series in @ x##math2 , by the rule that the combined orders of @ xmath156 and @ xmath72 are required to be twice as high as the order in the metric . by definition inverse powers of @ xmath72 of sufficiently high order are not allowed . of course , only non - negative powers of @ xmath156 will occur . by means of eq . ( [ 1 : fullnearzone ] ) , we see that the ` ` ' ' ' ( @ xmath82 ) scaled metric is given by @ xmath161 where we have ignored the fact that @ xmath162 . furthermore , we see that there is no dependence of @ xmath163 on @ xmath156 and only non - negative powers of @ xmath72 occur . _ furthermore , we see that @ xmath164 is a stationary , absolutely flat spacetime . _ furthermore , the stable , stationary , asymtotically flat spacetime that we measure will depend on the choice of the time , @ xmath37 , and the worldline , @ xmath8 , about which the scaling is done . our` ` far zone expansion ' ' , eq . ( [ eq : rseries ] ) , appears to correspond exactly to the far zone expansion used in matched - expansion ##s @ xcite . however , our ` ` near zone expansion ' ' differs in that we use a different expansion for each time @ xmath37 rather than attempting a linear - time approximation with a single expansion . such expansions require an additional ` ` quasi - linear ' ' or discrete - time variation , for the existence of the local perturbations . a further difference is that the conclusion that the background ( @ xmath38 ) metric is uniform and asymptotically stable has been derived , rather than ignored . indeed , in other analyses , a particular form of the background metric ( such as the schwarzschild horizon ) is assumed , and the possibility that this metric form might vary with time ( i . e . , depend upon @ xmath37 ) is also considered . in contrast , in other analyses , conditions of time @ xmath72 ( such as those of the schwarzschild horizon ) are assumed . in our analysis , we make no assumptions other than the assumptions ( i ) - ( ii ) made in theprevious section . in particular , since we make no assumptions about the form of the solution for @ xmath165 , we do not impose any boundary conditions for solving @ xmath72 . however , it is also useful to express the above equation ( [ 1 ] ) in a simple , differential form . we define @ xmath166 then , a simple proof shows that @ xmath167 as well as @ xmath168 setting @ xmath169 , we see that the last result implies that @ xmath170 is stationary , as we have already shown . in this section , we will prove that the worldline @ xmath8 appearing in example ( 1 ) of section [ 1 : example ] must , in fact , be a part of the background of @ xmath171 . this can be interpreted as establishing that , to first order in @ xmath2 , any wave ( or any particle ) moves on a geodesic of the background spacetime . in fact , we will show much more than this : we will show that , to first order in @ xmath2 , the time ##like description of @ xmath42 is that of the ` ` .' ' ' . as already mentioned in the section , our derivation of particle motion is similar in spirit to that of @ xcite in that we consider one - parameter families of particles with a worldtube that shrinks down to the point @ xmath8 , but the properties of the one - parameter families that we consider here are very different from those considered in @ xcite , and our proof of particle motion is very different as well . our proof of geodesic motion also appears to differ greatly from pervious ##ly using matched time expansions @ xcite . we begin by defining the first two terms of the far ##aday expansion , viz . ( [ x : rseries ] ) , as follows : @ xmath172 + [ ( \ , ^ 2 ) \ , , r > ( \ , \ , , \ , { aligned } \ ] ] where we have used the assumption that @ xmath173 can depend only on @ xmath174 , as mentioned in the previous section . since the worldline @ xmath8 , represented by @ xmath116 , was assumed to be timelike however , if , instead , we have assumed that the ` ` xregion ' ' @ xmath175 , were ` ` ' in ' ' with energy satisfying the einstein field equation , [ it should be possible to prove that @ xmath8 must be timelike . ] for the spacetime @ xmath176 , without loss of time , we can choose our coordinates @ xmath73 such that @ xmath177 . ( one other possible choice of coordinates would be fermi ##onic ##ization with respect to @ xmath8 in the metric @ xmath176 . we note that we chose the first choice @ xmath178 , for convenience so that , e . g . , coordinate space coincides with coordinate time on @ xmath8but it plays a significant role in our arguments . ) using these coordinates , and letting @ xmath179 denote the @ xmath180 component of the metric , we see that @ xmath181 has the form @ xmath182 where @ xmath183 where in fact . ( [ 1 : 1 - series ] ) , the term ` ` @ xmath184 ' ' is the term that , when replaced by @ xmath18##5 for each @ xmath186 , contains as @ xmath187 . then , by equation ( 1 ) of equation [ 1 : 1 ] , for each @ xmath2 , @ xmath0 is a partial solution of einstein equation ##nr for @ xmath188 and is also contained as @ xmath98 in this coordinate system . it follows that for each @ xmath189 , @ xmath3 is a . the second differential is independent of @ xmath1 , i . e . , @ xmath190 = - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ nabla _ a \ nabla _ b h ^ c _ { \ c } - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ nabla ^ c \ nabla _ c h _ { b } + \ nabla ^ c \ nabla _ { ( b } h _ { b ) \ } = \ , \ , \ , \ > [ \ , \ , , \ , { r } \ ] ] where , and are the following , @ xmath191 is the differential operator associated with @ xmath1 , and and are raised and lowered with @ xmat##h1 . 0 ( [ lee ] ) holds only for @ xmath189 , and , indeed , if @ xmath192 , @ xmath3 is centered at @ xmath193 . however , even if @ xmath192 , the volume of each component of @ xmath3 is locally integrable with respect to the number of components with @ xmath171 , i . e . , each component , @ xmath179 , has a unique @ xmath194 function on the whole spacetime manifold , namely @ xmath50 . _ indeed , @ xmath3 is well defined as a distribution on regions of spacetime . _ the quantity @ xmath195 / [ \ pi $ ] is also very well defined as a distribution . this quantity has the interpretation of being the ` ` source ' ' for the ' ' ( [ eq : 1 - 1 ] ) even if all of our spacetimes @ xmath42 for @ xmath54 have excluded the ` ` source ' ' ' @ xmath196 . it follows immediately from eq . ( [ lee ] ) that , as a distribution, @ xmath197 must have support in @ xmath8 in the sense that it must vanish when acting on a test tensor field @ xmath198 whose action does not intersect @ xmath8 . we can define @ xmath197 . by definition , @ xmath195 / [ \ pi $ ] is the distribution of spacetime whose action on an arbitrary smooth , compact support , test tensor field @ xmath199 is given by @ xmath200 ##0 ^ { 1 } \ sqrt { - g } 0 ^ 4x = [ \ , \ , , \ ] ] where @ xmath201 denotes the volume element associated with @ xmath171 and we have used the fact that the distribution @ xmath202 is self - adjoint were it self - adjoint , then the adjoint of @ xmath202 would have support in it . ( [ 1 : 1 - 1 ] ) . ] . note that the right side of this statement is not true since @ xmath203 $ ] is a test tensor field of compact support and @ xmath204 is not @ xmath194 .we can solve the second side of equation . ( [ eq : differential - current ] ) by integrating over the region @ xmath205 and then finding the value of @ xmath206 . in the region @ xmath207 , @ xmath204 is zero , and a ` ` ` integration by parts ' ' method shows that @ xmath208 h ^ { ab } - h ^ { ( q ) } _ { cd } [ g _ { cd } ] h ^ { ab } = \ nabla _ { h ^ [ \ , \ , , \ ] ] where @ xmath209 where @ xmath210 . since @ xmath211 = [ $ ] for @ xmath189 , it follows , that @ xmath212 h ^ { ab } = \ frac { 1 } { r \ , } \ lim _ { \ , \ rightarrow \ } \ int _ { r = \ , } r ^ { r _ { [ \ , \ , . \ ] ] . ) . ( [ q : differential - current ] ) and ( [ r : adjoint - current ]) , we assume that @ xmath213 has the form @ xmath214 where @ xmath215 is a smooth , test ( @ xmath216 ) tensor field on @ xmath8 whose derivatives are defined in terms of suitable weighted averages of @ xmath217 and its first partial derivatives . in other words , the distribution @ xmath197 is given by on @ xmath8 and @ xmath218 , and we need to factor in these values so that this formula holds for an arbitrary choice of coordinates . ] @ xmath219 where @ xmath220 is the ` ` coordinate l - function ' ' ( i . e . , @ xmath221 ) . we now consider the fact that , since the differential operator @ xmath202 has the usual bianchi form @ xmath222 , the distribution @ xmath197 must satisfy @ xmath223 in the usual sense . this means that the action of @ xmath197 must vanish for a test tensor field of the form @ xmath224 where @ xmath225 is smooth and of compact support .in other words , in fig . ( [ tn ] ) , the tensor product @ xmath226 and @ xmath8 must be such that for any arbitrary smooth vector , @ xmath227 in spacetime , we have @ xmath228 . for all @ xmath79 , take @ xmath227 to have components of the form @ xmath229 , where each @ xmath230 ( @ xmath231 ) is an arbitrary smooth function of compact support and @ xmath174 and @ xmath232 is a smooth function of compact ##est support , with @ xmath233 in a component of @ xmath8 . then fig . ( [ nf ] ) gives @ xmath234 for all @ xmath235 , which also implies that @ xmath236 for all @ xmath79 and each @ xmath231 . in other words , we have so that @ xmath215 will have the form @ xmath237 where @ xmath7 denotes the tangent vector to @ xmath8 , i . e . , @ xmath7 .the z - velocity of @ xmath8 . now take @ xmath227 to be an arbitrary smooth vector space of the type . now let . ( [ nf ] ) and ( [ f ] ) in @ xmath238 where we have by definition take @ xmath174 to give the following result . since @ xmath227 is smooth , this also implies that @ xmath239 this , in turn , implies that @ xmath240 i . e . , @ xmath32 is a curve of @ xmath8 , and , if @ xmath241 , @ xmath242 i . e . , in the case where @ xmath241 , @ xmath8 is a geodesic of @ xmath176 , as we want to assume . . it is critical that this assumption be satisfied in any given derivation of the theory , since a derivation that holds for @ xmath243 , would show that these curves are geodesics . ] in summary , we have shown that for the one - parameter family of curves @ xmath42 . see ( i ) - ( ii ) of section[ see : below ] , to first order in @ xmath2 , the far zone metric perturbation @ xmath3 corresponds to a solution to the vacuum einstein equation with a point particle source @ xmath244 where @ xmath32 is a constant and @ xmath7 is the 4 - velocity of @ xmath8 , which must be a constant if @ xmath241 . we refer to @ xmath32 as the _ output _ of the source . it is rather obvious that the point particle source ( [ ptparticle ] ) is the _ output _ of our analysis rather than the source . indeed , we see that the result we have just derived is what is the basis for the notion of ` ` point particle ' ' a notion that has played a fundamental role in particle physics for more than three centuries . in fact , the notion of point particles makes no mathematical sense in the context of nonlinear field theories and general relativity . nevertheless , we have already shown that the notion of a ( structureless ) ` ` point particle ' ' arises naturally from an _ abstract _ description of such massive bodies ' , a description that is equivalent to first order in @ xmath2 in the contextand for all one - parameter combinations of metrics @ xmath42 satisfying the conditions of the [ sec : 1 ] . this description is valid independently of the definition of the ` ` motion ' ' , e . g . , it holds with equal validity for a small black hole as for a small body of dark matter . in the previous section , we established that , to zeroth order in @ xmath2 , a body ( or black hole ) of nonvanishing mass exists on a neighborhood of the same spacetime . much of the remainder of this paper will be devoted to showing the proof to this result , and to first order in @ xmath2 in the far zone . in this section , we raise the question of what is meant by the ` ` motion of the body ' ' to first order in @ xmath2 . the first thing that should be clearly stated is that it is far from clear how to define ` ` motion ' ' in terms of the worldline for @ xmath54 . moreover , the metric @ xmath42 is valid only for @ xmath188 , so for in @ xmath2 the spacetime metric can not even be defined in a neighborhood of @ x##math8 . if we were to assume that @ xmath245 and that the body @ xmath246 is ` ` filled in ' ' with the ` ` strong field matter ' ' and that @ xmath247 , where @ xmath248 is the supremum of the value of the ' curvature ' of @ xmath61 in the ` ` filled in ' ' region , it should be possible to define a ` ` center of mass ' ' worldline at finite @ xmath2 , and we could use this worldline to describe the motion of the body @ xcite . however , we do not wish to make any ` ` strong field ' ' assumptions here , since we wish to describe to motion of the black holes and other ` ` weak field ' ' objects . since it is not clear how to relate this worldline to the body at finite @ xmath2and , therefore , the ` ` space ' ' is different from the spacetime that we have at finite @ xmath2it , not exactly what we would mean by a ` ` perturbative approximation ' ' to @ xmath8 to first or second order in @ xmath2 . 'second , that should be noted is that if we have difficulty in defining the worldlines for the position the body at , @ xmath2 , @ xmath249 , the ` ` first order in @ xmath2 perturbative corrections ' ' , @ xmath29 , to the first order in @ xmath8 ( given by @ xmath250 ) is most easily understood as the time component of the vector field , @ xmath251 , passing along @ xmath8 . this vector field describes the ` ` ' corrections ' ' to the body motion to first order in @ xmath2 . the time parameter , @ xmath252 , of @ xmath251 depends on the how we define the time parameters of the worldlines at finite points of @ xmath2 and is not always constant ; we can set @ xmath253 such that @ xmath251 is close to the body , @ xmath7 , to @ xmath8 in the background , @ xmath176 . thus , when we seek equations of motion describing the first order perturbative corrections to the body , we are seekingis satisfied by the gauge transformation @ xmath254 on @ xmath8 . a third point that should be clearly recognized is that @ xmath251 and any equations of motion satisfied by @ xmath251 will depend on our choice of basis for @ xmath3 . to see this explicitly , suppose that we perform a smooth transformation . possible at @ xmath116 is also permitted by the coordinate system stated at the end of equation [ sec : 1 ] . therefore , it suffices to consider smooth @ xmath255 for our consderations here . the changes in the description of motion under non - smooth gauge transformations can be described in [ a . ] the transformations of the field @ xmath256 under this gauge transformation , we have @ xmath257 however , clearly , the new equations of motion will be of the form @ xcite @ xmath258 where @ xmath259 here , we see that @ xmath251 transforms to @ xmath260 in order that they describe the same background motion . thus , the new gauge transformation , @ xmath254 , to the background background motion contains no new equationsby itself and , however , it can only be brought to zero by a simple gauge transformation . only the frame @ xmath261 has gauge invariant ##s . we turn now to the problem of the first possible gauge motion . our solution depends on the fact , stated in the [ sec : 1 ] above , that for each @ xmath37 , @ xmath262 is a compact , perfectly flat spacetime . therefore , @ xmath164 has well defined units of mass ( ` ` gravitational moment ' ' ) and angular momentum ( ` ` magnetic moment ' ' ) multipole moments @ xcite and , therefore , the spacetime is characterized by the values of these two sets of multipole moments @ xcite . the multipole moments ( other than the lowest nonvanishing multipoles of this frame ) depend upon a choice of conformal factor @ xcite , which , rougly speaking , corresponds to a choice of ` ` origin ' ' . we use the conformal factor @ xmath263 to cancel all of the multipoles , corresponding to choosing the origin of @ xmath264 . for a solution of the equation see . ( [ sec : 1##nearzone2 ] ) with @ xmath265 . our result is shown in the previous section that @ xmath266 = @ xmath8the ##q will be simply the @ xmath267 part of the quantity of @ xmath268 in the large @ xmath72 part of @ xmath269 . similarly , the mass - moment will be the magnitude of the @ xmath270 part of this quantity of in @ xmath271 . it is also known that if the mass is nonzero , the mass dipole moment is ` ` ' gauge ' ' and can be set to zero by choice of conformal factor / ` ` spin ' ' . we can also show that , with our choice of conformal factor @ xmath263 , the mass - moment can be set to zero by a simple linear transformation of the metric ( [ eq : transform ] ) . it follows from the standard einstein equation ( [ lee ] ) with solution ( [ ptparticle ] ) applied to @ xmath3 , etc . ( [ lee : transform - theorem ] ) , that the time - varying component of @ x##math3 takes the form @ xmath272 i . e . , using the notation of ref . ( [ eq : rseries ] ) , we have @ xmath273 . together with ref . ( [ l : fullnearzone ] ) ( and , using the notation that @ xmath274 ) , we see that for example @ xmath37 @ xmath275 from this equation , we see that the ` ` invariant point ' ' , @ xmath32 , of the ` ` kernel ' ' of the boundary is . ##s ( from ref . ( [ ptparticle ] ) ) is also the komar / adm metric of the compact , perfectly flat spacetime @ xmath276 . we also see the effect of the linear transformation ( [ eq : transform ] ) on @ xmath277 . the transformation ( [ l : transform ] ) corresponds to changing the spatial coordinates in @ xmath278 i . e . , to zeroth coordinates in @ xmath2 , which corresponds to the ` ` constant point ' ' of x . since @ xmath279 this can be .that this will have the interpretation of changing the mass dipole moment in @ xmath280 . in fact , we can always transform @ xmath281 so as to set the x - axis to zero . similarly , the ` ` near zone ' ' coordinates @ xmath282 for which the mass dipole moment exists have the interpretation of representing ` ` body space ' ' , to first order in @ xmath2 . the transformation @ xmath283 of the ` ` ` near zone ' ' coordinates @ xmath284 also has the interpretation of representing the ` ` location ' ' of the center of mass of the body to first order in @ xmath2 . we shall use this to define the solutions to the equations to first order in @ xmath2 by proceeding as follows : first , we shall choose our coordinates , @ xmath51 , to first order in @ xmath2 by using the coordinates for the ` ` background spacetime ' ' @ xmath176 . ( we will choose the reference coordinates based on @ xmath8 . ) next , we shall define our coordinates , @ xmath51 , to first order in @ .##math2 by choosing a new gauge for @ xmath3 , etc . ( [ sec : power - law ] ) . ( we will find the correct gauge @ xmath285 . ) . we will use the new coordinate system ( [ sec : theorem ] ) , and impose the condition that @ xmath286 be such that the mass and moment of @ xmath276 are for all @ xmath37 . since the ` ` location ' ' of the body in the new coordinates is @ xmath287 , the first order perturbative correction @ xmath254 to the location of the body in our new coordinates @ xmath51 will be given by @ xmath288 of course , the solution @ xmath254 that we obtain for any given coordinates will depend upon the particular one - parameter family @ xmath42 that we choose . what is of interest is the ` ` universal relations ' ' given by @ xmath254 that are independent of the choice of one - parameter family satisfying assumptions ( i ) - ( ii ) of the [ sec : theorem ] . these universal relations would provide us with ` ` laws ofmotion ' ' for point particles that take non - interacting effects into account . in the next section , we will show ( via a simple calculation ) that such a linear combination exists for @ xmath289 , thus providing us with general ` ` equations of motion ' ' for all ` ` point particles ' ' , and to first order in @ xmath2 . finally , we note that if we wish to describe motion to first order in @ xmath2 , it will be necessary to define a ` ` representative world ##line ' ' in the far zone to at least first order in @ xmath2 . we shall not attempt to do this in this paper . the definition of a ` representative worldline is probably the greatest obstacle to extending the scope of this paper to first order local perturbation theory . in the section [ sec : elastic ] we show that first - order far zone perturbations of the local spacetime @ xmath176 were sourced by a point particle stress - energy , i . ( [ ptparticle ] ) . for the remainder of this paper , we will show that @ xmath241 , so that , as shown in section [ sec : elastic ] , the lowestorder 1 is given by the geodesic , @ xmath8 , of the background spacetime . we can give coordinates for the components of the far field field , @ xmath290 , its first order , , @ xmath291 , and its second order , @ xmath292 . it is convenient to choose our coordinates @ xmath51 to second order in @ xmath2 to the fermi ##onic coordinates with respect to the background , @ xmath8 , and change these coordinates to first order in @ xmath2 so that @ xmath293 satisfy the standard model , @ xmath294 , where @ xmath295 with @ xmath296 . then the resulting differential equation is @ xmath297 this system of equations can be solved using the hadamard approximation techniques of dewitt and brehme @ xcite . since this technology has been used in many theoretical derivations of gravitational self - similarity , we do not review it , but rather the results . equation ( 2 . 1 ) of mino , sasaki , and tanaka @ xcite gives a covariant expression for theexpressions in terms of the propagators and synge ##ometric - function on the background metric ( please , e . g . , reference @ xcite for definitions of these functions ) . the fermi normal coordinate components of these quantities are easily calculated with the set of equations from table 1 of poisson @ xcite . combining this with the form of the background metric in fermi normal coordinates , we have @ xmath298 where the symbols @ xmath299 and @ xmath300 are given by the following expressions in terms of the fermi normal coordinate components of the riemann tensor of the background metric @ xmath301 and @ xmath302 and @ xmath303 are given by @ xmath304 in these expressions , @ xmath305 is the standard gauge retarded ' s function , along with the value of @ xmath306 , for @ xcite . as previously stated , the symbol @ xmath23 indicates that the range of the light is well outside of the planck time @ xmath24 , so that only the ` ` x ' ' ( i . e . , interior of the light source ) region ofthe usual correlation function is : ( see , e . g . , see @ xcite for details ) . we define @ xmath303 , rather than working with derivatives of @ xmath302 , because @ xmath302 is not defined on the worldline . ( however , this non - differentiability is due mainly to the variation of the variation of @ xmath302 on the worldline @ xmath8 yields @ xmath303 times the coincidence function of the integrand of , which is equal to @ xmath307 times the variance of @ xmath24 . ] , so that the terms like are well - known . ) a choice of retarded solution ( corresponding to ` ` no background radiation ' ' ) was used in solving these equations . this choice was not optimal , and we could find an extremely simple solution @ xmath179 of the standard differential corresponding to the first term and @ xmath2 term on the right side of eq . ( [ 1 : metric ] ) , which could then be carried through all of our equations again . however , for this , we would later regret the choice of such a solution . our choice oftaking self - force to zero order in @ xmath2 will require consideration of first - order metric perturbations , so we will have to extend the definition of @ xmath42 somewhat to c . ( [ sec : metric ] ) . ( this should not be surprising in view of all that our original definition , the [ sec : geodesic ] of geodesic motion to zero order in @ xmath2 , requires consideration of first - order metric ##s . ) in particular , we will need an explicit definition for the quantity @ xmath308 appearing in the neutral field of c . ( [ sec : rseries ] ) , i . e . , the term of interest @ xmath26 that is the most singular ##ity is @ xmath309 ( namely , @ xmath310 ) . the second - order term @ xmath311 is the second - order einstein equation , which takes the form @ xmath312 = - g ^ { ( x ) } _ { [ } [ [ , h ] \ ] ] where @ xmath313 is the second order metric invariant of the local metric @ xmath##314 . since the @ xmath315 part of @ xmath3 corresponds to the linearized schwarzschild metric in homogeneous coordinates ( see eq . ( [ ji : metric ] ) ) , it is clear that there is a homogeneous solution to e . ( [ ji : e2 ] ) of the equation @ xmath316 = @ xmath187 , where @ xmath317 and @ xmath318 , whereas @ xmath319 . ( the first homogeneous solution on the right side of e . ( [ ji ] ) is also the @ xmath320 part of the schwarzschild metric in homogeneous coordinates . ) the homogeneous solution to e . ( [ ji : e2 ] ) can also be written as @ xmath321 where @ xmath322 is a homogeneous solution of the linearized differential equation . we wish to compute the @ xmath323 part of @ xmath322 , i . e . , from @ xmath324 we wish to compute @ xmath325 . now , although the equations of need to be write as @ xmath2dependent upon a choice of gauge to first order in @ xmath2 ( see figure [ 1 : 1 ] ) , they can not depend upon a choice of gauge to first order in @ xmath2 , since a second order gauge transformation does not affect the magnetic dipole moment of the n - particle @ xmath326 . ( we have already verified by a direct , explicit proof that second order gauge transformations do not affect changes in the equations of gauge to first order in @ xmath2 . ) therefore , we are free to impose an ( admissible ) second order gauge transformation on @ xmath322 . it will be natural to require that the einstein gauge condition @ xmath327 be applied to the @ xmath328 . the @ xmath329 part of the linearized einstein equation combined with the @ xmath330 part of the einstein gauge condition then yields @ xmath331 where @ xmath332 . this system of equations for @ xmath333 is the same system of equations as those satisfied by the solution of the flat spacetime linearized einstein equation ( although our @ xmath334 solutions depend upon time ) . the general solutionof these equations , @ xmath335 , @ xmath336 , and @ xmath337 , where @ xmath33 is antisymmetric , @ xmath338 , where @ xmath232 , @ xmath33 , and @ xmath339 have no spatial dependence , and where @ xmath340 was defined in 1984 . ( [ 2 ] ) . using a simple second order gauge theory ( of the form @ xmath341 ) , we can obtain @ xmath342 . we thus obtain @ xmath343 which is of the same form as the general ##ised @ xmath270 theory of the spacetime ( see , e . g . , @ xcite ) , except that spatial dependence is absent for @ xmath33 and @ xmath339 . as we shall see here , @ xmath33 and @ xmath339 correspond , respectively , to the moment and the inverse moment of the metric . we therefore can write for the metric tensor @ xmath344 , @ xmath345 where we have written the metric tensor @ xmath143 and@ xmath346 , and @ xmath347 is the antisymmetric vector whose space components vanish @ xmath33 and whose time components vanish , i . e . , @ xmath348 we now follow the procedure described by the [ sec : metric ] . we choose a _ t _ n vectors of the point , @ xmath349 and then @ xmath286 so as to make the l - function of @ xmath350 vanish for all @ xmath37 . a simple application of the linear transformation ( [ eq : transform2 ] ) to the metric ( [ sec : metric2 ] ) : @ xmath351 n ^ j \ h _ { \ alpha \ beta } + \ frac { 1 } { \ hat { r } ^ 2 } h _ { ( \ alpha } s _ { \ alpha ) } } ( \ hat { r } ) n ^ j \ \ & \ qquad \ alpha + \ frac { 1 } { \ hat { r } } h _ { \ alpha \ beta } ( \ hat { t } , \ alpha , \ theta ) + h _ { \ alpha \ beta } ( \( { 1 } , \ alpha , \ phi ) + ( ( 1 ) \ biggr ) + o ( \ lambda ^ 2 ) , \ hat { r } \ ] ] where we have ` ` ' ' ' the result of the fourier transformation of s @ xmath352 and @ xmath353 into the # ##s @ xmath354 . the following ` ` ' fourier transformation ' ' ( from ref .

( [ et : metric2 ] ) to the near zone expansion e . ( [ et : scaled - metric ] ) should be noted . for example , the first term @ xmath36##8 originated as a second order perturbation in the far zone , but it now appears as part of the background scaled metric in the near zone expansion . in contrast , the expression @ xmath369 originated as part of the background metric in the far zone , but it now appears as a second order metric in the near zone expansion . it is easy to see from eq . ( [ ap : scaled - metric ] ) that @ xmath370 is the mass dipole moment of @ xmath371 at all @ xmath37 . we can solve @ xmath372 for all @ xmath174 . consequently , the mass dipole moment will appear in our section below . although we have ` ` solved ' ' for @ xmath281 in eq . ( [ ap ] ) , we have not found anything new about the motion . [ equivalent to simply determining the mass dipole moment @ xmath373 in the polar coordinates . the rest of this section may therefore be recast by simply solving enough of the second - order perturbation ##s for the mass dipole moment and hence the motion to be determined . ] [ the information about @ xmath281 willcome from observing that the components @ xmath42or , equivalently , @ xmath61be solutions of einstein s equation . we can solve einstein s equation perturbatively either via the far zone expansion or the near zone expansion . the two sets of equations are entirely similar , but the components are organized quite differently . we find it more convenient to work with the near zone expansion , and will do so below . we note , however , that we could very well have used the far zone perturbation ##s . we also note that no new information that can be generated by combining the near and far zone expansion , since these expansions have already been ` ` ` matched ' ' via etc . ( [ eq : rseries ] ) , ( [ bnmp ] ) , and ( [ eq : fullnearzone ] ) . in the meantime , in order to make the notation less cumbersome , we will put the ` ` hat ' ' on the near - zone expansion @ xmath374 and on the component @ xmath375 . no confusion should arise from this , since we do not have occassion to match the exact spatial coordinates @ xmath58 ##5 . on the other hand, we will write the ` ` hat ' ' on the line @ xmath356 , since we now have occassion to use both @ xmath356 and @ xmath51 ##6 . using this formula and setting the wave - energy to zero , e .

( [ 1 : 1 - metric2 ] ) , namely @ xmath379 it is clear that the definition of the@ xmath271 and @ xmath380 in @ xmath381 can also contribute to the linearized ricci tensor to order @ xmath377 . however , it is clear that the tensor of order @ xmath271 and higher in the background scaled metric can not contribute to the background ricci tensor to order @ xmath377 , so , to order @ xmath377 , we say that @ xmath382 is the linearized metric tensor in the schwarzschild metric . it is therefore possible to define @ xmath382 in tensor spherical coordinates . we obtain a more useful piece of information by considering the @ xmath383 , magnetic moment part of the background ricci tensor that is invariant under time reversal . on account of the nature of the background schwarzschild metric , only the @ xmath383 , magnetic moment , even under time reversal part of the background perturbation can exist . therefore , , given @ xmath383 , symmetric ( but not necessarily trace ##less ) trace ##s @ xmath384 can be defined in tensor spherical coordinates as ( , , ) .e . , @ xcite = @ xcite ( ( a16 - 18 ) ) @ xmath385 where the expansion coefficients @ xmath386 are functions of @ xmath387 . the s - labeling index of these coefficients corresponds to the two ` ` ` @ xmath149 - values ' ' for each @ xmath383 tensor . thus , we know that there are a finite total of eight types of @ xmath383 tensor with coordinates . the three types associated with labeling indices @ xmath388 are of electric properties , whereas the three harmonics associated with @ xmath389 are of magnetic properties . for the metric tensor ( [ 1 : 1 - 2 ] ) the ` ` constant ##s ' ' @ xmath365 and @ xmath390 have purely electric properties and can not contribute . it turns out that @ xmath391 also can not contribute to the @ xmath383 , a phase tensor of the linearized ricci tensor that is invariant under partial derivatives : since @ xmath392 is independent of @ xmath156 the ` ` @ xmath32 '' part of @ xmath392 is even under time reversal , whereas the ` ` @ xmath145 ' ' part of @ xmath391 is the spin . therefore , the spin term that belongs to the @ xmath377 to the @ xmath383 , magnetic tensor part of of the magnetic ricci tensor that is even under time reversal is @ xmath393 . satisfaction of vacuum - einstein equations at infinity @ xmath377 requires that this condition satisfy . we thereby learn that @ xmath394 i . e . , to lowest order , the tensor is parallelly invariant with respect to the gauge field along the worldline @ xmath8 . having set the spin term to zero in eq . ( [ q : scaled - 1 ] ) , we can now substitute the spin terms in q . ( [ eq : scaled - 2 ] ) into the vacuum einstein equation and set the @ xmath377 term back to zero . it is clear that we can now obtain relations for @ xmath395 , @ xmath359 , and @ xmath396 . however , these relations may not be ofof course for obtaining ` ` equations of motion ' ' i . e . , equations relating @ xmath281 and its partial derivatives to other quantities because the quantity of order @ xmath397 also exists in connection with the quantity @ xmath398 , which is equivalent to the above . therefore , we shall not only consider the relations obtained from the standard einstein equation here . we shall consider the relation about @ xmath281 that can be obtained from the near - second - order einstein equation @ xmath399 = - x ^ { ( 2 ) } _ { g } [ \ bar { g } ^ { ( 2 ) } , \ bar { g } ^ { ( 2 ) } ] , \ ] ] where , from eq . ( [ 1 : 1 - metric2 ] ) , we have that @ xmath400 where we have . @ xmath401 we wish to extend the second order einstein equation to define @ xmath271 and @ xmath380 , which , as we shall see below , are the two nontrivial derivatives of @ xmath268 as @ xmath378 that follows . first , we define @ xmath40##2 $ ] . the terms appearing in this quantity may be organized into one of the following general forms ( i ) @ xmath403 ; ( ii ) @ xmath404 ; ( iii ) @ xmath405 where @ xmath406 is the christoffel symbol of the above general form ; ( iv ) @ xmath407 ; and ( v ) @ xmath408 . from the form of @ xmath409 combined with the fact that @ xmath410 and @ xmath411 , it is clear that each of these terms will correspond to @ xmath412 $ ] to either @ xmath271 or @ xmath380 . thus , we can consider @ xmath413 as satisfying the homogeneous , homogeneous , einstein equation . we can consider the linearized ricci flow of the form @ xmath413 . on inspection of q . ( [ 1 : 1 - 3 ] ) , it would appear that terms that are @ xmath184 ( from two partial derivatives depending on the ` ` b ' ' term ) and @ xmath414 ( from three derivatives ) all agree .however , it is easy enough to show that the total contribution to the @ xmath184 and @ xmath414 equations will be by virtue of the fact that the metric @ xmath171 is a solution to the s equation and the area proportional to @ xmath2 in s . ( [ eq : metric2 ] ) is the zero point of the equation ( which has already been proved ) . it also becomes clear that there is a contribution of @ xmath413 to the corresponding ricci tensor that is of order @ xmath415 . thus , the two nontrivial solutions that arise in the first order s equation are : @ xmath271 and @ xmath380 , as claimed above . the computation of the corresponding ricci tensor to solve @ xmath271 and @ xmath380 for the corresponding perturbation @ xmath413 is quite complicated , but we can save some time by working on the relevant solutions of the linearized einstein equation to these equations . our hope / expectation ( which will be borne out by our calculations ) is to obtain an equation for @ xmath416 . since this equation is of@ xmath383 , electric - type and is even under time reversal , we shall rely on the @ xmath383 , electric type , even under time reversal part of the linearized ricci tensor of @ xmath413 at both @ xmath271 and @ xmath380 . from fig . ( [ eq : 2 ] ) , we see that the @ xmath383 , parity part of the ricci tensor that is @ xmath417 and even under time reversal can be written as @ xmath418 whereas the @ xmath383 part of the ricci tensor that is @ xmath419 and even under time reversal can be written as @ xmath420 . , in contrast to the terms of , @ xmath421 are ` ` constants ' ' , i . e , they have no dependence on @ xmath422 . we shall consider the terms of @ xmath413 that can refer to these ricci tensor . the term @ xmath423 has an @ xmath424 part . however , the @ xmath425 electric type part of this termcan , in fact , combine with the @ xmath383 curvature term ` ` spin term ' ' @ xmath426 in the background scaled metric to give a solution to the modified ricci tensor of the correct type . this contribution will be convergence to @ xmath427 for the remaining terms in @ xmath413 , the ` ` spin term ' ' @ xmath426 in the background scaled metric can also contribute to the reversal parts of the linearized ricci tensor , so we can treat the remaining terms in @ xmath413 as if they were part of schwarzschild . however , for the @ xmath383 , under consideration , convergence to the reversal part of these terms can occur . the corresponding solutions to @ xmath428 , and @ xmath429 are @ xmath430 and @ xmath431 where , by definition . ( [ d ] ) , we have @ xmath432 ( the curvature term @ xmath300 has not appeared in the above equations because it has no @ xmath383 solution . ) the @ xmath433 are also constants " inthese expressions . a simple calculation now yields @ xmath434 using the vacuum linearized differential equation @ xmath435 , we thus have 6 differential equations for our 11 unknowns . however , in order to find ` ` universial ' ' ' , we are interested in relations that do not involve @ xmath436 and @ xmath437 . it can be seen that there are two important relations in near - zone perturbation theory the product of the mass , time derivative , and second time derivative of the mass dipole is time @ xmath37 . the second condition should follow from the first - order near - zone differential equation , which we did not fully understand . in fact , it should only be necessary to note that the mass must have a second time derivative in order to describe the motion . ] , for @ xmath438 and @ xmath439 the first equation involves @ xmath440 and spatial derivative of @ xmath281 , and does not give information on the motion . therefore , the second equation involves the equations of motion . as per the form of the equations shown in fig . ( [ motion ] ) , we get @ xmath44##1 where we have taken advantage of the fact ( mentioned above ) that for @ xmath442 and @ xmath443 components we have @ xmath444 . using the addition of the terms @ xmath445 , we have @ xmath446 thus , according to the formula given in the [ sec : dipole ] above , the first possible perturbative solution , @ xmath447 , to the metric @ xmath8 of the metric spacetime is @ xmath448 in fact , we have previously shown that @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 are tangent to @ xmath8 . on account of the fact that this equation is written in # ##onic instead of @ xmath8 and that @ xmath253 , we can write this equation in a slightly non - equivalent form as @ xmath449 where @ xmath7 is the tangent to @ xmath8 and @ xmath450 . however , it should be emphasized that this equation describes the perturbed solution only when the metric space is in the lorenz gauge ( see figure a ) .the first term in fig . ( [ eq : eom ] ) ( or , equivalently , in fig . ( [ eq : eomcov ] ) ) is the ` ` gravitational force ' ' first proposed by papapetrou @ xcite . contributions from spin multipole moments do not appear in our model because they go to zero faster than the spin dipole moment , and so would be of first order for @ xmath2 in our perturbation scheme . the second term corresponds to the background side of the geodesic deviation equation , and arises because the perturbed worldline is not ( except at certain points ) coincident with the background worldline . in the equation @ xmath451 , the body simply moves on a set of points of the same metric parameterized by @ xmath2 , and the perturbative equation of motion should therefore be the ` deviation equation . ] . the final term is the ` ` ' g - force ' ' , which is assumed to take the form of a ( fictitious ) gravitational force from the background g - frame . our model has thus provided a rigorous proof of the approximation schemes that have been proposed since . finally , we havethat , although our analysis has many points of agreement with other analyses of matched asymptotic expansions , there are a number of significant differences . we have already noted in section [ sec : geodesic ] that our estimate of the metric at first order in @ xmath2 appears to differ from some other approaches @ xcite , which do not seem to satisfy the requirement that @ xmath241 . we also have already noted that in other approaches to g - force @ xcite , what happens to our scaled metric at @ xmath38 ##1 _ _ _ to be of schwarzschild form . in these other approaches , first order solutions of the near zone expansion are treated as partial derivatives , and are assumed to be regular on the schwarzschild scale . in contrast we make no assumptions about the time - dependence of the perturbations of the scaled metric beyond those that follow from our fundamental assumptions ( i ) - ( ii ) of section [ sec : elastic ] . however , our first order perturbations are allowed to have time dependence on @ xmath156 , and our second order perturbations can depend quadratically on @ xmath156 . wewe make no assumptions about the spacetime of @ xmath165 and therefore impose no boundary conditions at @ @ xmath72 . however , there is a significant difference in the way in which the boundary conditions used to define the metric are applied . in @ xcite , the entire @ xmath424 electric field part of what corresponds to our first order near zone metric is set to zero without proper justification electric field part that is relevant for the equations of motion . @ xcite is of ` ` acceleration type ' ' ( with exponential growth at @ xmath72 ) and does not have an exact interpretation in terms of a change in the center of mass . ] . by contrast , our ` ` no mass dipole ' ' condition applies to the _ background _ near - zone metric and has been justified by providing ` ` center of mass ' ' condition . as is mentioned near the end of section [ 1 : dipole ] , the vector @ xmath29 ##5 fig . is the ` ` deviation vector ' ' based on the background vector @ xmath8 that describes the first order ' @ xmath2 perturbation to the metric . for any one parameter family of space##times @ xmath42 satisfying the condition given in section [ sec : example ] , eq . is also guaranteed to give a good approximation to the deviation from the values of time @ xmath8 and @ xmath35 . in other words , if @ xmath8 is chosen as @ xmath250 , then the new worldline metric given by @ xmath452 is the correct description of motion to first order in @ xmath2 ( when the metric tensor is in the background ) and is therefore guaranteed to be accurate to time @ xmath2 . however , this guarantee is of the form that if one wants to describe the motion accurately up to time @ xmath174 , then it always will be possible to choose @ xmath2 sufficiently small that @ xmath452 gives a good approximation up to time @ xmath174 . the guarantee is _ _ _ of the form that if @ xmath2 is chosen to be sufficiently small , then @ xmath452 will accurately describe the motion for all time . however , for all time @ xmath453 , it is to be expected that @ xmath447 willis large at very late times , and it is clear that the mathematical equations of motion @ xmath452 can not be said to be accurate when @ xmath447 is large , since by the way the motion has deviated significantly from the original original geodesic @ xmath8 , the motion itself can not be accurately described within the framework of applying a ` ` partial correction ' ' to @ xmath8 . however , the main intended purpose of the first order corrected equations of motion is to compute motion in situations , such as inspiral , where the deviations from the original geodesic have become large at late times . it is also clear that etc . , as it stands , is useless for computing long term effects , such as inspiral . one possible response to the theoretical difficulty would be to go to higher order in perturbation theory . however , it seems clear that this will not help . although the equations of motion obtained from @ xmath454th order perturbation theory will be more accurate than the first order equations , they will not have a degree of validity that is significantly larger than the first order equations . the perturbative equations of the higher order will tend to model the motion as a` ` small deviation ' ' from @ xmath8 , and should not be used to describe motion even when the deviations are , in fact , large . in essence , given the fact that the deviation from @ xmath8 has become sufficiently large to invalidate first order perturbation theory in that , e . g . , the second order corrections are comparable in time to the first order , then one would expect that the @ xmath455th order corrections will also be comparable to the @ xmath454th order corrections , but @ xmath454th order perturbation theory will not be accurate either . only by going to all orders in the theory can one expect to get an accurate , global - scale , description of motion via perturbation theory . of course , if one goes to all orders in perturbation theory , then there is no point in having done the math at all . however , for a sufficiently massive object of suffciently small mass , it seems clear that the corrections to geodesic motion should be _ _ _ , and should be locally determined by . . . by the time these local corrections have built up and the motion has changed sufficiently from the original .approximating the motion , it should then be connected to the _ vector , one solution of which should give a better approximation to the motion for that portion of space . one could then expect to ` ` add together ' ' these solutions to produce a world - line that better describes the motion of the particle for a longer time . in the limit of many such solutions with small distances between them , one expects the resulting worldline to be described by a single ` ` self - consistent ' ' differential equation , which should then re - describe the motion as long as it is _ _ _ connected to geodesic points . a simple , general example can help illustrate some of the above points . consider the cooling of a ` ` black body ' ' . to find a definite problem that can be put in a framework similar to that considered in this article , let us consider a particle ( such as a lump of black coal ) that is put in a wall with perfect reflecting surfaces , but a hole of size @ xmath456 is left in the this wall . we are interested in determining how the energy , @ xmath457 , of the body changes with time . at finite @ xmath456 , this is a very difficult problem , sincethe body will not remain in the thermal equilibrium as it radiates out of the hole . now , let us consider a one - parameter family of cavities where @ xmath458 smoothly goes to zero as @ xmath35 . when @ xmath82 , we find that the energy , @ xmath459 , will not change with time , and the body will remain in thermal equilibrium at exactly @ xmath460 for all times . when we apply first order perturbation ##s in @ xmath2 , we will find that the first order contribution @ xmath2 , , @ xmath461 , to the energy , becomes small compared to the typical wavelengths of the light ( as it is as we use @ xmath462 ) , we enter a quantum uncertainty regime where our assumptions are no longer valid . we ignore such effects here , just as in our original analysis of the motion of bodies in general relativity we ignored quantum gravity , even though they should be ignored when the mass of the body is smaller than the planck scale . ] @ xmath463 where @ xmath464 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @ xmath465 . notethat is the highest possible temperature , @ xmath460 , enters the positive side of this equation because the quantity @ xmath466 is already first order in @ xmath2 , so the effect of any changes in temperature would appear only to higher order in @ xmath2 . since @ xmath460 is a constant , it is possible to extend eq . ( [ de ] ) to give , @ xmath467 thus , first order quantum theory approximates the behavior of @ xmath468 as @ xmath469 although this is a good approximation at early times , it is a horrible approximation at late times , as it predicts that the temperature will go down . if one went to second order quantum perturbation theory , one would make corrections to eq . ( [ de ] ) that would take into account the first order energy loss as well as the non - equilibrium conditions . however , one would still be running out of the non - equilibrium limit , and the late time approximation using second ( or any finite second order ) perturbation theory would still be very poor . however , there is an important mathematical result that can be obtained by assuming that if @ xmat##h456 is sufficiently small , then the body should remain continuously in thermal equilibrium as it loses energy . therefore , although perturbation theory off of the first order solution may give poor results at late times , first order perturbation theory off of _ the _ thermal equilibrium solution should give locally good results at all times . this suggests that if @ xmath456 is sufficiently small , the cooling of the body should be described by @ xmath470 when combined with the formula , @ xmath471 , that relates energy to heat when the body is in thermal equilibrium , this equation should give an excellent description of the cooling of the body that is valid at all times . in addition , # . ( [ denew ] ) takes into account the first order perturbative effects ( to all orders in @ xmath2 ) associated with the cooling of the body , but also neglects various perturbative effects associated with the body continuing to remain in thermal equilibrium as it cools . # ( [ denew ] ) is _ not _ an _ equation ( since it does not take various thermal - related effects into account ) and it is _ not _ an equation that follows directly from perturbation theory . however , itfrom an equation that belongs to a first order perturbation theory to a system that itself undergoes changes resulting from the theory . we can refer to such an equation as a ` ` self - consistent perturbative equation ' ' . such equations are usually written as for systems that can be solved _ locally in time _ within a small amount from a simple approximation . how does one obtain a ` ` self - consistent perturbative equation ' ' for a given system for which one has solved first order perturbative equations ? we do not know that there is a general method for deriving a self - consistent perturbative equation . however , the following appear to be appropriate criteria to impose on a self - consistent perturbative equation : ( 1 ) it should have a well defined initial value formulation . ( 2 ) it should have the same number of degrees of freedom as the first order perturbative system , so that a correspondence can be established between initial data for the self - consistent perturbative equation and the first order perturbative system . ( 3 ) for corresponding initial data , the solutions to the self - consistent perturbative system should be identical to the initial values of the first order perturbative systemis the smallest interval for which the first order perturbative description should be valid . we do not know of any reason why , for a given metric , there need be a self - consistent perturbative equation satisfying these criteria . in cases where a self - consistent perturbative equation satisfying these criteria does exist , we would not expect it to be valid . for example , we could obtain e . ( [ denew ] ) by adding suitable terms proportional to @ xmath472 to the right side of this equation . the first order perturbative equations for the metric of a small body show that the first order in which is @ xmath473 where @ xmath116 corresponds to the metric , @ xmath8 of the background spacetime , and @ xmath7 is the tangent to @ xmath8 . if we have the exact solution to this equation ( which does satisfy the lorenz gauge condition ) , we have proven already in this case that the first order in @ xmath2 deviation of the metric from @ xmath8 satisfies @ xmath474 with @ xmath475 where , for ., we have dropped the second term . the misataquwa equations @ xmath476 @ xmath477 @ xmath20 ( where one has the exact solution to eq . ( [ misa2 ] ) ) are an excellent approximation for self - consistent perturbative solutions ( to the following first order perturbative equations ) , since in the self - consistent perturbative case , the distance from the self - consistent worldline should be . ] . however , @ xmath478 ( where in the background metric ) corresponds to the self - consistent solution @ xmath479 , rather than to a simple geodesic as above . although a proper numerical analysis of this integro - differential equation has not been carried out , it is plausible that our general criteria ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) will be satisfied by the misataquwa equations . if so , they should be a good , large - scale , equation of motion for problems like self - motion inspiral . we want to thank daniel cohen and eric poisson for these results . this project was funded in part by nsf grant phy04 - 56619 to the university of chicago and a nationalthesis , in research , to mit . as stated in section [ sec : calculation ] , the description of motion will change under first - order transformations of gauge . however , in that section , we noted that under a smooth gauge transformation , the description of motion changes at 0 . ( [ smoothgauge ] ) . however , as previously noted near the end of section [ sec : calculation ] , ( see equation ) , the allowed coordinate system includes transformations that are not smooth in @ xmath50 . since such transformations may arise in a deformation of a gauge @ xcite , and therefore do not satisfy our assumptions . ] , we provide here the basis for the first order perturbative equation of motion in an arbitrary gauge transformation by our assumptions . we then provide the corresponding self - consistent perturbative equation of motion . as previously noted in section [ sec : calculation ] ( see the remark in eq . ( [ jh ] ) ) , the equations of motion to second order gauge @ xmath2 depend only upon the first order gauge transformation @ xmath480 . as we have shown , the mass dipole moment appears at second - order in ( see ##aday ) gauge transformations , so we can consider the secondof first - order gauge transformations on second - order perturbations . this is given by @ xmath481 , with @ xmath482 where @ xmath483 denotes the lie algebra . equivalently , we have @ xmath484 where @ xmath191 denotes the differential operator associated with the action of @ xmath171 . in order to satisfy the condition on the gauge transformations ( see below ) , the components of @ xmath480 must be of the form @ xmath485 i . e . , @ xmath480 can ` ` ` blow up ' ' at @ xmath50 ##5 it can be singular in the sense that its components all have time - dependent moments . the half - moment , @ xmath373 , is one - third of the moment of the @ xmath383 part of the leading component , @ xmath310 , part of the second order metric perturbation , @ xmath486 . similarly , @ xmath373 may be obtained from the product , @ xmath487 where m is the scale parameter on the manifold of interest @ xmath488 . under thegauge transformation generated by @ xmath480 , we have @ xmath489 as previously stated , for an arbitrary first - order equation satisfying our assumptions , we have @ xmath490 where @ xmath32 is the mass of the body . from fig . ( [ xiform ] ) , ( [ dg200 ] ) and ( [ g100 ] ) , we see that the change in @ xmath486 induced by our gauge transformation is @ xmath491 and , from fig . ( [ 1 : app - dip ] ) , the corresponding change in the x - moment is @ xmath492 where @ xmath493 is the area element of the unit sphere . writing ( [ 1 ] ) , the change in the mass dipole moment induced by the possibly non - smooth gauge transformation generated by @ xmath480 . the corresponding change in the first order perturbative equation of motion is given by the change in the _ smooth _ vector field @ xmath494 required to generate the mass dipole . writing @ xmath495 , this change is given by @ xmath496 ( see figure . ). therefore , the term @ xmath497 appearing in the state vector of the perturbed worldline is @ xmath498 with @ xmath499 given by . . . in the case where our original gauge was the null gauge , it follows immediately from fig . ( [ e : eom ] ) that the new equation of motion for @ xmath500 is @ xmath501 where @ xmath502 is given by eq . ( [ e : 1 - 1 ] ) , and where , for simplicity , we have dropped the null term . we now write eq . ( [ eq : eom - app2 ] ) for @ xmath503 so that although eq . ( [ e : eom - app6 ] ) provides us with the new equation of motion in an arbitrary allowed gauge , the equation of evolution of @ xmath504 must still be valid in the new gauge . now suppose one wishes to move to a self - consistent perturbative theory consistent with the new choice of gauge . it is not clear how one might expect to write the evolution equation for the # ##s of the new gauge .( another approach would be to first use ex . ( [ misa2 ] ) and then update the result by the use of @ xmath505 . it would be impossible to find a new solution based on a single ` ` correct ' ' solution of the standard einstein equation for the new solution . ) however , it seems that the natural choice of self - consistent perturbative equation associated to ex . ( [ e : eom - app6 ] ) would be @ xmath506 in the case where @ xmath480 is used ( note that , for ex . ( [ e : power - 1 ] ) , we have @ xmath507 ) this agrees with the proposal of barack and ori @ xcite . wald 1984 _ general relativity _ ( chicago , il : university of chicago press ) j . geroch and j . traschen , _ phys . rev . d _ * 36 * , 1017 ( 1987 ) m . weinberg 1972 _ gravitation and gravity _ ( new york : wiley ) w . anderson , _ nuovo cim . d _ * 36 * , ( 1966 ) m . mino , t . sasaki, and t . tanaka , _ phys . _ , * 55 * , 3457 - 3476 , ( 1997 ) d . j . quinn and j . j . wald , _ phys . _ _ , * 55 * , 3381 - 3394 , ( 1997 ) r . detweiler and r . e . smith , _ phys . * 55 * , 024025 , ( 2003 ) a . poisson , _ ann . rel . _ * 9 * , ( 2004 ) r . j . dewitt and j . j . brehme , _ ann . _ , * 27 * , 220 - 259 , ( 1960 ) r . e . b . smith , _ proc . lond . _ _ * 167 * 148 ( 1938 ) r . j . smith , _ j . math .
