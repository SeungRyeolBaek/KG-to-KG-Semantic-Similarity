the investigation of @ xmath1 - transition systems is in many ways limited by the structural disorder in these films . in particular , the ladder - shaped poly - p - phenylenes ( lppp ) @ xcite offer the opportunity to study simple , ladder - shaped structures of planarised phenylene units . as a result , the @ xmath1 - transition might spread out over an entire polymer and a vibronic resolution of the @ xmath2 transition is discernible @ xcite . in order to study the characteristics of the polymer of @ xcite , like the effective conjugation energy , several oligomers have been synthesized in the past to study the low - lying electronic excited states of the polymer @ xcite . absorption in lppp and @ xcite has been described as a function of the intensity of the exciting light , Î± . the typical absorption peak of the photocurrent occurs between the absorption edge and the absorption rise at high energies and up in this case to 0 . 6 nm . this behavior of the photocurrent which does not follow directly the absorption edge is sometimes called ` ` ~ ' ' . one possible explanation for this phenomenon rests on the observationof the possible excited states for the individual molecules . excited states of @ xmath1 - like molecules are usually described by their bound electron - hole pairs . this general picture originates from solid - state studies of ( si ) semi - conductors . consequently , these excited states are often referred to as excitons , although they have to be further distinguished from the extended band states in the crystal . a rough estimate of the exciton free energy of these polymers has been obtained , e . g . , by scanning tunneling spectroscopy of @ xcite which have led to a value of 1 @ xmath3 + . excited states with a higher value , and the electron - hole pairs , therefore , should be less susceptible to the separation via an external electric field . following this idea , the conjecture has been put forward that such a state is responsible for the steep ##ening of the photocurrent in poly - phenylene - vinylene ( ppv ) @ xcite . later on , another explanation has emerged based on the excess photon energy which is due to the electron withdrawing of @ xcite . the latter proposal is not widely accepted . in order to apply these concepts for excited states of @ xmath1 - conju##gated polymers , several oligomers of the lppp type with up to eleven phenylene rings are used in this phase . the use of oligomers instead of an ( ordinary ) polymer follows the above general principles and allows the direct comparison with molecules . the main limitation to the experiments in these phases is the restriction to linear chains in the film . as the commonly used molecules are far too large one has to eliminate the two linear substituents assigned to lppp by hydrogen ( see table [ fig : 1 ] and table [ tab : 0 ] ) . this should have only minor effects on the optical properties , which are governed by the molecular orbitals of @ xmath1 - symmetry . these linear substituents are only necessary for the structural stability of the polymer , or to prohibit the formation of bonds in the film ( @ xmath4 = methyl , see [ fig : 1 ] ) . since the systems studied cannot reach the size of the effective conjugation length required for lppp ( > 14 phenylene rings @ xcite ) , ab - initio and density control methods are not applicable , and one has to assent to the expensive semiempiricalmethods ( am1 , indo / s ; see below ) . thus , the wave functions of the two excited states are the indo ( with change of orbital ##s ) slater determinants @ xmath5 @ xcite . for the excited states @ xmath6 ( the equation [ phicisdef ] ) , the indo / s approach is used in the spin - orbit model . the excited states with high orbital energy will be denoted as @ xmath7 for the first excited state , @ xmath8 for the intermediate excited states and @ xmath9 for the low energy , ` ` frenkel - type ' ' state . the electronic excited state will be denoted as @ xmath10 , the semiempirical approach is briefly described . in sect . [ geometryspectra ] , the results for the structural analysis of the oligomers and their spectra are presented . the main chapter of this article , sect . [ physics ] , focuses on the development of a general interpretation scheme for excited - state wave functions . its application to indo / s wave functions leads in a straightforward way to the interpretation of the excited states as bound electron - hole pairs . a short introduction concludes the chapter . although it isalthough feasible to calculate the higher oligomers by first - principle calculations , the oligomer with two phenylene rings ( @ xmath11 ) has been calculated at mp2 / 30 - 31 * * * @ xcite ( mller - plesset pertubation theory of first order ) . the results are used as a basis for the other methods . in the example of brdas _ et al . _ @ xcite , one has to choose a particular method which yields the geometric structure . in the first case the austin semiempirical parametrization ( am1 ) @ xcite has an almost exact match with the mp2 results ( cf . @ xmath12 for the phase diagram in figure [ tab : 1 ] ) . this method can therefore be used to determine the geometric structure of the ground state . note , however , that the pm3 method @ xcite gives better results for zero - energy vibrational energies ( zpe ) . the am1 and mp2 calculations have been carried out on an ibm / sp2 computer using the gaussian94 ( g . d4 ) @ xcite program package . the minima are represented by elements of the hess##ian ##d , whereby the zero - point energies ( zpe ) have been calculated , etc . the results will be left unscaled throughout the program . in the first step , excited singlet states are calculated using zerner - indo / s calculations @ xcite based on the minimum am1 deviation from the corresponding ground state . thus it is clear that geometric relaxation ##s in the excited states are possible . the active orbital space consists of the 22 highest occupied and the 22 lowest occupied molecular orbitals . this is the biggest orbital space possible within the ci program , and it contains orbitals of @ xmath13 symmetry for the oligomers as well . as such , the corresponding excited state functions of the wave function describe @ xmath1 @ xmath14 symmetry . the calculation of the spectra has been performed on a pentiumiii computer using the program package cache 3 . 1 @ xcite . in order to give a more realistic representation of the spectral line spectra , gaussian distributions are least - square related to the indo / s oscillator strengths . this method produces transitions with high oscillator strengths which are close in energy to a phase transition . this is especially the case for the high - energy region of thespectrum , in which strong @ xmath15 transitions cover others . the hidden states are not visible in the full spectrum , and consist of a number of important configurations sensitive to the size of the active ci ##p ( figure [ fig : 2 ] ) . the hidden part of the spectra comprises only features with one transition , except in rare cases , where two nearly identical states are bound together . in these cases only one transition will be visible ( the @ xmath2 transition for the @ xmath11 oligomer and the @ xmath16 transition for the rest ; see discussion below ) . the spectra have been determined without any physical constraints . therefore , the geometries only correspond to two point groups within crystallographic accuracy ( @ xmath17 0 . 001 , @ xmath18 ) . the two point groups are equivalent to those suggested by the original amino - acid structure , see figure [ fig : 2 ] . oligomers with an even number of phenylene atoms adopt @ xmath19 symmetry . those with an odd number adopt @ xmath20 symmetry . the double - bond lengths are between about 1 . 380 and about 1 . 450 . figure [ fig : 2 . 5 ] . the mp##2 result for the @ xmath21 oligomer is an example . since the average c - c bond in a methylene bridge is 1 . 503 a , they are bound to hydrogen bonds . as a result , the hydrogen atoms of the methylene bridge do not participate in the conjugated state , although this would be allowed . this supports the idea of neglecting the other substituents . in figure [ 1 : 2 ] the ( vibronically unresolved ) energy spectra of lppp oligomers are plotted . the comparison with measured energy spectra of different oligomers @ xcite shows qualitative differences , i . e . , they exhibit a typical @ xmath2 transition which is shifted to lower energies with increasing system temperature . as one would expect for the @ xmath7 state , the homo lumo excitation is the dominant one . homo ( lumo ) refers to the lowest energy ( lowest unoccupied ) molecular orbital in the indo ground state . a second interesting feature can be seen in the figure for the oligomers with five and more electrons . this will be referred to as the @ xmath22 state , because it is energetically in the transition between the @xmath7 state and the low energy region . in the @ xmath8 state the dominant determinants are derived from the substitution of the homo by the lumo + 1 and the substitution of the homo @ xmath231 by the lumo + 1 . the energy of the @ xmath16 state also shifts to higher energies with increasing oligomer number . this is not discernible in the experimental spectra because of the low corresponding field strength . however , both sets of spectra show a steep transition at approximately 5 . 40 ev which is followed by a transition at approximately 5 . 85 ev for the oligomer . this transition can be called the @ xmath15 transition , while the @ xmath9 state shows a high degree of localization ( i . e . , a ` ` frenkel ' ' state ) , which will become clear later in the discussion . the @ xmath9 state is characterized by three different state transitions , where low - energy occupied molecular orbitals are exchanged for orbitals with higher energy . in figure [ 2 : 3a ] the energy of the three most excited states is drawn as a function of the total number of phenylene atoms in the molecule . thetransitions of the @ xmath7 and the @ xmath8 states show a strong linear dependence , whereas the energy of the @ xmath15 states only changes with system temperature , in agreement with the experimental data . despite this experimental observation , a direct comparison with the experimental data for the electron capture reaction @ xcite is not possible , since the energy curve tends to an unphysical negative value . the main reason for this failure is the neglect of the kinetic equation in the calculations which stabilizes the excited states in the later phases of the experiments . moreover , the linear dependence for the transitions to the @ xmath8 and the @ xmath7 states suggest a crossing of the two energies which must not be taken for granted at this stage . from the magnetic dipole transition of @ xmath24 for the @ xmath2 states , one obtains an expression for the radiative potential lifetimes @ xmath25 for the oligomer , using [ 1 ] @ xmath26 energy , @ xmath27 is the electron charge , @ xmath28 is the wave function of the _ i _ - 1 unit of the @ xmath29 , @ xmath##30 is planck - constant , @ xmath31 is the speed of light , and @ xmath32 is the wavelength of the photon , and are measured in si units . the lifetimes @ xmath25 have a linear dependence on the reciprocal length of phenylene rings , see figure [ tab : 3b ] . however , the value of several hundred picoseconds for the large oligomers is in quantitative agreement with the experimental value of about 300 ps for the polymer , obtained from an organic matrix @ xcite . under the assumption of a linear dependence of @ xmath25 and the value of the oligomer length , one sees from the expression in figure [ tab : 1 ] that a value of @ xmath33 corresponds to the reciprocal conjugation constant of the large phenylene rings , in quantitative agreement with the value of 300 ps obtained from other experimental methods @ xcite . for an example the wave functions for the ground state and the excited states need to be related to experimentally observable values . the excited power at time @ xmath34 is proportional to the real part of the absorbed power , as given by the kubo formula @ xcite @ xmath35 = \frac { { \ rm im \ , } \ left [ \ sum _ { jj } ( \ omega > 0 ) \ ; ] } { \ omega } \ ; , \ hat { 0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath36 is the transfer operator transfer operator , @ xmath37 is , @ xmath38 is the # ##ian of the operator , @ xmath39 is the eigenstates with , @ xmath40 ( @ xmath41 ) , @ xmath42 , and @ xmath43 is the inverse . thus , the second part of the transfer equation can be written as @ xmath44 = \ frac { \ omega } { \ omega } \ ; \ sum _ { \ left | \ phi _ 0 \ right \ rangle } \ right | \ left \ langle \ phi _ 0 \ left | \ dot { \ jmath } \ right | \ phi _ 0 \ right \ rangle \ left | ^ { \ ; \ right \ left ( \ omega - ( a _ 0 - e _ 0 ) \ right ) \ ; . \ dot { resigmadelta } \ ] ] the transfer operator is given by @ xmat##h45 where @ xmath46 , @ xmath47 are creation and annihilation operators for electrons with spin @ xmath48 in the molecular orbitals @ xmath49 , and @ xmath50 is the transition element between the corresponding two - dimensional states . # ( [ resigmadelta ] ) is readily obtained . the absorption of a photon with spin @ xmath34 is an excitation of the ground state @ xmath51 and the excited states @ xmath39 with spin @ xmath52 . the amplitude for this absorption of @ xmath53 determines the oscillator frequency , @ xmath54 . for a detailed description of the state @ xmath55 , the absorption operator is given in terms of the two operators , @ xmath56 which create / destroy an electron with spin @ xmath13 and @ xmath57 . from the completeness of the molecular orbitals @ xmath58 one then replaces @ xmath59 with @ xmath60 where , the equation can be simplified into the form @ xmath61 where the black - box amplitudes @ xmath62 are .consider the overlap between the excited state @ xmath63 and the ground state @ xmath64 with an electron at @ xmath65 and a hole at @ xmath66 ( if @ xmath67 ) . it is thus seen that the elements @ xmath68 serve to answer the question of how far a given excited state @ xmath63 may be viewed from the electron - hole content of the ground state , and they thus enter the kubo equation for the electrical conductivity . note that the expression of ( [ matrix ] ) does not consider the full time dependence of the many - body wave functions @ xmath63 or @ xmath64 as in @ xcite or the density and correlation ##s of the ground state as in @ xcite . the corresponding elements for the correlation operator , @ xmath69 and ( [ matrixelement ] ) , do not vary significantly over long distances . therefore , it is not sufficient to introduce the coarse - grained expression for the electron - hole content of @ xmath39 with respect to @ xmath70 , @ xmath71 where @ xmath72 is the wave function for the ( [) and @ xmath73 / atom @ xmath74 . @ xmath75 is the energy difference of the excited @ xmath76 and the ground state @ xmath70 with the electron - hole interaction in the nuclei at @ xmath74 and @ xmath77 , respectively . the ( [ amplitude ] ) is universal and applicable to all quantum - mechanical systems . it is currently under investigation for the theoretical analysis of the lattice ##s with the density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) at @ xcite . in the next section , the present case of indo / indo - theory will be discussed in more detail . as mentioned above , the ground state is represented as the indo state at @ xmath78 \ psi _ { \ sigma } ^ { \ dagger } ( \ vec { x } _ n ) \ ldots \ psi _ { \ sigma } ^ { \ dagger } ( \ vec { x } _ n ) where the atomic orbitals @ xmath79 ( @ xmath80 ) are represented as a linear combination of spatial atomic orbitals ( aos ) @ xmath81 @ xmath82the molecular orbitals are centered at certain positions such that @ xmath83 represents the hole position ( @ xmath84 ) and the electron @ xmath85 . the spin singlet excited - state state functions are described as linear combinations of spin - spin configuration state functions [ phicisdef ] @ xmath86 where the indices @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 correspond to the excited states of occupied and empty molecular orbitals , respectively . with these indices for @ xmath51 and @ xmath39 , it is assumed that the coordinates of the lone pairs pass ( [ amplitude ] ) directly through the virtual orbital @ xmath89 whereas the rest are described by the empty , occupied mos @ xmath90 , @ xmath91 to perform the calculations , one needs to address the coarse - grain approximation @ xmath75 , ( [ amplitude ] ) , @ xmath92 and the linear approximation the indo ##le @ xcite and the coordinates of the atomic orbitals in the complex plane were used , i . e . , @ xmath93 requires that @ xmath94 , ao ##s , and@ xmath95 are the ci coefficients of the indo wave function . in this case , one can verify that @ xmath96 , if one takes into account the indo approximation and the normalization of @ xmath97 ##4 ( [ phicisdef ] ) , @ xmath98 therefore , @ xmath99 can be used as a indo wave function for finding a hole around the nucleus @ xmath74 and an electron around the nucleus @ xmath77 . this formula is not valid for the indo / ci approximation . a check must be made , whether the values of @ xmath99 have equal weight compared to aos of @ xmath13 symmetry . it turns out that this weight is very small , and one can sum the values of the aos of each electron without a count . one has to verify that the detected electron - hole correlations for an excited state actually result from the electron - hole interaction rather than from a coincidence of the interaction of two independent electrons due to a small molecule . thus , the quantity @ xmath100 has been calculated according to the formula ( [ amplitude ] ) . thus , @ xmath101 is the indowave function where the homo is substituted for the lumo . this leads to the ` ` ` electron - hole ' ' configuration , i . e . , in the cis - species this pure wave function has the coefficients @ xmath102 for @ xmath103 , @ xmath104 , and all other coefficients are equal to 1 . from the @ xmath99 the absolute value @ xmath105 of the distance of the electron - hole pair can be calculated with the sum of the bond angles @ xmath106 the standard deviation @ xmath107 is not accessible , @ xmath108 in small molecules , the confinement of the oligomers can determine the distance of the electron - hole pair . in larger molecules , if the interaction between hole and electron is weak , @ xmath109 and @ xmath107 will vary with molecular size since the particles move around independently of the molecule . on the other hand , the interaction between electron and hole may bring them together at a constant distance even though the size of the molecule increases . such a constant electron - hole pair will lead to a constant value of @ xmath109 and @ xmath107 forevery one size . note , however , @ xmath109 and @ xmath107 both contain an information about the bond extension of an atom and may help to describe the localization of an electron - hole pair onto regions of the molecule ; an example of this situation is shown below . in order to get a more detailed way of the electron - hole pair distribution , one may focus on a quasi one - dimensional chain of n molecules ; figure [ 3 : 4a ] shows how those chains are chosen . when @ xmath110 is plotted for this , a bound electron - hole pair will have large values on the diagonal of the chain and vanishingly small values in the off - diagonal regions . other pairs will lead to the same results . the one - dimensional curve @ xmath110 can be further subdivided into @ xmath111 which is also a function of the electron - hole distance . the inverse of @ xmath112 gives smooth curves as a function of @ xmath88 . @ xmath113 gives the most concise description of the electron - hole distance . the @ xmath114 model has been proposed for the molecules , whose molecules are of an osci##llator strength in the spectra : the @ xmath7 , the @ xmath8 , and the @ xmath9 state . here , the state @ xmath7 is formed . as seen from figure [ fig : 4b ] , no bound state is formed for the two phenylene rings . in fact , the ring confinement is possible due to a chain reaction of two phenylene rings . for four phenylene rings , see figure [ fig : 4c ] , and for systems , a bound electron - hole pair is formed . the position of @ xmath115 in the spectrum along the one - dimensional axis does not change for systems containing then five phenylene rings . the @ xmath7 state also corresponds to a strongly bound electron - hole pair . figure [ fig : 5a ] shows the observed electron - hole pairs and the corresponding standard deviation for the @ xmath7 states as a function of system size . they saturate for more than two phenylene rings , @ xmath116 . this is in good agreement with the observed values of them obtained from electro - optical measurements @ xcite . some examples of electron energy - loss measurements , however, seem to hint at a totally random nature of the transition states : they are almost always to increase with the size of the oligomer @ xcite . at present , the reason for this phenomenon is not known . the high value for @ xmath117 and the relatively high mean value for the standard distribution @ xmath118 are clearly apparent from the ` ` ` ' ' s of @ xmath119 , ' ( [ smoothedp ] ) . as shown in figure [ fig : 5b ] , @ xmath120 decreases with increasing ring size , the normal distribution increases , and reaches a maximum for @ xmath121 . for oligomers with more and more phenylene rings the distribution does not change significantly . since at the same time the distribution expands , the values of @ xmath117 and @ xmath122 saturate . the relatively small values of @ xmath122 are due to the formation of the maximum of the distribution at a small value of @ xmath123 . finally , figure [ fig : 5c ] shows the value of @ xmath124 for the largest oligomer with five phenyle##ne ##f ( @ xmath125 ) . next , the state @ xmath8 is found . brdas and coworkers have located this state in the optical spectrum of poly - p - phenylene - vinylene ( ppv ) , which they assign to a charge transfer state . in this case this state is bound to an unbound electron - hole pair . the optical spectrum to this charge transfer state is in the same region as the energy level of the photocurrent in the surrounding polymeric film . as a result , they conclude that the energy of this state is sufficient for this ` ` abatic ' ' state of the photocurrent . the @ xmath8 state shown in the present calculation is in the same region as the charge - transfer state in ppv , that lies between the @ xmath7 and the high - energy states . the question is , whether the @ xmath8 state is a charge transfer state or not . as shown in the [ 6 : 6a ] , the @ xmath8 state has the identical values of @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 . a change in these values occurs for the @ xmath125 oligomerwhich look at the curves for both states . this conclusion , however , is not supported by a more detailed look at the results for @ xmath128 as a function of oligomer length , see figure [ fig : 6b ] , and the results for @ xmath129 for the same oligomer , see figure [ fig : 6c ] . the results are essentially the same as for the two @ xmath7 states . for example , compare figures [ fig : 5c ] and [ fig : 6c ] : @ xmath115 and @ xmath129 are essentially identical in the off - center regions . similarly , the curves @ xmath128 as a function of oligomer length resemble those of @ xmath119 , see figures [ fig : 5b ] and [ fig : 6b ] . the only difference to the @ xmath7 state is the assignment of the electrons to three regions of the spectrum in @ xmath8 . because of this , we can only describe this state as an ~ elctron - hole , or ~ exciton , and have no explanation for the rise of the photocurrent oflppp of about 1 . 5 ev can be predicted at this level of theory . this is in accordance with the fact that local heating due to high energy is the reason for the existence of the photocurrent @ xcite and for the nature of the other excited states . however , for the @ xmath9 state , the mean electron - hole separation does not decrease but grows with system temperature , see figure . [ fig : 7a ] . from such an approximation one might expect a delocalized state . on the contrary , for the @ xmath9 state the degree of localization is _ higher _ than in the other two excited states , and the electron - hole pair is not restricted to a single phenylene atom . as can be seen from the [ fig : 7b ] and [ fig : 7c ] , the apparent lack of bonding in @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 points to the fact that the elctron - hole pairs on the bonds can be completely independent , i . e . , an excited state can be formed which , nevertheless , does not contribute to the bonding . as for the states @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 ,there is an expansion of @ xmath132 into off - diagonal regions with increasing system size , and the smoothed distribution function @ xmath133 displays the same trends as before . so far , every state transition can be regarded as a single electron - hole pair with different degrees of localization . they are the analogues of the excitons in the structure of dna . in order to explain the transition to a pure ` ` band structure ' ' , the process is repeated for @ xmath101 , and ( [ homolumo ] ) . as expected , and illustrated by figures [ fig : 8a ] , [ fig : 8b ] , and [ fig : 8c ] , the distribution of electron and hole in the molecule is uncorrelated . in contrast to the excitonic analysis before , the almost linear expansion of the total electron - hole pair and the distribution as a function of system size in figure [ fig : 8a ] is accompanied by a rounding and expansion of the smoothed distribution function @ xmath134 , see figure [ fig : 8b ] . as seen from figure [ fig : 8c ] there is a variation on the off - diagonal region of the smoothed distribution @xmath135 , which also looks like a half ##tone . hence , the excitonic behavior of the states @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 , and @ xmath9 is unique , and is just a change in the uncorrelated motion of an electron and a hole in a restricted geometry . the excited and singlet excited states of various oligomers of lppp have been described with different methods . a good agreement was found with the experimental absorption spectra , except for the measurements of the fluorescence spectrum , and the relative electron - hole interactions . a new analysis of the excited states has been made . as in the absorption experiments , the overlap between pairs of excited states and the ground state with an electron - hole pair is studied as a function of their relative positions in the oligomers . the states with high oscillator strengths are considered to be the electron - hole pairs . therefore , an explanation of the # ##ity of the photocurrent in lppp spectra can be found at this level of a quantum theory . this work has been made possible with the kind technical assistance of dr . frenking , and the financial support of the graduiertenkolleg ` `optoelektronik mesoskopischer halbleiter ' ' as well as the aurc and the marsden laboratory in cambridge . r . ditchfield , w . j . hehre and j . a . pople , _ j . chem . phys . _ * 54 * , 724 ( 1971 ) . + w . j . hehre , r . ditchfield and j . a . pople , _ j . chem . phys . _ * 54 * , 2257 ( 1972 ) . + p . c . hariharan and j . a . pople , _ theo . * 27 * , 209 ( 1974 ) . + j . a . gordon , _ chem . lett . _ * 27 * , 163 ( 1980 ) . + p . c . hariharan and j . a . pople , _ theo . . acta _ * 89 * , 213 ( 1973 ) . + m . a . petersson , m . anderson , m . a . tensfeldt , m . a . el - laham , m . a . shirley and a . mantzaris , _ j . chem . phys . _ * 89 * , 2193 ( 1988 ) . +##ian 94 , # d4 ;
