studies of nearby galaxy clusters and groups at @ xmath5 often find regions with little - to - no star formation activity , in sharp contrast with the field . over - dense regions are dominated by red , passively - interacting s0 and elliptical galaxies , whereas more sparsely - populated regions tend to contain galaxies with shorter arms , younger stellar populations , and much higher star formation rates @ xcite . the observed trend of increasing local stellar activity with age ( the butcher - oemler effect ; * ? ? ? * ) has been used as evidence for higher star formation rates and higher mass build - up in higher density clusters or groups , that star formation is initiated more recently by one or more galaxies in over - dense regions . although different mechanisms can account for the rate of star formation in over - dense regions ( for a review , see * ? ? ? galaxies ) environments with sufficiently low tidal heating can be easily perturbed by mergers . galaxies can also be transformed more quickly by the interaction of tidal perturbations with neighbours , a process called starvation @ xcite . tidal heating can burn away the ' s ' gas ( starvation ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?* ) , cutting off the fuel source for future star formation and leading to a significant decline in sf activity . in the high - density environment of galaxy clusters , the hot ( @ xmath6 ) intra - cluster medium ( icm ) can trigger star formation by removing gas from it via ram - induced relaxation @ xcite . the relative effects of these physical processes are highly dependent on the cluster or group properties ( dynamical state , temperature , and intra - cluster or intra - group medium ) and environment . targeted observations of galaxy clusters and groups at @ xmath7 have provided further evidence that this transformation occurs not just in the cluster environment , but at high temperatures outside of cluster outskirts or galaxy clusters @ xcite . experiments with star formation processes in the ir @ xcite , ir @ xcite , and other spectral - line measures @ xcite have shown evidence of _ pre - processing _ , whereby infalling galaxies undergo transformation prior to their arrival in the galaxy cluster , whereas they are formed earlier in the cluster environment @ xcite . the pre - processing hypothesis has also been supported by studies of the temperature dependence on both morphology @ xcite and morphology @ xcite . numerical simulations have also been used to study the effects and consequences of galaxy pre- processing . @ xcite showed that the dominant physical processes galaxies are likely subjected to in their environment , including the frequent gravitational field interactions of harassment , are capable of transforming late - type , disk - dominated galaxies into disk - dominated , early - type . therefore , @ xcite used simulations of dark matter and galaxy clusters , with mass - analytic models ( sams ) to compare the haloes with galaxies , and traced the histories of the cluster galaxies that ended up accreting onto low - mass haloes in different epochs . in doing so , @ xcite determined what fraction of those cluster galaxies had been in clusters characteristic of low - masses for a long enough time to have been pre - processed prior to entering the cluster . the results of their simulation showed that at low ages a large fraction of cluster galaxies could have been affected by their environment prior to entering the cluster , while at earlier ages the fraction of pre - processed galaxies in clusters should likely increase . the fraction of cluster galaxies affected by pre - processing in the @ xcite simulation depends on the assumed timescale for the physical processes ( es ) in their environment to affect them , and also has a different age distribution . although many assumptions go into this simulation , the simulation highlights a certainnote that the rate of pre - processing has likely changed significantly over cosmic time , and that the @ xmath8 pre - processing should be extremely prevalent . some studies have suggested that the quenching of sf activity in galactic nuclei is likely driven by two distinct , and possibly separable , components : mass evolution ( see ` mass evolution ' ) and human - driven processes ( ` environment ' ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? . however , see also @ xcite for a discussion about how _ history bias _ affects ' s ability to disentangle human - and environment - effects . therefore , any attempt to examine the environmental effects on galaxy evolution must take a full account for the fact that one s galaxy selection function introduces environmental effects , especially since the galaxy - mass distribution is likely to vary with the @ xcite . concerns about biases introduced by the galaxy selection function are compounded when examining galaxies over a wide range in redshift , as one s sample , in galaxy mass and in other parameters , including sfr , will undoubtedly also vary with @ xmath9 . as a result , in some of these studies that extend to environment - @ xmath9 one may restrict one s sample to onlystudy galaxies with high sfrs , and thereby provide a more complete picture of the effects of environment on galaxy evolution . furthermore , studies leading to post - @ xmath9 tend to sample a wide dynamic range of environments , which further limits ' s ability to draw firm conclusions about environmentally - driven processes . a comprehensive understanding of galaxy evolution in these environments must be sensitive to the large dynamic range of galaxy densities in order to understand not just the dense regions , like clusters and clusters , but the more diffuse filament and void regions . a major challenge faced when examining the research results examining galaxy evolution , in addition to the many sources of potential data , is the wide range of methods employed to measure density . initially , @ xcite used an array of different aperture measurement methods , which could be broadly divided into two categories : nearest - neighbour methods , which measure galaxy density with an aperture that changes depending on the observed galaxy density , and fixed - aperture methods , whose apertures do not vary , to examine a large galaxy catalogue . @ xcite found that these methods all use the same data set and produce different results , but that the nearest - neighbour methods appear to be optimal for mapping the magnetic field within massive haloes , while the fixed - aperture methods are better atfor probing superhalo - scales . therefore , the technique that is used to identify large scale structures ( lss ) , like stars , clusters , and filaments , is not necessarily the best method for measuring the magnetic properties of those structures . in this work , we attempt to quantify the effects of pre - expansion in the early universe by analysing the rest - frame magnetic and star - forming properties of galaxies as a function of changes over the two orders of magnitude of the density in the coma supercluster . by focusing on the photo - @ xmath9 field , we ensure that our sample of galaxies , derived from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) , is spectroscopically accurate compared to dwarf galaxies ( @ xmath10 ) . furthermore , we do not have to rely on high resolution ( photo - @ xmath9 ) data , which would introduce additional artifacts due to interlopers in our sample and light smearing in the line - of - sight . to map the structure of the supercluster , we employ two different methods : voronoi distance ( vt ) and the minimal mean distance ( mst ) . the vt uses a non -neighbour - based methods , which can measure the local target field only over the large dynamic range of densities that we observed in the coma supercluster . the latter technique is most effective in characterising cluster structures , like clusters , galaxies , and filaments , and so we use the latter to differentiate the types of structures observed at sub - halo scales . our combined gps and ms approach allows us to measure all components of the cosmic background by measuring the fundamental density functions of the cluster , group , galaxy , and galaxy environments . one benefit of the use of our target field is sensitivity to low sfrs , and our previous approach of using the _ stellar evolution explorer _ ( galex ; * ? ? ? * ) and wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ? * ) to measure unobscured and dust - free star - formation data , respectively , across the entire coma supercluster down to 0 . 02 @ xmath11 . section [ sample ] on the coma supercluster and our sample selection process , with our data from sdss , _ galex _ , and wise . in section [ lss ] we outline our methods for measuring the lss in the coma supercluster ,and in section [ results ] we present our new sfrs and comparisons of sf activity and colour versus size . in section [ discussion ] we discuss the implications of our results , and compare our work to previous papers . in this paper we use cosmological parameters @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 , and @ xmath14 km s @ xmath15 mpc @ xmath15 , where the physical quantities have been calculated using the online gravitational model of j . r . smith @ xcite . throughout we use a kroupa imf @ xcite , and here we will refer to those with constant mass m @ xmath1610 @ xmath17 as small galaxies , and those with m @ xmath1810 @ xmath17 as massive galaxies . the pegasus supercluster is an ideal site to study signatures of gravitational interactions in nearby galaxies . it contains two large galaxy clusters , abell 1656 and abell 1367 , and several galaxy groups moving in a filamentary pattern between the two clusters @ xcite . however , the two clusters are in two nearly stable states , with a1656 still stable and a1367 still insignificant merging @ xcite . the close proximity of the supercluster ( @ xmath19 ) allows us to narrow its galaxy population down to 20 galaxies ( @ xmath20 ) with a spectroscopically resolved image , and the compact shape of the supercluster , with the galaxy center extending nearly parallel to our line - of - sight @ xcite , makes it an ideal case study to examine galaxies in a wide range of directions with little measurement error . past studies of the local supercluster have been primarily focused on the most massive cluster , a1656 . its low redshift , high galactic density ( @ xmath21 ) , and richness ensured that it received a great deal of attention from astronomers in early extragalactic studies ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . the significant merging @ xmath01 mpc region of the centre of a1656 , which has since been tentatively identified as the infalling cluster @ xcite , was confirmed first by the high galactic density of galaxies centered on the cluster ngc 4839 , and was later confirmed by the peculiar x - ray profile and peculiar morphology of member galaxies . @ xcite contains a large number of` k - starburst ' ( or k + a ) galaxies associated with the ngc 4839 group , led to the conclusion that the ngc 4839 group had experienced a burst of star formation @ xmath22 gyr ##o @ xcite , possibly caused by tidal effects of the galaxy - wide burst @ xcite . a study of @ xcite , examining emission - line and k + a galaxies in the galactic cluster of a1656 , found a spatial correlation between these sources and the x - ray sub - sources from @ xcite , which suggested that radiation from the nearby icm might be an important factor in causing starbursts , and thus extinction , for infalling galaxies . observations of the new supercluster population had to wait for new all - sky surveys with sufficient sensitivity to detect galaxies down to dwarf galaxies . however , the accurate identification of supercluster members necessitates proxy data , which , prior to the sdss discovery , only existed for the most distant galaxies and those located near the largest galaxies . @ xcite were the first to conduct an extensive study of the environmental effects of star - formation events on galaxies in the sdss , by comparing the sfrs , among otherchemical and morphological studies of galaxy clusters , to the volume density of @ xmath0122 000 , in the sdss data set one ( dr1 ) . they found that for galaxies of high solar masses , the sfrs generally lie at higher densities , and that the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is also much more common for galaxies with high galaxy density . @ xcite used @ xmath23 low - @ xmath9 ##2 in sdss dr4 , and showed a uniform bimodal distribution between active and passive sf ##rs , using the equivalent width method ( or @ xmath24 ) , and determined that the passive galaxies generally lie in regions with higher local galaxy density . one of the first major systematic studies of the density dependence of physical properties on galaxies , using spectroscopically - based members , was by @ xcite . they used sdss dr7 to select @ xmath04000 supercluster members , and calculated the local density of the galaxy by measuring the volume density of galaxies with a unit of radius @ xmath25mpc and a arc - length of 10 ^ s @ xmath15 ( but with a slightly different treatment of the radiuswith the latter , ( described in the [ appendix _ b ] ) . they examined the different colour , morphology , and frequency of post - starburst galaxies in different environments , and found a weak dependence of both colour and morphology with environment for the most massive galaxies and a strong dependence of colour and morphology on environment for dwarf galaxies , and also that almost all post - starburst galaxies reside in low - density regions . @ xcite , using a large sample of sdss - containing members of coma , examined the relative density of star - forming and agn - rich galaxies ( characterised using sdss spectral line measurements ) vs local projected density . they found a similar broad picture to @ xcite , whereby star formation in dwarf galaxies is more quenched at higher density , and more massive galaxies show a weaker dependence on projected density . @ xcite also used data from _ spitzer _ mips at : @ xmath26 @ xmath27 , which was available only for the cluster regions of a1656 and a1367 , to obtain a detailed accounting of star formation activity in the lower - density regions of coma . for a1656 , the more massive of the two clusters , they found the ir detections only in the infallingregions , and found the strongest correlation between dust - obscured and unobscured sfr with star - centric radius . similarly , for the more massive a1367 they found the reverse radial dependence for the fraction of star - forming galaxies when sf ##r was derived by the optical ir / ir measure . this result seems to indicate that the analysis of the tracers of sf ##r , un - obscured and dust - obscured , will be able to give a clear picture of the quenching of sfr in galaxies . with the release of the sloan all - sky survey , we now have access to the full spectrum of sf activity for the entire coma supercluster , and so this study presents the first look sensitive to un - obscured and dust obscured sf ##r for virtually all galaxies in all environments of the coma supercluster , down to the sfrs and with a sample of galaxies well over two orders of magnitude in stellar radius . with our sfr data , and our techniques for analyzing the effects of the cosmic background , we are in a position to place significant quantitative limits on the extent to which pre - processing sf activity . @ xmath8 . our sample of supercluster galaxies was taken from dr9 of the sloan digital sky survey ( dr##ss ; * ? ? ? * ) , which has sampled a large area of the cluster with @ xmath28 mag and conducted an extensive cluster search program , ( including the sdss coverage program ) for galaxies with @ xmath29 mag . we select coma supercluster galaxies from the sdss dr9 ##3 group using the selection criteria provided by @ xcite , including galaxies with positions ( @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 ) consistent with the coma supercluster and line - of - sight velocities , @ xmath32 , within @ xmath332000 km s @ xmath15 of either a1656 ( @ xmath34 km s @ xmath15 ) or a1367 ( @ xmath35 km s @ xmath15 ) , where the total mass of the cluster comes from @ xcite . to find the duplicate galaxies in our sample , we select only galaxies with the specprimary data set . to make sure that our sample is spectroscopically consistent over the coma supercluster , we select only galaxies with @ xmath3617 . 5 mag . we have also excluded any galaxies with the zwarning numberto avoid a poor redshift determination ( which affects less than 1 per cent of galaxies in the sky ) . we also use detections in the wise 3 . 5 and 4 . 5 @ xmath26 - bands for our sample sample ( less than 1 . 5 per cent of our sample has detections in these two bands ) , and we apply a stellar mass cut - off ( for stellar masses calculated with wise data , see figure [ fig ] ) such that all galaxies in our sample are m @ xmath37 . the m @ xmath38 cut - off excludes all dwarf galaxies , it ' s necessary to select our sample , which is @ xmath39 - band ##ed , from being biased at the lowest galaxy level towards only those dwarf galaxies which are the most actively star - forming . these two criteria result in a sample of 3505 galaxies over the supercluster region covering @ xmath0500 deg @ xmath1 in the sky . figure [ fig : coma _ galaxies ] shows the galaxy positions over the supercluster . the virial masses for the two galaxies shown in figure [ fig : coma _ galaxies ] come from the @ xmath40 ( the radius at which thethis is close to unity ( that of the critical density ) as measured by @ xcite . having sdss lines for all of our galaxies , we can help mitigate the effects of galaxies dominated by an agn , which could potentially contaminate our sfr spectrum . @ xcite uses the emission lines of the sdss galaxy spectra to classify galaxies according to a wise , phillips , & terlevich ( bpt ) diagram @ xcite , which cleanly distinguishes those galaxies which host liner and agn emission , to those dominated by emission from hii stars . we use the @ xcite classifications to classify galaxies dominated by agn and liner emission , and we exclude the wise diagram @ xmath26 ##0 observations from these galaxies when measuring their sf ##r throughout . the advantage of having sdss emission lines for our galaxies is due to the ` 4000 luminous ' index , @ xmath41 , which is a measurement of the ratio of the luminous flux density in two narrow continuum galaxies , 3850 - 3950 and 4000 - 4100 @ xcite . this index scales directly with the age of the stellar population of a galaxy , and has been shown to be a useful tool for distinguishing quiescent ` red dwarf ' galaxies from those thatand more actively star - forming in the ` double stars ' , with the approximate dividing line between these two clusters being @ xmath42 @ xcite . finally , we use measurements of @ xmath41 for sdss derived from @ xcite . we also make use of the h @ xmath43 line , giving the measurement of @ xmath44 @ xcite which is described in more detail in the [ kpa _ in _ space ] . we correct the uv - to - nir - photometry for galaxies using the @ xcite - corrections , finding the extinction corrections of @ xcite with r @ xmath45 = 0 . 5 . for the _ galex _ group we used the extinction corrections of @ xcite . we apply _ k _ - correction to our measurements of kcorrect v4 _ 2 @ xcite to get all uv - through - nir measurements into the reference frame . . the two central galaxies ( s : a1656 , sw : a1367 ) are identified by the double stars , which have radii corresponding to their virial distances . the virial distances come from @ xmath40 measurements . @ xcite, n = 326 ] . [ source : coma _ cluster ] we obtained the time - corrected position of sf ##r in the supercluster galaxies from the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ; * ? ? ? * ) gr6 / gr7 data set , which includes mappings of the supercluster galaxies near - uv ( nuv ; 1750 - 2750 ) and far - uv ( fuv ; 1350 - 1750 ) data . matching the sdss galaxy coordinates to galex was done using the mikulski center for space telescope ( hires ) coordinates , with the sr @ xmath46 search radius centred on the sdss galaxy coordinate . in case of missing galex coordinates within the search radius , the galex coordinate with a position closest to that of the sdss galaxy coordinate is used . the galex coordinates are very sensitive to the photospheric emission of stars with masses @ xmath47 , and thus the uv continuum can provide an excellent tracer of future star formation . under the conditions of a star formation timescale that s is relative to the mass of these massive stars ( @ xmath48 y ) , and a known distance , one can obtain the sfr @ xmath49 yto be given l @ xmath49 . the conversion between an observed ir and an sfr will be accurate as long as the emission picked up in the s ##n band is dominated by the light of stars older than l @ xmath50 years . although the fuv and nuv bands are usually dominated by emission from young stars , if there is recent or on - going sf ##r , the nuv band contains a significant fraction of contaminating emission from stars as old as @ xmath010 @ xmath51 years @ xcite . our survey covers about 500 sq . miles , and so it is unsurprising that the _ galex _ coverage rates vary greatly across the supercluster . almost the entire supercluster has been covered with _ galex _ at various depths , but about 5 per cent of our total sample of supercluster galaxies does not lie within the _ galex _ coverage region . the galaxies that are part of _ galex _ coverage region are mapped so that they are excluded from further analysis of sf ##rs in the supercluster , as the sfrs we obtained from other instruments will necessarily be lower resolution . the shallowest observation with _ galex _ in coma hasan exposure time of about 60 seconds , and the average is about 3 @ xmath5210 @ xmath53 ##10 . however , to ensure that the sensitivity of our survey to sfr @ xmath49 is uniform across the supercluster , we must also account for the variations in sensitivity due to variations in the parameters . we measure sensitivity of a representative sample of _ galex _ nuv and fuv maps in coma , even the shallowest ones , by taking a supercluster galaxy embedded in the map and randomly - placing that galaxy , with a number of parameters , into the map . for each sample , we insert 100 of these ` fake ' galaxies into the fuv and nuv map with different parameters , and then repeat 100 times for a total of 3 @ xmath54 randomly placed maps per flux bin . we then run an algorithm @ xcite on each of the 100 maps per flux bin to determine the fraction of the ` fake ' galaxies that we measure as a function of flux density . figure [ 1 : galex _ map ] shows the completeness that we measure for the entire fuv and nuv map ( with 60 seconds exposure time ) of the coma survey##cluster . we have taken the fluxes up to 75 per cent completeness in the combined fuv and nuv spectra ( indicated by the dashed lines in figure [ fig : galex _ completeness ] ) , and we excluded any other data for galaxies associated with fluxes below these two thresholds from our data . the completeness threshold in nuv is that our coma supercluster catalogue is 75 % complete to sfr @ xmath55 in all environments . [ the mean redshift of our coma supercluster is . , width = 307 ] . figure [ fig : galex _ complete ] shows , our sfr estimate for the coma supercluster is much lower in the nuv than in the fuv , and so we choose to use the nuv band to estimate sfrs . to avoid having our sfr estimates be skewed by the presence of an alien galaxy population , which can contaminate the nuv spectrum to a greater extent than in the fuv , we will use nuv - based sfr estimates for any galaxy whose sdss spectrum has a significant ` 4000 break ' , based on @ xmath56 . this is described in detail in section [ galexsfrs] . a complete measure of sfr , especially for galaxies with a high dust content , must include non - obscured ( si ) estimates of sf activity . a significant step forward in the understanding of star - forming activity in the coma supercluster has recently been made possible with the all - sky images obtained from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ? * ) , which has mapped the near - infrared sky in three dimensions ( w1 - w4 ) starting at 3 . 0 , 4 . 0 , 12 . 0 , and 14 . 0 @ xmath26 galaxies . of particular interest to our analysis is the blue band , which represents the right - hand portion of the normal absorption curve of star - forming galaxies . we match our sdss catalogue to the wise point source catalogue by filling in the 22 @ xmath46 radius around each sdss galaxy cluster , and ignoring the one galaxy whose position is closest to that of the sdss catalogue . for galaxies matched to the wise point source catalogue , we use w4 galaxies whose signal - to - noise ratio w4 is greater than 22 . we estimate noise in w4 for a small sample of the coma supercluster , following the procedure outlined in section[ galex ] . for the w4 we are 75 % close to f @ xmath57 } $ ] @ xmath58 4 . 7 mjy , which means our measurements of sfr @ xmath59 are close to sfr @ xmath600 . f @ xmath11 for members of the coma supercluster ( see l @ xmath61 ) . for comparison , the only instrument prior to wise capable of detecting non - stellar star formation activity across the coma supercluster was l @ xcite , whose upper limit for f @ xmath59 in coma with its f @ xmath26 absorption line is a full two orders of magnitude higher ( l @ xmath62 ) . the two long - wavelength wise observations , which sample the far side of the 1 . 6 au photospheric region , can be used to robustly estimate the known stellar masses ( l @ xmath38 ) . our work on @ xcite includes the calibration of the values measured in _ irac ch1 and ch2 and a _ r stellar masses ( assuming a salpeter imf ) . we have published the @ xcite calibration , convertedto find kroupa imf to be integrated with the rest of our study , consider the wise parameters w1 and w2 . in figure [ 2 : st _ 1 ] we plot a comparison between the stellar masses of coma supercluster galaxies from the @ xcite method with w1 + w2 , and the stellar mass estimates from the sdss @ xcite , where we find some correlation between these two different estimates of stellar mass . a key component of our analysis is to understand the local environment in a more realistic way . typically , this approach has involved a measurement of the local mass ( 2d ) or volume ( 3d ) scales of galaxies to determine the environment near a particular galaxy based on the local density . the physical characterization of environment requires not just a measurement of the local projected density , but a method to determine the structures ( rings , rings , etc . ) formed by galaxies . the latter process can be very difficult , as lss mapping techniques are often susceptible to biases caused by the local shape and size that one is examining . we have developed a method to measure lss and other galaxy structures in a way which is independent of the shape and size scale of the structure , and allows one to estimate local projected densitydensity over an arbitrarily large size range of densities , by using a combination of voronoi tessellation ( to calculate global surface density ) and the minimal spanning tree ( to calculate local structures ) . vt is a method of decomposing a set of points into discrete cells ( voronoi cells ) , where each cell corresponds to one point and the boundaries of the cells enclose all of the surrounding space corresponding to that point . vt has proven to be a very powerful tool for characterizing the local gravitational field ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? when using a direct surface density measurement to determine the total galaxy density , one must be careful to not allow gravitational effects to further contaminate the density estimates . to help mitigate this we recommend using only spectroscopically - confirmed members . we note in appendix [ 1 _ 2 ] that our surface measurements of the galaxy supercluster match well with the density measurements obtained following the analysis of @ xcite . for an additional strong demonstration of the effectiveness of surface density measurements as measurements of the volume density , see figure 1 of @ xcite , which shows a tight correlation between surface density and volume density for the two types ofand in galaxies being discovered in the abell 901 / 902 supercluster . a major problem when trying to measure the galaxy density field is determining the area ( or distance ) from which to measure the density of each galaxy s position . typically the density measurements are made on a size scale given by the function @ xmath63 nearest neighbour or by using a characteristic kernel with an arbitrary size scale . although these methods have flexible size scales , the shape of the cell used to calculate the density field is not fixed . calculating densities reliably in a _ wide _ range of environments is a technique that can adapt to arbitrary _ distant _ and _ local geometry . vt addresses the difficulty of needing both _ size and shape by using cells which automatically adjust to the nearby density , and which assume an _ a priori _ shape . in regions of low - density the cells are larger on average , and the cells are progressively smaller in higher density regions . with vt , one can calculate the galaxy density around a given galaxy s position by taking the average of the area of the universe that surrounds that galaxy . we calculate the density of the coma supercluster using the qhull function @ xcite in * idl * , which calculatesconvex ##ity for the normal distribution of density . a common issue with vt , and with any method of measuring the local gravitational field , is spurious density variations arising near the edges of the map , where the variations can be artificially large or completely unbounded . we solve this problem , by using galaxies from the sdss dr9 as a 10 km - wide ` buffer ' to our coma supercluster map , which all have properties consistent with coma and the same selection criteria as in section [ sdss ] , when calculating our density . we then exclude these buffer ##s from our analysis , so the main purpose of these galaxies is to ensure that we do not see any gravitational variations in our supercluster dataset . in figure [ fig : tessduo ] ( left ) we compare the voronoi distribution over the supercluster . we compare the distribution of cell densities over the supercluster to a set of 1500 maps generated with source clusters equally distributed , but all with an equal number of sources and an area similar to the coma supercluster map . in figure [ fig : tessduo ] ( right ) we compare the mean distribution of cell density observed in coma compared to the mean cumulative distribution ofsee voronoi cell distributions for the set of random realizations . these cell distributions are used to establish a cumulative distribution with which to compute our projected voronoi cell distributions in space . the [ fig : tessduo ] ( right ) shows a number of important differences between the projected density distribution of the coma supercluster population and that of the random realizations . as one would expect , since the supercluster contains regions of extremely high cell density , there is a much larger fraction of cells with densities typically of 1 - 10 gal h @ xmath64 mpc @ xmath65 than in the random distributions . but we also find that there is a larger fraction of cells in the coma supercluster with extremely low densities , around 1 - 10 gal h @ xmath64 mpc @ xmath65 , as a more dense population means that one has more prominent voids as well . the cumulative distribution of projected cell densities in our full coma catalogue also increases over a density range of 1 ( @ xmath66 ) = 0 . 53 . 1 [ gal h @ xmath64 mpc @ xmath65 ] , meaning that our supercluster map is over three millionof magnitude in the dynamic density . the random samples tend to sample about one tenth of magnitude in the density with an appreciable number of cells . this measures the gravitational field over the entire dynamic density range of the supercluster , but it is less effective at resolving complex structures . therefore , we must turn to the new approach of the paper . [ cols = " ^ , ^ " , ] @ xcite , hereafter m2010 , presented a list of white dwarf k + a galaxies in the coma supercluster , which came from a parent supercluster galaxy sample very similar to that of the published work , and with an identical set of parameters to select the non - starburst galaxies ( see section [ kpa _ vs _ p ] ) . however , we find only 62 candidate k + a galaxies . we matched the published m2010 k + a catalogue to our data , and found that 41 of the 110 galaxies proposed by m2010 are included in our coma supercluster sample . however , only 41 of the 62 candidate k + a galaxies from m2010 show spectral features , based on our sdss distance measurements , indicative of being k + a . [ [ fig : p _the _ line _ compare ] shows the differences between the m2010 * ( h @ xmath24 ) and * ( h @ xmath43 ) spectra , and those from the present work , for the newly proposed k + a galaxies added to our catalogue . it is also clear that there are significant differences in the alpha line measurements for the parameters relevant for selecting k + a galaxies , with a large measurement error for h @ xmath24 and a large error in the measurements of h @ xmath43 . the reasons for these differences stem from the different methods used to obtain the line measurements . the measurements obtained from the m2010 catalogue are from the * specline * product , whereas for the present work we use * galspecline * and * galspecindx * , which are based on the mpa - jhu model ( see * ? ? ? for the * specline * * product , the entire continuum is fit with the weighted mean / variance filter ( a . tremonti , * comm . ) , while for * galspecline * and * galspecindx * the continuum is fit with the population distribution models @ xcite . the differences in the fittingthey are responsible for most of the systematic differences between h @ xmath24 and in the [ fig : h _ x _ data _ set ] , as the measured h @ xmath24 from the standard model has largely been subtracted from the measurements made in m2010 . there is also a factor of @ xmath68 , because the * specline * measurements were not limited to the rest - frame , but for the case of coma this is a very important effect . the differences observed in h @ xmath43 come from a combination of the lack of robust physical measurements and the fact that the * specline * products measure h @ xmath43 using a simple technique . the h @ xmath43 measurement used for our coma study comes from the lick observatory h @ xmath44 , first used in @ xcite , and then later in @ xcite , which is used to optimally capture the h @ xmath43 spectral lines in the atmospheres of a - type stars .
