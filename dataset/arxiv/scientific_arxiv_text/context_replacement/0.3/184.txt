the application of lasers in atomic physics often demands long term stabilization of the peak frequency of the light emission . for these applications the stabilization technique @ xcite should be very carefully chosen and controlled , frequently increasing the laser linewidth and avoiding to introduce any unwanted noise in the laser emission frequency . however , stabilization to the center of an atomic - molecular transition usually requires special techniques and built - in detection . on the other hand , for many scientific and industrial applications one also needs to avoid frequency drifts and , sometimes , the resulting light pulse does not lay at the center of an atomic lineshape , but rather at a displaced frequency , as for instance , when using an optical laser @ xcite . for such applications a few simple and reliable techniques are developed @ xcite and used at e to work with it in various long term experiments . the basic idea behind many of these techniques is to create a dispersive lineshape that will produce an error signal . in particular , for the dichroic - vapor laser laser ( davll ) @ xcite and its variants @ xcite , the correct frequency can easily be chosen around the center of the non - broadened transition . however , a relatively uniform applied magnetic field is required to generate thedirect detection of the first order , and a direct detection with well known photodetectors is not necessary . + in this work we report on a simple way to generate a laser signal in a very simple way , and therefore of easy application . our technique explores the laser signal problem when a gaussian - profile laser beam is sent through an atomic vapor cell and is detected by linear filtering by an amplifier ( ex . [ setup ] ) . we call this technique angells , an acronym for a non - linearly generated laser - signal . + the third order transition term of an ideal atomic vapor polarization by a laser beam depends on a non - linear refractive index gradient , proportional to the laser wavelength . the total refractive index of the vapor can thus be expressed as @ xmath1 and the radial intensity gradient of a low - profile beam will induce a radial refractive index gradient in the vapor . this intensity gradient will in turn act as a focus for the gaussian beam , which will either suffer ( self ) - focusing or ( self ) - defocusing , depending on the sign of the total refractive index @ xcite . the nonlinear index occurs only when a cross section of thenonlinear medium . if on one side of the resonance frequency the induced increase is positive ( maximum on the z axis ) , the medium behaves as a converging lens and the signal of a initially collimated beam transmitted through an aperture will increase ( valley of the dispersive lineshape ) . on the other side of the resonance frequency the signal - induced increase is negative ( minimum on the axis ) , the medium acts as a decreasing lens and the beam through an aperture produces a steadily increasing signal ( valley of the nonlinear lineshape ) . in other words , the nonlinear medium acts as a lens which focal length depends on the laser wavelength . for a single atomic vapor , for instance , the non - zero refractive index can be written as @ xcite : @ xmath2 where @ xmath3 is the vapor width , @ xmath4 is the vapor temperature , @ xmath5 is the vapor constant , @ xmath6 is the vapor wavenumber , @ xmath7 is the vapor mass and @ xmath8 is the laser frequency detuning frequency to the atomic vapor . for high detuning frequencies ( @ xmath##9 ) , @ xmath10 is negative . for the detuning ( @ xmath11 ) , @ xmath10 is positive . the light passing through the aperture is strongly modulated when the aperture is centered around _ _ _ transition _ , resulting in a wave - like lineshape with _ _ width _ . + in our setup , the focusing medium is a thin atomic vapor , placed in the optical beam path by a special filter to produce nonlinear effects with higher light intensity and gradients . our experimental setup is shown in fig . [ setup ] . a 852 nm cw tunable semiconductor laser beam is splitted by a 90 / 10 beam filter . the lower - intensity beam ( @ xmath12 ) , of a gaussian intensity profile ( no optical filter needed ) and of slightly saturating intensity , is focused by a 1 mm - focal - length lens . a small ( 40 to @ xmath13 - @ xmath14c , corresponding to regions of @ xmath15 - @ xmath16 ) liquid crystal ( @ xcite placed in a 1 - mm - diameter optical cell @ xcite ) very close ( @ x##math13 ##0 . ) to the center of the laser beam . we consider the transition of the laser frequency through an aperture chosen so as to capture @ xmath17 of the beam diameter ( typically 1 - mm , for a beam of diameter 6 mm ) . when the beam is scanned around the captured @ xmath18 frequency transition , the beam refraction turns from self - focusing to self - defocusing . this gives rise to a dispersive - like lineshape due to a non - linear offset due to the line - of - resonance light source ( no in - phase interference ) . very few structures in these cells are subject to non - linear offset due to the beam reflection and the cell thickness . the comparable dimensions of the beam diameter and the cell thickness makes the detection of this high - frequency interaction difficult . however , this does not pose any significant problem to lock the beam at a point in the broad spectrum inside the doppler width . + the error signal is the deviation of the reference voltage ( corresponding to the frequency within the doppler line ) from the photodetector reference voltage . such an error signal is calculated and sent to the control of the laser frequency to correct for the frequency drifts. for semiconductor lasers , the gain is determined either by the injection current , the junction temperature or , in the case of extended cavity lasers , the external diffraction index ##s . we worked with a dfb laser diode resonant with the cs d @ xmath19 line and a fabry - prot semiconductor laser with extended cavity , starting with the rb d @ xmath19 line . the phase shift signal is reflected back to the junction temperature in the dfb or in the piezoelectric actuator in the extended - cavity laser @ xcite . for the sake of simplicity , we have operated these systems with a home - made electronic circuit with both proportional and exponential gains . + the design of the electronic circuit is shown in figure [ circuit ] . a quantum sensor ##er allows one to scan the operating frequency ( through current or by pzt ##v ) of the atomic nucleus . we choose a locking frequency with the help of a standard saturated amplitude ( sa ) spectrum carried out in an extra vapor cell and the characteristic sub - atomic frequencies ( see fig . [ locked ] b ) . we use the rf signal produced by this vapor cell as frequency reference ( fig . [ locked ] a ) as well as to monitor the locking frequency( fig . [ locked ] a ) . the locking process follows some simple steps : the laser is turned off and the offset finely adjusted until the selected frequency is at the desired locking frequency * ( @ xmath20 ) * , marked in red in fig . [ locked ] a and [ locked ] b . the sa signal is then brought to life by changing the reference voltage ( fig . [ locked ] b ) and a voltage closes the loop , ultimately locking the laser at the desired frequency ( fig . [ locked ] c ) . modifying the reference voltage allows one to lock the laser at a point within the desired width and thus to avoid the different hyperfine structures present in the sa signal . note that the reference voltage moves the error signal around , and so compensates for the non - resonant background signal . + ) , ( b ) dispersion curve for the error signal as a result of the detuning due to the frequency resonance , and ( c ) the angells - type - locked as well as - independent error signal . the desired frequency of * ( @ xmath20 ) is marked by a red dot in fig ( a ) and ( b ) , width = 302 ] and [ locked ] c . the sa signalwith the laser locked at the same frequency , for a period of a few minutes , as well as the sa signal for the unlocked laser . the laser remains unlocked for hours , after we have repeatedly and repeatedly checked our ready - made periodic table . the short - term rms frequency width is the same for the locked and the unlocked laser , i . e . of the order of 2 mhz or more , as if using the laser - band flank as a frequency discriminator . the long - term frequency width of the unlocked laser remains limited to less than 2 mhz rms , while the frequency of the laser unlocked for a few minutes is in excess of 20 [ . + , dashed line ) and over ( @ xmath21 , solid line ) the [ . , . , . = 302 ] we checked the stabilization due to vapor temperature and the rotation along the beam . although the vapor temperature has always varied between 45 and 20 @ xmath14c , the lineshape of the sa signal is stable against these conditions as shown in fig . [ dispersion ] below . the doppler - effect center position changes very rapidly ( @ xmath22mhz / @ xmath14c ) for this 20 @ xmath14##c . variation . each lineshape in fig . [ dispersion ] a has been measured at a different temperature ( values shown in the reference frame ) , fluctuating less than 1 @ xmath14c from the reference value . therefore , the laser frequency response , even at the doppler center , is strongly affected by the temperatures outside of the cell which lead to frequency variations of the order of 2 times greater than the rms beam width , as shown in fig . [ variation ] a . so to monitor the laser at temperatures other than at the beam width , we have only used the cell temperatur e , without any modification . more minor modifications occur in the pixel b , that do not play a role in the measurement process inside the line width . similarly , the error signal remains approximately unchanged over @ xmath13 20 - mm displacements along the beam , around the optimal width of the cell ( @ xmath13 20 mm on each side from focal point ) . another characteristic of using the angells technique is the possibility of changing the sign of the error signal slope by other optical means , as shown in fig [ dispersion ] b . the dispersive curve gets inverted when the beam is displaced _ across thefocal position _ ( see ref . [ 1 ] ) . we will mention here the fact that semiconductor lasers are well known to have very stable transitions @ xcite , allowing us to detect the noise in the input signal . for lasers with large intensity fluctuations a second photodetector can be used to normalize the frequency drift rate . in summary , we have presented an opto - electronic locking technique based on the direct generation of an amplitude zero - noise signal . the angells technique has proved to be an easy and reliable locking technique against large laser frequency drifts . for similar performance , the set - up is simpler than traditional locking techniques , not requiring magnetic fields or beam modulation . the set - up is simple : various combinations of laser frequency , cell size , temperature , cell shape and vapor pressure have been used , the values given in the article corresponding to those used for the presented techniques . acknowledgment : this project was partially funded by conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq , contract 472353 / 2009 - 8 ) and coordenao de aperfeioamento de pessoal de nvel superior ( cap ) ., m . v . and m . m . , grants in cnpq . 99 see , for instance , j . d . hall , y . - h . ma , m . taubman , b . tiemann , y . - hong , j . pfister , j . ye , ieee trans . on instr . and meas . * 4 * , 583 ( 1999 ) m . schmidt , j . hils , m . schmidt , j . opt . b * 6 * , 1576 ( 1988 ) the dispersive effect in an ideal system is represented by a slightly different ##efined zero - linewidth from the cyclic ##al ##bedo diagram . see , for instance , j . d . lett , j . d . phillips , j . d . rolston , j . d . smith , r . n . smith , j . d . westbrook , j . opt . b * 6 * , 2084 ( 1989 ) b . chron , j . gilles , j . martin , j . moreau , j . sorel , j . phys . b * 6 * , 401 ( 1994 ) j . d . corwin , y . - y . chen , j . m. adams , m . j . wieman , appl . opt . * 34 * , 3295 ( 1998 ) c . j . pearman , j . s . adams , m . g . hughes , d . j . griffin , m . a . smith , d . g . hughes , eng . phys . b : eng . opt . . phys . * 47 * , 5141 ( 2002 ) j . a . adams , n . j . smith , m . gray , n . b . kruger , j . d . close , appl . opt . * 47 * , 5163 ( 2008 ) n . b . kruger , a . j . a . slagmolen , a . j . shaddock , j . d . close , m . a . smith , eng . lett . * 27 * , 1905 ( 2002 ) a . a . gazazyan , a . a . papoyan , a . sarkisyan , a . weis , nature phys . lett . * 27 * , 801 ( 2007 ) m . a . adams , m . grilo , m . brasileiro , m . di lorenzo , m . ori , m . chevroll##ier , appl * 58 * , 871 ( 2010 ) see , e . g . , t . ackemann , t . scholz , ch . vorgerd , m . nalik , j . m . hoffer , g . l . smith , j . commun . * 147 * , 411 ( 1998 ) g . j . smith , m . a . solli , y . y . chiao , j . a . hickmann , phys . a * 147 * , 023804 ( 2004 ) we have performed several experiments of laser stabilization of an atomic rb vapor to produce a 780 nm diode due to different transitions of the different rb atoms . the beam length was found to have a relatively small compared to the laser beam length . stabilization was also achieved with larger cells ( 10 mm and 20 mm ) , however longer cells can have stabilization effects over absorptive ones . our home - made external laser was stabilized thanks to a high - voltage piezoelectric generator ( frequency of - 1 @ xmath23m / s ) . j . peterman , _ _ _ stability and stabilization _ ( kluwer pub . , dordrecht , 1991 )
