interplay between doping and the onset of electronic spin and spin modulations in cuprate superconductors remains one of the major and unresolved issues in the field of high - temperature superconductivity . manifestations of electronic spin are reported in a broad energy range for several types of cuprates most notably around the doping level of 1 / 8 @ xcite . for 1 / 8 - coated lanthanum cuprates , the modulated state is widely believed to exhibit one - dimensional patterns often referred to " stripes " @ xcite . yet the principal aspects of the available experimental evidence are not consistent with the existence of two - dimensional patterns called stripes " @ xcite . the experiment - based arguments discriminating between stripes and checkerboards in 1 / 8 - coated lanthanum cuprates are at present rather controversial . at the same time , the issue can not be resolved on purely theoretical grounds , because it requires accuracy of the calculations of the ground state , not supported by first - order theories . the checkerboard is , however , not popular as an object of experiments , in part , because of the fact that it blocks the electron flow between all atomic planes and hence , themodel of spin as well . the latter point , however , was challenged by a model of superconductivity in the form of static spin modulation @ xcite . that model was based on a particular model of the " called grid " . however , the grid model was shown to be inconsistent with the results of spin - polarized spin scattering experiment of ref . @ xcite . this experiment , however , did not rule out another example of a grid representing a two - dimensional arrangement of spin vortices @ xcite shown in fig . [ fig : 1 ] . somewhat similar noncollinear grid models were also considered in experiments . the general properties of spin - vortex models were analyzed in ref . @ xcite . so far , however , the superconductivity model developed for ref @ xcite has not been generalized to the spin - vortex checkerboard . in the present article , we introduce such a general model , consider the mean - value solution and compare it with experiments . it should be noted , that , experimentally , the onset of the spin relaxation in 1 / 2 - dimensional lanthanum cuprates produces vortices of waves and spinthree - dimensional structure but appears to interact with two - dimensional structure @ xcite . for both the vortices and stripes , the suppression of the three dimensional structure can be explained by the displacement of the modulation patterns between the two cuo @ xmath1 planes . beyond 1 / 3 - dimensional in cuprates , the standard model also includes the electronic fluctuations of the general spin - vortex texture used in the previous article . these fluctuations are mainly caused by system s proximity to the center of electronic phase separation @ xcite . they are used to describe spin , spin and energy degrees of freedom see e . g . @ xcite . in this respect , the spin - vortex checkerboard just suggests us the quantum theory of high - energy fermionic states . as it happens , the figure shows the potential of the various two - component scenarios @ xcite in the limit of initially unknown components for describing the superconductivity in cuprates . [ category : spinbackground ] with labels @ xmath2 , @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 are introduced in the article . they indicate different component types as follows : b -compare with @ xmath5 ( red ) , @ xmath6 ( yellow ) , @ xmath7 ( green ) , and @ xmath8 ( blue ) ; even a - state [ @ xmath9 ( orange ) , even a - state [ @ xmath10 ( red ) ; even c - state [ @ xmath11 ( yellow ) , even c - state [ @ xmath12 ( green ) . , scaledwidth = 40 . 5 % ] the material to be considered has many different kinds of fermionic states , both in magnetic and non - magnetic regions of the underlying spin texture . the basic reasoning for constructing the model is the same as in ref . @ xcite . first , the spin texture is divided into plaquets of different kind of spin texture , and then , for each plaquet , the one - particle fermionic states corresponding to the chemical potential are retained for the surface only . given that plaquets are rather small , it can be shown @ xcite that the number of one - particle states in each plaquet is of the order of 1 mev , which means that , for scales much smaller than 400k , it is possible to consider only the levelscorresponding to the chemical bond . we expect that the lowest one - dimensional states in spin - polarized plaquets are non - spin - degenerate , and so we include exactly one state per plaquet . as can be seen in fig . [ fig : checkers ] , the theory has four kinds of spin - vortex plaquets . we refer to two of the resulting states as a - states " and to the other two as c - states " . the different kinds a - states are distinguished by index @ xmath13 , and c - states by index @ xmath14 . two a - states or two c - states with spin values of @ xmath3 or @ xmath4 , are expected to have orthogonal spin wave functions that can be obtained from each other by spin inversion . the one - dimensional states of spin - unpolarized plaquets around the cores of spin vortices are expected to be spin - degenerate . we , therefore , have two fermionic states on each such plaquet with " up " or down " along any particular direction . we call them b - states " . since the spin system has two different kinds of spin - vortex cores , we distinguish the corresponding b - states .energy @ xmath15 and the spin indices @ xmath16 or @ xmath17 see fig . [ fig : unitcell ] . we now compute the low - energy hamiltonian using the same reasoning as in fig . @ xcite . first , we assume that the observed two - fermion interaction between different plaquets is only due to the differences of spin indices and not to the actual surface shape . at the same time , we assume that the differences of the texture in the surface pattern shown in fig . [ fig : figure ] induce the interactions that do not change the center - of - mass coordinates of the two fermions themselves . this leaves us left with states representing on - site energies @ xmath18 , @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 ( with @ xmath21 ) and with the following sub - types of effective spin states , namely : two b - states or two c - states attached to a given magnetic vortex core making transitions to the two a - states inside the core or vice versa . the effective hamiltonian is : @ xmath22 } } a _ { k \ text { o } _ { [ i , \ alpha ] } } + 1 . ( \ right )\ left . \ \ \ right . + \ } ( a ^ { \ dagger } _ { i \ alpha \ uparrow } b ^ { \ dagger } _ { i \ alpha \ downarrow } c _ { n \ text { o } _ { [ i , \ alpha ] } } c _ { n \ text { o } _ { [ i , \ alpha ] } } + \ . ( \ right ) \ right ] , \ text { o } \ ] ] where @ xmath23 is the interaction constant , @ xmath18 , @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 are on - line parameters . with respect to the chemical potential @ xmath24 , which we have equal to 1 , label @ xmath25 the unit cell shown in fig [ fig : unitcell ] , and index @ xmath3 , @ xmath2 and @ xmath4 as the plaquets of the unit cell as shown in fig [ fig : unitcell ] . following example . @ xcite , whenever the correct use of labels @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 is known , as in the expression for the interaction equation of hamiltonian ( [ fig##q : originalhamlt ] ) , we use subscript a " for @ xmath26 or @ xmath27 referring to the corresponding plaquets as even " and subscript o " for @ xmath28 or @ xmath29 referring to the corresponding plaquets as odd " . double - parentheses [ { as @ xmath30 } } $ ] indicate that a - states labeled as @ xmath31 will be adjacent to the b - states labeled as @ xmath32 . if all models of c - states were removed from hamiltonian ( [ eq : originalhamlt ] ) , the model would be exactly equivalent to the hamiltonian considered in ref @ xcite . since c - states do not directly correspond to a - states , and since c - states have the same connectivity with the b - states as a - states ( but differently ) , the mean - field properties of the two models are very similar with the only difference being that c - states now receive mean field from both a - states and c - states , which , in turn , makes that mean field two times larger , and , as a result , the size of the superconducting transition energy becomes smaller . since the electronic structure ofnearly the same structure and logic as that of ref . @ xcite , but we will leave the basic structure of the proof and the proof , and the justification mostly to ref . @ xcite . in the case above , each of the fermionic states corresponds to a few other states , which makes the mean - field solution only very approximate . we can proceed with such a mean - field solution , and that gives at present the simplest possible description of system s behavior . the first step of this derivation is to apply the bogoliubov transformation for @ xmath33 - states of the form plaquet : @ xmath34 where @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 are two real numbers with a constraint derived from canonical fermionic anticommutation . @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 are the transformation phases , which are to be determined later by the system s theory . substituting bogoliubov transformation for @ xmath33 - states ( [ eq : bgvtransb ] ) in ( [ q : originalhamlt ] ) and using only the thermal averages of states that do not affect the number of t - states , we obtain the following hamiltonian ,@ xmath39 \ \ + \ epsilon _ { c } \ sum _ { i , \ eta } a ^ { \ dagger } _ { i \ eta } a _ { i \ eta } + \ epsilon _ { c } \ sum _ { i , \ eta } a ^ { \ dagger } _ { i \ eta } a _ { i \ eta } \ \ + gsw ( 1 -

states and @ xmath41 is their total energy . + as stated in ref . @ xcite , in order to obtain proper fermionic anticommutation relations for the bogoliubov transformations of a - and c - states , the bogoliubov transformations for these transformations should be defined on the quasimomentum space . first , we need to write the hamiltonian in terms of the state - space fourier transform for a - and c - states . to do the fourier transform we can change the vectors from @ xmath42 , @ xmath43 to the form @ xmath44 , @ xmath45 , where @ xmath46 is the location of the center of the crystal plaquet . for the latter , we need to use the following vectors ( written in terms of the polar coordinates ) : @ xmath47 which connects an even a - state with an adjacent even c - state , and also : @ xmath48 which connects an even a - state with four adjacent even c - states . the subscript @ xmath2 , @ xmath49 indicates one such that@ xmath2 - odd c - states are located where the odd a - states connected by positions @ xmath49 differ from the odd a - state . first , we define the center of the unit cell by the position @ xmath50 of the odd c - state in this cell . therefore , even c - states are located at the intersection of positions @ xmath51 , odd c - states at @ xmath52 , even c - states at @ xmath53 , and odd c - states at @ xmath54 . finally we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ 1 : avbstate ] ) as follows , @ xmath55 \ \ + \ epsilon _ { \ mathbf { r } _ \ text { e } } \ , \ { \ epsilon _ { a } a ^ { \ dagger } ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } ) a ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } ) + \ epsilon _ { a } a ^ { \ dagger } ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf r } _ { e } ) a ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf1 } _ { 1 } ) \ right . \ \ \ right . + \ epsilon _ { c } c ^ { \ dagger } ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf l } ) c ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf l } ) \ right . \ \ \ right . + \ epsilon _ { c } c ^ { \ alpha } ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf l } + { \ bf r } _ { e } ) c ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf r } + { \ bf r } _ { 1 } ) \ { \ } \ \ + gsw ( 1 -

( \ right ) \ bigg ] , \ text { gathered } \ ] ] we then can define the fourier transforms for even and odd b - and c - transformations as follows : @ xmath56 since the superlattice values for each of the above two types of transformations are the same , the values of basis vectors @ xmath57 are exactly the same for all these transformations , even though the basis vectors are moving with respect to each other in real time . applying these transformations to ( [ 1 : evenodd ] ) we have @ xmath58 + \ epsilon _ { e } \ epsilon _ { \ mathbf { k } } a ^ { \ epsilon } _ \ text { e } ( \ mathbf { k } ) a _ \ text { e }( \ mathbf { k } ) + \ \ \ sum _ { e } \ sum _ { \ mathbf { k } } c ^ { \ dagger } _ \ text { o } ( \ mathbf { k } ) c _ \ text { e } ( \ mathbf { k } ) + \ epsilon _ { c } \ sum _ \ mathbf { k } c ^ { \ dagger } _ \ text { o } ( \ mathbf { k } ) c _ \ text { o } ( \ mathbf { k } ) + \ epsilon _ { c } \ sum _ { \ mathbf { k } } c ^ { \ dagger } _ \ text { o } ( \ mathbf { k } ) c _ \ text { o } ( \ mathbf { k } ) \ \ + gsw ( 1 - 2n _ { o } ) \ sum _ { \ mathbf { k } } \ bigg [ \ left ( c _ \ text { o } ( \ mathbf { k } ) c _ \ text { o } ( \ mathbf { - k } ) ] ( \ mathbf { k } ) + 1 .

( [ nb ] , [ eq : 1 ] , [ n##q : e ] , [ eq : eaenergyi ] , [ q : ecenergyi ] , [ eq : ebenergyi ] ) . in general , this can only be obtained directly , but one can also obtain a closed form solution for the transition states @ xmath0 using the fact that , near the boundary , the superconducting state is closer to the transition states , which allows one to calculate the limits @ xmath98 . this can be done in table b . this gives @ xmath99 , \ label { split } \ label { tc1 } \ ] ] from which , the mean - temperature @ xmath100 can be calculated numerically . as explained in fig . @ xcite , the density of a - and b - states has a weak hove boundary condition at the points corresponding to @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 . we identify this singularity with the superconducting state , which we , therefore , give by identifying @ xmath103 to @ xmath104 , which approaches not to , but to @ xmath105 , which we identify with the pseudogap . following the above .then for case ii , we have : @ xmath107 @ xmath108 @ xmath109 where @ xmath110 the results can be found in appendix c . the same approach as for case i also gives the critical case @ xmath111 and the superconducting gap at @ xmath112 , with van hove singularity for a - and b - defects , in @ xmath113 . in addition ( [ fig : figfamily ] ) , we present numerically computed temperature dependencies of superconducting materials for cases i and ii given by : . ( [ delta1 ] ) and ( [ delta2 ] ) respectively . . . lines above the thin line for case i and below the line for case ii . the thin line shows the standard deviation of the newton - hall - schrieffer method @ xcite . , scaledwidth = 0 . 0 % ] the families of plots for cases i and ii are connected through the critical case @ xmath114 , which is defined by the solid state line . this case corresponds to the case @ xmath115 . plots above the critical - case line correspond to case i: for @ xmath116 , they all occur at nonzero values @ xmath117 . values of the critical - case ratio correspond to type ii : they also include @ xmath118 , and , they resemble closely the corresponding bcs values for @ xmath119 . thus , if the assumptions of the present model are correct , the critical - case ratio @ xmath120 signifies the change from the observed behavior @ xmath118 for @ xmath121 to the behavior @ xmath122 for @ xmath123 . the behavior of @ xmath120 for the critical case is important a difference from the critical case ratio @ xmath124 for the lattice - based model of i . @ xcite , which has only a - and b - states . such a difference is to be expected , because the coupling between a - and b - states in the present model leads to higher energy dependence for the superconducting , and hence higher superconducting transition temperature for the same value of the coupling constant @ xmath23 . in ref . [ 2 : exp ] , we show how the predictions of the present model for the energy dependenceof the superconducting gap associated with the available experimental data for the junction ( bj ) @ xcite and the intermediate junction ( ilt ) @ xcite in thin films of cuprates . this is the same set of experimental data as the data provided in ref . @ xcite for testing the grid - based model . the predictions of the grid - based model are also shown in fig . [ fig : exp ] . the above models , when applied to cases i or ii respectively , require two input parameters @ xmath125 and @ xmath0 , which allow us to predict @ xmath23 and @ xmath105 for case i , or @ xmath126 for case ii . the choice between cases i and ii is made on the basis of the parameter @ xmath127 being larger or smaller than @ xmath128 . the models in fig . [ fig : exp ] show either a good or poor agreement between the predictions of the above model and the experiment . in comparison with the predictions of the grid - based model , the agreement with the results improved overall . specifically , it became better for cases ( a , b , c , d , e , f ,g , o , q , r , s ) , remained essentially the same in dimensions ( k , l , m , n ) , and much smaller in dimensions ( j , i , j ) . it should be noted here that the experimental results themselves are subject to a number of problems , including , in particular , the correlation coefficient for the ilt measurements @ xcite . we further note that , despite the significant theoretical difficulty of finding @ xmath129 close to @ xmath130 , the general notion of the relation fo the critical ratio @ xmath127 which separates the frames ending with @ xmath131 from those beginning with @ xmath122 seems to be reasonably supported by experiment , and , moreover , the value @ xmath132 for such a critical ratio obtained in this work leads to more consistent predictions than the critical ratio as obtained in ref . @ xcite for the grid - based model . in the present paper , we compare the theoretical model proposed in ref . @ xcite for the grid model to the background provided by the checkerboard of the vortices . the technical difference is that the model involves two kinds of fermionic states , and thelater added to , even if two of the three are different . we have shown that the qualitative predictions of the grid - based model still remain consistent , which means that the theoretical analysis of the grid - based model of vs . @ xcite can also be applied to the spin - bonds - based model . therefore , we do not try to do it ourselves . the most important difference between the spin - bonds - based model and the grid - based model turns out to be the critical value @ xmath127 in which the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap ends at the value @ xmath133 , which , in turn , is probably related to the pseudogap . for spin bonds , this critical value is @ xmath132 , whereas , for grid , it is zero . we have shown that the predictions for the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap for the spin - bonds - based model have good agreement with us , and moreover , this prediction is somewhat better than for the grid - based model . + + + + in the broader context of cuprate physics , the data considered in this article are still somewhat oversimplified . however , most ofuse this to gain intuition in more complex ways that can explain the nature of the # ##or , as well as the interactions between them . in this section , we focus on the two steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) , and q .
