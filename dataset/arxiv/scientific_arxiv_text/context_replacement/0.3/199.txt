elucidating the mechanisms responsible for electro - optic symmetry breaking is one of the most important tasks of future collider based particle physics . experimental and theoretical properties of a single higgs particle make the precision determination of the properties of higgs bosons one of the major design challenges of a linear accelerator ( lc ) . both the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) and those of extended models can be copiously produced in @ xmath0 collisions by various production methods . a large number of different decay products can be produced with different precision and different efficiency . these results allow us to determine the fundamental parameters of the higgs sector with high precision . the series of ecfa / desy workshops aims at a comprehensive analysis of the physics results , a determination of the highest precision of higgs observables as well as establishing a fruitful cross - section between theory , computer simulations and detector layout . a future photon accelerator offers also the option of photon - photon collisions from back - scattered incident light . the theoretical basis and progress of higgs physics at a photon collider is discussed extensively in these papers @ xcite . in @ xmath0 collisions , the particle higgs boson issm occurs through the higgs - strahlung process , @ xmath1 @ xcite and through the vector - production processes @ xmath2 @ xcite . the vector production cross - sections are then calculated from the electro - weak corrections at the one - loop corrections . for a recent review of the theoretical results see e . g . @ xcite . + the full one - loop corrections to the ww - fusion process have been calculated @ xcite . the radiatively coupled cross - sections for higgs - strahlung and ww - fusion are shown in fig . [ 1 : zhxsec ] . for higgs - strahlung the corrections are positive for small higgs masses and negative for large higgs masses and values of @ xmath3 . for ww - fusion the corrections are of similar size but always negative . + with the higgs boson being used for mass generation the corrections to the elementary particles are proportional to their masses : @ xmath4 , @ xmath5 . the higgs bosons decay rapidly into the most kinematically possible final state . state - of - the - art mass generation calculations including electro - weak and spin .@ xcite is used by the program hdecay @ xcite for the sm and its minimal supersymmetric model , the mssm . the ratios of the sm higgs numbers in the mssm can be also calculated with program feynhiggsdecay @ xcite . the sm higgs number ratios in the energy range relevant to the lc are shown in ref . [ 2 : hbr ] . a number of leading - order monte carlo generators exist which are commonly used for higgs calculations in @ xmath0 collisions . they include pythia @ xcite , herwig @ xcite , hzha @ xcite , comphep @ xcite , and whizard @ xcite . comphep and whizard provide the possibility of computing the complete @ xmath6 and ( in the case of whizard ) complete @ xmath7 collisions including their interaction with sm backgrounds . beamstrahlung was simulated in most analyses presented above using the parameterization circe @ xcite . the vast majority of the analyses in this article includes the simulation of complete sm collisions . the limitations of limited sample size and accuracy have been overcome by the parametric particle simulation program simdet @ xcite which is basedonly the simulation is available for the tesla detector in the tdr . a comparative study of different model generators and of different fast detector simulation programs is carried out by @ xcite . these analyses which involve detection of heavy quarks use a fast event - wise neural - network algorithm based on zvtop @ xcite which was first used at the sld detector . a fast simulation ( called @ xcite ) of the tesla tdr detector based on geant3 along with a simulation program is available and can be used for comparative studies . the equivalent of a model - independent statistical analysis of higgs boson properties in a lc is the measurement of the total cross - section for the higgs - strahlung process , @ xmath1 . z bosons can be selected in @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 respectively . from energy - momentum conservation the invariant mass conserved against the @ xmath10 decay can be determined . from a change in the recoil mass , higgs bosons can be selected regardless of their decay energy , allowing for a model - independent measurement of the effective hz decay , @ xmath11 . once @ xmath11 is known , all the higgs couplings can be determined absolutely. the total higgs - strahlung cross - section can be determined with an accuracy of 0 . 5 % for @ xmath12 gev and @ xmath13 gev for 500 fb @ xmath14 @ xcite . assuming that the uncertainty scales with the square root of the cross - section and that the measurement time and efficiency are independent of the center - of - mass energy , one can obtain an accuracy between 1 . 2 % and 2 % for @ xmath15 gev , for an effective luminosity of @ xmath16 fb @ xmath17 gev , the center - of - mass energy corresponding to the maximum of the cross - section for a given higgs mass . the measurement procedure is shown in fig . [ fig : 1 ] , with the measured center - of - mass energy as a function of the higgs mass . the possibility of a precise and time - independent determination of @ xmath11 , e . g . , been discussed in the context of supersymmetric models @ xcite and in the context of models with higher higgs mass energies , as well as in the context of higher - energy models @ xcite . the existence of differential scattering cross - sectionsand decay energy distributions provide access to the cp quantum number of the higgs particle : @ xmath18 . in the tdr , the measurement of the @ xmath19 - value of the higgs - strahlung cross - section relative to the production threshold is used to determine the spin of the higgs particle . the spin can then be determined from the invariant mass of the off - target @ xmath10 boson in the reaction @ xmath20 for @ xmath21 . this method is independent of the higgs production threshold and it is applicable only to @ xmath22 and gg particles . the invariant mass distribution for @ xmath23 gev is shown in fig . [ 1 : hzz ] . for @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 , the interaction of the two z - decay ##s can be used to provide access to higgs boson spin and cp @ xcite . the cp quantum number , not the spin , can be determined from both higgs particle spin and cp @ xcite . in the tdr , the measurement of the angular momentum of the @ xmath10 particle against the @ xmath26 - hi##ggs - strahlung was exploited . recently a method has been proposed which makes use of the transverse energy changes in @ xmath27 decay . the spin correlations of the two @ xmath28 leptons is probed through the correlations of their decay modes . in addition , data from @ xmath29 and from @ xmath30 can be used . the angle between the decay planes of the two @ xmath31 mesons from the @ xmath28 decay provides a new observable @ xcite . while this angle can be measured in the laboratory frame , instead it is evaluated in the higgs - free frame , which can be easily reconstructed from @ xmath28 decay information @ xcite . experimental results from computer simulation have shown that from a sample of 10 million @ xmath14 of higgs - strahlung events at @ xmath32 gev , a theoretical separation between a cp - even and a cp - odd higgs state of two standard deviations may be calculated using production cross section and background , as for @ xmath33 ( see ref . [ fig : andreas ] , note that background is not always taken into account ) @ xcite . thethe measurement of higgs - decay branching ratios is one of the key tasks in lc higgs studies . in the tesla tdr as well as in all other recent lc and @ xcite experiments have been conducted to investigate the relative precisions of the branching ratio determination . for a single higgs boson with @ xmath34 gev , a wide variety of higgs decay modes can be measured . the hadronic transitions into @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 are disentangled via the optical capabilities of the lc vertex detector . progress has been made recently in the level of detail with which the methods to determine b - and c - modes are implemented into the simulation . although these studies are not complete , it is conceivable that the results of the tdr analysis will eventually be confirmed @ xcite . there are three different methods to extract branching ratios from the observed data : 1 . determine the topological cross - section for a given final event , e . g . @ xmath37 and then by the total - higgs strahlung cross - section ( events derived from the recoil energy measurements ) @ xcite . 2 . obtain a sample of unbiased @ xmath38 events ( eventsin the same region ( ) and , the fraction of events corresponding to a given @ xmath39 decay in this sample . the latter method was first applied to higgs branching in studies at @ xcite . since in this approach binomial ( or in particular multi - nomial ) statistics can be applied , smaller errors of the branching ratio can be inferred for the larger number of events than from a single sample . although only relying on events with @ xmath40 , the combination method produces results very similar to those of the tdr method @ xcite . the relative precision for the two methods for an observed higgs decay of 500 gev from a sample of 500 @ xmath41 is shown in figure [ 1 : higgsbr ] . a possible combination of these methods is currently being studied . while for the hadronic higgs decay , there is a sizable improvement , for the @ xmath42 decay a significant improvement may be expected from it . for the decays into @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 and @ xmath22 further decay modes have been studied . the very rare decay @ xmath45 might be detectable in ww - based experiments at @xmath46 gev for @ xmath12 gev . a measurement of the muon yukawa number with approximately 90 % of precision may be obtained from a sample of the particle @ xmath14 . thus , the rapid expansion of the scattering cross - section with @ xmath47 is of advantage . a direct measurement of the @ xmath45 energy ratio , can only be obtained at much higher energies and even higher energies @ xcite . the resulting result is shown in ref . [ tab : htomu ] . [ parameters = " < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > " , tag = " header " , ] [ tab : heavysusy ] since at the atomic level and in the decoupling process the first two mssm higgs particles arise from the @ xmath10 , the mass available for their production at a lc is limited to the @ xmath48 from the initial production process . it has been discussed during the workshop , how the production process could extend the energy range of an @ xmath0 lc . in particular , the ww - fusion process @ xmath49 has been investigated @xcite . its energy and cross - section is similar to @ xmath50 . depending on the susy parameters , radiative transfer can increase the cross - section for @ xmath49 , thus allowing discovery beyond the pair production kinematic model for some applications of the mssm ##s . for left - polarized electron beams and right - biased positron beams the cross - section can further be enhanced . a particular scenario where this is the case has been observed in @ xcite ( @ xmath51 350 gev , @ xmath52 gev , @ xmath53 gev and large stop mixing ) . cross - section calculations for this scenario are shown in fig . [ fig : heavymssm ] . the higgs particle can be mass - produced in the lc via @ xmath54 if @ xmath55 . a computer simulation of this process for the system @ xmath56 has been performed for @ xmath46 gev , 1 ab @ xmath14 , and @ xmath57 gev @ xcite . the resulting energy and mass are shown in fig . [ fig : hphm ] . the mass ratio is approximately 1 . 5 % . the 5@ xmath58 discovery can be achieved for @ xmath59 gev . since in pair production the maximum mass for the higgs sector is limited to @ xmath48 , also the rare case of single charged higgs production may be observed . the dominant processes for single charged higgs production are @ xmath60 , and @ xmath61 . their cross - sections have been measured at leading times at @ xcite . qcd corrections to @ xmath62 have also been measured @ xcite and are ongoing . in general , the values for which the measured cross - section exceeds 0 . 1 fb are rather low for large higgs masses above the pair production limit . cross - section contours for @ xmath63 gev and 800 gev are shown in bold . [ category : singlecharged ] . + at experimental level , the mssm higgs sector only depends on @ xmath64 and @ xmath65 . however , if @ xmath65 would be observed , @ xmath64 could in principle be uniquely determined from the observed higgs sector . in particular , the ratio of @ xmath66 to down - type fermions is directly related to @xmath64 . using this coupling which appears in the rate of the @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 processes , as well as in the total beam , @ xmath69 can be used to calculate @ xmath64 in principle . this has been studied in @ xcite . due to the large radiative corrections the predictions for the observables also depend on other susy parameters ( in particular the sfermion masses and mixings ) which are unknown in this model . thus the measurement errors ( see [ ref : tanbeta ] ) are only possible if the other susy parameters , were precisely known . a different approach to @ xmath64 , has been proposed for @ xcite . in a case where the susy particles are light compared to the center - of - mass energy , the expansion of the cross - section for the higgs field on @ xmath70 in the full tev domain can be related to the corresponding sudakov expansion of the cross - section . in particular , it has been shown , that the first term of the expansion depends only on @ xmath64 . a further study of susy parameter determination of the full mssm isis possible when measurements of the higgs sector are combined with measurements on sparticle structure . unlike the standard susy models which use specific susy parameters , higgs observables alone can lead to high uncertainty @ xcite . as an example , the nuhm ( non - universal higgs model ) model has been considered in @ xcite . the nuhm model assumes unification of sfermion masses and momentum terms as well as unification of gaugino mass terms on a large scale . however , in contrast to the msugra ( standard supergravity ) model , both @ xmath71 and @ xmath65 are independent parameters . in fig . [ 2 : cmssmsensi ] , the deviation of the ratios of the local higgs components from the scale is shown for the nuhm model as a function of @ xmath65 . the deviation is expressed in terms of standard deviations of the standard measurement error in the lc model shown in the tdr . it can be seen that in particular @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 provide high sensitivity to @ xmath65 while the sensitivity on @ xmath71 is very weak . as a caveat , thevalues of @ xmath64 as well as the other two parameters are used in this study and either have to be allowed to vary freely throughout the study or have to be fixed from above in order to convert the plotted deviations into small errors in the measured measurements . another study utilizes the ratio @ xmath74 @ xcite . at tree level , in the mssm , this ratio is constant since both the proton and @ xmath28 leptons are b - type particles , coupling proportionally to @ xmath75 to the @ xmath76 . a precise calculation of this ratio is very sensitive to the size of the radiative corrections to these two parameters . for samples at large @ xmath77 these corrections become relevant , allowing to gain access to the value of @ xmath77 itself if all the susy parameters are fixed . the ratio of @ xmath78 as a function of @ xmath77 is shown in fig . [ 1 : bbttsensi ] . + in the mssm the higgs potential is invariant under the cp transformation at tree level . however , it is possible to break cp symmetry in the higgs sector under radiativeand , provided by contributions from third order scalar - fields @ xcite . such a model is theoretically possible since it provides a possible solution to the cosmic ray problem @ xcite . in the cp even scenario the three gauge higgs bosons , h @ xmath79 , h @ xmath80 , h @ xmath81 , are components of the cp even and cp odd higgs fields . thus , they may interact to the other particles and to each other . these interactions may be very different from those of the cp odd case . in the cp even case the higgs - strahlung processes @ xmath82 ( @ xmath83 ) and pair production processes @ xmath84 ( @ xmath85 ) may also occur , with widely varying cross - sections . in a recent study , for @ xmath86 gev and @ xmath87 , the sensitivity of the measured higgs fields @ xmath88 , @ xmath89 and of the measured cross - sections for @ xmath90 to the real and imaginary part of the trilinear distribution @ xmath91 hasis observed . under the assumption that the relevant susy parameters are known , the second part of @ xmath91 may be derived from these observables @ xcite . however , further calculations are needed in order to derive cp - violating susy parameters from the higgs sector . if a single higgs particle is observed at the lhc but no additional particles are seen at the lhc or the lc , it is possible to search for small deviation of the higgs sector model from the sm model to determine the length scales . if the search for these small deviation is non - linear , at large scale @ xmath92 , the invariant mass approach can be used to parameterize the low - dimensional behavior of these operators . recently , operators of dimension six have been studied , which affect only the higgs sector and which are not easily constrained by precision electro - mechanical data @ xcite . these operators include @ xmath93 which lead to the lagrangian @ xmath94 . @ xcite , it has been shown that the parameter @ xmath95 can be measured to an accuracy of @ xmath96 corresponding to a parameter @ xmath97 tev , frommeasurement @ xmath98 of a at 500 ( 800 ) gev allows the measurement of the production cross - section from higgs - strahlung and ww / zz - measurements for @ xmath12 gev . the parameter @ xmath99 determines the form of the higgs pair and thus the higgs pair production cross - section . with the new standard model , for @ xmath12 gev , @ xmath99 can be measured to @ xmath100 at 500 ( 800 ) gev corresponding to a = @ xmath101 / tev . the possibilities for the exploration of general two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) in a lc have been discussed e . g . , @ xcite . during the 1990s , a 2hdm scenario has been discussed in which the lightest cp - violating higgs boson has become zero of the tree of distances to weak and massive gauge bosons , as in the above and the other higgs pairs are all ( @ xmath102 ) @ xcite . within the 2hdm , a tree can be constructed differently from the others in three ways : ( a ) the twolevel coupling have the opposite sign as in the sm . ( b ) either up - type or down - type coupling have opposite level coupling as in the sm . the only way to distinguish such a scenario from the sm is through loop - induced coupling , in particular through the loop - induced @ xmath103 and @ xmath104 coupling . based on @ xmath105 the effect can be strong enough to be distinguishable from the effect at the lc ( and lhc ) from higgs decay time , or at the particle collider through the @ xmath106 coupling ( see ref . [ fig : 2hdm ] ) . the expansion of a higgs singlet particle defines the minimum - to - maximum mssm ( nmssm ) . this addition is theoretically impossible , since it has a naturally small @ xmath71 parameter . if the original peccei - quinn symmetry were broken , it would lead to a massless cp violating higgs boson which is ruled out . the lc symmetry of the model depends on how far this symmetry is broken . the higgs field of the nmssm consists of three cp - even and three cp - odd gauge higgs, and the charged higgs particles . the complete lc phenomenology has recently been reviewed in @ xcite . as an example , the interactions of the neutral and charged higgs bosons and the coupling of the cp - even higgs bosons to the z are shown in fig . [ fig : nmssm ] as a function of @ xmath65 ( and as the upper left parameter of the cp - even higgs mixing constant , see @ xcite ) . it can be seen that over a large region of the configuration space , all three cp - even higgs particles would have strong couplings to the z , thus producing higgs - strahlung cross - sections at the lc . models which assume the existence of extra extra dimensions in order to explain the hierarchy between the electro - optic and the electromagnetic scale have been discussed extensively in recent years . their basic assumption is that the mere existence of gravity in our 4 - dimensional universe is a consequence of its existence in the extra dimensions . two models , that of large extra dimensions ( sm ) @ xcite and that of small extra dimensions ( rs ) @ xcite have been discussed in particular . the two models with deviations of sm , like @ xmath10##7 and @ xmath108 from the virtual interaction of beams of ( single ) @ xcite and single @ xcite kaluza - klein ( kk ) beams of gravitons , and their virtual emission modes with them , to gauge ##s @ xcite . these modes have been studied , e . g . in the tesla tdr . more recently , also the effect of extra dimensions on the higgs - phenomenology has been studied . in the add scenario , two scenarios have been analyzed : \ 1 . the modification of the quasi - large @ xmath109 decay amplitude by coupling of the # ##e with the imaginary part of the gauge / graviscalar kk decay amplitude @ xcite . in order to yield this significant modification , a large total higgs mass is required ( i . e . large @ xmath24 ) , which implies on the other hand a large center - of - mass contribution . while the graviscalar contribution also affects the size of the cross - section ( about 10 percent for @ xmath110 100 tev , @ xmath111 500 gev and 2 extra dimensions at the fundamental planck scaleof ( tev ) , a slight change of the energy distribution is expected from the spin - 2 graviton ##s . \ } . a modification of the process @ xmath112 and the addition of the process @ xmath113 which is observed at some level in the sm @ xcite . for the 100 tev lc and @ xmath111 100 gev , a slight change to @ xmath112 results in , and the distribution is stable for fundamental planck scales up to a few tev . furthermore , the cross - section for @ xmath113 exceeds 0 . 5 fb for the fundamental planck scale spin - 2 tev . 5 @ xcite , 6 for @ xmath114 . predictions for the fundamental planck scale of 8801560 ( 16402850 ) gev have been made for @ xmath110 100 ( 2000 ) gev for the extra dimensions . in the latter scenario , the influence on the higgs interactions might be even more drastic . besides the spin - 2 kk graviton ##s , graviscalar excitations , or radions , are predicted @ xcite . they are predicted to decay to sm particles through the interaction of theenergy - momentum tensor , i . e . up to the # ##r of qcd , is similar to the higgs boson . the lightest radion may in fact be faster than the standard graviton excitation and thus the discovery time for the model . higgs boson and radion also exhibit strong interactions , which leads to a discussion of both higgs boson and radion models , in particular their couplings to gauge bosons and matter . for a review of the radion sector , see e . g . @ xcite . the radion sector is described by three parameters : the strength of the radion - matter interactions described on the energy scale @ xmath115 , the energy of the radion , @ xmath116 , and the radion - higgs interaction , @ xmath117 . in fig . [ 1 : radionprop ] , the strongest couplings , of the higgs boson and the radion ( similar to those of the standard higgs model ) are given for the energy @ xmath118 tev , and the values of the radion , ( 20 , 55 , 200 gev ) as a function of @ xmat##h117 . + differences of the higgs energies from their sm counterparts are expected if there is no radion higgs mixing observed . the radion itself has energies which are reduced by a factor @ xmath119 with respect to those of the sm higgs in the case of no mixing , which requires high precision for direct observation . the sensitivity of the trilinear higgs interaction to radion mixing has been demonstrated as shown in @ xcite . + the lc method of precisely measuring the higgs branching ratios @ xmath120 and @ xmath121 has been demonstrated in @ xcite . in fig . [ fig : battaglia ] , the regions where the lc would observe less than 0 . 5 @ xmath58 % of the higgs branching ratios due to radion higgs mixing are shown together with the regions where the lhc would observe the higgs bosons . in particular the regions in which the lhc would be sensitive to the higgs interactions are not covered by the lc . a study of the sensitivity of the ww - w interaction to radion mixing has also been presented at the workshop @ xcite . the higgs interaction with w -and it will most likely be discovered at the large hadron ##ic lhc . in recent years , the potential of the lhc to make measurements of higgs boson interactions has been explored . for a recent review of the atlas project , see @ xcite . in most cases the capabilities of a lc are superior to those of the lhc as far as higgs physics is concerned . in particular , _ only model - independent measurements of higgs field couplings are made at the lhc . however , there are cases where the performance of the lc is significant and important . examples are in the determination of the effective yukawa mass , in the mass distribution for the susy higgs bosons , and in lhc measurements of second order squark particles in order to determine the existence of a supersymmetric higgs sector . these examples have also been worked out in more detail in a world - wide lhc / lc study at @ xcite . _ the precision study of higgs physics is at the core of the physics program of the large linear accelerator . in the course of the extended ecfa / desy project 2001 - 2003 this physics case has been divided into : the precision of the hihas been studied , the possibility of new theoretical models has been considered and the experimental studies of the lc experiment have been continued and improved . the results are essential for the preparation of the worldwide lc project and will be conducted both in the geographic regions africa , asia , and europe and in worldwide laboratories . in addition , the work will be in the framework of a new ecfa study . the goals of this new study are to try to incorporate new theoretical ideas and to improve the accuracy of theoretical models . on the other hand , a more detailed study of systematic limitations , impact of machine learning and the potential impact of the computer on specific physical properties is of utmost importance . i would like to warmly thank all contributors to the higgs detection group for their outstanding contribution to make the workshop a success . in particular the work of my co - convenors m . battaglia , m . djouadi , a . martin , and b . kniehl is greatly appreciated . j . a . martin , j . a . gaillard and d . a . nanopoulos , nucl . b * 106 * ( 1976 ) 292 ;
