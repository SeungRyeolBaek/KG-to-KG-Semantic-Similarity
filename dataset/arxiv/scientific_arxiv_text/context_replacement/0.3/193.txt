the object of this article is to understand some aspects of the relative motion of the elementary particles in the gravitational field of a rotating massive body . imagine , for the sake of concreteness , a massive mass @ xmath2 in orbit about the local vector of mass @ xmath3 and angular momentum @ xmath4 , where @ xmath2 , @ xmath5 and @ xmath4 are vectors . let @ xmath6 be the local vector along the path of mass @ xmath2 and @ xmath7 be a simple orthonormal coordinate system that runs # ##ed along this orbit . then @ xmath8 is the radial - velocity vector of @ xmath2 and @ xmath9 , @ xmath10 , are the spacelike coordinate systems that determine the local spatial frame of @ xmath2 . we have metric ##s that @ xmath11 = ; moreover , the signature of the metric is @ xmath12 , our metric . suppose that at @ xmath13 a probe is launched from @ xmath2 and for some time @ xmath14 the trajectory of the probe is closely monitored by observers comoving with@ xmath2 . to represent this metric in an accurate way in the context of general relativity , the non - standard fermi normal coordinate system @ xcite is indispensable because it most closely corresponds to the observations . let @ xmath15 be the normal coordinate of the path at an event @ xmath16 , then there is a normal spacelike path of length @ xmath17 that connects @ xmath16 orthogonally to the path of @ xmath2 at an event @ xmath18 with proper time @ xmath6 such that @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 , where @ xmath21 is the unit vector at @ xmath18 that is tangent to the spacelike path at @ xmath18 and perpendicular to the worldline of @ xmath2 . the metric in fermi space is defined by @ xmath22 to second order as the direction away from @ xmath2 that permanently remains at the real origin of the normal coordinates by , and has fermi coordinates @ xmath23 . then @ xmath24 is defined by @ xmath25 which is the projection of the metricthe rest of the reference frame @ xmath26 along the same worldline . the differential equation of motion of the probe relative to radius @ xmath2 can be described by the following differential equation @ xcite @ xmath27 where @ xmath28 is the angular velocity of the probe relative to @ xmath2 . the state - vector of the probe is given by @ xmath29 , where @ xmath30 can be determined from @ xmath31 since @ xmath32 is a timelike unit vector . the cylindrical coordinates are geodesic coordinates based on the orthonormal reference frame @ xmath33 that is parallel propagated along the axis of @ xmath2 . they are admissible within the cylindrical frame of radius @ xmath34 along the worldline of @ xmath2 ; that is , @ xmath35 , where @ xmath36 is a constant radius of curvature of spacetime . the definition of @ xmath36 has been discussed in detail in our recent paper on the cylindrical coordinates @ xcite . for the sake of simplicity , we limit our definition to @ xmath37 . ageneral ##ization of the gravitational geodesic is that it has a critical speed given by @ xmath38 , especially in the case of one - dimensional motion . the notion of critical speed in particle physics has been extensively reviewed in ref . we are particularly interested in the role that the critical speed @ xmath39 plays in the motion of the probe ; therefore the probe can be separated from @ xmath2 at any initial point @ xmath40 , but for simplicity we concentrate on its motion only when it is very close to the source particle @ xmath2 . to second order in @ xmath41 is the modified differential equation @ xcite @ xmath42 which describes the timelike motion of the probe when @ xmath43 for @ xmath44 , we can drop the time - dependent set of equations and ; thus , the equation in is satisfied and reduces to the differential equation @ xmath45 note that the worldline of the probe can be determined in the fermi coordinate system on the basis of equations and ; then , it is in principle possible to obtain the representation of this worldline in the background coordinate system using the same coordinate transformation between the two sets of equations . in practice , however , itis not possible in general to find exact values for these coordinates in terms of the generalized coordinates and therefore one has to resort to approximation ##s ; see ref . @ xcite for more general ##ization of this problem . nevertheless , it is important to recognize that since @ xmath46 is determined from the generalized jacobi equation ( or the jacobi equation ) , the worldline of the probe is well characterized . that is , if in the generalized coordinate system the worldline of @ xmath2 is given by @ xmath47 , then the worldline of the probe is @ xmath48 , where @ xmath49 and we have replaced the fermi temporal of @ xmath50 by @ xmath6 in the case of @ xmath51 . this also follows from the use of fermi coordinates and the fact that @ xmath52 for @ xmath53 , since the ( generalized ) jacobi equation is linear in the distance away from the reference trajectory . alternatively , @ xmath48 may be interpreted as a simple reference orbit . depending upon whether @ xmath51 is determined from the background or the generalized jacobi equation , the results of this approach may be expressed as instudy of the linear and circular motion of geodesic orbits in the background gravitational field . given the source of the gravitational field and the reference trajectory , we assume that @ xmath2 is on a stable equatorial circular geodesic orbit around the kerr source . this model for the source to some extent mirrors our earlier work on the motion of astrophysical objects @ xcite , where the reference trajectory is a circular geodesic about the rotation axis of the kerr source . the geodesics of kerr spacetime have been discussed by a number of papers ; see , for instance , ref . @ xcite and references below . the characteristics of the source and the reference trajectory will be discussed in detail in the next section . various aspects of tidal motion in black - hole spacetimes have been discussed by a number of papers ; see , for instance @ xcite and the references given below . furthermore , we treat multi - body orbits for the sake of simplicity ; the corresponding study of black - hole debris disks @ xcite is within the scope of this section . section [ s3 ] is devoted to the solution of the jacobi equation . we show in section [ s4 ] that the rotation axis in section [ s3 ] leadsto a complete transformation of the generalized jacobi equation to the autonomous equation . this equation is then analyzed in detail . finally , figure [ s5 ] contains a brief description of our problem . the spacetime domain of interest is the exterior kerr space with the coordinates @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 is the orbital angular momentum of the source . here @ xmath56 is the standard boyer - lindquist coordinates and @ xmath57 the reference trajectory is defined to be a stable circular orbit of fixed radius @ xmath58 in the equatorial plane @ xmath59 ; in terms of @ xmath58 , such orbits go from 0 all the way up to the last null circular orbits given by @ xmath60 in this paper , the minus ( right ) sign refers to orbits where @ xmath2 is in the same ( opposite ) direction as the source . for @ xmath58 less than the solution of , there are null circular orbits that are in the null circular orbit given by @ xmath61 it is convenient to define the keplerian orbit for the orbit under consideration , as @ xmath62 gives us so that with the orbital equations and , a prograde orbit becomes retrogradeand vice versa when @ xmath63 ; this circumstance explains why the symbol @ xmath64 often appears in orbital equations . we see that @ xmath65 is ; therefore , the value of @ xmath66 is the component of the orbit . it follows from the orbit equation that for the reference worldline @ xmath67 where @ xmath68 is such that the state - vectors are those of @ xmath69 and we have and also that @ xmath70 = @ xmath71 . the components of the orbit for the reference worldline are the kinetic energy @ xmath72 and the angular momentum @ xmath73 , identified respectively with the timelike and the killing vectors @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 , and respectively multiplied by @ xmath76 to form the orthonormal basis @ xmath77 , let us first consider the basis @ xmath78 generated by the two independent vectors in the exterior kerr spacetime . in the complex plane and in terms of @ xmath79 , the corresponding orthonormal basis ofthese changes in the coordinate system are given by @ xmath80 where @ xmath81 is , we convert this particle to a coordinate system with coordinates @ xmath82 , @ xmath83 , so that @ xmath84 is the unit vector perpendicular to the worldline of the new particle @ xmath2 . the corresponding orthonormal vector in the direction of @ xmath2 is @ xmath85 , \ quad \ text { \ beta } ^ \ mu _ { ( 3 ) } = \ lambda ^ \ mu _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( 3 ) } , \ \ \ text { eq19 } \ text { \ beta } ^ \ mu _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( 3 ) } = \ lambda ^ \ mu _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( 3 ) } , \ quad \ text { \ beta } ^ \ mu _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( 3 ) } = \ text { \ beta } [ \ lambda ^ \ mu _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( 3 ) } + \ text { \ beta } \ gamma ^\ sum _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( x ) } ] , \ sum { 0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath86 is the scale factor corresponding to @ xmath82 . we know from @ xmath87 that the lorentz pair @ xmath88 is given by @ xmath89 ##1 , @ xmath90 is positive ( positive ) for prograde ( null ) orbits ; therefore , @ xmath91 is for the null orbits ( @ xmath69 ) . the spatial orientation of @ xmath92 is along the three spatial coordinate axes , which are the radial , angular and radial directions with respect to the orbit , and it needs to be shifted , so that the resulting tetrad would then be freely rotated along the axis as shown in figure [ 1 : 1 ] . from @ xmath93 it follows from the value of the time derivative of @ xmath94 at the orbit that @ xmath95 where we have is the integration factor and that @ xmath96 = @ xmath13 . note that @ xmath97 , which , tothen the matrices @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 can be written as @ xmath100 that is , the difference between these angles is due to a combination of gravitational and gravitomagnetic forces . the corresponding equation for the reference frame in @ xmath101 , is a @ xmath102 finally , we want to express the motion of the unit sphere along the axis of this reference frame as an equation . the result may be written as a @ xmath103 and @ xmath104 , where @ xmath105 and @ xmath106 are vectors that belong to the matrix @ xmath107 . this matrix has the form @ xmath108 , \ ] ] where @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 are @ xmath111 symmetric and traceless vectors representing respectively the electric and magnetic components of the metric tensor . it turns out that in the case under consideration @ xmath112 , \ qquad \ mathcal { 0 } = \ right \ left [ \ math { 0 } { 0 } 0 & h & 0 \ \ h &[ & h ' \ \ 0 & h ' & \ \ [ { array } \ [ ] , \ ] ] where @ xmath113 the value @ xmath114 is given on the basis of the relationship with newtonian mechanics . thus , @ xmath115 is positive and is given by @ xmath116 , and @ xmath117 , @ xmath118 form a positive linear transformation , i . e . @ xmath119 , given by @ xmath120 which reduces to @ xmath121 with the schwarzschild transformation @ xmath122 ; however , @ xmath123 is not the critical point ( @ xmath124 . let us assume that for the values under consideration and @ xmath125 , @ xmath126 $ ] ; that is , @ xmath127 is positive ( negative ) for a prograde ( retrograde ) orbit and , from the limit ( @ xmath128 ) , @ xmath129 , so that @ xmath130 increases @ xmath131 , and @ xmath132 monotonically increasesfrom zero to @ xmath133 at the last two circular orbits . similarly , for @ xmath134 , @ xmath127 is always positive for retrograde orbits , but it is not always positive for prograde orbits ; in fact , @ xmath127 vanishes for a prograde orbit with radius @ xmath135 . these two results can then be used for calculations and to determine the motion of the earth relative to @ xmath2 . it should be mentioned that our results for the metric of @ xmath109 are consistent with the results of marck @ xcite . let us now return to the solution of the jacobi equation . for simplicity , we use instead of the spherical coordinates @ xmath136 , the _ dimensionless _ spherical coordinates @ xmath137 , @ xmath138 where @ xmath139 . the resulting equation now takes the form @ xmath140 = : \ right [ \ begin { array } { cc } 3 \ \ z \ begin { array } \ right ] , \ qquad c = \ left [ \ begin { array } { cc } 3 \ right ^ 2 \ right ^2 \ eta - 1 & 3 \ gamma ^ 2 \ sin \ eta \ 3 \ eta \ \ 3 \ gamma ^ 2 \ sin \ 3 \ 3 \ eta & 3 \ gamma ^ 2 \ sin ^ 2 \ eta - 1 \ begin { array } \ [ ] , \ \ \ label { eq36 } \ frac { d ^ 2y } { d \ gamma ^ 2 } + \ gamma ^ 2 y = 0 , \ qquad \ eta = \ sqrt { d \ gamma ^ 2 - 1 } . \ begin { array } \ ] ] thus applied to the equatorial plane , we have a mean relative motion of : @ xmath141 , where @ xmath142 ranges from unity to @ xmath143 for @ xmath125 ; that is , it ranges monotonically from unity at @ xmath144 to @ xmath143 at the most stable circular motion . the equations of relative motion in the equatorial plane can be transformed into an explicit form by a transformation to the radial and angular directions ( etc . ) . that is , : @ xmath145 = r \ left [ \ begin { array } { array } ] \ \[ \ begin { array } \ right ] , \ qquad \ = \ , [ \ begin { array } { z } \ sin \ eta & \ sin \ eta \ \ - \ sin \ eta & \ sin \ sin \ end { array } \ right ] . \ ] ] similarly , this applies to the local system @ xmath146 where an overdot allows differentiation with respect to @ xmath147 . note that , @ xmath148 , @ xmath149 and the angular momentum of the system @ xmath150 have components @ xmath151 in the local @ xmath152 system , we have @ xmath153 , \ \ \ label { eq41 } , = \ frac { 4 } { \ sigma } v _ 0 \ sin \ vartheta \ sin \ sin \ eta , \ \ \ label { eq42 } \ eta = - \ frac { v _ 0 \ sin \ vartheta } { \ lambda ^ 2 } [ ( 1 \ lambda ^ 2 \ gamma - \ frac { 4 } { \ sigma } \ sin \ sin \ eta ) \ sin \ varphi + 2 ( 1- \ cos \ lambda \ ( ) \ cos \ varphi ] , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath154 . we find that @ xmath155 , since @ xmath156 so that for @ xmath125 , @ xmath157 decreases from zero to unity ; that is , it decreases monotonically from zero for @ xmath144 to zero for the last stable circular orbit . if the reference orbit is one of the last stable circular orbits , then @ xmath158 , @ xmath159 are given by with @ xmath160 and @ xmath161 . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] using the terms @ xmath37 and @ xmath44 , which in this case correspond to @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 , we find that the system of , , and is linear in time due to the motion of the particles . it is important to note that solutions that appear in the solution of the differential equation have time and with the time @ xmath164 and frequency @ xmath165 with respect to the coordinate system @ xmath166; to the frequency in @ xmath167 and with @ xmath168 , the deviation of this frequency from the keplerian limit corresponds to the einstein ##ian frequency for an orbit of small radius , while the first - order deviation of @ xmath169 corresponds to the de sitter - einstein - thirring ##e frequency @ xcite . therefore , a discussion is in order here regarding the initial position that @ xmath170 at @ xmath171 , which corresponds to our assumption that the probe is being launched from @ xmath2 . in particular , it is not assumed that the probe is near the launch point @ xmath2 , so that @ xmath41 will be considered very small compared to @ xmath34 ; for the sake of simplicity , we choose @ xmath172 throughout this paper . this means that in terms of @ xmath173 , we always assume that @ xmath174 the reduction of the above equation to the autonomous case is straightforward due to the assumption that @ xmath175 , where @ xmath176 is a rotation constant . it then takes the form @ xmath177 =r \ left [ \ begin { array } { c } \ left \ \ \ left \ end { array } \ right ] , \ ] ] which is related to system . the transformation from @ xmath178 to @ xmath179 is a transformation from the local reference frame to rotating axes ; therefore , in general we see the presence of coriolis and kerr terms on the left - hand side of this transformation . moreover , this transformation is related to ' s contributions to the kerr many - body theory @ xcite ; thus , system in the upper limit @ xmath180 is equivalent to a special case of the hill equation given in ref . @ xcite , and , system of ref . @ xcite with @ xmath181 . it can be shown , with much algebra , that under the same conditions as the system , the nonlinear generalized jacobi equation can be rendered nonlinear as well . this latter case is related to the special case of the kerr spacetime @ xcite . introducing @ xmath182 and @ xmath183 , where @ xmath184 = r \ left [ \ begin { array } { c } \ end { x } \\ \ dot { align } \ end { aligned } \ right ] , \ end { align } \ ] ] we find that @ xmath185 , @ xmath186 , and @ xmath187 + 1 \ alpha ^ 2 \ beta \ alpha \ delta _ \ xi \ nonumber \ \ - 2 \ big ( \ gamma ^ 2 \ beta \ alpha ^ 2 _ \ xi - \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ alpha ^ 2 \ delta _ \ xi \ big ) ( \ beta \ delta _ \ xi - \ beta \ delta _ \ big ) + # ##x \ dot { 1 } \ delta _ \ xi \ big ( \ gamma ^ 2 \ beta \ delta _ \ xi + \ sigma ^ 2 - \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ big ) \ nonumber \ \ - 2 \ dot { align } ^ 2 \ big ( \ gamma ^ 2 \ beta \ beta \ delta _ \ xi - \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ alpha \ big ) , \ dot { eq48 } \ \ \ , \ ddot { y } + \ sigma ^ 2 ( \ - 2 \ dot { 1 } ^ 2 ) x = \ frac { 1} { 1 } ] [ \ delta ^ 2 _ \ xi - ( \ sigma ^ 2 + 1 ) \ delta ^ 2 _ \ xi - 2 \ gamma ^ 2 \ alpha \ delta _ \ xi ] - 3 \ dot { y } \ alpha [ \ delta ^ 2 \ alpha \ delta _ \ big ( \ xi \ delta _ \ xi - \ zeta \ delta _ \ xi ) \ nonumber \ \ + \ alpha ( 3 \ delta ^ 2 - \ frac { 2 } { 3 } \ big ) \ alpha \ delta _ \ xi - \ alpha ( \ sigma ^ 2 + \ frac { 2 } { 3 } \ big ) \ zeta \ delta _ \ xi \ big ] + 3 \ alpha ^ 2 \ alpha \ dot { y } ^ 2 ( 3 \ delta _ \ zeta - \ zeta \ dot { y } ) , \ text { eq49 } \ \ \ , \ ddot { \ alpha } + 3 \ dot { \ gamma } = 3 \ delta _ \ xi [ \ xi \ delta _ \ xi - ( \ sigma ^ 2 + 1 ) \ alpha \ delta _ \ xi ] - 3 \ gamma ^ 2 \ alpha \ alpha \ delta _ \ xi - 3 \ delta _\ left \ left ( \ sigma ^ 2 \ beta \ delta _ \ zeta + \ frac { 2 } { 3 } \ gamma ^ 2 \ big ) ( \ beta \ delta _ \ zeta - \ beta \ delta _ \ xi ) \ nonumber \ \ + \ frac { 2 } { 3 } ( \ sigma ^ 2 + 1 ) \ , \ ( y \ delta _ \ zeta - \ zeta \ dot { y } ) + 2y \ dot { y } [ \ sigma ^ 2 \ beta ( \ gamma ^ 2 _ \ zeta + 1 ) + \ sigma ^ 2 \ delta _ \ zeta ] - [ \ gamma ^ 2 \ beta \ dot { y } ^ 2 \ beta \ delta _ \ xi . \ begin { eq50 } \ { { \ } \ ] ] ) with the standard form of the above identity and the new solution , it is possible to obtain a solution of it via the following taylor expansion in terms of @ xmath188 . however , the solution of such a differential equation , based on the tidal parameter @ xmath189 , should be used only in conjunction with the second - order differential equations that exist , those that have been neglectedin the case of the gravitational field in , and would result in terms in the equation of motion that go to the linear solution of @ xmath41 . it follows from this , , and that the trajectory of the probe in boyer - lindquist coordinates , @ xmath190 , is given by @ xmath191 , @ xmath192 , @ xmath193 and @ xmath194 from the ( generalized ) kerr equation and by @ xmath195 and @ xmath196 , we can determine the trajectory of the probe using the generalized kerr equation system . this is due to the fact that the generalized kerr equation is linear in the direction @ xmath197 ##2 from the reference geodesic ; therefore , @ xmath198 can be viewed as the generalized jacobi equation that is linear along the reference geodesic . it turns out that for large - scale ( @ xmath199 ) , the linear ( @ xmath200 ) and circular ( @ xmath159 ) motions in space contain the fundamental and fundamental equations @ xmath201 and @ xmath202 , respectively .the above system of equations then transforms into equations for the vertical and horizontal motions . that is , if the probe is launched only in the @ xmath159 plane , then its motion will be restricted to the @ xmath159 plane according to the generalized jacobi equation . however , if the probe is launched in the orbital @ xmath203 plane , then the probe will remain in this plane throughout its motion . if the probe is launched in the same vertical direction relative to the equatorial orbit , then @ xmath204 for all @ xmath147 and hence the equations of motion reduce to @ xmath205 the vertical motion is not uniform for @ xmath206 ; that is , it is the maximum for @ xmath207 beyond which the character of the motion is restricted to the low - speed limit that corresponds with the expectations . if the probe is launched with @ xmath208 , then it will begin to decelerate in accordance with its gravity . however , for @ xmath209 , the probe will accelerate , as described in equations in @ xcite . in fact , the vertical motion can be described exactly @ xcite , since equation implies that @ xmat##h210 whose motion can be described by quadrature . this solution represents timelike geodesic . if the following condition is satisfied @ xmath211 for @ xmath212 , it is also true and it follows from that the motion of @ xmath159 is slow and confined to the [ @ xmath213 $ ] , where @ xmath214 on the other hand , for @ xmath215 the particle is accelerated to ( roughly ) the absolute speed of light . in this way , the particle has enormous tidal energy . according to einstein , the range of @ xmath159 in which this occurs monotonically shrinks to zero as @ xmath189 approaches infinity . the question of the choice of local coordinates in such a case is a difficult one ; an unsuccessful attempt to answer such a question is contained in our recent article @ xcite . it is essential for astrophysical applications to connect these local coordinates to what distant observers would measure @ xcite . first , the gravitational potential energy of particles in the fermi coordinate system can be transferred to the outside world ( i . e . beyond the fermi level ) by collisions with other particles and emission of radiation .from our previous work on tidal acceleration about a constant angular velocity along the axis of rotation of the central body @ xcite , we found that for all speeds above the critical speed @ xmath216 , tidal _ acceleration _ occurs in a cone of about @ xmath217 measured from the rotation axis , where @ xmath217 is displaced by @ xmath218 and corresponds to an angle of about @ xmath219 , and tidal _ acceleration _ occurs outside this cone , i . e . in the complement of the angular - velocity cone at distance from @ xmath220 to @ xmath221 , where @ xmath222 and corresponds to an angle of about @ xmath223 . based on these previous results , we conclude that in the present situation the effect of tidal acceleration for speeds above the critical speed will not be restricted to the rotation axis alone . to address this issue in the case under consideration , we have solved the full set of equations with initial conditions . our results show that tidal acceleration either parallel or perpendicular to the kerr rotation axis occurs when the spacecraft is launched with @ xmath224 in a direction @ xmath225 , wherefor a given @ xmath226 , @ xmath227 is restricted to a certain value , namely , @ xmath228 . to clarify the situation analytically , let us first note that if @ xmath229 is a system of equations , then so is @ xmath230 . in particular , it is also invariant under the kerr equation @ xmath231 ; however , vertical acceleration is expected to behave differently with respect to the equatorial plane . for this reason , we limit our solution to @ xmath232 , which corresponds to being antiparallel to the kerr equation by our convention ( see equation [ 1 : 2 ] ) . finally , let us note that with these conditions , vertical acceleration vanishes initially , i . e . @ xmath233 = @ xmath234 ; therefore , it is possible to compute @ xmath235 kerr equation . it turns out that @ xmath236 where @ xmath237 is a quadratic solution of @ xmath238 given by @ xmath239 here @ xmath240 , @ xmath241 and @ xmath242 are given by @xmath243 for @ xmath244 , @ xmath235 and positive for @ xmath224 ; in fact , this is the case for the extended domain of the kerr radius . the boundary of this domain is given by @ xmath245 , i . e . @ xmath246 , by @ xmath247 and @ xmath248 ( i . e . @ xmath249 ) , where @ xmath235 is , as shown in figure [ fig : 1 . 4 ] , where @ xmath250 and @ xmath251 . let us recall that for a prograde circular orbit of the @ xmath58 around a kerr black hole , @ xmath127 decreases monotonically from zero at @ xmath252 to @ xmath253 at the most stable circular orbit . for a fixed @ xmath254 $ ] and @ xmath209 , the non - acceleration domain decreases to @ xmath255 . on the other hand , for a fixed @ xmath256 , the acceleration domain in figure [ fig : 1 . 5 ] is practically the same as@ xmath257 . for @ xmath130 , however , the shape of the domain changes significantly . in fact , for @ xmath258 , it follows from equation that @ xmath259 , where @ xmath260 defined by @ xmath261 is a positive constant such that @ xmath262 . therefore , the velocity vector in this case lies at the intersection of the vertical axis defined by @ xmath263 , where @ xmath264 and @ xmath265 , and the circle of unit radius centered at the intersection of @ xmath266 coordinates . though we have chosen a perfectly circular planetary system as the reference frame in this case , it is still difficult to imagine that the tidal acceleration ##s described above within the context of the formation of an accretion disk about the source could also contribute to the formation of double jets . moreover , tidal acceleration varies symmetrically with respect to the long plane of the kerr disk . this feature would be consistent with the possible occurrence of double jets , namely , a pair of relativistic outflows in opposite directions along the long axis of the kerr disk . if @ xmath267 for which @xmath147 , . the motion is confined to the @ xmath268 plane and represents a timelike geodesic if @ xmath269 a solution of the generalized differential equation ( gje ) in the @ xmath270 plane is given by the terms @ xmath127 , @ xmath189 and @ xmath271 . for @ xmath189 extremely large compared to 1 , the solution of the gje is given exactly by the same solution of the differential equation described in the previous section . in particular , as @ xmath189 slowly increases toward 1 , the influence of the secular terms in the gje can not be ignored . in particular , since @ xmath272 of the differential equation contains a secular term , namely , @ xmath273 with @ xmath274 , the solution of the gje in general increases rapidly and leaves the normal direction of the fermi ##onic system . this problem can be solved , however , in the case of the two radial variations with @ xmath275 or @ xmath276 ; in either case , the differential equation has multiple solutions due to the influence of thecircular reference orbits with small radial perturbations . the solution of the gje can also involve quasi - periodic oscillations exhibiting a heart beat phenomenon involving several particles as demonstrated in figure [ fig : 2 ] . however , such effects appear to exist only for @ xmath277 , in which case they are probably not exact solutions , since higher - order tidal terms of comparable magnitude have been neglected in our analysis . even if a quasi - periodic effect of the frequency shown in figure [ fig : 2 ] requires the consideration of relevant higher - order tidal terms , the amplitude of the effect may not be large enough to be of any real value in comparison with the observed quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) @ xcite . we have studied the generalized jacobi equation for a circular reference geodesic orbit in the equatorial plane of the exterior kerr spacetime . this system has been reduced to an autonomous system ; the corresponding orbital motion can then be further divided into vertical and horizontal motions relative to the circular orbit . in connection with this motion , we have clarified the role of the rotational speed @ xmath207 in the character of the solution of the generalized kerr equation . the general approach taken in this workmay be of interest in connection with the design of a space station , the tracking of artificial satellites , as well as satellite - to - satellite doppler tracking . moreover , in connection with the relativistic properties of accretion disks around ( massive ) celestial objects , our results may be relevant for the gravitational aspects of the complex plasma physics that would be involved in the creation of high - energy plasma @ xcite . that is , the vertical # ##s explored in this work may be related to how plasma flows are started in and around an expanding disk around a kerr black hole . since the flows are completely confined to points along the axis of rotation of the central core , the results of the experiments @ xcite involving the effects of ultrarelativistic sources would have to be taken into account for the radial and gravitational effects along the kerr rotation axis . xx synge j l 1960 _ relativity : the new physics _ ( amsterdam : north - holland ) chicone c and mashhoon b 2002 _ int . quantum grav . _ * 4231 chicone c and mashhoon b 2005 _ preprint _ gr - qc / 0511129 mashhoon b 2005 _ int .j . mod . * 13 * 2025 chicone c and mashhoon b 2005 _ ann .
