multiscale dynamics is used in many fields , e . g . , engineering @ xcite , physics @ xcite , geosciences @ xcite , etc , to name a few . it has been shown in many multiscale dynamics systems that the self - similarity is important , in which the concept of multiscaling or multifractal is used @ xcite . this is done conventionally by calculating the time - scale ( sfs ) , i . e . , @ xmath10 , in which @ xmath11 is an increment with the scale @ xmath2 . note that for the self - similarity process , e . g . , fast brownian motion ( fbm ) , the scale @ xmath0 is linear with @ xmath12 . but for the multifractal process , e . g . , angular velocity , it is usually convex with @ xmath12 . other methods are available to calculate the scale exponent . for example , fourier transform methods , ( e . g . , wavelet leaders , wavelet transform , and @ xcite ) , phase - space method @ xcite , or the scaling analysis of the density function of the increm##ents @ xcite , to name a few . the method has its own advantages and shortcomings . for example , the classical sfs is used to obtain estimates of the large - ( resp . known as infrared effect ) and small - scale ( resp . known as ultraviolet effect ) structures @ xcite . the local correlation of @ xmath0 is strongly biased when a large energetic structure is present @ xcite . however the influence of the large - scale structure has been studied extensively by several authors @ xcite . for example , praskvosky et al . , @ xcite found strong correlations between the large scales and the classical sfs at large - scales . sreenivasan & stolovitzky @ xcite found that the inertial components of the sfs conditioned by the large scale structure show a strong correlation . huang et al . , @ xcite found also that the influence of the large - scale structure could be as much as several decades down to the small scale . blum et al . , @ xcite studied also the nonuniversal small - scale structure , using both the eulerian and lagrangian sfs . they found that both sfs depend on the strength of the- of structures at all scales . in their paper , the large - scale structure velocity is defined as floating - point values , i . e . , @ xmath13 / 2 $ ] , of which @ xmath14 is the structure velocity of their experimental apparatus . note that they conditioned sfs on all scales of @ xmath15 . later , blum et al . , @ xcite investigated systematically the large - scale structure velocity sfs for different turbulent flows . they found that in all turbulent flows the velocity sfs depends only on large - scale structures at all scales . in this paper , a detrended structure - based ( dsf ) method was used to calculate the exponents @ xmath0 . this is accomplished by removing a @ xmath1st - order polynomial and a polynomial size @ xmath2 before calculating the velocity increment . this method is known as detrending analysis ( da ) . by doing so , structures larger than @ xmath2 , i . e . , @ xmath3 , are expected to be removed or added . hence , the da acts as a low - pass filter in the system . however , the da is not linear . the velocity inc##rement @ xmath16 is then defined as the window of @ xmath2 . a @ xmath12th - order version of @ xmath16 is introduced as @ xmath12th - order dsf . the dsf is then obtained by using a linear time brownian motion ( fbm ) and a lognormal model with an intermittent spectrum @ xmath17 respectively for mono - linear and multifractal processes . it is assumed that dsfs have the scaling exponents @ xmath0 and the range @ xmath4 with the values predicted by the original sfs . when applied to a relative model with a real number @ xmath18 , the @ xmath19rd - order dsf has a clear maximum range @ xmath7 , which is consistent with the one predicted by the intermittent power spectrum @ xmath20 , e . g . , @ xmath8 . moreover , the maximum value of the @ xmath19rd - order dsf is @ xmath21 . this result is consistent with the corresponding kolmogorov three - power law . the directly related scaling exponents @ xmath0( resp . the spectrum @ xmath4 ) works equally well with the lognormal model with an independent signal @ xmath9 . due to the large - scale scattering , known as infrared scattering , the sfs are large . note that the scaling exponents are calculated directly without resorting to the extended - sequence - similarity ( arc ) method . the method is versatile and could be applied to many types of data , for which the multiscale and multifractal methods are used . we start here with the scaling of @ xmath22 , which is a power - law transform spectrum , i . e . , @ xmath23 in which @ xmath24 is the scaling exponent of @ xmath25 . the parseval # ##1 states the following formula , i . e . , @ xmath26 in which @ xmath27 is the size , @ xmath25 is the fourier transform spectrum of @ xmath22 @ xcite . we first partition the data @ xmath22 into @ xmath28 segments with unit length @ xmath2 each . the @ xmath29th - the detrending of the @ xmath30thit is defined as , i . e . , @ xmath31 in which @ xmath32 is the @ xmath29th - order polynomial fitting of the @ xmath33 . we look here only for the first - order detrending , i . e . , @ xmath34 . to remove the detrended data , i . e . , @ xmath35 $ ] , the linear code is removed within the range of @ xmath2 . thus , values larger than @ xmath2 , i . e . , @ xmath36 are removed or constrained from the original data @ xmath22 . this implies that the da procedure is a high - pass filter in the frequency domain . the shannon entropy of @ xmath37 is associated only with the fourier power spectrum , i . e . , @ xmath38 in which @ xmath39 and @ xmath40 are the fourier power spectrum of @ xmath37 . this implies again that the da procedure is a high - pass filter , in which the two fourier components @ xmath41 ( resp . @ xmath36 ) are expected to be removed or constrained . for the da process , the. e . , @ xmath42 , it has a power - law form , i . e . , @ xmath43 the physical meaning of @ xmath44 is very simple . it represents the specific energy in the fourier wavenumber band @ xmath45 $ ] ( resp . scale [ @ xmath46 $ ] ) . we note here , that the sf acts as a first - order filter in physical domain and the intermittency nature of @ xmath22 is still retained . the authors used detrending techniques to remove / constrain the small - scale effect , known as structure effect . this could be used to redefine the sf to remove / reduce the large - scale structure effect as well . using the da procedure , , the velocity function can be defined as a function of @ xmath2 , , i . e . , @ xmath47 in which @ xmath30 stands for the @ xmath30th segment . we will show in the next section how we define an sf with a half length of the same length . a @ xmath12th - segment dsf is then defined as , i . e . ,@ xmath48 for a small parameter , we assume a power - law behavior , i . e . , @ xmath49 in which the scaling of @ xmath0 is comparable with the one assumed by the original sfs . to access negative parts of @ xmath12 ( resp . the negative part of the singularity of @ xmath4 , see table below ) , the dsfs can be redefined as , i . e . , @ xmath50 in which @ xmath51 is # ##ized for the @ xmath30th parameter . a power - law behavior is assumed , i . e . , @ xmath52 . it is found experimentally that when @ xmath53 , viz . ( [ f : dsf ] ) and ( [ eq : rdsf ] ) have the same scaling exponents @ xmath0 . in the literature we do not use these two methods for dsfs . for small parameters : structure - function @ xmath54 ( solid line ) , second - order detrending function @ xmath55 ( thin solid line ) , and the detrended structure - function @ xmath56 (vertical solid line ) . the detrended scale @ xmath2 is defined on a vertical solid line with @ xmath39 . ideally , scales larger than @ xmath2 , i . e . , @ xmath57 ( resp . @ xmath41 ) are able to be produced by the detrending process . ] to understand better the filter properties of the detrending scale and dsfs , we introduce : a weight function @ xmath58 , i . e . , @ xmath59 for which @ xmath25 is the fourier - series of @ xmath22 , and @ xmath60 is the second - order moment , which could be functions of @ xmath44 or @ xmath61 , or @ xmath62 , respectively . the weight function @ xmath58 is the ratio of the second order to the corresponding second - order moment . note that the additional constant is not in the expression . ( [ see : below ] ) . for the second - order sfs , one has the following weight function @ xcite , i . e . , @ xmath63 for the following process , one also has a linear decay##ing the latter , i . e . @ xmath42 with @ xmath64 . hence , the contribution from large - scale ( resp . high wavenumber fourier transform ) is smaller . the sfs will be further complicated by the large - scale contribution for large scale of @ xmath24 @ xcite . for the detrended data , the same weight function is used to represent as the following , i . e . , @ xmath65 the dsfs ( resp . the combination of the ms and sf ) of the weight function , i . e . , @ xmath66 . with the same sfs , the dsfs defined above will remove / constrain the large - scale part . figure [ fig : 1 ] shows the corresponding @ xmath58 for the sf , detrending data , and dsf , respectively . the detrended data @ xmath2 is represented by a straight line , i . e . , @ xmath39 . we note here that with the definition of vs . ( [ fig : dvi ] ) , @ xmath61 has a better linear relationship with the fourier transform spectrum @ xmath25 since we have @ xmat##h67 . this is the main reason why we define the error spectrum with the minimum size of the window width @ xmath2 . we provide some comments in eq . ( [ e : weight ] ) . the above definition is only valid for real and stationary data . in reality , the data is both stationary and nonstationary for some reasons , see the details in ref . @ xcite . however , ref . ( [ e : weight ] ) holds approximately for real data . another definition needs to be added : for the detrending method . different approaches might be used to remove the trend @ xcite . however , the trend might be linear or nonlinear . therefore , different detrending methods might have different results . in the present case , we should use the @ xmath1st - the standard detrending method , which is valid for many types of data . for fractional brownian motion with @ xmath68 on the range @ xmath69 . the inset shows the error spectrum @ xmath70 on the range @ xmath71 . the errorbar is the standard deviation estimated from 100 % . ideally , one should use @ xmath72and @ xmath73 . both methods provide the parameters @ xmath74 and @ xmath4 and statistical error . ] for the lognormal process with an unknown parameter @ xmath17 . the errorbar is the smallest deviation from the previous realizations . the statistical error curve is represented by a straight line . both methods provide the same singularity for @ xmath4 and statistical error . ] we first consider here the fractional brownian motion as a typical mono - scale process . fbm is a gaussian non - similar process with a normal distribution of , which is characterized by @ xmath75 , a hurst number @ xmath76 @ xcite . a wood - chan algorithm is used to approximate the fbm with a hurst number @ xmath68 . we perform the scaling with a maximum of @ xmath77 instead of . power - law behavior is observed at a large - range of scales for @ xmath78 . the corresponding maximum value is , i . e . , @ xmath79 if , we should have a minimum point of the spectrum with @ xmath72 and @ xmat##h73 . however , in practice , the measured singularity spectrum @ xmath4 is always lying on a narrow range . figure [ 1 : fbm ] shows the measured peak spectra @ xmath4 for sfs ( @ xmath80 ) and dsfs ( @ xmath81 ) for @ xmath78 , in which the inset shows the peak spectra @ xmath4 estimated in the model @ xmath82 . visually , both models have the same @ xmath4 and the same standard deviation , which is defined as the standard deviation from both realizations . we now consider a multifractal random process with a lognormal statistics @ xcite . a simple discrete time process with a lognormal scale is performed to produce a multifractal process @ xmath83 . the larger scale corresponds to a unique scale of values @ xmath84 , where @ xmath85 is the largest scale considered and @ xmath86 is the smallest scale ratio . in practice for a discrete process , this scale is usually expressed as @ xmath87 @ xcite . the smaller scale involved corresponds to @ xmath8##8 cells , each of which @ xmath89 . this is done and the time @ xmath90 ( @ xmath91 ) @ xmath92 cells are added . then , at each step the multifractal cascade @ xmath83 appears as the sum of @ xmath12 ##4 random variables , i . e . , @ xmath93 where @ xmath94 is the random variable corresponding to position @ xmath95 and position @ xmath28 is the cascade @ xcite . following the multifractal cascade ##ization of @ xcite , the nonstationary multifractal time series can be written as , i . e . , @ xmath96 where @ xmath97 is brownian motion . using the lognormal distribution for @ xmath98 , the scaling factor @ xmath0 for the sfs , i . e . , @ xmath99 , is given as , @ xmath100 where @ xmath101 is the scaling factor ( @ xmath102 ) characterizing the lognormal multifractal cascade @ xcite. the multifractal time series are calculated using and . ( [ eq : multitime ] ) . an additional value @ xmath17 is chosen for @ xmath103 levels each , corresponding to the number of @ xmath104 levels each . a total of three measurements are performed . the statistical error is then measured as the standard deviation from these values . figure [ 1 : wfbm ] shows the first theoretical singularity spectra @ xmath4 , in which the theoretical value is illustrated as a straight line . however , the theoretical value and @ xmath4 are recovered by different methods . the error is again shown to be the same for both estimators . we would like to make some comments on the performance of these two estimators . for the theoretical processes , they have the same performance since there is no intrinsic structure in these synthesized data . but for the experimental processes , as we mentioned above , they possess nonstationary and invariant properties @ xcite . however , as shown further below , they might have different performance . and @ xmath105 from experimental processes and nearly isotropic fluid flow . they are both 3rd - order sfs with ( @ xmat##h80 ) and without ( @ xmath81 ) absolute value , and second - order dsfs with ( @ xmath106 ) and without ( @ xmath107 ) absolute value . the horizontal horizontal line represents the kolmogorovs one - third law . an absolute plateau for @ xmath108 indicates an absolute range on the range @ xmath7 , equal to the wavenumber of @ xmath8 . roughly speaking , a plateau for @ xmath109 indicates an absolute range on the range @ xmath110 . the ranges of the measured values are : @ xmath111 ( @ xmath81 ) , @ xmath112 ( @ xmath80 ) , @ xmath113 ( @ xmath107 ) and @ xmath21 ( @ xmath106 ) , for which the statistical mean is the standard deviation ##s from the absolute value . note that the inertial mean is @ xmath110 for the sfs and @ xmath7 for the dsfs . the absolute absolute exponents @ xmath114 and @ xmat##h115 , @ xmath116 , @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 . the standard error is the 90 % of error on the standard model . ] . the errorbar is the standard deviation from 120 % . the figure shows the corresponding error parameter @ xmath0 . for comparison , the lognormal model with an error parameter @ xmath9 is illustrated by a simplified figure . ] we consider here a velocity database derived from a high reynolds number wind tunnel located in the johns - hopkins university with the parameter @ xmath18 . an instrument equipped with an x - ray - spot anemometry is used to measure the velocity with a sampling wavenumber of @ xmath119khz at streamwise direction @ xmath120 , for which @ xmath121 is the size of the active grid . these sensors are placed at the same height and along the center line of the wind tunnel to record the wind flow simultaneously for a period of 30 seconds . the process is then repeated for several minutes . finally , we have @ xmath122 data . ( number of measurements @ xmath123 number of measurements @ x##math123 ( ( @ xmath123 ) wavenumber ) . however , there are many possibilities ( number of measurements @ xmath123 number of measurements ) . the fourier transform of @ xmath20 of the measured velocity reveals a nearly one dimensional inertial range in the wavenumber range @ xmath8 with the scaling exponent @ xmath124 , see figure . this corresponds to time compensated @ xmath7 . here @ xmath125 is the kolmogorov constant . note that we convert our data into spatial coordinates by using the time frozen method @ xcite . more information about this method can be found in fig . @ xcite . to plot the time scales in real space , we use the time compensated first - order moments in fig . [ 1 : third ] for the sfs ( @ xmath126 with ( @ xmath80 ) and without ( @ xmath81 ) absolute value ) , dsfs ( @ xmath105 with ( @ xmath106 ) and without ( @ xmath107 ) absolute value ) , etc . the curved straight line between the kolmogorovsfour - fifth law . a plateau is observed for @ xmath105 on the range @ xmath7 , which corresponds very closely with the linear range predicted by @ xmath20 , i . e . , on the range @ xmath8 . the corresponding height and scaling factor are @ xmath21 with absolute value ( resp . @ xmath113 without absolute value ) and @ xmath127 ( resp . @ xmath128 ) , respectively . the standard deviation is the standard deviation calculated from the range @ xmath7 . note that the kolmogorovs four - fifth law has a linear range @ xmath129 . it is important to note that , despite of the above , we observe @ xmath130 at nearly two - decade intervals . for comparison , the second - order sfs are also observed . roughly speaking , a plateau is observed on the range @ xmath110 . this linear range is larger than the range predicted by the dimensional analysis of dsfs , which is now known as the large - scale limit . the corresponding height and scaling exponent are @ xmath111 without absolute value ( resp .@ xmath112 with the above ) and @ xmath115 ( resp . @ xmath131 ) . however , the dsfs provide a better representation of the power system since it reduces / reduces the large - scale error . we can calculate the scale factors for the @ xmath132 on the range @ xmath7 for @ xmath69 directly without resorting to the standard self - assembly method @ xcite . for the sfs , we calculate the scale factor @ xmath0 on the range @ xmath110 for @ xmath82 directly . the [ note : 1 ] shows the measured power spectra @ xmath4 for @ xmath78 , in which the errorbar shows the standard deviation from 120 realizations . the inset shows the corresponding scale exponents @ xmath0 . for example , the lognormal curve @ xmath133 with the periodic signal @ xmath9 is shown as a straight line . visually , the dsfs also automatically recovers the lognormal curve not only in the periodic part ( resp . @ xmath134 ) .shown on the right side ( resp . @ xmath135 ) . due to the large - scale contamination , the sfs underestimates the scaling exponents @ xmath0 when @ xmath134 @ xcite . this is an approximation of the theoretical part of the curve @ xmath4 ( see @ xmath80 in fig . [ fig : singularity ] ) . however , if one uses the same algorithm when calculating the sf scaling factor @ xmath0 , the observed curve spectrum @ xmath4 is simply horizontal shifted to the observed curve . this has been interpreted as that the same algorithm suppresses the finite reynolds number effect . we show here that if one removes / reduces the effect of large - scale motions , one can retrieve the scaling exponent @ xmath0 ( resp . curve spectrum @ xmath4 ) without using the same algorithm . or in other words , the finite reynolds number effect manifests in large - scale motion , which is therefore possible too . in this case , we introduce a detrended structure - function algorithm to remove / constrain the effect of large - scale motions, known as the infrared effect . in the first step of our proposal , the @ xmath1st - order velocity trend is removed with a window size @ xmath2 . by doing this , the processes larger than @ xmath2 , i . e . , @ xmath136 , are expected to be removed / constrained . in the second step , a velocity increment is defined with only half of the window size . the dsf model is given by the discrete nonlinear brownian motion for the multi - fractal process and the lognormal random walk for the multifractal process . the numerical analysis shows that the sfs and dsfs estimators have a comparable performance for synthesized processes without intrinsic structures . when applying to the turbulence data obtained from the high reynolds number wind tunnel model , the 3rd - order dsfs show a well defined trend on the scale @ xmath7 with a linear relation @ xmath137 . the turbulence model provided by dsfs is identical with the one predicted by the laser power spectrum . note that , despite of the sign , the kolmogorovs one - dimensional coefficient is zero for the 3rd - order dsfs . the corresponding 3rd -order sfs is represented by the large - scale structure , known as the kerr structure . it has a shorter inertial period and has the first - order scaling exponent @ xmath114 . the scaling exponents @ xmath0 are then estimated directly without resorting to the classical technique . the nonlinear dynamics spectrum @ xmath4 developed by the dsfs fully supports the lognormal model with an intermittent parameter @ xmath9 on the range @ xmath69 . however , the order sfs overestimate the # ##most intermittent parameters @ xmath4 ( resp . underestimate the maximum scaling parameter @ xmath0 ) on the range @ xmath138 . this has been interpreted as the reynolds number , and can be recovered by using the ess technique . here , to our knowledge , we see for the first time that if one removes / reduces the influence of the large - scale structures , one can apply the lognormal model without resort to the classical technique . the technique we use here is general and applicable to all nonlinear dynamical systems , for which the multiscale statistics are relevant . it should be also used systematicallyto more experimental velocity fluctuations with high reynolds numbers to see whether the high reynolds number flow manifests on large - scale flows as well as we look for low reynolds number turbulent flows . this project is sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china research grant ( no . 11072139 , 11032007 , 11161160554 , 11272196 , 11202122 and 11332006 ) , chang jiang university of shanghai ( no . 12pj1403500 ) , research team of shanghai municipal planning commission ( no . 11zz87 ) and the grant program for innovative research projects of universities . y . y . thanks prof . schmitt for useful comments and suggestions . we thank c . meneveau for sharing his experimental velocity data , which is available for download at c . meneveau s web page : http : / / www . cornell . jhu . edu / meneveau / datasets . html . we thank the two invited authors for their useful comments and suggestions . prof . schmitt , y . huang , y . wang , y . liu , and n . fernandez , _ dynamics of velocity fluctuations and their physical properties in the neutral zone _ _ mode _ _, j . mar . 2 ( 2009 ) , pp . 473481 . j . muzy , j . bacry , and j . arneodo , _ multifractal formalism for digital systems : the fourier -
