magneto - optical ( mo ) effects have become important applications in data storage , telecommunications , imaging , spectroscopy , @ xcite as well as in magnonics . @ xcite an increasingly important application of nanotechnologies in these fields sets new standards for making imaging devices by using , among other things , a smaller mo effect and smaller dimensions . for example , small dimensions are important for @ xmath2d imaging devices based on holographic principles . @ xcite imaging systems require a micro wave modulator ( slm ) a device used to measure amplitude , phase , and polarisation of electromagnetic waves in space and time . basically , an slm device can produce high resolution @ xmath2d images if it possesses pixels sizes @ xmath3 @ xmath1 m and also is fast enough to produce a large number of pixels in a single image frame . slm devices with mo effects have a very fast response time . however , their typical pixel sizes are @ xmath4 @ xmath1m . @ xcite at the nanoscale , mo effects can be enhanced by using subwavelength diffraction techniques @ xcite , magneto - photonic crystals , @ xcite and nano##antennas , @ xcite which are made of mixed magnetic materials or consist of mixed magnetic - semiconductor materials . however , as the typical grating period is @ xmath5 nm and there should be tens of periods to achieve good optical properties , the footprint of the antenna is small . non - photonic materials often have comparable dimensions and suffer from similar disadvantages . the footprint of ferromagnetic / mixed magnetic nanoantennas @ xcite can be much smaller than @ xmath6 @ xmath1 m because of non - plasmonic resonances which provide an extra degree of freedom for light manipulation at the nanoscale . @ xcite however , due to high absorption losses of ferromagnetic materials , plasmonic resonance ##s of these nanoantennas are not very strong as compared with nanoantennas made of gold or silver ( nonmagnetic metals with relatively low absorption losses ) . consequently , steps need to be taken to mitigate these losses , which can be done by reducing the amount of the material and tailoring fano resonance properties . @ xcite . alternatively , by experimenting with subwavelength gratings , @ x##cite losses in nanoantennas can be reduced by using nano - dielectrics instead of heavy metals . normally , magnetic plates , photonic crystals and nanoantennas are used to observe the optical rotation and kerr effect in different configurations . @ xcite for example , if the incident light is @ xmath7 - 1 and the static external magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the plane of reflection , the so - called transverse - kerr effect ( tmoke ) @ xcite is observed in the reflection mode . less well - known are transverse mo effects observed in the transmission mode . these effects are similar to the tmoke and occur in transparent magnetic plates as in @ xcite . an example of a transverse mo effect in the transmission mode is the transverse kerr effect ( tfe ) . @ xcite this effect can be observed in optics , data processing , and magnonics . the tfe has been observed in transparent magnetic plates and fabry - perot resonators . @ xcite because the tfe effect is amplified as a result of the light propagating back and forth within the magnetised medium , it is enhanced in a fabry - perot tube . however ,a typical fabry - perot resonator consists of an @ xmath8 @ xmath1m - thick layer of a transparent magnetic material sandwiched between a number of layers , which in turn consist of @ xmath9 alternating layers of high - and low - - - index half - wave - thick dielectrics . @ xcite however , the dimensions of the resonator are also very large , which makes it ideal for applications . in this way , we predict and demonstrate theoretically a large multifrequency tfe in single microspheres composed of bi @ xmath10 - thick copper - iron magnetic materials ( bi : yig ) . bi : yig is a magneto - dielectric exhibiting high mo ##tility and high absorption in the visible and infrared spectral bands . @ xcite by studying high - order factor properties of the bi : yig microsphere we predict a large tfe response at all frequencies at the same time . the strength of the predicted tfe is comparable with the strength of the tmoke in subwavelength magnetic materials . @ xcite indeed , the predicted tfe response is higher than that in sub - microhomogeneous magnetic plates . @ xcite however , the dimensions of a single sphere are significantly smaller when compared with the area covered by a subwavelength plate or the thickness of a plate used in modern mo devices . the problem of light scattering by a homogeneous sphere of arbitrary diameter and uniform permittivity is still soluble when using the mie theory . @ xcite whereas the mie theory can be extended to consider the scattering by homogeneous magnetic plates determined by their magnetic permeability @ xcite , the problem of light scattering by a sphere magnetised along a fixed radial direction is more difficult . this is because the uniform permittivity is a tensor describing the interaction between the sphere and the static external magnetic field ( or the internal magnetisation of the medium ) @ xcite @ xmath11 . considering the : yig as an isotropic material , the three diagonal elements of @ xmath12 are zero , and in the presence of a static external magnetic field along the _ y _ - axis , there is a non - zero off - diagonal element @ xmath13 , which couples the _ x _ - and _ y _ - axes of the optical magnetic field @ xmath14 leading to low optical losses in the: yig the spin index @ xmath15 and @ xmath13 of bi : yig can be assumed to be independent and therefore frequency - independent over a narrow range of wavelengths : @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 . @ xcite because bi : yig is a ferrimagnetic solid , the spin - orbit coupling is the primary mechanism of the spin interaction and this is @ xmath13 related to the magnetisation @ xmath18 of the sphere . @ xcite by considering the off - diagonal elements of @ xmath12 in the mie theory , one can take into account the physical mechanisms responsible for the mo kerr and absorption effects related to the optical properties of a sphere . @ xcite it has been shown that the mo kerr effect in a typical cobalt sphere is small but significant . @ xcite the poor optical response of cobalt spheres is due to the optical @ xcite and non - optical @ xcite absorption losses in this particular metal . these optical absorption effects are characteristic of many metals , including gold and silver . these effects have long been known to be the cause of the nanostructures used in photonic devices such as , e .e . , nanoantennas . @ xcite consequently , a large and growing body of research concerns non - dielectric nanostructures , e . g . , low - temperature all - metal nanoantennas . @ xcite in this context , the use of bi : yig as the model material of the microsphere opens new opportunities to explore the limitations of metallic ferromagnetic spheres . it is also worth noting brillouin light scattering ( bls ) from spin - wave modes in both magnetised ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic spheres . @ xcite the change of energy due to spin - wave modes causes a time - dependent change of the induced permittivity tensor @ xmath19 of the surface of the sphere . the change of the induced magnetisation to @ xmath19 allows for a model of bls in processes in which a nonlinear spin - wave mode ( magnon ) is created and maintained . in this case , bi : yig still can be used as the model material of the microsphere because bls has been used to study nonlinear spin wave modes in bi : yig systems . @ xcite however , microspheres can also be usedof the yttrium aluminium oxide ( yig ) , which is a very well - known material used in magnonics . @ xcite finally , the semiconductor and ferromagnetic properties have been observed in some of the rare earth mononitrides , which might raise interest for the possibility to investigate the use of charge carriers in spintronics . @ xcite the atomic index of these materials is @ xmath20 and they are also found in the visible and infrared spectral ranges . @ xcite most importantly , these materials also exhibit significant mo activity . @ xcite also , they might be the instead of the : yig . fig . @ xmath6 ( a ) , shows the scattering of an arbitrary , nonmagnetic sphere . by applying the mie formula for the material @ xcite we find that the intensity of the diffuse ##d light [ @ xmath21 in fig . @ xmath6 ( a ) ] has two components in the spectral range @ xmath22 , where @ xmath23 is the diameter of the sphere and @ xmath24 is the area in the surrounding space [ fig . @ xmath6 ( a ) ] . the intensity ofthe incident light ( @ xmath25 ) in this spectral range is white . this means that at the resonance the single microsphere has a very strong forward - field scattering pattern [ fig . @ xmath6 ( c ) ] . for example , in order to achieve the maximum forward - scattering intensity in the visible spectral range a bi : yig sphere with the structure @ xmath26 @ xmath1 m is needed . it is noteworthy that a nonmagnetised sphere with @ xmath27 @ xmath1 m will be in the so - called multi - stripe domain state . @ xcite basically , light will be scattered through the stripe domain state . @ xcite however , the magnitude of this effect is very small and it can be ignored , i . e . we will assume that a nonmagnetised bi : yig sphere has the optical properties of a single crystal sphere with the same refractive index . the effect of the external magnetic field acting along the _ x _ - axis [ fig . @ xmath6a ] will completely rotate the sphere by aligning the beam of light inside the sphere along the _ y _ - axis . thus , thethe saturated state the physical properties of the system can be modelled by using the tensor @ xmath12 [ vs . ( @ xmath6 ) ] . in this case , the conventional mie theory need not be used ; it can be implemented by , e . g . , a computational approach . @ xcite alternatively , approximate methods such as , e . g . , a modified quantum dipole approximation ( dda ) @ xcite may be used . however , these approaches have limitations . the uncertainty principle requires the application of the - th matrix in spherical coordinates . @ xcite the application of the dda to large mo ##s may require unaffordable computational power . @ xcite consequently , we can use a finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method . @ xcite although the fdtd method is not very demanding because it uses the best approximation of the surface of the sphere and thus requires a very fine finite - difference approximation , its application to large mie theory problems is known to yield good results . @ xcite the computational power of a simple quantum algorithm is sufficient for these simulations . however , the fdtd can be applied to scatterers with a more complex shape than the si. of course , in this case for scatterers of a given wavelength one also has to solve a micromagnetics problem to find the direction of the magnetisation of the scatterer . the solid line in fig . @ xmath28 is the forward - scattering intensity of @ xmath29 quantifying the strength of the tfe in the microsphere as a function of the average wavelength @ xmath30 . in this case , @ xmath31 is the wavelength of the forward - scattering light ( shown for example in fig . @ xmath28 in the dashed line ) and @ xmath32 is the average wavelength for bi : yig . the change in the sign of @ xmath32 is the change in the direction of the applied external magnetic field of @ xmath33 and this corresponds to the change in the sign of @ xmath13 . @ xcite recall that a similar equation @ xmath34 , with @ xmath35 the reflectivity , is used to calculate the strength of the tmoke in gratings and other electronic devices operating in the optical domain . @ xcite therefore , in contrast to all - the - # ##s##s operating at a single wavelength , @ xcite , fig . @ xmath28 the energy peaks of @ xmath36 are observed at the multiple wavelengths due to the magnetic field supported by the microsphere . we note that the peak energies of @ xmath36 are of the same order of magnitude as the peaks of @ xmath37 in the fig . @ xcite . the area of a single microsphere is much larger than the area occupied by a grating . calculate the value of the tfe in the plate as a function of the angle of incidence @ xmath38 for the wavelength of the free space @ xmath39 etc . dashed line the transmittance @ xmath40 of the nonmagnetised plate . due to the three - dimensional character of the problem , these values were obtained using the following formula for _ _ _ - polarised plates . @ xcite , [ = 321 ] to further demonstrate the advantages of the microsphere over the conventional measuring instruments used to measure transverse wave effects , we calculate the tfe in : @ xmath8 @ xmath1m - a plate made of poly : yig [ ] . @ xmath2 (( ) ] . these equations have practical applications in fabry - perot theory - based optical systems . @ xcite the considered plate is a two - dimensional scatterer with the spatial variation of the _ s _ - axis such that @ xmath41 . therefore , for the _ s _ - and _ z _ - polarised incident waves , there is no _ z _ - component of the electric field and magnetic fields , and for the transmitted _ p _ - - wave the surface of the plate has an equal scattering index @ xmath42 ^ { 1 / 2 } $ ] ( the medium does not have optical activity for the _ s _ - - wave ) . @ xcite due to the dependence of @ xmath43 to @ xmath13 the magnitude of the transmitted _ p _ - wave is proportional to the magnetisation . importantly , the tfe is not constant , so changing the direction of the electric or magnetic field from @ xmath44 to @ xmath45 ( i . e . , @ xmath46 ) does not change the magnitude of the transmission @ xmath47 . hence , the tfe is given by the transmission @ xmath48 . @xcite # , the tfe can take place only in scatterers where a nonhomogeneous , weakly incident wave is absorbed by a wave strongly incident at the surface , i . e . the tfe occurs at both the normal and oblique incidence . @ xcite ##s , in bold . @ xmath2 ( b ) we get @ xmath49 as a function of the angle of incidence @ xmath38 for the wavelength in the reciprocal of @ xmath39 m . we find that at this angle a comparison with @ xmath50 @ xmath1 m would produce the maximum of the tfe . ( cf . @ xmath28 ) . thus @ xmath2 ( b ) shows that in the absence of the applied external magnetic field the transmission curve @ xmath40 for the _ p _ - _ beam has no variation due to interference effects . the shape of the beam @ xmath49 reflects the shape of @ xmath40 . at the brewster angle @ xmath51 one gets @ xmath52 because vanishing surface area results in no interference effects . it is noteworthy that for the total thickness of the beam , which is @ xmat##h8 is larger than the diameter of the reference sphere @ xmath50 @ xmath1 m , the strength of the tfe is ten times greater than in the sphere . however , in a @ xmath6 @ xmath1m - thick plate ( not shown ) the strength of the tfe breaks down because the casimir effect is significantly reduced . of course , the fabrication techniques for magnetic spheres and plates are not much well - established and less effort ##ful than those for single magnetic microspheres . however , the recent advances in producing ultra - small magnetic garnet particles make it possible to produce magnetic scatterers with a close - to - spherical shape . @ xcite yig powders with the individual particle size of @ xmath53 @ xmath1 m can be obtained using a microwave deposition process . @ xcite furthermore , single magnetic spheres microsphere can be fabricated using a laser deposition @ xcite . additionally , laser - based printing methods can also be used . @ xcite we presented an experimental scheme for enhancing the magnetic casimir effect in single magneto - spherical microspheres . we presented the scenario of a sphere made of a single magnetic garnet with a realistically sphericalhigh and low magneto - optical activity in the visible and infrared wavelength bands . we found the transverse faraday effect of the size of @ xmath54 , which is larger or comparable with the values attainable with the micro mo devices which , however , have a significantly smaller diameter as compared with microspheres . our devices will find applications in nanophotonics , imaging , and magnonics . this work was funded by the australian research council . ism gratefully received a distinguished research fellow from the university of western australia . the council thanks ass . / prof . a . metaxas for our discussions .
