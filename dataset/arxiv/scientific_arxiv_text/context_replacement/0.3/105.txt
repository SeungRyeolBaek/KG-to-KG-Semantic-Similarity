shape memory effects ( sma ) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their important industrial applications , including mechanical imaging devices and medical devices . the shape memory effect also gives rise to superelasticity , which finds application in film and wire frames . the shape memory effect is related to the reversible martensitic ( diffusionless ) phase transition . it has been shown that the martensitic transformation can be induced by magnetic fields , heat or both , and the mechanical properties of materials , therefore , can be controlled accordingly . in some cases , including those discussed in the present section , alloying can significantly alter the shape and transition state of the materials , demonstrating the importance of electronic features , especially the surface effects , in the structural energetics of sma . there are several different approaches to modelling of the shape memory effect . continuum modelling involves investigation of the microstructural behavior , specifically martensitic transformation , at the very long length scales . size - specific behavior is determined through an energy functional for the surface effects in terms of strain and a linear boundary function to set the length scale . in atomistic models , the individual atoms are considered , and their size given by an interatomic potential , which may be determined by ,from first - principles density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations , or a combination of the two . the symmetry and defect energies emerge from this approach , which gives microstructures with both finite energy scales ( from defect energies ) and time scales ( since the molecules have only newtonian motions and masses ) . however , in atomistic models , the strain degrees of freedom do not exist anymore . first principles dft methods are so energy intensive that direct studies of microstructural behavior are impossible , but they are valuable tools for obtaining precise atomic - level information regarding stresses , strains and stresses independent of empirical input , and for understanding the molecular nature of this behavior . thus , first - principles prediction of the strain response of the high - temperature structure towards the low - temperature martensitic structure is in itself very useful . the above models can then also be used as alternatives to the @ xcite and continuum models of shape memory systems . typically , martensitic structures are described using the strain as an independent parameter , the classic example being the bain bcc - thomson transformation of iron . however , there is an alternative approach appropriate for molecules where the strain degrees of freedom are related to spin degrees of freedom ( phonons ) . following the first -in terms of structural information , @ xcite we start from a high - temperature crystal structure ( pd @ xmath2 ) and freeze the individual phonons of this structure , with corresponding lattice parameters , to obtain the solid - state structure . the symmetry of the phonons matches the symmetry of the high temperature structure . this theory has been widely used in the study of polymers @ xcite and ferroelectric ##s @ xcite and has been applied to shape memory materials in our recent study of niti @ xcite . closely related to niti , pdti and ptti are shape memory materials with reasonable structural simplicity and extraordinary electronic properties . they exhibit a martensitic structure at tunable temperatures : pdti transforms to 810k , but this can be reduced to 410k with 50 % reduction of temperature for polymers @ xcite . the high - temperature ` ` cubic ' ' phase has a distorted cubic @ xmath2 structure ( space group @ xmath3 ) , while the low temperature ` ` martensitic ' ' phase has been described as the orthorhombic @ xmath0 structure @ xcite ( space group : @ xmath4 ) . further higher - order studies in pdti and ptti @xcite have shown that the general electronic and elastic properties of the @ xmath0 structure are best described by density - functional theory , and the experimentally determined structure . in this paper , we investigate the structural energetics of pdti and ptti from first - principles calculations of phonon frequencies as well as total energy . this allows us to examine local as well as global stability and to study relaxation mechanisms , focusing on the structural interactions between the @ xmath2 - @ xmath0 and bcc - hcp structures and showing that coupling of the modes to the strain is a key component of the structural energetics . in sec . ii , we present the first - principles calculations . in sec . iii , we describe and discuss the results for the phonon dispersion of pdti and ptti in the @ xmath2 structure and for the electronic structures in which the modes and strain are coupled , assuming a low - temperature steady state . in addition , we present results of calculations of the electronic structure , describing and discussing interactions that affect the relative stability of the structure . 2 . the paper . first - principles total energy calculations were carried out using density - functional theory with a plane - wave pseudopotential approach . the calculations were performedwith the res _ de - initio _ simulations technique @ xcite , using the perdew - zunger @ xcite parametrization of the low - dimensional approximation ( lda ) . the ultrasoft pseudopotentials @ xcite were improved . our pseudopotentials were nonlinear ##ity , and for this , we treated the occupied @ xmath5 levels as unstable . the atomic wave functions were replaced by a plane - wave function , with the total wave parameter of 278ev . the brillouin zone ( bz ) integrations were carried out using the hermite - schmidt smearing technique @ xcite with the smearing parameter of 0 . 1ev . the unit cell contained two atoms in the cubic @ xmath2 structure and two atoms in the orthorhombic @ xmath0 and monoclinic @ xmath1 structures . the calculations were performed with a @ xmath6 monkhorst - schmidt ( mp ) @ xmath7point mesh for the cubic @ xmath2 structure and a @ xmath8 mp @ xmath7point mesh for both orthorhombic @ xmath0 and monoclinic @ xmath1and ( point 1 : @ xmath9 ) , corresponding to 288 @ xmath10 points in the @ xmath11 ##ucible bz of the central cubic cell , 288 @ xmath10 points in the @ xmath12 irreducible bz of the orthorhombic cell and 576 @ xmath10 points in the @ xmath13 # bz of the cubic cell . this combination of parameters brings the bond energy to within 1 mev / s . the equation of states ( os ) for the @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 structures was obtained using the same method with blchl and @ xcite . the bz s for the orthorhombic @ xmath0 and the @ xmath1 structures are identical . to determine the band structure of the two structures , we label the @ xmath0 band structure , and the @ xmath0 structure is a special case of @ xmath1 . the phonon correlation coefficients were obtained with the pwscf and phonon correction @ xcite , and the perdew - zunger @ xcite paramet##rization of the lda , as above . ultrasoft pseudopotentials @ xcite for pt , pt and ti were calculated according to a modified rappe - rabe - kaxiras - joannopoulos ( rrkj ) method @ xcite with electronic wave functions @ xcite . the electronic wave functions were stored in a half - wave crystal lattice with a maximum energy level of 408ev . the augmentation parameters were set up to 9000ev . the brillouin zone ( bz ) calculations were carried out by the hermite - simon ##s method @ xcite on a 56 _ k _ - point mesh ( corresponding to @ xmath14 - divisions of the @ xmath15 , @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 mesh ) in the @ xmath11 - region . the value of the scattering parameter was @ xmath18 = 0 . 2ev . these calculations produced phonon that converged to 1 @ xmath19 . the scattering coefficient was computed on a @ xmath20 _ q _ - point mesh commensurate with the _ k _ - point mesh . the complete phonon calculation wasis obtained from the computation of free - space interatomic coupling ##s within the standard box @ xcite . the decision to use the different first - principles codes was influenced by the relative strengths of materials . vasp is a highly accurate method for calculating total energies , strains , and stresses , and refers to the minimum energy structure , but does not have the cross - boundary perturbation analysis capabilities of pwscf / phonon . even with slightly different pseudopotentials and _ k _ - _ sampling , the results of the two codes are very similar . for example , the difference between the computed lattice parameters for the @ xmath2 structure of pdti is less than 0 . 2 % , and for ptti the difference is less than 0 . 1 % . comparisons of normalized eigenvector values computed by vasp using the standard phonon method and by pwscf / phonon methods show reasonable accuracy , typically around 5 % . for the box @ xmath2 structure , our calculations yield the equilibrium lattice parameters of 3 . 112 and 3 . 125 for pdti and ptti respectively . for comparison , we can use zero - point energy - of - plane - wave theory ( flapw ) within thelda @ xcite . the results are in excellent agreement with flapw results of 3 . 113 ( pdti ) and 3 . 127 ( ptti ) and in very good agreement with the results of 3 . 18 and 3 . 20 . the phonon frequency relations along the symmetry lines , computed from the theoretical lattice parameters , are shown in table [ phonons ] . the frequencies are obtained by computing the square root of the eigenvalues of the momentum matrix @ xcite . imaginary frequencies , as well as negative , are obtained from the values of the momentum matrix . however , the structure is dynamically unstable against forces following the first eigenvector . it should be noted that the phonon frequency @ xmath21 _ _ _ _ the inverse of the frequency of oscillation of this mode ( as measured in molecular experiments ) nor is it the frequency difference between adjacent quantum states ( as measured in neutron scattering experiments ) . these three frequencies are equal only for the stable harmonic structure . in the case studied above the stable modes may be related to a soft state @ xcite ( as defined by electron or neutron scattering ) at room temperature , and even the stable modes are expected to be significantly renorma##lized is a function of acoustic and anharmonic effects . phonon coupling relations for pdti ( upper ) and ptti ( lower ) in the @ xmath2 structure calculated at the lda equilibrium parameters 3 . 112 and 3 . 125 respectively . the negative slope of the acoustic @ xmath22 branch corresponds to a pure elastic instability ( @ xmath23 ) . symmetry labels are assigned according to the conventions of ref . with pd / pt at the origin . the imaginary frequencies of the unstable modes are plotted as positive values . , title = " fig : " ] + phonon dispersion relations for pdti ( upper ) and ptti ( lower ) in the @ xmath2 structure calculated at the lda equilibrium parameters 3 . 112 and 3 . 125 respectively . the positive slope of the acoustic @ xmath22 branch corresponds to a pure elastic instability ( @ xmath23 ) . symmetry labels are assigned according to the conventions of ref . with pd / pt at the origin . the imaginary frequencies of the unstable modes are plotted as negative values . , title = " fig : " ] the momentum matrices are assigned as a function to the z - matrix : the first derivative of the internal energy with respectto describe structure . the eigenmodes of the force field above represent the potential energy landscape , and a negative eigenvalue indicates a potential equilibrium against local forces following the corresponding eigenvector . while the corresponding normalized displacements of these eigenmodes are in general slightly different they carry the same symmetry group as the eigenmodes of the dynamical system . either notation is intended to serve as a useful pointer to a lower energy state if the distorted state obtained by freezing is " an unstable state " described using first - order forces and stresses , as we see below . the phonon dispersion lines shown in the [ phonons ] are those of the @ xmath2 structure similar to and much stronger than that of niti @ xcite . there are also regions of reciprocal space where one , two or even three phases are present , with significant instabilities at @ xmath24 and along @ xmath25 - @ xmath26 . the phonon instability shows that the very low - temperature @ xmath2 structures of pdti and ptti are strongly dominated by anharmonic phonons , and should be characterized by rapidly fluctuating phase distortions . the phphonon dispersions are also reminiscent of those of the bcc phases such as ti and ti , which undergo martensitic transformations to hcp and @ xmath21 @ xcite ( via the @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 - @ xmath26 bcc - phonon , respectively ) phases . the argument based on the view of @ xmath0 and of pdti and ptti as chemically stable hcp will be further explained below . in the # ##ening approach , we check for local energy minima by selecting an unstable mode of the high order term , engaging in the distortion with varying amplitude , and relaxing the resulting distortion . in most cases , the mode with the largest energy amplitude will generate the lowest energy gain . however , this is by no means strictly true , as the energy gain is determined not only by the size of the distortion , but by higher order terms as well as the strength of coupling to it and other modes , both unstable and stable , of appropriate symmetry . however , in pdti this ` ` most unstable ' ' mode ( i . e . largest positive eigenvalue ) occurs in the @ xmath25 - @ xmath26 branch ratherthan to @ xmath24 . this mode is also found in dynamic - ordered bcc materials such as titanium and zirconium where it is associated with a phase transition to the stable @ xmath21 ( @ xmath27 ) ti . the fact that in the dynamic ordered tc ( pd / pt ) ti , the ideal phase transition occurs to @ xmath0 rather than @ xmath27 shows the importance of anharmonic relaxation and relaxation rates in the energetics of these materials . eigenmode of the dynamic - ordered @ xmath28 unstable phonon is the @ xmath2 mode . this mode resembles the @ xmath0 mode in pdti and ptti . the structure is then projected along the @ xmath29 plane , with pd / pt represented by closed circles and tc by open circles . ] [ options = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , options = " header " , ] in the two - mode model , there is no guarantee that the energy - minimizing plug - in of the unstable mode will stablize the other two modes of the high- symmetry breaking . in the above example , the resulting doubled unit cell has two pairs of ( 110 ) @ xmath30 planes each of which is unstable to strain - angle shuffling at the _ s - _ r . the simplest such mode in the @ xmath0 structure is @ xmath31 , which breaks the transition to monoclinic @ xmath32 . the resulting @ xmath1 structure has three additional internal parameters : the strain parameter @ xmath33 and two external parameters @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 . these parameters are calculated for the resulting @ xmath1 structure in table [ table : struct ] , and combined with the corresponding eigenvector matrix in table [ table : matrix ] . however , it is important to note that the computed @ xmath25 phonon modes in the @ xmath0 structures are in fact not pure ( table [ table : phonon - gamma ] ) . the loss of energy from distortion to @ xmath1 can not be observed from a pure @ xmath31 phonon mode , but can if the strain is allowed to relax simulataneously ( table [ table: struct ] ) . this may be the case that in the theoretical calculation @ xcite , @ xmath0 is reported to be the minimum energy state . the relative energies of the various crystal structures are shown in the [ table : struct ] . the @ xmath0 total energy is lower than @ xmath2 . a rough estimate of the transition temperature is provided by @ xmath36 which suggest @ xmath37 of 1050k ( pdti ) and 1755k ( ptti ) . these two values are much lower than the experimental values for the hysteretical transition to @ xcite ( of 800k and 1400k respectively ) , but show the correct temperature trend . for no crystal structure a @ xmath1 phase yet been observed experimentally . the small total energy difference between @ xmath1 and @ xmath1 , divided into units , are 28k and 39k for pdti and ptti , respectively . this suggests that the transition to the @ xmath1 phase should occur at temperatures well below those at which the experiments were conducted , so that our results are fully consistent with the previous experimental data . + + the p - hcp phase model also suggests that we shouldconsider the binary - phase equivalent , which is the @ xmath38 phase . @ xmath38 is separated from @ xmath2 by a simple ( 001 ) shear and a complex shear @ xcite , so we find that @ xmath38 has slightly higher energy than @ xmath0 . we consider a simple structure : at the special @ xmath1 faces @ xmath39 and @ xmath40 , orthorhombic symmetry is broken . the side of the conventional cell of this face , orthorhombic ( bco ) ( space group @ xmath41 ) , is tilted in the * b * direction , but the conventional cell still has four atoms . although at very low energies ( [ table : struct ] ) , this gives us a reference point for molecules with energy @ xmath33 @ xcite . note that a simple shear to @ xmath42 would give the @ xmath0 phase once again . the # ##s of the paths in the structure described above are useful for understanding the transformation process . we consider the energies of the molecules : @ xmath2 - @ xmath0 , @ xmath0 - @ xmath1 and @ x##math1 - bco . in accordance with the timescale separation between bulk strain and atomic strain , we obtain these states by relaxing the bonds to their minimum possible strength along with the applied stress and strain on the cell . the remaining bulk strain degrees of freedom are reduced to a small degree by the differences in the strains of the endpoint atoms . for the @ xmath2 phase , we minimize the energy of the @ xmath0 space group , which gives a smooth mapping of the structure along the path . > from figure [ tote ] , it is clear that there is a total energy barrier along the @ xmath2 - @ xmath0 - @ xmath1 path , and that @ xmath0 represents the total energy barrier between @ xmath1 martensitic variants . the @ xmath0 path can be viewed as the binary equivalent of hcp , and the transformation path as the binary equivalent of the nishiyama - wassermann ( nw ) path . using the analogy with the classical model for the bcc - hcp transition , we can trace the transition to a sequence of ( 1 ) @ xmath30 planes @ xcite . phase changes in molecules are oftenrefer to details of the transition surface , and we have calculated the band structures of @ xmath2 , @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 to investigate this . in pdti / ptti the band structure is dominated by the _ and _ - bands , with the ti / pt bands lying below the atomic level and being completely occupied , and the ti @ xmath43 - bands lying above the atomic level ( figure [ bands - pdti ] and [ bands - ptti ] ) , the atomic centers being offset by about 6ev . the free - electron ti @ xmath44 bands are very stable , and play little role in the transition except to add more electrons to the ti - pt bond . the large strain rate in the @ xmath45 bands means that the transition states are quite stable ( @ xmath0 has the highest dos ##age @ xmath46 @ xcite ) and this transition may not be related directly to the band structure . by contrast , the @ xmath0 - @ xmath1 transition is accompanied by the presence of a pseudogap at the atomic level , a typical signature of bond formation . the band structures are very similar , the only one which stab##ilises @ xmath1 being due to the distortion above the energy barrier of the pocket of electrons around @ xmath47 . the distortion to @ xmath1 is not enough to complete the full phase transition which eliminates this pocket of electrons from the structure . in conclusion , we have done _ ab initio _ calculations of the structural energetics of pdti and ptti . in this case we found that the lowest energy - state structure will stabilize @ xmath1 , with the ( observed ) @ xmath2 and @ xmath0 phases being weakly stabilized . there are no effective energy barriers between the structures , so that the phase transition microstates that belong to the @ xmath1 structure _ _ _ belong to the @ xmath0 and @ xmath2 structures . in contrast to niti @ xcite , the observed @ xmath22 phonon structure is stable . we showed that the @ xmath0 structure will be stabilized by the ` ` spin in ' ' of phonons of the @ xmath2 structure due to the shear coupling with the @ xmath48 structure ##ity , and that no other - - - - force - constant -matrix eigenvector corresponds to the low - energy state . the @ xmath1 strain corresponds to a single strain corresponding to the @ xmath31 phonon of the @ xmath0 phase . comparing the relative energies of these strains shows that they are both related to those of the @ xmath49 phases , and therefore that the combined mechanism is the mechanical equivalent of the nishiyama - type bcc - hcp mechanism . we visit j . d . smith , v . a . naumov , and s . bhattacharya for further details . this paper was published by afosr / muri f49620 - 98 - 00 - 0433 . the calculations were performed on the sgi -
