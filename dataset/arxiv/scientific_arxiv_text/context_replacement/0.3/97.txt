gliese 229b is not only the first t dwarf identified as a @ xcite , but it is also the brightest and best - studied t dwarf known . with an effective temperature of @ xmath5k , it lies somewhere between the latest l dwarfs ( @ xmath6k , @ xcite ) and the hottest planets of the solar system ( @ xmath7k ) . indeed , its near infrared spectrum shows the strong ch @ xmath8o spectral lines characteristic of ultra - low mass planets and the weak ch @ xmath9 ##o lines in the spectra of jupiter , saturn and neptune . the infrared component of the spectrum of gl 229b is strong and hints at the spectral appearance of extrasolar giant planets which have effective temperatures in the range 200 1600 @ xmath10k @ xcite . a wealth of data on gl 229b has accumulated since its discovery 20 years ago . broad band spectra from @ xmath11 through @ xmath12 and highly accurate spectroscopy @ xcite allow an accurate determination of its bolometric properties . detailed observations @ xcite covering the range from 3 . 5 to 5 . 0 @ xmath13 m have provided aat rapidly declining wavelengths shortward of 1 @ xmath13 m , the unmistakable presence of ch @ xmath9 , ch @ xmath8o , and co , and demonstrated the _ absence _ of the crh , feh , vo and tio features _ of late m and early k dwarfs . griffith , noll , geballe & marley ( 1997 ) and @ xcite have found co with an abundance well above the value predicted by chemical equilibrium , a phenomenon commonly observed in the atmosphere of venus . the spectra for gl 229b @ xcite match the dust flux distribution fairly well and all agree that 1 ) @ xmath5k , 2 ) compared to other dust stars , the dust flux is absent if not present in the atmosphere , 3 ) the composition of gl 229b is well constrained at present . the rapid decline of the spectrum at wavelengths shortward of 1 @ xmath13 m is interpreted as caused by the absorbing haze of complex elements ( griffith , yelle & marley 1998 ) or possibly by the pressure - broadened spectral line of the k - dwarfs located at 0 . 77 @ xmath13 m ( tsuji , ohnaka & ao##ki 1999 ; lee , lee & sharp 1999 ) . in this paper , we present very high - resolution measurements of the @ xmath0 , @ xmath1 , and @ xmath2 bands . with the exception of the ` ` red ' ' band of @ xcite , we analyze each part of the spectrum separately to obtain independent measures of the nh @ xmath8o spectrum of gl 229b , interpreted as the metallicity , to determine for the first time the presence of nh @ xmath3 in the spectrum , and to estimate the nh @ xmath3 abundance at two different depths in the atmosphere . our results are expressed in terms of the observed gravity which can only be determined from the data presented here . first , we obtain a large number of acceptable combinations of @ xmath14 and gravity , including the observed infrared spectrum of gl 229b @ xcite . the data and the corresponding synthetic spectrum are presented section 2 . section 2 shows how an accurate model , a well - sampled global energy model and evolutionary models can reduce the wide range of combinations of @ xmath14 and gravity without having to resort to statistical analysis . the synthetic spectrum analysis and our method of analysis areand in 4 . the results of the objects of interest which are at least partially detectable are described in 5 , followed by a summary in 6 . finally , a summary of the results and implications for the study are given in 7 . images of gl 229b from three narrow slits in the @ xmath0 , @ xmath1 , and @ xmath2 windows were obtained using the 1 . 5 m united kingdom radio telescope ( ukirt ) in 1998 january , using the facility spectrometer cgs4 @ xcite and its 10 nm / s beam . details of the observations are given in table 1 . these are among the highest resolution spectra obtained of any brown dwarf . the spectra were obtained in the standard nod / nod mode with the @ xmath15 wide slit of the telescope oriented at a position angle of @ xmath16 , roughly parallel to the line between gl 229a and gl 229b . the forward - facing emission pattern of gl 229a combined with scattered light from that slit , which is 10 % brighter than gl 229b , contaminated the two rows above and to the left of those in the window of gl 229b . the spectra of the gl 229##b rows was determined by interpolation and then subtracted ; and it was equal or somewhat less than the signal from gl 229b . in order to match telluric absorption features , spectra of the a0v star ngc 1849 were obtained well prior to gl 229b . in both cases the match in airmasses was better than 50 % and even in the ratioed spectra the absorption features are small compared to the noise level . the range was determined by observations of arc slits and was in all cases less than a part of @ xmath17 ( @ xmath18 ) . the spectra shown in this paper have been slightly modified , so that the peak values are lower than those in figure 1 by approximately 50 percent . they may have been rebinned to facilitate coadding the spectra and joining the spectral regions . the spectral bars can be judged by the point - to - point variations in different portions of the spectra , the signal - to - noise ratios . the highest values are approximately 20 in the @ xmath2 band , 25 in the @ xmath1 band , and 20 in the @ xmath0 band . the wavelength range of the spectra is unknown as no attempt was made to measurethe peak of gl 229b . when we call the filters by their corresponding standard for infrared bandpass , their wavelength coverages are much larger than the @ xmath19 filters and they correspond to the peak energies of gl 229b at each bandpass . in the @ xmath0 band spectrum ( fig . 1 ) , almost all features are caused by h @ xmath8o . the # ##ward end of the spectrum is the far side of the ch @ xmath9 band , which is responsible for the features seen shortward of @ xmath20 m . absorption lines of elemental potassium are also detected near @ xmath21 m . all other lines of other metals are within the wavelength coverage of our filters . the @ xmath1 band spectrum ( fig . 2 ) is very rich in molecular opacity features . all the features seen in the spectrum are either due to h @ xmath8o ( @ xmath22 m ) or because of a very strong ch @ xmath9 ##o line ( @ xmath23 m ) . features seen between 1 . 5 and 1 . 6 @ xmath13 m can not presently be ascribed with h and are due to either h@ xmath8o or ch @ xmath9 . although the contributions of nh @ xmath3 and h @ xmath8s are relatively negligible in this part of the spectrum , neither molecule has distinct absorption features . their presence can not be easily determined from these data , mainly because their absorption is weaker than that of h @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 and because of significant band overlap ( figure 1 . 2 ) . the @ xmath2 absorption flux emerges in an intermediate state between a strong h @ xmath8o band and a strong ch @ xmath9 band ( ) . spectral lines are dominated by h @ xmath8o at shorter wavelengths ( @ xmath24 m ) and by ch @ xmath9 at longer wavelengths ( @ xmath25 m ) . the distinctive features of h @ xmath3 are present at the upper end of this spectrum and models predict a single distinctive feature of h @ xmath8s or @ xmath26 m . the features shown in figures # 3 are unresolved blends of numerous electronic transitions . a spectral profile at least 10 times higher wouldis required to determine the crystal structure of the core of gl 229b . although synthetic spectra have been fairly successful in reproducing the optical spectrum of gl 229b @ xcite , the exact spectral power level has not yet been determined accurately . limitations of the available databases are largely responsible for the large discrepancies between synthetic spectra and the data ( see 4 . 2 ) . these limitations have impeded the discovery of @ xmath14 and of the gravity @ xmath27 in particular . on the other hand , the bolometric spectrum of gl 229b is very well known . combining spectroscopic and photometric data from 0 . 5 to 10 @ xmath13 together with the gravity , @ xcite found @ xmath28 . with new @ xmath29 data , @ xcite found @ xmath30 . a recalibration of the hst method of @ xcite found @ xmath31 . new data @ xcite allow us to find a family of @ xmath32 models with a prototype @ xmath33 . figure 4 shows the cooling rate of low metallicity brown dwarfs in terms ofthe surface is @ xmath14 and @ xmath27 . models with the lower limit of gl 229b lie within the line running through the center of the figure . with a very small lower limit for the age of gl 229a of 0 . 2 @ xmath10gyr @ xcite , we find @ xmath34k . on the other hand , the surface is more constrained with @ xmath35 , corresponding to a lower limit of 0 . 015 to . 07 @ xmath36 . while the upper limit is very close to the current main sequence upper limit , gl 229b ' status as a brown dwarf is uncertain . a star at the end of the main sequence would be much cooler with @ xmath37k ; see outside of fig . 4 . in the course of this paper , the discussion focuses on three atmosphere models which span the range of allowed temperatures ( figure 3 and fig . 4 ) : @ xmath38 ( 870 , 4 . 0 ) , ( 940 , 5 . 0 ) and ( 1030 , 6 . 0 ) , which we call models a , b , and c , respectively . these constraints for @ xmath14 and @xmath27 from cooling sequences are very similar . we find the same result , within the same region of @ xmath33 , from several cooling sequences which include @ xcite . the spectra were calculated with different input physics such as the equation of diffusion and surface temperature conditions derived from grey and non - grey atmosphere ##s using different opacity models . in figure 1 , we show that these different models all match the spectra even if they have different metallicities , ranging from [ c / n ] @ xmath39 to @ xmath40 . the evolution of brown dwarfs is related to the metallicity through the atmospheric pressure which controls the rate of cooling . we note that for the range of values given , the presence of a reduced metallicity affects our values of @ xmath14 , @ xmath27 , and the cooling effect is smaller but similar to that of the pressure in the region of @ xmath33 . we choose to ignore it for now . our determination is based on the atmosphere ##s of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets given in @ xcite . here , the gases are in radiative / convective equilibrium and the rate of radiative transfer is solved with the k - coefficientmethod . the chemical signature is treated as in @ xcite . # ##eous ##s include rayleigh scattering , the gas - induced opacity of h @ xmath8 and the molecular lines of h @ xmath8o , ch @ xmath9 , h @ xmath3 , h @ xmath8s , h @ xmath3 , and co , as well as the continuum lines of h @ xmath41 and h @ xmath42 . the molecular line opacity database is described in more detail in 4 . 2 . spectral line analysis is also included . because of the relatively large flux of gl 229b , pressure dependence of the molecular line plays an important role in determining the @ xmath43 composition of the atmosphere and in shaping the atmosphere . the line - by - line gas theory we use is described in @ xcite . the molecular line opacity database responsible for the accurate estimation of the flux of gl 229b shortward of 5 . 1 @ xmath13 m is developed from the haze model of @ xcite . details of the haze model and of our fitting procedure are described in 5 . 1 . the @ xmat##h43 both of these atmosphere ##s are shown in diagram . the structures intersect each other because h @ xmath14 and the sun lie between the structures . the inflexion point at @ xmath44 signals the top of the convection zone . using the same two methods used to calculate the k - coefficients , high - resolution synthetic spectra are obtained from the two structures by solving the radiative transfer equation with the feautrier method on a parallel basis with @ xmath45 @ xmath46 . spectra with resolution greater than @ xmath47 @ xmath46 can then be obtained for comparison with data . an unusual aspect of white dwarf clouds is the strong correlation of the opacity with temperature . these atmospheres are strongly blue - grey and the near infrared spectrum is sculpted by the absorption lines of h @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 . most of the convection occurs in a large number of very small opacity regions . the concept of photosphere becomes almost useless since the level at which the atmosphere is formed depends only on the temperature . figure 6 shows the depth of the ` ` photosphere ' ' @ xmath48 at constant temperature and pressure .a range of wavelength for model a ( @ xmath49k , @ xmath50 ) . in the @ xmath51 , @ xmath0 , and @ xmath1 bands , and , to a lesser extent , in the @ xmath2 and @ xmath52 bands , the atmosphere is highly dense and can be observed to great depth . for @ xmath53 ##k , the surface energy level is a constant beginning with @ xmath54k . figure 2 reveals that astronomers at 0 . 5 and above @ xmath13 ##k can study the atmosphere from @ xmath54k , to a depth where @ xmath55k , up to a range of atmospheric - scale heights ! this is an excellent opportunity to study the structure of the atmosphere of a brown dwarf over an extended wavelength range . the surface of the convection layer for model b ( located at @ xmath56k ) is below the ` ` horizon ' ' at these wavelengths and is not directly visible , however . in the range of wavelength values of @ xmath14 and @ xmath27 ( k ) , we can determine the metallicity of gl 229b and the abundance of gmodel , by fitting the data to the model , for each of the three molecules . the accuracy of our results is determined by the quality of the model , the noise present in the data and , most significantly , by the quality of the molecular line lists used to compute their properties . the last point is a further improvement . the opacities of ch @ xmath9 and ch @ xmath3 are calculated from line lists obtained by combining the hitran @ xcite and geisa @ xcite data , which are complemented with recent laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations . these calculations are provided by @ xcite . the molecular line lists for these two molecules are very nearly identical for @ xmath57k , and their degree of similarity increases rapidly at higher frequencies where absorption from ground atoms is important . furthermore , the line list of ch @ xmath9 is limited to @ xmath58 m . we extend the ch @ xmath9 data to shorter intervals with the laboratory measurements of @ xcite which provide the absorption coefficient , with intervals of 5 @ xmath10 @ xmath46 . 0 and 5 @ xmath13 and 5 @ xmath59k . we use @ xcite opac##ities for @ xmath60 m and the line list for @ xmath61 m . this places the line from one star to the other in the new ch @ xmath8o absorption region and removes the discontinuity in ch @ xmath9 ##b at the transition . for @ xmath62 m , the analysis of @ xcite ##s the absorption lines of ch @ xmath9 determined from spectroscopic observations of the giant planets at 0 . 0004 @ xmath13 m intervals . because of the high temperature found in the atmosphere of these planets , the karkoschka ch @ xmath9 opacities are calculated for @ xmath63k . to our knowledge , this analysis of ch @ xmath3 and ch @ xmath9 opacity is the most accurate analysis available . as can be seen in figure 1 , the temperature of the atmosphere of gl 229b is everywhere higher than 300 @ xmath10k . for ch @ xmath9 , we calculate temperature - dependent line list ( which is always above 300 @ xmath10k ) from the population of excited states produced by thea constant for @ xmath61 wavelengths , and a temperature dependent opacity for shorter wavelengths . although the band spectra computed reproduce the fundamental structure of ch @ xmath9 very well ( starting at @ xmath64 ##k ) , the match with the 1 . 6 and 1 . 8 @ xmath13 m bands is very poor . even though ch @ xmath9 is a very prominent element in the spectrum of gl 229b , the current knowledge of its opacity is not sufficient for a quantitative analysis of its chemical signature . for this reason , we have essentially ignored the regions in our spectra where ch @ xmath9 is prominent . unfortunately , this prevents us from estimating the abundance of ch @ xmath9 and that of ammonia in gl 229b . ammonia has high abundance in both the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 band spectra . the line list for nh @ xmath3 begins at @ xmath65 m . because the line list does not include transitions from the excited states which begin at @ xmath66k , the nh @ xmath3 energy we compute at a given wavelength is strictly a lower limit to the actual energy. as for the resonance - induced peaks of h @ xmath8 , the most important molecular feature in gl 229b is h @ xmath8o , for which the opacity is now very well understood . we use the most recent and most extensive ab initio line list ( @ xcite , @ xmath67 transitions ) . this line list is also complete for @ xmath68k . as a result of the use of this database , we find that the h @ xmath8o features computed with this line list correspond very well in frequency with the observed peaks of gl 229b ( _ e . g . _ 5 . 7 to 7 ) . however , we find some discrepancies in the relative strengths of h @ xmath8o , which we attribute to the calculated relative strength of the transitions ( 5 . 7 ) . this effect can also be seen in fig . 1c of @ xcite . at high resolution , the distribution of molecular features in frequency and strength is nearly identical , and the differences in relative strengths we have found limit the accuracy of the fitting in a manner similar to this . this ` ` .` ' ' is at least as significant as the noise due to our data . we have constructed a set of synthetic spectra for the two models shown in fig . 4 with metallicity @ xmath69 } \ $ 1 . [ $ ] in excess of 0 . 1 . we used these modeled spectra to fit four different spectral regions ( the ` ` red ' ' , @ xmath0 , @ xmath1 , and @ xmath2 spectra ) separately to determine the metallicity as a function of gravity with an internal energy of @ xmath70 dex . for the purpose of fitting the model , the synthetic spectra are renormalized to the light flux at a particular point in each spectral region . the results will show the changes in the overall shape of the spectrum which are likely due to the uncertainties in the @ xmath71 region of the spectrum , the observed ch @ xmath9 opacities , and possible effects of dust transport . given the additional problems with the fitting of the h @ xmath8o spectra , we elected to do the fitting ` ` by eye , ' ' except where we noted . we describe the fitting of each spectral interval below . in the interest of the, we have a detailed table of results obtained only with the theory of quantum gravity ( model b ) . the approximate results obtained with models a and b are very nearly identical to those with model b . the results are summarized in table 1 . the ` ` ' ' ' band extends from 0 . 89 to @ xmath72 m and is located deep in the region where @ xmath73k . the spectra of @ xcite and @ xcite show two bands of cs ##o ( at 0 . 852 and 0 . 894 @ xmath13 m ) and a strong h @ xmath8o band _ _ _ _ the bands of tio and vo belong to late m dwarfs and early l dwarfs ( fig . 2 ) . some elements , such as ti , fe , al , ca , and cr , are expected to be bound in condensed matter in a high - pressure environment such as that of gl 229b and therefore are not available to form molecular bands @ xcite . with the exception of the strong , central band at 0 . 9874 @ xmath13 m , all lines between 0 . 89 and 1 . 92 @ xmath13 m can be attributed to h @ xmath8##o . an overlap of a strong band of h @ xmath8o and a weak ch @ xmath9 band explains the observed depression at 0 . 894 @ xmath13 m which was tentatively tentatively assigned to ch @ xmath9 by @ xcite and @ xcite . depression at 0 . 89 @ xmath13 m could not be identified at first . the other type of lines are not included in our model . the flux from gl 229b is also observed to decrease very rapidly toward longer wavelengths @ xcite , which , in the absence of the weak tio and vo bands , is evidently caused by the presence of a missing layer of opacity in the spectrum . spectra associated with molecular opacities only ( but excluding tio , vo , feh , etc ) show visible lines which are very weak @ xcite . the detailed sequence of the rest of the spectrum is poorly understood , indicating that the z ##wave ##front is dominated by h _ z ##n . we fit the red line of gl 229b between 0 . 02 and 0 . 02 @ xmath13 m to determine the metallicity . we have recalibrated the blue line @ xcite using the hstobservation of @ xcite . we model the continuum opacity with a sample of condensates from the observation of @ xcite . condensates are detected in the atmosphere of gl 229b on the basis of thermal expansion of @ xcite and we estimate the continuum opacity . ito , tsuji , ohnaka & aoki ( 1999 ) and smith , smith , & sharp ( 1999 ) attribute this observed decline to the pressure and the wing of the 0 . 5 @ xmath13 ##4 / ##pc resonance doublet . the observed infrared spectrum of a brown dwarf ( sdss 1624 + 0029 ) shows that the same explanation exists for @ xcite . the use of this dust model is not very useful for the calculation of the metallicity , however , as long as the same continuum and background are present in the calculation . the dust model is computed with the mie model of scattering of dust particles and is determined by the relative density of the particles , their relative size distribution , and the relative index of scattering of the particles . the cloud structure of @ xcite is determined by 1 ) the vertical density profile of the condensate , taken from : @ xmath74where @ xmath75 is the number density of the particles , @ xmath76 is the ambient gas temperature , and the number density is equal to @ xmath77 2 ) the complex distribution of the particles @ xmath78 ^ 2 , \ ] ] where @ xmath79 is the size of the particles ; and 3 ) the complex distribution of absorption of the particles @ xmath80 the parameters @ xmath81 , @ xmath82 , @ xmath83 , @ xmath84 , the function @ xmath85 , and the metallicity of the particles are the same . thus a multi - dimensional fit of the observed spectrum is also possible . furthermore , more accurate values of the ` ` ' ' ' and ##es can be obtained by taking the imaginary part of the index of refraction since the temperature dependence is _ constrained _ a priori _ . our results for the dust parameters are qualitatively similar to those of @ xcite . the values of the observed dust parameters are @ xmath86 @ xmath87bar @ xmath88 , @ xmath89bar , @ xmat##h90 ##0 , and @ xmath91 , with the greater part of the index of absorption varying from @ xmath92 at 0 . 1 @ xmath13 m to 0 . 01 at 1 . 0 @ xmath13 m . these results applied to model gases with a metallicity of [ m / h ] = @ xmath93 resulted in the fit shown in figure 7 . the metallicity of the atmosphere [ m / h ] is not independent of the dust parameters , however , as it is determined by the amplitude of the features in the h @ xmath8o band which we fit between 0 . 925 and 0 . 98 @ xmath13 m . a higher metallicity results in a higher amplitude of the features in the atmosphere . we obtain the same values of [ m / h ] as long as a good fit of the ` ` continuum ' ' flux level is obtained , regardless of the exact choice of dust parameters . the background panel of fig . 7 also shows differences in the relative strengths of the different features in the h @ xmath8o band between the measured and observed spectra . these differences also occur in the @ xmath0 , @ xmath1 , and @xmath2 % . the same differences are found for all the atmospheric spectra and lead to differences in the resolving power of the ab initio line spectrum of h @ xmath8o @ xcite . the metallicity was chosen to give the best spatial resolution of these spectra with a value of @ xmath70 dex . generally speaking , this value gives the h @ xmath8o abundance , or [ o / h ] rather than [ o / h ] . for high metallicity , the presence of silicates present in the atmosphere of gl 229b will reduce the amount of energy required to produce h @ xmath8o by @ xmath94 % @ xcite which implies that @ xmath95 } = { \ rm [ o / h ] } + 0 . 07 . \ ] ] the correction , which is for subsolar metallicities , is greater than our standard error and can be ignored indefinitely . the @ xmath0 band also reflects the nearly transparent nature of the atmosphere of gl 229b and is visible at a depth where @ xmath96k and @ xmath97bar ( 0 . 6) . our spectrum is almost all h @ xmath8o lines , with the exception of ch @ xmath9 bands for @ xmath98 m and of some rare k - lines ( fig . since we have chosen to ignore ch @ xmath9 bands and our current spectra do not include this region ) , we fit the @ xmath0 spectra to 1 . 215 and 1 . 298 @ xmath13 m to determine the metallicity from the depth of the h @ xmath8o line features . model 1 shows the shape of the metallicity on the spectrum ( top panel ) and our best fit ( bottom panel ) for model b . the brightness distribution of the @ xmath0 spectrum varies by a factor of 3 and our best fit shows distortions in the overall shape of the spectrum . the distortions may be caused by a number of uncertainties in the @ xmath43 profile of the spectrum , along with the h @ xmath8o lines or a small amount of uncertainty present in the optical properties of gl 229b ( not modeled ) . since the model is based on the depth of the features , we ignore these distortions and use the logarith##m of the flux greater than the average , as shown in 5 . 1 . as in the model spectrum ( 5 . 1 ) , we find a good correspondence of spectral lines between the measured and observed spectra although the model spectrum is much less accurate in determining the relative strengths of the h @ xmath8o bands . since the @ xmath1 band generally lies between the red side of a prominent ch @ xmath8o band ( for @ xmath22 m ) and the blue side of a prominent ch @ xmath9 band ( for @ xmath99 m ) , nh @ xmath3 and h @ xmath8s exhibit non - uniform opacity in this wavelength interval which also indicates the presence of helium . the strong ch @ xmath9 band is responsible for the majority of the flux at 1 . 59 @ xmath13 m . in this wavelength range , the ch @ xmath9 band is excluded in our spectrum by the @ xcite laboratory measurements which are equivalent to @ xmath59k . as a result , the ch @ xmath9 band fills in at 1 . 61 @ xmath13 m . the @ h, which results in a distortion of the mean flux level in observations and models for @ xmath100 m . this limits our analysis of the @ xmath1 band only to wavelengths shorter than 1 . 56 @ xmath13 m . in this wavelength range , the molecule is located deep in the nucleus , where @ xmath101k and @ xmath102 bar ( fig . 9 ) . within this wavelength range , we determine the abundance of nh @ xmath3 as a function of the metallicity , but do not untangle the two . we instead focus on the effects of nh @ xmath8s and co . while nh @ xmath3 absorption can significantly affect the value of the wavelength shortward of 1 . 56 @ xmath13 m ( fig . 9 ) , there is no distinctive feature of this spectral range ( @ xmath103 ) to provide an unambiguous picture of this phenomenon . the presence of co at 4 . 58 @ xmath13 m , below the equilibrium abundance @ xcite raises the possibility that nh @ xmath3 may also differ from the chemical equilibrium abundance @ xcite . we can vary the abundance of nh @ xmath3 byand the chemical constant , _ _ , for a constant metallicity _ _ throughout the atmosphere by constant factor . we found that reduction factors of 1 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 5 , and 0 provided an adequate estimate of nh @ xmath3 abundances for the c / n structure of the molecule and the # ##s with the nh @ xmath8o opacity . the effect of varying the metallicity on the @ xmath1 synthetic spectrum is shown in fig . 10 for group b . all spectra in figure 10 are computed with the equilibrium abundance of nh @ xmath3 . in this case , we have a good fit metallicity of [ m / h ] @ xmath104 . figures 9 and 10 show that varying the abundance of nh @ xmath3 and varying the metallicity have very different effects on the synthetic spectrum . in the absence of a distinctive feature of nh @ xmath3 , it is not possible to calculate both the metallicity and the nh @ xmath3 abundance separately . for the value of [ m / h ] , we must vary the nh @ xmath3 abundance to obtain a good fit , higher metallicities mean higher nh @ xmath3 abundance . thebest fitting solutions are shown in figure 2 . these fits are nearly identical from each other although the higher metallicity fits are marginally better . it is in the @ xmath1 band that we found the poorest fit in the absorption features of the data and the models . while the fit is made by matching the absorption features of the features , the two - dimensional fit ( metallicity and nh @ xmath3 abundance ) we have performed amounts to little more than half the slope of the data . as an internal check on our # ##s and results , we have also verified that our models will have the same abundance as the data by plotting data and models at a very high spatial resolution which match the absorption features . hydrogen sulfide ( h @ xmath8s ) has near - negligible absorption over most of the frequency range of our fit to the @ xmath1 band . figure 2 shows two spectra , with and without h @ xmath8s features . the opacity is lower than that of h @ xmath3 features , and there are no distinctive features which would allow for strong correlation . since the h @ xmath8s features are not uniformly distributed ,strength and thus , fitting the spectrum with either the chemical equilibrium abundance of h @ xmath8s or with no h @ xmath8s at all , has a little - to - negligible effect on the determination of the nh @ xmath3 abundance for a given metallicity ( figure 2 ) . for the low resolution model a , the nh @ xmath3 abundance determined from samples without h @ xmath8s is about half of the abundance associated with the chemical equilibrium abundance of h @ xmath8s . the abundance decreases at higher distances and is larger for model c . chemical equilibrium calculations @ xcite indicate that h @ xmath8s is present in gl 229b with an abundance about equal to the predicted abundance of sulfur in the atmosphere ( see fig . 3 for further discussion ) . however , we are unable to confirm the presence of h @ xmath8s in the spectrum of gl 229b at all . the discovery of co in the 6 . 5 @ xmath13 m region of gl 229b with an abundance about two orders of magnitude higher than predicted by chemical equilibrium shows the importance of chemical processes in the atmosphere @ xcite . thethe . 7 @ xmath13 m spectrum shows the atmosphere at the - 3 - level where @ xmath105k ( fig . 5 ) . at this level , chemical equilibrium conditions predict a combined abundance of @ xmath106 and @ xcite ##s @ xmath107 . the second overtone band of co lies within the @ xmath1 band and , in principle , could predict a abundance of @ xmath108 at a higher level of the atmosphere , where @ xmath109 ##k and @ xmath110k ( fig . 6 ) . figure 2 shows a comparison of the data with three spectra computed with various amounts of co for model stars with different metallicity . the first two spectra are computed with the chemical equilibrium abundance of co ( @ xmath111 and 14 @ xmath10bar ) and without co ( @ xmath112 ) . these three spectra are very nearly identical . the third spectrum is computed in the unrealistic case where all the co in the atmosphere is in the form of co ( @ xmath113 ) , which is the highest possible co enhancement . then we found for g @ xmath3 and h @ xmat##h8s , there is a strong spectral signature of co at this frequency ( @ xmath103 ) . our spectral range shows a significant decrease of @ xmath114 at best . we are unable to determine the co abundance with our data . since the @ xmath115 band of co is @ xmath116 m larger than the fundamental band at 4 . 7 @ xmath13 m , obtaining a useful co abundance from @ xmath1 band spectroscopy will be a difficult undertaking . of our three near infrared bands , the @ xmath2 band spectrum is the strongest in the atmosphere : @ xmath117 1020 @ xmath10k and @ xmath118bar ( fig . this is the same level that is obtained with 4 . 7 @ xmath13 m spectroscopy . ) for the @ xmath1 band , the spectrum contains very weak @ xmath8o features on the blue side ( @ xmath119 m ) and a strong ch @ xmath9 ##o appears at longer wavelengths . there are also several h @ xmath3 bands for @ xmath120 , and the models predict an extreme peak of h @xmath8s ( fig . 3 ) . figure 13 shows the spectrum calculated for model b with [ c / n ] @ xmath104 with the nh @ xmath2 m spectrum . there is an excellent agreement in the shape of the spectrum , though the exact shape is not yet well understood . for @ xmath120 m , the model has some features of nh @ xmath3 which we see in the next section . at 2 . 5 @ xmath13 there is a ch @ xmath9 band which is very small for the model . the structure of the modeled band is remarkably similar to the observed spectrum , however . this much better agreement of the ch @ xmath9 spectrum than we see for the @ xmath1 band is due to two factors . first , in this model the ch @ xmath9 spectrum is computed from a line list , and can therefore be computed as a function of temperature rather than as a fixed value of nh @ xmath10k . second , the high temperature where the spectrum is calculated ( fig . 6 ) reduces the accuracy of the use of the ch @ xmath9 line list to nh @ xmath10k .nevertheless , we do not include the ch @ xmath9 band here and extend our range to @ xmath121 m . the @ xmath2 band also offers a new opportunity : while the metallicity is obtained by matching the depth of the h @ xmath8o band between 2 . 05 and 2 . 05 @ xmath13 m , the depth of nh @ xmath3 can be obtained by matching its features below 2 . 05 @ xmath13 m . the depth of the metallicity is shown in fig . 14 for model b , which shows [ m / h ] = 0 and @ xmath40 ( top panel ) and our best estimate , [ m / h ] = @ xmath93 ( bottom panel ) . values for models a and b are given in table 15 . all lines in this region are due to h @ xmath8o and , as we saw in the red spectrum and in the @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 bands , the oscillator strengths of the h @ xmath8o spectral lines do not match the signal strengths of the other lines very well . in the wavelength range shown in fig . 15 , the region consists ofa few nh @ xmath3 features overlap the presence of h @ xmath8o lines . these lines show five distinct nh @ xmath3 features in this spectrum , three of which are clearly present ( 2 . 033 , 2 . 037 and 2 . 046 @ xmath13 m ) , one is absent ( 2 . 041 @ xmath13 m ) and three appear to be absent ( 2 . 026 , 2 . 029 and 2 . 031 @ xmath13 m ) . this constitutes an ambiguous detection of nh @ xmath3 in gl 229b . the determination of the presence of nh @ xmath3 from the @ xmath2 band spectrum is complicated by the poor resolution of the absorption components of the h @ xmath8o line , and by the weakness of our h @ xmath3 line list for frequencies above h @ xmath10k . the weakness of the list can be seen in the presence of features at 2 . 026 , 2 . 029 and 2 . 031 @ xmath13 m , which overlap h @ xmath8o absorption features . even after determining the h @ xmath##3 opacity , these effects are not very strong in the synthetic spectrum ( top panel of ) . the top panel of fig . 15 as well as fig . 16 show that for model b , the value of nh @ xmath3 obtained from the chemical equilibrium for the apparent metallicity of [ m / n ] @ xmath104 is very low . we now see a decrease in nh @ xmath3 in the atmosphere of gl 229b at the level determined by the @ xmath2 band spectrum . following the formula used for calculating the @ xmath1 band spectrum , we calculate this decrease as a fraction of the chemical equilibrium value of nh @ xmath3 for the metallicity obtained directly from the amplitude of the nh @ xmath8o spectrum in the @ xmath2 band . this fraction is used uniformly throughout the atmosphere for the calculation of the synthetic spectrum . given the apparent abundance of nh @ xmath3 in the @ xmath2 band , we have calculated the true nh @ xmath3 abundance by calculating the @ xmath122 of the spectral fit for @ xmath123 ) . this gives a correction factor of@ xmath124 with no nh @ xmath3 present gives an acceptable result . applying the fit to the region where nh @ xmath3 features are clearly present ( @ xmath125 ) gives a better result but gives a finite value for the nh @ xmath3 depletion of @ xmath126 . the results are shown in figure 2 . the lower part of figure 2 shows the model result , obtained by limiting the nh @ xmath3 concentration throughout the atmosphere to @ xmath127 % of its initial equilibrium value _ for the _ metallicity _ . with this small amount of depletion , the model reproduces the three observed values ( 2 . 033 , 2 . 037 and 2 . 046 @ xmath13 m ) extremely well and finds the 2 . 041 @ xmath13 m feature consistent with the model . because our nh @ xmath3 line spectrum is significant at all wavelengths , the value which we compute is only a lower limit to the observed nh @ xmath3 opacity at any wavelength . if the value is significant for the features present in the @ xmath2 line spectrum , then the nh @ x##math3 coefficient is actually lower than . it is extremely unlikely that the errors in the oscillator components of the h @ xmath8o transitions would seem to indicate the presence of h @ xmath3 which we find . for example , if we assumed that there was no nh @ xmath3 feature ( see curve in the top panel of 5 . 1 ) , the residuals between the data and the original data for @ xmath120 , would be much larger than the actual values which we find in the @ xmath8o and in all the spectra shown here . we want the depletion of nh @ xmath3 in the @ xmath2 band spectrum to be firmly established . we are not able to detect the absence of h @ xmath8s from our @ xmath1 band spectrum ( 5 . 3 . 2 ) . in the @ xmath2 band , the h @ xmath8s signal is completely overwhelmed by h @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 ##o . however , there is a difference in the opacity of h @ xmath8s which is about 1orders of magnitude greater than the other two models ( cf . our ) spectra indicate that this feature is strong enough to be apparent in the midst of the absence of h @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 ##s . figure 17 shows the relevant portion of the @ xmath2 band , with synthetic spectra for all three models ( a , b , and c ) and the predicted metallicity ( table 1 ) . all three panels are very similar . the strength of the predicted feature is well below the noise level of the data , and taken at face value , figure 17 shows a probable depletion of h @ xmath8s by more than a factor of 2 . on the other hand , the theoretical data indicate that the h @ xmath8s feature should be very near the expected abundance of sulfur , even in the presence of vertical sulfur and h @ xcite . since there is no reason to expect a probable depletion of h @ xmath8s , the uncertainty is probably due to the uncertainty in the data . our h @ xmath8s feature list is based on an ab initio analysis ( j . wattson , priv . whichhasnt been compared to laboratory data for this part of the spectrum . the spectral feature found at 0 . 1084 @ xmath13 m is a blend of three spectral lines from three different species of h @ xmath8s . possible errors in the position and frequency of these lines could significantly affect the resolution of the feature in our observed spectra . the limitations of the high frequencies of h @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 may also be responsible for the apparent mismatch . nevertheless , it is important to look for this feature at a higher resolution and a higher c / n ratio as the presence of sulfur in gl 229b would be a most likely feature . given our determination of @ xmath14 and [ c / h ] in terms of the specific element , we can obtain the abundance of co from the 45 @ xmath13 m spectra of @ xcite and @ xcite which are consistent with our results . for each element a , b , and c and using the metallicity shown in figure 1 , we computed synthetic spectra with various co elements . the latter is varied freely without any fixed limit . the synthetic spectra are scaled to the wavelength range of the element and then tothe data by a normalization is combined to yield the @ xmath122 . the @ xmath122 of the fitted spectrum has a well - defined value as a function of the co abundance , @ xmath108 ( table 3 ) . the dependence on the co abundance is reduced by generating synthetic data sets and fitting the gaussian distribution of the background noise to the data fitting model a . after performing the statistical analysis of the synthetic data sets , we obtain a ( non - uniform ) distribution of values of @ xmath108 . the values given in table 3 correspond to the 68 % confidence level . the @ xcite spectrum gives co values which are 0 . 1 dex ##ier than those obtained from the @ xcite spectrum ; which is well within the confidence range . @ xcite found a co mole fraction of 50 to 200 ppm ( @ xmath128 ) , assuming a h @ xmath8o abundance of 300 ppm ( or , [ m / h ] @ xmath129 ) , which agrees well with our results for model a which is [ m / h ] @ xmath130 . our results are also consistent with those of @ xcite which found covalues of @ xmath131 and @ xmath132 ppm ( @ xmath133 and @ xmath134 ) for [ m / h ] = @ xmath135 and 0 , respectively , using the data of @ xcite . since this part of the model has both h @ xmath8o and co abundance , our fitting procedure is applicable only to the co to h @ xmath8o abundance ##s . chemical equilibrium measurements show that the h @ xmath8o abundance scales linearly with the metallicity at the surface obtained with 45 @ xmath13 m spectroscopy ( _ i . e . _ all the gas phase carbon is in h @ xmath8o ) . accordingly , the co abundance we find scales with the metallicity of the model . as shown in figure 1 , the co abundance determined from the 0 . 45 @ xmath13 m spectrum corresponds exactly to the co / ch @ xmath9 ratio at chemical equilibrium . the observations also indicate the very - high chemical equilibrium value of co . the fact that the energy range where the carbon is in is an approximate fit to the model ( while we know that a large portion of the carbon is inch @ xmath9 ) , due to the rather noisy spectra . it is therefore necessary to restrict the surface gravity @ xmath27 of gl 229b to an astrophysically useful value . since @ xmath33 is known , the determination of @ xmath27 gives @ xmath14 , the radius , the mass , and the age of gl 229b ( fig . 1 ) , as well as the metallicity and the abundances of other elements such as al and nh @ xmath3 . the small uncertainty in @ xmath27 results in a large uncertainty in the mass of gl 229b and in the age of the system determined from cooling temperatures . while a dynamical determination of the mass may be possible in a billion or so @ xcite , a precise determination must be obtained much sooner . unfortunately , it is not possible to determine the gravity better than @ xmath136 with the data and models presently available . our high resolution spectroscopy does not allow us to choose between models a , b and c ( figure 1 ) . an increase in mass must be compensated by an increase in metallicity to come to an accurate determination . the high sensitivity of the @ xmath2the infrared spectral models reported by @ xcite are for a fixed metallicity only . similarly , @ xcite and @ xcite show that the spectral energy distribution of gl 229b itself is fairly sensitive to the gravity . but this is true only for a fixed metallicity . for the two models indicated in fig . 4 , and for the metallicity we have calculated for them ( table 3 ) the gravity dependence of the infrared spectra of @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 and @ xmath139 ( table 4 ) . this result is very interesting in the light of the uncertainty in the photometry of gl 229b . more interesting is the fact that the synthetic @ xmath140 interfere with the photometry . furthermore , the incomplete ch @ xmath9 models used in the gravity calculation almost always result in an uneven redistribution of the energy in the near infrared spectral windows which contain the broad band color . an example of this dependence of the @ xmath1 band color can be seen in figure . we conclude that a complete determination of the gravity is not possible at present . an alternative approach to determining the gravity of gl 229b is through a measurement of the non - broadenedtwo lines of their own . the spectrum of gl 229b is formed of a forest of unresolved molecular features maily attributed to h @ xmath8o , ch @ xmath9 , and nh @ xmath3 . because of the limitations of the ch @ xmath9 and nh @ xmath3 opacity of bases , the detailed study of molecular features is only performed in those regions where these two lines do not contribute significantly to the spectrum . direct observations with a resolution of @ xmath141 can determine the shape of the h @ xmath8o lines in regions where they are very small , _ e . g . _ from 2 . 08 to 2 . 105 @ xmath13 ##1 . our determination of the metallicity of gl 229b , with an resolution of @ xmath70 , is shown in figure 2 for the three gravities involved . we have an excellent agreement between our three independent values of [ m / n ] for each , and conclude that gl 229b is likely to be rich in heavy elements , _ e . g . _ hydrogen . the metallicity increases for ultra - low temperatures and decreases rapidly for lower gravities .in their analysis of the ` ` b ' ' spectrum , @ xcite assumes a b @ xmath8o abundance between 0 . 25 and 0 . 25 of the solar value for a @ xmath142k , @ xmath50 , and they expect a value of 0 . 25 for @ xcite . metal depletion in gl 229b is consistent with the discovery of the 0 . 985 - . 02 @ xmath13 m feh abundance in the spectrum of the primary star gl 229a by schiavon , barbuy & singh ( 1997 ) who found [ fe / h ] @ xmath143 . the different compositions of gl 229a imply that it is not metal - poor , however @ xcite . the relative metallicity of the components of this binary system may have been influenced by their formation processes . if the pair formed from the fragmentation of a collapsing star ( possibly a binary star system ) , the two components should have the same composition . if the brown dwarf formed from a collision , from formation within a dissipative keplerian orbit around the primary , the selective removal of gas phase elements could lead to higher _ enrichment _ in heavy elements relative to the primarythus , it is observed in the inner regions of the solar system . the low mass of the planet ( @ xmath144 ) and the large semi - major axis and radius ( @ xmath145au and @ xmath146 , @ xcite ) suggests that the binary formation process , and the different metallicities , are quite plausible . a more detailed study of the metallicity of gl 229a is desirable to better understand the history of this planet . the results of our analysis of the metallicity and abundances of important molecules in the atmosphere of gl 229b are shown below . each molecule corresponds to a different planet ( see table 2 ) and shows the abundance of important molecules as a function of composition of the atmosphere based on chemical reaction calculations and condensation product formation . the composition of these important molecules is fairly simple . the abundance of h @ xmath8o is uniformly reduced by @ xmath147 % by atmospheric condensation . except for a slight depletion for @ xmath148 due to the presence of h @ xmath8s , no sulfur is found in h @ xmath8s . the other molecules above are not known .condensation . carbon is partitioned into n @ xmath8 and nh @ xmath3 , with the latter being favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures . nh @ xmath3 dominates at the surface and rapidly transforms into n @ xmath8 at the higher pressures found deeper in the atmosphere . deeper in the atmosphere , the higher pressures cause a partial recombination of nh @ xmath3 and the ratio of the nh @ xmath3 to nh @ xmath8 ##o increases slowly with pressure . in a similar manner , more elemental carbon is found in ch @ xmath9 at the surface . co starts to form at higher temperatures and rapidly becomes the most abundant carbon - containing element . the formation of co consumes nh @ xmath8o , as can be seen in fig . 18 . in each panel , the dotted line indicates the relative abundance we have determined from the 4 . 7 @ xmath13 m wavelength , the rest of the box on the ordinate indicates the abundance probed at this time ( fig . 18 ) . as previously shown in @ xcite and @ xcite , the co abundance is @ xmath149 orders of magnitude larger than the standard reference value. stochiometric constraints imply that this also results in a significant reduction of the ch @ xmath9 abundance in the 870 950 @ xmath10k band in gl 229b . in group b , the equilibrium abundance of ch @ xmath9 at 900 @ xmath10k is @ xmath150 , which corresponds to the abundance of elemental carbon . the co abundance determined from the 4 . 5 @ xmath13 m band is @ xmath151 ( with a large error of ) . determination of the total number of carbon atoms also requires that the ch @ xmath9 abundance be @ xmath152 , a full factor of 2 above the co abundance . if we use the maximum co abundance determined from our analysis , a 25 % reduction of ch @ xmath9 relative to the co abundance at 900 @ xmath10k results . reduction of ch @ xmath9 at this level is only observed spectroscopically in the 2 . 5 and 4 . 5 @ xmath13 m bands , and possibly also in the 4 . 3 @ xmath13 m band if the non - equilibrium co abundance is at higher levels ( cf . after the@ xmath8o , ch @ xmath9 is the most important near infrared light source in gl 229b . detailed modeling of the system provides a detailed treatment of the non - equilibrium ch @ xmath9 spectrum . similarly , solid samples show the nh @ xmath3 # ##s from our @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 band spectra . while the @ xmath1 band abundance is in excellent agreement with the equilibrium spectrum , there is a significant depletion of nh @ xmath3 in the @ xmath2 band . the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 band spectra are marginally consistent with each other . it appears that the nh @ xmath3 abundance varies upwards through the spectrum . reactions which take place faster than the time scale of key chemical reactions can change the composition of the mixture away from equilibrium . the evolution of co / ch @ xmath9 chemistry has been well - studied in the atmosphere of mars where an overabundance of co is also present . carbon monoxyde is a tightly bound gas and the conversion of co to ch @ xmath9 through the ( schematic ) reaction @ xmath153 proceeds .2 , but the overall process is much faster . vertical transport , if vigorous enough , can transport co - rich gas from deeper layers upwards faster than the co to ch @ xmath9 reaction can take place . the co / ch @ xmath9 ratio at any level is given ( ` ` eddy ' ' ) by the condition @ xmath154 where @ xmath155 is the equilibrium reaction time scale and @ xmath156 the vertical transport time scale . wherever @ xmath157 indicates the presence of a sudden shift in the co abundance , non - equilibrium reactions will occur . as shown in @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite ( and discussed below ) , this naturally explains the very low co abundance observed at the 900 @ xmath10k level . in this case , co - rich gas would be transported upward from @ xmath158k . convection is the most common form of gas transport in the stellar atmosphere . in gl 229b the convection level remains at the pressure scale heights above the level where it was observed ( the area in fig . perhaps convective overshooting can transport gas to the convection level . @ xcite ( ` ` eddy ' '' as a slower , yet adequate , mechanism . the eddy transport ( or mixing ) time scale is complicated by the well known co molecule and the somewhat complicated chemical pathway between co and ch @ xmath9 . from @ xcite , we know that @ xmath159 to be years and could be much longer . in addition to the co / ch @ xmath9 ratio , a high nh @ xmath3 abundance can be produced by eddy transport which will quench the nh @ xmath3 / n @ xmath8 ratio at a temperature found in certain layers of the atmosphere . as it is accelerated upward , nh @ xmath8 is converted to nh @ xmath3 by the nh @ xmath160 the nh @ xmath8 ratio is very strongly bound , however , and this reaction proceeds extremely slowly at low temperatures , much more slowly than reaction ( 2 ) . thermochemical cycle ##s of the chemical reactions for conversion of n @ xmath8 to nh @ xmath3 were calculated as shown in @ xcite . the time scale for reaction ( 3 ) used the @ xmath71 model of models a , b , and c and for @ xmat##h161bar is given by @ xmath162 where @ xmath155 is the year , @ xmath163 is the temperature in k , and @ xmath27 is the specific heat in m / s @ xmath164 . this time scale indicates that the n @ xmath8 reaction occurs in the gas phase although it could also be achieved by catalysis at the surface of water . the time scale increases very steeply with increasing temperature . at the level probed in the @ xmath1 band , @ xmath165 and @ xmath166 and in the @ xmath2 band , @ xmath167 and @ xmath168 ! at the next level ( which depends on @ xmath27 ) , the time scale for the conversion of n @ xmath8 into nh @ xmath3 becomes shorter than the conversion of gl 229b . in view of the relatively very short reaction time scale inferred from the observed abundance , it follows that the nh @ xmath3 conversion in the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 bands is _ not _ determined under non - equilibrium conditions , _ not _see reaction ( below ) . at depths where @ xmath169 ( which corresponds to the top of the mixing zone ) , @ xmath170yr and the reaction is slow enough to reach an equilibrium between nh @ xmath3 and n @ xmath8 . we can expect that the nh @ xmath8 / nh @ xmath3 ratio will be quenched to a value at @ xmath171 , throughout the remainder of the atmosphere . while the time required for eddy mixing varies in the upper layers of the atmosphere , the extremely long @ xmath155 means that the nh @ xmath3 / nh @ xmath8 ratio remains unchanged , regardless of how quickly the vertical mixing occurs . for example b , this corresponds to @ xmath172 , in perfect agreement with the ratio found in the @ xmath1 band ( fig . 18b ) . while the abundance of nh @ xmath3 determined from the @ xmath2 band spectrum is not very clear , it is certainly consistent with vertical mixing . 1 shows that it is more likely that the @ xmath2 band abundance is smaller than that in the @ xmath1 band , too . onthe other hand , the factors shown in fig . 18 and figure 2 are independent factors which were applied directly to the chemical equilibrium abundance profile of nh @ xmath3 , which has a large vertical gradient . for comparison with the upper atmosphere picture , we took previously redetermined nh @ xmath3 abundances from a constant abundance in the atmosphere and found @ xmath173 and @ xmath174 from the @ xmath2 and @ xmath1 band spectra , respectively ( figure b ) . the former is in good agreement with our simple model while the @ xmath1 band abundance is still very low . the discrepancy between the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 band spectra thus disappears in this new model . changes in [ m / h ] and the @ xmath70 bands have no effect whatsoever . we consider the possibility that this vertical gradient in the nh @ xmath3 spectrum may be caused by a different chemical - equilibrium process such as the photolysis of nh @ xmath3 by the ultraviolet radiation from the primary sun . ammonia is a relatively fragile molecule which is easily damaged by uv photons : @ xmath175 witha photodissociation cross section of @ xmath176cm @ xmath164 per second , and a limit for the photodissociation of nh @ xmath3 are obtained at pressures of a few tens of gl 229b . photodissociation of the much more abundant h @ xmath8 molecules does not effectively protect nh @ xmath3 from the uv photons since the two molecules absorb in different wavelength ranges . photodissociation of nh @ xmath3 molecules causes a net sink of nh @ xmath3 which is at the very bottom of the spectrum . we can obtain a lower limit to the total period of photodissociation of nh @ xmath3 by assuming that each photodissociating photon results in the destruction of an nh @ xmath3 molecule . the incident photon flux is @ xmath178 where photons of dissociation of nh @ xmath3 are between @ xmath179 and @ xmath180 , @ xmath181 is the distance at the radius of the secondary star , @ xmath182 the radius of the primary star and @ xmath79 the separation ofthe solar system . for nh @ xmath3 , we have @ xmath183 and @ xmath184 ( see , priv . comm . ) . the primary star has a dm1 spectral type , with @ xmath185erg @ xmath10 @ xmath186s @ xmath88 @ xmath46 and @ xmath187 ##s @ xcite . the secondary star is @ xmath188au @ xcite . this results in @ xmath189 @ xmath186s @ xmath88 . photodissociation will affect only the nh @ xmath3 , when @ xmath190 where @ xmath84 is the column length of nh @ xmath3 . because the incident energy of uv photons is very low , this condition is met only at temperatures of a few kelvin , _ i . e . _ very low in the atmosphere . in the region of interest , photodissociation affects a very small amount of nh @ xmath3 during a unit time , and therefore has no effect on the abundance of nh @ xmath3 . photolysis ofnh @ xmath3 does not explain the very low nh @ xmath3 abundance we find in the @ xmath2 band spectrum . we assume that the difference between the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 band spectra of the nh @ xmath3 abundance arises from the limitations of the nh @ xmath3 opacity data available for the calculation of the synthetic abundance . as mentioned above , the calculation of the nh @ xmath3 band spectrum for @ xmath66k results in upper bounds for the nh @ xmath3 abundance obtained by averaging the data . since this effect increases with time , we expect that the abundance determined from the @ xmath1 band spectrum is overestimated compared to the one determined from the @ xmath2 band spectrum , which is what we find . until nh @ xmath3 data become available for @ xmath191 1200 @ xmath10k , we will not be able to explain this phenomenon . figures 6 and 7 show that ammonia offers a small window of opportunity for the determination of the abundance . the region between 12 . 3 and 12 . 4 @ xmath13 m is rich in the nh@ xmath3 ) , the two peaks being at 10 . 30 and 10 . 40 @ xmath13 . ( fig . this spectral region is a lower level of the atmosphere ( @ xmath192k ) where the two peaks of nh @ xmath3 which are missing from the data bases are less problematic than in the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 bands . in this spectral region , the atmosphere is very sensitive to the nh @ xmath3 / nh @ xmath8o ratio , and for nh @ xmath3 abundances below 25 % of the equilibrium value ( ) . this would be a good indication of the degree of nh @ xmath3 abundance in the upper level of the atmosphere . we estimate that ( @ xmath13 ##k ) should have a nh @ xmath3 abundance of @ xmath193 % of the equilibrium value . with the availability of extensive optical , astrometric , and spectroscopic data , our understanding of the spectrum of gl 229b is gradually becoming more sophisticated and more comprehensive . the recent discovery of ch @ xmath9 in the spectrum makes it appart and has prompted the developmentof a different spectral class , the t dwarf . h @ xmath8o , h , h i , and h i have also been discovered . there is good evidence that the rapid expansion of the star at visible wavelengths is caused by unprecedently # ##ening of the heavy metals @ xcite . the presence of condensates may also play a role in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b . it is possible that the surface gravity of gl 229b remains poorly constrained . we have not been able to further extend the observed range with our new @ xmath0 , @ xmath1 , and @ xmath2 spectroscopy . as a result , all our measurements are made as a function of gravity . this is the most significant contribution to further progress in elucidating the astrophysics of this white dwarf . the surface gravity can only be determined from the measurement of the slightly restricted range of molecular bonds . we have found no evidence for the presence of h @ xmath3 in the spectrum of gl 229b , which was derived from chemical equilibrium measurements . we have been able to determine its presence at two different levels of the spectrum , and we find a significant deviation from chemical equilibrium . a similar phenomenon has been observed withas previously @ xcite and this convection pattern can be explained by vertical mixing of the atmosphere . the size of the convection pattern is not sufficient to account for the mixing we find and the mixing may be due to overshooting or to more efficient eddy ##ing . we know that nh @ xmath3 photolysis was very important in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b . because nh @ xmath3 can be observed in three different bands corresponding to three different depths in the atmosphere , an accurate determination of its abundance in each band provides information about the time scale of mixing as a function of depth . this is an unusual and powerful diagnostic tool which can provide valuable clues for determining the vertical mixing of possible condensates . in principle , any molecule with a vertical abundance gradient in the upper part of the atmosphere can be used to determine the details of the mixing pattern . among large and abundant molecules , only co and nh @ xmath3 satisfy this criterion . chemical kinetic ##s with rainout of nh @ xcite show that we can expect large vertical gradients in the abundance of the co , rb , cs , and na as they are dissolved in solution ( kcl , rbcl , cscl and na @ xmath8s, 3 ) in the cooler , upper regions of the spectrum . sodium and potassium have been detected in the structure of gl 229b , and the doublets of ni ##o and na ii appear to shape the overall spectrum . however , the detection timescales for alkali metals are so short that they should not be in chemical equilibrium ( lodders 1999 ) . therefore , they do not serve as probes of vertical mixing in gl 229b . further progress in determining the structure of gl 229b reveals higher values for ch @ xmath9 and nh @ xmath3 , and , to a lesser extent , of h @ xmath8o . a more accurate determination of the co abundance from 4 @ @ xmath13 m spectroscopy is more difficult and will have higher signal - to - noise ratios than is currently available . similarly , 4 @ xmath13 m spectroscopy to determine the h @ xmath3 abundance for @ xmath194bar , while difficult , is important . the issue of vertical mixing and departure from chemical equilibrium gains importance when we realize that the observed departure of co from chemical equilibrium implies a significantly higher ch @ xmath9 abundance , and that ofthe abundance of molecular nitrogen . thus , our results show that nh @ xmath3 absorption in the 10 @ xmath13 m range is high . because ch @ xmath9 is a strong star in the near infrared , as is nh @ xmath3 in the 10 @ xmath13 m range , departures from this must be taken into account when accurate analysis of the composition and spectrum of gl 229b is desired . this high level of complexity compounds the difficulties and the challenges faced by t dwarfs . the atmosphere of gl 229b is much hotter than has been originally thought . gl 229b is currently the only t dwarf known to exist in a binary system . there is no evidence that the radiation from the primary star has a significant effect on the state of its atmosphere and gl 229b is most likely composed of isolated t dwarfs . it remains the brightest and by far the most studied of the six t dwarfs currently known , but the list should expand to the next during the year 2 3 3 @ xcite . the large body of work on gl 229b leads to the most detailed observations to conduct on t dwarfs . the possibility of studying trends in the physics of t dwarf atmospheres as a function ofthis temperature is a promising value . we thank m . guillot for the programs which are so useful to our analysis , m . schmidt for sharing data on the photolysis of nh @ xmath3 in giant stars , and m . noll and m . schmidt for sharing their results . we are grateful to the staff of the united kingdom royal observatory , which is supported by the joint astronomy programme , on behalf of the uk atomic physics and engineering research council . this work was supported in part by uk grants ast -
