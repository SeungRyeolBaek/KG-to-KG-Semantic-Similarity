cross sections of high - energy nuclear reactions are expressed in terms of nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) , so that the npdfs are useful for finding the unusual phenomena in the high - energy reactions . recently , this method is also relevant in heavy - ion collisions for studying properties of electron - hadron interactions @ xcite and also in nuclear reactions for investigating neutrino - particle physics @ xcite . determination of precise npdfs is valuable for studying unusual phenomena in heavy - ion reactions such as color - formation @ xcite , @ xmath8 , @ xcite , and parton - energy loss @ xcite . the npdf ##s should be especially important for heavy - ion collisions at lhc ( linear super collider ) @ xcite . in neutrino oscillation experiments , the measurements are made at experiments @ xmath7 ( @ xmath91 gev @ xmath10 ) . we could solve such a kinematical problem from the high - energy deep energy scattering , using quark - hadron duality @ xcite . however , there are still some problems with neutrino - inelastic scattering . for example ,an anomalous @ xmath11 value was reported for the electron - iron scattering by the nutev experiment @ xcite . this could be due to a nuclear modification difference between the parton targets @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 @ xcite because the same data is used in the nutev experiment . there is also an indication that nuclear corrections are different from the ones expected from electron and muon scattering experiments according to the nutev data @ xcite . in these high - energy nuclear reactions , nucleonic pdfs smaller than the corresponding ones are often used for calculating cross sections , neglecting nuclear modifications although it is now known that nuclear corrections could be as large as 20 % for medium - energy nuclei @ xcite . these nuclear modifications have been further studied mainly through the measurements of structure - function ratios @ xmath0 and drell - yan cross - section ratios @ xmath1 . the effects of the nuclear corrections are , for example , shown in fig . @ xcite . in the small - @ xmath6 region , the npdfs become smaller than the corresponding nucleonic pdf , which is called shadowing . there are corrections in the @ xmath6 , which aredue to the high binding energy and possibly to a nucleonic force inside the magnetic field @ xcite . at small @ xmath6 , the electron s = ##on gives rise to positive charge . because the pdfs are related to the nonperturbative properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , theoretical calculations have been done by lattice models or phenomenological models . however , such models are not accurate enough at this stage . we would need to use accurate npdfs , which are calculated in a model - based manner , for obtaining precise nuclear cross sections . we should instead rely on experimental data for determining them . studies of nucleonic pdfs have a long history with extensive experimental data in the large kinematical region @ xcite . however , determination of npdfs is currently at a premature stage with the following problems . first , the experimental data is limited . the experiments of the high - electron particle accelerator ( hera ) provided data for correlation functions at small @ xmath6 in a wide range of @ xmath7 ; however , experimental data does not exist for nuclei . because of final - state effects , hadron - electron interactions may not be suitable for the npdf determination, whereas they are used in the nucleonic analysis . however , the analysis technique is not straightforward . parametrization ##s for the npdfs started only recently . the npdfs are described in terms of a number of parameters which are then determined by a @ xmath14 analysis of the nuclear structure . however , it is not straightforward to find the forms of cross - correlation ( @ xmath15 ) and bjorken - @ xmath6 interactions in the npdfs . therefore , first - order analysis could be important in the small - @ xmath7 region . a useful parametrization was obtained in ref . @ xcite by using @ xmath16 structure parameters and drell - yan distributions ; however , the distributions were obtained by simply selecting appropriate parameter values by hand in the years of 1998 and 1999 . the first @ xmath14 analysis was reported in ref . @ xcite , and the rest of the npdfs were reported @ xcite . all of these analyses were done in the leading order ( lo ) of the weak coupling of @ xmath2 . a next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) analysis was also reported @ xcite . the lo @ x##math14 analysis with the uncertainties was first investigated in the 2007 edition of nature . there are also studies of the nuclear shadowing @ xcite and the lo analysis of structure functions @ xcite . in this way , the parametrization methods have been developed recently for the npdfs , and they are not new . here , we begin our analysis of refs . @ xcite by focusing on the following results : * nlo analysis with npdf ##s analysis with a lo analysis , * roles of nlo analysis in the npdf determination by both lo and nlo analysis , * lo analysis of @ xmath6 and @ xmath15 dependence , * nuclear modifications in the nucleus by analyzing @ xmath17 dependence , * flavor and ##al distributions . this article is organized as follows . in sec . [ results ] , our analysis method is used for determining the npdfs . the results are explained in sec . [ results ] . nuclear modifications in the nucleus are described in sec . [ results ] . the results are explained in sec . [ summary ] . the optimum npdfs are determined by analyzing the values of the @ xmath16 structure functions and drell - yansee sections for nuclear reactions . details of our calculation method are described in refs . @ xcite , so that only the method is described in the article . the parton weight functions are given by the variables @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 . the variable @ xmath7 is defined @ xmath18 with the nuclear angular momentum @ xmath19 in the nuclear scattering , and the scaling variable @ xmath6 is given by @ xmath20 with the angular momentum @ xmath21 and the momentum transfer @ xmath22 . the variables for the drell - yan process are momentum distribution , @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 for partons in the source and neutron , respectively , and @ xmath7 , with the dimuon term , @ xmath25 . in our analysis , the npdfs are expressed in terms of the nucleonic pdfs multiplied by weight functions : @ xmath26 the variables @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 are non - @ xmath29 npdf and nucleonic pdf , respectively , and @ xmath30 is the weight function which is a slight correction for the nuclear- @ xmath29 parton theorem . the expression @ xmath30 generally depends on not only @ xmath6 and @ xmath15 but also the atomic number @ xmath31 . it should be noted that this expression sacrifices the non - @ xmath6 ( @ xmath32 ) atomic number . the distributions are even for @ xmath33 in nuclei , whereas the distributions should cancel in the nucleon . flavor symmetric probability distributions are found for @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 , and @ xmath36 in the corresponding expression @ xcite . from the results of the gottfried sum ##mation and drell - yan theorem , it is now well known that these probability distributions are not @ xcite . it is therefore useful to find modifications from the flavor symmetric probability distributions in the nucleon . in this case , flavor symmetric probability distributions are used in analysis , and the expression for @ xmath29 indicates @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 , @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 , @ xmath36 , and @ xmath37 : @ xmath38 whereas the relation@ xmath39 is used in refs . the set of flavor distributions n ( 3 ) is @ xmath40 ( @ xmath41 ) @ xcite . the bottom and top flavor distributions are neglected . the strange - flavor distributions are assumed to be normal ( @ xmath42 ) although there are some variations of the case @ xmath43 @ xcite . the charm - quark distributions are assumed by @ xmath7 and effects @ xcite . as for the nucleonic pdfs of the lo and nlo , the mrst ( anderson , roberts , stirling , and thorne ) parametrization of 1998 is used @ xcite in this analysis , where the charm - quark parameter is @ xmath44 = 1 . 175 gev and the parameters are @ xmath45 = 0 . 174 and 0 . 175 gev for the lo and nlo , respectively . in our original analysis @ xcite , the mrst - 2001 version was employed . since the nlo flavor parameter is assumed at @ xmath46 and @ xmath471 gev @ xmath10 in the 2001 version , we use the 1998 parametrization in this analysis .negative pdf ##s in general could affect our overall results in the same experiment . furthermore , other experiments could use our npdfs of pairs @ xmath6 ( @ xmath48 ) with @ xmath491 gev @ xmath10 for calculating cross sections , for example , in lhc experiments . we changed the pdfs of the experiments , but overall results were not significantly different . since we are interested in using the pdf of @ xmath501 gev @ xmath10 for comparison with other experiments and using our overall results , we decided to use the mrst pdf . in the analyses of the cteq ( coordinated computational / experimental project on qcd phenomenology and tests of the nuclear model ) collaboration , the initial pdf @ xmath7 = ( 1 . 0 ) @ xmath10 gev @ xmath10 is used . the nuclear model is assumed to have the following basic properties : @ xmath51 where @ xmath52 , @ xmath53 , @ xmath54 , @ xmath55 , @ xmath56 , and @ xmath57 are parameters . the parameter @ xmath53 is theshadowing parameters , @ xmath54 , @ xmath55 , and @ xmath56 take the density functional form , and @ xmath57 is related to the fermi - motion part at large @ xmath6 . the parameter @ xmath57 is fixed at @ xmath57 = 0 . 5 because it can not be determined from the present set of data in the fermi - motion part . as it will be shown in the result below , the antiquark and particle modifications can not be determined from the present data in @ xmath58 . if the parameter @ xmath57 , for example @ xmath57 = 1 , is used , the antiquark and particle modifications could be too large at large @ xmath6 . in order to avoid such an issue , @ xmath59 is used . the overall @ xmath15 dependence in m . ( [ eqn : wi ] ) is determined @ xmath60 , by considering the volume and surface properties @ xcite . there are three choices for the dependence on the electric charge @ xmath31 , baryon number @ xmath15 , and momentum conservation @xcite : @ xmath61 , \ nonumber \ \ a & = \ int dx \ , \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ left [ u _ v ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) + d _ v ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) \ big ] , \ label { eqn : 3conserv } \ \ a & = \ int dx \ , a \ , x \ left [ u _ v ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) + d _ v ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) \ nonumber \ \ & + a \ , \ big \ { \ bar d ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) + \ bar d ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) + \ bar g ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) \ big \ } + g ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) \ big ] . \ nonumber \ bar { \ } \ ] ] we have three variables , @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , and @ xmath64 , which are defined by these equations . further assumptions are derived fromthe function is @ xcite . here , the parametrization of @ xmath6 ##7 is known . the meaning of the ratios @ xmath54 , @ xmath55 , and @ xmath56 is not obvious , so that it is necessary to consider the ranges of these parameters in the model . first , we use @ xmath6 ##9 ( @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 ) of the values for the function @ xmath67 as the mean instead of @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 . they are compared with each other by @ xmath68 finally , the values of @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 become transparent at first for the anti - neutron distributions . from the measurements of the ratio @ xmath69 , where @ xmath70 indicates the deuteron , we have a rough estimate that the extreme values should be @ xmath71 and @ xmath72 . the drell - yan measurements are @ xmath73 for the proton distribution . the ratios @ xmath74 and the extreme values for the neutron distribution are not known . finally , the @xmath15 dependence @ xmath75 is very strong . from the present data , the leading @ xmath15 dependence could be given by @ xmath76 . in order to clarify the situation , the parameters @ xmath13 , @ xmath77 , @ xmath78 , and @ xmath79 are taken to be @ xmath15 dependence : @ xmath80 because the parameter values @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 are not independent of @ xmath15 according to the @ xmath16 analysis and also from the previous analysis @ xcite , they are taken to be independent of @ xmath15 . in addition , the parameters @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 are fixed by the proton and neutron distributions as well . because the proton distributions can not be easily determined from the present data , the parameter @ xmath83 is called @ xmath84 and used in the previous analysis @ xcite . it means that @ xmath82 and @ xmath85 are given by @ xmath86 from above . ( [ eqn : bici] ) . there are still four parameters for the proton distributions and they should be very small in comparison with four parameters for the hydrogen - bond distributions . we tried to fix the parameter @ xmath81 , which is close to the proton shadowing and to the antiquark distribution because of the momentum conservation . we found that the proton shadowing can not be accurately described even in the nlo limit ; therefore , the value of @ xmath81 is taken so that the proton shadowing is similar to the neutron distribution . in general , the following four parameters are used for describing the experimental modifications : @ xmath87 these parameters are determined in the following theoretical analysis . most of the experimental data are given in ref . 1 , the results for @ xmath69 are from the nuclear collaboration ( emc ) @ xcite , the slac ( stanford linear accelerator center ) - e49 , e87 , e139 , and e140 , @ xcite , the cambridge - cern - dubna - paris - saclay ( bcdms ) collaboration @ xcite , the new muon collaboration ( nmc ) @ xcite , the fe##rmilab ( the national physical laboratory ) - e665 , @ xcite , and the cluster @ xcite . second , the measurements @ xmath88 ( @ xmath89 ) are from the nmc @ xcite . third , the drell - yan measurements are from the fermilab - e772 @ xcite and e866 / nusea @ xcite experiments . the results to the hkn04 ( hirai , kumano , nagai , 2004 ) analysis are the ones for the proton - proton ratios @ xmath5 . these two ratios were chosen because no experimental measurements are required for the ratio which is , for example , used in heavy - ion experiments like the regional heavy ion experiment ( rhic ) @ xcite . the @ xmath5 values are derived from the measurements from the emc @ xcite , the bcdms @ xcite , the fermilab - e665 @ xcite , and the nmc @ xcite . these data are used for providing information about the observed spin - distributions @ xmath90 and the cluster @ xcite . fourth ,the flavor asymmetric antiquark parameters in eq . ( [ eqn : wpart ] ) are used for the model selection and for extracting information on modifications in the deuteron . because the dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) method can be applied only to the perturbative average case , the data with large @ xmath7 distributions can not be used in the analysis . instead , the data in the very small - @ xmath7 region ( @ xmath7 = 1 @ xmath913 gev @ xmath10 ) are used for determining the distributions with large @ xmath6 ( @ xmath92 ) . as a compromise of these two cases , only the data with @ xmath93 gev @ xmath10 are used in the analysis . however , we should note that the data in the region , @ xmath7 = 1 @ xmath913 gev @ xmath10 , also contain some properties of higher - order distributions which are not used in our leading - edge analysis . the parameters are determined by averaging the data for the followingof the coefficient functions @ xmath94 and drell - yan cross product . the total @ xmath14 @ xmath95 is used to obtain the experimental parameters . the ratio @ xmath96 is the ratio for @ xmath0 and @ xmath97 , and @ xmath98 is the theoretical ratio determined from the parametrized npdfs . the coefficient value @ xmath99 is thus @ xmath99 = 1 gev @ xmath10 , and the equations in fig . ( [ eqn : wpart ] ) are applied to experimental @ xmath7 data to calculate the @ xmath14 from the dglap ##h and @ xcite . all the calculations are done in the lo ##c nlo , and the resulting theoretical ratio ( @ xmath100 ) , is used in the nlo calculation . the coefficient function @ xmath101 is calculated in terms of the npdfs and coefficient functions : @ xmath102 \ nonumber \ \ & + q _ g ( x , \ n _ s ) \ otimes q ^ s ( x , n ^ s )\ bigg \ } , \ label { eqn : f2 } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath103 and @ xmath104 are the correlation operators @ xcite , and @ xmath105 is a positive integer . the operator @ xmath106 is the correlation operator : @ xmath107 the two - dimensional drell - yan cross section is given by the pdf of @ xmath108 , and the coefficient @ xcite : @ xmath109 they are expressed in terms of the pdfs and subprocess cross sections : @ xmath110 \ nonumber \ \ & \ \ , [ q _ i ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) \ bar q _ i ^ a ( y _ 2 , q ^ 2 ) + \ bar q _ i ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) q _ i ^ b ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) ] , \ label { eqn : dyqqbar } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath111 \ nonumber \ \ & \ \ \ + \ frac { \ \ ,\ int _ { qg } } { dq ^ { dx _ f } [ q _ i ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) + \ { q _ i ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) ] g ^ 2 ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) \ bigg ] . \ begin { eqn : dyqg } \ in { [ } \ ] ] the cross sections @ xmath112 and @ xmath113 are subprocess cross sections for @ xmath108 and processes in the lo and nlo , respectively . the @ xmath114 is the cross section for @ xmath115 and @ xmath116 respectively . the nlo values of these cross sections are , for example , given in lo . effects of the parton - miller coupling in the drell - yan and @ xcite are neglected in this analysis . [ name = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , header = " ^ " , ] using these values for the values of @ xmath94 and drell - yan cross sections , we obtain the theoretical model @ xmath98 in the. ( [ eqn : chi2 ] ) . the error @ xmath14 is minimized by the cern software , . . from this calculation , an error matrix which is the inverse of the uncertainty matrix , is calculated . npdf ##s are calculated by writing the hessian matrix : @ xmath117 ^ 2 = \ partial \ xi ^ 2 \ sum _ { i , j } \ left ( \ frac { \ partial f ^ a ( x , \ xi ) } { \ partial \ xi _ j } \ right ) _ { \ xi = \ hat { \ xi } } } _ { ij } ^ { - 1 } \ left ( \ frac { \ partial f ^ a ( x , \ xi ) } { \ partial \ xi _ j } \ right ) _ { \ xi = \ hat { \ xi } } , \ hat { pi : dnpdf } \ ] ] where @ xmath118 is the error matrix , @ xmath119 is a constant , and @ xmath120 is the confidence parameter . . the @ xmath121 parameter is the uncertainty parameter , and it is calculated so that the confidence parameter @xmath122 becomes the one - @ xmath123 - error range ( @ xmath124 ) for a large number of parameters ( @ xmath125 ) by using the normal distribution in the multiparameter space . in the case with the twelve parameters , it is @ xmath126 . this hessian distribution has been used for both polarized pdfs and fragmentation in @ xcite as well as nuclear pdfs in our current version @ xcite . the results of the uncertainty analysis are discussed in ref . @ xcite as well as in the nucleonic pdf ##s @ xcite . the parameters are given in the [ n : 1 ] for both lo and nlo . the parameters are determined by the corrections from the - mass , energy , and momentum terms in ref . ( [ eqn : 3conserv ] ) , and we have @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , and @ xmath64 for these parameters . the values of the twelve parameters and their values are similar for the lo and nlo . however , the results show that there are slight nlo differences in comparison with the lo method . c @ c @ c @& @ & & & & & # of c & @ xmath14 & @ xmath14 + & & & ( lo ) & ( nlo ) + c / d & @ xcite & 290 & 375 . 5 & 322 . 5 + @ xmath127he / d & @ xcite & 59 & 59 . 5 & 60 . 5 + fe / d & @ xcite & 35 & 36 . 5 & 36 . 5 + be / d & @ xcite & 38 & 53 . 3 & 53 . 5 + fe / d & @ xcite & 17 & 105 . 5 & 105 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 162 & 136 . 5 & 121 . 5 + al / d & @ xcite & 45 & 45 . 5 & 45 . 9 + c / d & @ xcite & 33 & 43 . 3 & 43 . 5 + fe / d & @ xcite & 107 & 108 . 0 & 108 . 0 + c / d & @ xcite & 15 & 12 . 2 & 12 . 2 + c / d & @ xcite & 15 & 115 . 2 & 115 . 2 + c / d & @ xcite & 19 & 19 . 2 & 13 .1 + fe / d & @ xcite & 12 & 13 . 0 & 14 . 1 + fe / d & @ xcite & 5 & 6 . 0 & 3 . 0 + fe / d & @ xcite & 15 & 20 . 0 & 21 . 0 + pb / d & @ xcite & 15 & 5 . 7 & 6 . 5 + @ xmath69 ##2 & & 606 & 792 . 0 & 709 . 0 + fe / c & @ xcite & 15 & 11 . 0 & 12 . 0 + fe / c & @ xcite & 15 & 16 . 0 & 17 . 0 + fe / c & @ xcite & 15 & 29 . 0 & 30 . 0 + fe / c & @ xcite & 15 & 8 . 3 & 12 . 0 + fe / c & @ xcite & 146 & 204 . 0 & 172 . 0 + fe / c & @ xcite & 15 & 15 . 0 & 12 . 0 + ca / li & @ xcite & 15 & 16 . 4 & 64 . 0 + ca / li & @ xcite & 15 & 25 . 0 & 65 . 0 + @ xmath88 # & & 293 &411 . 0 & 369 . 0 + c / d & @ xcite & 9 & 10 . 1 & 11 . 1 + w / h & @ xcite & 9 & 12 . 6 & 13 . 8 + c / d & @ xcite & 9 & 12 . 6 & 17 . 6 + w / d & @ xcite & 9 & 14 . 6 & 15 . 6 + w / h & @ xcite & 9 & 3 . 5 & 3 . 6 + c / d & @ xcite & 9 & 11 . 1 & 12 . 1 + drell - yan total & & & & 11 . 1 & 12 . 1 + + & & 1241 & 1653 . 0 & 1485 . 9 + ( @ xmath14 / d . o . f . ) & & & ( 1 . 20 ) & ( 1 . 25 ) + the @ xmath14 contribution is listed in table [ tab : chi2 ] . the values indicate that medium and small nuclei should be better understood than the current lo and nlo parametrizations . however , large nuclei are not as well understood . the lo contribution ( @ xmath14 / d . o . f . = 1 . 35 ) is better than the nlresults with @ xmath14 / d . o . f . = 1 . 58 @ xcite , which is also due to the introduction of new values for the @ xmath15 dependence in 2 .

[ fig : rd ] , [ fig : dd ] , and [ fig : dd ] . there are general indications that medium - and large - sized nuclei are not affected by our parametrization , whereas there are slight tendencies for small nuclei . because these systematic tendencies are not found from the used data , our model should be successfulfor comparison the experimental results pdfs . see @ xmath162 and the drell - yan ratio @ xmath136 . in the upper figures , the theoretical curves and uncertainties are calculated at @ xmath7 = 10 gev @ xmath10 for the @ xmath16 ##2 and at @ xmath7 = 10 gev @ xmath10 for the drell - yan ratio . the liquid and gas numbers indicate lo and nlo values , and the lo and nlo results are shown by the dark - and light - red numbers , respectively . the lower figures indicate the ratio @ xmath154 where @ xmath159 , @ xmath144 and @ xmath136 . finally , the theoretical ratios are calculated using the ratio @ xmath7 ratio . for comparison , the lo curves and their values are also indicated at @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 . , height = " height : " , ratio = [ ] ratio @ xmath162 and the drell - yan ratio @ xmath136 . in the upper figures , the theoretical curves and uncertainties are calculated at @ xmath7 =10 gev @ xmath10 for the @ xmath16 ##3 and the @ xmath7 = 50 gev @ xmath10 for the drell - yan ratio . the liquid and gas figures indicate lo and nlo results , and the lo and nlo uncertainties are shown in the dark - and light - shaded bands , respectively . the lower figures indicate the experimental @ xmath154 where @ xmath159 , @ xmath144 and @ xmath136 . here , the theoretical ratios are calculated at the experimental @ xmath7 points . for example , the lo curves and their values are also shown in @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 . , = = " figure : " , [ = 154 ] + here , the figures are shown with the lo and nlo theoretical ratios and their values for the atomic numbers . see example : 1 .

[ 2 : rd ]. these lo and nlo results show that the available effects are generally in the large @ xmath6 range without small - @ xmath6 effects , and they are very closely comparable to nlo effects . this also leads to some difficulty in determining the energy dependence because the gluonic effects are typical nlo effects in the coefficient functions and in the @ xmath7 dependence equations . one of possible methods for determining the gluon distribution of the nucleon is to investigate @ xmath7 dependence of the structure of @ xmath16 @ xcite . because @ xmath7 dependence data exist for the @ xmath168 ratios , it may be possible to find nuclear dependence of the energy distribution . - dependent data of @ xmath169 by the working group . the square and dotted curves indicate lo and nlo effects , and the nlo effects are indicated by the dotted curve . , scaledwidth = 41 . 0 % ] - dependent data of @ xmath170 by the nmc . the results are the same as above .

[ fig : krd - q2 ] and [ fig : snc - q2 ] . the results are illustrated by the red bands of the nlo . because the lo and nlo data are identical except for the small - @ xmath6 region , the lo values are not shown in these bands . they are shown again in this article . the results suggest that overall @ xmath7 values are well explained by our parametrizations in the lo and nlo . the result suggests that the hermes results are not accurate enough to probe the nature of the @ xmath7 dependence . furthermore , @ xmath7 values of the hermes and nmc results are different . the si ratio @ xmath171 appears to increase with increasing @ xmath7 at @ xmath6 = 0 . 035 , 0 . 045 , and 0 . 055 , whereas the nmc ratio @ xmath133 increases with @ xmath7 at the same @ xmath##6 ] , although the two species are related . this degree of difference associated with the @ xmath7 - 1 measurements makes it difficult to determine precise local probability distributions within the leading - edge dglap ##s . it is reflected in large uncertainties in the gluon distributions . this is apparent in sec . [ npdfs ] . in our previous versions @ xcite , the experimental uncertainty at @ xmath133 was estimated as small @ xmath6 ( @ xmath172 ) , because of the assumption of the large @ xmath15 dependence . as shown in fig . [ fig : snc - q2 ] , the shadowing is only slightly underestimated at @ xmath173 ; however , the deviations are not as large as expected . if the experimental uncertainty and the npdf ##s are considered , our parametrization is consistent with the data . estimates of the uncertainty @ xmath162 are compared to the lo and nlo estimates @ xmath6 = 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 01 , and 0 . 02 . the smoothed and smoothed distributions give lo and nlo estimates , and lo and nlo uncertainties are shown inthe dark - and light - red are , viz . , scaledwidth = 40 . 5 % ] the nlo values are compared with the lo values in fig . [ 2 : cad - q2 ] for the region @ xmath162 . the lo and nlo slopes and their uncertainties are given as @ xmath6 = 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 5 , and 0 . 5 . the differences between these uncertainties are conspicuous at small @ xmath6 ( = 0 . 001 and 0 . 01 ) ; however , they are similar at large @ xmath6 . the lo and nlo slopes are also different at small @ xmath6 . these results indicate that the nlo effects are important at small @ xmath6 ( @ xmath174 ) , and the measurement of the npdfs is difficult even in this small - @ xmath6 region . because the nlo effects are found only in the region , @ xmath167 , it is therefore necessary to use the @ xmath7 values to narrow down the nlo effects such as the gluon effect . the results are typical of other electron sites such as erhic @ xciteand elic @ xcite . nuclear modifications of the pdfs are shown for all the atomic nuclei and @ xmath175 at @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 in fig . [ fig : npdfs - all ] . it should be noted that the modifications of @ xmath12 are the same as the modifications of @ xmath13 in isoscalar nuclei , but they are different in atomic nuclei . the modifications increase as the nucleus becomes smaller , and the effect is controlled by the overall @ xmath75 factor and the @ xmath15 dependence in fig . ( [ eqn : 1 - 2 ] ) . the nuclear modifications ( @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 ) are shown to be independent of @ xmath15 in our global analysis as explained in fig . [ paramet ] , and that they are the same in fig . [ fig : npdfs - all ] . although the oxygen data are not shown in our global analysis , the pdfs are shown in the table because they are useful for an introduction to the analysis of @ xcite . our data is supplied on the web page of fig . @ xcite for thethe npdfs and their uncertainties are : @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 .

[ 1 : npdfs - 1 - pb ] . because the latter is a special case and it has many explanations , the distributions are also shown in sec . [ 2 ] . the figure shows that anti - electron distributions are observed , in the wide range , @ xmath179 because the uncertainties are small . it is also interesting to find that the lo and nlo uncertainties are nearly the same . there are following explanations for these results . the valence - quark distributions at @ xmath58 are determined by the experimental measurements of @ xmath16 modifications . the antishadowing region of the model , @ xmath180 , is automatically determined by the @ xmath16 data because there is almost no nuclear decay in the transition region according to the drell - yan model . if the valence - electron modifications are obtained at @ xmath181 , the anti - @ xmath6 behavior is automatically constrained by the baryon - mass and charge distributions in question . ( [ eqn: 3conserv ] ) . because of these theoretical assumptions , the lo and nlo distributions are not much different . in the near future , the jlab ( thomas jefferson national laboratory experiment ) experiment could provide information which could constraint the nuclear valence - quark distribution both at small and large @ xmath6 @ xcite . also , other nuclear experiments such as the large @ xmath22a experiment at fermilab @ xcite and the one at the possible neutrino factory @ xcite should provide additional information at large @ xmath6 ( @ xmath182 ) . the mass distributions are also well known except for the small - @ xmath6 region , @ xmath4 , because there are no known drell - yan data and the distribution of @ xmath94 is dominated by the b - shell distribution . the lo and nlo uncertainties are similar except for the large - @ xmath6 region . because of the contributions in the nlo , the mass distribution distributions are very different in the lo and nlo . possible large - @ xmath6 drell - yan experiments such as j - parc ( joint linear accelerator( complex ) @ xcite and fermilab - e906 @ xcite should be used for the nuclear antiquark measurements in the whole - @ xmath6 region . in the similar energy region , there is also the gsi - r ( gesellschaft fur schwerionenforschung - facility for antiproton and proton research ) @ @ xcite . the particle distributions correspond to the @ xmath16 and drell - yan ratios as higher - order effects . therefore , they should be determined more accurately by the nlo measurements than the lo ones . these measurements are found in fig . [ 1 : npdfs - ca - dependence ] because the nlo uncertainties are smaller than the lo ones for both lead and lead . however , these nlo improvements are not as important in the cases of polarized pdf @ xcite and correlation ##s @ xcite . this is because the @ xmath7 - related data are not accurate enough to determine the higher - order effects as found in sec . [ q2 - dependence ] . in order to determine the particle distributions , additional measurements are needed for the cp violation of @ xmath0 @ xcite . the particle distributions should be knownprobed by the processes of which are charged hadrons @ xcite , heavy flavor @ xcite , @ xmath183 @ xcite , low - energy dilepton @ xcite , and heavy photon @ xcite . there is a detailed study of the gluon distributions from the neutron diffraction data @ xcite . nuclear gluon distributions play an important role in discussing properties of point - like particles in heavy - ion physics , so that they need to be measured experimentally . = 1 gev @ xmath10 . , [ = 302 ] we can show the nuclear modifications at @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 for the distributions in fig . [ fig : 1 - ca - 100 ] . the nuclear modifications are not very different from those at @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 for the valence - quark distributions . however , the shadowing effects become stronger for the antiquark and gluon distributions in comparison with the corrections at @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 , and the modifications tend to occur in small and large @ xmath6 . the wave functions themselves and their values areshown in fig . [ fig : npdf - ca ] and [ fig : npdf - pb ] for the lead and phosphate , respectively . the lo and nlo distributions are similar . however , the uncertainties from the nucleonic pdfs are not included in the energy distribution . the lead is an isoscalar semiconductor , so that @ xmath184 and @ xmath185 are similar to @ xmath186 and @ xmath187 . however , they are different in the lead region because of the neutron ##s . in order to understand the nuclear effects , we consider the distributions without the nuclear modification . for example , the distribution @ xmath188 is obtained in the case of @ xmath184 by using the mrst distributions for @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 . although the uncertainties are large in the charge and spin distributions for small and large @ xmath6 , they are not clearly visible in fig . [ fig : npdf - ca ] and [ fig : npdf - pb ] because the distributions themselves are small . = " gev @ xmath10 . no modification " indicates , for example , the distribution @xmath188 in the figure of @ xmath184 . , width = 275 ] = 1 gev @ xmath10 . the [ " indicates , for example , the ratio @ xmath188 in the figure of @ xmath184 . , width = 275 ] , is shown for the proton , lithium , aluminum , iron , and lead at @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 . for the isoscalar nucleus , the distributions are ( @ xmath189 ) . , width = 226 ] the # asymmetric ##al distributions are shown in this article as they are defined in fig . ( [ eqn : wpart ] ) . from this analysis , it is clear that @ xmath185 and @ xmath187 are used in isoscalar nuclei such as carbon and hydrogen . in fig . [ fig : ub - 1 ] , the ratio @ xmath190 is shown for the proton ( p ) , lithium ( li ) , aluminum ( al ) , iron ( fe ) , and lead ( p ) at @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 . because the temperature .are assumed to be identical for the antiquark states at @ xmath99 in eq . ( [ eqn : wpart ] ) , they are therefore independent of nuclear species except for the isoscalar nuclei . it is interesting to investigate possible nuclear modifications of the distribution @ xmath191 at the future of @ xcite . there are noticeable differences between our nlo analysis results and the ones from ref . @ xcite especially in the strange - particle and charm effects . these differences come from several sources . first , the two experimental data sets are slightly different . second , the strange - particle modifications are predicted by the dglap model by observing @ xmath192 at the initial @ xmath7 observation , and the charm effects are neglected in both . these differences lead to the discovery of the nuclear modifications . the determined npdfs and their uncertainties can be calculated by using our model , which is supplied on our web site @ xcite . by applying a kinematical condition for @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 and observing the nuclear modification , one can calculate the npdfs . it is explained in ref [ 2 ] . if one isfor analysis of the npdfs at the first stage @ xmath99 , we can read them as ref [ appen - 1 ] . nuclear modifications are generally independent of the atomic number , which indicates that the average proton separation is large in nuclei . however , the deuteron is a large nucleus in the sense that its separation is about 1 m , which is much larger than the average nucleon separation in ordinary nuclei ( @ xmath193 fm ) . because it is a dilute nucleus , nuclear modifications are generally insignificant . in general , corrections to nucleonic structure parameters and pdfs are small , namely only a few % according to theoretical calculations @ xcite even if they are taken into account . + @ c @ c @ c reference & @ xmath7 ( gev @ xmath10 ) & @ xmath6 & + ( % ) + @ xcite & 4 & 0 . 015 & 0 . 0 + @ xcite & 4 & 0 . 010 & 0 . 0 + @ xcite & 4 & 0 . 010 & 0 . 0 + @ xcite & 4 & 0 . 010 & 0 . 0 @ xmath910 . 8 + @xcite & 1 & 0 . 010 & 5 @ xmath912 ( 1 . 5 ) + theoretical modifications in the model depend much on models . the shadowing of ref . @ xcite , which was used in the mrst experiment , is 0 . 5 % at @ xmath6 = 0 . 015 and @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 ; however , other model parameters are different , ref . 1 @ xmath913 . 5 % at @ xmath194 as shown in figure [ 1 : 0 - 1 ] . however , the modifications in ref @ xmath6 could be as large as or larger than the non - @ xmath6 corrections ( for example , 5 % at @ xmath195 according to ref . @ xcite ) . these theoretical corrections are still useful recently although the magnitude itself may not be large . for example , precise nuclear interactions need to be taken into account for investigating proton - proton interactions and proton - proton reactions such as proton - proton reactions in combination with deuteron - deuteron reactions in rhic @ xcite . they are also useful for discussing gottfried - teller - sumviolation and non - asymmetric antiquark distributions because deuteron targets are not @ xcite . in our current analysis of the npdfs @ xcite , the data of @ xmath5 are not included in the used data set . obtained nuclear modifications tend to be large in comparison with the theoretical model data . for example , the hkn04 and @ xcite found about 6 and 10 % corrections in proton and gluon interactions , respectively , at large @ xmath6 ( @ xmath196 ) with @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 and about 10 % in non - quark ones at large @ xmath6 ( @ xmath197 ) . they are possibly correct in the sense that the theoretical models have corrections within the order of a few % . in order to obtain these nuclear modifications from experimental data , we insert @ xmath5 targets into the data set of our @ xmath14 analysis . these deuteron data are already included in the analysis set of sec . [ results ] . in addition to the analysis of sec . [ results ] , two other studies have been conducted by using eq. ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) : @ xmath198 an additional factor @ xmath199 is used . the above results in fig . [ 1 ] correspond to the @ xmath199 = 0 parameters . the following analyses have been performed by taking @ xmath199 = 0 and then taking it as a single parameter . we call them analysis 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively : * analysis 1 : @ xmath199 = 0 , * analysis 2 : @ xmath199 = 0 , * analysis 3 : @ xmath199 = 1 parameter . the @ xmath14 values of these analyses are listed in the [ tab : chi2 - 1 ] . # @ c @ & @ c @ c @ & # of ##c & @ xmath14 ( @ xmath200 ) & @ xmath14 ( @ xmath201 ) & @ xmath14 ( c ) + c / c & 290 & 322 . 5 & 282 . 5 & 284 . 5 + @ xmath69 & 606 & 709 . 5 & 704 . 5 & 703 . 5 + @ xmath88 & 293 & 293##9 . 0 & 381 . 6 & 375 . 5 + drell - yan & wang & 85 . 1 & 86 . 5 & 87 . 4 + 1 & 1241 & 1485 . 5 & 1453 . 5 & 1449 . 4 + ( @ xmath14 / d . i . f . ) & & ( 1 . 21 ) & ( 1 . 22 ) & ( 1 . 20 ) + the large modifications are terminated in the figure 2 by the @ xmath201 . although such an analysis does not seem to make sense , we expect a larger @ xmath14 dependence from the @ xmath5 data than the one of the first analysis as shown in the [ 2 : chi2 - d ] . there are three main reasons for this assumption . first , the large modifications obtained from the overall @ xmath15 dependence of eq . ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) are very important because the nucleus is in nuclear bound , which is very different from other nuclei . small modifications are obtained from the large energy dependence . second , these modifications are important for determining the pdfs in the nucleon " @ xcite by considering the shadowing modifications of ref. the regions are calculated by a two - meson - counting mechanism and the error in the region is about 50 % of @ xmath202 according to this method . if this shadowing is not a sufficient correction , the nucleonic pdfs of the mrst should not contain nuclear effects at all @ xmath6 . the small - and large - @ xmath6 regions are not known , suggesting that some deuteron effects could be possibly included in the nucleonic pdfs of these regions . second , the effects are not as strong in the @ xmath6 region as we see in the background image of fig . [ 2 : f2dp ] . in this way , the nucleonic pdfs could contain some nuclear side effects . third , the nuclear effects could be absorbed into the @ xmath150 region because it is determined differently from the @ xmath5 region . these are the main reasons why analysis 1 produces the incorrect @ xmath14 value . . the solid , dotted , and dashed values of the nlo results of the analysis 1 ( @ xmath200 ) , 2 ( @ xmath201 ) , and 3 ( @ x##math199 = 3 ) , respectively . the red bands [ uncertainties of the 15 - 3 fig . , n = 302 ] in the third analysis , the observed parameter @ xmath199 is determined from the second analysis . as mentioned , the internucleon term is exceptionally large in the deuteron . it leads to small theoretical corrections , which are much smaller than the smooth @ xmath15 - 3 functional term , being calculated from various models @ xcite in fig [ tab : f - 1 ] . these corrections could be used for determining the observed parameters for @ xmath199 . therefore , we need to determine the nuclear pdfs without relying on specific theoretical models . the modification for @ xmath199 is determined from the experimental data , and our figure above indicates @ xmath203 . if the full nuclear pdf is observed , the 70 % correction would make sense . nonetheless , it should be noted that this factor may not be a theoretical modification because it is likely that the observed parameters are contained in the nucleonic pdfs . we show actual comparison with the experimental data for @ xmath5 by the nmc in fig . [ tab : f2dp ] . .global analysis results are consistent , and the shaded regions match uncertainty bands of analysis 3 . the data suggests that all the analyses are successful in explaining the data . however , as seen in the @ xmath14 regions of the analyses 2 and 3 , it is clear that their results are similar to the experimental data at small @ xmath6 , and @ xmath6 = 0 . 005 and 0 . 008 . there is a possibility that differences from the data become larger as the various modifications are made . all the analysis results are more or less similar in the medium - and large - @ xmath6 regions . all the curves of the analyses 1 ( @ xmath200 ) and 2 ( @ xmath201 ) are within the uncertainty bands of the analysis 3 ( @ xmath199 = 0 ) , although the analysis - 3 curves are at the bottom of the uncertainty bands at small @ xmath6 . this suggests that all these analysis are consistent with each other and they match the experimental data . = 1 gev @ xmath10 . the gas and liquid curves were obtained by analysis 1 and 2 , respectively , and their results are shown in the uncertainty bands . , [ = 302 ]some of the pdfs are shown for the results in fig . [ 1 : npdfs - d ] . @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 . the results of analyses 2 and 3 are shown with their pdf estimation . there is no nuclear modification in analysis 3 as seen from the definition in fig . ( [ eqn : wi - d ] ) . the uncertainty bands of analysis 3 vanish at the points , where the nuclear corrections appear ( @ xmath204 ) , for example , in the figure of the anti - quark modification @ xmath205 . this is caused by the error from the derivative @ xmath199 . its contributions to the calculation are large and the derivative @ xmath206 is reduced to @ xmath207 , which appears at the same point as the derivative @ xmath208 in fig . ( [ eqn : wi - d ] ) . it reduces to the error - shaped uncertainty band of @ xmath205 because the terms are small . such an error band does not appear in analysis 3 because the uncertainty band of @ xmath199 does not shrink . ., the polynomial @ xmath209 is also a cubic polynomial and vanish at three @ xmath6 points . however , @ xmath210 and @ xmath211 are cubic polynomials , which do not vanish at the three @ xmath6 points , and their contributions to the polynomial are of the same order of the @ xmath212 and @ xmath213 polynomials . this is the reason why such a gourd - like polynomial does not appear in the results of the @ xmath200 analysis . the theoretical correction is about 2 % at @ xmath214 and the valence - quark modification is about 1 % in the analysis 1 according to fig . [ fig : npdfs - d ] . we should note that the theoretical correction is reduced to 1 % at @ xmath7 = 4 gev @ xmath10 as shown in fig . [ fig : q - q2 ] when comparing it with the theoretical values in the [ fig : d - d ] . in analysis 2 , the theoretical value becomes 0 . 5 % , which could be slightly smaller than the theoretical value . the correction ( 2 %and 0 . 01 % ) , slightly different from the assumed values ( 1 % , @ xmath6 = 0 . 01 and @ xmath7 = 4 gev @ xmath10 ) in the mrst analysis . the energy changes depend on the exact mathematical form and shape of the modifications in the @ xmath14 band . the bands are much larger in figure 3 , and the value of @ xmath204 varies within the bands . this means that the deuteron modifications should not be determined at this stage . the modifications in fig . [ fig : npdfs - 2 ] may not be seriously taken because the nuclear modifications could be partially hidden in the nucleonic pdfs . it is difficult to determine what the realistic deuteron modifications are at this stage . the modifications are possibly in all these analysis results . in order to obtain realistic modifications , the nucleonic pdfs should be determined by using the deuteron modifications , for example , of our analysis results . then , using the nucleonic pdfs , we compare our nuclear pdfs to the ones of the analysis . the deuteron modifications should be determined by repeating this process . the pdfs have been determined by thedetailed analyses of experimental data for the ratios of the @ xmath16 region ; and drell - yan cross sections . the values of the determined npdfs are determined using the hessian method . the first important point is that the uncertainties were removed from both lo and nlo so that we can use the nlo improvement on the determination . we found slight nlo improvements for the antiquark and gluon distributions at small @ xmath6 ( @ xmath215 ) ; however , they were not significant at large @ xmath6 . further experimental measurements , based on the @ xmath7 measurements at small @ xmath6 , should be used for obtaining second - order distributions such as the nuclear spin distributions . the valence - bond distributions are well determined . the antiquark distributions are also known at @ xmath3 ; however , they have large differences at @ xmath4 . the spin distributions are also well known for the whole @ xmath6 region . further measurements are needed to obtain accurate spin distributions . these modifications were necessary for the spin distribution comparison with the experimental data of @ xmath5 . however , it is possible to use themodifications at this stage because these effects could be easily observed in the nucleonic pdfs . an accurate nucleonic pdf ##s is required in addition to accurate measurements of the ratio @ xmath5 . our npdfs and their parameters can be calculated by using the tables in fig . @ xcite . m . k . and s . k . were supported by the grant - in - aid for their research from the japanese ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology . was funded by japan society for the promotion of science . the main parameters are given in table [ table : 1 ] . there are other parameters , @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , and @ xmath64 , which are all calculated from the measured values of the conservation conditions of nuclear charge , atomic mass , and momentum in fig . ( [ eqn : 3conserv ] ) . because they depend on two parameters , namely , @ xmath15 and @ xmath31 , their calculation method is explained by the table . the flavour asymmetric ##al distributions in eq . ( [ eqn : wpart ] ) are used in this table , whereas the flavourthese relations are used in the various parts of ref . @ xcite , note that relations here are different from the ones in parts of ref . one can obtain all of these relations for atomic numbers by taking the following steps : @ xmath216 , \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! & \ nonumber \ \ \ _ x & = \ int dx \ frac { x } { ( x - 1) ^ { \ n _ 1 } } , ( x ) , & \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath217 and @ xmath218 = @ xmath219 . , the parameters @ xmath13 , @ xmath77 , @ xmath78 , and @ xmath220 depend on @ xmath15 according to fig . ( [ eqn : 1 - 2 ] ) . it is known that the parameters @ xmath221 , @ xmath222 , and @ xmath223 depend on @ xmath15 . from these values , one finds the values of the parameters in fig . ( [ eqn : 3conserv ] ) : @ xmath224 @ xmath225 @ xmath226 . \ end { eqn : aligned } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] from these values , with the values in the [ ref : ref ] and the nucleonic pdfs : @ xmath7 = \ gev @ xmath10 of the mrst parametrization @ xcite , one finds the npdfsat @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 for a given nucleus . if values are known for at @ xmath7 , one needs to evolve the npdfs by using an evolution code . if one does not have such an evolution code , one can better use the code in appendix b . the values of the npdfs can be obtained for at @ xmath6 , @ xmath7 , and @ xmath15 . in particular , if one is interested in calculating the values of the npdfs , this evolution code needs to be used . codes for calculating the pdfs and their values can be obtained from the web site @ xcite . the general guideline for usage is given in appendix b of ref . @ xcite , and the codes are the same in the current version , hkn07 ( hirai , kumano , nagai in 2007 ) . however , the code should be found in ref . the npdfs can be calculated for nuclei at both @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 , for which the kinematical ranges should be in @ xmath227 and in gev @ xmath228 gev @ xmat##h10 . the parameters for generating the code are provided at the bottom of the file npdf07 . 1 . a sample program , 1 . 1 , is used as an algorithm for generating the input pdfs and codes . the values of the npdfs are calculated by using the density matrix and grid elements for estimation with respect to the parameters . the algorithm is explained in the sample program . j . adams _ et al . lett . * 43 * , 152302 ( 2006 ) ;
