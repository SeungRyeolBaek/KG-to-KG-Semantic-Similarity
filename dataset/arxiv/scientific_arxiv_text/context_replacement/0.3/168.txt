the main objective of the efar project ( wegner 1996 ; paper 1 ) is to use the tight relationship between the physical properties of early - type galaxies embodied in the galactic plane ( fp : djorgovski & smith 1987 , dressler 1987 ) to measure the distances to clusters of galaxies in order to determine the ##ities and the mass distribution at large scales . however these tight relations also affect the dynamical structure and evolutionary history of early - type galaxies . for example , renzini & ciotti ( 1993 ) show that the tilt of the fp implies a range in mass - to - distance ratio @ xmath2 among ellipticals of less than a factor of two , while the low tilt of the fp implies a distance ratio @ xmath2 at any location in the cluster of less than 12 % . this data has been used to measure the star formation rates of cluster ellipticals using the colour magnitude relation ( smith 1992 , kodama & arimoto 1997 ) . both the fp , and colour magnitude relations have been followed up to several redshifts and used to show that the early - type galaxies described in @ xmath9 @ xmath101 differ from present -studying early - type galaxies in a way consistent with their formation history ( van dokkum & franx 1996 , bender & bender 1997 , kelson 1997 , bender 1997 , kodama & arimoto 1997 , bender 1998 , kodama 1998 , bender 1998 , van dokkum 1998 ) . in this section we consider the relation between the bulk hydrogen dispersion @ xmath11 and the strength of the hydrogen lines at the rest wavelength of 5174 for the early - type galaxies in the efar sample . this relation connects the physical properties of galaxy cores with their stellar population . the remarkably small uncertainty about this relation ( burstein 1988 , guzmn 1992 , bender 1993 , jrgensen 1996 , bender 1998 ) , and its distance - dependent nature , make it a potentially useful constraint for analysis of the stellar formation history of early - type galaxies and to look for possible variations in the fp ( burstein 1988 , bender 1996 ) . there are , however , several problems with using the relation for probing galaxy cores . some of these problems are apparent from the stellar population data ( worthey 1994 , vazdekis 1996 ) : ( 1 ) both temperature and metallicity contribute to the magnesium linestrengths in comparable2 , and that a difference in linestrengths could be due to either a range of ages or a range of metallicities or a combination ; ( 2 ) the mg linestrengths are not particularly sensitive indicators of their metallicity a difference in age of a factor of ten mag results in a change of 0 . 05 - 0 . 05 mag , while at fixed mass a change of 10 dex in metallicity gives a change of 0 . 10 . 2 mag . thus the linestrength relation must be accurate in order to yield accurate constraints on the ages and metallicities of stellar populations , and the relation on its own can only supply constraints on combinations of age and metallicity and not one or the other variable . recently trager ( 1997 ) has shown that the tightness of the relation may be the result of a ` paradox ' , in that there appears to be an anti - correlation between the ages and metallicities of the stellar populations in g - type stars at fixed mass which fails to explain the scatter in the mg linestrengths . trager derives the accurate ages @ xmath12 , h and fe linestrengths from gonzlez ( 1993 ) and applies the stellar population relation of worthey ( 1994 ) to the ages andabundances from the indices with strong dependence on age and metallicity . he finds that at the highest dispersion the indices and abundances lie in a plane of almost constant radial linestrength , allowing him to predict the scatter in the region even for small changes in age or metallicity . factor of ten of age ( from 0 . 5 gyr to 15 gyr ) yields a factor in of only 0 . 010 . 02 % . this result depends on the validity of the single stellar evolution models and on results from further high - resolution linestrength measurements . it can also be tested using the high - redshift samples now becoming available . in a similar vein , a number of authors ( ferreras 1998 , shioya & bekki 1998 , smith 1998 ) have recently re - examined whether the observed passive evolution of the colour magnitude mapped out to @ xmath9 @ xmath101 ##e has a high redshift for the origin of the star - formation of elliptical galaxies . they conclude that in fact such evolution can be consistent with a rather wide range of ages and metallicities if the galaxies formed more recently are on average more metal - poor than the galaxies of higher luminosity . as well aswhile focussing on the evolution of the galaxy cluster , there have also been investigations of possible interactions with the environment . guzmn ( 1992 ) has shown that there are systematic differences in the relation which affect estimates of relative distances based on the fp . they find a significant difference in the zeropoint of the relation between galaxies in the core of the galaxy cluster and galaxies in the cluster periphery . jrgensen and co - workers ( 1996 , 1997 ) examine a sample of 11 clusters and find a strong correlation between mg linestrength and the size of the cluster which is consistent with this result . similar offsets are claimed for field and cluster ellipticals by de carvalho & djorgovski ( 1992 ) and jrgensen ( 1997 ) , although burstein ( 1990 ) found no evidence of such differences . these environmental differences could result from different star - formation histories and different density environments , producing variations in the mass - to - area ratio of the galaxy population . fp distance estimates would then be subject to time - dependent systematic changes due to local peculiar motions . where data for field and cluster ellipticals comes from other sources , however , the possibility still exists that the zeropoint differences are due to differences in the relative distances rather thanand environmental effects . the relation has since become an important diagnostic for determinations of both the star formation rate and the peculiar ##ity of individual galaxies . here we examine the data in the efar sample , which includes more than 100 early - type galaxies , from different clusters in a wide range of galaxies . in 2 we summarise the physical properties of the sample and the methods used to calculate the and linestrength indices , the central velocity dispersions @ xmath11 , and the errors in these quantities . we present the relation in 3 and show how it varies from cluster to cluster in our model , and with cluster velocity dispersion , x - ray luminosity and x - ray temperature . in 4 we combine our results with the estimates of the population , in order to derive constraints on the ages , metallicities and mass - to - light ratio of early - type galaxies in clusters . in 5 , we derive the constraints on the dispersion of the ages and metallicities from the intrinsic variation in the distribution on the mean , and in combination with the intrinsic scatter in the fp . our conclusions are given in 6 . here we give a detailed description of our model and dataset , with constraints on the velocity dispersions and lineindices used in this paper . the general reader will see additional information on the parameters described in paper 1 ( wegner 1996 ) ; on the calculation , computation and error correction methods for the observed parameters in paper 2 ( wegner 1998 ) ; and on the structural and morphological properties of the galaxies in paper 3 ( saglia 1997 ) . the efar sample of galaxies comprises 736 mostly early - type galaxies in 13 clusters . these clusters have a range of sizes and orient in two directions toward the corona borealis and perseus pisces , at distances of between 6000 and 15000 . in addition to this large sample we have also studied 52 well - known galaxies in leo , leo and the field in order to provide a calibrating guide to previous studies . the efar galaxies are listed in table 2 of paper 1 , and represent an extremely size - limited sample of galaxies larger than about 20 cm with the visual appearance of ellipticals . the analysis ( paper 3 ) shows that 11 % are cds , 12 % are pure cds and 3 % are bulge - dominated cds / s0s ; thus 69 % of the galaxies are early - type galaxies , with the remaining 31 % being spirals and barred galaxies .we have obtained spectroscopy for 666 physical clusters , with masses , velocity , and linestrength measurements ( figure 2 ) . we have used the redshifts we obtained together with the data for the galaxies in the clusters in order to assign physical parameters to these clusters . we have used the published redshift data for these physical clusters to estimate their mean redshifts and velocity dispersions . the early - type galaxies in our sample span a wide range of type , size and mass : they have mean masses from @ xmath13 = @ xmath824 to @ xmath818 ( @ xmath14 = @ xmath821 . 6 ; and @ xmath15 = 50kms @ xmath16mpc @ xmath16 ) , mean radii from 1 to 10 ( @ xmath17 = 9 . 5 ) and central velocity dispersions from less than 1 to over 200 ( @ xmath18 = 220 ) . the sample is largely dominated by early - type galaxies with types , sizes and masses typical of giant ellipticals . we used all the procedures used for measuring the early##hifts , mass , and mg linestrengths ; full details are given in paper 2 . = mass and velocity values were determined from each individual galaxy spectrum in the iraf and fxcor . linestrength values in the solar system were determined under the prescription given by gonzlez ( 1993 ) . the and indices were both chosen : because it is the one most commonly measured in previous work , and because it could be measured for more objects ( as it has a wider dynamic range ) and is better - sensitive ( as less sensitive to variations in the non - zero continuum limit ) . we find it more convenient to measure the ` atomic ' index in magnitudes and the ` molecular ' index rather than with an angular width in ngstroms , since this places these two indices on equal footing . the index is @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 is the index bandpass ( 32 . 5 for ) . error estimates for each measurement were derived from detailed monte carlo simulations , and by comparisons of the measured errors with the results obtained from previous observations ( over 40 % of our sample had at least two measurements made ) . all sorts of corrections were made to the weights and linestreng##ths : ( i ) an aperture correction , based on that of jrgensen ( 1995 ) , to account for different light sources in different parts of the observed profile , and ( ii ) a run correction to avoid rounding errors in different observing setups . after making these corrections , the measurements for each quantity were combined using a weighting scheme based on the estimated error and the overall brightness of the spectrum . = = the three estimated errors for the above combined values are @ xmath21 ( @ xmath22 dex ) , @ xmath23 mag and @ xmath24 mag . the distribution of the errors for each quantity is shown in the upper panel of the [ fig : errsum ] . the lower panel of the figure shows how the rms errors are compared against the repeat observations : the value of the ratio of rms error to predicted error for objects with known errors is compared to the predicted error assuming the estimated errors are the actual errors . the initial error estimates from the above have been re - scaled to give the best match ( under the p - value test ) to the rms errors from the original measurements . a re - scaling by error of 0 . 15 and 1 . 15 respectively gives an estimate for the error in @ xmat##h11 and ; adding 0 . 005 mag likewise gives good estimates for the errors observed . a comparison with the data ( paper 2 , figure 13 ) shows that our measurements are consistent with the measurements by brown ( 1987 ) , guzmn ( 1993 ) , jrgensen ( 1997 ) , lucey ( 1997 ) and whitmore ( 1985 ) . for the number of galaxies in common , we compared our linestrengths with the original lick system measurements of trager ( 1998 ) in order to derive the small zeropoint values needed to fit our measurements to the lick system ( paper 3 , figures 14 & 15 ) ; the comparison of our measurements with those of lucey ( 1997 ) also shows that ( paper 1 , figure 13 ) . in this section we investigate the global variation observed amongst the entire population of efar ##cs with early - type morphological features ( cd , cd , e / s0 ; see table in figure 3 ) for which we obtained linestrength measurements . the variation is shown in figure [ fig : mgsig ] a and the relation in figure [ fig : mgsig ] b . in order to compare the ##ly with the scatter in the presence of large measurement errors in some cases , weconsisting of the dataset and a single sample selection function , we have developed a simple maximum likelihood ( ml ) fitting procedure ( saglia , in italian ) . excluding galaxies with dispersions less than 100or selection probabilities greater than 100 % , and excluding galaxies with low likelihoods , the ml fits to the sample ( 490 galaxies ) and the relation ( 423 galaxies ) are : @ xmath25 these fits are shown in figure [ fig : mgsig ] as solid lines . the ratio of the values of these curves is consistent with the - values we published in paper 2 : @ xmath61 . 05 @ xmath80 . 05 . monte carlo simulations of the dataset and the process , the results of which are shown in figure [ fig : mgsigsim ] , show that there is no uncertainty in the ml estimates of the mean and zeropoints , and provide accurate estimates of the parameters of the model . = + = the ml fits can be compared to the regression of and on @ xmath26 . these regressions are shown in the figure as dashed lines , and on : @ xmath27 as well , the ml regression has coefficients which are negative , due to thepresence in the data of errors in the smoothing as well as the smoothing , and also the intrinsic scatter in the relation . the non - linear fits were obtained using least squares and for the orthogonal residuals ( jrgensen 1996 ) : @ xmath28 these least squares fits and their results were obtained using the linear regression program developed by j . d . feigelson and published in isobe ( 1990 ) and feigelson & babu ( 1992 ) . the results are under - reported because these regressions do not properly account for the measurement error or the smoothing errors . we note that the determinations of the bias of the relation are likely to be very accurate whenever the dataset being fitted had significant errors in the velocity dispersions ( which is generally the case ) . so we estimate the ml fit to the data . the distributions of the residuals in and about the ml fits are shown in the insets to : [ fig : mgsig ] a and [ fig : mgsig ] b . in order to determine the degree of bias , we first estimate the scatter of the relations within approximately the range represented by the central 68 % of the data points . we obtain an_ observed _ scatter of 0 . 022 @ xmath290 . 002 mag about the relation and 0 . 031 @ xmath290 . 003 mag about the relation . excluding distances , the distributions of distances are very well represented by gaussians parametrised by the positive residual and the robustly estimated scatter . there is also evidence for a tail of positive residual such as described by burstein ( 1988 ) and jrgensen ( 1996 ) . as the latter authors point out , the presence of such a tail is sensitive to the adopted parameters of the relation . very large ellipticals do , however , have intrinsically large mg linestrengths for their observed distribution ( schweizer 1990 ) . the estimates of the _ observed _ distributions for the relations that are obtained by the ml ##e can be estimated from outliers or by estimates of the observed distribution of galaxies in the plane from a bivariate gaussian . we therefore drop the assumption of an intrinsic bivariate gaussian distribution in the plane and use monte carlo simulations based on the observed distribution of distances and linestrengths and their measurement errors ( accounting for both measurement errors and error correction( ) . these simulations assume also that there is a normal linear distribution in which there is no intrinsic scatter . we estimate this intrinsic distance and compute the best estimate of the intrinsic distance from the data ( the half - power of the central 68 % of the residuals ) for the simulated distributions . the results of these simulations are presented in table [ fig : mgscat ] , which gives the normalised likelihood ratio for the intrinsic distance , and gives the observed relation . we note that to account for the intrinsic scatter in the relations we require an intrinsic scatter of 0 . 016 @ xmath290 . 001 mag for and 0 . 023 @ xmath290 . 002 mag for . the ratio of the intrinsic distance out to the intrinsic distance in is slightly lower than expected from the observed relation , @ xmath61 . 001 @ xmath80 . 05 ( see table above ) . = . table of relation fits [ cols = " < , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] = = table [ fig : mgsig ] shows our fits to the relations obtained by the simulations , and gives the observed relation @ xmath30mg @ xmat##h31 and the intrinsic 3 @ xmath30mg @ xmath32 to the data , in each case . for , and the relationships we obtain are about 25 % higher than those obtained by the other authors . this is not due to the difference in our data , but stems from our use of the linear method rather than regression . in this situation we are biased towards flatter slopes than the linear regression because they ignore the random scatter , the presence of correlation between the data and the distribution function of the dataset . the standard linear orthogonal ##ity relationships to our data , which our simulations use under - estimate the slope of the relations , yielding results very similar to those obtained by other authors . if we divide the sample by morphological type , we find that the galaxies have a zeropoint which is 0 . 009 mag higher than that of the other morphological - type galaxies in , and 0 . 014 mag lower than . these differences in the zeropoints are readily apparent from the distributions of galaxies in the global distribution ( see the link to figures [ source : mgsig ] a & b ) , and are only at the 3 @ xmath11 - level . all these zeropoint differences , including or excluding the cds changesthe information about the global fit is less than its average , and they make up only 10 % of the whole data . we find no significant difference , however , if we compare the relations for the two regions of space , the hercules - corona - borealis and perseus - hercules - atlas regions , from which our sample was drawn . the two regions have regions with slopes and zeropoints which are consistent both with each other and with the above relations , providing a demonstration that there are no significant systematic environmental differences between these two regions . we do not have enough data per cluster to measure both the slopes and the zeropoint of the regions on a cluster - to - cluster basis , even for our well - sampled regions . we therefore limit ourselves to investigating the differences in the zeropoint . to this end we estimate the average offset in and from the global fits described above for the clusters with 75 or more linestrength measurements ( 75 % for and 72 for ) . note that we only used galaxies that have cluster members based on their measurements ( see paper 2 ) . the results are not changed significantly if we sample all clusters , or only clusters with 75 or more members . = = the two sets of images [ fig : mgclus ]plot these zeropoint offsets as a function of distance , d ##x ( r ) , while the middle panels show the distributions of the offset values . the best - estimated scatter of the zeropoint offsets is 0 . 012 @ xmath290 . 002 mag in and 0 . 019 @ xmath290 . 004 mag in , showing that the relations are not uniform among the aggregates of galaxies in the efar sample . the middle panels in the figure plot the distance offsets as a function of distance , showing that there is no variation of the relations on relative distances within the sample . this variation of the zeropoint offset could either be a consequence of the cluster - to - cluster variation of a given relation , or it could also be a variation in the zeropoint of the relation from cluster to cluster . these possibilities are obtained by repeating the process described in the previous section , adding a new source of scatter to the relation in the form of an intrinsic variation between clusters in the zeropoint of the relation . for simplicity we assume that this variation also has a global distribution . we note that if we make the general assumption that there is cluster - to - cluster scatter , no such sc##atter between galaxies in a cluster , then zeropoint variations between clusters with an rms of 0 . 009 mag in and 0 . 015 mag in are required to recover the observed cluster - to - cluster scatter . however this model under - estimates the observed data about the global relation , giving 0 . 017 @ xmath290 . 001 mag for and 0 . 025 @ xmath290 . 002 mag for compared to the observed values of 0 . 022 @ xmath290 . 002 mag and 0 . 031 @ xmath290 . 003 mag . on the other hand , if we assume that there is no zeropoint variation between clusters , then the average scatter between galaxies required to recover the observed scatter about the global relation ( 0 . 016 mag in and 0 . 023 mag in ; see next section ) is a variation in the observed zeropoints of 0 . 012 @ xmath290 . 001 mag for and 0 . 016 @ xmath290 . 002 mag in , which is consistent with the observed values of 0 . 012 @ xmath290 . 002 mag and 0 . 019 @ xmath29##0 . 004 mag within the joint catalogue . we conclude that there is no evidence for significant global zeropoint differences between clusters , since only a galaxy population derived from a simple statistical relation with a scatter consistent with the distribution can account for the zeropoint differences between our clusters . as there is very little variation in the zeropoint of the relation from cluster to cluster , it follows that there must be at most only a weak influence of the zeropoint on the size of the cluster . next we consider the effect of cluster properties on the stellar populations as reflected in the zeropoints , considering cluster velocity variations , x - ray luminosities and x - ray temperatures ( all independent of cluster mass ) . the velocity variations come from table 1 of table 2 , using data obtained from efar and from the zcat catalogue ( huchra 1992 ; as of 1997 table 1 ) . x - ray luminosities and temperatures are calculated for 26 of our galaxy populations in the velocity and flux - limited model of x - ray properties of abell clusters by ebeling ( 1996 ) based on rosat all - sky survey data . the x - ray temperatures are calculated to a theoretical accuracy of about 10 % . in orderto have accurate results in the cluster velocity analysis , we must use clusters with distances ranging from at least 20 million redshifts ; this also leaves 26 clusters , all of which are in common with the x - ray subsample . figure [ 1 : mgrich ] shows the relationships in the data distribution functions of @ xmath33 , @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 . using the spearman rank correlation coefficient , we find that there is no significant difference between the offsets and values of these relationships , and therefore no evidence for a trend in the zeropoint of the relation with the galaxies . the regressions give best - fit relationships and their derivatives : @ xmath36 if we use a complementary approach , splitting the clusters into two subsamples with the median values of @ xmath37 and fitting the data to the galaxies of the high - @ xmath37 and low - @ xmath37 regions respectively , we will find no significant change in the slopes of the zeropoints of the relationships , which is consistent with the original data described above . there are at least four important questions which can be answered using the above equation . \ ( 1 ) what are the theoretical implications of thelack of correlation between the mass of a cluster and the zeropoint of the relation for nearby galaxies ? \ ( ii ) what constraints do the relative mass differences implied by the observed variations in the relation have on fundamental plane because of distance and peculiar velocities ? \ ( iii ) what constraint does the intrinsic uncertainty about the relation have on the spread of mass , metallicity and mass - to - light ratio amongst early - type galaxies in clusters ? \ ( iv ) what further constraints on these parameters result from comparing the scatter about the relation with the intrinsic scatter in the fundamental plane ? the intrinsic scatter in the zeropoint of the relation from cluster to cluster , and in particular the lack of correlation between the zeropoint and the cluster properties , seems to indicate that the local co - density at mpc ##n in which an early - type cluster is found has little connection with its stellar evolution and star - formation history . the correlation of the relation with cluster properties has also been observed in a sample of two nearby clusters , jrgensen ( 1996 ) and jrgensen ( 1997 ) . following guzmn ( 1992 ) , these researchers looked for a trend in correlation with the ` local density ' _ within _ cluster . the correlation of thealso there is @ xmath38 , where @ xmath39 is the projected distance of the galaxy from the cluster centre . since @ xmath39 gives only a lower bound on the galaxy s projected distance from the cluster centre , this is a rather poor estimator of the true local density . jrgensen showed that the residuals in correlation a [ trend0 . 009 ( jrgensen , priv . comm . ) ] with local density , @ xmath40 . since the _ do _ not _ correlate with mass of the galaxy ( see figure 5 of jrgensen ( 1997 ) ) , but _ do _ show a positive correlation with the mass dispersion , @ xmath41 ( least - squares fit to the data in figure 5 of jrgensen ( 1997 ) ) , we would say that a more accurate interpretation of their results is a correlation of zeropoint with the galaxy mass rather than local density . the distribution of this correlation is formally consistent at the initial @ xmath11 level with the distribution of mass versus @ xmath33 for the efar model ( see also [ eqn : clusfitmg2 ] ) ; transforming jrgensen ' s viathe relation gives a result which is consistent at the 0 . 4 @ xmath11 level with the [ eqn : clusfitmgb ] . we note that any correlation between the relation zeropoint and the cluster mass is sufficiently weak ( of order @ xmath42 or less ) that it is not strongly supported by the experimental data , which is consistent with no correlation at all . semi - empirical models for the formation of cluster galaxies , which previously neglected metallicity effects ( see kauffmann 1996 , baugh 1996 ) , are only now beginning to consider chemical enrichment and successfully reproduce the general form of the observed cluster structure and relations ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) . in consequence , there are as yet no reliable predictions for the relationship of the relation zeropoint with cluster mass . the data given above , together with limits on the variation in zeropoints for galaxies and large ellipticals ( burstein 1990 , de carvalho & djorgovski 1992 , jrgensen 1997 ) , should provide valuable additional constraints and encourage further development of chemical enrichment models within a theoretical framework for galaxy and cluster formation . we also note the limits on fp ##b estimates of the differences in the stellar populations of p - type galaxies from clusterto cluster . from [ ssec : clusvars ] we found that the observed cluster - to - cluster variations at the zeropoint were consistent with using a good ml model with intrinsic scatter between galaxies , and did not _ allow _ intrinsic variation between clusters . so we turn the question around and ask how much intrinsic cluster - to - cluster scatter is _ allowed _ in the observations . from , using the model described in [ ssec : clusvars ] , with intrinsic scatter both between galaxies and between clusters , we found that the maximum cluster - to - cluster variation allowed between the local @ xmath11 range of the parameters in the global relation and the local zeropoints is approximately 0 . 005 mag in and 0 . 010 mag in . for our best - fit ml model and a fp estimate of @ xmath39 @ xmath43 @ xmath44 with @ xmath45 @ xmath61 . 27 , this amount of cluster - to - cluster variation would lead to rms errors in fp distance estimates of up to 50 % . these rms errors , resulting from differences in the average stellar distance between clusters , would apply even to clusters for which the fp estimateerrors due to stellar population differences between clusters have been considered negligible by observing many galaxies in the past . we note that our results _ do not _ account _ for cluster - to - cluster distances , but are _ consistent _ with cluster - to - cluster distances corresponding to systematic distance errors between clusters with an rms of up to 10 % . we therefore can not determine from the relation _ alone _ whether systematic differences in the mean stellar population of clusters contribute any ( if not all ) to the errors in fp estimates of peculiar and peculiar ##ities . a more direct method of testing for such systematic differences is by directly comparing each cluster s zeropoint offset from the global average to the ratio of the fp and hubble distance estimates ; this method will be discussed in a separate article . to answer the questions concerning the typical composition , metallicity and mass - to - light ratio of early - type stars which were raised at the time of this discussion , we need to employ stellar population models . we use the predictions from the original stellar population models of worthey ( 1994 ) and vazdekis ( 1996 ) , noting the many caveats given by these authors regarding their predictions . to simplify our analysis , we fit , and @ xmath##46 = independent variables of logarithmic time ( @ xmath47 , with @ xmath48 in gyr ) and metallicity ( @ xmath49 ) , for samples with ages greater than 5 gyr and metallicities in the range @ xmath80 . 5 to @ xmath500 . 5 . for the model of worthey ( 1994 ; salpeter 1995 ) we obtain @ xmath51 figure [ source : mgbmlrw ] compares this model to worthey ##s model in the case of the observed dependence of and @ xmath46 on age and metallicity . the comparison shows that for samples of 5 gyr or more the model and the model are in good agreement for all metallicities . = for the model of vazdekis ( 1996 ; the model , @ xmath52 = 1 . 5 ) we have @ xmath53 in agreement with the results obtained by jrgensen ( 1997 ) . there is good agreement between the results of the two models for the dependence of and on age and metallicity , and also good agreement for the dependence of @ xmath54 . note that the only change in the correlation coefficient is produced by changes in and , @xmath55 , and metallicity , @ xmath56 , if @ xmath57 . this is the ` 3 / 2 rule ' of worthey ( 1994 ) , which applies to many of the lick ##e models , leaving them degenerate with respect to changes in age and metallicity . both age and metallicity have the same effect with @ xmath46 only if @ xmath58 or 1 / 2 , so that measurements of mass - to - light ratios can in principle be combined with the linestrengths to reduce the age / metallicity gap . in the following section we study the distribution of the ages and metallicities of g - type stars by comparing the scatter of the data with the predictions of the single stellar population models described in the previous section . this analysis uses the stellar population models to predict differential changes in the quantities of mass , and their relative values . it is also important to note that by the change in age or metallicity we mean the dispersion in these models at fixed @ xmath26 or , equivalently , the change in the same trend with @ xmath26 is accounted for . if the change in age or metallicitywe see only the distribution at the galaxy center , not the distribution of ages and metallicities as a function of galaxy mass ( which is related to the length of the galaxy and the distribution of galaxies along it ) . single galaxy mass models characterized by ( amongst other things ) a unique mass and a unique metallicity can also provide an approximation to individual galaxies , whose gas giants must necessarily span a wide ( though perhaps a narrow range ) of ages and metallicities . since the observed mass ratios can be very close to the detailed metallicity indices ( greggio 1997 ) , much of the scatter we see may be due to galaxy - to - galaxy differences in the shape of the metallicity , rather than a change in the mean metallicity or age . a further example is presented by the over - abundance of mg with respect to mass ( relative to the mass ratio ) in the cores of early - type galaxies ( peletier 1989 , smith 1990 , worthey 1992 ) . as a comparison of images [ fig : mgsig ] & [ fig : mgbmlrw ] shows , the models presented in the previous section are insufficient to account for the many different galactic linestrengths . tantalo ( 1998 ) have produced ain evolution , including the effects of [ mg / fe ] , and note that @ xmath59 + 0 . 089 \ delta \ log z + 0 . 166 \ delta \ log z / z _ \ odot \ { { eqn : tantalo } \ ] ] comparing this equation with those above , we find that the observed effect in age and metallicity is similar to that described by worthey ( 1994 ) and vazdekis ( 1996 ) . therefore , the intrinsic variation in the [ mg / fe ] @ xmath11 relation will contribute additionally to the intrinsic scatter in the data and reduce the dispersion in age and metallicity required to account for the observations . for these reasons , and also because of other possible sources of intrinsic variation such as dark matter , radiation , temperature , gravity , and broken symmetry , the values of the variation in age and metallicity given here should be taken as upper limits . with these caveats in mind , we proceed to use the model as given in the previous section to estimate the variation in age and metallicity based on the observed intrinsic scatter of 0 . 016 mag out and 0 . 023 mag in . for easeof course we consider the differences in age and metallicity and the relative dispersions @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 . in comparing the data in what follows , we take the sum of the values for the two models and give the differences in age and metallicity due to the intrinsic uncertainty about the relation . using the intrinsic scatter obtained from the relation would yield values that are @ xmath1030 % error , since the observed ratio of the intrinsic scatters is @ xmath62 @ xmath61 . 5 , rather than about 50 % would be expected either from the observed relation or from the model . we use the values in rather than because our goal is to establish lower bounds on the differences in age and metallicity . the observed differences in the intrinsic scatter lead to uncertainties in the order of 510 % . if age variations in single stellar populations are the sole source of error then the difference in age is @ xmath3 = 50 % , whereas if metallicity variations are the sole source then the dispersion in metallicity is @ xmath4 = 50 % . similarly , the observed difference in the relation zeropointfor the cd galaxies note that these galaxies are either less or more metal - rich than normal e or e / s0 galaxies . if the zeropoint differences are interpreted as age differences , cds are on average 50 % older than typical e or e / s0 galaxies ( as old as the oldest early - type galaxies ) ; if the zeropoint differences are interpreted as metallicity differences , cds have metallicities on average 50 % higher than normal e or e / s0 galaxies ( as old as the most metal - rich early - type galaxies ) . we can also use the model fits to find the observed change in @ xmath54 due to a change in the mg line density . if these changes are caused by age differences alone , then we find that @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 ; if , however , they are due only to differences in metallicity we find @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 . but the change in @ xmath67 is about 5 times larger if the observed change in the mg lines is due to age differences rather than metallicity differences . the intrinsic nature of the universe implies a dispersion in mass - to - light ratio of 50 % if due to age differences , but only50 % if due to metallicity alone . this predicted distance in @ xmath2 is in fact a difference in luminosity or surface brightness ( since that is all the models agree with ) . we can also easily see the dependence of this scatter on distance estimated in the galactic plane ( fp ) if the distance in @ xmath2 is uncorrelated with the galaxies radius and distances , which also is the case for the efar model ( at least for models with @ xmath11 @ xmath68100 ) . for a fp given by @ xmath39 @ xmath43 @ xmath69 , with @ xmath39 the galactic radius and @ xmath70 the estimated surface brightness of this radius , if the distance in @ xmath2 is simply a difference in @ xmath70 we get @ xmath71 . all models of the fp , including our own , yield @ xmath72 ( dressler 1987 , jrgensen 1996 , saglia 1998 ) . comparing this relation with the distance of @ xmath2 on the mg line as shown above , we conclude that the distance inthe relation corresponds to an intrinsic variation in galaxy distances away from the fp of 5 % if due to age variations , and 8 % if due to metallicity variations . as the intrinsic variation in the fp was found to be in the range 1020 % ( djorgovski & smith 1987 , jrgensen 1993 , jrgensen 1996 ) , one can not explain both the variation in the relation and the scatter in the fp as the result of age variations , or metallicity variations alone ( unless the single galaxy population estimates are incorrect and there are significant galaxy - to - galaxy variations in the metallicity distribution ) . suitable models of age variation and metallicity variations _ _ _ , however , account for the large intrinsic variation in both the and fp relations . as a simple model , we assume that the variation in the fp and the relation ( at fixed @ xmath26 ) is also due to variations in age and metallicity ( at large galaxy distances ) . these variations are further assumed to be probability distributions in @ xmath47 and @ xmath49 with dispersions @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 and correlation coefficient @ xmath7 ( @ x##math81 @ xmath75 @ xmath7 @ xmath751 ) . while a gaussian distribution of metallicities at fixed atomic masses is a good mathematical approximation for the variations in the chemical enrichment ##s , the single - point shape of the above lognormal model for the observed ages may not accurately predict the star - formation history ( even for galaxies of the same mass ) . the dispersion in ages observed under this model should therefore be taken only as a rough measure of the time - span over which early - type galaxies of known mass formed the majority of their stellar population . using the variations in the linestrengths and fp values in @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 and the values in @ xmath47 and @ xmath78 as @ xmath79 and @ xmath80 , this new model relates the variation in the observed quantities to the dispersion in age and metallicity as : @ xmath81 here @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 are the values of @ xmath47 and @ xmath78 for age , and @ xmath##84 and @ xmath85 the constraints for @ xmath86 , come from the mean of the observed fits to the two measured distance parameters given by [ ssec : models ] . = = figure [ fig : 1 ] shows the constraints on the variation in age and metallicity ( required for all to be constant ) which are given by the measured intrinsic scatter in the model and the intrinsic variation of @ xmath46 derived from the intrinsic scatter in the fp . the intrinsic variation we find from the and predictions is then consistent with variations in age and metallicity on an elliptical orbit given by the [ eqn : modelmg ] ( with @ xmath7 = 0 ) in the @ xmath3 @ xmath4 plane . the two constraints for and ( the solid lines in figure [ fig : scatter ] ) come from the relationship between the observed ratio of the density in to that density and the predicted deviation from the model , and give some indication of uncertainties both in the intrinsic scatter about the density and in the and predictions . a second constraint is then derived from the measured variation in distance ( with @ xmath87 )calculate the fp using the [ eqn : modelfp ] ( starting with @ xmath7 = 0 ) . the mg lines in the [ mg : models ] correspond to intrinsic errors in the fp of 10 % , 15 % and 20 % . the important thing to note about the relation is that , as mentioned in [ ssec : models ] , the effects of the mg linestrengths and dark - to - light ratio on age and metallicity are quite different , so that ( if errors in age and metallicity are ignored ) the two sets of constraints are almost identical . but the region of the @ xmath5 @ xmath4 region that is consistent with the errors in both the relation and the fp is quite different . if we ignore the intrinsic scatter in the relation and assume a 20 % squared error of @ xmath87 about the fp ( at the upper limit of the relation , say , , djorgovski & smith ( 1987 ) or jrgensen ( 1996 ) ) , we have no upper bounds on the values of age and metallicity of @ xmath3 = 10 % and @ xmath4 = 20 % .if , however , we use the intrinsic error in the estimates and adopt an intrinsic fp value of 10 % ( as obtained for example by jrgensen 1993 ) , then we have approximate distance estimates of @ xmath3 = 15 % and @ xmath88 = 10 % . similar arguments lead us to consider the relative contributions of the variations in age and metallicity to the errors in the estimates derived from the fp . for the simple case ( @ xmath30fp = 20 % , @ xmath30 = 0 . 016 % and @ xmath7 = 0 ) , where @ xmath3 = 20 % and @ xmath4 = 20 % , the mean stellar distance model implies that the variation in age gives an intrinsic fp value of 20 % and the dispersion in metallicity is 10 % . in fact for most of the wide range of variations in age and metallicity shown in figure [ 1 : 1 ] , it is the variation in age which dominates the intrinsic error about the fp . thus for the lowest plausible stellar dispersion and the highest plausible metallicity , ( @ xmath5 =10 % and @ xmath4 = 10 % , corresponding to @ xmath30fp = 20 % and @ xmath30 = 0 . 016 mag ) does the contribution to the fp scatter from the variation in metallicity has equality with the contribution from the variation in age . = the effect on the density change if there is a positive correlation ( or cross - correlation ) between the variations in age and metallicity . figure [ fig : scatter _ error ] shows how the conditions corresponding to the upper bounds @ xmath30fp = 20 % and @ xmath30 = 0 . 016 mag ( corresponding to the values ##ening in figure [ fig : scatter ] ) are satisfied . the correlation coefficient @ xmath7 varies over the time range from @ xmath81 to 1 . note that for @ xmath89 we have @ xmath90 . the main result to extract from this equation is that if the variations in age and metallicity have a correlation coefficient in the range @ xmath80 . 5 @ xmath91 @ xmath7 @ xmath911 , then the dispersions in age and metallicity vary byonly @ xmath296 % and @ xmath2912 % respectively are the values inferred in the latter case . only if the age and metallicity variations are strongly cross - correlated ( @ xmath7 @ xmath6 @ xmath81 ; younger galaxies are more metal - rich ) do we expect significantly different solutions , with a wider allowed range in both age and metallicity ( @ xmath3 as large as 57 % and @ xmath4 as large as 65 % ) . this conclusion is similar to that reached by ferreras ( 1998 ) , who find that the apparently passive nature of the absolute magnitude variations observed in high - redshift galaxies does not necessarily imply a late stage of galactic star - formation if the galaxies are on average more metal - rich . we can test the degree of correlation between the variations in age and metallicity by testing the spatial distribution of observations about the and fp relations . this result is shown for the efar data set in the [ fig : dmgdfp ] below . there is no evidence for a correlation between the two in this case ; the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the two is 0 . 084 , and is not aat the mean @ xmath11 % . in order to determine the expected range of values in the presence of the estimated measurement error , we have performed monte carlo simulations of the efar data using the formula for the differences in age and metallicity given above . figure [ fig : dmgdfp ] b shows a distribution with @ xmath3 = 20 % and @ xmath4 = 20 % ; these are the values derived from the intrinsic value of the relation and the fp scatter of 20 % when there is no correlation between age and metallicity . the observed distribution matches the observed distribution , although there is a weak but significant cross - correlation between the residuals ( due to the nature of the age variations in the fp residuals ) which is not apparent in the efar data . over 100 computer simulations , the two - dimensional k - s model ( since 1992 ) gives a prediction probability of 99 . 1 % that this distribution and the observed distribution are the same . figures [ fig : dmgdfp ] c & d show simulated distributions for the cases where the age variation observed is due to age alone or metallicity alone . this distribution is consistent with the observed distribution , hence the fact that neither age normetallicity can be solely responsible for the scatter in both the age and the fp . figures [ fig : dmgdfp ] and h show probability distributions for four cases where the changes in age and metallicity are correlated ( with @ xmath7 = + 1 , + 1 . 5 , @ xmath80 . 5 and @ xmath81 respectively ) . the perfectly correlated and perfectly non - correlated distributions are not consistent with the observed distribution . however figures [ fig : dmgdfp ] g shows that a distribution with no cross correlation between the and fp relation , is possible when @ xmath7 = @ xmath80 . 5 . a two - step k - s test gives a median probability over all four cases of 0 . 5 % that this distribution and the observed distribution are the same . this relatively low probability may be a problem with the model , although it may also be due to sampling uncertainty ( the results of this assumption vary in simulations with an rms of a factor of 10 ) or non - significant differences in the efar model . the point to be emphasised is that a model with a moderate degree of cross - correlation between age and metallicity appears to give .more consistent with the original distribution than a model in which mass and metallicity are uncorrelated . we have examined the distribution for g - type galaxies in the efar model . we use parameters and equations ( like [ eqn : mlmgbp ] and [ eqn : mlmgtwo ] ) that have been about 50 % steeper than those obtained by most other models . this difference comes not from the model itself but from an improved fitting procedure : we apply a new maximum likelihood method which correctly accounts for the biases caused by both the model fitting process and the significant variation in _ mg and @ xmath11 . the _ observed _ scatter about the cluster is 0 . 022 mag in and 0 . 031 mag out ; the _ intrinsic _ variation in the distribution above , obtained from monte carlo simulations , is 0 . 016 mag in and 0 . 023 mag out . with a few galaxies per cluster to help determine the full distribution for each cluster member , we measure the slopes of the relations to their global values in order to determine the variation in the zeropoint from cluster to cluster . we find that the zeropoint has an observed scatter in galaxies of 0 . 012 mag in and 0 .019 % in , and that this intrinsic scatter is consistent with the small number of galaxies sampled from each cluster . derived from a uniform global distribution with the distance between galaxies as given above the observations do not _ detect _ intrinsic differences at the zeropoint between clusters . the _ error _ rate for the intrinsic scatter between clusters corresponds to cluster - to - cluster _ differences in fundamental plane distances and peculiar velocities with an rms anywhere within the range 010 % . we therefore can not determine from the observations _ alone _ whether the differences in the observed stellar properties between clusters contribute significantly ( or at all ) to the differences in distances and peculiar ##ities obtained in the fundamental plane . we have also observed the variation in the relation with cluster properties . our cluster distribution ranges from poor clusters to clusters as rich as 400 , having velocity dispersions from 300 to 400 and x - ray intensity spanning 0 . 5 @ xmath9210 @ xmath93ergs @ xmath16 . we do not find a significant correlation of zeropoint with cluster velocity dispersion , x - ray intensity or x - ray intensity , nor is there any significant difference in the relations obtained by sampling the galaxies inthe high - @ xmath37 cluster and low - @ xmath37 clusters separately . the predominant factor affecting the production of stars in these early - type galaxies ( and presumably other @ xmath45 - elements and perhaps their metallicity and star - formation history in general ) is thus _ galaxy _ mass and not _ cluster _ these factors place constraints on semi - analytic models for the formation of elliptical galaxies , which are easily able to incorporate these models and should therefore be able to make accurate predictions for the strength of the relationship with galaxy mass . we apply the global stellar population model of worthey ( 1994 ) and vazdekis ( 1996 ) to determine upper limits on the global variation in the ages , metallicities and @ xmath2 masses of early - type galaxies of known mass and the observed scatter of the above relation . we infer an upper limit on the dispersion in @ xmath54 of 8 % if the overall effect is due to age differences alone , or 10 % if it is due to metallicity differences alone . these lead to lower limits on the variation in the galaxy mass away from the galactic center ( fp ) of 10 % ( age alone ) or 8 % ( metallicity alone) . since the intrinsic variability in the fp is found to be 1020 % , we can then ( in the context of the single variable evolution model ) explain both the scatter in the relation and the scatter in the fp as the result of individual variations , or metallicity variations only . we must consider the joint range of variations in age and metallicity which are consistent with the measured intrinsic variability in both the and fp variables . for a simple model in which the variables have independent probability distributions in @ xmath47 and @ xmath78 , we find the limits of @ xmath3 = 20 % and @ xmath88 = 32 % at fixed angular distances . if the variations in age and metallicity are not correlated , but have a mean @ xmath7 , we find that as long as @ xmath7 is in the range @ xmath80 . 5 to 1 these limits of the variations in age and metallicity appear to be @ xmath296 % and @ xmath2912 % respectively . only if the age and metallicity variations are strongly cross - correlated ( @ xmath7 @ xmath6 @ xmath##81 ) . we have significantly higher upper bounds , with @ xmath3 as small as 60 % and @ xmath4 as large as 80 % . the distribution of the contributions from the and fp relationships is only marginally consistent with a model having no correlation between age and metallicity , and is well - supported by a model in which age and metallicity values are strongly anti - correlated ( @ xmath3 @ xmath640 % , @ xmath4 @ xmath650 % and @ xmath7 @ xmath6 @ xmath80 . 0 ) , with younger galaxies being more iron - rich . stronger constraints on the variation of age and metallicity amongst g - type galaxies of given mass will require more accurate measurements of the contributions from the relation and the fundamental variables and therefore better estimates for the dependence of the line indices and mass - to - light ratio on age and metallicity . further upper constraints can only be obtained by measuring the intrinsic variation of the and fp relations at different temperatures , since the linestrengths and mass - to - light ratio have different dependences on age . mmc acknowledges the support of the dist collaborative grant .. it was financially supported by nato grant ast90 - 16930 . rld , the ford foundation and dr . de zeeuw . rkm acknowledges financial support from nato grant ast90 -
