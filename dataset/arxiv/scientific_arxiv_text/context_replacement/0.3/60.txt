in @ xcite a database containing the solution of the four nonlinear navier - stokes ( ns ) equations is presented . the equations are solved directly with a 2d pseudo - wave function in the 3d domain , on a phase space grid of @ xmath0 grid points . a large - scale body force drives the turbulent flow with a large microscale based reynolds number @ xmath1 . out of this solution , @ xmath2 equations are stored , spread out evenly over a linear system of time . details on the simulation and how accessing the data can be found at http : / / turbulence . pha . jhu . edu . in practical terms , we have easy access to the turbulent velocity field and dynamics at every point in space and time . one common way of visualising the turbulent velocity field is to use vorticity isosurfaces , for instance the figure from @ xcite . the resulting pictures are often very ` ` complex ' ' , in the sense that there are many intertwined thin vortex ##es , forming an extremely complex structure . in fact , the presentation of the entire dataset from @ xcite is very noisy and it is therefore not very clear about the turbulent dynamics . however this is, we follow a different procedure . first of all , we use the vector algorithm @ xmath3 first introduced in @ xcite . second , the algorithm being used has the advantage of displaying data points inside the different domains of 3d space . we can use this option to show the multiscale nature of the turbulent flow . because vorticity is determined by the various available scales in the image , we can visualize vorticity at scale @ xmath4 by the curl of the velocity field - filtered at scale @ xmath4 . we follow a simple procedure : * we filter the velocity field , using a box filter of size @ xmath5 , and we generate semitransparent surfaces in the domains @ xmath6 where @ xmath7 ; * we filter the velocity field , using a box filter of size @ xmath8 , and we generate surfaces in the domains @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 , but only if these domains are not in any of the domains from @ xmath6 ; and this procedure can be used iteratively with higher scales ( we need at least three scales , since the scales become too large for higher scales ) . additionally, we need first to keep track of the different values of the vorticity measured at the two points . for this purpose we employ a different color scheme for the @ xmath11 isosurfaces : for each point of the surface , we measure the cosine of the vector @ xmath12 between the @ xmath13 filtered vorticity and the @ xmath5 filtered vorticity : @ xmath14 the color is green for @ xmath15 , yellow for @ xmath16 and red for @ xmath17 , with a continuous gradient of these colors for all values . the resulting image of vortex ##es is very similar to the previous visualisation : a writhing mass of vortices . upon coarse - tuning , the structure is revealed . the large - scale vorticity , which appears as transparent particles , is then arranged in tubes . as a final step , we remove all the large - scale vorticity from the small - scale tubes . the color scheme for the small - scale vorticity is that described earlier , with green representing alignment with the large - scale vorticity and red representing non - alignment . clearly , all of the small - scale vorticity is aligned withthe vorticity of the small - scale tube that contains it . we then remove the fine - scale vorticity and look out to see that the coarse - scale vortex tubes are now becoming tangled and intertwined . introducing a much larger scale , we repeat the previous experiment . the relative orientation properties of the vorticity at these two scales is similar to that observed above . now we examine the vortex structures at all three scales simultaneously , one to the other . it is apparent that the smaller vortex tubes are transported by the larger tubes that contain them . however , this is not just a passive effect . the small - scale vortices are as well being distorted by the large - scale motions . to focus on this phenomenon closely , we must render just the two smallest scales . one can observe the small - scale vortex tubes being both stretched and distorted by the large - scale motions . the displacement of the vortex tubes by large tubes was suggested by orszag and borue @ xcite , being the basic mechanism of the nonlinear energy transfer . as the small - scale tubes are stretched out , they are ` ` spun out ' ' and gain kinetic energy . here , this phenomenon is clearly observed . the twisting of small - scale vortexby small - scale vortex motions has likewise been compared to helicity . @ xcite . the diagram thus allows us to view the turbulent cascade in detail . now we have the typical situation with three levels of vorticity simultaneously . since the ratio of scale is here 1 : 49 : 1 we are observing more than two levels of the turbulent cascade . one can understand the complexity of a very extended dynamic range with different ratios of scale . not all of the turbulent cascade is tube within tube . in our current scene we observe in the right half domain only the large - scale vortices , and in the left half only the small - scale vortices and the medium scale ones . in the right half , the observer must observe stretching of the small - scale vortex structures taking place next to the large - scale ones . the build - up of these vortices must contribute likewise to the turbulent turbulent cascade . 6ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx # 1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ` ` ` ` # ` ' ' ' ' @ noop [ 0 ] secondoftwosanitize @ ' [ 0 ] + 1$ 12 & # # 1212 _ _ % 12 @ startlink [ 1 ] @ endlink [ 2 ] @ link @ innerbibempty link : \ doibase 10 . 1080 / 14685240802376389 [ * * ( ) , 10 . 1080 / 14685240802376389 ] @ noop * * ( ) , < http : / / ieeexplore . ieee . org / xpls / c _ _ . jsp ? arnumber = 1592886 [ _ _ ] ( ) > . @ noop _ _ , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1017 / s0022112097008306 [ * * , ( ) ] http : / / www . doi . org / articles / research / cjogetfulltext ? fulltextid = action % 00523 [ * * , ( ) ]
