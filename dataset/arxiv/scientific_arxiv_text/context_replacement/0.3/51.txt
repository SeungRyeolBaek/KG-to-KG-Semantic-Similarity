the study of the phase transition of frustrated 2d systems on two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals is a central topic of modern alma ##nac physics . a lack of spin interaction can lead to problems , where the lack of magnetic states produces a crystal for which a simultaneous phase transition of the interacting states is impossible . in particular , one of the frustrated 2d systems most studied is the single spin - @ xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with competing nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) spin - states ( known as @ xmath12 ( ) @ xcite . the criticality of this @ xmath12 spin interactions on a square lattice are not yet known for @ xmath13 . there are two different long - range ordered phases at small and very large values of @ xmath6 followed by an additional quantum ordered phase without magnetic long - range interactions in the space between @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 , where the properties of these disordered phases are still under intensive debate . for @ xmath16 @ xmath17 , the system is antiferromagnetic ( af) short - term states with wave vector @ xmath18 , with the staggered value smaller than the saturated value ( quantum fluctuations ) , which disappear completely when @ xmath19 . for @ xmath20 we have two more collinear states which are the helical states with wave vectors @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 . these two collinear states are characterized by a parallel spin orientation of nearest neighbors in vertical ( or horizontal ) direction and an antiparallel spin orientation of nearest neighbors in horizontal ( or vertical ) direction , and therefore exhibit nel order within the two sublattice a and b . for @ xmath23 , the magnetization jumps from a nonzero to a saturated state . the phase transition from nel to the quantum ground state is second order , whereas the transition from the ground to the quantum excited state is first order @ xcite . et al _ . @ xcite has shown that the intermediate excited state is a ( _ singlet _ ) plaquette crystal , and the ground and first excited states are separated by a band gap . the need to study the two - dimensional @ xmath12 and antifer##romagnet has been further stimulated by their experimental realization in vanadium based compounds @ xcite , such as v @ xmath24vosio @ xmath25 , li @ xmath24vogeo @ xmath25 , and vomoo @ xmath25 , which might be predicted by this frustrated model in the case of @ xmath26 ( @ xmath27 ) . these isostructural compounds are characterized by a crystal structure of v @ xmath28 ( @ xmath29 ) layers . the properties of the @ xmath28 layer show that the superexchange is stable . in these compounds a second order phase similar to a long - lived ordered gas phase has been observed . the spin - orbit relaxation of @ xcite below @ xmath30 shows that the order is collinear . due to the two - dimensional nature of the ground - state for @ xmath31 it is not possible to predict _ a priori _ which will change the corresponding moment ##a ( i . e . , @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 ) at @ xmath30 . on the other hand , such a scenario will change bythe lattice - lattice coupling which will lift the temperature of the ground - state and will increase the energy @ xcite . therefore , any structural change should inevitably increase this competing interactions and therefore increase the frustration . in the case of this frustrated magnetic compound , the competing interactions are inequivalent and their energies and magnitudes can be tuned so that the strong field can affect the long - range ordering . thus the ground state phase diagram of these interactions , described by the @ xmath12 model , can be changed continuously from high to the low @ xmath6 , by applying high temperatures ( pressures ) , which modify the interaction energies and angles . the results from x - ray diffraction experiments @ xcite and the new @ xmath24vosio @ xmath25 model have shown that the ratio @ xmath8 decreases by about @ xmath32 when the pressure increases from @ xmath33 to @ xmath34gpa . a generalization of the @ xmath12 and ##ian model to a cubic lattice was proposed by nersesyan and tsvelik @ xcite and studied by other researchers @ xcite , the so - called @ xmath352 . for the @ xmath36 it is considered inequivalence nn bonds @ xmath1 and @ xmath37 in the two different 2d spatial dimensions with all the nnn atoms on the surface to have the same energy @ xmath3 . study of extensive electronic structure of @ xcite for the four atoms abvo ( po @ xmath38 ) @ xmath24 ( p = pb @ xmath24 , srzn , bazn , and bacd ) has the four inequivalent spin states : @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 between nn and @ xmath3 and @ xmath39 between nnn . for example , in srznvo ( po @ xmath25 ) @ xmath24 was between @ xmath40 and @ xmath41 causing a rotation of the spin axis . this spin rotation tends to narrow the spin region and push it down below a certain value of the interchain parameter @ xmath7 . on the other hand , by considering the spin axis of the @ xmath36 - - @ xmath0 - staryk##h and balents @ xcite have shown that this transition splits into two , with the presence of an intermediate , paramagnetic ( or cubic ) phase for @ xmath42 . recently , _ _ et al _ _ @ xcite , by strongly coupling cluster , obtained the interesting and novel result that there is a single interval ##t ( * qtp * ) with coordinates at ( @ xmath43 ) , in which there is a second - order phase transition between the * af * and * caf * phases . above this * qtp * , these two intermediate phases separated by the intermediate magnetically conducting phase ( vbs / rvb ) . the order transitions of both the * af * and * caf * phases occur at both below and above the * qtp * , which is typical of second - order phase transitions . there is some evidence that the transition between the * caf * and af * is of second - order . using exact diagonalization @ xcite with the intervals of @ xmath44 ( @ xmath45 ) and , the intermediate * qp * phase for an interval of @ xmath46 $ ] has been obtained for the [ - - @ xmath0 @ xmath12 @for the cubic lattice . these results are in agreement with results obtained by starykh and balentes @ xcite , that are for the * qtp * in the ground - state phase diagram recently observed by johnson , _ _ et al . _ _ @ xcite . the ground state ( gs ) properties of the two - dimensional cubic cubic antiferromagnet have been studied by several groups . the gs theory starts from singlet states on pairs of vertices , which cover the whole lattice space . however , the manifold of these states which can be constructed is nonorthogonal and overcomplete . this numerical method is limited to the clusters @ xmath47 due to storage limitations . the computation of the largest cluster @ xmath45 has been performed by johnson and de - haas @ xcite @ xmath48 years ago . in spite of the great improvements achieved during this time , it is not possible so far to perform this calculation for the next interesting cluster @ xmath49 . this is only possible with other technique , as the quantum monte carlo method . due to the advances in computer science and the increased complexity of programing , more recently @ xcite the gs of the new t - 1 / 2 @xmath12 model have been calculated using the lanczos algoritm for a square lattice with @ xmath50 sites . the theoretical basis of the frustrated quantum models is far from being complete . many of the standard many - body methods , such as quantum monte carlo methods , may fail or become computationally difficult to implement if complexity is present due to the minus - one problem . however , there is considerable interest in any method that can deal with frustrated quantum systems . this considerable temperature difference in the ground state phase diagram in the @ xmath51 plane of the quantum non - @ xmath0 @ xmath52 model further motivates attempts to solve this problem using alternative methods . using a variational approximation , in which plaquettes of two spins are connected together , oliveira @ xcite ##s calculated the ground state phase diagram of the quantum @ xmath12 model antiferromagnet on a square lattice , where the quantitative results are in good agreement with a more sophisticated approach ( exact method ) . in this work , we generalize this variational method to treat the full square lattice ( @ xmath52 model ) . the text of this paper is organized as follows :in sec . ii , the method is presented and a brief summary of results . in sec . iii , the method is applied for the case of one plaquette with two spins interacting with other plaquette type force field components . main results will be presented in sec . iv , as well as some others . finally , in sec . v we will give a brief summary . the critical state of the single spin - @ xmath0 @ xmath12 heisenberg model has been studied for many years , but very little has been done in the double spin lattice model , which is described by the hamiltonian : @ xmath53 where @ xmath54 is the spin - @ xmath0 pauli correlation coefficient , the index @ xmath55 labels the @ xmath56 ( row ) and @ xmath57 ( column ) directions of the lattice sites . the first sum runs over all nn and the second sum runs over all nnn pairs . we replace the hamiltonian ( above ) by @ xmath35 and , with strength @ xmath1 along the row direction , @ xmath37 along the column direction , @ xmath58 along the column , and we remove all the##s to be positive with @ xmath59 . the @ ( @ xmath60 ) model ( 1 ) has obtained two possible quasi - states : * af * ( * nel ) for @ xmath61 and columnar * ( * caf * ) for @ xmath62 separated by a second - order transition at @ xmath63 . quantum fluctuations play a major role in the magnetic phase diagram of the material at room temperature . we will consider the effect of these fluctuations on the properties of the nel and collinear states . in the @ xmath29 model ( quantum fluctuations ) , the line splits into two phase transitions , where the two states ( * af * and * caf * ) are separated by an additional quantum - ( * qp * ) transition , resulting in a cubic lattice . # ##ly @ xcite has obtained a straight line at @ xmath64 , for the transition between the * caf * and * qp * states , and at @ xmath65 between the * af * and * qp * states . the phase diagram of the @ xmath51 plane obtained is in accordance with starykh and balents @ xcite . however , the existenceof * qtp * ( _ quantum _ point _ ) that was found by _ , _ et al _ . @ xcite , but not present in their obtained phase diagram . moreover , they found the presence of first - order phase transitions in the phase diagram . this contradictory qualitative evidence ( whether or not of * qtp * ) is the primary motivation behind this recent work . on the other hand , a critical point ( * ce * ) is a point in the phase diagram where a critical line meets and is truncated by a first - order line . this * ce * appears in the phase diagrams of many physical systems such as certain gas mixtures , superfluids , ionic liquids , liquid crystals , certain ferromagnets , etc , and has been known for over a century @ xcite . during the * ce * long run , several singularities at the * ce * were discovered . bishop and upton @ xcite argued that a new singularity in the curvature of the first - order phase transition plane should occur at the * ce * . this argument was confirmed by bishop and barbosas @ xcite phenomenological ##ly for an exactly spherical spherical particle . the results of the study of the multicritical behavior observed at thetrial - state phase diagram in the @ xmath66 paper for the @ xmath52 model , we note the presence of a _ _ critical state _ ( * qce * ) and a * qtp * . in previous papers @ xcite ##s , the aim of this paper is to describe the * qce * using the variational method , that was used previously by oliveira @ xcite for the single quantum ( @ xmath67 ) case . we first describe the fluctuations in the quantum ground state ( * af * and * caf * respectively ) , where is the trial - state @ xmath68 for the ground state as a function of plaquette state @ xmath69 . we represent the plaquettes state @ xmath70 . , that is composed of two spins , where they do not interact ( _ _ spin _ ) with the crystal lattice as shown in figure 1 . each plaquette state is given by and @ xmath71 . [ that is defined in ref . ( 1 ) . ] @ xmath72 where \ { @ xmath73 , @ xmath74 } is the vector associated with @ xmath75 , \ { @ xmat##h76 } for real variational operators obeying the same condition @ xmath77 . with this choice of vector state , the mean value of the spin operator in each direction of the plaquette is given by @ xmath78 @ xmath79 , where the operators in the @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 directions are equal . using the same vector state as in the figure . ( 2 ) , we have the operators at each site that are given by @ xmath80 @ xmath81 @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 where we have used the same choice of operator ( _ _ _ _ ) of e . @ xcite , i . e . , @ xmath84 , and @ xmath85 , which satisfy the same condition @ xmath86 . the ground state energy per spin and energy of @ xmath1 , @ xmath87 , is given by @ xmath88 with @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 , \ tag { 0 } % \ tag { 10 } \ ] ] where @ xmath91 is the mean value of athe observable @ xmath92 energy is the general form of the @ xmath93 plaquette as shown in figure . the variational energy can be calculated using the sum of the non -

order phase transition . a further fitting of the parameter @ xmath115 in the vicinity of the second - order transition yields the same classical result for the maximum of @ xmath116 . on the other hand , for @ xmath114 and @ xmath117 the total of @ xmath118 increases monotonically with the frustration parameter @ xmath8 in the * caf * phase , with the discontinuity of @ xmath118 and @ xmath119 , which is a second - order phase transition . for@ xmath120 , the * qp * transition state between the two ordered phases ( * af * and * caf * ) occurs , and the phase transition between the two ordered * af * and * caf * occurs at the critical point @ xmath11 correspondent to the classical boundary . the transition state ( @ xmath13 ) phase transition in the @ xmath66 region is shown in fig . the black line represents the critical points and the dashed lines represent first - order frontiers . we observe three different phases , namely : * af * ( excited ) , * caf * ( * ##ized ) and * qp * ( * excited ) . the * af * and * qp * phases are separated by a first - order transition line @ xmath121 , and the * qp * and * caf * phases are separated by a first - order transition line @ xmath122 . the increase of the interchain parameter @ xmath7 has the net effect of expanding the * qp * region . the * qp * region expands gradually with the decrease of the @ xmath7 parameter , and finally disappears completely in the _ ._ _ _ _ _ * * qce * * @ xmath123 ( @ xmath124 ) where the transitions between these phases coincide . for this * qce * , i . e . , for @ xmath120 , there is a direct first - order phase transition between the * af * and * caf * phases , with a transition point @ xmath125 ( critical value ) . in order to understand the nature of the phase transition , we can consider , in the fig . 2 , the distribution of the induced phase ( order parameter ) as a function of the phase factor ( @ xmath8 ) for @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 @ xmath128 . from examples such as those shown in fig . 2 we see that for @ xmath129 there is an intermediate region between the transition point @ xmath130 at which @ xmath131 for the * af * phase , presents a second - order transition , and the point @ xmath132 at which the @ xmath133 order parameter presents a transition for the * caf * phase , characterizing a first - order transition .for @ xmath134 , the frustration parameter of the * af * phase decreases monotonically with that of the frustration parameter from @ xmath135 , for @ xmath136 , to , for @ xmath137 ( @ xmath138 ) . for the * caf * phase @ xmath133 , from @ xmath139 for @ xmath140 to @ xmath141 for @ xmath142 , characterizing a simple first - order relation between the strongly frustrated * af * and * caf * phases all at the same time . we note that the values of the order parameter @ xmath143 ( @ xmath144 ) difer of @ xmath0 ##3 when compared with methods which use other parameters ( i . e . , @ xmath145 ) . thus , in the case of the strongly frustrated ( @ xmath136 ) - wave ( @ xmath67 ) phase , solving the equation ( 1 ) and applying the scale , we get @ xmath146 which is consistent with the same result obtained by other methods such as taylor expansion , or monte carlo ., and others @ xcite , and can also be compared with the data for the k @ xmath24nif @ xmath25 , k @ xmath24mnf @ xmath25 , and k @ xmath147mnf @ xmath25 and @ xcite . ] for the quantum spin - @ xmath0 @ xmath35 model of a square lattice , where @ xmath6 and @ xmath148 . the dotted and solid lines corresponds the first - and second - order real numbers , respectively . the black line represents the quantum critical point ( * qce * ) . the notations represented by * af * , * caf * and * qp * represent the classical , collinear , and quantum spin solutions , respectively . the white line represents the spin solution @ xmath63 . ] in addition , we have studied the effects of quantum fluctuations due to spatial ( @ xmath7 ) and temporal ( @ xmath8 ) fluctuations in the quantum spin - @ xmath0 @ xmath149 ##3 model . using a variational method we found the sublat##tice exists for the * af * and * caf * phases . for calculations of @ xmath150 the frustration contributes significantly to the existence of a new transition region ( * qp * ) between the two * af * and * caf * - phases , and for @ xmath151 , we have a direct first - order transition between the * af * and * caf * phases . we have shown , by calculating the order parameters of the * af * and * caf * phases , that the phase diagrams are of second and first - order between the * af - qp * and * caf - qp * , respectively . the resulting phase diagram can be compared with previous calculations which used mean - field method @ xcite and coupled - pair method @ xcite , with the same # ##ly predicting a transition region for the order parameter ( i . e . , @ xmath152 ) , and for @ xmath120 this * qp * phase exists , assuming a direct first - order transition between the * af * and * caf * phases . on the other hand , recent calculations of high - energy ##or * @ xcite have shown that the same * qp * phase exists for= @ xmath42 in accordance with rules of exact ##ness @ xcite . we note that , using a more general method , for example , the monte carlo method @ xcite and the functional renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @ xcite , this closed form should hold for certain values of @ xmath120 . r . f . bishop , p . h . y . li , r . darradi , j . schulenburg , and j . richter , _ phys . matter _ * 78 * , 054412 ( 2008 ) ; r . f . bishop , p . h . y . li , r . darradi , j . schulenburg , j . richter , and m . j . brown , _ j . phys . : condens . matter _ * 78 * , 415213 ( 2008 ) . see also , r . darradi , j . richter , j . schulenburg , r . f . bishop , and p . h . y . li , _ j . phys . : working paper _ * 78 * , 012049 ( 2009 ) . p . carretta , m . melzi , m . papinutto , and m .smith , _ phys . * 88 * , 047601 ( 2002 ) ; m . carretta , m . papinutto , m . m . azzoni , m . m . mozzati , m . pavarini , m . gonthier , and m . smith , _ phys . * _ . * 88 * , 094420 ( 2002 ) .
