the entanglement entropy , as a tool to detect and calculate the phase transitions , has been playing an important role in the last fifteen years ( see @ xcite and references below ) . in one dimension , where most of the spin spin chains are conformal domains , the entanglement entropy is a powerful tool to detect , as well to calculate , the central charge @ xmath11 of the underlying cft . for example , for infinite systems , the steady - state entanglement entropy of a network formed by the @ xmath7 sites of an infinite system , with respect to the critical subsystem has the leading behavior @ xmath12 if the system is critical and @ xmath13 , when the system is stable with the length @ xmath14 @ xcite . although there are plenty of proposals to measure this behavior in the literature @ xcite the actual results are out of reach so far . strictly speaking the central charge of the spin chains has not been measured yet . recently other measures , that are also independent of the central charge has been proposed @ xcite . among these proposals interesting measures that , from the theoretical point of view , are also useful for measuring the phase transitions as well .the second class of critical states , is the shannon and rnyi mutual information @ xcite ( see also the related article @ xcite ) . the rnyi mutual information ( the full definition will be given in the next section ) has a parameter @ xmath5 that estimates the shannon mutual information at the point @ xmath15 . the results obtained in @ xcite indicate that the shannon and rnyi mutual informations of the initial state of the spin chains , when expressed in some central local basis , just as happens with the shannon and rnyi mutual entropy , have a strong correlation with the subsystem state , whose coefficient depends on the local basis . recently additional new results concerning the shannon and rnyi mutual information of spin chains were obtained , see @ xcite . there are also studies of the mutual information of classical two dimensional quantum systems @ xcite . it is worth noting that the shannon and rnyi mutual information studied in the above papers , as will be defined in the next section , are basis dependent quantities . it is important to distinguish them from the well known basis dependent quantity , namely , the von neumann mutual information . for further developments on the calculation of the von neumann mutual information in thermal equilibrium and non- for systems at @ xcite . most of the calculations of the shannon and the rnyi mutual information , except for the case of quantum systems , are based on statistical analysis , especially for systems with a probability density equal to one . one of the main problems for a possible analytical derivation arises from the existence of a value at @ xmath15 of the rnyi mutual information . this discontinuity prevents the use of the following trick , which is also a starting step for the analytical calculation of the shannon mutual information . in this case we will consider , for many different quantum systems , another measure of the mutual information , which is also parametrized by a parameter @ xmath5 that reduces at @ xmath15 to the shannon mutual information . the motivation for our calculation is two ##fold . firstly this quantity is more useful from the point of view of the measure of mutual information among parts of the system , since it has the same properties . this will be discussed in the appendix . secondly , this quantity does not have any value at @ xmath15 , but it can be a good starting point for the analytical calculation of the shannon mutual information with some sort of analytical continuation of the measure @ xmath5 . fromnow , we will call this new information generalized mutual information . with the above results in mind we have calculated directly ( using numerical methods ) the generalized mutual information for the critical quantum spin chains . we considered models with @ xmath1 symmetries , the @ xmath16 - spin potts modes for @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 , the z ( 4 ) ashkin - landau model and the @ xmath1 parafermionic models with @ xmath19 . we then calculated the generalized mutual information for the critical harmonic ##s ( a version of klein - gordon gauge theory ) and also for quantum spin chains with @ xmath4 symmetry in the xxz and the spin - 1 fateev - zamolodchikov quantum group . the rest of the paper is as follows : in the next section we will present the numerical results of the kerr and rnyi mutual informations as well as the mutual information . in section three we will present the numerical results of the generalized mutual information for several different critical quantum spin chains . finally in the last section we present our results . consider the quantum ground state eigenfunction of a quantum spin chain hamiltonian @ xmath20 , and in theparticular local basis @ xmath21 , where @ xmath22 are the parameters of some local basis defined on the lattice sites . the rnyi entropy is defined as @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 is the probability of finding the system in the local basis defined by @ xmath25 . the definition @ xmath26 gives us the maximum entropy @ xmath27 . since we are using a local basis it is also possible to define the state as a sum of the states inside and outside of the subregions of @ xmath28 . one can define the marginal entropy as @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 . in the first definition @ xcite we used the first definition of the rnyi mutual information : @ xmath31 from now on instead of using @ xmath32 we will use just @ xmath33 . the first definitions of the rnyi mutual information of the critical state were obtained by using the definition ( [ renyi2 ] ) . for any basis , usually the basis where part of the hamiltonian is diagonal ( see @ xcite ) , the definition ( [ renyi2 ] ) for the rnyi mutual information givesand a similar case with the subsystem of , for the values of @ xmath5 . however , as seen numerically for the quantum chains ( see @ xcite ) , it has a property for @ xmath15 , that allows the use of non - @ xmath5 methods to solve the most interesting problem where @ xmath15 , namely the the generalized mutual information . although the definition ( [ renyi2 ] ) has its usual uses it is not the one which normally has been used in information sciences . for example @ xmath34 for @ xmath35 is not necessarily a random function , a fact that we naturally expect to be true for the mutual informations . in this case we have a definition that is common in information sciences @ xcite . the generalized mutual information with the following properties , as a measure of mutual information ( see below ) , is defined for @ xcite : @ xmath36 where @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 , as above , are the states that the states are present in the configuration @ xmath39 and @ xmath40 that is the configuration @ xmath25 that occurs with the@ xmath33 . then @ xmath6 will be the size of the whole system and @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 the sizes of the states . with this new notation we can write @ xmath41 as @ xmath42 . this definition of the generalized mutual information follows from the natural extension of the shannon entropy to the rnyi case and is the entropy of the full distribution from the product of two independent variables . in the notation @ xmath43 one also has the shannon mutual information @ xmath44 , where @ xmath27 is the extended shannon entropy . one of the important properties of @ xmath0 , that is not shared with @ xmath34 , is its nondecreasing ##ness as a function of @ xmath5 ( see appendix ) . our calculations for a series of distinct quantum spin chains will be done numerically , since up to our time an exact method to calculate these spin chains was still missing . in this section we will first calculate the ground - state generalized mutual information of a series of distinct quantum spin chains with slightly different structure . in the second part we will calculate the generalized mutual information for chains with different structures suchconsider the @ xmath16 - state potts model with @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 , the ashkin - landau model and the parafermionic @ xmath1 - critical spin chain @ xcite for the case of @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 . in the second part we will calculate the generalized mutual information for models with @ xmath4 symmetry such as the klein - gordon gauge model , the xxz model and the fateev - zamolodchikov model with different values of their symmetry parameters . in this part we will calculate the generalized mutual information of the ground state of the critical spin chain with @ xmath1 - symmetry . the results we obtain are obtained by expressing the ground - state wavefunction in two specific basis where the systems have different universal symmetry . [ htb ] [ fig1 ] of the @ xmath47 - symmetry ising quantum theory , as a basis of @ xmath48 . the ground - state wavefunction is in the basis where the matrices @ xmath49 are and ( @ xmath50 basis ) . , dimension = " fig : " , scaledwidth = .. . % ] our results show that the q - state potts model and the ashkin - smith model have a common structure . for this reason we compare them here . the following @ xmath16 - dimensional potts model of the cubic lattice is given by the hamiltonian @ xcite @ xmath51 where @ xmath49 and @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 . in the following @ xmath1 model : @ xmath54 = [ r _ i , r _ j ] = [ s _ i , s _ j ] = [ $ ] for @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 . the model has its own basis given by a cft with the matrix @ xmath58 where @ xmath59 . the @ xmath60 potts model is in the periodic ising quantum chain . [ htb ] [ fig2 ] of the @ xmath47 sites periodic ising quantum chain , is a function of @ xmath48 . the q - state wavefunction is in the basis where the vectors @ xmath52 are and ( @ xmath61 matrix ) . , where = " t :" , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] the ashkin - teller model has an @ xmath62 symmetry and a hamiltonian given by : @ xmath63 where @ xmath49 and @ xmath52 are the two matrices introduced in the @ xmath64 potts model . the model is linear and conformal invariant for @ xmath65 with the central charge @ xmath66 . it is worth mentioning that at @ xmath67 we recover the @ xmath64 potts model and at @ xmath68 the result is identical to the different ising models . in the case @ xcite we also showed that the linear and rnyi - matrices , as defined in ( [ renyi2 ] ) , are not independent . in other cases we can get two distinct different two - dimensional scaling ##s by considering different matrices . but in some special case , that we have conformal basis , the results have a universality . for example , the results for the @ xmath16 - based potts model and for the ashkin - teller model in the case where the matrix @ xmath52 and the matrices @ xmath49 are independent .the following , and comparing the asymptotic behavior @ xmath69 with @ xmath70 we should mention that in @ xcite , based on these results , it was shown that for @ xmath15 the parameter @ xmath71 might not be exactly equal to the sachs coefficient . as it was stated in @ xcite it is quite obvious that @ xmath34 is not a constant function of @ xmath15 and so any attempt to solve the replica trick with this measure of rnyi shared information would be useless . this makes the exact solution a problem . this is an important reason to study the behavior of @ xmath0 , and finding the functional extension , from the point of view of the measure of shared information . having this in mind we calculated the @ xmath0 for @ xmath17 and @ xmath64 potts , and for the ashkin - sachs coefficients in the @ xmath61 and the @ xmath50 chains . we found that in some choice of choice of the parameter @ xmath5 we can fit the data nicely to @ xmath72 and @ xmath10 a monotonically nondecreasing function of @xmath5 , corresponds with what we expect for the shared information , since it is a quantitative measure of the information ( see the appendix ) .

state potts chain ( @ xmath2 ) and the parafermionic @ xmath1 - symmetric ( @ xmath3 ) . in the case of the ashkin - sachs model our results indicate that @ xmath80 , for @ xmat##h158 , which depends on the parameter @ xmath73 of the model . on the other hand the model with higher order showed a similar behavior as for @ xmath157 . for @ xmath158 we have strong evidence that most probably the shannon mutual information is not defined . it is also interesting that in these cases one can understand most of the problem by just studying simple long - range coupled harmonic ##s . in order to conclude we should assume that the analytical solution for the shannon entropy of the shannon mutual information ( @ xmath181 or @ xmath182 , ( [ renyi2 ] ) and ( [ renyi ##3 ] ) ) is a real one . the usual way to solve this kind of problem would be some kind of analytic continuation , in the parameter @ xmath5 , like the exact replica trick . the results we present for the behavior of @ xmath0 around @ xmath15 , differently from what happens with @ xmath34 , suggest that @ xmath0 is probably more appropriate for the analytical solution . _ _ _ this project was funded in part by fapesp and cnpq ( brazilian agencies) . we consult j . a . hoyos , r . pereira and m . pasquier for this information . in this appendix we give the definitions of the relative entropy and its inverse : the rnyi divergence . the relative entropy is defined as the measure of the difference between the values of the two distribution of , @ xmath183 and @ xmath184 , from the point of view of the distribution @ xmath183 , i . e . , @ xmath185 it can be defined as a measure of the difference between the two distributions @ xmath183 and @ xmath184 . although it is not a symmetric distribution it allows us to define the mutual information of the distribution @ xmath186 and @ xmath187 of the system as follows @ xmath188 in words , the mutual information of two parts of a system is called the relative entropy of the distribution of for the whole system and the entropy of the probability distributions of the two parts . it tells how closely the two parts are related . the weighted inverse of the relative entropy is the rnyi divergence and can be defined ( as @ xcite for example) , for @ xmath189 it has the following properties : for @ xmath190 we have @ xmath191 and if @ xmath192 holds we have @ xmath193 . the second definition @ xmath26 has the same relative entropy . we can define the @ xmath85 definition by : @ xmath194 it is worth noting that using the above definition @ xmath195 is always zero except when for which @ xmath196 and for which @ xmath197 also @ xmath198 holds . replacing ( [ renyi ##2 ] ) with ( [ mutual information from relative entropy ] ) and ( [ relative entropy ] ) the above definition of the corresponding mutual information is @ xmath199 the above definition is different from @ xmath200 , as defined by ( [ renyi2 ] ) , and has been widely used in many areas of information theory . -
