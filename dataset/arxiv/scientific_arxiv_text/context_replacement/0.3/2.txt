the leptonic decay of the charged pseudoscalar meson @ xmath7 involves processes of the form @ xmath8 , where @ xmath9 , @ xmath10 , or @ xmath11 . because no strong interactions are observed in the leptonic final state @ xmath12 , these processes are a simple way to describe the weak , weak interactions that bind the quark and antiquark of the final - state meson . using these processes , the decay energy can be parametrized into a new quantity , @ xmath13 , the pseudoscalar proton decay rate . the leptonic decay rate can be determined by experiment , and the decay rate can be determined by the equation ( with radiative corrections ) @ xmath14 where @ xmath15 is the fermi coupling matrix , @ xmath16 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @ xcite ##s , @ xmath17 is the charge of the meson , and @ xmath18 is the mass of the charged particle . the quantity @ xmath13 describes the interactions for the @ xmath19 and @ xmath20- quarks in the @ xmath21 to have zero separation , a condition necessary for them to decay into the new @ xmath22 nucleus that forms the @ xmath12 nucleus . the experimental determination of decay constants is one of the most important areas of physics involvithe latter is now generally considered to be the most accurate way tong nonperturbative calculations . these calculations have been performed using various models @ xcite and local lattice theory ( lqcd ) .  determine the constant . determination of decay constants is important for describing several key processes , such as @ xmath23 decay , which occurs on @ xmath24 , a process that is not predicted by lqcd calculations . the comparison @ xcite of @ xmath24 with the leptonic decay of a @ xmath25 nucleus is , however , very limited as the rate is highly suppressed due to the reduction of the size of the relevant ckm decay element @ xmath26 . the charm mesons , @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 , are useful instruments to study the leptonic decays of charm mesons since these particles are either highly ckm suppressed or favored, _ i . e . _ , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 are much heavier than @ xmath31 . thus , the # ##s @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 obtained from the meson decays can be used to perform and validate the same lqcd calculations applied to the @ xmath34 - 1 sector . among the leptonic decay in the anti - charm sector , @ xmath35 ##s are more favored since they are ckm particles . also , the higher mass of the @ xmath11 lepton reduces the helicity effect that is present in the decay to lighter states . the presence of multiple particles in the same state , however , makes measurement of this effect challenging . features of the standard model ( sm ) may also affect leptonic decays of charm particles . depending on the non - sm model , the ratio of @ xmath36 could be increased @ xcite , as could the ratio @ xcite @ xmath37 . any of the two ratios could be increased or decreased . there is no evidence of a discrepancy between the two ratios @ xcite of@ xmath33 and the most recently published lqcd calculation @ xcite . this disagreement is somewhat significant since the cleo - c calculation @ xcite of @ xmath32 agrees well with the lqcd calculation @ xcite of that particle . some @ xcite conjecture that this decay may be caused by a weak higgs , or a leptoquark . in this article , we report an experimental measurement of the absolute branching number of the leptonic decay @ xmath0 ( spin - exchange effects are excluded ) , with @ xmath1 , from which we derive the decay of @ xmath33 . we report a data sample of @ xmath38 , provided by the cornell electron storage facility ( cesr ) and measured by the cleo - c detector at the unit - of - measurement ( cm ) of @ xmath39 mev , near @ xmath3 and production @ xcite . the data sample consists of the absolute luminosity of @ xmath40 @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 @ xmath3 respectively . we have also reported @ xcite measurements of @ xmath43 and @ xmath##0 with a subsample of these detectors . a second detector @ xcite reports measurements of @ xmath33 from @ xmath43 and @ xmath0 , with @ xmath44 , using essentially the same sample sample as the one used for this article . the cleo - x detector @ xcite is a general - purpose solenoidal detector with four concentric chambers utilized for this measurement : a large - radius 48 - layer stereo ##scopic drift chamber , a 47 - layer main drift chamber , a ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector , and an electromagnetic detector consisting of 7800 csi ( rich ) detectors . the two drift chambers operate in the @ xmath45 t - field and provide charged particle tracking in a steady state of @ xmath46 % of @ xmath47 . the detectors achieve a spatial resolution of @ xmath48 % at @ xmath49 gev / @ xmath50 . the main drift chamber also provides specific - ionization ( @ xmath51 ) measurements that distinguish between charged particles and kaons . the rich detector covers the @ xmath52 % of @ xmath47 and provides the detection of electrons andand at track momentum . the total energy distribution of the event is @ xmath53 % at @ xmath54 gev and @ xmath55 % at @ xmath56 mev . the identification is based on a spectral ratio that includes the signal from the rich event , @ xmath51 , and the ratio of electromagnetic shower energy to track momentum ( @ xmath57 ) . we developed a geant - based @ xcite monte carlo ( st ) modeling program to improve efficiency of signal - event modeling and detection processes . signal events are generated by evtgen @ xcite , equipped with an extensive knowledge of the mit @ xcite , and initial - state radiation ( fsr ) is modeled by the mit @ xcite program . the modeling of initial - state radiation ( isr ) is based on cross sections for @ xmath3 events at lower energies obtained from the cleo - x - scan @ xcite at the cm energy where we collect the data . the presence of two @ xmath58 mesons in an @ xmath3 event allows us to construct a single - particle ( st ) model in which an @ xmath58 is present in a hadronic decay modeand a second double - tag ( dt ) subsample in which an additional @ xmath59 is required for the generation of @ xmath60 ##s , the @ xmath59 being the source of the @ xmath60 . the @ xmath61 tag in the st sample can be either primary or secondary from @ xmath62 ( or @ xmath63 ) . the st yield can be expressed as @ xmath64 where @ xmath65 is the produced number of @ xmath3 values , @ xmath66 is the branching fraction of hadronic modes reconstructed in the st sample , and @ xmath67 is the st yield . the @ xmath68 counts the candidates , or events , and the yield of 3 is from the product of @ xmath28 and @ xmath61 values . our double - tag ( dt ) sample is formed from samples with only a single charged particle , such as the @ xmath69 , in addition to a st . the yield can be expressed as @ xmath70 where @ xmath71 is the leptonic decay branching fraction , is the subbranching fraction of@ xmath1 decay , @ xmath72 is the efficiency of finding the st and the leptonic decay in the same time . from the st and dt , we can obtain the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay @ xmath71 , without having to analyze the integrated signal or the atomic number of @ xmath3 decay , @ xmath73 where @ xmath74 ( @ xmath75 ) is the effective decay efficiency . because of the large beam angle associated with high segmentation of the cleo - 1 beam and the high efficiency of the events with which we are dealing , @ xmath76 , where @ xmath77 is the leptonic decay efficiency . however , the decay @ xmath78 is insensitive to all the events associated with the st , and the absolute branching fraction @ xmath71 resulting from this ratio is nearly independent of the efficiency of the decay mode . to avoid these uncertainties , we tag using the two - particle hadronic decay modes with only two particles in the ground state . the three st ##s and @ xmath79 are shorthand labels for @ xmath80and within the range ( described below ) of the @ xmath81 peak in @ xmath82 and the @ xmath83 peak in @ xmath84 , respectively . no attempt was made to separate these two components in the @ xmath85 dalitz vs . ] ] @ xmath86 , @ xmath79 , and @ xmath87 . using these tag modes also helps to reduce the tag bias which would be caused by the correlation between the receiver side and the signal during reconstruction if tag modes with high amplitude and large amplitude were used . the effect of the tag bias @ xmath88 can be expressed in terms of the st efficiency @ xmath74 given by @ xmath89 where @ xmath90 is the st efficiency when the recoil system is the single leptonic decay with single @ xmath59 in the other half of the tag . since the corresponding st efficiency @ xmath67 , when the recoil system is any single @ xmath91 system , would be lower than the @ xmath90 , a tag bias could be applied if the amplitude of the tag mode is high , orthe tag modes were to include neutral particles in the ground state . as stated in sec . [ 1 : 1 ] , this effect is negligible in our first two tag modes . the @ xmath92 beam is created by combining oppositely directed tracks that originate from a single vertex and that have an invariant mass of @ xmath93 mev of the nominal mass @ xcite . we require the resonance energy to create the two tag modes for the nominal masses @ xcite : @ xmath94 ( @ xmath95 mev ) and @ xmath96 ( @ xmath97 mev ) . we require the number of neutral particles to be @ xmath56 mev or more to ensure the total energy released from @ xmath98 decays ( to @ xmath99 ) . we create a st ##r using the invariant mass of the tag @ xmath100 and recoil energy against the tag @ xmath101 . the recoil mass is calculated as @ xmath102 where @ xmath103 is the net angular - momentum of the @ xmath4 beam , taking the effective beam exit angle into account ; @ xmat##h104 is the four - momentum of the proton , with @ xmath105 mass from @ xmath106 and the recoil mass @ xcite of the @ xmath91 mass . we define the total mass to be the @ xmath107 mev of the @ xmath108 mass @ xcite . this latter definition allows the primary and secondary @ xmath91 tags to be used . to calculate the backgrounds of our st and dt yields from the wrong tag regions ( or combinations that , by definition , fall outside the @ xmath109 tag region ) , we use the frame parameter for sidebands . we define the signal region as @ xmath110 mev @ xmath111 mev , and the sideband ##s as @ xmath112 mev @ xmath113 mev or @ xmath114 mev @ xmath115 mev , where @ xmath116 is the distance between the signal region and the recoil region . we fit the st @ xmath109 signal to the sum of non - gaussian correlation coefficient and first - order chebyshev polynomial background contribution to thethe yield and sideband scaling factor . the invariant mass yields of the candidates for each tag mode are summarized in table . [ table : dm ] and the st yield and @ xmath109 sideband scaling factor are summarized in table [ table : data - single ] . we find @ xmath117 yield over the four tag modes . . [ table : data - single ] summary of mass - tag ( st ) yields , where @ xmath118 is the yield in the st - signal region , @ xmath119 is the yield in the sideband region , @ xmath120 is the sideband scaling factor , and @ xmath68 is the total sideband - st yield . [ tag = " < , > , > , > , > " , header = " header " , ] we find four semileptonic targets , @ xmath121 @ xmath122 , @ xmath123 , @ xmath124 , @ xmath125 , @ xmath126 , and @ xmath127 , as the main sources of yield in the @ xmath128 yield region . the second is thenonpeaking background , and the latter ( with @ xmath129 ) dominates the peaking background . variation in the signal yield due to nonpeaking background ( @ xmath130 ) is assessed by measuring the semileptonic decay branching fractions and the precision with which they are known @ xcite . imperfect knowledge of @ xmath131 gives rise to a systematic uncertainty in our measurement of the degree of peaking background in the signal yield , which has no effect on our branching fraction measurement of @ xmath132 . we measure differences in efficiency , data vs mc events , due to the extra energy requirement , extra track veto , and @ xmath133 requirement , by taking samples from data and mc events , for which _ both _ the @ xmath134 and @ xmath2 satisfy our two requirements , i . e . , ` ` double - tag ' ' events . we then measure each of the above - mentioned requirements and the # ##y requirement of data vs mc events . in this case we get a correction of @ xmath135 for the extra energy requirement and the correction of each of the two requirements of @ xmath136 ( not equal , by chance ) . the non- @ xmath69 uncertainty in the signal @ xmath69 / sample is low ( @ xmath137 ) due to the low probability ( @ xmath138 per sample ) that events ( @ xmath139 or @ xmath140 ) are misidentified as @ xmath69 @ xcite . uncertainty in these events causes a @ xmath141 error in the measurement of @ xmath142 . the signal @ xmath69 measurements from other carrier sources , such as @ xmath143 dalitz decay ( @ xmath144 ) and @ xmath145 decay ( @ xmath146 ) , are measured by measuring the plus - sign signal when in contact with @ xmath147 . the uncertainty in the signal from this source is assumed to be @ xmath148 . other possible sources of the uncertainty are @ xmath68 ( @ xmath137 ) , detection efficiency ( @ xmath149 ) , detection efficiency ( @ xmath148 ) , @ xmath59 identification efficiency ( @ xmath150 ) , and fsr( @ xmath150 ) . combining the contributions from these , the total statistical uncertainty of the branching fraction measurement is estimated to be @ xmath151 . in particular , when the sample of @ xmath152 through @ xmath28 reacts with the cleo - decay , we obtain the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic particle @ xmath153 through @ xmath154 @ xmath155 where the first measurement is statistical and the second is experimental . this determination follows our previous determination @ xcite of the absolute branching fraction , which is a subsample of data given in this article . the decay rate @ xmath33 can be calculated using ref . ( [ 1 : 2 ] ) with the determination @ xcite @ xmath156 gev @ xmath157 , @ xmath158 mev , @ xmath159 mev , and @ xmath160 respectively . we assume @ xmath161 and use the determination @ xmath162 given in ref . we obtain @ xmath163 along with our previous determination @ xcite of @ xmath164 mevwith @ xmath43 and @ xmath0 ( @ xmath165 ) decays , we obtain @ xmath166 this value is derived from the branching fraction , and is the most precise determination of the @ xmath91 leptonic mass number to date . our new value is better than the previous lqcd calculation @ xmath167 mev @ xcite and @ xmath168 standard deviations . the difference between sm and lqcd for @ xmath33 could be due to errors of the measurement @ xcite , or systematic errors in the experimental measurements and the lqcd calculation , or systematic errors that are not present in the lqcd calculation and the experimental measurements . together with our previous determination @ xcite of @ xmath169 , via @ xmath44 , we obtain @ xmath170 using this with our determination @ xcite of @ xmath171 , we obtain the branching fraction ratio @ xmath172 this is combined with @ xmath173 , the value given by the sm with known universality , as stated in eq . ( [ eq : f ] ) with known uncertainty @xcite . we also appreciate the familiarity of the cesr ##s in the field with the astronomical and radiation conditions . m . cronin - hennessy and m . ryd thank the h . j . sloan foundation . this project is supported by the national science foundation , the u . s . department of energy , the physical science and engineering research council of japan , and the u . s . science and technology policy board . c . amsler _ et al . _ ( astronomical data center ) , phys . d * 667 * , 295 ( 2008 ) . a . ikado _ et al . _ ( japanese collaboration ) , phys . lett . * 111 * , 251802 ( 2006 ) . a . aubert _ et al . _ ( japanese collaboration ) , phys . rev . d * 75 * , 011107 ( 2008 ) . a . g . akeroyd and c . t . lee , phys . d * 111 * , 075004 ( 2007 ) ; a . g . akeroyd , prog . phys . * 111 * , 295 ( 2004 ) . j . r . hewett , arxiv : astro - ph / 9505246 . j. c . hou , phys . d * 100 * , 2342 ( 1993 ) . m . follana , a . j . a . smith , j . m . lepage , and t . shigemitsu ( hpqcd collaboration ) , phys . lett . * 100 * , 062002 ( 2008 ) . a . a . smith _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . rev . d * 100 * , 052003 ( 2008 ) . a . a . dobrescu and j . a . kronfeld , phys . * 100 * , 241802 ( 2008 ) . m . cronin - hennessy _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , arxiv : 0801 . 3418 . m . artuso _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . lett . * 99 * , 071802 ( 2007 ) . m . a . ecklund _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . rev . lett . * 99 * , 161801 ( 2008 ) . a . a . smith _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . rev .d * 79 * , 052001 ( 2009 ) . t . kubota _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , nucl . instrum . d * 320 * , 34 ( 1992 ) . p . peterson _ et al . _ , instrum . methods phys . , rev . d * 478 * , 142 ( 2002 ) . m . artuso _ et al . _ , nucl . instrum . methods phys . d * 502 * , 51 ( 2003 ) . j . dobbs _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . rev . d * 79 * , 112001 ( 2007 ) . p . p . peterson _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . rev . lett . * 79 * , 161804 ( 2008 ) . m . barberio and y . wang , comput . . commun . * 79 * , 291 ( 1994 ) .
