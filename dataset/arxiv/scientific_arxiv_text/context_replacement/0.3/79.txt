the presence of a thin film at a fluid - liquid interface alters the dynamics of the interface . this is reflected in some of the surface waves , induced either externally or by thermal energy @ xcite . the interfacial dynamics can be studied by measuring the light reflected by such surface waves ( see the review by earnshaw @ xcite ) . the reflection of light on surface waves is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of surfactant films at fluid interfaces @ xcite , and a number of systems have been successfully constructed using this method ( e . g . diamond @ xcite , see also the review by smith and hopkinson @ xcite ) . recently , the use of thin films to modify the interface properties has been extended to the systems in which one of the fluids is a liquid - crystalline phase ( e . g . liquid crystal systems @ xcite ) . the presence of a liquid crystal in one of the fluids complicates the problem of probing the interface dynamics by altering the dynamics of the surface waves for the following reasons . firstly , there are additional degrees of freedom in the structure of the liquid crystal , due to its anisotropy . secondly , the interface withthe thin film is more complicated due to anisotropic properties . however , the thin film in the anisotropic environment created by the neighboring liquid crystal phase itself show anisotropic properties , even if it behaves as a one - dimensional free fluid at the boundary between two phases . a promising new technology for chemical and biological sensing devices has recently emerged which exploits the properties of thin films self - organizing at the interface between water and a nematic liquid crystal . the surfactant film induces the orientation of the nematic director @ xcite . the presence of chemical or biological molecules at the interface can then lead to orientation of the nematic director , enabling detection by an optical system @ xcite . in these systems , easy detection is limited to the degree in which adsorption changes anchoring properties of the interface with respect to the adjacent liquid crystal phase quite considerably . therefore , the equilibrium anchoring properties should change in time . the scope of application of these systems could be made much wider , however , if a system was used that was sensitive to changes in the anchoring properties of the interface that did not necessarily result in nematic director reorientation . for example , the first##ing orientation ##s remain unchanged @ xcite , the effect is increasing the strength of the anchoring . if a small amount of an analyte is dissolved in the water it can be adsorbed at the surfactant interface , provided the individual molecules have similar electronic properties . however , these interactions will result in a change in the elastic and viscous properties of the water . hence the experiments which are necessary to determine the interfacial interface will allow much more detailed experimental insight into the nature of the interaction between the water and the analyte than has hitherto been possible , and experimental study of surface waves is a valuable tool for this purpose . the theoretical study of surface waves at interfaces between nematic and isotropic liquids was made back in 1970s @ xcite . the results demonstrated that the spectrum of surface waves has a more complex structure than in the isotropic liquids , and enabled the first surface wave experiments to determine properties of nematic interfaces @ xcite . since then , several theoretical and experimental advances have been made , and presently these advances remain a subject of investigation @ xcite . the first paper is a theoretical study of the dispersion of the surface waves at a monomolecular surfactant film between ana liquid ( e . g . water ) and a nematic liquid crystal . the four distinguishing features of curved interfaces , are ( i ) the orientation induced by the surfactant layer , ( ii ) the surface energy of the interface , ( iii ) amount of surface bending due to surfactant , and ( iv ) the values of the surface viscoelastic coefficients . we base our analysis on the continuum model for anisotropic curved interfaces , rey @ xcite , which takes into account anchoring and binding properties of the surfactant . we consider the case of the insoluble surfactant layer that is in a polar symmetric space ( isotropic three - dimensional space ) , and induces homeotropic ( normal to the surface ) motion of the director . the model is structured as follows . the continuum model used in the rest of the paper is drawn up in section [ sec : phase ] . in section [ sec : phase ] the dispersion relation for surface modes is derived . in section [ sec : phase ] the numerical solution of the dispersion relation is solved with different values of material parameters , and dispersion relations for different surface modes are derived in terms of the external interferencefield , and the influence of the magnetic field is described in appendix [ sec : field ] . the general form of the dispersion relation is written in appendix [ app : field ] . in this section we use the model of the electron - laden interface between an ideal liquid and a nematic liquid crystal , described in the previous section , and write down the governing equations . we base our treatment upon the description of the nematic - isotropic liquid @ rey @ xcite , and upon the previous description of the liquid @ xcite and nematic liquid crystals @ xcite . we consider the case when the surfactant film has homeotropic ( normal to the surface ) orientation of the nematic director , which is usually observed in the system of the surfactant concentrations @ xcite . this case is the easiest to analyze , and , at the same time , the most suitable for biosensing , where the small change in contact angle can not be always observed . we include the external magnetic field in our study and limit our analysis by considering the part of the magnetic field that does not affect the orientation of the nematic director . we assume that the system is far enough from equilibrium phasetransitions occur in the dynamic film @ xcite and in the nematic film @ xcite . here we avoid complications due to the difference of the nematic and surfactant order parameters and the divergence of viscoelastic forces during these transitions . the surfactant films can exhibit rich phase behavior @ xcite , and the form of the surface stress tensor depends upon the symmetry of the interface . however , this does not have bearing on the physical properties of the interface as compared to the bulk behavior @ xcite . in the present paper we assume that the surfactant film is of the same symmetric phase ( a two - phase fluid ) . although the symmetry of the interface should break in presence of the adjacent two - phase bulk fluid , the film is only in equilibrium if the anchoring of the nematic is homeotropic , and symmetry breaking can occur only due to fluctuations of the director field . if we introduce the order parameter for the interface , the corresponding linear contributions to the interfacial stress tensor would be of higher order in the case of the dynamic interface than is assumed in our original treatment , and these contributions can be omitted . we consider a surfactant layer as an interface .nematic and bulk liquids to be nearly infinitely thin . we assume that the surfactant interface is homogeneous and newtonian . this means that the model is applicable to systems in which the interchange of surfactant molecules between the interface and the bulk fluids is slow , and the relaxation of the molecules of surfactant molecules is slow compared to relaxation of sound waves . we also assume heat transfer to be very fast and that the interface is in thermal equilibrium . we do not consider systems where other properties , such as polarity , are important . we shall choose coordinate coordinates in such a way that the solid surface lies at the point @ xmath0 , the half - space @ xmath1 is occupied by the uniaxial nematic liquid phase , and the half - space @ xmath2 is filled by the isotropic liquid . other details of the geometry described in the present paper are given in appendix [ app : 1 ] . the following equations in the previous section describe the conditions for the balance of forces ( eq . ( [ app : forcebalance ] ) and torques ( eq . ( [ app : torquebalance ] ) at the interface . the explicit form of these equationsbased upon the chosen macroscopic model , and the remainder of this article is devoted to details of the model presented in the original paper . the interfacial torque balance equation is the balance between the surface stress and the bulk stress fields : @ xmath3 , @ xmath4 is the force per unit area exerted by the interfacial stress @ xmath5 , @ xmath6 is the force per unit area generated by the surrounding liquid , @ xmath7 is the force per unit area exerted by the nematic liquid crystal , the expression @ xmath8 indicates that the bulk stress fields in the isotropic fluid , @ xmath9 , and in the nematic , @ xmath10 , are evaluated at the interface , @ xmath11 is the unit area perpendicular to the interface and projected into the surrounding liquid . the bulk torque balance equation can be written as @ xmath12 where @ xmath13 is the bulk stress arising due to surface interactions , @ xmath14 is the torque generated upon the interface with the surrounding nematic liquid crystal . the mathematical model for surface and bulk stresses and torques that are e##qs ( [ app : forcebalance ] ) and ( ) . ( [ app : torquebalance ] ) are expanded in the remainder of this equation . from this and the following equations we have the equations for the surface stress tensor @ xmath5 and surface torque vector @ xmath13 . we write these quantities as a sum of the non - dissipative ( elastic ) and dissipative ( elastic ) quantities : @ xmath15 @ xmath16 to obtain the non - dissipative solutions to the surface stress tensor , @ xmath17 , and surface torque vector , @ xmath18 , we use the equilibrium equation developed by rey @ xcite , which is summarized below . rey describes the interface with the helmholtz potential energy per unit volume @ xmath19 of the form @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 is the potential energy density , @ xmath22 is the most important component of the interface ( see appendix [ app : energy ] ) . the total energy is expressed as @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 _ { \ mathbf [ , \ mathbf k } \ ] ] is the totaltension , @ xmath25 is the elastic part of the displacement vector ( @ xmath26 is the elastic part ) , and @ xmath27 is the elastic moment vector . the polar surface stress tensor was written to as @ xmath28 where the surface or molecular component is given by @ xmath29 @ xmath30 is surface gradient tensor , @ xmath31 is variational derivative with respect to @ xmath11 . the elastic response to applied stress was written as @ xmath32 where @ xmath33 is the polar surface stress , @ xmath34 is the levi - civita tensor , and @ xmath35 is the surface tension tensor . the elastic properties of interfaces between an isotropic solid and a nematic liquid phase were considered in 2007 by rey @ xcite , and the results are summarized below . the forces and strains that contribute to the behavior of @ xmath36 were described as follows : @ xmath37 where @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 are , respectively , symmetric and antisymmetric components of the surface tension stress tensor @ xmath40 , @ xmat##h41 and @ xmath42 are the components of the surface viscous director field tangent and normal to the surface , @ xmath43 \ ] ] is the surface rate - of - diffusion tensor ( @ xmath44 denotes the diffusion coefficient ) , @ xmath45 \ ] ] is the surface vorticity tensor , @ xmath46 is the velocity , @ xmath47 and @ xmath48 are the partial time derivatives of the components @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 of the nematic director field @ xmath51 , tangent and normal to the surface , respectively . however , presence of the surfactant film at the interface changes the form of the entropy production due to additional internal degrees of freedom of the interface , and to the anisotropy of the adjacent nematic liquid . however , if the surfactant film that is in an isotropic stationary phase and has homeotropic anchoring of the nematic , the remaining anisitropic terms of the entropy production are solutions to the boundary conditions of higher order than above , and therefore can be expressed in the above form . since this is the form weafter this , we shall take the form of the entropy contribution ( [ q : entropyproduction ] ) of our model and take the form of the entropy contribution to the surface stress tensor given by rey @ xcite , which is given by @ xmath52 , \ end { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath53 is the surface jaumann ( corrotational ) derivative @ xcite of the pressure gradient of the director @ xmath54 , and @ xmath55 , @ xmath56 are nine different surface tension components . in the first case @ xmath57 , the expression for the surface tension stress tensor reduces to the surface stress tensor of boussinesq - schriven surface tension @ xcite with the interfacial surface tension @ xmath58 given by @ xmath59 and dilatational tension @ xmath60 given by @ xmath61 the surface tension torque , according to fig . ( [ q : entropyproduction ] ) , is given by @ xcite @ xmath62 where the surface viscous force is @ xmath63 , @ xmat##h64 the strain coefficients @ xmath65 can be expressed in terms of quantities @ xmath66 . we shall need only the expression for the total elastic moment : @ xmath67 to express explicitly the surface tension @ xmath68 ( cf . ( [ e : def - tau ] ) ) , the linear component of the fundamental vector @ xmath69 ( cf . ( [ e : def - xi ] ) ) , and the rotational moment : @ xmath70 ( eq . ( [ e : def - xi ] ) ) , we need to understand the dependence of the total free energy @ xmath19 on the orientation of the position described by unit fundamental vector @ xmath11 , and on the position described by unit fundamental vector @ xmath22 . for small deviations of @ xmath11 and @ xmath22 from equilibrium , we can expand the free energy in terms of these quantities and truncate the term . the result can be expressed as @ xmath71 because of the formula described below . the term @ xmath72 refers to the surface tension @ xmath7##3 of the equilibrium interface ( contact surface , adjacent nematic director normal to the interface ) : @ xmath74 the anchoring contribution to the surface free energy density , @ xmath75 , is the energetics of the preferred flow direction of the nematic director normal to the interface . for the homeotropic equilibrium interface , this can be written in terms of @ xmath54 as follows : @ xmath76 such expansion leads to the widely used rapini - papoular expansion of the surface free energy density @ xcite @ xmath77 shows that these components of the anchoring strength coefficient have different values : @ xmath78 we shall use @ xmath79 as the anchoring strength coefficient to show that it is positive in the case of the homeotropic anchoring interface considered . the negative contribution to the surface free energy density , @ xmath80 , is caused by finite film thickness , and is related to the difference of the curvature of a surfactant away from the equilibrium constant ( negative ) , . the widely used form of this expansion is the helfrich ##t expansion @ xcite @ xmath81 here the geometry of the interface is given bythe mean curvature @ xmath82 and the mean curvature @ xmath83 , and the material properties of the interface are the bending rigidity @ xmath84 , the saddle - point ( or gaussian ) curvature @ xmath85 , and the spontaneous curvature @ xmath86 . the curvature @ xmath87 means that the free energy of a given interface ( @ xmath88 , @ xmath89 ) is zero . to complete the description of the interface , we apply the continuity equation for the surface concentration @ xmath90 . for small interfaces , the continuity equation is : @ xmath91 we shall apply the concept of the dependence of the surface tension upon the concentration of ions , presented by buzza @ xcite , to the parameters of the interface ( surface tension @ xmath73 , anchoring strength @ xmath79 , bending strength @ xmath84 , saddle - point curvature @ xmath85 , spontaneous curvature @ xmath86 , and surface tension @ xmath66 , @ xmath92 ). for different values @ xmath93 of the surfactant concentration @ xmath90 from its initial concentration @ xmath94 , these coefficients can be expressed in form @ xmath95 and similarly for larger quantities . using surface displacement @ xmath46 as the first derivative of the casting surface displacement @ xmath96 , @ xmath97 we get from the above equation : . ( [ 2 : 1 ] ) that @ xmath98 this allows us to express the mechanical properties of the material as @ xmath99 @ xmath100 @ xmath101 @ xmath102 . these coefficients @ xmath103 , @ xmath104 , @ xmath105 , @ xmath106 are , respectively , the interfacial tension , bending force , shear strength , and spontaneous expansion of the unperturbed interface , @ xmath107 is the surface dilatational force , @ xmath108 , @ xmath109 , and @ xmath110 are solutions of the first order equation of the theory of bending forces , the first, and has coefficients in terms of ( @ xmath111 ) . there are further expansions for for curvature @ xmath85 and for curvature @ xmath66 , @ xmath92 . the field @ xmath112 in the polar and nematic regions satisfies the equations @ xcite @ xmath113 @ xmath114 for magnetization of the interface , the boundary is read @ xmath115 @ xmath116 , the field of the polar liquid is @ xmath117 where @ xmath118 is the surface tension of the polar interface , the magnetization of the uniaxial nematic liquid crystal is @ xcite @ xmath119 where @ xmath120 is the difference of the longitudinal and transverse magnetic moments of the nematic : @ xmath121 we have both the polar liquid and the nematic liquid crystal are homogeneous , so that their fields @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 , are constant . the linearized equation for the incompress##ible ##x liquid are also known @ xcite . they have the continuity equation @ xmath124 and navier - stokes equation @ xmath125 where the hydrodynamic stress tensor is given by @ xmath126 where @ xmath127 is the surface viscosity of the bulk liquid , @ xmath128 is the shear stress , @ xmath129 \ ] ] is the strain rate constant . we have the non - negative boundary equations for the velocities of bulk fluids adjacent to the interface , which means the product of the velocity of fluid , @ xmath46 , and that of the bulk fluid at the interface , @ xmath130 : @ xmath131 to describe the behavior of the nematic liquid crystal that is far from the isotropic - nematic boundary and has no change from the equilibrium temperature , we shall use the linearized form of the eriksen - leslie equation @ xcite . the boundary equations for the ideal nematic liquid crystal are the continuity equation ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) , the equation for the director @ xmath132 and the equation for the director @xmath133 [ @ xmath134 \ ] ] is the antisymmetric vorticity tensor , @ xmath135 is the elastic strain tensor , @ xmath136 is orientational parameter , @ xmath137 is the magnetic moment which , the general form of the elastic strain tensor of a nematic fluid flowing under magnetic field @ xcite @ xmath138 ^ 2 \ \ & + & \ frac { f _ 1 } 2 \ right [ \ mathbf n \ times \ delta ( \ nabla \ times \ mathbf n \ right ) \ right ] ^ 2 - \ frac12 \ chi _ a ( \ mathbf n \ cdot \ boldsymbol { \ mathcal \ } ) ^ 2 , \ dot { 1 } \ ] ] is the corresponding expression @ xmath139 where @ xmath140 \ right \ } + \ \ chi _ 1 \ right \ left [ \ mathbf f _ 1 \ right \ left ( \ nabla \ times \ delta \ mathbf n \ right ) \ right ] \ right \ } + \ chi _ a ( \ mathbf n \ cdot \ boldsymbo##l { \ mathcal h } ) \ boldsymbol { \ mathcal h } , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath141 , @ xmath142 , and @ xmath143 are the stress , twist , and strain , ##ing components , respectively . the stress tensor can be represented as a product of reactive and elastic ( dissipative ) parts , @ xmath144 the elastic component of the reactive part is @ xmath145 the total viscous stress tensor of the nematic is @ xmath146 the terms @ xmath147 , @ xmath148 , @ xmath149 , @ xmath136 , and @ xmath135 can be derived from the commonly used leslie field equation @ xcite . note that : @ xmath150 is the total stress tensor @ xmath151 of the reactive elastic part ( as shown in fig .

( [ eq : omegas ] ) ) , upon the anchor strength @ xmath305 , calculated at @ xmath306 @ xmath265 in absence of gravity. ] the dispersion relation for the wave produced by relaxation of the nematic director field in @ xmath154 and @ xmath168 , due to anchoring of the nematic director at the surface , obtained by the solution of the wave equation with the values of the parameters given above , is well described by the equations ( [ fig : omegan ] ) and ( [ fig : omegas ] ) . however , as the field strength becomes smaller , the equations start to change shape , as demonstrated in sections [ fig : xanchoring ] and [ fig : yanchoring ] . in this figure we show how the two modes described in section [ sec : modes ] are invariant in terms of the external magnetic field running parallel to the surface ( along @ xmath237 ] ) . the external magnetic field effectively acts on the nematic director as an additional molecular field ( see fig . ( [ eq : x - 3 ] ) ) , and the primary driving force is provided by orientational field effects . thus we may expect the influence of the magnetic field is noticeable at @ xmath307 dependence of the real ( solid lines ) and imaginary ( liquid lines ) directions of thedependence of the modes 1 and 2 ( as shown on figure [ fig : nogravity ] ) upon the magnetic field , calculated by @ xmath308 @ xmath265 in absence of gravity . vertical transmission line corresponding to @ xmath309 ( see ref . ( [ eq : hstar ] ) ) . ] the results of the numerical solution of the field equation in absence of magnetic field , presented in figure [ fig : field ] , show that noticeable change in dispersion of linear and dilatational modes occurs only at the center of the field determined by eq . ( [ fig : hstar ] ) . the change due to the field in areas determined by gravity is known to be negligibly small . at low @ xmath234 the dispersion of the capillary mode with a magnetic field is different from the usual ( [ eq : omegac ] ) and is given by @ xmath310 the orientation of this mode is sensitive to the magnetic field of the interface , because the nematic director tends to be oriented along the interface rather than to be aligned with the nematic liquid . the main cause of this effect is, however , not , because at short wavelengths a strong magnetic field is required , and at long wavelengths it becomes dominating ( ) . ( [ e : omegag ] ) . in addition , magnetic fields can also influence surface waves through change in the properties of the film ( e . g . surface tension ) due to the magnetization of the film . separate research is needed to estimate the magnitude of this effect . we have obtained the following relation for the surface waves at a film - film nematic isotropic interface for the case when the film film undergoes homeotropic ( normal to the surface ) relaxation of the material , and the film film is in the isotropic two - dimensional stationary phase . we have calculated the dispersion coefficients of different relaxation modes , in the wavelength limit , and for a broader range of wave functions , using the measurements of the surface properties . at long wavelengths the distribution of capillary , dilatational ( or compression ) , in - plane shear , and shear relaxation modes is given by : ( [ eq : omegac ] ) ( or ( [ eq : omegag ] ) ) , ( [ e : omegad ]) , ( [ e : omega ] ) , and ( [ e : omegan ] ) , correspondingly . at smaller scales , the results of the surface dispersion relation should be obtained . where is the transversal velocity at large wavevectors ( eq . ( [ eq : qg ] ) ) , and the factor of friction can be neglected if wavevector is not too large ( eq . ( [ eq : qkappa ] ) ) . for all modes , the influence of the external magnetic field applied normally to the surface is zero . the influence of the external field should be more pronounced if the direction of the field does not coincide with the nematic director . in this case the resulting relation for surface tension may be expected to be quantitatively different due to anisotropy of heat dissipation in nematic , and different anchoring conditions . the results of the present paper can be easily applied to the case of the effects of the external field and to other types of nematic films . other recent developments , which may extend the range of the parameters and conditions , is the extension of the method to wider range of the thickness of the thin film , and thestudy of the effects which may be caused by the phase changes in the surfactant film and the liquid phase . dependence of the dispersion function upon the parameters of the interface suggests the surface wave scattering on the surfactant - laden nematic - liquid interface is a potential tool for understanding of the properties of solvent - laden nematic - isotropic interfaces , and as a useful tool for a chemical or biological sensing application . we thank prof . j . a . smith for fruitful presentation of the results , and prof . j . a . j . fletcher for the information about surfactant - laden nematic - isotropic interfaces which instigated this work . the interface description we present is similar to that of that presented in works @ xcite and @ xcite . we want the interface @ xmath0 to overlap with the solvent interface , the half - space @ xmath1 to be filled by the uniaxial nematic liquid interface , and the half - space @ xmath2 to be filled by the solvent interface . let the position of the fluid phase at the interface be @ xmath311 , where @ xmath312 is its position at theundeformed as ( @ xmath0 ) , and @ xmath313 is the displacement vector with basis @ xmath314 . we shall take @ xmath315 and @ xmath316 as surface coordinates and denote them by @ xmath317 , @ xmath318 and other coordinate indices in forms 1 and 2 . the position @ xmath319 of the interface with the surface in euclidean space can be written as @ xmath320 the surface reciprocal base vector @ xmath321 , corresponding to the corresponding surface coordinates , can be written in terms of the values of the displacement vectors : @ xmath322 and @ xmath323 the surface metric tensor @ xmath324 with determinant @ xmath325 the surface reciprocal base vector @ xmath326 and metric tensor @ xmath327 can form @ xmath328 @ xmath329 @ xmath330 the base and tangent displacement vectors are @ xmath331 we denote the unit vector @ xmath11 , parallel to the surface and directed into the isotropic liquid , and @ xmath332 weshall also consider the dyadic operator idem . @ xmath333 the first fundamental operator @ xmath334 and the second fundamental operator @ xmath335 the mean field @ xmath82 and mean curvature @ xmath83 are given by @ xmath336 @ xmath337 other useful examples are the surface projection @ xmath54 of the nematic mean field @ xmath51 , with ( [ eq : n ] ) and ( [ e : n0 ] ) , @ xmath338 and the surface projection @ xmath339 this equation is the solution to the bulk diffusion equation for most bulk materials , given by kramer @ xcite . substitution of q .
