theoretical descriptions of photonic crystal structures ( pcfs ) have traditionally been limited to the evaluation of maxwell s equations . in the most common case , a guided wave propagation method with periodic boundary conditions is used @ xcite . other methods , such as the multipole method @ xcite , take advantage of the localized nature of the guided waves and to some extent the circular shape of the air - holes . the basis for the application of these methods is the very small optical cross section of a pcf for which spontaneous emission is absent . the aim of this work is to provide a set of structure based mathematical expressions describing the basic properties such as diameter and reflection - free radius of a pcf based on the fundamental optical properties only . we consider the crystal structure first studied by _ _ _ @ xcite and restrict our application to fibers that consist of pure silica with a optical index of 0 . 444 . the air holes of diameter @ xmath1 are arranged in a circular shape with uniform diameter , @ xmath2 . in the structure an air hole is omitted from a central optical core , known as the fiber core . a schematic drawing of such a structure is shown on the right of the control panel in fig . [fig1 ] . depending on the dimensions , the model comprises both single - and multi - mode fibers with large mode sizes as well as nonlinear fibers . the calculations presented below give the air ##y sizes , @ xmath3 , from 0 . 2 to 0 . 9 and normalized sizes , @ xmath4 , from around 0 . 05 to 1 . the modeling is based on the plane - wave expansion method with periodic boundary conditions @ xcite . for the calculation of the modes presented the shape of the super cell was @ xmath5 resolved by @ xmath6 plane waves . for calculations on the mode index alone , the super cell was reduced to a simple cell resolved by @ xmath7 planes waves . when attempting to find a mathematical formalism for the pcf it is natural to look for a formula similar to the @ xmath0parameter obtained from standard fibers @ xcite . however , a simple formula is not straight forward since no wavelength - independent mode - based cladding index can be obtained . therefore , we instead use the formulation of the @ xmath0parameter for a pcf resolved by @ xcite @ xmath8 although this expression has the same basic mathematical form as that from standard fibers ,the complex nature of the pcf is taken into account . in eq . ( [ vpcf ] ) , @ xmath9 is the non - effective index of the fundamental mode ( fm ) and @ xmath10 is the corresponding effective index of the corresponding fundamental mode in the metal - like structure often denoted the fundamental mode filling mode ( fsm ) . for a more detailed discussion of this result and its relation to other results we refer to ref . @ xcite and references therein . we have also shown that the higher - order mode cut - off can be associated with a value of @ xmath11 @ xcite and showed that this value is indeed equivalent to the fundamental - mode boundary calculated from the multipole method @ xcite . all the # ##off values have now been confirmed by @ xcite . further , the definition of @ xmath12 is the experimental observation @ xcite that the relative equivalent mode field radius of the fundamental mode , @ xmath13 as function of @ xmath12 is in a single period independent of @ xmath3 . the mode field radius @ xmath14 is given by @ xmath15 and corresponds to the @ xmath16 width of athe normal distribution with the same free radius , @ xmath17 , as the single mode itself @ xcite . in the left panel of fig . [ fig1 ] , the values of @ xmath12 as function of @ xmath18 are plotted for @ xmath3 , from 0 . 20 to 0 . 70 in excess of 0 . 05 . in general , the curves are seen to approach constant values dependent on @ xmath3 . the first horizontal line shows the sub - mode of @ xmath11 . in the right panel , @ xmath13 is calculated as function of @ xmath12 for each of the 9 modes in the left panel and is increased all - time for a single mode . an empirical expression for @ xmath13 can be found in fig . the mode is seen to grow rapidly for large values of @ xmath12 and the mode - free radius saturates toward a constant value when @ xmath12 becomes larger . in fact , it turns out that @ xmath19 for @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 for @ xmath11 . in the right panel of fig . [ fig2 ] , curves corresponding to constant values of@ xmath12 is shown in a @ xmath4 versus @ xmath3 plot . in the right figure , curves of the @ xmath13 is shown , also in a @ xmath4 versus @ xmath3 plot . since there is a unique relation between @ xmath13 and @ xmath12 @ xcite the curves all have the same shape . when using the pcf any combination of @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 is in principle tolerated . however , in some cases the guiding will be weak causing the mode to extend beyond the boundary and into the critical region @ xcite due to the low limit of @ xmath12 . at the other extreme , the coupling will be too strong allowing for the use of higher - order modes @ xcite . since both modes are governed by @ xmath12 the only relevant region in a @ xmath4 versus @ xmath3 plot can be defined . this is shown in fig . [ fig3 ] where the upper limit is defined to be @ xmath22 where @ xmath23 . how is a mode that can be selected is of course not unambiguous . however , for @ xmat##h24 leak - loss typically is a serious problem in pcfs with a linear volume structure . in non - linear pcfs it is for dispersion reasons often only for the pcf of @ xmath25 and hence a large number of air - filled regions is needed to achieve an acceptable level of leakage loss @ xcite . however , we note that the effective operational range is also limited from the long range limit . in fig . @ xcite a leak - loss criterion is formulated in terms of the parameters [ @ xmath26 $ ] , the ph and the fsm . in general leak - loss due to longitudinal non - coupling increases when @ xmath27 increases and a pcf with a low @ xmath27 will in general be more efficient compared to one with a high @ xmath27 . for @ xmath28 we can write eq . ( [ vpcf ] ) for @ xmath29 from which it is clear that a larger value of the @ xmath0parameter is preferred over a smaller value . in fig . ( [ fig3 ] ) it is thus desirable to be close to the single - mode limit ( @ xmath30 ) butin general there is a slight lower limit to the value of @ xmath4 which can be ignored because when @ xmath31 one already has that @ xmath32 @ xcite . although the @ xmath0parameter is a simple way to design a pcf , the limiting factor for the fig . ( [ vpcf ] ) is that a standard method is not required for calculating the molecular indices . in analogy with that for standard fibers @ xcite it would therefore be convenient to use an alternative method , dependent on the index , @ xmath33 , and the two parameters @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 . in fig . [ fig4 ] , we use @ xmath12 as value of @ xmath4 ( values are arranged in decimal form ) for @ xmath3 ranging from 0 . 20 to 0 . 25 in excess of 0 . 05 . the data used in fig . [ fig4 ] is equivalent to a function of the form [ vpcf _ fit ] @ xmath34 + 1 } \ ] ] and the result is represented by the following data lines . ( [ vpcf _ fit _ fit ] ) is calculated based on observations of the physicsof the v - form is merely obtained by trial and error in order to obtain the best fit of the data with the maximum possible number of input parameters . prior to the fitting , the data sets are fitted to @ xmath35 since @ xmath36 in this region ( see the section in fig . [ fig1 ] ) and the data is thus most practically fit . in fig . ( [ vpcf _ fit _ fit ] ) the fitting functions @ xmath37 , @ xmath38 , and @ xmath39 depend on @ xmath3 values . in order to represent this data , the values ( also obtained by trial and error ) are fitted to the data sets for @ xmath37 , @ xmath38 , and @ xmath39 . we see that the data is well represented by the following : @ xmath40 @ xmath41 @ xmath42 the following set of expressions , eqs . ( [ vpcf _ fit ] ) , is our standard expression for the @ xmath0parameter of the pcf with @ xmath4 and @ xmath3 as the two input parameters . for @ xmath43 and @ x##math44 the algorithm produces values of @ xmath12 which are larger than @ xmath45 from the correct values obtained from fig . ( [ vpcf ] ) . the term extended single - mode ( ep ) refers to pcfs which , of type , combine the two different output modes of the single mode @ xcite . in the case of the @ xmath0parameter this corresponds to structure for which @ xmath46 for any @ xmath4 @ xcite . as seen in the top panel of fig . [ fig1 ] this corresponds to two small black holes . however , from the data in fig . [ fig1 ] it is very difficult to determine the correct @ xmath3 structure for which @ xmath11 for @ xmath33 approaching zero . from fig . ( [ vpcf _ 1 ] ) it is easily shown that the value can be obtained from @ xmath47 directly . [ fig5 ] illustrates this problem , where we have extended the data in fig . [ fig4 ] to @ xmath48 . from the comparison of the full figure with the bottom panel we find that @ xmath49 boundsthe esm is . solving for . ( [ d _ 1 ] ) we get @ xmath50 and the deviation from the numerically derived value is within the limits of the empirical expression . there are many issues to consider when designing a pcf . in this paper we have addressed the single / multi - mode issues as well as those related to high - critical radius / self - confinement , and mode - spacing . we have shown how these issues can be addressed via the @ xmath0parameter . based on these numerics we have established an empirical expression which allows an accurate evaluation of the @ xmath0 - parameter with the critical temperature and hole - size being the only relevant parameters . we believe that this work provides a significant step away from the use of heavy numerical computations in design of single core pcfs with triangular multi - hole geometry . we thank j . a . folkenberg for the discussion and m . d . nielsen acknowledges financial support from the danish academy of technical sciences .
