high q sources such as whispering - mode ( wgm ) lasers have already achieved q values ( @ xmath0 ) as high as @ xmath3 and have shown the potential to reach even higher q values @ xcite . however , there are limitations in measurement of the linewidth and q of such high q values . while in theory , the q factor could be as high as @ xmath4 and be limited only by light scattering @ xcite , in practice , it is limited by other losses in the cavity . they include absorption and emission losses due to impurities in the cavity material , and noise - induced losses due to nonlinear processes . due to the very small input frequency and high q - factor of the cavity , the cavity build - up rate is extremely high , especially in the case of an input with small power ( as small as several mw ) . such a high input frequency leads to very efficient nonlinear processes inside wgm sources , such as raman scattering , nonlinear harmonic generation , and plane - wave mixing @ xcite . whereas this is useful in many applications , it introduces additional losses in the cavity and thus makes the q factor very low ( at least , making the q -2 ) @ xcite . squeezed fields of vacuum or light have been used in many applications such as improvement of interferometric @ xcite and absorption @ xcite techniques , for quantum teleportation @ xcite and quantum transmission @ xcite , and for quantum filtering @ xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , no experiment for measurement of cavity q by use of squeezing has yet been performed . in this paper we propose and describe an alternative method of measuring q factors by means of a squeezed input field which is equivalent to a field with correlated quantum sidebands @ xcite . this technique is advantages over conventional optical techniques in that it allows the transmission of squeezed light into the vacuum cavity not to excite the quantum processes in the cavity . when the input field is detuned from the cavity resonance field , it transmits only the upper and lower quantum sidebands of the cavity linewidth , reflecting the counterparts ( the upper or lower sidebands ) and all the other sidebands . the linewidth of the cavity can then be measured by considering the destruction of the difference between the upper and lower quantum sidebands with respect to the carrier frequency . we show that the linewidth and q factor ofthe test cavity using the method agrees with those obtained by traditional optical methods . this paper is summarized as follows : in sec . [ sect : theory1 ] , we outline the theoretical framework for the new method . in sec . [ sect : theory2 ] , we explain the validity of the use of squeezed vacuum as a probe for non - linear measurements and return the technique to such a theoretical framework . in sec . [ sect : theory ] , we test the method in a test cavity with the cavity parameters and compare the parameter values obtained by the new method and the traditional optical methods . the conclusions of the paper are summarized in sec .

( similarly for @ xmath19 , @ xmath32 , @ xmath50 , and @ xmath51 ) . a little further describes the amplitude and phase field representation of the incident light in the matrix form , @ xmath52 where we have the matrix- -

matched measured amplitude and phase quadrature variances @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 to : @ xmath71 \ left ( \ begin { array } { cc } 1 \ \ 1 \ end { array } \ right ) \ nonumber \ \ & & \ hspace { - 1 . 0 \ } + \ eta _ l ( 1 -

coupled and cavity - coupled reflection respectively , @ xmath74 is the coupling of the reflection , and @ xmath75 . the detection efficiency is the product of the detection efficiency of the photodiodes and the time - complexity associated with the lo ##ci . 1 . can be expressed in terms of the spectral coupling of the incident field @ xmath76 since the cavity - coupled reflection @ xmath77 and the cavity - coupled reflection @ xmath78 come from the same incident field @ xmath76 , so that @ xmath79 and therefore , @ xmath80 \ left ( \ begin { array } { cc } v _ 1 ^ { a } \ \ v _ 2 ^ { a } \ begin { array } \ right ) \ nonumber \ \ & & \ hspace { -

coupled input field is composed of the quantum sidebands within the linewidth and the associated quantum sidebands outside of them . the result is the destruction of the correlation of the linewidth between the upper and lower quantum sidebands . this is analogous to the destruction of the correlation between electro - acoustic modulated quantum sidebands in fm , in which the beat between thecarrier and the upper and lower sideband can be detected only when one sideband is transmitted into the cavity , leaving the upper and lower sideband . the signal could only be detected if all the carriers were present . similar measurements could be made with the transmission of the external reflected signal into the cavity . however , the signal - to - noise ratio would not be as good as in the above example because the frequency of the reflected signal is only zero . it is convenient to define the effective spectral linewidth @ xmath83 , the transfer function @ xmath0 , and the parameters @ xmath84 , and @ xmath85 \ nonumber \ \ & \ simeq & \ frac { \ - \ sqrt { r _ 1r _ 2r _ 3 } } { \ pi ( r _ 1 r _ 2 ##r _ 3 ) ^ { 1 / 2 } } \ , \ int _ { \ rm fsr } , \ int { \ } \ ] ] @ xmath86 and @ xmath87 \ . the parameters are in ref . and are valid for all the cavities . @ xmath88 , @ xmath89 , @xmath22 , and @ xmath38 can be used as free energy parameters . we will assume the optical mirror is chosen so that @ xmath90 . since we are interested in getting as much light ( at the carrier level ) as possible from the squeezed vacuum , it is reasonable to calculate the average photon number in the field we observe . the average photon number of squeezed light with squeeze angle @ xmath91 and squeeze angle @ xmath92 is given by @ xcite @ xmath93 where @ xmath94 is the coherent level of the light . when the number of squeezed photons approaches zero ( @ xmath95 ) , resulting in reduced light , eq . becomes @ xmath96 this is the average photon number in the field generated by squeezing . note that if the field is unsqueezed ( @ xmath97 ) , @ xmath98 . for a correction factor of 1 . 5 , to the squeezed or anti - squeezed level of @ xmath99 , which is the average experimental value @ xcite , @ xmath100 . therefore , it is fair to assume that the overall influence of the squeezed field oncavities are shown . and @ xmath101 are shown as solid and liquid lines , respectively , for different input states . ( a ) and ( b ) show the ( classical ) noisy state with @ xmath102 db and @ xmath103 db , _ in the absence of the cavity _ . ( c ) and ( d ) show the cavity - coupled response to the squeezed and anti - squeezed signal injection , respectively . ( e ) and ( f ) show the cavity - coupled response to injection of a classical noisy state with @ xmath104 db , @ xmath105 db . comparing ( e ) and ( c ) , we note that this changes the signal intensity , but the squeezed state and the anti - squeezed quadrature behave almost identically [ cf . ( e ) and ( f ) ] . ] therefore , it is possible to compare this technique to using a classical filter . for example , assuming that the signal intensity in both states is frequency - independent , we consider the case in which the lower sideband is fully reflected at the impedance - coupled cavity and the upper sideband is fully reflected at the input , such that @ xmath##106 and @ xmath107 and @ xmath108 , respectively , which gives @ xmath109 from fig . 2 , the amplitude and phase quadrature variance of the orthogonal signal are found to be @ xmath110 in the case of coherent signals , the signal contrast can be defined as the quadrature variance at detuning frequencies @ xmath22 relative to the cavity - uncoupled quadrature variance at off - resonance frequencies ( @ xmath111 ) , in which case @ xmath112 and @ xmath113 , and the signal contrast between the two orthogonal signals are respectively given by @ xmath114 in the special case of @ xmath115 and @ xmath116 , we obtain @ xmath117 we see that @ xmath118 has about the same noise level as in the general case , but @ xmath119 grows if @ xmath120 is smaller . classically , @ xmath121 ( the minimum noise level ) , but in a vacuum we can obtain @ xmath122 , gives the signal contrast for the case of the interferencequadrature . this is illustrated in fig . [ x _ vs _ sq ] , where we compare the signal contrast for measurements of the cavity linewidth using the classical method with the signal contrast for squeezed variance measurements . the cavity - specific values of the classical and non - classical quadrature variances behave almost similarly in the case of the impedance - matched cavity , whereas squeezing improves the signal contrast of the measurement . it is important to note that even in the absence of these limitations , the variance ##s is intrinsically contaminated by shot noise itself . the standard deviation of the squeezed variance is given by @ xcite @ xmath123 thus , the noise of the measurement is proportional to the measured value itself , and weighted averages can be performed to achieve smaller noise levels . this is different from the classical case where the properties of the cavity are measured by measuring the strength of a specific optical field incident on the cavity as a result of cavity detuning . in this case , the measurements are not contaminated by shot noise : the number of transmitted photons ( n ) has been reduced to @ xmath124 . therefore , the signal - to - noise ratio increases as the number of the transmitted photon increases . .and @ xmath125 ( ) . the squeezed vacuum generator is composed of an optical parametric generator ( opo ) and a second harmonic generator ( shg ) that pumps the opo . the pulse length is locked to the laser frequency by the pdh - locking mechanism and pzt ( pzt2 ) . the homodyne length is controlled by the q - locking servo and pzt ( pzt1 ) . ] the setup is schematically shown in fig . [ setup ] . the d : yag laser ( lightwave # 126 ) has an output of cw 700 mw at 1064 nm , which is fed into the squeezed vacuum generator ( squeezer ) . the generator is composed of a second harmonic generator ( shg ) and an optical harmonic generator ( opo ) , both with 5 @ xmath126 mgo : linbo @ xmath29 ##0 crystals exist within two domains ( hemilith for the shg and spin for the opo ) in the type i phase - matching mode . the shg used in the d : yag laser generates 250 mw at 532 nm , which then pumps the op##o - threshold with a mirror cavity . the vacuum field generated by the opo is a squeezed vacuum field with a squeezing bandwidth of 0 . 1 mhz defined by the opo cavity linewidth . a non - squeezed field , frequency - shifted by an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) to a frequency that is compatible with the cavity tem @ xmath127 mode , is injected into the other half of the opo cavity . the cavity is then locked to the tem @ xmath127 mode , defined by 220 mhz from the carrier frequency , using the pound - drever - smith ( pdh ) locking technique @ xcite . the frequency - shift is necessary to ensure that a cavity of light with the desired frequency is injected into the opo cavity since it acts as a seed and prevents unwanted absorption due to the high isolation of the faraday isolator @ xcite . this is especially important for large q bands with linewidths as narrow as possible because low - frequency squeezing is difficult to achieve . the squeezed vacuum is injected into a triangular mirror cavity with the fsr of 713 khz and fwhm of @ xmath2 mode , as obtained by traditional methods .2 . the frequency shift , of the subcarrier is @ xmath128 mhz so that the carrier frequency is detuned from the tem @ xmath129 mode to @ xmath130 mhz . as a result of this frequency shift , only the lower sidebands remain within the cavity linewidth , reducing the correlation between the upper and lower sidebands and , therefore , causing the squeezing and anti - squeezing . this cross - coupled squeezed vacuum reflection is measured by balanced homodyne analysis , where the signal to be measured interferes with the local oscillator ( lo ) field and is detected by two ( almost ) identical photodetectors . the difference of the two photodetector signals is sent to an hp4195a spectrum analysis ( sa ) to measure the noise variance of the squeezed or anti - squeezed quadrature . the results are shown in fig . [ linewidth ] . the sa data is then averaged 100 khz . the resolution limit of the sa analysis is 100 khz . since the squeezed vacuum does not have a coherent phase , the noise - reduction technique @ xcite is employed to measure the homodyne angle to either the squeezed or anti - squeezed[ = 2 mhz . etc . ] when comparing the experimental data points , the homodyne efficiency @ xmath131 and @ xmath132 , and the quantum efficiency of the free - mirrors @ xmath133 need to be taken into account . the sum of the homodyne efficiencies and the quantum efficiency are then measured to be @ xmath134 and @ xmath135 respectively . the sum of the efficiencies @ xmath136 in fig . is given by @ xmath137 . we use @ xmath132 since the cavity phase - shift frequency is @ xmath138 and not @ xmath139 , which yields @ xmath140 . moreover , we have assumed that the output signal of @ xmath141 is lossless . this assumption is correct since it has no band - gap loss and does not change the linewidth of the cavity . we then compare fig . to the experimental data points with free mirrors @ xmath88 , @ xmath142 , and @ xmath22 ; both the results and the assumptions are shown in fig . [linewidth ] . the optical fitting values are @ xmath143 , and @ xmath144 khz . therefore , the fwhm linewidth of the cavity is found to be @ xmath145 khz , which agrees with the actual measured linewidth of the cavity without the loss ( @ xmath2 factor ) . we found that @ xmath38 can be determined from the fit , but here we have used the optically fit value to estimate the linewidth . this is important because the loss in the cavity does not change the fsr . we have developed and successfully demonstrated a technique for non - linear measurement of the cavity parameters by injection of squeezed vacuum . the technique has the advantage over other fitting methods that the use of a squeezed vacuum field as a probe for cavity parameters does not excite any nonlinear processes in cavities , and is , therefore , suitable for ultrahigh q ##os such as wall - mounted ( wgm ) cavities . we have shown that when a squeezed vacuum field is injected into a detuned cavity , the linewidth and @ xmath0 factor of a squeezed cavity can be determined by measuring the destruction of theand lower quantum sidebands with respect to the reference frequency . the linewidth of the mirror cavity is measured to be @ xmath146 khz , which agrees with the actual measured linewidth of the cavity without the mirror ( @ xmath147 khz ) . we can also say that the use of squeezed mirrors leads to better signal quality , as well . we would like to thank our colleagues at the ligo project , including thomas corbitt and peter wipf , and stan whitcomb for his valuable work on the manuscript . we also have support from national science foundation grants nos . phy - 0107417 and phy - 0457264 .
