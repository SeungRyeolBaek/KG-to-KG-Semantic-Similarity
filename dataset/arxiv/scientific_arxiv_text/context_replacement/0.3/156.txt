it has long been thought that electro - magnetic particles _ i . e . _ photon _ _ photons would provide a way to study the behavior of a quark - proton plasma in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions . the energy distribution of the photon would allow to measure the temperature of the plasma provided the rate of decay in the plasma exceeds that of various particles . it is expected that this would occur in a small window in the gev range for the energy of the photon . at lower values of the temperature the plasma is dominated by the hadron decay processes and at higher values the most hard processes ( those occurring in the very early stage of the plasma before the plasma is formed ) , calculable by the perturbative qcd methods , would dominate . in contrast to hadronic observables ( see also quarkonia ) which are related to the time evolution of the plasma as well as to the post - hadronisation processes , the photons in the gev range are produced immediately after the plasma is formed and thus they escape the plasma without any interaction . we have the plasma in thermal equilibrium ( temperature t ) with the chemical potential . the rate of decay , per unit mass and energy , of a realpair of momentum @ xmath0 is @ xmath1 . for a photon pair of momentum @ xmath2 it is @ xmath3 where @ xmath4 is the retarded spin polarisation tensor . the pre - factor @ xmath5 is the necessary quantum number @ xmath6 when @ xmath7 . this report is related to the study of @ xmath8 which describes the weak interaction interactions of holes and electrons in the plasma . the theoretical framework is that of the string theory with the - " hard " scale ( htl ) @ xcite . we first discuss the properties of @ xmath9 , according to the one - dimensional approximation . the phenomenological consequences are mentioned . then we turn to a discussion of the order corrections . following the htl approach @ xcite one takes two scales : the energy " scale , " of order @ xmath10 or greater ( the interaction of quarks and electrons in the plasma ) and the soft " scale of order @ xmath11 where @ xmath12 , the weak interaction , is assumed to be small . the effects in the plasma at the energy " scale @xmath11 _ i . e . _ for the distances of @ xmath13 . these results lead to a modification of the operators and vertices of the theory and mathematics that led to the new ( re - multiplied ) operators and vertices . this is easily illustrated with the example of the free particle , @ xmath14 , which in the 3 " dimension is soft @ xmath15 ( we neglect spin operators and use only a dimensional analysis ) . the thermal contribution to the second dimension of @ xmath16 is assumed to be @ xmath17 which is of the same order as the effective propagator when @ xmath18 is of interest @ xmath19 . the re - multiplied correction @ xmath20 is then deeply modified for momenta of @ xmath21 whereas the resulting effects are essentially as second order effects for thermal loops . similarly , the effective operators and vertices are modified by hard thermal loops when the resulting momenta are soft @ xcite . one can construct the effective lagrangian @ xcite in terms of the operators and vertices and calculate observables in perturbation theory . in theone - loop approximation , the photon production rate is given by the diagrams shown in fig . [ fig : 1loop ] where the term @ xmath22 indicates that only propagators and vertices are effective . the result has been known for some time and can be expressed , in simplified form , as @ xcite @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 is related to the thermal expansion of the quark . one notes the presence of a large " constant term @ xmath25 dominating by a small term " @ xmath26 . the two - loop diagrams are shown in fig . [ fig : 2loop ] . in principle , there are more combinations of the quantum numbers but only those leading to the largest contribution are used . all propagators and vertices should be effective but since the largest contribution comes from bare particles it is necessary , following the htl strategy , to keep the fermion lines and - 15pt ##e as well . only the photon line needs to be effective since the momentum @ xmath27 through the gluon line dominates the contribution . to understand these diagrams it is necessary to distinguish between the contribution arising from a time - independent source ( @xmath28 ) and a second ##time diagram ( @ xmath29 ) . the second type leads to a result similar to fig . ( [ eq : 1loop ] ) and requires more calculations . half - lines ( not shown ) eliminate the effect of the two - loop diagrams already contained in the one - loop diagram @ xcite . we concentrate on the second case which in terms of physical physics corresponds to bremsstrahlung ##s of a photon as part of a spin - antiquark annihilation process where part of the photon is put in - balance by particles in the plasma ( see fig . [ fig : processes ] ) . the expression for hard momentum is @ xcite @ xmath30 the reason why these two - loop contributions have the same effect as the one - loop diagrams is due to the presence of strong gauge singularities . to obtain @ xmath9 one has to consider the situation as shown by the red - dotted diagram in fig . [ fig : 2loop ] . in the sum of the total hard momentum @ xmath31 ( with @ xmath32 , @ xmath33 on top ) the denominators @ xmat##h34 and @ xmath35 of the non - interacting fermion type will also vanish when @ xmath36 is parallel to @ xmath37 _ i . e . _ in the collinear direction . this leads to an additional case of type @ xmath38 where the cut - off @ xmath39 disappears from the calculation . for the kinematic case of given to us here , @ xmath40 means that the two - loop diagram is enhanced by the process @ xmath41 which makes the @ xmath42 decrease due to the coupling of the photon to the quarks . another interesting result of the theory is the existence of process ii of fig . [ fig : 2 ] which deals with the decay of the photon and dominates over the other processes when @ xmath43 as shown in fig . [ fig : compar ] . phenomenological tests of these results have been carried out and the two - loop processes have been included in the standard models to estimate the lifetime of the particle ##s @ rhic @ lhc @ xcite . it is known that the two - loop processes ( replacing the annihilation with scattering ) lead to an increase inan order of magnitude compared to the single - loop level . this could also have consequences for heavy ion collisions at sps and @ xcite . several factors may explain these over - optimistic predictions : prediction of chemical equilibrium and more importantly second order , as discussed next . since the single - loop and multi - loop results are of the same scale it is pointless to worry about the convergence of the perturbative expansion to the effective temperature ! the # ##s operative at single - loop could also be at work at the multi - loop level especially in ladder diagrams , an example of which is shown in fig . [ fig : ladder ] : indeed many " " fermion denominators appear in ladder diagrams which can produce a pile - up of collinear singularities . a detailed analysis of the three - loop ladder diagram shows that @ xcite @ xmath44 where @ xmath45 is the largest of the cut - offs : + @ xmath46 , which is the collinear cut - off shown above : it depends on the thermal electron mass and charge ( @ xmath47 ) as well as on the state variables ; + @ xmath48 , the debye number if the added charge is longitudinal , or @xmath49 if m is transverse . + for the kinematic case of m , in the case of an infinite longitudinal regulator one can see that @ xmath50 and the debye mass appears as a trade - off with the result that the three - loop contribution is reduced by a factor @ xmath12 compared to the two - loop . on the contrary , for a transverse regulator , the regulators are of length @ xmath51 ( as long as @ xmath52 ) and the three - loop contribution is of the same order as the two - loop contribution . one is therefore in a non - perturbative regime . the problem is similar to the magnetic mass problem pointed out by linde in the perturbative regime of the kinetic equation @ xcite , except that here m appears at leading order . another effect which can modify the coupling enhancement mechanism is change to the local coupling rate . indeed , changing the coupling rate on the field lines , can move the direction of the coupling away from the z axis : this is the coupling mechanism dependent on the non - coupling of the denominators . removing the requirement of gauge coupling and concentrating only .the mathematical effect of changing the input to the region is we can use again the closed - form method with different propagators including the damping of @ xmath53 . the result is intuitively simple as the behaviour of the region @ xcite @ xmath54 acts out , with @ xmath55 as above . the effect of @ xmath56 on @ xmath57 is shown on fig . [ fig : 2 ] for the production of a virtual photon ( @ xmath58 ) . the region @ xmath59 is dominated by bremsstrahlung emission while the region @ xmath60 receives the signal mainly from the annihilation with scattering effects ( see fig . [ fig : compar ] ) . the top result is the result , with a very small error . one notes the change in the @ xmath61 behaviour of @ xmath62 as @ xmath56 increases : this is due to the different @ xmath61 behaviour of the real and imaginary parts of @ xmath63 . for virtual photon production , one notes that the region @ xmath64 varies with @ xmath65 and with @ xmat##h61 means that the ratio @ xmath66 , which controls the relative importance of the photon , decreases . for @ xmath65 large enough the effect of @ xmath56 will be negligible and the two - loop calculation should be adequate . this is illustrated in fig . [ fig : 2 ] . equation ( [ eq : damping ] ) lends itself to a simple interpretation . it can be written as @ xmath67 where @ xmath68 is the mean free path of the photon in the plasma and @ xmath69 can be taken to be the formation time of the photon . however , if @ xmath70 the effect of the scale factor can be ignored and the other higher order effects are ignored . in the opposite direction , light - scattering in the plasma affects the two - loop calculation . this is equivalent to saying that the thomson - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @ xcite has to be taken into account in the calculation . two interesting results emerge from the above equation : 1 ) the lpm effect not only modifies the energy of bremsstrahlung , but also that of the hard photons emitted by the annih##ilation with " " , as shown in fig . [ 1 : 1 ] ; 2 ) if the virtuality @ xmath71 of the hard photon pair is large , then one falls in the region @ xmath72 and the perturbative result at two - loop is sufficient . the problems discussed above are an example of a more complicated situation of photon energy s ##n with external sources close to the z - cone @ xcite . the production mechanism of hard photon in the domain is very complex . new problems arise at two - loop which can increase the rate of photon production calculated at one - loop . however , for real and small mass , ##ity the higher order effects are important and the result turns out to be non - perturbative . taking into account higher order effects to obtain a better estimate remains to be done . we thank f . gelis , r . kobes and h . zaraket for their fruitful collaboration on the problems discussed above .
