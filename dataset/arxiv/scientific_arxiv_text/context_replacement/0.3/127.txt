it is common knowledge that braking of pulsars is caused by the electro - magnetic field of the surrounding magnetic field . in this case the rate of change of the neutron star rotational energy can be related to the rate of the anti - magnetic moment : @ xmath1 + where _ i _ is the moment of inertia of the neutron star , @ xmath2 - the angular frequency of its rotation , @ xmath3 - the magnetic moment , @ xmath0 - the angle between the rotation time and the magnetic moment , _ r _ - speed of rotation . for two measurements of neutron stars : mass of order of the solar mass ( @ xmath4 ) and mass _ i _ of order of @ xmath5 , we can put _ i _ = @ xmath6 . for the magnetic moment we get @ xmath7 + where @ xmath8 is the magnetic induction at the magnetic poles , @ xmath9 ? the induction at the magnetic equator . instead of @ xmath2 the rotation period @ xmath10 is usually used and we can get from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : @ xmath11 + this formula isuse it to calculate magnetic induction of objects such that @ xmath12 for all objects . the known catalogs ( however , for example manchester et al . , 2005 ) contain as a rule @ xmath9 instead of @ xmath8 . so we propose to use the argument for the value of @ xmath13 and use the values of this argument to obtain more accurate values of pulsar magnetic induction . in a few of our papers ( malov & nikitina , 2011a , b , 2013 ) , methods for calculation of the angle @ xmath0 have been put forward and applied to some catalogs of objects ( keith et al . , 2010 ; van ommen et al . , 1997 ; weltevrede & johnston , 2008 ) at approximately 10 , 20 and 20 ##Â° . the equations for this aim are ( taylor & taylor , 1977 ) : @ xmath14 @ xmath15 + 1 @ xmath16 is the angle between the line of sight and the optical axis , @ xmath17 - the angular width of the observed line , @ xmath18 - the reciprocal of the angular width of the observed line , @ xmath##19 - the position angle of the pulse width , @ xmath20 - 0 . the simplest case for the calculation of the angle @ xmath0 is found when the line of sight passes through the center of the rotation period , i . e . @ xmath21 + in this case we can use the dependence of the maximum pulse width @ xmath22 at the @ xmath23 region on the rotation period and use the lower bound of the rotation region to obtain @ xmath24 + . the result we get from ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ( malov & nikitina , 2011a ) : @ xmath25 + the values of the calculated by this method are known as @ xmath26 and appear in the table below . usually the calculations are made at the pulse width and . in this case we can calculate the maximal value of the position angle . from ( 3 ) we obtain @ xmath27 we can calculate from the value of @ xmath22 _ _ p _ by the least squares method @ xmath28 + the third equation for the calculations of the angle @ xmath0 is ( 4 ) . from these three equations we obtain @ x##math29y ^ 2 + 2c ( d - b ^ 2 ) y + c ^ 2 ^ 2 - b ^ 2 ( d + c ^ 2 ) = [ . \ \ \ ] ] + calculate @ xmath30 + we can transform the equation ( 10 ) to the form : @ xmath31 + then finding the value of y from the equation ( 10 ) we can calculate @ xmath0 from ( 11 ) . we have found values of @ xmath0 by this method and list them in the table below as @ xmath32 . then we find the error in the equation ( 11 ) found in our calculation ( malov & nikitina , 2011a , b , 2013 ) . there is an alternative way to calculate y @ xmath0 . this way uses the ##s of the coordinates and values of the profiles for the points . in this way , the equations use the following system for calculation of the values @ xmath17 , @ xmath16 and @ xmath0 : @ xmath33 as the different pulsar profiles take different values , the y _ n _ takes a different value depending on a profile chosen . we choose arbitrary the valuesvalue of _ n _ ( 14 . 4 ) . if the ratio of the intensity @ xmath34 in the center of the system to the maximal intensity @ xmath35 is , then @ xmath36 . for @ xmath37 @ xmath38 , @ xmath39 @ xmath40 , @ xmath41 @ xmath42 , and for @ xmath43 @ xmath44 . it is worth noting that the solution of the equation ( 14 ) can be found easily for any value of _ n _ . for example , if @ xmath45 , the solution for @ xmath46 can be found from the following : @ xmath47 for n = 4 : @ xmath48 y ^ 2 + 2c \ left [ d ^ 2 ( 1 + d - d ^ 2 ) - d - 5 \ right ] y ^ 4 + \ left [ 2dc ^ 2 ( 1 - 5 ) - \ . . . - d ^ 2 ( c ^ 2 - 6d + 7 ) + 5 \ right ] y ^ 4 + 2c \ right [ c ^ 2 y ^ 2 + d ( 1 + d ^ 2 ) - d ( d ^( - 1 ) \ \ ] y + c ^ 2 d ^ 2 ( y + c ^ 2 ) - ( y ^ 2 - d ) ^ 2 = 0 ; \ \ \ { { 0 } \ ] ] at n = 5 / 2 : @ xmath49 \ sqrt { \ frac { y + \ frac { c + d } { \ sqrt { c ^ 2 + 2cy + d } } } { \ } } - c y ^ 2 ( y - cd ) - y - cd = 0 ; \ ] ] at n = 5 / 2 : @ xmath50 this table gives angles @ xmath51 ( see the table 1 ) . for some years calculations were done by one method only . when it became possible we used two or even three methods . in these cases , the maximum value of the angle @ xmath0 has been calculated . the resulting angles @ xmath52 are given in the table 1 . some other authors ( for example , kuzmin & dagkesamanskaya , 1983 ; kuzmin et al . , 1984 ; lyne & smith , 1988 ) carried out calculations of the angle @ xmath0 } for the shorter range of the##ars makes some interesting observations . we can develop further our method to estimate magnetic inductions at the center of the neutron star . the distribution of the angle @ xmath0 from the table 1 ( fig . 2 ) shows that the majority of stars have rather high inclinations of the magnetic axis . these angles are small enough , and we can see that they correspond to the aligned axes . the average observed age for our sample of stars is @ xmath53 ##0 . we must remember however that the values calculated using the ( * _ * ) _ * are the lower limits of this method . this is why the distribution of the observed values of @ xmath0 . from the table 1 . , [ = 453 ] . values of the angle @ xmath0 ( deg ) . [ n = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] , . the methods for determination of the angle @ xmath0 for rotation and translation , were used to calculate the values of @ xmath0 for 376 different sources . the distribution of these values shows the distribution of the values ofthe rotation axes . . . the inductions where the poles of 375 are known are unknown . there is only the first derivative @ xmath54 for the star j1713 - 3949 and it is excluded from the calculation . the shape of the calculated magnetic inductions can be expressed as the ratio with the maximal value of @ xmath55 and the value of the logarithmic scale nearly 1 . the calculated poles are smaller than the calculated magnetic inductions with the mean value of the sum of these values of 1 . for the star j1410 - 7404 @ xmath56 . the maximal value of the ratio @ xmath57 for the pulsar j2007 + 0809 . this work has been carried out with the financial support of the research program of the presidium of the russian academy of sciences * _ physical and dynamic problems in astrophysics _ * ( 2009 - 41 ) . we . a . a . biryukov for very useful comments and assistance .
