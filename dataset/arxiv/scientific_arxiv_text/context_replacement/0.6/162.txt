in recent years , studies of large - scale and surface effects on the magnetic properties of magnetic nanoparticles have created a new and exciting field for the interaction between theoretical works @ xcite and experiments @ xcite , as well as experimental works @ xcite . as the average size of the magnetic field increases to a certain size , surface effects become prominent in the field , therefore , many new and interesting magnetic properties can be observed , which can differ from those of typical works @ xcite . recent advances in the experimental field allow the researchers to study different types of magnetic nanoscaled materials @ xcite , and the properties of magnetic nanomaterials such as @ xmath3 - @ xmath4 nanoparticles have been extensively studied @ xcite . in addition , magnetic nanowires and materials such as @ xmath5 @ xcite , @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 @ xcite can be studied by various experimental methods and they have many applications @ works @ xcite . from the experimental point of view , many studies have been done on the magnetic properties of nanoparticles , such as nanowire , nano , and nanorod ##s , and many applications can beand the two other categories based on the combination of equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transition properties of such nanoscaled magnetic systems . specifically , in the latter category , the properties of these systems have been studied using a variety of methods such as magnetic field theory ( mft ) @ xcite , magnetic - field analysis ( amp ) @ xcite , wave functions analysis @ xcite , variational cumulant analysis ( vce ) @ xcite and monte carlo ( ms ) simulations @ xcite . based on these results , special attention has been paid to the electron correlation ( ec ) phenomenon in these single - crystal nanoparticles where the core shell experiences a bias below the nel value of the magnetic field due to the strong interaction between the atomic planes of the core and the shell . the article should return to @ xcite for a detailed discussion of the recent results . it is a well known fact that most properties of a magnetic material are derived from size ; however , beyond a certain size , nanoparticles can exhibit size - dependent properties , and many new phenomena have been discovered , such as superparamagnetism @ xcite , quantum effects ofthe density @ xcite , and the surface coercivities @ xcite . as an example , it has been theoretically demonstrated that @ xmath8 ( lcmn ) nanoparticle exhibits a strong shell - shell interaction , although the bulk lcmn is a ferromagnet @ xcite . also , as a further example , the relative interactions of the nanoscaled thin ising ##lass ##o with density @ xmath9 are determined by the process of using the method with si and mft , and it has been shown that the material will exhibit two compensation points with the same atomic thickness @ xcite . the existence of the compensation points observed in the nanoscaled thin films have also been observed for the ferrimagnetic materials @ xcite . however , the probability of the occurrence of such a point in the nanoscaled materials is quite different from those observed in the bulk ferrimagnetic materials . however , the compensation point occurs in the bulk , due to the high temperature dependence of the magnetic properties of the sublattices @ xcite . similarly , nanoscaled nano ##systems such as nanowires and polymers exhibit a compensation point , due to the presence ofand the electric fields between the core and the shell , especially if the interaction energies of the atomic core and shell are determined by the atomic structure . recently , the investigation of mechanisms of nanoparticle systems has opened a new field : the study of the equilibrium structure of nanoscaled particle systems @ xcite . according to the theoretical model @ xcite , it has been shown that the core - shell model can be successfully applied to equilibrium systems of nanoparticles made of more than one particle ( i . e . ferrimagnetic nanostructures ) since the structure is capable of explaining various characteristic properties observed in nanoparticle magnetism . however , we know from these studies that compensation behavior also depends on the particle type . therefore , nanoscaled particles such as nanowires , wires , etc . are being considered as suitable materials due to their potential use as ultra - high resolution imaging devices . on the other hand , a magnetic system experiences nonequilibrium phase space only in the presence of a uniform magnetic field . however , when a magnetic system is subjected to a space - time varying magnetic field , the system does not respond to the driving magnetic field , which causes thethis leads to the different time scales of the relaxation behavior of the system and the external magnetic field . for high temperatures and for the small amplitude of the external magnetic field , the system is able to stabilize the magnetic field with high accuracy . this is not the case for low temperatures and large magnetic field amplitudes . this spontaneous symmetry breaking implies the existence of a dynamic phase transition ( dpt ) @ xcite which manifested itself as the minimum relaxation period ( dop ) which is defined as the time evolution of the system over a wide range of the magnetic field . due to this nonequilibrium nature , in recent years , based on glauber theory of relaxation processes @ xcite , a few experimental studies have been devoted to the study of different aspects of phase transition behavior of the ising nanowire and other materials in the presence of a time - varying magnetic field at the interface with temperature @ xcite . in those studies , the researchers examined the time scales of the relaxation behavior , distribution of states and the relationship between time , temperature and magnetic field , and it has been shown that the relaxation processes can be classified into three different types , according to nel ##v of ferri##magnetism @ xcite . recently , based on experiment ##d and calculated using unixally based experiment ##sons , the mechanism of dynamic feedback in the core - shell - nanoparticle system has been studied by wang et al . @ xcite , in order to determine whether the positive feedback loops have the power - law scaling or not , and they found that the phase response of the magnetic field has only the spin - dependence and spin - correlation effects , and that they found that the restoring force of the core - shell loop has no effect on the power - law scaling of the positive feedback loop . as can be seen in the previously mentioned experiments mentioned above , the phase transition properties of nanoparticle systems have been more fully studied , whereas nonequilibrium physics requires more attention and the following questions need to be answered : ( i ) what is the influence of the amplitude and phase of the external magnetic field on the equilibrium phase transition properties ( i . e . temperature and equilibrium points ) of the nanoparticle system ? ( ii ) what kind of linear interactions exist between the magnetic fields ( equilibrium points and coercivity ) ofthe structure and the particle size ? the aim of the current paper is to try to understand the physical aspects of these questions . much attention has also been paid for the study of the nonequilibrium state where the magnetic field strengths are of the same order as ( or higher than ) the exchange interactions , and the ##s with number of time steps ( in terms of time steps per second ) . the best approximation of this situation can be easily achieved by using ultrafast magnetic spectroscopy @ xcite or by using a few different materials with high exchange interactions , in combination with high field strength . summary of the paper is as follows : in section [ results ] we first present our formulation . the details and conclusions are given in section [ results ] , and the section [ results ] gives our results . we model a single ferrimagnetic nanoparticle consisting of a spin - 1 / 2 - core which is surrounded by a spin - 4 - shell structure . inside the core , we model an exchange interaction between core and shell . ( see figure 1 , ref . ) of this type of interaction allows us to model a ferrimagnetic nano particle coming from more than one core . the modelis equivalent to a periodic applied magnetic field . the time evolution hamiltonian of our model of the field can be written as @ xmath10 where @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 represent the interactions between the core and shell sublattices . @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 represent the spin and the core and shell spin interactions , respectively . @ xmath16 represents the applied magnetic field , where @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 represent the amplitude and the angular momentum of the magnetic field , respectively . amplitude of the applied magnetic field is denoted by @ xmath19 . @ xmath20 represents the highest lattice point in the system . we set the amplitude of @ xmath15 to constant throughout the simulation , and we also used only the spin interaction with @ xmath15 . finally , amplitude of the applied magnetic field has remained constant to @ xmath21 throughout the simulation . in order to model the system , we apply @ x ##s and @ xcite to values ( [ eq1 ] ) of the @ xmath22cubic - dimensional lattice with positive boundary temperature ( fbc ) which is an appropriate choice for such a very large lattice . samples are generated by selecting the sites inside and outside the network and making random - coin - flip ##s , which are accepted or rejected according to the above rules , and @ xmath23 sites were selected at each time step ( each time step is defined as one mc ##ss per site or only one ) . the value @ xmath24 of the applied magnetic field is expressed in units of time in such a way that @ xmath25 where @ xmath26 is the number of mcss needed for a full measurement of the magnetic field and @ xmath27 is the time step . in our example , we get @ xmath28 , so we get @ xmath29 . this is done using @ xmath30 ##0 data sets , taking most of the time for @ xmath31 monte carlo calculations per sample and for the remaining @ xmath32 steps . this number of mc ##s is expected to be sufficient for thermalization for almost the entire range of the observed values . however , for all the observed measurements , in order to get tofor these states , the first order moments of the magnetic field are known in transient regime , and in this transient regime , an experiment has been performed ( see figure [ results2 ] ) . the states are calculated by using the statistical method @ xcite . our method gives the relative energies of the core and shell layer states @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 , and the total energy @ xmath35 over the time @ xmath36 . these values are expressed as @ xmath37 where @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 denote the number of particles in core and shell layers , respectively . from the energy distribution , we calculate the dynamic order parameters as follows @ xmath40 where @ xmath41 , @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 are the dynamic order parameters applied to the core and shell layers , and to the overall lattice ( @ xmath43 is used to calculate the time average kinetic energy over a full cycle of the overall lattice ) , respectively . we then calculate the time average of the kinetic energy of the particles in the core and shell layers over a full cycle of the overall lattice as follows @ xcite @xmath44dt . \ \ \ { { t } \ ] ] therefore , the critical temperature of the particle is defined as @ xmath45 where @ xmath46 is the temperature . to calculate the dynamic compensation point @ xmath0 from the dynamic compensation data , the compensation point of the absolute values of the dynamic core and shell temperatures is defined as @ xmath47 with @ xmath48 , where @ xmath49 is the critical temperature i . e . nel ##v . , ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) show that the values of the dynamic core and shell temperatures are equal , however , absolute values of them are equal to each other at the compensation point . therefore , in order to calculate the compensation point , we will need the critical temperature data related to core and shell temperatures of the system as follows : @ xmath50 in this section , we will focus our attention on the critical phase transition temperature of the ferrimagnetic nanoparticle system . this section is divided into two parts as follows : in section [ results1 ] , we have calculated the dependence of the critical temperature @ xmath49 of the system on the core andproperties of the applied magnetic field , as well as the decay rate are in question ( [ eq1 ] ) . in this section , we have also analyzed the conditions for the equilibrium of a single point @ xmath0 in the system . hysteretic response of the system to the two different magnetic fields has been analyzed in section [ results2 ] , and the properties of the two points have been analyzed in section [ results3 ] . in order to make a comparison with the previously mentioned sections where the equilibrium conditions of the whole system are considered , we calculate the number of lattice and lattice points for @ xmath51 and @ xmath52 ( the same number as for @ xcite where @ xmath53 is the first order of the system ) in sections [ results1 ] and [ results2 ] . plane for @ xmath54 with the same value of the magnetic field as @ xmath55 . the conditions are valid for three types of # ##s : ( a ) @ xmath56 , ( b ) @ xmath57 , and ( c ) @ xmath58 . , c = " figure : " , p = 302 ] plane for @ xmat##h54 with some selected values of the external field amplitude @ xmath55 . the values are given for three values of the amplitude : ( a ) @ xmath56 , ( b ) @ xmath57 , and ( c ) @ xmath58 . , height = " figure : " , width = 132 ] + in order to understand the effects of the interface coupling @ xmath2 between inner and outer layers on the overall phase transition amplitude of the system , we update the phase transition in the @ xmath59 model with two time series : @ xmath60 which represents ultra - fast movement of layers , and for some selected values of the field amplitude @ xmath61 : a [ fig1 ] a - [ fig1 ] b . finally , we consider a purely theoretical model , such as @ xmath54 for the nuclear force which drives the charge exchange process in the system . one of the important features of these diagrams is that the amplitude @ xmath49 , will increase as the amplitude of the external interface coupling @ xmath2 increases . this effect is different from coupling @ xmath61 and is@ xmath62 of the external magnetic field . for low - energy particles ( i . e . , very low energy ) , the phase @ xmath35 due to the high ferrimagnetic order , of the particle will respond to the external magnetic field with high frequency whereas as the amplitude of the external magnetic field is increasing , a delay occurs between the period @ xmath62 of the field and the relaxation time of the particle , and the dynamic phase does not respond to the external field due to the large phase difference between the field and the period @ xmath35 . as a result , this makes the initiation of the dynamic phase transition possible . in addition , for high @ xmath63 values , bulk and surface states of the particle are independent of each other . as the amplitude of the local magnetic field becomes larger , it becomes invariant against the external magnetic field , and the particle assumes a high ferrimagnetic order . therefore , a very large amount of internal energy is required to induce the dynamic phase transition of the particle , due to the coupling of the particle to the local magnetic field . as the amplitude of the spin transition isthus the strong exchange coupling @ xmath13 loses its effect against the surrounding environment , and it is possible to observe a dynamic phase transition at high temperatures . thus , ferrimagnetically , the curve of the phase diagram shown in figure [ fig1 ] a - [ fig1 ] b is aligned with the @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 curves . in figure [ fig2 ] a and [ fig2 ] b , we observe the effect of the strong exchange coupling @ xmath2 on the temperature dependence of the ##al ##bedo , similar to the phase diagram shown in figure [ fig1 ] a . as an additional example , we can see from figure [ fig2 ] that although the strong exchange coupling of the outer layers is much weaker than that of the shell layers ( i . e . @ xmath54 ) , both the core and shell layers undergo a dynamic phase transition at the same critical temperature which is the result of the same strong exchange coupling @ xmath13 . as shown in the phase diagram shown in figure [ fig2 ] b , most of the resulting nanoparticle surface will exhibit similar behavior as seen in the figure .##rrimagnetic theory . for the quantum state of nel @ xcite , it is possible to classify the physical properties of the individual spin states into a few categories . according to this classification , the system exhibits s - type , in which the system undergoes a temperature - dependent change with increasing temperature . at this point , we should conclude that this classification agrees with the aforementioned for @ xcite . in fact , in these studies the existence of at least one compensation point has been shown for each state of the system , i . e . for @ xmath64 . moreover , the total structure of the particle has been modified in such a way that the difference of the number of spins between the core and shell layers has been ignored in the experimental studies which only describe the system in theoretical terms . the system can be explained by the core and shell layers of the particle . these layers are shown in figure [ fig2 ] below . as shown in this figure , core ( with 1331 spins ) and shell ( with 2044 spins ) layers do not complement each other , so we could not find a compensation point for the system for any set of temperature conditions . therefore , we should conclude that in the absence of thermal interactionshowever ( such as @ xmath54 ) and at high enough temperatures the system does not exhibit these effects . , @ xmath65 , and @ xmath66 for the set of hamiltonian parameters corresponding to the system shown in figure [ fig1 ] . , title = " fig : " , width = 302 ] + on the temperature dependence of ( a ) total energy @ xmath43 , ( b ) dynamic order parameters @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 , and ( c ) dynamic heat capacity @ xmath67 for @ xmath68 , @ xmath54 , and @ xmath56 with @ xmath55 . , title = " fig : " , width = 302 ] on the temperature dependence of ( a ) total energy @ xmath43 , ( b ) dynamic order parameters @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 , and ( c ) dynamic heat capacity @ xmath67 for @ xmath68 , @ xmath54 , and @ xmath56 with @ xmath55 . , title = " fig : " , width = 151 ] + and , in figure [ fig3 ] ,we consider the effect of the increasing @ xmath61 of the magnetic field on the time evolution of the temperature @ xmath43 , the heat curves @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 , as well as the specific heat capacity curves of the system , corresponding to the phase diagrams shown in figure [ fig1 ] a . in figure [ fig3 ] b , the heat capacity of the entire system are shown . as shown in figure [ fig3 ] a , the curves exhibit p - type behavior , and @ xmath49 values increase with increasing @ xmath61 values . on the other hand , the heat capacity curves which are shown in figure [ fig3 ] b show a decrease at transition temperatures and a corresponding increase at the transition temperatures . schottky - type thermal effects observed in the heat capacity curves become stronger with increasing @ xmath61 which is the result of a corresponding increase in the total temperature . some of the dynamic specific heat curves corresponding to the non - specific heat curves can be briefly described in figure [ fig4 ] . however , when the phase diagrams exhibit a p - type behavior , dynamic specific heat curves exhibit a different ,and a sharp peak whereas if the model is p - type , with two temperature changes at @ xmath69 , the resulting heat curves show two different schottky - type surface features , and a single sharp peak . when the amplitude @ xmath61 of the external field is very small , only the first one observed at low temperatures appears , whereas the amplitude of the second one which is observed at high temperatures does not change , since it results from the local ##ization of the surface of the boundary layer which does not show any temperature change as the temperature is increased . , dynamic ##al ##bedo @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 , and dynamic ##ity @ xmath67 of the same for @ xmath54 , @ xmath70 , and @ xmath56 with ( a ) @ xmath68 and ( b ) @ xmath71 . , [ = " = : " , p = 302 ] + in the [ fig5 ] , we show the effect of the external field amplitude @ xmath62 on the local phase transition rate of the particle . phase transitions in this case are shown for a plot of the field amplitude @ xmath##72 with ultra high precision ( in comparison with that of mcss ) in which nonequilibrium states of the system have been observed with ultrahigh precision and ultra high temperatures . from figure [ fig5 ] b , we can clearly see that @ xmath49 levels are increasing with increasing @ xmath62 . the basic assumptions underlying the data shown in figure [ fig5 ] b are similar to those shown in figure [ fig2 ] . but we do not discuss these assumptions here . however , as a further example , let us consider the spin curves corresponding to the spin transitions shown in figure [ fig5 ] b . for example , as shown in figure [ fig5 ] b , when the magnetic spin transition mode is observed for @ xmath71 , the levels of @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 of the inner and outer electrons rapidly approach each other , which causes the appearance of n - type peaks in the spin spectrum . we have also performed experiments for the behavior of @ xmath68 , but we have not observed any significant changes in the shape of the peaks . however , based on the data shown in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , wenote that the presence of a nuclear exchange interaction ( such as @ xmath71 ) is not sufficient for the existence of these effects in the system . similarly for @ xmath54 , @ xmath70 , and @ xmath60 . ( 2 ) the effect of the value of @ xmath62 on the relative temperatures of the values of @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 of core and surface layers of the system for @ xmath71 , @ xmath73 , @ xmath70 , and @ xmath60 . , height = " [ : " , width = 302 ] + for a further discussion of this problem , we will consider the effect of the nuclear exchange interaction of the surface layer @ xmath1 on the physical properties of the system in figure [ fig6 ] . at first glance , referring to figure [ fig6 ] , we can easily see that as the value of @ xmath1 increases , the transition temperature of the system also increases . we will also see that the thermal transition temperature of the entire system is directly proportional to the value of @ xmath1 , since the temperature##ferromagnetic boundary temperature is a constant for @ xmath74 . however , for @ xmath75 , the temperature of the system shows p - type dependence , whereas for @ xmath76 , a critical temperature exists which varies with time @ xmath61 , and we have an p - type temperature at which the system is characterized by a critical point at which the temperature @ xmath43 goes to zero due to the partial cancelation of the field and the boundary interactions . these points are represented by numbers [ fig6 ] a and [ fig6 ] b , respectively . consider the energy states of @ xmath43 , @ xmath65 , and @ xmath66 , of the form for @ xmath74 , @ xmath56 , and @ xmath77 with ( a ) @ xmath75 , ( b ) @ xmath76 . , p = " [ : " , n = 302 ] + the phenomenon in most materials occurs in response to external magnetic fields , and it is one of the most important properties of all physical materials . in real systems , the phenomenon occurs as a result of dynamics . ##al .##g : stationary phase and the external magnetic field . in contrast to the patterns observed in equilibrium systems where the phase of the external field does not change with time interval , the behavior in nonequilibrium phase systems is characterized by a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the phase ##s of the external field . the shape of the feedback loop is determined by the coercivity and remanent ##ity of the magnetic field . in general , coercivity - which is defined as the minimum potential of the external magnetic field to bring the entropy of the system to zero - is an important physical property of many materials which plays a key role in scientific research . however , it is important to note that the majority of equilibrium models exhibit coercivity in the phase @ xcite whereas the phases in nonequilibrium systems driven by the external field are only observed in the phase ##al ##g . for the case of @ xmath61 with @ xmath68 , and ( a ) @ xmath54 , ( b ) @ xmath78 , etc . , shape = " [ : " , n = 302 ] + .internal and external field values ##s of the coercivity of the static and dynamic feedback systems are shown in figures [ fig7 ] - [ fig9 ] which have been obtained at the temperature @ xmath79 where @ xmath80 is the equilibrium temperature of the system in the absence of the external field . this lowering of the temperature causes the system to undergo a quantum mechanical phase transition ( i . e . a stable phase transition ) . in order to reach a stable state , the first 100 states of the external field have been measured and the coupling is available for all states . , for all states of coupling ##s @ xmath62 with @ xmath68 , @ xmath54 , and @ xmath70 . the numbers in the figure represent the value of @ xmath62 . , height = " [ : " , width = 302 ] + from figure [ fig7 ] . , for a small system with ##s such as @ xmath54 , coercivity values exhibit periodic changes with large @ xmath62 whereas for a large @ xmath62 they exhibit a steady state . however , it is clear from figure [ fig7 ] thatthat is , decay rate , the same as for all magnetic fields , but for high @ xmath62 values , coercivity is different from @ xmath61 . also , according to figure [ fig7 ] , , as the strength of the coupling in @ xmath1 between the core spins increases , coercivity will decrease to 0 for high @ xmath62 and for relatively low @ xmath61 values . the general shape of the magnetic field is obtained from the time evolution of the field @ xmath35 according to figure [ fig7 ] ( where there is a relatively large phase gap known as @ xmath68 between core and interface spins ) is shown in figure [ fig8 ] for the corresponding values of the field @ xmath62 with @ xmath70 . from figure [ fig8 ] , we see that remanent ##ivity values of the loops do not change for @ xmath62 values . on the other hand , shape of the field becomes fixed and does not change for high @ xmath62 , which is also true for the two core spins, such as @ xmath78 . where @ xmath78 , and @ xmath70 . evidence of magnetic interface coupling is shown in ( a ) for @ xmath68 , and in ( b ) for @ xmath71 . , [ = " article : " , p = 302 ] + in the next section , let us consider the effect of strong @ xmath2 coupling which could not be predicted from the results shown in figure [ fig7 ] . in both figure [ fig9 ] a and [ fig9 ] b we note that for relatively strong magnetic interface coupling such as @ xmath71 the system does exhibit an unusual behavior . however , as shown in figure [ fig9 ] b , the system exhibits triple loops , with an extremely narrow middle loop for relatively weak @ xmath2 coupling . the peak of the middle loop is smaller as the peak of @ xmath62 coupling . we note that evidence of triple loop behavior is possible for relatively high - energy coupling . but again , we have not observed this type of behavior in the system . the symbol @ .##math81 with the formula shown in figure [ fig9 ] a . all of this information can be determined by observing the time evolution of the system . according to our current model , closed - loop ##ing results from the presence of a strong - interface coupling @ xmath1 , as well as a weak - interface magnetic coupling @ xmath2 . these interactions exist for @ xmath82 . similar to figure [ fig9 ] a where we have a weak interface coupling @ xmath83 ; in strong interactions , such as for @ xmath84 , the core and shell layers can be aligned along the same axis . when the field strength increases to the strongest @ xmath70 in a single second , both core and shell layers can maintain their alignment with the external magnetic field . on the other hand , when @ xmath71 ( in figure [ fig9 ] b ) , the layers can align with the external field almost perfectly , the core layer has to align antiferromagnetically , due to the presence of a weak @ xmath13 interaction and weak - interface coupling @xmath85 . this results in a long time delay between the formation of the inner and outer layers , and thus we have no triple loops . these types of triple loops have also been observed successfully in the ising nanowire ##s @ xcite , and in non - magnetic materials @ xcite in the presence of strong magnetic fields . however , triple - loops observed in the total system may be unphysical , since the magnetic field of @ xmath2 is usually assumed to be in the region of @ xmath86 in the high temperature region @ xcite . with some selected values of temperature . the system parameters have been kept fixed as @ xmath87 , @ xmath54 , @ xmath56 , and @ xmath88 . the power levels of the total system @ xmath35 have been fixed for example as @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 [ ( b ) and ( c ) , etc . , height = " 1 : " , width = 283 ] with some selected values of temperature . the system parameters have been kept fixed as @ xmath87 , @ xmath54 ,@ xmath56 , and @ xmath88 . corresponding stability curves of the total energy @ xmath35 have been shown for temperature values @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . , [ = " ] : " , [ = 306 ] + as a first step , let us show the temperature dependent properties of the system for the temperature values of hamiltonian and electric field respectively . in figure [ fig10 ] , we show the dependence of the total energy @ xmath91 on the coercivity and stability curves corresponding to the excited states @ xmath92 . it is evident from figure [ fig10 ] , that as the temperature increases the coercivity of the system increases and decreases at a constant rate which depends on the temperature . however , the state corresponding to @ xmath93 ( in the spectrum ) has an unusual property . namely , coercivity of the system loses its linear relationship with frequency @ xmath91 when @ xmath93 which can be seen as a result of a spontaneous phase transition . corresponding stability curves have been shown in figure [ fig10] . and [ fig10 ] c for @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 , respectively . as seen from figure [ fig10 ] c , it eventually loses its spin and the particle undergoes a rapid phase transition from ordered to a more ordered state with increasing @ xmath91 values . this phase transition probably results from the rotation of the shell structure of the particle , since the shell of it itself does not change its spin as @ xmath91 increases . on the other hand , according to figure [ fig10 ] c , for @ xmath94 the particle still remains in the ordered state as @ xmath91 decreases , since the spin is high enough to keep the particle in a more ordered state . we can also see from figure [ fig10 ] c that remanent spin values , and loop areas become smaller with increasing @ xmath91 , and for a very small value of @ xmath91 , the loop areas are very different from the @ xmath91 value . we have also seen the expression for the spin of @ xmath95 from figure [ fig11 ] . .at frequency values , the mass of the particle is able to overcome the external magnetic field strength , albeit with a time delay . effects of coercivity on the particle of @ xmath91 for @ xmath96 can be seen in figure [ fig11 ] a . by comparing figures [ fig10 ] a and [ fig11 ] b , we can also see that the particle has higher coercivities for higher frequency values . the curves corresponding to figure [ fig11 ] a are shown in figures [ fig11 ] b and [ fig11 ] c for the @ xmath93 and @ xmath97 , respectively . the most significant difference between these values is that the phase difference between the mass of the particle and the external magnetic field strength increases , the coercivity and remanent ##ivity both become equal in low frequency and high frequency values , and the particle sizes decrease to zero . with carefully chosen values of c . the temperature values had been initially specified as @ xmath87 , @ xmath54 , @ xmath96 , and @ xmath88 . the temperature function of the initial temperature @ x##math35 has been depicted for temperature values @ xmath89 and @ xmath98 in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . , title = " fig : " , width = 283 ] with some selected values of parameters . the temperature parameters have been kept fixed on @ xmath87 , @ xmath54 , @ xmath96 , and @ xmath88 . the temperature values of the internal shell @ xmath35 have been depicted for temperature values @ xmath89 and @ xmath98 in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . , title = " fig : " , width = 313 ] + 2 figures [ fig12 ] a - [ fig12 ] b , in order to show the properties of the internal shell of the @ xmath91 , @ xmath0 and @ xmath49 shells , we show the temperature values of the temperature value of the shell for some selected values of @ xmath91 . figures [ fig12 ] a and [ fig12 ] b are the corresponding s - wave values with some selected values of hamiltonian parameters and properties for the shell ,and very close to higher temperatures such as @ xmath99 and @ xmath100 , respectively . it is clear from figures [ fig12 ] a and [ fig12 ] b that although the material has a ferrimagnetic structure , we do not observe any compensation points . however , it can be clearly seen from figures [ fig12 ] a and [ fig12 ] b that the spin exchange properties of the total spin curves become distorted with increasing @ xmath91 , so the spin curves maintain their shape even if the shell size increases and the curves go to the right with increasing @ xmath91 temperature . on the other hand , when the spin exchange property is significantly reduced , such as @ xmath76 as shown in fig . [ fig12 ] b , the total spin curves exhibit n - type behavior with no compensation point for increasing shell size . if the shell size increases , then the total spin curves undergo a phase transition from n - type behavior to the n - type properties where we observe a slight change in the shape with increasing temperature . some of the observed @ xmath43 come with a number of different parameters .

state properties of a single crystal ferrimagnetic nanoparticle which is composed of a solid particle surrounded by a thin crystal structure . by studying the external field interaction at the crystal interface we have also studied some of the ferrimagnetic properties of the system . the most important results reported in the previous paper can be briefly summarized as follows : * in paper [ results1 ] , a complete description of the phase transition and its effects has been presented . we have found that in the presence of surface exchange enhancement ( such as @ xmath54 ) and at high enough temperatures the system does not exhibit compensation point . furthermore , we have found that the presence of an surface exchange enhancement ( such as @ xmath71 ) is not sufficient for the occurrence of compensation points in the system . @ xmath1 parameter is the necessary parameter for the existence of the compensation point . in other words , there exists a certain @ xmath1 parameter for which the system does not exhibit compensation point . compensation points have been found to increase the surface exchange enhancement ##s . due to the##l ##1 , the spin states of the particle are assumed to satisfy l - type , s - type and m - type selection rules under certain conditions . the theoretical description of the particle , and the observed behavior @ xmath43 of the particle is done in such a way that the numbers of spins in the core and shell states of the particle are considered . in this regard , the results published in the paper should be interpreted carefully , since the number of spins in the core and shell are usually not equal in the core - shell nanoparticle system . * * [ results2 ] has been applied to investigation of hysteretic behavior of the particle . based on the experimental data , we have reported the observation of a triple loop , which results from the interaction of a strong magnetic coupling strength @ xmath1 , as well as a weak magnetic core coupling strength @ xmath2 . triple - loops occur after the interaction @ xmath102 . however , we note that triple - loops observed in the simulation data may be unphysical , since the core coupling strength @ xmath2 is not known to be in the range of @ .##math86 in the quantum theory section @ xcite * time the properties of the particle have been studied in the [ results3 ] and we found that the particle can undergo a rapid phase transition from ordered to a highly ordered state with increasing the shell thickness @ xmath91 when the scattering frequency is very high which is an almost nonequilibrium state in the case of ultrafast scattering . we have also found that as the shell thickness increases , all the observed spin particles undergo a phase transition from s - type particles to the n - types , and the phase defects disappear with time @ xmath91 . all of the experiments described above show that the components ( amplitude and phase ) of the electric field and particle size have an important effect on the thermal and electronic properties , such as coercivity , remanence and the shape of the particle . in particular , we found that compared to our previous work , we have not found any examples of the higher order phase transitions . the difference is most likely due to the fact that , in contrast to the previous techniques such as mft and ms , the technique we use in the previous paper only takes into account the thermal properties in the particle .which allows us to obtain non - linear equations . however , it is possible to use the dynamic properties to model more complex systems by using a simulation of the theory of hamiltonian with an assembly of molecular nanoparticles instead of a single molecule . this will be the subject of some further research . on the other hand , we should also note that the classical mc model of complex systems is incapable of describing the time domain properties , such as dynamic properties , in terms of an infinite timescale . therefore , in order to extend the mc model to a given time domain , a new experimental model has been made of the mc model , the cohen - lifshitz - stein ( llg ) _ @ xcite . the method which was used for the first time in nowak _ @ xcite is also based on the use of a time domain technique which relates the time step to the time step in the llg equation . this method is also expected to be useful for modeling infinite - dimensional molecular systems where the time step is usually of the order of several _ @ xcite . however , it could also be useful to solve the problem described in this article in the framework of a time - domain monte carlo .. the authors ( s . y . and y . y . ) would like to ask the scientific and technological research council of turkey ( tbitak ) for their financial support . this work has been performed at dokuz eyll university , the school of engineering and applied sciences , and the numerical simulations described in this paper were performed at tbitak ulakbim , high performance and parallel computing infrastructure ( tr - grid ##s - infrastructure ) . _ kodama r h 1999 _ j . magn . mater . _ * 36 * 359 and references in kim ##ura t , yamazaki t and hirano s 2004 _ phys . _ _ _ _ * 241 * 1601 pankhurst m h , connoly s , smith t , and smith s 2003 _ j . phys . * 241 * r167 and references in rivas b , boobre -
