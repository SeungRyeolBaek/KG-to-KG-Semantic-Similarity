in our illustration , we start with an initial comparison of the qds and show the significantly lower spectral linewidth of the emitted photon from a resonantly - neutral qd compared with other emission methods obtained via below - bandgap and above - band gap cw lasers . example @ xmath3s2 ( 2 - 3 ) shows a detailed comparison of the spectral linewidth of the emitted photon from a neutral qd ( qd2 ) and exciton for various cw - laser emission methods . at low power levels ( < 32 ) , the cw photoluminescence spectra obtained from both band - gap and _ _ _ - shell lasers yield a linewidth of @ xmath52 . 5ghz ( see fig . @ xmath3s2a ) and @ xmath51 . 5ghz ( fig . @ xmath3s2b ) , respectively . on the other hand , cw - lasers ( see fig . @ xmath3s2c ) yield a much higher linewidth of @ xmath50 . 48ghz , at a power level well above 32 ( see @ xmat##h46 ) where the mollow effect dominates @ xcite . the @ xmath3s2d shows a range of cw rf spectra with different laser energies . the spectrum of @ xmath47 and ( using the formula eqn . ( 2 ) from fig . @ xcite ) from the cw rf spectrum of @ xmath46 is due to be radiative - coupled : @ xmath47 / @ xmath48 = 0 . 390 ( 6 ) , where @ xmath49 is the exciton time which is estimated here to be of 390 ( 6 ) seconds for time - resolved cw lasers . this is consistent with the fact that the w _ _ _ - based cw laser methods exploit dephasings associated with the cw laser at @ xcite . the high - resolution cw rf spectrum from qd2 is shown in fig . @ xmath3s3 . for the range of laser energies from 0 . 93 @ xmath0 to @ xmath0 ##2 , we compare the rf profile with the voigt profile to find the maximum ( maximum ) linewidth ( @ xmath##50 ) . as shown in the figure of fig . @ xmath3s3 , the @ xmath50 shows an increase of the peak values , which is in good agreement with the observation of radiation - induced thermal expansion @ xcite . the @ xmath3s4a - b is the result of the experiment performed by qd2 . one of the clusters appears , with decay times of @ xmath1112 . 5 seconds . the central cluster has an even higher photon number compared to the other , due to the single - photon nature of the experiment . the hom value is measured with @ xmath0 , 0 . 75 @ xmath0 and 0 . 79 @ xmath0 respectively , where the peak values are @ xmath6 @ xmath51 , @ xmath6 @ xmath52 and @ xmath6 @ xmath53 energy levels , and the am values of 0 . 903 ( 34 ) , 0 . 912 ( 35 ) and 0 . 934 ( 35 ) , respectively ( see fig . @ xmath34 ( c - d ) ) . taking into account of the datatwo - body collision . for this qd , @ xmath54 , and the impulse response of our interferometric system ( same as in the above equation ) , we have the values of this to be 0 . 956 ( 56 ) , 0 . 966 ( 59 ) , 0 . 989 ( 99 ) for the @ xmath0 , 0 . 38 @ xmath0 and 0 . 39 @ xmath0 states , respectively .
