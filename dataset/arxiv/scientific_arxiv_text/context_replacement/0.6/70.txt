x - ray observations of " normal " galaxies , with high - energy emission lines , produced by the large active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , have now been extended to cosmologically significant sources in the near infrared ( cdf ) spectrum , which have now undergone 2000 years of observation ( cdf - n : hornschemeier et al . 2001 , in paper ii ; brown et al . 2001b , in paper i ; cdf - m : tozzi et al . 2001 ; m . rosati et al . , in prep . ) . galaxies with @ xmath8 are found in all wavelengths above 0 . 52 kev and with @ xmath9 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 ( e . g . , paper i ) ; the cdf - n survey is about two orders of magnitude closer , with large numbers of normal galaxies among the hundreds of x - ray sources in the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ; paper ii ; r . j . barger et al . , in prep . ) . these normal galaxies have as much as 510 % of the xrb emission in the 0 . 52 kev range . the bulk of the stellar emissionof the xrb is currently dominated by agn , but the structure of the 12 " galaxy , whether its x - ray emission is caused by a mixture of x - ray emission , a molecular gas , or simply a low - energy agn , is an increasingly important part of the x - ray survey . these galaxies are expected to be the most abundant of x - ray sources in the universe and are expected to match the abundance of the 0 . 1 kev sources of @ xmath10 @ xmath11 , @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 ( ptak et al . 2001 ) . the cdf - 1 has achieved the resolution necessary to map the " [ [ @ xmath12 ; @ xmath13 , from 0 . 1 kev ] @ xmath14 ] to @ xmath15 , corresponding to a look - back time of @ xmath16 gyr ( @ xmath17 ##m , @ xmath7 mpc @ xmath7 , @ xmath18 , and @ xmath19 are used in this survey ) . the longer look - back times provide the greater possibility of matching the same x - ray source tothe observed star - formation rate is @ xmath203 ( e . g . , madau et al . 1996 ) . one often expects the x - ray emission per unit @ xmath2 - 1 energy to be higher than @ xmath211 in the future due to the high energy density of x - ray star formation at @ xmath203 ; this x - ray " represents a new ##ization " of the rates of star formation ( e . g . , ghosh & singh 2001 ; ptak et al . ) , estimates of the x - ray emission of individual galaxies can inform models of x - ray star formation in stars . although x - ray emission from individual galaxies is not usually measured at @ xmath22 , it is possible to estimate the rate from their relatively high # ##es using statistical methods such as averaging , a technique based largely on the cdf - based ##d obtained from several previous studies . these include the detection of x - ray emission from the nearby @ xmath21 ##1 ( @ xmath23 ) galaxy and the nearby magnetic ##o - 1 ( ) galaxy by brown et al . ( 2001a , see section below ) and theanalysis of x - ray emission from @ xmath244 lyman alpha was published in the ( cohen et al . 2001c , see paper v ) . encouraged by the results of these studies , we expanded beyond the range of known galaxies to the galactic x - 1 region , now focusing on galaxies in @ xmath25 to continue the study of @ xmath26 ##4 and in paper v . we focus on this broad region due to the excellent galaxy data available ( cohen et al . 2000 and references below ) and high resolution which has enabled a comprehensive galaxy structure study ( van den bergh , cohen , & crabbe 2001 ) . the cdf - n data has a good x - 1 limit in this region ( see section 2 of paper vi for the # ##s of this section ) ; the single - source emission lines for this region of the cdf - n data in the 2 . 5 kev and 3 kev range are @ xmath27 s @ xmath6 , @ xmath7 and @ xmath28 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 , respectively . in this region , we have no constraints on the size of the distribution ofx - ray emission to @ xmath2 - 3 " of 12 " spiral galaxies corresponds to @ xmath29 ; this value is an indication of the current state of star formation in the galaxy ( e . g . , davis , cohen , & forman 1992 ; davis et al . we also have data on the amount of the total xrb produced by galaxies , well below the cdf - 1 - limit , and on the contribution to the xrb of individual galaxies . the estimates for the region are derived from the data of cohen et al . ( 2000 ) , cohen ( 2001 ) , and davis et al . ( 2001 ) for the range @ xmath30 . accurate distance determination is difficult in the range @ xmath31 due to the lack of unusual features in the free - space infrared spectrum and the lack of the lyman alpha signal used to detect high mass galaxies . we have also used the large elliptical galaxies catalog of fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil ( 1999 ) for the spectral range @ xmath32 , which has little overlap in free space with the other .for cross - section . the radio catalog cover the entire hdf - n and a small portion of the galactic core region , whereas the optical catalog only covers the hdf - n . we shall refer to these sources " as the " source " and the " catalog " as the rest of this catalog . for the optical sample , the @ xmath33 - based technique is used to measure the galaxies ' ir spectrum , but this is also applied to in - group @ xmath2 for most of the wavelength range under consideration here . the @ xmath33 values are those used by barger et al . ( 1999 ) for the in group galaxy sample . for the optical sample , the f814w ( and @ xmath34 ) values of fernndez - soto et al . ( 1999 ) were used . we found galaxies which had their x - ray intensity at three times the 0 . 50 kev ( hard ) , 0 . 60 kev ( soft ) and 50 kev ( soft ) , corresponding to the wavdetect ( smith et al . 2002 ) magnitude threshold of @ xmath35 and the @ acis spectral threshold ofpaper iv . this lower detection limit means that our data does not include galaxies with x - ray emission far below the lower detection limit of paper iii . we have attempted to collect a catalog of galaxies similar to the ones in the local group . to accomplish this , we have used the morphological classes of van den bergh et al . ( 2001 ) for filtering from @ xmath36 to the hdf - 1 and the nearby galaxies . to accomplish the same goal , we have grouped galaxies in the van den bergh et al . ( 2001 ) catalog into the following morphological classes : ( 1 ) " / s0 " and " " , ( 2 ) sc " , ( 3 ) and " sc " , " non - regular and irregular / irregular , and ( 4 ) irr " , and " and / or " " . we have refined the data to include morphological classes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . sampling the morphological data is very difficult due to the size of many of the galaxies and also due to brightness changes with time . we have used the standard energy distribution ( sed ) classes of fernndez - soto et al . ( 2001 ) to sample " galaxies of type ii " . some of the morphological andnote that , in the galaxies studied by sa , @ xmath37 90 % of galaxies studied by the two methods are fairly similar . since the relationship of x - ray properties with galaxies is of interest , we have made an effort to find galaxies with different optical properties at different wavelengths . this is especially important due to the non - linear relationship between x - ray properties and @ xmath2 - band values for certain types of elliptical galaxies ( @ xmath38 ; e . g . fabbiano & wilson 2001 ) . using the value of @ xmath39 in the @ xmath40 - band as calculated by blanton et al . ( 2001 ) for a large number of galaxies in the sloan all sky survey , we found the value of @ xmath39 in the @ xmath2 - band . the sloan value @ xmath40 is closely fit to @ xmath2 ; the corresponding value of @ xmath39 in the @ xmath2 band is @ xmath41 . to ensure that our results are not directly dependent upon the actual sed used to measure the optical properties , we have used both the sa andusing the seds of poggianti et al . ( 1997 ) to compare @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 vs . @ xmath42 for each @ xmath39 galaxy using the large aperture technique synphot ##ron iraf . these results are shown in figure [ 1 _ 1 ] . note the linear relationship between the sa and sc tracks ; this is because the @ xmath33 track corresponds to in - line @ xmath2 in the limit of our dynamic range . also shown in figure 1 are the 151 galaxies in the sa sample with cluster or cluster status having @ xmath43 and the 651 galaxies in the sc sample with sed " higher than sc " having @ xmath44 . these tracks were estimated by statistical analysis to be within 0 . 5 % of the @ xmath39 galaxy as described above ; the result was found when sa and sc seds were identical ( or nearly identical ) for all galaxies up to @ xmath45 . galaxies in the high dynamic range were then separated by distance into two bin ; these distances were adjusted to ensure that there were @ xmath46 galaxies per bin . thenumber of galaxies , average size , median count - out , and average optical magnitude for each bin are listed in table 1 . in table 2 , we list all the galaxies in the sample sed bin with numbers in the average size range . table 2 also lists the number of galaxies rejected from each sample bin due to the presence of an x - ray source within it ; this matching radius ensures that our results will not be significantly affected by the presence of the majority of the strong x - ray sources . these galaxies met both the optical magnitude and the size range and were rejected only due to x - ray sources . this matching criterion is not useful , however , given that our result is close to @ xmath476 in the case under consideration ( see paper iii ) . to account for the non - gravitational nature of some of the x - ray sources found in these galaxies ( e . g . , paper iii ) , we consider them to be highly strong x - ray sources if the x - ray source is within 40 of the galaxy detection . this matching radius is very well fit to the chandra scale . off - center for 0 . 5 kev and the 10 % low - energy radius for 0 . 5 ke##v . ] we therefore can estimate the number of galaxies with an x - ray aperture of 15 in figure 2 . the x - ray detection ##s for each region were calculated in the same way as in paper vii , keeping the only galaxies whose sources were at an aperture of about 15 . the statistical significance of each region was determined by running 10 , 000 monte - carlo computer simulations of the same region as in paper vii . a galaxy is likely to be significantly detected if the number of clusters of sources exceeds that of 99 . 99 % of the sample . no particular galaxy in the sample itself appears to affect the detection , demonstrating the accuracy of our selection method . stacking of the galaxies in the sample as described in figure [ sample _ selection ] and figure [ sample _ definition ] resulted in significant detection in the same region for all of the frequency bands up to @ xmath48 ( see figure 1 ) . we also detected them in the same band @ xmath49 , but this was not a significant effect . the results for the three - individual - sed bands were nearly or completely identical except for the frequencies in the same frequency bin ( @ xmath50 ) . we used the @ xmat##h51 was used for the calculation of x - ray wavelengths and frequencies , assuming that these sources are similar to the galaxies from the early universe and have their x - ray spectra dominated by x - ray emission ( e . g . , kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1992 ) . although there were many examples of significant variations in the assumed spectrum , there were no other significant ones in the soft band . given the distribution of background noise and decay ##s with frequency , the signal - to - noise ratio for sources with the assumed spectrum is highest in the soft band and lowest in the hard band , and this result is expected . the flux level of the soft - band signal for the optical sample is ( 35 ) @ xmath52 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 . the corresponding non - stable 0 . 5 kev values for the observed signal are @ xmath53 ir s @ xmath7 for the lowest energy bin and @ xmath54 ir s @ xmath7 for the highest energy bin . for the optical sample , the hard - band flux level of the signal is ( 35 ) @xmath52 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 . we have calculated values for the most significant sources in the stack sample for those other sources with more favorable visible - light properties . we have calculated the number of the sources which are rejected from the stacking sample relative to an x - ray source at or near the location of the source ( the number of rejected sources is shown in the first section of table 1 ) . there are only 15 candidate sources with x - ray sources before us . of these 15 sources , 14 have broad - line agn , which are therefore not normal galaxies . one object has a new location which differs significantly from its original location . since the physical properties of this object at its present location place it outside our sample space , we have rejected it . one object is located near an x - ray source which has been positively identified with a broad - line agn . therefore , there are a total of " rejected " galaxies positively identified with x - ray sources in this sample , consituting a significant number of the sources under consideration here . the worst case is at the present position , where 90 % of the galaxies .x - ray observations . figure [ sbhistogram ] is a comparison of @ xmath55 values , for both the stacked bin and the individually x - ray detected galaxies . the individually x - ray detected galaxy population does not include the low - density agn , but the agn itself ( see figure ii and iii ) . with the comparison of the galaxies in the stacked bin with the @ xmath56 , figure [ sbhistogram ] shows that : the x - ray energies of the individually detected galaxies are on average much higher than those of the stacked bin ; they are so highly correlated as to be part of the total galaxy population . for the lowest density bin , it is clear that our estimates are very accurate to the values of the x - ray detected galaxies . figure 2 , we can also calculate values which include the individually x - ray detected galaxies in the overall distribution for this lowest density bin . for more information , we have compared the radio properties of the individually detected galaxies and the stacked bin in the papers of smith et al . ( 1998 ) and smith ( 2000 ) . the distribution of radio properties among the individually x - ray detected galaxies is approximatelythan that among the other samples ( @ xmath57 % vs . @ xmath585 % ) . this statistical difference between the two samples is estimated at the 95 % , as measured by the same sample size distribution for the different samples ( see siegel & castellan 1988 ) . due to the x - ray intensity ratio and the differences in optical emission , and to the fact that these samples are a small fraction of those under study , we are confident we have not exceeded our estimate of the mass of the target galaxy by excluding these x - ray type galaxies from our study . in figure [ lxlb ] b , we plotted the x - ray - to - gamma ray ratio @ xmath59 for each possible sample , where @ xmath13 is measured for the in - plane 1 . 5 kev band . we have also calculated our detection time limit in figure [ lxlb ] c , which is approximately the corresponding @ xmath60 x - ray - detection limit , for the 100 % detection period given by @ xmath61 . we do not expect to find galaxies with more x - ray emission per corresponding @ xmath2 - detection frequency than this limit .for comparison with the local universe , we will plot the average @ xmath59 for the galaxies of comparable @ xmath62 from the data of brown et al . this sample includes 234 spiral galaxies starting with _ ag _ and _ agn where the x - ray spectrum is more dominated by the latter . the galaxies in the brown et al . ( 2001 ) sample also are @ xmath63 ; their average is @ xmath64 . in figure [ lxlb ] b , we plot @ xmath59 versus @ xmath65 ; the values corresponding to @ xmath66 are consistent with what is observed in the brown et al . sample for galaxies with comparable @ xmath65 , although they are toward the lower end of what is observed . this is consistent with figure [ lxlb ] c , which shows the average @ xmath59 resulting from this is much higher than that for the brown et al . sample of comparable @ ##65 . there is a significant shift ( factor of 1 . 5 ) in the average @ xmath67 from the local universe to @ xmath68 . for the above values ,( @ xmath50 ) , the models become more inaccurate to the higher sed one uses for calculating the galaxy distance . we find that the older higher sed is more likely for this distance due to the greater rate of star formation . using this sed , we find that @ xmath69 has expanded much more than ( @ xmath70 ##0 ) and @ xmath50 . we can also construct star - formation models using only the x - ray spectra of these galaxies . the average x - ray intensity of the two galaxies in the smith et al . ( 2001 ) sample in the energy range of @ xmath65 as measured by this sample is @ xmath71 / 2 @ xmath7 ( close to 1 . 5 kev ) . the second galaxy in our sample sample has a value @ xmath72 times higher at @ xmath68 . this corresponds to @ xmath73 times higher than @ xmath74 . the @ xmath68 difference is most likely caused by gravitational factors leading to the existence of other spiral galaxies in the high energy range ( figure 1 ) . if we consider these galaxiesx - ray detected objects , and the first galaxy in our observed sample has a mass @ xmath75 times higher than @ xmath68 , consistent with the prediction of ghosh & white ( 2001 ) that the x - ray intensity of the nearby super - sbc dwarf galaxy should be @ xmath75 times higher than @ xmath76 . counting the x - ray detected objects does not significantly affect our prediction for the galaxy @ xmath77 ( the average is @ xmath78 % ) . however , since the x - ray intensity of the x - ray detected objects with @ xmath74 are much higher ( by an order of magnitude ) than the x - ray observed sample ( see figure 2 ) , it is not necessary to count these objects in the calculation of the observed x - ray intensity . we also observe a significant increase in the average x - ray intensity of objects with @ xmath79 than the average by a factor of @ xmath80 predicted by ghosh & white ( 2001 ) . we conclude that the average x - ray intensity of galaxies have not increased significantly by more than a factor of@ xmath73 s @ xmath74 , regardless of location or inclusion of x - ray source sources . the value of the 0 . 52 kev flux for the spiral galaxies shown here is ( @ xmath46 @ xmath5 ) @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 . these x - ray sources are consistent with the predictions made by ptak et al . ( 2001 ) that sources of this type will be detected at 0 . 52 kev flux levels of @ xmath81 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 ( going from their 210 kev range to an @ xmath82 power range ) . at a 0 . 52 kev xrb flux level of @ xmath83 s @ xmath6 s @ xmath7 deg @ xmath84 ( garmire et al . 2001 ) , we have detected @ xmath85 % of the known xrb sources coming from spiral galaxies not yet being observed from outer space . all of these sources should be sufficently able to be detected with acis energies of @ xmath86 % , which should be .for the last two years of the project . we thank alice johnson for our support and shared experiences . we also appreciate the continued support of nasa grant grant ##t - 38252 ( gpg , doe ) , nasa gsrp grant ngt5 - 50247 ( aeh ) , nasa grant grant ast - 9983783 ( wnb , dma , doe ) , and nasa grant ast99 - 00703 ( doe ) . this project would not have been possible without the combined efforts of the nasa agencies . ccccccc + 0 . 501 . 00 & sc & 0 . 635 & 0 . 75 & 8 . 05 & 37 & 9 / 4 + 0 . 750 . 00 & sc & 0 . 821 & 0 . 83 & 0 . 95 & sc & 1 / 2 + 0 . 901 . 00 & sc & 0 . 960 & 8 . 05 & 8 . 05 & 37 & 9 / 4 + + + 0 . 501 . 00 & sc & 0 . 920 & 0 . 96 & 8 . 05 & 37 & 9 / 4 + 0 . 001 . 00 & sc & 0 . 00 & 0 . 95 & 8 . 05 & sc & 1 / 2+ 0 . 001 . 00 & sc & 1 . 240 & 2 . 09 & 2 . 12 & sc & 1 / 2 + rrrrrrrrrcrrc + 0 . 750 . 00 & sc & 0 . 5 & 50 . 0 & 0 . 0 & @ xmath87 & 1 . 47 & 1 . 45 & 1 . 55 & 1 . 55 & 0 . 75 & 1 . 45 & 0 . 5 + 0 . 750 . 00 & sc & 0 . 5 & 0 . 0 & @ xmath87 & @ xmath87 & 33 . 05 & 2 . 09 & 1 . 12 & 1 . 95 & 2 . 05 & 2 . 07 & 2 . 12 + 0 . 901 . 00 & sc & 0 . 0 & 0 . 0 & @ xmath87 & @ xmath87 & 1 . 00 & 1 . 55 & 1 . 47 & 1 . 51 & 1 . 54 & 1 . 55 & 0 . 5 + + + 0 . 501 . 00 & sc & 0 . 5 & 0 . 75 & 0 . 0 & @ xmath87 & 2 . 05 & 2 . 06 & 1 . 55 & 1 . 47 & 1 . 51 &0 . 1 & 0 . 0 + 1 . 001 . 50 & sc & 0 . 5 & 0 . 8 & 0 . 9 & @ xmath87 & 0 . 9 & 0 . 8 & 0 . 7 & 5 . 5 & 0 . 5 & 0 . 06 & 0 . 5 + 1 . 001 . 50 & sc & 38 . 5 & 0 . 5 & 0 . 5 & 0 . 6 & 0 . 7 & 0 . 8 & 0 . 9 & 0 . 56 & 0 . 5 & 0 . 5 & 0 . 5 + . the blue curves give @ xmath33 vs . @ xmath42 for @ xmath39 , and , respectively ( the same values with higher distance ##s for the same radius ) . galaxies without a great circle were not included in the above list because they either were not within the range of the radius , or because their x - ray emission was not within it .
