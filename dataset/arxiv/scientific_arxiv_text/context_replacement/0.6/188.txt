coupling of complex systems is a theoretical phenomenon , which has attracted a lot of attention , see e . g . @ xcite . even though the exact mechanism and the details of the coupling process are well known and very well understood , a more rigorous explanation is still needed . strictly speaking , the basic idea lies in the fact that the coupling describes the behavior of non - equilibrium complex systems , usually composed of many sub - systems , whose space - time behavior depends only on the computation of the ` ` ' ' ' lyapunov numbers , i . e . of those numbers that are zero in the presence of zero interactions , and are therefore non - zero in the absence of interactions among the sub - systems . the precise computation of these numbers is therefore very difficult . precision of their computation is a necessary first step for the development of the srb model of networks and networks of random variables , which may serve as toy models for complex complex systems out - of - phase ( i . e . they may serve as toy models for non - equilibrium steady state or non - equilibrium quantum systems ) . in the original article @ xcite , we give a standard model for phase transitions in theone - dimensional model consists of the suspension flow of arnold s cat , together with the clock . the coupling in @ xcite was simple , in the sense that it did not involve the suspension flow , but rather the clock itself . despite its simplicity , the coupling has a non - trivial property : in particular , it preserves dimension , and in @ xcite we compute the whole complex invariant manifold via a linear expansion . however , because of unidirectionality , the lyapunov spectrum of @ xcite is not simple : the ` ` x ' ' coordinates ( i . e . , those corresponding to the points on the invariant manifold ) coincide with the positive integers , and the constant term is expressed in the form of a definite value of the function on the manifold . in this way , we extend the theory of @ xcite to a complex linear model , for which the lyapunov spectrum is non - trivial , and we show how to express it in terms of a linear expansion , which takes the form of the linear taylor series described in detail in the paper . the expansion is expressed as follows . take arnold s cat = @ xmath0 and denote by @ xmat##h1 and @ xmath2 the coefficients and eigenvectors , respectively , of @ xmath3 : @ xmath4 with @ xmath5 , so that @ xmath6 is stable . we let the average value of # ##ian ##1 is defined as @ xmath7 , with @ xmath8 , if @ xmath9 @ xmath10 . therefore , @ xmath11 is the solution to the original flow equation instead of , but in the proof we have used the fact that at all times @ xmath12 the solution @ xmath13 changes randomly from @ xmath14 to @ xmath15 , and with these changes the solution is unstable . therefore , all the statements and statements of @ xcite are true , modulo this re - evaluation of the flow equation ( * ? ? ? * ( 1 . 1 ) ) , where @ xmath16 should be replaced by @ xmath17 . ] and @ xmath18 : s = ( s ) ( t ) . , [ 1 . susf ] where @ xmath19 is the @ xmath20 - 1 ##ity function such that @ .##math21 for example @ xmath22 . the equation of evolution is obtained by replacing the periodic phase of the x - system with a flow with a periodic phase , so that for @ xmath23 the evolution equation is @ xmath24x + \ varepsilon f ( x , w , t ) , & \ \ \ dot { cases } = x + \ varepsilon f ( x , w , t ) , \ dot { cases } \ ] ] where @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 , @ xmath27 and @ xmath20 - are in their phases . for @ xmath28 the phases of @ xmath13 and @ xmath29 are different . therefore , the interaction of @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 among the two flows is different . if @ xmath31 and if the interaction is dissipative ( in the special case , to be found in the literature ) , then the phases of the two x - flows will differ , so that the actual evolution in the near future takes place in an orbit of radius greater than 1 , for the same conditions as the nearest neighborood of the system . .@ xcite , we have obtained such an invariant in terms of a certain power series expansion of @ xmath32 , for @ xmath33 and a certain set of dissipative solutions @ xmath27 . in this way , we extend the definition of @ xcite to @ xmath34 . our main problem is the determination of the flow of ##s for @ xmath34 . [ 1 : 1 ] let @ xmath35 be the flow of @ xmath36 , with the equation , with @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 polynomials in their coefficients . take @ xmath37 and then there exist @ xmath38 such that @ xmath39 and @ xmath40 , derivatives of @ xmath41 . then there exist solutions @ xmath42 such that for @ xmath43 there exists a homemorphism @ xmath44 and a smooth function @ xmath45 , the hlder - sum of solutions @ xmath46 , such that the flow @ xmath47 is invariant under the poincar flow @ xmath48 and the flow of @ xmath48 and @ xmath49 .similarly to that of @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 , i . e . @ xmath52 the proof of this theorem is straightforward : it gives an efficient method for computing the sum ##ity of the power series of @ xmath53 with respect to @ xmath32 , it shows how to compute , and how to prove convergence of the series . as a cross - section , we show that the invariant measure is holomorphic on @ xmath32 for a small neighborhood of the complex plane , whose boundary is the origin . the theorem also shows that @ xmath54 is an integer . we denote by @ xmath55 the neighbourhood of , and by @ xmath56 the local nearest neighborood of @ xmath54 , with @ xmath55 such that @ xmath57 , with @ xmath58 the lesbegue measure of @ xmath59 . in addition to the definition of the smooth manifold , in this section we show how to define the invariant measure of the domain and the lyapunov measure , in terms of series measures . more precisely , let @ xmath60 be the lesbegue measure corresponding to @xmath56 , a . e . , defined by @ xmath61 the limiting measure of @ xmath56 , @ xmath62 , for all functions @ xmath63 . the ` ` ' ' ' limiting function on the sphere , @ xmath64 , is defined by @ xmath65 for any two functions @ xmath66 and @ xmath60 - a . e . @ xmath67 , where @ xmath68 . the limiting measure @ xmath64 is defined by @ xmath54 and such that @ xmath69 . on the sphere , @ xmath64 - a . e . , is a linear system , i . e . a subset of the complex plane , @ xmath70 , such that @ xmath71 the equations of f @ xmath72 are the lyapunov integral , and we call them , and @ xmath73 ; for the latter we shall call @ xmath74 the _ n _ lyapunov integral . our first known result is the following . [ 1 : 1 ] there is @ x##math75 shows that the theorem is true . let @ xmath66 be an hlder continuous function in @ xmath59 . then @ xmath76 is hlder continuous in @ xmath32 , for @ xmath77 . if @ xmath66 is analytic , then @ xmath76 is analytic in @ xmath32 , for @ xmath78 and a positive @ xmath66 - valued function @ xmath79 . similarly , the lyapunov terms @ xmath72 , @ xmath80 , are analytic in @ xmath32 for @ xmath77 . in particular , the negative lyapunov term is analytic : @ xmath81 , for @ xmath82 . the proof is given as follows . theorem [ prop : 1 ] is stated as theorem [ prop : 2 ] above . the proof follows the following steps of @ xcite : ( 1 ) we first solve the equations for the # ##s and solve them recursively to higher order in @ xmath32 ; ( 2 ) , we get the result of the proof ( which is not necessarily necessarily truedefine ( @ xmath32 ) in terms of tree values ( for graphs without edges ) ; series with @ xmath83 values are equal to @ xmath84 _ _ _ _ _ _ , which is also a fraction of @ xmath32 ; ( ... ) then , using the above definition , we have an upper bound on the tree values . the fact that the tree is zero , of size @ xmath85 , has two consequences @ xmath86 . the values of the tree are , for all @ xmath87 values on the graph and , we need to prove that for all of @ xmath87 values less than a fraction of @ xmath83 , if @ xmath83 is the number of nodes in the tree . this is done by expanding the tree , starting from the tree @ xmath39 . section [ prop : 2 ] is replaced by section [ prop : 3 ] . the proof extends the above representation to the representation of the positive lyapunov function @ xmath88 on the original graph , in the form of ( * ? ? ? * * * ) and @ xcite . the proofthe lyapunov entropy @ xmath89 plays the role of the maximum entropy for the invariant manifold @ xmath90 . thus , given a taylor expansion for @ xmath89 , @ xmath90 can be expressed using the taylor expansion of , as : ( * ? ? ? * = 2 ) . similarly , @ xmath72 can be expressed as one of the principal components of the probability distribution . in section [ 1 : 2 ] , we define the experimental conditions for the linear to non - linear transformation of the invariant manifold , and solve the equations . in this section , we describe the dynamics for the invariant manifold , by defining a function that maps the entropy associated to the transition onto the corresponding dynamics . the dynamics are given by @ xmath91 , with @ xmath92 where @ xmath93 is the entropy of @ xmath94 . let @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 be the experimental conditions for and @ xmath97 . we then look for a solution to of the equation @ xmath98 for @ xmath##99 , with support of @ xmath100 the following equation for @ xmath29 can be obtained by ` ` expanding the vector field at first order in @ xmath101 and at second order in @ xmath102 ' ' , i . e . in @ xmath103 where @ xmath104 and g ( , t ) : = g ( t ) ( ) + u ( , t ) , w _ t + u + u ( , t ) , t ) - _ 1 ( , t ) - _ 0 ( , t ) w ( , t ) . [ 3 . 5 ] the idea behind the equation is that the ( linear ) approximate dynamics obtained by expanding @ xmath105 is dissipative , with growth rate equal to @ xmath32 , subject to the following condition : : this will allow us to model the approximate dynamics as a function of the linear dynamics . the solution obtained by expanding @ xmath105 is the only one with unity . in fact we could have expanded the field at first order both in @ xmath101 and in @ xmath106 , and the solution would be qu##alitatively the following . we first consider @ xmath107 and then @ xmath108 such that @ xmath109 ; then we give @ xmath110 the expression for @ xmath13 , if expressed in terms of @ xmath111 , and , after solving , @ xmath112 for @ xmath113 , these give [ e : 2 . 7 ] @ xmath114 it is possible to take the first , @ xmath115 , to be a parameter independent to @ xmath32 , and write and get [ e : 2 . 7 ] @ xmath116 the idea is to first take @ xmath115 as a parameter independent of @ xmath117 , and find the solution in the form of a taylor series in @ xmath32 , with coefficients dependent on @ xmath60 , and then find that the ( @ xmath115 - 1 ) coefficient of each of the coefficients in @ xmath32 is not @ xmath118 , @ xmath119 , but not @ xmath60 : this means that we should be able to solve@ xmath120 without considering the summability of the solutions . alternatively , we may look for a solution of of the form @ xmath121 with [ x : 2 . 11 ] @ xmath122 and : @ xmath123 , with @ xmath11 and @ xmath124 as in ; @ xmath105 , as in ; @ xmath60 may be further expanded back to @ xmath32 . the solution to - is looked for in the form of a power series as in @ xmath117 ( at least @ xmath60 , in the example given above ) . first , we take [ x : 2 . 11 ] @ xmath125 and expand these terms into . using the same method for @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 , we may find ( on @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 ) @ xmath128 where @ xmath129 is the direct sum of the forms @ xmath130 , and @ xmath131 and similarly for @ xmath132 ( note that @ xmath133and @ xmath6 ( the generators and eigenvectors of @ xmath134 ) ; since and , we have given for @ xmath135 the corresponding inner product of @ xmath136 . for @ xmath137 where @ xmath138 and @ xmath139 . for numerical analysis , we have since found that the product of @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 is , by the cauchy formula , @ xmath140 for all of @ xmath141 , and for @ xmath142 ( with @ xmath143 ) . ( @ xmath144 , @ xmath145 , and @ xmath146 , with @ xmath147 ) . taking @ xmath148 and taking into , we have for @ xmath149 [ 1 : 1 . 5 ] @ xmath150 and the product @ xmath151 where @ xmath152 . since and , , if @ xmath153 , the product @ xmath154 should be written as and , and .for the coefficients , in the form that @ xmath155 and / or @ xmath156 . then , for @ xmath157 , we have , for @ xmath158 , [ 1 : 1 . 5 ] @ xmath159 where @ xmath160 . we also need to find the successive terms of the sequence obtained from the addition operation ; the objective is to show that the @ xmath83 - th term is unique up to @ xmath161 , with @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 . we know how to represent all the coefficients , in terms of rooted trees ( or rooted trees , in the diagram ) , in @ xcite . we refer to ( * ? ? ? * * 2 ) for the use of symbols and symbols . with respect to the coefficients of @ xcite in the first case there are three _ types _ of coefficients . we define the nodes , , and , for them , of : @ xmath164 , @ xmath165 , @ xmath166 and @ xmath167 , where : they correspond to up to @ xmath168, etc . the node @ xmath129 is a node of type 0 or 1 to be immediately followed by any other node of these two types . note that the _ node _ is a partially ordered set of nodes and lines ; the partial order relation is represented by @ xmath169 and a line can be represented by an arrow pointing from the node it leaves to the node it enters . we call @ xmath170 the set of nodes and @ xmath171 the set of lines of the node @ xmath172 . then in @ xcite we call by @ xmath173 the line after that @ xmath174 for the node @ xmath175 : @ xmath173 will be called the _ root node _ and the line following @ xmath173 will be called the _ root node _ . the next node can be considered to be a new node , called the root , which , however , is not known as a node . with each node we associate a label @ xmath176 to denote a type and a label [ @ xmath177 $ ] . with the labels of types 2 and 3 we also associate a label @ xmat##h178 . denote by @ xmath179 the number of nodes from @ xmath29 to @ xmath180 , with both @ xmath181 and @ xmath29 if , and @ xmath182 where @ xmath183 if @ xmath184 , @ xmath185 if @ xmath186 , and @ xmath187 if . for each node @ xmath181 , we denote by @ xmath188 the next node immediately preceding it ; next , we let @ xmath189 be the number of nodes of type @ xmath190 immediately preceding it ; if @ xmath191 , we can define @ xmath192 , @ xmath193 , to be the number of nodes @ xmath29 of type @ xmath190 with @ xmath194 immediately preceding it ( i . e . , that @ xmath195 ) . next , we define @ xmath196 , with @ xmath197 , and @ xmath198 . a node @ xmath181 is called a _ x - ._ if @ xmath199 , then it is not an _ _ node _ if it is not an end - node . the _ node index _ @ xmath200 is defined by @ xmath201 where @ xmath202 is defined as corresponding to @ xmath203 , and the _ node index _ _ @ xmath204 with the example above , we denote by @ xmath205 the set of all nodes with @ xmath83 , , @ xmath206 , and the requirement that nodes of type @ xmath164 and @ xmath165 must not be immediately followed by any one node of type @ xmath164 with @ xmath165 ;

node . similarly , with each node @ xmath181 with @ xmath321 , we associate a label @ xmath322 , and we define @ xmath323 for all nodes @ xmath181 with @ xmath324 ; with each node @ xmath181 with @ xmath325 , we associate a label @ xmath326 so that either @ xmath327 or @ xmath328 ( so that if @ xmath181 is between nodes of type @ xmath314 and @ xmath320 , so that either @ xmath329 or @ xmath330 = @ xmath331 ) , and a label @ xmath332 ; if @ xmath181 is of type @ xmath315 then @ xmath316 we define @ xmath187 . if@ xmath333 is the number of lines entering @ xmath181 and @ xmath334 the number of lines of entering @ xmath190 entering @ xmath181 , we have the types @ xmath335 and @ xmath336 . example : @ xmath337 ; @ xmath338 . if @ xmath339 and @ xmath340 be the nodes immediately preceding @ xmath181 , both @ xmath341 and @ xmath342 . if @ xmath343 , then @ xmath344 be the two nodes immediately preceding @ xmath181 ; if @ xmath345 , with no loss of detail we assume that @ xmath340 is of type @ xmath346 ( so that @ xmath347 is of type @ xmath314 ) ; if @ xmath348 , with no loss of detail we assume that @ xmath340 is of type @ xmath314 ( so that @ xmath347 is of type @ xmath315 ) ; in both cases wedefine the constraints that @ xmath349 , @ xmath350 and @ xmath351 . denote by @ xmath188 the constraint . for @ xmath181 , we define @ xmath352 , and @ xmath353 we are then able to define the _ node _ _ associated with the constraint : @ xmath354 finally , after considering the tree representation in figure [ fig : rappresentazione - grafica - di gamma ^ n ] and [ fig : rappresentazione - grafica - di gamma ^ n ] , we come up with : such that in figure [ fig : esempi - di - alberi - # ##i ] for @ xmath289 ; suppose that the k - nodes are all of type @ xmath316 . if @ xmath286 the only condition is that the _ node @ xmath355 is of type @ xmath315 . with the constraints above , we denote by @ xmath356 the number of _ nodes such that @ xmath357 , @ xmath206 , and the constraints and factors described above . then weis easy to see by showing that @ xmath358 where @ xmath359 = @ xmath360 , we let @ xmath217 be the number of independent variables starting from @ xmath218 , with the exception of the constant @ xmath219 . then , similarly , it is easy to see that @ xmath361 } , \ ] ] which also implies that @ xmath362 } , \ ] ] for a positive constant @ xmath363 . similarly , the radius of curvature at @ xmath32 of the equation for @ xmath255 and @ xmath364 is equal to @ xmath365 , which allows us to see that @ xmath366 . the lyapunov functions @ xmath367 are the time derivatives of the constant @ xmath368 . therefore , if @ xmath369 is the action of @ xmath370 on the system @ xmath49 , the resulting system @ xmath371 is equivalent to the asonov system and so it is unique : the time - averaged observablesis @ xmath41 - 1 . therefore , there is a unique srb measure @ xmath372 such that @ xmath373 the system @ xmath374 can be represented as , as in ( * ? ? ? * chapter 5 ) . let @ xmath375 be the random partition for @ xmath134 on @ xmath376 and on @ xmath377 . call @ xmath378 the symbolic code induced by the random partition @ xmath379 and induced by @ xmath380 the symbolic code of the measure @ xmath381 , i . e . @ xmath382 . then the decay rate of @ xmath369 on the shortest path of @ xmath383 on @ xmath384 , where @ xmath385 with @ xmath386 is the transfer function and @ xmath387 . if @ xmath374 is the probability distribution for the transfer function @ xmath388 ( in ( * ? ? ? * chapter 6 ) ) , then the srb measure @ xmath389 for the system @ xmath##371 = @ xmath374 and can be defined by ( * ( * ? ? ? * ( * ) ) . then , by definition , @ xmath388 is analytic in @ xmath32 and hlder - continuous in @ xmath380 . similarly , for any hlder - continuous in @ xmath390 , the derivative of @ xmath391 is hlder - continuous in @ xmath32 for @ xmath77 . if @ xmath66 is analytic for @ xmath32 , then there is a new function @ xmath392 , defined in @ xmath66 , so that @ xmath393 is analytic for @ xmath394 . in addition the lyapunov functions are analytic in @ xmath32 and , from , one gets @ xmath395 this is the proof of theorem [ 1 : 2 ] . in this proof , we discuss briefly some of the consequences of our previous result , and also a statement about the transition from analytic to analytic ( linear ) functions , which is proved by our theorem . from theorem [ 1 : 2 ] we see that the function @ xmat##h54 of the system is not @ xmath396lder ##d , so we do not have any control over the dimensional differentiability . this implies that our dimension must be infinite , and we would expect this to be the case for @ xmath32 ##0 and # m . an approximate description of the infinite dimension of the system in terms of the lyapunov dimension is given by the _ lyapunov conjecture _ @ xmath397 , which is stated as follows . consider an arbitrary ##al system with the srb field as its dimension , and let @ xmath398 be the lyapunov dimension , along with their values . then , @ xmath399 where @ xmath400 is the smallest number such that @ xmath401 . the _ kaplan - yorke conjecture _ @ xcite states that @ xmath402 agrees with the hausdorff dimension of the system ( also known as the _ _ dimension _ , or , e . g . , ( * ? ? ? * chapt . 5 . 5 . 5 ) for a full list ) . in this case , weconsider @ xmath397 as a rough estimate of the total dimension of the expansion , without worrying about the general ##ity of the conjecture ( which has been successfully proven in some special cases , as e . g . ) . applying the proof of @ xmath397 to our case , we find that , for @ xmath32 very large , r _ 2 = 2 + = 2 + + r _ 2 ( ) , [ e : fract ] where @ xmath403 is the largest element of size 2 in @ xmath32 , which is expressed as in terms of the taylor series obtained from the above formula . note that @ xmath404 , so that @ xmath405 is less than 2 ( as desired ) and is not in @ xmath32 , for @ xmath32 large . finally , consistent with the kalpan - yorke conjecture , ( [ e : fract ] ) so that the expansion is constant for @ xmath32 large , and the total dimension increases ( as desired ) , increasing the size @ xmath32 of the dissipative expansion . this is also .to get to different values of @ xmath32 ( and within the limits of proof of by [ 1 : 1 ] ) , get to the point where , say , the partial equality of @ xmath74 and @ xmath406 holds . for the simple case that @ xmath33 ( which is the case described in @ xcite ) , the lyapunov and @ xmath407 are independent of @ xmath32 : @ xmath408 . then , on the basis of , we find that by increasing @ xmath32 the hausdorff dimension of the manifold increases from @ xmath167 to @ xmath166 until @ xmath32 reaches the critical value @ xmath409 , where @ xmath410 . therefore , this critical value is @ xmath411 ( first order ) , the second order is obtained via the method described in the previous section . for @ xmath412 , we define the manifold to be a smooth manifold of dimension 3 . the result is shown in fig . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] for the simple case that @ xmath33 and@ xmath413 , in which case the final output value is @ xmath414 .
