multiscale dynamics is used in many fields , e . g . , chemistry @ xcite , physics @ xcite , geosciences @ xcite , etc , to name a few . it has been observed in some multiscale dynamics experiments that the self - similarity is important , in which the concept of multiscaling or multifractal is used @ xcite . this is done mainly by measuring the wave - scale ( sfs ) , i . e . , @ xmath10 , in which @ xmath11 is an integer with the measured @ xmath2 . note that for the self - similarity process , e . g . , fast brownian motion ( fbm ) , the measured @ xmath0 is convex with @ xmath12 . but for the multifractal process , e . g . , angular momentum , it is not convex with @ xmath12 . various methods are used to measure the mean value . for example , vector based methods , ( e . g . , wave ##lets , vector - based methods @ xcite ) , vector - based methods @ xcite , and the statistical method of probability density functions of the increm##ents @ xcite , to name a few . each model has different theoretical strengths and weaknesses . for example , the classical sfs is assumed to contain both of the large - ( resp . known as infrared effect ) and small - scale ( resp . known as ultraviolet effect ) structures @ xcite . the large scale factor @ xmath0 is strongly correlated when the small scale structure is considered @ xcite . however the influence of the small - scale structure has been studied independently by different groups @ xcite . for example , praskvosky et al . , @ xcite found a dependence between the small scale and the classical sfs at different time scales . sreenivasan & stolovitzky @ xcite found that the time dependence of the sfs based on the large scale structure has a large effect . huang et al . , @ xcite found also that the influence of the small - scale structure could be as large as several times compared to the large scale . blum et al . , @ xcite studied only the nonuniversal small - scale structure , using both the eulerian and lagrangian sfs . they found that the sfs depends on the size of the- like structures at different scales . in their model , the large - scale structure velocity is represented as floating - point values , i . e . , @ xmath13 / [ $ ] , for which @ xmath14 is the structure velocity of their experimental data . note that they conditioned sfs at all scales of @ xmath15 . later , blum et al . , @ xcite ##d studied the large - scale structures conditioned sfs for different turbulent flows . they found that for all turbulent flows the conditioned sfs depends only on large - scale structures at different scales . in this study , the detrended transfer - function ( dsf ) method is used to calculate values of @ xmath0 . this is done by taking the @ xmath1st - th scale from the domain of @ xmath2 and using the transfer function . this method is known as detrending analysis ( da ) . by doing this , structures larger than @ xmath2 , i . e . , @ xmath3 , are able to be calculated and analyzed . thus , the da acts as a low - pass filter in the system . however , the da is very important . the velocity of##rement @ xmath16 is also defined for the sample set @ xmath2 . the @ xmath12th - order version of @ xmath16 was introduced in @ xmath12th - order dsf . the dsf was first obtained by using a weighted average brownian motion ( fbm ) and a lognormal distribution with an average period @ xmath17 , for multi - dimensional and multifractal samples . it was found that dsfs had corresponding scaling values @ xmath0 and maximum values @ xmath4 with the values given by the original sfs . when applied to a reference sample with a real number @ xmath18 , the @ xmath19rd - order dsf has a corresponding maximum value @ xmath7 , which is consistent with the range given by the fourier transform of @ xmath20 , e . g . , @ xmath8 . therefore , the maximum value of the @ xmath19rd - order dsf is @ xmath21 . this result is consistent with the modified kolmogorov twenty - second law . the first time scaling of @ xmath0( resp . , of @ xmath4 ) works equally well with the lognormal model with the additional parameter @ xmath9 . due to the large - scale effects , such as light scattering , the sfs is nonlinear . note that the correlation ##s are calculated directly without reference to the all - for - all ( as ) method . the method is flexible and could be applied to many types of data , for which the multiscale and multifractal methods are used . we start out with the linear transformation @ xmath22 , which produces a power - law power law , i . e . , @ xmath23 in which @ xmath24 is the coupling constant of @ xmath25 . the parseval method then produces the following statement , i . e . , @ xmath26 in which @ xmath27 is the scale , @ xmath25 is the second power law of @ xmath22 @ xcite . we then transform the data @ xmath22 into @ xmath28 , with unit variance @ xmath2 etc . the @ xmath29th - dimensional detrending of the @ xmath30thit is defined as , i . e . , @ xmath31 in which @ xmath32 is the @ xmath29th - order square root of the @ xmath33 . we have also , for the second - order detrending , i . e . , @ xmath34 . to produce a detrended signal , i . e . , @ xmath35 $ ] , each signal component is placed in a segment of @ xmath2 . then , components higher than @ xmath2 , i . e . , @ xmath36 are removed or constrained from the input of @ xmath22 . this illustrates that the da procedure is a high - pass filter in the frequency domain . the signal energy of @ xmath37 is associated directly with the fourier power spectrum , i . e . , @ xmath38 in which @ xmath39 and @ xmath40 are the fourier power spectrum of @ xmath37 . this illustrates , that the da procedure is as high - pass filter , in which the two signal components @ xmath41 ( resp . @ xmath36 ) are required to be removed or constrained . for the da procedure , the. . . , @ xmath42 , which has a power - law form , i . e . , @ xmath43 the physical meaning of @ xmath44 is very simple . it is the peak velocity of the frequency wavenumber [ @ xmath45 $ ] ( resp . [ @ @ xmath46 $ ] ) . we note here , that the sf acts as a low - pass filter in frequency , and the physical meaning of @ xmath22 is very important . the non - detrending term can remove / reduce the small - scale effects , such as infrared effect . this could be used to modify the sf to remove / reduce the large - scale infrared effect as well . using the formula , , , the sf term can be defined with the window size @ xmath2 , , i . e . , @ xmath47 , which @ xmath30 is for the @ xmath30th order . we will explain in the next section how we define velocity terms with the window size of the window size . the @ xmath12th - order dsf is then defined as , i . e . ,@ xmath48 for a similar situation , we expect a power - law behavior , i . e . , @ xmath49 in which the scaling of @ xmath0 is identical with the one given by the original sfs . to avoid the order of @ xmath12 ( resp . the negative order of the scaling of @ xmath4 , see table below ) , the dsfs can be written as , i . e . , @ xmath50 in which @ xmath51 is the basis for the @ xmath30th order . a power - law behavior is expected , i . e . , @ xmath52 . it was shown , that when @ xmath53 , viz . ( [ p : dsf ] ) and ( [ q : rdsf ] ) have the same order as @ xmath0 . in the literature we do not distinguish these two cases for dsfs . for other examples : structure - function @ xmath54 ( solid line ) , second - order detrending function @ xmath55 ( solid - line ) , and the detrended structure - function @ xmath56 (( straight line ) . the detrended scale @ xmath2 is represented as a simple straight line with @ xmath39 . however , values greater than @ xmath2 , i . e . , @ xmath57 ( resp . @ xmath41 ) are not to be represented by the detrending scale . ] to understand better the general nature of the detrending scale and dsfs , we have : the weight function @ xmath58 , i . e . , @ xmath59 for which @ xmath25 is the full scale factor of @ xmath22 , and @ xmath60 is the second - order moment , which could be values of @ xmath44 , @ xmath61 , and @ xmath62 , respectively . the weight function @ xmath58 is the ratio of the decay constant to the total second - order moment . note that the decay constant is defined in the form . ( [ 1 : 2 ] ) . for the second - order sfs , one has the fast weight function @ xcite , i . e . , @ xmath63 for the decay constant , one also has a fast weight##ing ##le transform , i . e . @ xmath42 with @ xmath64 . however , the effect from large - scale ( resp . , wavenumber - scale ) is large . the sfs can be more complicated than the small - scale effect for the scale of @ xmath24 @ xcite . for the detrended scale , the corresponding weight function is defined to be in the vertical , i . e . , @ xmath65 the dsfs ( resp . the combination of the ms and sf ) has no weight function , i . e . , @ xmath66 . with the other sfs , the dsfs described above can eliminate / reduce the large - scale effect . figure [ 1 : 1 ] shows the expression @ xmath58 for the sf , detrending scale , and dsf , respectively . the detrended scale @ xmath2 is represented by a similar figure , i . e . , @ xmath39 . we see here that with the addition of vs . ( [ 1 : dvi ] ) , @ xmath61 has a perfectly consistent expression with the le transform of @ xmath25 since we have @ xmat##h67 . this is the main reason why we associate the weight value with the sample length of the sample : @ xmath2 . we have more comments in ref . ( [ e : weight ] ) . the above formula is only valid for linear and nonlinear data . in general , the data is both linear and nonstationary for both cases , see the comments in ref . @ xcite . however , ref . ( [ e : weight ] ) is valid for nonlinear data . another reason needs to be added : for the detrending method . two methods can be used to find the range @ xcite . first , the data might be linear or nonlinear . second , different detrending methods might give different results . in the above example , we will use the @ xmath1st - the standard detrending method , which is valid for both types of data . for the brownian motion with @ xmath68 , the range @ xmath69 . the figure shows the error of @ xmath70 on the range @ xmath71 . the errorbar shows the standard error ##s from 1 % . second , we should use @ xmath72and @ xmath73 . both methods provide the spectra @ xmath74 and @ xmath4 and statistical error . ] for the lognormal distribution with an unknown parameter @ xmath17 . the errorbar is the standard deviation from the data points . the theoretical error curve is represented by a straight line . both methods provide the theoretical spectrum of @ xmath4 and statistical error . ] we also consider that the classical brownian motion is a continuous self - consistent process . fbm is a similar non - stationary process with a constant time evolution , which is represented by @ xmath75 , the hurst number @ xmath76 @ xcite . the chung - chan method is used to compute the fbm with the hurst number @ xmath68 . we find two samples with a minimum of @ xmath77 ##8 each . power - law behavior is observed for a finite - number of samples for @ xmath78 . the theoretical error curve is , i . e . , @ xmath79 if , we should find a single type of error associated with @ xmath72 and @ xmat##h73 . however , in practice , the measured singular ##ity @ xmath4 is usually measured on a narrow scale . the [ ref : fbm ] shows the measured singular spectrum @ xmath4 for sfs ( @ xmath80 ) and dsfs ( @ xmath81 ) for @ xmath78 , after which the computer measures the measured singular @ xmath4 and in the sample @ xmath82 . thus , both scales have the same @ xmath4 and the same standard deviation , which is defined as the standard deviation from their values . we now consider a multifractal random variable with a lognormal distribution @ xcite . a simple random sampling process with a lognormal distribution is used to obtain the multifractal distribution @ xmath83 . the first scale corresponds to a unit scale of size @ xmath84 , where @ xmath85 is the length scale , and @ xmath86 is the width scale considered . in practice for a larger scale , this scale is usually expressed as @ xmath87 @ xcite . the second scale then corresponds to @ xmath8##8 cells , one of which @ xmath89 . this is done and the time @ xmath90 ( @ xmath91 ) @ xmath92 cells are produced . then , at each step the multifractal measure @ xmath83 appears as the value of @ xmath12 ##4 random variables , i . e . , @ xmath93 where @ xmath94 is the random variable corresponding to time @ xmath95 and position @ xmath28 is the position @ xcite . using the multifractal random variable for @ xcite , the nonstationary multifractal time series can be written as , i . e . , @ xmath96 where @ xmath97 is brownian motion . using the lognormal measure for @ xmath98 , the maximum of @ xmath0 for the sfs , i . e . , @ xmath99 , is written as , @ xmath100 where @ xmath101 is the value of ( @ xmath102 ) . the lognormal multifractal measure @ xcite. . multifractal time series are calculated using this . ( [ fig : multitime ] ) . an additional value @ xmath17 is calculated for @ xmath103 points each , corresponding to the average error @ xmath104 points each . a total of 10 experiments are performed . the average error is then calculated as the standard deviation from these values . the [ fig : wfbm ] shows the two theoretical value spectra @ xmath4 , in which the theoretical value is represented as a single figure . similarly , the theoretical value spectra @ xmath4 are represented as two figures . the performance is then shown to be the same for both methods . we would like to make some comments on the performance of these two methods . for the experimental processes , they have the same properties since there is no random ##ness in these two processes . and for the theoretical processes , as we discussed above , they have nonstationary and stable properties @ xcite . however , as discussed further below , they also have different properties . and @ xmath105 from experimental turbulence and experimental simulated turbulent flow . they are both second - order sfs with ( @ xmat##h80 ) and without ( @ xmath81 ) absolute value , and second - order dsfs with ( @ xmath106 ) and without ( @ xmath107 ) absolute value . the first in order is the kolmogorovs one - third scale . an angular plateau for @ xmath108 indicates an angular range on the range @ xmath7 , corresponding to the wavenumber of @ xmath8 . roughly speaking , a plateau for @ xmath109 indicates an angular range on the range @ xmath110 . the range of the angular range is : @ xmath111 ( @ xmath81 ) , @ xmath112 ( @ xmath80 ) , @ xmath113 ( @ xmath107 ) and @ xmath21 ( @ xmath106 ) , for which the standard range is the standard value ##s from the angular range . note that the corresponding ranges are @ xmath110 for the sfs and @ xmath7 for the dsfs . the standard error values @ xmath114 and @ xmat##h115 , @ xmath116 , @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 . the statistical error is the 100 % statistical error of the original model . ] . the errorbar is the standard deviation from previous values . the figure shows the various statistical errors @ xmath0 . for example , the lognormal distribution with an imaginary component @ xmath9 is represented by a straight line . ] we have compared the velocity profile obtained from the high reynolds number wind tunnel performed at the johns - hopkins laboratory with the number @ xmath18 . a phased array with four x - ray - spot detectors is used to measure the velocity with a peak wavenumber of @ xmath119khz in streamwise direction @ xmath120 , of which @ xmath121 is the direction of the wind flow . these detectors are placed at the horizon line and along the center line of the wind tunnel to measure the measured velocity profile for a period of 1 minute . the process is then repeated for several minutes . finally , we have @ xmath122 measurements . ( number of measurements @ xmath123 number of measurements @ .##math123 with ( @ xmath123 ) wavenumber ) . thus , there are 1000 samples ( number of samples @ xmath123 number of samples ) . the total number of @ xmath20 of the measured time shows a full two ##fold of dependence on the wavenumber . @ xmath8 with the scale , @ xmath124 , in space . this corresponds to the scale @ xmath7 . the @ xmath125 is the kolmogorov scale . note that we extend our data into real space by using the inverse spatial scale @ xcite . more information about this scale can be found at ref . @ xcite . to determine the spatial scale in real space , we apply the first and second - order derivatives in space . [ 1 : 1 ] for the sfs ( @ xmath126 with ( @ xmath80 ) and without ( @ xmath81 ) absolute value ) , dsfs ( @ xmath105 with ( @ xmath106 ) and without ( @ xmath107 ) absolute value ) , etc . the right - line of the kolmogorovsfour - fifth law . a plateau is observed for @ xmath105 in the range @ xmath7 , which corresponds very closely with the extreme range predicted for @ xmath20 , i . e . , in the range @ xmath8 . the corresponding height and scaling factor are @ xmath21 with absolute value ( resp . @ xmath113 without absolute value ) and @ xmath127 ( resp . @ xmath128 ) , respectively . the corresponding variance is the standard deviation ##s from the range @ xmath7 . note that the kolmogorovs four - fifth law has a extreme range @ xmath129 . it is important to note that , regardless of the range , we have @ xmath130 , the multi - scale limit . for this , the second - order sfs is often used . roughly speaking , a plateau is observed in the range @ xmath110 . this extreme range is larger than the range predicted by the fourier transform of dsfs , which is also known as the multi - scale limit . the corresponding height and scaling factor are @ xmath111 without absolute value ( resp .@ xmath112 with ( zero ) and @ xmath115 ( resp . @ xmath131 ) . however , the dsfs has a better understanding of the peak effect since it limits / ignores the small - angle effects . we can calculate the scaled factors for the @ xmath132 on the range @ xmath7 for @ xmath69 directly without referring to the previous non - scaling factor @ xcite . for the sfs , we calculate the scaled factors @ xmath0 on the range @ xmath110 for @ xmath82 directly . figure [ 1 : 1 ] shows the peak intensity of @ xmath4 for @ xmath78 , for which the errorbar shows a small deviation from 1 hz . the figure shows the additional additional parameter @ xmath0 . for example , the lognormal curve @ xmath133 with the additional parameter @ xmath9 is shown as a straight line . thus , the dsfs curve closely resembles the lognormal curve as shown in the first figure ( resp . @ xmath134 ) .shown on the right side ( resp . @ xmath135 ) . due to the large - scale motion , the sfs measures the scaling spectrum @ xmath0 when @ xmath134 @ xcite . this leads to removal of the mass spectrum of the system @ xmath4 ( see @ xmath80 , ref . [ 1 : 1 ] ) . therefore , if one uses the same technique when measuring the sf ##s spectrum @ xmath0 , the resulting mass spectrum @ xmath4 is not directly compared to the mass spectrum . this has been interpreted as that the sf technique exploits the finite reynolds number effect . we note here that if one removes / suppress the effect of large - scale motions , one can remove the scaling spectrum @ xmath0 ( resp . mass spectrum @ xmath4 ) without using the same technique . or in other words , the finite reynolds number effect results in large - scale motions , which is therefore theoretical motion . in this case , we use the detrended phase - change technique to remove / suppress the effect of large - scale ., known as the taylor process . in the first step of our algorithm , the @ xmath1st - th probability value is removed with the window size @ xmath2 . by doing this , the values greater than @ xmath2 , i . e . , @ xmath136 , are able to be removed / added . in the second step , the linear distribution is removed with a decrease of the window size . the dsf model is constructed using the induced nonlinear brownian motion for the non - linear process and the lognormal random walk for the multifractal process . the same study shows that the sfs and dsfs models provide a better fit for nonlinear data without adding noise . when compared to the turbulent velocity data from the low reynolds number wind tunnel model , the 3rd - order dsfs provide a well defined distribution in the region @ xmath7 with the linear distribution @ xmath137 . the linear distribution provided by dsfs is identical with the distribution provided by the turbulent velocity data . note that , regardless of the model , the kolmogorovs 3 - degree coefficient was used for the 3rd - order dsfs . the corresponding 3 -this sfs is used for the large - scale structures , such as the hall model . it has a finite dynamic range and has the first - order scaling factor @ xmath114 . the scale factors @ xmath0 are also calculated directly without resort to the above technique . the first additional spectrum @ xmath4 calculated by the dsfs technique yields the lognormal model with an additional spectrum @ xmath9 on the range @ xmath69 . similarly , the second sfs has the same range of spectrum @ xmath4 ( resp . without the additional scaling factor @ xmath0 ) on the range @ xmath138 . this has been described as reynolds - effect error and can be recovered directly using the above technique . however , to our advantage , we see for the first time that if one ignores / reduces the range of the large - scale structures , one can recover the lognormal model without resort to the above technique . the technique we use here is general and applicable to all complex dynamic systems , to which the multiscale structures are applied . it should be carefully considered .to compare turbulent velocity data with high reynolds numbers to determine whether the high reynolds number phenomenon occurs in large - scale flows as well , we look for high reynolds number turbulent velocity . this project is supported by the national natural science foundation of china research institute ( no . 11072139 , 11032007 , 11161160554 , 11272196 , 11202122 and 11332006 ) , chang jiang university of technology ( no . 12pj1403500 ) , the project of shanghai higher education foundation ( no . 11zz87 ) and the china foundation for scientific research projects , shanghai . f . c . thanks f . schmitt for his comments and suggestions . we thank c . meneveau for providing his turbulent velocity data , which is available for download at prof . meneveau online . online : http : / / www . cornell . jhu . edu / meneveau / datasets . html . we thank the following invited authors for their helpful comments and suggestions . f . schmitt , y . huang , y . wang , y . liu , and y . fernandez , _ analysis of the data and their application _ to the neutral _ _ _ _ _ _, nature . vol . 2 ( 2009 ) , pp . 473481 . m . muzy , m . bacry , and m . arneodo , _ multifractal methods for data analysis : the kernel -
