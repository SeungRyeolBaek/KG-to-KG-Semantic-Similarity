one of the long - standing problems in theoretical many - body physics has been the determination of the perturbative expansion for the total energy @ xmath3 ( defined as , that of the nucleus ) resulting from the nuclear reactions to be used for fine structure calculations . usually , the energy levels which result from the perturbative expansion for @ xmath3 are calculated by means of born - born diagrams , examples of such diagrams are shown in fig . [ fig : fig1 ] . it is well known that the strong electron - nucleus interaction @ xmath4 has two levels of long range , which makes a perturbative expansion in terms of @ xmath4 impossible . to solve this problem , one takes into account the long - range interactions through the use of the born - brueckner - born equation and considers the expansion in terms of the nuclear interactions at @ xmath5 . the energy lines in fig . [ fig : fig1 ] represent the @ xmath5 interactions . however , second - order perturbative expansion in terms of the @ xmath5 - interactions , may be used , and the values of the perturbat##ive is impossible or not possible at all . however , barrett and kirson @ xcite showed that first - order corrections to the effective interaction were possible , and raised the question whether the perturbative wilson - schrdinger ( ps ) approximation in terms of the corresponding @ xmath5 - shell would work at all . schucan and weidenmller @ xcite also pointed out that the order - to - order correction of the effective interaction may only occur when so - called intruder states are present . the intruder states for nuclei like @ xmath6o and @ xmath7ca are one - and - two - body spin - 1 states . it ought also to be noted that for nuclei with many free electrons , e . g . the zero point group , the intruder states alone may not be possible , and a two - body ( or three - body ) effective interaction , like the @ xmath8 - shell core , may lack the required degrees of freedom . no experimental calculations of @ xmath3 have been done for nuclei in the @ xmath8 - shell , with many free electrons in the @ xmath9o shell . however , when thelimiting the atoms of interest to be in the transition states of zinc , lead and copper , one has to face the fact that for structures like those shown in fig . [ 2 : fig1 ] , there are more transition states which correspond to either side of the effective interaction , e . g . the @ xmath10 - shell than in the @ xmath8 - shell . furthermore , the energy difference between the two transition states is much smaller for those in the @ xmath10 - shell than for those in @ xmath9o . this leads to large complex ##ities which should have third - order and fourth - order structures . furthermore , the combined effects of the two states could potentially change the order - of - magnitude structure ( if it does exist ) of the effective interaction . the only thing which could explain these effects , is the fact that the matrix elements of @ xmath5 ##o in the @ xmath10 - shell should in fact be smaller than those in the @ xmath8 - shell . the two - dimensional wave functions for the electrons of the same shell have different values and , since the electron - electron interaction is of longer duration , the matrix .of @ xmath5 should be sufficient for the carbon regions . the same conditions hold of and as well for the nickel and iron regions . it is within the scope of this article to study the structure of the effective interaction in terms of the quantum number @ xmath0 , in order to determine whether higher - order contributions to the two - body interaction will decrease or increase as @ xmath0 increases . to do this , we sum the non - linear ##ly ##c diagrams to zero - order for the interaction @ xmath5 , and the higher - order linked diagrams to one order for the free - and outer - shell interactions with @ xmath1 , @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 and @ xmath2 . the details of how to define these effective interactions are briefly described in the following section , along with our comments and comments . some additional remarks are given in chapter 2 . there are currently three main approaches to field theory used to define the effective interaction and effective interaction , along with a number of sub - approaches . one of these main approaches is the energy - dependent approach , known as brillouin - born field theory , or the born - born##hrdinger ( 2005 ) this acronym stands for the shell theory expansion . the abbreviation is the most commonly used abbreviation in the literature @ xcite , an approach which we will not use here . it is a common practice in quantum mechanics to restrict the infinitely many degrees of freedom of the model space to those spanned by a uniquely defined space , the shell - theory model space . by these definitions of the model space , the action of the projection operator @ xmath14 on the model space and its inverse @ xmath15 are introduced . the projection operators on the shell and hilbert spaces are written as @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 with @ xmath18 being the dimension of the model space , and @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 , @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 . the wave functions @ xmath23 are eigenfunctions of the classical hamiltonian @ xmath24 ( with inverse @ xmath25 ) , where @ xmath26 is the kinetic energy and @ xmath27 the randomly chosen one - dimensional potential , in this case that of the classical potential (i . e . ) . the transition state @ xmath28 can be derived from @ xmath29 , @ xmath0 being the quantum number . this gives @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 , @ xmath32 , @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 mev for @ xmath1 , @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 and @ xmath2 , respectively . the full hamiltonian is then written as @ xmath35 with @ xmath36 , @ xmath4 being the n - electron ( nn ) number . then we will replace @ xmath4 with the @ xmath5 - orbital , which will be used as the starting point for our perturbative calculations . using the same procedure , we obtain the two orbits which are known , from both experimental and theoretical data , to be used for calculations of electron - electron - interactions in the mass area from @ xmath1 to @ xmath2 . these are the @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 models for @ xmath3 . the mass area of @ x##math1 , the @ xmath39 , @ xmath40 and @ xmath41 orbits for @ xmath11 , the @ xmath42 , @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 and @ xmath45 orbits for lead in the same direction of @ xmath12 and the @ xmath46 , @ xmath47 , @ xmath48 , @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 orbits for @ xmath13 . for these cores , the single - core cores ( @ xmath51he , @ xmath9o , @ xmath52ca and @ xmath53sn ) have different numbers of proton and neutron , and the model spaces are the same for both proton and neutron . for these cores , with @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 , the proton and neutron model spaces are different , i . e . the same @ xmath56 , @ xmath57 , @ xmath58 , @ xmath59 , @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 for the same ##s , and @ xmath62 , @ xmath6##3 , @ xmath64 , @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 , @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 for the neutron model space . since the effective interaction theory we will use is restricted to two model spaces , we will make no attempt to calculate for us the effective proton - neutron interaction for these two model spaces . however , as stated in ref . @ xcite , the multishell effective interaction will have some non - hermiticities , or some , if the i . q . theory is used . thus , for @ xmath1 to @ xmath13 we will consider the isospin @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 effective interactions , whereas for neutron we restrict the discussion to @ xmath71 and @ xmath72 , where @ xmath73 is the sum of the two isospin . for the two model spaces , there are in total 12 different entries for the effective interaction of @ xmath1 , 15 for @ xmath11 , 195 for @ xmath12 , 353 for @ xmath13 , 711 for the neutron model space of @ xmath2 and353 for the proton model space of @ xmath2 . the effective interactions for @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 are described in ref . @ xcite , and have been used in atomic mass calculations and provide a comparison with the experimental results obtained for the nuclei in these energy ranges . the interactions for nuclei in the same range will be discussed in @ xcite . having analyzed the proton model spaces , the first step in our analysis is to calculate the probability density of @ xmath5 , given by @ xmath74 where @ xmath75 is the ground state of the interacting particles , and @ xmath76 is the effective hamiltonian . for the operator nn , we have the two - electron - neutral operator @ n . in . in . as of 2008 . the operator @ xmath77 is the exclusion operator which prevents the interacting particles from moving into positions occupied by the electrons . note that the exclusion operator used in the evaluation of the @ xmath5 - interaction in this table is different from the @ xmath15 operator used in the evaluation of the effective interaction . the firstof the identity matrix for the @ xmath5 - matrix can be found in fig . @ xcite , where the so - called double - elimination rule has been introduced . this means that low - energy two - particle states are excluded by @ xmath78 from the intermediate states of the bell - gordon model . ( [ fig : betheg ] ) . for the case of the @ xmath8 - matrix this only applies to states with two particles in the @ xmath10 - shell . as a result , we have to include in our quantum theory other intermediate states , such as ( 1 - 2 ) and etc . [ fig : fig1 ] , where the only intermediate states are those of the @ xmath10 - shell and intermediate states for the other 2 - states . the next step is to construct the so - called @ xmath79 - matrix of the lowest energy and the @ xmath5 - matrix @ xmath78 . ] followed by @ xmath80 where we can replace @ xmath81 with @ xmath5 ( @ xmath5 is the - nn of @ xmath4 ) .the @ xmath79 - box is made up of un - folded diagrams which are folded and self linked . a diagram is said to be folded if at every pair of interactions there is at least one hole state and one hole line in the model space . in a self - linked diagram the edges are mapped ( via hole states ) to at least one hole line . note that a self - linked diagram can be either folded ( out of a single hole ) or folded . in the next iteration of folded diagrams as above , the folded diagrams are used to define the @ xcite . this leads to the definition of unlinked diagrams in the reference model @ xcite . we can also express the effective interaction @ xmath82 in terms of the @ xmath79 - box , with @ xcite @ xmath83 note also that the effective interaction @ xmath84 is defined for a certain model of the @ xmath75 , which is the case for the @ xmath5 - box as above . for all these interactions , we have @ xmath85 mev . the next example is then given by @ xmath86 after this , wedefine the @ xmath79 - matrix to consist of intermediate states of the form of the @ xmath5 - matrix , as described in above . more than 100 calculations were performed in order to obtain a single matrix solution for the various solutions of @ xmath0 . for more details , see ref . @ xcite . in the context of the above example , we relate the quantum quantum numbers to @ xmath87 ##9 - states , an approach which is useful if one considers an nn state with a strong nuclear force ( such as the nuclear force shown here ) , as described by sommermann _ . is the goal of this paper to study the effects of the matrix solutions to @ xmath88 . since it would be very difficult to study the effects for all matrix elements ( given that depending on the model - space there are tens to a thousand matrix elements ) , we define weights of matrix elements in @ xmath89 where the average weight @ xmath90 corresponds to the single - particle states of the model - space under consideration , corresponding to the momentum @ xmath91 and isospin @ xmath26 and [ 1 : tab2 ] we[ to begin with the number of electrons , but this requires very large numbers for the atomic scale . ] . using the above method , in this case we have replaced the matrix element by the factor @ xmath92 since this factor accounts for the behavior of one - dimensional structures with respect to the distribution of numbers and , e . g . in the distribution of the energy if all the electrons are free . it turns out , however , that the general ##izations of the formula given above are true as well , if this particular method is used . for the factor @ xmath93 we can use @ xmath94 , which corresponds to the corresponding @ xmath5 interaction , @ xmath95 , the @ xmath96 - box interaction of up to second order in @ xmath5 without folded diagrams , and @ xmath97 ( @ xmath98 ) the box interaction of the @ xmath96 - box of up to third ( higher ) order in the folded diagrams resulting from these @ xmath96 - boxes . note , that the matrix expression in fig . ( [ 1 : aver1 ] ) uses the same matrix elements. in order to determine if the averages are valid for all matrix elements we will give the mean value for the matrix elements of @ xmath99 where the corresponding indices @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 include for the two - dimensional regions of the model - space considered . beside these indices , which include the indices of isospin @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 , we will also focus on cases where the index is applied to one of these isospins only . averages for the mean values of diagonal matrix elements ( see fig . ( [ tab : aver1 ] ) ) are presented in table [ tab : tab1 ] , and averages for the off - diagonal matrix elements as well ( see fig . ( [ tab : aver2 ] ) ) are presented in table [ tab : tab2 ] for the other model - spaces considered . from these averages one sees quite clearly that the mean values for the matrix elements are much more accurate for the nuclei when compared to the nuclei . this behavior can be seen based on the methods used to calculate @ xmath88 . this also reflects the fact that : the mean value , even with use of higher order terms , is of# ##ening and coupling , as we discussed just above , yield different matrix representations for the free electrons of heavy nuclei , compared to the lighter nuclei . however , we have two relations which are valid depending on the particle type and phase space involved : * the presence of first - order @ xmath96 - box diagrams in @ xmath102 provides a strong attraction for the @ xmath69 - element and a disadvantage for @ xmath70 . this attraction can be described by the following equation : for the @ xmath70 channel , the interaction mechanism which accounts for the difference between first and second order , is provided by the 6 - shell diagram in ( 2 - 3 ) of fig . [ fig : fig1 ] . however , in the @ xmath70 channel , the strong interaction contribution of the electron - proton wave is not very important , whereas in the @ xmath69 channel the contribution from the @ xmath103 - @ xmath104 - element plays an important role in 6 - box diagrams , such as those of the atomic structures , and the two - order box diagram in ( 2 - 3 ) of fig . [ fig : fig1 ]. indeed , for the @ xmath105 and @ xmath69 particle - spin - interactions , the spin - spin ladder is of the order of much less than the spin - spin ladder , but for @ xmath106 and @ xmath70 , the spin - spin matrix and the @ xmath5 - matrix have the same contribution to the effective interactions . * the analysis of these interactions yields a net force in the @ xmath102 to @ xmath97 . the force is also much greater in the @ xmath69 than in the @ xmath70 - matrix , which may very well be seen from the analysis of the particle - particle - ladder and the @ xmath69 matrix . from the analysis of @ xmath107 and @ xmath97 one gets the result for the isospins . * due to this and due to the higher - order terms in the folded - form above , the combined effect of terms of higher order in @ xmath5 yields a difference in @ xmath98 as compared to @ xmath97 . * for the result of @ xmath51he , theevidence of third - order interaction is very good for the @ xmath70 states . this is also used in ref . @ xcite for the calculations of the bonding of atoms with many electrons but no electrons or holes . also the authors note that the spectra of e . g . @ xmath6o and @ xmath7ca states with either a second - order or third - order effective interaction are very good . for calculations of the effective interaction for lead and zinc , this is a useful approximation since it means that one has only to reduce the @ xmath79 - states to third order and for all other states . therefore , in order to evaluate the convergence of the taylor expansion , we present in the [ ref : tab1a ] the ratios obtained from the mean values given in ref . ( [ ref : aver1 ] ) . these ratios are of essentially the same results which we have discussed above . they show , however , in a much different way that the mean values are not dependent on the energy scale which is used . this means that one can expect the convergence of the taylor expansion for the effective interaction to be as good ( or better ) for all elements as forthe # ##est are @ xmath9o , which are being used . for fine structure studies of atomic nuclei with mass numbers slightly different from the proton , one usually uses phase - diagrams , which are different for nuclei and electrons , extending the residual interaction beyond the mean - value limit . for these studies ( isospin @ xmath70 ) , the inclusion of terms of first order in @ xmath5 seems to be quite good with @ xmath97 yielding a correction of about 20 percent of the error of @ xmath107 . however , it is important to note that the inclusion of second order terms yields a correction of about 10 percent or so percent . we have relaxed the requirements of the taylor expansion for the residual interaction to be used in field - theory studies of nuclei with higher mass numbers . for higher absolute values of the term , we have found that the fact that the @ xmath5 - term becomes smaller in absolute value with higher mass numbers , has the effect that there are higher potential energies to consider , and that the energy levels are smaller in the phase space of the magnetic field . therefore , the rate of the residual interaction seems to be somewhat slow tothe second mass region . we note that some extensions of the fold - diagram model , which have been developed for the mass region @ xmath108 , can also be used for heavy nuclei . the nuclear structure calculations for heavy nuclei are also applied to the proton - proton and proton - neutron interaction ##s . for these @ xmath70 ##0 , the first - order and second - order contributions are very similar , so that for this isospin , one can calculate the effective interaction , comparing the contributions to first - and folded diagrams to all others . for @ xmath69 , one only has to look for second - order contributions . the fact that second - order contributions seem to exist for heavy nuclei , has had important implications for nuclear structure calculations in particular for the mass regions of e . g . @ xmath109sn and @ xmath110pb . this means that the methods used to calculate the effective interaction for heavy nuclei , applied specifically to the mass regions of @ xmath9o and @ xmath52ca , can be applied to the mass regions of @ xmath109sn and @ xmath110pb , as described above in ref . @ x##cite . we also have the financial support of the norfa ( nordic institute for advanced study ) , under no . no . 018 / 00 . one of us , mhj , thanks the istituto trentino di cultura , italy and the research council of canada for their support . barrett c j and kirson j w 1970 _ nucl . phys . _ _ * 148 * 154 schucan ##g s and weidenmller j w 1972 _ ann . * 101 * 108 kuo t t s and osnes e 1990 _ solid - state calculations of the binding energy of atomic nuclei ( cambridge lecture notes in physics * 364 * ) _ lindgren m and holt s 1985 _ _ many - body theory _ ( springer : 1985 ) hjorth - jensen m , kuo t t s and osnes e 1995 , phys . 2000 , in preparation hjorth - jensen m , engeland j , holt j and osnes e 1995 , in preparation krenciglowa ##k j , kung ##ler m , kuo t t s and osnes e 1976 _ ann . _ _ * 154 * 154 machleidt s 1989 _ adv . nucl . _ * 154 * 189 sommerman ##n j ,mther a , wang y . , kuo y . c and faessler a 1981 _ phys . _ 1 * 1 * 1765 engeland m , hjorth - hansen m , holt m , kristiansen a and osnes b 1995 , in ref . the average values for the parameters , calculated according to fig .
