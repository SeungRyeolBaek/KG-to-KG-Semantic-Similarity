since its discovery , in 1980 , the quantum hall ( qh ) effect @ xcite has been a very important cause of many problems related to topological and topological effects in condensed matter physics . the qh effect is observed in two - dimensional quantum gases @ xcite ( 2deg ) subjected to a strong electric field perpendicular to the axis of the molecule . at high energy levels , the 2deg is an excited state . the qh effect presents itself as the systematic and systematic behavior of the electron states . this phenomenon results from the interaction between the quantum states of the # ##s of electrons @ xcite and topological effects , which lead to the formation of a new quantum state . as a result an excited state is formed in the center of the 2deg . at the interface of the 2deg with the qh effect there are , however , gapless chiral states that are the quantum states of the electron states . @ xcite in the presence of strong nuclear interactions , these states can be interpreted as the quantum plasmon states . furthermore , it has been observed @ xcite that , at large values of the energy level , in the quantum state the energy levels of the 2deg areimagine quasi - particles with _ _ charge _ and electric charge . @ xcite for instance , in qh space with a point @ xmath3 , where @ xmath4 is a positive constant , laughlin quasi - particle pairs have an electric charge @ xmath5 , where @ xmath6 is the average electric charge . electrical current can be induced by the particles over short distances with small electrical charge ( qpc ) , thus leading to a large current . [ frol - simpl ] the very existence of laughlin quasi - particles has been confirmed , however , by measurement of the relative frequency of the electric fields . @ xcite the quasi - particle behavior of these particles is derived from the fano factor of noise , which is the ratio of the noise level to the average electrical charge . although , at present , there is no consensus on the validity of the experimental results , this type of noise does not , by itself , constitute a true measurement of the electric charge of quasi - particles . @ xcite however , the fano factor of noise is not absolute and can be reduced or increased for various reasons . @ xcite for instance ,the phenomenon called ` ` ' fractionalization ' ' of nonchiral two - dimensional space @ xcite is a phenomenon of two dimensions that has nothing to do with the motion of fractionally charged quasi - particles . however , this phenomenon resembles the fano effect of light at very low frequencies . @ xcite a direct description of the quasi - particle effect should rely on its existence as a transition term in the quantum hamiltonian of matter to the magnetic field and on the microscopic behavior of quasi - particles . the most common approach is to make use of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) model , @ xcite which relies on the assumption that the motion of quasi - particles is caused by the magnetic field . as a commonly used example of this effect , we consider the gedanken tube effect described in the second part of ref . [ frol - simpl ] . quasi - particles of interest @ xmath7 are the beam electrons and the plates that carry the _ quasi _ magnetic field @ xmath8 . the relative phase of the field lines , for the upper and lower layers , is altered by the motion of @ xmath9 , which leads to the change of the phase from the source to theand as a function of the flux @ xmath8 with quasi - particle period @ xmath2 . the quasi - particles can then be determined by measuring their contribution to the ab effect from their spins with flux @ xmath0 . ab effects with quasi - particle periods greater than the first two have been observed in a number of experimental experiments @ xcite and qh systems of the fabry - prot system . in these experiments , chiral magnetic regions of the qh system form a loop . the magnetic field in the loop is changed either by changing the strength of the applied magnetic field , or by changing the length of the qh loop with the strength of the magnetic field . the physical basis of the experimental data for studying the quasi - particle ab effect is simple . however , it is the subject of much scientific interest for the following reasons . first of all , measurements of the flux in the fabry - prot system as a function of the magnetic field could arise from the field fluctuations @ xcite rather than from ab effects . second , the classical gedanken model of the ab effect described above involves a homogeneous magnetic field passing throughthe rest of the theory is restricted to quasi - particles . this is also the case in the vacuum , see ref . [ ] , where quasi - particles are not affected by the electric field . finally , and most importantly , the gedanken interpretation of the ab effect itself leads to the conclusion : in any electronic system , including all qh systems , ab effects should have an electronic component @ xmath0 , according to the byers - wilson theorem . @ xcite this is correct , because , upon the injection of a flux quantum into a hole in the system , the electronic system returns to its original state , since the flux quantum can be replaced by a two - photon electric field . the first two equations can in fact be solved by using a qh system of a different type , namely the electronic component of the electronic maxwell - zehnder ( mz ) system . @ xcite more recently , ab effects in these systems with qh fields and different coupling ##s have been the subject of both experimental work @ xcite and theoretical work . @ xcite a typical electronic mz system is shown , below , at the bottom left of image . [frol - simpl ] . in this interferometer the 2deg is connected to a disk with a shape roughly similar to an oval , i . e . , the so called corbino disk . chiral excited states are used in place of optical contacts and the qpcs ( arranged as straight lines ) play the role of the beam source . the contacts are connected to the inner and outer sides of the corbino disk and act as a source and filter for the beam . although mz systems are very expensive to build , they have an advantage over fabry - prot systems : first , electrons in the edge channels of the disk are in the same direction and without scattering , because they are separated by the contacts . as a result , the electron beam can be reduced in these systems by simply connecting the edge channels to the disk . second , a large electron beam can , at least in principle , be generated from the surface of the corbino disk , i . e . , in the case of restricted to contacts . thus , the mz systems can be considered to be the solid - state equivalent of the gedanken system described in the article .of m . [ frol - simpl ] . they may also provide an ideal solution for solving the fundamental paradox mentioned above , namely the one associated with the byers - wilson equation . there have been several successful attempts to solve this paradox . @ xcite in the 2000s [ ] , thouless and gefen have studied the energy spectrum of a qh system coupled to the corbino disk and one coupled to the nucleus . they have shown that as a result of the non - periodic interaction between the inner and the outer layers of the corbino disk , the energy spectrum , and nucleus , ` ` the ' periodic state ' ' is a periodic state of the magnetic flux with the same value @ xmath0 . although thouless and gefen have taken an important first step towards understanding the casimir effect in qh systems , their work is only preliminary , and many of their conclusions about the relaxation times and currents are not fully understood . @ xcite the results of their work are difficult to interpret at the level of quantum theory . and , more importantly , they can not yet be applied to the case where the magnetic flux is controlled with the help of a quantum network . this work has attracted much attention in thethe ab effect in mz states . more recently , a number of authors ( see ref . [ ] ) have suggested that the theoretical analysis of the mz states should take into account the introduction of new quantum numbers in the qh state . in the classical theory , identifying the quasi - particle states with these quantum numbers is necessary to determine the actual ab effect . these quantum numbers are often introduced ad hoc , with no explanation . depending on the classical theoretical approach , they are expressed either in terms of quantities called klein factors of the spin state , @ xcite or as the phase transitions induced by quasi - particles located at the outer edge of the corbino region . @ xcite we are aware of only one way to fully explain the introduction of klein factors in mz states : in their original paper [ ] , ponomarenko and averin describe the resummation of the quantum numbers at the inner and outer edges and show that there is a transition to the quasi - particle states , where the klein factors arise naturally . however , their work is valid only at the end of the effective path , where both quasi - particle and spin phase transitions between the two end ##pointsof the renormalization group , . there is no guarantee that both measurements will produce the same result . the results of the experiment [ ] can be summarized as follows : they resolve the byers - yang problem by showing that ab particles with quasi - particle effects can only be observed in the steady - state state of the mz gate . in other words , these measurements do not distinguish between the effects of a magnetic flux , or ##s , and a homogeneous magnetic field . our results do not agree with this conclusion . in another work , @ xcite we have shown that quasi - particle ab effects should be observed if the magnetic flux is changed by changing the edge of the qh gate , or , alternatively , by changing the edge of the homogeneous magnetic field . we have decided to use this work as a useful tool for making measurements of the effects of quasi - particles at different scale scales . in the following paper we present the theoretical basis for this work . our results can be tested directly by putting together the qpcs and comparing the effects of weak quantum effects and of strong quasi - particle effects , where the dimensions of ab particles should differ from each other by .instead of @ xmath4 . our theoretical conclusions are made at three different stages : by solving the classical wave equation for the stationary state of the mz system , constructing an effective theory from it , and describing the transition of the system to a stationary state with a constant q . [ mz ] at the end of the effective theory we arrive at the rather surprising conclusion that the ab effect , in its original form , @ xcite was not produced by qh ##4 . in order to make this important point , we must note that the original description of the effect relied on a two - phase model , where the particle wave travels through the medium , as shown in the upper right of ref . [ frol - simpl ] . while traveling through the upper and lower layers of the medium , the particle wave has a phase diagram with two phases : a dynamic and a kinematic phase , and the two main directions . this picture is very simple and is not widely used in the physics community . however , for the study of the ab effect , this picture is useful , because at high energies , the dynamic phase can be neglected . therefore , it is not necessary to consider the dynamic phase of thewave function models at the many particle interfaces . however , for some systems , such as qh liquids , the many - particle formulation is , strictly speaking , not applicable . in addition , the weak ( gedanken ) nature of the casimir theory can lead to many errors and problems , one of them being the byers - wilson paradox ; ( see also the discussion in ref . [ conseq ] ) . therefore , we need to use many - particle wave function models . to this end , we construct a simple model of the mz , as shown in figure . a qh liquid at a point @ xmath3 is connected to a junction of two circles of points @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 . by rotating the centers of the two circles , we can break the gauge symmetry in order to avoid the interference effects and to obtain the physical properties of our model . the inner and outer layers of the qh liquid are connected to the interaction at points @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 via electron beam coupling . the interaction at the qpcs is known as anti - weak interaction at points @ xmath14 ,@ xmath15 , and @ xmath16 , @ xmath17 , as shown in fig . [ mz ] in two dimensions . the motion of the qh edge is described by the laughlin - type wave function , in fig . ( [ mag ] ) and ( [ w - mag ] ) . we choose the laughlin wave function , in order to take into account the movement of the qh edge induced by the quantum dot , fig . ( [ w - modg ] ) . then the wave function can be used in order to describe a qh edge of arbitrary size . this will allow us to use @ xmath18 and @ xmath19 in order to describe the qpcs . finally , the state of the # ##ity point in the center of the graph is described by the wave function in fig . ( [ w - magn ] ) . it turns out that the wave function of ( [ tun - matr ] ) for the point @ xmath20 , i . e . , the identity element of the multi - dimensional transfer function ( [ tun - mat ] ) , is a real - valued function of @ xmath20 , for a ., @ xmath21 , of quasi - particles in the system . this means that the commonly used formula , @ xcite according to which the quasi - particle enters a ` ` singular flux tube ' ' accompanied by the quasi - particles with an associated phase field , does not apply _ _ _ to mz systems . most importantly , in the presence of a singular magnetic field @ xmath8 , the laughlin wave function ( [ w - magn ] ) has a time - dependent component , which depends _ _ on the distance _ between it and the flux tube . in other words , the ab signal from the magnetic field is determined , respectively , by the distance and by the local properties of the laughlin wave function in relation to the magnetic field . this property is independent of the geometry of the qh system and leads to an exact calculation of the local ab signal from the measurement data ( [ w - mag - n ] ) . thus , we arrive at the very important conclusion that the kerr effect , in its original form , @ xcite does not occur in qh systems . however , in addition to the magnetic reflections produced by the quantum system , as described in ref . ( [ w- modg ] ) , the wave function and , respectively , the wave function have a constant value corresponding to the corresponding change in the applied electric field of the qh liquid and in the plasma . this phenomenon corresponds to fluctuations in the system with non - linear ##ity @ xmath2 . note that this phenomenon , which we want to call _ _ single - particle _ phenomenon _ , does _ particle _ satisfy the byers - wilson equation . in order to apply these observations to the two - dimensional potential energy of the qh liquid , @ xcite we consider the mechanical deformation of the ground state of the mz plasma , as shown in ref . [ def ] , below . the resulting wave function resulting from this deformation , given by ref . ( [ wave - ω ] ) and ( [ wave ] ) , is parameterized by an infinite number of variables , @ xmath22 . we use the classical quantum mechanics @ xcite and apply the rules of ref . [ ] in order to transform the classical hamiltonian onto the basis of these rules . after the transformation , the variables @ xmath22 transform into linear variables , @ xmat##h23 , with the linear ##ity ( [ commut - mic ] ) . these operators represent _ gapless _ plasmon waves on the surface of the qh system . the edge hamiltonian ( [ h - edge ] ) represents the real electrons with a continuous spin and the electronic transition energy , which depends on the number of quasi - electrons , @ xmath21 , and the number of particles , @ xmath24 , in the qh system . the quantum spin operators take the form of tunnel operators ( [ h - edge ] ) . however , we do not find a trace of the ##ian @ xcite in the scattering theory . also , contrary to our results , @ xcite the two hamiltonians at different points in space do not agree with each other ( see also [ app - comm ] ) . we conclude that the high - spin theory we have agrees both with the effective theory of einstein and that of rosen , @ xcite , so as to take into account the large size of the qh system and the presence of a quantum spin and of a quantum magnetic moment . at the end of the effective theory , the measured contribution to the observed phase change of thethree phases , the dynamic , kinematic , and elastic phases described above , acquire the ab phases . @ xcite the ab phase has its origin in the fluctuations of the charge density at the edge described with the derivative of the density function , @ xmath23 . these fluctuations stabilize the ab phase at high temperatures but can be suppressed at low temperatures . the kinematic phase can be interpreted as a state of high energy . in order to understand the ab phase , we assume that the gauge frame in fig . [ ] and [ ] serves as a boundary condition to the classical chern - ##weiler frame @ xcite describing the bulk of the 2deg in the absence of an external magnetic field . in this frame , the ab phase is picked up by the plane wave [ see fig . ( [ 2 - dimensional ] ) ] in the boundary condition . there are two contributions to this wave : one is due to the external field and the singular magnetic flux ; the other contribution is from the charge density at the edge , as a result of the amplitude ##s of the external field . it turns out that these two contributions cancel each other out , and that the excess charge leads to the singular magnetic .2 . in the second case we have , the effect is localized in space and can be interpreted as removal of the _ ##ity of the qh liquid . we decide to call this _ _ _ effect _ , in order to emphasize the importance of the total surface area . having solved the high - dimensional dynamics of the ideal qh liquid , we proceed to model the quasi - particle transport at qpcs and the electron transport at the edges . we use the power law to describe these processes as discrete events that produce the number , @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 , of electrons at the inner and outer edges of the corbino surface and the number , @ xmath27 , of quasi - particles at the inner edge , where @ xmath28 . the dynamics of the mz system on a half - baseline is described by a simple formula for the system to have the electrons in the system equal to the number of @ xmath29 . in order to describe the dynamics , we consider the distribution of the quantum numbers . as a result , the density distribution of the entire system is the limit of two quantum states separated by the electron density ( [ p - s ] ) . thus we havetake the electronic numbers @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 and solve the master equation , with ( [ master - p - qp ] ) and ( [ master - p ] ) , for the density variations in the quasi - particle sector induced by @ xmath27 . finally , using this master equation , we calculate the current in the mz gate as a function of the magnetic flux , thus obtaining the _ _ _ _ of our paper . first , we note that the current varies as a function of the induced magnetic flux with the electronic number @ xmath0 , and these effects are gradually increasing with time and particle size . this means that they can be interpreted as the # ##ic effect . in contrast , as a function of the magnetic flux induced due to the gate , the current varies with the quasi - particle sector @ xmath2 , and these effects occur in the classical regime . thus , the byers - wilson problem is resolved . an important goal of our paper is to model the distribution of the magnetic flux through the holes in the corbino junction of the qh gate . since this model has a classical interpretation , the. . . , does not depend on the nature of the interface between the gate and the hole itself , our experiment simply results in a homogeneous magnetic field . however , the phenomenon of topological screening can be observed , in detail , in an experiment with an mz gate by measuring the area of the hole with a topological screening but not the area of the qh liquid inside the hole , as shown in fig . [ exper1 ] . we assume that , under the application of a constant field , the value of the period as a function of the homogeneous magnetic field does not change , contrary to the usual assumption that the period depends on the surface area of the hole . this is because the flux inside the hole is homogeneous and the ab phase is proportional to the area of the 2deg hole in the vacuum tube . the latter assumption leads us to an important result : for a completely homogeneous system operating in a qh liquid , the topological screening leads to a linear dependence of the ab phase ( observed in free space , as a function of the homogeneous magnetic field ) on the filling factor . this is because by changing the filling factor we can change the area of the qh liquid inside the hole , and ifthe transition modes are smooth . we note that our predictions only apply to the qh system above the @ xmath30 ##0 , where the predictions can be made more easily ( see also the section in sec . [ conseq ] ) . our work is summarized as follows . in sec . [ s - project - func ] we compute the ground state wave function of the mz system in the classical qh system , and consider the case of a singular magnetic flux and of a modulation gate . in sec . [ s - project ] , by projecting the effective hamiltonian and the operators onto the space of dimensions corresponding to the local ##ization of the qh system , we obtain the low - energy description of the mz system . finally , in sec . [ s - project ] , we combine the description derived from our quantum model with the description derived by the classical chern - doherty theory . in sec . [ s - project - of - c ] we use the low - energy effective hamiltonian in order to calculate the charge density of the mz system when subjected to magnetic fields and to calculate the current density in the case of a singular magnetic flux and of a modulation gate .we then determine the nature of this symmetry and perform the calculations to develop our theory in ref . [ conseq ] . finally , in ref [ app - comm ] , we discuss the following relations for the quasi - particle operators and for spin operators , which are essential parts of our theory . in this section we discuss the quasi - particle wave functions of the ground state and of gapless excited states of the mz system . we do this step by step , starting from the laughlin wave function and expanding it , in order to arrive at a mathematical model of the system . we then obtain the most important results and we explain them , in ref . [ app - incompr ] , using the term quantum mechanics . @ xcite the variational wave function , introduced by laughlin in ref . [ ] and later developed by wang and rezayi in ref . [ ] , describes the ideal ##ized ##e , @ xmath31 , of a qh state with @ xmath24 electrons and a nucleus @ xmath3 : @ xmath32 , @ xmath33 denotes the sequence of quantum numbers @ xmath34 denotes the energy of the @ xmath35 electrons , @ .##math36 , and @ xmath37 is the sample number . it is from @ xcite that the wave function ( [ ring ] ) describes a quantum orbit of a qh state of electron density @ xmath38 and of energy @ xmath39 . in the next step , we bring to the ring ( [ ring ] ) a quantum state , @ xmath21 , of laughlin n - state @ xcite at the radius @ xmath40 : @ xmath41 . etc . [ e - incompr ] we also note that the wave function ( [ s - ring ] ) describes a qh state of constant electron density @ xmath42 on the corbino disk , as shown in figure . the central hole of the disk is located at @ xmath40 and at the radius @ xmath43 , and the outer hole of the disk is located by @ xmath44 . we note that the crystal lattice as such is perfectly aligned in plane with the axis of the hole parallel to the lattice plane , for @ xmath45 . we must break the crystal symmetry in order to avoid the effects of gravity and to get closer to a realistic model of the crystal (see fig . [ frol - simpl ] , ( 2 ) . a small scale deformation of the qh - state can be found as follows . we show that the states of the lowest energy state can be represented by holomorphic functions of polar coordinates . we first look for a wave function of the form @ xcite @ xmath46 \ langle \ underbar { omega } \ , | \ , [ \ rangle , \ dot { wave - 1 } \ ] ] where the function @ xmath47 \ dot { omega } \ ] ] is defined on the corbino scale ( as in fig . [ mz ] ) , and @ xmath48 is the sum of states @ xmath22 , @ xmath49 . \ , . [ wave - incompr ] we show that the shape of the unit circle is determined by the solution of a two - dimensional wave equation , with @ xmath50 playing the role of the vector field . we define the wave function ( [ wave - 1 ] ) in two ways . first of all , the resulting states are said to be the gapless states of the qh state . @ x##cite here , in order to study the low - temperature case , we can use the wave functions ( [ s - functions ] ) to map the classical hamiltonian of the mz ##r onto the coordinates corresponding to these coordinates . first , we consider the form the quantum gate takes on one of the edges of the disk . if a constant voltage is applied to such a gate , the 2deg is generated again . \ math . [ s - incompr ] we find that the first form of wave function @ xmath51 \ langle \ underbar { n } \ , | \ , [ \ rangle , \ dot { s - modg } \ ] ] with @ xmath52 , is the local deformation of the corbino disk near the point @ xmath53 , @ xmath54 on the outer edge . this deformation is parameterized by the singular magnetic flux @ xmath8 in the inner edge and the size , @ xmath53 , of the gate . then , by the local deformation of the singular magnetic field @ xmath8 into the gate in the corbino disk near the point @ xmath40 , the wave function is modified by the total[ @ xmath55 $ ] . at the same time , the wave function is replaced by the spectral flow in order to preserve its single - valuedness . this process is described by the spectral flow @ xmath56 . the net effect of the \ ##ity of the wave function can also be described by replacing the original wave function by @ xmath57 it is important to note that the function ( [ w - magn ] ) is single - valued , and thus represents the internal state of the quantum system ( [ w - 1 ] ) . the quantum mechanical analysis @ xcite has proven to be an effective tool in the analysis of qh systems . @ xcite also relies on the simple fact that the evaluation of the laughlin wave function can be interpreted as the partition function of an ensemble of @ xmath24 - particles interacting via the two - dimensional ( 3d ) 3d interaction . in the non - @ xmath24 system the evaluation of the partition function corresponds to computing the two - dimensional 3d interaction . if we apply this analysis directly to the wave function ( [ w - 1 ] ) . we have @ xmath58 where the probability density of the particle ( @xmath4 and the potential is given by the equation : @ xmath59 \ label { 0 } \ label { 1 } \ ] ] using the 2d partition function @ xmath60 , we can also obtain @ xmath61 where @ xmath62 and # ##ization are interpreted as the two terms on the right hand side of fig . ( [ ener ] ) in order to obtain the non - integral term . this result makes it clear , that the partition function ( [ z1 ] ) describes a collection of charged particles interacting via the same surface , that are separated by the external field @ xmath63 . the first term in fig . ( [ extphi ] ) describes the interaction with a neutral or background charge of particle @ xmath64 . the second term can be interpreted as describing the separation from the background charge @ xmath65 by the surface @ xmath40 . finally , the third term describes the effect of the external ( chargeless , since @ xmath66 ) field on the particles in the system . the next step is to replace the integral term z in fig . ( [ z1 ] ) with a new term @ xcitein the interval @ xmath67 : @ xmath68 } . \ { { z2 } \ ] ] using this formula , which can be found in the 1 - @ xmath24 table , @ xcite the solution is obtained . we find that the energy of the plasma is a linear function of the temperature . thus the energy density @ xmath69 is given by the solution of the zero - point problem @ xmath70 , which becomes @ xmath71 the results of this simple solution are the following results . first , it follows that the background energy is in the range where @ xmath72 , i . e . where the 2deg is not completely filled . in other words , the background field is a ` ` free field ' ' that completely covers the background field @ xmath73 . applying the laplacian to ( [ eom - 1 ] ) , we find that @ xmath74 , i . e . , the free field is used only to describe the background field . this means that the energy function ( [ em - 1 ] ) is an integral part of the qh field . in particular ,the wave function ( [ z - 1 ] ) represents the initial ground state of the mz field , shown in figure . however , the same model shows that the hole in the corbino sphere is confined only to the point @ xmath40 , where the background charge @ xmath65 is zero . this fails to describe this hole , so that the action only occurs in the region covered by the 2deg . because of this symmetry , the size of the hole itself is , therefore , independent of the size of the hole and of the choice of boundary conditions for the background charge region ( the first is in fig . ( [ extphi ] ) ) . we can write the solution of the point @ xmath50 perturbatively . let us denote by @ xmath75 the point to which the qh field is confined . we look for the solution of fig . ( [ eom - 1 ] ) in the points @ xmath76 , for @ xmath77 , and @ xmath78 respectively . then we can write fig . ( [ eom - 2 ] ) for @ xmath79 with a slight modification , @ xmath80, and taking into account that the term for the undeformed corbino disk , @ xmath81 , includes the first two terms of fig . ( [ extphi ] ) , we arrive at the result : @ xmath82 in polar coordinates ( see ref . [ def ] ) , the boundary of the magnetic disk can be parameterized by @ xmath83 , where @ xmath84 , and @ xmath85 are the 1d energy levels produced at the inner and outer edges due to the interaction . because of the symmetry of the two - dimensional magnetic disk , we can solve ref . ( [ eom - 2 ] ) , for the potential . using the differential expressions @ xmath86 , for @ xmath87 , and the integral expression ( [ def ] ) for the potential @ xmath50 , we obtain : ( [ eom - 2 ] ) the power law . the result can be expressed in the form of a series : [ wave - def ] @ xmath88 these equations show how the interaction energy function ( [ e - f ] ) determines the boundaries of the rotating corbino disk . thus ,we consider the effects of the modulation gate and of the singular magnetic flux , as shown in fig . [ 2 ] . according to the equation ( [ w - def ] ) , the phenomenon described in the wave equation ( [ w - modg ] ) has the following form : @ xmath89 where @ xmath90 represents the change of the value , @ xmath53 , of the modulation gate . this equation also describes the effects of the modulation gate : the homogeneous expansion of the 2deg at the point @ xmath91 and the homogeneous expansion of the qh ##g due to its expansion . it is important to note that the expansion of the surface area of the modulation gate , @ xmath92 , is exactly proportional to @ xmath8 . in the case of the singular magnetic flux , the wave equation has an additional term @ xmath93 describing the expansion of the disk , which involves the creation of a charge @ xmath94 in the center of the disk at the point @ xmath40 . this charge expands the area of the corbino surface by the amount @ xmath95 , @ xmath84 , @see in ref . [ 1 ] . having obtained the set of operators ( [ 0 - 1 ] ) describing the dynamics of the qh state , we proceed to introduce operators on the basis of the low - energy states when applied to the undeformed steady - state and introduce their corresponding operators . first of all , let us introduce zero - mode expressions for the number of electrons @ xmath24 and quasi - particles @ xmath21 . the two @ xmath96 [ zeromodedef ] operators with different numbers of electrons @ xmath24 are strongly stable , but the operators of wave functions with different numbers of quasi - particles @ xmath21 are strongly stable in the non - @ xmath24 state . @ xcite taking this fact into account , one derives from the system ( [ zeromodedef ] ) the following two expressions for the operator of zero mode @ xcite @ xmath97 = e ^ { i \ phi } , \ ; \ ; [ 0 , e ^ { i \ phi _ n } ] = e ^ { i \ phi _ n } . \ { { zeromodecom } \ ] ] next , we introduce# ##s @ xmath98 , @ xmath84 , for s @ xmath99 , starting from the origin : [ def ] [ defa ] @ xmath100 the states ( [ wave - 1 ] ) are the states under the action of these operators . in order to obtain the relations for these operators , we need to consider the products of the states ( [ wave - 2 ] ) . we start with the norm of the wave function , which is given by the square root of the # ##s of the two operators , ( [ z1 ] ) and ( [ z2 ] ) , and taking the ` ` free term ' ' @ xmath101 with the constant @ xmath50 as the term , we get @ xmath102 where the term @ xmath103 is the difference from the initial term and from the integral of the second term . we replace this equation with the norm of the state ( [ k - def ] ) and write the result in a matrix form of the form @ xmath22 , @ xmath104 \ \ - \ sum _ { 1 \ geq }' > 1 } , ' c _ k ^ { k ' } [ c _ k ^ { { - k ' } z _ k _ { - k ' } + { \ rm ##t . e . } ] , \ label { [ - k } \ end { t } \ ] ] where @ xmath105 is the coefficients . the holomorphic nature of this general ##ization allows us to extend the formula for the norm @ xmath106 to the inner norm @ xmath107 . first , we express the coefficients , via their identity elements , as follows : @ xmath108 . a further calculation then yields : @ xmath109 \ langle n , m , \ underbar { t } \ , | n , m , \ underbar { t } \ , ' \ rangle . \ end { interm } \ end { t } \ ] ] using the ( [ defa ] ) , we can write @ xmath110 . with this result the ( [ interm ] ) we can express the adjoint operators acting on the norm @ xmath111 , via the norm @ xmath22 , and @ xmat##h112 using exactly the same formula for the operators @ xmath113 , we obtain : @ xmath114 with operators ( [ ak ] ) , ( [ ak - ku ] ) and ( [ ak - kd ] ) for the operators @ xmath98 and their adjoints and the operators @ xmath115 = \ delta _ { kk ' } $ ] , we obtain the following relations : @ xmath116 = \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ delta _ { kk ' } \ delta _ { k ' } . \ { { commut - mic } \ ] ] \ , one finds that @ xmath117 = [ a _ { k } , a _ { k ' s ' } ] = [ $ ] . thus the two operators , @ xmath98 and @ xmath118 , contained in ( [ k ] ) have similar deformation ##s , and the product of these operators has a similar fock space structure with respect to these operators . starting from the above equations , we can then model the finite - dimensional field theory of the field . for this model , we havethe microscopic hamiltonian and the potential of anti - holes are the corresponding entries onto the two - dimensional model described above . the sum of these states is given by @ xmath119 , where the density matrix @ xmath120 is defined as : @ xmath121 where the expression @ xmath122 , for the corresponding @ xmath24 region , is given by the expression ( [ z2 ] ) . we can apply the same model in the presence of an external magnetic field . in fig . [ anti - hole ] we first consider systems where a magnetic flux gate is used and a dc dc field is applied . the microscopic hamiltonian for @ xmath24 region , corresponding to the lowest landau level , is given by the expression @ xmath123 where @ xmath124 is the strength of the local external magnetic field and @ xmath125 is the local potential , which allows us to describe the tunnel . note that we have neglected the second energy term , since , depending on the lowest landau level , it has a second term , @ xmath126 , where @ xmath127 is the local potential . the projectionof the projected hamiltonian onto the space of initial states @ xmath128 is given by @ xmath129 where @ xmath130 , and the total energy contribution is @ xmath131 we may consider the wave equation @ xmath132 and ( [ edge - energy ] ) . they can be written in terms of the total energy of the initial state as follows : @ xmath133 for the system - @ xmath24 , and for the long - range initial state we write this energy as @ xmath134 , with the ` ` e ' ' notation . finally , we can write the energy of the system in terms of the total energy of @ xmath135 finally , we need to write the projected hamiltonian ( [ w - matr ] ) in terms of the energy contribution ( [ e ] ) . to this end , we consider the regions of the system ( [ edge - energy ] ) and take into account the fact that the energy is constant , @ xmath76 , for @ xmath77 . writing the energy contribution as @ xmath136 , we canconvert the term ( [ edge - energy - function ] ) into the resulting form @ xmath137 and replace the last term with the value of the term ( [ sol - def ] ) : @ xmath138 . \ label { edge - spect } \ label { ref } \ ] ] where @ xmath139 is the energy of the qh field applied to the undeformed corbino surface , and the other two terms come from the term @ xmath137 . the two energies , @ xmath140 , @ xmath84 , are determined by the two - body problem and for the third term : @ xmath141 . \ label { spectr } \ ] ] using only the holomorphic part of the matrix form ( [ edge - spect ] ) to convert this form to off - diagonal matrix form , we look at the corresponding hamiltonian ( [ sol - matr ] ) in the following form : @ xmath142 we can find that the state @ xmath143 is the state produced by the deformation @ xmath144 . using the edge - energy form , i . e ., for @ xmath145 , the drift rate of ( [ spectr ] ) is approximately given as a function of the mode number : @ xmath146 , where the terms @ xmath147 are the direct sums of the coefficients . the energy of the undeformed edge takes the following form as a function of the number of particles @ xmath24 and the number of non - particles @ xmath21 : @ xmath148 combining the mode number with the wave function @ xmath149 , we arrive at the following expression for the effective hamiltonian @ xmath150 we end this section with the most important result . result ( [ spectr ] ) has two terms : the first term is the drift rate , proportional to the local velocity field , @ xmath151 , and the second term is proportional to the ` ` natural momentum ' ' @ xmath152 the effective drift frequency ( [ velo ] ) is given by two terms in the @ xmath153 - term of the zero - dimensional energy distribution function . in general , result ( [ velo ] ) agrees with the previously mentioned, , and . [ ] is the symmetry of the quantum field theory . the tunnel hamiltonian for the mz theory can be written as the product of the equations on the left and right qpc : @ xmath154 . \ nonumber \ ] ] the tunnel operator is an operator taking a quasi - particle at a point @ xmath155 on one edge and leaving it at a point @ xmath20 on the other edge : @ xmath156 where @ xmath157 and @ xmath158 are quasi - particle states . as for the tunnel hamiltonian , the form of the tunnel operator , @ xmath159 , is given in terms of matrix elements with matrix entries @ xmath160 . these matrix elements can be obtained by adding a finite set of matrix entries : @ xmath161 in other words , we define the tunnel operator as an operator whose matrix elements are composed of wave functions with quasi - particles , at the inner and the outer edges . the wave functions with absorption of a quasi - particle , @ xmath162 are given by the fact that the energy of@ xmath4 quasi - particles at the same point are equivalent to the electrons of an electron . the total energy is given by @ xmath163 , which leads to the expression : @ xmath164 where we use the constant factor , because it cannot be projected into the electromagnetic field . the quasi - particle at the point @ xmath20 is then described by the following wave equation : @ xmath165 expression ( [ qp - def ] ) differs from laughlin ' quasi - particle expression , using a constant factor . we note in the [ app - comm ] that the quasi - particle expression , given by the projection of @ xmath166 expression , ( [ qp - def ] ) onto the three - dimensional space , has all the above properties ( energy , energy and mass ) . in order to obtain the inner product ( [ app - matr ] ) , we can assume that @ xmath167 , as in the previous expression , and then apply our formula . the expression @ xmath168 $ . . ( [ qp - def ] ) can be written [ @ xmath169 $ ] . ., expanding the matrix into a series on the outer edge , @ xmath170 , and on the inner edge , @ xmath171 , we arrive at the following formula for the matrix s ( [ x - matr ] ) : @ xmath172 \ \ \ , \ int \ xi _ i ^ 2z _ i ( z ^ * _ i - z ^ * _ 0 ) \ exp \ left \ { - \ xi _ { k > 0 } \ left [ \ frac { z _ i ^ * } { { \ xi ^ * } + \ frac { ( \ xi ^ * - z ^ * _ 0 ) ^ k } { [ ( z ^ * _ i - z ^ * _ 0 ) ^ k } \ , ] \ , \ } \ langle n , m , \ underbar { t } \ , | \ underbar { t } \ , \ rangle \ langle \ underbar { t } \ , | n , m ' , \ underbar { t } \ , \ rangle . \ , { hren } \ , { t } \ ] ] . we have assumed for simplicity that the edges are orthogonal to each other andwe defined @ xmath173 . taking into account that @ xmath174 and @ xmath175 , we take out of the above the following series : @ xmath176 . now we use the series that @ xmath177 to define the matrix ( [ hren ] ) in the following way : @ xmath178 \ \ \ , \ exp \ , \ { - \ xi _ { k > 0 } \ , [ \ frac { 1 } { - \ xi ^ * } \ frac { \ partial } { \ partial z _ 1 } + \ frac { ( \ xi ^ * - z _ k ^ * ) ^ * } { 1 } \ frac { \ partial } { \ partial z _ { - 1 } ^ * } \ right ] \ { \ } \ langle \ , m + 1 , \ underbar { t } \ , | \ , m ' , \ underbar { t } \ , \ rangle . \ { { hren - 1 } \ { { 1 } \ ] ] we can now see that the identity matrix ( [ hren - 1 ] ) exists unless @ xmath179 . therefore ,in dimension ( [ el - space ] ) for the definition of the operator @ xmath180 and dimension ( [ space ] ) , we can express the definition of the diffusion operator ( [ el - en ] ) in terms of the diffusion operator as follows : @ xmath181 , \ label { anti - diffusion } \ ] ] where all the local growth operators are combined into a prefactor @ xmath182 , and we have used the following formula : [ bsefield ] @ xmath183 , \ ] ] @ xmath184 . \ ] ] to complete our analysis of the high - temperature state of the system we can consider the change of the direction of electron flow from the quantum dot junctions to the tunnel junctions . this can be done by applying the formula described above to the electron diffusion operator ( [ el - def ] ) . the result of the analysis is given by @ xmath185 \ \ \ , \ exp \ { [ i \ xi _ u + m \ ln \ xi _ u + i \ ln ( \ xi _ u - m _ n ) \ } ] \ label { elec -1 } \ end { gathered } \ ] ] for travel from the outer edge to the inner edge . ( see ref . [ mz ] for details ) , and the arrival time at the inner edge is given by @ xmath186 \ \ \ to \ exp \ to [ m \ xi _ 0 + im \ , + i \ ln ( \ theta _ 0 - u _ 0 ) \ \ ] , \ times { elec - 1 } \ end { gathered } \ ] ] to see this , we note that we can obtain the corresponding probability density functions for the edges of the qh domain , @ xmath187 and @ xmath188 , by expressing the expression ( [ alpha - def ] ) above in terms of the expression ( [ mic ] ) : @ xmath189 [ alpha - edge - mic ] . the two terms describe the energy change induced by the exchange of quantum states @ xmath21 and @ xmath24 . expressions ( [ alpha - edge - mic ] ) lead to the following result : @ xmath190 = \ times \ frac { 1 } { z _ 1 } \ to ( \ alpha -\ phi _ ( ) { \ cal ##c } ( \ phi ) , \ ] ] where the operators @ xmath191 and @ xmath192 parametrize the position of the reference point in terms of the inner and outer edges . these two operators check that the tunnel operator ( [ h - tunnel ] ) creates a series of light - like waves of length @ xmath193 . similarly , we can check that the operators ( [ elec - c ] ) and ( [ elec - mic ] ) create a continuous wave at the outer edge . let ( [ h - tunnel ] - [ h - c - mic ] ) be the original formulation ( see also : [ app - comm ] ) . the resulting low - energy system agrees completely with the original formulation of above . [ ] and [ ] . having obtained a self - consistent model for the transfer of observables onto low - energy systems , we can consider the properties of the tunnel hamiltonian and of the tunnel operator in the situation where the magnetic flux is varied in the tunnel . similarly , we consider the situation where the flux is varied by means of a variable transfer function . the transfer function of the interfer##ometer . this state is given by fig . ( [ w - modg ] ) , and the arc length of this state is given by fig . ( [ wave - f ] ) . according to fig . ( [ wave - f ] ) , we obtain representations of the initial state ( [ w - modg ] ) as follows : @ xmath194 \ langle \ underbar { z } \ , | \ , [ \ rangle , \ label { w - def - f } \ end { z } \ ] ] where @ xmath52 describes the local ##ization of the corbino curve at the point @ xmath53 , @ xmath54 describes the left side . the inner product of these representations can be obtained from fig . ( [ w - f ] ) . they are given by the following formula : @ xmath195 , \ label { free - gate } \ end { z } \ ] ] where @ xmath196 , for @ xmath99 , and @ xmath197 , for @ xmath198 . from the formula ( [ free - gate ] ) , one sees that the set of differential operators ( [ com##mut - mic ] ) does not change after the application of a gate voltage . first , we find that the initial state of the state ( [ sol - def - mic ] ) agrees with the state ( [ sol - def ] ) , but with @ xmath22 replaced by @ xmath199 . this does not change the sum of the effects , which is still constant in the state @ xmath22 . thus , the total effect of the quantum effects on the system hamiltonian , up to two dimensions , is given by : @ xmath200 we can then calculate the value of the tunnel operators by applying the operator @ xmath201 to state ( [ h - gate ] ) , which is @ xmath202 \ \ \ xi \ exp \ , [ - i \ phi + d \ ln \ phi + d \ varphi _ u ( \ xi ) - i \ varphi ^ \ * _ u ( \ xi ^ * - i ^ * _ u ) \ xi ] . \ { { h - gate } \ { { \ } \ ] ] finally , we find that , after the application of a gate voltage , the tunnel operators @ xmath##203 at the left qpc and @ xmath204 at the right qpc have a value [ @ xmath205 $ ] corresponding to the current @ xmath8 in the region of 2deg generated by the quantum dot . using the above definition of the current @ xmath206 , we arrive at the following result : @ xmath207 where @ xmath208 is the length of the long axis of the field ( see fig . [ a - b ] ) . we also show in sec . [ s - sp ] that only the linear component @ xmath209 of this field is zero mode , and the time - dependent transformation carries out with the zero - mode component . the situation where the field is generated via the insertion of a singular flux , is described by the wave equation ( [ s - magn ] ) . in sec . [ s - incompr ] we have shown that the insertion of a singular flux is analogous to the insertion of a point - like particle ( in classical particle physics ) and that it leads to a phase transformation of the field . similarly , we obtain the classical particle hamiltonian by replacing @ xmath21 with @ xmath21##0 ( to take into account the orientation of the gate ) , which yields @ xmath211 the wave functions of the two operators in the case of a single flux @ xmath8 differ from ( [ s - effective ] ) only by the expression @ xmath212 . thus the tunnel equation can be derived with the help of the same formula as in sec . [ s - effective ] , which yields an expression that differs from sec . ( [ s - effective ] ) only by a single prefactor : @ xmath213 \ begin { h - w - 1 } \ end { w } \ ] ] we show that , in contrast to the case where a singular value is used , the two operators in the qpcs do not change their respective values due to the expression ##ity . this is interpreted as an exact combination of the phase shift caused by the gate itself and the phase shift caused by energy transfer through the gate . in sec . [ s - effective ] , we show that this interpretation is true , i . e . , it does not depend on the characteristic wave function ( [ h - 1 ] ) of the gate . in this case we show that the first - order tunnel operator, which , in the previous section , from the classical wave equation ( [ h - 1 ] ) , can be solved in a completely gauge - invariant way . in order to do this , we start from the classical chern - simon equation @ xcite in the case of a qh liquid and apply a wave equation such that the internal energy is conserved and gauge invariant . then we show that the gauge - invariant molecular hamiltonian corresponds with the one derived from particle physics , from fig . ( [ x - tunnel ] ) , and the equations coincide with those derived from fig . ( [ h - 1 ] ) . finally , we show that the effect of the wave equation on the system ##ity is a gauge - invariant phenomenon , described by the description of the electron state by the chern - simon theory . we start by using the definition of the initial zero - temperature state of an infinitely cold qh liquid with temperature , @ xmath3 . such a state is characterized by a net current , @ xmath214 . the wave equation , @ xmath215 , is derived by solving : @ xmath216 , @ xmath217 , and here , we have : where @xmath218 , and follows the usual interaction formula , unless specified otherwise . the potential is invariant under the gauge transformation @ xmath219 . by two dimensions , it is easy to see that the energy - term for the interaction @ xmath220 given by @ xmath221 = \ frac { m } { 2 \ lambda } \ int d ^ 3r \ epsilon ^ { \ mu \ nu \ lambda } a _ \ nu \ epsilon _ \ nu a _ \ nu \ nu { x - y } \ ] ] has one dimension , and all other interaction terms have _ upper _ dimension , i . e . , have _ lower _ for two dimensions and short time scales . for example , the wave - function f has dimension @ xmath222 . similarly , the interaction with an external magnetic field , described by the magnetic interaction @ xmath223 , is given by the equation : @ xmath224 = \ int d ^ 3r a _ \ nu d ^ \ lambda = \ frac { m } { 2 \ lambda } \ int d ^ 3r a _ \ nu \ epsilon ^ { \ nu \ nu \ lambda } \ epsilon _ \ nu a _ { \\ } . \ nonumber \ { { \ } \ ] ] working with the term @ xmath225 , we arrive at the effective action for the electromagnetic field in the chern - doherty distribution : @ xmath226 = \ frac { 1 } { 4 \ pi m } \ int d ^ 3r \ epsilon ^ { \ mu \ lambda \ lambda } a _ \ lambda \ lambda _ \ delta a _ \ } . \ nonumber \ ] ] the net action @ xmath227 / \ delta a _ \ lambda $ ] is then given by let ' s : @ xmath228 where @ xmath229 is the bulk current . thus , we find that , for an infinitely dense liquid , the term ( [ q - resistance ] ) exactly describes the qh liquid , @ xmath3 . similarly , in the case where the qh liquid is confined to a small volume @ xmath75 , the effective action for the qh is in the presence of an external electromagnetic field , @ xmath230 = \ frac { 1 } { 4 \ pi m } \ int _ { 1 } d ^ 3r \ epsilon ^ { \ mu \ lambda \\ } \ big [ 2a _ \ lambda + 3 _ \ lambda \ alpha ] \ partial _ \ nu b _ \ lambda , \ big { s - bulk } \ ] ] under a gauge transformation . @ xcite ##s , one first knows that , under the gauge transformation @ xmath231 , @ xmath232 , the product ( [ s - bulk ] ) is [ @ xmath233 \ to s [ a , b ] + \ to s [ a , b ] $ ] with : @ xmath234 = \ frac { 1 } { 4 \ pi } \ int _ { 1 } d ^ 3r \ epsilon ^ { \ mu \ nu \ alpha } \ left [ 2 \ partial _ \ nu \ alpha + m \ partial _ \ mu \ nu \ lambda ] \ partial _ \ nu b _ \ lambda \ \ = \ frac { 1 } { 4 \ pi } \ int _ { \ mu \ } d ^ 2r [ 2 \ alpha + m \ big ] \ epsilon ^ { \ nu \ alpha } \ partial _ \ nu b _ \ lambda \ pi { anomal } \ pi { \ } \ ] ] where @ xmath235 is thetransform of the magnetic field @ xmath220 to the field @ xmath236 . a possible explanation for the gauge anomaly is the fact that in a qh field confined to a compact sample the magnetic field effect ( [ x - h ] ) is not present . therefore , the net field will vanish at the surface of the liquid . in order to understand the gauge anomaly of the magnetic field , we take into account the local degrees of freedom . it is easy to see that the edge action @ xmath237 = \ frac { 1 } { 2 \ phi } \ int _ { \ partial _ } f ^ 2r [ d _ x \ , d _ y \ , - 1 ( d _ x \ nu ) + \ mu ^ { \ nu \ nu } d _ \ , \ partial _ \ nu \ nu ] , \ begin { x - edge1 } \ begin { x } \ ] ] which is similar to the one used in physics . [ ] from the definition of the dynamics of a charged particle , is the gauge anomaly ( [ anomal ] ) , and one knows that the edge action @ xmath238 transforms to @ xmath239 andthe second derivative is given by the action @ xmath240 note that the following expressions for the field @ xmath241 are given by the first term of the total action ( [ x - edge1 ] ) : @ xmath242 = \ frac { [ \ dots \ } { x } \ left ( x - 1 ) . \ dots { commut - 1 } \ ] ] similarly , the effective formulation of the effective hamiltonian field @ xmath243 is also determined by the edge field . the only difference is that the hamiltonian field should be a constant real function of @ xmath244 . the second effective formulation @ xmath245 , used in the presence of the boundary fields , leads to the chiral edge theory with a simple power law . similarly , the expression for the energy density at the boundary of the qh boundary can be obtained by taking the action @ xmath246 of the total action with respect to the boundary field . the expression is : @ xmath247 note that , when working with the field @ xmath216 , the expression given above leads , for a simple reason , to the edge theory thathas been studied in detail . having constructed a gauge invariant one - dimensional model for an effective qh field , we want to study the nature of the action . the type ( [ op - bulk ] ) arises in the context of a quantum field theory , where particles are described by wilson lines . @ xcite for example , a single spin particle at the point @ xmath248 can be written as : @ xmath249 where @ xmath250 is the point . the statistical phase of spin particles of the type ( [ op - bulk ] ) is obtained by combining the two wilson lines . @ xcite for the types described by @ xmath251 and @ xmath252 , one arrives , after a long process of analysis , at the following expression for the statistical phase : @ xmath253 . similarly , if one takes the action field as an operator on a space - time basis @ xmath254 , then the action of the type ( [ op - bulk ] ) is given by @ xmath255 . the above expressions for the statistical phase and the charge show that the action ( [ op- 1 ] ) with @ xmath256 having the quantum numbers of an electron , and for @ xmath257 , ( [ op - 1 ] ) this operator has the quantum number of a laughlin quasi - hole . the operator that connects a laughlin quasi - hole at the point @ xmath20 and a laughlin quasi - hole at the point @ xmath155 takes the form of a closed loop of these states : @ xmath258 note , however , that this operator is not gauge invariant . due to the standard theory of gauge theory , fig . ( [ gaugetransform ] ) , the _ gauge - invariant _ operator of is given two possible states , given by the expression @ xmath259 and @ xmath260 respectively , @ xcite can be written ( @ xmath261 \ } ) { ^ { - ( \ int _ { ( 1 ) } , \ int { 1 - ef } \ ] ] where the 1d and 2d states are given via the expressions @ xmath262 for the outer edge and @ xmath263 for the inner edge of the mz state ; ( see ref . [ [- f ] ) . the tunnel case ( [ tun - ef ] ) is a set of possible values of the current @ xmath264 at the surface , which can be determined by comparison of the coefficients of this operator with the normal transfer function ( [ tun - f ] ) with the coefficients of etc . ( [ commut - f ] ) . to compare the tunnel case ( [ tun - ef ] ) with the normal case , etc . ( [ tun - f ] ) , we must note that , since the current term is constant , we can use @ xmath265 and solve the straight line equation for etc . ( [ tun - ef ] ) . thus , we obtain the # ##ized expression for the current : @ xmath266 , @ xmath84 : [ tun - f ] @ xmath267 , \ \ \ ! \ ! \ ! , \ ! \ r _ u ( k ) = \ frac { k + 1 } { r _ u } + \ pi _ { k > 1 } \ sqrt { \ frac { k } { r _ u } } [ r _ { ku } .^ { ikx } + { \ rm ##t . e . } \ , ] , \ label { x } \ ] ] where the sum is over the basis functions @ xmath268 . then the operators @ xmath98 and @ xmath269 satisfy the canonical equivalence relation ( [ commut - mic ] ) . this means that the canonical equivalence ( [ commut - mic ] ) is true , when zero modes are taken into account . therefore , the generalized hamiltonian @ xmath270 , \ label { h - h - edge } \ ] ] , in terms of the fields @ xmath98 and @ xmath269 , agrees with the above generalized hamiltonian ( [ h - edge ] ) . therefore , in this paper and also in this article , the operators @ xmath271 also have zero - mode contributions . @ xcite in order to understand these contributions we need to consider the ground state of the field @ xmath216 as the origin for a state with different numbers of zero modes @ xmath21 and @ xmath24 . this state is the ground state of the qh field in the vacuumand this gives the field @ xmath272 . then , for a given k , one takes the background charge from the chern - teller equation and gives @ xmath273 . however , in the special case of the corbino disk , , the field @ xmath274 varies , depending on the fields @ xmath21 and @ xmath24 . we derive the law by taking into account the variation in the background charge @ xmath42 caused by the variation of the quantum numbers @ xmath21 and @ xmath24 . to this end , we find that the field @ xmath275 can be described as a ` ` quantum field ' ' that follows the relation with the background charge of @ xmath42 . the variation of the field @ xmath21 leads to the curvature of the boundary of the corbino disk , and to the definition of the background charge @ xmath276 as the product of two quantum fields . for the outer boundary , we find that @ xmath277 on the inner edge and @ xmath278 \ { { non - negative } \ ] ] on the outer edge . we find thethe ( [ u - solution ] ) , the equation ##ized ##e ( [ tun - a ] ) , and the relationship ( [ tun - a ] ) relate the energy levels and edge fields to arrive at the following : [ tun - a ] @ xmath279 / \ sqrt { k _ d } , \ end { x } \ ] ] @ xmath280 / \ sqrt { k _ d } , \ end { x } \ ] ] which should be similar to above . ( [ bsefield ] ) . we show that the diffusion operator ( [ u - ef ] ) , in the presence of an external edge field @ xmath223 , agrees with the diffusion operator ( [ u - solution ] ) if one considers @ xmath265 . it is important to note that the contributions of zero modes to the edge fields are not limited to the internal geometry of the mz surface . therefore , the phase shift of the wave ##front produced by the zero modes @ xmath21 is not uniform at the outer edge , at @ xmath45 . in this way we see that the phases of a particle ##ity and of a wave are different at2 . [ 1 - t ] can be expressed in terms of the time - dependent two - dimensional effective theory . we start from the situation where the modulation gate mechanism is used in order to create the outer edge of the mz region . this process can be described at the beginning of the effective theory by adding a constraint to the hamiltonian , that describes the behavior of the potential @ xmath281 created by the modulation gate with charge density centered at the point . first , the kinetic hamiltonian of the outer edge is given by the constraint : @ xmath282 . \ nonumber \ ] ] . we obtain the steady - state expectation value of the charge density by replacing the hamiltonian with the potential @ xmath283 . for the region where the gate is created at the point @ xmath284 , we write the potential as @ xmath285 . the expectation value of the potential is then given by @ xmath286 . \ nonumber \ ] ] the potential @ xmath287 can be expressed in terms of the potential @ xmath8 in the region created by the gate , @ xmath288 , so that the expression for the total energyindependent of the charge @ xmath289 . \ label { h - gate } \ ] ] next , we calculate the current current at the gate edge by adding the vacuum contribution ( [ h - gate ] ) : @ xmath290 . as a result , the edge hamiltonian ( [ ham - gate - edge ] ) gives the following equation : @ xmath291 . \ label { ham - gate - edge } \ ] ] putting into this equation the expression ##ized ##or ( [ ham - gate ] ) , we arrive at the gate ( [ ham - gate ] ) with the vacuum contribution @ xmath139 given by : . ( [ ham - gate ] ) , in perfect agreement with the standard model . next , we consider the effect of the ab operator on the gate operators ( [ ham - ef ] ) . we will show in the next section that , to first approximation of the edge hamiltonian , the vacuum contribution to the gate is given by the product of two ab operators operating at different qpcs . however , such a product value of the two operators has a special meaning . we express this expression in terms of the two operators##sities with the result of fig . ( [ x - u ] ) : @ xmath292 \ big ) \ \ \ , \ exp \ , ( - ) \ , ( \ int _ { x _ u } ^ { x _ d } dx [ \ int _ u ( x ) + \ int _ d ( x ) ] \ , ) . \ end { two - tun } \ , { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath293 is the modulation frequency , @ xmath294 , @ xmath295 are points of the qpcs , and the range of operators varies with the range of the detector ( see fig . [ a - b ] ) . then , as shown above , we calculate the total signal range ( [ two - tun ] ) , due to the interaction with the gate field . the range ( [ two - tun ] ) of the operators also has a phase of @ xmath296 . using the above expression for @ xmath297 in the case where the detector is located at the point @ xmath284 of the qpcs , we arrive at the result ( [ x- phas ] ) . thus , we conclude that equations based on the gauge - invariant gauge theory must agree with the physical properties of the boundary surface . it proceeds to consider the absence of a local electric field . to this end , we integrate the flux ( [ e - edge1 ] ) with respect to the charge distribution in the absence of an external electric field . this leads to the following equations of motion : @ xmath298 where @ xmath84 , and @ xmath299 are the direction of the electric field along the edge of the edge . it follows from this equation that , in particular , @ xmath300 , and for @ xmath301 , the electric charges are approximately equally distributed along the edge : @ xmath302 . finally , integrating e . ( [ eom - 1 ] ) over the interval @ xmath303 and separating the equation for the inner edge ( @ xmath304 ) from the equation for the outer edge ( @ xmath305 ) , we arrive at the following equation : @ xmath306 where @ xmath8 is the flux along the edge . thus we have and .. . and in quantum mechanics . first , we note that , after the initial insertion of the singular flux , the quantum state @ xmath21 is transformed to @ xmath307 . this , in turn , leads to an effective hamiltonian of the form : @ xmath308 ^ { . \ nonumber \ ] ] using again the expression ##ized ##o ( [ phi - a ] ) , we arrive at the hamiltonian ( [ phi - a ] ) , with the tunnel energy @ xmath139 given by . . ( [ e0 ] ) , in accordance with the standard model . finally , we can see from the expression ( [ phi - a ] ) that the tunnel energy ( [ phi - ef ] ) for @ xmath309 does not depend on @ xmath21 . indeed , it does not change after the insertion of the singular flux . this result can be interpreted as the effective product of two contributions to the equation of state ( [ phi - edge ] ) . the first contribution comes from the cross - coupling [ @ xmath310 $ ] of the gauge field in the field of @ xmath293 upon insertion of the singular flux . the second contribution[ proportional to the flux @ xmath311 $ ] , along the edge of the magnet . formally , this means that the phase shift of the electric current along the magnetic field @ xmath293 caused only by the change of the surface charge @ xmath223 is replaced by the phase shift induced by the topological transformation of the qh field . this property of _ topological _ reconstruction is the consequence , at the field - dependent level , of the fact that with the removal of the _ ##ity the topological wave function ( [ x - magn ] ) undergoes a transformation in order to preserve its real - valuedness . we have shown also that the ab effect , in its simplest form , does not exist in qh fields , because the ab effects do not depend on the external magnetic field or the corbino field . this , however , does not imply that the current through the magnet is independent of the field . in this way we see that ab acts as a function of @ xmath8 with the magnetic flux @ xmath0 , in accordance with the byers - wilson theorem . these effects result from the magnetic field .and they vanish in the classical limit @ xcite and in the limit of strong coupling to the contacts . in fact , measurements of the current as a function of the change of voltage come from quantum mechanics . thus they do not vanish in the classical limit . we consider an mz junction , strongly coupled to the contacts , with weak quasi - particle holes at inner and outer edges ( see ref . [ 2 ] ) . the strong coupling of electrons to the contacts means that the inner and outer hole states are in equilibrium with the electron states , with corresponding electro - mechanical states @ xmath312 and @ xmath313 . the current difference between the contacts , arising as a solution to the problem of @ xmath314 , is due to weak quasi - particle holes in the qpcs . it is therefore necessary to introduce a second term for the current . we denote by @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 the number of electrons on the outer and inner edges of the contacts , respectively . the number of quasi - particles present on the inner edge is denoted by @ xmath315 : @ xmath316the two quantum numbers , @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 , change due to interactions between the two contacts . the quantum number @ xmath27 changes to @ xmath317 when a quasi - particle moves from one edge to the other edge , as shown in figure . [ 2 ] . without loss of information , we take the tunnel energy to be zero , and obtain the master equation for the probability distribution function . quantum coupling presents itself in terms of the quasi - particle tunnel operators as fluctuations of the electric field @ xmath8 . these fluctuations result from the decay of the weak quasi - particle tunnel operators in the left and right qpc . however , these fluctuations result from the @ xmath8 - like phase changes of the tunnel operators . in this way we obtain the master equation that describes the quasi - particle tunnel , and we calculate the decay rate using the master equations given above . the quantum coupling to the contacts means that , in the case of quasi - particle tunnel , the contact states converge to the edge states described by the probability distribution function @ xmath318 where @ xmath319 .the energy is , @ xmath320 is the surface energy of the @ xmath321 edge contacts , and @ xmath322 is the correlation function . the energy @ xmath323 depends on the number @ xmath27 of quasi - particles via the boundary - layer potential @ xmath324 , given by : . ( [ ener - 1 ] ) . however , one does not need to know the exact mechanism of coupling to the edge contacts , because the main purpose of this coupling is to connect the edge contacts . @ xcite to first step of quasi - particle tunnel , the probability distribution function of the energy can be written as @ xmath325 where @ xmath326 is the probability to find the system in a state with @ xmath27 quasi - particles , and @ xmath323 plays the role of the probability distribution to find the system in a state with @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 located at the interface , for a given number @ xmath27 of quasi - particles . considering quasi - particle tunnel as a random process that increases the number @ xmath27 , we havecompare this with the balance equation @ xmath327 where @ xmath328 and @ xmath329 are the rates of transition from the state with @ xmath27 quasi - particles to the state with @ xmath330 and @ xmath331 quasi - particles , respectively . these rates are given by the equation : @ xmath332 where @ xmath333 are the rates of quasi - particle transition between two states with equal numbers of particles , @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 . at time scales much smaller than the average number of particles , the system enters a steady state state with @ xmath334 . it is easy to see that in this case the conserved quantity is that of @ xmath27 @ xmath335 this quantity is in fact the probability density that we are looking for . this follows from the equations for the system @ xmath336 and from the corresponding equilibrium equation , @ xmath337 , which can be solved by the equations ( [ e - fact ] ) and ( [ e - fact ] ) . note that the above balance equation @ xmath338 is unstable .if @ xmath339 . then , the mz ##r in a non - equilibrium steady - state state is an interesting example of a system with a positive temperature . we set the reaction rate @ xmath333 to first order and the corresponding hamiltonian @ xmath340 , where @ xmath341 . a further calculation , based on the operator ##on ##d , yields the following expression : @ xmath342 and a similar expression for @ xmath343 . then the operator @ xmath344 maps onto lines with different frequencies @ xmath345 and @ xmath27 , and the function @ xmath346 is the probability density function for the system . next , we take two more steps , the details of which can be found in ref . [ ] and [ ] . we obtain the equations of motion for the two lines @ xmath347 , @ xmath295 , by considering the relationship of the operator ( [ x - edge ] ) with the hamiltonian ( [ h - edge ] ) , and use these equations in order to determine the time evolution of @ xmath348 . as athus , we arrive at the following expression for the tunnel rate in the form of a combination of the coherent and coherent terms : @ xmath349 , \ end { tun - rates - 2 } \ end { \ } \ ] ] . @ xmath350 is the energy difference between the state with @ xmath351 quasi - particles and the quantum state with @ xmath27 quasi - particles , and the values @ xmath352 ^ { 1 / 2 } $ ] , @ xmath353 , are the energy correlation coefficients of the quantum system . we assume that @ xmath354 is the total number of particles in the corbino system , and @ xmath14 and @ xmath16 are the spatial dimensions of the qpcs . note that the electron flux determines the tunnel rate ( [ tun - rates - 2 ] ) , in turn , via the value of @ xmath355 . in the following two equations we need and . ( [ e - 1 ] ) and ( [ e0 ] ) for the expression @ xmath139 in order to understand the # ##es of the tunnel rates in different directions .in the case where the energy of the electron is measured with the help of amplitude ##s , we use fig . ( [ tun - rates ] ) to calculate the energy difference between the tunnel and initial states : @ xmath356 in this case , the observed time evolution is related to the tunnel rates @ xmath357 and @ xmath358 by the poles and the qpcs , which give a second expression @ xmath359 [ @ fig . ( [ tun - phas ] ) , which , for convenience , we write as : @ xmath360 $ ] . this then becomes the first term of the state equation ( [ tun - rates - 1 ] ) . finally , we see that in the second case @ xcite the sum of the initial states in fig . ( [ tun - rates - 2 ] ) and that the expression for the wave function @ xmath322 can be well divided by the sum , so that we arrive at the result @ xmath361 it is possible to swap the state equations : @ xmath362 and @ xmath363 . the consequences of this result are the following results :first of all , the integral of the energy is , @ xmath364 , where @ xmath353 . second , the energy of is independent of the number @ xmath27 and of the phase : @ xmath365 . finally , the second term of @ xmath366 has the general form , @ xmath367 , because the time - dependent contribution cancel out with the contribution from the number @ xmath368 is the constant coefficient of the integral ( [ tun - rates - 1 ] ) . using the above expressions for @ xmath139 , @ xmath355 , and @ xmath359 , we see that the integral ( [ tun - rates ] ) is consistent with the zero ##es ##p , in the upper limit , at @ xmath369 translating this expression into and . ( [ rates - 1 ] ) , we get the following expression for the rates : @ xmath370 , \ label { tun - rates - 1 } \ label { t } \ ] ] with @ xmath354 as the first term followed by @ xmath371 this follows from thes ( [ tun - rates ] ) . first , we arrive at the following general result : the rates do not depend on @ xmath27 , @ xmath372 . this means , according to ref . ( [ curr - 1 ] ) , that the current is proportional to @ xmath373 ) , i . e . , it agrees with the expression for the current given in ref . [ ] . we therefore do not use the expression ##s ( [ tun - rates - 3 ] ) and direct the integral to [ ] , where the integral has been thoroughly studied in the linear and non - linear forms . second , we note that the rates ( [ tun - rates - 3 ] ) depend on the electron flux . thus we see , that the tunnel effect is in the quantum equilibrium if the flux is changed with the application of a modulation gate . we can see that the effect has the _ single - electron _ property . this expression does _ not _ violate the byers - wilson theorem , because the changes in the flux caused by the application of a modulation gate can easily be explained by . third , we note that the rates ( [ tun - rates - 3 ] ) depend on .on the system , @ xmath374 , and then on @ xmath312 and @ xmath313 respectively , via the total number of electrons in the system , @ xmath375 , which is given the term ( [ totaln ] ) . this seems to violate the gauge symmetry . in fact , this is not the case , because we assume , for example , that the field strength is controlled by a additional metallic gate , and that the inner and outer layers of the corbino layer do not interact . this assumption is used in a number of experimental experiments , e . g . , in nature . the additional metallic gate plays the role of the positive gate , which also controls the number of electrons in the system . the currents @ xmath312 and @ xmath313 are not screened with respect to this gate . we have to note that the amount of screening depends on details of the experimental data . we note , however , that these details do not affect the validity of our hypothesis about the existence of the ab ##r . if we assume that , in the case where the current in the system is controlled by using a ab ##ity function , thethe dependence of the flux is zero . in this case the energy difference between the states with @ xmath376 and @ xmath27 ##5 - zero is given by @ xmath377 . \ ] ] we can then return to the classical case and divide the sum over @ xmath345 as an integral to arrive at the ( [ tun - rates ] ) . it is also easy to see that , in the classical case , with two variables , @ xmath378 , the flux is independent of the variables @ xmath8 . this is because , again , the magnetic flux reaches the tunnel state ( [ tun - rates - flux ] ) , via the interaction of two variables , @ xmath139 , in contrast to the case where the flux is determined with the help of a differential operator . we know that there is an external field associated with the magnetic flux , and in order to determine the energy difference of the tunnel state we need to take into account fields that are not in the classical case . to this end , we have an integral @ xcite that allows to take the sum over the fields as an integral , @ xmath379consider the figure shown as a straight line in fig . [ pol ] . using this expression and using the shift of variables @ xmath380 , we arrive at the following expression for transition rates : @ xmath381 where we have chosen the variables , and @ xmath333 are the transition rates ( [ transition - rate - 1 ] ) . we find that using the shift of variables shown above , the transition rates @ xmath333 are chosen _ _ _ to depend on the flux @ xmath27 and the flux @ xmath8 . next , we take the values of the flux @ xmath382 as functions of the flux @ xmath26 and @ xmath25 to move the entire term of ( [ integr - 2 ] ) to the same term , @ xmath383 , as shown in fig . [ pol ] . assuming that @ xmath384 is constant , we remove the flux from the term ( [ integr - 2 ] ) and introduce the term e : @ xmath385 . \ nonumber \ { { e } \ ] ] turns this expression into .##q . ( [ integr - 1 ] ) , we see that the first term is our previous expression for the second order term to the thermal limit . for the second , third - order , term , the saddle point is not far from the z axis : @ xmath386 because @ xmath387 . this is the sum of the coefficients to the thermal limit . using the saddle point expression of @ xmath345 we arrive at the following expression for the reaction rate ( [ tun - rates ] ) : @ xmath388 \ \ \ , \ exp \ to [ t \ , ] \ left ( \ frac { \ phi _ 0 ##n _ t } { n _ t } + \ frac { 1 } { 1 } - \ frac { \ phi } { ( \ phi _ 0 } \ , ) \ , ] , \ left { tun - rates - 4 } \ to { 1 } \ ] ] where the first term , @ xmath389 , is the coefficient ( [ tun - rates - 4 ] ) of , @ xmath390 , and the coefficient @ xmath391 of @ x##math312 and @ xmath313 are related by expressions similar to those in fig . ( [ tun - rates - 4 ] ) . these expressions , the exact meaning of which is not known , are independent of @ xmath27 . as mentioned , the transition rates ( [ tun - rates - 4 ] ) have large variations in @ xmath8 that are not increasing in the classical case . @ xcite these variations can be interpreted as arising from the flux quantum effect . however , we know that the current follows the transition rate ( [ tun - rates - 4 ] ) , in the direction @ xmath392 . the loss of the current @ xmath8 by the classical shift @ xmath0 can be partially replaced by the shift @ xmath393 . the non - classical solution is given by : ( [ curr - 1 ] ) , where the equations in fig . ( [ conserv ] ) with the replacement @ xmath394 . all these equations are valid in @ xmath27 with period equal to @ xmath4 and not under the shift @ xmath395. this means that the average rate is the electronic frequency , @ xmath396 , in accordance with the byers - yang theorem . for example , the combination of equation . ( [ conserv ] ) and ( [ curr - 1 ] ) for @ xmath397 gives the average rate @ xmath398 which is a linear combination of @ xmath8 with the electronic frequency @ xmath0 . at the same time , the average rate @ xmath399 has a quasi - particle effect . thus , the quasi - particle effect with respect to the term ##ity can in fact be determined via , e . g . , the quantum hall effect at higher frequencies . the above statement does not imply the byers - yang theorem , because this statement applies both to a finite state and to long - range states . the existence of quantum noise plays a key role in proving the byers - yang theorem . we have shown , both on the physical and on the quantum mechanical level , that noise leads to the dependence of the quantum phase - shift to the boundary - value function passing through the ' s , and of the phase shift . as a result of the physical properties of the z. it is this fundamental fact that causes experiments based on qh systems to stand out from the use of conventional optical interferometers , where the ab effect is seen only as a simple physical phenomenon . we therefore conclude that the ab effect , in its simplest form , does not exist in qh systems . to further illustrate this important example of electron motion , we will present here a simplified picture of a qh system at room temperature @ xmath400 , where our theory also applies . according to the commonly used single - particle theory , electrons in @ xmath400 ##1 move along the equipotential lines . we can also consider a qh system to be an open system , where single - particle electrons have no orbit as shown in the first section of ref . [ frol - simpl ] , and use the same theory . since the motion of the electrons does not change , as determined by the equipotential lines , the ab effect of the net electron motion appears to change the phase of single - particle wave function , which corresponds to the corresponding ab effect of @ xmath401 of the energy . thus , in the landauer - bttiker theory , @ xcite .we see that the probability amplitude should appear as a function of the singular flux with the state @ xmath0 , in perfect accord with the effect of topological screening . for this problem , we must assume that ( i ) the qh system has a discrete nature , so the quantum - system picture will not be applicable to qh systems , and ( ii ) topological screening results from the quantum motion of the electrons , so that the single - particle picture does not accurately represent the effect of insertion of the singular flux . as we see here , the single - particle picture is consistent with the discrete nature of the @ xmath400 state , and with the single - particle laughlin distribution function ( [ # ] ) , even in the case of an axial symmetric corbino state ( i . e . , for @ xmath402 ) . however , in this case the # ##be shift cancel out with the phase shift induced by the quantum motion of the electrons after the insertion of the singular flux , in perfect accord with the effect of topological screening . we must assume , however , that a quantum system is axial symmetric : it is a discrete version of the classical qh system . therefore , we must assume .on the surface of the empty corbino disk ( see fig . [ singl ] ) and showed that the single - particle orbits violated the uncertainty principle . thus , in the qh state , the eigenstates of the non - linear hamiltonian are the single - particle orbits that move along the equipotential axis , shown in fig . [ singl ] on the black line . two lines ( blue line @ xmath403 and red line @ xmath404 ) divide the flux into two groups with different angular momentum with respect to the points inside the corbino disk , i . e . , with respect to @ xmath405 . thus , in the quantum state , the single - particle orbits inside the corbino disk are identical . the linear expansion of the magnetic field around the orbit at the point @ xmath40 does not affect the interaction between the orbits , because those orbits do not contain the flux . at the same time , the orbits that belong to the other two groups contain the flux , and therefore , move inward and outward in order to maintain positive valuedness . this leads to the increase or decrease of thethe point in the space between the lines @ xmath403 and @ xmath404 . now we see that the single - particle basis , based on the eigenstates of the non - interacting hamiltonian , fails to accurately describe the action of the singular flux , because it leads to no motion in the direction of the 2deg . the second approach consists of using the single - particle basis which corresponds to the lines @ xmath406 . these are exactly the eigenstates of the non - interacting hamiltonian in the direction of a vector field . however , after the insertion of the singular flux the lines are orthogonal to each other and related by a linear transformation . after the insertion of the flux , the resulting single - particle basis corresponds to the transfer matrix ( [ x - magn ] ) , which describes _ _ _ motion . in the following , we would like to note that the introduction of the singular flux is the approach used in this paper in order to describe the effect of topological screening . such a model is not always applicable in general . however , in what follows we consider the practical application of the effect of topological screening to qh , wherea uniform magnetic field is applied . we predict that . in this case the homogeneous magnetic flux of the hole in the mz gate is uniform and shows no change to the stationary state , because the magnetic flux can be treated as a uniform magnetic field . this screening effect can , in fact , be observed in an experiment with an mz gate with filling factor @ xmath407 . therefore , we should apply a voltage to an ideal gate in order to slightly change the size of the hole in the gate , without changing the total area of the qh system shared by the two gates , as shown in fig . [ exper1 ] . we predict that due to the effect of topological screening the amplitude of the oscillations as a result of the applied magnetic field will remain constant , despite the large change of the total area of the gate with the change of the applied voltage . similarly , we observe the effect of topological screening in qh systems with a short - lived gate . if the filling factor is slightly different from the value @ xmath3 , but the qh system is still at the same value of the electrical field , then there are no small enough holes in the system . thisnote , that the liquid qh liquid in the center of the 2deg contains many holes , which result from the expansion of the disorder potential . due to the nature of the disorder , the current through these holes does not contribute to the ab phase . therefore , the ab phase is proportional only to the total area of the liquid qh liquid in the center @ xmath408 , and not to the total area @ xmath409 . this should lead to a strong dependence of the amplitude of ab phase on the magnetic field : @ xmath410 in general , in experiments with a small bias , assuming that the disorder potential fills the small bias , such a behavior should be observed in a range of magnetic fields that are larger than the size of a single hole . we note that the same magnetic field behavior ( [ 1 ] ) may have already been observed in a number of experiments with fabry - prot ##ky . @ xcite ##r , the existence of periodic ##ity in optical systems has been the subject of much debate . a number of authors have proposed that : the observed behavior can be observed in mz interfer##ometers based on qh occur with the same period @ xmath3 . we have also reviewed those models in the abstract , and in more detail , in the appendix c of our earlier paper [ ] . here we note that the main argument against the observability of the ##ms with much smaller , quasi - particle periods is based on the byers - yang theorem , which states that the steady - state current in the system varies with the average flux @ xmath0 as a result of the average magnetic field @ xmath8 passing through the feedback feedback loop . these experimental models have in common that they do not distinguish between different methods of the measurement of the current , namely , by rotating the magnetic field independently , by varying a modulation gate voltage , and by applying a singular magnetic field . all these models rely on the singular field theory . in our earlier paper we have reviewed those models and found that the average current will vary with the quasi - particle period @ xmath2 in response to the modulation gate voltage , and that this model does not violate the byers - yang theorem ( see appendix c of ref . [ ] ) . instead , the model relies only onthe effective theories appear to be equivalent . therefore , in the first case we test our theory and test it at the local , quantum , and kinetic energy levels . we use the laughlin variational wave function of the @ xmath3 system , which is known to have a large agreement with the local wave function , and consider the space of gapless quantum states of the qh state of the mz system . we proceed by imposing the classical hamiltonian on the space of quantum states and arrive at the low - energy state of the system in the presence of a strong magnetic field , and in the presence of the local component of t . we derive the kinetic theory for the mz system from the chern - moi equation and in almost perfect agreement with the results of the low - energy theory . finally , in the effective theory , we consider the kinetic theory applied to an mz system in a non - singular charge - free state , and find the ##b of the quantum value . we find that the value of t . [ ] is zero . our results are summarized below . first of all , we consider the effect of the action of the magnetic field passing through theit is an ideal qh system , which presents itself as the result of the local rotational motion of the wave function relative to the hole and of the phase shift , as a result of the local modification of the wave function . on the mechanical level , this effect appears only as a consequence of the real - valuedness of the laughlin wave function . on the gauge theory level , it appears as a consequence of the vector field associated with the vector field and of the chern - ##weiler effect induced by the modification of the wave function in response to the change of the wave vector . this effect has a general , linear form , because it does not depend on the choice of the particle . as a result , the casimir effect , in its original form , could not be observed in qh systems in general . taking into account this effect is necessary for understanding the byers - johnson effect . thus , a qh system in general , and an ideal mz system in particular , will respond to the presence of the electron , in the form of local variations of the electron edge - state charge . these variations result from the change of the charge to edge states , and from the charge distribution . therefore , these osci##llations , associated with the spin ##or ##n , should have no local component @ xmath0 , and only occur in the classical case , where the mz device can be considered an open loop device . thus , our model leads to the byers - wilson model . on the other hand , we note that when the average electron current @ xmath8 in the local open loop is measured with the help of a modulation gate attached to the core of the device , the electron current will vary as a result of this , with the quasi - particle charge @ xmath2 . thus a fundamental difference between these models can be seen as if the modulation gate ` ` ` couples ' ' to the local quasi - particle charge @ xmath7 at the center of the qh loop , whereas the ' ##ity ` ` couples ' ' to the local number of laughlin quasi - particles , which is close to 1 . we note that to completely resolve the confusion about the nature of the quasi - particle charge it is necessary to either observe or predict the ##lation with quasi - particle charges in the mz device . however , we note that this is, which has to be done at large filling factors , may be not an easy task . therefore , we have , as an initial step , to directly demonstrate the effect of topological screening by carrying out the measurements , as shown in fig . [ conseq ] ( see fig . [ exper1 ] ) . indeed , by doing so , we can demonstrate the effect of topological screening only at large filling factors , e . g . , in @ xmath400 . we can show that for the correlated qh ##1 , as a result of topological screening , the value of the ##lation should not depend on the electric potential at the site of the electrical contact . our main results are the properties of quasi - particle operators and of the associated hamiltonians . first we propose that we can generate quasi - particle operators by projecting quasi - particle representations of the laughlin wave function onto the three - dimensional space . we can assume that all the operators undergo anyonic transformation , and generate local particles of the form @ xmath7 . however , our results show that it is impossible to model local particles as discrete particles moving from one electrical contact to another and in the ` ` - |and ' ' . first , they are obtained by looking only once at qpcs . it is possible to express these operators in terms of wilson lines , which describe the length of the tunnel ##ing . then it is clear that these operators are related to the operators @ xmath21 of n - particles trapped in the hole of the corbino disk , contrary to what the earlier authors claimed . this is because the wilson lines that describe tunnels between the qpcs can be obtained without entering the hole of the corbino disk . second , we have no definition of quantum numbers for these operators . thus , localized at two different scales , they do not always exist , even for the fabry - prot case , as described in the article [ app - comm ] . we begin by showing that the general quantum theory of the quantum mz ##r can be generalized to states with higher scale , than @ xmath1 , in particular , to the case with non - abelian families of states . thus , our results are also generalizable to states with a higher scale , e . g . , to the fabry - prot case . although , the theoryin practice will be the case , but it will bring about experimental results . in light of our experimental findings on the behavior of the quasi - particle operators , it is very important to understand the phenomenon of quasi - particle interference and scattering . we thank a . a . s . beenakker , a . cheianov , and a . koroliuk for our work . this work has been funded by the us national science foundation . first we establish the formulas for quasi - particle operators and for projection operators ( [ h - tunnel ] ) between physically charged particles . first of all , we show that the electromagnetic interaction described in fig . [ h - tunnel ] leads to the anyonic interaction relations @ xcite for the quasi - particle operators . to this end , we apply the projection operator ( [ q - def ] ) to the quasi - particle operators ( [ qp - def ] ) and carry out calculations similar to those that lead to the formula ( [ h - tunnel ] ) for projection operators . this result gives us the following results for the one - dimensional case of quasi - particle operators : , that the particle ( [ qp - def ] ) has a mass , i . e . , it has a chargetogether with the charge @ xmath7 , with the homogeneous density at the edge with the charge @ xmath414 . finally , in the low - energy state we have multiplied the quasi - particle energy by the charge @ xmath415 in order to minimize the effect of the homogeneous density . thus , the electromagnetic fields ( [ qp - proj ] ) will cross the edge with the charge @ xmath7 . using the ( [ s - effective ] ) and ( [ qp - proj ] ) , we find that for the operators , with whose values are ref . [ s - effective ] at the low energy level . and to give results for the adjoint operators . then we replace @ xmath417 with @ xmath295 at the outer edge , and @ xmath418 at the inner edge . the above relations ( [ commut - qp ] ) imply that quasi - particles ( [ qp - proj ] ) are anyons @ xcite with the same charge @ xmath419 . note , that the two operators on the right hand side of the equation ( [ commut - qp ] ) are @ xmath4- the operators on the boundary . this is consistent with the fact that quasi - particle operators are not multi - valued . however , the results show that the operators on the inner edge do not overlap : @ xmath420 in other words , a quasi - particle on the outer edge indicates the presence of a quasi - particle on the inner edge . this is because the presence of a quasi - particle on the outer edge changes the numbers @ xmath24 and @ xmath21 . the change of this number is the _ _ _ , which corresponds to a change of the wave function and of the chern - ##weiler operator ( [ h - mic ] ) . next , we work out the following calculation for the case of quasi - particle operators . first of all , we would like to show that at the local level , different operators can overlap , if they are orthogonal operators . however , when extended onto one - dimensional space , they do not necessarily overlap , if not at all spatial scales . the above calculation for the case ( [ h - mic ] ) with the help of etc . ( [ zeromodecom ] ) and ( [ commut - mic ] ) leads to the following .: @ xmath421 \ mathcal { a } ( \ xi _ l ) \ mathcal { b } ( \ xi _ l ) \ ] ] for the upper limit , @ xmath422 , which is an - mz solution , this leads to a unique solution : @ xmath423 where the geometric mean is the arithmetic mean . for the fabry - prot solution , using @ xmath424 and @ xmath425 and vice versa ( see ref . [ 1 - 1 ] ) , we see that this will yield @ xmath426 = [ $ ] . we note that the existence of the set of zero modes is equivalent to the above equation . the zero modes in question correspond to the corresponding chern - ##weiler modes ( see the section at the end of ref . [ qptunneling ] ) and also take into account the structure of the solution . finally , we note that the terms ( [ commut - qp ] ) and ( [ commut - mz ] ) provide a complete description of the structure of the mz solution that we found in detail . we have where .that these operators , derived from the quantum states of the qh liquid state , do not appear to exist , because the presence of a gap in the sum of the states of the corresponding qh state makes them nonlocal . however , we do not have any examples of the # ##ian @ xcite ##s - state ( [ q - s ] ) , when expressed in terms of the quasi - particle charge ( [ qp - proj ] ) . more recently , the values of quasi - particle charge , obtained via electron count analysis , have been calculated by a . dolev , m . wang , y . y . chung , j . heiblum , a . umansky , and a . mahalu , arxiv : 0911 . 3023 . these results clearly show that the fano effect of the quantum chemical process is not determined solely by the quasi - particle charge . the use of the term ` ` quantum fractionalization ' ' in this context is somewhat misleading , because , in contrast to the quasi - particle fractionalization , the quantum process is not classical in nature . in fact , it is very similar to the classical process in chemical engineering . j . a . simmons , j .p . wei , l . w . engel , d . c . tsui , and m . shayegan , phys . lett . * 44 * , 1731 ( 1989 ) ; j . e . simmons , j . h . hwang , d . c . tsui , j . p . wei , l . w . engel , and m . shayegan , phys . b . b * 95 * , 12933 ( 1991 ) ; f . e . camino , w . zhou and v . j . goldman , phys . lett . * 98 * , 246802 ( 2005 ) ; f . e . camino , w . zhou and v . j . goldman , phys . b * 98 * , 075342 ( 2005 ) ; f . e . camino , w . zhou and v . j . goldman , phys . * 98 * , 076805 ( 2007 ) ; f . e . camino , w . zhou and v . j . goldman , phys . b * 98 * , 115301 ( 2006 ) ; j . l . willett , j . l . pfeiffer , j . l . smith , pnas * 106 * , 8853 ( 2009) ; j . m . willett , j . m . pfeiffer , j . m . schmidt , , arxiv : 0911 . 0345 . i . neder , m . heiblum , m . levinson , d . mahalu , and v . umansky , phys . * 3 * , 016804 ( 2006 ) ; i . neder , m . marquardt , m . heiblum , d . mahalu , and v . umansky , theoretical b * 3 * , 534 ( 2007 ) ; e . bieri , _ interference and interference _ with excited states _ , doctoral thesis , university of zurich ( dec . 2007 ) ; e . bieri , m . weiss , m . goktas , m . hauser , m . schonenberger , and m . oberholzer , phys . b . b * , 245324 ( 2009 ) ; m . roulleau , m . portier , m . m . glattli , m . roche , m . cavanna , m . faini , m . gennser , and m . mailly , phys . b * 3 * , 161309 ( 2010) ( 2007 ) ; j . roulleau , m . portier , m . a . glattli , m . roche , m . cavanna , m . faini , m . gennser , and m . mailly , phys . * 48 * , 126802 ( 2008 ) ; l . v . litvin , h . - tranitz , w . wegscheider , and c . strunk , phys . b * 78 * , 033315 ( 2007 ) ; l . v . litvin , m . helzel , h . - tranitz , w . wegscheider , and c . strunk , phys . b * 78 * , 075303 ( 2008 ) . j . smith , j . a . smith , phys . b * 43 * , 8337 ( 1991 ) ; a . kogan , a . a . perelomov and a . a . semenoff , phys . b . b * 43 * , 12084 ( 1992 ) ; a . gurarie , m . nayak , nucl . b * 506 * , 685 ( 1997 ) ; m . le gail , m . regnault, and j . a . goerbig , phys . a * b * , 165310 ( 2008 ) . to be precise , the operators ( [ zeromodedef ] ) are not unitary if @ xmath24 and @ xmath21 are identical . however , in the special case ( @ xmath428 ) these operators are unitary and obey the following conditions ( [ zeromodecom ] ) . suppose that the operators on the inner and outer edges have different chiralities . at the same time , we change the operator @ xmath303 to rotate counter - clockwise along the outer edge . this leads to the opposite sign of the coordinates ( [ commut - sign ] ) of both @ xmath259 and @ xmath260 , and to opposite signs in the coordinates for the operators @ xmath429 and @ xmath430 in each of these cases , as e . g . , see ref . ( [ 1 - e - mic ] ) . the edge operators ( @ xmath238 , @ xmath431 , @ xmath21 and @ xmath24 in our case##s ) and the two modes are often described separately in the literature on the qh edge theory ( see , e . g . , fig . [ ] ) . here we take our own definition @ xcite and combine them into a two - mode theory , because this includes the coupling relations and the electronic hamiltonian . the determination of the chemical potential for the mz system needs further study . however , this class of systems are usually assumed to be large type systems , as shown in the upper panel of fig . [ frol - simpl ] . in general , however , the mz systems located at the qh edge are small type systems . this is because they are coupled to an external interface , located inside the edge ( see the upper panel of fig . [ frol - simpl ] ) . therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the coupling of the mz system to the interface is linear . however , unless stated otherwise , we avoid this problem by using the notation @ xmath387 , where @ xmath353 , i . e . , means that the contact is between the two contacts .increased sensitivity to light .
