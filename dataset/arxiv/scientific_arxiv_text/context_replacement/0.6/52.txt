the quantum entropy , as a tool to measure and classify the phase transitions , has been playing an important role for the last 20 years ( see @ xcite and others below ) . in this case , where all of the spin spin states are conformal transitions , the quantum entropy is a useful tool to measure , as well to classify , the central charge @ xmath11 of the system cft . for example , for quantum mechanics , the two - dimensional quantum entropy of the network formed by spins @ xmath7 , of an infinite length , with respect to the z direction is the second term @ xmath12 if the system is critical and @ xmath13 , when the system is critical with infinite length @ xmath14 @ xcite . although there are plenty of ways to measure this entropy in the domain @ xcite the experimental results are out of date so far . strictly speaking the central charge of the quantum system has not been measured directly . many other measures , that are not independent of the central charge have been proposed @ xcite . among these are the measures that , from the theoretical point of view , are very useful for measuring the phase transitions as well .the equivalence relation of these states , is the shannon and rnyi mutual information @ xcite ( see also the recent article @ xcite ) . the rnyi mutual information ( the full definition will be given in the next section ) has a function @ xmath5 that estimates the shannon mutual information to the function @ xmath15 . the results obtained in @ xcite show that the shannon and rnyi mutual informations of the ground state of classical spin systems , when expressed in a positive linear form , and when measured with the shannon and rnyi mutual information , have a consistent relationship with the states of spin whose size depends on the classical spin . recently , new results on the shannon and rnyi mutual information in quantum mechanics were obtained , in @ xcite . there are many examples of the mutual information of classical two - dimensional systems @ xcite . it is worth noting that the shannon and rnyi mutual information described in the previous section , which will be discussed in the next section , are basis dependent quantities . it is important to distinguish them from the well known basis dependent quantities , namely , the von neumann mutual information . for recent years , the use of the von neumann mutual information in quantum systems and in- - . - @ xcite . most of the derivation of the above and the rnyi mutual information , especially for the case of harmonic chains , are based on analytical methods , especially for systems with a parameter approximately equal to 1 . one of the main difficulties in a good analytical derivation arises from the lack of a limit at @ xmath15 of the rnyi mutual information . this limitation requires the use of the averaging method , which is only a first step for the analytical derivation of the shannon mutual information . in this case we will consider , for the different harmonic chains , a limit of the mutual information , which is also parametrized by the parameter @ xmath5 that corresponds at @ xmath15 to the shannon mutual information . the motivation for our derivation is two ##fold . firstly this quantity is most useful from the point of view of the distribution of mutual information among states of the system , since it gives the same value . this will be discussed in the paper . secondly , this quantity does not have a limit at @ xmath15 , so it can be a good starting point for the analytical derivation of the shannon mutual information with this kind of analytical derivation of the parameter @ xmath5 . fromtherefore , we will call this new information generalized mutual information . with the above results in mind we have calculated directly ( by partial integration ) the generalized mutual information for many critical quantum spin chains . we calculated models with @ xmath1 symmetry like the @ xmath16 - symmetry potts model for @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 , the su ( 2 ) ashkin - landau model and the @ xmath1 parafermionic model with @ xmath19 . we have calculated the generalized mutual information for critical spin chains ##s ( a type of klein - gordon representation # ) and also for critical spin chains with @ xmath4 symmetry in the xxz and the gauge - invariant fateev - zamolodchikov space group . the text of the paper is as follows : in the first section we will present the essential results of the landau and rnyi mutual information as well as generalized mutual information . in section 2 we will present the essential results of the generalized mutual information for many different critical quantum spin chains . then in the next section we present our results . consider the quantum ground state eigenfunction of the critical spin chain hamiltonian @ xmath20 , and as afor local basis @ xmath21 , where @ xmath22 are the values of the spin operators acting on the state ##s . the rnyi entropy is defined as @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 is the probability of finding the configuration of the corresponding state described by @ xmath25 . the definition @ xmath26 gives us the corresponding entropy @ xmath27 . since we are using a local basis it is also possible to define the entropy as a sum of the configurations inside and outside of the subregions of @ xmath28 . we can define the transition states as @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 . in the original definition @ xcite we used the following definition of the rnyi mutual information : @ xmath31 from now on instead of using @ xmath32 we can use only @ xmath33 . the corresponding values of the rnyi mutual information of higher spin systems are obtained by using the definition ( [ renyi2 ] ) . for local basis , using the basis where part of the hamiltonian is known ( see @ xcite ) , the definition ( [ renyi2 ] ) for the rnyi mutual information .is a random function with the property , , for all values of @ xmath5 . however , as defined above for all infinite values ( see @ xcite ) , it has a value , @ xmath15 , that requires the use of non - @ xmath5 methods to solve the more difficult problem where @ xmath15 , is the measure for mutual information . although the example ( [ renyi2 ] ) has its own name it is not the one which often has been used in information sciences . for example @ xmath34 for @ xmath35 is not just a random function , a statement that we would expect to be true for the mutual information . in this case we have a definition that is used in information sciences @ xcite . the following mutual information with the following properties , is the measure of mutual information ( see below ) , is used in @ xcite : @ xmath36 where @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 , as above , are the states that the states are involved in the configuration @ xmath39 and @ xmath40 that occurs the configuration @ xmath25 that occurs with the@ xmath33 . then @ xmath6 will be the size of the whole system and @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 the size of the system . with this second definition we can write @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 . this definition of the generalized mutual information follows from the natural extension of the shannon entropy to the rnyi distribution and derives the entropy of the whole system from the intersection of two probability distributions . in the form @ xmath43 one easily derives the generalized mutual information @ xmath44 , where @ xmath27 is the generalized shannon entropy . one of the important properties of @ xmath0 , that is not affected by @ xmath34 , is its nondecreasing behavior as a result of @ xmath5 ( see below ) . our calculation for a set of distinct quantum spin chains can be done easily , since even to our knowledge the exact method to calculate these spin chains is still unknown . in this part we will first calculate the two - state generalized mutual information of two sets of distinct quantum spin chains with a different symmetry . in the second part we will calculate the generalized mutual information for chains with different symmetry .consider the @ xmath16 - quantum potts model with @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 , the ashkin - landau model and the parafermionic @ xmath1 - quantum spin chain @ xcite for the case of @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 . in the second section we will study the generalized mutual information for models with @ xmath4 symmetry such as the klein - gordon gauge model , the xxz model and the fateev - zamolodchikov model with different values of their correlation coefficients . in this section we will study the generalized mutual information of the ground states of the quantum spin chains with @ xmath1 - symmetry . the results we obtain are obtained by studying the ground - state wavefunction in a different basis where the states have very different symmetry . [ htb ] [ fig1 ] of the @ xmath47 - symmetry ising ##lass ##o , is a model of @ xmath48 . the ground - state wavefunction is of the form where the are @ xmath49 matrix and ( @ xmath50 matrix ) . , dimension = " 1 : " , scaledwidth = .. . % ] our results show that the q - state potts model and the ashkin - smith model have a similar structure . for this reason we lump them together . the following @ xmath16 - state potts model in a diagonal basis is governed by the hamiltonian @ xcite @ xmath51 where @ xmath49 and @ xmath52 are @ xmath53 . of the following @ xmath1 model : @ xmath54 = [ s _ i , r _ j ] = [ s _ i , r _ j ] = [ $ ] for @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 . the model has a diagonal frame governed by a cft with positive coefficients @ xmath58 where @ xmath59 . the @ xmath60 potts model is in the following ising quantum chain . [ htb ] [ fig2 ] of the @ xmath47 model in ising quantum chain , in the basis of @ xmath48 . the q - state wavefunction is of the form where the coefficients @ xmath52 are and ( @ xmath61 algebra ) . , where = " model :" , scaledwidth = 1 . 5 % ] the ashkin - teller model has an @ xmath62 basis and a hamiltonian given by : @ xmath63 where @ xmath49 and @ xmath52 are the same matrices as in the @ xmath64 potts model . the model is unitary and conformal except for @ xmath65 with the same charge @ xmath66 . it is worth noting that at @ xmath67 we get the @ xmath64 potts model and at @ xmath68 the model is similar to the original ising model . for the model @ xcite we also see that the spin and rnyi ##on interactions , as described in ( [ renyi2 ] ) , are time independent . in other words we can get two completely different two - state system models by using this model . but for the other basis , that we call conformal symmetry , the model has some improvements . for example , the results for the @ xmath16 - 1 potts model and for the ashkin - teller model in the case where the spin @ xmath52 and the charge @ xmath49 are : ##lythe following , and comparing the two coefficients @ xmath69 with @ xmath70 we should note that in @ xcite , based on our calculations , it was shown that for @ xmath15 the coefficient @ xmath71 could not be made equal to the total number . as it was stated in @ xcite it is very clear that @ xmath34 is not a constant constant for @ xmath15 and that any attempt to find the # ##tion with this kind of rnyi shared information would be impossible . this makes the exact solution a challenge . this is an important point to consider the definition of @ xmath0 , when considering the first equation , from the point of view of the model of shared information . with this in mind we used the @ xmath0 for @ xmath17 and @ xmath64 potts , and for the ashkin - sachs coefficients for the @ xmath61 and the @ xmath50 respectively . we found that with this kind of version of the equation @ xmath5 we could find the coefficients corresponding to @ xmath72 and @ xmath10 a monotonically nondecreasing version of @xmath5 , corresponds with what we use for the mutual information , since it is a simple example of mutual information ( see the figure ) . [ htb ] [ fig3 ] of the product of the values of the exponential ( [ renyi - potts ] ) and the total value @ xmath11 for the @ xmath16 - state potts model with @ xmath17 and above , and for the ashkin - teller model ( a - b ) with the value @ xmath73 . the ashkin - teller model with the critical point ( @ xmath74 ) is identical to the @ xmath18 - state potts model . the two - state wavefunctions are of the form where the @ xmath49 values are zero . the block values of the model are , and the values @ xmath10 are obtained by computing the block [ @ xmath75 $ ] . , [ = " : : " , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] . we compute the values for the @ xmath16 - state potts and ashkin - teller model with : the . the .in we focus on the coefficients we use to compute the ground - state wavefunction . 2 . the generalized mutual information @ ( [ renyi mi potts ] ) for the @ xmath50 and @ xmath61 basis , with different coefficients for each basis . to illustrate the generalized behavior we use in fig . 1 and fig . 2 the mutual information @ xmath0 for the ising model ( @ xmath60 ) with @ xmath47 coefficients and ground - state eigenfunctions in the @ xmath50 and @ xmath61 basis , respectively . we see , from these results , that for values of @ xmath76 we have the same behavior followed by ( [ renyi mi potts ] ) corresponding to @ xmath77 in the @ xmath50 - basis and @ xmath78 in the @ xmath61 - basis . in we now see our behavior does not imply the existence of the corresponding @ xmath7 - basis coefficients .

( [ renyi - potts ] ) is a continuous monotonically non - negative function of @ xmath5 and thus has the following formula for the @ xmath50 model : @ xmath79 where @ xmath11 is the electric constant and @ xmath80 has to be a continuous constant absolute value of the value , as we can see in fig . 3 . in the case of the ashkin - smith model the results appear to differ for @ xmath81 from the results obtained for the potts model . as we can see in fig . 3 , the value of is dependent on the value of @ xmath73 of the model . 2 . in the case of the @ xmath61 model , as we can see in fig . 3 , formula ( [ 1 ] ) is only valid for values of @ xmath##5 up to @ xmath824 . 3 the function @ xmath80 is independent from the results obtained in the @ xmath50 basis . as shown in fig . 4 , up to @ xmath83 the value of the function @ xmath80 appears to be completely independent of the basis . this figure also shows that the ashkin - sachs model has complete independence from this basis , as compared with the results obtained in the @ xmath50 basis . in order to better understand the value of the function @ xmath10 in the @ xmath50 and @ xmath61 basis , we use in fig . 4 the figures of fig . 3 and 4 for the @ xmath17 and 4 state potts model . + [ htb ] [ fig5 ] of fig . 3 and 4 for the @ xmath17 and 4 - state potts model , shown in the following figure , for example . , [ = " figure : " , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] ] . the value of the function in the @ xmath50 basis that goes to zero in @ xmath84 , apart from the @ xmat##h61 basis where k reduces to a non - negative integer . this also means that , in the figure , all the values in the @ xmath50 basis are positive whereas in the @ xmath61 basis all of them are negative . for the details of the @ xmath85 basis see the figure . our above calculations show that @ xmath10 is a continuous function of @ xmath5 and @ xmath15 . this means that @ xmath0 should be a continuous function with respect to @ xmath5 and that it is a suitable basis to be used for further understanding the physical properties of the ratio @ xmath5 , as happens for example in the following section . however , the exact basis that should be used is still unknown to us . it is important to note that the values used for the ratio @ xmath86 in this section ( fig . 7 ) and in the following sections ( fig . 8 , 9 , 11 and 12 ) are based on the same basis with the @ xmath87 $ ] basis . these calculations are done by considering the number of values above . in all the following sections we will consider cases where a small part of the ratioof course that gives the estimated values of @ xmath10 that differ by several times . as an example we consider the values obtained from the data of fig . 1 and 2 for the ising model with @ xmath47 sites and ground - state eigenfunction in the @ xmath50 and @ xmath61 basis , respectively . this is shown in fig . 2 we can see , but for the @ xmath50 basis the fit is different . to @ xmath88 in the @ xmath61 basis we do not have estimated values for @ xmath89 .

( [ fig ] ) is very valid for the two types of models , at least for values of @ xmath5 up to @ xmath99 . however the matching of these values is not possible due to the large lattice size we discussed , except for @ xmath100 .

state potts model ( @ xmath2 ) and the parafermionic @ xmath1 state model ( @ xmath3 ) . in the case of the ashkin - rosen model our results indicate that @ xmath80 , for @ xmat##h158 , is based on the parameter @ xmath73 of the model . on the other hand the model with mirror symmetry has a similar result as for @ xmath157 . for @ xmath158 we have strong evidence that most of the shannon mutual information is well conserved . it is also possible that in these cases we can solve part of the problem by performing a simple long - range approximation with ##s . in order to understand we should note that an analytical solution for the shannon entropy and the shannon mutual information ( @ xmath181 and @ xmath182 , ( [ renyi2 ] ) and ( [ renyi ##3 ] ) ) is a real solution . the best way to solve this kind of problem is use some kind of approximation method , with the parameter @ xmath5 , using the above approximation ##s . the results we have for the behavior of @ xmath0 and @ xmath15 , apart from what happened with @ xmath34 , show that @ xmath0 is much more suitable for an analytical solution . _ _ _ this work is done in brazil by fapesp and cnpq ( brazil )) . we consult j . m . hoyos , m . pereira and m . pasquier for further details . in this section we discuss the definition of the relative entropy and its extension : the rnyi , . the relative entropy is defined as the measure of the difference between the values of the two sets of , @ xmath183 and @ xmath184 , from the point of view of the set @ xmath183 , i . e . , @ xmath185 , can be used as the measure of the difference between the two sets @ xmath183 and @ xmath184 . although it is not a physical measure it allows us to define the mutual information of the sets @ xmath186 and @ xmath187 of the system as : @ xmath188 in general , the mutual information of two parts of the system is called the relative entropy of the joint distribution for the whole system and the entropy of the probability distribution of the two parts . it measures how well the two parts are correlated . the general extension of the relative entropy is the rnyi , and can be defined ( using @ xcite for .) , for @ xmath189 it has the following properties : for @ xmath190 we have @ xmath191 and if @ xmath192 exists we have @ xmath193 . the second case @ xmath26 has the corresponding absolute entropy . we can write the @ xmath85 definition as : @ xmath194 it is worth noting that in the above definition @ xmath195 is always true , when for which @ xmath196 , for which @ xmath197 , @ xmath198 exists . for ( [ renyi ##2 ] ) with ( [ mutual information from absolute entropy ] ) and ( [ absolute entropy ] ) the above definition of the corresponding relative entropy is @ xmath199 the above definition , derived from @ xmath200 , is given by ( [ renyi2 ] ) , and has been widely used in many areas of information theory .
