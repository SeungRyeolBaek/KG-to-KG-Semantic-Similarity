having been discovered more than a century before @ xcite , these have become one of the most important waves in physics . em waves ( also known as waves in solid state physics ) are low - frequency ( l ) ( in analogy with the black - hole frequency , @ xmath0 ) right - hand - side ( rcp ) electromagnetic ( em ) waves travelling outward from the external magnetic field in space plasma . because of the correlation of their wave size with the frequency , @ xmath1 ( see , e . g . , . @ xcite ) , the em waves travel rapidly and often in a down - slope even at ground level . stenzel in his first paper stenzel demonstrated successfully the existence of plasma ##ally - like wave ##forms caused by the ponderomotive field generated by the em waves . em waves are found not only in space plasma due to wave - particle interactions , but also in terrestrial plasma and plasma for space plasma ##s as well as in the solar plasma whistlertheory1 , whistlertheory2 , . , whistlertheory3 ( nearsonic ) , whistlertheory4 , and##rtheory5 , whistlerparametricinstability . on the other hand , the electromagnetic waves generated in a hot plasma can cause a wide variety of physical phenomena , e . g . , many - body interactions , gravitational effects @ xcite , modulational effects and the magnetic field , whistlertheory1 , whistlertheory2 , etc . the effects which , in turn , cause the electron energy loss or gain in plasma , are used as a tool for the electron beam physics of plasma @ xcite , electron energy transfer with the atmosphere and ambientmagnetosphere , electromagnetic wave propagation in plasma and solarwind etc . the laboratory experiments @ xcite and those from the freja satellite @ xcite show the high potential for the formation of large # ##s plasma by high density electrons . moreover , electrons in van allen radiation belts can be accelerated to mev energy in a short time by large density electrons @ xcite . the phenomenon has also been observed by the planck experiment @ xcite , the planck experiment and the satellite @ xcite . furthermore , laboratory experiments @ xcite and satellite experiments @ xcite .and the discovery of the first spheromaks with energies beyond the external magnetic field . they also contributed to quantum plasma reconnection and plasma dynamics in three - dimensional laser - solid density plasma interaction experiments @ xcite . recently , there has been a much renewed interest in studying the quantum states ##s in light of the recent results in nanoscale physics @ xcite , ultracold physics @ xcite , spintronics @ xcite and plasmonics @ xcite . on the other hand , superdense quantum states are found in other physical systems , e . g . , the cores of massive white dwarfs , cores of jupitors , magnetars etc . @ xcite , as well as in the new generation of laser - solid density plasma interaction experiments @ xcite . in quantum mechanics , the electrons obey maxwell - hamilton ##ian laws , and there are also quantum states associated with the bohm - morgan distribution , which have wave functions in nanoscales quantum1 , quantum2 , quantum3 . however , the motion of the electrons is by itself in violation of the weak strong force , as well as gravity , which can be .and extending the wave function to time - like processes @ xcite . more sophisticated mathematical models have also been developed @ xcite . " the spin of electrons in a ##onic plasma will be affected not only by the nuclear force , but also by the effects of the quantum mechanics , the bohm effect as well as the effects due to the spin of electrons . we ought to assume that in a dense ##r plasma there will be spin waves , which will be affected by the electron fluxes . therefore , new models of spin waves , in the whistlers ' s dense plasma have to be developed in their own right , for all these possible effects . recently , the theory of the ponderomotive force in metals has been developed to account for the effects from the intrinsic spin of electrons @ xcite . it has been shown that an em wave could induce a spin - spin wave from this spin - ponderomotive force ( sf ) . spin waves could also play an important role in the generation of other spin waves , e . g . , spin , alfvn ##s . our aim here is to perform a detailed study of the whistler spin waves interacting nonlinearly with background electron density .that is caused by the positive ponderomotive force ( cpf ) @ xcite as well as the interaction @ xcite . the effects of the spin interaction as well as the scattering effects due to electron transport and the electron spin are also taken into account . we also consider the weakly coupled velocity waves ( h - waves ) associated with the em wave , and in addition , all the other experimental results that appear in the literature ( see , e . g . , 1 . whistlertheory1 , whistlertheory2 ) . the experimental results could be useful for understanding the nature of the em wave which can originate from the motion of the white dwarfs , magnetars as well as from the next most important liquid - crystal em wave ##s . let us consider the propagation of nonlinearly coupled em waves and electro - optical ( em ) velocity waves in a uniform magnetic field @ xmath2 in a bulk metal - semiconductor system where the field - strength is known . in the modulational case , the high - frequency ( hr ) em wave ##form for the rcp system is given by @ xmath3c . e . , where @ xmath4 is theare the ( both in space and time ) components of the plane wave electric field and c . c . stands for the coupling constant . finally , @ xmath5 @ xmath6 is the electron resonance energy ( am ) . the maxwell equations for the dynamics of organic molecules , are spin1 , spinponderomotive , spinevolutioneqn . @ xmath7 @ xmath8 @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 @ xmath11 @ xmath12 is the electron spin , charge and mass of electrons respectively , @ xmath13 is the electric field and @ xmath14 is the electron kinetic energy . finally , @ xmath15 is the electron angular momentum with an absolute value @ xmath16 @ xmath17where @ xmath18 is the electron @ xmath19 - , and @ xmath20 is the spin ##or . the equations ( [ b1 ] ) - ( [ b3 ] ) are then replaced by the corresponding maxwell equations with @ xmath21 . @ xmath22 @ xmath23the equation ( [ b1 ] ) - ( [ b3 ] ) .the nonrelativistic properties of the @ xmath24 state , and are preserved even when spin states with spin - up and spin - down ( due to the magnetic field ) cannot be accurately described by the same spin . this can , however , happen in the regime of very strong magnetic fields ( or even very high density plasma ) , where all the electrons are the same - energy particles . on the other hand , for a time - scale larger than the spin - up time , the same spin state is well - described by the same average spin state , and in this case the spin equations can easily be applied . however , the case in which the average spin state can be reduced by a factor of the absolute value of @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 , will not be discussed further in the main article . as a result , our attention should be focused on the regimes of strong magnetic fields and high density plasma . using the results of fig . ( [ b2 ] ) and from fig .

( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) - ( [ 7 ] ) the weak interaction equations for the ##n of the boussinesq - such as @ xmath71where @ xmath72and @ xmath73 @ xmath74 is the spin - screening speed and @ xmath75 is the # ##onic speed for weak interactions . finally , we obtain a set of loosely related equations , namely ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , obtained from the study of the interaction and quantum mechanics , which includes the weak interaction of the ion .with the same local energy and momentum . these results can be obtained by dividing the coefficients according to @ xmath76 @ xmath77 , in which case we have @ xmath78 @ xmath79and @ xmath80 . \ notag \ \ & = \ lambda _ { 2 } \ frac { \ partial ^ { 2 } } { \ partial z ^ { 2 } } \ left ( 1 + \ frac { \ partial ^ { 2 } } { \ partial z ^ { 2 } } \ right ) | | | ^ { 2 } - \ lambda _ { 2 } \ frac { \ partial ^ { 2 } } { \ partial z \ ^ 2 } \ left ( 1 + \ frac { \ partial ^ { 2 } } { \ partial z ^ { 2 } } \ right ) @ xmath81 @ xmath82 @ xmath83 @ xmath84 is the local coupling constant , @ xmath85and @ xmath86 . ( [ 12 ] ) - ( [ 13 ] ) are the previous results of the previous section . in addition , the results @ xcite can be obtained by dividing##ing the spin effects @ xmath87 as well as the magnetic field @ xmath88 and using , e . g . , the classical equation of state ( valid for low to medium temperature systems ) . in this case we can understand the behavior of the system by solving for the equation . ( [ 12 ] ) - ( [ 13 ] ) for the ground state @ xmath89 ( where @ xmath90 @ xmath91 . we will find the corresponding values for the temperature and the magnetic field for which the nonrelativistic spin model is valid and which are equivalent to the cpf . we will then find that the cases in which spin dominates over the cpf will correspond to the weakly interacting superdense states where a treatement can be observed . however , before going back to these , let us first consider the special case in which the effect due to the separtion ( quasineutrality ) is negligibe . the effect can be observed only when the spin effects dominate , i . e . , @ xmath92 @ xcite . from the equation @ xmath93wenote that the quasineutrality of @ xmath94 holds for nonrelativistic ( @ xmath95 ) plasma as well as @ xmath96and @ xmath97 @ xmath98 . thus , we can show that in a simple special case , this condition cannot be satisfied for the classical ( @ xmath99 @ xmath100 ) plasma plasma . in this case , @ xmath101 combines and @ xmath102 @ xcite with @ xmath103 thus , when @ xmath104 the deviation from the norm @ xmath105 @ xmath106 will be greater than that @ xmath105 @ xmath107since @ xmath108 thus , in the quasineutral case , we get from cf . ( [ 12 ] ) - ( [ 13 ] ) the following nls : . @ xmath109together with @ xmath110then we can write cf . ( [ 14 ] ) with @ xmath111 , where @ xmath112 is written as @ xmat##h113where @ xmath114 here , the electrons resist the forward force generated by the center of the electromagnetic field , and thus gain some kinetic energy . the electrons gain energy during the forward phase of the pulse , and thus slow down under the same ponderomotive - like force . however , they may exceed the group speed of the pulse when it reaches the pulse frequency at the origin . from fig . ( [ 2 ] ) , we see that this may be true for @ xmath115 , which would hold for a pulse frequency of @ xmath116 and for high temperature ( @ xmath117m @ xmath118 ) and strongly interacting ( @ xmath119 ##m ) systems . in this case , the pulse frequency may exceed the group speed ( @ xmath120 ) . on the other hand , according to the formula shown in fig . 2 above , @ xmath121 and @ xmath122 exceed that @ xmath123 @ xmath124 and @ xmath125 respectively , so that the electrons can only move in the direction of the applied magnetic field . the total energy per##turbations would also require an additional density variation in order to satisfy the conservation of energy ( conservation of state ) for such systems . thus , the maximum density variation in the time - domain is @ xmath126 where @ xmath127 ) and ( [ 19 ] ) with associated electric field @ xmath128 ( upper panel ) and density variation @ xmath50 ( lower panel ) for @ xmath129 ( solid line ) and @ xmath130 ( dashed line ) . the other parameter values are @ xmath131m @ xmath118 , @ xmath132 ##m , @ xmath133 , @ xmath134 @ xmath135m / ( @ xmath136 , width = 288 , height = 288 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) with associated electric field @ xmath128 ( upper panel ) and density variation @ xmath50 ( lower panel ) for @ xmath137 t ( solid line ) and @ xmath138 t ( dashed line ) . the other parameter values are @ xmath131m @ xmath118 , @ xmat##h129 , @ xmath139 the two @ xmath90 terms are @ xmath140 ( dashed line ) and @ xmath141 ( dashed line ) . , width = 288 , height = 288 ] however , @ xmath142 changes sign whenever the third term @ xmath87 of s . ( [ delta ] ) dominates over the first two terms . thus , for the waves of light , @ xmath143and as in the previous section , @ xmath144 @ xmath145 is smaller compared to @ xmath146 when the second term dominates . however , in the quasineutral wave equation , the phase and amplitude components are positive and negative , and the resulting wave function is linear and nonlinear [ see s . ( [ delta ] ) ] . however , the - ( - ) and ##s of s . ( [ delta ] ) allows for the modulational - ( - ) when @ xmath147 for f . @ xmath148 when @ xmath149 , @ xmath150 @ xmath151 and @ xmath15##2 , where @ xmath153 indicates , a possible stationary state of the mi could be a dark ( dark ) or ( light ) gas - like plasma or a quasineutral or turbulent gas . # ( [ 2 ] ) is an exact numerical solution ( when @ xmath112 and @ xmath154 have the same solution ) of the [ @ xmath155 , \ ] ] where @ xmath156 is zero . the two special cases , namely the quasistationary energy state , ( i . e . , @ xmath157 for which @ xmath158 @ xcite and the case of turbulent flow ( quasi - flow ) for which the quasineutrality is not a constant parameter @ xcite will not be discussed here . those problems are not directly related to the two cases to be considered , so we will focus on our current problem . ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 12 ] ) . first , we look for stationary states of mi . ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 13 ] ) with the reference to @ xmath89 . then we find @ xmath##159 to be of the form @ xmath160where @ xmath128 is a real function and @ xmath161 is a real function . ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 12 ] ) corresponding to @ xmath162 @ xmath163where @ xmath164 we can solve the equations ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) using this equation with the boundary as @ xmath165 @ xmath166 @ xmath167 @ xmath168 ##s @ xmath169 . we find the frequency and the field amplitude to be : @ xmath170m @ xmath118 and @ xmath119 respectively . figure 1 shows the example of low - frequency - like # ##s with a real function for a range of frequencies : @ xmath171m @ xmath172 @ xmath173 ##m , @ xmath174 and @ xmath175 the highest frequencies are @ xmath176s @ xmath177 @ xmath178 and @ xmath179s @ xmat##h180 ##m , @ xmath181 @ xmath182 ##m and @ xmath183 m / s . therefore , the waves have a group speed with @ xmath184 from the above relation we obtain @ xmath185m @ xmath177 which corresponds to waves with a density of @ xmath186 ##m , and the group speed of @ xmath187 m / s . therefore , the free phase space is defined by @ xmath188 . the number of waves which is small compared to is the speed ( corresponding to the group speed ) of the electromagnetic wave . in the example ( fig . 2 ) with a strong magnetic field , we see a quasi - star - like structure associated with a dark plasma . the speed of the electromagnetic wave decreases as the magnetic field increases . in fig . 3 we are in the ground state when the density is very low ( @ xmath189m @ xmath118 ) . this also corresponds to the case when @ xmath190 exists , in this case we can assume that the energy density is close to and will therefore be higher than thespeed of light is general and therefore , nonrelativistic computational fluid dynamics will no longer be possible . the coupling coefficient @ xmath191 plays a crucial role for the model . thus , it can be seen that @ xmath192 ##m is in the regime @ xmath193 [ ex . ( [ x ] ) ] , because of its rotational symmetry ( @ xmath194 ) . in order that @ xmath191 can be compared to @ xmath90 , one would want to consider a high temperature @ xmath195m @ xmath196 and highly unstable @ xmath197 ##m . however , in this case the coefficients @ xmath198 ( @ xmath199 ) will be much larger than the other coefficients , which will destroy any chance for further stability . as shown in fig . 2 , one can consider a nondiverging system with a strong magnetic field in this case , e . g . , @ xmath200 @ xmath201 @ xmath202m @ xmath118 and @ xmath173 , for which @ xmath203 @xmath204 @ xmath205 m / s , @ xmath206 , @ xmath207 m / s , @ xmath208 m / s . this value corresponds to a parameter associated with electric field - the values ( ( @ xmath209 ) and ( [ 19 ] ) with associated electric field @ xmath128 ( upper panel ) and density per @ xmath50 ( lower panel ) for @ xmath210 ( dotted line ) and @ xmath211 ( solid and dotted ine ) . the other three values are @ xmath132 ##m , @ xmath212m @ xmath118 ( for solid and dotted line ) and @ xmath213m @ xmath118 ( for dotted line ) , @ xmath214 . the values of @ xmath90 ##m @ xmath215 ( for solid and dotted line ) and @ xmath216 ( for dotted line ) . , width = 288 , height = 288 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) with associated electric field @ xmath128 ( upper panel ) and density per##turbation @ xmath50 ( front row ) for @ xmath217 @ xmath132 ##m , @ xmath218m @ xmath118 , @ xmath219 . the smaller ones are @ xmath220 @ xmath221 m / s . , width = 288 , height = 288 ] the interactions of the electron beam and the @ xmath222 with the magnetic field applied to @ xmath223 will be upper and lower . ##band with amplitude and phase . for @ xmath224 and @ xmath225 the latter interact with the former and this creates a strong ponderomotive field which further increases the applied magnetic field . when all the waves are interacting with the applied magnetic field , the magnetic behavior of the waves can be described from above .

( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) ] demonstrated the existence of supersonic - spin particles driven by the single and double - magnetic - electric fields thatare trapped in a self - consistent magnetic field . thisand for all frequencies above @ xmath1 and when the field has negative group density . when the wave frequency is lower than @ xmath266 and the group density is positive for all frequencies , one can obtain a nondiverging plane wave , i . e . , a ducted wave . the result corresponds to a perfectly constant magnetic field with @ xmath267 . , the magnetic field with the valleys and peaks can vary depending on the characteristics of the field , as well as the magnetic field strength and / or the field direction . we ought to mention that our current knowledge of the magnetic nature of the ##f can play an important role in problems of bottom - up particle heating @ xcite as well as in the problems of high - energy spin - spin - orbit heating @ xcite of particles where the field , instead of being a wave , is a plane wave . apm is contracted to the kempe institute , uk , for research . contract no . 1 is held by the uk research council under contract no . 204059 - qpqv and the norwegian research council under contract no . 2007 - 4422 . .. marklund and a . brodin . _ _ frontiers of plasma physics _ : proceedings of the 2007 ictp international symposium on plasma physics , edited by s . k . shukla , m . stenflo , and m . eliasson ( aip , and scentific , london , 2008 ) ;
