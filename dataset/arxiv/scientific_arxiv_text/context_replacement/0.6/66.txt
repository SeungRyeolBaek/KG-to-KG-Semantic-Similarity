in the standard model ( sm ) , the main mechanism of cp violation is the kobayashi - maskawa effect @ xcite , located in the unitarity unit ( ut ) of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) of @ xcite . due to the different measurements of the current @ xmath3 - factory , cp violation could be detected at @ xmath4 @ xcite , leading to a new determination of @ xmath5 , where the transition - state is @ xcite @ xmath6 . the measurements of the other two states @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 are possible only by cp violation at the charmless @ xmath3 phase , known as @ xmath9 and corresponding to @ xcite . the current @ xmath3 - factory measurements have been determined to be @ xcite : @ xmath10 on the other hand , the analysis is complicated due to the need to determine the number of human - to - human states corresponding to this effect . in this case , we have the determination of @ xcite , where a new method of determining the mechanism for the cp violation is @ xmath11 , consistent with the ` ` two - dimensional##d ' ' ' @ xmath4 has been calculated . a table with upper bound for the ckm variables for values of @ xmath12 and @ xmath1 was obtained . our calculations of the hadronic numbers were carried out using correlation theory ( qcdf ) and lead to many problems . the time - dependent cp ##t = @ xmath0 ##2 is given by @ xmath13 @ xmath14 with @ xmath15 , and @ xmath16 and @ xmath8 have ckm variables which are related to the wolfenstein numbers @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 in the same way @ xcite . the tree - to - tree correspondence @ xmath19 can be expressed as @ xmath20 . the correlation ##s @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 expressed in this table are the particle correlation ##s without any dependence on ckm variables . for two different values of @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 the combination of @ xmath12 and @ xmath23 yields a line in the ( @ xmath17 , @ xmath18 ) - direction , passing straight through @ xmath##24 } { ( ( 1 - \ bar \ omega ) ^ 2 + \ bar \ omega ^ 2 ) ( 1 _ b ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + 1 - \ bar \ bar \ bar \ omega ) } \ dot { 1 } \ ] ] @ xmath25 the behavior of @ xmath26 has been calculated in @ xcite in the form of qcdf . the result can be expressed in the expression @ xmath27 } { a _ 1 + a ^ u _ 5 + a ^ \ alpha _ \ , a ^ u _ 5 + b _ { [ a _ 2 + b _ 3 + [ ##b _ 4 ] } , \ ] ] where we have the most important contributions from electroweak decay ##s . see further expression in @ xcite @ xmath28 where the result is an expansion of the decay error terms . in order to gain further insight into the behavior of hadronic @ xmath3 - type channels , it may be also necessary to derive these parameters from other @ xmath3 - channels , and from other methods . from this result , we have calculated them in a linear manner in @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 ( @ xmat##h31 ( the number of errors ) = ( [ rqcd ] ) . taking these values to reverse order , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 we find that the uncalculable error values @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 do not appear at ( [ rqcd ] ) , to which they do appear at ( @ xmath34 . from our experimental test data , one finds the central value @ xcite : @ xmath35 , which seems to be in very good agreement with the experimental qcdf values for the second - to - last step . in a further cross - section , one can derive @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 from @ xmath36 and @ xmath37 , leading to the central value @ xcite @ xmath38 , in agreement with the experimental approach to the central value @ xmath39 . ] , although their values differ significantly from @ xmath40 ( see @ xcite for further details ) . it is possible to solve the problem by combining the information from @ xmath12 with the information of @ xmath1 , but apart from the ` ` non - standard ' ' value @ xmath41. the value @ xmath16 of the parameter ##r determined by @ xmath42 the real parameter , @ xcite @ xmath6 , and @ xmath43 as a value of @ xmath44 , @ xmath17 is known to @ xmath18 and @ xmath45 . the value @ xmath17 can also be determined from @ xmath12 by ( [ srhoeta ] ) , which can be used for @ xmath18 to determine @ xmath46 , \ nonumber \ { { x } \ ] ] with @ xmath47 the experimental observables @ xmath44 ( = @ xmath1 ) and @ xmath12 , @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 . the corresponding experimental parameters @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 are known . the value of @ xmath18 as a value of @ xmath12 is shown in fig . [ 1 : etabspp ] , which shows the relative values from the experimental parameters @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 in qcdf . since the value of @ xmath22 is known ( [ etataus ] )being of first order , it turns out that the sum is very high in comparison to @ xmath21 . in the case of @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 , some possible solutions do in fact exist , but they are ruled out by the general form of the sum ( see @ xcite for more details ) . after determining the value of @ xmath12 for the sum , let us consider also @ xmath23 . since @ xmath23 is an absolute value of @ xmath22 , it is not possible to convert the sum to negative phase of @ xmath22 . the positive phase @ xmath22 is found by the perturbative method of qcdf , using the ##ening with positive n . for example @ xmath22 and @ xmath23 will be positive , like @ xmath48 , and a sign change in @ xmath22 will also change the sign of @ xmath23 . in contrast to the case of @ xmath12 , the hadronic phases @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 play a secondary role for @ xmath23 , as can be seen in ( [ crhoeta ]) . this can in turn allow the calculation of the experimental result for @ xmath23 . the interpretation of @ xmath23 becomes more straightforward if we take the upper bound and compare the values of @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 . an important result is the calculation of the sm , obtained by taking @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 from a rough sample and comparing the experimental expression for @ xmath23 with the experimental expression as a function of @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 . in fig . [ 2 : cpipi ] , a similar result is obtained by comparing values of and @ xmath23 in the ( @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 ) - plane , for the values of @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 . for the sm this is the relationship between the constant @ xmath40 and constant @ xmath23 . as it has been shown by @ xcite , a limit for the constant @ xmath23 exists , given by @ xmath49 with @ xmath50 and where the limit is for @ xmath51 . if @ xmath52 ,no explicit upper bound is known . however , if @ xmath53 , then @ xmath54 is equal for @ xmath55 , giving the conservative inequality @ xmath56 . for the upper bound @ xmath57 , @ xmath58 this gives @ xmath59 . the inequality on @ xmath23 can be derived by taking information on @ xmath22 , as well as on @ xmath60 , and using ( [ barc ] ) . combining @ xmath58 and @ xmath61 gives @ xmath62 . as has been shown by @ xcite , the following inequality can be derived from ( [ etataus ] ) for @ xmath63 @ xmath64 this inequality is not _ _ _ and requires additional information on the basis @ xmath22 . given that @ xmath65 , we combine @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 we find that this upper bound on @ xmath18 depends only on the observables @ xmath44 and @ xmath12 and is therefore independent of hadronic noise . since both @ xmath21 and @ xmath##22 although appearing to be very small , we assume that the lower limit ( [ etabound ] ) is a very good bound , corresponding to the maximum value of @ xmath18 itself ( see @ xcite for more details ) . we also assume that the upper limit ( [ etabound ] ) is the value for the unitarity triangle , the limit of half the number , @ xmath68 . in other words , the number - theoretical solutions for @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 are easily obtained by doing this and using @ xmath69 when constructing the unitarity triangle from @ xmath12 and @ xmath1 . let us first work on the first solution for @ xmath18 , which has the minus sign in place of the square root of ( [ etataus ] ) followed by the plus sign . for positive @ xmath12 this value is slightly greater than ( [ etataus ] ) and the result ( [ etabound ] ) is positive . for @ xmath70 the second solution is for positive @ xmath18 , which is unaffected by some assumptions about the coefficients ( for example from @ xmath71 ) . because we have given thefor @ xmath16 , angle @ xmath44 , the lower bound on @ xmath18 is equal to the lower bound on @ xmath72 . the constraint ( [ etabound ] ) can also be expressed as a lower bound on the angle @ xmath8 and a lower bound on @ xmath73 ( see @ xcite for more details ) . in fig . [ fig : etabound ] , we express the lower bound on @ xmath18 as a value of @ xmath12 for small values of @ xmath1 . from fig . [ fig : etabound ] we see that the lower bound on @ xmath18 becomes smaller as either @ xmath12 or @ xmath1 increases . in fig . [ fig : utbound ] we show the angle in the @ xmath74 problem that can be checked by the values of @ xmath1 and @ xmath12 with the same constraint ( [ etabound ] ) . we also show that the angle @ xmath75 , which is important for the problem , could be easily checked @ xcite by testing the angle - dependent cp - violation of @ xmath7##6 , the solid - state version of the @ xmath77 and @ xcite . in this article , we have proposed methods to obtain information about the interactions from cp violation observables in @ xmath0 decay , in the absence of hadronic pollution due to large penguin . with knowledge of the penguin parameters , an efficient prediction of wave - induced cp violation in @ xmath0 decay , induced by @ xmath12 , can be made by combining it with the same parameters from @ xmath2 , @ xmath1 , to form the unitarity values of @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 . the sensitivity of the hadronic parameters , which are the values @ xmath78 , @ xmath79 , is very low . in particular , there are no second - order terms in @ xmath22 . for the case of @ xmath22 the sensitivity is high . for our penguin parameters , the @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 , they were used extensively in the qcdf experiment . to make our penguin predictions , we have measured these parameters using the @ xmath29 and @ x##math30 ##0 , which provides a mathematical way to determine the uncalculable power law , solved the same problem . as an interesting result , we have also tried to derive @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 from the @ xmath3 # ##s , known as @ xmath36 and @ xmath37 , based on the su ( 2 ) theory . with these two new methods , we have a complete understanding of all these hadronic theories . i thank the authors for their work and i am especially grateful to gerhard buchalla for the most generous welcome . this book was published by the dfg under number bu 1391 / 1 - 2 . t . kobayashi and t . maskawa , prog . * 49 * ( 1973 ) 652 . m . cabibbo , phys . * 49 * ( 1963 ) 531 . j . aubert _ et al . _ [ abe collaboration ] , phys . rev . lett . * 87 * ( 2001 ) 091801 . j . abe _ et al . _ [ abe collaboration ] , phys . * 87 * ( 2001 ) 091802 . the string theory project , + http : / / www . the##ac . berkeley . edu / xorg / hfag / g . buchalla and a . s . safir , ph - ph / 0406016 ; a . s . safir , ph - ph / 0311104 . g . buchalla and a . s . safir , phys . * 51 * ( 2004 ) 021801 ##1 . wolfenstein , phys . rev . lett . * 50 * ( 1983 ) 1945 ; a . l . smith , _ et al . _ * 550 * ( 1994 ) 3433 . j . beneke _ et al . _ , d * 606 * ( 2001 ) 245 ckmfitter working group , lp2003 conference , dec . 2003 , http : / / ckmfitter . in2p3 . org
