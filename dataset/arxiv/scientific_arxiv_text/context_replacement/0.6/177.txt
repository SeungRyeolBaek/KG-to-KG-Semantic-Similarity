the main goal of reconstruction is to study the internal structure of an object without damaging it , using the data obtained by experiments that leave the object under investigation intact . these data can be obtained by observing the interaction between the object and various types of radiation like x - rays , ultrasound , and many others . through the interaction with the object under investigation , the probe is able to form what we call a 3d image or tomogram , see fig . [ fig : profiles ] . reconstruction is a rapidly growing field for its broad impact on problems of applied physics and for its many applications such as the development of computational algorithms related to many fields , such as biology , medicine and archaeometry . also , it can be a useful tool for solving other problems arising from other fields of research , such as physics , quantum mechanics and optics , optics , spectroscopy , spectroscopy and many others , see fig . [ fig : profiles ] . from the mathematical point of view the reconstruction problem can be formulated as follows : one has to recover an unknown function from the knowledge of an infinite number of fourier transforms . it was shown by y . chen @ xcite that a known function @ xmath0 ##2 @ xmath##1 can be obtained simply by computation of the integral over the points in @ xmath1 . let @ xmath2 be the integral of @ xmath3 over the points @ xmath4 ( tomogram ) . let @ xmath5 where @ xmath6 is the laplacian of @ xmath1 , and the square root is given by fourier transform ( see also [ see : inversioneformula ] ) . we can see that the formula above has changed in a simple way : if we integrate over the set of points on a line , then we integrate over the set of lines passing through a given point . this formula can be extended to the @ xmath7 - dimensional plane by computing the integral of the functions @ xmath3 over all possible hyperplanes . this allows to use the formula @ xmath8 , as above . if @ xmath3 is the function on @ xmath9 then @ xmath10 is the function defined over the set of all possible @ xmath11 - dimensional points in @ xmath9 such that , in a hyperplane @ xmath12 , the integral of @ xmath13is given by the integral of @ xmath3 and @ xmath12 . the integral @ xmath10 is the _ fourier transform _ of @ xmath3 . there are several important applications of the fourier transform : taylor @ xcite , gelfand @ xcite , helgason @ xcite and strichartz @ xcite . more rigorous work has been done by igor and volodya manko and has focused on symplectic geometry @ xcite , on the mathematical relationship with quantum mechanics and fourier analysis @ xcite , on the theory of inner product functions @ xcite , and on the theory of marginals of functions that are not smooth @ @ xcite . in quantum mechanics the fourier transform of the wave function @ xcite was introduced in the tomographic approach to the study of quantum mechanics @ xcite and was used with many applications and in many textbooks . for a description of the various practical applications of classical and quantum mechanics see @ xcite . more information about the tomographic approach can be found at @ xcite and max @ xcite , where the emphasis is placed on maximum likelihood methods , that allow one to obtain the most accurate estimates from the observed data .is unknown . as mentioned above , from the mathematical point of view , the 3d structure of the image is represented by an unknown function @ xmath3 ( equations ) , that is related via the equations to the corresponding function @ xmath14 ( tomograms ) . the tomographic reconstruction problem can be solved as follows : for the function @ xmath14 , the goal is to recover @ xmath3 from the corresponding function @ xmath15 . there are several reasons related to the nature of the tomographic reconstruction and to the nature of the reconstruction problem . there are three main causes of this problem . the first reason is the ill - posedness of the reconstruction problem : in order to obtain a precise estimate of the unknown function there is required an extremely precise estimate of the tomograms , which is in general almost impossible @ xcite . the second reason is the sparse and often complex nature of data that allows to obtain only an estimate of the unknown function . the third reason is whether the given function only identifies the function itself . the final answer is given by a theorem of smith , smith and smith @ xcite , that states : ` ` a function @ xmath3 with finite support in the domain identifies .not by a finite number , but by a finite number of finite tomograms ' ' . therefore , it is clear that one has to follow the approach of experts in the field of reconstruction . however , due to the ill - posedness of the problems and to the lack of resolution of the reconstruction problem , a new approach has to be introduced to replace the method . this new approach is the use of the mumford - smith ( ms ) functional , first introduced in a research paper for image denoising and reconstruction @ xcite . the main difference is that , like many scientific fields , it is not only interested in the reconstruction of the unknown function @ xmath3 , but also in the reconstruction of the specific properties or properties of the function . an example is the problem of the reconstruction of the density of internal canals . by using the ms functional , one can obtain not only ( an approximation of ) the function but also its properties ##ness . more recently a new approach for application to reconstruction has been introduced in the literature @ xcite . some important problems in this area are already known . there are also many more important problems and new developments in this area , which we will have to see in the next part ofthis follows . the section is organized as follows . section [ sec : fourier ] is a short introduction to the fourier transform , the phase transform and the ms method . section [ sec : electron ] is devoted to a short discussion of the well - posedness of the tomographic method and to the introduction of new methods . in section [ sec : electron ] the ms method is applied to electrons as a general method . in addition , in section [ subsec : electron ] the piecewise linear approximation and new methods are discussed together with a short discussion of some important theoretical problems . finally , in section [ sec : 3dinterpretation ] we have an improved version of the ms method based on the ms functional , which allows us to propose an improved ms method , based on the fourier - zisserman equation @ xcite , and a simplified version of the original method . imagine a body in the space @ xmath1 , and imagine a beam of particles ( ions , electrons , x - rays , etc . ) emitted from the body . assume that the total intensity of the beam is @ xmath16 . when the particles pass through the body they are absorbed or scattered and the intensity of the beamthen the ray @ xmath17 increases by an amount proportional to the length of the ray @ xmath18 , and @ xmath19 so that @ xmath20 the line located in the center of the line records the total density @ xmath21 and then from @ xmath22 one can record the integral of the density @ xmath18 based on this line . if a line with a different length is used , with the same length one records the integral of the integral of the density on that line . the mathematical solution of the above problem is the following : given a smooth function @ xmath23 , the line , @ xmath24 , and the line @ xmath12 , is a tomogram , given by @ xmath25 where @ xmath26 is the longest distance of the line @ xmath12 . in this case , we have defined an algorithm @ xmath27 that transforms a smooth function @ xmath3 on the line @ xmath1 into a function @ xmath10 with @ xmath28 , the length of the line at @ xmath1 . we ask the following question : if we count the number of tomog##rams @ xmath29 , can we use the original function @ xmath3 ? the result is : and in the following we can show how to prove this theorem . let us extend the above result to the case of an @ xmath7 - dimensional manifold . let @ xmath3 be a function defined on @ xmath9 , integrable on the hyperplane in @ xmath9 and let @ xmath30 be the set of all hyperplanes in @ xmath9 . the fourier transform of @ xmath3 is given by : . ( [ \ n ] ) , where @ xmath26 is the maximum distance on the hyperplane @ xmath12 . then we have an operator @ xmath27 , the _ projection operator _ , that transforms a function @ xmath3 on @ xmath9 into a function @ xmath10 on @ xmath31 , or @ xmath32 . the second operator , also the _ _ projection operator _ , @ xmath33 maps to a function @ xmath14 on @ xmath31 the function @ xmath34 on @ xmath9 is .@ xmath35 where @ xmath36 is the minimum probability value for the point in @ xmath37 which is equal to the choice of points in @ xmath38 . consider the unit vector @ xmath39 from the origin and the unit vector @ xmath40 corresponding to @ xmath12 . , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] let us consider the differential equation of @ xmath30 @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 is the unit vector of @ xmath9 . then , the area of the hyperplane @ xmath12 is @ xmath43 with @ xmath44 being the linear inner product of @ xmath45 . [ 1 : 1 . ] . suppose that the points @ xmath46 are embedded into the same hyperplane @ xmath47 . if ( [ double cover ] ) is a double cover of @ xmath30 . then @ xmath30 has a double cover structure with respect to which this linear structure is continuous . we replace continuous ( continuous ) functions @ xmath14 and @ xmath30 with continuous ( continuous ) functions @ xmath14 .@ xmath48 on @ xmath49 . we will then write down the schwartz sequence @ xmath50 of real - valued and complex functions on @ xmath9 . in connection with @ xmath50 we define @ xmath51 as the set of @ xmath52 functions @ xmath14 on @ xmath48 which for any function @ xmath53 , any multiindex @ xmath54 , and any linear combination @ xmath55 and @ xmath42 on @ xmath56 the set @ xmath57 is then defined as the set of @ xmath58 functions @ xmath59 . here we want to find the inverse function , and we want to show that we can construct the function @ xmath3 on @ xmath9 from the inverse of the original function . in order to do this , we need a mathematical proof , whose proof can be found in @ xcite , which has an alternative mathematical proof . [ see notation ] where @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 , @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 . let @ xmath64 where @ xmath65depending only on the dimension @ xmath7 , and @ xmath66 is the inner product , @ xmath67 is the potential at @ xmath38 generated by the distribution at @ xmath3 . , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] a simple consequence of the [ integral equation ] is the following : if @ xmath3 is a probability distribution , then the potential at the dimension @ xmath38 generated by that distribution is at @ xmath68 , shown below . [ fig : inversion ] . note , however , that the potential of the point charge is associated with the inverse function _ of _ of the distribution @ xmath7 , and that it is not invariant for @ xmath69 . the only dependence of @ xmath7 is in the case of the point charge @ xmath65 . this dependence is denoted : here , the inverse poisson function is the @ xmath7 - th ( negative ) derivative of the laplacian , which results in the following formula for the integral equation . [ fig : inversioneformula ] let @ xmath60 . let @ xmath70 where@ xmath71 , with @ xmath72 , is a pseudodifferential function whose inverse is @ xmath73 where @ xmath74 is the inverse transform of @ xmath3 , @ xmath75 the proof of the [ equation : inversioneformula ] can be found at @ xcite . net ( [ inversion formula0 ] ) note that , modulo the absolute value of @ xmath76 , the function @ xmath3 can be obtained from its linear analog @ xmath10 by the use of the linear transformation @ xmath77 : first one transforms over the set of points in a hyperplane and then one transforms over the set of hyperplanes passing through the given point . thus we have @ xmath78 which is the most straightforward transformation . note that if one takes the point @ xmath79 , then the function @ xmath80 is defined on the axis corresponding to @ xmath40 , i . e . it is a ( continuous ) plane curve . finally , equation . ( [ inversion formula ] ) gives a description of @ xmath3 in terms of a continuous planeof plane waves . a well - known wave function is defined by fourier transform . when @ xmath81 , one has the following formula ( [ th : radoninversion ] ) , given by theorem @ xcite . we have defined the fourier transform of the function @ xmath82 to @ xmath10 . the corresponding theorem @ xcite gives the definition of the domain of the fourier transform at @ xmath27 and the extension of @ xmath27 to the domain of square integrable functions @ xmath83 . [ th : radonbijection ] the fourier transform @ xmath27 is a linear one - to - one map of @ xmath50 onto @ xmath84 , where the function @ xmath84 is defined as follows : @ xmath85 if and only if @ xmath86 and for any function @ xmath87 the function @ xmath88 is a homogeneous function of degree @ xmath89 to @ xmath90 . similarly , the linear map @ xmath27 can be extended to a linear map from @ xmath83 and @ xmat##h91 . in medical research , spectral analysis is a widely used method for the determination of the density @ xmath3 of a sample from measurements of the intensity of x - ray light passing through the sample at different frequencies and directions . the collected data @ xmath14 is connected to the data @ xmath3 via the neural network @ xmath92 . to determine the density of @ xmath3 the problem @ xmath93 has to be solved . but it is a well known fact that @ xmath27 is not locally stable like @ xmath91 @ xcite , and this means that the problem of inversion is ill - posed . for this reason , new methods have to be developed to perform the analysis in the absence of energy loss . we consider ill - posed problems , in the context of linear maps from hilbert space @ xcite . let @ xmath94 be hilbert space and let @ xmath95 be a continuous linear map from @ xmath96 into @ xmath97 . the problem @ xmath98 was called ill - posed by hadamard ( 1932 ) if it is not .for all @ xmath99 and if the solution is only on @ xmath14 . then , ( [ prob : inverseproblem ] ) is also ill - posed . this means that for an ill - posed problem the solution @ xmath100 either does not exist , or is not defined on all of @ xmath97 , and is not bounded . the main problem with an ill - posed problem is that even if it is bounded , the solution of @ xmath101 will not be close to the solution of @ xmath102 if @ xmath103 is close to @ xmath14 . in general @ xmath100 is not a continuous function . to prove this we use the idea of a class of @ xmath100 . this is the class @ xmath104 of ordinary differential operators @ xmath105 which is defined on all @ xmath97 and for which @ xmath106 is the boundary of @ xmath100 . define @ xmath107 and @ xmath108 if @ xmath100 is not bounded . with the help of this solution we can define ( [ prob: inverseproblem ] ) , in the same way . let @ xmath109 be an approximation to @ xmath14 such that @ xmath110 . let @ xmath111 be such that , as @ xmath112 , @ xmath113 then , as @ xmath112 , @ xmath114 then , @ xmath115 is close to @ xmath116 if @ xmath103 is close to @ xmath14 . the density @ xmath117 is called _ _ _ _ _ . finding a probability density distribution is one of the starting points for the development of statistical methods . there are several methods for finding a density : the standard # ##ity method , the method of tikhonov - phillips and the alternative method @ xcite . in the next section we describe a general method based on the properties of the mumford - fisher density distribution . in many statistical applications one is not only interested in the estimation of the density of @ xmath3 but also in the analysis of the random variables of the sample which affect the density distribution of the distribution . for example , the density ofthis may include the study of the boundaries of normal organs like heart and lungs and the boundaries of neurons and stem cells . analyzing a 3d image involves analyzing its _ homogeneous regions _ and its _ edges _ , its _ screens _ . of course , the homogeneous regions are assumed to correspond to the edges of objects in the 3d world , and the edges to their corresponding edges . the mumford - shah variational model is one of the simplest models of image processing . it treats the image processing as a simple vertex / edge detection problem : given an image @ xmath118 , one has created a ` ` piecewise linear image ' ' @ xmath119 with a set @ xmath120 of the edges , the ` ` edges ' ' of @ xmath14 . the basic mumford - shah model @ xcite , is the following : @ xmath121 where * @ xmath122 is an open set ( _ screen _ ) ; * @ xmath123 is a closed set ( _ set of edges _ ) ; * @ xmath124 ( _ screen _ ) ; * @ xmath125 is the partial order of @ xmat##h126 ; * @ xmath127 is the function ( _ digital parameters _ ) ; * @ xmath128 is the ( _ digital parameters _ ) ; * @ xmath129 is the @ xmath11 - dimensional hausdorff space . the cartoon @ xmath130 - function ( [ defn : jms ] ) plays the role of a boundary constraint : it requires that the cartoon @ xmath126 matches the cartoon @ xmath14 . the second term in the functional requires that the cartoon @ xmath126 be piecewise flat like the normal cartoon @ xmath120 . in other words this function requires smooth zones rather than zones where a thin layer of color is required to transition smoothly from white to black . viceversa . } the third term in the functional requires that the cartoon @ xmath120 be ` ` ' ' ' and as flat as possible . what is obtained from the application of this function is a smooth , cartoon - like reconstruction of the original cartoon together with its inverse . see ref . [ 1 : cartooneye ] . the inverse of the @ xmath131it is a compromise between smoothing and smoothing . the compromise depends on the two parameters @ xmath132 and @ xmath133 which play different roles . the parameter @ xmath132 represents how much the function @ xmath126 will vary , if @ xmath132 is small , more of @ xmath126 is allowed , and as @ xmath132 increases @ xmath126 tends to become a piecewise constant function . the parameter @ xmath133 represents the scale factor of the image and also the number of edges : if @ xmath133 is small , a lot of edges are allowed and we have a coarse image . as @ xmath133 increases , the image becomes coarse . for more information on the compromise see the research article @ xcite , and the article @ xcite . ) . center : center of the image of the mumford - smith character ( cartoon @ xmath120 ) . edge : piecewise constant function of the functional ( cartoon @ xmath126 ) @ xcite . , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] the result of the @ x##math134 function in ( [ defn : jms ] ) is defined among the edge pairs @ xmath135 such that @ xmath120 is free and @ xmath136 . it is worth noting that in this case there are two sets : the free set @ xmath126 and the set @ xmath120 of the function . for this reason this class of problems is sometimes called ` ` ' dual problem ' ' . existence of minimizers of the @ xmath134 functional in ( [ defn : jms ] ) was proved by de giorgi , carriero , leaci in @ xcite in the case of the case of without hilbert space ( see sbv ) and by ambrosio and de giorgi in @ xcite . the following algorithms for image reconstruction in the mumford - moore model are described in @ xcite . here we present a reconstruction of the above algorithm , similar to the inverse transform of the fourier transform . more precisely , we present a reconstruction procedure that preserves the edge pairs associated with images , i . e . a reconstruction that is both a reconstruction and a reconstruction of@ xmath3 ( assumed to be represented by @ xmath137 ) , from the density tomograms @ xmath14 , based on the reconstruction of the mumford - shah density of @ xmath138 the main difference between the functionals @ xmath134 and @ xmath139 is the first term , i . e . the weak term , that means that the space for @ xmath3 is close enough to the space of the density @ xmath140 , whereas the other terms play exactly the same role as for the density @ xmath134 . as mentioned above , in addition to the reconstruction of the density @ xmath3 , we are interested in the reconstruction of the space of @ xmath120 , i . e . the space of points where the density @ xmath3 is zero . the main difference with respect to the original mumford - shah model ( [ defn : jms ] ) is that we have to convert the information about the space of weak interactions of @ xmath14 ( and hence , the results of the fourier transform ) into information about the weak .of @ xmath3 . next we will use the bounds obtained by ramlau and by @ xcite for the case of ( [ def : msfunctional ] ) relative to piecewise constant functions @ xmath3 , and then for the other two cases . for clinical applications , it is often a good idea to restrict the problem to sets @ xmath3 that are defined with respect to the region of the body , where the majority of the muscles , bones , and tissues have their constant values . we define the domain @ xmath141 as the space of piecewise constant functions that have at most @ xmath142 of constant values , where @ xmath55 is an open and closed subset of @ xmath9 . in other words , the @ xmath143 is a linear combination of @ xmath142 and the @ xmath144 of the @ xmath145 which are @ xmath146 we assume that the @ xmath147 value is constant relative to @ xmath55 and we use @ xmath148 for the value of @ xmath147 with respect to the region corresponding to the data set @ x##math55 . in this case the solution set can be written as the union of the sets of @ xmath147 ##s . for these , it is necessary to use the _ nondegeneracy _ property of the solution sets of @ xmath55 : @ xmath149 for all @ xmath150 , for all @ xmath151 , where @ xmath152 is the lebesgue measure of @ xmath9 . it turns out to be possible to split the data , in a previous example , @ xmath153 into a ` ` functional ' ' part given by the @ xmath142 - tuple of pairwise independent values @ xmath154 which maps @ xmath55 s to a polynomial of degree , and a ` ` functional ' ' part given by the @ xmath142 - tuple of values @ xmath155 . we can use the data @ xmath156 , for the solution @ xmath157 of @ xmath147 . as usual when dealing with optimization problems , we have to assume that the solution @ xmath14 is not already known ,suppose that we are now given two parallel tomograms @ xmath103 of the ( nearly ) complete data set @ xmath14 with @ xmath158 . if we set the function ( [ def : msfunctional ] ) to zero at @ xmath141 we find that the error term ( for the value of @ xmath3 ) is , so it is to minimize the domain @ xmath159 and @ xmath141 , with respect to the linear variable @ xmath160 ( a partition of @ xmath142 values ) and the nonlinear variable @ xmath161 ( a partition of the domain @ xmath55 with at least @ xmath142 in values satisfying the ε - condition ( [ nondegeneracy - cond ] ) ) . thus the goal is to minimize @ xmath162 and that @ xmath163 where @ xmath164 it is clear that @ xmath165 will depend on the values of @ xmath133 and on the order of @ xmath166 . thus we can compute the value of the functional @ xmath##167 ##7 ( [ functional : jbeta ] ) . there are some technical details needed for the complete proof and proof of the theorem , for which we refer to the original proof @ xcite . here we will give a simplified version of the theorem with the intention of reaching the following results , without too many technical details . the first result is regarding the existence of minimizers of the functional @ xmath167 in ( [ functional : jbeta ] ) . for all @ xmath168 there is a minimizer @ xmath169 of the functional @ xmath167 in ( [ functional : jbeta ] ) , with @ xmath170 . the second result concerns the linear ##ity of the minimizers of the functional @ xmath167 in ( [ functional : jbeta ] ) on the lower bound @ xmath166 . let @ xmath171 be the product of values in @ xmath172 and in @ xmath168 . for all @ xmath173 , let @ xmath174 be the minimizers of the functional @ xmath167 with the value @ xmath175 . if @ x##math176 , @ xmath172 , and @ xmath177 , so there is a subset of @ xmath174 such that @ xmath178 is @ xmath179 , and @ xmath180 is a minimizer of @ xmath167 with initial data @ xmath103 . similarly , the inverse of any such subset of @ xmath174 is a minimizer of @ xmath167 with initial data @ xmath103 . then the final result is a convergence theorem . let @ xmath181 be constant , @ xmath182 and then @ xmath183 . then we have initial data @ xmath168 with @ xmath184 . let us denote the functional @ xmath185 with the function @ xmath186 and @ xmath187 with @ xmath112 . for the function @ xmath188 , and @ xmath189 denote the minimizers of the functional @ xmath190 with initial data @ xmath175 and the function @ xmath19##1 . suppose there is a unique solution of @ xmath189 . then , for a unique solution with value @ xmath192 the number @ xmath193 is a solution of the equation @ xmath194 with a unique solution . and if @ xmath195 is the unique solution of this equation then the entire function is @ xmath196 when @ xmath197 . finally , let us address some important questions in this section : * is the nondegeneracy condition ( [ nondegeneracy - cond ] ) satisfied ? * can we find an a priori maximum value for the function @ xmath142 of all values ? * is it possible to obtain an a priori bound on the @ xmath198 - value of the function ( maximum value ) ? * and finally , it would be very easy for us to prove the existence of minimizers of the function @ xmath139 when restricted to piecewise linear functions @ xmath3 . we see that all these problems are very simple , and have been completely solved in the form of the first mumford - taylor function @ xmath13##4 . ( [ defn : jms ] ) , for e . g . @ xcite . in this section we restrict our discussion to the @ xmath199 - 1 case . we present an improved version of the inversion formula based on the formula @ xmath139 presented in the previous section . the aim is to give a mathematical interpretation of the interaction of @ xmath200 and the system ( [ def : msfunctional ] ) , that gives the basis for an effective inversion algorithm . for @ xmath69 , the inversion formula ( [ inversion formula0 ] ) and the multiplication formula ( [ def : electid ] ) are , respectively , as follows : for all @ xmath201 one gets @ xmath202 and @ xmath203 where @ xmath61 and @ xmath204 is a pair . we have two important results . [ def : normrf ] for all real numbers @ xmath201 one gets @ xmath205 we see that @ xmath206 , and @ xmath207 ( x ) \ , { \ mathcal { x } } ( { \mathcal { r } } { f } ) ( x ) \ ; \ textrm { r } | \ nonumber \ \ & & = \ frac { 1 } { - ( - \ 1 ) ^ 3 } \ int _ { { \ mathbb { r } } ^ 2 } | \ nabla { \ mathcal { r } } ( { \ mathcal { r } } { f } ) ( x ) | ^ 2 \ ;

if we apply to @ xmath3 first the density operator @ xmath27 and then its adjoint @ xmath77 we obtain , up to some factor , the electric field generated by thecharge distribution @ xmath3 . this property can be found in the term @ xmath7 : the limit with electric potential only in dimension @ xmath7 is that , in general , the potential produced by the measured charge distribution looks like @ xmath220 , which is the limit of electric potential only in dimension @ xmath199 . from the general ##ization of the above equation we can see that the fidelity term of the term @ xmath139 , implies that the electric potential produced by the charge distribution @ xmath3 must be equal to the ` ` measured electric potential ' ' . thus we conclude that the term @ xmath221 is the fidelity term in this general case . using this formula based on the general properties of the tomographic model , we first try to find the fidelity functionals for the two terms @ xmath222 ( magnetic potential ) and @ xmath223 ( electric potential ) and then calculate the term @ xmath3 ( charge distribution ) . we calculate the term @ xmath139 as follows : @ xmath224 where @ xmath225 is a certain term based on the value of @ xmat##h222 and given the set @ xmath120 , and we observe the fact that @ xmath226 , since @ xmath222 is finite . we find that the functional @ xmath227 is a second order function for the finite set @ xmath222 , which is the property of the set @ xmath120 that is the set of elements of @ xmath3 and that is the set of elements of @ xmath228 . for the function @ xmath225 we find some examples with a related second - order multiple - choice model : the blake - zisserman measure . this model is based on the property of the blake - zisserman measure @ xmath229 among finite sets @ xmath230 , where * @ xmath122 is an open set ; * @ xmath231 are closed sets ; * @ xmath232 is the set of elements of @ xmath233 ( open sets ) , and @ xmath234 the the set of elements of @ xmath235 ( closed( ) ; * @ xmath236 , @ xmath237 is a vector field ; * @ xmath238 is the inverse laplacian of @ xmath233 ; * @ xmath239 denotes the intensity ( the intensity vector of the original picture ) ; * @ xmath240 is constant ; * @ xmath129 is the @ xmath11 - dimensional hausdorff space . the katz - zisserman function is a more precise calculation than the mumford - moore function in the sense that only the size of the image of the original picture is considered . on the other hand , minimizers do not always exist , depending on the size of the parameters @ xmath241 and on the summability of parameters @ xmath242 . we refer to @ xcite for description and analysis of variational approaches to image processing and digital signal processing . in particular see @ xcite for details of minimizer theory and @ xcite for the proof to theorem and @ xcite for results on the theory of minimizers . theorem ( [ eqnaeeay _ 1 ] ) states that the function @ xmath##139 can be expressed in terms of the electric potential @ xmath222 and of the moments set of @ xmath228 , i . e . the number of moments of @ xmath222 , using the assumptions of the blake - zisserman model . the fact that for the potential @ xmath225 the moments set of @ xmath222 is not included depends on the fact that we are assuming that the energy function @ xmath3 and the potential @ xmath139 do not depend on points but on lines . if we have no boundary conditions we can treat the blake - zisserman model for the transfer function @ xmath222 as a simplified version of the mumford - moore model for the potential @ xmath3 . in other words we want to replace the relationship between minimizers of @ xmath139 and minimizers of the second linear functional @ xmath243 : @ xmath244 with the linear functional @ xmath245 . the main advantage of this approach is that the potential @ xmath243 is a second linear model , like the functional @ xmath139 .the integro - differential equation . we know that the solutions of the maxwell - zisserman equation that could be translated into tomographic terms would give some useful results for us . however , the unique tomographic properties of the free vector field of the functional @ xmath222 , the fact that its value may not be constant and the non - constant @ xmath246 , suggest new research directions in the field of mean - field theory . for example , an important result in this area would be the existence of the boundary conditions for the functional @ xmath247 that ensure that the charge density @ xmath3 does not change . we start this section with two examples : * we know that the vector fields @ xmath14 are exactly the free vector fields generated by the negative charge density , so the term @ xmath200 in the equation has a constant factor in the classical sense . * the problem of the solution of the functional could be translated into a reconstruction problem for the electric field . the electric field is an irrotational vector field , so the resulting reconstruction problem is called a classical one . in order to do this , we could usethe theory also takes account of the vector potential @ xmath223 ( @ xmath248 ) , a first - order function of which the first term is @ xmath249 where the coefficients are given by ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) . * all this calculations are done in dimension @ xmath199 . in the higher dimension @ xmath250 the situation is quite different because the above expression for the fourier transform is a ( possibly infinite ) expansion of the laplacian . in this case the first approximation of as described in this section fails . in order to achieve stability , it is necessary to use the fourier - fourier transform which involves inversion of @ xmath3 on linear maps with codimension @ xmath251 so that @ xmath252 , i . e . @ xmath253 , and e . g . @ xcite . we thank g . devillanova , g . rossi and g . maddalena for for their assistance . this work was funded by ` ` fondazione cassa di risparmio di torino ' ' and by the italian national institute of nuclear physics ( gnfm- indam ) .
