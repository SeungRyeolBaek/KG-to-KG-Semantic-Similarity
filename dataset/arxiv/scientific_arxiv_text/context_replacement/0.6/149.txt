for the special cases in general , the conserved quantity is usually expressed in terms of the terms of the coupling constant @ xmath0 with integer coefficients , so that in the next - to - next - to - next - to - next case ( or @ xmath4lo ) we have @ xmath5 where @ xmath6 is a constant , and @ xmath7 is a real number . therefore , the value @ xmath8 is the one - electron value . the governing equations are the following : 1 . the hadronic model of @ xmath1 - 1 [ @ xcite @ xmath9 } { \ left [ \ tau \ to \ alpha _ { \ tau } } ^ + \ pi _ 1 ] } = \ nonumber \ \ & & { \ cal ##c } _ { \ tau } ^ { [ 1 ] } \ , ( ) + c _ 1 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ tau } + c _ 1 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ left ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ tau} \ right ) ^ 2 + m _ { ^ { \ tau } \ , \ left ( \ frac { \ alpha _ { ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ , } \ right ) ^ 2 + \ , m _ { \ mbox { \ tau } } } \ left ) , \ end { 1 : 1 } \ end { align } \ ] ] where @ xmath10 } = 0 . 058 $ ] , the coefficients are given by @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 in a nonperturbative form . the hadronic form of @ xmath2 - 1 is @ xcite @ xmath13 } { \ , [ \ eta _ s \ to \ , \ , ] } = { \ cal ##c } _ { \ eta _ s } ^ { [ 2 ] } \ , ( 1 + n _ c \ , \ frac { \ eta _ s ( \ ##n _ c ) } { \ pi } \ right ) , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath14 } = \ frac { c _ f } { 2n _ c } \ , \ frac { e } { c _ f ^ {} \ , \ frac { \ alpha _ 2 ^ { ( 2m _ 1 ) } { \ alpha ^ 2 _ { \ rm ##l } } \ ] ] with @ xmath15 , @ xmath16 is the number of flavors , @ xmath17 is the total mass of the particle , and the result @ xmath18 is given by @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 is the number of ` n ' flavors , and @ xmath21 is the total mass of the particle . the following method can be used for the calculation of @ xmath0 at the same time . the number of @ xmath0 - particles is not known . therefore , the problem is how the standard model can be extracted . the well - known solution to the problem of solving the problem is the resummation of the unknown ##s . we have two of these methods . the first is the calculation of @ xmath22 times , where @ xmath23 is the first term of @ xmath24 - term of the @ xcite . the second method is based on an alternative choice of renormalization group from @ xmath25 to the solution .for the same reason , which allows us to take a number of second - order corrections or even to replace them with the values of @ xmath26 - dominance resulting in a better approximation of @ xmath27 @ xcite . the advantages of these methods are two . first , the second - order corrections when applied , will not differ from the value of @ xmath28 - dominance . second , the choice of renormalization group leads to the scale and second - scale dependence of the coefficients . in this case we propose a method to calculate the power law in the language of renormalization theory by adding an additional term and using the second - order coefficients . the first method is presented in section [ sec : 2 ] . the best results are presented in section [ sec : 3 ] . the calculation of scale dependence for the @ xmath2 - dominance method is straightforward , since the calculation of the residual ##s avoids the scale dependence caused by the scale dependence of @ xmath21 and the change of scale factor of the @ xmath3 - function @ xmath29 @ xcite . our results are presented in sections . for the sake of simplicity , let us start with the calculation of scale -step 3 . @ xmath30 } = 2 + c _ 1 \ frac { \ beta _ 0 ( \ pi ) } { \ beta } . \ ] ] with an extra term @ xmath31 , so that @ xmath32 makes use of the renormalization group up to the second order . @ xmath0 , @ xmath33 we can calculate @ xmath34 ^ { \ displaystyle \ frac { { ##c _ 1 } { \ beta _ { \ ln \ pi } } , \ ] ] which is the first order limit on the renormalization group . after , that one gets the form @ xmath35 which can be used for the same result to a higher order as @ xmath0 . the extra - order limit of @ xmath36 can be directly calculated @ xmath37 , \ ] ] which gives our result for the case of first - order corrections . in order to deal with the first - order limit , let us do the calculation in first order . first , the @ xmath24 - series has the form @ xmath38 with @ xmath39 . to the second order limit is @ xmath40 , \ ]] = @ xmath36 . 0 , @ xmath41 ^ { \ displaystyle \ frac { { c _ 1 } { \ alpha _ s \ ln \ kappa } } \ approx \ exp \ , [ c _ 1 \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ lambda } \ , ] , \ ] ] and , since @ xmath0 , we rederive the renormalization group expansion ( rgi ) for the second - order correction . thus , we can now expand the rgi for the second order correction @ xmath0 ( since @ xmath4lo ) . then , since @ xmath42 , \ ] ] we have @ xmath43 ^ { \ displaystyle \ frac { c _ 1 + 16 \ bar c _ 1 \ , { \ mathfrak a } + 16 \ bar c _ 1 \ , { \ mathfrak a } ^ 2 } { \ beta _ 0 + \ beta _ 1 \ , { \ mathfrak a } + \ beta _ 2 \ , { \ mathfrak a } ^ 2 } \ frac { { } { \ ln \ kappa ^ 2 } } = \ math##p \ left [ c _ 1 \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ lambda } + \ bar c _ 2 \ left ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ pi } \ right ) + \ bar c _ 2 \ , ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ pi } \ left ) \ right ] , \ ] ] where we put @ xmath44 \ , @ xmath0 , @ xmath36 , we put @ xmath45 ^ { \ displaystyle \ frac { c _ 1 + 16 \ bar c _ 2 \ , { \ mathfrak a } + 16 \ bar c _ 2 \ , { \ mathfrak a } ^ 2 } { \ beta _ 0 + \ beta _ 1 \ , { \ mathfrak a } + \ beta _ 2 \ , { \ mathfrak a } ^ 2 } \ frac { 1 } { \ ln \ lambda ^ 2 } } \ approx 1 + c _ 1 \ , \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ lambda } + c _ 2 \ , \ left ( \ frac {\ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ pi } \ right ) ^ 3 + a _ s \ , \ left ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( \ lambda ) } { \ pi } \ left ) ^ 3 . \ ] ] thus , the first - order matrix now takes the form @ xmath46 \ ] ] we use the renormalization group of ##s in the to _ _ hoc _ construction of the approximants . let us see how the construction works with a simple matrix . first , we get a very simple matrix , @ xmath47 which has a ` simple ' sum , since @ xmath48 } = 1 , \ quad { \ cal e } ^ { [ 1 ] } = 0 . 5 , \ quad { \ cal e } ^ { [ 2 ] } = 0 . 61 , \ ] ] [ @ xmath49 \ ] ] \ { @ xmath50 } = 1 , \ quad { \ cal e } ^ { \ mbox { \ sc rgi } } _ { [ 2 ] } = 0 . 5 , \ quad { \ cal e } ^ { \ mbox { \ sc rgi } } _ { [ 3 ]} = 0 . 5 , \ ] ] which is ` ` bad ' . therefore , we note that @ xmath51 has a greater numerical advantage than the previous method . of course , if the series is not stable , the method does not produce a ` good ' series . so , we try to solve the same series , but with the @ xmath0 - correction to the units and the error , if those units are too large . thus , the correction to the amplitude @ xmath52 } ( 1 + c _ 1 \ alpha _ s ) \ ] ] should reduce to @ xmath53 } \ , ) ^ { ( 1 + c \ , c _ 1 \ alpha _ s ) , \ ] ] so that the amplitude @ xmath54 never changes from 1 . the rgi has the problem the same , since the method does not show the same results . finally , we note that the rgi does not use any kind of resummation of first order . for the resummation , one usually uses a number of first - order terms . in general , we use the same formula given by the renormalization group . since the @ xmath0 -judging by the perturbative uncertainty , the formula should expand up to the appropriate order . thus , one could say that the rgi effect is like half the universe . to my advantage , we should use the rgi formula as a reference measure of the decay energy , as the expansion up to the appropriate order would give a better method of numerical integration . the rgi formula for the @ xmath1 - [ decay into ] = { @ xmath55 } \ , \ { \ exp \ , [ c _ 1 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ tau } + \ bar c _ 1 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ left ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ tau } \ right ) ^ 2 + \ bar c _ 2 ^ { \ tau } \ , \ left ( \ frac { \ alpha _ s ( m _ { \ tau } ) } { \ tau } \ right ) ^ 2 \ right ] + \ bar c _ { \ mbox { \ , k } } \ , \ } , \ bar { 1 : 1##a } \ , { b } \ ] ] where @ xmath56 = @ xmath57 we get @ xmath58 which reads in @ xmath59 where we consider the experimental data , and . for the sake of simplicity , the pdg , extracted from the experimental measurement of @ xmath1 also reads in @ xmath60 which also gives @ xmath61 . we point out that the relative value of pdg is much higher , to our expectations , since the use of the energy scale in both measurements gives @ xmath62 . therefore , the correct choice of scale , extracted from the @ xmath1 - experiment hadronic experiment is given by @ xmath63 with the central axis parallel to the ` horizon line ' . the problem with the measurement of hadronic energy of @ xmath2 - charmonium is simple . first , the scale used in the @ xmath0 - experiment is in the limit , since this scale corresponds to @ xmath65 . second , we should denote the energy as { @ xmath66 } \ , ( 1 + ) _ 1 \ , \ frac { \ } _ 1 (\ left ) } { \ right } \ right ) . \ left { 1 : 4a } \ ] ] the starting point is the expression for the pole mass of elementary particles . in the perturbative case , the pole mass is not conserved . the difference between the @ xmath3 - term at @ xmath29 and the pole mass is proportional to the @ xmath67 - term @ xcite . similarly , to the @ xmath65 - term @ xcite we associate @ xmath68 with @ xmath69 where @ xmath70 , and @ xmath71 . the evalue of the mass is the renormalization group . however , for large values @ xmath72 , the kinetic energy due to the expansion of perturbative variables becomes very large . the consequence of increasing the dependence is the conservation of mass in space ##time measured by the renormalon . in particular , the pole mass is a time - invariant quantity . to solve this problem , the simplest solution is to take the 1 - term term @ xmath73 derived from the renormalon and to continue the process with the series expansion in terms of@ xmath73 . we have two schemes , which lead to values close enough to each other . the first scheme is given by the @ xmath3 - pole mass @ xmath74 . from @ xmath75 we get the pole mass given in ref . [ 1 : 1 ] . we have shown that the effect of rgi due to the relationship between the pole and pole mass is identical with the above scheme , and the effect of rgi can be incorporated into the calculation of @ xmath76 - energy to get @ xmath77 mev , which is the expected result of calculations , as shown above . ( 0 , 0 ) ( 0 , 1 ) = 0 ( 0 , 3 ) @ xmath72 , gev ( 0 , 1 ) @ xmath21 , gev the second is the second , given by the @ xcite . in this case , we have the time - dependent combination of perturbative 3 - loop scatic potential @ xmath78 involving the 2 - circuit and @ xmath0 with the phenomenological ##ly - z net potential @ xmath79 involving both the 3 - loop 2 - circuit and- scale , as well as the long - range - dependent contribution to the scale factor . therefore , the scale and , therefore , the @ xmath80 - scale are derived from the renormalon . the two pole masses are determined from the observed time - dependent mass - number of the quarkonia . thus , @ xmath81 the calculation of time - dependent perturbative parameters @ xmath82 is possible , as shown in the @ xcite . however , the calculation of renormalon by the values of @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 up to the value of @ xmath85 regardless of the scale . the comparison with the perturbative pole mass method ( [ fig ] ) gives @ xmath86 mev , depending on the degree of variation of @ xmath87 within the range of @ xmath88 . the value of @ xmath85 determines the choice of the scale . the result is shown in ref . [ 1 : 1 ] , which is a good example of the method above . ( 70 , 3 ) ( 70 , 3 ) = - ( 90 , 90 ) @ xmath72 , gev( 66 , 66 ) @ xmath89 then , the perturbative substitution ( [ 1 : 4a ] ) with ( [ 1 : 24 ] ) results in the @ xmath89 . in fig . [ 1 : 4 ] , wherefrom we find @ xmath90 with @ xmath91 gev with @ xmath92 the value of ( [ 1 : 24 ] ) is much larger than the value @ xmath93 obtained by bodwin and then @ xcite . we consider the scale - dependence of our estimate . thus , at the same time we find @ xmath94 and , replacing ( [ 1 : 4 ] ) with ( [ 1 : 24 ] ) we obtain the final result with the increased uncertainty due to the addition of central values and , therefore , the increased scale - dependence of the addition of central values in @ xmath95 which is in agreement with the initial value @ xmath96 to be obtained with @ xmath97 and then @ xcite with the resummation of @ xmath22 - 2 . we point out that the analysis of the original data agrees with the analysis of @xmath65 - corrections would be a better way to estimate the number of free particles . in this case , we proceed to calculate . @ xcite , where the @ xmath65 - corrections are taken into account in the calculation of corrections for the values of @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 , so that the calculation suffers from the uncertainty associated with the resulting corrections in the calculations for the two initial states . the effect of @ xmath89 is the loss of all the initial state corrections . we have developed a new method to improve the accuracy of the perturbative series in calculations through the use of renormalization group for the two - particle model . the method allows us to obtain more accurate theoretical estimates of the series as well as to reduce the theoretical complexity of calculations from comparison of rgi values with the perturbatively related series . the rgi values for the values of the ( [ e : 5 ] ) , ( [ e : 1 ] ) are given by ( [ e : 6 ] ) and ( [ e : 7 ] ) . we have extended the method to the calculation of hadronic quantities for the @ x##math1 - math and @ xmath2 - charmonium , which allows us to calculate the values of @ xmath100 } / { \ to [ \ gamma _ { \ to \ to \ gamma ] } \ ] ] with very good agreement with the actual calculated values . the author thanks r . a . bodwin for the outstanding results of his work on the resummation technique for the hadronic model of @ xmath2 , which he presented at the first quarkonium workshop held at cern , dec . 9 - 11 , 2002 . a special thanks goes to the organizing committee of the workshop , and also to antonio vairo and nora brambilla for the support and the special recognition . i also thank prof . a . dzhelyadin for the opportunity to visit cern in collaboration with the lhcb group , to which , i express my gratitude for very hospitatily . i thank prof . a . a . likhoded , who asked me for the details of resummation techniques , which inspired this paper . * * a . narison and a . pich , phys . b * 211 * , 183 ( 1988 ) ; + j . braate##n , a . narison and a . pich , nucl . b * 373 * , 581 ( 1992 ) ; + a . a . kataev and a . a . starshenko , rev . lett . b * 235 * , 235 ( 1995 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9502348 ] . k . hagiwara _ et al . _ [ string theory - 1 ] , phys . b * 154 * , 010001 ( 2002 ) . g . barbieri , g . demilio , g . curci and g . remiddi , nucl . b * 154 * , 535 ( 1979 ) ; + k . hagiwara , c . m . kim and t . yoshino , nucl . b * 177 * , 461 ( 1981 ) . j . beneke and c . m . kim , phys . b * 348 * , 513 ( 1995 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9411229 ] , nucl . b * 426 * , 301 ( 1994 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9402364 ] . j . m . bodwin and j . t .schmidt , phys . d * 63 * , 114008 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0106095 ] . a . a . korner , a . krajewski and v . a . pivovarov , phys . d * 63 * , 036001 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0002166 ] . a . beneke , phys . rept . * 317 * , 99 ( 1999 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9807443 ] . v . melnikov and a . j . ritbergen , phys . b * 482 * , 101 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9912391 ] ; + a . a . chetyrkin and m . steinhauser , nucl . phys . c * 573 * , 617 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9911434 ] . m . schmidt , d . j . broadhurst , m . grafe and m . schilcher , j . phys . b * 57 * , 673 ( 1990 ) ; + d . j . broadhurst, m . schmidt and m . schilcher , j . phys . d * 64 * , 111 ( 1991 ) . v . v . kiselev , a . a . kovalsky and v . a . onishchenko , phys . d * 64 * , 054009 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : j - ph / 0005020 ] ; + v . v . kiselev , a . a . likhoded , a . a . pakhomova and a . a . saleev , phys . d * 64 * , 034013 ( 2002 ) [ arxiv : j - ph / 0105190 ] . m . czarnecki and a . melnikov , phys . d * 519 * , 212 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : j - ph / 0109054 ] .
