the purpose of this article is to describe some aspects of the proper velocity of high mass particles in the gravitational field of a particular astronomical object . consider , for the sake of simplicity , a massive particle @ xmath2 in orbit around the astronomical source of mass @ xmath3 and angular momentum @ xmath4 , where @ xmath2 , @ xmath5 and @ xmath4 are vectors . let @ xmath6 be the proper velocity of the source of mass @ xmath2 and @ xmath7 be the astronomical orthonormal velocity vector that runs # ##ed with this orbit . then @ xmath8 is the space - time velocity of @ xmath2 and @ xmath9 , @ xmath10 , are the spacelike velocity vectors that traverse the proper velocity space of @ xmath2 . we use metric such that @ xmath11 is ; therefore , the mass of the particle is @ xmath12 , our unit . suppose that at @ xmath13 a probe is launched from @ xmath2 and for some time @ xmath14 the trajectory of the probe is then followed by particles comoving with@ xmath2 . to understand actual motion in an objective manner in the context of general relativity , the non - trivial three - dimensional system @ xcite is used because it most closely corresponds to actual motion . let @ xmath15 be the real length of the path at an event @ xmath16 , then there is a real spacelike unit of time @ xmath17 that intersects @ xmath16 orthogonally to the path of @ xmath2 at an event @ xmath18 with real coordinates @ xmath6 such that @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 , where @ xmath21 is the distance vector at @ xmath18 that is orthogonal to the spacelike vector at @ xmath18 and perpendicular to the worldline of @ xmath2 . the distance in real coordinates is defined by @ xmath22 to first order as the distance vector from @ xmath2 that actually lies at the real end of the real coordinates by , and in real coordinates @ xmath23 . then @ xmath24 is given by @ xmath25 which is the length of the metricit depends on the reference frame @ xmath26 and the local worldline . the general equation of motion of the probe relative to mass @ xmath2 can be expressed in the explicit reference coordinates @ xcite @ xmath27 where @ xmath28 is the angular velocity of the probe relative to @ xmath2 . the velocity - vector of the probe is given by @ xmath29 , where @ xmath30 can be derived from @ xmath31 since @ xmath32 is a timelike velocity vector . the reference coordinates are the coordinates defined on an orthonormal reference frame @ xmath33 that is perpendicular to about the axis of @ xmath2 . they are defined in a reference frame of mass @ xmath34 and the worldline of @ xmath2 ; that is , @ xmath35 , where @ xmath36 is a local measure of curvature of spacetime . the definition of @ xmath36 has been discussed in detail in our original paper on the reference coordinates @ xcite . for the sake of clarity , we restrict our definition to @ xmath37 . .another property of the electron probe is that it has a critical speed given by @ xmath38 , especially in the case of two - dimensional particles . the concept of critical speed in particle physics has been extensively discussed in detail . we are particularly interested in the role that the critical speed @ xmath39 plays in the motion of the probe ; suppose the probe can be observed from @ xmath2 at the critical speed @ xmath40 , but for now we focus on the motion only when it is very close to the target at @ xmath2 . to second order , @ xmath41 has the generalized differential equation @ xcite @ xmath42 which describes the timelike motion of the probe when @ xmath43 for @ xmath44 , we can find the time - dependent term in , and ; however , the term in is zero and leads to the differential equation @ xmath45 note that the worldline of the probe can be represented in the background coordinate system on the basis of equations and ; therefore , it is in principle possible to obtain the position of this worldline in the background coordinate system by the following linear combination of the two systems of equations . in practice , however , theis not possible in general to obtain accurate values for these values in terms of the background coordinates and so one has to resort to # ##s ; # ref . @ xcite for a detailed solution of this problem . however , it is important to note that since @ xmath46 is determined from the generalized differential equation ( or the continuity equation ) , the worldline of the probe is locally independent . that is , if in the local coordinate system the worldline of @ xmath2 is determined by @ xmath47 , then the worldline of the probe is @ xmath48 , where @ xmath49 and we have replaced the local reference coordinate @ xmath50 by @ xmath6 in the case of @ xmath51 . this also follows from the use of background coordinates and the fact that @ xmath52 for @ xmath53 , since the ( generalized ) transfer function is defined in the direction away from the reference coordinate . thus , @ xmath48 may be interpreted as a local reference trajectory . depending upon whether @ xmath51 is determined from the continuity of the generalized differential equation , the results of this experiment can be interpreted differently .study of the linear and nonlinear behavior of magnetic fields by the external gravitational field . for the case of the gravitational field and the reference trajectory , we assume that @ xmath2 is in a closed , circular , orbit around the kerr source . this model for the source to some extent resembles our previous work on the dynamics of stellar winds @ xcite , where the reference trajectory is a circular orbit about the long axis of the kerr source . the dynamics of kerr spacetime has been studied by a number of articles ; see , for example , www . @ xcite and cited here . the dynamics of the source and the reference trajectory will be discussed in detail in the next section . the dynamics of fluid flows in black - hole spacetimes have been studied in a number of articles ; see , for example @ xcite and the papers cited here . here , we use free - space physics for the sake of simplicity ; the detailed study of black - hole debris disks @ xcite falls within the scope of this section . section [ s3 ] is devoted to the solution of the kerr equation . we assume in section [ s4 ] that the solution given in section [ s3 ] isto the linear ##ization of the original kerr identity to an infinite system . this equation is then discussed in detail . finally , section [ s5 ] gives a complete description of our problem . the spacetime region of interest is the kerr kerr region with the coordinates @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 is the total angular momentum of the system . here @ xmath56 is the standard boyer - lindquist constant and @ xmath57 the circular orbit is defined to be a null circular orbit of constant radius @ xmath58 in the complex plane @ xmath59 ; in case of @ xmath58 , circular orbits go from zero all the way up to the smallest null circular orbit given by @ xmath60 in this article , the minus ( + ) sign refers to , where @ xmath2 is in the same ( upper ) limit as the origin . for @ xmath58 less than the value of , there are no circular orbits that converge to the null circular orbit given by @ xmath61 it is convenient to use the keplerian metric for the orbits under consideration such as @ xmath62 let us assume that in the linear ##s and , the prograde motion of aand vice versa when @ xmath63 ; this also explains why the term @ xmath64 always appears in orbit equations . we see that @ xmath65 is ; therefore , the value of @ xmath66 determines the orientation of the orbit . it follows from the orbit equations that for the reference worldline @ xmath67 where @ xmath68 is such that the non - solutions are solutions of @ xmath69 and we have so also that @ xmath70 and @ xmath71 . the parameters of the orbit for the reference worldline are the orbital energy @ xmath72 and the angular momentum @ xmath73 , identified respectively with the timelike and the phase of @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 , and respectively determined by @ xmath76 to calculate the orthonormal momentum @ xmath77 , let us first consider the momentum @ xmath78 produced by the strong gravitational force in the kerr kerr spacetime . in the spherical coordinates and in terms of @ xmath79 , the total orthonormal momentum ofthese distances in the two directions are given by @ xmath80 where @ xmath81 is , we subject this vector to a speed ##up with : @ xmath82 , @ xmath83 , so that @ xmath84 is the distance vector perpendicular to the worldline of the point of @ xmath2 . the corresponding orthonormal distance in the direction of @ xmath2 is @ xmath85 , \ quad \ quad { \ lambda } ^ \ mu _ { ( 3 ) } = \ lambda ^ \ mu _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( 3 ) } , \ \ \ text { eq19 } \ quad { \ lambda } ^ \ mu _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( 3 ) } = \ lambda ^ \ mu _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( 3 ) } , \ quad \ quad { \ lambda } ^ \ mu _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( 3 ) } = \ quad { \ gamma } [ \ lambda ^ \ mu _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( 3 ) } + \ quad { \ gamma } \ lambda ^\ int _ { \ hspace { \ myspace } ( x ) } ] , \ int { \ } \ ] ] where @ xmath86 is the coupling constant corresponding to @ xmath82 . we see from @ xmath87 that the coupling factor @ xmath88 is given by @ xmath89 ##1 , @ xmath90 is null ( 0 ) for prograde ( positive ) orbits ; however , @ xmath91 results from the critical point ( @ xmath69 ) . the orbital orientation of @ xmath92 is along the three # ##ity axes , which are the radial , polar and eccentric axes with respect to the orbit , and it had to be folded up so that the new orbit would not be attracted to inside the orbit as shown in figure [ 1 : 2 ] . from @ xmath93 it follows from the definition of the time derivative of @ xmath94 around the orbit that @ xmath95 where we have defined the coupling constant so that @ xmath96 = @ xmath13 . note that @ xmath97 , which , tothe angles of @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 can be expressed as @ xmath100 that is , the difference between these angles is due to a combination of magnetic and gravitomagnetic forces . the final result for the reference frame , @ xmath101 , is : @ xmath102 therefore , we want to use the projection of the metric tensor onto the boundary of this reference frame as an index . the angles can be expressed as the @ xmath103 and @ xmath104 , where @ xmath105 and @ xmath106 are vectors that correspond to the matrix @ xmath107 . this matrix has the form @ xmath108 , \ ] ] where @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 are @ xmath111 orthogonal and traceless matrices representing both the electric and magnetic components of the metric tensor . it turns out that in the case under consideration @ xmath112 , \ qquad \ mathcal { h } = \ right \ left [ \ pi { 2 } { h } ] & 1 & h \ \ right &[ & h ' \ \ , & h ' & [ \ begin { x } \ n ] , \ ] ] where @ xmath113 the value @ xmath114 is defined on the basis of the relationship with the tides . thus , @ xmath115 is positive and is given by @ xmath116 , then @ xmath117 = @ xmath118 with a positive constant term , i . e . @ xmath119 , given by @ xmath120 which reduces to @ xmath121 at the schwarzschild limit @ xmath122 ; thus , @ xmath123 is at the positive limit ( @ xmath124 . let us assume that for the orbits under consideration and @ xmath125 , @ xmath126 $ ] ; that is , @ xmath127 is positive ( positive ) for the prograde ( negative ) orbit and , from the tides ( @ xmath128 ) , @ xmath129 , so that @ xmath130 = @ xmath131 , and @ xmath132 monotonically .from 0 to @ xmath133 are the values for circular orbits . similarly , for @ xmath134 , @ xmath127 is always positive for circular orbits , but it is not always positive for prograde orbits ; in fact , @ xmath127 is for a prograde orbit with radius @ xmath135 . these two equations can also be used as equations and to describe the curvature of the orbit corresponding to @ xmath2 . it should be noted that our results for the curvature of @ xmath109 are consistent with the results of marck @ xcite . let us now return to the solution of the first equation . for example , we take all of the spherical coordinates @ xmath136 , the _ dimensionless _ angular coordinates @ xmath137 , @ xmath138 where @ xmath139 . the resulting equation then takes the form @ xmath140 = : \ left [ \ begin { array } { cc } x \ \ to \ begin { c } \ gamma ] , \ qquad \ = \ right [ \ begin { array } { cc } x \ gamma ^ c \ gamma ^2 \ eta - 1 & 3 \ eta ^ 2 \ sin \ sin \ sin \ sin \ \ sin \ eta ^ 2 \ sin \ sin \ sin \ sin & 4 \ eta ^ 2 \ eta ^ 2 \ eta - 1 \ end { aligned } \ [ ] , \ \ \ text { eq36 } \ frac { d ^ 2y } { d \ gamma ^ 2 } + \ eta ^ 2 ##y = 0 , \ qquad \ eta = \ sqrt { d \ gamma ^ 2 - 1 } . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] . applied to the equatorial plane , we have a partial orbital motion of r @ xmath141 , where @ xmath142 increases from unity to @ xmath143 for @ xmath125 ; that is , frequency increases monotonically from unity for @ xmath144 to @ xmath143 for the most common orbital configuration . the equation of orbital motion in the equatorial plane can be transformed into an explicit expression with a restriction to the axial and radial directions ( etc . ) . that is , r @ xmath145 = r \ left [ \ begin { array } { array } ] \ \[ \ begin { array } \ right ] , \ qquad , = \ , [ \ begin { array } { z } \ sin \ eta & \ sin \ eta \ \ - \ sin \ eta & \ sin \ sin \ end { array } \ right ] . \ ] ] also , this applies to the autonomous system @ xmath146 where the overdot allows differentiation with respect to @ xmath147 . suppose that is @ xmath148 , @ xmath149 and the maximum value of the system @ xmath150 is reached @ xmath151 for the autonomous @ xmath152 system , we have @ xmath153 , \ \ \ label { eq41 } , = \ frac { 4 } { \ lambda } v _ 0 \ sin \ vartheta \ sin \ sin \ eta , \ \ \ label { eq42 } \ eta = - \ frac { v _ 0 \ sin \ vartheta } { \ lambda ^ 2 } [ ( 1 \ lambda ^ 2 \ gamma - \ frac { 4 } { \ lambda } \ sin \ sin \ eta ) \ sin \ varphi + - ( 1- \ , \ ( \ , ) \ , \ varphi ] , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath154 . we find that @ xmath155 , since @ xmath156 implies that for @ xmath125 , @ xmath157 decreases from zero to unity ; that is , it decreases monotonically from zero for @ xmath144 to zero for the last stable circular orbit . if the resulting orbit is one of the last stable circular orbits , then @ xmath158 , @ xmath159 are replaced by with @ xmath160 and @ xmath161 . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] using the expressions @ xmath37 and @ xmath44 , which in this case correspond to @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 , we find that the value of , , and is reduced with time due to the introduction of new variables . it is important to note that variables that appear in the solution of the differential equation with time and with the value @ xmath164 become values @ xmath165 with respect to the proper value @ xmath166; to second order in @ xmath167 and with @ xmath168 , the correction of this frequency from the keplerian orbit corresponds to the # ##ian ##d for an object of small radius , and the first - order correction in @ xmath169 corresponds to the de morgan - taylor - thirring frequency of @ xcite . therefore , a solution is in place , with the additional conditions that @ xmath170 = @ xmath171 , which corresponds to our assumption that the probe is being observed from @ xmath2 . in practice , it is not true that the probe is orbiting the massive star @ xmath2 , and that @ xmath41 will be considered very small compared to @ xmath34 ; for the sake of simplicity , we use @ xmath172 in this section . this means that in case of @ xmath173 , we can assume that @ xmath174 the solution of the integral equation to the differential equation is straightforward due to the assumption that @ xmath175 , where @ xmath176 is the critical value . it then takes the form @ xmath177 =d \ left [ \ begin { array } { c } \ , \ \ \ , \ begin { c } \ xi ] , \ ] ] which is equivalent to # . the transformation from @ xmath178 to @ xmath179 is a transformation from the rigid linear system to the system ; however , in general we have the effects of coriolis and gravitational forces on the right - hand side of this transformation . thus , this transformation is equivalent to # # solution to the nonlinear n - body problem @ xcite ; thus , system with the hill metric @ xmath180 is equivalent to the special case of the hill metric described in ref . @ xcite , and , and of ref . @ xcite with @ xmath181 . it can be shown , after much work , that with the local ##ization ##s - system , the kerr rigid linear system can be made linear as well . this remarkable result is due to the local properties of the kerr spacetime @ xcite . for @ xmath182 and @ xmath183 , where @ xmath184 = d \ left [ \ begin { array } { c } \ begin { r } \\ \ begin { array } \ begin { array } \ [ ] , \ end { array } \ ] ] we find that @ xmath185 , @ xmath186 , and @ xmath187 + # \ alpha ^ 2 \ beta \ alpha \ delta _ \ alpha \ nonumber \ \ - 2 \ big ( \ gamma ^ 2 \ beta \ delta ^ 2 _ \ zeta - \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ alpha ^ 2 \ delta _ \ xi \ big ) ( \ beta \ delta _ \ xi - \ beta \ delta _ \ gamma ) + # ##x \ dot { y } \ delta _ \ alpha \ big ( \ gamma ^ 2 \ beta \ delta _ \ xi + \ sigma ^ 2 - \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ big ) \ nonumber \ \ - 2 \ dot { y } ^ 2 \ big ( \ gamma ^ 2 \ beta \ beta \ delta _ \ xi - \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ alpha \ big ) , \ text { eq48 } \ \ \ alpha \ ddot { x } + \ sigma ^ 2 ( \ - 2 \ dot { y } ^ 2 ) x = \ frac { 1} { 3 } ] [ \ alpha ^ 2 _ \ zeta - ( \ sigma ^ 2 + 1 ) \ alpha ^ 2 _ \ alpha - 2 \ alpha ^ 2 \ alpha \ delta _ \ xi ] - 2 \ dot { y } \ big [ \ alpha ^ 2 \ beta \ delta _ \ alpha ( \ alpha \ delta _ \ alpha - \ alpha \ delta _ \ alpha ) \ nonumber \ \ + \ alpha ( 3 \ delta ^ 2 - \ frac { 2 } { 3 } \ big ) \ alpha \ delta _ \ alpha - \ alpha ( \ sigma ^ 2 + \ frac { 2 } { 3 } \ big ) \ alpha \ delta _ \ alpha \ big ] + 2 \ gamma ^ 2 \ alpha \ dot { y } ^ 2 ( 3 \ delta _ \ zeta - \ alpha \ dot { y } ) , \ text { eq49 } \ \ \ alpha \ ddot { \ alpha } + 2 \ dot { \ alpha } = 2 \ delta _ \ alpha [ \ alpha \ delta _ \ zeta - ( \ sigma ^ 2 + 1 ) \ alpha \ delta _ \ alpha ] - 2 \ alpha ^ 2 \ alpha \ alpha \ delta _ \ alpha - 9 \ delta _\ alpha \ alpha ( \ gamma ^ 2 \ xi \ delta _ \ zeta + \ frac { 1 } { 3 } \ sigma ^ 2 \ beta ) ( \ alpha \ delta _ \ zeta - \ xi \ delta _ \ zeta ) \ nonumber \ \ + \ frac { 1 } { 3 } ( \ gamma ^ 2 + 3 ) \ alpha \ ( x \ delta _ \ alpha - \ alpha \ dot { y } ) + 2y \ dot { y } [ \ alpha ^ 2 \ beta ( \ gamma ^ 2 _ \ alpha + 3 ) + \ sigma ^ 2 \ delta _ \ zeta ] - [ \ gamma ^ 2 \ beta \ dot { y } ^ 2 \ alpha \ delta _ \ alpha . \ begin { eq50 } \ dots { y } \ ] ] ) with the above solution of the above equation and the exact solution , it is possible to obtain the system of equations via the above taylor series in terms of @ xmath188 . however , the solution of such a simplified equation , based on the exact solution @ xmath189 , should be used only in conjunction with the first - order correction equations that follow , and that have been usedin the case of the gravitational field , , and would result in terms of the equations of motion that are not the first term of @ xmath41 . it follows from this , , and that the trajectory of the probe in boyer - lindquist space , @ xmath190 , is given by @ xmath191 , @ xmath192 , @ xmath193 and @ xmath194 from the ( generalized ) kerr equation and replacing @ xmath195 with @ xmath196 , we can find the trajectory of the probe in the generalized kerr equation system . this is due to the fact that the generalized kerr equation is linear in the direction @ xmath197 ##2 from the reference point ; therefore , @ xmath198 can be interpreted as a local gravitational field that is linear at the reference point . it turns out that for large - scale ( @ xmath199 ) , the radial ( @ xmath200 ) and linear ( @ xmath159 ) equations in turn have the radial and linear terms @ xmath201 and @ xmath202 , respectively .the above system of equations then turns into equations for the vertical and horizontal motion . that is , if the probe is launched only in the @ xmath159 direction , then its motion will be opposite to the @ xmath159 direction according to the above second law . similarly , if the probe is launched in the opposite @ xmath203 direction , then the probe will accelerate in this direction throughout its flight . if the probe is launched in the same horizontal direction relative to the equatorial plane , for @ xmath204 for example @ xmath147 and then the equations of motion apply to @ xmath205 the vertical motion is not known for @ xmath206 ; that is , it is the high velocity @ xmath207 at which the direction of the motion is opposite to the high - speed velocity that agrees with the mechanics . if the probe is launched with @ xmath208 , then it will continue to accelerate in accordance with the equations . similarly , for @ xmath209 , the probe will accelerate , as described by terms in @ xcite . in particular , the vertical motion can be expressed as @ xcite , since this implies that @ xmat##h210 whose motion can be described by time . this particle has timelike free energy if the following condition is satisfied @ xmath211 for @ xmath212 , which is also satisfied and it follows from that the range of @ xmath159 is discrete and belongs to the [ @ xmath213 $ ] , where @ xmath214 on the other hand , for @ xmath215 the particle is close to ( approximately ) the absolute speed of light . in this case , the particle has infinite tidal energy . according to einstein , the range of @ xmath159 in which this increases monotonically tends to zero as @ xmath189 approaches infinity . the question of the existence of local coordinates for such a system is a difficult one ; an important way to answer such a question is found in our main article @ xcite . it is necessary for practical purposes to compare these local coordinates to what ordinary observers would see @ xcite . first , the enormous kinetic energy of particles in the # ##onic system can be transmitted to the outside world ( i . e . to the atomic level ) by interaction with other particles and sources of radiation .in our first experiment of fluid dynamics with a single particle traveling along the axis of rotation of the neutron star @ xcite , we found that for all speeds above the critical speed @ xmath216 , tidal _ acceleration _ occurs in a cone of latitude @ xmath217 away from the rotation axis , where @ xmath217 is offset by @ xmath218 and corresponds to an angle of about @ xmath219 , and tidal _ acceleration _ occurs outside this cone , i . e . in the plane of the relative - rotation cone of latitude from @ xmath220 to @ xmath221 , where @ xmath222 and corresponds to an angle of about @ xmath223 . based on these experimental results , we conclude that in the present case the effect of tidal acceleration for speeds above the critical speed will not be due to the rotation axis itself . to demonstrate this phenomenon in the case under study , we have used the following set of data with initial conditions . our results show that tidal acceleration _ parallel or perpendicular to the kerr rotation axis occurs when the particle is aligned with @ xmath224 in the region @ xmath225 , wherefor a solution @ xmath226 , @ xmath227 is equal to a unit of , say , @ xmath228 . to solve the equation above , let us first assume that if @ xmath229 is a solution of equation , then it is @ xmath230 . in particular , it is not invariant under the action of @ xmath231 ; therefore , the solution is expected to behave differently with respect to the complex plane . for this reason , we restrict our solution to @ xmath232 , which corresponds to , according to the kerr equation in our case ( see equation [ 1 : 1 ] ) . finally , let us assume that with these conditions , the solution occurs immediately , i . e . @ xmath233 = @ xmath234 ; thus , it is possible to remove @ xmath235 from equation . it turns out that @ xmath236 where @ xmath237 is a linear combination of @ xmath238 defined by @ xmath239 . @ xmath240 , @ xmath241 and @ xmath242 are defined by @xmath243 for @ xmath244 , @ xmath235 , and for @ xmath224 ; in particular , this is the case for an elliptical orbit around the kerr boundary . the boundary of this domain is given by @ xmath245 , i . e . @ xmath246 , by @ xmath247 and @ xmath248 ( i . e . @ xmath249 ) , where @ xmath235 is , as shown in figure [ fig : 1 . 4 ] , where @ xmath250 and @ xmath251 . let us assume that for a prograde circular orbit of the @ xmath58 around a kerr black hole , @ xmath127 increases monotonically from zero for @ xmath252 to @ xmath253 for the largest possible circular orbit . for a fixed @ xmath254 $ ] and @ xmath209 , the non - acceleration domain decreases to @ xmath255 . on the other hand , for a fixed @ xmath256 , the acceleration domain in figure [ fig : 1 . 4 ] is exactly the same .@ xmath257 . for @ xmath130 , however , the shape of the disk changes significantly . in particular , for @ xmath258 , it follows from this that @ xmath259 , where @ xmath260 defined by @ xmath261 is a positive constant such that @ xmath262 . however , the energy source in this case lies on the boundary of the circular disk defined by @ xmath263 , where @ xmath264 and @ xmath265 , and the circle of constant radius lies at the center of @ xmath266 respectively . since we have used a perfectly circular kerr disk as the reference frame in this case , it is still possible to see that the gravitational acceleration ##s described above in the context of the motion of the kerr disk around the sun could also lead to the existence of double jets . indeed , this acceleration acts directly with respect to the equatorial orbit of the kerr disk . this result would be consistent with the possible existence of double jets , namely , a pair of double jets in opposite directions along the long axis of the kerr disk . if @ xmath267 for which @xmath147 , . the motion is restricted to the @ xmath268 plane and is a timelike motion if @ xmath269 the solution of the generalized differential equation ( gje ) in the @ xmath270 plane is characterized by the terms @ xmath127 , @ xmath189 and @ xmath271 . for @ xmath189 very small close to unity , the solution of the gje is characterized only by the nonlinear solution of the differential equation given in the previous section . in particular , as @ xmath189 slowly increases toward unity , the stability of the nonlinear terms of the gje can easily be achieved . in particular , since @ xmath272 , the differential equation has a nonlinear solution , namely , @ xmath273 with @ xmath274 , the solution of the gje in unity increases steadily and reaches the normal form of the # ##onic equation . this problem can be solved , however , in the case of the two nonlinear solutions with @ xmath275 and @ xmath276 ; in this case , the differential equation has nonlinear terms corresponding to the solutions of thethe reference orbits exhibit no tidal effects . the orbit of the gje ##s also exhibit quasi - periodic oscillations of the heart rate effect at different frequencies as shown in figure [ fig : 2 ] . however , these effects seem to exist only for @ xmath277 , in which case they are probably not valid today , since higher - order tidal terms of smaller magnitude have been used in our analysis . even if a quasi - periodic effect of the kind shown in figure [ fig : 2 ] explains the effects of the higher - order tidal terms , the magnitude of the effect would not be large enough to be of any real importance in comparison with the observed quasi - periodic effects ( qpos ) @ xcite . we have derived the modified kerr equation for a circular or elliptical orbit in the fundamental plane of the exterior kerr spacetime . this model has been extended to an elliptic orbit ; the reference orbital motion can now be further divided into vertical and horizontal motions corresponding to the reference orbit . in connection with these motions , we have established the importance of the rotational motion @ xmath207 in the determination of the solution of the exterior kerr equation . the general approach taken in this articlemay be of interest in working with the jets of international space station , the detection of small orbiting satellites as well as satellite - to - satellite infrared spectroscopy . also , in connection with the theoretical study of debris disks in ( distant ) stellar cores , our work may be useful for the better understanding of the quantum dynamics ##s that would be involved in the formation of high - energy jets @ xcite . that is , the parallel flow ##s described in this article may be related to how the jets are formed above and below a debris disk around a kerr black hole . since the jets are both confined to and along the axis of rotation of the stellar core , the results of the experiments @ xcite on the formation of ultrarelativistic jets would have to be taken into account for the parallel and parallel flows along the kerr rotation axis . _ 1955 , _ 1960 _ physics : the quantum theory _ ( amsterdam : north - holland ) chicone c and mashhoon b 2002 _ int . _ grav . _ * 4231 chicone c and mashhoon b 2005 _ preprint _ gr - qc / 0511129 mashhoon b 2005 _ int .math . a . * 13 * 2025 chicone c and mashhoon b 2005 _ ann .
