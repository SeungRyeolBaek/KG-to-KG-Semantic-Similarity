topological phase of condensed matter physics is a topological many - body state with nontrivial topological and hilbert space states in the topological space @ xcite . recently - discovered topological superconductor ( tsc ) has generated much interest since this discovery of topological phase and the existence of topological phase ( cfl ) @ xcite which is a promising candidate for the fault - tolerant topological quantum computer ( tqc ) @ xcite . there are many platforms for computational experiments for tsc , for example , chiral @ xmath1 - topological superconductor @ xcite , s - wave ##let ##t @ xmath2 @ xcite , superconducting topological phase @ xcite and noncentrosymmetric superconductor ( nc ) @ xcite . the presence of topological phase has been observed in the superconducting insb nanowire @ xcite , @ xmath3 @ xcite and topological phase josephson junction @ xcite . to provide a better quantum computing platform for tqc , both experimental results and theoretical results are now being sought . in this example , we consider the topological phase and the states in the core and in the outer layers of the @xmath0 - the dresselhaus ( 110 ) spin - orbit ( so ) coupled model . it is found that the strong nuclear coupling plays a key role in the different states of the system . although the rashba - rosen model has been extensively discussed @ xcite , the dresselhaus ( 110 ) - coupled model is much less studied than @ xcite . however , we find that there is a special semimetal state in the dresselhaus model , where the energy level decreases in the quantum system and different types of spin andreev flat states ( so ) emerge . we find that these flat states enable the calculation of spin theoretically and physically . it is found that the chern number is not a well - defined physical parameter in the gapless region , however , we find that the many different semimetal states in this gapless region can also be described by the pfaffian version of the black - box spin hamiltonian . the authors have defined the flat states for the systems @ xmath4 with high - spin , @ xcite , @ xmath5 - wave superconductor , @ xmath6 - wave superconductorand @ xmath7 - wave superconductor @ xcite . however , our proposal for modeling the flat abs is called @ xmath0 - wave dresselhaus ( 110 ) . the system has an in - plane magnetic field which is more complex than the previous proposal where one has to apply the magnetic field in the @ xmath8 wave to the surface @ xcite . our proposal is therefore not correct . the flat abs causes a peak in the density of electrons ( dos ) which is clearly visible and leaves an interesting impression in the electrical properties of @ xcite . the zero - bias current peak has been observed in the experiments with the insb nanowire @ xcite and @ xmath3 @ xcite and appears to be similar to the flat abs . even if the same effect occurs in the dresselhaus model , the flat abs and the zero - bias current induced by the phenomenon described above should be ignored . the model is summarized as follows . the model for @ xmath0 - wave systems with dresselhaus ( 110 ) phase diagrams is described in ref . [ 1 ] . the phase diagrams and the details of this model are available .2 . the numerical and theoretical solutions to the interaction equations at the core of the system are presented in sec . [ mfatedge ] . the interacting equations at the outer region of the system are also solved in sec . [ mfinvortex ] . finally , we give a detailed presentation in sec . [ 2 ] . we start with solving the hamiltonian of the cubic lattice for the square lattice @ xmath0 - wave associated with dresselhaus ( 110 ) . here is the in - plane magnetic field , which is given by @ xmath9 : @ xmath10 , \ \ \ [ { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath11 is the creation ( interaction ) potential of the particle with components @ xmath12 and time @ xmath13 . @ xmath14 is the interaction potential with large amplitude @ xmath15 and small amplitude @ xmath16 . @ xmath17 is the magnetic field given by the in - plane magnetic field with time @ xmath18 . @ xmath19 is the dresselhaus ( 110 ) so interaction and @ xmath20 is the @ xmath0 - wave .##conducting system with . ##less @ xmath21 . we have @ xmath22 in this case . in the above notation , the hamiltonian is @ xmath23 with @ xmath24 , where @ xmath25 , @ xmath26 is the wave function in the corresponding brillouin equation and the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian is @ xmath27 where @ xmath28 , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 are the density matrices acting on the black - body space and white space , respectively . the nontrivial coupling property of the dresselhaus model is given by the existence of gapless ground states and free states . now we shall express these properties in the hamiltonian e . ( [ eq1 ] ) . for example , we shall first describe the coupling behavior of the @ xmath0 - term rashba model , in which the dresselhaus ( e ) - term @ xmath19 in the hamiltonian e . ( [ eq1 ] ) is replaced by the rashba term [ @ xmath31 $ ] and the n - plane coupling termis described by the local magnetic field @ xcite . as such , we shall use the chern number to describe the nontrivial phase space structure of the rashba system . the chern number defined for the energy gap hamiltonian is @ xmath32 , where @ xmath33 is the direction of the magnetic field @ xmath34 , where @ xmath35 are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian . the calculation is carried out in the usual brillouin form and the integral is carried out for the whole region . as long as the topological quantum transition does not occur , the chern number remains constant . since the topological quantum transition occurs when the energy gap exists , the state space can be determined by applying the gap - closure operator of the hamiltonian . in the phase diagram of the rashba system as shown in the figure . ( [ fig1 ] below ) , we see that the gap exists in all regions and the chern number is equal to the point of the phase diagram . therefore , in the following example , we shall see that the phase diagram of the dresselhaus system has a gapless region that makes the chern number well - defined . to see this , we needthe bdg hamiltonian is . ( [ eq2 ] ) satisfying the # ##ity values of the @ xmath36 and @ xmath8 states , then the energy gap is @ xmath37 , where @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 . therefore , we can find that the energy gap closes at @ xmath40 which leads to the following gap - closing points : @ xmath41 , @ xmath42 . after some more calculations , we find that when @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 ; when @ xmath45 , @ xmath46 . finally , the gap closes at @ xmath47 with @ xmath48 corresponding to @ xmath49 . therefore , we can find that the gap closes in the direction from a to b as shown in the figure . ( [ fig1 ] below ) . the pair of gap - closing points : @ xmath43 , @ xmath50 and @ xmath45 , @ xmath51 are also known as a and @ xmath52 . then we shall find the correlation between the number of gap - closing points in the inner brillouin region and the physical properties ofthe hamiltonian . however , apart from the phase diagram of the rashba nc in the fig . ( [ fig1 ] a ) , where the gap is in three straight lines and each individual area of them has a different chern number , the phase diagram of the dresselhaus nc shows the gapless region from a to b as shown in the fig . ( [ fig1 ] b ) , which means that the nc is in the semimetal phase of the gap region . for the gapless region , it is well known that the chern number is also well - known . moreover , the important physical properties which are resulting from the breaking of the hamiltonian can also be used to describe the many different semimetal phases of the gapless region . for the hamiltonian fig . ( [ eq2 ] ) , we describe the properties as follows : ( i ) electron - hole symmetry , @ xmath53 ; ( ii ) full particle - hole symmetry , @ xmath54 and ( iii ) chiral symmetry , @ xmath55 , where @ xmath56 , @ xmath57 and @ xmath58 is the spin ##or respectively . wewe write the pfaffian invariant @ xcite for the particle - hole symmetric hamiltonian as @ xmath59 \ text { pf } [ \ mathcal { h } ( \ mathbf { k _ { x } } ) \ sigma _ { x } ] } { \ text { pf } [ \ mathcal { h } ( \ mathbf { k _ { 2 } } ) \ sigma _ { x } ] \ text { pf } [ \ mathcal { h } ( \ mathbf { k _ { x } } ) \ sigma _ { x } ] } \ right \ } , \ end { split } \ ] ] where @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 , @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 are the partial particle - hole symmetric systems in the outer brillouin plane of the crystal lattice . similarly , the pfaffian invariant @ xcite for the partial particle - hole symmetric system is @ xmath64 } { \ text { pf } [ \ mathcal { h } ( x , k _ { x } ) \ sigma _ { x } ] } \ right \ } . \ end { split } \ ] ] forthe chiral ##ity , if we use the notation where @ xmath65 is diagonal , @ xmath66 , and the hamiltonian is off - diagonal , @ xmath67 . from this @ xmath68 , we can calculate the following . @ xcite ##r @ xmath69 . \ { { 1 } \ ] ] the pfaffian number @ xmath70 can be calculated for the two possible semimetal phases of the hamiltonian viz . ( [ eq2 ] ) . it is possible to see that @ xmath71 and @ xmath72 represent the phase diagram of the dresselhaus nc as shown in the fig . ( [ fig1 ] below ) . however , the semimetal phases in the region of a , b , c , d and the regions of e , f , g are not inequivalent . as for the other two possible phases @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 , then we shall show that they can be used to determine the number of possible states in the corresponding brillouin diagram . - see ( a ) rashba and ( b ) dresselhaus nc . thethese are @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 . in ( b ) , @ xmath77 . the chern number of these regions is given by ( a ) . the number of edge - free states of @ xmath43 , @ xmath50 and @ xmath45 , @ xmath51 in these regions is also given by : [ @ xmath78 . ( b ) . , n = 302 ] to study the electronic structure of the semimetal phase of the dresselhaus nc , we consider the andreev spin states and the states at the edge and at the local center of mass . we proceed in order to study the dynamics of the dresselhaus nc . by considering the boundary regions of @ xmath36 ##0 to be open and @ xmath8 to be closed , we find the hamiltonian g . ( [ eq2 ] ) for the boundary phase and study the phase diagram of the hamiltonian . however , although the nc exists in the semimetal phase from the edge to center as shown in the figure . ( [ fig1 ] . ) , there are dispersionless states at the edge ofthe fig . the two slightly different semimetal phases of the systems a and b are shown in the fig . ( [ fig2 ] a ) and ( [ fig2 ] b ) , respectively . we would like to know the number and position of the flat abs in these slightly different semimetal phases . using the pfaffian number fig . ( [ pfky ] ) and winding number fig . ( [ wky ] ) , the position where the flat abs exist in the first brillouin zone can be easily determined as shown in the fig . ( [ fig2 ] c ) and ( [ fig2 ] d ) . the number of flat abs is independent of the number of gap - closing points in the first brillouin zone . from the hamiltonian in the chiral case , we can see that the gap exists when @ xmath79 . in the complex case of @ xmath80 , the winding number can be applied to the gap - closing point @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 , where @ xmath83 is the circle around the gap - closing point . according to the black - white diagram , we see that @ xmat##h84 , therefore , the gap - closing points with opposite winding numbers are equal in area . the points @ xmath85 in the regions a and b are shown in the fig . ( [ fig2 ] e ) and ( [ fig2 ] f ) . as long as the projection of opposite winding and gap - closing points does not all lie in the same brillouin region , there will be equal area between them @ xcite . therefore , the projection of flat abs is @ xmath86 and it is easy to see that @ xmath70 is the projection of @ xmath87 , @ xmath88 . the corresponding projections of these two different semimetal regions are shown in the fig . ( [ fig2 ] e ) and ( [ fig2 ] f ) . we know that there is a phase with a phase which is not evident in the electrical resistance measurements . therefore , both of these flat abs have strong experimental support in the electrical resistance measurements and the two ##s at the vertices of the dresselhaus region should be independently confirmed . as for the protection of the flat abs against noise and interference , we will see that from the2 point of view . as long as the state of disorder does not violate the symmetry of hamiltonian h . ( [ eq2 ] ) , these bound states can be described by the same gauge theory as above . [ t = " ^ " , ] in addition , we have observed the spin particle and the molecule in the @ xmath0 - wave dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupling state . we observe that there is a gapless region shown in the phase diagram of the dresselhaus system . we observe that there are two andreev bound states which are spin particles in the gapless region . the related system insb has the @ dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupling @ xcite which makes it possible to observe the system at the surface or at the inner surface of the molecule . we can create an insb ( 110 ) so coupling , make contact with the @ xmath0 - wave superconducting , and subject it to an in - plane magnetic field . then we can use the magnetic field measurements to measure the low - energy power levels of the system . 34ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx # # ifnum[ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ` ` ` ` # # ' ' ' ' @ noop [ 1 ] secondoftwosanitize @ link [ 1 ] + # $ 1 & # # 1212 _ _ % 1 @ startlink [ 1 ] @ endlink [ 1 ] @ link @ innerbibempty @ noop _ _ ( , ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 95 . 405 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 95 . 2015 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 95 . 106802 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1143 / jpsj . 2010 . 031007 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 95 . 226801 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 95 . 146802 [ * * , () ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 61 . 106803 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 82 . 10267 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 98 . 134521 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop * * , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 98 . 096407 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 177002 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1016 / s0003 - 4916 ( 02 ) 00018 - 0 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 108 . 107005 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop * * , ( ) @ noop * * , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 108 . 125318 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10. 1103 / physrevb . 83 . 161108 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop * * , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 107 . 217001 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 109 . 056803 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 104 . 040502 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 83 . 060504 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 83 . 020501 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 83 . 224511 [ * * , ( ) ] @ noop link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 83 . 097002 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 83 . 184525 [ * * , ( ) ]link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevlett . 109 . 150408 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 86 . 094512 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 86 . 094504 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1016 / 0031 - 9163 ( 84 ) 90375 - 0 [ * * , ( ) ] link : \ doibase 10 . 1103 / physrevb . 86 . 155327 [ * * , ( ) ]
