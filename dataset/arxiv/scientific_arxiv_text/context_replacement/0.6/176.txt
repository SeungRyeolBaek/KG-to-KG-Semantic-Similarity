particle and transverse energy production in the central velocity region of heavy ion collisions can be modelled as a mixture of particle / soft parton production and soft particle production . with higher energies , the soft sub - particles are expected to become more energetic . this is due to two factors : firstly , that in @ xmath2 collisions the # ##ity of the particle and transverse cross section can be achieved by the production of soft partons , _ minijets _ , with high energy @ xmath3 gev @ xcite . this is also expected to happen in @ xmath4 collisions at very high energies . secondly , the soft particle production modelled as @ xmath5 , so that for longer distances the production of soft partons is modelled as @ xcite . the slow , non - perturbative , energy production of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions can be modelled _ e . g . _ as string @ xcite or as a single non - coupling string @ xcite . the time taken for producing partons and transmitting energy into the central velocity region of such strings is approximately , where @ xmath6 @ xmath1 , where @ xmath7gev is the total angular momentum used in the process . the soft collisions are produced at all stages of the process , with @ xmath8 @ xmath1 . if the amount of partons produced in the hard and soft regions of the heavy particle collisions is large enough - which may be the case - then mixing in the soft parton region will occur @ xcite , and the soft production will be reduced . the main consequence of this is that a larger amount of parton produced in the central region will be _ produced _ from perturbative decay ( pqcd ) at higher energies and the net contribution from soft collisions with @ xmath9 gev is smaller . therefore , the result is that at the sps ( au + au at @ xmath10 @ xmath11gev ) , the soft component dominates , and at the lhc ( au + au at @ xmath12 @ xmath11tev ) the soft component dominates the hard component . at the rhic ( au + au at @ xmath13 @ xmath11gev ) it will be in the central region , and other factors should be taken into account . a furtherof importance has also been devoted for the research at @ xcite on the role of nuclear reactions in particle physics at high energies . these studies provided many new insights and a lively discussion during the last years . more importantly , a completely new approach to minijet ##s has been developed @ xcite . i have divided this work up into two parts . in the first part , we will discuss the fundamental physics of the parton plasma and present our experimental results @ xcite . the main objective of these discussions is to work out the initial conditions for the qgp - 1 from @ xmath14 @ xmath1 , including the possible energy transfer into the high - energy plasma , the composition of the parton plasma , and , to investigate the possibility of a very fast thermalization and of the expected high neutron - to - proton ratio . it is also important to understand the possible properties of the interacting partonic plasma , since the time evolution of the qgp , the structure , the observables , and the energy levels of the plasma will all depend on the initial conditions . the second part i will allow for development of an alternative approach for parton and high energy plasma : minijets from @ bfkl - 1@ xcite . therefore , we can estimate the total amount of kinetic energy we should get from the bfkl - minijets in heavy ion collisions . hadronic jets generated from the @ xmath15 electrons and holes are easily detected easily . when the partons reach @ xmath16 gev the detectors are very able to distinguish @ xcite from the surrounding plasma . in heavy ion collisions , where we see hundreds ( rhic ) to thousands ( lhc ) of minijets with @ xmath17 gev being detected , detection of the minijets may be difficult . however , the incoming partons are expected to contribute significantly to the successful detection of qgp . the detection of the collisions of both holes and electrons in @ xmath18 and @ xmath4 collisions is based on the number of incoming , parton - parton pairs . the following figure shows the total collision cross section , @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 are the angular distributions of the incoming partons @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 , and @ xmath23 are the parton distributions of @ xmath24 ( @ xmat##h25 ) . the number 2 comes from the fact that , for the lowest order ( lo ) pqcd , there are 2 partons present in the same subcollision . using the eikonal equation for @ xmath18 and @ xcite the ratio @ xmath26 can be expressed as the total number of possible particles for each such collision . the results that will be found in the article @ xcite are obtained with the mrsh @ xcite and mrsd - @ xcite parton models with a scale choice @ xmath27 . more detailed results can be found in ref . @ xcite , and the solutions of ref . ( [ sigmajet ] ) and ref . @ xcite . the ratio 2 is obtained for the highest order ( lo ) , @ xmath28 . here the scale choice @ xmath29 is used to estimate the number of nlo particles . simulations of the nlo ##2 - model @ xmath30 @ xcite show that ( with a scale choice @ xmath27 and with a cross section @ xmath31 ) this is a constant ratio @ xcite . strictly speaking , however , the ratio @ xmath32 - model iscan be used for calculations where a well - defined , scale - invariant correlation function can be defined @ xcite . for @ xmath33 - 1 for nuclear collisions , the acceptance window for the standard nuclear heating unit defines such a function . for this acceptance window and for @ xmath17 gev the final nlo value has not been determined yet . the first estimate of the binding energy of interacting nuclear partons with @ xmath34 for an @ xmath4 interaction on a given scale with @ xmath35 will be expressed as @ xcite @ xmath36 and the nuclear binding energy produced by these partons as @ xcite @ xmath37 where @ xmath38 is the first correlation with @ xcite which is @ xmath39 , representing exactly the angular momentum of the particle in nuclear collisions . the mean is @ xmath40 and , for the quantities with p - type energy levels , @ xmath41 . the acceptance window defined for the quantities @ xmath42 and for @ xmath43 will be @ xmath44 , and the final estimates will be expressed as @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 . see below .( [ et ] ) and ( [ et ] ) here , @ xmath47 is the average energy of the particles and @ xmath48 is the average total energy produced by the partons produced by each of these collisions . we set @ xmath49 gev , _ i . e . _ we fix the boundary conditions : @ xmath50 @ xmath1 . the results for the maximum energy values for b - b collisions at the rhic and lhc levels are shown in table below . however , results from proton , neutron and proton collisions are shown in @ xcite . [ @ xmath51 can be found at here . ] from the results above , we have observed large effects on parton production : @ xmath52 . in general , however , at the large @ xmath53 - and @ xmath54 there are very small size effects @ xcite , especially for the lhc energy levels . therefore , the time dependence of the energy production was found to be very important for the interactions at large . @ xcite . also , a meta - analysis with the results from the very large - @ xmath53 @ .##cite research to be done in making a solid quantitative prediction of the nuclear effect on minijet ##s . the rapid increase of the wave velocity @ xmath55 and the decrease of @ xmath53 measured in the @ xcite does not affect the production of the 1 gev minijets at rhic energies very much but it has more serious consequences at the lhc scale . as seen in @ xcite , there is a predictable pattern of minijet production due to the nuclear parton distribution . therefore , the more rapidly the nuclear energies rise , the more likely should be the production due to the glrmq - based @ xcite . however , a solid quantitative prediction depends on the scale factor of nuclear energy distributions as well . the total number of nuclear partons , @ xmath0 @ xmath1 with @ xmath44 and @ xmath56 gev in the n - th region , are shown in bold . ( [ 1 ] ) . this is as observed and @ xmath57 . the higher values are associated with mrsh and the lower values with mrsd - parton distribution . * ( 2 ) * the total nuclear energy measured .these partons , are denoted by etc . ( [ et ] ) . [ parameters = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , parameters = " ^ " , ] [ table1 ] let us now take a good look at the results of fig 1 . there are two important findings . firstly , the parameters that affect both the initial parton and subsequent particle production : the initial parton system is about 90 % dense . secondly , the effective surface area of the two initial partons is @ xmath58 . comparing this with the corresponding effective transverse area , @ xmath59 , we find that @ xmath60 _ i . e . _ the parton system in the lhc in fig . 1 @ xmath1 is _ saturated , so that the production of parton particles will take place @ xcite . in this case , the system @ xmath61 is very _ high _ saturated . @ rhic , since @ xmath62 , also occurs at the level of @ xmath15 ( since @ xmath63 @ xmath1 ) , and in the case where pqcd can not be achieved . this quali##tative analysis was replaced by a more general , although still phenomenological , version of vs . @ xcite , where we found that at very high temperatures ( lhc ) and large pressures ( @ xmath64 ) , a strong kerr effect is produced , causing a reduction of the minijet cross section @ xcite at the perturbative temperature at @ xmath65 . the result is that the total parton effect is reduced and its relative importance becomes irrelevant . the most important observation is that the gluonic charge of the nuclear heating chamber @ xmath66 will thermalize very rapidly , at least in the lhc stable state . in the perturbatively stable state the ( kinetic ) energy per particle is @ xmath67 gev and the energy density of the gas is @ xmath68 ##2 / @ xmath69 / @ xmath70 . the energy @ xmath71 of an ideal ( massless ideal ) gas in a near equilibrium ( = both kinetic and thermal ) state with this energy density can be calculated from @ xmath72 , and we have @ xmath73 = . 988 ( =. . ) gev with the mrsh ( mrsd - ) spectrum . thus , we have @ xcite @ xmath74 note that in the lhc the initial limit of mass is not reached for an ideal system at thermal equilibrium . now isotropization is impossible , and a immediate thermalization is not possible . an immediate thermalization would in fact have important consequences for _ e . g . _ _ dileptons , for which a high critical temperature plays a significant role @ xcite . note that our understanding of the possibility of an almost instant thermalization is limited to the pre - @ xmath53 region of the s - spectrum . from the temperature / mass relationship it also follows that thermalization for rhic is likely to occur much sooner . note however , that originally we did not consider isotropization of the system at all . in the standard model given above , the arrival time of the elementary particles , @ xmath75 , and the initial parton time , @ xmath76 for the partons which will be present in the super - universe , are given . in the bjorken - type m - type model , given , and thethe central # unit density for @ xmath77 is a local constant . for a more detailed model of isotropization , a more detailed , real - time model needs to be developed , as described in ref . @ xcite ( see also the definition of @ xcite ) . the final result @ xcite is that now , at @ xmath14 fm / @ xmath69 , the effective particle number density in the central ##ities region is _ small _ compared to the total density and _ larger _ than the total particle density ( ref . @ @ xmath78 ) , even though the individual particles are located very far away , as in the lhc where @ xmath79 . more precisely , we compare @ xmath80 with the mrsh ( mrsd - ) parton model . calculating the effective mass - to - charge ratio involves solving @ xmath81 for a single particle , and _ large _ , for @ xmath0 fm / @ xmath69 : @ xmath82 for lhc , and @ xmath83 for rhic . we find that between the two , we canthus , moving away from the initial entropy of the early collisions , where the value of the final entropy is @ xmath84 @ xcite . for the lhc , after an initial thermalization of the first particle at @ xmath0 @ xmath1 , and an initial decay process , the final entropy will be given by the final entropy of at @ xcite . the non - perturbative component for particle production will not increase the entropy , but will decrease the final quantum number . if the non - perturbative component to the final particle - entropy is taken to be of the same order of magnitude as for the # b + b collisions at sps , the _ final _ particle - to - entropy ratio for the lhc will be @ xmath85 . for the rhic ##b collisions , thermalization is more commonly regarded as zero , by following essentially the same line of reasoning , and taking into account that the non - perturbative component is . thus for particle production , we have @ xmath86 for the _ final particle - to - entropy ratio . minijet physics experiments have shown that , based on a formula , wherethe perturbative partonic cross sections are based on the full leading @ xmath87 from the parton model with nonperturbative corrections . finally , we can provide an alternative model for minijet and nuclear wave distributions , where momentum is not conserved . the small - @ xmath53 increase in the wave function @ xmath88 ##7 at leading @ xmath89 gev @ xmath90 @ xcite can be explained by the leading @ xmath91 dglap - approach @ xcite and also by the leading @ xmath92 decay @ xcite . such a wave - function increase , @ xmath93 , observed from the leading @ xmath94 bfkl - approach @ xcite , does not fit the theory . in the following , let us assume that the small - @ xmath53 increase is not due to the bfkl - physics . then , with this assumption , we can calculate what is the _ n _ wave function produced by the nuclear heating , due to the minijets produced from the bfkl - physics and the lhc - physics . in rhic the bfkl - minijet##s are not able to interact in any other way because the bfkl - interaction takes place only at @ xmath95 . therefore , this first version of my ##e , which is based on . . @ xcite , will be useful only for the lhc . it is possible to start from a pair of closely coupled minijets with two outgoing jets separated by a small band gap , as shown by mueller and navelet @ xcite . the ( first ) subprocess is shown in fig . 1a , where the incoming partons have two carriers @ xmath96 and @ xmath97 , the outgoing two rapidites @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 ( @ xmath100 ) and # ##ly @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 , respectively . in the outgoing jets there are @ xmath103 carriers each , separated by . . . . @ xmath103 . . the initial wave is represented by a line , with the incoming and @ xmath104 outgoing on - screen . . the first ##less - bfkl - pomeron interaction .when these two lines are parallel and equal . in the kinematic case we will be interested in , the molecules are well behaved , @ xmath105 , but the transverse vibrations are not , @ xmath106 . here , the two degrees of freedom of the motion of the molecular molecules are considered . the two lines of fig . 1a represent the vibrations at a perturbative level , so that we can use # ##ity to break the first term down to : @ xmath107 where the molecules are involved . the weak momentum ordering reduces the momentum operators to @ xmath108 and @ xmath109 , and the parton relations come out of the latter . for the leading @ xmath110 the first term in the large @ xmath111 limit follows from the @ xmath112 - 1 limit . in a physical gauge , this term is also gauge invariant up to the subleading operator . the theory of @ xmath113 consists mainly of the following building blocks : with the large @ xmath111 limit , in a physical gauge and with the strong momentum ordering , thethis can be represented as emission from an additional non - local lipatov - vertex , where bremsstrahlung from initial and final states and emission from the local vertex are combined . these are represented by the green box in figure 1 . all the edges are effective , since they are exponentiated ( reggeized ) by removing the corresponding edge corresponding to the @ xmath112 - vertex or vertex . the effective ones are shown on horizontal ( horizontal ) lines in fig . 2 . in paper , the description and applications of these methods can be found in the main article given by del duca @ xcite . first , we consider the vertices in @ xmath113 , and due to the high dependence on temperature , the step graphs with @ xmath104 vertices are generated . the linear ##ization can be done by averaging ( above ) over the entire ( local ) state space , and the following calculations can be performed . with addition of _ e . g . _ - - _ ( in @ xmath114 ) , the path integral can be calculated . finally , the averaging of @ xmath##103 , one has an additional differential equation , the - bfkl - ladder @ xcite ( see also @ xcite ) , which describes the transformation of a line into the maxwell - brown - pomeron equation . the bfkl - ladder is represented by @ xmath115 in figure 1a . the next step ( [ 1 ] ) then reads : @ xmath116 where @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 . if both the theoretical corrections and the experimental corrections are used , the result transforms into @ xmath119 , and the upper bound for the two jets separated by a small angular distance is : @ xcite . let us now investigate the problem with fixed jet , by taking another step of the ladder , as shown in figure . it is possible to compare the results with the differences between the fixed jet @ xmath120 and the fixed minijet @ xmath69 , and , between the minijet @ xmath69 and the fixed jet @ xmath121 . this leaves a gap on each step of the first step . finally , we see that the correction for @ xmath##122 , which describes the free - space structure and properties of the four lipatov jets associated with the system @ xmath69 , starts from describing the the system @ xmath69 . the next section : @ xcite @ xmath123 our goal is to build the new bfkl minijet laser system which is @ xmath124 . as shown in fig . 2 , we must remove the requirement of having no jets . the addition of the pomeron ladder to the system is completely non - perturbative and a z - factor , or , alternatively , a parton factor , will be required . however , given that we do not have any such factor , we need to speed up the process . we do not have a perturbative upper bound to deal with , however . therefore , the best we can do is to use the equation for total electron scattering ( mas ) , @ xcite , where the addition of a jet into the pomeron ladder between the two electrons and holes is supposed to be described by the _ and _ bfkl equation for the total energy . @ xmath125 , @xmath126 . \ left { hbfkl } \ ] ] . for this time - series , is given by the model number @ xmath127 obtained from the data @ xcite . by using the sum of the parameters obtained from only one side of the bfkl - pomeron ladder , the resulting minijet cross section from the bfkl - ladder can now be written exactly as @ xcite @ xmath128 where @ xmath15 and @ xmath129 are the angular velocity and the velocity ( in the local direction ) of the minijet . from momentum transfer and multi - regge , the two parameters are @ xmath130 . due to the fact that in this case we do not have a ` ` x ' ' to fix for the entire universe with an external black hole , a star , nor an outer - space - cross section to fit into , we can not fix the maximum dimensionless value of @ xmath131 . . however , we are able to fix the _ x _ of the minijet @ xmath15 - 1 , which should be useful for finding the upper limit oftransverse energy production from the bfkl - ladder . the minijet cross section of r . ( [ bfklmini ] ) is shown in fig . 1 @ xcite . for the bfkl - ladder we have calculated the measured transverse energy associated with the lo - @ xmath53 , in the distribution mrsd - @ xcite . for this , the more accurate ( cfltlo ) minijet cross sections , shown in the next part of the article , are those associated with the mrsd - parton distribution . the nlo - analysis @ xcite shows that lo + nlo correlation with # ##ly fits the standard model cross section distribution . however , at @ xmath132 gev , the bfkl - minijet energy should be less than the collinearly distribution . we can therefore assume that @ xmath133 . the transverse energy production due to the minijets from the bfkl - ladder from @ xmath134 and @ xmath4 , can then be calculated @ xcite from @ xmath135 the symmetry of the bfkl diagram is broken when we reach the boundary , and the spinfigure 2 from @ xmath136 . this trade - off is , however , needed only for the bfkl calculation . the decrease of the cfltlo - minijet cross section at the lhc ##b - c , ( as shown in the first part of the figure ) , means that the bfkl - cross section should not be much faster than the one shown in fig . [ dsdpt ] . therefore , we should not compare the bfkl - contribution with @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 gev . with these numbers , we solve for the b - b collisions in the lhc , @ xmath139 gev with running @ xmath140 , and , 4940 gev with ( _ _ hoc _ ) running @ xmath141 . comparing these numbers to the ~ 15330 gev in figure 1b for example , we find that the bfkl - contribution is at least a ~ 50 % approximation to the value of @ xcite . on the other hand , we should not take the result at the same number of times , ( @ lo ##c , @ xmath142 below ) _ _ .e . _ in b and e . g . [ dsdpt ] . . then the two contributions are of equal magnitude . in this case , however , the @ xmath61 in the cfltlo - decay should be less than 1 gev , and the bfkl contribution would not be the dominant contribution . we worked under the assumption that the bfkl - decay is only for _ and _ the hard - @ xmath53 goes to infinity , _ i . e . _ we found the _ hard _ contribution from the kinematical mechanism responsible for the _ bfkl - pomeron . since the above decay cannot be explained by the leading @ xmath143 and / or the leading @ xmath144 decay , the leading @ xmath94 - evolution is still not the dominant contribution at the highest value of @ xmath53 . therefore , my conclusion is that the bfkl - minijets can bridge the gap towards soft propagation at @ xmath145 gev , since the boundary conditions necessary for the soft qgp - decay and the lhc - decay are dominantly provided by the minijets operating in the gap . * * .* the results presented in this article are based on calculations . i would like to thank k . kajantie , a . leonidov , a . mller , v . ruuskanen and y . - wang for their contributions . i also express my gratitude to a . leonidov and v . ruuskanen for getting our bfkl - project started and then m . blaizot and m . mueller , nucl . phys . * b289 * ( 1987 ) 847 . k . kajantie , j . a . landshoff and j . lindfors , phys . * 2000 * ( 1987 ) 2517 ; + c . j . eskola , k . kajantie and j . lindfors , nucl . phys . * b323 * ( 1989 ) 188 . eskola , k . kajantie and v . ruuskanen , phys . b332 * ( 1994 ) 191 . k . andersson , m . gustafson , m . johansson - almqvist , nucl . b281 * ( 1986 ) 289 . m . werner , phys .
