turbulence is a key part of the study of stellar systems , especially those of open medium ( leo ) , clusters of galaxies and circumstellar disks . the recognition of the importance of turbulence has caused advances , for example , in the understanding of fluids . it is known , for example , that turbulence causes gas bubble formation , mixing of gases , release of heat . observationally it is known that the fluid is fluid at scales ranging from mm to kpc ( see smith et al 1995 , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) , with an external magnetic field that affects almost all of its properties . the set of mathematical tools that can describe turbulence is not a new one ( see references : lazarian 1999 and ref . 2001 ) . one of the most commonly used tools is the energy spectrum , which describes the distribution of the energy over time . for example , the famous kolmogorov model of a fluid assumes that the difference in energy between two points in the fluid varies on average with the distance between them as the square root of the distance , i . e . @ xmath0 . in terms of time - dependent energy , this makes the famous kolmogorov model@ xmath1 , where @ xmath2 = x _ s _ r , interpreted as the fourier transform of the distribution function of the system @ xmath3 . note that in this article we use @ xmath4 to describe this system . the analysis of turbulence , in particular , turbulence statistics , became possible recently , due to developments in the theory of mhd turbulence . as we know , most fluids are unstable , which makes us think that the connection should be between such fluids and mhd models of the atmosphere ( see vazquez - semadeni et al . 2000 , eddy ##kee & klessen 2004 , bellesteros - paredes et al . 2007 , mckee & ostriker 2007 and ref . 1 ) . in fact , without further research , the application of theory of mhd turbulence to turbulence could well be impossible . indeed , from the point of view of fluid dynamics , turbulence is characterized by its reynolds number , @ xmath5 , which is the linear ratio of the # ##ing rate of a parcel of fluid to the rate required for external forces to slow it down . for @ xmath6 we expect it to be unstable and this is exactly what weas in gravity ( for example @ xmath7 ) . in extreme , very cold , @ xmath5 and high magnetic field , the number @ xmath8 ( that can be as high as @ xmath9 ) is a difficult problem for numerical simulations that could not possibly be very close to the astrophysically - known limit . the only available numerical models would be @ xmath5 and @ xmath8 equal to @ xmath10 . we scale up the size of the problem to the second power , but the computational cost increases to the second power ( in h + 1 ) , so the brute force approach does not help to solve the problems related , for example , to ocean currents . we hope that the study of the magnetic field will give us insights into particle physics . as in the case of the more complicated ocean ( or atmospheric ) fluids , analysis of turbulence helps to determine the # # ##s . in deep , intra - galactic systems , in addition to that , we want to study variations of the turbulence , resulting from the variation of the degree of mixing , scattering , interaction of the two particles etc . how to interpret the experimental results from observations is a matter ofa long time . while velocity spectra are readily obtained from the observed scincillations and observations of the ##ar fluctuations , the most detailed velocity spectra have been difficult to obtain , until relatively recently . turbulence is associated with strong winds that cause changes in the phase angle of emission and absorption lines . they provide information of the emissivities or values , usually related to the air temperature , for the intensity of the line of emission . it is far from easy to determine the intensity of the observed turbulence from the observed absorption lines . measurements of velocity ( brown 1958 ) have become the accepted method of measuring velocity , although it is not clear to when and to what extent the curve actually determines the velocity . recent studies ( lazarian & esquivel 2003 , van le03 , esquivel & lazarian 2005 , ossenkopf et al 2006 , esquivel et al . 2007 ) have shown that the curves are not a valid measure for molecular clouds , which means that while the values obtained for hii clouds ( odell & castaneda 1987 ) are very accurate , those for molecular clouds are not . an important contribution is the study of the relationship between theanalysis of flow velocity and the nonlinear effects of fluctuations of flow parameters was described by lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 , patent lp00 ) . this work gave way to two new techniques , which were later named velocity channel analysis ( vca ) and velocity turbulence analysis ( vcs ) . the techniques are new ways of analyzing turbulence data as position - time - velocity ( ppv ) data sets . the vca is based on the concept of channel maps , which are the discrete sets of ppv data , the vcs of fluctuations along the velocity coordinate . if the techniques had been used before for turbulence analysis , although the relationship between the amplitude of the fluctuations along the channel map and the actual turbulence data is unknown , the analysis of the fluctuations along the velocity coordinate was improved by the development of the vcs technique . with the vca and the vcs one can compare the models and methods to _ _ _ _ . for example , the velocity channel models are more complex , e . g . , waves higher than the kolmogorov index of @ xmath11 are expected to reflect effects of waves , while steep ones can reflect time - dependent effects of shocks ( .beresnyak & lazarian 2006 and ref . 2007 ) . by comparing the properties of the spectrum with the conditions of interest , e . g . with high and low bubble pressures , one can get an important insight into the physical properties of the spectrum , its structure , distribution and nature . the absorption of the electromagnetic radiation is a part of the theoretical study of turbulence from the very beginning of the research in the 1980s ( see also : brown 1999 ) . a detailed study of the nature of the absorption was done for the vca in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2004 , now lp04 ) and for the vcs in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2006 , now lp06 ) . in lp06 it was shown that absorption lines themselves can be used to study turbulence . however , the vcs is a simple technique that does not require a high resolution to study turbulence . many different light sources and different optical media can be used to study the same absorption spectrum . however , lp06 covers only the local ##ization of turbulence , i . e . when the absorption lines are not present . this limitation limits the use of the technique . for example , for the vcand infrared absorption lines , e . g . si ##i , sii , siii the turbulence spectra of stars . this means that a lot of the analysis of the turbulence spectra , e . g . , hst and other methods can only be done with the lp06 method . the aim of this paper is to solve this situation . in fact , in what follows , we provide a general theory that attempts to explain the properties of the spectral line , and the associated turbulence , of the surrounding medium . thus , in 2 we describe the details of the theory we presented , and our theoretical results are in 3 . the derivation of the general method of spectral analysis is given in 4 , and the derivation ##s in 5 . whereas all our previous papers ( lp00 , lp04 , lp06 ) focused on absorption lines , in particular infrared absorption lines , e . g . co and co , these features present the authors with clearly defined problems . for example , they have to study turbulence with a different approach , and also from variations in pulse width . in particular , studies of absorption lines in the spectra of stars have been successful in solving the fundamental problems of turbulence spectra in this way . recent advances in sensitivity and sensitivity analysis of spectroscopy haveanalysis of molecular spectra . among the above techniques , vcs is the best one to be used with extended spectra . however , it is only with extended spectra that the double ##t or vca methods are possible . at the same time , vcs makes use not of the wavelength , but the intensity . theoretically , however , more studies are possible if absorption along a single line is considered . in general , only about a few lines of absorption , as it appears in figure 1 is sufficient to achieve the overall resolution of the extended spectra . using the same data , chepurnov & lazarian ( 2006ab ) have demonstrated that the total number of lines ranges from 1 to 10 . for strong lines , the absorption and emission lines can be calculated in the same way , essentially , the same as for lp06 . for this case , the problem to calculate is the inverse fourier transform of the time - averaged spectral lines , irrespectively of the choice whether this is an emission or an absorption spectral line . such a ` ` width of line ' ' is not possible for strong absorption lines , which itself is only affected by the kerr effect . it is possible ( see spitzer 1978 ) that this phenomenon corresponds to the ` ` @xmath12 goes from 10 to @ xmath13 . the following section will focus on this . rather than @ xmath14 the intrinsic width is determined by the mass and so it does not contain information about temperature . ] . consider the equation in a more general form . width of the absorption line at point @ xmath15 is given by @ xmath16 where @ xmath17 is the absorption line . in the case of the intrinsic width of the point @ xmath18 , the frequency response of @ xmath19 is determined only by the phase shift of the absorption line from nearby objects . the distribution density of radiation along the line of sight , the average of @ xmath20 is @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 is the specific distribution density at that point @ xmath23 is the specific distribution density that is determined by the interaction of normal and normal distributions at that point . this is the same @ ppv , that we have @ lp00 , and @ xmath24 . the vanishing intrinsic width is accounted for by the expression @ xmath25 and , in more detail , @ xmath26 with intrinsic width given by the general .@ xmath27 , the absorption line intersects the corresponding voigt line @ xmath28 . we observe the line @ xmath29 we can see from this . ( [ 1 : 1 _ 2 ] ) that the absorption is affected both by phase shifts and frequency shifts . the optical depth as a function of concentration has many fluctuations resulting from wave ##lets and the temperature fluctuations of the material . observation of optical depth fluctuations in the lines of absorption lines provides information about ir and ir . the optical depth is determined by the concentration of the material in the ppv region , @ xmath30 . in our recent studies we have studied the phenomenon of @ xmath30 in the lines of absorption lines , for both spectral analysis and absorption depth measurements . absorption lines have two main properties that require further study . first , our ability to measure the optical depth from the observed signal @ xmath31 depends on the quality of the signal as well as sensitivity of the detector and the amount of background noise @ xmath32 . for samples with low optical depth @ xmath33 we can in principle measure the optical depth of the visible spectrum . at high optical depth , the visible signalof the line is always at the same level and the available information is limited to the width of the line . this is the first problem that is the subject of this article . in this regime the information is distributed over a range of frequencies up to or high enough so that @ xmath34 is not so close up to the length factor of the line . in the new optical depth , these are the wings ( for spitzer , where @ xmath35 the wings are more limited by this limit ) . we shall denote this window as @ xmath36 where @ xmath37 is the line that the line is placed upon ( with frequency dependence of the line ) and @ xmath38 is the line width . this serves as the window for the ` ` ' ' ' ' @ xmath39 here , fluctuations of the wings of the line are dependent on the frequency dependent mean profiles . in other words , the frequency components of the optical depth are distributed over this frequency range , with frequency dependent mean mean profiles . the _ fluctuations _ of the optical depth @ xmath40 that have resulted in the window can also be considered to be frequency independent , the mean profiles of the line can beand for . what other parameters one should consider in terms of analysis of the same signal in a different area ? the components of the magnetic field , and @ xmath41 , are the average dot product of the intensity of the field at two points the two component correlation function @ xmath42 and , finally , the dot product of the values of the ( two ) components in the power spectrum @ xmath43 in . these quantities are useful if one can calculate the intensity by average of all components which depends on the fundamental frequency of the medium . we assume that the medium is homogeneous and transparent . this does not require the input signal to be very significant in the case of the medium , but instead to calculate the values of @ xmath12 on the basis of the frequency , @ xmath44 , @ xmath45 , which is ( lp04 ) @ xmath46 the correlation function depends only on the frequency , and values of the spherical function are used . the best values are @ xmath47 although , the power spectrum is just the fourier transform of the correlation function @ xmath48 which of them is easily derived from .depends on the scale of the model and the data . the power spectrum contains information which is specific to a particular scale and as such is related to variations that occur in the range of scales of interest , in addition to long - range scale variations . on the other hand , performance of the transform is non - linear in configuration space and is related to distribution of information in the different powers , discretization , that can lead to aliasing of data from one scale to another . the problem becomes worse if the aliased distribution is small . therefore , the structure function is local in configuration space and can be defined for non - locally distributed data . however , in scale , it contains information from different scales and can deal with the same information from different scales . in fact , @ xmath49 is only well defined for power spectrum of @ xmath50 with only @ xmath51 ( for high resolution data ) . . ] this problem is solved if one uses the correlation function @ xmath52 . , which is well defined for @ xmath53 . the structure function can be thought of as a version of the correlation function @ xmath54 that is related to the power spectrum in the same way as the correlation function , ifthis is the @ xmath55 spectrum . the power spectrum measurements of lp06 show that the corresponding two dimensional spectrum of ppv ##w ##s along the lines that results from turbulent motion is @ xmath56 where @ xmath57 is the length of line - of - sight component of the velocity density function . for kolmogorov waves @ xmath58 and for turbulent motions caused by waves @ xmath59 . these curves are called @ xmath60 which makes the direct measurements of the structure functions impossible ( although for @ xmath61 the structure functions can be measured ) . at the same time , in our general case we deal with a wide range of frequencies along the path of the field waves , which limits the direct measurements of the power spectrum . so we first describe the properties of the power spectrum @ xmath62 in this case , and then describe the properties of second order structure functions . let us consider the power spectrum of the velocity density function , @ xmath63 . @ xmath64 is the energy related to the angular ( angular ) coordinates of two waves along the line - of - sight and the coordinates of the structure function . . . we haveourselves to those values . . ] fourier transform of the spectrum .

[ here , @ xmath105 is the same @ xmath106 . ] for other scales there is only slight aliasing as in ##ly shown in figure [ 1 : 1 ] . , @ xmath38 , @ xmath107 , @ xmath92 are dimensionless , in the case of @ xmath108 , the magnitude of the wind force isthe size of the cloud . the line width is ignored . only the scale of the turbulent velocity and the size scale of the cloud are taken into account . the best estimate of the cloud size is kolmogorov , @ xmath58 . the left panel illustrates the slight aliasing due to the width of the line . the underlying spectrum is recovered , from top to bottom , for @ xmath109 , i . e the height of the cloud points from the bottom line to one - third of the line width . the bottom line is the value of @ xmath110 . for the present conditions . one assumes that for the standard model , the underlying spectrum is recovered for @ xmath111 . the right panel illustrates the distortion of the spectrum due to thermal effects , which is recovered from the scale @ xmath112 . thermal effects can be recovered for for @ xmath113 . , [ = " x : " ] , @ xmath38 , @ xmath107 , @ xmath92 . dimensionless , in the case of @ xmath108 , the scale of the turbulent velocity and the size of the2 . the thermal effect is neglected . only the distribution of the cloud , and not the distribution of the cloud is taken into account . the general theory of the thermal effect is kolmogorov , @ xmath58 . the left panel shows the thermal aliasing due to the shape of the wing . the entire spectrum is reduced , from top to bottom , for @ xmath109 , i . e the width of the wing changes from the straight line to one - third of the finite width . the straight line is the power of @ xmath110 . under the ideal conditions . one assumes that for the standard optical spectrum the same scale is used for @ xmath111 . the right panel shows the loss of the spectrum due to the scattering , which is reduced to the limit @ xmath112 . thermal effects can be accounted for for @ xmath113 . , [ = " : : " ] the spectroscopy used in @ xmath114 shows both optical and thermal effects . thermal effects are especially important in case of straight line scattering , since the shape of the wavenumbers is affected by the thermal effects and the scattering .as @ xmath115 and as only for the narrow wings @ xmath116 . for narrow wings the same optical and physical properties can be applied to the spectrum , while measuring the temperature of the gas at the same frequency . this method is governed by the fact that the temperature of the gas is very low for the spectrum of a given frequency . we should note that the frequency distribution is one of the limiting cases , with the possibility of high aliasing since the resulting fourier image falls off rapidly . one of the ideal parameters is given by the length of spectrum , which the image falls off . as @ xmath117 shifts the spectrum from long scales back into short scales . for the spectra that we use for vcs , long scales will have no aliasing . this allows for more flexibility when measuring the overall shape of the spectrum and for use of statistical techniques . second order structure function is an alternative to standard model , in case of long scales with the resolution proportional to the length of the spectrum . the second order structure function of the spectrum of the frequency spectrum can be expressed as @ xmath118 which allows for extensions of the structure function beyond the standard structure function @ xmath119 @ xmath12##0 is equivalent to root - mean - square as observed at the same velocity @ xmath121 , resulting in lp06 . from the definition of lp06 for @ xmath121 we have @ xmath122 \ nonumber \ \ & \ propto & \ frac { { \ gamma \ right } ^ { z ^ 2 } { d _ v ( t ) } \ frac { 2 } { 1 } \ left ( \ frac { d _ v } { m } \ right ) ^ \ right \ left [ \ hat 2 ^ { 2p } \ hat ( - 1 ) \ left ( 2 ^ { p - 1 } - 2 ^ { p - 2 } \ right ) + \ frac { 2 ^ { { ##p - 1 } } { p - 1 } \ hat v ^ 3 + [ ( \ hat v ^ 4 ) \ right ] \ hat { t : d _ vv } \ hat { t } \ ] ] where @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 are the same vector that describes the distribution of the system . to obtain these values , the dimensionless matrix @ xmath125 ,@ xmath126 , @ xmath127 are dominant . the first order of the series gives information about the magnetic field , and the power law terms describe the effects of the conditions at the large scale . in comparison to the structure functions they are not defined until @ xmath128 , i . e for @ xmath129 the second order structure function is well defined . when the motions have the greatest contribution to the depth fluctuations , @ xmath130 , we find that : the @ xmath131 series can have the same effect as if @ xmath132 , which includes all the properties of kolmogorov waves and plane - wave waves . this condition is satisfied by @ xmath133 if the depth fluctuations , given by the ##s @ xmath124 , are dominant . at the small scale the second order structure function has the same effect as the first order . @ xmath134 the major advantage of measuring the structure function present in the structure of the aircraft is to take into account the pulse length . the signal measured @ xmath135 is equal to the distribution function of the signal of @ xmath136 where the average value of the transmitted signal @xmath137 is similar to the general profile of ppv : @ xmath138 described in the section 2 of lp06 . for low values @ xmath139 , the contribution to the correlation function due to this profile is as @ xmath140 and is positive . the price one pays when using higher - order structure functions is their increased contribution to the noise of the system . the structure function itself is not biased by the noise except for the zero , ( since it is as @ xmath141 [ \ delta ( d _ 1 + v ) + delta ( d _ 1 + v ) ] \ right \ rangle = \ d _ \ tau ( v ) + \ langle n ^ 2 \ rangle \ tau ( v ) \ ] ] . the structure function is biased by the zero which contributes to the noise @ xmath142 ^ 2 \ right \ rangle = d _ \ tau ( v ) + 2 \ langle n ^ 2 \ rangle \ ] ] this effect is further enhanced for the higher order structure function @ xmath143 ^ 2 \ right \ rangle = d _ \ tau ( v ) + .\ langle [ ^ { \ rangle \ ] ] the changes in the reconstruction of the signal are of higher order due to signal size reduction . structure functions and power spectra are used extensively in the theory of turbulence ( see monin & yaglom 1975 ) . however , problems arise when spectra are ` ` extremely steep ' ' , i . e . the spectral structure functions of fields such as @ xmath144 , @ xmath145 . for high frequency spectra , one can also use such structure functions , but the one dimensional fourier transform that are used in vcs corresponding to the power spectra of @ xmath146 are not known . as a result , one does not have to deal with extremely steep spectra in theory of turbulence ( see , however , cho et al . 2002 and cho & lazarian 2004 ) . in the vcs , ` ` ` extremely steep ' ' spectra arise naturally , especially when the turbulence is limited to the kolmogorov . this was demonstrated in lp06 , where the spectral approach is used as the best way to study waves and effects of scattering of x - rays . the advantage of the spectral approach arises when the turbulence is not limited to a non - linear system .. . the fluctuations from the spectrum described by the window function will disappear from the observed spectrum of the @ xmath64 . the use of an even more large scale window function may solve the problem , which limits the range of @ xmath64 for which it can be used . therefore , higher order structure function ( see the section above ) , is necessary for the proper data collection . in terms of the vca theory , we used the spectral description of lp00 , and in lp04 , dealing with time , we discussed how to deal with space rather than fourier transform . in doing so , however , we ignored the shape of the curve in the z - plane and made a modification to the spectral description to solve the problem with the ` ` very high ' ' case . therefore , our theory of higher order structure functions is suited to dealing with the problem using the vca theory . in the section above we have discussed the application of vcs to the absorption lines . the following assumptions were made . first of all , for the radiative effect we assumed the existence of spontaneous emission . this assumption is well suited for ir and microwave absorption lines ( see spitzer 1979 ) . second , we assumed that the light is reflected froma radiation source , which is an experimental source for the absorption of radiation of a star or a planet . however , we consider the effects of temperature in the source . in our view the density assumption would be highly restrictive . indeed , it is known that the variations of temperature strongly affect absorption lines . however , our recent study , as well as our earlier work , shows that the effects of the variations of temperature are minimal . it is easy to see that the temperature equations can be combined together with the density assumption to be based on ` ` density ' ' which as we have already mentioned . our approach can also be generalized to include the more general radiative effect and the spatial distribution of the radiation lines . in the latter case we shall have to consider both the effects of a narrow and a wide telescope approach , the same that has been used in lp06 . thus , the equations in lp06 for the narrow telescope approach can be directly applied to the absorption lines , using the observed temperature , instead of density . the advantage of the extended source is that not only vcs , but also vca can be measured ( see deshpande et al . 2000 ) . as a consequence of the extended source ,the modification of the optical z - axis allows for studies of the turbulence . this , for example , would require using even higher order correlation ##s , if one is to deal with turbulence resulting from bending of the spectral lines . in lp06 we have applied the vcs method in the study of turbulence and modified the equation for the fluctuations of intensity to accurately describe the fluctuations of the signal . in this case , however , we applied the law of moments and found that this allows for studies of the depth , at which fluctuations of intensity would be expected . the disadvantage of such an approach is the uncertainty of the base level of the signal . the uncertainty is a non - trivial factor that can spoil the results , if the base level of intensity is not accounted for properly . however , the advantage of the is that , it allows studies of the fluctuations , when the original vca and vcs fail . further study should determine the limitations of this method . the study of turbulence using the modified vcs described above should be performed for optical depths @ xmath12 up to @ xmath13 . for this range of optical depth , the signal intensity is determined by phase shift .than the two lines . although , the absorption line profile contains information about the turbulence , in practice , the # ##ter ##nary of the profile will contain no signal and will not be used for the statistical analysis . however , the wings of the aircraft will contain data . since multiple absorption lines may be used in the same plane of interest , this helps to improve the analysis of all of them simultaneously . we note that piecewise measurements of the components corresponding to the absorption lines are possible . the same statistical analysis may involve analyzing the data with parameters , that , apart from the length scale , include the spectral length , and turbulence intensity , as this was shown by chepurnov et al . ( 2006 ) . note , that measurements of turbulence in the same plane with different absorption lines can provide additional information . therefore , if data with weak absorption , i . e . @ xmath148 are available , there is no need for such measurements . however , in the presence of background noise , the data will be far from ideal . moreover , noise of a higher magnitude , e . g . background noise , will affect the weak absorption lines . the weak absorption lines , in case of vcs are available , for sufficiently high @ xmath64 . this makes the analysisof the scale that can be sampled with the probe . however , the resolution that is obtained with the strong absorption line is lower , which gives the advantage of higher signal to noise ratio for the scale of @ xmath64 that is associated with the absorption line . if , however , a very weak absorption line is used , an experiment with a multiple dish radio probe was made . each dish of the radio probe samples the frequencies in the range [ @ xmath149 $ ] , where @ xmath150 is the spatial frequency , @ xmath151 is the distance of the dish . in addition , the radio probe samples the spatial frequency @ xmath152 , where @ xmath153 is the distance between the dishes . thus , the weak absorption line corresponds with the information about the turbulence at the high turbulent frequencies of the observed system , as well as the turbulence due to the frequency @ xmath154 . in lp06 we rely on the two observations for the turbulence . at the same time as chepurnov et al . ( 2006 ) compared spectra of turbulence to the data was done . in the experiment , power - - law turbulence models can be used, which is true for most systems , for which the range of frequencies , @ xmath64 is very small . however , for systems with the low frequencies of 10 km / s and the high frequencies of 10 km / s within the order of magnitude of the ` ` normal range ' ' . but for high frequencies one can increase this range by a factor , which depends on the signal to noise ratio of the system . for oxygen , rather than hydrogen one can increase the range by a factor @ xmath155 . this may or may not be true for very large asymptotics . we have shown , [ ] that for absorption lines the number of windows , by the shape of the lines , causes a distortion of the absorption spectrum . however , this is not a problem if , instead of asymptotics , one of the windows is used . according to the model proposed by chepurnov et al . ( 2006 ) the model for absorption lines should not attempt to model the turbulence caused by the lines . the problem is , however , that absorption lines are a good electron capture model . therefore , there is an extensive list of possible ways to model systems that affect our. ( see lazarian 1999 and p . 2 ) . however , a careful analysis shows that this approach is not as good as it seems . however , our research shows that these techniques can produce poor , if still useful , results , unless an understanding of what they do is developed . for example , we mention in the literature the possibility of the random assignment of spherical shapes to the molecular dynamics models . note , that size and shape estimation techniques would require a lot of shells / shells for the data compared with _ and _ _ . this allows for a more rigorous approach to the interpretation of the results of some of the above studies . for example , the use of statistical methods for the analysis of data is not described in the context with the statistical aspects of the analysis ( nielsen & henriksen 1990 , stutzki et al . 1998 , cambresy 1999 , khalil et al . 2006 ) , which creates the possibility of an unlimited number of models and methods . in addition , while statistical methods use methods of @ xmath156 , we use more complex correlation methods , which may be more suitable for samples very large . in our research we can use them only to .the use of averaging ( @ kowal & lazarian 2006a ) and correlation functions ( ossenkopf et al . 2006 , esquivel et al . 2007 ) , either with or instead of fourier transforms and basis functions . this can reduce the noise generated from averaging of data , but we found in the cases when basis functions of data that we knew were weak and the reynolds number was low , a weak approach ( @ xmath38 - 1 ) was being used ( cp . esquivel & lazarian 2005 , ossenkopf et al . 2006 , esquivel et al . 2007 ) . while in general the basis functions are weak , a more sophisticated approach , principal component analysis ( pca ) , produces basis functions that are , in some cases , the most robust . however , the best results obtained with pca for the turbulence model have , according to padoan et al . ( 2006 ) , the value of the mean reynolds density of the density @ xmath157 ( @ van dam et al . 2003 ) , which is too high for almost any of the turbulence models . in addition , " our results with lp00 showed that for density ( @ xmat##h158 , for @ xmath159 although velocity and density may affect the size of ppv values , no effects of ppv values on density have been observed so far for pca data . this observation may raise the difficulty of understanding the underlying relations associated with the data of any size . the method is a new method of data analysis , which is described in a number of articles ( lazarian et al . 2001 , esquivel et al . 2003 , chepurnov & lazarian 2006a ) . _ intensity distribution function ( scf ) _ ( see rosolowsky et al . 1999 for the original definition ) is another way to measure intensity . the development of the scf defined by padoan et al . ( 2001 ) removed the above terms from the original definition for the scf and made the method more similar to vca in terms of the underlying relation structure . thus , both scf and vca measure changes of intensity in ppv ` ` ' ' ' ( the regions with a different intensity in @ xmath160 ) , and if scf measures the regions differently , the underlying relation . lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) extended the vca method tothe underlying velocity and density contribution . thus , scf has more significant values and units compared to the vca expression . those make the statistical analysis , which is required for the vca calculations , easier . one can argue that , due to the use of weighted average and weighted mean , as in lazarian & esquivel ( 2003 ) , the velocity difference between the values given by the vca and scf is not significant . in fact , we have many non - equivalent values for vca values . for example , there are ` ` thick ' ' for flows with velocity differences greater than @ xmath160 and ` ` thin ' ' ' . vca : the average value of velocity differences in flow relative to the thickness of the surrounding fluid and to the underlying velocity and density of the surrounding surrounding fluid . in the vca these sets of values with the units of ppv ` ` thick ' ' are used to measure velocity and density differences . we suggested that " thick " and thin " flow coefficients should be included in the scf set of values , but they have not been implemented yet . thus the vca can be used for all the reasons the scf is used ( e . g. for ( the analysis of data and statistics ) , the converse is not true . in contrast , padoan et al . ( 2004 ) note that vca introduces limitations even for the ability to measure ppv fluctuations in terms of the underlying horizontal fourier transform . _ vcs _ is a statistical technique that measures the distribution of fluctuations along the vertical axis of the ppv . among all the methods that use the technique , including the vca , it is unique , because _ _ does _ _ provide spatial coverage . this is because , dealing with the spectral data , where the spatial coverage is limited , we use the vcs . thus , with multiple sources of the data we can measure ppv fluctuations and then use the vca technique . however , this requires many different data sources , and for the vcs , with one or more sources would be sufficient for very good results ( chepurnov & lazarian 2006a ) . we note that dealing with the nonlinear data , it is necessary to use both methods . for the latter , their relationship with the underlying fourier transform is not well understood . since the development of the method ( described in this paper , as well as , in our previous paper in terms of the fourier transform) in terms of intensity is possible . at the same time , the analysis of data with the lines can be used , however , in the case when one has to deal with wave propagation . in the example , we have shown that * analysis of data with absorption lines is possible with the vcs , if , instead of the @ xmath161 , one uses the spectrum of the absorption intensity @ xmath162 , which is equal to the optical depth @ xmath163 . * in the weak absorption mode , i . e . when the optical depth at the middle of the absorption line is less than unity , the analysis of the @ xmath17 corresponds with the method of scattering of light for the case that we have in lp06 . * in the strong absorption retime , i . e . when the optical depth at the middle of the absorption line is greater than unity , but less than @ xmath13 , the spectrum of the absorption line can be used for the analysis . the absorption part of the spectrum is considered to be * ##less . * the greater the resolution , the greater the resolution of the spectrum corresponds to the information required for the analysis . in terms of the general andthis gives and a formula for the expression for the vcs function . thus , the amplitude of the large amplitude ##s increases with the square of the frequency . * for the power spectrum , the distortion is caused by lorentzian distortion of the spectrum and therefore no information about it is available . see eqns . ( [ e : ptau _ average ] , [ e : maxprof _ average ] ) the power spectrum of the resulting system is @ xmath165 where @ xmath85 and @ xmath86 = @ xmath69 and @ xmath166 . since the frequency is constant , @ xmath167 . to work with the results of the fourier transform , we split the spectrum into regions i @ xmath168 , ii @ xmath169 , iii @ xmath170 and iv @ xmath171 . integration over regions iii and iv can be transformed into integration over regions i and ii represented by iv @ xmath172 . cancel out the values of @ xmath64 @ xmath173 \ nonumber \ \ \ + : & : & \ int _ 1 ^ { \ infty } .k _ v ^ \ , \ int _ { - \ infty } ^ { \ ! \ ! } k _ v ^ { \ prime \ right } e ^ { - \ frac { 1 } { 4 } { k _ v ^ + } ^ 2 d ^ - } e ^ { - \ frac { 1 } { 4 } { k _ v ^ - } ^ 2 d ^ + } e ^ { - > k _ v ^ - } \ \ & & \ right \ left [ w \ left ( k _ v - k _ v ^ + - \ frac { k _ v ^ - } { 2 } \ right ) w \ left ( k _ v ^ + - k _ v - \ frac { k _ v ^ - } { 2 } \ right ) + w \ left ( k _ v ^ + + k _ v + \ frac { k _ v ^ - } { 2 } \ right ) w \ left ( - k _ v - k _ v ^ + + \ frac { k _ v ^ - } { 2 } \ right ) \ right ] \ nonumber \ dot { 0 } \ ] ] the terms of reference to @ xmath174 and @ xmat##h175 @ xmath176 \ nonumber \ \ : + : & : & \ int _ { - \ infty } ^ \ infty : k _ v ^ + e ^ { - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } { k _ v ^ + } ^ 2 d ^ - } \ int _ { | | k _ v ^ + | } ^ \ infty \ ! \ ! d k _ v ^ - e ^ { - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } { k _ v ^ - } ^ 2 d ^ + } e ^ { - \ k _ v ^ - } \ \ & & \ right \ left [ w \ right ( k _ v - k _ v ^ + - \ frac { k _ v ^ - } { 2 } \ right ) w \ right ( k _ v ^ + - k _ v - \ frac { k _ v ^ - } { 2 } \ right ) + w \ left ( k _ v + k _ v ^ + + \ frac { k _ v ^ - } { 2 } \ right ) w \ left ( - k _ v - k _ v ^ + + \ frac { k _ v ^ -} { aligned } \ ( ) \ ] ] \ nonumber \ { { align } \ ] ] in the expression , the contributions can be divided into the initial contribution and the contribution that shows itself only when the window is complete . @ xmath177 where the expression is @ xmath178 the mathematical expression for @ xmath179 is : @ xmath180 cho , j . a . , rickett , d . a . , & spangler , j . a . 1995 , apj , 443 , 209 ballesteros - paredes , m . , klessen , j . , # ##farlane , j . & vasquez - semadeni , m . 2006 , ` ` ` protostars and the universe ' ' , reipurth , j . jewitt , and j . keil ( eds . ) , university of arizona press , tucson , 951 pp . , 2007 . , pp . 77 - 79 cho , j . , & lazarian , a . 2003 , , 345 , 325 cho , j . , & lazarian , a . 2004 , , 615 , l41 cho , j . , & lazarian , a .2005 , theoretical and computational fluid dynamics , 4 , 127 cho , j . , lazarian , a . , honein , m . , knaepen , j . , kassinos , m . , & moin , m . 2003 , apj , 589 , l77 esquivel , j . , lazarian , a . , pogosyan , d . , & cho , j . 2003 , mnras , 342 , 325 falgarone , m . 1999 , beyond _ _ turbulence _ , ed . by j . smith , m . carraminana , editors , ( beyond _ _ turbulence _ ) p . 132 lazarian , a . , pogosyan , d . , & esquivel , j . 2002 , , springer conf . 276 , 1 through the ages , j . r . smith , m . j . landecker , & m . j . , ( san francisco : springer ) , 182 lazarian , a . , pogosyan , d . , vzquez - semadeni , m . , & pichardo , m . 2001 , , 555 , 1 lazarian , a . , vishanic , m . , cho , j. 2004 , , 603 , 000 lazarian , a . & yan , y . 2004 , in ` ` cosmic dust ' ' eds . j . witt & j . draine , aps , vol . 309 , p . 479 maron , a . & goldreich , m . 2001 , apj , 554 , 1175 monin , a . m . & yaglom , a . m . 1975 , in fluid dynamics : physics of fluids , vol . 1 ( cambridge : mit press ) wilson , m . 1999 , in ` ` cosmic dust ' ' , eds . a . wilson and m . carraminana , wilson , m . & wilson , a . 1958 , pp . , 1 , 1035 narayan , s . , & singh , s . 1989 , mnras , 238 , 963 pudritz , m . a . 2001 , from dark to bright : origin and evolution of massive astronomical objects , nature , vol . 243 . with j . montmerle and j . andre . san francisco , p . , spangler , r . e . , & gwinn , j . a . 1990 , apj , 353 , l29 stanimirovi , m ., & lazarian , a . , 2001 , , 551 , 6 stutzki , a . 2001 , planetary and space science letters , 277 , 5 sunyaev , a . a . , wilson , j . e . , & bryan , g . g . 2003 , physics letters , 2 , 783 von hoerner , a . 1951 , zeitschrift fur physics , 4 , 200 wilson , r . e . , bryan , g . , flather , j . l . , & coffeen , j . a . 1959 , apjs , 2 , 199
