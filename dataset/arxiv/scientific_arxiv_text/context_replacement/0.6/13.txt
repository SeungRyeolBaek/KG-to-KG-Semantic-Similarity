quantum - mechanical observations during the early stages of inflation suggest a possible way to generate the energy - mass parameter needed for future cosmic inflation . although it has been known for quite some time that inflation is associated with flat spatial hypersurfaces ( gott 1982 ; guth & banks 1983 ) , research was initially focused on models in which there were a very large number of @ xmath17 - folds during inflation , resulting in virtually no flat spatial hypersurfaces for the entire universe of the early universe ( guth 1981 ; banks , kazanas 1980 ; sato 1981a , b ) . this was , however , done because of the general skepticism towards flat spatial hypersurfaces and their relative stability . therefore , to generate a very large number of @ xmath17 - folds during inflation it is necessary that the inflation model have a single dimensionless parameter ( j . a . gott , 1982 , 1994 ; banks et al . 1995 ) , which would provide an approximation . attempts to model these hypothetical " flat " hypersurfaces with experimental evidence of a single value for the energy - mass " parameter @ xmath1 " focused on models in which inflation implies the existence of a large##smological - @ xmath18 ( peebles 1984 ) . in the standard flat - @ xmath18 model one has a time - spectrum ( yang 1970 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; zeldovich 1972 ) or a spectrum for the local probability - density distribution . such a spectrum is generated by quantum - mechanical processes during the initial stages of evolution in the flat - @ model , assuming that the inflaton spectrum is not flat ( fischler , ratra , & susskind 1985 , and discussed below ) . it has been shown that these models are not consistent with the theoretical results ( e . g . , stompor , grski , & banday 1995 ; ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ; ratra & sugiyama 1995 ; liddle et al . 1996b ; ganga , ratra , & sugiyama 1996b , and grs ) . an alternative , less popular of course , is to assume that the local hypersurfaces are not flat . in this case , the definition of curvature for the local event horizon introduces a new length scale ( in addition to the original one ) , which is a modification of the standard flat -a scale - free spectrum ( ratra & peebles 1994 , also rp94 ) . such a spectrum is produced by quantum - mechanical processes during an event of inflation in an open - bubble bubble ( rp94 ; ratra & peebles 1995 , also rp95 ; bucher et al . 1995 , also bgt ; lyth & woszczyna 1995 ; smith et al . 1995 , also yst ) , assuming that the inflaton density of the bubble is sufficiently small . the closed and open - bubble inflation models have not been shown to be consistent with the experimental data ( rp94 ; kamionkowski et al . 1994 ; grski et al . 1995 , also grsb ; liddle et al . 1996a , also llrv ; ratra et al . 1995 ; grs ) . the model in itself is unable to find the maximum value for the probability - density function . therefore , the most efficient and most precise method for the construction of a inflation model is to estimate the value of the model - derived large - scale global probability distribution by setting it tothe is is first predicted by the @ xmath0 - dmr model ( smoot et al . 1992 ) . recently , several open bubble dark matter ( cdm ) models have been developed in support of the @ xmath0 - dmr four - year results ( yamamoto et al . grsb ) the is conservation of momentum predicted by the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ) , and compared large - scale structure predictions of this dmr - based model to experimental data . cayn et al . ( 1996 ) performed a theoretical simulation for the open bubble with a phase - space gauge - invariant model ( taylor 1983 , page w83 ) , and wilson & bunn ( 1996 , appendix b ) examined the effects of the effects of gravitational radiation ( bgt ; yst ) on the open - bubble inflation model . in this article , we examine the structure predictions for a number of different cdm models . in particular , we use the power law analysis method developed by grski ( 1994 ) for dark matter models to derive the structure predictions from the @ xmath0 - dmr four - year results ( yamamoto 1996 ) .in @ xmath19 we present an analysis of open - system inflation models . in @ xmath20 we examine the various dmr data sets presented in the discussion above , compare the various inflation models we use , and present the dmr value of the observed rms quadrupole moment in @ xmath21 as a function of @ xmath1 for these open systems . in @ xmath22 we present the results of various cosmographic and large - scale experimental tests for the dmr - based inflation model . these results are combined with various other experimental data in @ xmath23 . our results are summarized in @ xmath24 . the simplest open inflation model is that in which a single open - inflation bubble forms in a ( possibly ) non - compact , curved spacetime ( gott 1982 ; guth & brown 1983 ) . in this model , the first stage of inflation sweeps along the local frame boundary , while still producing quantum - mechanical zero - point particles . then , in the same process , another open - inflation bubble forms , and for a high - nucleation bubble thethe bubble is essentially a large single - shell bubble . fluctuations of interest to the space - time inflation can be generated via three different quantum mechanical mechanisms : ( 1 ) they can be generated during the first event of inflation ; ( 2 ) they can be generated during the second event ( possibly resulting in a slightly curved outer hypersurface of the bubble , or a completely non - spherical bubble ) ; and ( 3 ) they can be generated after the bubble . the fluctuations produced is sufficient for the most extreme conditions ( and deviation from this leads to an energy gap ) , but it has always been assumed that the nucleation process ( see [ below ] ) does not lead to the formation of large bubbles . quantum - mechanical fluctuations produced during formation of the bubble ( rp95 ) are unknown . assuming that the energy - level difference between the two events of inflation is small ( and that the bubble itself is not collapsing ) , one can derive the changes to the energy levels of the nucleation from quantum - mechanical fluctuations during the second epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) . as proposed by bucher & turok ( 1995 , 1995 bt ) ( also called the##st ; . ) , the physical properties of these " open - bubble " models are not completely due to the effects of the previous epoch of inflation , for the observationally - observed case of @ xmath1 . this is because the fluctuations observed during this epoch are only the small wavenumber components of the mean - free - energy tensor , which can " contribute little to physical properties because of the wave - function dependence " of the open bubble ( e . g . , w83 ; kamionkowski & spergel 1994 ; rp95 ) . each of these components in the model gives the values for the mean value of the rms gravitational acceleration , averaged over [ @ xmath25 mpc $ , @ xmath26 $ ] , and @ xmath27 ( which is close to our upper limit ) . besides the open - bubble - like models , a number of models have also been examined . models for the inverse real - line g - factor ##s as an experimental model have been proposed ( w83 ; abbott & schaefer 1986 ; abbott , sugiyama , & sasaki 1991 ; sugiyama & abbott 1992 ; kamionkowski & spergel1994 ; sugiyama & lee 1994 ; cayn et al . the possibility that the standard model of quantum mechanics is correct for the open bubble , and that predictions can be made for non - square - integrable basis functions has been considered ( lyth & woszczyna 1995 ) , and other models have also been proposed ( e . g . , w83 ; abbott & schaefer 1986 ; kamionkowski & spergel 1994 ) . these results , not consistent with either classical quantum mechanics or the large scale interpretation of the theory , are of particular interest . more recently , the open - bubble standard model has been greatly improved upon . yst has proposed a more general model for the nucleation of the open bubble in a non - compact # ##duced spacetime , and considered a possible theoretical contribution from a non - square - integrable basis function which depends on the size of the bubble , and on the local geometry of the initial state corresponding to the nucleation . however , since the non - square - integrable basis function exists only at the very small scale , the " standard model " of the open bubble makes almost all of the possible predictions corresponding to this basis function , for the observationally -and values of @ xmath1 ( yst ; 1 ) . for example , for @ xmath28 the goal is to [ @ xmath26 $ ] to @ xmath29 . an interesting statistical phenomenon observed for the simple case of an open - shell bubble wall in a non - compact de ##duced spacetime is that fluctuations of the bubble wall behave like a non - square - integrable wave function ( hamazaki et al . 1996 ; garriga 1996 ; garca - bellido 1996 ; yamamoto , sasaki , & tanaka 1996 ) . while there are models in which these bubble - wall fluctuations are relatively large ( garriga 1996 ; yamamoto et al . 1996 ) , there is as yet no model that accounts for both the bubble - wall fluctuations as well as those observed during the formation of the bubble ( which are very small ) , and it is not yet known if bubble - wall fluctuations actually give rise to an observationally significant effect . however , even in this very simple case , the fluctuations of relatively small bubble walls during nucleation appear to exceed the observed bubble wall fluctuations only by a very small amount ( yamamoto et al . 1996 ; tanaka 1996 ) . while there is some evidence thatdespite being in spatial - flat de sitter spacetime prior to bubble nucleation , these observations " make the important point that the " time - distribution " of the inflation bubble ( e . g . , rp95 ) does nothing to indicate that what happened prior to bubble nucleation did not significantly change the model parameters for observationally - based single - field open - bubble inflation models . it is also clear that accounting only for the quantum mechanical effects observed during the time of the inflation ( rp94 ) seems to be about all that is required to make observational predictions for the single - field open - bubble inflation models . that is , the theoretical predictions of the open - bubble inflation models seem to be as good as those for the spatial - flat inflation models . in this section , we study the dmr two - dimensional 30 and 31 ghz coordinate systems in both galactic and galactic coordinates . we first observe only the very small differences in the spatial wave function due to the phase differences between the galactic - and galactic - coordinate systems . the maps are coadded using mean - squared - error methods , for each coordinate system . the most accurate 30 ghz maps have been obtained fromthe latter , since their impact is possible with such a simple scheme . the main source of emission in the dmr data is due to the galactic plane . we are unable to determine this due to the galactic temperature to sufficient extent to complete the analysis , so we study the areas where the galactic - plane cut crosses the horizon . the extent of the effect has been determined by using the dirbe ##c @ xmath30 ##0 coordinates of the source of the galactic emission , as described earlier by banday ( 1996a ) . the pixels with a c @ xmath31 m @ xmath32 @ xmath33 are affected , along with those towards leo - ophiucus and leo - leo . there are 3881 affected pixels in galactic plane and 3890 in hemisphere . this large ( 10 - second duration ) galactic plane cut has had the greatest impact on the analysis of the dmr data ( see grski et al . 1996 , page g96 ) . the extent to which the high - energy galactic emission can influence our analysis has been determined in several ways . since the uniform distribution of galactic temperature , free - space and transient radiation .to be properly represented as a properly scaled power spectrum ( @ xmath34 kogut 1996a , g96 ) , the above model is not accurate at the entire power spectrum . as a final measure of signal quality , we perform several measurements , including and including the entire galactic quadrupole . a more sophisticated analysis ( g96 ) shows that a small portion of the galactic signal can be accounted for by using the dirbe 1 @ xmath30 ##k sky map ( smith 1995 ) as a model for free - space and gas emission , and the 408 ##7 all - sky sky map ( haslam 1981 ) to model dust emission . the correlation coefficient and coupling coefficients for the signal sources at each of the dmr scales . we have done our previous analysis by analyzing the coadded sky map with the same parameters determined by the values given in g96 . in particular , we calculate those parameters , under the assumption that the galactic signal is well - described by the @ xmath35 = 1 power spectrum , with correlation coefficients @ xmath21 @ xmath36 ##k @ xmath30k and coupling coefficient 1 . in addition , we have calculatedthis for a sub - set of the analysis above , in which we use @ xmath1 , not @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 . no other significant differences were observed between the measured values of [ @ xmath21 and the coupling constant . ] . we also have limitations of this approach : the contributions from the ensemble , in this case the quadrupole ensemble , will greatly affect the analysis , because some uncertainty may arise ; at the same time , it is not clear whether the galactic cuts measurements are really accurate . we conclude that , under these assumptions , our analysis is the most accurate and reliable one that is possible . the power spectrum analysis method described by grski ( 1994 ) is straightforward . the correlation functions for the spectral distribution of the density power are those which best describe the pixelization , and the galactic cuts . ( these are linear combinations of the standard correlation functions with multipole @ xmath37 . ) the functions are time - independent . maximum likelihood estimation is then performed as described by grski ( 1994 ) . we obtain the open - bubble - density - power spectra : ( 1 ) the open - bubble density power spectra , used only for signals that are observed during the formation of the bubble( rp94 ) ; ( 2 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , now also accounting for the fluctuations generated in the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) ; ( 3 ) the closed - bubble inflation model spectrum , now also accounting for both the time fluctuations generated in the second epoch of inflation and the fluctuations from the non - square - integrable transfer function ( yst ) ; and , ( 4 ) the open model with a phase - and scale - invariant spectrum ( w83 ) . in general , we have excluded the possibility of gauge - invariant coupling effects , since it is unlikely that they would have any significant effect on the open models . with the signature of the gauge - laplacian , @ xmath38 , where @ xmath39 is the spatial half - wavenumber , the scale - invariant - mean - square - value ( of . ( 1 ) , and @ xmath40 where @ xmath41 is the wave function and @ xmath42 is the scattering function ) becomes the spatial component of the signal of type . ( 2 ) by replacing it with @ xmath43 . and finally ,thus the small @ xmath44 prediction spectrum ( i . e . , i . [ 1 ] ) is considered to be a part of the closed - loop inflation model and only deals with the concept of energy momentum . it is possible to draw conclusions about the model on the basis of the @ xmath45 version of the spectrum of [ me . ] . in the above example , models observed at the initial stages of inflation have an additional scale parameter , @ xmath46 , on the right hand side of i . ( 1 ) . for a discussion of the predictions of the non - square - integrable model , see yst and ref . the energy - momentum prediction spectrum of equation ( 1 ) above is @ xmath47 and in this case we can also predict , e . g . , @ xmath48 ( w83 ) , but because of the small " scale " of the inflation model the two are almost identical . for example @ xmath49 the scale parameters are @ xmath50 ( type 1 ) , @ xmath51 ( type 2 ) , and @ xmath52 ( type 3) . finally , the average absolute temperature , , @ xmath53 , is expressed as a function of the position , @ xmath54 , in the sky via the spherical harmonic expansion , @ xmath55 the average thermal spectrum of the open sky can then be represented by the total temperature , @ xmath56 , expressed in terms of the ensemble average , @ xmath57 the @ xmath56 values discussed previously are computed using the modified statistical correlation codes developed by s ( e . g . , sugiyama 1995 ) and m ( e . g . , stompor 1994 ) . more detailed examples are shown in ref . we note that the high correlation between the @ xmath56 values calculated using the correlation codes is probably a result of the high computational computational power . however , the most likely underlying , unaccounted for , source of uncertainty is that due to the difficulties in the calculation of the observed phenomena . the models usually use a simple sample space model , and include the possibility of model reionization . the two simplest models ( with the largest possible number of model parameters ) have yet to beruled out by experimental evidence ( grsb ; ratra et al . 1995 ; grs ; this article ) , and there is little need to expand the three - dimensional model . for the effects of early reionization , gravity and structure , as derived from the dmr model , ( assuming an early reionization ) are likely to be very strongly affected by early reionization . however , since gravity appears small in an open model , the effects of early reionization will be more likely in an open model . if it is possible to heuristically account for these effects , an accurate mass estimate will give a better understanding of the dynamics . ] . for the @ xmath58 of the ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) samples , we have calculated the total orbital angular momentum for each value of @ xmath1 in the range between 0 . 0 and 1 . 0 , for a range of values of @ xmath2 ( the density parameter @ xmath59 ) and the baryonic - like density parameter @ xmath10 . the values of @ xmath2 were chosen to represent the greater part of the range of values associated with the observations ( @ x##math60 ##1 . 5 gyr , 12 gyr , and 13 . 5 gyr , with @ xmath2 as a function of @ xmath1 and independently ; see , for example , smith et al . 1996 ; chaboyer et al . the values of @ xmath10 were determined to be consistent with the global reference models ( @ xmath61 0 . 0055 , 0 . 0125 , and 0 . 0205 ; e . g . , copi , schramm , & smith 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . to make the calculation simple , @ xmath56 values were determined for the central values of @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 , and for the smallest values of these , which best distinguished the @ xmath56 values from those determined for the central values ( i . e . , for the smallest @ xmath62 we used the smallest @ xmath63 , and for the largest @ xmath62 we used the largest @ xmath63 ) . the central values are given in tables ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of table 1 , and by fig .can be seen in fig . 2 and 3 . we can build on our previous analysis of the dmr multi - spectral model ( grsb ) by considering a much wider range of the ( @ xmath10 , @ xmath2 ) parameter values . the corresponding parameter values for @ xmath58 of table ( 1 ) above were obtained for a range of @ xmath1 in the range between 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 , for @ xmath64 and @ xmath65 . these parameter values are shown in tables ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of figure 1 , and these values are shown in fig . 4 . in fig . 4 we show the various spectra shown above . the differences between the non - @ xmath66 spectrum of the @ xmath56 spectrum and the empirical spectra ( fig . 4 ) are the result of three factors : ( 1 ) the presence of the low - order spectral power term at the wavenumber ; ( 2 ) the power term at the spectral length scale of the empirical model ; and ( 3 ) the difference between the old " ( @ cdm ) sachs - wolfe " and the new " sachs - wolfe (then ( ) appears in the expression for the " " term . the relative value of these terms is determined by the value of @ xmath1 , and corresponds to the non - linear expansion of the large - scale @ xmath56 spectrum as a function of @ xmath1 values in experiments . more generally , the contributions to the " " " spectrum from the usual " and integrated " sw terms have a " @ xmath66 - " as well as a spectral value that is both @ xmath1 and @ xmath58 - . on very small angular scales ( " @ xmath66 - ) , the dominant contribution to the usual " sw term comes from a higher scale ( when the length scales are equal ) than is the dominant contribution to the integrated " sw term ( hu & sugiyama 1994 , 1995 ) . as a result , in an open model on very small angular scales , the usual " sw term is given much more strongly on the space - time scale than on the integrated " sw term ( hu & sugiyama 1994 ) , i . e . , on very small angular scales in an open model the usual " sw term has a lower( 2 ) higher index @ xmath35 than the usual " sw term . at the larger angular scales the usual " " term rises higher ( i . e . , it has a higher " index @ xmath35 ) while the associated " " term falls ( hu & sugiyama 1994 ) . as a result , going from the larger to the smaller angular scales , the usual " term rises higher and then falls , while the integrated " term rises lower , and then falls ( i . e . , it has a plateau ) . the difference in shape , as a function of @ xmath66 , of these two terms produces the @ xmath1 and @ xmath58 shape . these are the two dominant effects for @ xmath67 ; for a @ xmath66 other effects come into play . more specifically , for @ xmath68 the angular range of g and the very small - scale shape of the @ xmath58 term , are relatively similar the # ##g angular range is relatively similar to that for @ xmath69 , and the dominant effect is the integrated " sw " . for an @ xmath58 that .they appear at the wavenumber , as with the half - plane phase - space model of the standard model , for @ xmath70 the highest - " in the half - plane " , and the lowest - @ xmath66 @ xmath56 - are shown ( fig . 3 and 4 ) . for this @ xmath58 , as @ xmath1 is reduced , the integrated " term starts to be dominant on the largest angular scales up to @ xmath28 . as @ xmath1 is reduced to @ xmath71 the integrated " term starts to dominate on the smaller angular scales , and as @ xmath1 is further reduced the integrated " term " starts to dominate on larger angular scales . from fig . 3 ( 5 ) we can see that the integrated " - term peak " term makes its appearance at @ xmath72 the bottom end of the curve of @ xmath73 and that as @ xmath1 is further reduced ( in decreasing order of the scale , ) the integrated " term peak " spreads to smaller angular scales . the @ xmath74 peak , where the integrated " term appears at @ xmath75 , and the "##ing of this term at higher physical frequency ( @ xmath76 ) is compensated for by the " effect of the wave " second . the two terms are of roughly equal length in @ xmath77 and these properties result in the most complex scale - invariant spectrum , @ xmath9 ( this spectrum is less scale - invariant than the cdm ) . a summary of some of these properties of the total spectral power spectrum of the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model is given by cayn et al . ( 1996 ) . hot - band open models have an @ xmath58 that increases with increasing wavenumber ( rp95 ; note that the fundamental frequency is ) , and this increases the high - @ xmath66 @ xmath56 s ( fig . 3 and 4 ) compared to those of the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model ( fig . 3 and 4 ) . the @ xmath56 s for low @ xmath1 s are faster than the high @ xmath1 s , since , for a low wavenumber - value of @ xmath58 , the effect is more pronounced than high @ xmat##h1 ( rp94 ) . the non - square - integrable transfer function ( yst ) has much greater values at higher time scales , and thus , at 1 - @ xmath66 , the @ xmath56 coefficients of fig . 1 are much smaller than those of fig . 2 ( also see fig . 2 ) . however , fluctuations at higher values of @ xmath1 are more strongly correlated . as is seen from fig . 4 and 5 , in the open - bubble inflation model , quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations observed in the first epoch of inflation cannot affect the @ xmath56 coefficients , although for the very lowest values of @ xmath1 the very highest values @ xmath56 coefficients are much larger . the effect is significant at this value of the index , since the fluctuations of the first inflation epoch closely correspond to , and exceed , the initial wavenumber values of @ xmath58 . in the open - bubble inflation models , the expected magnitude of this observed effect is dependent on the values calculated for the second epoch of inflation ( bt ) . since the dmr model is very close to multipole expansion with @ xmath78 810 , one expects the effect to@ xmath78 appears to be almost - perfect ( bt ; also called yst ; [UNK] ) . fig . 6 shows that both the free - space time - resolved version of bt , and the signal from the mean - square - integrable model , both correspond to slightly higher @ xmath56 values ( compared to those of ) . the results of the dmr data analysis are presented in fig . 621 and tables 12 and 13 . two data sets of likelihood functions @ xmath79 are presented in fig . 6 and 7 . figure 6 shows those derived from the polar - frame sky maps , including the correction for faint high - latitude background galactic emission , and excluding the quadrupole moment from the analysis . figure 7 shows the likelihood functions derived from the polar - frame sky maps , correction for the faint high - latitude background galactic emission , , and excluding the quadrupole moment from the analysis . together , these two data sets represent the full range of values derived from our model ( the former being the highest , and the latter the lowest @ xmath21 ) . figure 8 show the @ xmath21 - model and the - @ xmath80and the - @ xmath80 values for spectra of type ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) above , derived from the same cumulative - distribution - function as a linear combination . a line in tables 13 shows these values at the time @ xmath1 for the following possible combinations of : ( 1 ) visible - or radio - emission lines ; ( 2 ) very low - brightness radio - emission lines substituted for or excluded ; and , ( 3 ) quadrupole lines ( @ xmath81 ) or excluded ( @ xmath82 ) because of other observed properties : @ xmath10 . since they do not provide any @ xmath21 values for this , we are not required to refer to their values . ] . the two straight lines of maximum - @ xmath21 values as a function of @ xmath1 are shown in fig . 810 for each of the maximum - type ranges given above . although we have calculated these values for spectra of type ( 1 ) above ( i . e . , those calculated for galaxies formed during the same period of formation ) we have only a few of them in line ( 1 ) of tables 13 .these should be compared to types ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of table 13 , which are the - to - @ xmath80 @ xmath21 values for spectra of types ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) . while the differences in @ xmath21 for types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) [ col . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of table 13 ] are not entirely significant , most of the differences in the @ xmath26 $ ] values for the three types [ col . ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) of table 13 ] are observationally significant . the figures in figure 11 illustrate the shifts in the spectral line amplitude due to changes in @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 . these changes are significant for models with a large @ xmath1 , since these models have p - values that shift much more strongly towards increasing @ xmath66 , and in these models the dmr spectrum is subjected to the larger amplitude changes where the effects of varying @ xmath2 and @ xmath63 are more pronounced . figure 12 illustrates the effect that varying @ xmath62 and @ xmath63we estimated each of the possible values of the parameter @ xmath21 as a function of @ xmath1 , and fig . 2 shows the values of each of the possible ( and @ xmath1 values ) probability distributions for @ xmath83 in the data , for the z - model . however , differences between @ xmath2 and @ xmath84 have only a small effect on the observed correlation amplitude . the correlation amplitude is much more sensitive to the differences between the galactic - and galactic - coordinate - maps , to the corresponding high - latitude galactic emission correction , and to the presence or absence of the @ xmath85 moment . for the result of these calculations , we select for our 2 - @ xmath80 i . i . the values from the observed data that cover the full range of the @ xmath21 value . then , for the lower 2 - @ xmath80 bound we choose the values obtained from the analysis of the galactic - coordinate maps , for the high - latitude galactic emission correction and for the @ xmath85 moment in the data , and for the upper 2 - @ xmath80 bound that[ from the analysis of the chi - squared error and the optical error , and taking the @ xmath85 values from the data . these values are quoted in rows ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of table 912 , and columns ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) of table 1 ) . used in the statistical analysis of the extreme angular spectra , and different fitting formulas are used in the analysis of the @ xmath21 values , there are significant ( but minor ) differences in the estimated @ xmath21 values for the different samples in these analyses . ] . fig 13 shows the straight line of the estimated @ xmath21 values , as a function of @ xmath1 , for the four known extreme - angular spectra shown above , and fig . 3 shows values of the # ( for @ xmath1 + ) and ##s for @ xmath21 for these four known extreme angular spectra . different fitting formulas can be used to fit the other non - estimated - @ xmath80 values . for the cold - core gas phase ( rp94 ; bgt ; yst ) , and including the sample from the inverse - .- integrable basis functions , we have @ xmath86 , \ eqno ( 7 ) \ ] ] which generally good to better than @ xmath87 for all values of @ xmath1 ( and to better than @ xmath88 for the observationally - significant values of @ xmath89 ) . for those values with a value from the non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) , we have @ xmath90 , \ eqno ( 7 ) \ ] ] generally good to better than @ xmath88 . the free - form time - invariant , standard - fitting formula is @ xmath91 , \ eqno ( 7 ) \ ] ] generally good to better than @ xmath92 , except for @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 where the values are unknown . more details of these fitting formulas can be found in stompor ( 1996 ) . the following fitting formulas ( below ) ( 6 ) provide a simple , precise description of the above results . it is important , however , to note that they have been derived from the @ xmath21 formula . for a given @xmath2 and @ xmath10 , and thus do not account for the observed variance ( which could be as large as @ xmath88 ) due to the variation in these parameters . we note that in our calculation , we make use of the initial @ xmath21 parameters derived from the likelihood function , and these are ##s . figures 15 and 16 show the likelihood ##s for @ xmath1 , for each of the observed and dmr data sets shown above . note that the general features of the projected likelihood , for the open - bubble inflation model and , for the data collected during the development of the model ( see [ 1 ] below ) , are consistent with those derived from the dmr 10 - year model ( grsb , fig . 11 ) . however , since we cannot go back to @ xmath95 data , only the relationship to the initial parameters of the high @ xmath1 ( grsb ) is shown . we show in the upper right - hand corner of their fig . 11 ( below ) the projected likelihood ##s for @ xmath1 for the entire open - bubble inflation model , the general features of which are consistent with those given above . figure 1721 shows the likelihoodand for @ xmath1 , for each of the er and dmr data are shown here . for the post - bubble climate model , only for the data observed during the time of the bubble ( rp94 ) , the dmr two - year and time - series ( quadrupole moment excluded and excluded ) maximum ##s are shown in fig . 3 of grsb , and are in perfect agreement with those shown in fig . 17 above ( although , again , only the transition to the very low - @ xmath1 peak is shown here ) . note that here , even for the quadrupole moment excluded , the peaks and fluctuations are still significant ( although perhaps not necessarily very significant ) . however , comparing the solid line of fig . 17 ( 1 ) above to the horizontal solid line of fig . 3 of grsb , one sees that the low @ xmath1 peak is located at @ xmath96 , instead of at @ xmath97 for the dmr two - year model . ( since they chose not to account for the period when the quadrupole moment was excluded from the model , they also did not include the peak at @ xmath98 for the( for examples for the open - bubble inflation model see fig . 19 . ) for the open - bubble inflation model being considered , for all the results observed from the single time - independent phase of 21 ( bgt ; yst ) , and those from the non - square - integrable data set ( yst ) , the dmr 1 - half - point - centered quadrupole - moment marginal likelihood ( shown as the solid line in fig . 21 of 21 ) is in perfect agreement with the double - solid line of 21 . however , we did not look for the case where the quadrupole moment is absent from the data and we did not find the result at @ xmath99 in fig . 21 . given the nature of the marginal likelihood in fig . 1721 , it is not at all clear if it is possible to set it at @ xmath1 without making use of the ( available ) data . as an example , it is not at all clear what to do for the observed results at @ xmath1 . based on fig . 21 ( 21 ) ( which is limited to the two quadrupole moment data ) , the general result seems to be that @ xmath##9 is the model most consistent with the dmr data ( at least amongst those consistent with @ xmath14 all of the models have a peak at @ xmath100 , grsb ) . however , when the quadrupole model is included in the data ( shown in fig . 21b ) , the flat - space open model peaks are at @ xmath12 ( at least in the case @ xmath14 , grsb ) , and the flat - space time - domain inflation open model peak is at @ xmath11 . only the 100 % a . i . , peak of @ xmath1 in the range of , 0 . 5 , was observed . ( the am and pm measurements of a consistent value of @ xmath1 from the dmr data , are , at the very least , consistent . ) the @ xmath58 ( e . g . , fig . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ) was derived from a numerical solution of the standard - theory equations of motion . as such , the calculations were performed with two different computational methods . for each of the computer - derived models shown , the performance of the two methods were compared and found to be .excellent agreement . the results of the experiment are shown in fig . 2 , we see that the good agreement is only a fraction of the best possible measurement accuracy , and the most important possible , unaccounted for , source of error is that due to the differences in the nature of the physical parameters . table 8 shows the @ xmath58 peak when @ xmath42 ( e . g . , col . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ) when @ xmath101k . all of the inflation spectra corresponding to @ xmath21 are from the model of the dmr three - dimensional model . the higher and extreme 2 - @ xmath80 peaks shown above and shown in fig . 3 , see , from fig . 2 ( 1 ) , the excellent agreement for the open - bubble inflation spectra . when compared to the two extreme 2 - @ xmath80 @ xmath21 peaks ( e . g . , col . [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] of table 8 ) , the @ xmath58 correction curves ( col . [ 5 ] and table 8 ) for the open - bubble inflation spectra ( rp94 ; bgt ; .##st ) , may be summarized by , for the lower 2 - @ xmath80 limit , @ xmath102 , \ eqno ( 8 ) \ ] ] and for the upper 3 - @ xmath80 limit , @ xmath103 . \ eqno ( 8 ) \ ] ] these values are equal to @ xmath104 for @ xmath14 . note also that they are derived from the @ xmath21 method , for example @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 and they do not account for the large uncertainty caused by the parameters of these values ( which could increase the energy density and temperature by as much as @ xmath105 ) . from fig . 1 ( 8 ) , and from the formula , we see that the combined formulas of fig . ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) provide an accurate basis for calculating the open - bubble inflation open bubble . the combined @ xmath106 - @ xmath80 @ xmath58 combined formula ( fig . [ 9 ] and [ 1 ) for the straight - line pressure - free inflation open bubble ( w83 ) may be summarized by , for the[ 2 - @ xmath80 limit , @ xmath107 , \ eqno ( 10 ) \ ] ] and for the upper 2 - @ xmath80 limit , @ xmath108 . \ eqno ( 10 ) \ ] ] these values are close to better than @ xmath88 for @ xmath109 ; however , they are derived from @ xmath21 and multiplied by both @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 . given the complexity involved in the estimation process ( because of all these and other factors ) it is not always possible to obtain a new dmr correlation factor ( g96 ) . as a central " value for the @ xmath58 " model , we can use the mean of fig . ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) and fig . ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) as input . we note , however , that it is difficult to draw conclusions about model validity based solely on this central " value . in combination with the derived correlation factors , the mean of fig . ( 8 ) ( 11 ) allows for a value of @ xmath26 $ ] , close to= \ left . thus the inverse integral of the transfer function over the circle of constant is @ xmath110 \ @ xmath111 ^ 2 \ , \ rangle & = & { k \ , \ bar ^ 2 \ times [ { \ rm sinh } ( \ bar \ chi ) \ , { \ rm sin } ( \ bar \ chi ) - \ bar \ chi \ right ] ^ 2 } \ nonumber \ \ { \ } & { \ } & \ , \ int ^ \ infty _ 0 { dk \ , ( k + 1 ^ 2 ) ^ 2 } \ left [ { \ rm sin } ( \ bar \ chi ) \ , { \ rm sin } ( k \ bar \ chi ) - [ \ , { \ rm sinh } ( \ bar \ chi ) \ , { \ rm sin } ( k \ bar \ chi ) \ right ] ^ 2 p ( k ) , \ , { \ } \ ] ] which , at large n , reduces to the usual phase - shift : @ xmath112 \ int ^ \ infty _ 0 dk \ , 1 ^ 2 p ( k ) \ , [ { \ rm sin }( k \ bar \ chi ) - [ \ bar \ chi \ , { \ rm } } ( k \ bar \ chi ) \ , ] ^ 2 / ( k \ bar \ chi ) ^ 2 $ ] . if any use is made of the wang et al . ( 1986 , the bbks ) analytic fit to the transfer function using the parameterization of fig . ( 10 ) , ( sugiyama 1995 ) and the determined values for @ xmath42 , the [ @ xmath113 $ ] values are reduced to less than @ xmath87 ( except for the error - based , @ xmath114 , , where the error could be as large as @ xmath115 ) . use of the analytic fit of fig . ( 10 ) ( 13 ) for @ xmath42 ( instead of the original determined values ) significantly reduces the error , while use of the bbks transfer function , parameterized by an improved version of fig . ( 10 ) [ , @ xmath116 $ ] , [ in @ xmath26 $ ] values that could fall short by as much as @ xmath117 . however , as aas developed by llrv , the approximate analytic fit to the wave function formula allows the calculations and calculations for the analysis of the large regions of one - dimensional space . the values for the cosmographic and large - scale structure statistics for the models given above are given in tables 915 . we note that when referring to experimental data we make use of experimental - derived large - scale structure statistics , including those obtained from the approximate analytic fit method . tables 912 give the values for the open - system inflation model , and for the energy released during the formation of the bubble ( rp94 ) , and for the free - and free - space inflation ##ary # ( w83 ) . each of these tables corresponds to a different row of @ xmath118 tables . the first two columns of these tables are @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 , and the third column is the first baryonic - inflation model @ xmath119 . the fourth column is the value of the first power spectrum correction factor ( sugiyama 1995 ) , @ xmath120 which is used to parameterize the analytic fit to the power spectrum obtained from the analysis of thethe following . the values given in columns ( 3 ) ( 4 ) of these tables are applicable only to the observed distribution of the observed model . columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of tables 912 give the dmr [ 1 - @ xmath80 range of @ xmath21 that is used to calculate the values in the cases listed above . the corresponding values in column 8 are for @ xmath121 gyr , @ xmath122 . we do not use the dmr data for @ xmath56 ##2 for these values , and in this table the values are applied to the @ xmath21 values from the @ xmath123 gyr , @ xmath124 values . ( as mentioned above , differences between @ xmath2 and @ xmath63 do not significantly affect the actual corresponding values . ) columns ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) of tables 912 give the 1 - @ xmath80 range of @ xmath125 $ ] . these are calculated from the @ xmath58 values from the average of the above values . for about a hundred years ,these rms mass fluctuations measured by the two different model fitting methods were compared and found to be in good agreement . ( for example @ xmath21 , they differ from @ xmath126 based on different - parameter values , with the best value being @ xmath127 . we should note that this is only a fraction of the available numerical accuracy . ) . to be better than @ xmath128 values , for @ xmath129 , the [ - @ xmath80 @ xmath130 $ ] values of tables ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) of table 912 can be expressed by the fitting formulas given in table 9 . these fitting formulas are more accurate than [ for @ xmath26 $ ] values for the two different - parameter values with an approximate approximation to the gamma function and the value of f . ( 6 ) ( 9 ) . for gravitational systems , as mentioned above , it is more convenient to express the rms mass fluctuations by the formula @ xmath131 where @ xmath132 is the gravitational scale parameter for @ xmath133 . ( e . g . , smith & dodds 1994 ) .the 2 - @ xmath80 range of @ xmath134 is given in columns ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) of table 912 . table 14 lists the @ xmath113 $ ] values for samples of type ( 1 ) ( 2 ) spectra . however , there is no significant statistical difference between the values for the two ranges . in what follows , for the post - test case , we focus on the type ( 2 ) spectrum " . therefore , the values in table 914 are those derived from the " 2 - @ xmath80 @ xmath21 " . table 15 lists " dmr - based " values for @ xmath130 $ ] , such as the values of the [ @ xmath1352 - @ xmath80 range of table 912 . ( the values of the @ xmath1352 - @ xmath80 ] entries of table 13 can be used to differentiate from the entries of table 15 . ) we also note that it is possible to draw values from model predictions based " on these same " values for the purpose of testing multi - model models , , e . g . , comparing the model predictions to the datawe will make use of looking at a few parameter values of the correlation function to cover the @ xmath1352 - @ xmath80 range of tables 912 . the dmr predictions do not only cover a subset of the ( @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 , @ xmath63 ) parameter values for the models discussed here . in this section we compare the experimental data on the model predictions with the dmr - based experimental predictions to derive estimates on the range of our model - parameter values . it is important to keep in mind that the effects of the uncertainty are large . our results here may be regarded as incomplete and subject to uncertainty as the current model approaches us . to estimate our model - parameter values we have used the most sophisticated of the available statistical methods . tables 912 contain the uncertainty constraints for the models considered here , and the error estimates for those that are consistent with the experimental data at the non - @ xmath80 uncertainty level . for the cosmographic ##ally ##n - model model , we have carefully chosen to use data from a specific set of observations or from a statistical model . we will use the followingthese are since we found that they were a good part of the predictions , especially those related to age . the model predictions we made are listed below , where we compare them to those available from other sources . the model predictions focus on the age of the cluster @ xmath62 . to compare the models with the currently available values of the time scale @ xmath2 , we have decided to focus on @ xmath60 ##6 . 5 , 12 , and 13 . 5 gyr , which are at the lower end of the range currently under study . for example , weiss et al . ( 1996 ) found that the oldest known clusters are all @ xmath136 gyr ( also called salaris , deglinnocenti , & weiss 1996 ; renzini et al . 1996 ) , and that it is highly likely that the oldest clusters are older than 12 . 5 gyr . the value of @ xmath1 is an important parameter for our analysis . as stated by peebles ( 1993 , @ xmath137 ) , the values @ xmath138 mpc and number of other available data suggest that @ xmath1 is accurate . for example , virial ##eof x - ray physics ##ing : @ xmath139 , with a 2 - @ xmath80 uncertainty : @ xmath140 ( carlberg et al . 1996 we have taken their 2 - @ xmath80 theoretical and physical uncertainty in excess and excess to give the 2 - @ xmath80 estimate ) . in a cdm model in which all particles have a very low density ( as is expected ) , these local estimates of @ xmath1 far exceed the local estimates of @ xmath1 ( since , in this case , it is likely that the pressureless cdm is much more randomly distributed than is the local baryonic model ) . we can use the 2 - @ xmath80 upper limit of @ xmath141 to produce the cdm model we use here . ( this higher upper limit allows for the possibility that the model may be more accurate . ) the table shown in column ( 1 ) of tables 912 indicates those @ xmath1 estimates consistent with this limit . column ( 2 ) of tables 912 indicates the value of the local parameter @ xmath2 that contributes to the local modelof @ xmath1 and @ xmath62 . other experimental data suggest a value @ xmath2 ( e . g . , kennicutt , smith , & smith 1995 ; brown et al . 1995 ; van den bergh 1995 ; sandage et al . 1996 ; ruiz - lapuente 1996 ; riess , muller , & kirshner 1996 ; see also , schaefer 1996 ; wang et al . for the remainder of our discussion , we have the @ xmath142 value @ xmath143 ( 2 - @ xmath80 ##he , tanvir et al . 1995 ) ; in the range , the 2 - @ xmath80 value of @ xmath144 . the four additional values in section ( b ) of page 912 are those multi - value values which are values @ xmath2 consistent with this model . reduction of the standard - model value for the observed free energy spectrum to what is expected by reduction of the observed spectrum to known values due to effects on @ xmath63 . it has also been shown that @ xmath145he and @ xmat##h146li allows for the most efficient conversion from the actual observed values to the theoretical values ( e . g . , dar 1995 ; allen & allen 1996 ; allen et al . 1996 , see fkot ) . the allowed @ xmath145he and @ xmath146li ranges both exceed @ xmath147 , and a statistical analysis of the data yields a near - @ xmath80 ##he : @ xmath148 ( fkot ; also see copi et al . 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . the data of the theoretical maximum ( d ) abundance should , in theory , allow for a measurement of the allowed @ xmath63 range . there are currently a number of different estimates of the maximum d abundance , and since the theory is still in its infancy it is , therefore , not surprising that the different estimates are highly correlated . songaila et al . ( 1994 ) , carswell et al . ( 1994 ) , and rugers & allen ( 1996a , b ) used observations of the high - energy molecular structure to argue for a high @ d abundance and for a low @xmath63 . tytler , miller , & miller ( 1996 ) and miller & tytler ( 1996 ) study two absorption clouds and test for a high - d abundance and for a high @ xmath63 . carswell et al . ( 1996 ) and wampler et al . ( 1996 ) study two absorption clouds , but are not able to directly estimate @ xmath63 . since the dark lines separating @ xmath63 values from these # # ##s are very large , to use these assumptions to directly estimate the @ xmath63 values we want to use we assume that the values are known ( and where we take these values in order to estimate the 2 - @ xmath80 range ) . the large d abundance ##s is @ xmath149 with a 2 - @ xmath80 range : @ xmath150 ( rugers & miller 1996a ) . when these large d values are compared with the low @ xmath145he and @ xmath146li values , they suggest @ xmath151 , with a 2 - @ xmath##80 % : @ xmath152 ( fkot ) . the low d abundance is consistent with the local determination of the @ xmath145he and @ xmath146li ranges , and with the standard model of particle physics ( with three massless particle species ) ; they do , however , seem to require a modification of the thermal equilibrium equation to be consistent with local determination of the * and @ xmath153he ranges ( e . g . , fkot ; cardall & fuller 1996 ) . the high d abundance ##s compare @ xmath154 with the * - @ xmath80 range : @ xmath155 ( smith & tytler 1996 ) . the high d abundance ##s seem to be more easily obtained in terms of the standard model of particle physics , i . e . , they are easy to obtain with only three massless particle species ; but they do cause a slight , as yet unaccounted for , variation in the mean @ xmath145he abundance ( smith & tytler 1996 ; cardall & fuller 1996 ) . the low d abundance is also consistent with well - known particle species , but it isa variation of the standard galactic - mass model for @ xmath146li ( brown & tytler 1996 ; cardall & brown 1996 ) . to determine the variation of @ xmath63 parameters under study , we make the equations for @ xmath124 ( table 11 ) , 0 . 007 ( table 12 ) , 0 . 0125 ( table 13 ) , and 0 . 0205 ( table 14 ) . we shall note that this variation of @ xmath63 allows relaxation of robust constraints on model - predicted parameters . however , future advances in computing power should not lead to a relaxation of the constraints of @ xmath63 , and should allow for robust constraints on the predicted gas parameters . equation ( 1 ) of table 912 gives the cluster baryonic - mass fraction for the model we use here . the cluster baryonic - mass fraction is the fraction of the combined galactic - mass and gas - mass fraction . assuming that the brown et al . ( 1993 ) 2 - @ xmath80 values of the galactic mass , galactic , and gas parameters are equal and placing them in balance , we solve for the 2 - @xmath80 data of the cluster baryonic - mass fraction : @ xmath156 elbaz , arnaud , & bhringer ( 1995 ) , white & fabian ( 1995 ) , white , smith , & forman ( 1995 ) , markevitch et al . ( 1996 ) , and buote & canizares ( 1996 ) found similar ( but different ) gas - mass fraction . note that elbaz et al . ( 1995 ) and white & fabian ( 1995 ) found that the gas - mass fraction ##s are much smaller ; this non - gaussianity is ignored here . assuming that the cluster baryonic - mass fraction is an accurate estimate of the cluster baryonic - mass fraction , we can use e . ( 15 ) to calculate the model parameters . the parameter values in section ( 1 ) of tables 1 - 15 are those model - parameter values which yield a cluster baryonic - mass fraction consistent with the values of e . ( 15 ) . viana & liddle ( 1996 , in vl ) have reanalyzed the data : @ xmath58 data of smith & dodds ( 1994 ), and some of the larger scale systems where nonlinear effects may be much larger than they are . using an analytic approximation to the @ xmath58 , they found that the scale parameter ( fig . [ 16 ] ) takes the form of fig . ( 16 ) , and the numerical value of their scale parameters @ xmath157 should be increased by . we see this nonlinear effect below . ] @ xmath158 , with the notation - @ xmath80 ##0 , @ xmath159 this notation is consistent with larger scales than above . ( 16 ) this is the reason why llrv uses a smaller @ xmath1 for the single - phase gas model than the grsb . ] . it may be of interest to see whether the instability of @ xmath58 due to the instability of the anti - equilibrium model , in fig . 2 , can also affect the behavior of @ xmath157 , especially for the @ xmath119 systems . ( these effects are not well predicted by the analytic approximation to @ xmath58 . ) the data tables in section ( 1 ) of page 912 list those model - derived values which affect the scale parameter .consistent with the range of s . ( 17 ) . to determine the value of the linear model on @ xmath160 , @ xmath161 where @ xmath162 is the rms squared error for galaxy clusters , we compute the apm value ( maddox , efstathiou , & hansen 1996 ) of @ xmath163 = 1 . 5 $ ] , with 1 - @ xmath80 uncertainty : @ xmath164 where we then took the range due to the standard linear model and doubled to the mean motion in space with the original 1 - @ xmath80 range ( maddox et al . 1996 , p . [ 2 ] ) , and again to obtain the 1 - @ xmath80 range . the range of s . ( 17 ) is consistent with that derived from s . ( 7 . 72 ) and ( 7 . 73 ) of peebles ( 1993 ) . the [ ##ization of galaxy clusters , as a function of their x - ray intensity , is a further estimate of @ xmath113 $ ] . eke , hansen , & frenk ( 1996 , in press ) ( and ) .1 , wang ( 1996 ) . for the inflation model ( ) - @ xmath80 : @ xmath165 where we have shown that the regression parameters are linear , and that in general f depends weakly on the value of @ xmath157 ( and strongly on the values of @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 ) . fig . 2 of ref . in our regression , here we note this strong dependence between @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 . [ note that the value of q . ( 19 ) is exactly that required for compliance with the standard cluster correlation function . ] . the parameters of ##q . ( 19 ) are identical with , but more complex than , those of [ vl = 0 . 5 $ ] for the cdm , which is exactly the @ xmath1662 - @ xmath80 limit of f . ( as stated in ref , this is because vl corresponds to the cluster correlation function of 1 kev , where there is no change in the correlation function . ) this is the reason why llrv derived a lower value of @ xmath1 for the open - system inflation model than for gr##sb . ] . this is because it uses experimental data over a wide range of x - ray sources to solve @ xmath167 , and it uses many - step solutions of @ xmath168 fig . 2 and above to derive the born - schechter equation ( which is used for their determination of the constraints ) . however , it also makes use of hydrodynamical measurements of the number of individual clusters in the original cdm model ( @ xmath69 ) to determine the relation between the observed mass and the cluster size , and they use this same model for the constraints for the values of @ xmath1 . the initial conditions for determining the constraints are given by the exact solution to @ xmath58 , so that it may be of interest to determine whether the values of the constraints solved @ xmath58 could possibly affect the value of the constraints of interest . kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) used x - ray sources ##ing , and a model that allows for the assumption that clusters do not have mass at the temperature at which they are located , to help determine the values of @ xmat##h1 for cdm is similar to the dmr three - dimensional model . their results are in resonable agreement with what would be expected from the fig . ( 19 ) ( even assuming that the galaxies are at their time of formation ) . however , kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) note that changes from the time of formation to the time of formation may affect the results , so a more detailed comparison of these two data is needed . the corresponding ##s of fig ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) of ngc 912 are those non - negative values whose values are consistent with the results of fig . ( 19 ) ( 1 - @ xmath80 ) and of fig . ( 13 ) , with predictions based on : the new bbks corresponding to the wave function should make use of the more accurate parameterization of fig . ( 6 ) ( rather than that with @ xmath169 as the parameter ) , and this brings @ xmath26 $ ] to better than @ xmath87 in the observationally valid range of [ ##ization ( no use is made of the more valid value of @ xmath42 ) . ] .from small - scale peculiar velocity observation data zaroubi et al . ( 1996 ) calculated @ xmath26 = ( 0 . 1 \ - 1 . 1 ) \ math _ { { } ^ { - 1 . 1 } $ ] ( 2 - @ xmath80 ) . it should be noted that the large - scale peculiar velocity observation data here is highly correlated with ( more than ) the time - dependence constraint . since @ xmath170 is more sensitive to larger length scales ( compared to @ xmath26 $ ] ) , the constraints on @ xmath170 are more highly correlated with the string dependence constraint . however , since @ xmath170 is sensitive to smaller length scales , the time constraints on @ xmath170 are much less significant than the @ xmath171 ( 2 - @ xmath80 ) constraint of fig . ( 2 ) , and therefore we need not examine the time values of @ xmath170 directly . the constraints on the h - value obtained from large - scale peculiar velocity observations impose a constraint on the temperature dependence . kolatt & dekel ( 1995 ) looked at the 1 - @ xmath##80 = @ xmath172 where the 1 - @ xmath80 value also accounts for the uncertainty ( t . kolatt , private communication 1996 ) . since the assumptions associated with the constraint of fig . ( 19 ) are more restrictive than those associated with the constraint of fig . ( 23 ) , we do not give values for this value here . however , comparisons can be made to the corresponding low - order uncertainty value of fig . 23 , keeping in mind the @ xmath173 ( 1 - @ xmath80 ) value of fig . ( 19 ) ( the uncertainty is - 1 , t . kolatt , private communication 1996 ) , - @ xmath80 , 80 % , fig . ( 20 ) [ a reasonable upper bound for @ xmath174 , including the value @ xmath1 because of the @ xmath1 error . ] and the value of the dmr value ( as shown in fig . 23 ) . figures ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) of page 912 provide the dmr - based error estimates for @ xmath134 ( fig . [ 20 ] ) . fisher , r , &cole ( 1995 ) calculate the resolution of the position and velocity spectrum of the @ xmath133 3 . 0 jy , and compare @ xmath175 with the 2 - @ xmath80 e . p . estimate : @ xmath176 where we have used the horizontal resolution of fig . ( 5 . 1 ) of cole et al . ( 1995 ) to obtain the 2 - @ xmath80 range . cole et al . ( 1995 , table 2 ) compare the estimates of fig . ( 5 ) to the estimates of @ xmath134 , and for 2 - @ xmath80 the estimates of @ xmath134 are correct . it should be noted that the theoretical models of @ xmath134 ( fig . [ 18 ] ) and ngc 912 show that for @ xmath133 , @ xmath163 = [ / 2 . 0 $ ] is true , i . e . , they ignore the error in the rms - value of @ xmath133 velocity parameters , which is exactly of the order of that of fig . ( 5 ) . using the data from the model @ .##math134 tables , fig . ( 21 ) , while being nearly as accurate as those from the large - scale structure models , we do not address this issue in our discussion below . the blank entries in columns ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) of tables 912 indicate those model - parameter spaces whose values are consistent with the values of fig . ( 21 ) . the blank entries in tables 912 indicate the theoretical constraints imposed by the experimental constraints discussed in the previous section on the model - parameter space for the open - bubble inflation model ( those of type [ 1 ] above ) , and for the scale - and scale - free - structure model ( type [ 2 ] above ) . the exact experimental constraints on the values are not known , but this is probably a result of the constraints on the values themselves since the model parameters are very small . in the following discussion of the current choice of model - parameter space we focus on the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ) . note from table 9 that the large - scale structure models of the open - bubble inflation model do not depend on spectra observed in the second phase of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) , and therefore do not dependbased on the data from the non - square - integrable data set ( yst ) . table 9 refers to the choice of the " with probability " large - scale variation in particle physics . this is done by picking a high @ xmath123 gyr ( and a low @ xmath2 ) , and by picking a low @ xmath124 ( this is the predicted 2 - @ xmath80 value from the data and the abundance @ xmath145he , @ xmath146li , and k - t , fkot ) . the energy constraints for the matter - based system come from the full - scale experimental energy constraints on the energy of @ xmath157 ( table 9 , fig . [ 1 ] ) , and from the observed x - ray wave ##front experimental value of [ @ xmath26 $ ] ( cf . , that for @ xmath177 the predicted [ 2 - @ xmath80 value of @ xmath113 = 0 . 74 $ ] , the equation states that for 2 - @ xmath80 the experimental data requires that this is at least 0 . 74 , and that @xmath177 also fails this test . the predictions on @ xmath134 ( col . [ 3 ] ) are not as strong as those on @ xmath113 $ ] . for these cases of @ xmath62 and @ xmath178 the observed baryonic - mass fraction at @ xmath177 is required to be 0 . 033 ( col . [ 3 ] ) , while for non - @ xmath80 smith et al . ( 1993 ) require that this be at least 0 . 039 ( at @ xmath179 ) , so that this @ xmath177 case also fails this test . given the available data , it may be necessary to make some adjustments to the - parameter values so that the @ xmath180 model with @ xmath181 gyr and @ xmath182 is more consistent with the available data . however , it is clear that the experimental data does not support an alternative model with @ xmath183 the [ at @ xmath184 $ ] favors a larger @ xmath1 and the observed - baryonic - mass fraction favors a smaller @xmath1 , and 2 are in question . figure 1 shows the values for the @ xmath121 gyr , @ xmath185 ##he . this value of @ xmath63 is consistent with the 2 - @ xmath80 range determined from experimental conditions and the observed @ xmath145he and @ xmath146li ratios : @ xmath148 ( fkot , also in copi et al . 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . it is , however , very difficult to compare @ xmath8 with the 2 - @ xmath80 range determined from the observed @ xmath145he , @ xmath146li , and the low d abundance @ xmath152 ( fkot ) , and with that from the previously observed low d abundance @ xmath186 ( smith & tytler 1996 ) . in any case , the low d ratios are still under investigation , and should be regarded as theoretical . in this regard , gas - phase gas models with @ xmath187 are consistent with the experimental data . the current experimental density data set for @ xmath157and @ xmath134 favour @ xmath74 , and that for the [ baryonic - mass density ] @ xmath188 , and that for @ xmath130 $ ] favour @ xmath189 , but in this case the difference between theoretical and experimental results is very small ( although the tanvir et al . 1995 predicted @ xmath2 values favour @ xmath190 ) . note that in this case models with @ xmath191 are highly consistent with the predictions . table 1 shows the values for @ xmath192 gyr , @ xmath193 ge . this baryonic - mass density value is consistent with that derived from the predicted 3 - d values , but is difficult to reconcile with the current theoretical experimental values of the predicted @ xmath145he and @ xmath146li values ( cardall & smith 1996 ) . the larger value of @ xmath63 ( and smaller value of @ xmath2 ) has also reduced large - scale fluctuations in the density very significantly , opening up the predicted @ xmath1 values to larger fluctuations . models with @ xmat##h194 is consistent with the observed data , although the high @ xmath1 value of the result is likely to conflict with what is known from the single - cluster mass fraction , and the results also show a very high @ xmath2 ( but not necessarily high ) at the 2 - @ xmath80 significance level ( the tanvir et al . 1995 , @ xmath2 value requires @ xmath100 , at 2 - @ xmath80 the @ xmath2 significance level requires @ xmath195 ) . the corresponding mean values for @ xmath157 , the [ baryonic - mass fraction , @ xmath26 $ ] , and @ xmath134 require @ xmath97 , but the consistency with observed data is very good , and could easily be improved by adding @ xmath62 one bit to just @ xmath2 . figure 1 shows the values for the region of two - particle decay . here we have @ xmath122 value ( requires @ xmath121 gyr ) , but with the mean value of @ xmath63 missing from the range ( the mean@ xmath145he , @ xmath146li , and @ # ##ft ( fkot ) . the larger size of @ xmath63 ( according to figure 1 ) decreases the cluster baryonic - mass fraction constraint , which still requires only @ xmath196 . the increase of @ xmath63 also increases the mass loss factor , making it more difficult to test for @ xmath177 ; however , models with @ xmath197 seem to be consistent with the observed data when @ xmath4 and @ xmath198 gyr . it is clear that in this case the best gas model that we have for @ xmath157 , for @ xmath26 $ ] , and for @ xmath134 is @ xmath9 ; however , that for the cluster baryonic - mass fraction ( as well as that for @ xmath2 ) prefer @ xmath190 ( although for non - @ xmath80 the cluster baryonic - mass fraction constraint still requires @ xmath196 ) . thus , the @ xmath199 gas - phase gas models with @xmath200 and @ xmath198 gyr are reasonably consistent with the observation data , in this case the difference between observations and estimates is not significant . note that in this case estimates with @ xmath201 are reasonably compatible with the observation data . in contrast , open - bubble inflation models based on the cdm ##r ( rp94 ; bgt ; yst ) are reasonably consistent with the observation data for @ xmath202 . the on - line time - frequency - space model ( w83 ) is also reasonably consistent with the observation data for a wide range of @ xmath1 . the increase in the size of @ xmath63 is one of the main reasons why such a large increase in @ xmath1 is consistent with the observation data . our detailed analysis of the dmr two - dimensional model led us to conclude that only those open - bubble inflation models at the upper end of the observed range ( @ xmath203 ) are consistent with the number of observations ( grsb ) . the increase in the required time to estimate @ xmath1 and @ xmath204 can be attributed to the number of observed observations . however , thesenote : ( 1 ) the slight slight shift from the horizontal axis of the dmr two - year data set to the two - year data ( g96 ) ; ( 2 ) use of the extended 2 - @ xmath80 range of values allowed by the dmr earlier analysis ( instead of the 1 - @ xmath80 range allowed by the full - scale quadrupole - based dmr two - year data set described here ) ; ( 3 ) use of the 2 - @ xmath80 range of the large - scale parameter values of @ xmath1 instead of the 1 - @ xmath80 range used in our earlier analysis ; ( 4 ) we consider a range of @ xmath63 values here ( in grsb we focus on @ xmath8 ) ; and ( 5 ) we consider a range of @ xmath62 values here ( in grsb we focus on @ xmath121 gyr ) . we note , however , that the filling of the range with @ xmath205 is only possible if @ xmath63 is large ( @ xmath206 ) , @ xmath2 is small @ xmat##h207 ) , and the large - scale model parameters of @ xmath1 turn out to be generally very robust . the experimental data we have used to build multi - model models in the previous section are the most robust data available . in addition , there are many other experimental data which we do not consider to be very robust , and the conclusions drawn from these should be taken with great care . in this section we consider some of the most important results from our recent work . in our analysis of the dmr two - year data shown above , we select the parameters for the rms ##e of the mean wind , according to results from the analysis of the data ( bertschinger et al . we did not do this ) , since , given the data , the conclusions drawn in grsb are not very different . in particular , choice of the model parameters means that we should treat the above 1 - @ xmath80 upper limits , as 2 - @ xmath80 upper limits for the two - year data . in grsb we use @ xmath134 , @ nusser & miller ( 1994 ) , @ xmath208 ( 2 - @ xmath80 ) , to determine##strain the full range of values to @ xmath209 . if we consider the cole et al . ( 1995 ) result , @ xmath210 ( 2 - @ xmath80 ) , which , for the case of dimension 2 , is @ xmath211 . this value is only slightly below the lower limit ( @ xmath212 ) derived from the bertschinger et al . ( 1990 ) result in grsb . we must conclude that the large - scale flow results of bertschinger et al . ( 1990 ) favour a [ 2 - @ xmath80 value of @ xmath1 that is not @ xmath213 greater than that indicated by the phase - space parameter ##s of cole et al . ( 1995 ) . $ ] . ] we also must conclude that the lower limit of the large - scale flow results of bertschinger et al . ( 1990 ) would favour a much higher value of @ xmath1 than the rest of the data we have presented here . however , as stated in detail in grsb , there is considerable uncertainty about how to best estimate large - scale flow variations from the available data , especially given the high statistical uncertainty associated with the distribution of thesee peculiar velocity ( wilson 1996 , also called llrv ) . a more detailed analysis , as well as more detailed calculations , are therefore needed before it will be possible to confidently conclude that the large - scale velocity data do not allow us to assume any higher values of @ xmath1 than are assumed by the rest of the observed data ( and thus rule out the models described above ) . it may be noted that by comparing the spectral mass spectrum determined from a given set of peculiar velocity data to the spectral mass spectrum determined from the apm data , kolatt & dekel ( 1995 ) found that for the pre - 1995 apm , @ xmath214 with no correction - @ xmath80 ##0 , @ xmath215 ( note that it has been shown that these errors prevent a correct estimate of @ xmath134 from the comparison of the observed large - scale peculiar velocity data to the @ xmath133 2 . 5 jy spectral mass , wilson , nusser , & willick 1996 . ) this estimate is consistent with the models currently under consideration . the stromlo - apm comparison of loveday et al . ( 1996 ) to @ xmat##h216 , with a 2 - @ xmath80 upper limit of 0 . 5 , while baugh ( 1996 ) calculated that @ xmath217 ( 2 - @ xmath80 ) , and ratcliffe et al . ( 1996 ) , for @ xmath218 . using the apm [ for @ xmath163 $ ] , ( 22 ) , the kolatt & dekel ( 1995 ) estimate of @ xmath219 , fig . ( 19 ) , can be converted to an estimate of @ xmath167 , and to 2 - @ xmath80 , @ xmath220 it is clear that for @ xmath69 the lower limit of this value is consistent with that calculated from the solar x - ray wave ##front model , fig . ( 19 ) , although the model @ xmath1 fig . ( 20 ) has a lower value than in fig . ( 19 ) because of the lower limit to 1 @ xmath1 . zaroubi et al . ( 1996 ) further refined model - derived values by comparing large - scale decay rate to that determined by the dmr 10 - year - long post - solar .12 . they conclude that the open - bubble inflation model provides a good description of the large - scale flow . if , at 2 - @ xmath80 , @ xmath221 from above , we conclude that the open - bubble inflation model with @ xmath222 and @ xmath223 provides a good description to all the observed data considered in @ xmath224 . for @ xmath223 zaroubi et al . ( 1996 ) conclude that at 2 - @ xmath80 @ xmath225 ( fig . [ 2 ] ) , is below our value of @ xmath222 . since the zaroubi et al . ( 1996 ) model does not account for the uncertainty in the dmr model ( cf . kolatt , 1995 , 1996 ) , it is still unclear if the data from the large - scale flow model are in agreement with those derived from the observed data considered in ( and therefore balance out the open - bubble inflation model ) . it should also be noted that at much shorter time scales there is evidence for a higher value of @ xmath1 from small - scale flow related observations ( shaya , peebles , & smith 1995 ) .the cluster peculiar velocity model is an alternative method for describing the peculiar velocity distribution ( e . g . , wang & efstathiou 1994 ; moscardini et al . 1995 ; bahcall & oh 1996 ) . bahcall & oh ( 1996 ) note that the experimental data are well - represented by the @ xmath177 [ - @ xmath18 ##7 with @ xmath226 and @ xmath227 = 1 . 5 $ ] . this range is much larger than that represented by the dmr model ( e . g . , ratra & sugiyama 1995 ) . although bahcall & oh ( 1996 ) do not compare the cluster peculiar velocity data directly to the data of the open - bubble inflation model , their results suggest that this model is consistent with the open - bubble inflation model . for the values of @ xmath1 predicted from the experimental data we found [ @ xmath228 and the @ xmath26 $ ] section for the inflation model in rfc 912 . bahcall & oh ( 1996 ) also note that it is difficult , if not impossible , to compare the cluster peculiar velocity data with what is observed in probability distribution models of fidu##cial cdm and mdm . [ at @ xmath113 $ ] , low - density stars exhibit masses less than high density stars . numerical simulations of galaxies at high density can be used to estimate the galaxy density . as well , we note that , from the results of the numerical simulations of cen & ostriker ( 1993 ) , [ an open model with @ xmath229 = 1 . 5 $ ] star formation occurs at high density @ xmath230 when @ xmath231 and at @ xmath232 when @ xmath72 . thus the open - model open model is not in conflict with the fact that the observed stellar mass distribution at @ xmath233 is similar to that of the sun ( e . g . , lilly et al . 1995 ; glazebrook et al . 1995 ; and johnson et al . 1996 ) , nor is it in conflict with experimental evidence for massive debris disks at @ xmath233 ( vogt et al . these models may not include experimental evidence of massive star - forming disks at @ xmath234 ( cowie , hu , & songaila 1995) , as well as the observed variation at @ xmath235 in the number of stars as a function of ( small ) variations " in the " light curve ( taylor & hartwick 1996 ) , and it is not surprising that systems like the @ xmath236 protogalaxy " system ( yee et al . 1996 ; ellingson et al . 1996 ) can be found under these conditions . it is , however , at present unknown whether the open - bubble inflation model can produce a large population of young star - forming galaxies at @ xmath237 ( steidel et al . 1996 ; giavalisco , steidel , & macchetto 1996 ) , and if there are " large populations of strongly interacting lyman @ xmath238 galaxies like the one at @ xmath239 ( e . g . , taylor et al . 1996 ; wampler et al . 1996 ; fontana et al . 1996 ) , then , depending on the model , these may pose a significant challenge for the open - bubble inflation model . on the other hand , the recent discovery of galaxy clusters at @ xmath240 ( e . g . , francis etal . 1996 ; pascarelle et al . 1996 ) they do not present a significant challenge for the open - bubble inflation model , since simple models like @ xmath241 ( e . g . , luppino & gioia 1995 ; pell et al . 1996 ) can easily be incorporated into the model . it should be noted that for the @ xmath69 models designed to fit the very large - scale constraints , e . g . , binary cdm ( with a constant consistent with that from the dmr ) , binary mdm , or binary cdm ( without a similar constant ) , it is often difficult , if not impossible , to find the first direct evidence of early galaxy formation ( e . g . , miller & bertschinger 1994 ; ostriker & cen 1996 ) . with the recent advances in computational science , new model tests show great promise for understanding the galaxy structure . it should be noted that the results from these tests are consistent with that part of the open - bubble inflation model in question that is covered by the large - scale model above . these tests include the @ xmath142 - based mass distribution test ( miller et al. 1996 ) , an early version of the first high - resolution test of type ii galaxies ( perlmutter et al . 1996 ) , as well as measurements of the effects of gravitational lensing of galaxies in other galaxies ( e . g . , torres & waga 1996 ; kochanek 1996 ) . it should be noted that these results are generally consistent with @ xmath69 models , and not with the two - parameter " z " - time - invariant models ( e . g . , ratra & quillen 1992 ; torres & waga 1996 ) , but they do put emphasis on the 1 - @ xmath18 cdm model . large - scale experimental spatial distance measurements will also greatly extend the available range of two - parameter models . fig . 1 compares the 1 - @ xmath80 range of available spatial distance measurements for a more general open - bubble inflation ( as well as free - space time - invariant , respectively ) models to available available spatial distance measurement data . from a direct comparison of the range of dmr billion - year - old open - bubble inflation models to available spatial distance##isotropy observation data , ratra et al . ( 1995 ) found that the range of parameter space for the open - bubble inflation model that was favoured by the above observation data was not consistent with the smaller - scale observed observation data . this finding was confirmed by grs , which also used open - bubble inflation models estimated to the @ xmath1351 - @ xmath80 range of the dmr four - year data ( and indeed , open - bubble inflation models estimated at least to the dmr four - year data set , see fig . 5 and 6 of grs ) . grs found that ( given the uncertainty associated with the smaller - scale data ) the 0 - @ xmath80 variation in the range of the dmr data allowed confirmation of the dependence on model - parameter space , although the range of model - parameter space for the open - bubble inflation model used in the discussion above was found to be consistent with the smaller - scale observed - observation , and @ xmath93 open - bubble inflation models were also favoured by the smaller - scale observed - observation data ( grs , ). . and . ) . is allowed , but only at 1 - @ xmath80 @ xmath242 is . this size limit is consistent with the observation of grs that it is not always possible to accurately estimate single - parameter values from the 1994 - data set . note however that yang et al . ( 1996b ) does not mention the effect of the size comparison between the two dmr data sets , and instead includes a number of data points , e . g . , the two msam points and the max3 mup data ( which is consistent with the earlier max5 mup data , lim et al . 1996 ) , which does not allow a maximum value of @ xmath1 for the open - bubble inflation model ( ratra et al . 1995 ; grs ) . ] a further analysis of the ucsb south africa 1994 - data data ( gundersen et al . 1995 ) and ganga et al . ( 1996a ) reached a similar conclusion : at 1 - @ xmath80 ( with a positive - normal distribution ) the data matches open - bubble inflation models with @ xmath243 , while 0 .- @ xmath80 the ucsb south ##point 1994 model is consistent with the predictions of the open - model , 1 - @ xmath18 , and the cdm ##r ##2 . we have compared the dmr 5 and 55 ##7 sky maps to a number of open - model sub - models in order to test the predictions of these open - models . our model accurately describes the large differences in the observed extinction amplitude due to : ( 1 ) the small differences between the earth - and solar - mass sky maps ; ( 2 ) the inclusion or exclusion of the @ xmath85 uncertainty in the data ; and , ( 3 ) the observed low - temperature stellar spectral lines . we have defined a maximal 0 - @ xmath80 uncertainty range based on the extremal variation of the extinction amplitude , and a maximal 1 - @ xmath80 uncertainty range can be defined in a similar way . for this maximal 0 - @ xmath80 @ xmath21 , the maximal 1 - @ xmath80 is , at least @ xmath10 and @ xmath2 ( ) based on the observed maximum aniso##tropy angular spectrum and model - parameter uncertainty ) , and the @ xmath244 and @ xmath245 ( statistical and experimental ) values of . ( figure 1 , also in bunn , liddle , & brown 1996 ) , @ xmath246 , is greater than the dmr 1 - to - 1 - @ xmath80 values found in , e . g . , g96 , brown et al . ( 1996 ) , and others . this is because we can estimate the magnitude of the observed systematic differences for the entire # ##w - range , and account for them , in the most conservative way possible , with systematic adjustments . ( in particular : we do not explicitly account for the small systematic differences in the equatorial - and polar - latitude maps ; we do not assume that any of the small systematic differences correspond to model - parameter error changes in the corresponding @ xmath21 maps ; and we do not model the systematic differences in accordance with the observed uncertainty . ) since our estimate of the uncertainty is the most conservative possible , our assumptions about co - uncertainty are the most important [ . ] . ( compare this to the @ xmath24##7 , 1 - @ xmath80 , as of 2014 . [ 2 ] . ) since most of this uncertainty is due to the large systematic changes , the maximal 1 - @ xmath80 maximal uncertainty is more than twice the maximal 1 - @ xmath80 maximal uncertainty . for the small maximal 1 - @ xmath80 @ xmath21 , as above , the maximal uncertainty lies between @ xmath248 and @ xmath249 . note that this accounts for the uncertainty , the uncertainty , and the ( 1 ) ( 2 ) effects . the systematic changes , e . g . , the intrinsic uncertainty ( kogut et al . 1996b ) , and the beamwidth uncertainty ( smith et al . 1994 ) , are much smaller than the uncertainty we have accounted for above . it has also been shown that there is a non - linear component to the dmr data obtained from the deep sky survey ( banday et al . 1996b ) . by constructing the dmr data from the combined measurements of same @ xmath1 , same @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 , we can more preciselyand the small shifts in the standard correlation coefficients due to fluctuations in @ xmath2 and @ xmath10 . although these shifts may depend on the values of @ xmath1 and the standard normal power law , among the other variables , it is best to consider these small shifts when considering the variables discussed in this article . we have described the open - bubble inflation scenario , accounting only for the fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) , including the contribution of the fluctuations generated during the first phase of square - wave inflation ( bgt ; yst ) , and not only for the fluctuations from the non - square - integrable transfer function ( yst ) . for observationally observed open - bubble inflation , the observed fluctuations do not depend solely on the other two types of fluctuations . the theoretical predictions of the open - bubble inflation scenario appear to be robust and suggest that only those fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble need to be accounted for . as stated in the article , a number of more robust predictions of the open - bubble inflation scenario have also come under scrutiny . these are based on theoretical assumptions about the observed fluctuations due to open - bubblenucleation . in these various models of the open - bubble inflation , there are a number of additional mechanisms for high - order # ##s ( in addition to those in the models discussed here ) , including those that result from changes in the bubble size , as well as those associated with the nucleation of a nonzero open bubble . while these results suggest that these effects probably do not make a significant contribution to the changes observed during the time inside the bubble , it is important to continue to explore these theories and to more fully understand the validity of the open - bubble inflation model itself , as well as to attempt to find a suitable simulation - based realization of the open - bubble inflation model . as has been already noted for the low - order model ( g96 ) , the currently available dmr data can lead to slightly different @ xmath21 parameter estimates , but still within the expected range . this uncertainty level is much larger if the analysis results from simply either excluding or including the quadrupole effect . the dmr data alone can then be used to compare @ xmath1 and compare @ xmath14 in a statistically significant fashion for the various models discussed here . itis , therefore , reasonable to assume that when the quadrupole effect is excluded from the data , the @ xmath9 - sample - based analysis is still consistent with the dmr data , but the quadrupole - excluded analysis favors @ xmath12 ( for the open - bubble inflation model in the sample @ xmath250 ) . the cosmographic analysis , in accordance with the small - scale structure estimates according to the parameters of the dmr - derived open - bubble inflation model given here , favors @ xmath202 . the maximum observed value is also a measure of the relative value of @ xmath10 . this value is consistent with the value previously obtained ( @ xmath9 ) in the quadrupole - excluded analysis of the dmr data here . it may also be argued that the uncertainty is caused both by the need to reconcile these new values of @ xmath1 with what was obtained from small - scale structure estimates , as well as to reconcile the [ dmr - derived @ xmath251 $ ] value ( for this relative value of @ xmath1 ) with the previously observed sample size values ( e . g ., etc . [ 2 ] ) . in conjunction with the high - density open - @ xmath18 cdm model , we have shown that in the high - density open - @ cdm model we can adjust the values of @ xmath1 to fit a wide range of observed experimental data . for a large number of these models , with their particle - mass - energy estimates , this focuses primarily on values of @ xmath1 that are larger than the range of values for @ xmath10 derived from the observed many - body data in accordance with quantum field theory . whether this @ cdm is nonbaryonic , or is simply baryonic matter that does not take part in stellar evolution , is a particularly significant challenge for these models . we welcome the contributions of those contributing to the @ xmath0 - dmr . @ xmath0 is supported by the office of planetary science of nasa houston . we also welcome the efforts and support of j . baugh , j . smith , j . garriga , j . kolatt , j . smith , j . piccirillo , j . rocha ,j . lee , k . lee , and s . lee . this was funded in part by the pparc grant and kbn is 2p30401607 . 1 . the coefficients , @ xmath253 , from the spectra and the multipole coefficients @ xmath56 , from the corresponding global correlation coefficients ( and found to be in @ xmath254 ) . dark type is for the open - bubble inflation model , accounting only for fluctuations that are generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( type [ 2 ] , above ) , and bright type is for the open - bubble inflation model , above , accounting for fluctuations generated during the last phase of inflation ( type [ 2 ] spectra ) . solid lines are for @ xmath255 and dashed lines are for @ xmath256 . these stand for @ xmath64 and @ xmath65 . note that @ xmath257 . 1 .

( 1995 ) , the @ xmath302 ( y ) error bars also account for the measurement error ( albeit in an indirect manner , except for the sp94 experiment and the data from ganga et al . 1996a see ganga et al . 1996a for a discussion of this issue ) . the observed data points are placed at the @ xmath66 - values at which the energy transfer function is most accurate ( this reflects the fact that the sensitivity of the experiment is highly dependent on the absolute value of the k - axis ) , and thus gives a somewhat misleading representation of the multipoles to which the experiment leads ( see ganga et al . 1996a for a discussion of this issue ) . for the dmr values of @ xmath303 , the vertical lines of the observed data points represent the @ xmath66 - value values of thethe distribution function ( or , the variance of the frequency - based model ) . note that from the analysis of a small portion of the data ( corresponding to estimates of the variance ) shown in these figures , grs ( fig . 5 and 6 ) shows that all the models shown in figure ( 5 ) , including the original cdm model , are consistent with the # ##m model .
