recently a new method for analyzing multifractal functions @ xmath1 was developed @ xcite . it exploits the fact that the second derivative of the @ xmath2 ( denoted here as @ xmath3 ) of @ xmath1 is , for a given value of @ xmath2 , a power - law tail of the scaling . @ xmath4 the solution @ xmath5 is the exact solution of the equation @ xmath6 where @ xmath7 is the first derivative corresponding to the derivative for all values @ xmath8 of the structure function of order @ xmath9 , i . e . @ xmath10 . it was also shown that the local observability of the power - law tail when multifractality is applied to a given set of values is determined by how much @ xmath7 suffers from its dependence on @ xmath9 . the greater this , the easier it is to analyze multifractality . so far the method of the power - law tail has been applied mainly for large structure functions , in particular the # ##ization of @ xcite for which kesten - type functions @ xcite and @probability distributions can be generalized . it is our aim here to apply the partial derivative method for invariant measures of dissipative periodic functions , in particular for the feigenbaum invariant , which is at the end ##point of the orbit - space where the orbit has boundary @ xmath11 @ xcite . the multifractality method introduced , in mr . @ xcite , a similar method . for the feigenbaum invariant the scaling factors can be determined with high precision . there is an important difference in the way one uses integral and differential measures to determine their multifractal values and in determining the distribution of distributions , by using @ xmath12 for measures @ xcite and @ xmath0 for measures @ xcite . for a measure @ xmath1 one uses the pdf of the pdfs of the function @ xmath13 to determine the distribution function , whereas for an invariant measure @ xmath14 one starts with distributions of functions or functions of different dimensions . in the finite - dimensional case the two methods are combined by using the cumulative distribution function @ xmath15 . we shall apply the partial derivative method to the case of theinvariant measure . the rest of the section is the same . section [ ss : thermo ] is devoted to the underlying theory for the feigenbaum distribution . in section [ ss : dynamics ] , we describe the methods used in vs . @ xcite . in section [ ss : statistics ] we describe how this method , focused on the study of the statistical properties of the distribution , is closely related to the underlying multifractal method which focusses on the statistical properties of the invariant measure @ xcite . to the best of our knowledge the close connection between the two methods is shown here for the first time . finally , in section [ ss : numericalfreeenergy ] we solve for the free distribution and calculate the scale factor @ xmath7 for the value of the invariant measure ; this is done using a very simple wave - function - based method . partial derivatives are discussed in section [ s : fraclap ] . in section [ s : fraclap _ pheno ] we also describe the use of power - law methods for the calculation of partial derivatives and the work on observability . the partial derivative version of the feigenbaumthis is given in section [ s : fraclap _ numerics ] . further details are given in section [ s : concl ] . in this section we give a detailed description of the mathematical basis for the probability distribution of the feigenbaum function ( see ref . @ xcite for the more details ) and show how we can use it in order to understand the multifractal nature of the hlder ##s . @ feigenbaum , we give the definition of the n - dimensional space @ xmath16 \ to [ 0 , 1 ] $ ] , where @ xmath17 is the solution of the feigenbaum cvitanovi integral equation : @ xmath18 \ ( [ 0 ] ) is said to be the unique solution in the category of continuous continuous maps ( that is , maps around a fixed point ) with a non - singular solution . this solution is called the feigenbaum coupling . it is holomorphic in a small neighborhood of @ xmath19 $ ] and the first two terms of the taylor series expansion are @ xcite @ xmath20 the value of the coupling is @ xmath21 which is the value ofthe feigenbaum measure of @ xmath22 is also equivalent to @ xmath23 . the interval @ xmath24 for the interval @ xmath25 can be defined in the following way . for example @ xmath26 is a sequence of intervals of @ xmath27th level : @ xmath28 , \ nonumber \ \ & & \ delta ^ { ( n ) } _ i = 0 ^ { ( n ) } ( \ delta ^ { ( n ) } _ i ) \ equiv \ underbrace { { \ circ { \ circ \ cdots \ circ } } _ { 1 } ( \ delta _ 0 ^ { ( n ) } ) \ left ( 1 \ leq 1 \ leq 1 ^ { - 1 ) . \ dot { g } \ dot { 1 } \ ] ] the following properties of the interval @ xmath29 are the result of the above definition ( [ 1 ] ) : ( a ) @ @ xmath30 is pairwise independent .

( 3 ) @ xmath35 , where @ xmath36 is the size of the interval . the first three levels of the intervals are shown in fig . [ 2 : dynamicalpartition ] . the feigenbaum cvitanovi map @ xmath17 and the first three levels of the intervals @ xmath37 . for @ xmath17 we define the map ( [ g1 ] ) , shown in fig . @ xcite , to @ xmath38 . ] ] . symbolic coding the examples below show that it is possible to define a symbolic code for the intervals @ xmath29 . , @ xmath39 , where @ xmath40 . then we can define the sequence @ xmath41 as a symbolic code for : @ xmath29 : @ xmath42 . then we can define the feigenbaum map @ xmath43 the sequence @ xmath24 is equivalent to the set of all possible binary sequences @ xmath44 . these sequences can be represented as a symbolic coding operation : @ xmath24 . .this is the property the interval @ xmath25 has as the canonical map of the interval @ xmath45 . note that : @ xmath24 is a cantor set . it is easy to see that @ xmath24 is not an interval for all but countably many initial points @ xmath46 $ ] : @ xmath47 : @ xmath48 . the cantor set of initial points consists of the following periodic intervals and their preimages . as we have seen above , the intervals @ xmath29 have an increasing size and the size varies from @ xmath49 to @ xmath50 . note that and @ xmath51 are the possible sizes of the cantor set @ xmath24 . the first step which is necessary for the multifractal problem is the control of the number of interval sizes according to size , i . e . @ xmath51 . this control can be achieved with the help of the above models . the mathematical model which was introduced in 2002 . @ xcite is based on the gibbsian formula for the size of the interval @ xmat##h29 . it is stated in ref . @ xcite that there is a function @ xmath52 ( identity function ) which is defined for all infinite infinite sequences such that : . . there is a function @ xmath53 for which @ xmath54 \ , . for any two infinite sequences @ xmath55 which exist , the function @ xmath56 combines @ xmath57 with @ xmath58 @ xmath59 \ leq \ frac { | \ delta ^ { ( n ) } _ { \ epsilon _ 0 , \ dots , \ epsilon _ { n -

[ ref : feigen - zetap ] ( a ) . the values @ xmath7 are then determined by a least squares fit of the structure functions in the [ @ xmath220 . with this set of measurements , the value of thethis seems to gradually improve since @ xmath221 , but still there is very little difference between the two methods of calculating @ xmath7 . note that the ` ` @ xmath222 - 1 ' ' of the integral of @ xmath7 , called @ xmath223 , which is the codimension of the integral of the corresponding measure @ xmath224 , is zero and its absolute value is just the same for @ xcite . this will be explained in the section . in this section we will discuss the phenomenological approach to multifractality via partial derivatives @ xcite and extend it to the multifractal approach . we will start , not with the measure @ xmath224 itself , but with the measure @ xmath1 . the functions @ xmath22 can be written as the hlder ##s of @ xmath1 , i . e . , @ xmath225 for @ xmath226 . we proceed to partial derivatives of the @ xmath2 and , as in fig . @ xcite , consider the function on the hilbert space of @ xmath227 .@ xmath228 ( see ref . @ xcite for more details ) . an isolated non - zero function with norm @ xmath22 at a point @ xmath90 if @ xmath229 if @ xmath230 , then we shall have since , the norm is finite , the partial derivative must be sufficiently large and this leads to the dead - end of the function . a key result of the proof is that this definition can be generalized even to non - compact multifractal spaces , if we take other types of measures into consideration . for the feigenbaum probability measure , we define the hausdorff measure @ xmath120 of the set of points of a function with norm @ xmath22 . assuming that we can also define @ xmath120 as a probability measure , we can define the function to be a function of norm @ xmath22 as the partial derivative of norm @ xmath2 which is ( maximum absolute value ) the maximum absolute value @ xmath231 , that is we define @ xmath232 in terms of the codimens##ion of the order @ xmath233 , the sequence to obtain ( [ e : alpha - 1 ] ) is written as @ xmath234 where @ xmath235 is the same sequence ( @ xmath236 ) . taking also into account the sequence with all the terms @ xmath22 , the value of the fourier coefficient of the second order of the @ xmath2 is given , to the second order , by the following power law @ xmath237 an elementary calculation shows that @ xmath156 corresponding to the infimum of ( [ e : inf ] ) implies @ xmath238 which also implies @ xmath239 . on the other hand , we get that @ xmath240 where the infimum is given by and @ xmath22 is the exact same as @ xmath239 . similarly , @ xmath241 = ( [ alpha _ 1 ] ) , we get @ xmath242 where the same result follows from @ xmath239 . the simple consequence of this result is that the ( positive ) sign of the power - law is for the first##al ##bedo of slope @ xmath2 is the @ xmath9 - value of the intersection of the graph of @ xmath7 and of the straight line of slope @ xmath2 through the intersection . as shown in ref . @ xcite , in the limit of the infinite number of values , the power - law product ( [ x : cprob ] ) holds only if the multifractality is sufficiently strong . this property is measured by the multifractality of @ xmath243 , a measure of how much the data differs from a very small ( which would be @ xmath244 ) : @ xmath245 where @ xmath246 . it was shown that observability of the power - law gives a sufficiently strong value for the curve @ xmath247 , where @ xmath56 is the number of points at which the curve exhibits multifractal tails . in addition it was shown in ref . @ xcite that @ xmath248 for large , well - defined radial velocity , @ xcite gave the @ xmath249 values of the graph of @ xmath250 , thus presenting a strong value .of first order , for observability of power - law functions . as we shall see , the problem is much more complicated for the feigenbaum - map . before turning to regression analysis , we focus on an issue raised by an earlier author who wrote about the nonlocal ##ity of the second derivative and say in general that our analysis makes sense , generally speaking , except for ( non ) translationally invariant . ##ert # : however , if the system consists of components whose ` ` statistical properties ' ' are very different the difference will be smeared out . our opinion on these problems is generally as follows . first we will show that , of course , the distribution for the feigenbaum function is initially linear ( translation - invariant ) but by integration in it becomes less linear ; the second derivative is not a local function and the distribution of the pdf is assumed to be dominated by the correlated components . second , a more general question . the method of the multi - scale method is based on the fact that the dynamics of the system determines a set of scales . it is assumed that these scales do not depend on a single point in the sample space . on the contrary , they are independent and ` ` compatible ' ' with each other. . in the case of the feigenbaum distribution the scales depend on a particular partition of the system of equations . in some cases , like turbulent flows , the scales are difficult to compute precisely . however , the distribution with respect to the scale parameter is always known and provides a basis for much of the multifractal analysis . the phenomenological results given in the previous section suggest that we should consider power - law tails in the normal distribution for the order of @ xmath1 for small values @ xmath2 . analysis of . . [ 2 : feigen - zetap ] suggests that @ xmath2 should lie between the minimum slope of the function and 0 . the distribution @ xmath251 is of obviously not a finite order and , as we shall note , it is associated with a power - law tail of order of . . . ( integrating @ xmath252 into the distribution of @ xmath253 , we get @ xmath254 . ) ] the maximum scale can be easily calculated . however , @ xmath80 has large values when @ xmath66 is large enough . in this case the optimal solution to @ x##math80comes from the shortest path of the graph with the length of the graph of @ xmath50 . therefore , @ xmath255 has the value @ xmath256 . this gives the following upper bound of the temperature constant : @ xmath257 we have already shown that , because the @ xmath7 path does not pass through the origin , absolute values can be computed for the multifractality parameter @ xmath243 . the absolute values of @ xmath249 , corresponding to values of @ xmath9 , from @ xmath258 to multiplied absolute values of @ xmath259 are given in : [ t : fzetap ] , together with the number @ xmath56 of scaling octave , multiplied by @ xmath260 ( . . ( [ t : t ] ) ) . . [ t : fzetap ] for the feigenbaum temperature , we compute the relative value @ xmath7 , the absolute value ##s @ xmath66 ##0 , the multifractality parameter @ xmath249 and the number of scaling octave ##s .
