a two - dimensional quantum gas ( 2deg ) reacts sensitively to external magnetic fields . making the magnetic field known opens the door to a wide variety of new discoveries and applications , ranging from magnetic superlattices @ xcite and magnetic materials @ xcite to magnetic barriers for magnetic nanostructures . @ xcite a relatively simple magnetic barrier configuration is the _ _ barrier _ , or a uniform magnetic barrier _ , uniform in the in - plane direction and homogeneous in the opposite direction . @ xcite in a classical picture , magnetic barriers can be viewed as small barriers that select the axis according to their angle of attack . @ xcite in a classical picture without symmetry , one would reasonably expect that at a certain temperature , the _ _ _ _ , the electrons are free and the temperature is zero . recently , magnetic barriers have attracted much interest due to their potential applications as tunable spin sensors and amplifiers , many of which are highly desirable spintronics devices . @ xcite these recent results suggest that a high degree of spin sensitivity may be achieved with magnetic barriers in certain situations . given the physical properties and the nature of the magnetic barrier , it is surprising that only a few theoretical experiments with such barriers have been performed .in @ xcite , a magnetic barrier with a flat surface has been successfully generated in a more complex setup , namely a 2deg of a magnetic material . it was shown that , for large magnetic fields , the magnetic resistance is finite . the results of these experiments have been recently published as a theoretical model @ xcite , which assumes that @ xmath0 ##2 scattering at the surface of the 2deg , as well as edge scattering , reduce the resistance to finite values . in all the experiments described so far in ref . @ xcite , the magnetic barrier has been generated in both media [ 2 ] and heterostructures by surrounding the magnetic material , mounted on top of the substrate , with an in - plane magnetic field . @ xcite in such a case , the magnetic barrier arises from the z - axis of the magnetic field of the ferromagnet , see figure . this theoretical model is now the basis for a large part of the theoretical work . @ xcite + for an accurate understanding of the theoretical results , a comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the fundamental magnetic properties of tunable magnetic materials is needed . the experiments have already shown that both edge scattering and scattering in the same medium are possible . @ xcite + ,we build on these results and show in detail how the behavior of tunable semiconductor materials depends upon the @ xmath1 drift at the surface , on the elastic scattering and on thermal scattering . in order to study these effects , we have prepared our thin films from materials which have a very high internal induced drift of @ xmath2 . @ xcite this allows us to extend the experiment further into the elastic scattering , where the current through the structure is also determined by the value of stress tensor . in addition , the sample plate was used to measure the current flow . these results were obtained in a semi - empirical way based on the standard model for the ##s . @ xcite we assume that ( i ) the distribution of the @ xmath1 - induced drift and elastic scattering through the structure influences the electrical properties , ( ii ) the effects on the distribution of the components for the elastic - scattering lead to good correlation of the experimental results with the theory , and ( iii ) thermal scattering has a strong effect at high operating temperature . the description of the experiment is as follows : in part i , we describe the sample size , the experimental results and the measurement results . the measurement results areas in section iii , but the semi - empirical data and its application to our understanding are the subject of section iv . the section ends with a summary and a conclusion ( section v ) . the surface is @ xmath3 - heterostructure @ xcite with a 2deg @ xmath4 . the surface was first examined by using electron microscopy and other processing techniques . the hall effect surface ( ex . [ mb1 ] ) was obtained by using fourier analysis . cu / ge ion interfaces were established at source and drain interfaces and at the surface from 1 to 4 . a thin ( dy ) layer with a thickness of @ xmath5 was defined on the heterostructure surface by using thermal imaging at a partial thickness of @ xmath6 . a cu / ge oxide layer of @ xmath7 composition was placed on it to prevent the layer from forming under high pressure and to allow the electron density to be measured . several samples were analyzed , and all showed very similar properties . however , we have only taken from a single sample . the samples were inserted into a liquid crystal solution with a partial thickness , that showed variationof the temperature between @ xmath8 and room temperature . the experiment ##r was equipped with a special measurement chamber , so that the magnetic field could be measured along the y - z axis with an accuracy greater than @ xmath9 ##2 . [ not measured within the z - axis . therefore , not the z - axis of the magnetic field . ] the carrier density and the electron density were calculated from the micro - scale values of the components of the metric ##s , @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 with parallel magnetic fields . the ungated carrier density is @ xmath12 , and the density at room temperature of @ xmath8 is @ xmath13 , corresponding to a drude ##t time of @ xmath14 and an effective mean scattering time of @ xmath15 . the mean scattering time was calculated from the solution of the shubnikov - de haas equation @ xcite of @ xmath16 . the amplitude of the hall effect was also calculated to determine the parallel magnetic field configuration . from the parallel magnetic fields @ xmath17 of @ xmath18 , in our experiment , we know that the maximum effective parallel magnetic field configuration is @ @ xmath##19 . the external magnetic fields are also known to affect the magnetic properties of 2degs by changing the distribution of electrons and the holes . @ xcite in addition , the magnetic energy density is greatly increased . @ xcite these effects show up in a uniform and even tempered magnetoresistivity . applying the ##z moves the film further along the z - axis . the z - component of the fringe field of the 2deg is then applied at the edge of the film in the z - direction and forms the second barrier . @ xcite the y - and z - components of the fringe field are shown in fig . [ mb1 ] ( c ) for the absolute value of the saturation energy of x . note that the fringe field has the following mathematical form @ xcite , @ xmath20 is given by @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 is the distance of the 2deg from the edge and @ xmath23 is the thickness of the thin film , in fig . [ mb1 ] ( c ) . this equation describes the first magnetic barrier located between contacts 4 and 5 , which is important since it is very far away from the one located between contacts 2 and 3 .the characteristics of the magnetic film can also lead to conclusions from . . . we measured the current ##f using atomic force f ##s and found an extreme value ( a small deviation ) of @ xmath24 , which is cancelled out to a large extent at the 2deg . we therefore use the edge characteristics in the figure . the current of the x - component as a function of @ xmath17 is given by @ xmath25 , which can be obtained from the effect of the magnetic film @ xcite ##s shown above . the y - component of the magnetic field has a much smaller value at the 2deg and is very weak compared with the magnetic field used to measure it ( i . e . @ xmath26 , in the figure of fig . [ mb2 ] ) . this is also shown in the following . the current of @ xmath27 at the level of @ xmath28 is measured from source to source . the electrical current is obtained from the voltage measured between contacts 2 and 3 ( fig . 2 ) with a built - in amplifier . the same voltage measured between contacts 4 and 5 is used to measure @ xmath25 . we note in the figure above that the currenttraces at the edge of the same film differ only in their orientation . figure 1 shows a single magnetoresistance at @ xmath29 of our sample , located in plane b . the traces are hysteretic , reflecting the magnetic field of the surrounding film ( s ) . unlike the applied magnetic field at @ xmath30 , @ xmath29 has energies which decrease to half as the magnetoresistance of the same film , at an equal rate . this means that the micromagnetic field of the same film which is only changes when the applied magnetic field @ xcitehas a large increase in our samples . @ xmath29 decreases as it moves away from the magnetic field , but neither reaches nor blocks it , even from beyond the applied magnetic field . the slope @ xmath31 to @ xmath32 varies only slightly due to the magnetic field . as described in more detail above , if our sample were purely flat and without holes , it would slope to @ xmath33 away from the edge of @ xmath10 . however , for 100 % of the magnetic field being applied , the slope is limited by the coand other areas of research . note that the @ xmath29 measurements are slightly different at their poles . we attribute this difference to the proximity of the magnetic probe ( @ xmath34 ) to the magnetic barrier , in which the electrons ejected from the probe do not actually reach a contact surface , even though the electrons are about two thirds of their path away from the barrier . scattering effects have been studied by leadbeater et al . @ xcite and have been studied in detail by smith et al . @ xcite . the field strength of the magnetic probe ( shown in ref . [ mb1 ] ) is @ xmath20 , given by the field strength @ xmath35 in the z - direction of the barrier between poles 4 and 5 , i . e . , @ xmath36 , compared to @ xmath37 . , @ xmath38 has a scale factor which can vary from 1 , depending on the sample size and the average free path . @ xcite for our purposes , @ xmath39 is an @ xcite , and we have no reason to assume that , in contrast to the definition given in ref . @ xcite . thus , we have shown that the fieldthe open regime of our voltage barrier is well described by the ballistic model , even though the mean free path is less that the average of the two parameters . since , however , the fwhm of our barrier in the open regime is much less than @ xmath40 and therefore much greater than the mean free path , and the induced magnetic moment given by the electron density @ xmath41 for our barrier in the open regime , the ballistic model appeared in 2002 . @ xcite does not always hold as predicted , @ xcite . to the best of our knowledge , a model for the open regime is now available . for @ xmath42 , we estimate from the data @ xmath43 the induced density of @ xmath44 for our thin films . this is far below the optimal value for the model . we attribute this effect to the flow of electrons into the thin films during metallization , as well as to the structure of the material . @ xcite this model is supported by our observation of @ xmath45 growth over time in situations where the thin film is not covered by an i / o barrier . the [ mb3 ] shows the modelof the total magnetoresistance , the temperature is increased . as the temperature is increased , the magnetic barrier resistance is increased . at the same time , the shape of the barrier becomes more nearly circular and the current increases . thus , the # ##s , and are reduced to the current values of @ xmath17 . as will be discussed in more detail below , this phenomenon can be explained in terms of the change of electron mobility and the high coercivity of the barrier film . the temperature is increased , and the surface tension of the barrier surface plays a major role . this increased temperature is observed only at the standard model for the transition temperature of magnetic materials , @ xmath46 . @ xcite the increase of the transition temperature is the main cause of the deformation in our barrier film . our best estimate of the magnetic barrier resistance is given by the example of and . the model is based upon the standard model for non - magnetic materials @ xcite and the landauer - bttiker model @ xcite . electrons are injected into the barrier film , from the small x - plane @ xmath47 to the edge of the barrier at different points in the x - planeconsider the hall bar of regions @ xmath48 . they spread out with the same frequency , and their positions are equally distributed in the regions with the z - component . we use the wave equation describing the relative velocity of the electrons to determine their positions until either it is absorbed by the barrier and reaches the transmission line in the opposite direction , or until it passes through the barrier and reaches the corresponding region @ xmath47 to the right . at this point , @ xmath49 is zero . scattering the electrons over large areas does not change the signal . the regions of the hall bar have been covered with small , reflective edge fields in the region @ xmath50 . these reflective edge fields cause specular scattering . the radiation source is radiating as shown in fig . 2 the x - direction and also in the y - direction . we consider homogeneous scattering in the 2deg , so that two pairs of electrons which have a poisson process with a coupling constant of @ xmath51 . the electrons in the 2deg in a non - homogeneous system [ 1 ] of heterostructure are only scattered by the electron holes in the boundary layer , and the non _ zero ._ _ is assumed to have an almost uniform distribution of scattering angles . @ xcite we can obtain a uniform distribution of scattering angles @ xmath52 with a standard deviation of @ xmath53 , centered at @ xmath54 and parallel to @ xmath55 . in our model , the time of occurrence of the successive scattering events is a poisson process with an average deviation of @ xmath56 . at the second moment , the angle of the scattering and the final scattering angle , , are chosen according to the distribution function given above . these two angles are the best known values for @ xmath51 and @ xmath57 . + we note that our experimental results are not limited to the uniform distribution function of scattering angles . we have also obtained a probability distribution , with a high probability for scattering angles @ xmath58 and a probability of low for large fields . even though we have much lower values for the probability ( about 0 . 1 % ) for small fields , , the same values are obtained from the experimental results . for a small field , 40000 electrons of equal energy @ xmath59 are produced . the process is described by @ xmath60 ##0 , @ x##math38 is the angle between the z - axis and the direction in which the signal is traveling and @ xmath61 is either @ xmath62 or @ xmath63 depending on whether the signal with the higher x value is sent or received . we note that the carrier density under the hall gate will differ from that under the cr / cr gate , as a consequence of the schottky equations . the measurements at the positions 2 and 3 , as well as positions 3 and 4 , respectively , show that the carrier density inside the film is about 10 % higher when compared with the density of outside , but this value is irrelevant since the z - component of the hall gate effect depends on the external electric field in the z - axis and we are unable to add these two components to the total hall effect . @ xcite we have used this correction factor in our calculations . the solution is given by @ xmath64 where @ xmath65 is the number of electrons in our current state and @ xmath66 is the current level . we note that according to fig . [ eq4 ] , the gate state ( @ xmath67 ) is an ideal@ 2deg and the resulting solution does not converge to @ xmath10 . @ xcite from above . , the electrical field @ xmath10 at the boundary for a given radio frequency is also calculated from @ xmath68 . as a special case , we can shut off the electrons and set the electric field at the boundary to zero , thus producing a # ##al ##g which goes to infinity in the z - direction . in this case , the analytical results will follow the previous analytical results @ xcite and find the initial point of separation for which the electric field increases to the extent of 1 m . + with the first value of 0 . 5 ( bottom line ) , account for the magnetoresistivity of the 2deg which is set to a maximum value at @ xmath69 . closed circles : @ xmath10 for the structure with center ( edge electric field @ xmath70 ) and no edges ; squares : @ xmath10 for the structure with no edges and equal time to the previously calculated scattering time ; closed circles : for structures with equal center and edge electric fields ; open circles : @ xmath10 for the structure with center and a maximum average scattering time of @ xmath7##1 . 1 : the magnetic drift in the ballistic regime : electrons in the magnetic barrier ( trace 1 ) as well as @ xmath0 - induced and edge electric fields ( trace 2 ) are used for the magnetic drift . ( 2 ) properties of the magnetic barrier as a function of the temperature for large values of @ xmath72 including absorption and scattering . the values in the figure refer to the maximum temperature for which the proposed temperature range of the ballistic regime would allow ( the maximum absorption and scattering for @ xmath73 is shown in the figure ) . ] for a comparison of the models with the experiment , the model of @ xmath25 shown in the figure of fig . [ mb2 ] is used to map the properties of the magnetic barrier onto the experimental data of @ xmath17 . results of the experiment are shown in fig . [ mb4 ] ( 2 ) . most importantly , the addition of the edge electric field to the ballistic regime reduces the drift in the closed regime to small values . the electrons that would be scattered by the barrier away from the edge are absorbed into the barrier at the edges due to the @ xmath1 effect , forming the barrier .fig . [ mb4 ] ( a ) . this effect is the main reason for the high resistance in the barrier region , as long as it is suppressed . the barrier resistance increases as the edge electric field is increased . in our example , we have simulated an electric field of @ xmath70 . this value can be considered an upper bound , based upon consideration of the thickness of the barrier area @ xcite and in conjunction with the fact that a barrier effect of the magnitude of @ xmath74 will only occur at a distance greater than the barrier area . @ xcite we assume that the total barrier resistance is only partially dependent on the magnitude of the edge electric field . + for an infinitely large two phase barrier in a closed system , the resistance is only held constant by scattering events in the barrier region , see fig . [ mb4 ] ( a ) . this is best illustrated by the following equation , in the form of fig . [ mb4 ] ( a ) : a scattering event will produce an electron which in the absence of scattering would be absorbed by the barrier . for the mean free path up to and including the maximum thickness of the barrier , the effect is : ( least .see fig . [ mb4 ] ( a ) , where the measured electron - hole interaction is @ xmath75 ) . + in accordance with the measured trace in fig . [ mb2 ] ( b ) , we note that the measured trace for @ xmath29 that takes all the scattering into account and not the fields varies significantly with the experiment . thus , the measured trace magnetoresistance ( fig . [ mb2 ] ) has been replaced by the trace for @ xmath69 . the value of the measured trace is constant , but its mean value varies by up to 50 % . we point out that in this case , the only independent variable is the value of scattering potential under the conditions described by the measured trace for @ xmath57 and @ xmath51 , which is determined by the shape of the scattering potential ##s . from this simple comparison of the scattering potential , it appears that a combination of the elastic scattering and field - induced scattering produces @ xmath29 . in fact , combination of the elastic scattering potential combination with the measured scattering potential , as well as the applied scattering potential of @ xmath76 , gives a very good approximation of the measured trace , see fig . [ mb4 ]( b ) . we refrain from using the experimental data since several factors may have an effect on this level of accuracy . first , there is a slight distortion of the electron energy , which we attribute to changes in the magnetic barrier ##s . @ xcite ##s , the shape of the magnetic barrier may differ from c . , and thus may be ignored in the z - model . third , the electron density below the s differs from that above the z . this problem could in fact be avoided by using a thin , thin oxide layer between the silicon substrate and the ferromagnet . + in order to minimize the distortion of electron density , we have constructed the z - model @ xmath77 , using the expression in fig . , from which the energy at non - zero temperature is calculated via @ xmath78 where @ xmath79 is the free - electron wave function . [ mb4 ] ( 2 ) shows that the energy @ xmath77 is a purely linear function of the electron density . according to fig . , @ xmath80 is independent of that for @ xmath81 . a similar expression is usedsimilarly , from the theoretical description of the highly nonlinear , weak magnetic barrier in fig . 2deg @ xcite , see the example of fig . [ mb4 ] ( 2 ) . however , the combination of the edge scattering and temperature does not explain this phenomenon of the magnetic field due to edge scattering . we find , however , that the measurements of @ xmath29 with temperature differ , by the temperature dependence of @ xmath82 , also due to the temperature dependence of the scattering time . in our experiments , we find that the scattering times are different compared to @ xmath83 , and in fact , we did not find any changes in @ xmath29 , see fig . [ mb3 ] , and for higher temperatures , the original shubnikov - de haas measurements no longer allow a precise determination of @ xmath51 . therefore , a precise determination of the structure at higher temperatures gives more detailed information about the scattering time and the distribution of the energy than obtained from our experiments . we have also observed also the phenomenon of spin coupling in @ xmath29 ( with an energy g - factor of - 0 . 5 ) due to which the different scattering times have different energy##rmi , and hence the magnetic field , result in the spin effect of the current . our calculations show that the magnitude of the spin effect at @ xmath29 is small . however , it is true , that the spin effect of the current decreases with increasing field strength in the closed regime , and is larger @ xmath84 for parallel magnetic fields . however , this value is still a factor of two larger than the expected value for magnetic fields without transmission , and we find that edge scattering tends to increase the spin effect . even allowing for this factor , the resistance for a 2deg in ga [ al ] still remains very small . however , we have also modeled the spin effects induced by the local transverse magnetic field @ xcite and show that they are valid for our # ##ization . we have modeled the distribution of magnetic fields observed in ga [ al ] and heterostructures in the semi - closed regime as a function of in - plane magnetic field . we have also modeled the resistance , using a semiclassical model , and we find that the magnetic resistance observed in the closed regime results from both edge scattering at the boundary region and from transmission via @ xmath0 ##4 at the edge of the boundary region .by considering the relaxation times , obtained from the data , a very good balance between theory and simulation is achieved , by considering the uncertainty inherent in the crystal shape and direction of the magnetic field . furthermore , the barrier magnetoresistance is sensitive to thermal expansion , contraction , and magnetic field strength . the simulations also show how the phase shift induced by the magnetic field can be controlled , which may be of interest if one is to study other effects such as plane waves @ xcite and spin waves . first of all , much larger amplitude and plane waves of smaller amplitude can reduce the area of the barrier , and therefore increase the surface area . also , using soft edges reduces in magnitude the effect via @ xmath0 - 1 ; our simulations also show that using hard edges with magnetic fields in the form of @ xmath85 are unlikely to produce a significant effect . second , the use of thin - films under ultra - vacuum conditions should reduce the barrier area by up to a factor of 10 in our samples . our simulations can also be extended to include more complex magnetic barrier materials , for example those described above for use in tunable optical systems . @ xcite + the .and the first edition of the book by david jenkins , in discussion with hengyi xu as well as financial support from the _ heinrich - heine - universitt dsseldorf _ .
