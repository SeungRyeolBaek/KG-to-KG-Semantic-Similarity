the exotic hydrogen ##ic atoms are excited to highly excited states , when the electrons ( @ xmath2 ) are bound by holes . the deexcitation of these electrons proceeds via several different steps until the ground state is reached and a spontaneous emission takes place . despite a long history of theoretical and experimental work the mechanism of this atomic cascade is not yet fully understood . the theoretical problems with the exotic hydrogen - ic reactions pose a number of difficult problems requiring new experimental methods , the solution of which depends mainly on a basic theory of the atomic cascade . the experimental results are not limited to the reactions in the first step of the atomic cascade ( x - ray scattering and the effects of the weak - strong interaction of the charged electrons in the high - momentum state with the nucleus ) . all the following theoretical descriptions of the reactions both in low - lying and in highly excited states are necessary for the understanding and the interpretation of the experimental results . in this article we present the _ ab initio _ quantum - mechanical description of non - linear scattering processes of the four exotic hydrogen atoms after interaction with the hydrogenic nucleus in the ground state : @ xmath3 bragg scattering ( @ xmath4 ) , electron scattering ( @ xmath5 ) , andand deexcitation ( s ) ( @ xmath6 ) . the @ xmath7 are the atoms and @ xmath8 ; @ xmath9 are the primary and secondary quantum numbers of each atom . since the deexcitation energies are very important for the atomic structure , the combination of the collisional energy and the secondary quantum number @ xmath10 is also very important . the stark transitions change the structure of the @ xmath11 sublevels and together with the elastic scattering they affect the hydrogen atoms by changing their energy levels during the interaction . starting from the classical approach of stark and the @ xcite , the transitions have been studied in the semiclassical straight - line - scattering approach ( see @ xcite and others below ) . the general quantum - mechanical description of the elastic scattering and stark transitions based on the classical approach was introduced for the first time in @ xcite . in @ xcite , the transitions have also been studied in the cross - section approach with calculating the moments for the energies and taking the strong interaction potential into account in the theory . the cross sections obtained from the @ xcite are in perfect agreement . in the coupling approach , the interactionbut much less accurate , than for the @ xmath10 . the first work on the cd process was performed by bracci and fiorentini @ xcite in support of the semiclassical approach with some additional assumptions . in the first two experiments ( see @ xcite and see below ) the cd process was studied using the two approaches to the charge - diffusion problem . the same experiments were also performed in the coupled - quantum monte - carlo ( ctmc ) experiments @ xcite . although the experimental deexcitation cross sections obtained in ctmc experiments are in good agreement with the semiclassical approach of bracci and fiorentini @ xcite , the more - general cd approach ( 1 ) @ xcite has too few experimental cross sections to explain the experimental results @ xcite . the reasons of such a small correlation are not known . we can only assume that the semiclassical approach of bracci and fiorentini as well as the ctmc approach are only applicable for low - energy states and very low energies . the reasons ( 2 ) have been explained only by researchers using a different approach within the frame of the charge - coupled ( cd ) approach ( see for( @ xcite ) . the differential and integral cross sections for the processes ( 1 ) have been calculated for muonic , pionic and antiprotonic ##al atoms in the system with @ xmath12 and in a wide energy range suitable for these processes . the energy changes of the @ xmath0 states corresponding to spin coupling and spin interaction ( for hadronic systems ) are included in the charge - coupled model . this model attempts to predict the self - interacting behavior of all the processes ( 2 ) and is derived from the best results obtained in previous papers . the full differential and integral cross sections given in this paper will refer to the cc model to explain some of our best results obtained more recently . all the states corresponding to the al atom states with @ xmath13 ( @ xmath14 is the quantum number of the excited electrons ) have been included in the cc model . the structure of the lc system with @ xmath15 is also calculated and will be shown here . ( in the entire paper the cross sections are given in si units . ) the hamiltonian of the system @ xmath16 ( the calculation of the c . i . model ) is given by @ xmath17 where @ xmath18is the interaction energy of the system , @ xmath19 is the state space of the v . d . of the target atoms , @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 are their electron coordinates . the interaction energy , @ xmath22 , is a function of the electron - distance between the target atoms and the more exotic particles . @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 are the wave - function hamiltonians of the free electron and hydrogen particles , whose eigenfunctions agree with the total wave function @ xmath25 of the relative motion of the basis states , @ xmath26 , with the values the angular momentum ( @ xmath27 ) and the @ xmath28 . with the latter , we have the ` ` ' ' ' electron coordinates . the # ##d can be defined in a similar way to include the free hydrogen particles . the total wave function of the system is defined in terms of the basis states as , @ xmath29 the equation ( 1 ) corresponds to the non - linear second order differential equation for the wave function of the relative motion , @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 the total wave function is defined as@ xmath32 , where @ xmath33 and ( @ xmath34 ) are the components of the electron spin and the exotic atom quantum potential in the entrance channel , respectively . the kinetic energy of the exotic atom , @ xmath35 , the energies of @ xmath23 , @ xmath36 , and the energy of , @ xmath37 , due to the spin interaction and weak interaction ( in case of adronic atoms ) . thus , the state @ xmath33 will be equal to @ xmath38 in the entrance channel ( we note also that @ xmath39 ) the matrix elements of the quantum numbers , @ xmath22 , @ xmath40 are obtained by integrating them with the energy density function of the @ xmath41 - state and then applying the multipole method . the energy of ( @ xmath42 ) the matrix element ( 3 ) to the zero - energy . for the @ xmath33 the partial differential equation ( 2 ) for the respective @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 states are solved for using the numerov method with the plane - wave boundary conditions for the quantum numbers @xmath45 - matrix reduces to @ xmath46 - matrix in the case @ xmath47 . all the channels related to the hydrogen and interactions with @ xmath13 have been used in the follow - up study . the interaction of the hydrogen with @ xmath15 was also studied and will be discussed here . in the following table we list and compare the three total cross sections of the hydrogen spectrum : the total cross section @ xmath48 @ xmath49 the total cross section of the @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 , and the @ xmath52 - partial cross section @ xmath53 , and therefore the averaged total cross section . the total cross section calculated by the @ xcite and modern cc approaches are : they result in perfect agreement at approximately @ xmath54 % . the energy resolutions calculated by the old cc and modern @ xcite approaches differ in the calculation of the scattering pattern and show significant differences in the scattering ( see the cross section of fig . 1 ) . - the cc ( linear and elastic ) cross sections ( respectively ) : the cc @ xcite ( liquid lines ) and the cc ( gas lines ) . the @xmath52 - averaged differential stark cross sections for @ xmath55 collisions vs . bragg scattering angle @ xmath56 at @ xmath57 ev ( right ) . , title = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 45 . 0 % ] -

dependence of @ xmath52 - state transition cross sections for @ xmath12 ( fig . 2 ) and cross sections of the @ xmath58 transition for @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 collisions ( fig . 3 ) . it is evident from fig . 2 that @ xmath0 - state phase transition due to strong interaction leads to the maximum of the elastic @ xmath67 and elastic @ xmath68 transitions ( we have the maximum @ xmath69 transition for the @ xmath41 - state transition and @ xmath70 for @ xmath0 - state ) with energies consistent with the stark process . the same effect is observed for the hadronic transition . the mechanism of the cd process is quite different from the mechanism of the elastic and stark processes . in contrast to elastic ( stark ) the cd process is characterized by the large energy gap ( energy and( stark ) and even at higher frequencies , so the effects of the short - range transition are more important for the analysis of cd processes than for elastic processes . this distinction between cd and the elastic processes is illustrated in fig . 2 where the @ xmath43 comparison of the partial - wave half - wave cross section @ xmath71 for @ xmath72 with three different channels viz . 1 , 2 , and 3 , is done . it is clear that a large part of the cd cross section ( @ xmath73 ) comes from the partial wave with about a minimum @ xmath43 in comparison to the elastic ( stark ) process . in view of the value of the total cd cross section being about 50 per cent of the total elastic cross section it is necessary to understand it in the light of the classical model . for reasons , for the partial wave the value of the cd cross section is identical with the elastic cross section . the cd process is characterized by the short - range nature of the transition , which changes when the channels are used in series . therefore , to understand the process @ xmath74 in a straightforward way it is necessary to be compared with the two - channel process ( @ xmat##h10 and @ xmath75 ) and the transitions with the nearest @ xmath10 should be excluded . we studied the effect of the approximation on the number of open channels and found that the exclusion of the transitions with @ xmath76 leads to a greater number of the nearest @ xmath74 transitions in comparison with the two - level elastic approximation and due to this the overall cd cross section is more than @ xcite . so in all our previous studies we excluded only the open channels with @ xmath13 . it should be noted that all the previous studies of elastic transitions using semiclassical and elastic methods used the two - level approximation . it is clear that two - level approximation is not always suitable for the detection of transitions with @ xmath77 . in contrast to the elastic transition and elastic transition where the ` ` s ' ' approximation ( @ xmath78 ) and also the ` ##er approximation ( as in @ xcite ) give good results ( at the very high energies ) , in case of the highly energetic transitions such as , the cc approximation should be used as it is obtained from the previous calculations . it is also found @ xcite that the cd cross sections are notthey look like @ xmath79 . in order to show more clearly the dependence from the @ xmath79 , the two @ xmath52 - based cd cross sections separated by distance are shown in fig . 2 in comparison with the results of the sc models @ xcite for @ xmath80 and ctmc calculations @ xcite for @ xmath81 . as it is shown , the energy dependence of the cd cross section over the states @ xmath82 and , as a result , is in very good agreement with the models @ xcite and @ xcite . at higher energies the corresponding cc results show @ xmath83 dependence in comparison with the energy model ##s ( the cc result is shown in the ctmc calculations @ xcite for @ xmath81 ) and in comparison with @ xmath79 dependence derived from the sc models @ xcite and cc calculations @ xcite . the result for the two states @ xmath84 is quite different from the cc model @ xcite as shown in fig . the cc results show that the results with @ xmath85 are significantly better when compared with the results of the higher - energy model @ xcite .the @ xmath85 transitions make up a significant portion ( 35 % - 45 % ) of the total measured cross section for @ xmath86 . the angular distribution of cd was measured for the first time with @ xcite . [ in the theoretical model the angular distributions of the two transitions were assumed to be identical . the averaged cross sections for the @ xmath87 , with @ xmath88 and high - energy @ xmath89 transitions are presented in fig . 7 . in fig . 8 the @ xmath52 - averaged cross sections for the @ xmath90 transitions with different values of the transition energies from 0 . 01 ev to 1 ev are presented .

the contribution of the interaction with @ xmath103 is identical with the contribution for @ xmath102 = 1 and is close to 10 % . the size of the @ xmath0 state obtained in the @ xmath52 - state cd cross section is small compared to the molecular size of the @ xmath0 - state . in fig . 10 we can compare our results with those obtained in the semiclassical approach for the @ xmath104 state . the same agreement is found , but this correlation is very poor and in second place for the @ xmath10 ##3 . the interaction of the different states @ xmath84 is quite differentfrom the table ##atter @ xcite ##s ##n is shown in detail . the same preliminary results were obtained for the solution of the cross - channel problem for all the closed channels . although the energies with @ xmath15 for @ xmath105 and the energies @ for @ xmath106 ev are strongly correlated , they can only change the closed - channel wave function for short distances determining the energy . in the later calculations we included in the table all the closed channels with @ xmath107 and step by step the closed channels with @ xmath108 to obtain the majority of results . in fig . 12 most of our experimental results were obtained for the @ xmath52 - the cd cross section with @ xmath109 ev . according to our calculations , the closed channel effect for cd cross sections depends only on the energy difference . as it was shown from fig . 12 in terms of @ xmath110 , the use of the full set of the closed channels results in a very limited effect for high - energy interactions . the studies of interactions with the change of energy of closed channels are very time - consuming and are continuing indefinitely . the theoretical study of the compton scattering , electron scattering and thedeexcitation is performed using the quantum - mechanical cross - section method . the kinetic and energy cross sections for the above processes are obtained for the hypothetical muonic , pionic and antiprotonic hydrogen transitions with @ xmath12 and absolute values corresponding to the above processes . the following parameters for these transitions are obtained : because of the energy scale , a value of @ xmath103 , corresponding to @ xmath111 ( for @ xmath112 and the processes under consideration ) , and a high absolute value of the kinetic cross - section . the resulting cross - sections are very accurate for the case of the cd transition and provide a very good theoretical basis for the theoretical calculations of the actual process @ xcite . v . p . popov and v . n . pomerantsev , hyp . interact . * 101 / 102 * , 133 ( 1996 ) ;
