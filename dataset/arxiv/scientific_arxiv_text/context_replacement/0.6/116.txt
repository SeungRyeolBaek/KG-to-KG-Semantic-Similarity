stephan s quintet ( hk sq ) is a large radio galaxy group which has produced a highly dynamic surrounding medium ( s ) @ xcite through a long period of interaction and harrassment @ xcite . this interaction has produced a large - scale radio shock - wave , first known as a narrow line in the x band @ xcite , and later known as the x - ray @ xcite . the high - frequency ( @ xmath61000 ##2 , @ xmath13 ) interaction of the intruder galaxy , ngc 7318b , with the surrounding medium of the galaxy @ xcite is thought to be responsible for the shock - wave of the x - ray background radiation . the narrow line structure and the high linewidths provide evidence that the group is dominated by radio waves and by star formation ( xu et al . 2003 ; duc et al . 2010 , in press ) . the individual members of stephan s quintet are shown in figure 1 . central to the group is the main shock , as indicated by the 10 % radio wave composition . ngc 7318b , the intruder galaxy , lies to the north of the group , and the nearby seyfert b galaxy @ xcite ,and to the south . other members of the group are also interacting . the largest extranuclear star forming region , the sq - h @ xcite , lies at the extreme southern end of the sq active zone . ngc 7318a ( prototype of ngc 7318b ) is also a close interacting spiral galaxy , with ngc 7317 moving away from the center . the recent discovery of the bright , molecular - hydrogen h @ xmath9 line emission from the center of the h @ xcite , using the _ spitzer _ telescope _ @ xcite , has generated renewed interest in the sq system . a molecular hydrogen gas was detected with its radio emission matching the x - ray emission from the galaxy . the near - infrared ( mir ) h @ xmath9 linewidth was found ( @ xmath14 870 ##0 , @ xmath13 ) showing that the h @ xmath9 - type stars have a radio wave - like energy , representing a large fraction of the energy produced in the system . a theoretical model of sq , describing the interaction between two massive gas giants , suggests h @ xmath9 formed because of the light , dense material , and an open communication channel forhigh - energy sources are an alternative to x - ray sources @ xcite since the sq shock , but other galaxies with very low h @ xmath9 emission have been observed . @ xcite shows that a large - part of the cluster 3cr ##p galaxies exhibit the low mir h h @ xmath9 emission , despite running against a very strong galactic background . the high agn and star formation rate is used to explain the mir h @ xmath5 emission . the instability caused by the gravitational wave interaction with the nearby galactic nuclei is the main concern . in particular , mir h @ xmath9 emission in the clusters @ xmath15 ergs and @ xmath13 has been observed in the local group galaxies belonging to @ xmath16 ( * ? ? ? * m . de messieres - university of paris , founding member ) and in others in cluster @ xcite . the study of these galaxies will provide further insight into the evolution of these extremely young galaxies . the large size ( @ xmath6 / kpc ) of the sq cluster is well - suited for such a study . in this regard also , we extend the forward motion model of @ xcite to proper motion models ofsq uses the main telescope , the _ spitzer _ space telescope , _ _ spitzer _ . in section 1 , we will provide the 3 - d spectral measurements of the observed @ xmath5 stars on the surface of the x - ray source galaxy , and compare them with ours . in addition , several other papers are being published by our team which will explore the relationship between the ir / x - ray spectrum and emission from galaxies . in section 2 , we present our observations and data collection techniques . in section 3 we present the # ##s for different spectral types . in sections 4 , 5 and 6 we present our observations of the formation of the group and in section 7 the reasons for its formation . in section 8 we present our observations . additional material is presented in detail , with a description of ngc 7319 in appendix a , and a reanalysis of the high resolution mir spectra of the group , as well as renanalysis of the x - ray spectra presented in appendix b and c , respectively . in this section , we present a radial velocity of @ xmath17 for the group , corresponding to a distance of 1 mpc with @ xmath18 . near - infrared spectroscopy of the central region of sq was performed .the _ data @ xcite onboard _ spitzer _ . results were obtained in high - resolution image format , using the short - high ( @ xmath19 ; @ xmath20 ) and long - low ( @ xmath21 ; @ xmath22 ) methods and published on december 10 2008 and december 12 2007 , respectively . figure 1 shows the coordinates of the objects , based on a 3d image of the group . the # ##c map consisted of two separate , but complementary maps , the north and south of the x - ray area associated with the slit . the map was constructed with 21 steps of 7 . 0 ( 0 . 75 @ xmath2 slit width ) perpendicular to the slit and one parallel step of 7 . 2 . integration consisted of 3 steps with 5 cycles per step . the ll map was constructed to map the area of @ xmath23 with 21 steps of 7 . 0 ( 0 . 75 @ xmath2 slit width ) perpendicular to the slit and one parallel step of 7 . 2 . an integration step of 7 was constructed with 5 cycles per step . the frequency measurements were made using the _ spitzer _ data ##c ( ssc ) method , using s17 . 3 . 3 and s##17 . 1 . 2 for ll and ll data , which perform various operations such as curve fitting , cross - screening and flat - screening . the sampling for ll data is performed by the dedicated off - field observations , with the local sampling time , occurring immediately after the sampling time . in the case of ll , where for technical reasons the dedicated ` ` local ' ' observations were too far away in order to be sampled , samples were taken from observations at the end of the array that had different spectral line signatures . analysis of the data set revealed that the stray - light - source method ( that allowed for the migration from the off - field observations onto the sl1 / 2 camera array ) showed time - dependent self - illumination in some of the observations , possibly due to the large number of light rays during the imaging part of the scan . to address this problem , the same flat - screen images ( also taken from the same source ) that were used for ll and straylight detection were used . it was found that after background sampling , the residual stray light in the local spectral line signature was removed at the @ xmath24 % resolution . the stray - light removal was unne##ccesary , and the subsequent fully combined digital ( bcd ) images , were of higher quality than the previous bcds . for the project , the spectra for each module of down - weighted and weighted ` ` bad ' ' images were removed using specialized tools that allowed for only ` ` good ' ' removal . the images were split into data sets for each module using the software tool , tool @ xcite . the manual image removal was done using software . continuum images were obtained by placing two images on either side of a line and separating the rough line map from the rough straight line map . three dimensional images were also separated from the 3d cube by larger images . narrow - angle images with 10 and 20 @ xmath25 resolution were obtained with the _ spitzer _ observatory _ close - up imager ( pui ) and the kepler instrument . the pui was used for a 5 x 5 image with 5 degrees of change of brightness on 2007 december 10 . the software tool @ xcite @ _ spitzer _ completed the removal of sq on 2008 december 10 , with a maximum resolution of @ xmath66 . further image removal was performed by the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc )science pipeline ( version s18 . 0 . 1 ) based on the mopex software , and for the latter , the original cubic spectral model was also modified to allow for a large - scale temperature resolution . _ spitzer _ irac 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 , 5 . 0 and 6 . 1 images of sq ( e . g . houck ) were obtained from the ssc software ; these were included in science pipeline version s18 . 0 . 2 . the resulting images had a spatial resolution of 0 . 5 . the spontaneously excited state of molecular clouds can be determined by several methods . these include fuv ( far infrared ) proton emission , and the spontaneous collisional heating , of the h @ xmath5 in photodissociation regions associated with cloud nuclei ( e . g . miller & van dishoeck 1987 , hollenbach & tielens 1997 ) , spontaneous x - ray absorption and scattering interactions in molecular clouds , which in turn excited h @ xmath5 via interactions with electrons in the atoms ( lepp & mccray 1983 ; draine & smith 1992 ) and spontaneous collisional heating of h @ xmath5 due to heating caused by electrons ( e . g . shull & co##llenbach 1978 ) . the mir - mir line ratios are not very useful tools for distinguishing between these gases since all the mechanisms involved can lead to different thermalized level bands of low - temperature gas molecules . the different h @ xmath5 spectral bands do , however , allow us to identify gas at different temperatures and pressures with different properties ( this will be the main focus of part 2 ) . the level bands s - 1 s ( 0 ) - s ( 1 ) serve to identify hot gas , whereas the s ( 0 ) and s ( 1 ) bands are linked to the ` ` cold ' ' gas h @ xmath5 . although the line ratios themselves can not be used directly for physical measurements , see stephan 2007 . the combination of large - scale x - ray and infrared observations , and the spectral map analysis , provides strong evidence that the molecular cloud shown in part 1 is the result of a gravitational shock . in stephan et al . ( 2006 ) this analysis was used to show the weak association of the h @ xmath5 emission with the shock . however , in this case we can make a more strong association of the cloud with the shock by means of spectral maps . the spectral maps are used to create images ofand the six main emission lines of molecular hydrogen that were observed , including the high - magnitude s ( 0 ) 7 . 66 , s ( 1 ) 8 . 03 , s ( 2 ) 8 . 03 , s ( 3 ) 7 . 66 , s ( 3 ) 5 . 03 and s ( 5 ) 8 . 03 respectively . the z - profiles of these lines are shown in figure 2 based on the @ xmath26 - based analysis of the system from @ xcite . the s ( 0 ) and s ( 1 ) lines were mapped by the ll modules , the s ( 2 ) - s ( 3 ) lines were mapped by the r modules of the irs . as shown in figure 2 , the irs measurements were focused on the main ridge to find the signal to noise ( s / r ) ratio values . as a result , these measurements do not fully reflect sq - 1 and ngc 7319 . we note that the s ( 0 ) line at 8 . 03 ( 8 . 2e ) is weak , and probably resulted from interference from the pah lines at 8 . 2 and 8 . 8 . the lines indicate strong , strong winds moving north - south along the main ridge ( see fig . 2 ) . in addition we note thatemission from the star forming complex , sq - 1 , as well as interaction with ngc 7319 . we give the details of the agn - and mir ##i emission from ngc 7319 in figure a . figures 2a - 3 show a faint h @ xmath5 structure extending outward from the ` ` bridge ' ' s center . in what follows , we refer to this structure as the ` ` bridge ' ' . this structure is visible clearly in the _ chandra _ @ xcite and xmm @ xcite x - ray spectra and confirmed as either h @ xmath27 or h @ xcite , but is not visible in r ##metric ##s . as is shown in figure 2a , there is some variation in the intensity of the faint h @ xmath5 emission . the warm 0 - 1 s ( 0 ) emission ( fig . 2a ) appears to be concentrated towards the periphery of the galaxy , whereas the 0 - 1 s ( 0 ) s emission ( fig . 2b ) is more concentrated towards the center . the r ( 0 ) and r ( 1 ) spectra show that the h @ xmath5 from the shock is in a small region a few degrees north of the center of the seyfert spiral in ngc 7319, and in a smaller area to the right ( as in the s ( 2 ) map which shows the peak m / s ) . the s ( 4 ) and s ( 5 ) maps clearly show that the main h @ xmath5 emission breaks into two during the shock . in the limited coverage given to the ll map , the edge of the ` ` line ' ' is covered and sq - a is not covered . sq - a is not covered in the sl2 map ( because of the ` ` # ##line ' ' ' ) and so the s ( 5 ) map map shows that in sq - a the h @ xmath5 emission is more clumpy . the low - level spectra provide important information about the distribution of the h @ xmath5 within and without the x - ray region , but these details should be limited to a detailed 3 - dimensional analysis of the h @ xmath5 emission in region 2 ( smith et al . , november 1985 ) . thus we shall limit ourselves to the analysis of the h @ xmath5 emission . in the [ diagram ] we shall compare spectra of the specific regions of the shock and develop a general phase diagram for the2 . to further demonstrate the close relation between the h @ xmath5 line and the main ns x - ridge @ sq , we will show the distribution of the h @ xmath5 in relation to the x - ray and neutron lines . images [ 1 : xray _ 1 ] a and b show the s ( 0 ) and s ( 3 ) lines based on the xmm - y x - ray line @ xcite of stephan ##os ##t . the excited excited state is located along the axis of the main north - south ( ns ) x - ray line , and along the ` ` s ' ' , shows the close relative distribution of of hot x - ray lines ( 10 @ xmath28 @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 10 @ xmath30 k ) and cold h @ xmath5 ( 10 @ xmath31 @ xmath29 t @ xmath29 10 @ xmath32 k ) . although the h @ xmath5 appears to follow the x - ray , there are some differences . the cold s ( 0 ) line has been shifted to the right and follows the x - ray more closely relative to the warmer s ( 3 )2 . the s ( 0 ) line exhibits a close correspondence to the x - rays , except at the center of the shock , where we see heating at both ends . thus the region of highest dark energy , as represented by the brightest x - ray emission , appears to correspond to the higher - j h @ xmath5 region , thus demonstrating a similar relationship . the other binary system , sq - 1 , is largely absent from x - ray emission , as shown in the [ fig : xray _ r ] diagram , but is clearly present in h @ xmath9 . we see a similar relationship in the radio spectrum ( fig . [ fig : xray _ r ] c & d ) with the s ( 0 ) line in correspondence with the main line , but dominated by regions of the shock where we see more intense radio emission . the s ( 0 ) ( and s ( 0 ) , fig . 2c ) line exhibits a much closer correspondence with regions of the shock that are more highly excited than the lower - j regions . the radio emission is more strongly restricted to the most intense regions of the shock where x ##ray emissions are dominated by h @ xcite , whereas the brightest x - ray emissions are strongly limited to the brightest xof the shock @ xcite . as previously mentioned the ` ` ' ' ' emission is seen only weakly in the x - ray and very strong and absent at the microwave level . this spectral difference compared to the main shock also means that the lines that give rise to the electromagnetic radiation in the main shock are reversed in the microwave . emission from fine - structure lines provides useful data that show the relationships between the different properties of the surrounding shock medium . in @ xcite the lines were confined to the very center of the shock and very weak emission was observed from all but two other lines , [ @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 96 ( this data has been reanalysed and further described in figure 2 ) . in this article we describe the spatial distribution of emission from the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 , @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ]15 . 48 , @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 15 . 99 and @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 lines . in figure [ fig : b ] we have the spectral [ spectrum of the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 15 . 99 and @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] 15 . 99 lines , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 ##9 lines . given the combined spectral intensity of the f and ll components of _ spitzer _ , we can easily distinguish the emission from @ xmath10fe ##ii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 and @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 . however , as in the case of the seyfert star in ngc 7319 , the emission , that appears in figure [ fig : c ] , is assumed to be [ @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] with the emission from @ xmath10oiv@ xmath11 $ ] . there is strong evidence from the study of high - energy emission from the shock [ [ sq . for example , @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] has an estimated energy of 10 ev ( compared to 0 . 5 ev of @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] ) , and the @ xcite has shown that the @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] complex has strongly predicted high - energy emission for the gas causing the shock , as shown in fig [ 2 ] . assuming that , coming from towards ngc 7319 , @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] is the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] + @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] complex , we expect the emission from @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 0 . 5 . the location of the source of the shock ( as indicated by the x - ray ` ` x ' ' in fig . [ ref : xray _ x##d ] . ) . the energetic requirements for it to produce [ @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] shocks are highly high for @ xmath33 shocks . the energetic requirements of @ xmath34 shocks is low in the @ xcite . we will show the distribution of @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] in the main diagram section 2 . 2 . the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 48 emission is shown in section [ fig : f ] 2 . this fine structure also acts as a strong source of hii in @ xcite and we observe it from sq - 1 and from the regions of star formation to the west ( see section [ sf ] ) . in the main diagram , the distributions of @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] are well - defined . in direct contrast to the [ @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] distribution , which is [ @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 48 emission ( cf . [ fig : f ] )) , which followed the si ( s ) distribution , with respect to the crystal structure , and also to x - ray emission ( cf . [ fig : s ] b ) . although @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] is also observed in the hii regions , we will note here that , apart from the sq - regions , the observed ir signal does not coincide with that of strong pah ##2 ( gas bubble 1 ) in sq , but rather closely with the observed @ xmath5 and x - si ( s ) distributions . @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] acts as an effective moderator of x - ray - rich materials and is predicted to be one of the fastest - growing materials under these conditions @ xcite . we will show the role of @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] in the shock in figure 1 . 1 . @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 0 . 1 ( with an estimated energy of 0 . 5 ev ) is also observed in the shock , as shown in figure [ fig : s ] b , although it is also absent from the hii regions , withstar clusters , such as sq - 1 and the star - forming regions east of ngc 7318b ( see section [ sf ] ) . the @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 0 . 5 lines ( with an electric potential of 10 ev ) are found in the [ sf : 1 ] , and are associated with emission from the shock , as well as from regions of star formation ( see section [ sf ] ) . the [ h ] of @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] is much larger in the shock region , where regions of emission correspond closely to those seen for the h @ xmath5 s ( 3 ) line . the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] line , however , is a weak emission with regions of extended emission resembling those seen for the h @ xmath5 s ( 3 ) line . the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] line reflects emission from the shock , with @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] appearing near the edge of the edge of the shock , similar to what is seen for @ xmath10fe##ii @ xmath11 $ ] . the observations and results of sq @ xcite have shown that there are weak regions of star formation associated with the spiral arms of the spiral galaxy ngc 7318b . we explain in this section how these regions , which have a different brightness profile from the weak regions , are associated with the pah regions we see in the infrared images . in figure [ fig : dust ] a there is a strong correlation with the 11 . 3 pah distribution ( from the dust disk ) shown in the near - infrared image from _ galex _ @ xcite , which shows the infrared emissions from the regions associated with the star formation from the galaxy . this correlation indicates that the pah regions are dominated by star formation . a similar strong correlation is shown in figure [ fig : dust ] b where we see the 11 . 3 regions of the irac infrared image , which are dominated by the 8 . 8 and 8 . 8 @ xmath25 ##b regions . it is possible , however , that regions with the 11 . 3 emission from the disk , do not appear as strong in comparison . this correlation will be discussed in figure 1 . 2 . we compare the 11 . 3 pah distribution to the distribution of the 11in figure [ fig : dust ] c , showing the original 24 @ xmath25 m image of sq . 1 , it is shown that there is a strong correlation between the pah emission and the thermal dust , much of which is very poorly associated with the shock ridge . the absence of any star formation in the shock was also demonstrated by @ xcite . the important observation we make here is that the thermal , pah and gas emissions appear to be consistent with the observed star formation pattern and no significant star formation is observed in the shock ; this can be seen in figure [ fig : dust ] d showing the 24 @ xmath5 - - 1 - ( x ) - pattern in the irac 8 image . there is a correlation between the 24 @ xmath5 emission from the shock and h @ xmath25 m ( thermal dust , pah ) emission . this is important because it shows that there is very little visible star formation in the hot regions associated with the shock - generated 24 @ xmath5 . figure [ fig : dust ] d shows that there is also some gas emission at 24 @ xmath25 m from the shock ridge . the presence of dust in the shock is important for the determination of guillardet al . ( 2009 ) to confirm the presence of 24 @ xmath5 in the sample and we can see effects of melting onto the grains ( see figure 2 . 2 ) . thus the # ##er ##s could be the result of melting of very small grains ( vsgs ) , with very few grains remaining , which means that the grains are smaller and interact more strongly at longer wavelengths , where _ spitzer _ has the highest spatial resolution . a more detailed understanding of the strong and weak pah emission in the sq shock ( including observations from the satellite itself ) is provided in several articles ( guillard et al . 2010 . ; natale et al . 2009 , in press ) . guillard et al . ( 2010 ) suggest that the ir emission from the shock is weak due to it being dominated by the very low intensity of light , and having a strong pah / vsg ratio low in this region . a more detailed understanding of the actual presence of ir grains in the shock would require greater spatial resolution and a wider spectral range than that observed by _ spitzer _ . despite the lack of emission from the sq shock , the 24 @ xmath25 ir shock shows a distinct feature , which was not seen in previous studies ,note that the main causes of star formation in sq lie not in the shocks themselves , but in two very strong , almost perfectly aligned regions at each end of the shock . the region to the north is the most powerful sq - north , while the region to the south ( which we refer to as 7318b - south ) is not as strong and both regions lie at the end of the shock , as indicated by the h @ xmath5 distribution . this may not be a coincidence , and we will explain this further in figure 1 . 1 . the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 , @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 micro - grain lines , as described above , are common causes of star formation in sq . these lines are often associated with hii stars . the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 distribution appears to follow _ closely _ the h @ xmath5 and the star forming regions ( see fig . [ 1 : 1 ] below ) , being more prominent in the region than the [ h @xmath5 , and pointing to where the shock events , ngc 7318b - c , were observed from , and the pah region ( see ref . [ fig : 2 ] ) . the excited molecular hydrogen in stephan ##os also influences the x - ray absorption in the main shock and in the ` ` bridge ' ' region . this would imply that the molecular hydrogen is excited only by the x - ray absorption . therefore , we can say that the h @ xmath5 emission reduces by at least a factor of half the x - ray absorption from the main shock regions , thus ruling out the x - ray emission from the bridge . to determine the extent of the h @ xmath5 emission , we use spectra from the different sub - regions of sq which are shown in figure [ fig : ext ] . the spectra are obtained from the data collected from the shock region , and so to produce a continous image , it is needed to obtain the spectra . figure [ fig : ext ] a , b and c show the shock type ##s of the galaxy stephan ##e , a sub - region of the shock and a small part of the ` ` bridge ' ' . the e sub - region istend to be located south of the center of the shock , thus being affected by star formation by the shock . spectra for these groups are shown in figures [ fig : spectra ] a , b and c . all three groups , have the common feature that they are contaminated by molecular gas dust . the shock sub - region ( cf . [ fig : spectra ] b ) , in figure [ fig : spectra ] a , is more dense than the star forming regions described in the previous section . the mir region of the main shock is cooler than the shock sub - region with strong contamination from molecular gas ; this is probably the result of contamination from star - forming material in the main shock region . the mir has a very low continuum emission compared to the shock sub - region . figure [ fig : spectra ] b shows spectra from the irac instrument , and microwave - enhanced infrared ( pui ) and ground - based imaging data on the ir telescope . these are used to study effects of the shock , in particular star formation ( see fig 1 . 2 ) . the dust in the shock region , from the outer spiral arm of ngc 7318b , causes reflection of the shock region , located at an angular shortwards of r , in both ngc 8a and2 . there is a strong correlation in the near - infrared spectra of the shock regions , between the ir @ xmath5 emission and near - ir emission from the absorption lines . however the pah correlation observed in the spectra of the shock regions , and in the image of the ` ` bridge ' ' in the irac satellite images ( cf . [ see : below ] . ) , is weak . this suggests that these effects , observed in the @ xcite ##s of the galactic center , extend to almost the full range of the main shock and the ` ` bridge ' ' . this , and the fact that the ` ` bridge ' ' has similar x - ray emission to the main shock ( described above ) suggest that the bridge is a ` ` stripped - down ' ' version of the main shock . the exact lyman shift observed at this time is unknown . the possibility , that the ` ` bridge ' ' is smaller than the main shock , and the x rays produced by it have faded away , will be discussed further in part 2 . " the main shock observations seem to suggest that more than one large - scale galaxy - wide shock is occurring in the galaxy . this could be the result of multiple gravitational events and that multiple such shock events have taken placeand sq , consistent with what is observed in the x - ray @ xcite . figures [ fig : ext ] c and [ fig : spectra ] d show the stars ##s and s of sq - 1 , the main star - forming region . in this figure , although h @ xmath5 lines are still present , a longer period and an increase in the intensity of the metal lines due to the h @ xmath5 are consistent with a region that is less affected by star forming lines , which is also evident from the astronomical data @ xcite . the values for both the h @ xmath5 and s lines in the figure shown above are given in figure [ tableh2fluxes ] and table [ tablemetalfluxes ] , respectively . we show the flux measured from the h @ xmath5 line at the source star ##s in figure [ fig : spectra ] d . the flux from the sq - 1 - ( s ) line , can be calculated from figure [ tableh2fluxes ] ( for n = 1 mpc ) to = 1 . 0 @ xmath210 @ xmath35 ##0 @ xmath13 . thus the flux measured from thethe transitions for the main shock ( 0 - 1 h ( 1 ) and s ( 1 ) respectively ) and for an additional 1 % emission from these lines ( the figure refers to the diagram below ) , produce about 1 h @ xmath5 [ emission from the main shock of 34 . 5 @ xmath210 @ xmath35 ] @ xmath13 . this combined energy of the two emission lines increases by a factor of half the next closest near - infrared line , which [ @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 0 . 5 with a line length of [ @ xmath36 = 0 . 5 @ xmath210 @ xmath35 ] @ xmath13 . the [ 1 : 1 ] shows the combined power of the low - energy 0 - 1 h @ xmath5 lines for the main shock line . the lines are exactly identical to the model with three additional transitions ( t @ xmath37 = 158 @ xmath38k , t @ xmath9 = 412 @ xmath39k , and t @ xmath40 = 1500 @ xmath41k ). it is clear that in general , many different temperature variations are present in the system , and the mean - motion model is only an approximation . however , it does allow us to obtain an estimate of the critical mass of the h @ xmath5 of 0 . 1 @ xmath4210 @ xmath43m @ xmath44 . the h @ xmath9 is more complex than is described in the model because it depends on the value of the u ( 2 ) parameter , which may be far too large due to pah effects ( see ref . [ 2 : 1 ] ) . in part 2 we will present a more detailed three - dimensional model of the structure of the h @ xmath5 - sq and the changes in the shape of the spectral lines within and outside the mir in more detail . our studies have shown that h @ xmath5 is the dominant thermal emission in the mir . however , how does it compete with the most common emission in high - pressure , namely the x - ray emission ? @ xcite shows that the h @ xmath5 emission is stronger than the x - ray emission at the shock surface . this can only be observed in most of the shocksq model . we perform a detailed reanalysis of the xmm - based model of sq using the above data ( see table a for more details ) in order to adjust the flux and intensity of the x - ray lines to meet our theoretical expectations . the figures show the relative intensity of the h @ xmath5 line as compared with the x - ray emission from the main source . for the main shock , the x - ray ` ` x ' ' value of h @ xmath45 = 2 . 95 @ xmath2 l @ xmath46erg s @ xmath13 @ xmath47 corresponds to 2 . 95 @ xmath2 l @ xmath35 ##0 s @ xmath13 , and s ( h @ xmath5 ) / l @ xmath45 = 2 . 95 . this is a theoretical problem since we have not managed to measure the contribution to the main shock gas of the entire galaxy - scale x - ray source upon which the emission from the shock depends . thus it is assumed that the h @ xmath5 line only dominates over the main shock x - ray emission with a 1 @ 2##math48 ##0 . 0 calculations can be done for the various regions for which the @ xmath5 values have been obtained . for example , for the ` ` l ' ' region , which we have already determined has most of the same elements as the main sequence , we have calculated ( l @ xmath5 ) / l @ xmath45 = 0 . 0 . these results indicate that during the entire lifetime of sq , the nuclear - emission line dominates among the x - rays in this massive region . this is a very important finding , upturning the previous assumption that x - ray emission likely dominates even during the early stages of formation of large populations of stars . the fine - grain ##ed ##es ( see also [ tablemetalfluxes ] ) can be used to determine the structure in the various regions of sq . the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 % is an estimate of the amount of light in the region . as mentioned above , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] is only a list of hii sources , whereas [ @ xmath10##siii @ xmath11 $ ] ratios can be determined via several mechanisms , either by scattering of x - rays ( xdrs ) , or by absorption . in the above example , the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 ratio of @ xmath6 1 . 1 is large compared to , for example , the intruder galaxy ( @ xmath6 1 . 1 ) and agn ( @ xmath6 1 . 1 ) of the sample ##ong @ xcite . however , this small ratio is limited by star formation data from sq - 1 and the intruder galaxies . a better approximation is provided by the initial absorption sub - model , where the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 ratio is @ xmath49 . however it is clear that the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] ratio is well within the normal range of values , even for a well - resolved agn . thus the upper limit is for @ xmath##10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 0 . 48 for the ` ` x ' ' region , we find a range of @ xmath50 ##km , well below the range of the galactic gas density . however , these lower values are typical of galactic disk regions where the gas is poorly understood ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? we will see in the next section that gas is being ejected in regions of strong shock @ xmath51km @ xmath0 and deposited onto dust grains . the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 82 % for the core region and sub - region ( @ xmath6 ##1 . 48 ) is in agreement with that found by @ xcite for their measurements of snr . for the nearby star formation of sq - 1 , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 82 / @ xmath61 . 48 , only slightly lower than the value of @ xmath6 ##1. is used for star - forming regions in the region ##ong @ xcite ; . indicates that sq - 1 is produced from star formation . in star - forming regions the @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 15 . 81 / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 this can be used as a measure of the strength of the radiation field as it is proportional to the effective temperature of the radiation field . in the main region , we have a value of @ xmath52 which would be fairly normal compared to those found in starburst regions , which range from @ xmath53 @ xcite , and in galaxies , ranging from @ xmath54 @ xcite . the second subregion has a value of 1 @ xmath55 indicating a high temperature radiation field outside of the main region . however , it is clear from the size distribution compared to the 7 and 9 @ xmath5 regions , that most of the radiation is not produced from star formation , and that they are the main source of neon . the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 15 . 81 / @ xmath10neiii @ x##math11 $ ] 15 . 56 ratio can be used to determine the shock velocity from the data and the parameters of @ xcite . for the main shock this ratio corresponds to a velocity of between 200 and 300kms @ xmath13 ( with preshock values of @ xmath56 @ xmath57 and the values @ xmath58 = 0 and 0 . 5 the same equipartition values ) . we cannot , however , detect radiation from starforming regions of the main shock and can only separate this region from that region of the shock . to do this we use the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 and @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 15 . 56 ratios to the effects associated with star formation ( see figure 1 . 1 ) and gives a lower bound for the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 12 . 81 / @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 15 . 56 ratio in the case of @ xmath6 1 . 1 . this ratio corresponds to a shock velocity of @ xmath6 150kms @ xmath##13 . the total electron density was calculated from the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 18 . 48 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 18 . 48 ( for electrons of the same kinetic energy ) ] . for sq - 1 we found a density of @ xmath60 . 40 , and measured the resulting h @ xmath60 . 40 . this corresponds to the energy density of @ xmath59 @ xmath57 @ xcite for si , i . e . , the high - energy density for this group @ xcite . our observations have shown that the molecular hydrogen and x - ray hydrogen clusters appear to have a similar density , and we have ruled out the possibility that this is a result of x - rays from the h @ xmath5 , since the h @ xmath5 is the same density . how else can we explain the different distributions ? are these observations consistent with the hypothesis that the cluster is located where the spiral galaxy ngc 7318b collided with a pre - existing spiral tail of this galaxy and of ngc 7319 after a nuclear collision with a group of @ xcite ? this proposed molecular mechanismis , as can be seen in figure [ 1 : hi + h2 ] which shows that the h @ xmath5 component ` ` fills in ' ' the gap in the hi magnetic field as created by the vla @ xcite . the result is that the hi has been split into both a hot x - ray component and a cold h @ xmath5 component by the collision of the hi with the very hot hi . much of the explanation of how this high - speed ( @ xmath60 @ xmath61 h @ xmath13 ) collision can lead to both x - ray and very hot hydrogen cloud formation is presented in the article h @ xcite . the high - speed collision of ngc 7318b with the hi component ( thought to be part of a dense cloud ) leads to dust particles passing through and surrounding the stars ( which are the nucleation centers for h @ xmath5 components ) as opposed to the low - speed hi , which is less - sensitive to x - ray tempertures . the h @ xmath5 component produces much cooler gas with less mixing . both the formation of the hot x - ray components , and thethis phenomenon is a direct consequence of the cold nature of the pre - shocked material . analysis of the h @ xmath5 component of @ xcite shows that the phenomenon can be caused by high temperature ( @ xmath62 ) magnetohydrodynamic clouds in the cold ( @ xmath63 ) h @ xmath5 layer . the molecular clouds last long enough to be driven by pressure in the pre - shock layer , translating into the maximum thermal kinetic energy of the gas . this phenomenon is consistent with both the cold h @ xmath5 linewidth ( 870kms @ xmath13 ) measured by the high - resolution infrared spectroscopy of @ xcite , and the melting temperature of the hot h @ xmath5 ( based on the infrared spectroscopy data - see table below ) which contains the gas at high temperatures at the core and the grain boundary . all these values are consistent with h @ xmath5 being present in the hot pre - shock material . both pre - shock pressures and post - shock pressures occur in regions of si and hii that have cooled , and where the water content has been reduced @ xcite . pre- very large molecular clouds ( gmcs ) which would have been embedded in the surrounding atmosphere , would be highly unstable and collapse rapidly , possibly forming stars . this scenario , as for sq - 1 ##k @ xcite , would also apply to 7318b - 1 . however , if this were the case , it would fail to explain why two such gmcs happen to be located at the opposite sides of the galaxy , an unlikely explanation . more likely , however , is that the strength of the shock wave causes the formation of stars at the end of the shock wave in regions where the gas flow is more efficient . as mentioned above , the number of shocks observed in the central region of sq can be described in terms of the number of shock frequencies . the two shock frequencies ( @ xmath64 and @ xmath0 ) are associated with the high energy pre - shock regions and the post - shock x - ray shock regions . these are called @ xmath33 , and have a discontinous state of thermal equilibrium and are called the @ xcite . @ xmath34 frequencies have a short time period so that the transition from pre - shock to post - shock is slow and is notnon - linear @ xcite . the high energy states associated with the main precursor @ xmath5 # are @ xmath62 @ xmath34 ##2 @ xcite . @ xcite . the spectral power is associated with shock regions that do not include the radiative shock @ xcite . the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 emission associated with the sq region of sq is very weak , but corresponds with the most extreme part of the shock region observed by the x - rays ( cf . [ 2 : 1 ] ) . we can see the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 emission associated with the sq region . hydrogen and neon have a different first and second emission potential . their first emission potential ( 7 . 5 and 8 . 8 ev for fe and si , respectively ) are lower than that of neon . their second emission potential is higher ( 15 . 5 and 17 . 5 ev ) . the mir @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] ] spectral lines from the sq region could also befrom the neutral , as well as neutral gas . we calculate the gas from the neutral gas . the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath65m ) / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath66 ##m ) and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath67m ) / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath66 ##m ) line ratio . the [ @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath66m ) / @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath68 ##m ) long - range line ratio ( see figure 2 ) shows that @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] is the dominant reaction mode of ne in the sq range . unlike co and co , it is not significantly enriched in the @ xcite . because the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] @ xmath66 ##m gas has a high energy , ( @ xmath69 @xmath57 , xu and keto 2007 ) , the optical line emission corresponds with the ir spectrum of the noble gas . the optical line emission from the sq ##l is described in detail by xu et al . the relative values of the @ xmath10oi @ xmath11 $ ] ( 6300 ) and @ xmath10nii @ xmath11 $ ] ( 6584 ) corresponding to the @ xmath27 line ratio are indicative of shock effects . the [ @ xmath10sii @ xmath11 $ ] ( 6716 / 6731 ) line ratio as well as the mir @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] line ratio corresponding to the theoretical upper limit ( in figure 2 ) and comparison with the theoretical model of xu et al . ( 2008 ) shows the pre - shock line ratio to be the @ xmath70 @ xmath57 or higher . in the [ 1 : sil _ 1 ] we see the values ( in brackets ) corresponding to the lower mir limit ( including the upper and lower limit ) for the @ xmath10neii @ xmath1112 . 0 \ n $ ] optical line ratio .( in section 5 ) . for comparison the expected emissions from the two lines of @ xcite ##s calculated for the pre - shock - phase of @ xmath70 @ xmath57 and the values of the shock energy , @ xmath58 = 0 . 5 and 1 . for comparison of the lines , the shock energies from 100 to 300kms @ xmath13 are used and the energy lines which do not match the [ @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] / @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] expected emission lines ( in section 6 ) are used . the [ @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath65m ) / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath66 ##m ) and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath67m ) / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath66 # ) , are much higher than the observed values . the hydrogen and carbon atoms are both destroyed in case of the explosion . thethe phases of these reactions do not affect the physical properties of the material and the observed changes only correspond with the gas phase changes . we can see the correlation between the irs ##s and os observations , accounting for fe and si respectively . we take the values of the changes shown by the data ( @ xmath650 % and @ xmath660 % for fe and si , respectively ) and the [ 1 : sil _ 1 ] as upper bounds since there could be a contribution to the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] line emission from non - nuclear @ xmath33 - shocks into the h @ xcite . these events could also contribute to the @ xmath10oi @ xmath11 $ ] ( 6300 ) line emission as suggested by guillard et al . further observations of the irs @ xmath9 ##3 - shock line emission in the near - infrared should allow us to determine whether they might be related . the contribution from non - nuclear events to the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10##siii @ xmath11 $ ] line emission would explain the existence of the fe and si as well as the fe / si isotope ##s because non - metallic elements do exist . @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] line emission and the @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath71m ) / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] ( @ xmath72 ##m ) line emission values of @ xmath33 - 4 for the latter are lower than for those measured in figure [ fig : sil _ 2 ] . a key element to explain the phenomenon we see in sq , as well as a part of the standard model of h @ xmath5 emission , is the amount and type of cold h @ xmath5 , as measured in co . a comparison of cold h @ xmath5 compared with the hot h measured in sq would provide some insight into chemistry in the surrounding gas . in figure [ fig : 2 ] we see the bima ##p ( 1 - 3 ) gas pressure measurements from @ xcite , compared with the h @ xmath5s ( 0 ) and s ( 1 ) are used , based on the infrared spectrum of sq . these interferometric measurements use the large infrared beam of light , focused on the core , to detect regions of high co concentration in the core . the beam reveals regions of recent star formation centered at 20 and 25 the nuv ( see section [ sf ] ) , between sq - a and 7318b - a . as determined by @ xcite , the core of ngc 7319 is located in two regions . the primary region is that of the shock located in a large debris disk . the secondary complex is located close to the debris disk indicating a region of recent star formation in the group . the co concentration does not correspond with the concentration of warm h @ xmath5 stars , located in ngc 7319 . the warm h @ xmath5 concentrations are strongly different from the concentration of cool h @ xmath9 . even the s ( 1 ) spectral line ( see ref . [ 2 : 1 ] below ) , which contains the most warm h @ xmath9 , does not show lines corresponding to the high co concentrations . in a 2010 study ( guillard et al . 2010 , in press ) ,we also report the first observations of @ xmath73co ( 1 - 1 ) and ( 1 - 1 ) lines , along with the mir h @ xmath9 in the sq region , using the multi - lens 10 m iram telescope . these observations show that none of the co gas in the region has been observed by us ( because of the broad linewidth ) and suggest that the co gas is still present in the region , and extending beyond the h @ xmath9 - sq region and towards ngc 7319 . the presence of the co gas , characteristic of star - forming regions , in the recent study , appears to be very consistent with the broad linewidth in agreement with the appleton et al . ( 2006 ) conclusion that the mir h @ xmath5 lines are still very strong and supported by the high resolution measurements of irs . the co gas also agrees with our re - analysis of the appleton et al . ( 2006 ) interpretation ( see appendix a ) and more detailed and better irs data , which shows the emission of the h @ xmath5 lines at wavelengths similar to that of the ngc and the result supports the conclusion that the h @ x##math5 + was present in the fig . section [ sf ] of the star forming regions observed in sq and found that there was very little evidence for star formation in the region associated with the warm h @ xmath5 region . the main shock produced a large amount of hot molecular hydrogen ( 6 . 2 @ xmath210 @ xmath43m @ xmath44 ) , a source of energy for star formation as it occurs ( see figure [ sf ] ) . we study star formation in the warm h @ xmath9 - sf region by studying the shock sub - region , thought to represent star forming regions in the sq region , which is also subject to radiation pressure from these regions . pah emission is the primary mechanism of star formation , as the molecules are unstable and easily disrupted by strong magnetic fields . in the region of the main shock and subregion ( fig . [ sf : sf ] a and b ) the pah emission bands of 6 . 2 , 7 . 2 and 8 . 2 are much weaker compared to the 6 . 2 bands , which when observed are usually dominated by the pah emission @ xcite . in the shock subregion we find an upper limit value for the 6 . 2 pah of@ xmath74 wm @ xmath75 and both of @ xmath76 wm @ xmath75 and @ xmath77 wm @ xmath75 for the 7 . 7 and 11 . 3 samples respectively . this corresponds to a 7 . 7 / 11 . 3 pah ratio of 0 . 5 , very low compared to the corresponding value observed for the sings sample of 0 . 5 @ xcite . the decrease of the 7 . 7 / 11 . 3 pah ratio has been observed in agn samples ( e . g . low - density agn in the sings sample of * ? ? ? * ) and is thought to be the cause of the production of pah molecules large enough to produce the 7 . 7 . pah loss in the shock due to larger particles being more energetic than smaller ones is discussed further in guillard et al . an alternative explanation is that the pah molecules are more dispersed and absorbed in the shock , producing the 7 . 7 emission in comparison to the larger pah molecules . a detailed description of the shock and pah emission spectrum can be found in guillard et al . ( 2010 ) . shock production in the mid - and late -sq can be used to measure the rate of star formation taking place @ xcite . we measure the light flux in this region of 0 . 408 mjy , compared to the low flux ( @ xmath78 ) of @ xmath79 . this light flux is associated with the low mir spectrum ( cf . [ see : mir ] below ) , resulting from emission from vsgs produced by the solar magnetic field . we can combine this with the measurement of the h @ xmath27 flux in this region to calculate the star formation rate ( sfr ) , assuming that they are known ( h @ xmath27 is the observed stellar population and expansion as a result of re - emitted uv radiation ) . we use @ xmath80 , but note that the @ xmath27 value of sq is not the result of uv - induced @ xcite and can be considered an upper limit for future star formation . when we combine @ xmath81 with @ xmath82 , and the spectrum of @ xcite , we obtain an sfr of @ xmath290 . 05 @ xmath83 . a similar rate of star formation can be obtained fromthe pah strength . using the sample of @ xcite , taken from the starburst region of @ xcite , we can use the 7 . 7 flux density as a measure of star formation . the sing subregion has a 7 . 7 flux density of 1 . 5 mjy which corresponds to the sfr of @ xmath84 , in good agreement with our previous measurements , but with an upper limit . the pah strength indicates emission from other star forming regions in the shock . a point of concern , however , is that this star formation measurement may be biased so that we have a 7 . 7 flux compared to the 7 . 7 pah . comparing the @ xmath85 ( 7 . 7 ) / @ xmath82 group to the one in question , we find that the ratio of @ xmath86 matches that of star - forming regions @ xcite , which suggests that the rates of star formation are different , but self - consistent . the two _ upper limits _ for the sfr of the group suggest that star formation is occurring in the region away from in the main starburst , sq - 1 , which has an sfr of @ xmath87 . the center of the galaxy @ x##cite . this would be consistent with the amount of molecular gas being generated by mhd collisions in the surrounding gas . since the shock effect increases with increasing temperature and turbulence and tidal forces can cause collapse , the surrounding molecular gas itself would be too short - lived and unstable to sustain collapse and cause further star formation @ xcite . the presence of a large amount of molecular gas after the shock is a key factor in this scenario , as discussed in the [ co ] . the recent observations show that molecular star formation in molecular gas requires a large amount of the kinetic energy released by high - speed collisions . for this , and to get a sense of what this gas would look like at high speed when approaching a neighboring galaxy , we present in the [ 3 : 1 ] the rotational spectrum for the entire group ( i . e . , the two neighboring galaxies and the sun ) . the rotational h @ xmath5 line observed from the entire group h @ xmath8 and is therefore the most visible mir ##e . because the brightness of the rotational h @ xmath5 lines is such that they could be detected at high redshift with a near - infrared , 1 - cm - like sp##ica , safir ( ) , et al . how likely is it , then , that high - energy particles play a role in the formation of disks ? there is some evidence that disks at higher temperatures are h @ xcite and more clumpy ( e . g . conselice et al . 2005 , elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) . ) bournaud & elmegreen ( 2009 ) discuss the role of the gas phase in the galactic disks , especially disks at h @ xmath88 temperatures , and show at least a small proportion of the disk systems are formed by gravitational shocks , very similar to those described by dekel et al . to what extent the build - up of these disks is considered ` ` normal ' ' is not entirely clear since the process is likely to be a slow process . in a more general sense , particles evolving into the most massive dark matter can produce large pressures , most likely in an inhomogenious manner ( e . g . greif et al . 2008 ) however , raises the question of how effective h @ xmath9 ##8 can be in these disk systems . simulations of the formation of the disk systems show that the disk structure ofand the formation of molecular hydrogen when the first structures enter the universe . it is now generally assumed that , even in the early stages , molecular hydrogen is the only element after that that forms the very first structures ( e . g . bromm et al . 2001 , santoro and shull 2006 ) . however , our observations suggest that , under the right conditions , especially in high metallicity regions , molecular hydrogen can be very stable [ this is dominating by a factor of two over the more common @ xmath10siii @ xmath1134 . 0 \ \ $ ] . [ see strong interaction . if there are regions of high density where the shocks go into a clumpy , turbulent environment , then our observations imply that molecular hydrogen cooling should not be considered to be significant . on the other hand , this should not be a major problem . our theoretical model of stephan - h @ xcite involves the formation of h @ xmath5 , a rapid - cooling system in which shocks stop hydrogen in some regions , but start cooling in others - thus facilitating h @ xmath5 cooling . in the early stages , this rapid cooling , which has so far been observed , will depend on thetemperature and composition of the individual dust grains , in comparison with the composition , temperature and density of gas , and the l ##s from the main shock and agn . in this paper we have summarized the results of the mid - infrared spectrum analysis of the stephan ##o ##1 system using the _ spitzer _ telescope _ . we present here our two main results : * the strong h @ xmath5 peak produced by @ xcite ##s is only a small fraction of the galaxy - wide peak h @ xmath5 ( with a weighted mean value of @ xmath89 ##1 / @ xmath90 kpc @ xmath7 ) that dominates the mid - infrared spectrum of the group . there is evidence for a ring - like region , the so - called h @ xmath5 , between the main shock and ngc 7319 , which is probably a result of the gravitational interaction within the system . the spatial distribution of the components of the h @ xmath5 h - l - s reflects changes in temperature and composition throughout the entire system - this will be discussed further in table 2 . * the strong h ( h @ xmath5 ) / h @ xmath91 bridge between the main shock and @xmath92 , and @ xmath62 . * note the ` ` ` x ' ' ' . the observations indicate that mir ##i @ xmath9 ##3 indicate a stronger thermal than x - ray emission from the molecular structure , indicating a strong cooling effect observed on a large scale in sq . this confirms the previous observation that x - rays show up at different times in the different stages of the galaxy evolution . since h @ xmath5 occurs on the surface of dust grains , we assume the grains interact with these molecules , but the strong background magnetic field produces almost no interactions at all . * unlike previous observations of the abundance ##s in the galaxy , we study the molecular structure in the light of the ( @ xmath93 and @ xmath0 ) background radiation . observation of the @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] , @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] peak energies suggest that both carbon and oxygen are released onto dust . this also indicates that carbon was not absorbed by the dust .* star formation in sq is dominated by sq - b and 7318b - b , located at the extreme end of the instability zone , at all wavelengths , and they exhibit slow mergers and starbursts . however , clouds dominated by the h @ xmath5 also exhibit very slow star formation rates , consistent with a galactic environment where h @ xmath5 is much cooler and the stars are too short -

ray emission @ xcite and is visible at longer wavelengths @ xcite . however , we see an overlap between the lines of the h @ xmath5 emission of ngc 7319 and the seyfert line , which suggests that the ` ` bridge ' ' is a separate entity and is not produced by the agn . the agn of ngc 7319 does not form a well - defined structure , but forms broad lobes with multiple centers , asymetrically aligned along the long axis of the h @ xcite . this lobe runs s / sw and its position relative to the h @ xmath5 lobe ( which runs se ) is also associated with causing the formation of the h @ xmath5 structure . this is also evident from the relatively low power of the agn , as shown in the spectral line analysis shown above , and from the x - ray where it is only a fraction of @ xmath62 greater than the power associated with the main sequence and ` ` bridge ' ' . in the [ c : r ] we see the two spectral lines of the @ xmath##10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 ( compared with @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] 25 . 99 @ xmath25 ##0 ) , @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 82 emission lines . with the high spatial resolution of the f and ll components of _ spitzer _ , we could easily separate this emission from @ xmath10fe ##ii @ xmath11 $ ] and @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] . the agn at ngc 7319 is known to be strong , with @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] emission lines occurring in x - ray absorption regions ( xdrs ) in the agn @ xcite . the emission from @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 48 and @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 33 . 82 is due to the high dark energy associated with the agn . the pdrs and x -

dominant @ xmath10oiv @ xmath11 $ ] 23 . 96 @ xmath25 m and @ xmath10feii @ xmath11 $ ] 34 . 02 m line , as well as the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 23 . 96 @ xmath25 m line . @ xmath10nev @ xmath11 $ ] is found at between 23 . 01 and 23 . 02 @ xmath25 , the line not found in agn .however , in the case of the other observed galaxies , there is a rising thermal continuum more typical of a starforming galaxy than a typical seyfert ii , although as recent studies have shown ( wang et al . 2006 ; deo et al . 2007 ) , seyfert ii galaxies show a mixture of mir ##i lines at different wavelengths . ngc 7319 the thermal continuum is similar to that found in the seyfert ii galaxy ngc 3079 ( deo et al . 2007 ) , and it has a strong starburst component in the near - infrared . spitzer imaging reveals not only a hot core , but also several shocked regions within the nucleus . [ the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 0 . 0 @ xmath25m / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 1 . 0 . as a function of energy levels , we find a ratio of @ xmath61 . 0 which is low compared to the energy ratio found for agn regions ( @ xmath94 ) in the _ spitzer _ imaging _ galaxies study ( 2007 ) , but high compared to star - forming regions ( @ xmath95 ) in theknown as @ xcite . this is a very strong agn . the @ xmath10neiii @ xmath11 $ ] 15 . 56 / @ xmath10neii @ xmath11 $ ] 0 . 97 % is a measure of radiation field strength and the value of 0 . 97 is a weak radiation field strength compared to the agn ( the diagram of weedman et al . 2005 shows a ratio of @ xmath60 . 17 to 0 . 96 ) . the total electron density , calculated from the @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 15 . 56 / @ xmath10siii @ xmath11 $ ] 0 . 5 % of @ xmath60 . 17 , and @ xmath59 @ xmath57 @ xcite , is the electron - density estimate for this h @ xcite . the characteristics of the h @ xmath5 emission of ngc 7319 are similar to the two other emission lines found in sl - ll ( the latter is in the region dominated by ngc ) . as a result , the phase diagram shows only two lines and provides an incomplete description of the h @ xmath5 emission , since without the twothermal equilibrium to obtain information about the warm component , we are able to estimate the mass of the h @ xmath5 by drawing a straight line to the origin . any hotter component would contribute to the flux of the 0 - 1 ##co ( 1 ) component , leading to a decrease of the flux ( and increase of the @ xmath5 mass ) for the warm component . therefore , to provide the result , we calculate the mass of h @ xmath5 @ xmath96171 @ xmath97 ##10 ( assuming the system is in thermal equilibrium and it has ortho - h ##bedo of 0 . 1 ) and the _ h @ xmath5 mass of 3 . 6 @ xmath9810 @ xmath3m @ xmath4 . we consider this a lower bound to the total warm component if ( as is expected ) more than one component is present . li & xu ( 2000 ) calculated the _ h _ h _ mass of ngc 7319 based on @ xmath73co ( 0 - 1 ) mass of @ xmath88 ##3 . 6 @ xmath210 @ xmath99m @ xmath4 , a value ofonly slightly more than the actual h @ xmath5 mass . such a result is highly typical of the elliptical galaxies @ xcite . the high sh spectrum at the center of the group of sq , measured by @ xcite , has been reanalysed using the same software used for the satellite images ( ssc , # s17 ) and is shown as follows [ ref : ref ] . this has shown that the h @ xmath5 mass travels at a speed of 6360 ( @ xmath100100 ) , ##s @ xmath13 , between the velocity of the shock ( 6600 km @ xmath13 ) and the velocity of the shock ( 5700 km @ xmath13 ) . this is consistent with the amount of mass being released by the shock , as well as the acceleration caused by the high linewidth of the h @ xmath5 and the shock ( 860 km @ xmath13 ) . the high sh spectrum shows that with the same motion , the 11 . 3 pah emission is present , although weaker . this is consistent with what is seen in the satellite images that show the 11 . 3 pah emission due to thepah is measured at 6 . 6 and 6 . 7 . in this section we consider the x - ray emission in the three regions shown in figure [ 1 : ext ] . the reanalysis of the data is necessary to determine the energies and values for the x - ray emission in the three regions according to our data set . we use the xmm - based h - pn method ( * * ? ? ? * for the data ) to obtain the most accurate results . a transient background image was generated and compared with the event data , and then corrected of all errors . a 0 . 1 kev image was then generated and corrected for the errors . the light - source energies were mapped back to @ xmath101 in the case of transient ##s , and the background radiation energy was measured at the @ xmath102 arcmin @ xmath7 ##2 distance away from the galactic center . for the event in 6 . 2 , the background - radiation and flux ##es were mapped to 0 . 1 kev and 2 " ( 0 . 00110 kev ) x - ray , yielding an even - emission state of metallicity 0 . 1 k , with theas seen from the results of osullivan et al .
