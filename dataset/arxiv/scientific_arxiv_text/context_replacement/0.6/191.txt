understanding and modeling different aspects of the dynamics of open quantum systems is of great importance to physics , chemistry , and biology @ xcite . the non - classical behavior is one of the most important aspects of the open quantum system , and receives special attention @ xcite . the dynamics of open systems are described by the classical formal semigroup @ xcite , and are presented as an extension of the theory with some very different properties . however , several other models , which describe the non - classical behavior , are available @ xcite . based on the classical behavior in terms of the formal semigroup , _ _ et al . _ provided a model - based approach to describe the non - classical dynamics @ xcite . then , using the master model of the quantum information theory related to the concept of distinguishability of quantum information systems , smith , laine , and piilo ( blp ) provided a model of the behavior of non - classical dynamics based on the monotonicity of the wave function of state change @ xcite , as shown in fig . [ 2 : 1 ] . the blp non - markovianity has been widely adopted , and applied to many problems @ xcite . ( smith ,) proof of the information flow model for non - markovianity @ xcite . according to this model , the lack of distinguishability of the system of states reduces the information flow from the system to the system . if the flow is backward , the information flow is directed backward , represented by the green thin arrow . non - backward flows occur when there is forward information flow , represented by the red thin arrow , giving different distinguishability properties to the system . , [ = 226 ] . for all quantum systems , the non - uniform ##ity for quantum states is non - uniform , and even worse . first , the non - uniform measures from the information flow and the forward information flow are not uniform @ xcite . second , many other non - markovianity models , based on a property of the monotonicity of states in the quantum system , have been proposed @ xcite . third , even in the case of forward information flow , trace distance is not the only uniform measure for the distinguishability of quantum states . the trace distances in the case of differential equations can be found in ref . @ xcite , and the trace distance @ xcite is a commonly - used measure . these measures should also be used toconsider the following non - linear transformation . the difference among the non - markovianity and the physical properties . in this way , we show that the blp non - markovianity does not imply the local non - purity of quantum states , nor the non - unital nature of the measure . besides non - markovianity , ` ` non - unitality ' ' is another important physical measure , which is the measure for the increasing of the purity @ xmath0 under local channels @ xcite and for the decreasing of the purity of n - qubit ##s under local quantum channels @ xcite . in the same case of blp non - markovianity , we provide a measure on the non - unitality . since blp non - markovianity is the most commonly used measure for non - markovianity , we also provide a measure on the non - unital non - markovianity , which can be easily used as a complement to the blp measure , when the quantum process is non - unital . we also provide an example to illustrate the extreme case , where the blp non - markovianity holds when the quantum process is not fast enough .this paper is summarized as follows . in sec . [ sec ] , we give a comprehensive description of the set of density operators and quantum channels with hermitian orthonormal operator basis , and some results on non - markovianity . in sec . [ sec : non - unital - analysis ] , we define the non - unitality and the non - unital non - markovianity and define the corresponding probability measure on . in sec . [ sec : example ] , we apply the non - unital non - markovianity theorem to the set of quantum channels , which is obtained from the corresponding quantum wave function . then [ sec : example ] is the result . the state of a quantum system can be represented by the density matrix @ xmath1 , which is positive semidefinite and of rank 2 . quantum systems , like quantum channels , have only continuous and order - preserving ( cpt ) maps from density operators to density matrices , and can be represented by kraus matrices , choi - jamiokowski matrices , and density operators @ xcite . in this paper , we use the hermitian operator basis to define , and for quantum channels . let @ xmath2 be the complete set of hermitian and orthonorma##l ##n are the operators @ xmath3 , i . e . , @ xmath4 , @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 . the operator @ xmath7 through @ xmath3 can be fixed by the substitution of @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 with @ xmath10 . then @ xmath11 is invariant if @ xmath7 is hermitian . in the limit , the quantum channel @ xmath12 can be fixed by @ xmath13 $ ] via @ xmath14 = [ ( \ mathcal { x } ) ^ ( \ } ) \ , { 0 : 1 } , \ ] ] where @ xmath15 is an @ xmath16 real number with the entries @ xmath17 . , we can also use that @ xmath18 for the density of quantum channels . then @ xmath19 represents the linear operator @ xmath20 . fits into the density of the quantum channels , i . e . , @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 can be fixed by @ xmath23 for the density of @ xmath1 . then @ xmat##h24 with @ xmath25 the density matrix . in such a case , @ xmath4 for @ xmath26 is traceless and represent the vector @ xmath27 . this new parametrization @ xmath28 for density operators is also called generalized coherent matrix , or generalized coherent matrix @ xcite . in order to determine the root of unity for the matrix @ xmath22 , we use the vector @ xmath29 . thus , the density operator @ xmath1 can be written as @ xmath30 with @ xmath31 the generalized coherent vector and @ xmath32 with @ xmath33 . using this construction , quantum mechanics can be represented by the linear combination @ xcite @ xmath34 where @ xmath35 is a density matrix with the entries @ xmath36 and the entries of the matrix @ xmath37 . @ xmath38 _ { \ mu } = \ left \ langle \ sum _ { \ mu } , \ mathcal { d } ( \ openone ) \ right \ rangle / [ , \ ] ] for @ xmath26 . in ##f . ( [ 1 : 2 ]) with and . ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) , one could prove that @ xmath39 _ { \ , \ , } , \ ] ] for @ xmath40 . \ , @ xmath15 can be divided into the following sub - blocks : @ xmath41 . \ ] ] given that a quantum channel @ xmath42 is said to be unital if and only if @ xmath43 @ xcite , one could prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for a unital channel is that @ xmath44 , \ , @ xmath45 = , @ xmath37 has the non - unital form of the quantum channel @ xmath42 . the necessary and sufficient condition above could be easily proved by showing that the block form of @ xmath46 is block vector , i . e . , @ xmath47 . based on the sub - block form of @ xmath15 , @ xmath44 is equivalent to that @ xmath15 is block vector , i . e . , @ xmath48 . whether a quantum channel @ xmath42 is cp ##t ( cp ) can be determined using the choi - jamio##kowski : @ xcite @ xmath49 where @ xmath50 is the first elementary particle . then @ xmath51 is a point in phase space . @ xmath42 is cp if and only if the choi - jamiokowski matrix is cp . with the hermitian linear transformation , @ xmath52 is an @ xmath16 matrix and can be written in the form @ xcite @ xmath53 putting this matrix into p . ( [ e : c ] ) and into q . ( [ e : d ] ) , we could write the choi - jamiokowski matrix into @ xmath54 if @ xmath42 is unital , it can be written into @ xmath55 without the problem of interactions between the open system and its neighbors in the initial state , the energy term for the open system from @ xmath56 to [ @ xmath57 can be written as @ xmath58 , \ ] ] which is a quantum number . this means that @ xmath59 is cpt . the differential of @ xmath60 is the time evolution of the open system , and @ xmath61 is the initial state ofthe following . a quantum process @ xmath62 is said to be time independent , also known as time - independent or time - independent process , if it has the following composition : @ xcite @ xmath63 for the @ xmath64 , where @ xmath65 is both strictly positive and order 2 . various measures on the degree of the non - marko ##ity of quantum processes have been proposed and studied @ xcite . almost all of the measures on the non - markovianity can be divided into two categories , depending on the definition of the degree of the following composition given by the description of the process : \ ( 1 ) monotonicity of the @ xmath66 under cpt maps . that is @ xmath67 for the quantum process @ xmath42 , where @ xmath68 is the effective statistical entropy under cpt maps . the measures of statistical distances @ xcite , including shannon distance , spectral distance , spectral distance , statistical distance , and , ( although this itself is not statistical distance , it can be used to measure statistical probability ) and so on . the measures of non - markovianitythe decreasing of the trace distance during the two dynamic maps @ xmath65 has been defined and discussed in ref . @ xcite . the first definition of this matrix , which would be discussed later in this article , was first given by smith , laine , and piilo in ref . @ xcite , based on the monotonicity of trace distances @ xcite @ xmath69 where @ xmath70 . for the increasing of the trace distance during the time interval when the information flows from the system environment to the environment , the definition of the blp non - markovianity is given by @ xmath71 where @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 for @ xmath74 are the dynamic maps . \ ( - ) definition of the choi - jamiokowski matrix for cpt maps . the choi - jamiokowski matrix @ xmath75 if and only if @ xmath42 is a random map , then , @ xmath42 is a cpt map . other definitions of non - markovianity : the definition of the choi - jamiokowski matrix for the dynamic maps @ xmath65haveis given and discussed in ref . @ xcite . in this case we would use one of these methods , which was introduced by rivas , huelga and plenio ( rhp ) in 2002 . they combine the form of the choi - jamiokowski matrix @ xmath76 for the local quantum channel with the form @ xmath77 where @ xmath78 \ ( 1 ) monotonicity of matrix @ xmath79 for local quantum channel . that is @ xmath80 \ leq [ ( \ alpha ^ { 2 } ) $ ] for the local quantum channel @ xmath42 , where @ xmath79 is an appropriate measure for the information of the quantum network @ xmath81 , the mutual information and the local information . the same results for non - markovianity are given and discussed in ref . the non - markovianity matrix @ xmath82 is used to describe the non - linear ##ity of the unital aspect of the system . as for the non - unital aspects , it is not linear . to do this , we use the hermitian orthonormal .used to compare classical and quantum systems . in fig . ( [ 1 : aligned ] ) , the trace distance between the states @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 is given by @ xmath85 \ cdot \ begin { \ lambda } \ big | . \ begin { aligned } \ ] ] and , for the two evolving states , we have @ xmath86 \ cdot \ begin { \ lambda } \ big | , \ end { 1 : aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath83 , @ xmath84 are the states of the channel . from this , we can see that the trace distance between the two evolving states is equal to the non - unital state @ xmath87 of the above series . even if there are two quantum channels , whose trace distances are @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 , then , the difference of trace distance between the evolving states from the two evolving states does not reveal these quantum channels . more precisely , @ xmath87 can reveal the non - existence of the quantum channels @ xmath90 , and this can also be revealed by @ xmath##82 . on the other hand , the non - unital property @ xmath87 has its own special meaning : @ xmath91 is responsible for the loss of the property @ xmath92 @ xcite . in other words , @ xmath93 is the non - classical aspect , the non - unitality is another kind of special ##ity of quantum processes . in addition to the concept of blp non - markovianity , we define the following quantity : the measure of the non - unitality of a quantum process : @ xmath94 } { \ mathrm { d } t } \ , | \ mathrm { d } t , \ ] ] where @ xmath95 is the ground state . therefore , @ xmath96 holds if @ xmath97 . since the non - unital aspect of the process , which is not affected by the wave function , has its own meaning , we want to minimize the effect of non - unitality on non - classical aspects . therefore , a strong separation of the non - unital aspect from the underlying non - markovianity may be necessary . if we have a strong separation @ xmat##h98 for the non - unital non - markovianity to satisfy the following two conditions : ( i ) @ xmath99 vanish if @ xmath90 is infinitely small , ( ii ) @ xmath99 vanish if @ xmath90 is unital , ( iii ) @ xmath100 should be equal to @ xmath87 . based on these conditions , we construct the quantum channel @ xmath101 where @ xmath102 with @ xmath103 is the set of the quantum states which arise from the maximal mixed state , and @ xmath104 , \ ] ] with @ xmath68 the infinite set which will be shown below . the following result is obtained if we assume that @ xmath66 is sufficient for the cpt function , i . e . , @ xmath105 \ leq [ ( \ delta _ { 1 } , \ delta _ { 2 } ) $ ] for the quantum channel @ xmath42 . for the unital transfer function , the channel @ xmath106 ##8 is the maximal mixed state , and the quantum channel @ xmat##h100 } , and the second condition is true . the third condition is the distance function . in this case , we use the following distance which is denoted as @ xmath107 } , \ ] ] where @ xmath108 is the uhlmann fidelity @ xcite for @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 . the following distance is the true distance for @ xmath100 because it preserves the monotonicity of cpt for @ xcite and is equal to @ xmath87 . but if only the monotonicity of cp is preserved , for example , we can also assume the value of the above distance is exactly the absolute value of unlmann fidelity for a simple version of ` ` ` ` ' ' @ xcite . quantum relative entropy @ xcite @ xmath110 $ ] , for a simple version @ xmath111 , is a possible value for the distance . note that when the support of @ xmath83 is not exactly the support of @ xmath84 , then , @ xmath112 , @ xmath113 will have different , and in both cases , different relative entropy .leads us to the definition of non - markovianity . indeed , hellinger distance @ xcite is invariant . although both of these measures are invariant under cpt transformations , they do have equivalent definitions in the quantum case , see fig . @ xcite . the difference between non - unital non - mixed measures given in fig . ( [ 1 : t _ 1 ] ) and the blp - type measures , and those which have more equivalent definitions , is the restriction of the pair of initial states . unlike with the blp - type measure based on the pair of initial states , the non - unital non - markovianity measure only depends on the set consisting of the original quantum system and the initial state . on one hand , this restriction makes the non - unital non - markovianity measure invariant when the wiener processes are unital , no longer they are mixed or non - mixed ; on the other hand , this restriction means that non - unital non - markovianity measure is only a measure of information about the non - mixed state . to define the non - unital non - mixed measure , we give an example of this form . we use the generalized adaptive correlation measure ( gadc )as a way to construct a quantum channel . the gadc can be constructed by @ xmath114 with the kraus operator @ xmath115 and by @ xcite @ xmath116 where @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 are the operators . note that for [ @ xmath119 $ ] and [ @ xmath120 $ ] , the parameter @ xmath42 is the quantum channel . for a one - dimensional system , the hermitian orthonormal matrix basis can be given by @ xmath121 , where @ xmath122 is the basis of the system . with the notation of 1 . ( [ x : 1 ] ) , the linear map for the quantum system is given by @ xmath123 @ xcite , where @ xmath124 the gadc is unital if and only if @ xmath125 , @ xmath126 . when @ xmath126 , @ xmath127 , the map is linear . the following model can be constructed by setting the operators @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 to zero .for time @ xmath128 . for this , we use @ xmath129 and @ xmath130 , where @ xmath131 is a unique quantum number . this is a unique quantum process , because @ xmath90 is a quantum number for time @ xmath57 , and @ xmath132 is the identity channel . now , let us use the @ xmath82 for this quantum process . for the two quantum numbers @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 , we have the following : @ xmath133 & = \ frac { 1 } { t } \ mathrm { tr } \ right | m ( \ mathcal { e } _ { t } ) [ \ mathbf { r } ( \ sigma _ { 1 } ) - \ mathbf { r } ( \ sigma _ { t } ) ] \ cdot \ frac { \ begin { \ sigma } } { \ sqrt { 1 } } \ right | \ nonumber \ \ & = \ frac { 1 } { \ sqrt { 1 } } \ right | m ( \ mathcal { e } _ { t } ) [ \mathbf { r } ( \ lim _ { 2 } ) - \ mathbf { r } ( \ lim _ { 2 } ) ] \ | | , \ end { 0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath134 is the total product of the numbers @ xmath31 , and we have the formula @ xmath135 for real numbers . dividing @ xmath136 by @ xmath137 , we have @ xmath138 = \ frac { x ^ { - 1 / 2 } } { \ sqrt { x } } \ sqrt { x ^ { 2 } + e ^ { 2 } + e ^ { - 1 } x ^ { 2 } } , \ left { x : gadc _ tr _ 0 } \ ] ] which gives @ xmath139 \ leq0 $ ] for any integer , @ xmath57 and for all real numbers @ xmath140 , @ xmath141 , and @ xmath142 . finally , the blp ##h - markovianity holds , i . e . , @ xmath143 , although @ xmath90 may be an infinitesi##mal ##c , which will be available . . ( available . ) ( a ) computation of the length and the distance between the successive states of the two - dimensional manifold under the corresponding time - dependent conditions , starting from the maximal mixed state @ xmath144 and the initial states @ xmath145 , respectively .

[ fig : x _ dtr ] ( 1 ) , we can see that although the trace distance between the two points @ xmath156 and @ xmath157 $ increases with the time @ xmath128 , the trace distance increases during the same time interval . from ex . ( [ fig : gadc _ nonunital ] ) , we can see although @ xmath158 $ ] depends on @ xmath159 , it does not depend on @ xmath16##0 . therefore , from fig . ( [ fig : gadc _ tr _ t ] ) we could see that for any two evolving states , the trace distance between the two states is dependent on @ xmath160 . in this way , the blp ##h - markovianity treats the family of quantum systems , which all evolve with @ xmath161 , as the same system . however , @ xmath100 knows the dependence of @ xmath161 on the trace self - similarity and is capable of ignoring it . in order to comply with bhp measure , we can compute the @ xmath146 function by fig . ( [ fig : gt ] ) . we compute @ xmath162 \ ] ] with @ xmath163 the quantum mechanical systems @ xmath164 with and @ xmath165 are also gauge invariant when @ xmath166 . from fig . [ fig : t _ dtr ] ( 2 ) , we can see that the vanishing of the bhp measure occurs in the case where @ xmath166 , which agrees with the monotonicity of trace distance under cpt transformation .in addition , we have shown that the test for non - markovianity based on # ##ability does not reflect the quantum non - locality implied by the non - unital nature of the system . in order to study properties of the non - unitality , we have defined a measure on the non - unital non - markovianity , and have defined a measure on the non - unitality , in the same way as blp non - markovianity does . besides non - markovianity , the non - unitality is an important feature of the quantum system . with the advent of new technologies , we developed new computational methods for studying quantum systems . it is hoped that new quantum computational methods would help us to study the computational properties of quantum systems . we hope this work will bring attention to properties of quantum systems from the computational perspective . this project was funded by nfrpc through grant no . 2012cb921602 , the nsfc through grant no . 11025527 and no . 10935010 and national research council and ministry of science , respectively ( grant no . number : 1 - 710 - 000 - 008 - 271 ) . j . c . chen , quantum systems & a quantum tour , in :/ / www - m5 . ma . tu . de / foswiki / pub / m5 / allgemeines / michaelwolf / qchannellecture . pdf [ http : / / www - m5 . ma . tu . de / foswiki / pub / m5 / allgemeines / michaelwolf / qchannellecture . pdf ]
