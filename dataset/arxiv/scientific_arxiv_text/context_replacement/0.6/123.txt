it is generally believed that most stars form in situ within clusters , although the structure of the star - forming clusters , including the details of their physical properties , is the subject of ongoing research ( see , e . g . , the structure of * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? ) addition , in recent years , a number of physical properties of the clusters have been discovered that would require more extensive theoretical study , such as : i ) the existence of a spatial scale in the clusters , with the most massive stars being closest to the cluster - center @ xcite ; ii ) the pattern of protostellar dust , which appears to have a spatial scale @ xcite ; iii ) the possible existence of an age distribution in clusters , with the oldest stars being found in the low - mass clusters @ xcite ; iv ) the mass distribution of the stars in the cluster of matter . numerical simulations have appeared to provide some information about these properties . @ xcite has shown , from a series of simulations of self - organizing , diffuse stellar clusters , that the most massive stars form in situ at the cluster center , rather than ` ` forming ' ' them by gravitational interaction with the cluster itself . however , they have noand reasons as to why the most massive stars should be formed . more recently , @ xcite has shown , by combining multi - dimensional spectra of star clusters with numerical simulations , that stars form from mergers of ` ` subcluster ' ' stars , although currently no explanation of why such mergers should occur is available . observationally , the existence of stars of many different types within the cluster has also been pointed out by @ xcite . a theoretical model capable of providing a plausible explanation to these observations is that of rapid , diffuse molecular cloud formation , given below . the research results suggest that , if molecular clouds ( mc ) are formed by large - scale , streams of hot , charged particles that quickly settle into the cold gas phase , then they rapidly become semi - liquid and begin to collapse rapidly . furthermore , the turbulence generated by the collapse of the streams produces a nonlinear instability ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) in the gas phase , which produces a multi - dimensional pattern of density fluctuations , where small - scale , low - amplitude ( ssla ) density fluctuations are dependent on large - scale , medium - amplitude ( lssa ) fluctuations . since these density fluctuations are nonlinear , thethe ssla stars have shorter free - fall times than the lssa stars , thus facilitating their collapse process . this process is very similar to @ xcite collapse , except that the turbulent fluctuations are of unknown magnitude and therefore unpredictable . in this sense , the process is very similar to the process of ` ` gravo - gravitational collapse ' ' , except that the process is _ _ _ being driven by gravity , and the turbulent fluctuations do not disappear completely , but instead they provide the basis for other , smaller , turbulent fluctuations as the system collapses into @ xcite . in what follows , we will refer to this intermediate stage between chaotic and gravoturbulent collapse as ` ` global gravitational collapse ' ' ( ghc ) . this model also assumes that the star formation rate ( sfr ) of stars increases ( very slowly ) over time , as a result of the increase of the mass fraction of the stars as they go through their global collapse @ xcite . assuming that massive stars do not form until the sfr is high and that the population has reached up to 1000 stars , these massive stars form early in the collapse process , and when they do , they begin to destroy their host stars and their feedcak ( s , or##ising ##lass , ( ##f ) , and the sfr effect . @ xcite was a single - particle physics ( sph ) based simulation of star formation and evolution in the atmosphere of ghc that simulated the formation of filamentary clusters with dense gas . in that simulation , the clusters form star - like structures , in which gas flows from the surrounding star core to the cloud core where star formation occurs . when the clusters become sufficiently dense , convection occurs within them and the gas flows through them into the more dense clusters . this means that the clusters fill the surrounding clusters with a mixture of dust and gas . this type of convection was also observed ( although it was not observed ) in a computer simulation performed by using the gas diffusion model of the @ xcite that provided a detailed description of radiative convection and a solution to ( cluster dynamics ) . ] ( sps ) that involved using a power - law sp ##h law with a form similar to that of @ xcite . this implies that , similar to the case in the case of @ xcite , the clusters observed in the atmosphere of type ia , as well as their surrounding regions , are subject to internal convection , which accounts for the dynamicsof the time from their formation to the time when they formed their parent stars . there are several different models of cluster formation , based on variables such as their mass distribution function , the # ##s of the resulting stellar population and its evolution , and the number of collisions ; the effect of collisions on forming new clusters and on forming their parent clusters ; and the mass distribution and evolution of the clusters as a result of the atmospheric pressure present in the parent cluster @ xcite . in this case , however , we attempt to explain the process of formation and the evolution of the clusters as a result of ghc . to this end , we describe the cluster formation in the model @ laf1 , figure 1 , focusing on the initial spatial structure of the cluster . in sec . [ sec : data ] we first describe the initial model , and in sec . [ sec : data ] we describe the methods for determining the mass and its distribution , both in terms of the time of their formation as well as from their initial formation . finally , in sec . [ sec : data ] we describe our observations of the stars from clusters brought together in the ghc , as well as the spatial structure of the cluster . in sec . [ sec : data ] we describe thethink of our observations and compare them with previous observations , and in sec . [ sec : sf ] we get a correction and some corrections . the numerical model used in this paper differs from the one used in paper i with the n + / - 1 arc - model ( arc ) model of @ xcite . the main parameters used are self - assembly , parameterized heating and cooling ( sec . [ sec : hcrates ] ) , bubble formation with an average , fixed temperature ( sec . [ sec : sf ] ) , and the radiative compensation for the damage from large - scale electromagnetic fields ( sec . [ sec : sf ] ) . magnetic fields are used . for more details , we refer the work to paper i . the model involves the head - on collision of two sound streams in the same gas gas . the streams each have a diameter of 100 pc and a length 112 pc , and each is moving at a velocity of @ xmath0 . the numerical model ( and the data ) therefore have a mean density @ xmath1 and density @ xmath2 respectively , and an average velocity density of @ xmath3 . subsequently , the streams move with a reynolds number of 0 . 1 withdue to the acoustic waves in the # acoustic ##al ##bedo . the simulation has a base resolution of @ xmath4 grid cells , and allows for further resolution levels , with a base resolution up to @ xmath5 , with a base cell size of 0 . 0625 au , and @ xmath6 , 000 au . the simulation is based on the ` ` maximum mass ' ' criterion , meaning that the cell size is smaller when the resolution is @ xmath7 . this means that the minimum cell size @ xmath8 agrees with both @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 . once the maximum mass level is reached , no further work is required , and the cell - size can be made higher , because of the improved sf factor ( sec . [ sec : sf ] ) . note that this _ - _ - mass _ criterion does not apply to the so - called _ _ _ _ @ xcite of increasing the cell size with at least 4 grid cells . those who worry that attempting to do this will result in large , systematic errors . however , we do not see this as cause for concern since , as will be seen in sec . [ sec: sf ] , our star formation model allows us to take the per - particle density function , and convert it to the @ xcite model . we consider heating ( @ xmath11 ) and cooling ( @ xmath12 ) . of the density @ xmath13 these values are equivalent to the standard heating and cooling processes performed in @ xcite , as shown in figure ( 1 ) of @ xcite , with the minor corrections made in @ xcite . with these heating and cooling processes , the gas is highly enriched in the density of @ xmath14 . no particle density is required , and instead the gas is assumed to be roughly spherical , with a constant mean density @ xmath15 . our model provides a simple star formation model in that , if the parent cell has a density of @ xmath16 , where is the density of , then an sp of fixed mass @ xmath17 will be created in the system with a time @ xmath18 the timestep of the mean ( particle ) density . if the sp is constant , it is independent of the fixed mass of the parent cell . the maximum mean density ( e . g . , * ? ? ? *; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , our sps do not form . however , since our model for sf is linear , when the highest possible temperature is reached in the gas , it immediately begins to accrete from the surrounding gas , and increases in temperature and pressure until the sp is fully formed in it . this implies that the formation is done in the gas itself , rather than onto the surface . serendipitously , it was reported in paper i that this model allows the sps to form with a power - law mass distribution , whose slope can be adjusted by adjusting the value of @ xmath18 , for a very high resolution . in paper ii it was reported that adjusting @ xmath19 to the resolution used in our model allows the sp power - law mass distribution to have an slope of @ xmath20 , thus being equal to the standard salpeter distribution . we set the minimum value for sp ##s at @ xmath21 , which corresponds to the sp value of @ xmath22 at the highest resolution used . therefore , the minimum for sp ##s is @ xmath23 . with this formula, the most likely sp ##s in this simulation is @ xmath24 . note , however , that our imposed limit is a simple power law , and that the most probable stellar mass is not the same . this means that we are on the low - mass ( @ xmath25 ) side of the imposed limit , meaning that we are missing about half of the total mass of stars , and that their stellar mass ( 2030 % of the total mass ) is incorporated only into the stars that have not appeared in the simulation . we discuss the implications of this in detail . [ 2 : 1 ] . our simulation also assumes sps that are individual stars ( in clusters of clusters ) , with a probability density well below the most probable stellar mass . this allows the dynamics of the sps to be completely independent of the actual stellar dynamics , compared to the case when the stellar masses correspond to those of the stars , of up to a few hudreds of stellar mass . in that case , low - mass stars may result from close encounters with the massive stars , and thus have very high energies . in our simulation , the net effect of the massive stars on the system is non - linear , and the large radiativethis functions to model the structure and dynamics of the hii region around the sp . as a first - order approximation , we assume a ` ` ` line - of - sight ' ' ( los ) particle , @ xmath26 in the hii region , with a radius equal to the absolute difference between the radius of the star surrounding the sp and that of the target cell . then , for the sp , we use the atomic radius @ xmath27 derived from the experimental data provided by @ xcite . we then assume the standard strmgrem particle , @ xmath28 , given by @ xmath29 where @ xmath30 @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 are the standard atomic radius . at each time step , we look for target cells for the sp star whose distances to us are greater than @ xmath28 . for any target cell that meets this criterion , we reduce the radius to @ xmath33 and turn to the detection mechanism . the target will remain cool during the entire lifetime of the target , which is shown by the expression @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 as shown in figure 1 , for stars more massive than @ xmat##h36 , this formula is a reference to the observed abundance of @ xcite , but for stars with masses greater than that , it reflects the fact that the length of the stellar - wind period is @ xmath37 myr , not that of mass . this also means that we are measuring the intensity of the winds and winds of high mass stars by the same process . since this is still only an approximation , we do not expect it to have much bearing on our results , since the main source of stellar wind in the core of gmcs is the positive feedback from the stars @ xcite . although somewhat controversial , this formula was tested in phase 2 against the simple mathematical formula for the abundance of @ xmath38 in the core region @ xcite and found to be about 90 % . this , we conclude , is correct , reflecting our interest in large - scale molecular cloud formation and the associated star formation at various stages of evolution , rather than just the physical properties of the individual stars . another important issue for the ongoing discussion is the assignment of stars to a new group or cluster . we now have our method of selection . observationally , the formation and formation process of the open clusters is still a complicated matter , but by the##biguities and clusters , since the clusters do not have well defined boundaries , formation of the clusters is difficult to detect , and cluster members can be difficult to identify . in our case , the location of the clusters in the universe is known , and this allows the classification of the clusters by place of origin . however , this method is unknown to science , which therefore must begin by first identifying the cluster as a low - brightness cluster , and then identifying its members , on a statistical basis , for comparison with other clusters at the observation points in the cluster @ xcite . on the other hand , in the simulations there are no ` ` background ' ' stars , but only stars from clusters located at several different points in the universe . for the purpose of identifying the cluster or stars by observation at early stages , we use the first - best - of - fit ( fof ) method @ xcite . this is useful at early stages , when the two groups of stars are well separated and the stars are easy to identify as members of a cluster that was formed at a specific time and place . also , note that , because of the complex nature of the cluster , and [ [ : : ] . ] the size and mass distribution of the individual clusters depends on the type ofthe so - called ` ` linking parameter ' ' applies to the stars . this parameter is a measure of the distance , to which groups have formed . in early times , the distance between stars was not observed by observation , and the linking parameter could easily be adjusted to match the observed distance . in later times , however , the groups increase their distance through gravitational interactions between their members , and consequently , groups tend to form in the same region , or on the same , making it necessary to accurately measure the distance , in order to determine their distance to the sun . we can determine the size of a group at any given time by performing an following process : firstly . for all the stars that were part of the group in the initial period , we take the distance from their center of mass to the most distant star . if this distance is less than half the distance from the center to the second most distant star , we take the distance to the most distant star as the radius of the group . secondly , we take the most distant star as the ` ` new star ' ' and take the radius of the group as the distance from the center to the second most distant star . finally , we consider the new stars ( those formed in the period of time since the group formation##hot and the hottest group ) to the one whose center of mass is closest to them . . . then , for the hot group , we recompute the center of mass , radius ( @ xmath39 ) , total mass ( @ xmath40 ) , and total number of stars ( @ xmath41 ) of the group . we then calculate the age of the group , @ xmath42 , and the time period since the time when the group was first formed . however , the groups often encounter each other ( as part of the large - scale simulations ) and then they merge . we assume that a new group is formed from the merger of two previous groups when the distance between their centers of mass is greater than the distance of the two groups . at that point , we expect that the two groups merge . in fact , we expect this merger to occur at different points in our universe , with stars in between separated from them , and so on , in a predictable and self - consistent manner . in this case , three new groups appear , two of which are sufficiently massive to burn through the neutral gas around them on the timescale @ xmath43 myr since the formation of the first group ( from @xmath44 myr to @ xmath45 myr ( the course of the simulation ) . clusters begin to form at @ xmath46 myr , and the first hii regions form at @ xmath47 myr . finally , at @ xmath48 myr , the molecular gas has been ejected from the region of @ xmath49 stars around the cluster . the [ ref : sim _ imgs ] describes the stage of the simulation , from @ xmath50 myr into the cluster , in which two hii regions , representing the two most massive clusters , can be formed , and the filamentary shape of the cloud is still present in both . the clusters themselves are located along the main filamentary axis of the cloud , and are @ xmath51 @ xmath52 . note also that the shape of the most massive cluster resembles the filamentary shape of its parent cluster , similar to , for example , the structure seen in the giant star cluster . this similarity in shape is not only to the filamentary shape , but also to the fact that the cloud has a high density of stars in the region . for a simple simulation we have to usesee the stucture and structure of these observed and predicted clusters . the key element of the ghc model is that the clusters are part of the large - scale cloud structure , pulling stars into the regions around them , as proposed by @ xcite in their theoretical models of cluster formation and collapse . furthermore , these models describe a series of collapses of the clouds , suggesting that _ small clusters , which contain many stars , and are forming stars _ , are themselves moving onto large - scale clouds _ , similar to the ` ` radiation belt ' ' model proposed by @ xcite for the gas giants in the giant molecular cloud . this is illustrated in fig . [ fig : imgs _ clus2 ] , which shows a series of collapses of the second most studied cluster ( namely , ` ` cluster 1 ' ' , shown in the upper right corner of the image ) among those shown in fig . [ fig : sim _ imgs ] , from @ xmath53 myr to @ xmath54 myr . from @ xmath55 18 . 05 to 19 . 05 myr it can be seen that other clusters have formed in the same region . from @ xmath56 myr, this second group is seen to have formed at a distance @ xmath57 pc from the first . by @ xmath58 myr , this second group is seen to have joined the first , formed at a distance @ xmath59 pc from it , and to have merged with it by @ xmath60 myr . also , at this time , a third cluster is seen to be forming in the # ##thest part of the loop , containing only one star at that time , although by @ xmath61 myr it already contains two stars ( possibly one ) . the effect of the merger is also worth noting . also by @ xmath58 myr , the section of the loop between the two clusters is seen to have completely collapsed , and the gas is being ejected from the loop of the first cluster . also , gas at the edge is seen to have left this side of the loop by @ xmath62 myr , although the other side of the loop is also seen to be in the process of collapse . finally , by @ xmath54 myr , the loop is seen to be in the process of collapse again .parts of the image . , [ image : imgs _ clus2b ] , show the various stages of the formation of this region . by @ xmath63 myr the gas is seen to have been dispersed up to diameter @ xmath64 pc , and by @ xmath65 myr , a large hii cluster , of diameter @ xmath66 pc has formed , although the pillar on the left retains some of the gas , and a smaller cluster has formed , the ` ` feeding ' ' that forms the base of the pillar . finally , within this filamentary pillar , yet another cluster is seen to have formed ( at the bottom right of the image ) . by @ xmath67 myr , some of the remaining gas has been removed from the pillar , and the region is seen to consist of four clusters , two of them completely devoid of gas ( ` ` feeding ' ' ) and two of them partially contained in their respective pillars . from the above image , it is clear that the clusters in this region were formed by means of a chemical reaction , by which they formed at very different places and times . as they developed into a large - scale growth region , _ _the same region with the dust and gas _ . in the next section we explain the details of this process . the early development of the ##ing is shown in fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] , which shows the relative sizes of the star clusters in the @ xmath68 cluster _ _ @ xmath69 , 21 . 40 , 22 . 40 , and 23 . 40 myr in the _ top left , top right , bottom left , and bottom right panels _ . in this way , stars begin to appear at @ xmath70 myr and beyond . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] shows that they are organized into a cluster in such a way that at @ xmath69 myr we see two clusters ( namely , groups 1 and 2 ; in the _ top right panel _ of fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] ) of what will eventually become a single , central cluster ( groups 1 - 2 ) . we use circular symbols to classify stars that belong to group 1 , and square symbols for stars belonging to group 2 . finally , we classify them according to their size as shown in the fig and we classify their size by the cluster number , with circular symbols .the symbols . the yellow and red circles represent the relative sizes of each star , just as shown in fig . [ sec : cluster ] , with the yellow circles representing the stars closest to the most distant star , and the red circles representing the distance to the second most distant star . in what follows , we define the distance to the second most distant star as the center of groups 1 - 2 , because the second most distant star is ` ` ` far away ' ' from the center . thus , we use larger symbols to represent more massive stars , and smaller symbols to represent lower - mass stars . however , even at these early stages , we can see that _ the more massive and distant stars appear to be at the center of the group _ . from fig . [ sec : cluster _ evol ] it is immediately evident that , at these early stages , the groups are undergoing expansion , and that the formation occurs between them . at @ xmath71 myr , the groups have different sizes , masses , and types of stars , and they have undergone a large enough expansion that their merger is imminent . the ` ` ` most distant ' ' member of group 2 is very far away from the center of the group . from our calculations , the merger occurs at @xmath72 myr , represents the new group 1 - 2 . we still use the triangles and square shapes to represent the old group and of the stars in the new group . these now represent stars born in the old group 1 - 2 . however , this new group represents stars that were born in very different times and places . for future reference , we need to show the evolution of this and other , smaller groups , using the 4 - d model around groups 1 - 2 , and then @ xmath73 myr , we will have a number of groups with different shapes , colors , and sizes ( _ bottom right panel _ of fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] ) . these groups move around in a straight line , because they are outside the cluster of the other stars . then , when these groups merge and absorb each other , they will become part of what we refer to as the new group itself , as shown in the _ bottom right panel _ of fig . [ fig : imgs _ clus2b ] , although the groups are still not known at that time ( @ xmath74 myr ) . as explained in the paper , an important feature of the ghc model is that thesfr of star - forming regions will increase in magnitude until the time when the stars begin to form and to leave their parent cloud @ xcite . the [ fig : sfr _ evol ] shows the increase of the sfr in groups 1 and 2 , as well as in the merged group 1 - 2 . unlike for group 2 , in whose parent cloud the sfr is very large and slowly decreasing , for groups 1 and 1 - 2 the increase of the sfr is slow . however , the sfr for the merged group 1 - 2 is much lower than the initial mass reached by group 1 before the merger , and the increase of the sfr only occurs for the stars of groups 1 and 2 respectively , before and after their merger . given that the stars will not appear in the system until the sfr is sufficiently large enough to bring the distance up to 2000 au , the increase of the sfr implies that the new stars should begin to form early in the formation of star - forming regions . this is shown in fig . [ fig : age - change ] , which shows the mass of the stars _ vs . _ their ages at @ xmath54 and @ xmath75 myr . at these times , it is also shown that theyoung stars have the highest mass , and that , as the age increases , the distribution of their masses changes to different scales . this is best illustrated in cf . [ sec : g _ n _ hist ] , which shows the relative mass distribution of groups 1 , 2 , and 2 - 3 at different scales . it is clear from this picture that the relative mass of the stars changes over time , even after groups 1 and 2 have formed . the ghc model assumes that the star - forming region is internally undergoing collapse while outside it is evolving into small - scale gas regions . however , since the small - scale regions are forming all on their own , this model in turn implies that the larger regions are producing more gas and stars ( cf . [ sec : cum _ evol ] ) from the smaller infalling regions . thus , the small - scale regions merge into the large - scale region , called g @ xcite . an important consequence of this ` ` fluid ' ' ( gas + stars ) infall is that the mass of stars forms a non - dissipative ` ` fluid ' ' that carries the kinetic energy of the infalling regions . therefore , the stars created _ by _ entering the large - scale transition zone should have avelocity variation refers to their velocity when they are infalling to the center of the mass - scale as well . in essence , this means that these stars should be much greater away from the center of the group 1 cluster that has undergone merger than the one observed _ in situ _ in this particular cluster , where the gas from which they derive their velocity variations has largely been exhausted and thus has absorbed most of the infall ##ing ##ress . the [ ref : ref _ table ] shows the age of the two clusters as a function of their distance to the center of mass of group 1 , @ xmath76 myr . it is believed that most of the young stars ( @ xmath77 , and in particular the ones with @ xmath78 myr ) , are located in the outer 0 . 5 pc of the cluster . this is also consistent with the fact that the young stars are densely packed in disk - like and filamentary star - like structures . however , at these distances ( @ xmath79 ##9 ) , there are older stars with @ xmath80 myr . these older stars are the ones that formed in groups 1 and 2 , prior to their merger . thiscan also be seen in the _ _ _ _ section of fig . [ fig : age _ evol ] , which shows that the stars more from the center of fig 1 - 2 are all represented by triangles and squares ( i . e . , formed prior to the merger ) and have yellow and orange symbols , with ages between 1 and 3 myr , while the stars more from the center have undergone @ xmath81 myr , as shown by their red - gold symbols . on the other hand , we can see in fig . [ fig : age _ profile ] that the outer 2 . 5 % of the cluster still contains many young stars , and in particular , the youngest one ( @ xmath82 2 . 5 myr ) . this suggests that some of the stars formed prior to the merger have already undergone @ xmath83 - like interactions with the older stars in the cluster , and may have transferred their own dark matter to other stars in the cluster . this is possible because these young stars have lower mass , and that they are not affected by interactions with more older stars . also , as shown in fig . [ fig : sfr ] ( cf . [ fig : age - profile ] ) , the young stars inthey reach the limit of the sf , which in our case is about the maximum possible mass ( ex . ex . [ sec : sf ] ) . however , as stated in ex . [ sec : sf ] and [ sec : sfr ] , the theory of the ghc is that the sfr remains at each star - forming site until it begins to absorb the gas flowing onto it , at which point the sfr begins to decay rapidly , and eventually breaks down completely . using a semi - empirical model for the age of the stars and their sfr , @ xcite shows that this distribution of the sf at each star - forming site shows that the age distribution of the cluster within a few myr of star formation is dominated by a large peak of the young ( at @ xmath84 myr ) and a small peak of older ( 5 to 10 myr ) clusters , corresponding to the age distribution of the clusters in the cluster at @ xcite . the [ sec : x _ hist ] shows the age distribution of the clusters in groups 1 and 2 at close distances , and the clusters that form them , and merge to form clusters . at @ xmath85 myr ,the two clusters and their embedded groups are kept separate , and a diagram for each cluster is shown . at @ xmath86 myr , the two clusters and their embedded groups have completely merged , and thus a new cluster is formed . it is shown that , at this time , the most numerous stars are those less than 1 myr old . neverthless , there are still a few stars up to about 1 myr old . this indicates an increase of sf during the first @ xmath87 myr of formation of young stars . in subsequent years ( @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 myr ) , the number of young stars decreases , and the most numerous stars are those located at @ xmath90 myr . this indicates a decrease of the sfr at this time due to the presence of red giants within the cluster . the [ source : star _ diagram ] shows the spatial distribution of the stellar total mass at @ xmath54 myr . it can be seen that all but one of the clusters with , @ xmath91 , and the one with @ xmath92 are located at @ xmath93 au of the same distanceof the cluster . thus the star with @ xmath94 is located at @ xmath95 away from the cluster , ##nr of mass . however , an examination of the evolutionary tree shown in the satellite images of fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] indicates that this is a young star formed in , and separated from , group 1 before the merger . this star is represented by the red color circle , on the blue color circle in the _ bottom right _ _ [ @ xmath96 myr ] of fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] and on the bright blue circle in the _ bottom left _ [ @ xmath97 myr ] panel . therefore , this star is not ` ` formed in ' ' the cluster . therefore , the more young stars in group 1 - 2 _ formed _ in situ _ , as indicated by the triangular shape of their symbols in fig . [ fig : cluster _ evol ] . therefore , the more young stars are represented by symbols of red and blue color , and with triangular shape , indicating that those stars were young ( @ xmath98 myr ) , and formed _ in situ _ in the original group 1 - 2 . therefore , we assume that, except for the one that is ` ` passing through ' ' , the older stars that resulted from the merger of groups 1 and 2 to form groups 1 - 2 , despite being young and tightly packed at the molecular level . a result of the cluster as shown in fig . [ fig : mass _ profile ] and [ fig : velocity _ profile ] is that the cluster expands as it ages , increasing its size from @ xmath99 pc at @ xmath54 myr to @ xmath100 pc at @ xmath101 myr . the reason for this is not entirely clear . it may be due in part to the fact that the new material is beginning to be ejected from the cluster , as can be seen in fig . [ fig : imgs _ clus2 ] and [ fig : imgs _ clus2b ] , and in part to the fact that the mass profile of the young stars , apart from the old ssla stars that have migrated into the lssa region , corresponds to the large - scale as ##p , to that of the original star - forming region ( fig . [ fig : mass _ distr ] ) , allowing the cluster to grow to a size factor ofthis also reduces complexity . we first consider the hierarchical structure of the cluster itself , resulting from the lack of ghc of the central stars . figure [ 1 : hier _ clus ] shows the stars belonging to the cluster at coordinates @ xmath74 myr , identified as a group , and then individually identified using a best - of - three algorithm using two different values of the ` ` cluster parameter ' ' @ xmath102 , which determines how close stars are located in order to identify each group . we note that , using the smaller value of the parameter ( @ xmath103 , _ bottom left _ panel ) , the smaller groups are identified ( shown by the lower values ) , and using higher values ( @ xmath104 and above , _ bottom left _ and _ bottom right _ panel ) , groups 3 and 4 are identified , each group being slightly more massive . we also note that , using the larger value , @ xmath105 , a small group of less massive stars is ruled out , which is then identified as a group using higher values . these results suggest that the structure of the cluster , from the overall , hierarchical structure of the cluster , is ` ` ` hierarchical ' ' , consisting of thethe structure of clusters , is the structure of the molecular structure , which in turn is a result of a multi - scale , gravitational interaction . we will continue the discussion in the next section as follows . the basic model for understanding the physical properties of the clusters observed in the absence of ghc is that first proposed in @ xcite , namely that the clusters should form at points where the average sfr is high and that the data should be used to help determine cluster size . thus , the most massive stars in high - sfr clusters should be those at the center of the cluster . this is , of course , a simple theoretical model of the universe , and it does not explain the physical processes necessary for the formation of the cluster itself . however , it provides a basis for understanding the dynamics of the cluster . thus , under the assumption that clusters of different sizes are forming , as predicted by the ghc , at a given rate ( and therefore , a given free - fall time ) , more massive stars are likely to have higher sfrs , if the sfr is determined , to second order , by the ratio of the cluster size to the free - fall time . our interpretation of these ., similar to the general model used for the formation of a massive star . the time it takes for a particle to form , the more massive it will become , since the cell in which it forms continues to expand and becomes more massive , without further expansion , and so the particle forms with twice the mass of the cell . however , as shown in figure 1 of table 1 , the probability of being able to last very many years before forming a massive particle is very low , and therefore the probability of formation of a very massive star is also very low . therefore , our galaxy is likely to actually only have massive stars when the local sfr is very high , although there may be a few exceptions to this rule . thus , in the ghc model , the low - mass , medium - scale , larger - amplitude ( ssla ) star - forming sites should appear early in the formation of the star , because of their short free - fall times , while the high - mass , medium - scale , smaller - amplitude ( lssa ) sites should appear later . thus , the low - mass sites should be placed into the path of the local gravity instead of the high - mass sites . also , low - mass sites tend to appear at different times inthe clusters that contain the young stars until the end are formed by the stars . therefore , the low mass stars formed in the low - mass , infalling clusters form the star infall ##ing , and thus should have higher mass , than the stars formed in the higher , older clusters , which should have either low or high masses . the relationship results in a number of characteristics of the young cluster : 1 . the older stars tend to have lower masses . however , the opposite is not necessarily true : low - mass stars in clusters can be either young or old . this relationship is shown in the _ age _ panel of fig . [ fig : age - profile ] , which shows the age _ profile . _ the age of the stars in the cluster , between @ xmath97 and 10 . 5 myr . the older stars have lower masses ( fig . [ fig : age - profile ] , _ right _ side ) , and therefore , they will be found at greater distances from the original star - forming cluster ( fig . [ fig : age _ profile ] ) . the more massive stars formed later ( 10 million myr ) in the history of the cluster ##s , when thessla sites were used to form the lssa cluster . this is shown in the [ fig : stellar _ age _ hist ] , which shows the same estimated mass values for sites 1 and 2 , independently and simultaneously , at different times . as time progresses , the older parts of the cluster are expected to become older . 3 . the sfr decreases during the early stages of the cluster formation , until the time when young stars begin to form . during this time , the sfr decreases , and the gravitational radiation from the young stars begins to destroy the cluster and the filamentary gas supply . this is shown in the graph of the mass distribution , shown in fig . [ fig : age _ hist ] . the older stars are the strongest , since the sfr only decreases with age . however , with the appearance of young stars that either partially or completely replace the old stars and continue producing gas , the sfr decreases again , and so stars older than the age of the most massive stars should be more massive as well , as is shown in fig . [ fig : age _ hist ] . note that these figures apply to stars of only a few kilometers and masses of at least 1 billion myr, and that _ _ _ _ _ _ apply to the local and global star production of a massive star , for which our models do not predict whether the stars form first or last , or how long does it take to form a massive star . also , note that young star - forming regions typically consist of several low - mass , star - forming sites , and contain no large - scale stars themselves . this situation applies to regions where the various low - mass sites have not yet merged to form a single massive star . our theoretical models are also consistent with recent numerical data on the age and mass distribution of young stellar objects in star - forming regions . in particular , @ xcite ##s has demonstrated the existence of large variations in the relative ages of the young star - forming regions , so that the youngest young objects are located in the obscured regions of molecular clouds , middle - age objects are located in dusty regions , and the oldest objects are located in open clusters . this is qualitatively consistent with our observation that the oldest objects can be found at different distances from the cluster center , due to their radial velocity distribution , in turn due to their relative distance from it , and that their masses of the stars from their in##fall onto the more massive cloud . however , the objects emerging from the cloud lose this component of the gas , and these are replaced by much smaller velocites . furthermore , the radial velocity distribution of the massive stars predicted by the ghc model has been confirmed by @ xcite and the type ii stars . @ xcite proposed several possible scenarios that could contribute to the mass increase they proposed . of these , the scenario closest to the origin of star formation of ghc is their scenario b , since it has the mass of sf ##r predicted by @ xcite , which is consistent with our model @ xcite . however , the connection between ghc and scenario b of @ xcite is not clear , since they do not predict the introduction of new stars and matter onto the surface of the large - scale molecular cloud . in addition , @ xcite has shown that the galaxy complex known as the m17 galaxy cluster ( m17 swex ) appears to be without any known stars in comparison with the mass estimated from the model sfr . this complex consists of two large star - forming clusters , separated by distances of several kilometers from each other ( a . povich , satellite ) ; see also busquet et al . thisis consistent with the initial abundance of the clusters in our simulation , since very small , low - mass star - forming clusters can produce a very - small number of ysos that may have not yet fully become massive ##ly , because in the ghc scenario this only occurs after these two clusters have merged to form a larger cluster . this is also shown in fig . [ sec : low _ mass _ hist ] , which shows that the relative abundance of young stars increases over time , even after clusters 1 and 2 have merged . we conclude that the model of ghc is an accurate model for clusters that accurately describes the overall mass distribution and build - up rate of the cluster . as a further step we need to carry out a direct statistical comparison of the clusters in question that match the stars to their masses ( see fig . [ sec : mass ] ) and the relative abundance of the clusters . the current model is based on the simple assumption that our current cluster - selection process is the process leading to the formation of the cluster . that is , we model the process above as a random sampling process , and that the abundance of young stars is taken to mean that the probability of finding them is very low and more likely that the. . however , the fact that our model , using a certain formula for the density of stellar particles ( cf . cf . [ sec : sf ] ) , accurately models the physical properties of the stars , means that our theoretical model is quite correct . however , our star formation model does have some limitations . most importantly , as stated in cf . [ sec : sf ] , the minimmum stellar - particle density is @ xmath106 , which is near the limit of the average stellar density , and therefore we are missing stars on the low - mass side of the equation . our theoretical model is not a simple power law , that is the same for each mass . this means that we are missing a large number of low - mass stars , about half of the total number of stars . their mass , @ xmath107 of the same mass for b @ xcite # , and @ xmath108 for c @ xcite ##f , is then transformed into the stars that actually formed in the simulation , with from @ xmath106 to @ xmath109 . this does affect the density of the stars observed in the simulation , although not by much , sincethe young clusters are low mass , and are not expected to affect the structure of the high - mass clouds very much , even if the tend to have a more homogeneous structure . the fact that the structure of our simulations matches that of the young clusters reinforces this assumption . we also need to improve our cloud formation models in order to obtain a more accurate star - like mass distribution , and with this carry out a more direct and accurate comparison with stars . second , we hope that our simulation gives an accurate new look to the process of cloud assembly , revealing the essential elements of the internal structure of these clouds . the limitations of our simulation are that it does not include magnetic fields nor any form of heating other than internal heating , in particular nuclear ( nuclear ) explosions . the presence of magnetic fields should not be necessary , since our current understanding is that clouds are generally very unstable , and that the magnetic field is in general insufficient to protect them against their own anti - gravity , and that they lead directly to their formation . the absence of nuclear explosions is also considered important because of two main reasons . first , it is now widely accepted that nuclear explosions need to occur within the cloud in order to produce large amounts of energyfrom the clouds @ xcite , although on the other hand , the sne that form in low - temperature regions experience energy losses that prevent their interaction with the clouds @ xcite . thus , pre - existing material is insufficient to allow blastwaves to travel back into the clouds @ xcite . finally , and most importantly , our model assumes that the formation of the clusters is occurring only during the early stages ( about 10 myr ) of the stellar evoloution , during which little or no sne is expected to occur , even if new stars form later in the formation of the clusters , as predicted by the ghc model . thus , the thermal radiation used in our model is not the most effective form of feedback for controlling the gas flow onto the clusters where the new stars are formed . however , our model solution ( cf . [ 2 : 1 ] ) is of very simplicity , solving the radiative transfer equation in an exact manner . although it is shown in figure 2 that the solution of the hii model with this equation can solve the gas - density feedback problem very well , it is clear that our model ignores amounts of gas that should be released from the clusters , since it does not take into account the .of the intervening materials is the neutron source and the material to which the beam of the light is being applied . thus , our model can significantly reduce the absorption rate of water in regions containing the columns . however , since the columns themselves are thicker than the surrounding material , and their density significantly exceeds that of the cells and columns , their energy losses for regions where the light is associated with the incident radiation and with the surrounding material ( as in the case of channels in the same channel where the illuminating light is ) will be equal to or even greater than that of the surrounding material . therefore , the damage caused by this process is likely to be of great concern . thus , figure 1 . figure 1 shows the mechanical relaxation of columns of water in a way that prevents the formation of ` ` columns ' ' , and other complex structures in the hii model , corresponding to structures like the ` ` columns of water ' ' and giant cells , respectively . on the other hand , our theoretical model allows the process to run orders of magnitude faster than if the radiative relaxation were done in practice . we .note that our model is a very useful model for the study of the formation of galaxy clusters . in this case , we have described the process of formation of the cluster using a mathematical model of its formation and collapse by potential flow . the process occurs in a hierarchical fashion as a result of the chaotic nature of the formation of the central cluster @ xcite . the cluster formation process consists of small - scale , small - amplitude ( ssla ) collapses ( involving small scale masses ) and large - scale , medium - amplitude ( lssa ) collapses ( involving large masses , which are spread out over different spatial scales ) . collapse at large scales involves collapsing onto the surface of the potential flow ( the ' ` ` trough ' ' ) . the large - scale collapses involve the formation of filamentary flows that carry material from the initial large - scale cluster back to the collapse center , and the small - scale collapse can ` ` depend ' ' on these small - scale filamentary flows @ xcite , in a ` ` radiation free ' ' system @ xcite . because the small - scale clusters are collapsing at first ( due to their smaller sizes , which have shorter free - fall times ) , they can follow the large - scale collapseare also containing gas in addition to rocky material . this mechanism also implies that the star - forming sites form from the collision of smaller - scale star - forming sites , which bring fresh material and gas to the larger sites , and that these smaller - scale sites are a mixture of newly formed stars and stars that form at a remote , smaller - scale site and that are brought to the larger - scale site by the infalling site . however , the stars that form at the smaller - scale , distant sites have an infall velocity similar to the larger - scale as well . thus , stars formed during the initial phase of the larger - scale site , formed from material that has already been compressed upon their arrival there , and so they form with a much higher velocity now . however , this mechanism also implies that the sfr will increase with mass during early stages of formation , and then decrease again when the massive stars begin to reach their larger sites @ xcite . this interpretation of the sf process , combined with the p - type interpretation of the velocity as a co - expansion of stellar mass , implies that massive stars are only expected to form when the sfr is high enough to increase the mass to critical mass . therefore , massive stars should form early in the sfof the total number of star - forming sites , only the low - mass sites have merged to form a high - mass , high - sfr cluster . from these observations , we have concluded that a cluster that has emerged from the gravitational collapse of its parent cluster will have the following characteristics : * the oldest stars tend to be lower mass , because they form in the low - mass region involved in the formation of the cluster . however , younger stars can be either low - or high mass , because they form in the high - mass region created by the merger of the low - mass regions . * the older stars tend to have higher mass components , because they are affected by the infall ##ing of the cluster onto the high - mass collapse center . however , this material tends to be carried away by the stellar winds as the cluster collapses . * as a result , older stars tend to form at greater distances from the collapse center ( the core ) . * the more massive stars tend to be younger , because they only form when the sfr of the parent cluster has increased enough to reach the high - mass region of the cluster . * as a result , the low - and high - mass stars that have already undergone the collapse process will be defficientfor the low - mass stars . * because of the high sfr , most stars are young , although a small number may be as old as 10 myr . these observations are in perfect statistical agreement with the properties of young clusters , which tend to have a spiral structure , have an age distribution , and that the young stars tend to be farther from the cluster than @ xcite and to have higher masses @ xcite . however , the model suggests that groups of stars in different stages of formation would be defficient for young stars compared to the groups to be their initial stellar cores , as predicted by @ xcite . we believe that the model of ghc provides a complete picture of the evolution of young clusters , in terms of the multi - phase evolution of their molecular structure . e . g . - dr . - - to have some conversations with robert povich about the statistical properties of young clusters . * funded by uc - mexus foundation .
