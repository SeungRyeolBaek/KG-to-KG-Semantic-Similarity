narrow - band seyfert # ##s ( nls1s ) are a small and rare class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . they have strong radio balmer emission ( [ fwhm ( ) @ xmath0 ) @ xmath1 2000 ] ( @ xmath2 , ) [ ] @ xmath35007 ] ( [ ] / h @ xmath4 ) , strong optical , and weak x - ray emission @ xcite . nls1s have a radio - loud / radio - soft bimodality @ xcite . the @ xmath5 of nls1s are radio - loud . @ xcite . the range is much smaller than that found in qsos . the radio - loud nls1s ( rl - nls1s , @ xmath6 ) are also much smaller ( @ xmath7 ) @ xcite , where the spectral range @ xmath8 is roughly defined as the spectral ratio of radio to light . @ xmath9 @ xcite . so far , it is still a mystery why rl - nls1s are so rare . at present , the range of rl - nls1s isis still poorly understood . a few attempts have been made in the last few years to determine the nature of rl - nls1s . li et al . ( 2008 ) found that the emission spectra of the rl - nls1s were similar to those of high - energy - level bl # ##s , and suggested that some of them may be bl # ##s themselves . based upon the radio observations made by _ _ , the rl - nls1s have a strong x - ray emission indicating the presence of radio jets in the line of sight @ xcite . the presence of the radio jets leads researchers to look for intranight ##ly emission of the rl - nls1s , because of the well - known beaming effect ( e . g . , li & witzel 1995 ) . @ xcite indicates that sdssj094857 . 0 + 002225 is the best candidate for detection for rl - nls1s with beaming effect . the result is a highly radio - sensitive nls1 ##s @ xmath10 . the measured electron flux ##es from the radio emissions at 10 k is from 194 to 1982 @ xcite . it is believed the source ofand a flat - spectral radio source @ xcite . the radio observations made by @ _ swift _ and _ swift _ 2 indicate that the optical band frequency distribution is similar to those of flat - spectral radio sources @ xcite . the observations from the # ##line in no . 2 are @ xmath11 and @ xcite . both surveys revealed multi - wavelength variations in the object at timescales from day to night . the radio observations confirmed the variability in the optical band at the timescale from days to months @ xcite . @ xcite also indicates that the object shows long - term variability in both the radio and optical bands . the amplitude of the variation in the spectrum will be @ xmath12 for a decade . the long - term variation observed will be around 1 % in the radio band . the latest multi - wavelength survey carried out by @ xcite confirmed the spectral variation at different timescales . the optical variations in the x - band and also at night were also confirmed by the instrument . in this article , we have the optical data for the rl - nls1 sdssj094857 . 1 + 002225 . the instrument is designed to allow for intra##night time emission ( inov ) from the object . the inov should be positive if the object also has a dust cloud heading toward the earth . our observations were carried out at the xinglong observatory of national astronomical center , chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) , using the 35 cm schmidt telescope . the telescope has a cassegrain mount with an @ xmath13 camera . a liquid - cooled @ va1300b 1300 @ xmath141340 ln ccd is used as the detector that measures @ xmath1511 arcmin @ xmath16 of the object . each frame of the ccd corresponds to @ xmath170 . 5 electrons @ xmath16 . 5 and the resolution of the ccd is 1 . 5 times adu @ xmath18 and 4 electrons , respectively . the _ _ _ _ _ - and _ _ _ - _ _ were used for the observations . we observed the object on four consecutive nights in 2009 . they were february 28 , march 4 , 28 , and april 2426 , and above . the average observation time is 600 seconds for each frame . the observation for this object will take as long as possible for each frame. the resulting flat - field measurements in the _ b _ and _ c _ passbands are taken before and after the detector , during the same period . dark frames are not used because the brightness of the object is so low ( @ xmath19c ) that the dark frame can be easily ignored . the apparent brightness is preliminarily determined by the calculation performed by iraf software , using radar and flat - field measurements . several different reference stars are used from the resulting ccd image to determine the light intensity . because the comparison stars are brighter than the object , several other stars with brightness similar to the object are used to correct the error in calculation . the apparent brightness of the object and of those other stars is calculated using the apphot program . the best result is obtained because the object is a star - like object without stellar activity . in this case , the fwhm of the object is identical with those of the other stars . the mean brightness , instead of the mean fwhm of the other stars is also used in our calculation . . the results given above are based on these measurements . our study can be divided into two periods . both of them last about a decade . the object is then observed on the basis of2009 february 28 , march 1 , march 8 , april 12 , and april 15 . ( the reference stars on the x - rays of night 1 were 3345 , 3347 , 3351 , 3402 , and 3405 , respectively . ) there were no and only minor variations from the previous nights because of the cold weather . the relative brightness of the comparison stars was calculated from the data derived from lupton ( 2005 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data was used . thus the relative brightness of the stars can be calculated from the observed brightness data . the light curves of the object are shown in figure 1 . the first two light curves show the brightness of the object in the _ b _ ( by yellow solid squares ) and _ c _ ( by red solid squares ) directions . the relative brightness of the comparison stars was plotted from the bottom to top up . the amplitude of the comparison stars was no greater than 0 . 05 mag . the error points overplotted in the light curves were calculated from the two error points with amplitude equal to that of the object . in addition to the long - term variation with amplitude of 1 mag , the three light curves show that there were two nights during which the inov could be clearly seen in theand in both the _ b _ and _ r _ bands . the variations in these bands are similar to each other . the magnitude of the observed variations is so small that the long - term effect was relatively large on 2009 march 1 , 5 , and april 25 . in addition , the weather was relatively good on 2009 march 1 and april 25 , which results in relatively small error bars . for example , the smallest error bars on april 25 were 0 . 05 mag and 0 . 02 mag in the _ b _ and _ r _ bands , respectively . the brightness of the star was only 0 . 01 . 5 mag in both bands for 24 hours on the same night . the image in figure 1 shows the details of the variation by 1 mag on the night of april 25 . although the variations were relatively small on the nights of march 1 and april 25 because of the relatively good weather , the magnitude of inov can easily be determined from the data . when we perform the analysis , there is a question that whether the interference from the host galaxy of the nearby agn contributes to the observed variation . the results suggest that the variation in the spectrum could result from the interference ##s from the host galaxy in the microwave range , especially when the differences are in @xcite . we conclude that the material from the host galaxy is not present in the current image . first of all , no physical features of the host galaxy could be determined from the images taken by sdss , mainly because the galaxy is far away from earth ( see @ xmath20 ) . secondly , the host galaxy is much smaller than the agn . secondly , as mentioned above , the optical methods we used in this study are independent of the fwhm of sufficient strength , which is large enough to exclude much of the material from the original host galaxy . the star rl - nls1 - sdssj094857 . 1 + 002225 was observed in optical mode using naoc 10 - meter telescopes to look for unusual inov activity . our optical monitoring system found strong evidence for the presence of inov in both the _ s _ and _ p _ phases of the star . the star exhibited unusual activity not only on the timescale of one day , but also over several days . the presence of the inov indicates that the object has a gas disk in the line of sight of the observer , which supports the conclusions drawn from the high - resolution observations ( e . g . , abdo et al. 2009a , 2009b ) and from the observed optical spectrum and high brightness temperature ( zhou et al . 2003 ) . sdssj094857 . 3 + 002225 is notable for its spectral characteristics . on the one hand , its optical spectrum with high absorption is characteristic of nls1s . the black ##band @ xmath0 ##21 indicates a very large black ##body ( here ) h @ xmath21 and a high mass number ( zhou et al . 2003 ) . on the other hand , its spectral characteristics are characteristic of blazars with the optical signature close to the line of sight , such as the inov ( or , ir ) spectrum , high brightness temperature , and high @ xmath22 - ray emission ( see examples in table 1 ) . so far , the rl - nls1s with star - like ray emission have been detected by multi - wavelength observations of several objects including the object sdssj094857 . 3 + 002225 . we send the data to zhou et al . ( 2008 ) for a detailed review . with the first observation of _ the _ object , @ xmath22 - ray emission was detected . therl - nls1s , like the one shown above , which suggest the presence of well known galaxies in these objects @ xcite . the results suggest that the new rl - nls1s may represent a new class of @ xmath22 - type agns because of their large atomic mass , large galactic radius , and the ring - like structure of the surrounding galaxies . the transport mechanism of rl - nls1s is the electromagnetic force . there are two proposed models for the rl - nls1s . the first model is the elliptical model @ xcite . the model suggests that the ( at least a handful of ) rl - nls1s are being transported side - on . the very small size of the balmer emission line could have come from large distances if the emission - line length ( blr ) is close to a circle @ xcite . in addition , there is no evidence of a circular blr in the rl - agns @ xcite . in this case , the true mass is still unknown for these objects since the current theoretical estimate of the true mass of agn from pre - existing emission data differs from the definition of an elliptical .of the emission - line lines with the orbital ##s @ xcite . although the same effect is possible because it is possible to change the mass of rl - nls1s from the @ xmath8 @ xmath23 end to the massive bulge in @ xcite , the massive bulge are not explained by the existence of the bulge . two modes in which the solar system can be observed . the first is the emission mode in @ xcite . the rl - nls1s with higher critical mass are very close to or even near the upper limit . higher - mass planets may contribute to the emission mode when keplerian planets are observed in @ xcite . the difference is also related to the radio spectrum . different emission modes can occur in different frequencies and this may explain the difference in the radio spectrum . emission modes are also related to the mass of the massive bulge . also the higher mass of planets may also affect the radio spectrum of nls1s @ xcite . it is possible that emission mode models with gravitational models cannot explain the behaviour of the rl - nls1s . although our observationgiven that the very faint radio emission of rl - nls1 sdssj0948 + 1 . 5 + 002225 was probably coming from the small anti - gravitational jet with a small observation window ( can also be found in the following wikipedia articles ) , more research is needed in the future to determine the nature of the gravitational jet . we are very grateful to dr . m . komossa for her public service and scientific contribution . this project was supported by the us national science foundation through grants nsfc 10803008 and nsfc 10873017 . it was also supported by the 973 fund ( 2009cb824800 ) . boller , m . 1997 , astron . nachr . , 318 , 209 cellone , m . a . , romero , m . a . , & combi , m . a . 2000 , , 119 , 1534 foschini , g . , maraschi , g . , tavecchio , g . , ghisellini , g . , gliozzi , g . , & sambruna , m . a . 2009 , adv . science res . , 1 , 889 healey , j . a . , &, j . a . , smith , j . a . , sadler , d . j . , ricci , m . , smith , g . , ulvestad , j . a . , & winn , j . a . 2007 , , 171 , 171 komossa , s . , voges , m . , xu , y . , mathur , s . , adorf , m . j . , lemson , j . , duschl , j . , & grupe , m . 2006 , , 132 , 531 komossa , s . 2008 , revista mexicana de astronomia y astrofisica , 10 , 1 , 34 smith , m . , laurent - muehleisen , m . a . , ridgway , d . a . , becker , m . a . , & smith , m . a . 2001 , , 551 , l17
