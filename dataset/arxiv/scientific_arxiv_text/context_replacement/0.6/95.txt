this is one of the important phenomena in theoretical physics , mainly because it can provide useful information and lead the way to many interesting low - dimensional problems . the so - called three - dimensional ( 3d ) 2d ordered lattice systems have received very extensive attention in the last two years @ xcite . due to the symmetry the systems have a local rotational symmetry @ xmath7 , different from the global global rotational symmetry @ xmath8 . the result of these interactions is the formation of two types of phase transitions , the one leading to the phase ordering of kosterlitz - thouless ( k ) phase @ xcite and the other to the chiral ordering . whether these transitions are independent and occur at the same time has always been a problem @ xcite . the main question is whether the symmetry group of the chiral order belongs to the ising ##lass class or not @ xcite . the problem has a good theoretical solution in the complex case of linear josephson molecules in a uniform magnetic field @ xcite and discotic in phase @ xcite . in the 2d - ordered lattice , two lattice ##s are being formed simultaneously . the first lattice is the cubic lattice where the molecules can form a complex array of ferro##magnetic ( gm ) and electric ( af ) fields ( villain models ) @ xcite . the other model is the af villain model of the crystal lattice @ xcite . as for the af villain model , the effect of the @ xmath9 - fold symmetry - breaking fields is an open system @ xcite ; that is , the same as in the @ xmath9 - state clock model , where exactly the same fields are used for the interaction of the two beams . the @ xmath8 symmetry of the villain model is replaced by the 2d @ xmath10 symmetry of the @ xmath9 - state clock model . it is from @ xcite that the 2d @ xmath9 - state clock model has two phase transitions of # ##n for @ xmath11 and @ xmath0 ( @ xmath12 ) for @ xmath13 . there is an electric wave - like transition between a low - temperature free phase ( @ xmath14 ) and a high - temperature bound phase ( @ xmath15 ) . it is not easy to see the effect of the @ xmath9 - fold symmetry - breaking fields on theinstead of the highly simplified standard model . more recently , noh _ et al . _ @ xcite solved the af ##fine - hour ##ing problem of the crystal lattice using the quantum monte carlo method because of the similar results to the @ xmath16br monolayers physisorbed on _ @ xcite . however , they did not pay attention to the high temperature phase transitions of this material . it has to be noted that the theoretical approach involves very small details . most models of double transition scenario , do not consider the existence of two very different phase transitions . however , the arguments in favor of double transition theory have shown that the two phase transitions occur at very different temperatures . therefore , it is difficult to obtain accurate theoretical results . however , great progress has been made in the development of the theory of monte carlo methods . recently , several algorithms have been developed for the monte carlo method to calculate the energy space of molecules ( energy ) , . these are the multicanonical method @ xcite , the vector correlation method @ xcite , the vector correlation method @ xcite , and the wang and wang method @ xcite . all of these algorithms calculate the random variables in the energy space . in this article we describe our monte carlostudy of the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice . the ground state ( gs ) of the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice has the same configuration as the af villain model ; and this model is used as the basis gs model for the fully frustrated clock model . on the other hand , the six - state clock model on the triangular lattice ( villain model ) has different gs configuration since there are extra defects . the presence of these extra defects will bring about a problem for the fully frustrated six - state clock model . however , we will not discuss these problems in the main article . the af villain and the six - state clock model models are similar because they have the same gs configuration . for the monte carlo method , we use the wang - wang algorithm @ xcite , and the villain model is obtained by the use of the # ##ening algorithm @ xcite . the fact that the time of the six - state clock model is given by the value of @ xmath17 , where @ xmath18 is the time constant , is an important fact for the study of the six - state clock model ; it is possible to use this time as the monte carlodetails of what the state is . the text of the original paper is presented as follows : in the first section we describe the theory and we describe the calculation method . details of the theory and calculations will be published in 2010 . the next section is dedicated to the following results . the # ##z model is associated with the hamiltonian @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 is the number of nearest neighbor states , @ xmath21 the square lattice spin axis of the @ xmath22 - th spin , and @ xmath23 the spin associated with the @ xmath22 - th spin . however , we can use the 24 - hour relaxation time ; so the dos has two states , @ xmath24 with @ xmath25 . the state is described by @ xmath26 . for the z model for the square lattice this can be solved by a # ##ization of ac and af coupling . for the cubic model on the other hand , @ xmath26 is carefully chosen to have two af coupling , @ xmath27 , so that the state is not unstable . the hamiltonian ( [ z ] ) is invariant under the action of the first state , @ xmath8and the third spin is @ xmath7 . the interaction of these bonds is known to have two types of effects , which roughly correspond to magnetic order and chiral ##ity . the second type is also known as @ xmath28 - angle , where two different bonds result in @ xmath28 change in orientation , which is shown in fig . [ gsconf ] . we divide the triangle into two different sublattices for each magnetic order . each site in the triangle belongs to one of the sublattices , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 . we change the magnetic order parameter to @ xmath31 where @ xmath32 is the orientation of sublattice @ xmath33 , and @ xmath34 is the orientation of spins ; @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 are the order parameters for the sublattices @ xmath37 and @ xmath30 . . they are represented by dots . sites belonging to the same sublattice follow the same orientation of spins . the @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 dots indicate the difference of the two chiralities . the ground .has 42 - fold symmetry . ] to define the global spin rotation @ xmath7 , we start with the chirality . the local chirality in the simplest case is defined as @ xmath40 } _ { = \ frac { { } { { \ sqrt { } \ theta _ { 1 , 2 \ in { \ theta } } \ left ( \ theta _ i - \ theta _ j ) , \ ] ] where the @ xmath41 component of the local chirality is 1 . the numerical solution in fig . ( [ chiral ] ) is chosen so that the value of the numerical solution is 1 . in the gs configuration shown in fig . [ gsconf ] , the local chirality is a symmetry breaking of the right - handed ( positive ) orientation and the left - handed ( negative ) orientation . thus , the local chirality @ xmath42 is the transition state for the @ xmath7 symmetry breaking process . the gs configuration has @ xmath43 - fold symmetry which is given by the corresponding global spin rotation is @ xmath44 with @ xmath45 - fold and with @ xmath7 ##7 with@ xmath46 - 0 . the existence of this state is used as one of the starting points for the calculation of energy dos . we use the monte carlo method to calculate the energy dos and to obtain the state energy . next , we will describe the wang - landau method @ xcite . this method is similar to the multicanonical method ( entropic method ) of the @ xcite , the free field method @ xcite and the mean field method @ xcite ; the method is based on the assumption that performing a random walk in phase space with transition probability equal to the number of the states , @ xmath47 , will result in a large change of energy dos . the wang - landau method adds a diffusion factor to predict the progress of the random walk in the next step of the process . since the energy was not known at the time , it is now known @ xmath48 for the energy @ xmath49 . the transition is from [ @ xmath50 to @ xmath51 [ @ xmath52 , \ dots { trans } \ ] ] and the energy @ xmath53 is iteratively calculated at @ xmath54 each time the .not possible . the energy of @ xmath55 is then set to zero , increasing the ` accuracy ' of the resulting model ; the dos for each state @ xmath49 is always less than a fraction of the sum of , say , 0 . 5 . we can use the # ##ening relation for getting a refined estimate . in using the # ##ening relation , oliveira _ et al . _ @ xcite pays attention to the number of potential moves , and the average of the potential energy moves , @ xmath56 , for a given state @ xmath57 . the maximum number of moves is @ xmath58 for a given # ##off ##a of the ising method above . the energy dos is related to the number of potential moves , @ xmath59 where @ xmath60 is the microcanonical state with energy @ xmath49 . this relation is shown to be true on the state @ xcite , and we take e . ( [ bhr ] ) the energy average of . we take the average of the potential moves , @ xmath61 , and use this relation for getting a refined estimate of the energy dos . it is shown @xcite that @ xmath56 is a simple model , which has the advantage of reducing the number of potential moves . we should also note that the energy distribution itself does not depend on the quantum mechanical model that follows , and the microcanonical values of the potential moves can be calculated using this kind of monte carlo method . in order to reduce simulation time for different system sizes , we divide it into 10 different runs and perform random runs for each different number of sizes . the average values of the runs are put together and combined to calculate the thermal temperature with the average size @ xmath62 . the following steps @ xmath63 using the same rules , we perform the calculation of the thermal temperature @ xmath64 according to @ xmath65 monte carlo method . next , we perform 10 random runs for each system size in order to calculate the temperature and to eliminate the noise . next we consider the model for the af ##fine - phase crystal system on the 2d lattice . we have calculated the temperature with the system size @ xmath66 = 12 , 15 , 30 , 50 , and 66 . we calculate the system boundary conditions . we calculate the temperature , using the rules @ xmath67 , and thechanges in the gs energy , @ xmath68 , are used in order to improve the accuracy of the calculations . using fig . [ ds48 ] , we use the temperature dependence of lattice size @ xmath69 as an example . here , the temperature is represented in units of @ xmath17 , and the gs energy is represented by @ xmath70 . . the pressure is represented in units of @ xmath17 . ] the temperature - dependent values of the @ xmath71 are used to calculate the gs energy @ xmath72 , using fig . ( [ ave ] ) . we show the specific heat per mole of the [ @ xmath73 , \ ] ] where @ xmath74 is the lattice size . = 20 , 30 , 60 , 80 , and 100 . ] we show the temperature dependence of specific heat for different lattice sizes of crystals . the energy dependence of @ xmath75 in units of @ xmath76 is a possible indication of the presence of higher - order phase transitions . we also see a peak in the high energy region of @ xmath77 , which may be due to the presence ofthe same . therefore , we should use the magnetic and chiral ##ity for the detailed analysis of the phase transition . the transition rate and the transition time can be determined almost directly from the calculation of the length ratio and the corresponding correlation function . the magnetic and chirality correlation functions are defined as the following : @ xmath78 where @ xmath79 is the average distance between them . formally , the term @ xmath79 is a constant , but we have given a different definition . one of the original experiments @ xcite showed that the ratio of the correlation function with the distance is a good measure for the rate of the second - order phase transition as well as for the phase transition , and this length ratio can be used for the analysis of the distance - based statistical model @ xcite . at the critical point , at the x axis , the correlation function @ xmath80 for an infinite system corresponds to a ratio of @ xmath79 , @ xmath81 where @ xmath82 is the second order and @ xmath83 the time scale . for a finite system at the critical point , the correlation function depends on the order of , @ xmat##h84 where @ xmath85 is the system length . finally , the sum of the correlation functions with fixed distances has a one - dimensional system ( fss ) , with a single scale factor , @ xmath86 if we have two ratios , @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 . in the second case , we set @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 for these ratios . then , we set the correlation ratios @ xmath91 and @ xmath92 , where @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 are related similarly to fig . ( [ magchi1 ] ) and ( [ magchi2 ] ) . it is possible for the correlation functions to belong to the same sublattice ; since the fixed distances are related to @ xmath89 and @ xmath95 , we set the system length as a multiple of @ xmath43 . we set the correlation ratio as for the ( a ) spherical and ( b ) chiral ratios in fig . [ corf ] . from the time evolution of the observed correlation function , in fig . [ corf ] ( 2 ) , we see that the correlationof different sizes , for the high temperature region ( @ xmath96 ) , and by ##s for the low - temperature and high - temperature regions . this model is the same as that for the unfrustrated two - phase gas , @ xcite , which assumes that there are two different transitions of each type at @ xmath11 and @ xmath0 . the transition on the higher temperature side of the specific heat , fig . [ spht ] , will correspond to the lower temperature k transition at @ xmath11 . the higher temperature k transition at @ xmath0 is also excluded from the specific heat , because it is dominated by the second phase due to the chiral ##ity . we can construct an fss model based on the second term of the pulse function , @ xmath97 , where @ xmath98 . the @ xmath66 value of @ xmath99 is given by @ xmath100 . the value of the high temperature coefficient @ xmath101 for different sizes , we estimate the different transition temperatures . we estimate the k - transition temperature that has the value @ xmath102 . in fig . [ sp##12 ] , we plot @ xmath99 as the dependence of @ xmath103 with @ xmath104 for the best - fit value in fig . ( [ t _ k ] ) . for the correction factor we have used a similar function of @ xmath103 to calculate the factor . the dependence of @ xmath102 has been set to be 0 . 85 , 0 . 95 and 0 . 95 for the dependence of @ xmath0 , whereas @ xmath102 has been set to be 0 . 95 , 0 . 985 and 0 . 95 for @ xmath11 . the dependence with the @ xmath102 is represented by different lines in fig . [ t12 ] , but they are plotted as a single line in this fig , which means that @ xmath105 depends on @ xmath102 in fig . ( [ t _ k ] ) and the dependence of @ xmath102 will be represented by the @ xmath102 dependence of @ xmath105 . we plot the second dependence of the first sample in fig . ( [ t _ k ] ) and @ xmat##h106 where the numbers in the table are the values of the first row . the estimate of @ xmath0 is much lower than the estimate of noh _ @ xcite , @ xmath107 . this is due to the fact that the same equation is used for ms . @ xcite , and the estimate of the number ##n is lower because of the change to fss @ xcite . and ( b ) @ xmath108 of the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice for @ xmath66 = 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , and 72 , where @ xmath109 . the data for @ xmath102 = 0 . 87 , 0 . 98 and 0 . 99 are represented by the numbers in ( a ) , and those for @ xmath102 = 0 . 87 , 0 . 985 and 0 . 99 . ( b ) . , [ = " = : " ] + and ( c ) @ xmath108 of the af six - state clock model on the triangular lattice for @ xmath66 = 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , and 72 , where @ xmath109 . the data for @ xmath##102 = 0 . 95 , 0 . 95 and 0 . 98 ##5 denote all the values for ( a ) , and those for @ xmath102 = 0 . 95 , 0 . 985 and 0 . 99 ##5 ( b ) . , x = " [ : " ] . we plot the values of @ xmath83 . we then look at the # ##s of correlation function @ xmath102 for various samples and find the corresponding correlation function @ xmath110 . we give consideration to the power - law dependence of the correlation function on the sample size , @ xmath111 , which can be seen from fig . ( [ corr _ 1 ] ) and @ xmath82 was found to be constant . we plot @ xmath110 versus @ xmath66 for the @ xmath102 samples with some corrections from fig . [ 2 ] . the value of @ xmath83 is given by the value of the best - fit sample for each value of correlation ratio . the resulting error estimates for the sample and @ xcite were found to be low compared to the original . we plot @ xmath8##3 also holds with respect to the high extinction coefficient @ xmath102 in fig . [ eta ] . in the p phase , @ xmath102 is directly proportional to the temperature . we should note that the expression @ xmath83 is valid only in the normal range @ xmath112 on the richter scale . we consider the values of @ xmath102 , which are @ xmath11 and @ xmath0 for example in fig . as can be seen , the maximum value @ xmath83 acts at a constant mean temperature ; that is , the value @ xmath83 s varies with the temperature in the p phase . since @ xmath83 is a constant for larger @ xmath102 in fig . [ eta ] , the expression for the maximum mean value @ xmath11 ##2 expressed as @ xmath113 for larger @ xmath102 ( lower temperature ) . , @ xmath83 depends on @ xmath102 relative to temperature in fig . [ eta ] . note the fact that the maximum value of @ xmath105 in fig . ( [x _ t ] ) based on the distance from the reference point , that is , @ xmath114 , we obtain the value @ xmath83 and the estimated value of @ xmath0 by definition . the values @ xmath83 and @ xmath105 are , for example , 0 . 310 and 0 . 300 for @ xmath115 , 0 . 298 and 1 . 05 for @ xmath116 , and 2 . 284 and 2 . 300 for @ xmath117 . taking the @ xmath83 value as a function of @ xmath118 , and then to @ xmath119 , we obtain @ xmath120 of course , other values such as @ xmath121 are unknown ; thus an example is shown in the figure . in fig . [ 2 ] we find the value of @ xmath102 which matches @ xmath0 in the equation . the @ xmath83 of this @ xmath102 is identical with the estimated value , @ xmath122 . for the unfrustrated steady - state quantum system , the value##s @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 were observed by 1 / 4 and 1 / 6 respectively @ xcite , and they were confirmed by @ xcite . the experimental results show that the frequencies associated with the phase transitions are identical values for the different states , which the previous experiment @ xcite failed to confirm . versus @ xmath66 . [ the value of the first - order of states of the state @ xmath102 is the value of s @ xmath83 . ] of phase transitions as a function of the correlation ratio @ xmath102 . there is a line to the right . ] the temperature dependence of the chiral correlation ratio is also shown in fig . [ corf ] ( 2 ) . the phenomenon of chiral phase transitions can be easily explained . in the figure , there is a single critical point which is the first - order phase transition ; this corresponds to the first peak in the # ##ity spectrum . then using the fss model of chirality correlation ratio , as shown in fig . [ nu1 ] , we can find the critical point and frequency @ xmath125 of chiral ##ity . the peaks at @ xmat##h126 our conclusion , that the chiral ##ity occurs at temperatures higher than @ xmath0 of [UNK] , is consistent with previous results in terms of the initial temperature . more recently , korshunov @ xcite has shown that the phase transition associated with the formation of lone pairs takes place at a higher temperature than the initial phase transition associated with formation of the ising - type crystal structure . our prediction for the parameters @ xmath125 is consistent with the results by lee and lee @ xcite and by ozeki and ito @ xcite , but not with the results by olsson @ xcite ; that is , the observed parameters are not affected by the ising model parameters . we have also predicted the observed temperature behavior of the parameters @ xmath125 up to our initial temperature parameter , @ xmath127 . olsson @ xcite showed that corrections to the parameters are possible in the more stable standard model , and the results are consistent with @ xmath128 . et al . _ _ showed that only for small enough systems the ising - type structure was observed . however , using nonequilibrium simulation techniques for large enough systems up to @xmath129 , ozeki and ito @ xcite ##s observed the @ xmath130 , which suggests that the limits to fss are not very great . however , more detailed calculations will be needed for the critical phenomena of chiral order . . in addition , we have constructed the af two - phase clock model for the cubic crystal using the wang - wang formula , with the # ##ening parameter . the model is closely related to the af - t clock model . we have observed that the model has two parameters , resonance ordering and chiral ordering . the former indicates the order transition and the latter indicates the second - order transition . we have also observed the higher temperature t transitions due to the nonlinear nature of the af model . our measurements of the higher temperature temperature @ xmath0 and the critical phenomena of chiral order @ xmath1 , that is , @ xmath2 and @ xmath3 , suggest the same resonance ##s . the higher temperature temperature is estimated as @ xmath4 . the critical phenomena of the transitions are estimated as @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 , which suggests that the energies associated with the two transitions are equaland for the smallest ones . for the physical parameters of the chiral model , our estimate of the parameters @ xmath125 , that is , @ xmath131 , shows that the model does not belong to the ising theory family , but more detailed analysis is still needed . the authors want to thank t . kawashima , t . otsuka , t . yamaguchi , t . suzuki , and t . ozeki for their work . society of the sciences ( [UNK] ) also appreciated the support given by the ministry of education , science , sports and culture , japan . this support was provided by a grant - in - aid for the authors from the japan society for the promotion of science . the calculation of this model has been done on the computers of tokyo imperial university and those of the computer laboratory , institute for solid state physics , university of tokyo . m . teitel and m . jayaprakash , phys . math * 27 * , 598 ( 1983 ) . m . granato , j . p . kosterlitz , j . lee and j . s . lee , phys . lett . * 27 * , 1090 ( 1991 ) . m . ramirez - garcia and m. m . jose , phys . b * 49 * , 9567 ( 1994 ) . d . lee and jung - k . kim , phys . b * 49 * , 15184 ( 1994 ) . m . olsson , phys . lett . * 77 * , 2758 ( 1995 ) ;
