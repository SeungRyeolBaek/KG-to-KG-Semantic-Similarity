it is believed that these magnetic fields are produced by the tachocline , the boundary between the active regions and the radiative zone . due to gravitational forces , they travel outward and up into the upper atmosphere in the form of @ xmath0 - magnetic flux and @ xcite . the larger , active regions contain clouds with magnetic fields in excess of @ xmath4 mx and lifetime of from weeks to months . the smaller regions consist of clouds and have an order of magnitude magnetic field , lasting for days to weeks . the most active regions discovered to date are the so - called active regions . they have energies of @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 mx and duration in the range from hours to days ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . outside of active regions , the early atmosphere was shown to be composed of magnetic fields with energy roughly in equipartition with the photospheric convective field @ xcite . an important question is the nature of these fields . @ xcite suggests that the internetwork loops are closed loops of plasma brought to the surface by the upflow##s of magnetic flux caused by atmospheric convection . in a subsequent study , @ xcite further studied the evolution of magnetic fields and showed , for the first time , the three dimensional structure of the magnetic field components in different regions of the solar system . it was found that at least 10 % of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun is generated by low - lying magnetic loops . subsequently , @ xcite published a series of spectropolarimetric observations made with the infrared space telescope @ _ hinode _ . these observations followed the previous series of the magnetic loop in the internetwork , suggesting that they occur on small scales other than in @ xmath7 . @ xcite and @ xcite show that the emergence of magnetic loops on small scales brings large amounts of magnetic flux to the surface both in flux ##n and in the quiet sun . another type of magnetic ##ing has been observed by @ xcite . this is the emergence and subsequent disappearance of what appear to be _ magnetic _ loops at the site of magnetic convection . the observations also suggest that a small portion of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun may be the cause of the formation of low - lying magnetic loops . so , where do the loops come from ? do theycaused by the quiet solar plasma , by a local phenomenon , or by release of energy from the solar wind ? is the effect of the local phenomenon confined to the atmosphere or does the magnetic field affect the cloud formation ? the answers to these questions have important implications for our understanding of the physical and chemical properties of the solar system . for example , @ xcite shows that the magnetic energy stored in the hot sun is enough to cause the radiative heating of the atmosphere . the solar magnetic fields are good candidates to solve the chromospheric and solar heating problems , but a mechanism capable of transferring their energy to the upper atmosphere has not been found yet . from a theoretical point of view , it is not clear whether the electrons of the quiet solar plasma give rise to the plasma . @ xcite have proposed mhd models in which the magnetic field travels into the atmosphere in the form of large - amplitude @ xmath0 - waves . they enter the atmosphere and are reconnected with the rapidly changing solar magnetic field , heating the atmosphere and producing high frequency mhd waves that travel into the atmosphere . however , the magnetoconvection models of @ xcite are @ .##math0 - particles that accelerate as they travel through the upper atmosphere . these observations indicate the need for further studies aimed at determining whether magnetic fields extending into the dark regions are able to penetrate the cloud cover . " we use multi - spectral images acquired by _ hinode _ and the dutch open telescope to address this problem . we will study the magnetic properties of large - scale magnetic fields in the quiet regions , including details of their magnetic properties , generation times , shapes , sizes , and shapes . the data presented in this article consists of a series of polarimetric and optical observations of the dark regions at the observatory . they were made on three consecutive nights ( 25 - 27 september , 4 and 5 october 2007 ) by the collaboration of the chandra space telescope , hinode @ xcite and the dutch open telescope ( sp ; * ? ? ? * ) at observatorio de san roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) . the observations belong to the _ hinode _ t _ project , ` ` ` hinode / canary islands observatory ' ' . the _ hinode _ spectro - telescope ( sp ; * ? ? ? * )measured the combined intensity difference of the pairs of lines at 630 nm with a maximum field of view ( fov ) of @ xmath8 . this data was transmitted with a frequency of 1 hz during 2 - 3 hours per day ( see [ tabla _ 1 ] ) . the exposure time per line transmitted was reduced to 1 . 5 s to accommodate the small changes . however , this mode of operation also led to a noise level of @ xmath9 in place of the noise of @ xmath10 . with a pixel size of @ xmath11 along the line and @ xmath12 perpendicular to it , the sp ##i had a maximum resolution of 1 @ xmath13 . the hinode narrowband fourier imager ( nfi ; tsuneta et al . 2008 ) obtained the u and v filtergrams of the intensity of the chromospheric # ##b at 517 . 5 nm wavelength , @ xmath14 nm , from a source . the nfi was used in shutterless photography to obtain an average exposure time of 1 . 5 s per line and viewing angle , with an fov of @ xmath15 . the v filtergrams had a pixel size of 0 . 08@ xmath7 , and we rebined them to the sp pixel size in order to further increase the resolution . the _ hinode _ ray _ imager ( bfi ; * ? ? ? * ) took two images of the atmosphere in the cn bandhead at 388 . 5 nm ( filter width of 0 . 52 nm ) and the atmosphere in the caiih band at 396 . 5 nm ( filter width of 0 . 52 nm ) . the exposure times were 0 . 2 s and 0 . 3 s , respectively . the bfi observed a region of @ xmath16 with a pixel size of @ xmath17 . both the nfi and the bfi took images with a resolution of 1 nm . the area covered by the sp represents a small fraction of the combined fov of the nfi and the bfi . additionally , we took cospatial and cotemporal images of the solar system along the path of the sun . the sp observed photospheric and chromospheric regions by means of a tunable lyot instrument that measured the absorption spectrum of the nm @ xmath18 light at three different wavelengths ( @ xmath19 , @ xmath##20 , and 21 ) . the passband of the dot is 0 . 5 . short bursts of 10 ms were recorded at each observation and for each day . following the noise reduction procedure for the sp , the two filtergrams were combined using a different compression algorithm ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . the resulting images have a fov of @ xmath21 and have a spatial resolution of + 0 . 5 . the sp and _ hinode _ carried out separate measurements , but there was some overlap between them because of the atmospheric conditions . the sp images have been analyzed for dark current , bright - current , and radar cross - section using the sp _ prep . pro tool included in the solarsoft package . the same applies to the hinode filtergrams ( fg _ prep . pro ) for dark current , bright current , and gamma rays . the spectropolarimetric ##s and the b filtergrams have been analyzed with high precision using the dot , ring - shaped magnetic field , and cloud structure as a reference . in fig . [ calcio ] we have time - series h filtergrams and h magnetograms for the three days of observation . the h samples have been compared to themap of the sp fov . the maps show the area covered by the sp . note the absence of sp brigthenings in the sp data , all except for very large areas are composed of sp ##s . + ccccc # & 1st period & 2nd period & & & & + & ( se ) & ( se ) & & & 5 + 1 @ xmath22 sep & 07 : 00 -

scale magnetic fields in the solar system . to this end , we use photospheric and chromospheric observables . the sp ##s make it possible to determine the nature of the radiation in the sun . the analysis is done by the cn filtergrams , where the signals associated with magnetic fields are clearly visible . we compute the total linear ##ity as the integral of the total stokes @ xmath24 spectrum . the analysis is carried out over the wavelength range from @ xmath25 pm to @ xmath26 pm . the total linear # is calculated as the integral of the stokes @ xmath27 spectrum of 603 . 5 pm , with the same first and second wavelengths . we then use the linear signals to search for the linear correlation between two signals of opposite frequencies with different wavelengths . since in general the linear # signals are very weak in the bright light , we convert those signals to loop - like fields . after determining thatthe linear signal is represented by the linear @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 s . the [ _ _ ejemplo ] shows the first stage of the formation of a large - scale feedback loop as shown on the 630 . 5 s graph . the lowest values represent peak intensity ( top ) , weak linear signal ( middle ) , and average intensity ##ity ( bottom ) . higher values represent negative linear signals . black and white lines represent the intersection of strong linear and weak linear signals . at @ xmath30 s , a patch of circular signal opens up at the center of the loop . this leads to the inner loop of the magnetic structure integrated into the loop . at @ xmath31 and 32 s , two circular ##ized patches of linear signal appear next to it , at the center of the magnetic structure . the fact that the linear signal is generated earlier than the circular signal indicates that the magnetic structure has the form of an @ xmath0 - loop : the loop generates circular signals and the magnetic fields of the footpoints give rise to linear signals @ xcite . the linear signal is unlike the signal in @ xmath32 s . thefootpoints increase with time . this sequence of events is associated with a loop that forms and extends deep into the atmosphere . the distance between the footpoints keeps increasing until they reach the center of the area covered by the sp . the time evolution of this loop can be shown below [ 2 ] . the stokes @ xmath33 and @ xmath24 filtergrams located on the red and blue sides of the spectral lines provide information about the local pressure / temperature distribution of @ xcite . we have used them to generate both magnetograms ( @ xmath34 ) and dopplergrams ( @ xmath35 ) . @ xmath36 where the letters r and s represent the distances of @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 away from the sp , respectively . to take note , the magnetograms generated in this manner are not affected by ground motion . the stokes @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 have been converted into magnetic ##s ##es and line - of - sight data corresponding to @ xmath39 with @ xmath40 in km s @ xmath1 and @ xmath42 in km s @ xmath3 .the [ dopplergram ] is used for the sun @ xmath43 and earth @ xmath3 . these expresions have been superseded by analysis of the b line measurements in the fourier transform # ##s of the southern hemisphere @ xcite and provide only rough estimates of the magnetic flux density and temperature at the end of range of the b line . since the s and z are not measured , the # ##s magnetograms can only be used to detect negative magnetic fields such as those directed at the footpoints of the poles . in contrast , fields directed towards the poles and upflows can also be detected . note that our naming convention for the dot differs from that commonly used in astronomy . at the dot we do not get polarimetric measurements . however , magnetic fields can be detected by the measurements in the above filtergrams . the passband of the _ hinode _ z _ has a large photospheric component , so it covers a wide range that extends well into the sun @ xcite . also , information about the upper atmosphere is provided by the h @ xmath18 measurements made at the dot . we have used them to generate dopplergrams .in regions of the infrared . we calculate the longitudinal flux density from the two @ xmath24 measurements of the 630 nm region using the mean field strength ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ) @ xmath44 where @ xmath45 is the longitudinal flux density , @ xmath46 the land factor , @ xmath47 the field strength , @ xmath48 the direction of the field with respect to the horizon , @ xmath49 the value of that depends on the characteristic intensity @ xmath50 and the characteristic land factor @ xmath51 of the field , and @ xmath33 is the value of . the values of @ xmath40 when , and @ xmath1 when @ xmath50 is defined as . the longitudinal flux density is calculated from a least - squares expansion of the { @ xmath52 } { \ partial \ lambda } = 0 , \ frac { \ partial } { \ partial \ lambda } \ left [ \ lambda _ i \ left ( λ _ i + \ lambda + \ frac { \ partial } } { \ partial \ lambda } _ i \ right ) ^ 2 \ right ] = 0 ,\ { { weakfield } \ ] ] which includes all the wavelength samples of the spectrum ( is @ xmath53 ) and is much more accurate that is based on the magnetogram ##s . this process is repeated for each photon and each spectral wavelength sample . the final result is @ xmath54 to reduce the noise caused by mx ##s we use a data set containing only photon ##s with a standard deviation of @ xmath55 @ xmath10 . the analysis of this data set in fig . [ eq2 ] leads to a u - shaped plot for the magnetic flux density which is centered at 0 and with a standard deviation of @ xmath56 @ ##z @ xmath1 . in the [ hist _ magnetic _ domain ] we analyze the data based on the normal range . the figure shows a plot of the values of the magnetic flux density values from 630 . 5 and 630 . 5 hz . only the low energy values at the footpoints of the peaks with values of 10 in the normal range have been determined . as can be seen , the range is normal and centered at 0 . the figure also shows a linear plot of the magnetic flux density##sities correspond with the field sources . the fact that most of the loops are located near the poles means that in the majority of cases both field lines have the same magnetic field . this also supports the idea that the lines are correlated . during many years of research we have observed the evolution of several loop - like structures in the @ xmath57 region associated with the hinode spectropolarimeter . the [ tabla ] shows their evolution . the individual loops show very different evolution patterns . in this table we have some examples to illustrate the evolution pattern , distinguishing between loops that go to the surface and those that reach low - level . one of the best examples of a loop that reached the surface is the ml09 , observed on december 11 , 2007 at 12 : 00 utc . its evolution is shown in figures . [ ej1 _ crom ] and [ ej1 _ crom2 ] . each figure shows a single loop , for a period of 1020 s . from left to right we see cn filtergrams , photospheric los , and from the total @ xmath24 line - crossing time of 630 . 05 s , the @ ##ity shifts of 632 . 05namely , the current is measured from at 517 . 25 nm , los measured at the time of termination of the feedback loop , and the spread - out filtergrams . the numbers represent upflows . note that the time intervals are not evenly distributed ; rather , we have separated them to better represent the different stages of the loop . the plotted images show regions of high linear intensity starting at 630 . 25 nm . when the footpoints of the loop are visible in the image , we see regions of 630 . 25 nm with lines in black and white for the negative and positive signals , respectively . when the footpoints are not visible in the 2d magnetogram we plot them in blue and red . the first arrow of r . [ ej1 _ crom ] shows the region of negative signals in the loop ( cf . the first arrow in the cn filtergram ) . it is represented by the first tip of the loop touching the surface . the footpoints are not immediately visible but may be ' much ' , very close to the region of linear intensity . r @ xmath58 the loop is clearly visible . it is in the negative region , and becausethe resulting magnetic materials cause the field strength to increase from below the ground to @ xcite . the los velocity maps show photospheric upflows at the top of the footpoints , indicating that the loop is intact . for the loop , however , the magnetic field remains in the same region : we do not see linear ##ization signals in the b magnetograms or brightenings at caiih that could be associated with the loop . however , the lower photospheric field , with positive components located towards the bottom of the loop , at a frequency of about one third of the total fov , is clearly visible both in the b magnetograms and the ca filtergrams , and they remain there during most of the scan time . this also demonstrates the limitations of our instrument : the components that are present in the velocity maps but not in b and ca are much larger than the c system . in @ xmath59 s and @ xmath60 s the linear ##ization signals are in the ground . the positive footpoint has migrated to the intergranular region and is concentrated , whereas the negative footpoint appears to be lower in the ground and much less concentrated . the distance between them is approximately. we can see linear motion in the photospheric pressure distribution . since the loop is confined to two regions , it is reasonable to assume that the linear motion occurs because the center of the loop is the intersection point of the 630 z line . however , no traces of the loop are found either in b or c . at @ xmath61 s , the linear motion signals cospatial with the photospheric footpoints are visible in the b magnetograms for the first time . this indicates that the loop has reached the upper photospheric / lower chromospheric boundary where the outer portion of the z line forms . however , the b dopplergram shows downflows of about @ xmath62 s at @ xmath3 at the intersection of the z footpoint . the downflows could be water flowing around the edge of the loop as the entire loop has low atmospheric pressure . these changes would be necessary for the loop to get rid of all of the water before it can move into a more open region . at @ xmath63 s , the loop is completely empty of the water produced by the sp . the signals in the b magnetogram are much more complex and areto footpoints located in intergranular lanes . from now on the distance between the footpoints will increase , but at a lower rate than when they were in parallel lanes . this starting point can be seen in fig . [ dist ] , where we consider the footpoint distance as a function of time . the time is known as when the two footpoints are located , both in the 3d ( circles ) and in the 2d magnetograms ( circles ) . during the first few years of the loop evolution , the distance between the footpoints increased , at a rate of 2 . 5 km s @ xmath3 . now , the relative distance of the footpoints is 2 . 5 km s @ xmath3 , a rate consistent with the location of the ring structure . the # ##ity of the distance with time is a characteristic feature of the loops and means that they do not have a side - walk ( otherwise the distance would increase by the square root of time ) . towards the end of the loop , the separation rate goes down , consistent with the location of the footpoints to intergranular lanes . thus , the points rooted in the plane and the vertical coordinate axes of the footstraight up to the two intergranular points , where the lines form and separate them . when this happens , the length of the footpoints is about 4000 m . at @ xmath64 s , the footpoints are clearly visible in the h magnetogram and show downflows in the h dopplergram . the entire loop is visible because the footpoints continue to grow . however , no brightenings are seen in the h filtergrams . we notice in detail that a double point appears in the fov at this point , very close to the point of origin of the structures we are studying in detail . they have a large h component in all the directions , which makes them difficult to detect . at @ xmath65 s , the loop has reached the limit since we have no large brightenings associated with the footpoints ( in fig . [ ej1 _ crom2 ] , the lines have been replaced with h for simplicity ) . the ends of the loop also show downflows in the h dopplergrams and , for the first part , the ##ening is detected in the cn ##ov of the location of the footpoints . the second part of fig . [ e##j1 _ crom2 ] shows the rest of the loop sequence . the negative footpoint is very weak , although it still shows downflows at the point of intersection of the first loop . it will mix with the high point , along with the low , at the end of the loop . the positive footpoint is of a linear component , with whom it will eventually mix . the negative footpoint shows downflows and is associated with a weak spot , too . these effects will cause the disappearance of the footpoint due to the mixing with the network element . in this example we have a good example of a loop which does not have chromospheric components and thus are low - quality . # [ ej1 _ nocrom ] shows all the loop sequences for this loop ( ml23 ) , just as in fig . [ ej1 _ crom ] . in the above example , a patch of linear components is shown to be at the end of the loop ( see the right image ) . the footpoints can also be seen in the intergranular region , but they are very weak . at this point the photospheric network element shows a patch of upflows at the end of the sequence ,see the figure above the solar atmosphere . at @ xmath66 s the loop reaches its maximum depth ( 520 nm ) . the upflows continue to weaken . the positive pressure and the negative pressure gradient are all gone by @ xmath67 s . in the next section , at @ xmath68 s , the loop is no longer present . the disappearance of the loop is so sudden that it appears and disappears twice in the same time . however , the footpoints still touch each other . this rules out being in the solar atmosphere as the cause of the loop disappearance . all the loops that remain in the atmosphere have very different patterns . in general , the disappear very quickly , but not far from the region where they originated . some of these patterns produce downflows in the ir band and brightenings in the cn ##o ir filtergrams . in the previous section we have shown that large - scale magnetic fields from the same region can travel through the atmosphere and reach the region where the outer edge of the + 517 . 5 spectral band has disappeared . all of them can produce significant temperature changes . in this section , the question also arises as to the maximum extent that these effects can reach . are they ?to observe the upper atmosphere or just the atmosphere ? " we use the h @ xmath18 observations of the gas to give a simple answer to this question . unfortunately , there is much overlap between the _ hinode _ and dot observations because of different observing conditions . however , for each of the loops observed by _ there is one observation from the dot . we use these observations to try to understand the transition of the gas to the upper atmosphere . the analysis is not straightforward and must be done with euv and x - ray techniques due to the presence of strong cloud formation in the upper atmosphere . the transition observed both by _ hinode _ and the dot ( ml20 ) started on june 1 , 2007 , at 09 : 06 utc . in fig . [ ej2 _ crom _ todos ] we observe the transition in the pressure / temperature range , in the 630 . 5 nm optical band , and the corresponding magnetograms ( first and second figure , right ) . the figure also shows h @ xmath18 line center filtergrams , as well as h @ xmath18 dopplergrams of @ xmath20 and @ xmath19 from line centers . if thestarting at the point where the @ xmath18 is located , it should first appear in the third column , then in the fourth , and finally in the sixth . the loop appears as a small spot of linear light on the surface of the plate ( @ xmath69 s , not visible ) . its time evolution is similar to that of the loop described just above . [ ej1 _ crom ] . the footpoints of the loop are visible in the sp for the first time at @ xmath70 s . the loop also shows upflows in the layer 1 end - point region , showing the loop . however , the negative footpoint is close to the center of the fov formed by the sp and it disappears from the photospheric map . the loop is visible in the b magnetograms at @ xmath71 s . at this point there is linear light in the negative footpoint and linear light in the positive column . at @ xmath65 s the footpoints leave the magnetogram ##s and the distance between them is greatly increased . the return of the loop to the sp is associated with downflows in the b dopplergram and brightenings inthe caiih line - core images . the and ##i loops begin to appear at @ xmath72 , until the signal emerges simultaneously from the low and the high photospheric regions . the h @ xmath18 line core images and the dopplergrams do not show any physical structure that could be associated with the appearence of the optical field strength of the loop . it is important to note that the average separation between the footpoints of this loop is about 760 nm . it may well be that a larger distance was required for the tip of the loop to reach the low region . in addition , the surface tension would prevent the field strength from increasing . keeping in mind these considerations , we do not expect that the loops with larger diameter will be visible in the h @ xmath18 images . in this section we examine the physical structure of the large - scale optical loops , with _ _ loops and loops located adjacent to other loop segments or in other regions being removed from the data to improve the quality of the data . this leaves us with 48 loops , which represent 40 % of the total data . the [ tabla ] shows the physical structure of the loops , their characteristics ( @ xmath##73 ) , the distance between footpoints ( @ xmath74 ) , time at which the footpoints interact , ( @ xmath75 ) , the magnetic lifetime ( @ xmath76 ) and maximum flux density ( @ xmath77 ) of the loop , estimates of the magnetic signature present at the time of formation of the closed loop ( @ xmath78 ) , and an estimate of the magnetic downflows observed in the two dopplergrams ( @ xmath79 ) . the lifetime is the time taken between the arrival and departure of the magnetic signature . when two parameters are used , the first is the time taken until one of the footpoints intersects with a different magnetic signature . the second is the time of contact observed ; if it is caused by another event , then the magnetic signatures of the two are not present at the end of the lifetime . to calculate the total magnetic lifetime we define the footpoints as those points where the flux density is greater than @ xmath80 , the radius of the loop . the value of @ xmath81 shown in the [ tabla ] is the maximum flux density at .of the footpoints during the # ##ing , and the result of the error in @ xmath81 caused by the error . the first two columns of the [ tabla ] show the time interval between the arrival of the electrons in the nucleus and their arrival in the c magnetograms , the c dopplergrams , the x - scan images , and the cn filtergrams . we assume that a process is initiated in each of these images when at least one of the footpoints shows up correctly . the two columns in each image correspond to the positive footpoint ( left ) and the negative one ( right ) . cccccccccccccc ##cc & t & t @ xmath82 & @ xmath83 ##t & t @ xmath84 & @ xmath85 & @ xmath86 & @ xmath87 & @ xmath88 & @ xmath89 & @ xmath83t @ xmath90 & @ xmath83t @ xmath91 & @ xmath83t @ xmath92 & @ xmath83t @ xmath93 + & (09 / 07 ) & ( mx ) & ( s ) & ( mx ) & ( km / s ) & ( s ) & ( mx / @ xmath94 ) & ( mx / @ xmath94 ) & ( km / s ) & ( s ) & ( mx ) & ( s ) & ( mx ) + ml01 & 25 & 13 : 36 : 45 & 240 & 800 & 0 . 5 & 3 . 6 @ xmath9510 @ xmath9610 @ xmath97 & @ xmath98 & & & & & & + ml02 & 25 & 13 : 36 : 45 & 12 / 1020 & 1220 & 0 . 5 & 3 . 6 @ xmath9510 @ xmath9910 @ xmath97 & @ xmath100 & & & & & & + ml03 & 25 & 13 : 36 : 45 & 330 & 560 & 0 . 5 & 0 . 5 @ xmath9510 @ xmath9610 @ xmath97 & @ xmath101 & & & & & & + ml04 & 25 & 13 : 36 : 45 &1 / 480 & 690 & 1 . 0 & 1 . 0 @ xmath9510 @ xmath9610 @ xmath97 & @ xmath102 & & & & & & + ml05 & & & 13 : 45 : 15 & 240 & 790 & 1 . 0 & 1 . 1 @ xmath9510 @ xmath10310 @ xmath97 & @ xmath104 & & & & & & + ml06 & 25 & 13 : 45 : 15 & 90 & 910 & 3 . 5 & 3 . 5 @ xmath9510 @ xmath10510 @ xmath106 & @ xmath107 & & & & & & + ml07 & & & 13 : 45 : 15 & 120 & 490 & 3 . 5 & 3 . 5 @ xmath9510 @ xmath10810 @ xmath106 & @ xmath109 & & & & & & + ml08 & 25 & 13 : 36 : 15 & 630 & 800 & 3 . 5 & 3 . 5 @ xmath9510 @ xmath9610@ xmath97 & @ xmath110 & & & & & & + ml09 & & & 14 : 39 : 00 & 960 / 1200 & 4000 & 1 . 2 & 1 . 5 @ xmath9510 @ xmath10310 @ xmath97 & @ xmath111 & 1 . 5 @ xmath112 & -

13 . 0 * & * 295 * & * 406 * & * 513 * & * 514 * + + as can be seen in the [ tabla ] , there is a wide range of loop sizes . the sizes range from about 10 min ##s to 200 m , although most of the loops close in less than 10 minutes . the horizontal distance between the footpoints is a simple function of the density and ranges from @ xmath142 * to 4000 m . the loops have physical dimensions equal to , or greater than , those of spheres . therefore , they can be regarded as stable and capable of maintaining the stability of the surrounding material for a very long time . the initial velocity of particles between the footpoints does not seem to have any relationship with the other parameters listed in the table . distances of 0 . 5 to 1 m for @ xmath3 are typical . as previously mentioned , the initial velocity tends to decrease when the footpoints enter the intergranular zone , probably because the forces involved are not as strong as in the case of closed loops . the strong magnetic field present in the inter##points : from @ xmath143 to @ xmath144 points , the density of energy of the 630 nm peak region , is lower than the rest of it . this may be an artifact caused by the complex nature of ml24 and the complex magnetic structure with which it deals . ] . however , the loops have lower density than the loops and should be located at the lower end of the flux density range in the active region . the magnetic flux density of the footpoints is about 2040 / 2 @ xmath3 . to determine the magnetic field strength from the magnetic flux density , we need to know the filling factor of the field lines that traverse the loop , and their lengths . the footpoints should be very small because of space constraints . assuming that the loops cover most of the active region , i . e . , that the magnetic filling factor is close to unity the field strength of the loops can be estimated to be of about 10 - 15 % . only if the filling factor is much greater than unity would the field strength increase to # ##² , so we consider this scenario only in terms of g . [ hist _ # _ 1 ] . an interesting observation is that 95 % of the loops are located in theb magnetograms make their appearance in the sky ( 16 times out of 17 ) . it takes an average of 10 minutes for the loop to climb from the ground to the point at which the a loops occur , although smaller and smaller loops have been observed since . all the loops seen in the b magnetograms experience downflows at the same time . in addition , 80 % of the loops are seen as bright spots in the line - core filtergrams . this means that an important part of the magnetic field that goes into the atmosphere is the loop . as they move upward , the loops are seen in the magnetograms , the b magnetograms , the h dopplergrams , the h line - core filters , and the cn filtergrams ( in this case ) . in addition , 20 % of the loops only make it to the atmosphere . we have been unable to determine the factors determining whether the magnetic field will rise or fall . this includes the total magnetic flux and the magnetic flux density . however , high - density loops tend to have periods greater than 100 km and depths greater than 100 km . or it could simply be that they do not last long .to achieve higher temperature conditions . further research is still needed to understand why a large portion of the structures are low - temperature . however , the relationship between these structures and the induced magnetic fields generated by @ xcite should be clear , given their long duration and physical properties . the experiments described above show that magnetic fields can extend into the upper - atmosphere in the form of large - scale loops , suggesting the existence of @ xcite and @ xcite . the loops are represented by a pair of linear behaviors and by two circular magnetic signals of equal frequency . in almost all the cases the linear behavior appeared earlier and at the same time than the corresponding @ xmath24 signal , as would be expected from @ xmath0 - type signals passing through the atmosphere . but in two cases out of three , we detected linear behavior after the loop has completely disappeared . in those cases , the footpoints are opposite each other . this behavior is associated with a loop that forms and then disappears in the atmosphere , associated with a ` ` magnetic network ' ' , i . e . , a network of magnetic field lines . the long duration of our experiment here has permitted us to demonstrate the existence of magnetic systems in which such loops exist .or the other . for example , there is the @ xmath146 region of the solar system where we have observed 32 loops in a time period of 1 year . the complete set of data from this region is available as an pdf file in the online version of the astronomical journal . some of the loops may occur in the exact same region . the example shown in fig . [ ej1 _ crom ] belongs to this group . the existence of magnetic loops may have important implications for the evolution of the universe . these loops act as temporary sources of magnetic flux that are brought up to the surface by an as yet unkwnown mechanism . the loops usually appear as stars when at their brightest , although there are some of them appearing in dark regions . as the loops grow the footpoints decrease and the linear component fades away . in some cases , the footpoints do not follow linear paths . the [ trayectorias ] are the path followed by the linear components of the loops observed on january 11 , 2007 ( labeled ml09 to ml17 in the figure below ) . the resulting loops correspond to the ones shown in fig . [ ej1 _ crom ] . thethis means the footpoints will have a complex pattern , corresponding to both permanent regions and temporary regions . however , the majority of loops have very simple patterns . the first is that , in general , they originate from , and move toward the nearest intergranular space . when the footpoints reach the intergranular space they remain stationary and are not absorbed into the fluid . this produces complex patterns . the important thing , however , is that the magnetic flux is too small _ to be absorbed and carried forward in the fluid _ , _ _ without being lost in the flow _ . the loops are active during all their lifetime , even if the underlying structure does not change . during their lifetime , the loops interact with the magnetic flux ##es that crosses their path . if the loops remain active in the flow , the footpoints interact with patches of opposite orientation and are replaced by patches of the same orientation . loops that have a slow rotation have high probability of absorbing the magnetic flux and thus remain without undergoing any changes . in determining the lifetime of the loops it is of importance to determine the magnetic properties of their footpoints . if the loops are generated by the applied magnetic field, we would expect a random orientation of the footpoints at the point of entry . this is what happens in active regions , where the orientation of the leader and follower signs are determined by hale s rules ( ) , e . g . , * ? ? ? . the regions mentioned above were in the northern hemisphere during solar cycle 23 . in that case , leader signs were positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern hemisphere . figure [ 1 ] gives a picture of the orientation of our large - scale active regions . the orientation angle is assumed to be the angle between the celestial equator and the line connecting the positive footpoint with the negative one , away from the equator . the values associated with the orientation of leader signs during solar cycle 23 in the northern hemisphere are those between 270 and 270 @ xmath147 . even if the sample size is not very large , the signs tend to have very random orientation . therefore , we assume that they do not follow hale s ' rules , much in the same way as the long - term active regions @ xcite . the observations of hanle - sensitive lines @ xcite and smith - sensitive lines @ xcite show that a large portion of the southern hemisphere is active .magnetic disks . typically , these disks are large and evenly distributed in radius @ xcite . one way to shed light on their origin is to understand how they emerge from the disk and what their contribution is to the energy balance of the solar system . in these disks , magnetic flux occurs throughout the solar system in large magnetic loops @ xcite and small - scale magnetic loops @ xcite . we have studied the phenomenon in detail using error - correction images provided by _ hinode _ . within 24 hours of _ hinode _ , we have observed two small - scale loops emerging from a single magnetic disk of radius @ xmath148 the same size . the flux rate is ~ 0 . 02 % per @ xmath3 and @ xmath1 . the loops have unusual spectropolarimetric properties with a central patch of circular # and small clusters of secondary patches of circular ##ity . the magnetic flux rate at each footpoint varies from @ xmath143 to @ xmath144 mx , with an average of @ xmath149 mx . this indicates that the loops are the fastest moving magnetic disks observed to date ( all regions with flux > 1 @ xmath##150 ##5 ; zwaan 1987 ) . the rate at which the energy is transferred to the upper atmosphere through the loops can be estimated to be @ xmath151 / , @ xmath3 , @ xmath1 , and @ xmath152 m from the solar surface per second . this is about double the rate estimated by lites et al . ( 1996 ) for the internetwork loops , but still higher ( see @ xcite for a comparison with the observed transmission rates of active and passive loops ) . in the b , the magnetic field associated with the entrance of the loop disappears rapidly , and the magnetic fields in the lower atmosphere are observed to increase with time . this pattern is consistent with transmission lines moving upward in the upper atmosphere . both the upflows , and the low zero - - point values at the top of the footpoints indicate the nature of the loop . 90 % of the loops are detected in the magnetograms that cover the upper atmosphere above the solar transition point ( say , 10 ##° above the solar boundary layer ) . there is a time delay of about 10 ms between the first loop in the b and the start of the hmagnetograms , with an average resolution of the order of 1 . @ xmath3 . most of the loops appear to move upward and are visible in the side - scan filtergrams with small frequency fluctuations . however , a few of the loops are able to reach the solar corona , carrying magnetic fields with them . the use of small - scale magnetic fields could be an effective way to transport large amounts of energy from the sun to the corona . this would support claims by @ xcite and @ xcite that the magnetic fields of the early stars carry enough energy to reach the corona . a key question is whether the small - scale loops rise up to the transition zone or to the corona . the methods used to answer this question are extremely difficult due to the high spatial resolution associated with present day uv , euv , and x - ray observations , and should be considered . about 90 % of the loops that form on the lunar surface make it to the corona . these loops have the longest wavelengths and have the highest footpoint brightness ; other than that , they do not differ from those in their frequencies . instead , they remain close to their origin point . the structures associated with these loops may explain thethe second hypothesis was derived from hanle and @ xcite , but a definite conclusion could not be reached without testing the validity of hanle and his colleagues . what is the origin of the small - scale flux loops ? one possibility is that they are generated by the magnetic field at the top of the convection zone , as part of a large scale flux tube . @ xcite provided three - dimensional mhd images of the first stage of the formation of the flux loop . they showed a flux tube at the top of the convection zone , directly above the dynamo . when the applied magnetic field is greater than @ xmath15310 @ xmath150 ##2 , the tube is far too large to hold up against the convective fields and currents . at the poles , the phenomenon of flux ##ing occurs at both long time scales ( ~ 1000 - 2000 m ) and short time scales ( 10 m ) . these observations are consistent with our observations . however , the small - scale loops we have observed may simply be the result of the flux loops generated by the dynamo as they move from the convection zone into the atmosphere . the origin of the loops may explain why there are flux ##s where they occur at theand the rings . a detailed analysis of the footpoint data shows that the loops do not have a tendency to be aligned according to the s law . this may be seen as a theoretical argument against the assumption that the source of the loop is the solar wind . however , it may also be a possible result of the interaction of the ring - structure with the near - surface mantle , if it contains all the energy sent out of the loop . another possibility is that the magnetic loops are flux flows from the quiet regions . in this case , the mhd simulations of abbett ( 2007 ) , @ xcite , and @ xcite ##s are a scenario , because all of them have an induced magnetic field in the black holes which could be generated by the charged particles . in the simulations , the particles interact and interact with the flux flow . this interaction produces a large amount of magnetic flux , even if the magnetic field is not horizontal . thus , the simulations show the existence of magnetic loops on the surfaces . the loops are less dense than the flux flows and do not respond to the magnetic field directly . in this case , the magnetic field of the quiet regions , and thus the magnetic flux we have observed , would be the result of the field acting onthe formation of " surface ice . " another possibility is that the loops represent the surface magnetic fields brought to the surface by the internal winds of planets or by atmospheric convection , as suggested by @ xcite . but in that case , the nature of the magnetic fields would be unknown . therefore , we do not have the theoretical basis to distinguish between a closed loop and an ` ` external ' ' magnetic field ##es ##p from the planetary system . understanding the nature of the magnetic fields observed in internetwork loops is essential for a better understanding of the nature of the early atmosphere and its role in the formation of the upper atmosphere . future research should focus on the resolution of these problems . in addition to high - resolution photospheric measurements , optical measurements of the atmosphere are recquired to determine the evolution of the atmosphere with time . these measurements can also be obtained with three - dimensional telescopes like galileo , isis , and imax . we thank andrs asensio ramos , alain dmoulin and rafael manso sainz for their technical assistance , and vronique bommier for our reading the paper . we are grateful to all the scientists who participated in the _ hinode _ _ _ b , and .isas / jaxa and for the ground - based telescopes . special thanks were given to suguru kamio ( naoj ) for leading the project and to jan stterlin ( leiden university ) for taking the results at the dutch open university and publishing them . hinode is a joint project developed and managed by isas / jaxa , with naoj as the domestic partner , and nasa and stfc ( france ) as international partners . it is managed by these partners in collaboration with esa and nor ( norway ) . most of this work was carried out while one of us ( mjmg ) was a visiting scientist at the instituto de astrofsica de andaluca . we have also support from the organization micinn through projects esp2006 - 13030 - c06 - 02 , pci2006 - a7 - 0624 , and aya2007 - 63881 , and from universidad de andaluca through project p07 - tep - 2687 . , s . , bellot rubio , j . m . , del toro iniesta , j . m . , tsuneta , t . , lites , j . m . , ichimoto , t . , katsukawa, t . , nagata , t . , shimizu , t . , smith , t . j . , suematsu , t . , smith , t . j . , & smith , t . m . 2007 , apj , 670 , .
