[ xrd ] ) can be compared with the reference thcr @ xmath3si @ xmath3 ##as shown , with the coordinates @ xmath58 and @ xmath##59 , in close agreement with those described in ref . . the t - 1 measurements were made on samples with an energy value of 1 oe at 1111 k . the resulting data ( ref . [ chiac ] ) show the properties of atoms and of the structure at @ xmath60 ##0 . @ xcite first - order dft calculations of the atomic masses were performed using the large - scale , nonlinear s - matrix method , available in the software called @ xcite . for the cross - correlation calculations we used the density matrix method of perdew , smith , and ernzerhof @ xcite . the atomic masses used in the calculations are those obtained from high temperature x - ray spectroscopy . in order to determine the electric field strength ( efg ) tensor at @ xmath61 we used the poisson equation for the charge distribution to calculate the electric potential @ xmath62 and of @ xmath61 from @ xmath63 where @ xmath64 averaged with the value of @ xmath65 . since the efg tensor is highly correlated to the charge distribution a highly sophisticated data set was required to determine theconvergence with respect to the efg tensor components . we replaced the corresponding values of 2 . 5 @ xmath66 for al and 2 . 6 @ xmath66 for fe and si , with @ xmath67 , where @ xmath68 is the total of n ( n ) particles and the # ##s and @ xmath69 the sum of the reciprocal space components . we used this for the round ##up of the angular momentum correlation ##s in the spherical coordinates section of the figure . reciprocal space was used with the monkhorst - paxton @ xcite grid and the @ xmath70 grid . a value of 270 mev was used with the methfessel - schmidt grid @ xcite and convergence of the efg tensor with respect to all these components has been successfully calculated . once the efg tensor components are calculated the nqr values for @ xmath0as and @ xmath1rb can be obtained from fig . 2 in the main article . the corresponding values , ( @ xmath71 ) @ xmath72 4 . 5 , and ( @ xmath73 ) @ xmath72 3 .these frequencies are in close agreement with the resonance frequencies ( @ xmath71 ) @ xmath7414 . 5 mhz and ( @ xmath73 ) @ xmath74 ##4 . 5 mhz and the difference is an indication of the accuracy of the dft measurements which is likely to not fully account for the crystal structure . @ xmath0as nqr and @ xmath1rb ##r spectra were obtained by measuring the phase of the echo signal of the @ xmath75 ##a pulse as a function of the resonance frequency . at a higher temperatures the @ xmath0as nqr spectrum was also obtained by measuring the fourier transforms of some of the signals emitted at these temperatures . several interesting physical properties appear in the spectrum . we found out that a large number of the phases in feas and in @ xmath3as ( as seen in x - ray spectra ) do not match the @ xmath0as nqr spectrum since these phases are not stable and the magnetic field shifts the resonance frequency to much lower frequencies . whereas in feas @ xmath3 the @ xmath0as nqr spectrum appears .a slightly different frequency response . @ xcite the central @ xmath13rb nqr data was derived from the fourier transform of half of the echo amplitude ##s from the central @ pulse sequence . @ xmath1rb . the spectrum for the central @ xmath76 pulse is shown in fig . [ rbnmr ] . the spectrum was also compared with the @ xmath1rb quadrupole spectrum derived from the nqr data . @ xmath0as spin - lattice relaxation rate @ xmath40 was derived from nqr data taking the half of the echo amplitude @ xmath77 from the @ xmath75 pulse sequence . the data could be compared in series with @ xmath78 with @ xmath79 . the value of @ xmath80 greater than 1 and the corresponding phase change of @ xmath81 ( fig . [ figt2 ] ) should be compared with redfield prior to the central @ xmath82 . then we can calculate @ xmath83 , with @ xmath40 the spin - lattice relaxation rate . in terms of an anysotropic spin - lattice relaxation rate , et ##h _. @ xcite gives a new formula for @ xmath84 . in case of a single crystal @ xmath16 , with the @ xmath85 rotation of the efg about the @ xmath86 axis one should get : @ xmath87 where the indices @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 correspond to the magnetic field strength with respect to the crystallographic @ xmath86 axis . in particular , @ xmath90 corresponds to @ xmath0as nqr @ xmath14 . @ xmath91 was calculated by finding an error in @ xmath14 similar to the one found in co - fabricated bafe @ xmath3as @ xmath3 @ xcite . after the errors have been corrected by redfield , one finds that @ xmath0as @ xmath40 is spin stable ( cf . [ figt2 ] ) , with @ xmath92 . the deviation of @ xmath93 from equilibrium , as it is observed in the case of a spin system in a magnetic medium @ xcite , as a result of the thermal expansion of thenqr ] . taking into account of @ xmath94 , we also confirmed the @ xmath95 - axis of @ xmath0as nqr spectrum was within 1 % and did not show any significant changes . @ xmath1rb / @ xmath14 was measured in the @ xmath96 k - field , measuring only the high - end of the spectrum instead of the central line as in fig . [ rbnmr ] , corresponding to measurements with the @ xmath86 - axis perpendicular to @ xmath97 . the recovery of @ xmath1rb / central line spectrum after the first period in vacuum was measured perpendicular to @ xmath98 the result is shown in fig . [ t1rbnmr ] and one sample , similar to what was observed in @ xmath0as nqr , with components present at room temperature . the slow component was measured only in vacuum since at nqr the very weak @ xmath1rb spectrum and the much higher neutron flux made the measurement more difficult . the fast component , the only component present in @ xmath99 ##6 , was measuredand nqr for either @ xmath1rb @ xmath100 , or @ xmath2rb @ xmath101 . the distribution of nuclear spin is determined according to the recovery laws : for the magnetic relaxation mechanism @ xcite @ xmath102 for @ xmath1rb and for @ xmath2rb . the ratio between the @ xmath14 of the two nuclei for the magnetic relaxation mechanism was measured at a carefully controlled temperature between 20 and 30 °c and @ xmath104 ( cf . [ t1rbnqr ] ) , in perfect agreement with the ratio between the square of the gyromagnetic moment of the two nuclei @ xmath43 , and the square of the recovery laws we have used to determine @ xmath14 and the probability that the relaxation was driven by nuclear spin fluctuations . note that if the relaxation was driven by efg then @ xmath14 should agree with the value of the nuclear spin quadrupole , and we should find @ xmath105 a is about 10 times higher than the previous one . we also determine the spin fluctuations of @ xmath0as @ xmath##14 modified the nqr . by recording the amplitude of the radiofrequency , showed that we had a frequency of about 30 khz across the spectrum . we found that the decay amplitude did not vary significantly across the spectrum ( fig . [ t1vsfreq ] ) . however , @ xmath31 , @ xmath32 , @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 showed a strong temperature dependence . it should be noted that @ xmath32 and @ xmath31 seem to strongly depend on the radiation frequency ( i . e . , the decay period ) , an effect that will be the focus of future research . finally , we also found that @ xmath32 , the amplitude of the first decay mode , was constant at 30 khz , measuring the amplitude down to less than @ xmath106 @ xmath39 ( fig . [ t1vsfreq ] ) .
