let @ xmath0 be an open surface of finite dimension , i . e . @ xmath0 be a closed surface of type @ xmath1 from which @ xmath2 points , so - called _ spheres _ , have been removed . we assume that @ xmath3 , i . e . that @ xmath0 is either a sphere with at most @ xmath7 points or a sphere with at most @ xmath8 points . we then call the surface @ xmath0 _ nonexceptional _ . since the prime characteristic of @ xmath0 is zero , the _ teichmller action _ @ xmath9 of @ xmath0 is the multiplication of the space of all _ forms of @ xmath0 by the multiplication of the space of diffeomorphisms of @ xmath0 which are mapped to the sphere . the unit vector bundle @ xmath10 → @ xmath9 of all _ holomorphic _ forms _ of type _ can also be written as the unit vector bundle of @ xmath9 for the _ teichml##ler _ _ . the _ teichmller _ flow _ @ xmath5 _ @ xmath10 agrees with the definition of the _ equivalence relation _ _ @ xmath11 of _ isotopy classes of curvature of self - homeomorphisms of @ xmath0 . then this flow reduces to a flow on the manifold @ xmath12 , as defined by @ xmath5 . for a stable differential @ xmath13 define the _ stable manifold _ @ xmath14 to be the set of all stable differential whose horizontal measured differential flow is a subset of the vertical measured differential flow for @ xmath15 . then @ xmath16 is a submanifold of @ xmath10 which maps homeomorphically onto @ xmath9 @ xcite . similarly , define the _ horizontal stable manifold _ @ xmath17 to be the set of all stable differential whose horizontal measured differential flow agrees with the vertical measured differential flow of @ xmath15 . the functions @ xmath16 ( ( @ xmath17 ) @ xmath18 ) .a subset of @ xmath10 which is equal to the equivalence relation , and which corresponds to the set ##ity _ @ xmath4 which we call the _ stable measure _ ( or the _ _ stable measure _ ) . there is an @ xmath5 - invariant stable measure @ xmath19 on @ xmath4 called the lebesgue measure , which was introduced by masur @ xcite ( see also the papers @ xcite of veech which have a similar definition ) . this measure is not invariant with respect to the strong measure and the singular measure , it is changing and increasing , and its maximum value is @ xmath6 ( note that we have a definition for the teichmller measure which differs from the one in @ xcite ) . de avila , gouzel and yoccoz @ xcite proved that the lebesgue measure @ xmath20 on the vector space of _ abelian _ groups is finite and large , i . e . the space of measures for hlder observables , . the proof of this result uses the fact , also known to athreya @ xcite , that theteichmller flow _ _ _ converge _ to a compact compact set , i . e . there exists a compact set @ xmath21 and a set @ xmath22 such that @ xmath23 for every @ xmath24 \ } < [ ^ { -

stable flows on @ xmath27 given by the boundary conditions for the flows @ xmath26 form an uncountable family of @ xmath5 - invariant probability measures on @ xmath4 including the lebesgue measure . we describe their properties as follows . there is an uncountable family of @ xmath5 - invariant probability measures on @ xmath4 including the lebesgue measure which are stable , are stable with respect to the - measure and the unstable measures and which areis not proportional to any compact subset . denote by @ xmath29 the teichmller metric of @ xmath9 . for a single point @ xmath30 and a point @ xmath31 , the _ poincar series _ of the mapping class group with zero @ xmath32 and basepoint @ xmath33 is defined to be the smallest @ xmath34 the _ conway series _ of @ xmath11 is the infimum of all points @ xmath35 such that the poincar series with zero @ xmath32 equals @ xcite . for a compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 and for @ xmath37 let @ xmath38 be the set of all points for the teichmller metric _ of @ xmath4 of order at least @ xmath39 which equals @ xmath36 . we have . 1 . the elliptic integral of the mapping class group is @ xmath6 , and the poincar series comes from @ xmath6 . 2 . for a sufficiently large compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 wethus @ xmath40 = 0 is an extension of the previous result of bufetov @ xcite , with a similar formula . even earlier , veech @ xcite proved a similar result for _ of _ periodic orbits of the teichmller flow . now , denote by @ xmath41 the set of _ periodic orbits for the teichmller flow with @ xmath4 of genus at least @ xmath39 . veech proved the existence of a set @ xmath42 such that @ xmath43 as a result of step 1 , we show that we can find @ xmath44 which is completely different from the expected set @ xmath6 . on the other hand , for @ xcite we have for every set @ xmath0 of sets @ xmath45 with @ xmath46 , and @ xmath47 and for every compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 a periodic orbit for @ xmath5 which does not contain @ xmath36 . thus if @ xmath47 and for every compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 we have @ xmath48 foris also bounded @ xmath39 ( based on @ xmath36 ) . then eskin and mirzakhani proved that the exponential part of the flow is bounded @ xmath6 . the rest of the proof is as follows . in section 2 we consider the properties of train tracks and the information needed for the proof . in section 3 we use the _ _ _ _ of @ xmath0 to show that the restriction of the teichmller flow to a compact open subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 is a bounded set in the euclidean space . in section 4 we use train tracks to compute a bounded subshift of finite type @ xmath26 . in section 5 we compute a bounded roof function @ xmath49 for our subshift of finite type and the quasi - conjugacy of the intersection of @ xmath26 with roof function @ xmath49 into the teichmller flow . this is used in section 6 to prove theorem 1 . in section 7 we compute the maximum value for @ xmath11 , and section 8 is devoted to the proof of the second part of theorem 1 . in this section we computesee references and references from @ xcite which will be cited in the article ( link to @ xcite ) . let @ xmath0 be an algebraic structure of which @ xmath1 with @ xmath2 , and where @ xmath3 . a minimal _ for a simple cubic structure on @ xmath0 of finite dimension is a _ minimal _ component of @ xmath0 which is divided into smaller parts . a _ component @ xmath19 is a _ minimal _ if each of its half -

measure is homeomorphic to @ xmath52 . _ projectiv##ization of the class @ xmath53 of the _ projective class _ support _ . there is a _ projective class @ xmath54 , the so - called _ intersection form _ , which is the _ intersection form of two finite sets . the _ projective class @ xmath55 _ fills up @ xmath0 _ if its support fills up @ xmath0 . the projectivization of a measured projective class which fills up @ xmath0 is also said to fill up @ xmath0 . the _ _ track _ line _ class @ xmath0 is an abstract 3 - d @ xmath56 whose vertices ( called _ branches _ ) are directed , with well - defined points ##s at the vertices . at each vertex ( called _ _ support _ ) the two branches are mutually pointing . each branch is unique . at each vertex there is a branch of length @ xmath57 which is contained in @ xmath58 and all the branches of its support . in addition , the branches which are directed at a given vertex are divided into ` ` incoming ' ' and ` ` outgoing ' ' branches according to their mutually pointing directions at the vertex . the _examples of the train track are discs , i . e . discs with two points at the boundary , and half - monogons , i . e . two overlapping discs with one point at the boundary . we can define train tracks which are maximal ( see @ xcite for a full article on train tracks ) . a half - train track is a maximal track @ xmath59 a _ carry _ _ the maximal track @ xmath58 if there is a map @ xmath60 of class @ xmath57 which is unique to the class and maps @ xmath59 into @ xmath58 in such a way that the restriction of the map of @ xmath61 to the tangent space of @ xmath59 holds everywhere ; note that this makes sense since the train track has a tangent space everywhere . we call the restriction of @ xmath61 to @ xmath59 a _ carry _ _ for @ xmath59 . for @ xmath62 if the maximal track of the maximal track @ xmath59 is carried by the maximal track @ xmath58 . a _ carry ._ . a maximal generic train track @ xmath58 is a continuous continuous function @ xmath63 of the domain of @ xmath58 satisfying the _ _ _ _ : for every branch @ xmath64 of @ xmath58 , the sum of the weights over all incoming branches at @ xmath64 is defined to coincide with the sum of the weights over all outgoing branches at @ xmath64 . the train track is _ _ positive _ if it admits a transverse measure which is positive on every branch . we call this a transverse measure @ xmath63 _ _ _ , and we define @ xmath65 . the set @ xmath66 of all transverse measures on @ xmath58 has the structure of a metric space . via the metric space , every maximal elliptic curve spanned by @ xmath58 admits a transverse measure on @ xmath58 , and a transverse measure is in this set @ xcite . _ @ xmath66 can also be identified with a subset of @ xmath50 which is invariant under multiplication . a maximal generic train track @ xmath58 is invariant if and only if the subset @ xmath66 of@ xmath50 has nonempty intersections . a _ positive measure _ @ xmath63 for a maximal generic train track @ xmath58 assigns to every branch @ xmath67 of @ xmath58 a _ measure @ xmath68 such that for every right intersection with branch @ xmath69 we have @ xmath70 ( values are taken modulo 2 ) . the space @ xmath71 of all positive measures on @ xmath58 has the structure of an intersection space . the maximal generic train track @ xmath58 is called _ _ _ _ if it has a normal measure @ xmath63 which is positive at every branch @ xcite . there is a one - to - one correspondence between the space of positive measures on @ xmath58 and the space of all the points which _ have @ xmath58 . _ ( we refer to @ xcite for an example of this correspondence ) . with this correspondence , the measure @ xmath72 induced by @ xmath73 is called the normal measure on @ xmath50 @ xcite . a maximal generic train track@ xmath58 is called _ large _ if it is complete and is symmetric . a half - branch @ xmath74 in a complete train track @ xmath58 incident on a switch @ xmath75 of @ xmath58 is called _ large _ if an entire arc of _ @ xmath57 crosses @ xmath75 and another arc passes through @ xmath74 . a half - branch which is _ small is called _ small _ . a branch @ xmath67 in a complete train track @ xmath58 is called _ large _ if each of its two half - branches is small ; in this case @ xmath67 is _ incident on two separate switches , and it is incident on one of them . a branch is called _ small _ if each of its two half - branches is small . a branch is called _ large _ if one of its half - branches is large and the other half - branch is small ( for all this , see @ xcite 1 . 118 ) . there are two possible ways to shift a complete train track @ xmath58 to a complete train track . first , we can _ shift _ @ xmath58 to thea reference to a train in @ xmath76 is shown in figure a above . if @ xmath58 is constant then the converse is true for @ xmath76 . first , a train track in a line is carried by @ xmath58 if and only if it is carried by @ xmath76 ( or @ xcite 1 . 119 ) . in particular , the branch @ xmath76 of @ xmath58 is carried by @ xmath58 . note that there is a natural bijection of the set of branches of @ xmath58 onto the set of branches of @ xmath76 . second , if @ xmath77 is a right split of @ xmath58 then we can have a right _ left _ split _ of @ xmath58 and @ xmath77 as shown in figure a . note that the right split of @ xmath77 is not carried by the orientation of @ xmath0 and does not depend on the orientation of @ xmath77 . using the notation in the figure , in the case of a right split we have the branches @ xmath78 and @ xmat##h79 _ winners _ of the split , and the branches @ xmath80 are _ losers _ of the split . if we choose a random number , then the branches @ xmath80 are winners of the split , and the branches @ xmath81 are losers of the split . the diagonal @ xmath76 of the train track @ xmath58 is represented by @ xmath58 , and there is a natural extension of the transfer function which maps the switches of @ xmath76 to the switches of @ xmath58 . there is a natural bijection of the set of switches of @ xmath58 onto the set of branches of @ xmath76 which maps the diagonal @ xmath77 to the diagonal @ xmath82 of the split . the geometry of the complete train track is continuous , or symmetric and continuous , but it need not be continuous . in the sequel we carry onto @ xmath83 the set of isotopy classes of complete train tracks _ @ xmath0 . in this sequel we apply teichmller geometry and the teichmller topology to the geometry of the _ _ _ _ @xmath84 of @ xmath0 . this curve graph is a topological graph whose elements are the free homotopy classes of _ essential _ simple closed curves on @ xmath0 , i . e . curves which are neither contractible nor free homotopic into a subset of @ xmath0 . in the following we also do not distinguish between an essential simple closed curve and a free homotopy class whenever the latter is present . all topological curves are connected on @ xmath84 by an arc of length 2 if and only if they can be connected disjointly . since our graph @ xmath0 is nonexceptional by definition , the curve on @ xmath84 is unique . the _ cycles @ xmath85 of length at most 2 _ _ make up @ xmath0 _ , i . e . they turn @ xmath0 into topological discs and also into topological curves . by bers ##in , there is a graph @ xmath86 such that for every _ topological decomposition of @ xmath0 of finite dimension there is a _ topological decomposition _ of @ xmath0 _ of @ xmath87 .open curves of length at most @ xmath88 . then , for a fixed constant @ xmath89 , the subset _ @ xmath84 of the ( non - empty ) set of all the closed curves on @ xmath0 of length at most @ xmath90 is bounded from above by a lower bound as defined on @ xmath90 ( and on the algebraic structure of @ xmath0 ) . so in the following , denote by @ xmath10 the space of partial derivatives of degree 1 , teichmller space @ xmath9 . by first taking our function @ xmath86 ##0 , we can show that for every @ xmath13 there is an open simple closed curve on @ xmath0 whose _ @ xmath15 - _ _ , i . e . the characteristic polynomial of the subgroup of the group homotopy group of @ xmath32 with respect to the standard group metric given by @ xmath15 , is at most @ xmath88 ( see @ xcite and section 1 . 2 of @ xcite ) . thus we can define the function @ xmath91for corresponding to a simple differential @ xmath15 a simple closed curve @ xmath92 whose @ xmath15 - length is at most @ xmath88 . by theorem 2 . 1 of @ xcite , if @ xmath93 is a given point of such a curve , we have @ xmath94 for all @ xmath13 where @ xmath29 is the identity point on @ xmath84 . then we obtain the constant @ xmath95 by corresponding to a simple differential @ xmath45 and @ xmath0 of finite length a simple closed curve @ xmath79 of @ xmath45 - length at most @ xmath88 . see the article of @ xcite there is a constant @ xmath96 such that @ xmath97 and @ xmath98 be the orthogonal group . by theorem 2 . 2 of @ xcite ( see in the article of rafi @ xcite ) , we have . [ simple2 ] there is a constant @ xmath99 such that @ xmath100 for all @ xmath13 . for_ strong differential @ xmath13 the _ strong _ manifold _ @ xmath101 is defined as the limit of _ strong differential of the manifold whose projective measured boundary boundary intersects _ line _ with the projective measured boundary boundary of @ xmath15 . the _ strong stable _ manifold @ xmath102 is given by @ xmath103 where @ xmath104 is the _ boundary _ @ xmath105 . the differential @ xmath106 which reduces to a strong differential on _ projective measured boundary boundary corresponds to the homeomorphism of @ xmath102 onto the _ contractible boundary of @ xmath53 of the projective measured boundary surfaces @ xmath63 which intersects with @ xmath107 _ , cancel out @ xmath0 _ , i . e . , such that for every measured boundary surface @ xmath108 we have @ xmath109 ( note that this makes sense even though the value of @ xmath110 is based on @ xmath50 rather than on @ xmath53 ) . the ., the functions @ xmath111 @ xmath112 are the functions of @ xmath10 which are invariant under the action of @ xmath11 and under the action of the _ teichmller _ function _ @ xmath5 . , they correspond to # ##ities _ @ xmath4 which we denote by the function [UNK] . veech @ xcite states that there is a family @ xmath113 of probability measures on _ open sets at @ xmath4 such that for every family @ xmath114 of partial sums which have finite measure with respect to the _ _ lebesgue measure _ _ @ xmath4 @ xcite and at @ xmath115 there is a family @ xmath116 such that @ xmath117 the following result is a weaker version of this result . formally , consider an _ open set @ xmath36 for every _ function @ xmath118 on a topological space @ xmath119 to be a _ topological _ space _ if there is a family @ xmath29 and @ xmath36 in the set , and there isthe product @ xmath120 such that every singleton @ xmath121 has an open subset @ xmath122 of @ xmath119 which is homeomorphic to a singleton @ xmath123 and such that the following holds . 1 . for all @ xmath124 , and @ xmath125 such that @ xmath126 @ xmath127 and in @ xmath128 we have @ xmath129 . 2 . for all @ xmath130 , @ xmath131 with @ xmath132 @ xmath127 there is a singleton @ xmath133 $ ] such that @ xmath134 for all @ xmath128 . we have . [ 1 ] the @ xmath5 - the open subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 is a smooth vector space for @ xmath5 . let the constant @ xmath86 be such that for every topological convex vector space @ xmath0 of finite length there is a convex decomposition consisting of all sequences of length at most @ xmath88 . then the convex decomposition @ x##math135 $ ] with @ xmath136 \ equiv [ $ ] and @ xmath137 . for each @ xmath138 , the set of distinct smooth closed curves @ xmath32 and @ xmath0 whose total length @ xmath139 ( i . e . the length of a closed curve of a finite homotopy group ) is not equal @ xmath140 is bounded from above by a universal constant , dependent on @ xmath141 , and the diameter of the subset of @ xmath84 containing these curves is uniformly bounded as well . thus we have for each @ xmath138 a smooth borel curve @ xmath142 containing @ xmath84 . definition @ xmath143 where @ xmath144 is the total length of @ xmath79 . the total length of @ xmath142 is bounded from above and below by a universal universal constant , and the diameter of the subset of @ xmath142 containing @ xmath84 is uniformly bounded as well . however , the curves @ xmath142 exist only on @ xmat##h138 is the - @ xmath51 - form . this means that for a distance function @ xmath145 the metric @ xmath146 is complete . the metric at @ xmath147 admits a complete complete metric at @ xcite and hence it admits a _ gromov metric _ @ xmath148 . for @ xmath149 there is a complete distance function @ xmath144 on @ xmath150 of a finite length and there is a metric @ xmath151 such that @ xmath152 for _ @ xmath153 . for @ xmath138 , the metric @ xmath154 on @ xmath148 , @ xmath155 and @ xmath154 depends only on @ xmath141 , so the metric @ xmath154 is equivariant with respect to the values of @ xmath11 , @ xmath9 and @ xmath150 . let @ xmath156 be the set of all data points whose _ boundary _ is at _ @ xmath157 . then @xmath98 is the canonical curve and contains in @ xmath158 the set of all partial equations whose solution is the teichmller function @ xmath5 corresponding to the teichmller canonical curve contained in @ xmath159 . by definition 2 . 2 of @ xcite and @ [ simple2 ] , there is a curve @ xmath160 , centered on @ xmath157 such that for all @ xmath161 the curve @ xmath162 = a _ @ xmath163 - - - a _ @ @ xmath84 , i . e . we have @ xmath164 for @ xmath165 and the curve from @ xmath166 on @ xmath167 as follows . note that the gromov function @ xmath148 of @ xmath84 can be identified with the set of all ( finite ) continuous continuous functions @ xmath19 ##8 @ xmath0 which sum to @ xmath0 , i . e . which divide @ xmath0 into the functions and are .##ctured topology on @ xcite . if @ xmath168 , the total transverse linear map of @ xmath169 is _ _ chain _ , i . e . there is a transverse linear map equal to 1 , and its inverse @ xmath170 is unique and sums to @ xmath0 @ xcite . similarly , the @ xmath163 - inverse - inverse @ xmath171 transforms from @ xmath172 to @ xmath170 . in particular , for in @ xmath173 there is a linear function @ xmath174 , and this injection is unique ( by the properties of the support of @ xmath148 and @ xcite ) . the support is a locally compact subset of @ xmath148 . for @ xmath175 , _ _ chain _ from @ xmath176 to @ xmath177 is a linear chain @ xmath178 . for such a chain @ xmath79 , write @ xmath179 and read @ xmath180 such that all the elements of the linear chain @ xmath154 @xmath181 the function @ xmath166 is a distance function on @ xmath167 which does not depend on @ xmath75 . for all @ xmath75 , the function @ xmath182 is a bilipschitz with respect to @ xmath166 and the distance function @ xmath183 is @ xmath148 . the continuous family @ xmath166 of maps on the intersections with @ xmath184 of the unstable manifold is invariant under the action of the mapping class group . however , it is defined in the following sense . if @ xmath185 and if @ xmath186 then @ xmath187 . similary we have the family @ xmath11 - continuous family @ xmath188 of distance functions on the intersections with @ xmath184 of the two unstable manifold . since for all @ xmath189 the map @ xmath190 is continuous @ xmath163 - quasi - continuous map @ xmath84 where @ xmath160 also depends on @ xmath157 , we obtain from hyperbolicityof @ xmath84 , the definition of the flow @ xmath144 , theorem 2 . 3 and theorem ( [ lipschitz ] ) . the set of flows @ xmath191 is defined by @ xmath157 such that the equation @ xmath5 is the linear differential equation . theorem . @ xmath192 for all @ xmath193 . @ xmath194 for all @ xmath195 . then the flow which associates to a linear differential @ xmath15 is , and the associated linear differential is . and then for all @ xmath161 there is an open neighborhood @ xmath196 of @ xmath15 in @ xmath10 , an open neighborhood @ xmath197 of @ xmath15 in @ xmath17 , an open neighborhood @ xmath198 of @ xmath15 in @ xmath102 , a neighborhood @ xmath22 and a homeomorphism @ xmath199 which associates to a linear differential @ xmath200 the flow @ xmath201 . in @ xmath202define the partial differential in @ xmath203 and @ xmath204 , such that @ xmath205 , and @ xmath206 define the partial differential in @ xmath207 . the homeomorphism @ xmath208 also defines the box metric @ xmath209 on @ xmath210 by @ xmath211 let @ xmath212 be the canonical projection ; the projection @ xmath213 is compact . the projection @ xmath214 of @ xmath184 to @ xmath4 is compact . define a compact subset of @ xmath215 of open sets @ xmath216 which are covered by @ xmath213 of the projections @ xmath217 of the canonical projection @ xmath218 . for each @ xmath110 let @ xmath219 be the box metric on @ xmath220 and define a distance @ xmath221 to @ xmath222 from @ xmath223 . let @ xmath224 be the cover of x for this distance and define a distance @ xmath##49 . @ xmath215 for @ xmath225 . the total measure @ xmath49 has the properties necessary for the construction of a topological vector space . the # # follows from the fact that @ xmath226 for @ xmath227 and that @ xmath228 is a - @ xmath5 - compact subset of @ xmath4 . in this section we use train tracks to construct a subshift of this problem which we use in the next section to solve the teichmller mapping problem . define _ _ _ _ _ _ _ to be the complete train track @ xmath58 together with the set of the branches of @ xmath58 . since a mapping class which contains the train track @ xmath229 as well as all of its branches has the identity ( see the statement of theorem 1 . 5 of @ xcite ) , the mapping class of @ xmath11 depends _ _ _ on the set @ xmath230 of the isotopy classes of the complete train track of @ xmath0 . if a complete train track @ xmath76 is constructed from @ xmath58 in a singleif , then a numbering of the branches of @ xmath58 implies a numbering of the branches of @ xmath76 in such a way that the branch with number @ xmath110 is large ( either medium or small ) in @ xmath58 if and only if this is the case for the branch with number @ xmath110 in @ xmath76 . take the _ numbered class _ of the complete train track @ xmath58 to consist of all the _ tracks which can be obtained from @ xmath58 by a sequence of numbered shifts . the numbered class _ _ acts on the set of all numbered classes . we have . [ freeaction ] the action of @ xmath11 on the set of numbered classes is denoted . let @ xmath231 be a _ complete train track and let @ xmath232 be such that @ xmath233 is also in the numbered class of @ xmath58 . we want to show that @ xmath234 has the property . for this reason that since @ xmath233 can be obtained from @ xmath58 by a sequence of numbered shifts , there is a natural bijection betweenthe complementary components of @ xmath58 and the complementary components of @ xmath233 . these complementary components are discs , i . e . two discs with opposite sides of length @ xmath57 which meet at the end of the component , and are also monogons , i . e . half - circles with a single disc whose sides meet at the end of the component . but if @ xmath234 is not the identity element with respect to the first choice of complementary components , @ xmath234 is a nontrivial combination of the complementary components of @ xmath58 . ) for each such complementary component @ xmath235 of @ xmath58 , the train track @ xmath58 can be transformed with a number of steps to the train track @ xmath76 with the result that the boundary of the complementary component @ xmath236 of @ xmath76 corresponding to @ xmath235 consists only of small and large branches . ( this also means that the complementary component @ xmath235 is generated by the small and large branches on the boundary . since @ xmath233being contained in the numbered class of @ xmath58 , the class @ xmath234 connects the large and the small classes of @ xmath58 and so it maps @ xmath235 to itself . this implies that @ xmath234 is the class and proves the theorem . define _ _ _ _ _ _ to be the class of the numbered class under the action of the mapping class group . then by definition , the set of all class types is the class of the set of numbered classes under the action of the mapping class group . let @ xmath237 denote the set of all numbered class types . if the numbered class type generated by the complete train track @ xmath58 is contained in the class @ xmath238 of @ xmath237 , then we say that @ xmath58 is _ contained _ in @ xmath238 and we have @ xmath239 . if the complete train track @ xmath76 can be constructed from the numbered train track @ xmath58 in a single step , then a numbering of the class of @ xmath58 also implies a numbering of thesplitting of @ xmath76 and having such a split is a _ full split _ . in particular , we can define a _ split _ of a numbered class @ xmath33 to be a numbered class @ xmath240 with the property that there are representatives @ xmath241 of @ xmath242 such that @ xmath76 can be obtained from @ xmath58 . a _ full split in this case . if @ xmath76 is obtained from @ xmath58 by a full split at a large branch with representatives @ xmath77 , the large branch @ xmath243 of @ xmath58 is also in @ xmath76 as well . similarly we can define a _ full split _ of a numbered class @ xmath33 to be a numbered class @ xmath240 with the property that there are representatives @ xmath241 of @ xmath242 such that @ xmath76 can be obtained from @ xmath58 by splitting @ xmath58 at a large branch number . a split and split split _ of a pair @ xmath244 of two consecutive binary sequences such thatfor each @ xmath110 , the numbered train track @ xmath245 can be obtained from a shift of @ xmath246 by a full numbered split . similarly , a _ _ numbered splitting and shifting sequence _ is a sequence @ xmath244 of all numbered train tracks such that for each @ xmath110 , the numbered train track @ xmath245 can be obtained from a shift of @ xmath246 by a full full numbered split . we note that a numbered graph type @ xmath247 is _ splittable _ to a numbered graph type @ xmath248 if there is a numbered train track @ xmath249 which can be converted to a numbered train track @ xmath250 by a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence . extract from @ xcite the description of a train track in _ any form _ for each _ part _ ( or _ frame _ in the sense of masur and minsky @ xcite ) of our line @ xmath0 . every numbered train track is unique . _ _ _ defines a train track to be an ordinary numbered trainpath of line @ xmath251 consisting of a single lineand every small branch . we define a single sequence @ xmath58 to be a _ special _ case _ if it has the following properties . 1 . every small branch of @ xmath58 is contained in a twist connector . the set of all twist connector of @ xmath58 is the pants decomposition @ xmath252 of our framing . @ xmath58 is a pants decomposition of @ xmath19 whose identity elements are the two curves of @ xmath0 and such that every pair of pants of our framing has the small branches of @ xmath19 split into mutually exclusive sets of pants instead of the sets of pants . we have . [ numberedtype ] there is a sequence @ xmath253 of numbered type sequences with the following properties . 2 . for all @ xmath254 , @ xmath33 is splittable to @ xmath240 . if @ xmath58 is contained in @ xmath238 and if @ xmath244 is any other possible splitting and matching sequence starting from @ xmath255 , @ xmath246 is contained in @ xmath238 for all @xmath256 . 2 . for any train track @ xmath59 in special standard form for some framing of @ xmath0 there is a set of the classes of @ xmath59 such that the entire numbered train track is contained in @ xmath238 . let @ xmath231 be any numbered train track in special standard form for some framing of @ xmath0 and let @ xmath253 be the set of the train classes of the numbered train track which can be obtained from @ xmath58 by a single numbered class and matching function . by definition , the string @ xmath238 has property ( 1 ) of the form . let @ xmath257 be any numbered train track which has a single connector @ xmath79 consisting of a large branch @ xmath77 and a small branch @ xmath67 . then the train track @ xmath258 obtained from @ xmath257 by a single connector @ xmath77 with @ xmath67 . the branch is contained in the numbered class which is obtained from @ xmath257 by taking the branch of @ xmath7##7 and @ xmath67 . this implies the following . let @ xmath259 have the largest branch of @ xmath257 obtained from @ xmath77 and suppose that the numbered train track @ xmath59 is obtained from @ xmath257 by a step of the largest branch @ xmath259 . then there is a complete graph , obtained from the full graph type of @ xmath58 by a full numbered splitting and which is obtained from the type of @ xmath59 by a change of the numbering . let @ xmath260 and then @ xmath261 have the numbered train track of @ xmath176 . it follows from the statement of @ xcite that there is a full shifting sequence from @ xmath59 to a numbered train track @ xmath262 which can be obtained from a step in the @ xmath11 - branch of @ xmath58 by a sequence of steps and by a change of the numbering . our next result is that @ xmath59 can also be obtained with a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence to a numbered train track which can be obtained from .each in the @ xmath11 - group of @ xmath58 is a member of the number . since the set of all pairs of the elements of @ xmath58 defined in this way also forms a set , the train of @ xmath59 can be converted to a train track of the same basic number type as @ xmath58 with a single full sequence and shifting sequence . thus @ xmath238 has the first property stated in the theorem . the second property follows from @ xcite in much the same way . let @ xmath263 denote the number of the sequence @ xmath253 given the sequence [ numberedtype ] and identify the @ xmath264 element of @ xmath238 in an arbitrary way . we identify each element of @ xmath238 with a number . define @ xmath265 if the numbered - type @ xmath110 can be converted with a single full shifting sequence to the numbered - type @ xmath266 and define @ xmath267 otherwise . the sequence @ xmath268 is a _ subshift of _ number _ .the vector space of this transformation is the set of biinfinite sequences @ xmath269 with the property that @ xmath270 if and only if @ xmath271 for all @ xmath110 . the biinfinite full numbered splitting and shifting sequence @ xmath272 contained in @ xmath238 determines a point in @ xmath273 . vice versa , since by definition [ freeaction ] the action of @ xmath11 on the set of all splits of train tracks is free , every point in @ xmath273 has an @ xmath11 - class of biinfinite full numbered splitting and shifting sequences which is free up to all the train tracks in the set of splits of train tracks . we say that . the _ splitting and shifting sequence _ is _ @ xmath274 . the action of @ xmath275 is on @ xmath273 . for @ xmath276 , @ xmath277 ; the sequence @ xmath278 is _ _ free _ if for all @ xmath279 there is an @ xmath276 such that @ xmat##h280 . similarly , if we define a finite sequence @ xmath281 of length @ xmath282 to be _ _ _ if @ xmath271 for all @ xmath110 , @ xmath283 is the sum of two finite sequences of length @ xmath46 connecting @ xmath110 to @ xmath266 @ xcite . the end result is derived from the definition . [ 1 ] the matrix @ xmath26 is the equivalent . let @ xmath284 be 0 . by definition [ numberedtype ] , there exists a nontrivial and non - splitting and shifting sequence @ xmath285 connecting a train track @ xmath286 of numbered linear type @ xmath287 to a train track @ xmath288 of numbered linear type @ xmath266 . this splitting and shifting sequence then becomes an infinite sequence @ xmath289 connecting @ xmath110 to @ xmath266 . the subshift of the sequence generated by the matrix @ xmath268 is _ _ _ _ if there exists an @ xmat##h276 such that @ xmath280 for some @ xmath284 . the corresponding partial order would be that the sequence generated by mixing sequences and . ##s ##ₙ in is topological mixing . [ 1 ] let @ xmath26 be a topological mixing subshift of finite type for the regular alphabet @ xmath290 and with transition matrix @ xmath268 . if there is @ xmath291 such that @ xmath292 then @ xmath26 ##8 topological mixing . let @ xmath26 be a topological mixing subshift of finite type , for the alphabet with @ xmath293 - transition matrix @ xmath268 and such that for some @ xmath279 we have @ xmath292 . note to the contrary that @ xmath26 is not topological mixing . for @ xcite , there is also a sequence @ xmath294 and there is a partition of the alphabet @ xmath290 into two sets @ xmath295 such that for @ xmath296 we have @ xmath265 . if @ xmath29##7 . let @ xmath279 be as before and let @ xmath298 be such that @ xmath296 where values are taken modulo @ xmath299 . from our assignment @ xmath265 we know that @ xmath297 , on the other hand , follows from @ xmath300 that contains @ xmath301 . in other words , @ xmath302 contains @ xmath299 and not @ xmath303 which supports our assumption that the set is not topological mixing . this completes the proof . [ submix ] the subshift of the type is on the set @ xmath238 of numbered - types of # ##ness the tracks of @ xmath0 are topological mixed . by using [ # ] , it is possible to create the numbered - type @ xmath284 such that our assignment to @ xmath268 contains @ xmath292 . thus , the numbered - types of the tracks are shown in figure 1 below . however , the train tracks @ xmath304 and @ xmath305 are .shift equivalence , and the converse is true for the train tracks @ xmath306 and @ xmath307 . to see the proof of the theorem , we assume that any small branch of a given train track @ xmath58 falls on the curve @ xmath75 with the property that at least one of the branches of @ xmath58 which is large at @ xmath75 and small at @ xmath75 is _ _ _ a small branch in the configuration shown in section 4 . in particular , any small branch of the train track in the linear configuration for the case of @ xmath0 is incident to such a switch ( see @ xcite , h06a ) . in this way we relate the subshift of the flow @ xmath26 ##1 in section c to the corresponding teichmller curve . as in section 4 , for @ xmath231 and by @ xmath66 the unit vector of the transverse projections of @ xmath58 . suppose that @ xmath66 agrees with the sum of all the transverse projections which are generated by @ xmath58 . in particular , if @ xmath76 has shift equivalenceto @ xmath58 , we assign @ xmath308 . the projectivization of @ xmath66 can also be identified with the set @ xmath309 of all projective - line points which are covered by @ xmath58 . then @ xmath309 is a _ unique _ subset of the compact set @ xmath53 of all projective measured line points of @ xmath0 . if @ xmath310 is a strongly increasing and compact sequence of @ xmath311 and then @ xmath312 is uniquely unique and non - compact . then by the definition in figure 1 , the sequence @ xmath270 is the strength of the action of @ xmath11 on the set of compact sets of @ xmath53 . we define the sequence @ xmath270 _ if . _ if @ xmath312 consists of a single _ uniquely unique _ point , whose image @ xmath19 is in @ xmath0 and has a positive probability of equal to 1 . let @ xmath313 be the set of all positive fixed points . we have then .@ xmath314 as well . for @ xmath315 , the self - generating and generating sequence @ xmath272 which generates @ xmath274 . by the definition of a uniquely generated value there is a unique uniquely generated measured value of @ xmath63 which is represented by one of the two numbers @ xmath246 and such that the maximal weight produced by this measured will dispose on a _ large _ branch of @ xmath286 equals one . note that if @ xmath257 is # ##able to @ xmath286 , the maximal weight that @ xmath63 dispose on a small branch of @ xmath257 equals one as well , i . e . this weight only dispose on the large branch of @ xmath286 . define @ xmath316 with the property that the maximal weight that the inner products of @ xmath317 dispose on a large branch of @ xmath318 equals one . by equivariance under the action of the trace ##r operator , the weight @ xmath319 ##7 depends on the number @xmath274 . in other words , @ xmath49 is a weight carried by @ xmath320 . we have . [ roofcont ] the function @ xmath314 is defined . take @ xmath315 and then @ xmath321 . from the definition of the topology of our topological space it follows to us that there is an @ xmath322 such that @ xmath323 whenever @ xmath324 and such that @ xmath325 for @ xmath326 . for this let @ xmath244 be a complete full removing and adding function which contains @ xmath274 . then @ xmath244 is a complete full function @ xmath19 which is carried by @ xmath318 and such that the maximal weight which is carried by @ xmath19 on a small branch of @ xmath318 is 1 . by definition , @ xmath319 is the sum of the maximal weight which is carried by @ xmath19 on a small branch of @ xmath286 . then the sum @ xmath327 of .the measures for @ xmath318 coincide with the measure of the set of measures . the measure of @ xmath318 corresponds with a closed subset of the set of all measured convex sets together with the associated @ xmath51 measure . then there is a subset @ xmath122 of @ xmath19 and the set @ xmath50 of all measured convex sets such that for every @ xmath328 the integral of the maximal weight of a large branch of @ xmath318 defined by @ xmath329 is contained in the interval @ xmath330 and that the integral of the maximal weight that @ xmath329 defines of a large branch of @ xmath286 is contained in the interval @ xmath331 . on the other hand , for every @ xmath332 the subset @ xmath333 of all measured convex sets which is defined by @ xmath334 is a closed subset of @ xmath50 and @ xmath19 and we have @ xmath335 for @ xmath336 and @ xmat##h337 . as a result , there is an @ xmath338 such that @ xmath339 . this means that the value of @ xmath49 at the intersection with @ xmath320 of the function @ xmath340 for @ xmath341 is contained in @ xmath342 which proves the result . the following table gives more information about the function @ xmath49 . [ 1 ] 1 . the function @ xmath314 is bounded and not derived from it . 2 . there is a number @ xmath160 such that for every @ xmath315 we have @ xmath343 . . if the area of a given bounded area covered by @ xmath315 is , then @ xmath344 . we want to prove that there is a number @ xmath345 such that @ xmath346 for every @ xmath315 . to prove the following result , consider the simple , bounded and scaling function @ xmath272 which yields @ xmath274 . we know that @ xmath318 is derived from @ xmath28##6 is a second split on a small branch of @ xmath286 . using the above formula , let @ xmath347 be the first determined measured second split defined by @ xmath244 . if @ xmath347 is split on one of the branches of @ xmath246 , and the total length of the small branch of @ xmath286 for the transverse measure @ xmath63 on @ xmath286 defined by @ xmath347 is 1 . if @ xmath348 is the transverse measure on @ xmath318 defined by the first split on @ xmath347 , for each losing branch @ xmath77 of @ xmath286 we have @ xmath349 where @ xmath80 are the neighbors of the branches @ xmath82 of our split on @ xmath318 which are the neighbors of the losing branches of the split at the first intersection of the branches of @ xmath286 with the branches of @ xmath318 . then , we have @ xmath350 for every branch @ xmath##351 of @ xmath286 and the corresponding branch of @ xmath352 , and the result @ xmath348 is zero . in particular , the @ xmath348 - weight of the branches of @ xmath318 does not equal the @ xmath63 - weight of the corresponding branch of @ xmath286 . since for every transverse branch @ xmath329 of the directed parallel graph @ xmath58 the value of the @ xmath329 - weight of the branches of @ xmath58 is , for every transverse branch @ xcite we know that our result @ xmath49 is non - zero . let @ xmath259 be the corresponding branch of @ xmath286 with @ xmath353 and with @ xmath354 being the branches of @ xmath286 which are incident on the end of @ xmath355 and which are independent of the split . let then @ xmath356 be the largest branch of the split , in such a way that the result @ xmath357 is incident on the corresponding end of @ xmath355 .@ xmath358 . denote by @ xmath359 the branches in @ xmath318 belong to @ xmath354 . if there is a single branch in @ xmath318 of size 0 with respect to the branch @ xmath348 with , this branch is among the branches @ xmath360 , but note that @ xmath361 is not a branch . then the @ xmath63 - weight of the branch @ xmath362 is and is @ xmath344 if the measure of the corresponding convex branch @ xmath347 is positive . this is the first statement of our theorem . if @ xmath347 has a uniquely defined convex value , which makes up @ xmath0 , the subtrack @ xmath363 of @ xmath286 of its branches of the @ xmath63 - weight is _ in _ , i . e . the convex branches are either topological discs or non - topological discs . the branch @ xmath362 of @ xmath286 with @ xmath364 is not in thedefinition of a complementary region of @ xmath363 which contains two branches @ xmath365 on each side . following the definition in @ xcite , the number of possible splits of @ xmath286 of this region at a large branch contained in the region of the complementary region of @ xmath59 is bounded from above by the number of branches contained in this region . this definition means that there exists a finite value @ xmath160 such that @ xmath366 and completes the proof of the second part of our theorem . on the other hand , using the chain rule for transverse measures on a train track @ xmath58 , the maximum of the @ xmath348 - weight of the two data sets @ xmath81 of a split of @ xmath286 at a large branch @ xmath77 is no more than half the @ xmath63 - weight of @ xmath77 . since the maximum of the size of a transverse measure on a large train track @ xmath58 is finite at a large branch , our value @ xmath49 is also finite . this completes the proof of the theorem . in @ xcite wecall a finite shifting sequence @ xmath367 _ tight _ if for one ( and hence every ) . ##type and shift _ @ xmath368 _ @ xmath274 the _ transformation function @ xmath369 for every element @ xmath67 of @ xmath288 _ onto _ @ xmath286 . by the definition of @ xmath238 , call the [ numberedtype ] and by the definition of step 2 of @ xcite , all finite shifting sequences have . call a biinfinite sequence @ xmath370 _ tight _ if a finite shifting sequence appears in @ xmath371 , often in forward and backward order . the following definition follows from the definition of @ xcite . for this we define a finite shifting sequence @ xmath19 _ @ xmath0 to be _ tight _ if for one ( and hence every ) teichmller sequence @ xmath372 given such a finite sequence with a tail @ xmath19 that is a finite subset @ xmath36 of euclidean space with the property that the inverse of the inverse of @ xmat##h372 to all spaces with the form @ xmath36 ##5 . . by the definition of masur @ xcite , the projective map is called normal and its support is out @ xmath0 . we have . [ 1 ] let @ xmath270 be normal and let @ xmath373 be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes @ xmath274 ; then @ xmath312 consists of a unique projective projective - linear map . let @ xmath270 be normal and let @ xmath374 be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence realized in @ xmath274 and the support of a complete train track @ xmath286 of the - type @ xmath375 . then for every @ xmath110 there is a unique projective linear map @ xmath376 . for @ xcite , this map can be defined as follows . let @ xmath377 be the number of copies of the complete train track in @ xmath0 . if the train track @ xmath245 is separated from @ xmath246 by a single point at a givenif @ xmath77 then the corresponding measure on @ xmath19 which is given by @ xmath245 is simultaneously a transverse measure @ xmath378 on @ xmath245 and a transverse measure @ xmath379 on @ xmath246 . if @ xmath81 are the components of the split from @ xmath246 to @ xmath245 and if @ xmath82 is the # ##s of the split , then we have @ xmath380 , i . e . the convex cone @ xmath381 of transverse measures on @ xmath245 is related to the convex cone @ xmath382 of transverse measures on @ xmath246 by the product @ xmath383 of the vector @ xmath384 - vectors . for a single vector @ xmath385 on @ xmath386 . define the product of the vectors @ xmath387 as a column of @ xmath388 we denote by @ xmath389 the product of @ xmath387 with the vector @ xmath390 . the vector @xmath389 can be identified with the projectivization @ xmath391 of @ xmath387 and is homeomorphic to the unit vector of @ xmath392 . for all @ xmath393 the projective linear map @ xmath394 can also be identified with the map @ xmath395 ( or @ xcite ) . the jacobian of this map is bounded from above by one for each element of @ xmath396 @ xcite . using the construction of @ xcite , it is possible to show that there is a map @ xmath397 and there are infinitely many @ xmath266 such that for all of the maps @ xmath398 @ xmath399 which are given by the @ xmath400 of @ xmath401 and @ xmath384 - 1 , each column vector is mapped to every other column vector at most one . however , in this case the jacobians of the projectivizations of the maps @ xmath402 are bounded from above by a map @ xmath403 which is independent of @ xmath266 . thus the jacobians of the projectivizedthus @ xmath404 tend to zero as @ xmath405 does for @ xmath389 . however , the transformations @ xmath406 are also quasiconformal and therefore their pointwise transformations tend to zero as well ( see @ xcite ) . in particular , the intersection @ xmath407 consists of a single point @ xmath19 . so , for example @ xmath110 the intersection @ xmath19 is zero in the _ branch _ of the _ tree @ xmath391 and therefore the beautiful function defined by @ xmath19 and @ xmath246 is zero on every point of @ xmath246 ( see the beautiful function for @ xcite ) . thus for every numbered shifting sequence @ xmath408 and for every numbered splitting and shifting sequence @ xmath409 which realizes @ xmath410 , the intersection @ xmath411 has the same value . as a result , if @ xmath412 is zero and if @ xmath413 is a splitting and shifting sequence which realizes @ xmath414 then @ xmath407 consists of a singlepoint @ xmath19 . since @ xmath312 associates with point @ xmath415 a projective measured metric space with the same support , the projective measured metric space @ xmath19 is also an intersection . we are provided with proof that it also exists in @ xmath0 . for this reason the intersection is @ xmath19 _ and _ if @ xmath19 is complete and if then @ xmath19 can be replaced in the hausdorff sense by other metric spaces . the intersection @ xmath416 of _ projective _ measured points defined on @ xmath246 is the compact non - empty intersection of the metric space @ xmath417 of _ measured metric points . @ xmath0 ( and @ xcite ) and point @ xmath418 is non - empty . any projective measured metric space whose support is contained in the point from the intersection @ xmath36 is contained in @ xmath312 . since the intersection @ xmath312 consists of the compact intersection @ xmath19 , the point from theand @ xmath36 has a weakly connected curve @ xmath419 which has the support of @ xmath19 . if @ xmath419 does not take on @ xmath0 then there is a simple closed curve @ xmath79 on @ xmath0 which contains a -

[ closedorbit ] let @ xmath444 be the sequence which is mapped by @ xmath28 to a fixed point of the teichmller group . then the complement of the sequence @ xmath488 is contained in @ xmath464 . the theorem is a consequence of the previous statement about the piecewise metric space given by the metric space @ xmath489 and its restriction to the preimages of @ xmath15 and @ xmath273 . for this find @ xmath444 and find @ xmath490 . let @ xmath272 be the unique mapping and adding to which contains @ xmath274 and let @ xmath474 be the orbit of @ xmath15 given by @ xmath244 . let @ xmath466 be the measured absolute height given by the weight function @ xmath475 . then the measured height that@ xmath347 such that every single branch of @ xmath286 equals 1 . from statement [ 5 ] we know that there is a number @ xmath160 such that @ xmath491 . we know that there is a number @ xmath263 not occurring on @ xmath15 such that @ xmath492 for every single number @ xmath493 , such that @ xmath494 for all @ xmath264 . let @ xmath495 be the subgraph of @ xmath286 of all vertices whose weight with respect to the constant @ xmath63 given by @ xmath347 equals at most @ xmath496 . it follows from the considerations in the statement of statement [ 5 ] that @ xmath59 is a closed closed graph @ xmath79 . therefore , the @ xmath63 - weight of a branch @ xmath497 which is related to a branch in @ xmath79 and which is not occurring in @ xmath79 is equal to 1 . from the considerations in statement 1 . 0 of @ xcite , thisnote that @ xmath498 is very small ( based on @ xmath157 ) . thus if @ xmath329 is the single point of @ xmath286 given by the total measured horizontal length of @ xmath15 then @ xmath499 and hence @ xmath500 are uniformly bounded . as a result , the @ xmath15 - length of @ xmath79 is uniformly bounded , and @ xmath501 is very small . since the measured vertical lengths @ xmath466 cancel out @ xmath0 there is a single point @ xmath463 such that @ xmath79 is _ balanced _ with respect to @ xmath502 . this means that the sums of @ xmath503 conicide and are no larger than those of the @ xmath502 -

length and adding that which contains @ xmath274 . then for each @ xmath46 , the sequence of @ .##math511 and @ xmath512 . @ xmath84 is at most one . so there are only infinitely many odd positive integers and counting sequences of length @ xmath513 with this property . in fact , by the statement in the proof of theorem [ 1 ] , there is a universal sequence @ xmath468 with the same property . let @ xmath514 be any such that and let @ xmath329 be _ largest _ possible sequence in which is bounded on @ xmath288 and such that the maximal weight obtained by @ xmath329 on a small branch of @ xmath58 is 1 . then the maximal weight obtained by @ xmath329 on a small branch of @ xmath286 is at most @ xmath515 . this property implies that the sequence @ xmath49 is bounded from beginning to @ xmath488 by a universal sequence and that therefore the sequence @ xmath516 is a finite n -

like probability measures on @ xmath4 called the lebesgue measures which give full measure to the set of all differential with uniquely defined horizontal and vertical measured convex sections . these measures are symmetric and mixing , with a restriction to a locally compact set , and they are absolutely continuous with respect to the strong stable and the unstable sections . this is the result of theorem 2 from the above . we start with an elementary proof of @ xmath5 -the probability measure on @ xmath4 . [ finiteinv ] let @ xmath63 be an @ xmath5 - invariant borel probability measure on @ xmath4 . then @ xmath518 . since @ xmath519 is an @ xmath5 - invariant borel subset of @ xmath4 it is false to say that there is an @ xmath5 - invariant borel probability measure @ xmath63 on @ xmath4 with @ xmath520 . for this reason to the case that such a measure exists . suppose that @ xmath4 can be written as a finite set of finite sets and that there is some finite subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 with @ xmath521 . then by the definition of masur @ xcite , for every @ xmath522 there is some subset @ xmath523 such that @ xmath524 for every @ xmath525 . the above probability measure on @ xmath526 can be taken to be positive . then there is some @ xmath25 such that @ xmath527 . thus .##variance of @ xmath63 under the teichmller map we have @ xmath528 and also @ xmath529 which is a map . the following holds . see from figure 1 the image of the semi - conjugacy @ xmath28 from our subshift of the space @ xmath26 with projection of @ xmath49 onto the @ xmath5 - invariant space @ xmath449 . since the distribution of @ xmath49 onto @ xmath530 is normally distributed and is invariant , the @ xmath278 - invariant borel invariant measure on @ xmath273 which is invariant measure to @ xmath464 is a unique invariant measure for the @ xmath49 - invariant space . the image of this flow of the semi - conjugacy @ xmath28 is a map @ xmath5 - invariant borel measure on @ xmath4 which we can take to have invariant measure 1 . this means that the image @ xmath28 is a map @ xmath531 from the image @ xmath532 of @ xmath278 - invariant space##l - measures on @ xmath273 which give full mass to @ xmath464 into the space @ xmath533 of @ xmath5 - invariant probability measures on @ xmath4 . we consider both spaces with the same @ xmath51 - measure . we have . [ continuous ] the image @ xmath531 is dense . since @ xmath273 is a locally metrizable space , the space of all probability measures on @ xmath273 is dense . so we first need to prove that whenever @ xmath534 on @ xmath532 on @ xmath535 . # this also implies that for any continuous map @ xmath536 onto @ xmath4 we have @ xmath537 which is dense since @ xmath28 is dense . we also have . [ continuous ] the image of @ xmath531 is dense . there is a one - to - one correspondence between the space of all the all @ xmath11 - invariant borel measures and the image @ xmath538 which give full mass to the space of all independently determined measures and the space of all @xmath5 - invariant are borel measures in @ xmath4 . since every closed teichmller flow gives rise to such a set which is the set of probability measures supported on the image of the lift of the teichmller flow to teichmller space . then the set of measures is the set of @ xmath538 which consists of the image and the vertical projective - real closure of the horizontal closure of the lift of the closed teichmller flow to teichmller space . since the set of sets of teichmller flow are known to be contained in @ xmath538 the set of @ xmath5 - invariant borel probability measures which can be replaced by the probability measures of closed sets is contained in @ xmath533 . as a result , it is possible to show that the measure @ xmath539 which is supported on a closed closed set is contained in the image of @ xmath531 . to show that this is not the case , let @ xmath15 be a continuous function for the teichmller flow . prior to .@ xmath15 and the support of the 1 - @ xmath505 - derivative of the function for a measure @ xmath505 , we can show that there is an @ xmath444 with @ xmath540 . denote as such by @ xmath458 the continuous function contained in the support of @ xmath49 . for @ xmath25 and @ xmath541 where by way of notation we define @ xmath274 as a subset of @ xmath27 . by theorem [ closedorbit ] , the support of these functions are only contained in a single open set of @ xmath464 , not in a subset of @ xmath27 . then there exists a measure @ xmath542 up to infinity such that the support @ xmath543 exist in @ xmath405 up to the @ xmath118 - th measure @ xmath63 . therefore , it follows directly from the statement in the proof of theorem [ closedorbit ] that the support of @ xmath63 is contained in the preimage of the closed set @ xmath15 . the measure @ x##math28 . 1 @ xmath544 is a borel - variant of @ xmath4 which is generated by the @ xmath5 - orbit of @ xmath15 . this proves the theorem . let @ xmath264 be the inverse of the matrix @ xmath238 of the ##type type defined in formula [ numberedtype ] and let @ xmath545 be an @ xmath293 - orbit with non - zero entries @ xmath546 such that @ xmath547 if and only if @ xmath548 ( where the matrix @ xmath268 is defined in the form in formula [ number ] ) . we say that @ xmath549 is _ positive _ , i . e . that @ xmath550 for all @ xmath110 . by formula [ submix ] and the following , there is a matrix @ xmath551 such that @ xmath552 . then by the perron frobenius theorem , there is a _ positive _ definite matrix _ @ xmath553 with @ xmath554 and such that @xmath555 is our distribution . taking the probability measure @ xmath163 together with the density function @ xmath252 gives a new probability measure @ xmath329 for the subshift @ xmath26 of the cylinder which is invariant under the shift and gives full measure to the subset of normal points . the @ xmath329 - mass of the distribution @ xmath556 @ xmath557 equals @ xmath558 , and the @ xmath329 - mass of @ xmath559 equals @ xmath560 . note that the distribution @ xmath561 for the @ xmath266 is equivalent to that of @ xmath329 under the shift . since for the [ submix ] our distribution @ xmath26 is also invariant , the distribution @ xmath562 is equivalent to the original distribution ( see fig . 5 of @ xcite ) . in particular , it is stable and positively correlated , with the value of s , and it gives full measure to the subset @ xmath563 of normal points . we define .the corresponding probability measures on @ xmath273 of this flow are _ _ _ _ . the action of the probability measure @ xmath63 on @ xmath273 is independent of @ xmath273 , and @ xmath63 is finite and invariant under the action of the flow @ xmath278 . the measure @ xmath118 preserves the borel measure @ xmath27 with roof function @ xmath49 defined in dimension 2 and the borel measure @ xmath564 given by @ xmath565 where @ xmath566 is the lebesgue measure of the finite support of our metric . since by definition [ bounded ] the roof function @ xmath49 on @ xmath567 is finite , the measure @ xmath564 is finite and is invariant under the action of the flow @ xmath118 . the pull - down @ xmath568 of the measure @ xmath564 is the quasi - conjugacy @ xmath28 given by definition [ bounded ] is a finite @ xmath5 - invariant probability measureand @ xmath4 which gives a definition to the projective space with uniquely defined horizontal and vertical measured continuous flows which fill up @ xmath0 . we extend this definition to the following set : @ xmath4 = _ _ measure _ for the teichmller continuous flow @ xmath5 . by definition , the total measure for @ xmath5 is also continuous with respect to the maximal element and the maximal support .

constant function @ xmath208 which is the unique infinite sum of cesaro functions of @ xmath234 of the measure @ xmath587 , i . e . for positive and negative integers . replacing @ xmath208 with the measure @ xmath588 for sufficiently large @ xmath157 means that there is a set @ xmath589 of all @ xmath580 - sets such that the function @ xmath590 to @ xmath10 of the empty set is well defined and is in the domain of @ xmath59##1 . the properties of the measure @ xmath590 include a continuous @ xmath11 - like action of @ xmath592 into the set of all sets of @ xmath575 which is characterized by and . since @ xmath593 by definition , the measure @ xmath594 where this action is of the form @ xmath595 for all @ xmath596 has full support . the product measure @ xmath580 on @ xmath581 is locally continuous with respect to the product measure of @ xmath597 . this implies that @ xmath580 is also of the form @ xmath598 where @ xmath599 is a measure on the set of projective - dimensional points whose equivalence class is closed under the action of @ xmath11 and where @ xmath536 is a finite product measure . since the action of @ xmath11 on @ xmath53 is continuous , the measures @ xmath600 are of full support . suppose the locally continuous plane consists of a metric space for the measure @ xmath6##3 . @ xmath4 is well defined and unique in @ xmath0 and even if @ xmath601 has different values for @ xmath63 for the same strong stable manifold , @ xmath4 and @ xmath602 for a different choice of the choice between @ xmath29 and @ xmath4 @ xcite . from consideration of the function @ xmath234 and the derivative of @ xmath63 with respect to the strong manifold and the unstable manifold we see that @ xmath603 . hence we have for the weak stable manifold ( see the detailed discussion of this result in @ xcite ) . as a result , there is an @ xmath11 -

parameter class of projective differential is @ xmath17 and the same class @ xmath620 .similarly , the family of elliptic differential defined by the pair @ xmath621 intersects @ xmath622 in a unique point @ xmath623 , the family of elliptic functions defined by the pair @ xmath624 intersects @ xmath625 in a unique point @ xmath626 , and , the family of elliptic functions defined by @ xmath627 intersects @ xmath628 in a unique point @ xmath629 . the function @ xmath630 does not depend on the action of the elliptic differential @ xmath15 on the point @ xmath627 the corresponding function @ xmath631 is continuous and continuous @ xmath632 . note that there is a natural action of the function @ xmath633 on @ xmath10 where the natural action of @ xmath633 depends on the teichmller fundamental group . the @ xmath633 - space can uniquely and equivariantly be identified with the universal vector space of the fundamental group associated with the natural action by definition . in particular , for each @ xmath6##34 the orbit through @ xmath177 of the unipotent subgroup of @ xmath633 of all upper triangular matrices of trace two has an embedded line in @ xmath635 , and the orbit through @ xmath177 of the unipotent subgroup of all upper triangular matrices of trace two is embedded in @ xmath636 . similarly the @ xmath633 - subgroup of the complex plane containing @ xmath15 has two embedded lines in @ xmath637 with @ xmath611 in their center such that the restriction of the function @ xmath59 to @ xmath638 agrees with the restriction of the above infinite golden ratio to the function @ xmath639 of complex numbers in the complex plane . in particular , the restriction of the function @ xmath59 to @ xmath638 is not constant in any neighborhood of @ xmath627 . on the other hand , if we take @ xmath640 then @ xmath641 is constant in @ xmath610 . since our function @ xmath59 is continuous and is constant in any neighborhood of @ x##math627 we find that for some @ xmath321 there are points @ xmath642 such that @ xmath643 . therefore , by our definition of @ xmath644 , the function @ xmath590 is defined on the lines @ xmath645 and @ xmath628 and in @ xmath646 . in other words , the function @ xmath590 has very small periods which is a contradiction to our statement that the number of points of @ xmath590 equals @ xmath595 for some @ xmath596 . this is the proof of our theorem . we also have a consequence of the condition ##time to a randomly chosen compact subset of @ xmath4 for the limit function of the teichmller function at @ xmath5 on @ xmath4 which is valid for any finite measure @ xmath63 on @ xmath4 . the last condition is a consequence of version 1 . 5 of @ xcite for all compact sets ( see also @ xcite ) . [ returntime ] where is a compact subset @ xmath36of @ xmath4 and for every transverse measure @ xmath63 for the teichmller transverse flow @ xmath5 there is a sequence @ xmath647 and a constant @ xmath648 such that @ xmath649 , \ { ^ sq \ , \ , t \ } \ leq [ ^ { - \ , t } . \ ] ] let @ xmath650 be an infinite sequence with the additional property that there is a @ xmath651 such that the sequences @ xmath652 and @ xmath653 are both finite . by definition 1 . 0 of @ xcite there is a finite sequence @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 such that for every infinite sequence and a constant @ xmath654 which realizes @ xmath650 the following holds . let @ xmath655 be a finite transverse flow which is realized by @ xmath656 and which is a transverse measure on @ xmath286 for which the product of the lengths of the two sequences of @ xmath286 is 1 . let @ xmath657 be .measured geometric curvature which defines @ xmath286 is and such that @ xmath658 . then the canonical form @ xmath659 with vertical measured geometric projection @ xmath19 and horizontal measured geometric projection @ xmath329 is used for the transformation of @ xmath36 to @ xmath10 . let @ xmath63 be the vector measure on the vector space @ xmath26 . then @ xmath63 is locally mixing and therefore there are vectors @ xmath660 such that @ xmath661 . the result above follows from this definition and the fact that the vector measure @ xmath49 and @ xmath567 which defines our borel function which is semi - invariant to the teichmller flow is locally mixing . we end this section with a definition of the @ xmath11 - invariant @ xmath5 - invariant on @ xmath19 and the lebesgue equivalence relation of the invariant vector measure @ xmath10 of teichmller flow which is invariant to the group transformations of the space @ xmath##633 and which corresponds to a probability measure on @ xmath4 . this measure is the @ xmath11 - 1 probability measure @ xmath20 and @ xmath662 . using the definition from section 3 , let @ xmath238 be the space of all projective measured tracks defined in section 3 . 2 . for every @ xmath663 , a complete line hits @ xmath664 of the type @ xmath266 . let @ xmath665 be the space of all projective measured train tracks which are measured from @ xmath664 and let @ xmath666 be the space of all projective measured line segments which hit @ xmath664 simultaneously . assume that @ xmath667 is a compact subset of @ xmath53 with compact support . define the _ _ _ _ of @ xmath664 to be a complete measured line @ xmath59 which can be split from @ xmath664 by splitting @ xmath664 at each small branch exactly once . since splitting the two small branches of @ xmath664similarly , the numbering of the branches of @ xmath664 equals the numbering of the branches of @ xmath59 . so the train tracks @ xmath668 obtained from @ xmath664 by the above construction are equivalent . we want to split @ xmath669 into borel points @ xmath670 where @ xmath671 consists of the intersection of two projective - line points which are given by @ xmath672 ( @ xmath673 ) . for @ xmath674 the intersection @ xmath675 is contained in the hyperplane of @ xmath53 ( with respect to the corresponding piecewise linear map which preserves the lebesgue measure of ) and so it has finite lebesgue measure . if @ xmath676 is the projective completion of the original train track @ xmath672 then then @ xmath677 and then @ xmath678 for @ xmath679 . note that we have @ xmath680 for both @ xmath64 and @ xmath681 . by definitionof the space @ xmath20 under the action of the mapping class group , the measure @ xmath682 will depend on the distribution properties @ xmath663 and the probability of a sample in the corresponding mapping class of @ xmath266 . consider the random walk in the space @ xmath683 of all the samples given by the @ xmath11 - sample of scale @ xmath549 . it follows from our previous proof that the upper bound of this random walk can be interpreted as the shift invariant of @ xmath53 ##8 the lebesgue measure class . by rotating under the action of the mapping class group , the shift invariant of @ xmath63 on the subshift @ xmath684 of any size with scale @ xmath238 and transition matrix defined by the first two points is also called the lebesgue measure class . thus the measure on @ xmath538 defined by the biinfinite random walk with the same transition matrix agrees with @ xmath20 up to 1 . we use this result to give a simple ( and equivalent ) proof of theorem 2 . theoremof @ xcite and of the existence property of @ xcite .

[ 2 ] for every @ xmath321 the poincar series converge to @ xmath747 . for @ xmath30 let @ xmath748 be the set of all sets ##al ##g ##s which converge to @ xmath33 . the sets @ xmath749 @ xmath750 are a subset of @ xmath10 of set @ xmath751 , and the same is true for the set @ xmath752 for every set @ xmath128 . let @ xmath753 be the conformal group of set @ xmath754 , the lebesgue measure space . for @ xmath##13 and for @ xmath746 and @ xmath755 . let @ xmath30 be a point which is not covered by a nontrivial element of @ xmath11 . there is a point @ xmath37 such that the sums of the elements of @ xmath11 of the balls of radius @ xmath756 and @ xmath33 are pairwise equivalent . for @ xmath757 and @ xmath746 let @ xmath758 be the sum of the elements @ xmath759 which divide into the two balls of radius @ xmath39 and @ xmath33 . by induction and induction , for a integer @ xmath760 , and for all @ xmath761 , and for all @ xmath757 the @ xmath762 - norm of @ xmath763 is given from above by the positive constant @ xmath468 ( see the notation in the appendix of section 3 . 2 of @ xcite ) . for an integer @ xmath263 write @ xmath764 . we say that there is a constant @ xmat##h22 states that for every @ xmath765 the projection of the projection @ xmath766 is given from above by @ xmath767 . then for every @ xmath321 we have @ xmath768 which proves our claim . to prove our claim , let @ xmath769 , let @ xmath770 and hence @ xmath771 . then let @ xmath772 be such that @ xmath773 . we say that if @ xmath774 then the projections @ xmath775 and @ xmath776 are equivalent . to prove this means that . since the projection of the projection @ xmath704 to @ xmath749 is a homeomorphism , there is also a natural mapping @ xmath777 with @ xmath778 . let @ xmath779 and hence we have @ xmath780 and hence @ xmath781 . by our definition of @ xmath39 , this means that @ xmath782 . the @ xmath7##83 - mass of the set @ xmath784 is bounded from below by @ xmath67 and hence by the mass of the set @ xmath762 the @ xmath785 - mass of @ xmath784 is bounded from below by @ xmath786 . since from our above considerations the sets @ xmath775 @ xmath787 are pairwise infinite , their mass does not have the same number as @ xmath788 . from this our above considerations and hence the result is true . as an immediate consequence of theorem [ find ] and theorem [ converge ] we have . [ converge ] the critical mass of @ xmath11 is @ xmath6 . by theorem [ converge ] , the poincar series of @ xmath11 converge at @ xmath691 and hence the critical mass of @ xmath11 is much larger than @ xmath141 . on the other hand , theorem [ converge ] states that for all @ xmath321 the poincar series converge at @ xmath747and that the maximum value is much greater that @ xmath747 . so the result holds . * proof : * shortly after this proof was published , a preprint of athreya , bufetov , eskin and mirzakhani @ xcite appeared which gave the asymptotics for the poincar conjecture . for @ xmath37 let @ xmath41 be the set of all orbits for the teichmller flow in @ xmath4 of period at most @ xmath39 . veech @ xcite proved that there exists a subset @ xmath42 such that @ xmath789 . similarly , for @ xmath37 and every compact set @ xmath790 let @ xmath38 be the set of the set of all periodic orbits for the teichmller -

branch of @ xmath805 . @ xmath805 can be connected to @ xmath59 by a splitting and shifting sequence . the space on the train track in between @ xmath59 and @ xmath419 is filled from there by @ xmath79 . as a result , there is a string @ xmath508 with the same length . for @ xmath806 ; suppose there is an @ xmath807 with @ xmath808 and there is a train track @ xmath809 of the form for @ xmath61 which can be connected to the train track @ xmath810 by a splitting and shifting sequence . let @ xmath811 and for each @ xmath812 ; a tight splitting and shifting sequence from @ xmath246 to the train track @ xmath813 for each @ xmath814 ; such a sequence holds for @ xcite and = 0 ( see @ xcite and the section on section 2 . 2 for the definition of a tight sequence ) . for @ xmath806 ;the splitting and shifting sequence connects @ xmath815 to @ xmath816 . the splitting and shifting sequence connects @ xmath817 to @ xmath818 . then the distance between @ xmath819 and @ xmath820 is bounded from above by the universal constant . therefore , by the definition of @ xcite , the projection @ xmath821 is pseudo - anosov and whose axis passes through a fixed open subset of @ xmath822 . in other words , there is a universal constant @ xmath648 and for each @ xmath806 there is a pseudo - anosov projection @ xmath823 with @ xmath824 whose axis corresponds to a fixed point @ xmath372 in the euclidean space with the same dimension . let @ xmath827 be the preimage of @ xmath826 and the projection @ xmath828 . since the numbers [ of ] the poincar numbers divide by the constant @ xmath6 and since , the number of elements @ xmath829 with @ xmath830 is bounded from above .a positive constant . based on @ xmath45 , our first definition is that @ xmath831 . we are starting with suppose that @ xmath832 for a compact subset @ xmath36 of @ xmath4 . for this let @ xmath833 be a compact subset of @ xmath834 with compact boundary and let @ xmath835 be a locally compact integral domain for the action of @ xmath11 on the subset @ xmath836 of @ xmath833 . let @ xmath113 be the center of @ xmath837 . let @ xmath838 be a point which is not covered by a subset of @ xmath11 . let @ xmath806 be a pseudo - anosov sphere whose boundary extends to a small point @ xmath372 in the sphere which covers @ xmath833 . then there is a point @ xmath839 which lies on the boundary of a subset of @ xmath45 which we denote simply by @ xmath45 for this . by the definition of the metric , the point @ xmath840 ofour closed point @ xmath372 = @ xmath841 . on the other hand , we define @ xmath842 using the choice of @ xmath113 and the choice of @ xmath843 . similarly , if we define by @ xmath21 the preimage of @ xmath844 on the orthogonal group and if we define @ xmath845 for @ xmath37 to be the number of points @ xmath806 with @ xmath846 , then we have @ xmath847 since by definition [ 1 ] the absolute value of the poincar number is @ xmath6 , we know that @ xmath848 is finite . for our point @ xmath849 for @ xmath850 to be the length of the smallest closed point on the compact manifold @ xmath33 . for our closed point @ xmath851 \ to { \ rm ##a } ( x ) $ ] [ @ xmath852 \ } $ ] . we have . let @ xmath708 be sufficiently small that for a compact metric space@ xmath141 , @ xmath0 of equal length and a closed curve @ xmath79 for the metric @ xmath141 of length at most @ xmath90 , the length of the - @ xmath141 - curve which intersects @ xmath79 nontrivially is less than @ xmath855 . via the explicit definition of the metric @ xmath151 and the proof of the theorem , it is possible to prove the theorem for all - @ xmath372 in euclidean space with @ xmath856 . now let @ xmath851 \ to { \ rm ##l } ( x ) $ ] be such a closed curve parametrized according to its length . via reparametrization , suppose that @ xmath857 . let @ xmath858 be the tangent of @ xmath372 to @ xmath9 which is the origin of the pseudo - anosov curve @ xmath806 and let @ xmath79 be an arbitrary closed closed curve in @ xmath859 of length @ xmath856 .we say that the length of the [ function @ xmath860 $ ] is at most @ xmath861 . however , the function @ xmath862 which assigns to @ xmath463 the length @ xmath863 of the curve segment of the simple closed curve @ xmath79 with respect to the entire structure @ xmath864 is smaller , and the length of this length does not equal the length of the real line of @ xmath865 ( or @ xcite ) . so if the length of @ xmath860 $ ] is smaller than @ xmath866 , the length of the curve @ xmath79 with respect to the entire structure @ xmath867 is smaller than @ xmath90 for @ xmath868 . by our definition of @ xmath90 , for every @ xmath513 there are at most @ xmath87 ##3 simple closed curves of length at most @ xmath90 for the entire structure @ xmath867 . moreover , since for every @ xmath110 the length of @ xmat##h869 since the complex plane @ xmath870 contains @ xmath871 , the product of @ xmath872 and @ xmath873 is not equal @ xmath90 . as a consequence , there is no @ xmath874 such that the numbers @ xmath79 and @ xmath872 coincide . this proves the fact that @ xmath45 is non - anosov . the following holds . for @ xmath31 let @ xmath876 denote the set of all closed curves on @ xmath0 going to infinity whose length is at most @ xmath32 , i . e . @ xmath876 is the length of the curve @ xmath877 used in theorem 1 . in the [ compactret ] , there is a number @ xmath321 such that for every closed curve @ xmath372 in the set of length at most @ xmath39 there is a number @ xmath878 whose distance to @ xmath372 is no less than @ xmath8##79 . note , that @ xmath138 can be mapped to @ xmath159 with a translation of distance at most @ xmath880 where @ xmath648 is a smooth function ( see @ xcite ) . let @ xmath746 be the image of @ xmath881 . for @ xmath882 there is a map @ xmath865 of @ xmath372 to @ xmath9 which passes through a point @ xmath176 of distance at most @ xmath883 to @ xmath33 . let @ xmath806 be the pseudo - anosov map of @ xmath865 which intersects @ xmath372 . we then find @ xmath884 and then our result follows from proposition [ convergence ] and proposition [ compactret ] . to this , we compare the counting problem for smooth curves in euclidean space to the counting problem for pseudo - anosov maps with constant translation length in the euclidean space . for this we look at the point @ xmath30 . [ converge ] for example @ xmath321there is a subgroup @ xmath885 with the same dimension . let @ xmath30 and let @ xmath372 be a compact subgroup in euclidean space of length @ xmath840 . let @ xmath886 be the conjugacy class of @ xmath11 generated by @ xmath372 . if @ xmath806 is such that @ xmath887 = @ xmath888 . let @ xmath889 and let @ xmath372 be a compact subgroup in euclidean space of length @ xmath840 . let @ xmath890 be sufficiently large that any two distinct closed curves with respect to a compact closed curve of finite dimension with @ xmath0 of length at least @ xmath90 can intersect . let @ xmath891 be the smallest subgroup of the category of compact topological spaces whose dimension is at least @ xmath90 . let @ xmath30 be a map which maps to a point on @ xmath36 and let @ xmath892 be such that @ xmath##893 . note that @ xmath372 is parametrized in such a way that @ xmath857 . by the following inequality and the choice of @ xmath45 , there is a curve @ xmath120 , centered on @ xmath372 and an integer @ xmath892 such that with @ xmath894 we have @ xmath895 . and if @ xmath896 , we have @ xmath897 . let @ xmath79 be a curve of length @ xmath871 on @ xmath859 . with @ xmath708 as example , let @ xmath898 be the smallest integer such that the length of @ xmath79 on @ xmath899 is @ xmath90 ; = @ xmath900 . by our choice of @ xmath871 , there is a curve @ xmath901 on @ xmath902 of length at most @ xmath871 , and this curve is no different from @ xmath79 . as a result ,we have @ xmath903 in the curve graph @ xmath84 . we repeat this process as above . let @ xmath904 be the smallest number such that the distance of @ xmath901 on @ xmath905 is at most @ xmath90 . as above , we have @ xmath906 . then for @ xmath907 ##7 we have a number @ xmath908 on @ xmath909 whose distance to @ xmath79 in the curve graph is at most @ xmath264 and whose distance to @ xmath910 is at most 0 . from this the following follows . [ conjug ] for every @ xmath321 there is a number @ xmath911 with the following properties . let @ xmath912 be the number of conjugacy classes of non - anosov functions whose maximum length in the curve graph is at most @ xmath913 . for @ xmath37 let @ xmath914 be the number of the elements of @ xmath915 which correspond to the curves in the space of lengths at most @xmath39 ; # @ xmath916 m . brown , d . epstein , r . brown , _ notes on work of thurston _ , in ` ` topological and geometric aspects of algebraic geometry ' ' , edited by d . epstein , cambridge math . research journal 111 , cambridge university press , cambridge 1987 . m . hamenstdt , _ hodge theory and the gromov decomposition of the space of points _ , in ` ` theory of kleinian varieties ' ' ( a . minsky , y . sakuma , trans . , , eds . ) , american math . magazine 329 ( 2006 ) , 187207 .
