as the number of agn observations by _ xmm - _ _ and _ chandra _ increases , it is now clear that the vast majority is looking for a broad ( observed by _ xmm _ ) line at @ xmath1 1 . 5 kev , due to emission from the star ; recent studies on such lines include gondoin ( 2003 ; ngc 3227 ) , brown ( 2003 ; mrk 896 ) , smith ( 2003 ; mrk 766 ) , petrucci ( 2002 ; mrk 841 ) , brown ( 2002 ; ngc 3516 ) , obrien ( 2001 ; mrk 359 ) , smith ( 2001 ; mrk 205 ) and many others . in a number of cases ( e . g . , ngc 3783 kaspi 2002 ; ngc 5548 yaqoob 2001 ) the lines have already been observed _ _ , with fwhm lines at @ xmath5 5000 ##0 and @ xmath6 . emission in @ xmath0 ##5 was first observed as a physical phenomenon in _ ginga _ ( singh 1990 ; nandra & singh 1994 ) ; observations by _ asca _ failed to reveal such strong lines , although meta - analysis of observations ofthe results suggest that the line _ may _ be longer than originally thought ( lubinski & zdziarski 2001 ) . there is some disagreement about these results , however , with yaqoob ( 2002 ) stating that the _ asca _ parameter may have a significant effect on the line profiles . a few such lines have been observed in _ xmm _ data to date , these being cb @ xmath76 @ xmath730 @ xmath715 ( fabian 2002 ) , mrk 205 ( fabian 2001 ) and mrk 509 ( fabian 2001 ) . however , not all these line profiles are the same , with cb @ xmath76 @ xmath730 @ xmath715 having a strongly curved profile , possibly due to the strong tidal forces and high density of the active galactic disk . mrk 205 , however , is not well - suited for a true straight - line line if the star is strongly curved , since the electron emission is at @ xmath1 ##1 . 5 kev . this is not the only possible explanation , as fabian ( 2001 ) states : the line could come from a singleinstead of it , rather than the inner scattered disc ; thus , the narrow line may actually consist of a combination of two , distinct lines . the broad line of mrk 509 is also highly variable . the narrow spectral lines found in _ xmm - chandra _ and _ chandra _ are interpreted as low energy emission from outer ( cold ) regions away from the inner scattered disc . suggestions for the origin of the narrow line include the large outer region , the large outer region ( blr ) and the cold outer - most regions of the scattered disc . the narrow line is well known for ir / ir absorption lines , with brown ( 1977 ) first finding that the brightness of the r line ( @ xmath8 = 1549 ) was associated with increasing solar activity . since then , some cross - correlation have been found between the brightness and the absorption lines , such as he iii , he iii , [ iv ] , l , and ly @ xmath0 ( e . g . , tytler & brown 1992 ; zamorani 1992 ; brown , forster & kuraszkiewicz 2001 ; brown 2002 ) , although the nature of these relationships is still unclear . it shouldthey found that , although the baldwin effect is generally considered to be an anti - correlation between absolute width and height , brown ( 2001 ) found that it was much more strongly correlated with width than w for their sample . similarly , croom ( 2002 ) found that , for 11 of the 13 lines observed , the strongest correlation was with absolute width rather than height . iwasawa & taniguchi ( 1993 ) reported an x - ray baldwin effect for the # ##rmi lines found in _ ginga _ observations of agn . they reported a similar correlation for their seyfert lines , but were unable to confirm that it is for qsos , due to poor resolution ; there is also a baldwin effect for the _ iron lines found in _ asca _ observations ( nandra 1997 ) . these iron lines are thought to be caused by rotation of the celestial disc itself . nandra suggests , based on an earlier observation ( nandra 1995 ) , that this baldwin effect is due to the presence of an iron ion in the celestial disc , with the rate of rotation increasing with time ; see also nayakshin ( 2000a , b ) . nandra ( 1997 ) also suggest that theas line k increases in size as the temperature rises , we find that the observed baldwin effect in their case cannot be extended to the entire universe ##s . in this table we describe , and attempt to explain , the baldwin effect for the narrow line k @ xmath0 , obtained from _ xmm _ data , for a combination of _ seyfert 1 and qsos . this table consists of the type i agn ( see [ 1 ] ) , these are essentially a combination of our own data sets and the observations obtained from the _ _ xmm _ data set . the google search has found four other galaxies for which the same values have been obtained ( ngc 5506 turner 2001 ; ngc 3516 turner 2002 ; 1h 0707 @ xmath7495 boller 2002 ; and s180 turner 2002 and turner 2003 , both observations ) . . the type i agn groups in this table , sorted by type are the radio - bright and radio - dark groups . the values are calculated for the 210 kev rest frame and 10 per cent lower / upper values are calculated for the rest - frame line group . @ xmath9 narrow line seyfert 1 2001 ; @ xmath##10 ##n and seyfert variable values ; @ xmath11 qsos [ x = " < , < , < , < , < " , ] figure [ sr - lum ] plots the in - averaged temperature against the out - averaged 210 kev temperature . it can easily be seen that there is a change in the sr as the observer increases the ` x - ray radiation constant ' . the asurv ( incomplete data format ; feigelson & smith 1985 ) format can be used for the analysis of incomplete ( upper limit ) data . this allows the spearman rank ( sr ) method to be applied to the entire dataset , and produces an e - correlation between the sr and sr of @ xmath4 99 . 99 per cent ( @ xmath1 99 . 99 per cent if the upper limits are used ) . due to these effects , sr and sr are very strongly correlated , as shown in figure [ lum - sr ] . however , it is very difficult to determine whether the change in sr varies with distance or time . for the modified spearman rank , a positive correlation ( 79 per cent ; ) .no per ( if the upper limits are used ) is found between the line length and the distance . an alternative method for this is the partial spearman rank , which gives an indication as to which of the two values is better . in this case , compared with the partial spearman rank , the distance - strength relationship appears to be the stronger one . a linear regression can be used to compare the length of the best - fit line to the log - normal distribution of distance against , that is , the power - law distribution . this was done using two different methods . first the upper limit values were progressively removed ; this yielded a value of @ xmath70 . 17 @ xmath12 0 . 08 . the second method is the linear regression method of asurv ; although upper limit values are allowed for , this method does not correct the errors in the other methods . in this case , the result is very good , with a value of @ xmath70 . 17 @ xmath12 0 . 04 . as a further test to determine whether the observed noise could be attributed to noise , the points at higher distances were progressively removed from the data . it was found , however , that , if only thoseagn at z @ xmath5 0 . 08 , there also was an inverse correlation between ir and ir which was observed in nature ( correlation of 0 . 08 @ xmath12 0 . 08 / asurv ) with that observed for the same source . this suggests that the difference in spectral energy is not a frequency - dependent effect . there is a further possibility , that the high energy agn appears to be radio - loud , since the total x - ray emission from radio - loud agn is about 10 % higher than that from radio - loud sources ( zamorani 1981 ; worrall 1987 ) . the basic idea , however , is that the emission is very loud at the highest energies because of absorption and acoustic absorption . however , as p . [ k - lum ] shows , there are lower - energy radio - loud agn in this sample which have much lower limits . also , pg 5062 and pg 1634 + 706 radio - loud agn with energies of @ xmath1 z @ xmath13 and z @ xmath6 have the upper limits of z @ xmath51 ) for their mass . however , the non - beaming effect is not necessarily due to radiation . to show the beaming effect more clearly , figure [ bin ] was created . this shows the relative brightness for a pair of absorption ranges for all the frequencies ( top right ) and for the high - frequency range ( left ) . in both cases , the change in brightness is small . to create figure [ bin ] , upper limits were added to cover most of the range , each with an appropriately sized error value ; the slight change in brightness is still apparent if the upper limits are ignored , although the luminosity range itself is larger . figure [ beta - beta ] compares the results against the absorption - band values measured in the 210 kev rest - mass absorption band . since flat slopes are often assumed to be lines of absorption , it would be expected that they would correspond to the absorption lines ( since the absorption lines may come about from other sources ) , although the 210 kev band is not particularly sensitive to absorption lines . however , this is probably not the case ; if anything , there is a general trend in the absorption direction , with one of the flat slopes having the greatest absorption . as for the absorptionof the neutral iron the @ xmath0 models describe the neutral iron line and the blr ; these phenomena will be discussed in the following sections , showing both the details of the energy model and possible explanations for the x - ray scattering phenomenon . yaqoob ( 2001 ) derived the following expressions for the energy of the iron line , agn , for different field strengths : @ xmath14 @ xmath15 where a @ xmath16 is the energy of iron atoms , ( 0 . 5 kev for neutral iron ) and a @ xmath17 the total energy of the line , expressed in units of kev . a @ xmath18 is the energy of the area covered by blr ##s ; b @ xmath19 , the abundance of iron relative to sun , where 0 . 05 @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 is the electron abundance ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) ; b @ xmath22 , the electron abundance of the line ; @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 , the electron intensity ( = 0 . 05 for neutral iron ) . based on a simple blr model , yaqoob showed that the energy of the iron k@ xmath0 ##2 . ngc 5548 is likely to be too large to derive directly from the blr ; the measured value is 130 ev , whereas the observed value is about 10 times larger , at 133 ev . they suggest that these differences could be explained by a change in the continuum level just before the event ; after this event , the cloud would not have had time to rise to the new continuum level and , therefore , would be too large . given the explantion for ngc 5548 , if the blr model is known , the reason why some of the clouds in ngc [ 1 ] have such high energy values compared to those predicted by the above model must be determined . it must also be determined whether a variation in the spectrum could explain the high energy - density variation . the infrared k line is produced by a different chemical reaction ( fluoresence ) from the optical / ultraviolet k line ( photoionisation ) . however , variations in extinction energy and frequency , for example , can be observed in the blr optical / uv spectrum , and it is not discussed whether such variations exist . one possibility is that the energy density of the blr line is slightly affected by the above equation and increases with increasing lumin##osity . there is no experimental evidence for very high blr coupling strength , however , and the coupling strength of ir / uv radiation cannot be estimated in small samples ( < tens of db ) . for the agn measurements shown here , no correlation is found between the values of the standard baldwin line and those of civ @ xmath81549 and ly @ xmath0 ( both taken from wang , wang & chen 1998 and constantin & constantin 2003 ) . similarly , no correlation is found with the h @ xmath25 / civ ratio , which can be used as a surface measurement , or with the h @ xmath25 fwhm ( taken from dewangan 2002 ; kaspi 2000 ) or both ( marziani 2003 ; v ' eron - cetty , v ' eron & gonalves 2001 ) ; this is shown in table [ hbetafwhm ] . h @ xmath25 the values for the h @ xmath25 / civ ratio are taken from marziani ( 2003 ) , cruz - gonz ' alez ( 1994 ) and mulchaey ( 1994 ) . determining the values of the baldwin line is difficult , as theoptical / uv lines have a slope . for example , using the same theoretical model as this paper , croom ( 2002 ) find a slope for the civ line , located in the blr , of h @ xmath2 l @ xmath26 . they also use e @ xmath2 l @ xmath27 for the ciii ] line ( ciii ] , aliii and siiii ] ) . dietrich ( 2002 ) gives a comparison of baldwin effect values for different spectral lines , for h @ xmath1 @ xmath70 . 02 and + 1 . 02 , for h @ xmath28 = 65 km s @ xmath6 mpc @ xmath6 and @ xmath29 = 0 . they find that having a coupling factor of 0 . 02 increases the slope of @ xmath5 5 per cent . dietrich et al . ( 2001 ) find a lower slope , for h @ xmath28 = 65 km s @ xmath6 mpc @ xmath6 and @ xmath29 = 0 . the baldwin effect of the optical / uv is of a type between the strength of the baldwin effect and the weak2 , and a correlation in the observed spectral lines with pressure and temperature ( of which is the one observed in a different sample ) . it is possible that the x - ray absorption effect described above is caused by a slight change in the shape of the molecules of the surrounding sample , although one might expect not to see a correlation with the observed emission / absorption lines . the distribution of spectra of the agn in this sample near - corresponds with those described by smith ( 2002 ) . upon comparison of all the spectra with those with l @ xmath8l @ xmath30 ( 1450 ) @ xmath4 ##l , they found a difference in the strength of the spectral relation for the two samples , and the fact that qsos tend to have stronger l @ xmath31 / l @ xmath32 spectra than seyfert samples is also likely to be an important factor . alternatively it could be argued that the spectral relation has been measured and correlated with temperature . however the question of metallicity of agn is difficult since their evolutionary history is not known very well . blr metallicities tend to be non - uniform , and comparison of blr spectra with the photoion##isation models predict that blr metallicity will increase with density ( e . g . , hamann & ferland 1993 ; shemmer & netzer 2002 ) . this would oppposite to the values expected if the x - ray halo effect were to be modeled by an empirical model . calculating the expected density from spectral line data is very difficult due to the abundance ##s of fe ii ( which is a common element ) . for the above example , there is a correlation between the intensity of the x - ray fe k @ xmath0 ##3 and the observed fe ii absorption k @ xmath84590 ( see [ feii ] ; fe ii absorption from marziani 2003 ) . the expected abundance is also dependent on the term in the density matrix , but yaqoob et al . ( 2001 ) show that the models are only valid for : @ xmath22 @ xmath5 3 . 5 @ xmath20 6 @ xmath33 @ xmath23 ( i . e . , an fe ii - band density of less than 1 ) . although some blr models predict a higher density ( e . g . , radovich & rafane##lli 1994 ; recondo - gonzalez 1997 ) , and @ xmath34 @ xmath23 ( considered ` likely ' . the blr values are of the range 5000 km s @ xmath6 , which was measured by _ chandra _ . to date , the line width of the narrow iron lines has only been measured a few times , and the values are not completely resolved . kaspi ( 2002 ) measured the line width of ngc 3783 with the _ chandra _ high energy infrared spectroscopy ##s ( hetgs ) , finding an fwhm value of @ xmath1 1700 km s @ xmath6 , which is sufficient for a blr profile consistent with observations in the outer part of the galaxy . however , smith ( 2000 ) found an fwhm value of 1800 @ xmath12 2000 km s @ xmath6 for the narrow iron ##l @ xmath0 line width in ngc 4151 . the structure of the iron # @ l @ xmath76 @ xmath730 @ xmath715 has not been resolved with the hetgs . the problem is complicated by the presence of the two main components of the line .this includes , both dark and bright , narrow and deep . however , smith ( 2002 ) gave a value of 10 000 @ xmath35 km s @ xmath6 for the deep narrow component when using the original data ; this corresponds to 3600 @ xmath36 km s @ xmath6 for the ` deep ' narrow component . under the model , these measurements are consistent with an fwhm of @ xmath1 6000 km s @ xmath6 , which would indicate that the line has actually formed in the disk . yaqoob ( 2001 ) gives an fwhm of @ xmath1 4500 km s @ xmath6 for ngc 5548 , which also indicates an origin in the blr . it should be noted that , although the measurements are all very consistent , and suggest an origin in either the nearby blr or disk , there are very few direct observations of the line , and it is unclear how distant the line in itself is . an alternative explanation is that the ` deep ' line may not have formed in the scattered disk itself . nayakshin ( 2000a , b ) explains how the deep line could have formed by the darkening of the disk ofthe latter , as the temperature increases . a recent study by yaqoob et al . ( 2003 ) suggests that the emission lines may come from a sample which is viewed upside - down and has a flat emissivity profile . similar observations have been made for visible / infrared blr ##s . however , as mentioned above , no difference was found whatsoever between the narrow line mean value and the h @ xmath25 parameters . there is no difference between the blrs used in narrow line and narrow line seyfert . the nls1s have much weaker emission lines , hence their name . it has been previously shown that nls1s tend to have weak h @ xmath25 parameters ( e . g . , brown 1985 ) and this was confirmed upon comparing the h @ xmath25 parameters of samples of nls1s and bls1s ( taken from marziani 2003 ) . the ##np - test shows a very high likelihood of the two samples being from the same population , with the nls1s having a much higher mean value . for the two samples in the same population , this difference in emission lines is not significant . when comparing the two h @ xmath0 ., however , there was no significant difference between the narrow - and broad - line flux , used both in the x - band and asurv ( to account for the upper limit ) . further evidence for the scattered line hypothesis lies in the presence of the baldwin line in mrk 841 ( petrucci 2002 ) . they found that the line formed in two discs separated by several years , although , despite the distance , the change in line flux was very rapid . such a rapid change is difficult to explain if the disc was surrounded by more dark matter , and the origin would be closer to the central star ; the line flux is now known to be @ xmath5 / km . to date , mrk 841 is the only object in which this line has been observed . however , while the blr is a possible source for many of the observed radio waves , we are unable to understand how the blr ##s could explain the well known narrow line nor why the narrow line should exist . in particular , it is unclear why the more luminous objects should have such strong blrs compared to the low - mass objects , as seen from their ir / ir blr ##s , which have a strong narrow line .100 kev emission line . krolik , madau & . zycki ( 1994 ) note the value of the iron - @ xmath0 line in the crystal . they note that for a low opening depth , @ xmath37 , of 0 . 5 , the energy of the line should be of the order 50 ev , for an unobscured source ; for @ xmath37 = 0 , this value gradually increases , to 100 ev . they also note a slight increase in energy for the opening depth of the crystal . the value of @ xmath1 90 ev , for a high opening depth , is , as they point out , in good agreement with the observed values in the seyfert crystal samples , suggesting that the iron - @ xmath0 emission line could be due only to absorption / emission from the electron and not due to the optical absorption or blr at all . ghisellini , haardt & smith ( 1994 ) also note that the line could be an emission line of 1 @ xmath1 90 ev , if the electron source was @ xmath38 @ @ xmath39 @ xmath23 . this should benote that all of these measurements give a value of 4 . 31 @ xmath20 10 @ xmath21 for the relative abundance of hydrogen , rather than the 4 . 31 @ xmath20 10 @ xmath21 given by yaqoob ( 2000 ) . since the ev scales exactly with the ev , the measurements from krolik ( 1994 ) and ghisellini ( 1994 ) should be updated to @ xmath1 141 and @ xmath1 127 ##0 , respectively , to correspond to yaqoob ' s . as mentioned above , the presence of a compton reflection component would imply the existence of dense , light absorbing objects ( guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & wilson 1988 ; wilson & wilson 1991 ) , such as the sun . some of the spectra do show evidence for compton reflection , although the details are very poorly known . this is not too surprising however , since most of the spectra occur at very low energies , and that the spin - states described by _ xmm _ do not reach energies beyond @ xmath1 141 kev , and the compton reflection component is expected to peak at 3050 kev ; these components may not be observed in the visible spectrum , butthat is not to say that they do not exist . _ if _ , _ , these elements are not present in the material , this does not necessarily rule out the atmosphere as the source of the narrow line . alternatively , the structure of the material could be very thin ; if this were the case , a strong pressure component would be expected . however , guainazzi & maiolino ( 2003 ) showed that , for a compton thin crystal with 1 @ xmath22 = 2 @ xmath20 2 @ xmath33 @ xmath23 , a large liquid crystal with n @ xmath1 100 % would be expected . this provides , therefore , a possible mechanism for formation of the narrow line . knigl & kartje ( 1994 ) proposed a simple field - effect hydromagnetic field model for the material , showing that , if 1 @ xmath40 @ xmath38 2 . 5 @ xmath20 2 @ xmath41 ( 1 / 2 @ xmath42 ) = 1 @ xmath6 , where s @ xmath40 is the 2100 @ xmath43 peak of light , then the atmospheric pressure component could be expected toon the temperature curve ; this causes the opening angle of the line to decrease , leading to a decrease in the covering factor . this led to krolik ( 1994 ) , who proposed that the mass of the ~ 10 @ xmath0 line decreases rapidly with increasing opening angle . under this model , an increase in temperature and a decrease in covering factor could lead to a dense population . this model is similar to that proposed by mushotzky & ferland ( 1984 ) , who used a temperature - dependent scale factor and , therefore , covering factor to explain the observed greenhouse effect . an alternative explanation , proposed by ohsuga & umemura ( 2001 ) , is that the low - mass agn is more likely to form dense clouds of gas , caused by radiation pressure from the circumnuclear starburst ; the increased radiation pressure from the more massive agn would prevent these from forming . if the x - ray baldwin effect is , however , supported by a decrease in the covering factor of the line , then this has allowed for the formation of type - ia qsos . many seyfert type stars are known , but very few such qsos have yet been discovered ( see. . . , derry 2003 and ( 2005 ) . the temperature - dependent change in the covering fraction is still a help towards preventing the formation of high energy radio waves , although obscuration should still occur due to cooling and the expansion of the qsos . there is an apparent x - ray baldwin effect for the narrow , diffuse spectral lines observed in the agn : as the 210 kev free electron temperature increases , the effective brightness of the object decreases . the reason for this effect is unknown , but one possibility is a decrease in the covering fraction of the observed cloud structure as the temperature increases . this decrease in covering fraction could be due to the increased temperature in the gas , leading to an increased effective temperature and , hence , increased covering fraction . although the blr provides a model for the formation of some of the narrow lines , it is difficult to explain how the narrow lines could be formed , or what it is that contributes to the baldwin effect . the observed correlation between formation of the line and the brightness of the object is not necessarily due to the effect caused by radiation from the radio - quiet objects , since the effect is not observed in the radio - quiet objects themselves . in theoutside of epic and the _ chandra _ hetgs , it is not yet possible to rule out the possibility of the source being either the blr , or radiation from dark matter ( i . e . , the sun ) . future observations with ground - based x - ray telescopes ( such as the x - ray telescope on - board _ astro - e2 _ , or _ xeus _ ) should have sufficient angular resolution , of the order of few hundred ^ ##−1 @ xmath6 , to be able to resolve this problem . the data in this paper is based on observations with _ xmm - 1 _ , an esa funded telescope , with observations and analysis jointly conducted by esa and nasa . the authors would like to thank the epic team for all their support during the design phase , and the soc and ssc teams for making the discovery and analysis possible . this paper also makes mention of the nasa / ipac infrared telescope ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administation . contributions from the pparc team was published in klp . anders a . , grevesse a . , 1989 , geochim . ,##a , 197 , 197 smith m . n . , 1977 , apj , 214 , 679 blustin m . j . , branduardi -
