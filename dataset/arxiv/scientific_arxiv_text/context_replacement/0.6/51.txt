the nature of the phase transition of high spin states on two - dimensional ( square ) lattice is a controversial topic in the alma ##nac community . the nature of spin interactions can lead to problems , where an arrangement of two spins produces a system for which a more stable arrangement of the two spins is required . in particular , one of the main spin models being studied is the high spin - @ xmath0 ##2 antiferromagnet on a square lattice with magnetic nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and non - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) spin exchange interactions ( known as @ xmath12 2d ) @ xcite . the behavior of this @ xmath12 2d model on a square lattice is not well understood for @ xmath13 . there are two magnetic short - range ordered phases at small and very large values of @ xmath6 followed by an intermediate , ordered phase without magnetic long - range interactions in the region between @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 , where the behavior of these ordered phases are still under much investigation . for @ xmath16 @ xmath17 , the number of spin ( af) short - lived states with pitch vectors @ xmath18 , with the peak value lower than the peak value ( or dot ) , which disappears completely when @ xmath19 . for @ xmath20 we have two intermediate quantum states which are the intermediate states with pitch vectors @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 . these two intermediate states are characterized by a complementary spin orientation of nearest neighbors in vertical ( or horizontal ) direction and an opposite spin orientation of nearest neighbors in horizontal ( or vertical ) direction , and they exhibit nel behavior in the same sublattice a and b . for @ xmath23 , the amplitude changes from a nonzero to a saturated value . the phase transition from nel to the quantum ground state is second order , whereas the transition from the intermediate to the quantum ground state is first order @ xcite . et al _ . @ xcite has shown that the intermediate ground state is the ( _ _ _ ) plaquette state , and the ground and the intermediate states are separated by a band gap . the way to describe the two - dimensional @ xmath12 and antifer##romagnet has been further developed by its theoretical applications in carbon based compounds @ xcite , such as li @ xmath24vosio @ xmath25 , li @ xmath24vogeo @ xmath25 , and vomoo @ xmath25 , which can be predicted by this theoretical model in the form of @ xmath26 ( @ xmath27 ) . these isostructural compounds are characterized by a crystal structure of two @ xmath28 ( @ xmath29 ) layers . the structure of the @ xmath28 layer suggests that the superexchange is stable . in these compounds a low energy phase similar to a long - range stable gas phase has been observed . the spin - lattice calculations of @ xcite and @ xmath30 suggest that the structure is stable . due to the 3 - fold symmetry of the spin - lattice for @ xmath31 it is not possible to determine _ a priori _ which would give the spin correlation function ( i . e . , @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 ) for @ xmath30 . on the other hand , such a calculation would give thethe spin - orbit interaction which will increase the temperature of the ground - state and thus decrease the energy @ xcite . therefore , the temperature change should also reduce this weak interaction and thus increase the energy . in the case of this particular weak interaction , the weak interactions are inequivalent and their strength and energy can be adjusted so that the large quantum numbers cancel the long - range interactions . thus the ground state phase transition of these materials , described by the @ xmath12 lattice , can be changed easily from high to the low @ xmath6 state by applying high pressures ( gas ) , which increase the bond strength and energies . the results from x - ray absorption experiments @ xcite on the li @ xmath24vosio @ xmath25 lattice have shown that the energy @ xmath8 decreases by 1 @ xmath32 when the temperature increases from @ xmath33 to @ xmath34gpa . a modification of the @ xmath12 and ##ian lattice to a cubic lattice was proposed by nersesyan and tsvelik @ xcite and developed by the li @ xcite , the so - called @ xmath352 . in the @ xmath36 there is the inequivalence nn and @ xmath1 and @ xmath37 in the two different cubic lattice ##s with all the nnn ##s on the lattice to have the same energy @ xmath3 . results of the band gap experiment @ xcite for the hydrogen atom abvo ( po @ xmath38 ) @ xmath24 ( n = 3 @ xmath24 , srzn , bazn , and bacd ) have identified two inequivalent coupling modes : @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 between nn and @ xmath3 and @ xmath39 between nnn . for example , the srznvo ( po @ xmath25 ) @ xmath24 is coupling @ xmath40 and @ xmath41 by a distortion of the spin region . this resulting distortion tends to disrupt the spin region and bring it just below a lower limit of the interchain energy @ xmath7 . on the other hand , when calculating the upper limit of the @ xmath36 - - @ xmath0 - staryk##h and balents @ xcite have shown that this system splits into phases , with the exception of the intermediate quantum dot ( or dot ) phase for @ xmath42 . recently , _ _ et . _ _ @ xcite , a strongly interacting particle , obtained the interesting and surprising result that there is a transition state ##t ( * qtp * ) with spin 1 ( @ xmath43 ) , in which there is a first - order phase transition between the * af * and * caf * phases . above this * qtp * is these two intermediate phases separated by the intermediate quantum dot phase ( vbs / rvb ) . the phase transitions of both the * af * and * caf * phases are ##es , below and above the * qtp * , which is devoid of first - order phase transitions . there is no evidence that the transition between the * caf * and dot phase is of first - order . the exact [ @ xcite with an interval of @ xmath44 ( @ xmath45 ) ] , the exact * qp * [ for an interval of @ xmath46 $ ] has been solved for the single particle - @ xmath0 @ xmath12 @on a 2d lattice . these results are in agreement with results obtained by starykh and balentes @ xcite , that are for the * qtp * in the solid - state case , as obtained by wang , _ _ et al . _ _ @ xcite . the ground state ( gs ) states of the two - dimensional cubic cubic antiferromagnet have been determined by numerical methods . the numerical method starts from the number of pairs of atoms , which cover the entire 2d lattice . however , the number of these states which can be calculated is nonorthogonal and overcomplete . this numerical method is limited to small clusters @ xmath47 due to computational limitations . the computation of the first cluster @ xmath45 has been performed by wang and co - workers @ xcite @ xmath48 years ago . in spite of the good results obtained during this computation , it is not possible so far to repeat this process for the next small cluster @ xmath49 . this is only possible with another method , namely the quantum monte carlo method . due to the improvements in the computing and the increased complexity of calculations , more recently @ xcite the structure of the cluster t - 1 / 2 @xmath12 energies have been calculated using the lanczos algoritm for a square lattice with @ xmath50 planes . the theoretical basis of the higher spin method is far from being established . some of the simplest many - body methods , such as the monte carlo methods , can fail or become completely impossible to use if it is encountered due to the minus - one symmetry . therefore , there is little interest in a method that can deal with higher spin states . this large temperature difference in the ground state phase diagram of the @ xmath51 and of the higher spin - @ xmath0 @ xmath52 - - motivated efforts to address this problem with new methods . using a variational approach , in which plaquettes of two spins are glued together , oliveira @ xcite ##s produces the ground state phase diagram of the spin @ xmath12 - antiferromagnet on a square lattice , where the experimental results are in close agreement with the more general approach ( called - ) . in this article , we extend this variational approach to include the full square lattice ( @ xmath52 - ) . the bulk of this work is summarized as follows :in sec . ii , the method is presented and a brief discussion of it . in sec . iii , the method is presented for the case of a plaquette with two electrons interacting with another plaquette by quantum mechanical means . the results will be presented in sec . iv , as well as many others . finally , in sec . v we will have a brief discussion . the general ##ization of the classical spin - @ xmath0 @ xmath12 lattice model has been studied for many years , but very little has been done on the quantum spin lattice model , which is described by the hamiltonian : @ xmath53 where @ xmath54 labels the spin - @ xmath0 - correlation coefficient , the index @ xmath55 labels the @ xmath56 ( row ) and @ xmath57 ( column ) components of the lattice model . the first sum runs over all nn and the second sum runs over all nnn components . we have the hamiltonian ( and ) : @ xmath35 where , with indices @ xmath1 along the row direction , @ xmath37 along the column direction , @ xmath58 along the column , and we have , the##s to be used with @ xmath59 . the lower ( @ xmath60 ) plane ( above ) has only two ordered spin - states : * af * ( * nel ) for @ xmath61 and * af ( * caf * ) for @ xmath62 separated by a second - order line at @ xmath63 . quantum fluctuations play a significant role in the overall phase diagram of the material at room temperature . we will consider the role of quantum fluctuations in the description of the nel and af planes . in the @ xmath29 plane ( upper right ) , the material splits into two phase diagrams , where the spin states ( * af * and * caf * ) are separated by an additional , ordered ( * qp * ) line , thus forming a cubic lattice . the plane @ xcite has only a single point at @ xmath64 , for the transition between the * caf * and * qp * states , and at @ xmath65 for the * af * and * qp * states . the phase diagram of the @ xmath51 plane , is in agreement with starykh and balents @ xcite . however , the phaseof * qtp * ( _ _ _ ##t _ ) that was predicted by them , _ et _ _ . @ xcite , but not shown in their own phase diagram . instead , they predicted the existence of first - order phase transition in the phase diagram . this combination of properties ( which is characteristic of * qtp * ) is the main basis for this new theory . on the other hand , a critical area ( * ce * ) is a point in the phase diagram where a critical point exists and is represented by a first - order curve . this * ce * appears in the phase diagrams of many complex systems such as : fluid dynamics , superfluids , metal complexes , liquid crystals , and ferromagnets , etc , and has been studied for over a century @ xcite . during the * ce * long history , new phenomena at the * ce * were observed . bishop and upton @ xcite predicted that a significant increase in the amplitude of the first - order phase transition observed should occur at the * ce * . this prediction was confirmed by bishop and barbosas @ xcite phenomenological ##ly for an arbitrary , elementary particle . in light of the nature of the multicritical phenomena observed at thet - state fluctuations : using the @ xmath66 diagram for the @ xmath52 state , we calculate the value of the _ mean _ field _ ( * qce * ) and the * qtp * value . rather than @ xcite ##s , the aim of this paper is to model the * qce * using the variational method , that was used first by oliveira @ xcite for the ground state ( @ xmath67 ) as . we first consider the product of the two ground states ( * af * and * caf * respectively ) , where is the t - state @ xmath68 for the ground state and the product of plaquette states @ xmath69 . we represent the plaquettes state @ xmath70 ##0 , that is composed of three states , where it does not depend ( _ mean field _ ) on the spin , as shown in figure 1 . the plaquette state is described by and @ xmath71 label , that is defined by [ . ( 2 ) . ] @ xmath72 where \ { @ xmath73 , @ xmath74 } is the state associated with @ xmath75 , \ { @ xmat##h76 } are the variational functions satisfying the same condition @ xmath77 . with this set of vector states , the mean value of the energy component in each site of the plaquette is given by @ xmath78 @ xmath79 , where the components in the @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 sites are real . with the same vector states as in the ref . ( 1 ) , we have the components at each site that are given by @ xmath80 @ xmath81 @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 where we have used the same set of parameters ( _ _ _ _ ) of e . @ xcite , i . e . , @ xmath84 , and @ xmath85 , which satisfy the same condition @ xmath86 . the vector state energy per unit and energy of @ xmath1 , @ xmath87 , is given by @ xmath88 with @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 , \ begin { 0 } % \ end { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath91 is the mean value of theconsider the @ xmath92 system in the phase space of the @ xmath93 plaquette as shown in figure . the variational energy can be calculated using the dynamics of the x - @ xmath0 ##2 system : , i . e . , @ xmath94 , @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 , that are : for @ xmath97 + \ nonumber \ \ & y \ left ( x - \ lambda \ right ) \ left ( x ^ { 2 } x ^ { 2 } - x ^ { 2 } \ omega ^ { 2 } \ right ) + 2x \ left ( x \ left + z \ right ) + \ omega \ left [ \ dfrac { 2 } { 2 } -

order phase transition . a simple calculation of the parameters @ xmath115 in the case of the first - order transition gives the following approximate result for the critical value @ xmath116 . on the other hand , for @ xmath114 and @ xmath117 the effective value @ xmath118 varies monotonically with the frustration parameter @ xmath8 in the * caf * phase , with a maximum of @ xmath118 / @ xmath119 , which is a second - order phase transition . for@ xmath120 , the * qp * phase transition between the two classical states ( * af * and * caf * ) occurs , and the second transition between the two excited * af * and * caf * occurs from the crossing point @ xmath11 ##1 to the classical state . the classical state ( @ xmath13 ) phase transition and the @ xmath66 diagram is shown in red . the black lines represent the crossing points and the red lines the second - order transitions . we have three classical phases , namely : * af * ( electric ) , * caf * ( quantum magnetic ) and * qp * ( quantum electric ) . the * af * and * qp * phases are separated by a second - order transition line @ xmath121 , and the * qp * and * caf * phases are separated by a second - order transition line @ xmath122 . the decrease of the interchain parameter @ xmath7 has the net effect of increasing the * qp * phase . the * qp * phase decreases rapidly with the decrease of the @ xmath7 parameter , and finally disappears completely with the _ f_ _ _ _ _ * * qce * * @ xmath123 ( @ xmath124 ) where the transitions between these phases are . for this * qce * , i . e . , for @ xmath120 , there is a single second - order phase transition between the * af * and * caf * phases , with a transition point @ xmath125 ( classical phase ) . in order to understand the behavior of the phase transition , we can show , in the fig . 2 , the behavior of the classical phase ( order parameter ) as a function of the phase factor ( @ xmath8 ) for @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 @ xmath128 . from examples such as those shown in fig . 2 we see that for @ xmath129 there is an intermediate phase between the transition point @ xmath130 at which @ xmath131 for the * af * phase , representing a second - order transition , and the point @ xmath132 at which the @ xmath133 order parameter represents a transition for the * caf * phase , representing a first - order transition .for @ xmath134 , the order parameter of the * af * phase decreases monotonically with decrease of the order parameter from @ xmath135 , for @ xmath136 , to , for @ xmath137 ( @ xmath138 ) . for the * caf * phase @ xmath133 decreases from @ xmath139 for @ xmath140 to @ xmath141 for @ xmath142 , yielding a linear first - order relationship between the strongly frustrated * af * and * caf * phases located at the same site . we note that the decrease of the order parameter @ xmath143 ( @ xmath144 ) difer of @ xmath0 ##6 when compared with methods which use lower parameters ( i . e . , @ xmath145 ) . thus , in the case of the strongly frustrated ( @ xmath136 ) and frustrated ( @ xmath67 ) phase , solving the equation ( below ) and applying the method , we get @ xmath146 which is consistent with the experimental results obtained by other methods such as taylor expansion , and monte carlo ., and others @ xcite , and can then be compared with the results for the k @ xmath24nif @ xmath25 , k @ xmath24mnf @ xmath25 , and k @ xmath147mnf @ xmath25 , @ xcite . that for the classical state - @ xmath0 @ xmath35 - is a rectangular grid , where @ xmath6 and @ xmath148 . the square and dotted lines represent the first - and second - order states of , respectively . the dotted line represents the classical spin state ( * qce * ) . the states represented by * af * , * caf * and * qp * represent the classical , quantum , and the electronic states , respectively . the dotted line represents the theoretical state @ xmath63 . ] in addition , we have calculated the loss of the spin due to stress ( @ xmath7 ) and strain ( @ xmath8 ) , in the quantum state - @ xmath0 @ xmath149 ##3 model . using a variational method we calculate the sublat##tice disappears for the * af * and * caf * phases . for calculations of @ xmath150 the theory points strongly to the existence of a intermediate transition state ( * qp * ) between the two * af * and * caf * - phases , and for @ xmath151 , we assume a direct first - order transition between the * af * and * caf * phases . we have shown , by studying the phase diagram of the * af * and * caf * phases , that the phase diagrams are of second and third - order for the * af - qp * and * caf - qp * , respectively . the same phase diagram can be compared with other calculations which use mean - field theory @ xcite and coupled - pair theory @ xcite , with the same experimental results and a better model for the time domain ( i . e . , @ xmath152 ) , and for @ xmath120 this * qp * phase disappears for assuming a direct first - order transition between the * af * and * caf * phases . on the other hand , the calculations of second - order wave function @ xcite have shown that the corresponding * qp * phase disappears forfor @ xmath42 in connection with parameters of the simulation @ xcite . we note that , in a more general context , for example , for monte carlo simulations @ xcite and density functional renormalization group ( dmrg ) simulations @ xcite , this empty set should hold for all values of @ xmath120 . r . f . bishop , p . h . y . li , r . darradi , j . schulenburg , and j . richter , _ phys . : _ * 78 * , 054412 ( 2008 ) ; r . f . bishop , p . h . y . li , r . darradi , j . schulenburg , j . richter , and j . m . smith , _ j . phys . : condens . : _ * 78 * , 415213 ( 2008 ) . see also , r . darradi , j . richter , j . schulenburg , r . f . bishop , and p . h . y . li , _ j . phys . : super ##nova _ * 78 * , 012049 ( 2009 ) . m . carretta , m . melzi , m . papinutto , and m .smith , _ phys . * 66 * , 047601 ( 2002 ) ; g . carretta , g . papinutto , g . c . azzoni , g . c . mozzati , g . pavarini , m . gonthier , and m . martin , _ phys . * _ . * 66 * , 094420 ( 2002 ) .
