water ice is an important component for the formation of planetary and circumstellar systems . the 6 @ xmath8 - 6 @ xmath9 masing line of h @ xmath3o at 180 ghz , which originates from frequencies above 700k , has been used since its discovery by cheung et al . ( 1969 ) to study the radio spectra of star forming stars and young stars . the distance of the two lines at that frequency is typically of the order of a few milliarcseconds ( or ~ 6 @ xmath10 shift ) . however , no data has been obtained from this study on the properties of h @ xmath3o at other frequency ranges . several h @ xmath3o transitions have been observed from ground and space based observations : the 6 @ xmath11 - 3 @ xmath12 transition at 183 ghz ( phillips et al . , 1980 ; cernicharo et al . 1990 , 1994 , 1996 ; gonzlez - alfonso et al . 1994 , 1998 ) , the 6 @ xmath13 - 5 @ xmath14 transition at 380 ghz ( phillips , kwan and lee 1980 ) , the 6 @ xmath15 - 6@ xmath16 transition at 321 ghz ( menten , melnick and phillips 1990a ) and the 1 @ xmath17 - 2 @ xmath18 transition at 325 ghz ( menten et al . ) , the 1 @ xmath19 - 2 @ xmath20 transition of h @ xmath21o at 547 ghz has been measured by zmuidzinas et al . ( 1994 ) . among these , only the 1 @ xmath11 - 2 @ xmath12 transition at 183 ghz has been used to estimate the abundance of h @ xmath3o at very large frequency scales ( cernicharo et al . 1994 , also referred to as cer94 ) . the size of the orion molecular cloud measured by cer94 was several orders of magnitude larger than the size of the cloud observed at 300 ghz and for the first time an h @ xmath3o abundance estimate was made for the very large scale structure of the orion molecular cloud . the iso ##metry instrument provided the ability to measure spectral lines of stars in the near and far - infrared ( see the references in : dishoeck 1997 ; cernicharo 1997 ; and cernicharo et al1997a , 1998 ) . observations of the sgrb2 molecular cloud by cernicharo et al . ( 1997b ) has also shown that water ice is a major component of molecular clouds with an abundance of h @ xmath7 . observations of the presence of the h @ xmath3o region in the irc2 have been obtained by cernicharo et al . ( 1997a , 1998 , 1999 ) . observations of the same region have been independently obtained by van dishoeck et al . ( 1998 ) , gonzlez - alfonso et al . ( 1998 ) and harwit et al . however , the iso measurements of h @ xmath3o have limitations . in addition to the limited spectral resolution and the high resolution of the absorption spectrum of h @ xmath3o , the limited spectral resolution obtained by iso in the near - infrared prevents the detailed analysis of the chemical composition and physical properties of the h @ xmath3o absorption regions . an additional help in determining h @ xmath3o properties could come from the observation of a masing region of h @ xmath3o with similar properties to those of the 183 ghz line . the 325 ghz lineof h @ xmath3o was performed by menten et al ( 1990b ) in the vicinity of the irc2 and other molecular clouds . however , no results were obtained . now we observe the region of near infrared absorption at 325 nm and conclude that the h @ xmath3o line is @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 in the * * * . the resulting results demonstrate the importance of ground - based observations of h @ xmath3o in determining the abundance of h @ xmath3o in molecular clouds and in obtaining accurate contraints of the atmospheric composition of the surrounding clouds . our ground - based observations have much higher spatial resolution than iso - swas , and an abundance of h ( h @ xmath3o ) as high as that obtained from the very - distant h @ xmath3o was obtained in the submillimeter and near infrared bands . the observations were made with the 1 . 5 m telescope of the caltech submillimeter station on the summit of mauna grande ( hawaii ) on december 22 @ xmath22 1998 . the telescope , a water - cooled microwave telescope operating in single - sideband mode ( dsb ) , was usedand the detection of the 5 @ xmath04 @ xmath1 line of h @ xmath23o ( 325 . 152919 mhz ) . the 5 @ xmath3o line was placed in the signal sideband ( usb ) to reduce the interference from the image sideband ( which is at 322 . 2 ghz ) . lines in the signal sideband are highly nonlinear compared to those in the image sideband , due to the high h @ xmath24 noise . therefore it is difficult to determine the sideband intensity of a spectral line . the signal frequency was increased to 400 mhz to ensure that the dominant component of the spectrum of h - irc2 was the water vapor component . the backend consisted of a 1024 mhz acousto - optical system with a range of 5 km ( @ xmath25v = 5 . 5 km @ xmath26 ) . figure 1 shows the emission spectrum which matches very well the previous measurements of menten et al . ( 1990b ) and for the spectral line ( see below ) . the intensity was determined by measuring the spectral line towards the metal - rich variable star vy cma and was found to be close to 0 . the zthey were very warm during the night with an atmospheric pressure and temperature of 620 °c and - 1 . 5 @ xmath27c ##−1 . the relative humidity was estimated to be about - 1 % . the measured distance from this point at 225 ghz was @ xmath40 . 025 . during the same time we made the fourier transform spectroscopy ( mls ) measurements of the spectral lines with the method developed by serabyn and weisstein ( 1995 ) . the measurements with the multi - spectral optical radiative transfer technique , ( cernicharo 1985 , 1988 ; pardo 1996 ) gave an estimated precipitable water vapor emission from the peak of @ xmath28200 @ xmath29 ##200 , which corresponds to a phase shift at 325 . 5 ghz of @ xmath28 87 % ( the measured value for the image side bande was @ xmath28 87 % , but the measured values for the image sideband ##e were overstimated by the value @ xmath28 ##0 ) . the measured of @ xmath3o ##2 was measured with an instrument at room temperature . the measured background noise level , for the image sideband , was @xmath42100 ##0 . the emission map shown in figure 1 shows that the lines from the image sideband are shorter than the 325 ghz h @ xmath3o line , i . e . , exactly the opposite of that shown in the paper of menten et al . ( 1990b ) . rather than a comparison of the two lines ( the h @ xmath3o line shown in figure 1 is identical to that shown in menten et al . 1990b ) we assume that this difference is due to the different observing conditions during our experiment . we conclude that our intensity map is accurate to within 20 - 30 % . the post - irc2 experiment was carried out in # ##al ##bedo , performing the on - the - fly measurements with the observer positioned # ##° from us . the velocity profile of the 325 ghz emission is shown in figure 1 along with that of ch @ xmath2oh ( from the image # ##band ) and the 183 ghz emission from cer94 . the intensity maps for the energy values are also shown in figure 1 . in order to compare the velocity profile of the h @ xmath3o line at 183 and 325 ghz we reobserved a few times at 183 ghz with the30 - m iram telescope in june 1999 . the observing results are very good with the radio source at this frequency of @ xmath4 mhz . the results , compared with those observed in 1994 , are shown in figure 3 . the horizontal 5 @ xmath17 - 5 @ xmath18 line pointing towards the center ##line is similar to that of the 5 @ xmath11 - 4 @ xmath12 line observed at cer94 ( see diagram in figure 3 ) . however , the antena ##tion of the line is 10 times higher and the line profile , although in the low frequency range , has shifted towards the center . taking into account the larger aperture ##s of the iram - 2 ##m telescope at 183 ghz and the cso at 325 ghz , and the sensitivity of the telescope in the frequency range , we find that the observed line - profile of , @ xmath30 = t @ xmath31 ( 183 ) / t @ xmath31 ( 325 ) is 10 - fold if both lines are observed with the frequency of @ xmath32 the same . on the other hand , t @ xmath31 ( 183 ) @ xmath33 vs . t @ xmath30 andthe @ xmath31 ( 183 ) is well defined and need not be due to the measurement error . the observing conditions are very different during our observations at different frequencies . the lines for * and * , i . e . , @ xmath341020 , are also observed at different locations in the sky ( see figure 2 ) and show a slight difference in the # ##es of the two lines . for the lines @ xmath35 = - 1 , @ xmath36 = 0 the effective temperature of the 5 @ xmath17 - 4 @ xmath18 line matches that of the 3 @ xmath11 - 2 @ xmath12 ( the 3 @ xmath17 - 4 @ xmath18 line is , however , weaker ) . the 325 ghz line at this frequency shows a temperature profile not visible on the temperature scale ( see figure 2 ) . for the 3 @ xmath11 - 2 @ xmath12 line , the 5 @ xmath17 - 4 @ xmath18 line shows masing in space . there are also similar lines at 325 ghz , with energies of only a few percent , i . e . , much less than those found at 183 .and cer94 . these lines correspond in intensity with those observed at 183 ghz . however , @ xmath30 varies significantly from feature to feature , a fact that explains the variable nature of the line . in the central region the lines are very weak ( @ xmath373 - 2 , @ xmath26 ) . some of the weak @ xmath11 - and @ xmath12 radial velocity lines have reached temperatures below 2000 k and are only a few centimeters in diameter ( cer94 , gonzlez - alfonso 1995 ) . the observations at this frequency recorded in may 1999 also show a change in the intensity of some of these features with respect to those of cer94 . however , at frequencies where the line is dominated by the radio signal ( @ xmath35 = 16 , @ xmath36 = - 12 and @ xmath35 = 48 , @ xmath36 = - 12 for example ; see figure 3 ) and in the peripheral region ( @ xmath35 = - 12 , @ xmath36 = 48 ; figure 4 ) the line velocity and intensity does not show any significant changes between the features . a possible explanation for the 183 ghz and325 ghz emission being so extended could indicate that it results from the masing effect of material being observed in the region . this is borne out by the observation of cer94 where only the faint emissions at 183 ghz ( t @ xmath382000 - 4000 ##0 ) give indication of this spatial extension ( see below ) . the energy required to reproduce the observed surface temperature of the bright stars at 183 ghz would depend on the thermal ##ly suprathermal 183 ghz emission . however , if the 183 ghz emission were emitted from the same source than that of the 325 ghz emission , the thermal ##ar would be required to match the observed 183 ghz and 325 ghz emission . in addition , the faint and diffuse emission observed at 183 ghz in cer94 also indicates the presence of water molecules associated with the molecular clouds of the orion molecular ridge . in order to model the interaction of the two masing sources we have modeled the radiative transfer of the energy spectrum of t - t @ xmath3o for the physical properties of the orion molecular ridge . the radiative transfer model was described by gonzlez - alfonso & cernicharo ( 1997 ) , and the model consists of aa bubble with diameter of @ xmath39 , ( diameter of 15 @ xmath40 @ 450 k ) which spins at a rotational rate of m / s @ xmath26 . collisional rates between water molecules and water are estimated from _ _ _ , maluendes & mclean ( 1993 ) . the atomic mass was estimated to be 0 . 5 , and the rates were calculated to take into account the interaction between p @ xmath23o and h @ xmath23 . we consider the thermal equilibrium conditions of the first 183 nm lines of para - water @ xmath3o for different temperatures ( 15 @ xmath41 = 100 , 150 , 200 and 300 k ) , mass , p ( p - h @ xmath3o ) , and energy , ( p ( h @ xmath3 ) = @ xmath42 , @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 @ xmath45 ) . figure 1 shows the peak beam - energy ( h @ xmath31 ) ( as measured at the diameter of 15 @ xmath40 - energy ) for the 183 and 325 nm para - water lines ( narrow and broad band , respectively ) , along with @ xmat##h30 ( red line ) . these values @ xmath31 are derived from the line emission , indicating that the line emission is wave - like . analysis of fig . 2 shows that the line emission t @ xmath30 increases with n ( p - h @ xmath3o ) for higher energy transitions ( which depend on t @ xmath41 and n ( h @ xmath3 ) ) . the lines are saturated under these conditions , but the higher energy of the 183 ghz line makes this line more sensitive to values of n ( p - h @ xmath3o ) . for higher values of n ( p - h @ xmath3o ) , the 183 ghz line is saturated and the exponential decay of the 325 ghz line gives a value of @ xmath30 . however , when both the 183 and 325 ghz lines are saturated , @ xmath30 has a near zero value or is closer to zero for high n ( h @ xmath3 ) and low n @ xmath41 . the line at 183 ghz is saturated for these two conditions , although t @ xmath31 will still be at t @ xmat##h41 refers to the suprathermal nature of the line ( see cer94 ) . even for very low energy levels ( n ( p - 1 @ xmath3o ) @ xmath46 @ xmath47 ) , high temperatures ( 10 k ) and high pressures ( @ xmath42 @ xmath45 ) , the 183 ghz line has an energy greater than 10 k ( see cer94 ) . however , the range of coherent frequencies for the 1 @ xmath17 - 6 @ xmath18 line is much more limited than for the 183 ghz line , due to the high amplitude of the lines observed on the 325 ghz line ( @ xmath48 ##o ) , and to the high absorption and extinction energies of this line . this also explains the difference in spatial resolution of the lines , in that the the 325 ghz line is not connected to the ridge while the 183 ghz line is in fact located on the ridge ( cer94 ) . the two - dimensional column that contains the line r * * * @ xmath49 depends only on the observed values of n ( p @ xmath3 ) and p @ xmath##41 . the higher n ( h @ xmath3 ) and t @ xmath41 , the lower n ( p - h @ xmath3o ) that is needed to obtain an accurate estimate of the 325 ##th ##r . note . that * r * @ xmath50 is constructed from two formulas for n ( p - h @ xmath3o ) : from @ xmath51 @ xmath47 ( n ( h @ xmath3 ) = @ xmath44 @ xmath45 , t @ xmath41 = 100 k ) to @ xmath52 @ xmath47 ( n ( h @ xmath3 ) = @ xmath42 @ xmath45 , t @ xmath41 = 100 k ) . however , both of these formulas are not consistent with the above results . for n ( h @ xmath3 ) @ xmath53 @ xmath43 @ xmath45 and t @ xmath41 @ xmath54150 respectively , we find that * r * @ xmath55 = t @ xmath31 ( 325 ) in terms of @ xmath##56 * and t @ xmath31 ( 183 ) @ xmath54 @ xmath57 * . * the * * and * * * are only compatible with very high values of n ( h @ xmath3 ) and / or t @ xmath41 . the main consequence is that , for moderate values of n ( h @ xmath3 ) and / or t @ xmath41 , the collisional mechanism of the 183 ghz line is so strong that the emission from this plateau has high values for the regions that exceed t @ xmath31 ( 325 ) of 50100 k . of course , the plateau will include regions with very high pressures and temperatures ( which will eventually rise , for example , to the peak at 325 ghz and to the x band emission seen at 183 and 325 ghz ) , but these will be much smaller than the other regions of the plateau . the observed emission from the regions we observe at 183 ghz and 325 ghz is only compatible with high values of n ( h @ xmath3 ) and t @ xmath41 . in our view , the 183 ghz line will have characteristics similar to those already observed in nature ( genzel et al , 1981) , for the same kinetic energy and electron density in band i . the bright features at 185 ghz could be compared with the narrow features at 183 ghz , and with the very narrow features at 325 ghz . kinetic energies of t @ xmath58 k can be obtained for two molecule sizes , t @ xmath59 @ xmath54150 k and n ( h @ xmath3 ) @ xmath5410 @ xmath58 @ xmath45 . lower values for n ( h @ xmath3 ) and t @ xmath41 can be obtained from the analysis of large molecular systems ( e . g . , wang et al . 1987 ) , such that we have n ( h @ xmath3 ) @ xmath53 @ xmath43 @ xmath45 and t @ xmath41 = 100150 k . for these lines we have n ( t - h @ xmath3o ) in the range @ xmath60 @ xmath61 @ xmath47 , and also n ( h @ xmath3o ) in the range @ xmath62 @ xmath52 @ xmath47 . the followingthe pressure can be estimated from the temperature measurements made with high spatial resolution ( see cer94 ) . for the large solar cloud cer94 gives a total energy density of h @ xmath63 @ xmath47 . therefore , the x ( h @ xmath3o ) / h ( h ) abundance ratio of the cloud is approximately 1 , i . e . , x ( h @ xmath3o ) @ xmath28 @ xmath64 . in the iso ##bar , the 325 ghz is relatively low . our bar and the 183 ghz model give an estimate for x ( h @ xmath3o ) of a magnitude 10 @ xmath6 - 10 @ xmath7 ( see cer94 ) which is in perfect agreement with our iso ##metry ( see cernicharo et al . 1998 , 1999 ) . the study of the masing transitions resulting from the low energy distributions of h @ xmath3o allows us to determine the physical properties of the different cloud types . so far , ground - based observations of these transitions with " space telescopes are the only way to determine the energy distribution of h @ xmath3o in molecular clouds .
