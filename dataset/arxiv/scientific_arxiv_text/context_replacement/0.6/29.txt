in quantum information theory , information is stored and exchanged with a quantum system . the quantum system is constantly in contact with the external environment , which leads to decoherence in the quantum system . decoherence must be maintained for the information stored in qubits to be retrieved . there are several mechanisms to protect against decoherence . quantum error correction , abriviated by qec ##r , is one of the most promising methods to reduce quantum interference , which leads to decoherence @ xcite . by adding additional data qubits , in accordance with quantum error correction , it is possible to add a syndrome qubit to the @ xmath4 - qubit codeword in such a way that the state which depends on the original quantum system is determined by searching the set of data qubits added for the syndrome value . then the original codeword is recovered from a codeword or from a quantum error by applying a hash function , whose error value is determined by the corresponding syndrome value . in accordance with the standard scheme described in the previous section , there is a scheme in which neither syndrome ##s nor syndrome # ancilla qubits are used @ xcite . in particular , the @ xcite, a new encoding algorithm is used . a data qubit is encoded with the ancilla qubits using the same encoding circuit as the source code , in which a control signal is applied to the codeword . then , the operation of the encoding circuit is applied to a codeword , which then suffers from an error . the error state is the tensor product of the data qubit state with a bit , and the ancilla qubit state . it is possible to correct the data qubit errors by using encoding circuits with the ancilla qubits as control qubits and the data qubit as the control qubit . this approach gives two types of error correction circuits , in the following order . the underlying quantum channel is required to be strongly correlated @ xcite , which means all the qubits in the codeword are subject to the same error operators . in most practical applications of a quantum channel , the signal wavelength is typically on the order of a few centimeters or less , and the background signal , such as electromagnetic radiation , has a wavelength on the order of a few centimeters or less . then it is necessary to have all the qubits in the system suffer from the same error operators . to makethe result of the first is , we find ourselves with the values of @ xmath7 and the following , where @ xmath3 is the number of possible qubits of the codeword . we assume that there is an @ xmath4 - qubit basis which produces an @ xmath5 - qubit date state if @ xmath4 is odd and an @ xmath6 - qubit date state if @ xmath4 is even . although the algorithm is not useful as an error correction , we will describe our error correction algorithm in the next section . suppose alice wants to send qubits to them . their qubit ##s are either the codes @ xmath8 or @ xmath9 . even when they do not know which is the code alice uses , the agents still send qubits by sending two extra qubits ( when @ xmath4 is odd ) and two extra qubits ( when @ xmath4 is even ) . we describe the algorithms and discuss them in the next section . the next section is devoted to analysis and analysis . in the following , @ xmath10 is the @ xmath11th basis of the alice code and weis the basis of @ xmath12 such that @ xmath13 is zero . we have defined @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 based on the @ xmath4 - qubit ##s @ xmath16 , where @ xmath3 was mentioned earlier . let @ xmath17 be @ xmath18 - dimensional , and then @ xmath19 . denote by @ xmath20 the ( finite ) rank - @ xmath21 spectral sequence of @ xmath22 , which is the basis of @ xmath23 such that @ xmath24 for all @ xmath18 rank - @ xmath21 spectral sequence @ xmath25 @ xcite . a quantum channel of the form @ xmath26 is an @ xmath21 - dimensional quantum error correcting code ( qecc ) if and only if @ xmath27 . to prove this theorem , we need to satisfy the knill - laflamme correctability theorem , which states that for a quantum channel @ xmath28 with the form @ xmath29 , @ xmath30 is a qecc of @ xmath31 if and only if@ xmath32 , where @ xmath33 is the rank associated with the vector . @ xmath30 @ xcite . it should be clear that @ xmath34 if and only if there is a qecc with rank @ xmath21 . then it follows from @ xmath35 and the terms @ xmath36 when @ xmath4 is even and @ xmath37 when @ xmath4 is odd that the set ( [ x : corrch ] ) has an @ xmath21 - dimensional qecc if and only if @ xmath38 . showing that @ xmath39 is of rank @ xmath25 , we have @ xmath40 if and only if @ xmath41 . [ thm1 ] if @ xmath3 is odd . then @ xmath42 . our proof is simple . for @ xmath43 , then @ xmath44 . if @ xmath45 then @ xmath46 , where @ xmath47 is the number of @ xmath48 - modules from @ xmath4 onwards . since @ xmath49 we have @ xmat##h50 let @ xmath25 be the orthogonal projection onto @ xmath30 . then the general example shows that @ xmath51 and @ xmath52 . hence , @ xmath53 , which means that @ xmath54 and not @ xmath30 are defined to be in @ xmath55 - 1 qecc . _ now let us return to the general @ xmath4 example . we now have the theorem which is used to prove the theorem . [ lem1 ] let @ xmath56 be a square matrix . then the non - @ xmath21 matrix solution of @ xmath57 is the sum of the convex sections of the @ xmath58 solutions of @ xmath57 . the proof of the theorem is found in @ xcite . [ thm2 ] , @ xmath3 are diagonal . not @ xmath59 and @ xmath60 . _ now consider @ xmath61 . by definition [ thm1 ] , @ xmath62 . then @ xmath63 shows that the projection @ xmath25 onto @ xmath64 and @ x##math65 and @ xmath52 and then @ xmath66 , which gives @ xmath59 . _ since @ xmath67 is a rational number , @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 can be computed similarly . we first assume that @ xmath68 since @ xmath69 , we get @ xmath70 let us assume that @ xmath71 . we then use the formula @ xmath72 for hermitian @ xmath73 . let us replace @ xmath74 by @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 by @ xmath77 to get @ xmath78 . since @ xmath75 and @ xmath77 ##3 , @ xmath79 is rational and hence [ lem1 ] is normal . from ex . ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , we have @ xmath79 to become @ xmath80 and the remainder is @ xmath81 - - 1 . by replacing @ xmath82 and @ x##math83 using the [ lem1 ] , we find the rank - @ xmath55 projection point of @ xmath79 at the intersection of the convex hull of the @ xmath84 projections . since the projection has size @ xmath81 , the convex hull has at least two points . now using the points located in the complex plane , we can find the intersection of all the convex hull at a single point @ xmath85 , which is @ xmath71 . finally , we find @ xmath86 . from these , we have @ xmath87 and @ xmath42 . let @ xmath25 be the rank - @ xmath55 projection such that @ xmath88 . [ @ xmath89 \ ] ] where also @ xmath90 has size @ xmath91 . from @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 , we get the differential of @ xmath94 let @ xmath95 be the singular value decomposition of @ xmath96 , where @ xmath9##7 is a square - matrix and @ xmath98 . then the above equations are solved by @ xmath99 . from these equations , we get the multiplication matrix is defined by @ xmath100 \ [ \ begin { array } { cc } u & c \ \ 0 & c \ begin { array } \ ] \ [ \ begin { array } { cc } u ^ \ 0 & c \ \ 0 & c ^ \ [ \ begin { array } \ ] \ , . \ ] ] since let @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 , it follows from @ xmath103 that @ xmath104 . = @ xmath105 . then @ xmath57 and @ xmath106 are non - negative . on the other hand , the identity @ xmath107 implies @ xmath108 and not @ xmath109 , which is a contradiction . hence , @ xmath60 . in the following , we have an elementary proof of qecc for @ xmath31 . c . ( [ c : corrch ] ) with rank @ xmath4 . the result isbased on the [ thm1 ] and the inverse of @ xcite . let @ xmath110 define the @ xmath111 matrix with entries of the form @ xmath112 and the @ xmath113 [ @ xmath114 $ ] . in our qec , each @ xmath5 - qubit in @ xmath115 is replaced with an ancilla qubit @ xmath116 and @ xmath117 . then the quantum output operation @ xmath31 is applied to the original state and then the input operation @ xmath118 is applied so that the original state only appears in the output with # # ##s . our qec is then encoded as @ xmath119 where @ xmath120 . then the encoding amounts to making each of @ xmath81 basis vectors in @ xmath110 a basis vector of the original state , without restrictions . however there are several degrees of freedom in the choice of encoding . in the above example , we use an algorithm whose quantum algorithm can be implemented with the same number of cnot bits . since our quantum algorithm is the inverse of the quantumhowever , this is not possible with the same number of cnot gates . when @ xmath121 , the unitary operator @ xmath122 can be chosen as @ xmath123 when @ xmath124 , @ xmath122 can be chosen as @ xmath125 . [ nodd ] - quantum channel of the matrix @ xmath122 for @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 . [ nodd ] - qubit ##s @ xmath115 with a single ancilla qubit , produces the matrix @ xmath128 . ( a ) is for @ xmath126 and ( b ) is for @ xmath127 . the quantum channel in the figure is a unitary operator with three independent states as in above . the single ancilla state is @ xmath129 for a , @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 ( @ xmath132 and @ xmath133 ) for @ xmath126 and @ xmath129 for @ xmath134 and @ xmath135 ( @ xmath136 and @ x##math137 ) for @ xmath127 . , [ = 529 ] it follows from fig . ( [ qecc ] ) that the recovery circuit is the end of the encoding circuit . it appears , at first glance , that the examples given in fig . 1 agree with fig . ( [ qecc ] ) since the controlled not gate at the end of the recovery circuit is not in the encoding circuit . note , however , that the correct qubit is assigned to @ xmath138 , and the controlled not gate is not used without the error . we find a decoherence - invariant code when @ xmath4 is set to high . the codeword in this example is equivalent to the vector problem , which is an example of the vector / vector problem , @ xcite . let @ xmath139 denote , the vector @ xmath140 is also invariant under the action of @ xmath141 and @ xmath9 . there are @ xmath142 orthogonal vectors of the form , e . g . we construct orthogonal vectors , @ xmath143 for @ xmath144 . then we construct a decoherence- an array for @ xmath145 qubits , mapped onto this state space spanned by these vectors . it should be noted that the mapping from @ xmath25 to the state @ xmath146 is by the two vectors in question . ( [ nss ] ) is for @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 , which yields @ xmath149 . it is possible to extend this method to work with only @ xmath150 . , [ neven ] ( a ) and ( b ) are quantum circuits for ( a ) @ xmath144 and ( b ) @ xmath151 , respectively . [ neven ] - qubit ##s @ xmath115 with an ancilla qubit ##s in the box @ xmath152 . ( a ) is for @ xmath144 . ( b ) is for @ xmath151 . the quantum circuit in the box is a quantum channel with two independent states as in above . the corresponding ancilla state is in @ xmath153 , regardless of what state is on the channel . , [ = 529 ] wewe shown that there is a quantum noise problem which involves partially correlated schemes of the form @ xmath154 , in which @ xmath4 qubits are used to compute ( i ) @ xmath155 data qubit states when @ xmath4 is odd and ( ii ) @ xmath156 data qubit states when @ xmath4 is even . we have obtained these results by a matrix multiplication algorithm . neither syndrome ##s nor ancilla qubits for syndrome measurements are used in our scheme , which makes the implementation of our scheme very efficient . problems with @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 are described in detail and several quantum algorithms for our qec with the same number of cnot operations are reported . since the error operators are invariant under matrix multiplication , they can be detected only when they act on the codeword multiple times . a completely different qec has been found with @ xcite . they use a partially correlated scheme , where the error operators act on a small number of the codeword qubits only . they have shown that the quantum noise property is violated by taking advantage of noise of the signal . because of such a violation , , theoretically ,proved to be very efficient . they have also shown that the noise based on an odd number @ xmath4 of qubits can code @ xmath157 data qubits . in particular , we have measured the fully correlated error , which is the maximum error , and have shown that @ xmath158 data qubits can be encoded with an @ xmath4 - qubit codeword when @ xmath4 is odd . however , our qec with fully correlated error is incorrect . it is known that one can not code @ xmath4 qubits as data qubits for odd @ xmath4 and we have shown that one can not code @ xmath155 qubits for even @ xmath4 . ckl was supported by a 2011 fulbright grant , an hk rgc grant , the 2011 macarthur fellowship , and the 2011 shanxi university research grant . he is an associate professor of university of hong kong , beijing institute of technology , and peking university . he and ht were supported by ` ` university research network ' ' grant for chinese universities : research project grant from mext ( ministry of education , culture , sports , science and2 ) . ytp was supported by a uk government grant . nss was supported by a hk rgc grant .
