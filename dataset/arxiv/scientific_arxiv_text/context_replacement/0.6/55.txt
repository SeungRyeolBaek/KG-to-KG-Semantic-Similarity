the construction of background field theory for n = 2 anti - yang - mills theory ( sym ) in projective hyperspace ( @ xmath0 ) @ xcite is an open problem . such a construction is possible for any ( non - ) supersymmetric theory because it allows ( theoretical ) connections and is equivalent to the gauge theory . the main problem in solving this problem for the n = 2 case seems to be the lack of information about the gauge theory to the projective hyperfield @ xmath1 , which is the sym multiplet for all practical calculations @ xcite . we assume that the papers related @ xcite n = 2 harmonic superspace ( @ xmath2 ) @ xcite . we solve this problem . the hyperfield , @ xmath3 of the sym multiplet is itself a tropical , @ xmath4 . in fact , background field theory in projective superspace is just a simple construction @ xcite . although the construction raises many problems , it has been published in a number of papers dealing with the results @ xcite . in this way , we solve the problem of constructing the background field theory in projective superspace without the need for describing the physics involved .instead of @ xmath1 . this is done by allowing the classical fields to be in the ` real ' representation ( @ xmath5 ) and the background fields to be in the ` imaginary ' representation ( @ xmath6 ) . this is reminiscent of the non - chiral , non - linear fields found in n = 2 superspace @ xcite . what this does is make the classical field independent of @ xmath7 and dependent on background fields ( like @ xmath8 ) with ` spin ' greater than @ xmath9 ( since the first term is a spinor ) . non - dependence of @ xmath9 - on background fields ( like @ xmath7 ) is a necessary condition for the self - renormalization theorem to hold as stated in @ xcite . this also leads to a proof of this in 1 - loop . ( a different method for proof of this has been found in @ xcite . ) the dependence of classical fields to background fields comes from the local quantum projective field theory , which improves the algebraic calculations a bit . the calculations are further advanced beyond 1 - loop . the @ xmath10 - dimensions turn out to be useful since the background fieldsa trivial @ xmath10 - integration . this means that the @ xmath10 - integral also disappears from the group , and as seen from the supergraph rules , only the @ xmath11 - integral remains at the end of the group . we can work in the - background , so there are no other problems to worry about when using the super - graph rules . another important issue is the loop structure of the ghosts in this new gauge . apart from the usual faddeev - popov ( fermionic @ xmath12 ) and cohen - kallosh ( bosonic @ xmath13 ) ghosts , we have two possible string ghosts , the real bosonic @ xmath14 and the fermionic @ xmath15 . this is in contrast to n = 2 sym which is similar to the loop structure of n = 2 ghosts . heuristically , we can easily see that such a string theory would have a trivial @ xmath16 - integral for n = 2 . however , we can see that the loop structure of @ xmath1 and other ghosts have different properties , due to the @ xmath17 ghosts . these are also importantto the ` almost zero ' effects in the @ xmath2 case , which manifest themselves at closed - form form via the equations of dynamics of forward - motion . however , the @ xmath0 case , we do not see the fundamental effects . instead the effects turn out to be harmonic , due to the combination of the usual hyperfield action , and that of the extra ghosts . the fundamental effects in the second case are caused by these extra ghosts only . this formulation is also based on the standard projective superspace formulation of sym given by @ xcite . we use it only here for the sake of clarity . we will use the 6d formulation to solve some important problems involving the partial derivatives and finally , the effects carry over to n = 1 6d sym in a straightforward way with this formulation . the projective hyperspace consists of four spacetime coordinates ( @ xmath18 ) , four fermionic ones ( @ xmath11 ) and the complex coordinate system cp @ xmath19 ( @ xmath10 ) . the corresponding n = 1 superspace contains four complex fermionic ones ( @ xmath20 ) in addition to these projective coordinates . thenon - zero derivatives corresponding to these two @ xmath20 ##s form a projective hyperfield ( @ xmath21 ) via the constant @ xmath22 . the sum of the two derivatives can be written as . we note here that in the ` polar ' representation ( the ` internal ' representation @ xcite and the one we used earlier in this paper ) the @ xmath23 ##s are @ xmath10 - 1 . their non - zero relation for the @ xmath10 representation is such that we see here : @ xmath24 the projective hypermultiplet is represented by an ` internal ' hyperfield ( @ xmath25 ) that contains all non - zero powers of @ xmath10 and the projective hypermultiplet by a ` polar ' @ xmath1 , which contains all powers of @ xmath10 . to define the vector space , the integral of this polar representation is assumed to be the usual vector space , with the origin being the circle around the origin ( for our use in this paper ) . thus , the projective integral theorem holds : @ xmath26 ( with the constant ##s of @ xmath27theorem ( ) . now , we are going to go into the case of the background gauge theories . the background gauge theories , @ xmath28 , with m = \ sym satisfy the following ( non - ) gauge theories ( written in 6d notation ) : @ xmath29 = - _ { } w _ a ^ { } \ , , \ \ \ { _ { } } , w _ b ^ { } \ } = { { \ cal ##c } } _ { { } _ { } ^ { } - \ tfrac { { \ pi { \ pi } } } { - } - _ { { } } _ { } ^ { } \ , , \ \ [ _ { } , ^ { } ] = - _ ^ { [ } _ ^ { ] } \ , , \ \ [ _ { } , _ x ] = _ { } \ , , \ \ [ _ { } , _ x ] = - \ , , \ { { dyd } \ { { 0 } \ ] ] where the su ( 2 ) theories @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 are the gauge theories , and @ xmath33is the product of two vectors . the 4d - chiral field strength , @ xmath34 is related to the spinor field strength via the spinor tensor . we obtain the equivalence relation for @ xmath35 by setting @ xmath36 , where @ xmath37 is an arbitrary projective hyperfield . we can choose a background splitting of @ xmath37 ( up to n = 2 superspace ) such that @ xmath38 with @ xmath39 as the full exterior derivative . we can also choose ` analytic ' representations for the background splitting of such that @ xmath40 . this is the @ xmath10 - dependence of the connection : @ xmath41 since these representations have an @ xmath10 - dependence , the @ xmath10 - dependence in the real case can be easily solved . similarly , the real representation of the full exterior derivative of can be chosen to be the ` analytic ' representations , @ xmath42 , @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 . the projective ( real ) representation of hyperfields ` belongs ' to @ xmath45 . we canwe consider the background projective hyperfield @ xmath46 and @ xmath47 such that @ xmath48 . then , the vector hypermultiplet ##ic action is : @ xmath49 the vector hyperfield @ xmath1 s action is the same as in the general case ; the difference is that the @ xmath1 action here is in the special case and not background projective : @ xmath50 we know from @ xcite that this expression should be the same for @ xmath7 and that the ` s ' expression for vector hyperfields is a good approximation . the gauge action of @ xmath1 follows from the projective derivatives and the corresponding complex action of . the following formula can be used for proving that and using the formulas from the previous section : @ xmath51 _ ^ 2 \ , , \ \ _ { 12 } ^ y _ { 12 } ^ 3 = \ , [ y _ { 12 } { { \ cal { } } _ { } + \ tfrac { 1 } { 1 } y _ { 12 } ^ 3 { \ cal { } } + \ tfrac { 1 } { 1 } y _ { 12 } ^ 3{ \ , ( } _ { , } ^ { } _ { , } + w _ { } ^ _ { , } + \ { { \ cal ##c } } _ { } { \ , ) } + w _ { 2 } ^ { _ { , } ^ { \ , ] _ { 2 } ^ { \ , , \ , { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath52 is the gauge - invariant dalembertian and @ xmath53 . since the two numbers do not appear anywhere in the theory , we will note the use of different symbols to represent the background gauge ( as has been mentioned above ) and use the symbol ` @ xmath54 ' for @ xmath55 from now on . the calculation process of the background gauge is similar to the classical one . the second dimensions are also gauge - invariant , but @ xmath56 is represented by @ xmath57 ( not @ xmath58 ) . . however , we need no assumptions for the theory to be valid in this case as we see it in the next section . the background hypermultiplet is not projective but the geometry of the frame is still the samenot in the ordinary case . that is the differential equation used in the equation of motion : @ xmath59 , @ xmath42 , @ xmath60 and above . so the derivation of the equations used in @ xcite goes further , with these results : @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 : @ xmath63 the point - method for the first hypermultiplet due to faddeev - popov ( fp ) , is not applicable to the ordinary case and we can get the result with some modifications : @ xmath64v _ 1 \ , ; \ text { sgfinv } \ \ { { \ cal ##c } } _ { fp } & = -

like term ( @ xmath65 ) . let us write the equation for @ xmath1 with and @ xmath66 . this equation will be discussed later . we will take the energy term , @ xmath1 from the wave equation and the vector hypermultiplet , to get @ xmath67 _ { 12 } ^ 2 x _ 1 \ nonumber \ \ = & -

invariant phase space : @ xmath69 \ frac { 1 } { 2y _ { tr } ^ 2 } v _ 2 - dx \ , d ^ 4 \ , d _ 1 \ , d _ 2v _ 1 \ , \ } \ nonumber \ \ = & - \ frac { { \ text { tr } } } { 2 ^ 2 } \ right \ { \ int dx \ , d ^x \ , y _ { 1 , 2 } \ , y _ 2 \ , [ x + \ frac { -

1 + x _ { ( y _ { 02 } ) } { } \ , ] = ( y _ { 02 } ) \ , . \ ] ] with ( [ eomf ] ) and ( [ fjk ] ) of the form ( [ svj ] ) , we get @ xmath75 which leads to the vector action , as follows ( for the general case ) from @ xcite @ xmath76 this expression gives @ xcite for @ xmath65 to @ xmath77 ##7 for the vector frame of the effective action @ xmath78 for the vector frame , the coordinate transformation also leads to the action obtained from the fp action , which leads to the closed - form action . to see that , consider the effective action @ xmath79 given by the following expression : @ xmath80 where @ xmath81 is obtained by the addition of @ xmath82 . this gives @ xmath83 where ( [ expg ] ) simpl##ifies to @ xmath84 we can write the third term as @ xmath85 where @ xmath86 are the hyperfields . then similar to the previous example @ xcite , we take @ xmath87 and a non - kallosh ( nk ) ghost @ xmath13 to solve for the second jacobian . this means the 2 - d method for n = 4 sym leads to this sum to : @ xmath88 for n = 4 , the second hypermultiplet is the adjoint product and this sum will give the corresponding fp and nk ##p respectively . the last two terms are the contributions due to the @ xmath17 contribution . their background contribution has to be ignored , which will turn out to be the case if we take this step further . to calculate the contribution of @ xmath86 ##s ##n to the path integral , we need to include a real ghost @ xmath14 and a real ghost @ xmath15 as follows : @ xmath89 where @ xmath90 is the background contribution of a fermionic ##ons @ xmath91 and abosonic action @ xmath92 and the corresponding quantum action for n = 2 sym relative to r is : @ xmath93 + s _ { fp } ( v , e , r ) + s _ { nk } ( v , e ) + s _ { xr } ( v , e , r ) + s _ { } ( r , ) . \ ] ] the fp and nk ghosts are real projective hyperfields . the actions for these ghosts are the same as those in the case of non - standard fields . the action for fp ghosts is given by : ( [ fpaction ] ) and that for nk ghosts is related to the original hypermultiplet quantum action . that and their action are related : and . @ xmath94 here , we focus on the last part of the quantum quantum action : the classical ghost . in the same way as the original hypermultiplet , we can continue the analysis of these ghosts . let us now focus on the classical action , where the fermionic action can be treated as : @ xmath95x _ 2 \ \ = & \ , - \ frac { { \ begin { tr} } } { 4 } dx d ^ 4dy _ { 1 , 2 } \ , x _ 1 \ left [ { \ left ( } \ frac { x _ 1 } { y _ { 12 } } + \ frac { x _ 1 } { y _ { 12 } } { \ right ) } \ frac { 4 } { y _ { 12 } ^ 2 } { \ widehat { } } \ right ] x _ 1 \ \ = & \ , -

dependent form of @ xmath56 ) , which will align the action with the external fields and background fields . for the first dimension , we can also solve the field equation by assuming that the operators have @ xmath104 - 1 and the field operators have as a factor as the .due to the nature of @ xmath105 . 0 , we can take them from the very beginning and start with the corresponding vector and coordinate for the purpose of calculating it . let us just list all the relevant gauge diagrams here . @ xmath106 { \ left ( } { \ widehat { } } -

invariant calculations ##wise ) is not done via the diagrams given here . we note that such an effect occurs in the n = 2 gauge theory only when the gauge multiplets of complex numbers are used . the computation can only be done covariantly and the following equations exist in addition to the equations . [ [ vector ] ] + + + + + + + the contribution to one - loop fixed - point theory from the hypermultiplet diagram in the plane would be given by the following: @ xmath107 where the corresponding expression : @ xmath108 is the maximum of s . as such , to calculate the maximum @ xmath109 - s , at least one @ xmath110 should be taken from the diagram and calculate @ xmath111 . the other non - trivial result is from the n - point diagram : @ xmath112 too many @ xmath17 will lead to an @ xmath113 problem , leading to ` the ghost ' problem in @ xmath2 . these problems arise when we take into account the @ xmath114 equation .

( [ 4pfinite ] ) gives the corresponding fixed - point vector measure . assuming them to be gauge invariant , we can then extend this result in terms of the su ( 2 ) symmetry , and use the reduction to 3 - space to get @ xmath120 where we extend the reduction to 4d for @ xmath121 . using this and the fact that @ xmath122 is equivalent to @ xmath123 , we get the corresponding loop - holomorphic2 - loop correction ( with the additional superspace of @ xmath124 ) to the = = sym is very small when compared to the correction done by @ xcite ( for similar reasons to @ xmath2 and , for example , @ xcite ) . [ [ 1 ] ] 2 - loop + + + + + + + we can also see that there are no significant contributions at 2 - loops . the result is similar to that obtained in the previous case , _ i . e . _ , number of possible @ xmath125 s . the loop diagrams shown in fig . [ v2hbg ] are supposed to apply to 2 - loops . none of them would be equivalent to the @ xmath126 - case unless we get at least 3 @ xmath110 s from the sum of the loops . this , as we have seen above , results in no sufficient @ xmath56 s . these 2 - loop diagrams apply . however , we have that the result of @ xcite . in our case since there is no contribution in @ xmath7 , there will not be any contribution at 2 or 3 loops from the sum of . this result is notthan @ xmath2 where the ` n - 1 ' s are used and is similar to the one given above . pairs of @ xmath35 also need to be considered and at some point they can be directly applied @ xcite . we then use the background theory basis for n = 4 , 4d projective superspace . the key step was to show that analytic representations for vector and finite fields of the hypermultiplets were possible . such a representation for the background theory allowed self - renormalization results to be proved , since the two - dimensional particles involved are spinors . the simple choice of a basis for the background theory allows one to perform a linear transformation of the usual ` normal ' d - field according to the usual transformation rules . however , there are extra ghosts needed ( apart from fp and nk ghosts ) to obtain the usual sym - theory . these extra ghosts only exist in the vector case . in projective case , they replace the invariant ` normal ' parts coming from the hypermultiplet in a natural way and the remaining invariant parts are as follows for n = 4 . the d - parts come mainly from the normal ( fp and nk ) , and .hypermultiplet . however , their values can not be directly expressed in the way presented , for example , see : [ 2 ] . we also have a complete 2 - loop proof for existence of n = 1 sym . with matter . this is best illustrated by the double - expansion of @ xcite in mind , which then leads to a proof for existence of 1 - loop . for n = 1 with matter , there are similar techniques as showcased in @ xcite and our hope is that these techniques could be equivalent to what we have shown in this paper . that would lead to a further extension of the 2 - loop proof and also the complete proof of the additional hypermultiplet and 1 - loop results . this research project was funded in part by research grant no . phy - 0969739 .
