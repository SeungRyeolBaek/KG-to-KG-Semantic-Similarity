the latest models , such as sneia ( cosmic dust ii ) , flare ( cosmic microwave background ) and large scale models , rely on the fact that a single space and time dependent energy component , known as dark energy , accounts for only @ xmath1 % of the total content of matter . many mathematical models that can model the physical properties of dark energy were proposed in recent years , a few of them coming from the theoretical physics @ xcite and the others being the phenomenological @ xcite . dark energy may also exist as a particle and thus satisfy the fundamental energy requirement @ xcite . in these mathematical models , the equations are either mathematical ( if they are derived from the spacetime curvature alone ) or physical ( if they depend upon gravitational effects ) . mathematical models are certainly physics - specific , but the quantites are more general . about 100 years ago , the first fundamental problem with gravity was solved at physics . @ xcite , but the problem was seen as a problem only at high energies in the early 1990s . goenner et al . published a comprehensive study of the gravity problem @ xcite , in which the equation for .the pgt ( poincar ##t theory of time ) experiments were successful although they only solved the theory of few fundamental problems . recently , researchers have started to consider gravity as the main cause of the accelerating universe @ xcite . they and collaborators @ xcite propose an explanation for the accelerating universe in terms of a pseudo - cartan theory : @ ##al ##g . they explore the possibility that the dynamic pgt geometry , and the nature of the pgt field , is the driving force . with the necessary properties of curvature and curvature of space and the ##ity of the different time and energy scales , they show that these effects could play the role of kinetic energy . part of the reason was to avoid confusion in the initial description of connection effects @ xcite . however , it also was found that non - linear connection effects are more likely to cause strong interactions @ xcite . the non - linear interactions turned out to play a crucial role for the important present day topic : the accelerating universe . among the dynamic pgt , the particle interactions fall into three categories with different time and energy : @ xmath2 , @ xmath3 , @ xmath4. these results suggest that @ xmath4 may not be the only known dynamic pgt of modes @ xcite . the pseudoscalar mode @ xmath5 is not dominated by the intrinsic properties of the system , so it naturally interacts with other modes . however , it is generally accepted that the torsion must be small and have small magnitude at the late time of the calculations . this is a major reason why we should not dwell on this problem at the present time . on the other hand , the global curvature @ xmath6 does not interact in a very large way with any known source of modes @ xcite , therefore one can interpret it as having small mass and thus not being too large . however , there is a nearly non - zero value for the global global curvature since @ xmath6 modes can interact only with the non - vanishing equations . the existence and existence of modes have received strong support from experimental results , which greatly supports the possible interpretation of non - vanishing equations . under the conditions of homogeneity and symmetry , @ xmath6 mode has only a partial derivative and thus cannot be interpreted as the result of the time - .. . therefore , the dynamic systems with the constant will have a state where the effects will change to small effects after some time . we note here that one should not focus on the present time , where one could still see small effects ( but their effects would need to be distinguished from the large effects ) , and substitutionally look for examples of the effects at the later time of the system @ xcite . therefore , the fine - tuning problem is one of the most important problems for the model of @ xcite . and a good model should avoid the fine - tuning as much as possible . the variable nature of the expansion constant has been shown to make the late ##nt evolution of the system correspond to the current state of the system and this avoids the fine - tuning problem @ xcite . however , wang et al @ xcite have shown that the expansion parameter and @ xmath7 provide an appropriate value for the expansion mode respectively . the two other parameters , i . e . , the expansion parameter @ xmath8 and the constant parameter @ xmath9 , are more appropriate parameters to describe the system .of course , they may also have different acceleration ##s . , because a large number of them do not lead to the same accelerating trajectory of @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 . recently , sahni , saini , starobinsky and alam @ xcite have identified the statefinder parameters @ xmath12 : @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 . this is also a possible evolutionary step between @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 . moreover , as already stated in the article @ xcite , the statefinder parameters which are exactly the same , are used to generate a number of new models . . through the use of statefinder parameters in the quantum field theory , we understand exactly why the einstein field equations describe the expansion of the universe only at late time . if the new models of statefinder have a similar mechanism ( @ xmath15 ) at late time , then we can understand why the expansion of the universe until @ xmath16 is not in the einstein field relation . in this way , we apply the statefinder parameters to the field theory . we see that there are many types of statefinder parameters for thea model that can be distinguished from the other two models . the statefinder models show that the universe already has an accelerating expansion at low energies ( late time ) and a slowing expansion at high energies ( early time ) . thus , standard model models can solve some of the problems which arise in other models . however , the effects of gravity can make the expansion rate increase when it increases @ xmath17 or @ xmath18 . whether the model has properties which are difficult to understand in the same general case is a major issue for further study . the gravitational effect of the expansion has already been shown for the braneworld model @ xcite and the quasi - steady state model @ xcite . we find that statefinder diagnostic has a direct effect on the model ##ity of the early universe . one of the most important properties of the model is that there are points and lines with the number of points in the direction of the expansion rate @ xmath19 . in this way , we compare the standard model model to the type of model ##e and f .is consistent with the theory . therefore , we have preliminarily the method for the determination of the various statefinder ##s . pgt @ xcite has been proposed as an attractive approach to general relativity because of its gauge theory and other properties . pgt based on the levi - cartan geometry , allows for the curvature in addition to curvature . the basic form of the levi - cartan geometry is @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 is the levi - civita connection and @ xmath22 is the metric tensor . similarly , the ricci curvature and complex curvature can be written as @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 are the intrinsic ricci curvature and complex curvature , respectively , and @ xmath26 is the complex tensor with the levi - civita connection ( for a detailed description . . . . ) use of pgt allows us to use the term ` ` null tensor ' ' . in this case , the differential form of the equation can be written as @ xcite @ xmath27 \ { } , \ { { trestrct } \ ] ] where the equation @ xmath28is the trace of the metric . thus , the ricci curvature and metric curvature can be written : @ xmath29 the governing lagrangian equation for the curvature mode is @ xmath30 where @ xmath31 and @ xmath0 have a constant term . note that the metric @ xmath32 is associated with the metric curvature of @ xmath33 , and that @ xmath32 should be called @ xcite . thus , the governing equations of the metric curvature are @ xmath34 where @ xmath35 is the total energy - momentum tensor and @ xmath36 is the trace of the metric curvature corresponding to the corresponding total energy - momentum tensor : @ xmath37 since these models use a metric metric , we can work with the gauge invariant newton - like metric @ xmath38 $ ] , where @ xmath39 is the scale factor . this gives the associated ricci curvature and metric curvature : @ xmath40 where @ xmath39 is the scale factor , and @ xmath10 is the coupling constant . the metric @ xmath41 should be .as time passes , then one can write @ xmath42 ( @ xmath43 , the rotation mode ) and the other variables as . the resulting equations of motion for the space - based model are thus : @ xmath44 where @ xmath45 and the energy level of the particle @ xmath46 one can write the variables and the vector . @ xmath47 where @ xmath48 is the absolute value of the constant and @ xmath49 is the unit vector . after the transformation ( [ dt ] ) , the . ( [ dth ] ) - ( [ dtr ] ) are unchanged . after transformation , the variables @ xmath50 , @ xmath10 , @ xmath51 and @ xmath52 , and the parameters @ xmath53 , @ xmath0 , @ xmath54 and @ xmath32 are all dimensionless . however , the general case is @ xmath55 . for the case of the rotation mode , the total energy - momentum tensor can be represented by @ xmath56 \ , , \ end { torpre } \ end { scale } \ ] ] and the off - diagonaland . . the total equation is @ xmath57 which is derived from general relativity . @ xmath58 is the static solution , and the corresponding equation of motion is @ xmath59 which is given by the above equation . , the temporal component of the curvature @ xmath51 , the metric tensor curvature @ xmath52 and the acceleration parameter @ xmath11 as functions of time . we have chosen the parameters @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 and the initial values @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] , the temporal component of the curvature @ xmath51 , the metric tensor curvature @ xmath52 and the acceleration parameter @ xmath11 as functions of time . we have chosen the parameters @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 and the initial values @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 . , title = " fig : " , width = 268 ] in the case of @ xmath65 , wang et al showed that thethese modes may provide an additional component to the expansion rate of the parameter @ xcite . this latter aspect can be seen in fig . [ hqevol ] where we take values @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 , @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 and at the same time @ xmath66 . according to the ( [ 3 ] ) , the initial value of the first mode is positive . however , @ xmath10 is non - constant at all times and @ xmath67 is constant now , which means the expansion of the universe is already accelerating . the value of @ xmath11 changes from positive to negative when the universe is expanding @ xmath68 , which is the time the universe begins to expand . however , the resulting behavior is dependent on the nature of the universe and the values of the parameters . therefore , the second mode alone is insufficient to solve the fine - tuning problem in the case of @ xmath65 . in the above example , we ll use the statefinder and perform the same calculations for different values of the parameter @ x##math0 . for the time independent @ xmath69cdm , the statefinder parameters correspond to a constant radiation @ xmath70 and @ xmath71 for the standard model dark matter model ( scdm ) has constant radiation . since the standard models have only the # ##al curvature ( the fundamental parameter of the einstein - cartan spacetime ) , the particle acceleration model is assumed to have an extreme symmetry in comparison with the high symmetry models . therefore , a statefinder parameter is required to satisfy these equations . let us now consider the particle accelerating model in detail . from 1 . ( [ dth ] ) - ( [ fieldrho ] ) , we have the accelerator parameters @ xmath72 ( 432a _ { 1 } b ^ { 3 } ) ^ { - 1 } \ , , \ label { torsionq } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] and the statefinder parameters @ xmath73 ( 108a _ { 1 } b ^ { 3 } ) ^ { - 1 } \ , , \ nonumber \ \ \ label { torsionr } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] and @xmath74 } { 3bh \ left [ ( 3 \ mu + 1 ) ( 36h ^ { 2 } - 24h \ mu + 1 \ mu ^ { 2 } - 3r ) - 3 \ mu + \ } ] } \ , . \ begin { align } \ begin { align } \ ] ] in the following we can plot the statefinder for two different values of the expansion of @ xmath0 , respectively . first , we plot the time evolution of the statefinder ##s @ xmath12 and @ xmath75 in the plane of @ xmath76 . in fig . [ planecase4 ] , we plot the ##s in the @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 planes , where we consider respectively @ xmath79 and @ xmath80 . we see then that the expansion varies with temperature and pressure in the equatorial plane of @ xmath77 ##8 , and the expansion gets larger and larger as function of temperature . the values in the @ xmath78 plane are more complex , so we denote the values by the odd number . the odd number of .##s from finite to infinite , and the evolving # s from infinite to finite . these are non - linear , which leads to the following system of equations . first , the curves will eventually reach @ xmath69cdm point @ xmath70 . next , we consider the time evolution of the statefinder ##s @ xmath12 and @ xmath75 for the case of @ xmath81 . we consider the curves in the . [ planecase3 ] , where we have the @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 . we see then that the time inflation is caused by the large absolute values of the evolving curves of @ xmath77 ##8 , and the curves eventually converge into @ xmath69cdm point . the evolving curves go into a climbing - up stage first , then go into a climbing - down stage at the @ xmath78 ##1 . finally , they converge to @ xmath69cdm point @ xmath70 . finally , the last stage is a curve that starts from @ xmath70 and goes back to @ xmath70 ,and others are in the form of arrows . and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath84 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath85 and @ xmath86 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath84 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath85 and @ xmath86 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath87 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath87 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width =264 ] and @ xmath90 planes for the case of @ xmath91 , where we choose @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] and @ xmath90 planes for the case of @ xmath91 , where we choose @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 257 ] and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath94 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath95 and @ xmath86 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] and @ xmath78 planes for the case of rotation parameter @ xmath94 , where we choose the parameters @ xmath95 and @ xmath86 . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution . , title = " fig : " , width = 257 ] next , we show the time evolution of the system for thecase of @ xmath96 . we plot evolving times in fig . [ planecase2 ] , where we have chosen @ xmath97 and @ xmath98 . however , the cosmic time will vary since the temperature is constant . @ xmath99 , @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 get larger and larger together , then less and less as the cosmic time progresses . finally , we plot the time evolution of the statefinder ##s @ xmath12 and @ xmath75 in the case of @ xmath18 . in fig . [ planecase1 ] , we plot evolving times in the @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 cases , where we have chosen @ xmath102 and @ xmath80 . we see then that the evolving times correspond to the case of @ xmath103 because they cross the @ xmath69cdm boundary . to sum up , it is fairly easy to see that the electromagnetic fields will be the driving force of the system for the case of @ xmath0 . however , this is dependent on the##sion shows that there is a slow ( @ xmath15 ) expansion and an accelerating ( @ xmath104 ) expansion . the statefinder parameters show that the model only has an accelerating expansion at low speeds ( late time ) and a slow expansion at high speeds ( early time ) for the case of @ xmath105 and @ xmath18 . however , the expansion parameters can solve many of the problems which arise in experimental models . if we consider the possibility of non - solution of the expansion equations , we can use the ##ization , i . e . , @ xmath17 . in this case , the presence of matter will make the expansion rate vary . with small values of the expansion parameter , it is possible to estimate the half - life of the model , as well as its lifetime . it is worth noting that the exact values of the statefinder parameters of the model should be determined in time - efficient methods . in addition , @ xmath106 can be derived from many other experimental models , like the m - wave model . so there are many applications for the statefinder method of the parameters ?if the dynamic analysis @ xmath0 is divided into two parts by the statefinder it is very interesting . in fact , the statefinder answer has a big effect on the development of dynamic models . therefore , we will use the dynamic analysis in this article . 1 . ( [ dth ] ) - ( [ dtr ] ) is an autonomous system , so we can use the differential form of ordinary differential equations . critical points are often called # ##s in the theory of complex autonomous systems . these points are usually the critical points of the system and they affect the system behavior . if the equations include the critical points they can be divided into a heteroclinic orbit and a homoclinic orbit ( a closed orbit ) . the heteroclinic orbit has two distinct critical points and homoclinic orbit is an orbit with a critical point to itself . in the dynamic theory of systems , the heteroclinic orbit is very interesting @ xcite . if the dynamic parameter is associated with the critical point , then we can consider different types of heteroclinic orbits . according to : ( [ dth ] ) - ( [ dtr ] ), we then find the critical points and control the evolution of these points . putting the values @ xmath107 , @ xmath108 and @ xmath109 of the critical points into the linear equations , to the critical point of the system , gives the stability of the linear equations , from which we could calculate the solution . this requires the first term of the terms to be zero . there are three critical points @ xmath110 of the system as : @ xmath111 where @ xmath112 , @ xmath113 and @ xmath114 . the corresponding values of the critical points ( i ) - ( ii ) are @ xmath115 and q . ( [ criticalpoints ] ) , we see that there is only one critical point @ xmath116 in the direction of @ xmath76 . from q . ( [ stability ] ) , the corresponding value is @ xmath117 , where @ xmath118 is an ideal stable point . if we solve the linear equations ,thus , . ( [ dth ] ) - ( [ dtr ] ) is equivalent to @ xmath119 + the linear system ( [ dthphirlinear ] ) has an exact periodic solution @ xmath120 where @ xmath121 , @ xmath122 , @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 , @ xmath125 and @ xmath126 are critical points . therefore , @ xmath127 is the critical point of stability for the linear system . ( [ hrphips ] ) . in other words , there are no exact periodic solutions for the linear system , but there are quasi - periodic solutions for the center for the quantum field theory . this class of quasi - periodic solutions appears in the statefinder starting with the solution of @ xmath76 . @ @ * = @ = critical point & stability & @ xmath128 & stable + ( ` i ` ) & unstable & @ xmath129 & stable + ( ` ii ` ) & positive pole & - 1 & unstable + ( ` iii ` ) & negative pole & - 1 & unstable + ( ` iv ` )& saddle & - 1 & unstable + ( ` ii ` ) & saddle & - 1 & unstable + @ l * & @ l * * & focus & @ xmath128 & unstable + ( ` iii ` ) & focus & @ xmath130 & unstable + ( ` ii ` ) & saddle & - 1 & unstable + ( ` iv ` ) & saddle & - 1 & unstable + ( ` iv ` ) & saddle & - 1 & unstable + ( ` iii ` ) & saddle & - 1 & unstable + in the case of @ xmath131 , the critical point ( i ) is a positive or de ##pressing point and ( iii ) is a negative point . the coordinates of the critical point are shown in fig [ cripointsa1l0 ] . the de # model shows that gravitational theory is an interesting subject and the resulting gravitational constant is an important mathematical tool for physics . in the physical domain of galaxies , the heteroclinic orbit is also important . using numerical methods , we map the heteroclinic orbit from the critical point case ( i ) to case ( iii ) in space . [ heteroclinicorbit ]. this heteroclinic orbit is roughly analogous to the one in fig . [ planecase3 ] , which goes from @ xmath69cdm point to @ xmath69cdm point . thus , the loops with the shape of circles correspond to etc . with @ xmath132 . the heteroclinic orbit connects the focus points case ( i ) to case ( ii ) . we take @ xmath133 . , width = 321 ] with @ xmath94 . we take @ xmath134 and the intermediate point @ xmath135 . @ xmath136 is an extremely stable focus point . , width = 321 ] in the case of @ xmath96 , there is only one focus point @ xmath116 where the maximum size of the @ xmath128 belongs to @ xmath129 . however , the results in fig . [ planecase2 ] show that @ xmath99 , @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 get larger and larger , and less and less as time passes . in the case of @ xmat##h18 , the coordinates of the observation points are given in fig [ cripointsa1l - 2 ] . the points correspond to the stable saddle ( see fig . 1 ) and the boundary with @ xmath137 . finally , the lines pass through the @ xmath69cdm boundary . in fig . @ xcite , the authors have compared the initial values of the experimental model with the experimental data , in which they specified the initial values @ xmath48 , @ xmath138 and @ xmath139 , and two parameters @ xmath0 and @ xmath32 . after this comparison , we fixed the initial values , and compared the experimental model to the type of experimental data . the experimental data also specified a single value of the first parameter @ xmath140 as a function of the @ xmath141 in place of the parameters @ xmath0 and @ xmath32 when we compared the data . note the relationship between @ xmath142 and the comoving parameter @ xmath143 ( where @ xmath141 is the co##hift of ( x ) @ xmath144 and the non - linear model for a rough surface @ xmath145 where @ xmath146 is the scale parameter . in general , the approach towards determining the observed parameters @ xmath140 is to construct an empirical ansatz for @ xmath140 which is not only theoretically consistent but is specifically designed to be a good fit to the parameters for @ xmath147 . given a suitable experimental model for @ xmath148 where @ xmath149 has scale parameters , the maximum likelihood method can be used to determine the best possible estimate of , as well as the quality of the fit of the model to the data . the model can be described as follows : the observed parameters consist of @ xmath150 , errors @ xmath151 and errors @ xmath152 with their associated values @ xmath153 and @ xmath154 . these values are assumed to be small and constant . the observed magnitude @ xmath155 is equal to the observed magnitude of @ xmath156 . @ xmath##157 + 1 , \ ] ] where @ xmath158 is the absolute magnitude . for the model sneia , we can also express their absolute magnitude @ xmath159 and as @ xmath141 , because the absolute magnitude @ xmath158 of them is assumed to be constant , i . e . , the values are denoted ##ised . therefore , the distance distance @ xmath147 is the ` free distance ' between the measured absolute magnitude @ xmath160 and the absolute magnitude @ xmath140 . therefore , we take the offset @ xmath161 and express it in terms of the dimensionless ` planck - einstein distance ' value of @ xmath162 and as @ xmath163 or @ xmath164 where the distance distance @ xmath165 depends on @ xmath48 ( or @ xmath166 ) or @ xmath167 the best known value @ xmath168 of the model of a particular magnitude @ xmath169 can be expressed as @ xcite @ xmath170 however , the best value is for the modelparameters ( @ xmath171 ) of the model are obtained by computing the parameters @ xmath172 ^ 2 } { \ sigma _ i ^ 2 } . \ ] ] since the model parameter @ xmath165 is model - independent , the data from the corresponding model parameter can be used for model checking of the parameter @ xcite and one can choose _ a priori _ value of x ( equivalently , the value of dimensionless wave function @ xmath166 ) and integrate ##s it as : @ xmath173 where @ xmath174 ^ 2 } { \ sigma _ i ^ 2 } , \ ] ] @ xmath175 } { \ sigma _ i ^ 2 } , \ ] ] and @ xmath176 in the worst case , instead of choosing @ xmath177 , one can choose @ xmath178 which is independent of @ xmath165 . the equation .

[ 192clcontours3 ] . for the case of @ xmath188 , we should use the above decimal expansion . weierstrass @ xcite ##r derived the exponential family of elliptic functions from the coefficients of the series . for the coefficients @ xmath189 ( @ xmath190 ) , the series @ xmath182 becomes a series [ @ xmath191 . \ ] ] where the coefficients @ xmath192 are then defined as follows . ( [ e##2 ] ) and @ xmath193 can be determined from ref . ( [ e1 ] ) . the power series is an unknown function @ xmath194 which is able to be determined from @ xmath195 by direct analytic continuation . this process can be applied any number of times . in the first case we need to consider a sequence of power series @ xmath195 , @ xmath194 , . . . , @ xmath196 , each of which is a direct analytic continuation of the previous sequence . by applying this , we obtain the evolution of the function @ xmath182 . therefore , we obtain the function @ xmath140 from ref . ( [ e3 ] ) . in addition , we need also to consider the evolution of @ xmath197 for the essence universe data . we can apply the previously mentioned maximum likelihood method to the essence universe data which is one of the largest known data sets consisting of 192 sneia ( @ xmath198 ) . beside the 162 data sets described in chapter 2 of ref . @ xcite , which contains 32 ##s sneia , 32 snls sneia and 32to sneia , we send @ sneia followed by @ xmath199 . the chandra space is @ xcite . in ref . @ xcite . com figure [ differentvalues ] , we find the best fit of the model to the initial values of @ xmath139 and @ xmath138 . @ x * * @ & @ xmath139 & @ xmath138 & @ xmath0 & @ xmath32 + 0 . 05 & 0 . 06 & - 0 . 05 & 0 . 15 + 0 . 07 & 0 . 02 & - 0 . 08 & 0 . 12 + 0 . 03 & 0 . 04 & - 0 . 06 & 0 . 05 + 0 . 07 & 0 . 02 & - 0 . 04 & 0 . 05 + in ref .

[ 2 ] , we show the picture of the essence distance curve along with the other two curves in the case of essence models and @ xmath206 . we can see that the essence distance model ( @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 , @ xmath210 , @ xmath211 ) has a characteristic curve similar to the one from @ xmath206 ( @ xmath212 ) . therefore , the corresponding values of the are @ xmath0 and @ xmath32 in the case of @ xmath213 if we choose @ xmath214 and @ xmath215 . with the essence distance curve via the relationship between the distance @ xmath141 and the distance of @ xmath54 . the .this model ( @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 , @ xmath210 , @ xmath211 ) gives a close curve behavior to the one from @ xmath206 ( @ xmath212 ) . , title = " fig : " , width = 264 ] with the value ##s obtained via the relationship between the distance @ xmath141 and the distance of @ xmath54 . the second such model ( @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 , @ xmath210 , @ xmath211 ) gives a close curve behavior to the one from @ xmath206 ( @ xmath212 ) . , title = " fig : " , width = 272 ] and @ xmath32 in the original sneia dataset . [ we have found @ xmath216 , @ xmath214 and @ xmath215 . , width = 321 ] we have adopted the statefinder approach to the quantum theory , in which the potential for the entire universe is expressed in terms of a pseudo - cartan function : # ##al .##sion . we have shown that statefinder diagnostic has a direct dependence on the fixed point . the statefinder diagnostic divides the state of @ xmath0 into two parts , which is in accordance with the requirements of dynamic analysis . therefore , the statefinder diagnostic can be used to solve very complex types of problems like those for which the theory of equations of motion is not directly applicable . the statefinder diagnostic meets the requirements of the dynamic analysis of the problem , and the test can give useful results . the most important part of the test is that there is closed loop in the case of @ xmath217 . this loop corresponds to the heteroclinic loop of the great circle and de ##hn space . the circles with the pattern of circles indicate that they pass through the @ xmath69cdm fixed point on the time axis , that the statefinder ##s is connected along with the circle and they will pass through the @ xmath69cdm fixed point again in the case . it is worth noting that there is open loop in the case . @ xcite , and there is a closed loop which contains the @ xmath69cdm fixed point . thesewe show that this mode is an important model and the observed acceleration mode is an important model used for it . however , the quasi - periodic ##ity of interest in the cases of @ xmath76 and @ xmath18 means that the exact solutions of r . @ xcite are not periodic , but are quasi - periodic like the solutions for the einstein field equations . we used only the observed model , and added the acceleration mode to the sneia dataset . we show that the observed acceleration mode affects the slow expansion of the universe for the case of @ xmath0 . therefore , it is for @ xmath0 and @ xmath32 that there is a slowing expansion and an accelerating contraction . the statefinder ##s show that the universe only has an accelerating expansion at late time and a slowing expansion at early time for the cases of @ xmath218 and @ xmath18 . if we make the assumption of non - conservation of the internal energy , we have to reject this assumption ( @ xmath17 ) . with this assumption , the lack of conservation would make the expansion very slow . however , withthrough analysis of the expansion parameters and their values , it is possible to calculate the time - evolution of galaxies , as well as the amplitude . in order to get a better understanding of the observed expansion parameters , the matter density @ xmath219 , the mean temperature of @ xmath220 , and the amplitude @ xmath221 are calculated . this model bears a strong resemblance to the braneworld model in a very different way . sahni , shtanov and viznyuk @ xcite . the @ xmath222 model in the standard model and in the @ xmath69cdm universe can also be very complex . thus , at high energies , the standard model can behave like a matter - rich universe with the value of @ xmath222 different from the value of the observed matter density . at low energies , the standard model behave like @ xmath69cdm universe with the mean value of @ xmath223 . the difference between @ xmath222 and @ xmath223 is dependent on the energyestimate of statefinder is @ xmath224 . a more accurate estimate , however , is beyond the scope of the current work , and we should consider it in the future work . therefore , @ xmath225 and @ xmath226 should be derived from the results of observations in china , using the x - 1 method . this work is supported by national science foundation of india grants no . 10847153 and no . 10671128 . sahni v and starobinsky a 2000 _ int . _ d * 15 * 373 [ astro - ph / 9904398 ] + peebles ##on ##g , and ratra s 2003 _ int . phys . _ * 15 * 559 [ astro -
