micro - optical ( mo ) devices have many potential applications in data storage , communications , imaging , electronics , @ xcite as well as in magnonics . @ xcite the increasingly widespread use of nano in these areas creates new requirements for the mo effect , requiring , among other things , a higher form factor and smaller dimensions . for example , smaller dimensions are required for @ xmath2d imaging devices based on nano devices . @ xcite imaging devices use a micro wave modulator ( slm ) a device used to measure amplitude , phase , and duration of light waves in space and time . however , an slm device can produce high resolution @ xmath2d images if it uses pixel sizes @ xmath3 @ xmath1 ##m and it is large enough to produce a large number of pixels in a single image sensor . slm devices with mo effects have a very fast response time . therefore , their typical pixel sizes are @ xmath4 @ xmath1m . @ xcite at the nanoscale , mo effects can be achieved by using subwavelength nano devices @ xcite , nano - photonic devices , @ xcite and nano##antennas , @ xcite which are made of a magnetic metal and consist of multiple non - metal layers . however , since the typical antenna thickness is @ xmath5 nm and there should be hundreds of layers to achieve good optical performance , the size of the antenna is small . non - photonic antennas often have small dimensions and suffer from many defects . the size of optical / magnetic metal nanoantennas @ xcite can be much smaller than @ xmath6 @ xmath1 nm because of non - plasmonic materials which have an extra degree of freedom for optical properties at the nanoscale . @ xcite however , due to the absorption losses of magnetic metals , plasmonic optical properties of metal nanoantennas are not as good as those with nanoantennas made of gold or silver ( two metals with very high absorption losses ) . therefore , steps need to be taken to reduce these losses , which can be achieved by reducing the number of magnetic layers and using fano . ##s . @ xcite . also , in combination with subwavelength antennas , @ x##cite losses in nanoantennas can be reduced by using nano - metals instead of pure metals . metals , metal alloys , photonic materials and nanoantennas are used to model the mo effect and kerr effect in various ways . @ xcite for example , if the incident light is @ xmath7 - 1 and the applied external magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of reflection , the so - called transverse - kerr effect ( tmoke ) @ xcite is observed in the reflection mode . less well - known are transverse mo effects observed in the transmission mode . these effects are similar to the tmoke and occur in transparent magnetic plates as in @ xcite . an example of the transverse mo effect in the transmission mode is the transverse mo effect ( tfe ) . @ xcite this effect can be observed in electronics , energy storage , and magnonics . the tfe has been observed in transparent magnetic plates and fabry - perot tubes . @ xcite because the tfe effect is observed as a function of the light passing back and forth through the magnetic plates , it is observed in a fabry - perot tube . however ,a typical fabry - perot detector consists of a @ xmath8 @ xmath1m - substituted array of a single magnetic element placed between a number of layers , which in turn consists of @ xmath9 and layers of high - and low - - - index half - wave - like material . @ xcite however , the dimensions of the array are not very large , which makes it unsuitable for operation . in this way , we propose and demonstrate that the typical multifrequency tfe of the microspheres consists of a @ xmath10 - substituted copper - aluminium - silicon ( bi : yig ) . bi : yig is a micro - material with high magnetic properties and high sensitivity in the visible and infrared absorption bands . @ xcite by observing medium - power absorption measurements of the bi : yig microsphere we found a strong tfe response at all frequencies at the same time . the strength of the observed tfe is comparable with the strength of the tmoke in subwavelength magnetic materials . @ xcite also , the observed tfe response is stronger than that of medium - powersee glass theory . @ xcite however , the area of a magnetic sphere are much smaller when compared with the area covered by a subwavelength , or the area of a sphere as in particle physics ##s . the problem of light scattering by a magnetic sphere of constant size and constant permittivity is more complicated when using the mie theory . @ xcite whereas the mie theory can be used to describe the scattering by homogeneous magnetic spheres determined by their magnetic properties @ xcite , the problem of light scattering by a medium moving along a fixed magnetic axis is more complicated . this is because the magnetic permittivity is a function of the interaction between the medium and the static external electric field ( or the kinetic energy of the medium ) @ xcite @ xmath11 . using the : yig is an energy tensor , the off diagonal elements of @ xmath12 are zero , and in the case of a static external electric field along the _ x _ - axis , there is a non - zero off - diagonal element @ xmath13 , which is the _ y _ - and _ z _ - axes of the external electric field @ xmath14 according to the energy conservation of .: yig the bond between @ xmath15 and @ xmath13 of bi : yig can be shown to be small and even scale - wise over a wide range of scales : @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 . @ xcite because bi : yig is a ferrimagnetic material , the spin - orbit interaction is the fundamental mechanism of the mo interaction and this makes @ xmath13 similar to the spin @ xmath18 of the sphere . @ xcite by considering the off - axis nature of @ xmath12 in the mie sphere , one can take into account the physical mechanisms responsible for the mo kerr and kerr effects due to the magnetic properties of the sphere . @ xcite it has been shown that the mo kerr effect in a pure cobalt sphere is small but significant . @ xcite the strong mo interaction of cobalt spheres is due to the magnetic @ xcite and non - optical @ xcite absorption losses in this particular material . these optical absorption effects are characteristic of many metals , including gold and platinum . these effects have long been thought to be the cause of the nanostructures used in photonic devices such as , silicon .e . , nanoantennas . @ xcite additionally , a large and important area of research concerns non - metallic nanostructures , e . g . , high - temperature all - metal nanoantennas . @ xcite in this regard , the use of bi : yig as the model material of the microsphere opens up opportunities to understand the limitations of the molecular spheres . it is also worth considering brillouin light scattering ( bls ) from spin - wave modes in both the metallic and ferrimagnetic spheres . @ xcite the scattering of light due to spin - wave modes causes a time - dependent change of the surface permittivity of @ xmath19 of the surface of the sphere . the change of the induced light to @ xmath19 allows for a model of bls in systems in which a new spin - wave mode ( magnon ) is created and observed . in this way , bi : yig structures can be used as the model material of the microsphere because bls has been used to model the spin wave modes of bi : yig structures . @ xcite additionally , microspheres can also be usedof the rare earth group ( yig ) , which is a very well - known material used in magnonics . @ xcite additionally , similar magnetic and optical properties have been observed in some of the rare earth mononitrides , which can require electrons for the ability to change the distribution of charge carriers in spintronics . @ xcite the optical index of these materials is @ xmath20 and they are highly sensitive in the visible and infrared spectral bands . @ xcite most importantly , these materials also exhibit the # ##tility . @ xcite therefore , they can be liquids instead of crystals : yig . 1 . @ xmath6 ( a ) this illustrates the properties of an ideal , spherical sphere . by using the mie model for spherical spheres @ xcite we see that the intensity of the surface scattering light [ @ xmath21 , fig . @ xmath6 ( a ) ] has two components in the wavelength of @ xmath22 , where @ xmath23 is the radius of the sphere and @ xmath24 is the distance in the reciprocal direction [ fig . @ xmath6 ( a ) ] . the intensity ofthe incident light ( @ xmath25 ) in this spectral range is white . this means that on the surface the resulting microsphere has a very different mean - field scattering pattern [ fig . @ xmath6 ( a ) ] . for example , in order to achieve the same light - scattering power in the visible spectral range a bi : yig sphere with the structure @ xmath26 @ xmath1 m is required . it is expected that a nonmagnetised sphere with @ xmath27 @ xmath1 m will be in the so - called multi - crystal domain fig . @ xcite however , light will be absorbed by the same crystal structure . @ xcite however , the efficiency of this structure is very low and it can be reversed , i . e . we can assume that a nonmagnetised bi : yig sphere has the optical properties of a single large sphere with the same scattering pattern . the action of the external magnetic field applied along the _ x _ - axis [ fig . @ xmath6a ] will completely rotate the sphere without changing the direction of rotation of the sphere along the _ x _ - axis . thus , thethe physical and the ideal structure of the sphere can be calculated by solving the equation @ xmath12 [ vs . ( @ xmath6 ) ] . in this case , the original mie approach should not be used ; it can be replaced by , e . g . , the staircase approach . @ xcite consequently , other approaches such as , e . g . , the direct discrete time approximation ( dda ) @ xcite can be used . however , these approaches have limitations . the staircase approach requires the use of the electron scattering surface in polar ##ization . @ xcite the extension of the dda to large polar ##s would require unaffordable computational power . @ xcite therefore , we must use the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method . @ xcite although the fdtd method is very very expensive because it is the standard model of the structure of the sphere and thus requires a very large finite - area surface , the extension to large mie scattering surfaces is expected to yield good results . @ xcite the computational power of a simple quantum computer is sufficient for these applications . however , the fdtd can be extended to scatterers with a more complex structure than the si. of course , in this case for scatterers of a given size one first has to solve the micromagnetics equation to determine the magnitude of the light in the scatterer . the dashed line in fig . @ xmath28 is the forward - scattering light and @ xmath29 is the magnitude of the tfe in the microsphere as a function of the light differential @ xmath30 . in this case , @ xmath31 is the magnitude of the backward - scattering light ( as for example in fig . @ xmath28 in the dashed line ) and @ xmath32 is the pulse frequency for si : yig . the change in the magnitude of @ xmath32 is the change in the direction of the electric or magnetic field of @ xmath33 and this corresponds to the change in the sign of @ xmath13 . @ xcite note that the light differential @ xmath34 , and @ xmath35 the difference , is used to determine the strength of the tmoke in si and in other systems operating in the optical mode . @ xcite note , in reference to non - electro - optical ##s##s . for a single wavelength , @ xcite = 3d . @ xmath28 the observed values of @ xmath36 are different at the different wavelengths due to the optical properties exhibited by the microsphere . we assume that the observed values of @ xmath36 are of the same order of magnitude as the values of @ xmath37 for the image . @ xcite . the area of a typical microsphere is much larger than the area covered by the plate . consider the value of the tfe in the image as a function of the angle of incidence @ xmath38 for the plate in the image , @ xmath39 etc . we measured the surface @ xmath40 of the nonmagnetised plate . due to the three - dimensional nature of the experiment , these results were obtained using the following formula for _ _ _ - [ vs . @ xcite , p = 321 ] to further demonstrate the advantage of the microsphere over the other optical techniques and to measure the following ##s , we measured the tfe of an @ xmath8 @ xmath1m - coated plate made of glass : yig [ vs . @ xmath2 (( ) ] . reference plates have many applications in fabry - perot temperature - based optical systems . @ xcite the reference plate is a two - dimensional scatterer with the same orientation along the _ p _ - axis such that @ xmath41 . however , for the _ x _ - and _ z _ - induced incident light , there is a _ z _ - dependence of the electric field and magnetic fields , and for the a _ z _ - induced light the surface of the plate exhibits an odd - number @ xmath42 ^ { 1 / 2 } $ ] ( the plate does not exhibit the ##s for the _ z _ - induced light ) . @ xcite due to the change of @ xmath43 to @ xmath13 the magnitude of the incident _ z _ - component is proportional to the temperature . however , the tfe is always negative , so changing the direction of the applied external magnetic field from @ xmath44 to @ xmath45 ( i . e . , @ xmath46 ) does not change the magnitude of the differential @ xmath47 . instead , the tfe is given by the differential @ xmath48 . @xcite however , the tfe can take place only in scatterers where a nonhomogeneous ##ly scattered electron beam is produced by the beam directly incident on the surface , i . e . the tfe occurs at both the incident and reflected angles . @ xcite therefore , in fig . @ xmath2 ( b ) we observe @ xmath49 as a function of the angle of incidence @ xmath38 for the orientation of the free space @ xmath39 nm . we observe that at this angle a collision with @ xmath50 @ xmath1 nm would cause the vanishing of the tfe . ( fig . @ xmath28 ) . thus @ xmath2 ( b ) means that in the absence of the external external magnetic field the brewster curve @ xmath40 for the _ - _ - _ beam has multiple vanishing due to grazing effects . the shape of the beam @ xmath49 describes the shape of @ xmath40 . at the brewster curve @ xmath51 one observes @ xmath52 because changing the curve results in multiple vanishing effects . it is known that for the transverse orientation of the beam , which is @ xmat##h8 times larger than the diameter of the thin sphere @ xmath50 @ xmath1 ##m , the strength of the tfe is 10 times greater than in the sphere . however , in the @ xmath6 @ xmath1m - thin sphere ( not shown ) the strength of the tfe increases significantly because the interference effect is much stronger . of course , the fabrication techniques for thin spheres and spheres are much less well - developed and more energy intensive than those for single magnetic microspheres . however , the recent advances in producing ultra - thin magnetic nano particles make it possible to create laser scatterers with a cylindrical - to - cylindrical shape . @ xcite yig plates with the same particle sizes of @ xmath53 @ xmath1 ##m can be produced by the laser printing process . @ xcite also , a single magnetic microsphere can be produced by the printing process @ xcite . however , laser - based fabrication techniques can also be used . @ xcite we found an interesting method for using the laser interference effect for producing non - magnetic microspheres . we observed the structure of a sphere made of a light blue material with a very small, and the micro - mo ##s in the visible and infrared wavelength ranges . we obtained the electron scattering energy of the sphere of @ xmath54 , which is similar and comparable with the values obtained with the micro ##sphere , which , however , have a much smaller area as compared with microspheres . our devices will have applications in nanophotonics , optics , and magnonics . this project was funded by the australian research council . we also received a senior research grant from the university of western australia . the council invited dr . / dr . a . metaxas for further research .
