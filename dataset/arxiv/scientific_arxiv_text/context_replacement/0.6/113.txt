the fundamental problem of general relativity is contained in einstein s equation , which is a well - known initial value problem ( see , e . g . , @ xcite ) . in theory , therefore , to understand the motion of bodies in general relativity such as binary neutron stars and black holes one first needs to obtain the spatial coordinates ( using the einstein method ) from the spacelike data and then integrate this data via einstein s equation . however , in practice , it is almost impossible to find simple solutions of the equations for the motion of bodies using these methods . although it theoretically is possible to find solutions even in some cases of interest , it is difficult and expensive to do so , and one must understand the details and / or be limited by the very complex nature of the problem . nevertheless , it is of great interest to find methods that give simple descriptions of motion in the cases of interest . in general , the motion of a particle of finite mass will depend on the properties of its surroundings as well as the details of its own equations of motion . thus , one would expect to find a simple description of motion even in the cases of ` ` small mass particles ' ' . however , einstein s equation is nonlinear , and a detailed analysis @ xcite shows thatit does not make any mathematical sense to consider solutions of standard field equations with the standard stress - energy tensor supported on a worldline . however , if one were to accelerate a particle up to zero mass at zero velocity , collapse to a black hole would occur before the point particle limit could be reached . a stress - energy tensor supported on a world - line _ u _ makes no sense for the solution of the standard field equations . however , one can give a description of the self - organization by considering a metric tensor , @ xmath3 , and a vector field , @ xmath4 , given by the stress - energy tensor of a ` ` point particle ' ' of mass m , resulting in equation @ xmath5 . @ xmath6 ( t , x ^ i ) = [ \ delta _ u _ a ( t ) u _ b ( t ) \ frac { \ , ^ { ( t ) } ( x ^ i - x ^ { ( t ) ) } { \ sqrt { - 1 } } \ frac { dt \ , } { dt } \ , \ , . \ ] ] where @ xmath7 is the velocity vector ( i . e . , zero - velocity) of the worldline @ xmath8 given by @ xmath9 , and @ xmath10 denotes the proper time along @ xmath8 . ( here @ xmath11 denotes the ` ` h - system ' ' , i . e . , @ xmath12 . the other equation above could be written covariantly as @ xmath13 where @ xmath14 denotes the corresponding n - dimensional wave - function and @ xmath10 denotes the proper time along @ xmath8 . ) however , this approach has two important problems . first , the classical bianchi equation implies that the source - mass - energy must be zero . second , as we shall see , in the [ non : zero ] case , this requires that the worldline @ xmath8 of the source is a region of the source spacetime . however , there are no ways to solve for non - zero gravitational fields , making it difficult to use this approach to find solutions to the equation . this problem has been solved in @ xcite and other approaches by doing as follows . remove the first boundary condition , so that it takes the form@ xmath15 where @ xmath16 with @ xmath17 . this by itself gives solutions for the equation . @ xmath8 ; it is only when the local gauge condition is satisfied that the solutions are identical to the original einstein equation and wave motion is avoided . however , if one assumes the non - gauge violation of the ( the equation _ _ _ has _ the _ gauge condition ) it is incorrect in the sense that it is not immediately pointed out that one has solved the original einstein equation , and no attempt is made to explain this change . ] that is impossible to solve , which allows for the solution of - wave motion . of course , this ` ` gauge violation ' ' of the modified einstein equation is an approximation inequivalent to the solution . however , because corrections from wave motion are known to be reasonable , the local gauge condition should also be satisfied , and it also has been shown @ xcite that solutions to the two equations should converge to reasonable solutions . the main problem is that the solutions to etc . ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) are embedded in the worldine of the universe . therefore , one has to solve .to the difficulties related to @ xmath3such , note that the particle moving at the time of @ xmath18are be expected to cause serious mathematical problems , similar to the difficulties encountered in solution of the classical two - body problem . despite these difficulties , there is a general consensus that under the assumption that energy and spin multipole moments can be neglected , the motion of a very small particle ( with only ` ` electromagnetic field ' ' ) should be described by : the linear equations . ( [ q : 1 ] ) via the standard solution of with @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 with @ xmath21 the corresponding green s function for is . ( [ q : wave ] ) , and with the value of @ xmath22 , is @ xcite . the notation @ xmath23 indicates that the range of the solution is well outside of the standard solution @ xmath24 , and that only the ` ` cone ' ' ( i . e . , part of the ' cone ) part of the green s function is used ( see , e . g . , see @ xcite for details ) . for ( [ q : 1 ]) and ( [ 1 : misataquwa - 1 ] ) are known as the misataquwa equations , and have been solved by a number of approaches . however , there are problems with all of these approaches . one approach @ xcite that has been proposed is to take the results of @ xcite in the classical sense and use equations of effective self self - energy to describe the motion . however , this use of various forms of first - order quantum field theory results in results that cannot be ` ` correct ' ' . although these two methods are very good - looking , the theoretical validity of such a method is questionable . another approach @ xcite is to consider the form that equations of effective self - energy should have . this is a very simple derivation of the self - force field equation of motion . however , as the authors of @ xcite note , the motion of matter in general relativity is completely described by the field theory together with the differential equations of the field itself , so several reasonable assumptions should be made to solve the equation of motion , including the ` ` rigid body ' ' approximation and other reasonable assumptions . the derivation given in @ xcite shows that it suffers from several reasonable assumptions . first ,their derivation is now essentially the standard test for gravity . these results lead to a second approach by poisson @ xcite that uses the metric transfer function , developed by detweiler and green @ xcite . a third approach , developed by mino , sasaki , and tanaka @ xcite and by poisson @ xcite based on the work of tanaka @ xcite , green @ xcite , kates @ xcite , thorne and hartle @ xcite , and others involves the use of the astymptotic ##s . suppose one considers a gravitational field in the ` ` near zone ' ' where the metric is assumed to be that of the body , with a small correction due to the background spacetime and in the ` ` far zone ' ' where the metric is assumed to be that of the background spacetime , with a small correction due to the background . one then assumes that there is an interior region of the body where the local ##s exist , and applies the equations . the equations of motion of the body then follow from the initial results . however , as we shall note above , in addition to the ` ` ' local ##ization ' ' , there are a number of steps and results in these equations that have not been fully solved. a more general way to derive gravitational self - force was introduced in the work of geroch and jang @ xcite and of geroch and ehlers @ xcite for the motion of rigid bodies ( see also @ xcite ) . in @ xcite , one considers a curved spacetime centered at @ xmath4 and considers a small one - parameter family of high - energy light curves @ xmath25 that satisfy the normal ##ization equation and have values in the world tube . as the velocity goes to zero , the world tube changes to a timelike curve . it is then shown that this timelike curve cannot be a point . this property is used in @ xcite to allow @ xmath4 to not conflict with @ xmath2 provided that the above condition is satisfied . within the limits of @ xcite , it also should be possible to find perturbative solutions to all forces , including gravitational self - force . however , the constraints imposed by @ xcite in general allow the velocity of the body to go to zero faster than @ xmath26 . thus , under this assumption , a self - force - correction to the velocity of the body would occur at higher speeds thanand gravity ; and any other properties that would depend on the mass of the body . however , while the theory of @ xcite provides a complete description of the motion of a ` ` massive body ' ' to first order , it is not a straightforward way to explain gravitatational g - forces due to this motion . in this case , we shall use an approach similar in principle to that of @ xcite , but we shall use a # ##iable , three - dimensional family of theories @ xmath0 , wherein , in particular , we have a body ( or black hole ) , that shrink to infinity , in a self - consistent manner , with both the size and the mass of the body being identical to @ xmath2 . in the case of @ xmath27 , the body ( or black hole ) shrink down to the worldline , @ xmath8 . as in @ xcite and @ xcite , we conclude that @ xmath8 must be a part of the ` ` real spacetime ' ' @ xmath28although our method of proving this differs significantly from @ xcite and @ xcite . to lowest order in @ xmath2 , the bodyto the right is described by a vector field , @ xmath29 , or @ xmath8 , which is the ` ` universal solution ' ' to the gravitational worldline . we then find that , for each , one field , @ xmath0 , is the point group @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 . @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 represent , respectively , the mass and radius of the universe . the terms in parentheses on the left side of this table correspond exactly to the first self - mass term in . . ; the first term is the papapetrou self - mass @ xcite ; the second term is just the upper right hand side of the gravitational field equation . this is ` ` universal ' ' in the sense that it holds for any one - parameter system satisfying our conditions , and it holds as well for a ( sufficiently small ) family of dark matter and a ( sufficiently large ) black hole . our derivation of is closely related to the above taylor expansion of . therefore , our derivation is a straightforward , perturbative one . in particular , we have a number of ad hoc , complicated , and / or .##necssary , as in previous approaches , makes assumptions about the motion of the ` ` body metric ' ' and its components , assumptions about rates of change of these components with time , the existence of certain gauge transformations , the existence of boundary conditions on the metric , and , most importantly , the existence of the gauge transformation . however , in our approach , the motion of the ` ` body metric ' ' is a matter that is _ physical _ rather than theoretical . it therefore must be clear in our approach that the equations are for elementary particles ( including black holes ) and that the exact solutions do not depend on the choice of gauge ( although @ xmath30 itself is a gauge invariant solution , i . e . , the values of the solutions to the equations depend on how the spacetimes on which @ xmath2 is defined in section [ 1 : 1 ] and appendix a ) . in addition , because the local gauge plays the main role in our approach ( apart from being a very important one ) , our gauge invariant problem is not , as in previous approaches @ xcite , related to problems not related to the local gauge . our approach also goes to the extent of being generalized so as to betake second order derivatives into account . however , we shall not attempt to use such an approach in this paper . although certainly true as a second - order perturbative approximation to sectional curvature , this equation would not be expected to provide a good global - in - time approximation to motion , since the small scale solution to the equation given above would vary with time , and etc . would not be expected to provide a good approximation of the local motion when @ xmath29 is zero . we shall note in this paper that the misataquwa equations , viz . and , should provide a much better global - in - time approximation to motion than etc . , and they also should be useful for self - consistent calculations of the motion of a single particle , such as for calculations of zero - mass - loss inspiral . we note in particular that , in contrast to maxwell s equations , maxwell s equations are nonlinear , and it makes very good mathematical sense to use the solutions to maxwell s equations with light - scattering . however , if the electric - field equations are not solved in general but instead are solved by solving the maxwell equations of motion which are assumed to be such that the total g - tensor of the mass and energythat is . then the general , explicit form of @ # ##nr together with the equations of motion of the field is equivalent to the the gravitational case . point particle theories do not make much sense in this case either . it is for this reason that in more than a century of research on this subject there is no known exact description of the electromagnetic self - force of a point particle . the results of this paper can be used to easily obtain a perturbative formula for electromagnetic self - force by considering the one - parameter family of complex star - like systems , and we shall carry out this work using @ xcite . however , we shall limit all of this paper to the gravitational limit . this paper is presented as follows . in figure [ 1 : 1 ] , we show the limit of one - parameter family of systems , @ xmath34 , that we shall take by considering the one - parameter family of schwarzschild - desitter spacetimes with black hole , corresponding to @ xmath2 . another way of taking the limit of @ xmath35 is desitter spacetime . we refer to this way of taking the limit as the ` ` gravitational limit ' ' . then we see that if we take theinstead of @ xmath35 in this way and we define the limit as @ xmath36 , we obtain schwarzschild spacetime . we refer to this simple way of finding the limit of @ xmath35 as the ` ` scaled limit ' ' . the scaled limit can be found at any time @ xmath37 on the worldline @ xmath8 . the combined application of these classes of methods gives the class of sub - class of methods we use , wherein a point ( or a hole ) is scaled relative to the world - line @ xmath8 in an absolutely self - consistent way . the first , general conditions we impose on @ xmath0 are stated in section [ sec : example ] . the general conditions of @ xmath0 that follow directly from our results are stated in section [ sec : example ] . in particular , we define ` ` ` far zone ' ' and ` ` near zone ' ' , and we show that , any time @ xmath37 , the scaled limit of yields a flat , perfectly flat spacetime at @ xmath38 . in section [ sec : example ] , we show that @ x##math8 will be a part of the ` ` flat spacetime ' ' ( i . e . , the spacetime of @ xmath38 , from in the scaled form ) . in other words , to first order in @ xmath2 a massive body or black hole suddenly appears in the plane . we also note that , to first order in @ xmath2 , the mass moment associated with such a body or black hole corresponds to that of the structureless ` ` reference frame ' ' . in section [ sec : beyond ] , we derive the translation of the body ( or black hole ) to first order in @ xmath2 by introducing a local transformation that gives the mass - moment of the resulting , ' flat spacetime ' in the standard form : . ( this can be interpreted as a translation to the ` ` center of mass ' ' of the body . ) in section [ sec : beyond ] , we also derive : . to the first order in @ xmath2 corresponds to @ xmath8 , the standard form . ( an extension of the translation to other dimensions . ) finally , in section [ sec : beyond ] we derive the followingof the misataquwa group . our spacetime coordinates are those of wald @ xcite , and we write , , where @ xmath39 . # ##case latin indices from outside the alphabet ( @ xmath40 ) will denote the spacetime coordinates ; latin indices will denote coordinate components of these indices ; latin indices from inside - alphabet ( @ xmath41 ) will denote the coordinate components . as stated in the paper , we seek a one - parameter family of limits @ xmath42 that describes a massive object or black hole that ` ` shrink down to microscopic size ' ' in an asymptotically self - consistent manner . in order to understand the boundary conditions of @ xmath42 that we shall use , we present here an extremely simple example of the family of one - parameter limits that we seek . this example will be an example of the two types of limits that we shall use to construct @ xmath42 . our example is , from schwarzschild - desitter spacetime , @ xmath43 ( this limit , of course , is a solution to the maxwell ' s equations with a positive curvature @ xmath44 rather than a solution with @ x##math45 , ( the string theory can also play a role in the solution of this problem ; we want to use this theory because of its simplicity and simplicity . ) the simplest one - parameter family is @ xmath46 where we know about the limit of the spacetime with @ xmath47 for each @ xmath48 . for each @ xmath2 , this spacetime is the local gravitational field of a massive body / black hole of the @ xmath49 in the infinite desitter spacetime . for @ xmath35 , the body / black hole grows to infinity , and disappears . for @ xmath38 , the spacetime is desitter spacetime , which transforms back to the worldline @ xmath50 , back to where the body / black hole was located before it ` ` disappeared ' ' . as stated earlier in @ xcite , the definition of the one - parameter family of the @ xmath42 depends on how the spacetime ##s of different points of @ xmath2 are identified . this family of spacetime ##s for each @ xmath2 can be found by solving the @ xmath51 for each @ xmath##2 and 3 points differ by the same value of the coordinates @ xmath51 . if we consider the time @ xmath52 in which the one - parameter family of coordinates is used to make the limit , then it is shown that the limit of @ xmath35 of @ xmath42 is the desitter of @ xmath53 this leads to the result that the universe / black hole shrink to the radius and length and ` ` shrink ' ' to @ xmath35 . however , there is another way of taking the limit of @ xmath42 as @ xmath35 ; the use of this other way is one of the key points in this proof . take an initial time @ xmath37 and , for @ xmath54 , take the angular and metric coordinates for @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 . using the new coordinates , the one - parameter family of coordinates is @ xmath57 we can take the limit of @ xmath35 by considering the spacetimes with coordinates @ xmath2 and the same value of the new coordinates . it is shown by means of r . ( [ gbar ] ) that the the limit of @ x##math42 = @ xmath35 at all @ xmath58 points , but is not . in fact , the spacetime distance between the two events described by @ xmath59 and @ xmath60 goes to zero at @ xmath35 because these events are close to the same point at @ xmath8 . therefore , this limit of @ xmath42 exists but is not very precise . however , an exact limit can be obtained by defining a simple one - parameter family of metric @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 such that @ xmath63 by definition , the limit of this family of metric is simply , @ xmath64 which is simply the schwarzschild metric with constant @ xmath65 . the definition of this first limit can be obtained as follows . as is stated above , the one - parameter family of metric ( [ see : below ] ) is the total gravitational field of a massive object or black hole that grows to constant size and arrives at @ xmath35 . the second limit corresponds to how this family of spacetimes corresponds to the number of observers arriving at the points labeled by the values of @ xmat##h58 . when moving from , say , the @ xmath66 to the @ xmath67 spacetime , each observer will notice that the object / black hole has increased in size and shape by a factor of @ xmath68 and each observer therefore will find himself ` ` attached to the object ' ' by this same factor of @ xmath68 . notice also that this family of observers also ` ` measure distances ' ' by this same factor of @ xmath68 , i . e . , they use centimeters rather than meters to measure distances . then , accounting for the effects due to the desitter background , the family of observers for the @ xmath67 spacetime will measure the same distances ( measured in meters ) as the observers for the @ xmath66 spacetime have reported ( in centimeters ) . in the limit of @ xmath35 , these observers will report a schwarzschild black hole of size @ xmath65 , since the effects of the desitter background on what these observers will see are completely in this limit . we will return to the same kind of limit ( i . e . , the limit as @ xmath35 of @ xmat##h42 taken at fixed @ xmath51 ) as the _ scaled limit _ of @ xmath42 , and we can refer to the second limit ( i . e . , the same as @ xmath35 of @ xmath69 taken at fixed @ xmath58 ) as the _ scaled limit _ of @ xmath42 . the very existence of both types of the two limits gives a great deal of important information about the three - dimensional structure of spacetimes ( [ 3 : 2 ] ) . in particular , the existence of the first type of limit is telling us that the body / black hole is shrinking down to the worldline @ xmath8 , with its mass shrinking to twice ( at most ) as much as its radius . the existence of the second type of limit is telling us that the body / black hole is shrinking to its radius in an absolutely non - linear way : in particular , its mass is shrinking to its radius , its radius is not constant , and it is not experiencing any ( first order ) changes in time . in [ 1 : 2limits - spacetime ] of the two limits we have . , the body grows and then decreases , andconsider a normal background spacetime with the first sub - system , @ xmath8 , pointing out . the solid lines show this ` ` general limit ' ' of @ xmath35 at fixed @ xmath70 , which is taken along paths that converge away from @ xmath8 ( i . e . , @ xmath71 ) . in contrast , the ` ` special limit ' ' of @ xmath35 , shown in solid lines , is taken along paths at fixed @ xmath72 that converge to a point at @ xmath8 . , n = 288 ] we wish therefore to derive from the above equation the following method to decide upon one - parameter families that satisfy in a simple and consistent way the fact that we have an enormous object ( or black hole ) that is growing to large sizes in an absolutely self - consistent manner in the ordinary background spacetime . much of the remainder of this article will be devoted to the ` ` equations of motion ' ' for these objects that are large enough to satisfy these self - consistent equations . a simple attempt at determining the class of one - parameter families @ xmath42 that we have is as follows : * \ ( 1 ) _ {of the ` ` scaled limit ' ' _ : @ xmath42 , such that there are coordinates @ xmath73 such that @ xmath74 is jointly smooth in @ xmath75 , at least for @ xmath76 for all coordinates @ xmath77 , where @ xmath78 ( @ xmath79 ) . for each @ xmath2 and for @ xmath76 , @ xmath42 is the exact solution of the equation ##nr . 1 , @ xmath80 is smooth in @ xmath73 , smooth in @ xmath81 , and , for @ xmath82 , the metric @ xmath8 ##1 , @ xmath81 is timelike . * \ ( 0 ) _ : of the ` ` scaled limit ' ' _ : for each @ xmath37 , we have @ xmath55 , @ xmath83 . and the metric @ xmath84 is jointly smooth in @ xmath85 for @ xmath86 . so we have used the symbol @ xmath87 to denote the value of @ xmath4 and the @ .##math88 ##8 , whereas @ xmath89 represents the components of @ xmath90 in the @ xmath88 family . it should be noted that , since the scaled limits differ only in distance ( and position of the points ) from the two reference points , we have @ xmath91 therefore , we have @ xmath92 since there is no cancelation of the components of @ xmath2 arising from the components of @ xmath90 and the corresponding rescalings . it also should be noted that there is some error in our definition of the one - parameter family of metric when considering the scaled limit : we have a scaled limit for all components of @ xmath37 , but these arise from a different one - parameter family of values @ xmath42 . therefore , it is fairly easy to see that we have @ xmath93 in general , our assumptions for @ xmath4 of the existence of both a ` ` scaled limit ' ' and a ` ` scaled limit ' ' are not yet strong enough to fully define the one - parameter family we have . to overcome this and obtain the above boundary conditions , it is necessary to define the metriclet @ xmath94 where the component of @ xmath95 is @ xmath96 . let @ xmath97 be a component of @ xmath42 in the case @ xmath73 . then , instead of viewing @ xmath97 as a component of @ xmath98 , we view @ xmath97 as a component of @ xmath99 , where @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 are defined in terms of @ xmath102 using the same formula for the two variables . in terms of these two variables , taking the ` ` scaled limit ' ' corresponds to letting @ xmath103 at any fixed @ xmath104 , whereas taking the ` ` scaled limit ' ' corresponds to letting @ xmath105 at any fixed @ xmath106 ( see equation [ 1 : 2limits - 1 ] ) . however , our assumptions about the scaled limit are that , at fixed @ xmath107 and at fixed @ xmath108 , @ xmath97 varies along with @ xmath95 , not with @ xmath109 . thus theother than , our assumptions in the ordinary limit imply that for fixed @ xmath107 and at fixed @ xmath106 , @ xmath97 is smooth in @ xmath110 . similarly , the same assumption in the special limit implies that for @ xmath109 and at @ xmath107 , @ xmath97 is smooth in @ xmath110 , and in @ xmath111 . similarly , for fixed @ xmath107 , our previously stated assumptions imply that @ xmath97 is also smooth along the ` ` ' ' ' @ xmath112 , and is smooth in @ xmath110 along the @ xmath110 - axis ( i . e . , @ xmath109 ) . however , our previously stated assumptions do not imply anything about the existence or existence of @ xmath97 and @ xmath113 from points other than along the @ xmath110 - axis . these same assumptions would lead to finding @ xmath114 and @ xmath35 ##3 at _ point _ less _ than @ xmath2 , i . e . , assuming that@ xmath115 . to understand the importance and importance of this last property , let us return to our ordinary differential equation , viz . ( [ x : x ] ) and define @ xmath97 to be the space - time component of this corresponding to ` ` time - space ' ' and @ xmath102 that are [ defined at the point @ xmath116 when @ xmath38 ] . in terms of our independent variable ( [ alphabeta ] ) , we have @ xmath118 which is jointly smooth in @ xmath119 at @ xmath120 . in particular , suppose we have a one - parameter family of coordinates @ xmath121 that satisfy our initial assumptions about the scaled and ordinary metric , but fails to be jointly smooth in @ xmath119 at @ xmath120 . for example , if the space - time component of such a one - parameter is smooth in @ xmath122 in terms of the scaled metric @ xmath123 , this leads to solutions of the form @ xmath124 if we take the ` ` upper limit ' ' ( @ xmath35( at @ xmath71 ) of @ xmath125 , we find that @ xmath125 smoothly goes to @ xmath126 . now , if we take the ` ` scaled limit ' ' ( @ xmath127 at fixed @ xmath128 ) , we will find that @ xmath125 smoothly goes to @ xmath126 . now , if we take @ xmath35 and let @ xmath70 go to 0 at @ xmath129 . then @ xmath125 will have a scaled limit , at @ xmath130 . in fact , @ xmath131 belongs to a one - parameter family in which there is a ` ` bump of curvature ' ' at @ xmath132 . although this ` ` bump of curvature ' ' does not exist when one takes the scaled or scaled limit , it is present in the one - parameter family of spacetimes and has a limiting behavior for @ xmath35 of this one - parameter family . in order to find this type of non - limiting behavior between @ xmath2 and @ xmath70 , we must satisfy the following addtional condition :* \ ( 1 ) _ _ _ _ : each element of @ xmath42 in the sequence @ xmath51 is a jointly smooth function of the form @ xmath133 and @ xmath120 ( at fixed @ xmath134 ) , where @ xmath110 and @ xmath95 are defined as and . ( [ alphabeta ] ) . here ( i ) - ( ii ) are all of the constraints that we shall place on @ xmath42 . no further assumptions will be made in this section . we assume that the coordinate family defined by our constraints includes all the coordinate families @ xmath135 , that @ xmath136 is jointly smooth in @ xmath137 for all @ xmath138 for all in @ xmath139 , and such that the jacobian of @ xmath140 is jointly smooth in @ xmath119 and @ xmath120 at fixed @ xmath134 . it should be noted that our assumtions impose absolutely no constraints on the one - dimensional space of spacetimes for @ xmath141 , i . e . , this one of thesespacetimes could very well be ` ` closed in ' ' with fixed points and a black hole under our conditions . ] . it also should be noted that the ` ` ' @ xmath70 ' ' expansion of the spacetime would not be subject to any of our conditions , and it is therefore possible that our assumptions hold for @ xmath142 for some of @ xmath143 . finally , although it does not seem obvious upon further examination , we see that our assumptions concerning @ xmath0 are closely related to the assumptions made concerning x - zone ##s . as we shall see in the next section , in particular , our assumption about the existence of an inner limit of @ xmath0 corresponds to assuming the existence of a ` ` close zone ' ' expansion ; our assumption about the existence of a normal limit of @ xmath0 corresponds to assuming the existence of a ` ` neutral zone ' ' expansion ; and our second assumption corresponds only to the assumption of the existence of a ` ` neutral zone ' ' where both sides are equal . in this section , we note some important consequences of the results of the previous section that will play a major role in our analysis . these consequences will come directly from the` ` uniform ##ity ' ' and the linear combination ( [ 1 ] ) . since , under the above condition , the correlation functions of the one - parameter family of values @ xmath42 are already defined with the values @ xmath119 and @ xmath120 , we can replace @ xmath144 with a linear series expansion from @ xmath110 and @ xmath95 to the two values @ xmath145 and @ xmath32 to @ xmath146 . for @ xmath110 and @ xmath95 from q . ( [ alphabeta ] ) , we get @ xmath147 where , and in the limit , we get the last term . we will write this expression as linear series expansion of @ xmath2 : @ xmath148 we will refer to q . ( [ 1 : rseries ] ) as the _ far zone expansion _ of @ xmath42 . it should be noted that the @ xmath149th - the solution of @ xmath2 to the far zone expansion - has similarity to solution of @ xmath150for example @ xmath70 . however , very large integer values of @ xmath70 can substitute for higher values of @ xmath2 . finally , we see that the angular dependence of @ xmath151 is further complicated by the fact that the two functions @ xmath152 will be equal to @ xmath50 when re - expressed as functions of @ xmath102 . in particular , this means that @ xmath153 does not have any angular dependence . equivalently , in terms of fig . ( [ barg ] ) , we can write @ xmath89 where @ xmath154 . by expanding @ xmath155 , @ xmath156 and @ xmath157 , we get @ xmath158 where @ xmath159 we can write this as a power series : where @ xmath2 : @ xmath160 we can refer to fig . ( [ 1 : fullnearzone ] ) as the _ _ _ _ _ of @ xmath42 . we see from this example that the absolute value , expressed as a function , of @ x##math2 , note the fact that the negative powers of @ xmath156 and @ xmath72 are required to be twice as high as the powers of the ##s . by definition , powers of @ xmath72 of very high order are always present . of course , only non - negative powers of @ xmath156 can occur . by means of math . ( [ 1 : fullnearzone ] ) , we see that the ` ` ' ' ' ( @ xmath82 ) - value is given by @ xmath161 where we have ignored the fact that @ xmath162 . thus , we see that there is no power of @ xmath163 on @ xmath156 and only non - negative powers of @ xmath72 occur . _ thus , we see that @ xmath164 is a stable , stationary flat spacetime . _ however , the stable , stationary , asymtotically flat spacetime that we see will depend on the choice of the origin , @ xmath37 , and the worldline , @ xmath8 , on which the calculation is done . our` ` far zone expansion ' ' , viz . ( [ x : rseries ] ) , appears to correspond exactly to the far zone expansion used in the previous analysis of @ xcite . however , our ` ` far zone expansion ' ' differs in that we use a different term for the flow @ xmath37 rather than using a # # ##flow equation with a single term . both analyses require an additional ` ` quasi - time ' ' or ' - time ' term for the behavior of the local flow . a further difference is that the fact that the background ( @ xmath38 ) metric is continuous and is constant has been assumed , rather than ignored . however , in other analyses , a different form of the background metric ( such as the schwarzschild metric ) is assumed , and the possibility that this particular form may vary with time ( i . e . , depending upon @ xmath37 ) is also considered . in contrast , in other analyses , conditions very different @ xmath72 ( such as those of the schwarzschild metric ) are assumed . in our analysis , we make no assumptions other than the form ( i ) - ( ii ) . in thesimple proof . in particular , since we make no assumptions about the shape of the background for @ xmath165 , we do not impose any boundary conditions for the @ xmath72 . however , it is also possible to express the consistency relation ( [ 1 ] ) in a simple , explicit way . we express @ xmath166 as , this simple proof shows that @ xmath167 as well as @ xmath168 and @ xmath169 , we show that the consistency relation implies that @ xmath170 is dense , as we have already shown . in this way , we will show that the worldline @ xmath8 shown in figure ( 1 ) of the [ 1 : 1 ] must , in fact , be the boundary of the background of @ xmath171 . this can be interpreted as showing that , to first order in @ xmath2 , a point ( or a point ) exists on a boundary of the background spacetime . in fact , we will prove much more than this : we will show that , to first order in @ xmath2 , the # ##thest point of @ xmath42 is that of the ` ` .' ' ' . as is noted in the section , our derivation of spherical motion is similar in nature to that of @ xcite except that we consider one - parameter families of particles with a worldtube that go up to a point @ xmath8 , but the properties of the one - parameter families that we describe here are very different from those described in @ xcite , and our derivation of spherical motion is very different as well . our derivation of spherical motion also appears to differ significantly from # ##ness of neutral series in @ xcite . we start by considering the first order terms of the neutral series expansion , viz . ( [ r : rseries ] ) , as follows : @ xmath172 + [ ( \ , ^ 2 ) \ , , ] > [ \ , \ , , \ , { r } \ ] ] where we have ignored the fact that @ xmath173 will depend only on @ xmath174 , as discussed in the previous section . since the worldline @ xmath8 , represented by @ xmath116 , is assumed to be timelike , , if , then , we have assumed that the ` ` |` ' ' @ xmath175 , is ` ` ' in ' ' with energy satisfying the minimum energy condition , [ it should be easy to see that @ xmath8 cannot be timelike . ] in the spacetime @ xmath176 , without conservation of time , we can change our coordinates @ xmath73 so that @ xmath177 . ( the other possible choice of coordinates would be the spatial coordinates with respect to @ xmath8 and the time @ xmath176 . we note that we make the first choice @ xmath178 only for convenience and that , e . g . , temporal time agrees with spatial time . @ xmath8but also plays an important role in our calculations . ) using these coordinates , and letting @ xmath179 be the @ xmath180 part of the puzzle , we find that @ xmath181 has the form @ xmath182 where @ xmath183 where in fact . ( [ see : 1 - 1 ] ) , the term ` ` @ xmath184 ' ' is the result that , when multiplied by @ xmath18##5 for any @ xmath186 , as in @ xmath187 . also , in example ( 1 ) of equation [ 2 : 1 ] , for any @ xmath2 , @ xmath0 is a vacuum solution of einstein s equation for @ xmath188 and is always zero with @ xmath98 in this energy state . it follows that for any @ xmath189 , @ xmath3 is a solution the vacuum einstein s equation of @ xmath1 , i . e . , @ xmath190 = - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ nabla _ a \ nabla _ a h ^ h _ { \ , } - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ nabla ^ c \ nabla _ a h _ { b } + \ nabla ^ c \ nabla _ { ( ) } h _ { c ) \ } = \ , \ , \ , \ > [ \ , \ , , \ , { 1 } \ ] ] where , and in the notation , @ xmath191 is the differential equation associated with @ xmath1 , and and are raised and lowered with @ xmat##h1 . 0 ( [ lee ] ) holds true for @ xmath189 , and , therefore , if @ xmath192 , @ xmath3 is centered on @ xmath193 . however , even if @ xmath192 , the volume of each component of @ xmath3 is locally integrable with respect to the volume of components with @ xmath171 , i . e . , each component , @ xmath179 , has a unique @ xmath194 distribution on the entire spacetime itself , namely @ xmath50 . _ also , @ xmath3 is well defined as a distribution on regions of spacetime . _ the [ @ xmath195 / ' \ \ $ ] is also very well defined as a distribution . this distribution has the property of being the ` ` source ' ' for the entire space ( [ see : time - space ] ) , if all of our spacetimes @ xmath42 for @ xmath54 have been the ` ` source ' ' ' @ xmath196 . it follows directly from this . ( [ lee ] ) that , as a distribution, @ xmath197 must have appeared in @ xmath8 in the way that it would appear when acting on a symmetric tensor field @ xmath198 whose boundary does not intersect @ xmath8 . we can use @ xmath197 . by definition , @ xmath195 / [ \ , $ ] is the # ##al spacetime whose action on an arbitrary finite , compact support , symmetric tensor field @ xmath199 is given by @ xmath200 ##0 ^ { 4 } \ sqrt { - 1 } [ ^ 4x = [ \ , \ , , \ ] ] where @ xmath201 is the probability distribution associated with @ xmath171 and we have used the fact that the distribution @ xmath202 is self - adjoint but if self - adjoint , then the adjoint of @ xmath202 would have nothing in it . ( [ 1 : 1 - 2 ] ) . ] . note that the negative side of this equation is not true since @ xmath203 $ ] is a symmetric tensor field of compact support and @ xmath204 is not @ xmath194 .we can obtain the second part of this . ( [ see : power - series ] ) by integrating over the region @ xmath205 and then defining the region as @ xmath206 . unlike the region @ xmath207 , @ xmath204 is finite , and a ` ` ` integration by parts ' ' theorem shows that @ xmath208 h ^ { ab } - f ^ { ( x ) } _ { ab } [ f _ { ab } ] h ^ { ab } = \ nabla _ { f ^ a \ , \ , , \ ] ] where @ xmath209 where @ xmath210 . since @ xmath211 = [ $ ] for @ xmath189 , it follows immediately that @ xmath212 h ^ { ab } = \ frac { 1 } { a \ , } \ lim _ { \ , \ rightarrow \ } \ int _ { a = \ , } f ^ { r _ a = \ , \ , . \ ] ] . . . ( [ see : power - series ] ) and ( [ see : adjoint - product ]) , we see that @ xmath213 has the form @ xmath214 where @ xmath215 is the smooth , symmetric ( @ xmath216 ) tensor field of @ xmath8 whose derivatives are given in terms of the partial derivatives of @ xmath217 and their higher order derivatives . in other words , the distribution @ xmath197 is given by both @ xmath8 and @ xmath218 , and we have to factor in these derivatives so that this also holds for an arbitrary value of n . ] @ xmath219 where @ xmath220 is the ` ` ' l - function ' ' ( i . e . , @ xmath221 ) . we also consider the fact that , since the differential operators @ xmath202 satisfy the linear bianchi equation @ xmath222 , the distribution @ xmath197 must satisfy @ xmath223 in the usual sense . this means that the definition of @ xmath197 must hold for any symmetric tensor field of the form @ xmath224 where @ xmath225 is smooth and of compact support .in other words , in fig . ( [ f ] ) , the inner product @ xmath226 of @ xmath8 must be such that for any arbitrary smooth vector field @ xmath227 in spacetime , we have @ xmath228 . for all @ xmath79 , take @ xmath227 to have components of the form @ xmath229 , where : @ xmath230 ( @ xmath231 ) is an arbitrary smooth function of compact support . @ xmath174 and @ xmath232 is a smooth function of . ##est ##imating , with @ xmath233 being a component of @ xmath8 . in fig . ( [ nf ] ) gives @ xmath234 for all @ xmath235 , which also implies that @ xmath236 for all @ xmath79 and all @ xmath231 . in other words , we have so that @ xmath215 can take the form @ xmath237 where @ xmath7 is the vector field to @ xmath8 , i . e . , @ xmath7 ##8the z - norm of @ xmath8 . we take @ xmath227 to be an arbitrary vector number , of the type . [ . . ( [ nf ] ) and ( [ f ] ) for @ xmath238 where we take the coefficients of @ xmath174 to give the following result . since @ xmath227 is constant , this also implies that @ xmath239 this , in turn , implies that @ xmath240 i . e . , @ xmath32 is a constant of @ xmath8 , and , if @ xmath241 , @ xmath242 i . e . , is the case where @ xmath241 , @ xmath8 is a constant of @ xmath176 , as we want to see . . it is essential that this theorem be used for the further development of the metric , since any theorem that holds for @ xmath243 , would assume that the vectors are constant . ] in particular , we have shown that for any one - dimensional family of vectors @ xmath42 , properties ( i ) - ( ii ) of the[ 1 : 1 ] , to first order in @ xmath2 , the # ##aday value of @ xmath3 corresponds to a solution to the ordinary differential equation with a point particle , @ xmath244 where @ xmath32 is a point and @ xmath7 is the state - vector of @ xmath8 , which would be a point if @ xmath241 . we refer to @ xmath32 as the _ output _ of the source . it is quite clear that the point _ source ( [ ptparticle ] ) is the _ output _ of our model rather than the source . thus , we see that the description we have just obtained is what provides the basis for the notion of ` ` point particle ' ' a concept that has played a central role in particle physics for more than two centuries . in particular , the notion of point particle makes perfect mathematical sense in the context of quantum field theory and general relativity . however , we have already proved that the notion of a ( structureless ) ` ` point particle ' ' exists only as an _ internal _ structure of ` massive particles ' , a description that is equivalent to first order in @ xmath2 in the contextand for all one - dimensional families of particles @ xmath42 satisfying the requirements of theorem [ 1 : 1 ] . this theorem is true regardless of the mass of the ` ` particle ' ' , e . g . , it holds with equal probability for a massive black hole and for a massive body of dark matter . in the previous section , we showed that , to first order in @ xmath2 , a particle ( or black hole ) of nonvanishing mass moves in a neighborhood of the local spacetime . most of the remainder of this section will be devoted to showing the solution to this problem , and to first order in @ xmath2 of the local field . in this section , we raise the question of what is meant by the ` ` motion of the body ' ' to first order in @ xmath2 . the first thing that should be clearly stated is that it is far from clear how to define ` ` motion ' ' in terms of the worldline for @ xmath54 . moreover , the metric @ xmath42 is defined only for @ xmath188 , and for for @ xmath2 the spacetime metric can not even be defined in a neighborhood of @ x##math8 . if we were to assume that @ xmath245 and that the body @ xmath246 is ` ` filled in ' ' with a ` ` strong dark hole ' ' and that @ xmath247 , where @ xmath248 is the supremum of the value of the mean curvature tensor of @ xmath61 in the ` ` filled in ' ' region , it should be possible to apply a ` ` center of gravity ' ' worldline at finite @ xmath2 , and we could use this worldline to describe the motion of the body @ xcite . however , we do not want to make any ` ` weak field ' ' assumptions here , since we wish to apply to all of the black holes and other ` ` weak field ' ' properties . since it is not clear how to apply this worldline to the body at finite @ xmath2and , therefore , the ` ` body ' ' is removed from the spacetime , we have at finite @ xmath2it is not clear what we would do by applying ` ` perturbative corrections ' ' to @ xmath8 to first and second particles of @ xmath2 . thehowever , that should be noted , that if we have difficulty in finding the worldlines of the motion the vector in , @ xmath2 , @ xmath249 , the ` ` first order ' @ xmath2 perturbative correction ' ' , @ xmath29 , to the first order in @ xmath8 ( defined by @ xmath250 ) is then simply defined as the time component of the vector field , @ xmath251 , defined by @ xmath8 . this vector field gives the ` ` time correction ' ' to the same degree to first order in @ xmath2 . the time component , @ xmath252 , of @ xmath251 depends only on how we define the time components of the worldlines for different values of @ xmath2 and is not always constant ; we can define @ xmath253 such that @ xmath251 is related to the vector , @ xmath7 , to @ xmath8 and the vector , @ xmath176 . thus , when we have equations of motion giving the first order perturbative correction to the motion , we are lookingis satisfied by the gauge transformations @ xmath254 and @ xmath8 . the first point that should be explicitly stated is that @ xmath251 and the equations of motion satisfied by @ xmath251 will depend on our choice of basis for @ xmath3 . to prove this point , assume that we have a basis and a vector . @ xmath116 is a smooth under the gauge transformation given at the end of article [ 2 : 3 ] . however , there needs to be only @ xmath255 for our consderations of . the changes in the equations of motion under non - linear gauge transformations can be described in the [ . ] gauge transformations of the basis @ xmath256 under this gauge transformation , we have @ xmath257 if , then , the corresponding equations of motion will be of the form @ xcite @ xmath258 where @ xmath259 therefore , we need that @ xmath251 transforms to @ xmath260 in order that they satisfy the same gauge transformations . therefore , the new gauge transformation , @ xmath254 , to the description of motion provides the necessary .is itself and , therefore , it can only be brought to zero by a simple gauge transformation . thus the term @ xmath261 has gauge invariant properties . we turn again to the definition of the first - order state . our definition relies on the fact , stated in the [ see : below ] section , that for all @ xmath37 , @ xmath262 is a compact , locally flat spacetime . moreover , @ xmath164 has well defined sets of electric ( ` ` electric moment ' ' ) and angular magnetic ( ` ` magnetic moment ' ' ) multipole moments @ xcite and , therefore , the spacetime is determined by the product of these two sets of multipole moments @ xcite . the multipole moments ( other than the two nonvanishing multipoles of the state ) depend upon a choice of conformal factor @ xcite , which , rougly says , corresponds to a choice of ` ` origin ' ' . we define the conformal factor @ xmath263 to be one of the multipoles , corresponding to being the origin of @ xmath264 . for a solution of the form : . ( [ see : .##nearzone2 ] ) with @ xmath265 . our coordinate system showed in the previous section that @ xmath266 = @ xmath8the this will be just the @ xmath267 part of the coefficient of @ xmath268 of the order @ xmath72 and of @ xmath269 . therefore , the mass - moment will be the coefficient of the @ xmath270 part of this expansion in time @ xmath271 . it is also known that if the origin is nonzero , the mass - moment is ` ` ' origin ' ' and can be set to zero by choice of conformal factor / ` ` origin ' ' . we then can show that , with our choice of conformal factor @ xmath263 , the mass - moment can be set to zero by a simple linear transformation of the origin ( [ lee : 1 ] ) . it follows from the partial differential equation ( [ differential ] ) with equation ( [ ptparticle ] ) applied to @ xmath3 , etc . ( [ lee : 1 - 1 ] ) , that the space - time evolution of @ x##math3 takes the form @ xmath272 i . e . , in the case of ex . ( [ linear : rseries ] ) , we have @ xmath273 . starting with ex . ( [ linear : fullnearzone ] ) ( and then using the expression that @ xmath274 ) , we see that for example @ xmath37 @ xmath275 from this expression , we see that the ` ` invariant mass ' ' , @ xmath32 , of the ` ` displacement ' ' of the boundary - free space ( see ex . ( [ ptparticle ] ) ) is exactly the komar / adm mass of the compact , locally flat spacetime @ xmath276 . we then see the effect of the linear transformation ( [ linear : transform ] ) in @ xmath277 . the transformation ( [ linear : transform ] ) corresponds to replacing the linear form in @ xmath278 i . e . , to reverse it in @ xmath2 , which corresponds to a ` ` invariant mass ' ' of x . since @ xmath279 it can be madethat this transformation has the interpretation of representing the mass - moment in @ xmath280 . in fact , we can now modify @ xmath281 so as to bring the mass - moment to zero . thus , the ` ` near zone ' ' coordinates @ xmath282 for which the mass - moment exists have the interpretation of representing ` ` near zone ' ' coordinates to first order in @ xmath2 . the transformation @ xmath283 of the ' ` ` near zone ' ' coordinates @ xmath284 also has the interpretation of representing the ` ` radius ' ' of the center of mass of the object to first order in @ xmath2 . we shall use this to make the transformation to our coordinates to first order in @ xmath2 , , as follows : first , we shall define our coordinates , @ xmath51 , to first order in @ xmath2 by choosing the coordinates for the ` ` local spacetime ' ' @ xmath176 . ( we shall choose # ##onic coordinates based on @ xmath8 . ) second , we shall define our coordinates , @ xmath51 , to first order in @ x##math2 : choose a new coordinate for @ xmath3 , etc . ( [ math : time - space ] ) . ( we can use the standard gauge @ xmath285 . ) or we can use the standard gauge theory ( [ q : 1 ] ) , and remove the requirement that @ xmath286 is such that the moment and time of @ xmath276 are for all @ xmath37 . since the ` ` motion ' ' of the body in the new coordinates is @ xmath287 , the only possible perturbative solution @ xmath254 to the motion of the body in our new coordinates @ xmath51 will be given by @ xmath288 of course , the solution @ xmath254 that we consider in the given case will depend upon the particular one - parameter family @ xmath42 that we consider . what is of interest are the ` ` universal relations ' ' given by @ xmath254 that are independent of the choice of one - parameter family under equations ( i ) - ( ii ) of equation [ 1 : 1 ] . these universal relations would provide us with ` ` solutions of' ' ' for point particles that take g - force forces into account . in the next section , we will show ( via a brief introduction ) that such a general ##ization holds for @ xmath289 , by providing us with the ` ` equations of motion ' ' for the ` ` point particles ' ' , up to second order in @ xmath2 . however , we note that if we wish to extend motion from first order in @ xmath2 , it will be necessary to define a ` ` representative world ##line ' ' in the local space to at least second order in @ xmath2 . we shall not attempt to do this in this paper . the lack of a ` representative worldline is probably the greatest obstacle to extending the results of this paper to higher levels of world ##s . in the section [ sec : elastic ] we show that second - order far field equations of the local spacetime @ xmath176 are derived from the local elastic g - tensor , viz . ( [ ptparticle ] ) . for the results of this paper , we will show that @ xmath241 , and that , as shown in section [ sec : elastic ] , the localthis system is represented by a map , @ xmath8 , of the background spacetime . we also have coordinates for the components of the neutral gravitational field , @ xmath290 , its first order , , @ xmath291 , and its second order , @ xmath292 . it is possible to take our coordinates @ xmath51 to first order in @ xmath2 to the # ##onic coordinates with respect to the map , @ xmath8 , and take these coordinates to second order in @ xmath2 so that @ xmath293 satisfy the einstein field equation @ xmath294 , where @ xmath295 with @ xmath296 . then the resulting field equation is @ xmath297 this system of equations can be solved using the hadamard gauge theory of dewitt and brehme @ xcite . since this theory has been used in all the studies of the g - theory , we will not test theories , but rather find solutions . equation ( 1 . 1 ) of mino , sasaki , and tanaka @ xcite gives a general solution for theexpressions in terms of the functions and operators ##ometric - functions of the background metric ( see , e . g . , in @ xcite for details of these quantities ) . the local normal coordinate components of these quantities are then expressed with the system of equations from table 2 of poisson @ xcite . combining this with the expression of the background metric in the polar coordinates , we have @ xmath298 where the expressions @ xmath299 and @ xmath300 are given by the following expressions in terms of the local normal coordinate components of the phase space of the background metric @ xmath301 and @ xmath302 and @ xmath303 are given by @ xmath304 using these expressions , @ xmath305 is the s - type time world , , , with a value of @ xmath306 , in @ xcite . as previously stated , the expression @ xmath23 indicates that the domain of the function is just outside of the standard model @ xmath24 , and that only the ` ` center ' ' ( i . e . , part of the light source ) consists ofthe usual mathematical notation is used ( see , e . g . , see @ xcite for details ) . we use @ xmath303 , rather than dealing with derivatives of @ xmath302 , because @ xmath302 is not defined on the worldline . ( however , this non - differentiability is due only to the derivatives of the derivative of @ xmath302 on the worldline @ xmath8 = @ xmath303 plus the upper derivative of the integrand of , which is equal to @ xmath307 plus the derivative of @ xmath24 . ] , so that solutions of this are well - known . ) a solution of the term ( equivalent to ` ` ' background noise ' ' ) was developed for solving these problems . this solution is not optimal , and we could add an additional explicit solution @ xmath179 of the standard differential equation to the second term , @ xmath2 , on the right side of s . ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) , which could then be solved by all of our solutions simultaneously . however , for this , we do not require the existence of such a solution . our solution ofincreasing g - theory to first order in @ xmath2 will require consideration of second - order # ##s , so we will need to extend the definition of @ xmath42 ##0 beyond this . ( [ sec : sec ] ) . ( this should not seem surprising in view of all that our previous description , the [ sec : metric ] of the expansion to first order in @ xmath2 , requires consideration of second - order gravitational fields . ) in particular , we will need an explicit expression for the quantity @ xmath308 , in the free variable in g . ( [ sec : rseries ] ) , i . e . , the quantity of interest @ xmath26 that has the most efficient expansion is @ xmath309 ( or , @ xmath310 ) . the second - order term @ xmath311 is the second - order einstein equation , which has the form @ xmath312 = - [ ^ { ( x ) } _ { 1 } [ a , b ] \ ] ] where @ xmath313 is the second order einstein equation and the local term @ xmath##314 . since the @ xmath315 part of @ xmath3 corresponds to the ordinary schwarzschild metric in polar coordinates ( see ref . ( [ ji : e ] ) ) , it is clear that there is a general solution to e . ( [ ji : e2 ] ) of the equation @ xmath316 and @ xmath187 , where @ xmath317 and @ xmath318 , whereas @ xmath319 . ( the previously stated solution on the right side of ref . ( [ ji ] ) is simply the @ xmath320 part of the schwarzschild metric in polar coordinates . ) the general solution to e . ( [ ji : e2 ] ) can also be written as @ xmath321 where @ xmath322 is a particular solution of the ordinary differential equation . we wish to compute the @ xmath323 part of @ xmath322 , i . e . , from @ xmath324 we wish to compute @ xmath325 . thus , although the solutions of appear to not appear in @ xmath2dependent upon a choice of gauge to first order in @ xmath2 ( see also [ gauge : theory ] ) , they do not depend upon a choice of gauge to first order in @ xmath2 , since a second order gauge transformation does not change the mass - energy of the particle generated by @ xmath326 . ( we have already shown by a simple , mathematical proof that second order gauge transformations do not induce changes in the equations of gauge to first order in @ xmath2 . ) therefore , we are able to impose an ( arbitrary ) second order gauge transformation on @ xmath322 . it would be natural to require that the standard gauge condition @ xmath327 be applied to our @ xmath328 . the @ xmath329 part of the standard einstein equation combined with the @ xmath330 part of the standard gauge condition , yields @ xmath331 where @ xmath332 . this system of equations for @ xmath333 is the same system of equations that is used by the solutions of the standard spacetime standard einstein equation ( where our @ xmath334 will depend upon it ) . the stationary solutionof these three , @ xmath335 , @ xmath336 , and @ xmath337 , where @ xmath33 is antisymmetric , @ xmath338 , where @ xmath232 , @ xmath33 , and @ xmath339 have a time dependence , and where @ xmath340 was introduced in 2007 . ( [ 3 ] ) . using a simple second order linear transformation ( of the form @ xmath341 ) , we can get @ xmath342 . we then get @ xmath343 which is of the same type as the # ##ised @ xmath270 metric of curved spacetime ( see , e . g . , @ xcite ) , except that the metric is different for @ xmath33 and @ xmath339 . as we shall see here , @ xmath33 and @ xmath339 correspond , respectively , to the time and space - dependence of the metric . we then can solve for the metric ##s @ xmath344 , @ xmath345 where we have found the metric ##s @ xmath143 and@ xmath346 , and @ xmath347 . the antisymmetric tensor whose space components vanish @ xmath33 and whose time components vanish , i . e . , @ xmath348 we can use the transformation described in section [ 1 : transformation ] . we choose t _ t _ the center of the tensor , @ xmath349 and then @ xmath286 so as to make the total time moment of @ xmath350 vanish for all @ xmath37 . a simple application of the fourier transform ( [ 1 : transform2 ] ) to the tensor ( [ 1 : metric2 ] ) : @ xmath351 n ^ j \ k _ { \ alpha \ beta } + \ frac { 1 } { \ hat { r } ^ 2 } k _ { ( \ alpha } k _ { \ alpha ) \ } ( \ hat { r } ) n ^ j \ \ & \ qquad \ alpha + \ frac { 1 } { \ hat { r } } k _ { \ alpha \ beta } ( \ hat { r } , \ alpha , \ alpha ) + k _ { \ alpha \ beta } ( \( { r } , \ lambda , \ phi ) + ( ( r ) \ biggr ) + ( ( \ lambda ^ 2 ) , \ end { r } \ ] ] where we have ` ` ` ' ' the results of the linear transformation that interfaces @ xmath352 and @ xmath353 into the metric space @ xmath354 . the ` ` ` vector field ' ' ' ( ' ref .

( [ e : metric2 ] ) to the near zone expansion e . ( [ e : scaled - metric ] ) should be considered . for example , the spin term @ xmath36##8 originated as a second order term in the far zone , but it now appears as part of the scaled - metric in the near zone expansion . in contrast , the term @ xmath369 originated as part of the scaled metric in the near zone , but it now appears as a second order term in the near zone expansion . it is easy to see from fig . ( [ ap : scaled - metric ] ) that @ xmath370 is the mass - moment of @ xmath371 at time @ xmath37 . we also have @ xmath372 for time @ xmath174 . therefore , the mass - moment will appear in our table above . although we have ` ` ' ' ' for @ xmath281 in fig . ( [ ap ] ) , we have not found anything useful about the motion . its equivalent to simply solving the mass - moment @ xmath373 in the polar coordinates . the rest of this table can also be viewed as [ solving one of the second - order equations ##s for the mass - moment and for the motion to be solved . ] any more information about @ xmath281 ?refrain from assuming that the coordinates @ xmath42or , equivalently , @ xmath61be solutions of einstein s equation . we can solve einstein s equation perturbatively , via the far zone expansion and the near zone expansion . the two sets of coordinates are exactly equal , but the solutions are written quite differently . we find it more convenient to work with the near zone expansion , and we do so here . we note , however , that we could very well have used the far zone expansion instead . we also note that no exact solutions of can be obtained by combining the near and far zone expansion , since these coordinates have already been properly ` ` scaled ' ' via etc . ( [ p : rseries ] ) , ( [ bnmp ] ) , and ( [ q : fullnearzone ] ) . in the meantime , in order to make the calculation less difficult , we can remove the ` ` scale ' ' from the near - zone expansion @ xmath374 and add the coordinates @ xmath375 . no confusion should arise from this , since we do not need occassion to use the properly scaled coordinates @ xmath58 ##5 . on the other hand, we can write the ` ` ' ' ' on the line @ xmath356 , since we will maintain occassion to the lines @ xmath356 and @ xmath51 ##6 . using this method and setting the two initial moments to 0 , etc .

( [ 1 : 1 - metric2 ] ) , in @ xmath379 it is clear that the term of the@ xmath271 and @ xmath380 . @ xmath381 can not contribute to the background ricci tensor to order @ xmath377 . however , it is known that the terms of order @ xmath271 and 2 in the above einstein equation do not contribute to the background ricci tensor to order @ xmath377 , so , to expand @ xmath377 , we need that @ xmath382 satisfy the above einstein equation for the schwarzschild metric . it is also possible to expand @ xmath382 in tensor spherical coordinates . we get a very useful piece of information by expanding the @ xmath383 , magnetic moment part of the background ricci tensor that exists only under time reversal . on account of the symmetry of the underlying schwarzschild metric , only the @ xmath383 , magnetic moment , even under time reversal part of the metric , can exist . however , the same @ xmath383 , symmetric ( but not necessarily spin invariant ) magnetic moment @ xmath384 can be expanded in tensor spherical coordinates to ( say , ) .ex . , @ xcite ( @ xcite + ( a16 - 1 ) ) @ xmath385 where the solutions of @ xmath386 are independent of @ xmath387 . the two - dimensional form of these equations leads to the slightly different ` ` @ xmath149 - 1 ' ' for each @ xmath383 tensor . thus , we know that there are a sum ##mation of three forms of @ xmath383 tensor in coordinates . the two forms associated with solutions of @ xmath388 are of electric type , whereas the two ones associated with @ xmath389 are of magnetic type . for the constant tensor ( [ right : top - down ] ) the ` ` constant tensor ' ' @ xmath365 and @ xmath390 have a positive sign and do not change . it turns out that @ xmath391 ' does not contribute to the @ xmath383 , however , form of the corresponding ricci tensor that holds true for the derivatives : since @ xmath392 is independent of @ xmath156 the ` ` @ xmath32 '' part of @ xmath392 is even under time reversal , whereas the ` ` @ xmath145 ' ' part of @ xmath391 is not gauge . therefore , the only term that fails to convert @ xmath377 to the @ xmath383 , the field component of of the magnetic ricci tensor that is even under time reversal is @ xmath393 . solution of the - einstein equation to infinity @ xmath377 requires that this term exists . we thus obtain that @ xmath394 i . e . , to this point , the tensor is parallelly invariant with respect to the gauge field along the worldline @ xmath8 . having set the last term to zero in q . ( [ d : scaled - 1 ] ) , we can now insert the last term of q . ( [ e : scaled - 1 ] ) into the - einstein equation and set the @ xmath377 term back to zero . it is possible that we can now obtain that for @ xmath395 , @ xmath359 , and @ xmath396 . however , these relations may not be ofsee proof for the ` ` equations of motion ' ' i . e . , for relating @ xmath281 and its partial derivatives to other quantities because the quantity of value @ xmath397 always occurs in conjunction with the quantity @ xmath398 , which is equivalent to the above . therefore , we shall not directly compute the quantity obtained from the standard einstein equation above . we shall compute the order of @ xmath281 that can be obtained from the non - second - order einstein equation @ xmath399 = - 1 ^ { ( 1 ) } _ { 1 } [ \ bar { f } ^ { ( 1 ) } , \ bar { g } ^ { ( 1 ) } ] , \ ] ] where , from 1 . ( [ 1 : 1 - metric2 ] ) , we have that @ xmath400 where we have . @ xmath401 we wish to extend the second order einstein equation to include @ xmath271 and @ xmath380 , which , as we shall see here , are the two nontrivial terms on @ xmath268 and @ xmath378 that satisfy . first , we define @ xmath40##2 $ ] . the terms appearing in this table can be put into one of the following general ##izations ( i ) @ xmath403 ; ( ii ) @ xmath404 ; ( iii ) @ xmath405 where @ xmath406 is the christoffel symbol of the above homogeneous metric ; ( iv ) @ xmath407 ; and ( v ) @ xmath408 . from the definition of @ xmath409 together with the fact that @ xmath410 and @ xmath411 , it is clear that either of these terms will change to @ xmath412 $ ] to either @ xmath271 or @ xmath380 . thus , we can consider @ xmath413 as in the above , homogeneous metric wave equation . we can consider the homogeneous ricci flow of the form @ xmath413 . by means of fig . ( [ 3 : 1 - 2 ] ) , it will happen that terms that change @ xmath184 ( from two partial derivatives depending on the ` ` 0 ' ' term ) and @ xmath414 ( from two derivatives ) can change .however , it is very easy to see that the first solution to the @ xmath184 and @ xmath414 equations can be by virtue of the fact that the term @ xmath171 is a solution to the equation ##nr and the term corresponding to @ xmath2 in fig . ( [ 1 : metric2 ] ) is the slightly superior second einstein equation ( which has already been solved ) . it also is possible that there is a solution of @ xmath413 to the second ricci tensor that is of order @ xmath415 . therefore , the only nontrivial terms that appear in the second order einstein equation are orders @ xmath271 and @ xmath380 , as shown above . the reduction of the second ricci tensor to order @ xmath271 and @ xmath380 for the first solution @ xmath413 is very easy , and we can save our time by working down the second solution of the second einstein equation to these terms . our goal / expectation ( which can be carried out by our algorithm ) is to find the solution for @ xmath416 . since this equation is of@ xmath383 , magnetic - part and , even under time reversal , we shall focus on the @ xmath383 , electric part , and the time reversal part of the corresponding ricci tensor of @ xmath413 of both @ xmath271 and @ xmath380 . from fig . ( [ 2 : 1 ] ) , we see that the @ xmath383 electric - part of the ricci tensor that is @ xmath417 and even under time reversal can be written as @ xmath418 whereas the @ xmath383 part of the ricci tensor that is @ xmath419 and even under time reversal can be written as @ xmath420 thus , in addition to the terms of , @ xmath421 are ` ` independent ' ' , i . e , they have no dependence on @ xmath422 . we shall consider the terms of @ xmath413 that also belong to these ricci tensor . the term @ xmath423 has no @ xmath424 dependence . however , the @ xmath425 magnetic - part of this termwe , in fact , start with the @ xmath383 magnetic term ` ` spin term ' ' @ xmath426 in the background scaled metric to give a solution to the modified ricci tensor of the following form . this contribution will be equal to @ xmath427 for the spin terms in @ xmath413 , the ` ` spin term ' ' @ xmath426 in the background scaled metric does not contribute to the other terms of the modified ricci tensor , so we will treat the spin terms in @ xmath413 as if they were part of schwarzschild . however , for the @ xmath383 , magnetic term , where , a varying combination of these terms will result . the corresponding solutions to @ xmath428 , and @ xmath429 are @ xmath430 and @ xmath431 where , by definition . ( [ 2 ] ) , we have @ xmath432 ( the spin term @ xmath300 has not appeared in the above equation because it has no @ xmath383 term . ) the @ xmath433 is " not " .these are . by similar derivation that involves @ xmath434 and the following partial differential equation @ xmath435 , we can obtain the above equations for our respective systems . now , in order to understand ` ` universial ' ' dynamics , we are interested in equations that do not involve @ xmath436 and @ xmath437 . it can be seen that there are three important conditions in near - zone dynamics : the determination of the mass , its derivative , and the time derivative of the magnetic moment in the @ xmath37 . the first equation should come from the second - order near - zone differential equation , which we do not actually know . in fact , it should not be possible to say that the mass must have a second time derivative in order to describe the motion . ] , for @ xmath438 and @ xmath439 the first equation involves @ xmath440 and time derivative of @ xmath281 , and does not impose constraints on the motion . therefore , the second equation involves the equations of motion . taking all the values of the mass shown in fig . ( [ 2 ] ) , we obtain @ xmath44##1 where we have taking account of the fact ( mentioned above ) that for @ xmath442 and @ xmath443 , we have @ xmath444 . using the method of simple form @ xmath445 , we have @ xmath446 and , according to the formula given in the [ 1 : sec ] section , the first possible perturbative solution , @ xmath447 , to the metric @ xmath8 of the metric spacetime is @ xmath448 in addition , we have also shown that @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 are # ##s @ xmath8 . taking account of the fact that this equation is written in the simple form of @ xmath8 and that @ xmath253 , we can write this equation in a more " complex " form of @ xmath449 where @ xmath7 is the solution to @ xmath8 and @ xmath450 . however , it should be noted that this equation describes the local metric only when the vector field is in the local direction ( see figure a ) .the first term in fig . ( [ e : eom ] ) ( or , equivalently , in fig . ( [ e : eomcov ] ) ) is the ` ` gravitational energy ' ' as proposed by papapetrou @ xcite . forces from the multipole moment do not appear in our model because they tend to much less than the observed gravitational moment , and so would appear at higher energies than @ xmath2 in our original scheme . the second term belongs to the other side of the ` deviation equation , and arises because the observed worldline is not ( except in extreme cases ) aligned with the observed worldline . in the example @ xmath451 , the particle now moves along a series of curves of the same length parameterized by @ xmath2 , and the perturbative equation of motion should therefore be the ` deviation equation . ] . the third term is the ` ` gravitational self - energy ' ' , which is assumed to take the form of a ( fictitious ) gravitational force from the source its own energy . our model has thus provided a simple proof of the two assumptions that have been made above . first , we .that , although our analysis has many points of agreement with other analyses of similar zone expansion , there are a number of important differences . we have already noted in section [ sec : example ] that our derivation of the forces of first order at @ xmath2 appears to differ from our other analyses @ xcite , which do not seem to satisfy the condition that @ xmath241 . we also have already noted that unlike other contributions to g - theory @ xcite , what happens to our scaled metric at @ xmath38 is _ allowed _ to be of schwarzschild scale . in these two analyses , first order terms of the same zone expansion are treated as time derivatives , and are allowed to be dependent on the schwarzschild scale . in this we make no assumptions about the time - dependence of the components of the scaled metric except those that follow from our fundamental theorem ( i ) - ( ii ) of section [ sec : example ] . however , our first order terms are allowed to have time dependence on @ xmath156 , and our second order terms to depend quadratically on @ xmath156 . wewe make no assumptions about the spacetime of @ xmath165 and also impose no boundary conditions for the @ xmath72 . however , there is a significant difference in the way in which the gauge equations used to describe the metric are interpreted . in @ xcite , the small @ xmath424 gauge field factor of what amounts to our first order near zone metric is set to zero without any assumptions . the factor that is used for the equations of motion in @ xcite is of ` ` acceleration type ' ' ( with exponential decay in @ xmath72 ) and does not have an exact interpretation in terms of the change of the center of mass . ] . in contrast , our ` ` ' acceleration type ' ' ' corresponds to the _ ' _ near - zone metric and has been justified as having ` ` center of mass ' ' properties . as is mentioned at the end of fig [ 1 : 1 ] , the vector @ xmath29 ##5 fig . is the ` ` state vector ' ' acting on the gauge field @ xmath8 that is the first term of @ xmath2 corresponding to the metric . for a sufficiently large volume of .##times @ xmath42 ##3 the assumptions made in the [ see : below ] , etc . are all known to be a good approximation to the motion from the perspective of time @ xmath8 and @ xmath35 . in other words , if @ xmath8 is replaced by @ xmath250 , then the local worldline metric given by @ xmath452 is the best description of motion to first obtain from @ xmath2 ( when the metric tensor is a local metric ) and is therefore guaranteed to be accurate to time @ xmath2 . however , this guarantee is of the form that if one wants to describe the motion accurately up to time @ xmath174 , then it also will be possible to make @ xmath2 sufficiently small that @ xmath452 is a good approximation up to time @ xmath174 . the guarantee is _ _ _ of the form that if @ xmath2 is known to be sufficiently small , then @ xmath452 will accurately describe the motion for any time . therefore , for any time @ xmath453 , it is to be assumed that @ xmath447 .is used at very short intervals , and it is clear that the original model of the @ xmath452 would not be able to be accurate when @ xmath447 is used , since by the time the model has changed significantly from the original model of @ xmath8 , the motion itself can only be accurately described in the sense of being a ` ` partial solution ' ' to @ xmath8 . therefore , the only practical application of the first order differential equations of motion is to model motion in systems , such as inspiral , where the changes from the original model have been large at all times . it is also clear that etc . , as it stands , is inadequate for describing long term motions , such as inspiral . a possible solution to the general problem would be to turn to first order order field theory . however , it seems likely that this will not work . although the equations of motion derived from @ xmath454th and field theory will be more accurate than the first order equations , they will also have a domain of motion that is much larger than the first order equations . the perturbative approach at any given time will be to model the system as .` ` ' deviation ' ' from @ xmath8 , and would not be able to describe motion even when the corrections are , in fact , small . in fact , given the fact that the deviation from @ xmath8 has been too small to satisfy first order correction theory and that , e . g . , the second order corrections are comparable in time to the first order corrections , one would expect that the @ xmath455th order corrections will also be comparable to the @ xmath454th order corrections , but @ xmath454th order correction theory will not be good enough . only by going to all orders in the theory can one expect to have an accurate , even in approximation , description of motion via the theory . of course , if one goes to all orders in the theory , then there is no point in having any such theory at all . however , for a sufficiently large body of suffciently small radius , it is necessary that the corrections to the curvature should be _ _ _ _ and should be sufficiently small for eq . . at the time these small corrections have built up and the body has moved away from the curve .for this motion , it should also be equal to local _ close , and both of which should be a good approximation to the motion for that length of time . one could then try to ` ` piece together ' ' these solutions to obtain a world - line that better describes the motion of the particle for a given time . in the case of two such solutions with large distances between them , one expects the resulting worldline to be described by a certain ` ` self - consistent ' ' differential equation , which should very well - describe the motion as long as it is _ local _ close to the point . a simple , simplified example can help illustrate some of the important points . consider the case of a ` ` rigid wall ' ' . to find a simple solution that can be obtained in a form similar to that found in this example , let us consider a particle ( such as a piece of solid metal ) that is enclosed in a cylinder with no internal energy , and a hole of energy @ xmath456 is located in the this cylinder . we are interested in seeing how the size , @ xmath457 , of the hole increases with time . at time @ xmath456 , this is a very difficult task , sincethe body will still remain in the thermal equilibrium as it conducts energy through the medium . now , let us consider a two - dimensional system of equations where @ xmath458 ##2 goes to zero in @ xmath35 . when @ xmath82 , we find that the temperature , @ xmath459 , will not change with time , and the body will remain in thermal equilibrium at exactly @ xmath460 for all time . when we apply first order quantum mechanics with @ xmath2 , we will find that the smallest correction , @ xmath2 # , @ xmath461 , to the temperature , is small compared to the observed value of the energy ( as we would if we did @ xmath462 ) , we have a phase transition , where our assumptions are no longer valid . we ignore the effects and , just as in our above description of the structure of matter in general , we ignore the observed effects even though they should be observed when the mass of the body is less than the planck constant . ] @ xmath463 where @ xmath464 is the stefan - stefan constant and @ xmath465 . .that is the corresponding electron number , @ xmath460 , on the negative side of this equation because the term @ xmath466 is of second order in @ xmath2 , so the magnitude of the change in energy would be up to second order in @ xmath2 . since @ xmath460 is a constant , it is possible to extend fig . ( [ de ] ) to give , @ xmath467 thus , second order quantum theory gives the value of @ xmath468 and @ xmath469 although this is a good approximation at early times , it is a poor one at late times , since it assumes that the electrons will be lost . if one went to second order classical quantum theory , one would make corrections to fig . ( [ de ] ) that would take into account the second order energy , as well as the non - scattering conditions . however , this would still hold for some of the non - scattering electrons , and the real world results of classical ( or even nearly second order ) quantum theory would still be very poor . however , there is an important mathematical result that can be obtained by assuming that if @ xmat##h456 is sufficiently large , that the body should be temporarily in thermal equilibrium as it loses pressure . however , although the theory off of the first order solution should give accurate results at all times , higher order the theory off of _ the _ same _ solution should give more accurate results at all times . this means that if @ xmath456 is sufficiently small , the cooling of the body should be written as @ xmath470 when combined with the equation , @ xmath471 , that relates pressure to temperature when the body is in thermal equilibrium , this equation should give an accurate description of the cooling of the body that is accurate at all times . in addition , equation . ( [ denew ] ) takes into account the first order perturbative effects ( to some cases , @ xmath2 ) associated with the cooling of the body , but it ignores the perturbative effects associated with the body choosing to remain in thermal equilibrium as it does . # ( [ denew ] ) is _ not _ an _ equation ( since it does not take any non - thermal effects into account ) and it is _ not _ an equation that follows directly from the equation . however , itconsider an equation that applies to the first order quantum mechanics to a system that itself has changes arising from the perturbation . we can refer to such an equation as ` ` ` self - consistent perturbative equation ' ' . these equations are usually written as for systems that can be changed _ _ _ _ _ by a small change from a continuous function . how does one find a ` ` self - consistent perturbative equation ' ' for a given system for which one has solved first order perturbative equations ? we do not know that there is a standard method for finding a self - consistent perturbative equation . however , the following appear to be sufficient conditions to decide on a self - consistent perturbative equation : ( 1 ) it should have a well known initial value of . ( 2 ) it should have the same number of degrees of freedom as the first order perturbative equation , so that a correspondence can be found between initial values for the self - consistent perturbative equation and the first order perturbative equation . ( 3 ) for these initial values , the solutions to the self - consistent perturbative equation should be similar to the initial solutions of the first order perturbative equationis the time t for which the first order perturbative equation should be valid . we do not know of any reason why , for a given time , there should be a self - consistent perturbative equation satisfying these criteria . in cases where a self - consistent perturbative equation satisfying these criteria would exist , we would not expect it to be valid . for example , we could solve for . ( [ denew ] ) by adding the term corresponding to @ xmath472 to the right side of this equation . the first order perturbative equations for the motion of a rigid body show that the first order in general is @ xmath473 where @ xmath116 refers to the origin , @ xmath8 of the whole spacetime , and @ xmath7 is the solution to @ xmath8 . if we consider the general solution to this equation ( which also includes the first boundary condition ) , we have shown already in this case that the first order in @ xmath2 description of the motion from @ xmath8 to @ xmath474 with @ xmath475 where , for ., we have neglected the second term . the misataquwa equations @ xmath476 @ xmath477 @ xmath20 ( where one has the best solution to etc . ( [ misa2 ] ) ) are an excellent solution for self - consistent perturbative equations ( to the standard - model perturbative equations ) , since for the self - consistent perturbative equations , the distance from the self - consistent worldline should be . ] . however , @ xmath478 ( moving in the direction , ) refers to the self - consistent system @ xmath479 , rather than to a fixed system as usual . although a full numerical analysis of this integro - linear system has not been carried out , it is likely that our initial conditions ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) will be satisfied by the misataquwa equations . if so , they should provide a complete , polynomial - time , set of solutions for systems of constant - dimensional inspiral . we decided to contact joel cohen and eric poisson for their assistance . this project was funded in part by a grant phy04 - 56619 to the university of toronto and a grantthesis , space research , to 2001 . as stated in section [ sec : calculation ] , the description of motion will change under first - order transformations of gauge . however , in that section , we note that under a smooth gauge transformation , the description of motion changes in time . ( [ smoothgauge ] ) . also , as previously stated at the end of section [ sec : calculation ] , ( the article ) , the frame description changes under transformations that are not smooth [ @ xmath50 . since these transformations only occur in a frame and a line @ xcite , and therefore do not violate our assumptions . ] , we consider here the basis for the first order perturbative equations of motion for an arbitrary frame defined by our assumptions . we will consider the following self - consistent perturbative equations of motion . as previously stated in section [ sec : calculation ] ( with the equation @ sg . ( [ jh ] ) ) , the equations of motion to first order transformations @ xmath2 depend only upon the first order gauge transformation @ xmath480 . as we have shown , the magnetic moment only exists at first - order in ( see ##aday ) and ##s , so we will consider the followingof second - order gauge transformations on first - order manifold . this is given by @ xmath481 , with @ xmath482 where @ xmath483 is the second order . equivalently , we have @ xmath484 where @ xmath191 is the metric measure associated with the metric tensor @ xmath171 . in order to satisfy the condition for the gauge transformations ( differential equations ) , the components of @ xmath480 must be of the form @ xmath485 i . e . , @ xmath480 does not ` ` break up ' ' like @ xmath50 ##5 it can be defined in the sense that its components can have gauge - independent components . the g - factor , @ xmath373 , is one - third of the mass of the @ xmath383 component of the second component , @ xmath310 , part of the second order gauge transformation , @ xmath486 . similarly , @ xmath373 can be derived from the metric , @ xmath487 where a is the metric measure of the manifold of interest @ xmath488 . in thegauge transformation generated by @ xmath480 , we have @ xmath489 as previously stated , for an arbitrary first - order system of our equations , we have @ xmath490 where @ xmath32 is the mass of the particle . from fig . ( [ xiform ] ) , ( [ dg200 ] ) and ( [ g100 ] ) , we see that the change in @ xmath486 induced by our gauge transformation is @ xmath491 and , from fig . ( [ 1 : app - 1 ] ) , the corresponding change in the mass - vector is @ xmath492 where @ xmath493 is the identity vector of the state vector . and ( [ 1 ] ) is the change in the mass - vector induced by the corresponding non - trivial gauge transformation generated by @ xmath480 . the corresponding change in the first order perturbative equation of motion is generated by the change in the _ mass _ vector of @ xmath494 used to describe the _ state . for @ xmath495 , this transformation is generated by @ xmath496 ( [ fig . ). therefore , the gauge @ xmath497 given by the state equation for the new worldline is @ xmath498 with @ xmath499 given by . . . in the case where our new gauge is the null gauge , it follows directly from fig . ( [ e : eom ] ) that the new equation of motion for @ xmath500 is @ xmath501 where @ xmath502 is given by fig . ( [ e : power - 1 ] ) , and where , for simplicity , we have removed the shift operator . we can write fig . ( [ e : eom - app2 ] ) for @ xmath503 note that although fig . ( [ e : eom - app6 ] ) provides us with the new equation of motion for the explicitly defined gauge , the equations for elements of @ xmath504 can not be used in the new gauge . instead , one wishes to return to a self - consistent perturbative model consistent with the new choice of gauge . it is not clear how one would wish to change the governing equations for the # ##s of the new gauge .( another approach would be to first use fig . ( [ misa2 ] ) and then obtain the result by the use of @ xmath505 . it would be possible to find a new solution based on the ' ` ` s ' ' solution of the ordinary differential equation for the above result . ) thus , it follows that a good example of self - consistent perturbative theory corresponding to fig . ( [ q : eom - app6 ] ) would be @ xmath506 in the case where @ xmath480 is used ( note that , in fig . ( [ q : power - 1 ] ) , we have @ xmath507 ) this agrees with the results of barack and ori @ xcite . wald 1984 _ general relativity _ ( chicago , il : university of chicago press ) j . geroch and j . traschen , _ phys . rev . d _ * 44 * , 1017 ( 1987 ) s . israel 1972 _ relativity and gravity _ ( new york : wiley ) s . israel , _ nuovo rev . d _ * 44 * , ( 1966 ) s . mino , t . sasaki, and t . tanaka , _ phys . _ , * 55 * , 3457 - 3476 , ( 1997 ) j . j . quinn and j . j . wald , _ phys . d _ , * 55 * , 3381 - 3394 , ( 1997 ) a . detweiler and w . j . smith , _ phys . * 55 * , 024025 , ( 2003 ) a . poisson , _ ann . rel . _ * 9 * , ( 2004 ) r . j . dewitt and j . j . brehme , _ ann . _ , * 55 * , 220 - 259 , ( 1960 ) c . j . d . smith , _ proc . lond . d _ * 167 * 148 ( 1938 ) w . j . smith , _ j . math .
