gliese 229b is not only the first brown dwarf discovered by a @ xcite , but it is also the largest and best - studied brown dwarf planet . with an effective temperature of @ xmath5k , it lies somewhere between the hottest brown dwarfs ( @ xmath6k , @ xcite ) and the hottest planets of the solar system ( @ xmath7k ) . however , its near infrared spectrum shows the strong ch @ xmath8o # bands typical of ultra - high mass planets and the weak ch @ xmath9 ##o bands like the spectra of jupiter , saturn and neptune . the infrared nature of the spectrum of gl 229b is striking and hints at the recent discovery of extrasolar terrestrial planets which have effective temperatures in the range of 1600 @ xmath10k @ xcite . a wealth of data on gl 229b has accumulated since its discovery 20 years ago . the data ##ing from @ xmath11 to @ xmath12 and the direct measurement @ xcite allow for the determination of its effective temperature . further measurements @ xcite in the range from 3 . 8 to 4 . 8 @ xmath13 ##k have confirmed theat rapidly increasing wavelengths shortward of 1 @ xmath13 m , the _ abundance of ch @ xmath9 , cl @ xmath8o , and co , and also the _ abundance _ of the crh , feh , vo and tio and _ of late h and early k elements . griffith , noll , geballe & marley ( 1997 ) and @ xcite also observed elements with an abundance well below the value predicted by the simulations , a phenomenon commonly observed in the atmosphere of mars . the simulations for gl 229b @ xcite reproduce the observed mass distribution very accurately and all agree that 1 ) @ xmath5k , 2 ) due to the low abundance , the light flux is little if not none from the atmosphere , 3 ) the abundance of gl 229b is well known at present . the rapid decline of the flux at wavelengths shortward of 1 @ xmath13 m is interpreted as caused by an extreme excess of organic matter ( griffith , yelle & marley 1998 ) or possibly by the over - extended outer envelope of the type - h star at c . 1 @ xmath13 m ( tsuji , ohnaka & ao##ki 1999 ; smith , smith & smith 1999 ) . in this paper , we analyze the high - resolution spectra of the @ xmath0 , @ xmath1 , and @ xmath2 bands . with the exception of the ` ` r ' ' band of @ xcite , we analyze each part of the spectrum separately to obtain accurate estimates of the nh @ xmath8o abundance of gl 229b , known as the metallicity , to determine for the first time the presence of the @ xmath3 in the spectrum , and to determine the nh @ xmath3 abundance at two different temperatures in the spectrum . our results are mainly in terms of the observed spectra which can only be derived from the data given above . first , we obtain a wide range of acceptable combinations of @ xmath14 and gravity , and the corresponding infrared spectra of gl 229b @ xcite . the spectra and the corresponding infrared spectra are summarized in figure . figure 2 shows how highly accurate measurements , a well - defined spectral line , and statistical analysis can increase the acceptable range of combinations of @ xmath14 and gravity without having to resort to statistical analysis . the # ##al technique and our method of analysis areand table 4 . the results of the observations of spectra which are at least partially resolved are described in 5 , followed by a summary in 6 . finally , a summary of the results and directions for further study is given in 7 . spectra of gl 229b with three narrow slits in the @ xmath0 , @ xmath1 , and @ xmath2 bands were obtained with the 1 . 5 m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) in 1998 . , using the mass spectrum cgs4 @ xcite and a 10 m / s lens . details of the spectra are given in table 1 . these are among the highest resolution spectra known of a # ##m . the spectra were obtained in the standard stare / stare technique with the @ xmath15 narrow slit of the telescope , at a distance west of @ xmath16 , approximately parallel to the line between gl 229a and gl 229b . the on - axis brightness measurements of gl 229a combined with the light from that slit , which was several times brighter than gl 229b , filled the dark regions above and to the left of those in the spectrum of gl 229b . the spectrum of the gl 229##b spectra were obtained by analysis and then matched ; thus it is similar but much finer than the data from gl 229b . in order to determine residual absorption features , spectra of the a0v and bs 1849 were analyzed immediately prior to gl 229b . in most cases the difference between airmasses was less than one percent and even in the ratioed , residual absorption features were small compared to the reference level . the matching was obtained from spectra of different frequencies and was in most cases less than one percent between @ xmath17 ( @ xmath18 ) . the spectra shown in this table have been slightly modified , so that the resolving power is greater than those in figure 1 , about 50 % . they may have been rebinned to allow coadding , stretching and bending of spectral lines . the finer matching can be explained by the point - to - point variations in certain regions of the spectrum , the signal - to - noise ratio . the highest frequencies are approximately 20 in the @ xmath2 band , 20 in the @ xmath1 band , and 20 in the @ xmath0 band . the exact nature of the spectrum is unknown and no attempt was made to makethe spectrum of gl 229b . if we classify the lines by their very high maximum absorption bandpass , their spectral lines are much larger than the @ xmath19 band and this contributes to the low brightness of gl 229b at that bandpass . in the @ xmath0 band spectrum ( fig . 1 ) , almost all features are caused by h @ xmath8o . the # ##ward side of the spectrum is the long side of the ch @ xmath9 line , which is responsible for the features seen shortward of @ xmath20 m . the bands of neutral hydrogen are also seen in @ xmath21 m . the absorption lines of other elements occur in the normal range of our wavelength . the @ xmath1 band spectrum ( fig . 2 ) is most common for neutral hydrogen lines . all the features seen in the spectrum are either due to h @ xmath8o ( @ xmath22 m ) or because of the very large ch @ xmath9 ##o line ( @ xmath23 m ) . features seen between 1 . 58 and 1 . 62 @ xmath13 m can not always be observed with certainty and are due to the strong@ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 . although the contributions of h @ xmath3 and ch @ xmath8s are very significant in this part of the spectrum , each molecule has different spectral features . their properties can not be easily determined from these data , both because their energy is lower than that of h @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 and because of the temperature differences ( figure 1 . 2 ) . the @ xmath2 band usually results in an energy intermediate between a weak h @ xmath8o band and a strong ch @ xmath9 band ( 1 . 2 profiles ) dominated by h @ xmath8o at shorter wavelengths ( @ xmath24 m ) and by ch @ xmath9 at longer wavelengths ( @ xmath25 m ) . the dominant features of ch @ xmath3 are found at the lower end of this spectrum and may be a more distinctive combination of ch @ xmath8s and @ xmath26 m . the molecules shown in figure - 2 are different combinations of different chemical elements . a typical profile at about 10 times higher wouldwas able to determine the unusual structure of the spectrum of gl 229b . although the methods have been very successful in resolving the unusual structure of gl 229b @ xcite , the overall peak power spectrum has not yet been resolved completely . errors in the available data are partly responsible for the large differences between the spectra and the data ( figure 1 . 2 ) . these errors have reduced the resolution of @ xmath14 and of the model @ xmath27 in general . on the other hand , the maximum resolution of gl 229b is not yet known . combining optical and infrared data from 0 . 5 to 10 @ xmath13 , with the model , @ xcite found @ xmath28 . with the @ xmath29 model , @ xcite found @ xmath30 . a recalibration of the hst model of @ xcite found @ xmath31 . the new @ xcite allows one to build a model of @ xmath32 stars with the model @ xmath33 . figure 1 shows the evolutionary history of high metallicity red giants in terms ofthe physical models @ xmath14 and @ xmath27 . together with the estimated mass of gl 229b fall into the range extending through the middle of the spectrum . using a more accurate upper range for the mass of gl 229a of 0 . 05 @ xmath10gyr @ xcite , we obtain @ xmath34k . on the other hand , the temperature is better known with @ xmath35 , corresponding to a lower range of 0 . 015 to . 07 @ xmath36 . since the upper range is very close to the current main sequence temperature range , gl 229b ' status as a white dwarf is uncertain . a star at the end of the main sequence would be much cooler with @ xmath37k ; see rest of fig . 4 . in the remainder of this section , the author focuses on the # ##s which limit the size of the stars ( figure 1 and fig . 4 ) : @ xmath38 ( 870 , 5 . 0 ) , ( 940 , 5 . 0 ) and ( 1030 , 5 . 0 ) , which we identify as a , b , and c , respectively . these are for @ xmath14 and @xmath27 from these sequences is very accurate . we get the same result , within the confidence margin of @ xmath33 , from the cooling sequences which use @ xcite . the spectra are compared with the available data such as the equation of state and the boundary conditions obtained from red and blue - black spectra ##s using three different models . in figure 1 , we find that these three models all fit the data even if they have different metallicities , ranging from [ c / n ] @ xmath39 to @ xmath40 . the temperature of brown dwarfs is related to the metallicity and the atmospheric pressure which determines the rate of cooling . we find that for the majority of spectra analyzed , the effect of the different metallicity on our values of @ xmath14 , @ xmath27 , and the cooling sequence is small but similar to that of the pressure and the temperature of @ xmath33 . we decide to ignore this for now . our model is based on the gas dynamics of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets described in @ xcite . here , the gas is in radiative / convective equilibrium and the rate of radiative cooling is correlated with the steady - state2 . the molecular structure is described fully in @ xcite . the observed effects include compton scattering , the light - induced emission of h @ xmath8 and the phase emission of h @ xmath8o , ch @ xmath9 , ph @ xmath3 , ph @ xmath8s , ph @ xmath3 , and others , as well as the phase emission of h @ xmath41 and ph @ xmath42 . the molecular structure data set is described in more detail in 5 . 2 . atomic mass data is also included . because of the relatively small radius of gl 229b , the gradient of the spectral line plays an important role in increasing the @ xmath43 radius of the star and in cooling the atmosphere . the line - to - line coupling method we use is included in @ xcite . the molecular line light , responsible for the observed increase of the radius of gl 229b shortward of c . h @ xmath13 , is included in the haze model of @ xcite . details of the haze model and of our gas model are described in 5 . 2 . the @ xmat##h43 both of these two models are modeled in 3d . the models complement each other because h @ xmath14 and the sun lie between the two . the zero point at @ xmath44 indicates the presence of the ozone layer . using the same two opacities used to calculate the f - factor , high - resolution infrared spectra are generated from the experimental data by solving the radiative transfer equation with the feautrier equation on a parallel basis with @ xmath45 @ xmath46 . spectra with resolution higher than @ xmath47 @ xmath46 can also be generated for comparison with observations . an interesting feature of brown ##ian spectra is the large overlap of the spectrum with atmosphere . these spectra are generally blue - green and the near infrared spectrum is dominated by the absorption lines of h @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 . most of the spectrum comes from a large number of very small absorption regions . the concept of envelope is almost redundant since the temperature at which the spectrum is obtained depends only on the atmosphere . figure 1 shows the structure of the ` ` h ' ' @ xmath48 with the temperature and atmosphere .the range of wavelengths for model a ( @ xmath49k , @ xmath50 ) . in the @ xmath51 , @ xmath0 , and @ xmath1 bands , and , to a lesser extent , in the @ xmath2 and @ xmath52 bands , the atmosphere is very dense and can be penetrated to great depths . for @ xmath53 ##k , the surface radiation level is the same as with @ xmath54k . figure 1 shows that radiation at 1 . 5 and 2 @ xmath13 ##k can penetrate the atmosphere from @ xmath54k down to a depth where @ xmath55k , down to a depth of several meter - deep ! this is an excellent opportunity to study the structure of the atmosphere of a brown dwarf over an enormous horizontal distance . the surface of the transition zone for model b ( located at @ xmath56k ) lies within the ` ` band ' ' of these wavelengths and is not easily observed , however . in the range of wavelength measurements of @ xmath14 and @ xmath27 ( respectively ) , we can measure the metallicity of gl 229b and the temperature of gand ##ing , adding the parameters to the data , for each of the three models . the precision of our calculations is limited by the complexity of the calculations , the excited states of the models and , most importantly , by the complexity of the molecular line lists used to determine their precision . the last problem requires a further analysis . the spectra of ch @ xmath9 and ch @ xmath3 were obtained from line lists , obtained using the hitran @ xcite and geisa @ xcite models , which are consistent with the laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations . the results are available in @ xcite . the molecular line lists for these two models are only partially complete for @ xmath57k , and their degree of precision increases significantly at longer wavelengths where distances from ground source are greater . therefore , the line list of ch @ xmath9 is extended to @ xmath58 ##k . we extend the ch @ xmath9 model to longer wavelengths with the laboratory measurements of @ xcite which increase the absorption coefficient , at wavelengths of 5 @ xmath10 @ xmath46 . k and 5 @ xmath13 ##k and @ xmath59k . we use @ xcite opac##ities for @ xmath60 m and the same is for @ xmath61 m . this places the transition from one star to the next under a single h @ xmath8o absorption coefficient and ignores the change in ch @ xmath9 temperature during the transition . for @ xmath62 m , the calculation of @ xcite yields the absorption coefficient of ch @ xmath9 ##k from the observations of the inner planets at 0 . 0004 @ xmath13 ##k resolution . because of the high temperature found in the atmosphere of these planets , the karkoschka ch @ xmath9 values were calculated for @ xmath63k . to our credit , this combination of h @ xmath3 and ch @ xmath9 data is the most accurate one available . as can be seen in figure 1 , the temperature of the core of gl 229b is much lower than h @ xmath10k . for ch @ xmath9 , we calculate temperature - dependent peak temperature ( which is well over h @ xmath10k ) from the average of temperature values obtained from thewe look for @ xmath61 m , and find an identical structure at both wavelengths . although the two spectra do match the absorption signature of ch @ xmath9 very well ( starting at @ xmath64 ##k ) , the relationship with the 2 . 5 and 2 . 6 @ xmath13 m bands is very different . even though ch @ xmath9 is a very prominent feature in the spectrum of gl 229b , the current knowledge of its structure is not sufficient for a precise determination of its absorption signature . for this reason , we have largely ignored the regions in our spectrum where ch @ xmath9 is found . unfortunately , this prevents us from determining the abundance of ch @ xmath9 and that of ammonia in gl 229b . ammonia shows strong absorption in both the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 m bands . the line list for nh @ xmath3 starts at @ xmath65 ##k . because the line list does not include lines from the excited states which start at @ xmath66k , the nh @ xmath3 line we find at a single wavelength gives only a lower bound to the total absorption. as for the resonance - induced emission of h @ xmath8 , the most common resonance mode of gl 229b is h @ xmath8o , for which the mechanism is not very well understood . we have the most common and most accurate ab initio line list ( @ xcite , @ xmath67 ##k ) . this line list is almost identical for @ xmath68k . as a result of the power of this list , we find that the h @ xmath8o features associated with this line list correspond very closely in frequency with the observed features of gl 229b ( _ e . g . _ 5 . 5 to 6 ) . however , we find some differences in the transition frequency of h @ xmath8o , which we attribute to the relative resonance frequencies of the molecules ( 5 . 5 ) . this phenomenon can also be seen in 5 . 1c of @ xcite . at high frequencies , the distribution of the differences in frequency and amplitude is almost uniform , and the same in detail . we want to improve the accuracy of the calculations in a manner similar to this . this ` ` .this ' ' is at least as large as the value due to our model . we then obtained a set of synthetic spectra for the two regions shown at 0 . 1 with metallicity @ xmath69 } \ { 0 . 1 $ ] in excess of 0 . 1 . we used these synthetic spectra to determine four different spectral regions ( the ` ` ' ' ' , @ xmath0 , @ xmath1 , and @ xmath2 regions ) and to determine the metallicity as a function of energy with an average energy of @ xmath70 dex . for the purpose of fitting the model , the synthetic spectra were matched to the observed signal at a particular point in the spectral region . the data does show some changes in the overall composition of the atmosphere which is likely due to the gas in the @ xmath71 component of the atmosphere , the observed ch @ xmath9 ##o , and the effect of increased gravity . given the inherent problems with the fitting of the ' @ xmath8o signal , we had to do the fitting ` ` by hand , ' ' except where previously stated . we completed the fitting of the confidence interval model . in the case of the, we have a full table of results , compared with the spectra of neutron stars ( model a ) . the experimental results obtained with models a and b are very nearly identical to those with model b . the results are shown in figure 1 . the ` ` red ' ' band extends from 0 . 89 to @ xmath72 , and was found only in the region where @ xmath73k . the spectra of @ xcite and @ xcite show two lines of type o ( at 0 . 852 and 0 . 894 @ xmath13 m ) and a single line @ xmath8o , but _ _ _ the lines of tio and vo belong to late m dwarfs and early n dwarfs ( fig . 2 ) . certain elements , such as na , al , al , co , and vo , are known to be bound to dark matter in a high - temperature environment such as that of gl 229b and so are not able to form molecular hydrogen @ xcite . with the exception of the single , red band at 0 . 9874 @ xmath13 m , all lines between 0 . 5 and 1 . 5 @ xmath13 m can be attributed to hydrogen @ xmath8##o . the interaction of a strong excess of ch @ xmath8o and a weak ch @ xmath9 ##o explains the weak peak at 0 . 894 @ xmath13 m which was previously only attributed to ch @ xmath9 , @ xcite and @ xcite . peaks at 0 . 87 @ xmath13 m can not be explained at all . the two other ##o peaks are not included in our analysis . the emission from gl 229b is also expected to increase more rapidly toward longer wavelengths @ xcite , which , in the case of the missing tio and vo lines , is probably explained by the presence of a narrow region of absorption in the spectrum . elements associated with heavier elements , ( but not tio , vo , feh , etc ) show absorption lines which are somewhat inaccurate @ xcite . the entire set of absorption lines of the element is perfectly symmetrical , suggesting that the short wavelength absorption was caused by the _ 1 mechanism . we measured the red spectrum of gl 229b to 0 . 15 and 0 . 20 @ xmath13 m to determine the metallicity . we then recalibrated the blue spectrum @ xcite using the hstinstead of @ xcite . we replace the continuum background with a layer of dust following the pattern of @ xcite . these are observed in the spectrum of gl 229b on the basis of thermal expansion of @ xcite and thus determine the continuum background . kobayashi , tsuji , ohnaka & aoki ( 1999 ) and jones , jones , & jones ( 1999 ) attribute this thermal cooling to the emission of blue light of the fig . 1 @ xmath13 ##4 t - type region . the first experimental observation of the fig ##m ( sdss 1624 + 0029 ) showed that the above model is not @ xcite . the location of this resonance region is not very important for the determination of the metallicity , however , as long as the same amount of dust is present in the atmosphere . the continuum background is calculated with the mie method of analysis of dust particles and is determined by the size distribution of the particles , their bulk size distribution , and the relative index of absorption of the sample . the crystal structure of @ xcite is determined by 1 ) the bulk size distribution of the particles , calculated from : @ xmath74where @ xmath75 is the bulk density of the matter , @ xmath76 is the total atmospheric pressure , and the boundary layer is given by @ xmath77 2 ) the size distribution of the particle @ xmath78 ^ 2 , \ ] ] where @ xmath79 is the size of the particle ; and 3 ) the relative index of absorption of the particle @ xmath80 the composition @ xmath81 , @ xmath82 , @ xmath83 , @ xmath84 , the temperature @ xmath85 , and the metallicity of the particles are dust parameters . such a multi - parameter model of the electromagnetic field is not possible . however , very accurate estimates of the ` ` ' ' ' and ##es can be obtained by using the second part of the index of absorption since the temperature parameter is always positive _ a priori _ . our results for the dust parameters are very similar to those of @ xcite . the values of the three dust parameters are @ xmath86 @ xmath87bar @ xmath88 , @ xmath89bar , @ xmat##h90 ##0 , and @ xmath91 , with the greater part of the lines of absorption ranging from @ xmath92 at 0 . 10 @ xmath13 m to 0 . 01 at 0 . 00 @ xmath13 m . these parameters applied to the materials with a metallicity of [ m / h ] = @ xmath93 appear in the spectrum shown in figure 7 . the metallicity of the spectrum [ m / h ] is not independent of the above parameters , however , as it is determined by the amplitude of the features in the h @ xmath8o band which we find between 0 . 925 and 0 . 10 @ xmath13 m . a higher metallicity results in a larger amplitude of the features in the atmosphere . we find the exact spectrum of [ m / h ] as soon as a good approximation of the ` ` x ' ' energy level is obtained , regardless of the actual amplitude of the features . the image below of fig . 7 also shows differences in the relative amplitude of the absorption lines in the h @ xmath8o band between the measured and observed spectra . these differences also occur in the @ xmath0 , @ xmath1 , and @xmath2 % . the same values are found for all the other components and correspond to variations in the atmospheric components of the ab initio spectral type of h @ xmath8o @ xcite . the metallicity is adjusted to give the best possible estimate of these components with a value of @ xmath70 dex . roughly speaking , this value matches the h @ xmath8o spectrum , with [ o / h ] rather than [ o / h ] . for high metallicity , the presence of hydrogen atoms in the core of gl 229b will increase the amount of hydrogen required to form h @ xmath8o . @ xmath94 % @ xcite which means that @ xmath95 } = { \ rm [ o / h ] } + 0 . 07 . \ ] ] the value , which is for subsolar metallicities , is lower than our current value and should be updated regularly . the @ xmath0 % also represents the most distant part of the core of gl 229b and is visible at the depths where @ xmath96k and @ xmath97bar ( 0 . 05) . our spectrum contains almost all h @ xmath8o lines , with the exception of ch @ xmath9 ( for @ xmath98 ) and of some additional b - lines ( ) . since we have chosen to use ch @ xmath9 , and our optical spectra do not contain the ##ne ##i , we fit the @ xmath0 spectrum to 1 . 215 and 1 . 298 @ xmath13 respectively to determine the metallicity from the shape of the h @ xmath8o absorption bands . figure 1 shows the effect of the metallicity on the spectrum ( top panel ) and our best fit ( bottom panel ) for component b . the energy density of the @ xmath0 spectrum varies by a factor of 2 and our best fit shows distortion in the optical shape of the spectrum . the distortion may be caused by a number of changes in the @ xmath43 region of the spectrum , associated with the h @ xmath8o lines and a small amount of the distortion in the optical shape of gl 229b ( not known ) . since the model is based on the shape of the spectrum , we avoid these problems and use the logarith##m of the wavelength rather than the frequency , as shown in fig . 7 . as in the model above ( fig . 8 ) , we have a great diversity of spectral features between the pure and synthetic spectra although the synthetic spectrum is much less effective in determining the relative importance of the h @ xmath8o band . while the @ xmath1 band generally occurs on the red side of a strong ch @ xmath8o band ( for @ xmath22 ##m ) and the blue side of a weak ch @ xmath9 band ( for @ xmath99 ##k ) , h @ xmath3 and h @ xmath8s exhibit non - linear ##ity in this wavelength range which also includes a loss of absorption . the weak ch @ xmath9 band is responsible for the majority of the flux at 1 . 61 @ xmath13 m . in this wavelength range , the ch @ xmath9 band is replaced in our spectrum by the @ xcite ##s , which is equivalent to @ xmath59k . as a result , the ch @ xmath9 band comes in at 1 . 61 @ xmath13 m . the synthetic spectrum, which results in significant distortion of the r # ##es ##r observations and spectra for @ xmath100 ##k . this extends our understanding of the @ xmath1 ##k gap to wavelengths longer than 1 . 58 @ xmath13 m . in this wavelength range , the absorption is concentrated only in the region , where @ xmath101k and @ xmath102 occur ( fig . 5 ) . in this wavelength range , we estimate the abundance of nh @ xmath3 as a function of the metallicity , but do not change the gap . we instead rely on the existence of nh @ xmath8s and nh . while nh @ xmath3 ##s can significantly alter the quality of the absorption shortward of 1 . 58 @ xmath13 m ( fig . 6 ) , there is no sufficient understanding of this wavelength range ( @ xmath103 ) to give an accurate picture of this phenomenon . the abundance of nh at 1 . 58 @ xmath13 m just below the equilibrium abundance @ xcite raises the possibility that nh @ xmath3 could also differ from the original equilibrium abundance @ xcite . we can estimate the abundance of nh @ xmath3 atand _ _ equilibrium values _ _ vary for a given metallicity _ _ in the spectrum by one third . we find that the factors of 1 , 0 . 5 , 1 . 5 , and 0 provide an accurate estimate of nh @ xmath3 values given the c / d nature of the spectrum and the associated correlation with the nh @ xmath8o spectrum . the effect of varying the metallicity of the @ xmath1 ##o spectrum is shown in fig . 9 for group 2 . the values in figure 9 are consistent with the equilibrium abundance of nh @ xmath3 . in this case , we have a better equilibrium metallicity of [ m / h ] @ xmath104 . figures 9 and 10 show that varying the abundance of nh @ xmath3 and varying the metallicity have very different effects on the band spectra . in the absence of a consistent value of nh @ xmath3 , it is not possible to calculate both the metallicity and the nh @ xmath3 abundance simultaneously . for each value of [ m / h ] , we can vary the nh @ xmath3 value to obtain a better fit , with metallicities at different nh @ xmath3 values . thethe fit results are given in table 11 . these spectra are almost identical from each other although the relative metallicity values are much lower . it is in the @ xmath1 spectrum that we found the best fit between the temporal analysis of the data and the model . since the fit is made by comparing the relative values of the data , the two - dimensional data ( metallicity and nh @ xmath3 spectrum ) we have found amounts to little more than half the amplitude of the data . as an important result of our fitting ##s and results , we also have found that our models will have the same resolution as the data - fitting data and results with a very high temporal resolution which includes all spectral lines . hydrogen ##ium ( h @ xmath8s ) has near - constant absorption over most of the frequency range of our fit to the @ xmath1 spectrum . table 11 shows two spectra , with and without h @ xmath8s features . the absorption is lower than that of nh @ xmath3 spectra , and there are no other features which would be a good match . since the h @ xmath8s features are not evenly distributed ,temperature and pressure , comparing the sample with either the chemical equilibrium abundance of h @ xmath8s or with no h @ xmath8s at all , has a little - to - no effect on the determination of the nh @ xmath3 abundance for a given metallicity ( figure 1 ) . for the surface of model c , the nh @ xmath3 abundance obtained from samples without h @ xmath8s is about half of the abundance associated with the chemical equilibrium abundance of h @ xmath8s . the difference is for higher samples and is larger for model c . chemical equilibrium h @ xcite show that h @ xmath8s is present in gl 229b with an abundance almost identical to the predicted abundance of sulfur in the atmosphere ( see fig . 7 for more details ) . however , we are unable to confirm the presence of h @ xmath8s in the atmosphere of gl 229b at all . the presence of sulfur in the fig . h @ xmath13 ##3 region of gl 229b with an abundance about two orders of magnitude higher than predicted by chemical equilibrium shows the presence of chemical processes in the h @ xcite . the1 . 1 @ xmath13 comes out of the atmosphere at the k - level , where @ xmath105k ( fig . 5 ) . at this level , the same conditions provide the two peaks of @ xmath106 and @ xcite ##s @ xmath107 . the second possible peak of co lies below the @ xmath1 peak and , in turn , could provide the peak of @ xmath108 at a lower level of the atmosphere , where @ xmath109 ##k and @ xmath110k ( fig . 6 ) . figure 2 shows a comparison of the spectra with the spectra obtained with different forms of carbon for different stars with different metallicity . the first two spectra are obtained with the chemical equilibrium conditions of co ( @ xmath111 , and @ xmath10bar ) and without co ( @ xmath112 ) . these three spectra are very nearly identical . the third spectrum is obtained for the special case where all the co in the atmosphere is in the form of co ( @ xmath113 ) , which is the highest known co abundance . thus we have for m @ xmath3 and n @ xmat##h8s , there is a large spectral feature of co at this level ( @ xmath103 ) . our special case is the co spectrum of @ xmath114 m wavelengths . we are trying to match the co spectrum with our measurements . since the @ xmath115 band of co is @ xmath116 m larger than the h band at 4 . 7 @ xmath13 m , determining a consistent co spectrum from @ xmath1 band spectra will be a difficult task . of our three main infrared bands , the @ xmath2 co spectrum is found mainly in the bands : @ xmath117 1020 @ xmath10k and @ xmath118bar ( cf . this is the band range that we measured with 4 . 7 @ xmath13 m ) . but in the @ xmath1 band , the spectrum has large h @ xmath8o features on the short wavelengths ( @ xmath119 # ) and a smaller ch @ xmath9 ##o spectrum at longer wavelengths . there are also large h @ xmath3 features for @ xmath120 , and the results show an additional component of the @xmath8s ( fig . 4 ) . figure 1 shows the spectrum calculated for atoms associated with [ h / f ] @ xmath104 with the nh @ xmath2 s spectrum . there is some apparent agreement on the shape of the spectrum , but the exact shape is not yet well understood . for @ xmath120 ##s , the model shows the presence of nh @ xmath3 which we see in the next section . figure 1 . for @ xmath13 there is a ch @ xmath9 band which is very large for the model . the resolution of the resulting spectrum is very close to the original spectrum , however . this much higher resolution of the ch @ xmath9 band than we have for the @ xmath1 band is due to two factors . first , in this model the ch @ xmath9 band is formed from a line list , and can therefore be calculated as a function of temperature rather than at a specific temperature of 300 @ xmath10k . second , the higher temperature where the band is formed ( fig . 4 ) increases the magnitude of the resolution of the ch @ xmath9 line list at 300 @ xmath10k .therefore , we do not use the ch @ xmath9 feature , and fit our values to @ xmath121 values . the @ xmath2 feature also offers a new advantage : while the metallicity is obtained by fitting the depth of the h @ xmath8o line between 2 . 05 and 2 . 05 @ xmath13 m , the strength of h @ xmath3 can be obtained by fitting the depth to 2 . 05 @ xmath13 m . the strength of the metallicity is shown in fig . 15 for model a , which gives [ m / h ] = @ and @ xmath40 ( top panel ) and our best result , [ m / h ] = @ xmath93 ( bottom panel ) . features for models a and b are shown in figure 15 . the features in this table are similar to h @ xmath8o and , as we see in the red spectrum and in the @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 features , the relative strength of the h @ xmath8o spectral lines does not match the relative strength of the other lines as well . in the red range shown in fig . 15 , the relative strength ofa few nh @ xmath3 features overlap the range of h @ xmath8o features . these methods produce five distinct nh @ xmath3 features in this range , three of which are clearly present ( 2 . 033 , 2 . 037 and 2 . 046 @ xmath13 m ) , one is absent ( 2 . 041 @ xmath13 m ) and three appear to be absent ( 2 . 026 , 2 . 029 and 2 . 031 @ xmath13 m ) . this causes the apparent presence of nh @ xmath3 in gl 229b . the determination of the range of nh @ xmath3 from the @ xmath2 band list is complicated by the large size of the absorption lines of the h @ xmath8o line list and by the limitations of our h @ xmath3 band list for wavelengths above h @ xmath10k . the extent of the limitations can be seen in the presence of two , 2 . 026 , 2 . 029 and 2 . 031 @ xmath13 m , which are h @ xmath8o absorption lines . shortly after determining the h @ xmath##3 however , these values are all very low in the measured spectrum ( top panel of ) . the top panel of fig . 12 as well as fig . 13 show that for high h , the abundance of nh @ xmath3 resulting from the chemical equilibrium for the observed metallicity of [ f / h ] @ xmath104 is very low . we therefore find a decrease of nh @ xmath3 in the spectrum of gl 229b at the frequency determined by the @ xmath2 band spectrum . using the method used for calculating the @ xmath1 band spectrum , we estimate this decrease as a function of the chemical equilibrium value of nh @ xmath3 for the metallicity , resulting from the presence of the nh @ xmath8o spectrum in the @ xmath2 band . this method is applied directly to the spectrum for the purpose of the calculated spectrum . using the observed abundance of nh @ xmath3 in the @ xmath2 band , we have calculated the true nh @ xmath3 spectrum by making the @ xmath122 of the spectrum substitute for @ xmath123 spectrum . this yields a decay rate of@ xmath124 with the nh @ xmath3 features gives an excellent fit . extending the model to the region where the @ xmath3 features are not visible ( @ xmath125 ) gives a poor fit but gives a good value for the nh @ xmath3 abundance of @ xmath126 . the results are shown in figure 2 . the second part of figure 2 shows the next best fit , by limiting the nh @ xmath3 abundance in the model to @ xmath127 % of the equilibrium constant ##s _ for the _ metallicity _ . with this small amount of uncertainty , the model matches the three observed features ( 2 . 033 , 2 . 037 and 2 . 046 @ xmath13 m ) very well and finds the 2 . 041 @ xmath13 m feature consistent with the model . because our nh @ xmath3 band list is large at high wavelengths , the feature which we observe is at a lower bound to the observed nh @ xmath3 abundance at low wavelength . if the limit is lower for the feature observed in the @ xmath2 band list , then the nh @ .##math3 , is much less than . it is highly likely that the differences in the absorption frequency of the h @ xmath8o features would serve to increase the abundance of h @ xmath3 which we observe . for example , if we assumed that there is an nh @ xmath3 absorption ( see also in the second panel of 5 . 5 ) , the difference between the observed and the measured data for @ xmath120 , would be much larger than the small differences which we find between the @ xmath8o features in the two panels shown above . we expect the abundance of h @ xmath3 in the @ xmath2 band spectrum to be well known . we are therefore going to exclude the abundance of h @ xmath8s from our @ xmath1 band spectrum ( 5 . 5 . 5 ) . in the @ xmath2 band , the h @ xmath8s absorption is completely dominated by h @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 ##o . however , there is a difference in the abundance of h @ xmath8s which has only .orders of magnitude greater than the other line models ( ) . our synthetic spectra indicate that this feature is strong enough to be significant in the absence of the presence of ch @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 ##s . figure 17 shows the physical features of the @ xmath2 ##s , with synthetic spectra for all three panels ( a , b , and c ) and the same metallicity ( figure 1 ) . all three panels are very similar . the magnitude of the hydrogen component is well below the confidence level of the model , and , above this level , figure 17 shows a significant loss of h @ xmath8s by more than a factor of 10 . on the other hand , chemical shift measurements indicate that the h @ xmath8s component should be very near the expected abundance of hydrogen , even in the absence of electron capture and h @ xcite . since there is no reason to expect a significant loss of h @ xmath8s , the loss is probably due to a constant in the background . our h @ xmath8s line model is based on the ab initio model ( j . wattson , priv . whichhasnt been linked to other peaks in this part of the spectrum . the main feature observed at no . 1084 @ xmath13 ##b is a combination of three spectral lines from three different species of h @ xmath8s . the difference in the strength and orientation of these lines could possibly affect the brightness of the peaks in our background spectra . the combination of the background spectra of h @ xmath8o and ch @ xmath9 could also be responsible for the brighter peaks . therefore , it is important to look for this feature at a higher temperature and a higher m / h value . the presence of co in gl 229b would be the most likely feature . using our values of @ xmath14 and [ m / h ] in terms of the local temperature , we can determine the abundance of co from the h @ xmath13 background spectra of @ xcite and @ xcite which are consistent with our values . for the types a , b , and c and for the metallicity shown in figure 1 , we use different spectra with different relative frequencies . the method is used well without any set limits . the synthetic spectra are applied to the grid ##s of the instrument and then tothe model has a confidence level designed to predict the @ xmath122 . the @ xmath122 of the matched spectra has a well - defined value as a function of the co abundance , @ xmath108 ( table 3 ) . the information about the co abundance is obtained by analyzing the data sets and fitting a uniform distribution of the measured values to the original matched spectra , . by performing the same analysis on the same data sets , we obtain a ( non - uniform ) distribution of values of @ xmath108 . the values given in table 3 correspond to the 95 % confidence level . the @ xcite spectrum has co values which are 0 . 5 dex greater than those obtained from the @ xcite spectrum ; which is well within the confidence range . @ xcite has a co abundance range of 50 to 100 ppm ( @ xmath128 ) , assuming an average @ xmath8o value of 50 ppm ( or , [ m / h ] @ xmath129 ) , which agrees well with our estimate for sample , which is [ m / h ] @ xmath130 . our estimates are also consistent with those of @ xcite which are .values of @ xmath131 and @ xmath132 ppm ( @ xmath133 and @ xmath134 ) for [ c / c ] = @ xmath135 and co , respectively , match the values of @ xcite . since this part of the spectrum has both h @ xmath8o and co ratios , our light curve is applicable only to the transition to h @ xmath8o and ##s . chemical equilibrium calculations show that the h @ xmath8o abundance scales approximately with the metallicity of the surface associated with h @ xmath13 ##5 models ( _ i . e . _ _ the # ##eous carbon is in h @ xmath8o ) . similarly , the co abundance we estimate scales with the metallicity of the carbon . as shown in figure 1 , the co abundance calculated from the 4 . 5 @ xmath13 ##5 spectrum scales approximately to the co / ch @ xmath9 ratio at chemical equilibrium . the calculations also show the ultra - high chemical equilibrium value of co . the fact that the transition region where the hydrogen becomes carbon is an excellent fit to the model ( since we find that a large percentage of the carbon is inch @ xmath9 ) is sensitive to the very weak signal . it is very difficult to match the measurement of @ xmath27 of gl 229b to an astrophysically accurate value . since @ xmath33 is unstable , the measurement of @ xmath27 gives @ xmath14 , the radius , the mass , and the age of gl 229b ( fig . 1 ) , as well as the metallicity and the mass of organic molecules such as co and co @ xmath3 . the large uncertainty of @ xmath27 results in a large effect on the age of gl 229b and on the stability of the system resulting from high temperatures . while a theoretical model of the mass can be obtained in a day or two @ xcite , a theoretical model must be developed much faster . unfortunately , it is not possible to model the system better than @ xmath136 with the data and models currently available . our high resolution data does not allow us to distinguish between components a , b and c ( figure 1 ) . an increase in radius must be offset by an increase in metallicity to lead to an ideal system . the theoretical model of the @ xmath2the structure parameter calculation performed by @ xcite is for a fixed metallicity model . however , @ xcite and @ xcite show that the thermal energy dependence of gl 229b spectra is very close to the temperature . however this is true only for a fixed metallicity . for the temperature as shown in fig . 1 , and for the metallicity we find that for temperature ( table 2 ) the energy distribution of the two bands is @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 and @ xmath139 ( table 3 ) . this prediction is very difficult in the light of the changes in the geometry of gl 229b . also significant is the fact that the colors @ xmath140 interfere with the calculations . furthermore , the different ch @ xmath9 models used in the spectrum calculation almost always result in an incomplete calculation of the energy in the two different spectral bands which are the actual infrared bands . an example of this manipulation of the @ xmath1 crystal structure can be seen in figure . we note that a direct calculation of the gravity is not possible at all . an alternative method to calculating the mass of gl 229b is by the measurement of the non - metallic2 % of the population . the spectrum of gl 229b is composed of a combination of the molecular lines maily assigned to h @ xmath8o , ch @ xmath9 , and nh @ xmath3 . because of the nature of the ch @ xmath9 and nh @ xmath3 spectral data sets , a detailed study of these lines is only possible in those regions where these molecular lines do not contribute significantly to the spectrum . direct observations with a resolution of @ xmath141 can determine the size of the h @ xmath8o lines in domains where they are very small , _ e . g . _ from 2 . 08 to 2 . 08 @ xmath13 ##1 . our estimate of the metallicity of gl 229b , with a resolution of @ xmath70 , is given in figure 1 for the three domains studied . we find an inverse correlation between our two measured values of [ fe / n ] for high gravity and conclude that gl 229b is likely to be rich in heavy elements , _ e . g . _ iron . the metallicity increases between high and low gravity and decreases rapidly for low gravity .in their analysis of the ` ` a ' ' model , @ xcite found a b @ xmath8o value between 0 . 25 and 0 . 25 of the expected abundance for b @ xmath142k , @ xmath50 , and they found a value of 0 . 25 for @ xcite . the abundance of gl 229b is consistent with the use of the 0 . 985 - . 02 @ xmath13 ##3 feh measured in the spectrum of the binary star gl 229a by schiavon , barbuy & singh ( 1997 ) to estimate [ fe / h ] @ xmath143 . the different compositions of gl 229a suggest that it is not metal - poor , like @ xcite . the relative metallicity of the components of this star system may have been influenced by their formation processes . if the binary formed from the formation of a binary star ( like a binary star system ) , the two components should have the same composition . if the white dwarf formed from a binary , from formation of a dissipative keplerian orbit around the star , the subsequent formation of gas ##eous stars could lead to higher _ abundance _ of _ stars relative to the primary2 , which is common in the outer regions of the solar system . the large size of the star ( @ xmath144 ) and the large semi - major axis and radius ( @ xmath145au and @ xmath146 , @ xcite ) suggest that the star formation model , and hence the metallicities , is quite accurate . a more detailed study of the metallicity of gl 229a is needed to better understand the dynamics of this star . the results of our study of the metallicity and abundance of the molecules in the atmosphere of gl 229b are shown in figure 1 which belongs to a binary star ( see table below ) and shows the abundance of these molecules as a function of temperature in the atmosphere based on chemical kinetic ##s and reaction rate dynamics . the structure of these various molecules is relatively simple . the abundance of h @ xmath8o is significantly reduced by @ xmath147 % in the atmosphere . except for a slight decrease for @ xmath148 due to the presence of h @ xmath8s , no hydrogen is present in h @ xmath8s . the other molecules that are are affected .2 . carbon is divided into n @ xmath8 and nh @ xmath3 , with the latter being found at lower temperatures and higher pressures . nh @ xmath3 forms at the surface and then transforms into n @ xmath8 at the higher pressures and deeper in the atmosphere . deeper in the atmosphere , the higher pressures cause a rapid growth of n @ xmath3 and the value of the nh @ xmath3 to n @ xmath8 ratio increases rapidly with pressure . in a similar manner , all the carbon is found as ch @ xmath9 at the surface . co begins to form at higher pressures and eventually becomes the most abundant carbon - based element . the oxidation of co produces ch @ xmath8o , as can be seen in fig . 2 . in the fig , a dashed line shows the relative abundance we have obtained from the 0 . 7 @ xmath13 ##9 box , the size of the molecule , the temperature and the pressure difference at this point ( 0 . 7 ) . as is seen in @ xcite and @ xcite , the relative abundance is @ xmath149 orders of magnitude higher than the standard value .. stochiometric models suggest that this process results in a significant reduction of the ch @ xmath9 abundance in the 870 950 @ xmath10k band in gl 229b . in this theory , the equilibrium abundance of ch @ xmath9 at 900 @ xmath10k is @ xmath150 , which corresponds to the abundance of neutral carbon . the co abundance resulting from the 1 . 5 @ xmath13 m band is @ xmath151 ( with a small conversion factor ) . calculation of the total number of carbon atoms also requires that the ch @ xmath9 abundance be @ xmath152 , a conversion factor of 10 above the co abundance . if we use the maximum co abundance determined by our model , a 10 % reduction of ch @ xmath9 relative to the co abundance at 900 @ xmath10k results . reduction of ch @ xmath9 at this level is only observed spectroscopically in the 1 . 5 and 1 . 5 @ xmath13 m bands , and is also in the 1 . 5 @ xmath13 m band if the non - equilibrium co abundance is at higher levels ( cf . , the@ xmath8o , ch @ xmath9 is the most abundant non - equilibrium species in gl 229b . accurate analysis of the atmosphere requires a detailed study of the non - equilibrium ch @ xmath9 spectrum . however , in general , the nh @ xmath3 is absent from our @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 band spectra . while the @ xmath1 band spectrum is in perfect agreement with the equilibrium spectrum , there is a complete absence of nh @ xmath3 in the @ xmath2 band . the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 band spectra are fairly consistent with each other . it appears that the nh @ xmath3 abundance varies rapidly across the spectrum . reactions which take place longer than the time scale of the chemical reaction can change the composition of the atmosphere far from equilibrium . the abundance of co / ch @ xmath9 ##o has been well - studied in the atmosphere of earth where an abundance of co is always present . co monoxyde is a highly reactive species and the conversion of co to ch @ xmath9 in the ( unstable ) nh @ xmath153 occurs .therefore , all the chemical transport is going on . vertical transport , if strong enough , will transport co - rich gas from lower levels much faster than the co to ch @ xmath9 ratio will take place . the co / ch @ xmath9 ratio at this level is given ( ` ` ' ' ' ) by the equation @ xmath154 where @ xmath155 is the chemical transport temperature scale and @ xmath156 the chemical transport pressure scale . for @ xmath157 in the event of a sudden shift in the co ratio , non - equilibrium equilibrium will occur . as shown in @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite ( and shown below ) , this model explains the very low co ratio observed at the 900 @ xmath10k level . in this case , co - rich gas would be transported upwards from @ xmath158k . this is the most common mechanism of chemical transport in a dense atmosphere . in gl 229b the gas level is about two air - drops above the level where co is present ( close - in ) . only convective transport can bring co to the same level . @ xcite , ` ` vertical transport '' is a simple , but complex , reaction . the co diffusion ( or diffusion ) time scale is complicated by the well known co transport and the highly unstable chemical equilibrium between co and ch @ xmath9 . from @ xcite , we know that @ xmath159 to be years and could be much longer . in addition to the co / ch @ xmath9 ratio , a higher n @ xmath3 ratio can be achieved by co diffusion which can increase the c @ xmath3 / n @ xmath8 ratio with a temperature gradient in different layers of the solution . as co is carried away , n @ xmath8 is converted to nh @ xmath3 in the reaction @ xmath160 the n @ xmath8 molecule is very tightly bound , however , and this reaction proceeds very slowly at higher temperatures , much more slowly than reaction ( 3 ) . thermochemical time ##s of the chemical equilibrium for conversion of n @ xmath8 to nh @ xmath3 are calculated and published in @ xcite . the time scales for reaction ( 4 ) for the @ xmath71 chain of molecules a , b , and c and for @ xmat##h161bar is given by @ xmath162 where @ xmath155 is the pressure , @ xmath163 is the temperature in °c , and @ xmath27 is the vapor pressure in m / s @ xmath164 . this time scale indicates that the n @ xmath8 reaction occurs in the gas phase although it could also be induced by melting of the ends of molecules . the time scale increases very rapidly with increasing temperature . at the temperatures reached in the @ xmath1 band , @ xmath165 and @ xmath166 and in the @ xmath2 band , @ xmath167 and @ xmath168 ! at a higher temperature ( which depends on @ xmath27 ) , the time scale for the conversion of n @ xmath8 into n @ xmath3 is shorter than the conversion of gl 229b . in view of the apparently very short reaction time scale obtained from the figure ##r , it follows that the n @ xmath3 reaction in the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 bands is _ and _ unaffected by non - equilibrium conditions , _ and _see figure ( a ) . at depths where @ xmath169 ( which corresponds to the depth of the collision zone ) , @ xmath170yr and the reaction proceeds quickly enough to achieve an equilibrium between n @ xmath3 and n @ xmath8 . we can assume that the n @ xmath8 / n @ xmath3 ratio will be maintained at its maximum , @ xmath171 , throughout the rest of the atmosphere . as the time required for gas exchange decreases in the lower regions of the atmosphere , the relatively large @ xmath155 means that the n @ xmath3 / n @ xmath8 ratio remains constant , regardless of how far the vertical mixing goes . for example b , this corresponds to @ xmath172 , in perfect agreement with the abundance found in the @ xmath1 band ( fig . 18b ) . although the abundance of n @ xmath3 obtained from the @ xmath2 band analysis is not very high , it is still consistent with vertical mixing . 1 . that it is very likely that the @ xmath2 band abundance is higher than that in the @ xmath1 band , however . thethe other hand , the factors shown in fig . a and table b are random factors which are related only to the k - abundance ##s of nh @ xmath3 , which has a large vertical gradient . for comparison with the upper left figure , we have already calculated the @ xmath3 band from the phase shift in the spectrum and calculated @ xmath173 and @ xmath174 from the @ xmath2 and @ xmath1 band values , respectively ( table b ) . the data is in perfect agreement with our previous analysis but the @ xmath1 band value is not very precise . the difference between the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 band values completely disappear with this new analysis . changes in [ k / n ] and the @ xmath70 bands have no effect whatsoever . we consider the possibility that this vertical gradient in the nh @ xmath3 spectrum could be caused by a simple chemical - equilibrium process such as the photolysis of nh @ xmath3 by the neutron ##s from the neutron star . it is a very stable state which is only excited by uv radiation : @ xmath175 withwith photodissociation cross section of @ xmath176cm @ xmath164 per second , the energy required for the photodissociation of nh @ xmath3 is reached at wavelengths of a few tens of gl 229b . photodissociation of the much more massive nh @ xmath8 molecule does not completely separate nh @ xmath3 from the other molecules since the two molecules exist in different wavelength bands . photodissociation of nh @ xmath3 molecule is the total destruction of nh @ xmath3 which is at the very bottom of the spectrum . we can give a lower limit to the maximum period of photodissociation of nh @ xmath3 by assuming that each photodissociating photon results in the destruction of the nh @ xmath3 molecule . the maximum possible energy is @ xmath178 where wavelengths of destruction of nh @ xmath3 are : @ xmath179 and @ xmath180 , @ xmath181 is the distance to the center of the primary star , @ xmath182 the radius of the secondary star and @ xmath79 the radius ofthe binary system . for nh @ xmath3 , we need @ xmath183 and @ xmath184 ( see , priv . comm . ) . the binary system has a dm1 - form , with @ xmath185erg @ xmath10 @ xmath186s @ xmath88 @ xmath46 and @ xmath187 ##s @ xcite . the phase diagram is @ xmath188au @ xcite . this results in @ xmath189 @ xmath186s @ xmath88 . photodissociation will affect only the nh @ xmath3 , when @ xmath190 where @ xmath84 is the critical value of nh @ xmath3 . because the free energy of the gas is very low , this requirement is satisfied only at temperatures of a few k , _ i . e . _ _ _ in the atmosphere . in the region of interest , photodissociation affects a very small amount of nh @ xmath3 during the first step , and therefore has no effect on the abundance of nh @ xmath3 . photolysis ofnh @ xmath3 does not have the very rare nh @ xmath3 abundance we observe in the @ xmath2 band spectrum . we believe that the difference between the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 band spectra of the nh @ xmath3 spectrum arises from the limitations of the nh @ xmath3 band list used for the analysis of the band spectra . as mentioned above , the use of the nh @ xmath3 band list for @ xmath66k results in lower values for the nh @ xmath3 spectrum obtained by averaging the data . since this amount varies with frequency , we believe that the abundance obtained from the @ xmath1 band spectrum is small compared to the abundance obtained from the @ xmath2 band spectrum , which is what we expect . until nh @ xmath3 data are available for @ xmath191 1200 @ xmath10k , we will not be able to explain this phenomenon . figures 17 and 18 show that this leaves a short window of time for the determination of the abundance . the region between 8 . 3 and 9 . 3 @ xmath13 ##k is rich in the o@ xmath3 bands , the two largest being the 10 . 75 and 10 . 85 @ xmath13 m ( ) . this spectral region is the lower level of the atmosphere ( @ xmath192k ) where the absorption lines of nh @ xmath3 which are absent from the carbon spectrum are less prominent than in the @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 bands . in this spectral region , the atmosphere is very close to the nh @ xmath3 / nh @ xmath8o boundary , and for nh @ xmath3 there are 50 % of the equilibrium value ( ) . this would be a good estimate of the extent of nh @ xmath3 abundance in the lower level of the atmosphere . we estimate that nh @ xmath13 m alone should give the nh @ xmath3 abundance of @ xmath193 % of the equilibrium value . with the advent of new optical , astrometric , and infrared techniques , our understanding of the spectrum of gl 229b is rapidly becoming more accurate and more comprehensive . the recent discovery of ch @ xmath9 in the infrared helps to appart and has enabled the determinationof this new spectral class , the t dwarf . h @ xmath8o , h , h i , and h ii have also been identified . there is strong evidence that the slight increase of the brightness at longer wavelengths is caused by unprecedently forming lines of the transition metal @ xcite . the presence of hydrogen may also play a role in determining the composition of gl 229b . it is unfortunate that the surface gravity of gl 229b is poorly known . we have not been able to significantly extend the detection range with our nh @ xmath0 , @ xmath1 , and @ xmath2 instruments . as a result , all our parameters are estimated as a function of distance . this is the most significant contribution to the progress in understanding the composition of this t dwarf . the surface gravity can also be determined from the study of the greatly altered nature of the atmosphere . we have found strong evidence for the presence of h @ xmath3 in the spectrum of gl 229b , which is derived from chemical equilibrium measurements . we have been able to measure its concentration at several different levels of the atmosphere , and we found a slight deviation from chemical equilibrium . a similar result has been found withit exists @ xcite and this abundance gradient can be explained by vertical mixing of the atmosphere . the size of the mixing pattern is not sufficient to account for the differences we see and the differences may be due to convection due to less intense light ##ing . we note that nh @ xmath3 photolysis is very important in determining the abundance of gl 229b . because nh @ xmath3 can be detected in three distinct bands corresponding to three different depths in the atmosphere , an accurate measurement of the concentration in each band provides information about the time evolution of mixing as a function of depth . this is an important and useful analytical technique which can provide useful information for understanding the vertical mixing of atmospheric molecules . in addition , an atmosphere with a large abundance gradient in the visible part of the spectrum can be used to determine the size of the mixing pattern . among detected and predicted molecules , only co and na @ xmath3 meet this criterion . the kinetic measurements with rainout of condensates @ xcite show that we can find large abundance ##s in the abundance of molecules kc , rb , cs , and na when they are soluble in water ( kcl , rbcl , cscl and na @ xmath8s, 3 ) in the cooler , lower regions of the atmosphere . copper and nickel have been detected in the atmosphere of gl 229b , and the ratios of h i and h ii help to determine the ir abundance . however , the detection timescales for these metals are so short that they should still be in chemical equilibrium ( lodders 1999 ) . therefore , they do not serve as indicators of vertical mixing in gl 229b . further work on studying the atmosphere of gl 229b reveals higher abundance for ch @ xmath9 and nh @ xmath3 , and , to a lesser extent , of nh @ xmath8o . a more accurate determination of the ir abundance from the 3 @ xmath13 m spectroscopy is more difficult and would require more signal - to - signal resolution than is currently available . therefore , 5 @ xmath13 m spectroscopy to determine the nh @ xmath3 abundance for @ xmath194bar , while possible , is impossible . the question of vertical mixing and departure from chemical equilibrium gains importance when we find that the vertical departure of co from chemical equilibrium has a much higher ch @ xmath9 ##o , by virtue ofthe presence of molecular nitrogen . furthermore , our observations show that nh @ xmath3 emission in the 10 @ xmath13 m region is strong . because ch @ xmath9 is a strong star in the near infrared , as is nh @ xmath3 in the 10 @ xmath13 m region , data from this must be taken into account when an understanding of the composition and structure of gl 229b is needed . this new level of understanding highlights the potential and the challenges faced by t dwarfs . the composition of gl 229b is much different than had been previously thought . gl 229b is currently the only t dwarf known to exist in a binary system . there is no evidence that the radiation from the primary star has a significant effect on the composition of the atmosphere and gl 229b is most likely one of the t dwarfs . it is the largest and by far the most massive of the known t dwarfs currently known , and the number should increase to several hundred during the next two billion years @ xcite . the growing body of work on gl 229b contributes to the more challenging research to do on t dwarfs . the challenge of measuring changes in the composition of t dwarf stars as a result ofsolar astronomy is a new concept . we thank m . guillot for the contributions which were so helpful to our research , m . schmidt for sharing information on the photolysis of mars @ xmath3
