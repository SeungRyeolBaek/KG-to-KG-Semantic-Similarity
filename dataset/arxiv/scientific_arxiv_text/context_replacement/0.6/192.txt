relationship between doping and the nature of the doping and spin modulation of cuprate superconductors is one of the important and controversial issues in the field of high - temperature physics . examples of spin modulation are observed over a wide temperature range for many types of cuprates , especially at the doping level of 1 / 8 @ xcite . for 1 / 8 - coated silicon cuprates , the electron spin is well known to exhibit one - dimensional structures , similar to " stripes " @ xcite . however the theoretical implications of the available experimental data are not consistent with the existence of one - dimensional structures " stripes " @ xcite . the theoretical - based models comparing between stripes and stripes for 1 / 8 - doped silicon cuprates are at best somewhat confusing . at the same time , the problem can not be resolved on purely theoretical basis , because it requires consideration of the effects of the ground state doping levels proposed by first - order theory . the theory is , however , not accepted as an example of theory , in part , because of the fact that it limits the spin transition in all possible directions and thus limits themodel of spin as well . the last model , however , was supported by a model of spin in the form of the graph of @ xcite . that model was based on a particular example of a spin " grid " . however , the grid model was shown to be consistent with the results of spin - vortex spin relaxation experiments of ref . @ xcite . this result , however , does not rule out the example of a grid in the two - dimensional version of the vortex @ xcite described in ref . [ 2 : 1 ] . a similar noncollinear spin relaxation were also observed in experiments . the physical properties of spin - vortex textures were described in ref . @ xcite . so far , however , the general model proposed for vortex @ xcite has not been applied to the spin - vortex model . in the following section , we consider such a general model , find its mean - value function and compare it with experiments . it should be noted , that , indeed , the mechanism of the spin relaxation in 7 / 8 - dimensional spin cuprates or crystals or both , dependsthree - dimensional , it appears to interact with two - dimensional states @ xcite . for the spin vortex and lattice , the stability of the three dimensional structure can be determined from the values of the # ##s of the two cuo @ xmath1 states . for 7 / 8 - dimensional cubic cuprates , the dynamic state here represents the equilibrium state of the two spin - vortex systems described in the previous section . these states are mainly caused by spin fluctuations close to the point of the phase transition @ xcite . they are likely to have spin , stripe and spin degrees of freedom , e . g . @ xcite . in this case , the spin - vortex state here shows as the dynamic state of high - temperature fermionic systems . as it happens , the figure shows the behavior of the two three - dimensional states @ xcite in the context of the standard model for describing the dynamics of cuprates . [ category : spinbackground ] with states @ xmath2 , @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 are shown in the figure . they represent the equilibrium states as follows : spin -compare with @ xmath5 ( red ) , @ xmath6 ( yellow ) , @ xmath7 ( brown ) , and @ xmath8 ( green ) ; even b - state [ @ xmath9 ( red ) , even c - state [ @ xmath10 ( green ) ; even d - state [ @ xmath11 ( yellow ) , even d - state [ @ xmath12 ( green ) . , scaledwidth = 1 . 5 % ] the model to be constructed includes several different types of fermionic states , both in magnetic and non - magnetic regions of the resulting spin texture . the basic procedure for constructing the model is the same as in ref . @ xcite . first , the spin texture is divided into plaquets with different levels of magnetic field , and second , for each plaquet , the one - particle fermionic states corresponding to the spin states are used for the theoretical calculations . given that plaquets are very large , it can be shown @ xcite that the number of one - particle states in each plaquet is of the order of 1 mev , which means that , for energies much higher than 400k , it is possible to consider only the onedue to the action potential . we assume that the two single - particle states of spin - ½ plaquets are non - spin - ½ , and so we have only one particle per plaquet . as can be seen in fig . [ 1 : 1 ] , the texture contains four states of spin - ½ plaquets . we refer to two of the four states as a - states " and to the other two as c - states " . the high spin a - states are denoted by index @ xmath13 , and c - states by index @ xmath14 . two a - states and two c - states with spin indices of @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 , are expected to have different spin wave functions that can be distinguished from each other by spin indices . the low - spin states of non - unpolarized plaquets in the center of the texture are expected to be spin - ½ . we , therefore , have two fermionic states in each individual plaquet with " in " and with " in " one " . we call them b - states " . since the same texture contains two different types of spin - ½ particles , we denote the two b - states .indices @ xmath15 and with the indices @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 in fig . [ fig : unitcell ] . we then construct the total - energy hamiltonian using the same procedure as in fig . @ xcite . first , we assume that the observed spin - spin interaction between the plaquets is only due to the interaction of the textures and not to the observed energy fluctuations . at the same time , we assume that the interactions of the textures in the core region shown in fig . [ fig : core ] are only interactions that do not change the center - of - mass energy of the two particles together . this leaves us left with formulas for on - shell indices @ xmath18 , @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 ( with @ xmath21 ) and with the following sub - set of total energy levels , namely : two b - states and two c - states contribute to a single d - state with contributions to the two a - states in the core and vice versa . the resulting hamiltonian is : @ xmath22 } } { _ { { \ hat { i } _ { [ i , \ alpha ] } } + 1 .

( \ right ) \ right ] , \ text { [ } \ ] ] where @ xmath23 is the interaction term , @ xmath18 , @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 are closed - shell states . with respect to the interaction terms @ xmath24 , which we have set to 1 , and @ xmath25 the unit cell shown in fig [ fig : unitcell ] , and thus @ xmath3 , @ xmath2 and @ xmath4 are the plaquets of the unit cell as shown in fig [ fig : unitcell ] . for example . @ xcite , whenever the absolute value of both @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 is zero , as is the case when the interaction term of hamiltonian ( [ x##q : originalhamlt ] ) , we have " # " for @ xmath26 or @ xmath27 referring to the corresponding plaquets as even " and " ##s " for @ xmath28 or @ xmath29 referring to the corresponding plaquets as odd " . [ - } { { as @ xmath30 } } $ ] note that c - states labeled as @ xmath31 would be equivalent to the c - states labeled as @ xmath32 . if all states except c - states were removed from hamiltonian ( [ q : originalhamlt ] ) , the model would be almost identical to the hamiltonian described by the @ xcite . since c - states do not necessarily correspond to a - states , and since c - states have the same interaction with the b - states and a - states ( but differently ) , the mean - field properties of the two models are very similar with the only difference being that c - states can receive mean field from both a - states and c - states , which , in turn , makes that mean field many times larger , and , as a result , the value of the superconducting transition energy is higher . since the above model ishas the same form and structure as that of ref . @ xcite , but we will use the notation ##ism of the equations and the notation , leaving the rest up to ref . @ xcite . in the case above , each of the fermionic states corresponds to a few possible states , which makes a mean - field solution not very likely . we can proceed with such a mean - field solution , and that involves at least the left hand side of system s energy . the first step of this derivation is to obtain the bogoliubov transformation for @ xmath33 - states in the form plaquet : @ xmath34 where @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 are two real numbers with the latter arising from a fermionic anticommutation . @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 are the corresponding states , which are to be affected only by the system s energy . the bogoliubov transformation for @ xmath33 - states ( [ g : bgvtransb ] ) and ( [ g : originalhamlt ] ) and taking only the real values of g that do not affect the number of g - states , we obtain : the hamiltonian ,@ xmath39 \ \ + \ epsilon _ { c } \ sum _ { i , \ eta } c ^ { \ dagger } _ { i \ eta } c _ { i \ eta } + \ epsilon _ { c } \ sum _ { i , \ eta } c ^ { \ dagger } _ { i \ eta } a _ { i \ eta } \ \ + gsw ( 1 - 2n _ { i } ) \ mathlarger { \ mathlarger { \ eta } } _ { \ eta } \ bigg [ ( e ^ { - i \ varphi _ { \ eta } } \ sum _ { ij } a _ { n \ text { o } _ { [ i , \ eta ] } } c _ { k \ text { o } _ { [ i , \ alpha ] } } + h . c ) \ \ + ( e ^ { - i \ varphi _ { \ alpha } } \ sum _ { ij } c _ { k \ text { o } _ { [ i , \ alpha ] } } c _ { k \ text { o } _ { [ i , \ alpha ] } } + h . c ) \ bigg ] , \ text {} } \ ] ] where @ xmath40 is the number of a - states and @ xmath41 is their kinetic energy . + as stated in ref . @ xcite , in order to obtain the fermionic anticommutation relations for the bogoliubov equations of a - and c - states , the bogoliubov equations for these states should be written in the quasimomentum form . first , we need to write the hamiltonian in terms of the state - space fourier transform for a - and c - states . to obtain the fourier transform we can change the vectors from @ xmath42 , @ xmath43 to the form @ xmath44 , @ xmath45 , where @ xmath46 is the position of the center of the crystal plaquet . for the vectors , we need to use the following notation ( measured in units of the crystal lattice ) : @ xmath47 which connects an odd a - state with an adjacent even a - state , and finally : @ xmath48 which connects an even a - state with two adjacent odd a - states . the vector @ xmath2 , @ xmath49 is one such that@ xmath2 - even b - states are located at the even a - states due to position @ xmath49 coming from an even a - state . now , we define the position of the unit cell as the position @ xmath50 of an even b - state in this set . similarly , even b - states are located at the set of positions @ xmath51 , even a - states at @ xmath52 , even b - states at @ xmath53 , and even c - states at @ xmath54 . now we define the hamiltonian ( [ 1 : avbstate ] ) as follows , @ xmath55 \ \ + \ epsilon _ { \ mathbf { a } _ \ text { e } } \ , \ { \ epsilon _ { a } a ^ { \ dagger } ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } ) a ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } ) + \ epsilon _ { a } a ^ { \ dagger } ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf r } _ { e } ) a ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf2 } _ { 1 } ) \ right . \ \ \ right . + \ epsilon _ { c } c ^ { \ dagger } ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf l } ) b ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf r } ) \ right . \ \ \ right . + \ epsilon _ { c } c ^ { \ alpha } ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf r } + { \ bf r } _ { e } ) b ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf r } + { \ bf r } _ { e } ) \ { \ } \ \ + gsw ( 1 - 2n _ { e } ) \ sum _ { \ alpha } \ bigg [ \ le ( c ^ { - 1 \ varphi _ { \ alpha } } \ sum _ { { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } } ] ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } ) a ( { \ bf r } _ \ text { e } + { \ bf r } _ { \ alpha } ) + 1 .

( [ e ] , [ e : ab ] , [ .##q : e ] , [ q : eaenergyi ] , [ q : ecenergyi ] , [ q : ebenergyi ] ) . in practice , this can not be done directly , but we can also solve a simple differential equation for the transition temperature @ xmath0 using the fact that , at the origin , the superconducting gap is close to the transition temperature , which allows us to calculate the temperature @ xmath98 . this can be found in table a . this gives @ xmath99 , \ begin { t } \ end { tc1 } \ ] ] from which , the b - field @ xmath100 can be calculated directly . as stated in ref . @ xcite , the sum of a - and b - fields has a van allen point , at the point corresponding to @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 . we associate this point with the superconducting gap , which we , therefore , define the term @ xmath103 = @ xmath104 , which tends not to zero compared to @ xmath105 , which we associate with the pseudogap . from the above formulaand for case i , we have : @ xmath107 @ xmath108 @ xmath109 where @ xmath110 the results can be found in table 1 . the same formula as for case i also gives the critical temperature @ xmath111 and the superconducting temperature for @ xmath112 , with the same ##r for a - and b - holes as in @ xmath113 . in figure ( [ 1 : figfamily ] ) , we have the two critical values of superconducting materials for cases i and ii given by : . ( [ delta1 ] ) and ( [ delta2 ] ) . . . thin lines above the thin line in case i and below the thin line case ii . the thin line represents the experimental value of the bose - hall - schrieffer equation @ xcite . , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] the plots of data for cases i and ii are plotted for the critical case @ xmath114 , which is represented by the dashed - line . this case corresponds to the case @ xmath115 . plots for the critical - case also correspond to case ii: for @ xmath116 , they all converge to nonzero behavior @ xmath117 . all of the critical - case ratios correspond to figure 1 : they also show @ xmath118 , and , which converge to the same bcs values for @ xmath119 . thus , if the predictions of the present model are correct , the critical - case ratio @ xmath120 represents the change from the standard behavior @ xmath118 for @ xmath121 to standard behavior @ xmath122 for @ xmath123 . the value of @ xmath120 for the critical case is a quantitative difference from the critical case ratio @ xmath124 for the lattice - based model of a . @ xcite , which has both a - and b - states . this quantitative difference is to be expected , because the difference between b - and a - states in the present model leads to an energy gap for the superconducting state and a lower superconducting transition temperature for the same value of the coupling ratio @ xmath23 . in ref . [ 1 : exp ] , we show how the predictions of the present model for the behavior ofof the superconducting materials associated with the same experimental data for the ##age ( bj ) @ xcite and the average temperature ( ilt ) @ xcite for both types of cuprates . this is the same set of experimental data as the data used in fig . @ xcite for testing the grid - based model . the predictions of the grid - based model are as shown in fig . [ fig : exp ] . the two predictions , when applied to cases i and ii respectively , have the same parameters @ xmath125 and @ xmath0 , which allows one to choose @ xmath23 and @ xmath105 for case i , and @ xmath126 for case ii . the choice between cases i and ii is made on the basis of the parameter @ xmath127 being larger or smaller than @ xmath128 . the data in fig . [ fig : exp ] shows a very good and consistent relationship between the predictions of the grid model and the experiment . in comparison with the predictions of the grid - based model , the relationship with the results improved significantly . moreover , it was better for cases ( a , b , c , d , e , f ,( , p , q , p , s ) , remained essentially the same in dimensions ( l , p , q , s ) , and slightly smaller in frames ( j , l , j ) . it should be noted here that the theoretical results themselves are sensitive to a number of problems , including , in particular , the experimental conditions for the ilt and @ xcite . we also note that , despite the obvious theoretical difficulty of finding @ xmath129 relative to @ xmath130 , the physical fact of the experiment that the critical ratio @ xmath127 which separates the frames beginning with @ xmath131 from those beginning with @ xmath122 appears to be well supported by experiment , and , indeed , the value @ xmath132 for such a critical ratio obtained in this experiment leads to more accurate results than the theoretical value as obtained in ref . @ xcite for the grid - based model . in the following example , we compare the theoretical results obtained in ref . @ xcite for the grid model to the results provided by the results of the experiment . the main difference is that the model includes both sets of fermionic fields , and thethis makes sense , even though some of the models are different . we have shown that the theoretical properties of the grid - based model still remain consistent , which means that the theoretical properties of the grid - based model of a . @ xcite can easily be compared to the spin - holes - based model . however , we do not have to do this ourselves . the most important difference between the spin - holes - based model and the grid - based model turns out to be the critical value @ xmath127 at which the temperature evolution of the superconducting gap stops , the value @ xmath133 , which , in fact , is very close to the pseudogap . for spin electrons , this critical value is @ xmath132 , whereas , for holes , it is 0 . we have shown that the predictions for the temperature evolution of the superconducting gap for the spin - holes - based model have good agreement with grid , and therefore , this prediction is much better than for the grid - based model . + + + + in the general case of cuprate physics , the model presented in this article is still somewhat complicated . however , we canuse this to generate ideas for more complex problems that may involve the study of the particle interactions , as well as the interactions between particles . in this section , we expand on the # ##s ( ii ) and ( iii ) sections before us .
