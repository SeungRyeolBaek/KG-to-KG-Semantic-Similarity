it is generally assumed that speed of rotation is driven by the magnetic - induced radiation of the surrounding neutron star . in this case the rate of change of the neutron star rotation rate can be related to the rate of the magnetic - induced rotation : @ xmath1 + where _ i _ is the speed of rotation of the neutron star , @ xmath2 - the rotational rate of the rotation , @ xmath3 - the magnetic moment , @ xmath0 - the angle between the spin axis and the magnetic equator , _ i _ - rate of rotation . for the measurements of neutron stars : number of satellites of the solar system ( @ xmath4 ) and the _ c _ of radius of @ xmath5 , we would have _ i _ = @ xmath6 . for the magnetic poles we have @ xmath7 + where @ xmath8 is the magnetic moment at the magnetic equator , @ xmath9 ? the induction at the magnetic poles . instead of @ xmath2 the rotation rate @ xmath10 is also constant and we can get from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : @ xmath11 + this formula isuse it to estimate the speed of light such that @ xmath12 for small objects . the other methods ( however , for example keith et al . , 2005 ) use only the parameter @ xmath9 instead of @ xmath8 . so we try to eliminate the dependence on the value of @ xmath13 and use the value of this value to obtain more accurate estimates of the magnetic fields . in a few of our papers ( malov & nikitina , 2011a , 2012 , 2013 ) , methods for estimation of the value @ xmath0 have been put forward and applied to large groups of objects ( keith et al . , 2010 ; van ommen et al . , 1997 ; weltevrede & johnston , 2008 ) of size 10 , 20 and 30 cm . the methods for this estimation are ( keith & johnston , 1977 ) : @ xmath14 @ xmath15 + 1 @ xmath16 - the angle between the plane of emission and the z axis , @ xmath17 - the angular width of the observed pulse , @ xmath18 - the measure of the angular width of the observed pulse , @ xmath##19 - the rotation cone of the solar system , @ xmath20 - 0 . the second case for the calculations of the angle @ xmath0 is : when the line of sight passes through the boundary of the rotation cone , i . e . @ xmath21 + in this case we can take the dependence of the first pulse angle @ xmath22 at the @ xmath23 point of the rotation cone and take the cone angle in the opposite direction to the @ xmath24 + . the result we obtain from ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ( malov & nikitina , 2011a ) : @ xmath25 + the set of angles calculated by this method is given by @ xmath26 and shown in the figure below . the position measurements are taken at the two points and . in this case we can take the second dependence of the pulse angle . from ( 3 ) we obtain @ xmath27 we can obtain from the dependence of @ xmath22 _ _ _ _ using the least squares method @ xmath28 + the first case for the calculations of the angle @ xmath0 is ( 2 ) . from these two cases we obtain @ x##math29y ^ 2 + 2c ( a - b ^ 2 ) = + d ^ 2 ^ 2 - d ^ 2 ( b + c ^ 2 ) = [ . \ \ \ ] ] + = @ xmath30 + we can reduce the equation ( 9 ) to the form : @ xmath31 + after calculating the value of x from the equation ( 9 ) we can calculate @ xmath0 from ( 12 ) . we have different values of @ xmath0 using this method and put them in the form known as @ xmath32 . then we find the errors in the equation ( 9 ) and in our calculations ( malov & nikitina , 2011a , 2012 , 2013 ) . there is an alternative method to calculate the @ xmath0 . this method takes different values of x , and is of different size for different structures . in this case , the authors use the following method for calculation of the coefficients @ xmath17 , @ xmath16 and @ xmath0 : @ xmath33 because the individual 3d structures take different values , the x _ x _ has a different value depending on the particular structure . we choose from the coefficientsvalue of _ n _ ( 0 . 5 ) . if the ratio of the intensity @ xmath34 at the peak of the spectrum to the peak of @ xmath35 is , for @ xmath36 . for @ xmath37 @ xmath38 , @ xmath39 @ xmath40 , @ xmath41 @ xmath42 , and for @ xmath43 @ xmath44 . it is worth noting that the solution of the equation ( 1 ) can be obtained easily for any value of _ n _ . for example , if @ xmath45 , the solution for @ xmath46 can be obtained from the equation : @ xmath47 for x = 0 : @ xmath48 y ^ 2 + 2c \ left [ c ^ 2 ( 1 + d - c ^ 2 ) - d - 5 \ right ] y ^ 4 + \ left [ 2dc ^ 2 ( 1 - d ) - \ right . . - c ^ 2 ( 2d ^ 2 - 6d + d ) + 5 \ right ] y ^ 4 + 2c \ left [ y ^ 2 c ^ 2 + d ( 1 + d ^ 2 ) - d ( 2d ^( - d ) \ \ ] y + c ^ 2 d ^ 2 ( y + c ^ 2 ) - ( c ^ 2 - d ) ^ 2 = 0 ; \ \ \ { { 0 } \ ] ] at n = 3 / 4 : @ xmath49 \ sqrt { \ frac { y + \ frac { c + d } { \ sqrt { c ^ 2 + 2cy + 1 } } } { \ } } - [ c ^ 2 ( c - d ) - c - d = 0 ; \ ] ] at n = 3 / 4 : @ xmath50 this method produces angles @ xmath51 ( see the table 1 ) . for many years calculations were done by one method only . when it became possible we used one of the three methods . in these calculations , the absolute value of the angle @ xmath0 has been calculated . the resulting angles @ xmath52 are shown in the table 1 . some other authors ( for example , kuzmin & dagkesamanskaya , 1983 ; kuzmin et al . , 1984 ; lyne & smith , 1988 ) carry out calculations of the angle @ xmath0 } for the same values of the##ars makes some interesting observations . we can develop further our method to calculate magnetic moments at the center of the binary system . the distribution of the angle @ xmath0 from the table 1 ( fig . 1 ) shows that the majority of stars have very small angles of the rotation axis . these stars are binary objects , and we can assume that they belong to the same source . the highest observed value for our sample of stars is @ xmath53 ##0 . we can assume further that the values given by the ( * _ * ) _ * are the upper limit of this value . this is not the case of the observed values of @ xmath0 . from the table 1 . , [ = 453 ] . calculation of the angle @ xmath0 ( deg ) .
