a multistable system is one that has a finite number of possible solutions for a given set of conditions . there is extensive evidence for such systems in the physical sciences , with examples coming from atomic and molecular physics @ xcite - @ xcite , physics @ xcite @ xcite , chemistry @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite , condensed matter @ xcite and biology @ xcite . multistability also appears to be an important entropy - reduction mechanism for a large number of information - based systems @ xcite . in view of this , it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms leading to multistability and , in particular , to develop mathematical models where this phenomenon can come under consideration . the first published result in this area was obtained by newhouse @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite who proved that , near the homoclinic boundary , a sequence of diffeomorphisms on a two - dimensional manifold has infinitely many independent particle sources ( sinks ) , a result that was later extended to three dimensions @ xcite . it has also been proved @ xcite that , in addition to infinitely many sinks , infinitely many other sinks exist near the homoclinic boundary . the result of thestability under such small values has been studied @ xcite @ xcite . a very important problem related to multistability is the conservation of some dissipative properties to conservative systems . conservative systems have a large number of unique invariant sets , including periodic orbits , random variables and cantori . by adding a small amount of dissipation to a conservative system one finds that some of the invariant sets are stable . not all invariant ##s of the conservative system still hold when the value is large . however , for sufficiently small values , some properties ( including periodic orbits ) have been preserved in conservative systems @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite . the problem of coupling of particles and their motion in multi - dimensional space has also been studied by other methods @ xcite @ xcite . none of these are based on classical methods . however , using the method of numerical coupling @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite , useful experimental results @ xcite can be obtained . first , it has been shown in @ xcite that , for large values near the feigenbaum non - zero time limit , the systems generated by linear coupling may have a large .of stable periodic orbits . this is one of the problems we discuss in detail in this article . the work on the stability at the feigenbaum accumulation point is a milestone leading to the theory of control of chaos @ xcite @ xcite . the basic situation for control of chaos , is that of a random system with an infinite number of stable periodic orbits , all of them unstable . these orbits are completely controlled by various mechanisms . if , instead of a finite number of stable periodic orbits , one has , for example , a finite number of states , the above problem would be more simple and useful , because the problem would not be so complicated . it would help to keep the system in the same state of interest . near the non - doubling accumulation point the feigenbaum process , because of the existence of the correlation function , starts with an infinite number of stable periodic orbits . by coupling , as we now see , an infinitely large number of them will be unstable . the existence of a finite number of stable periodic orbits for any two different random maps , is a general problem where multistability is completely under control , in the sense that not only the nature of the system is completely controlled , one can also bethe set of points that represent the maximum number of possible states . this should be done , for example , with the results for the newhouse model @ xcite . rather than just focusing on multistability , we should consider the stability of the resulting linear systems , in particular the stability of the system and the effects of it . . the type of dynamics in the resulting system is similar to that observed in one dimensional coupled map lattice @ xcite with the exception that , due to the higher dimension of the phase space , the types of dynamics are different in our case . the results for the multistability model in @ xmath0 will greatly improve , and possibly correct , the previous results of @ xcite . coupled map crystals ( cml ) are linear ##ized systems characterized by the combination of a local nonlinearity and a gradient . the phase space of the cml described in this article is the space @ xmath1 ^ { { } $ ] and the states are generated by the function @ xmath2 , as follows . at a point @ xmath3 , is generated by @ xmath2 , and @ xmath4 is generated by @xmath5 where @ xmath6 , @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 . the variable @ xmath9 transforms @ xmath1 $ ] into itself . thus , the # ##ity relation ( [ def ] ) implies that @ xmath10 ^ { 2 } ) \ { [ - 1 , 1 ] ^ { 2 } $ ] and the dynamics are well - defined . we denote the orbits resulting from the initial state @ xmath11 by the variable @ xmath12 , that is to say , @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 for which @ xmath15 . for the sake of clarity , we will also define the variables @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 . the above definition of dynamics also applies to these , for which , ( [ def ] ) and @ xmath18 where @ xmath19 . finally , note that the dynamics agree with the values @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 of the other variables . if @ xmath22 , then @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 . in this case , the dynamics is said to be periodic ( from @ xmath25 to ). more precisely , an orbit is said to exist if @ xmath26 and if the conditions agree , then we say to ensure stability of the orbit . this is the underlying model behavior described by finite - dimensional cml . to provide a sufficient condition for stability of our model , we say that for each point , one has @ xmath27 for all @ xmath15 . it follows from ( [ def2 ] ) that the condition @ xmath28 is the taylor expansion of @ xmath29 , and that . . . since @ xmath30 , the condition @ xmath28 is equivalent to the previous condition ( see def 2 ) . @ xmath31 from now on , we say that @ xmath32 . the condition @ xmath33 is not satisfied . however , if for all @ xmath34 , then @ xmath9 is the smallest possible point [ @ xmath1 $ ] , and we can assume that this occurs . when @ xmath35 is sufficiently large , this holds only for @ xmath36 . starting from , and .the first , non - periodic ( periodic ) states arise from sets of synchronized ( periodic ) orbits . to understand this phenomenon , as well as the set of synchronized orbits , we must consider all the periodic states of dimensions 1 and 2 . let @ xmath37 be the first fixed point of the @ xmath38 - variables . it exists for every one of the states and @ xmath2 has one such fixed point [ @ xmath1 ^ { 2 } $ ] . in @ xmath38 - variables , the jacobian of @ xmath39 at this fixed point is 1 . the condition is @ xmath40 and the corresponding eigendirection is the condition @ xmath41 . the second one is @ xmath42 and the perpendicular component , perpendicular to the diagonal is known as the half - diagonal . the condition @ xmath43 also determines a period - 2 orbit , which is of non - dimension 2 if @ xmath44 . this implies the well - known period - doubling condition of @ xmath9 which determines a periodic period - 2 orbit of @ xmath2 . then , .suppose that the derivative @ xmath45 is positive for each @ xmath46 . then the maps @ xmath44 and @ xmath47 , i . e . @ xmath48 creates a co - dimension 1 period - 2 orbit of the same fixed curve . all the conditions of the periodic ##ity theorem ( see e . g . @ xcite ) are satisfied when the derivative @ xmath49 is closed over . the period - 2 orbit given by this derivative is co - periodic and periodic . to see this , denote both @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 with indices . since the derivative @ xmath42 is positive and the normal vector is the non - null , we have @ xmath52 ( very close to the limit ) . because of the @ xmath53 condition , the derivative @ xmath2 also creates a period - 2 orbit with components @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 . so if @ xmath56 , the curve would have two periodic orbits given by the co - dimension 1 derivative . this is given by the unicity of the derivative ##s . however , theclose to the origin , we have @ xmath57 and @ xmath58 which reach the same state . by virtue of the symmetry of @ xmath2 , and close to the origin , this symmetric orbit is stable with respect to rotation in one direction ( the off - center direction of the orbit ) and since @ xmath59 , it is stable in the direction closest to the origin . the result can then be computed . the relation with @ xmath60 and @ xmath58 holds for all @ xmath61 and is the unique ( up to [ t ) t - 1 time - independent symmetric orbit of @ xmath2 and @ xmath1 ^ { 2 } $ ] . using the corresponding jacobian , one has the formula for the result @ xmath62 \ right + \ left ( 1 - 2 \ varepsilon \ right ) ^ { 2 } ( c ^ { 2 } - c ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 2 } = [ \ ] ] where @ xmath63 the calculations show that , if @ xmath64 , the result , then @ xmath##65 and @ xmath66 , with the imaginary part iff @ xmath67 . under this condition , we have @ xmath68 if @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 iff @ xmath71 . ( the condition @ xmath72 also holds if @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 , see figure 2 . ) however , by crossing @ xmath46 , the resulting orbit is the inverse - square of @ xmath75 . this condition is valid for the symmetric orbit of a curve with center @ xcite and the consequences of the condition only apply when the point @ xmath76 is crossed out . this condition produces two non - zero period - 2 orbits ( the point and is fixed ) . we have shown that these orbits hold for both @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 . for @ xmath79 , their components are those of the fixed point of @ xmath9 and the components of the period - 2 orbit . when the imaginary part of @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 is not zero , we have @ xmat##h82 . ( once again , if @ xmath73 and @ xmath83 , the equation @ xmath84 is true , see figure 2 . ) the symmetric orbit is only stable in the neighborhood @ xmath85 . if @ xmath44 and the neighborhood @ xmath86 are swapped out , this orbit becomes a hopf curve creating a new stable invariant circle . a further analysis shows that the circle is stable when @ xmath46 is sufficiently large and when @ xmath87 is sufficiently small . however , if @ xmath79 , it does not exist and the curve is @ xmath88 which means a period - doubling solution of @ xmath9 is a period - doubling curve . note that invariant circles in two - dimensional cml arising from the intersection of a symmetric orbit and their normal orbit had previously been known as @ xcite . after that time , the system was still known as ( [ def ] ) , but the size difference between @ xmath89 and @ xmath35 can be larger than @ xmath90 . figure 2 shows an example of the system below .. however , it is also possible to map the components from @ xmath79 to different values of the constant . in this case , as well as in the previous , the coupling point is @ xmath0 ( the accumulation point of the period - 1 orbit ) . at point 2 , from @ xmath79 ( the point ) to @ xmath91 ( the point of collapse ) , the symmetric orbit becomes stable . the figure below shows the unit circle for @ xmath92 . at the points 1 and 2 , the symmetric orbit is stable . at point 3 , the collapse occurs , the symmetric orbit becomes unstable and the non - symmetric orbits become unstable . thus , the point 3 ( @ xmath93 ) corresponds to the location of the stable accumulation point . the quantum theory is not restricted to stable orbits that correspond to some value of constant . in particular , the stable period - @ xmath94 orbit will collapse to form a stable ( non - symmetric ) orbit of half the period . for @ xmath95 , let @ xmath96 be the center of the period - @ xmath94 orbit of @ xmath9 .the points @ xmath97 are the vertices of the local period - @ xmath94 orbit of @ xmath39 . by the same reasoning and since the jacobian of @ xmath98 is zero , the corresponding orbit along the off - diagonal direction is @ xmath99 the fact that this orbit is @ xmath100 makes , if @ xmath44 , a local - phase - period - doubling orbit . applying the results of the previous section to the point @ xmath98 , we see that this orbit is an orbit with the components @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 for each @ xmath15 , which is called the self - dual of - @ xmath103 orbit . since @ xmath104 , this orbit occurs only if the orbit along the diagonal direction has 0 ( the local period - doubling orbit of @ xmath96 ) . in other words , the figure 1 of - @ xmath94 orbit occurs only if the local period - @ xmath94 orbit exists . so it follows from figure 1 that , at least for @xmath0 , the phase opposition period - @ xmath103 orbit exists only if the phase opposition period - @ xmath94 orbit exists . this is true only for the only @ xmath105 orbit whose coupling constant is the value of the period - @ xmath106 orbit in the counter - clockwise direction . this has @ xmath107 and @ xmath108 if @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 and @ xmath111 if @ xmath112 ( see figure 2 ) . however , a similar model for @ xmath0 , shown in figure 2 , shows that the number of components of the phase opposition period does not depend on the period . in this model , we have calculated the value of @ xmath35 for the hopf period , the phase opposition and the time - reversal of around the period , versus the value of the period . for this case , the model is identical to that shown in the previous figure , with an additional value of period - @ xmath87 . in addition , the model shows that the phase opposition period can be calculated for@ xmath44 ##0 . this result is an example of the result that will be discussed later . first , since the phase difference orbits are the first ones to form when the electrons are removed from space and since the first such orbit that is formed is of period 1 , it follows that the necessary and sufficient constant for coupling is @ xmath113 , the constant for the stability of the coupling . we also consider the stability and the coupling of the period - @ xmath94 orbital for @ xmath0 . our explanation for this behavior of @ xmath46 is that the coupling properties of @ xmath9 are similar in their properties for the periods and axes of @ xmath35 at which the interactions occur ( see figure 3 and 4 ) . we also consider the orbits which for @ xmath79 have the same period and correspond to the orbits @ xmath114 and @ xmath115 . these orbits are formed only when @ xmath35 exists and are proportional to the phase difference of their components in @ xmath79 . for @ xmath0 , the orbit @ xmath9 has the period - @ xmat##h94 . for any @ xmath116 , whose coordinates for @ xmath117 up to 8 are shown in figure 1 . in this figure , the nodes represent the order in which the components are , and the tree itself represents the order of each component of the orbit sequence . another important parameter is the relative distance @ xmath118 between the components of an orbit . @ xmath118 represents the number of steps one has to go through in the search process to create a new orbit . the relative distance is used to determine the types of periodic orbits that we are searching . for example , the coordinates of each component of a periodic orbit are at distance 0 , those of a phase - locked orbit are at distance 1 . however , when we speak of an @ xmath119 , we refer to the relative distance of the coordinates of the components . for any @ xmath120 , there are @ xmath121 synchronized orbits with a @ xmath118 which have been out of phase with @ xmath122 and , with @ xmath123 . the coordinates of a non - @ xmath124 orbit is .at @ xmath117 ( @ xmath125 ) . for @ xmath79 , the only stable orbits are those with distances 0 and 1 . this property is true for @ xmath44 which in figure 5 for @ xmath126 . the number of pairs of orbits with period @ xmath127 should not differ from those with distance 0 . the results are shown in figure 6 which shows the values of the results . for @ xmath79 , the orbit is stable . when @ xmath35 increases , it suffers from collisions with orbits of half the period when the results are @ xmath100 and it becomes unstable . ( when at @ xmath35 , these collisions would be 1 - 1 collisions . ) if @ xmath35 increases again , the orbit intersects with an unstable orbit of the same period and a two - point orbit when the maximum value is reached . for large values of @ xmath87 , the orbit does not exist . the only orbit with which it exists is the one that at @ xmath79 intersects . @ xmath9##4 in one direction and @ xmath128 in the other . for the angular momentum , the local ##ization of the orbit is similar to the @ xmath129 expression . figure 6 shows a simple example of these results for the orbit @ xmath129 . between @ xmath79 and the point # 1 of the projection , the orbit is stable . the point 1 corresponds to the local ##ization of - 1 ( see figure 6 ) . however , between the points 1 and 2 , the orbit is unstable . it stops at the point 2 when it intersects with an elliptical orbit of the same radius . we have shown that the coupling produces the orbits with periods greater than 2 . @ xmath0 . there are yet two mechanisms known for this . . . the term of the jacobian of the orbit - @ xmath94 - is @ xmath130 the term @ xmath131 resulting from the coupling is when @ xmath117 ##9 . however , there is yet a third such mechanism . . is @ xmath132 the first term is the term @ xmath133 without coupling , @xmath134 is also the product of the factors of @ xmath9 for the periodic orbits . from the definition of the feigenbaum - cvitanovic constant , it follows @ xcite that this factor decreases to a constant value for @ xmath135 when @ xmath117 decreases . the coupling , , decreases the number of the orbit components in such a way that this factor also decreases . it is the combined action of this coupling with the increase of the period that bring the orbits into the period of the unit circle and stabilize the period . for example @ xmath35 there is a simple convex explanation for the behavior of @ xmath136 . the reason that in the higher dimensional case the factor @ xmath137 remains constant , when @ xmath117 decreases , is because every time the period increases , the decrease of the number of components greater than zero is caused by the fact that the component of the period closest to zero is always a bit less . for the periodic orbits on the period - preserving path , the orbit components closest to zero are on either side of the coupling . the combined action of the above solution is to bring the orbits back into the unit- spectral theorem . however , because the point closest to x has to be near the origin for the line to cross the origin with half the distance , this means that the ratio of the components is allowed to increase . the greater the angular distance between the two points on the sphere , the greater will be the effect that the two ( two - dimensional ) regions experience . so one expects the expansion lines at @ xmath136 to increase with the angular distance . this effect is most obvious in figure 3 which shows the expanding and contracting lines for orbits with distances from 1 to 3 . the # ##off of the two lines for the same angular distance shows that the distance @ xmath35 is , the greater the number of possible stable orbits that are possible . an approximate ##d ##yad of the number of stable orbits is obtained by measuring the distance @ xmath138 to @ xmath79 for both @ xmath117 and the distance @ xmath139 . however this distance is an approximate estimate of @ xmath140 itself , because this distance is approximately as with @ xmath35 for all of the angular distance of the orbit . see figure ., the general properties , when @ xmath117 exists , of this orbit are known . from these , one replaces @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 so that in figure 1 there is more than one fixed point for each orbit @ xmath143 which corresponds to non - stable orbits with the same constant distance . * the value of the largest @ xmath35 parameter that describes an orbit of constant distance @ xmath118 is to the right @ xmath117 @ xmath144 * the value of the largest @ xmath35 parameter for which an @ xmath145 orbit is stable @ xmath146 from this , one gets the result that at infinity @ xmath147 all such orbits are stable if @ xmath148 @ xmath147 has obtained a lower bound on the number of distinct stable periodic orbits , because then we have obtained all orbits with the same distance under consideration in the three dimensions . * note : _ for any small _ @ xmath35 _ _ an infinitely large number of distinct stable periodic orbits is true _ _ . also , for any small @ xmat##h35 , which is an infinitely large number that is irrational , is an irrational number . the orbits either decay ( and are not stable ) or decay before @ xmath35 does . as a result , the definition based on the implicit ##ness notation , as used by @ xcite is incorrect . given a pair of orbits of different periods , even if they remain as such for a given period , that does not imply that their ( combined ) orbits are stable .
