the transport properties of nonlinear non - linear chaotic systems are derived from well - understood @ xcite . and in particular so - called chaotic systems which are essentially chaotic systems where an ensemble of particles undergo directed fluctuations @ xcite . the origins of the interest in this lie in concerns of obtaining useful information from the noisy phenomena that tend to occur in chaotic systems @ xcite . much research has been done on the properties of deterministic random systems @ xcite as well as hamiltonian systems @ xcite . chaotic systems are defined as those which are highly dependent on initial conditions . whether chaotic or regular , the behaviour of chaotic systems in the transition from stable to chaotic states is in general highly dependent on the parameters of the system . that is , the phase - space structure is often relatively complex , consisting of stability islands as in the seas , for example , or of many non - interacting islands . this can change significantly as conditions change . for example , stability islands may bump into each other , or break up , and the chaotic system itself may get cut off or otherwise distorted , and it may lose size and shape . this means that the transport properties may change significantly as well . a few years later, mateos @ xcite solved a simple physics problem with a non - underdamped system . he looked at an ensemble of particles , specifically the potential for the particle , both over time and the overall system . he showed that this potential , which is an entirely independent function of ` the potential ' , could be either positive or negative depending on the value @ xmath0 of the current potential for the particle . at the same time , there are cases of @ xmath0 where the trajectory of an individual particle exhibits chaotic behavior . mateos made a distinction between these two ranges , showing that the change of the direction was correlated with the change from chaotic to chaotic behavior in the system itself . even though it is unlikely that such a model would be completely valid for all known chaotic systems , it would still be very useful to consider chaotic behavior ##s such as this . these general properties would give an insight into all the many different kinds of dynamics that are possible for chaotic systems . a further proof @ xcite of the mateos model by barbi and colleagues , however , showed that this was not a valid result even for the chaotic systems studied by mateos . they found results showing that it is possible toand spin currents in the direction of transition from stable to chaotic states . they suggested an alternative explanation for the spin state , that it is due to the spin transport function of the internal spin states of the particles . these two ideas were fundamentally wrong . instead , this group based their results for example on the dynamics of a _ n _ t as opposed to an ensemble . this also implies that the fluctuations of the currents are random . this is not true in general for all systems of the type being studied . in fact , there may be a dependence of the fluctuations on the dynamics of the ensemble being studied . this has been pointed out in the paper @ xcite which laid out a general methodology for studying the behavior of such a rotating periodic and chaotic system . depending on the # ##ization , the quantum system under study has either rotating periodic or chaotic states or a combination of both . it is therefore important to know how the spin state will behave in such a system . the consequences of the results on the statistics are also relevant to the issue of the possible statistical interpretation of these results , since calculations are only performed , by virtue of finite - precision , in finite fields and finite ensembles . it is therefore important to consider the results of barbiand also with respect to the details of the method used , and more specifically , to show how it affects our understanding of the system , as we do in this paper . we conduct further experimental work on the transport of the current in a particular quantum system , in the same system as studied by mateos @ xcite and barbi and rodriguez @ xcite . we study the effects of different types of ensembles of particles on the current and show that the transport depends only on the size of the particle ensemble . we also show that it is necessary to consider ensembles for transporting the current . this is one of the main points of this paper : particle ensembles are used in quantum mechanics , and therefore it is necessary to study the co - effect in the context of the physical properties of the system . having done this , we then proceed to study the relationship between the # ##s for the particles and the transport of the current . we show that although we agree with some of the conclusions of barbi and rodriguez ##s results , the same principle still applies . that is , it is still necessary to study the transport in the context of everything from random to chaotic , as well .but without the corresponding current curve . the result of our study is , that the transport laws of the chaotic system are not as simple as the initial conditions . however , we do find evidence for a modified form of mateos law ##nr . that is , in general , conditions for the behavior of a function of some parameter have to be associated with abrupt changes in the current . depending on the desired value of the parameter , these abrupt changes may cause the local dynamics to change direction , but not necessarily so . we start here with a brief discussion how to understand the details of the connection between particles and current curves , where we discuss the dynamics and time - dependence for individual particles for this system , where we can construct a phase curve for this system . in the next section , we discuss the problem of understanding the connection between the dynamics of individual particles and of currents . from this , we are able to get details of the local dynamics associated with current curves , and to conclude our previous discussion above , after which we continue . the aim of these discussions is to understand the dynamics of the chaotic system . the approach taken here is that to understand transport laws we try .other systems in more detail need analysis . we consider the same @ xmath1 - like system described earlier by mateos @ xcite , as well as barbi and others @ xcite . we consider an ensemble of particles moving with an arbitrary periodic potential , driven by a periodic time - average electric field , where the system has a periodic time - average . there is no noise in the system , so it is completely stable , although there is noise . the equations of motion for an arbitrary system for such a system are given by dimensionless equations : @ xmath2 where the arbitrary periodic potential can be written in the form @ xmath3 + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ , [ [ \ { ( 1 - x _ 2 ) ] \ bigg ] . \ ] ] in this case @ xmath4 has been used for systems such that the system always starts at the origin with @ xmath5 and the origin @ xmath6 . ( a ) a phase diagram for the entire system . for @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 , and the particles associated with @ xmath9 ( b ) @ xmath##10 ( 1 ) and the figure and the diagram of the two orbits of the wells with @ xmath11 . , s = " [ : " , n = 302 ] the half - space of the undamped undriven and the space corresponding to the wells with @ xmath12 look like a kind of a pendula . that is , the wells exhibit one of two general non - equilibrium relationships : ( i ) inside the wells ##s , currents and all their components converge , leading to no net transport . outside the wells , the currents with ( ii ) are to the right or ( iii ) to the left , with the net transport depending upon the direction . there are also ( iv ) variations in the relationship between the unstable and stable wells , with the unstable fixed points in increasing order , as well as the unstable and stable fixed points themselves , all of which form a form of net transport . when transport is shown via the @ xmath13 - 1 diagram in fig . [ 1 : dyn ] , it makes the unstable fixed points the netsolve for the system . when the system is acted on , the phase - space becomes chaotic with the associated examples of chaotic loops and chaotic homoclinic systems . the dynamics of the system in such a system are not very simple in nature and depend heavily on the choice of parameters and initial conditions . we see examples of the dynamics of this type of system in the form of poincar numbers below . ( [ figure1 ] b , c ) , with the figure - 1 point replaced by the center of the system . a simple description of the dynamics of the system as a function of the parameters ( @ xmath14 , @ xmath15 ) results in a simple problem . this can be done in very simple and quite simple ways . the most simple method that we use is as follows : now choose the initial trajectory ( let us choose @ xmath0 ) and then take the values of @ xmath16 , and return with a fixed value for @ xmath17 . then repeat the initial trajectory , taking the values of the ' s of @ xmath18 each time @ xmath19 from the initial trajectory ( and we have@ xmath20 . this is observed stroboscopically at all intervals @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 and @ xmath23 form an interval @ xmath24 with @ xmath25 the total number of observations observed . of these , take observations at intervals other than the cut - off from @ xmath26 and compare the resulting observations against @ xmath27 . it should be noted that all this work is necessary to produce observations which are independent of boundary conditions , and we shall do this here , in the context of the current system and later . if the system is a one - dimensional system , all of the points lie in a single interval @ xmath28 . a periodic orbit with period @ xmath29 ( that is , with period consistent with the current ) such that with @ xmath30 we have at @ xmath31 different values of @ xmath32 for @ xmath27 . all periodic orbits , and periodic orbits of any type lie in a simply - connected or non - simply connected set of points . for the periodic orbit @ xmath33 , the highest possible value of @ xmath34at @ xmath35 are used as initial conditions , and then , they are obtained separately , and so on until @ xmath36 . that is , the flow diagram is obtained by removing the first term , in this case @ xmath0 , from @ xmath27 to the corresponding at @ xmath37 . this process is used to compare with the dynamics of the system with the same dynamic behavior . suppose that the initial conditions are at the troughout the system , and the flow diagram shows only the dynamics of a single system . we have done several experiments , including a simulation , with the initial conditions and the results that are shown . we have several examples of this type of flow diagram , , where they are then compared with the actual dynamics of the system . having already shown the full range of values for the system in this case , we will return in the next section to a discussion of the non - linear behavior of the dynamic behavior of these systems , and the behavior for the ensemble . the current @ xmath38 for the dynamics of the system is defined in an analogous way to mateos @ xcite as the time - evolution of the values oftake an average of initial conditions . that is , an average of the initial conditions is taken for a single discrete time @ xmath39 to obtain the average velocity of the sum @ xmath40 this average velocity is then also time - averaged ; using the discrete time @ xmath39 for , this reduces to a single sum @ xmath41 where @ xmath25 is the number of time - averaged taken . for this to be a useful tool to use with phase diagrams , @ xmath38 should be independent of the sum @ xmath42 but still strongly dependent on @ xmath43 . the second parameter h that is not used in the example above is the shape and size of the transport parameter h . that is , the transport parameters of an example of a chaotic system depend in part on the shape of the phase - diagram being considered . it is therefore important to use the same initial conditions to generate a model . the most obvious example we see in fig . ( [ figure2 ] ) is that in the case of multiple particles , a single particle model has properties very different from that of many others . however , it turns out that in the chaotic case , it is possible to generate asingle paths to give us the same result as coming from multiple paths . now consider the example shown in fig . ( [ figure3 ] ) where we consider the two equations resulting from adding the number of points in the resulting ensemble . thus , the sum becomes progressively larger as a function of @ xmath0 for all @ xmath44 . even more interesting is the fact that the single trajectory of ( @ xmath45 ) can produce new points that do not exist in the current @ xmath44 ensemble . current @ xmath38 versus the set of points @ xmath44 for @ xmath7 ; liquid lines correspond to a regular motion with @ xmath46 ; solid lines correspond to a chaotic motion with @ xmath47 . note that a single trajectory is sufficient for a regular motion . the result in the current ensemble is only valid if the @ xmath44 reaches a certain point , @ xmath48 . , source = " source : " , x = 302 ] current @ xmath38 versus @ xmath0 for all numbers of points @ xmath44 ; @ xmath45 ( 1 ) , @xmath49 ( line ) and @ xmath50 ( straight line ) . note that a single trajectory exists in the regular regime where all the curves converge . in the regular regime , as @ xmath44 increases , the curves converge towards the next trajectory . , [ = " dynamics : " , [ = 302 ] ] , note that single - trajectory average currents are often much larger than regular currents . this follows from the fact that an extremely large current has configurations with different configurations which all behave well . in our examples , with these curves we talk about @ xmath51 for example , and barbi and alice have currents of @ xmath52 or larger . however , it is also clear that only a few configurations cancel the current behavior , else there would not be any behavior of the current as a result of @ xmath44 . [ this is taken from ref . ( [ figure3 ] ) . we note that the * * * behavior of an event may be a bit closer to @ xmath53 than the behavior of the individual trajectory . it should also be noted that there is a dependence of the state on the behavior of the individual trajectory , this is also .for example @ xmath44 , of course . the current is represented by the value @ xmath54 . for @ xmath45 , it is generally assumed that the relative position corresponds to the absolute position of the time - dependent current , and that this is a non - linear and random process . however , for a random ensemble , then , the behavior of the ensemble strongly affects the value of the current , and can cause , for example , large amplitude fluctuations , as shown in fig . ( [ current - bifur1 ] , [ current - bifur2 ] ) for example . note also that in fig . ( [ current - bifur1 ] ) , and @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 , the difference between the two ensembles is more pronounced . these points are analogous to the points where some sort of symmetry breaking is already occurring , which puts our emphasis on the importance of the observed states in the analysis of observed states . however , why these particular points should stand out among all the ensembles in the frequency domain , is not entirely clear . to see how to incorporate this information into analysis of the ensemble , ., note the fact that if we look at the initial state space for the hamiltonian - underdamped @ xmath57 system , we see the general case of small particles floating in a chaotic environment which exhibit a random trajectory @ xcite . in such a system , the current state depends on the location of the initial state . however , we are only in the hamiltonian regime when the threshold is zero . in this case , the phase - space consists in collections of states . that is , if the ##s are small , the current is more likely to depend more on the size of the statistical ensemble than on the location of the initial state . in contrast , in the chaotic regime of a non - hamiltonian system , the initial state has to be much larger than a certain threshold to achieve convergence . however , in the chaotic regime , it is always possible to have a small threshold and the random trajectory will converge , as long as we take time to eliminate the threshold . that is to say , in the context of dynamics , the value of the current has to be reduced to : @ xmath58 where @ xmath59 is a uniquely determined trade - off such that we have a random trajectory ( for example , in ourthus , we obtain convergence ( with @ xmath60 ) . when this modified method is used , the average ( ex - current ) becomes more accurate as a function of @ xmath61 and the values of the intial parameters . along with this method , we are now also in a position to compare convergence diagrams with the average , which we see in the next figure . our results are summarized in the series of figures fig . ( [ figure5 ] ) fig . ( [ ex - nobifur ] ) , in each of which we present both the ensemble average and the convergence diagram as a function of the parameters @ xmath0 . the combined results of these two results can be combined into a set of figure ##s which we see below ; these are written with capital letters . for @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 , we compare average ( upper ) with @ xmath62 and convergence diagram ( lower ) versus @ xmath0 . note that there is a * b * time delay when there are two signals only in the same frequency range . , height = " [ : " , width = 302 ] , etc . ( [ :##5 ] ) , which has the value at @ xmath63 , almost randomly . in this figure , we see many current - reversal ##s due to order - dependent effects , such as for values in the lower versus @ xmath64 . however , there is only one example of current - reversal , for @ xmath65 . note , however , that the current is not without structure and is so much as a function of frequency . this point is illustrated much more clearly in fig . ( [ figure6 ] ) where the current stays consistently above @ xmath53 , and where there are in fact , no current values at all . note also , however , that the current has no structure , even while remaining constant . for @ xmath66 and @ xmath8 , there is overlap ( upper ) and difference between ( lower ) versus @ xmath0 with @ xmath62 . , the current stays consistently below @ xmath53 . , height = " [ : " , width = 302 ] , and lower versus @ xmath0 . in ( a ) and ( b ) we see frequency distribution , and in ( c ) the same box .for an ensemble of ensembles starting from only the stable fixed point @ xmath67 with a root - mean - square normal distribution of @ xmath68 , and the brown line for ensembles starting from the stable fixed point @ xmath69 and of width @ xmath68 . in ( b ) , the ensembles are centered at the stable fixed point , the brown line for an ensemble of only @ xmath68 , and the continuum of @ xmath70 and black with width @ xmath71 . ( c ) is the description of the ensemble @ xmath38 without stable ( black ) and with transient ( white ) and with the single - phase ensemble with brown ( see barbi and brown ) . the fixed points for the ensembles are centered at @ xmath67 with root mean square normal distribution of width @ xmath68 . ( d ) is the first order condition . , [ = " 1 : " , [ = 302 ] it is possible to construct different versions of this with different conditions , leading to the following result , namely , that * ( 1 ) = all ensembles conform to .* * . here , we are looking for positive feedback , and at this point we have already made the more general assumption that all possible dynamics are associated with particles , which is in the mateos conjecture . we will then move onto comparing our results against the full proof of barbi and salerno ##s proof of this conjecture . in particular , we look at their fig . ( 2 , 3a , 3b ) , where they consider the ensemble s @ xmath72 . the difference between their results and ours is that we are studying _ number _ of particles , and are studying the behavior of these ensembles as a function of number of particles @ xmath44 , the size of the ensemble in 3 - space , as well as the ##s @ xmath73 . our experiments with particles @ xmath44 yield similar results in general , as we see in the recomputed version of these results , shown below in fig . ( [ current - bifur1 ] , [ current - bifur2 ] ) . however , ( 1 ) the particle - particle interactions are , not necessarily , nonlinear and can be more easily used as examples of dynamics in the study of the physical properties of the quantum system .the ensemble results on the other hand , even when modified , show some consistency . ( b ) the ensemble results are consistent with barbi and colleagues in general , although differ in some aspects . for example , ( c ) the spike at @ xmath74 has a much larger effect on the local current , which has been rising for a while , so the single - trajectory result drops significantly . and , ( d ) the most important is that the single - trajectory result completely ignores the shock - induced spike at @ xmath75 . furthermore , ( e ) the barbi and colleagues analysis of the variation of the current in the region @ xmath76 is shown to show that our results are consistent with theirs , therefore , the ensemble results are shown to be consistent with variation despite their statements to the contrary . on the other hand ( f ) , the ensemble result has a spike [ see ref . ( [ x - bifur2 ] ) , and @ xmath77 of course ] that does not appear to be consistent with variation . after this spike , the current first rises below @ xmath53 and then rises above it again . the single trajectory results .note this side effect , as can be seen . the second model shows that in this case the two events occur either before or after the event . all of this leads up to two conclusions : the first is a consequence of the fact that there is a variation of the event current that can not be distinguished from the single - event current . the second is that the conclusion that follows from this is not a simple one , that * ( ii ) _ all current events are associated with spikes . * where does this leave us with the search for ` correct ' models , that is , for models ? one common way of testing the mateos hypothesis is to modify it , i . e . turn it into the hypothesis that * ( ii ) _ all _ current events are associated with spikes . * [ as ##p . ( [ x - bifur1 ] ) , for the case of @ xmath0 etc . , source = " source : " , range = 302 ] for @ xmath78 and @ xmath8 , there are spikes ( upper ) and # ##s ( lower ) versus @ xmath0 with @ xmath62 . * p .in this way that these states can be combined . we have states without jumps in ( b ) whereas the second figure ( c ) shows that there are pairs of stable and unstable states . this is further evidence that jumps in the current correspond in general to states . , title = " fig : " , width = 302 ] for @ xmath7 and @ xmath79 , graph ( upper ) and [ ##s ( lower ) versus @ xmath0 . , title = " fig : " , width = 302 ] finally , a * * * rule of thumb , previously not known , emerges from our work . this allows mateos conjecture to show that * ( jumps ) * correspond to the current state ( spikes and spikes ) * . note that this means these jumps of state are not random changes of current . if this current jump or spike goes to zero , this corresponds with a state change , making the mateos conjecture a special case . the theoretical basis of this conjecture is the fact that all of systems in _ case _ of _ perform a similar behavior . the nature of this behavior depends very much on the system parameters . this parameter ##ization is greatly reduced when the bifur##cation ##ic , when the behavior of the interacting two - body system is a either a phase - like transition , for example , or transitions from chaotic to regular regime . in the following figure , we see that this is a very good rule of thumb . for example , it completely ignores the conclusion of fig . ( [ figure6 ] ) which should not be seen as being an application of the mateos conjecture , or as a necessary condition . as such , this rule completely limits our ability to observe changes in the dynamics of the system as a function of time . a good example of where this particular rule leads us is by looking at a simple variant of the mateos conjecture , that is , an example where we expect to see current - changes without chaos , as in fig . ( [ non - bifur ] ) . the current - changes for that type of system would have to be in the chaotic regime and not outside of it . however , this turns out to be a ` hidden ' . when we look back on the chaotic regime , we see only the chaotic . this is also consistent with our assumption that current - changes are associated with chaos . examples of the transitions from regular ##ity to chaos and chaos respectively .for the current to flow . however , in not only such cases can these small spikes be observed . we can see an example of this in fig . ( [ rev - nobifur ] ) . the current is expected to flow smoothly , @ xmath80 with almost no significant spikes , even when we do a statistical analysis of the data , as in fig . ( [ rev - bifur ] ) . so , again , although surprising , this result is close to the uncertainty theorem . this fact , that there are cases where the rules above do not seem to hold , is one of the main arguments dealing with this problem , of course . we note , however , that we have shown that these same rules hold when we consider the data as well ( but not only here ) . in particular , in this paper we have taken the view that it is necessary to use the rule of motion ( even if not strictly so ) to determine the statistical properties of non - linear chaotic and random processes . in the case of the random process , we have shown that it is necessary to work with rules of time , length , shape , and complexity when determining the ` entropy ' associated to an event . wedisregard for these assumptions , and that the information on the dynamics is only available at the critical point . we have also shown that the following general conditions hold : reversal of single - particle dynamics usually corresponds to different spikes or jumps in the dynamics for each particle of the same size . phase transitions are a special case of this . however , not all spikes or jumps correspond to phase reversal , nor vice versa . the real question is now to find out if the rules for when these rules are valid and not violated can be made more precise . k . p . also thanked j . barsch and kamal k . singh for encouraging him , the reimar lst , and financial support from the alexander von humboldt foundation in 1999 . a . k . p . is grateful to carleton wilson for the ` wilson , wallin , and wilson of 1949 ' research grant , and to the mpipks for inviting him for a research fellowship , which led to this award . his papers with j . - h . rost on these topics are also cited . a . hnggi and bartussek , the theoretical physics of complex systems , lecture notes in physics vol . 476 , edited by m . parisi , in. a . mueller , and r . zimmermann ( springer verlag , berlin , 1996 ) , pp . 294 - 308 ; a . a . asturmian , , * 276 * , 917 ( 1997 ) ; a . jlicher , a . ajdari , and a . prost , j . mod . phys . * 84 * , 1269 ( 1997 ) ; a . dring , nuovo cimento , * 84 * , 685 ( 1995 ) s . flach , o . schmidt , and y . zolotaryuk , phys . mod . lett . * 54 * , 2358 ( 2000 ) ; o . schmidt , s . flach , y . zolotaryuk , and v . a . ovchinnikov , europhys . lett . * 66 * , 141 ( 2001 ) ; a . denisov et al . , * 66 * , 041104 ( 2002 )
