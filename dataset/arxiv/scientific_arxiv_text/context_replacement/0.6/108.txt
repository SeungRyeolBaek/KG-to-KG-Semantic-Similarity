self - cooling @ xcite aims to cool molecules and atoms to very high temperatures . for this purpose , the correct understanding of the effects of the fundamental physical laws of the cooling process is very important . among the cooling techniques , raman sideband cooling has been shown to be a very effective method for cooling atoms to the ground state of their chemical species @ xcite . this cooling technique produces two stable , stable , ground states , which we call @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 , coupled by magnetic moments to a single excited state @ xmath2 . the transitions are usually driven by electric currents . a typical transition is a pumping transition , in which the atom is first scattered from @ xmath0 to @ xmath1 via a single focused raman laser , with a re - focusing pulse , in which the atom is again re - focused to @ xmath0 by means of another laser coupled with @ xmath3 . a change of the trap frequency during the repumping causes a change of the difference in the ratio @ xmath4 of the trap frequency @ xmath5 and the trap frequency @ xmath6 , with @ xmath7is the spin of the atom and @ xmath8 the wave function of the two - photon laser . in the maxwell - dicke scheme , where @ xmath9 , the potential for a reduction of the thermal energy is zero and so , on the contrary , the atom is cooling at a rate of one phonon of energy @ xmath10 per pumping cycle . since there is a high potential for the atom to be excited to the state @ xmath1 instead of being repumped , a number of additional pumping cycles will be required before the atom is fully excited into @ xmath0 , which further reduces the thermal energy at the end of the initial pulse , increasing the cooling time . however , since two and three pumping cycles are possible for atomic and molecular substates , scattering from @ xmath2 into the atomic substates can occur , leading to several problems . + from this , we see the effect of a high doping level in the raman sideband ##s by considering the thermal expansion and contraction of the two excited states at the end of the initial laser pulse . it should be pointed out that the limits of self - doping for multilev##el ##ts exist , which can increase the branching ratio of their solution @ xcite . those calculations have implications on the lamb - dicke regime and on the cooling efficiency . first , we find out the effect of the branching ratio on cooling for an ideal solution @ xmath4 , using selection theory . next , we calculate the cooling efficiency in the lamb - dicke regime and we reproduce the results in the lamb - dicke regime in accordance with the results in @ xcite . in addition , we note that in some cases , the total wavelength of the single photon ##s can be calculated with the same wave function @ xmath11 for the ` ` ' ' ' three - level atom @ xmath12 @ xcite . + this section is organized as follows . in section 2 we consider the conditions for the transition of a single photon during the repumping phase of a raman experiment , and we calculate the phase transition and decay of the photon concentration at the end of the transition . in section 3 we extend our calculations to states where the conditions of interest are different . in section 4 we publish our conclusions , and in the following we present the results of our calculations . we consider the three level atom model described above . [ 1 : scheme0 ], whose three states are the ground state @ xmath13 , the first excited state @ xmath14 and the state @ xmath15 of radiative energy @ xmath16 ; @ xmath17 , @ xmath18 are transition states , with equal probability of occurring @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 , where @ xmath21 . the frequency resonantly in the state @ xmath18 with rabi frequency @ xmath22 . in the following we define the wave function for these states to be equal to @ xmath8 , which is a good approximation if , e . g . , @ xmath14 and @ xmath13 are the states of the ground state . we consider the molecular dynamics in 3 - dimensions . + the wave equation for the probability distribution of @ xmath23 is defined as ( @ xmath24 ) : @ xmath25 + [ \ right _ 1 , \ left { master0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath26 has the form : @ xmath27 = , @ xmath28 is the detuning of the states of the @ xmath290 , which we take to be zero , and @ xmath6 is the inverse of the thermal expansion which moves the ion around the @ xmath30 - axis , with @ xmath31 raising and relaxation operators , respectively . the interaction of the ion with the laser frequency is described in the second step of the form @ xmath32 : @ xmath33 with @ xmath34 ( with @ xmath35 ) the raising operator , @ xmath36 the adjoint , and @ xmath30 the inverse of the ion . by using ( [ coherent1 ] ) , ( [ master0 ] ) we have used the plane wave , and we have referred to the rest operator rotating around the laser frequency . thus , the re - operator has the form @ xmath37 where @ xmath38 is the phase shift of the ion emission , which we call @ xmath39 . + in the form @ xmath40 we can use the excited state @ xmath2 and second order operator ##s @ xcite , and convert the one - level scheme to a two level scheme , with excited states @ xmath14 and .##width @ xmath41 @ xcite . in the case @ xmath42 the differential equation for the action of @ xmath43 , and of @ xmath23 on the basis @ xmath44 , can be written : @ xcite : @ xmath45 + \ j _ f \ right [ j _ f \ left + j _ f \ right \ right ] , \ left { master1 } \ ] ] with @ xmath46 the hamiltonian @ xmath47 , @ xmath48 the matrix , written as : where @ xmath50 and where @ xmath51 the solution of and . ( [ master1 ] ) can be written as : @ xcite : @ xmath52 with @ xmath53 , and @ xmath54 is the solution for the effective hamiltonian : @ xmath55 with and . ( [ master ] ) the following solutions to the single scattering problem were worked out : the first term of the equation refers to the case in which at time @ xmath56 a single emission event occurred . the second term describes a single scattering event , and the @ xmath57 -this is @ xmath58 scattering distribution . the variance of each term corresponds to the path associated with the pulse , and we can also define etc . ( [ sol ] ) as the sum of all the possible outcomes of the scattering events divided by their relative frequency . for @ xmath59 , @ xmath60 , the atom is scattered @ xmath0 and @ xmath61 . for a pulse of length @ xmath62 we can replace @ xmath56 by @ xmath63 using the formula of etc . ( [ sol ] ) and assume that the atom has been scattered into @ xmath0 at the beginning of the pulse . then , each term in the basis of etc . ( [ sol ] ) corresponds to the path associated with a given sequence of scattering events into @ xmath1 until the atom is completely scattered into @ xmath0 . for ( [ sol ] ) we can calculate the variance and the variance of the scattering events at the beginning of the repumping pulse , which is defined as : @ xmath64 where @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 are the two relative frequencies of the pulse . forin the form of the example shown above , we write the basis @ xmath67 as follows : @ xmath68 where @ xmath69 , @ xmath70 are written as : @ xmath71 | \ \ rangle \ langle \ | , & \ \ & \ \ { \ } \ | = \ sum _ { \ sum _ { l _ 0 , l _ 1 \ neq } } and where @ xmath72 is the number of eigenstates of the taylor expansion . for @ xmath73 , with @ xmath74 initial distribution over the stationary states , and according to fig . ( [ 2 ] ) the stationary state basis has the form : @ xmath75 where @ xmath76 is the initial distribution over the stationary states . the first term in the basis of ( [ sol1 ] ) is the sum of all jumps from @ xmath1 into @ xmath0 , where after each jump the identity matrix is stored in the basis @ xmath72 , whereas the second term represents all possible jumps . these two terms can be written @ xcite, and for @ xmath77 the following relation holds : @ xmath78 | [ \ rangle = s _ t ( s ) . \ begin { distri } \ ] ] here , @ xmath79 is the condition for the atom to be present in the state @ xmath80 at @ xmath59 , with the initial state @ xmath81 at @ xmath82 . using the binary relations ( [ explicit ] ) of @ xmath69 and ( [ distri ] ) , @ xmath79 has the form : @ xmath83 where we have used the relation @ xmath84 , with @ xmath85 being of the initial state of the initial atom . translating ( [ shift ] ) into equation . ( [ shift0 ] ) , ( [ diff0 ] ) , and using the binary relations of @ xmath31 [ see the figure ] , we have : @ xmath86 , \ begin { width1 } \ end { height } \ ] ] where @ xmath87 is the maxwell - dicke constant . for ( [ center1] ) is the phase corresponding to the energy level at the beginning of the repumping pulse . for @ xmath88 this corresponds to the average recoil effect @ xmath89 , with the photon raman scattering into @ xmath0 . in this case , the second term in the equation of viz . ( [ width1 ] ) , , and viz . ( [ center1 ] ) , ( [ width1 ] ) describes the effect of the component of wave vector @ xmath90 during the initial two - level transition @ xmath91 . , for @ xmath92 an additional wave vector @ xmath11 can be used for the multiple scattering during the two - level transition @ xmath91 , which takes the ratio @ xmath93 . , @ xmath94 describes the average recoil effect of the system resulting from the multiple scattering of light during the repumping pulse of the raman spectrum with the ratio @ xmath95 : this formula is given in the form in which we can find the second term in the equation of ( [ width1 ] ) , _ i . e . _for @ xmath20 and / or @ xmath96 respectively , . in fig . 2 the partial term of order of 1 . ( [ width1 ] ) is replaced with the partial term for @ xmath97 , for all values of the lamb - dicke parameter and as a function of @ xmath20 . thus , we see that @ xmath11 is the scattering rate for almost any branching ratio in the lamb - dicke regime , whereas for @ xmath98 the abrupt shift is clearly visible in @ xmath99 . + from ( [ width _ 1 ] ) we can obtain the new lamb - dicke parameter @ xmath100 for the initial scattering into the state @ xmath0 . this parameter is an accurate measure of the effect of the branching ratio on scattering . for @ xmath101 , if @ xmath102 the system is not in the lamb - dicke regime , it has been completely transformed into @ xmath0 . thus , the fine - grain ##ing of the system can be described by the wave equation for the initial state @ xmath103 projected onto @ xmat##h0 , where the rate of cooling ( h ) is the real part of the sum of two terms : one corresponding to the value of the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic moment at time @ xmath6 ( @ xmath104 ) , the other to the diffusion coefficient corresponding to the distance from the ground state @ xcite . this second term is proportional to the corresponding lamb - dicke coefficient for the ground state , and results in our solution to @ xmath105 . from the well - known form of the diffusion coefficient @ xcite , the second term gives the ground state laser quantum number @ xmath106 , which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient . + in the lamb - dicke coefficient , when @ xmath107 is equal to , or larger than , @ xmath6 , there are no estabilished solid - state laser - cooling techniques for the problem . here , we consider our problems in relation to the solution of @ xcite . however , a cooling technique similar to raman sideband cooling has been proposed , where pulses which bring the atoms to the ground state alternate with pulses exposing the atoms to a certain amount of laser light . these alternating pulsesapply two - photon detuning @ xmath108 to the value of the two - photon pulse , , where @ xmath109 . finally , the value of the branching ratio can be taken into account by using @ xmath110 . in this case , beams which can produce the maximum of @ xmath111 can be produced , provided that the following condition is satisfied : @ xmath112 where @ xmath113 is the dependence on @ xmath30 of the two - photon # ##form of the original pulse . for the counterpropagating pulses equal to @ xmath30 , @ xmath114 and ( [ width ] ) are optimal for @ xmath115 , i . e . equal to branching ratio @ xmath116 . however , in the maxwell - dicke regime the first term in the expansion of is . ( [ width1 ] ) can also be used . however , the expansion becomes exponential , and the rate of diffusion will be , as @ xmath20 ##6 . in the following , we show that the average kick associated with the repumping pulse in s - phase can be calculated in the same way as infrom the diagram fig . + let us consider the sub - scheme of fig . 1 ( 1 ) , where we have applied to the diagram of fig . + a new channel of decay from @ xmath2 into the stable and stable states @ xmath117 , with channels of decay @ xmath118 so that @ xmath119 , where @ xmath120 , @ xmath121 are the channels of decay onto @ xmath122 , respectively . the laser resonantly produces the transition @ xmath123 with rabi frequency @ xmath124 . for @ xmath125 the transition @ xmath2 can be adiabatically derived from the equation of state . in this case the laser model aquires the transition @ xmath126 \ \ & & + j _ e ' \ gamma ^ { \ prime } j _ 1 \ & + j _ 1 \ gamma ^ { \ prime } j _ 1 \ & + j _ e ' \ gamma ^ { \ prime } j _ 1 \ gamma , \ nonumber \ { { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath127 , with @ xmath##128 . the resulting hamiltonian is thus : @ xmath129 with @ xmath130 . the equation for @ xmath59 can be expressed as : @ xmath131 now , the mean and variance take the form : , fig . ( [ center1 ] ) , ( [ width1 ] ) where : the transition @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 is expressed as @ xmath132 , @ xmath133 ( @ xmath21 ) . in a similar way we have derived these equations for systems like the one shown in fig . 3 ( a ) , where the first excited state @ xmath134 is converted to @ xmath1 via the first recycling laser and to the transition @ xmath135 . for solving the problem , we assume that the recycling laser resonantly produces the transition @ xmath136 with rabi and @ xmath137 ( no matter , fig . 3 ( a ) ) . then , for all frequencies fig . ( [ mastermany ] ) , the equation , where : @ xmath138 ( @ xmath139 ) , with @ xmat##h140 is the probability of scattering into the ground state @ xmath141 ( @ xmath142 ) . assuming that @ xmath137 is such that @ xmath143 , the expression in fig . ( [ center1 ] ) , ( [ width1 ] ) corresponds to this case : , where : @ xmath20 is written as : @ xmath144 and the probability @ xmath19 of scattering into @ xmath0 is @ xmath145 . + the expression ( [ x _ prob ] ) indicates that the laser energy is constant for @ xmath146 , which can be determined by measuring either the peak energy of the repumping laser , or simply by counting holes in the laser multiplet , for example with the help of a magnetic field . we have shown the laser is excited with a high branching ratio and in the case of both absorption and emission modes at the peak of the repumping laser is raman sideband excited . the first and second components of the laser energy level have been determined respectively , and the value of the branching ratio has been worked out . we have shown that at thefor types of scattering the process can be described with an effective diffusion function @ xmath11 , and to an effective - dicke parameter @ xmath147 for the total scattering on the two - dimensional surface @ xmath12 . finally , on the basis of this formula we have calculated the efficiency of raman sideband cooling and of the total efficiency of single - source cooling using the lamb - dicke parameter @ xcite . + the formula ##mation and diffusion can be applied to raman cooling for all systems @ xcite . in that case the calculations are much simpler , since the total energy of scattering and diffusion remains a constant quantity after the cooling process . + in particular , these formulas can be applied to cooling systems for all systems . the authors continue the stimulating work with j . khler and j . ludsteck . j . a . , a . a . cirac , a . eschner and a . lambropoulos for more detailed discussions . this work is supported in particular by the european commission and the tmr - projects erb - fmrx - ct96 - 0087 and erb - fmrx - ct96 - 0077 . + ( [ distri] ) , we write ( [ shift0 ] ) and ( [ diff0 ] ) as : the operator ##mation @ xmath151 can be extended to such that @ xmath152 . now , consider the spectral sequence of the bosonic operator @ xmath153 and the following formula for the eigenstates of the harmonic operator , and .
