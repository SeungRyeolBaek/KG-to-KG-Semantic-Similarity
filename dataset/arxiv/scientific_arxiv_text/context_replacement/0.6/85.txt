a point moving in a certain direction on a translation surface performs on its mirror image an interval exchange transformation . study of these maps has been extensively studied during these last few years with respect to transformations of convex sets , to plane transformations of curves , to teichmller space and surfaces , etc . interval exchange transformations are closely related to abelian groups of translation surfaces . it is well known that the continued fraction determines the coordinates of the points in the poincar ##t * - plane . moreover , the rauzy - veech algorithm ( equivalent to euclidean algorithm ) provides a mathematical basis for the teichmller space of ( @ xcite ) . using this , m . masur in @ xcite and m . a . veech in @ xcite have also proved the keane ##n theorem ( the ##ness of almost all interval exchange transformations ) . using combinatorics of rauzy algorithm , kontsevich and zorich studied the principal components of δ of the vector space of abelian groups @ xcite . more recently , avila , gouzel and yoccoz studied the exponential component of δ for the teichmller .##ic flow also has the renormalization of the rauzy - veech induction ( see @ xcite ) . avila and viana used combinatorics of rauzy - veech induction to prove the existence of the real part of the lyapunov spectrum of the teichmller ic flow on the domain of abelian differential ( see @ xcite ) . also bufetov and gurevich proved the existence and existence of the limit of the spectrum for the teichmller ic flow on the hilbert space of abelian differential @ xcite . avila and forni proved the upper bound for for all interval exchange transformations and exchange transformations @ xcite . these results show that rauzy - veech induction which was later used to prove convergence of interval exchange transformations and convergence of the teichmller ic flow is , however , not far advanced beyond these two conditions . however , all the above results concern only the hilbert space of abelian differential . the corresponding results for convergence of complex differential forms ( i . e . of those , which are the least elements of abelian differential ) remain unknown . note that the ( real ) math .to the tangent space of curves , then , with the vector space of _ _ _ forms . from this point of view , the strata of abelian varieties are the orbifolds of the codimension on the tangent space of the tangent space . our interest in teichmller elliptic and that of the theory of continuous linear maps was one of the main motivation for the rauzy - veech induction for linear forms . further extensions of the elliptic theory were introduced by danthony and nogueira in @ xcite ( see also @ xcite ) and integral ##s of elliptic functions on curves . they introduced the theory of linear maps , as well as the concept of rauzy induction for these maps . see lyapunov extensions of the teichmller elliptic ##s kontsevich and zorich have performed series of experimental experiments with linear maps corresponding to elliptic forms @ xcite . these experiments showed lack of support for the rauzy - veech induction , as well as existence of linear maps such that the continuous linear maps are defined for a set of intervals of finite length , and the -for a given set of functions , of any characteristic ( examples of this problem are shown in figure [ rauzy : 1 : 2ii ] and figure [ 1 : rauzy : 1 ] in @ @ xmath2 ) . but at this time , there was no complete solution . therefore , in order to apply technique of rauzy - veech induction to differential equations in a systematic way it was necessary to satisfy two criteria , to identify those functions , which correspond to , and those functions , which are inner products of the domain of these functions . it was also necessary to identify those generalized functions which give rise to a linear system , and to determine the properties of these functions . in this way we found the following results , which allowed us to apply technique of rauzy - veech induction for linear systems . the results in this area were obtained in the following paper @ @ xcite . we will consider relations between combinatorics , topology and geometry of linear systems . to find similarities and differences between linear systems , to abelian and to modular forms let us say , consider the results of the .theorem . an interval exchange transformation is given by a discrete data ( parameters @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 respectively ) and by a continuous data ( parameters @ xmath5 of the function ) . note that the keane ##n theorem ( see below ) gives the criterion of ` ` minimum ' ' ( which , in turn , implies minimality ) of an interval exchange transformation . this criterion is satisfied for almost all parameters @ xmath6 when the parameter @ xmath3 is minimal ( i . e . @ xmath7 , and when @ xmath3 is ) , the corresponding interval exchange transformation is _ _ _ minimum . on the other hand the corresponding interval exchange transformations are precisely those that behave as smooth transformations of the elliptic curves to randomly chosen smaller intervals . the rauzy - veech induction consists of applying the minimum exchange map of an interval exchange transformation to the corresponding smaller interval . this induction can be implemented as a linear system on the finite - dimensional space of interval exchange transformations . the behavior of the parameters of the induction gives important information about properties of the interval exchange transformation at the initial point . this information is especially important when the parameters are well known and whenthe dimension of the resulting subintervals tends to infinity . an interval exchange transformation satisfying the _ property is said to satisfy _ property _ . for a continuous continuous function @ xmath3 , the set of points @ xmath6 which give rise to interval exchange transformations with keane measure ##ₙ are all real numbers , and so there is a finite lebesgue measure on . similarly , for the set of interval exchange transformations with a sampling process , the resulting sampling process is continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure ( and is defined by a theorem of veech ) . note that the resulting probability distribution has an invariant ##s . in this paper we use the definition of _ _ transformation _ for the image of @ xmath8 given by @ xmath9 . a linear transformation is a map @ xmath10 , from @ xmath8 into itself , of the form @ xmath11 , where @ xmath12 is the image of @ xmath8 without a point , , and for infinitely many points , and which is the lebesgue measure . in this paper we can also usethen , with the same property . the type of @ xmath12 is @ xmath13 = @ xmath14 if @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 belong to the special linear group , and @ xmath13 is ; = [ convention [ 1 : 1 ] . ] introduced by danthony and nogueira ( with @ xcite ) . as usual , the _ _ linear _ is defined for a generalized function ( ` ` generalized data ' ' ) and a vector space . a generalized function of type @ xmath16 ( with @ xmath17 ) is a one - to - one mapping @ xmath18 to the object @ xmath19 . a generalized function is _ _ linear _ if there exists a linear map associated to this generalized function , which is an inverse linear map of the identity component of the linear component . a generalized function is called _ _ linear _ if there exists a linear linear map associated to this generalized function . it is easy to show that a given generalized function is an inverse##reducible ; the converse is not true in general , we will say . locally and globally stable generalized polynomials can be defined by certain definitions expressed in simple algebraic terms . the two definitions are known as definition [ def : irred ] and definition [ def : dyn : irr ] respectively . consider a locally stable generalized polynomial @ xmath3 . the parameter space of the linear combination corresponding to @ xmath3 is given by a hyperplane consisting of a point . we have an elementary definition which assigns to a generalized polynomial @ xmath3 an open subset of the parameter space determined by the set of linear combinations defined by @ xmath3 . this subset is called the set of _ _ parameters _ . when @ xmath3 is stable , the set of _ parameters agrees with the parameter space ; in general it does not . the following section gives a more general definition than for @ xmath2 in the locally stable sense . @ xmath20 ##1 . if @ xmath3 is not locally stable , then if @ xmath3 is stablesimilarly , if @ xmath6 does not belong to the class of linear operators , the linear operator @ xmath21 is not minimal . if @ xmath3 is not minimal , then for almost all the sets @ xmath6 the linear operator @ xmath21 has the keane s property , and t is minimal . since the rauzy - veech induction agrees with t , it projectivizes to the function @ xmath22 on the set of all linear operators ; we shall call this map the _ _ rauzy - veech induction _ . let t be a linear operator on the unit circle and let us consider the set @ xmath23 of elements of the _ rauzy - veech induction @ xmath22 . theorem . if @ xmath10 has the keane s property , then there exists @ xmath24 such that @ xmath25 is minimal for all @ xmath26 . the _ rauzy - veech induction , defined on the set @ xmath27 , is rec##urrent . for a generalized class @ xmath3 we can find one or two more generalized classes @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 . the search for the proof of the rauzy - veech theorem @ xmath30 . these three rauzy operations define a partial order on the class of equivalence operations induced by an arbitrary class . rauzy class _ is the unique component of this order . note that definition of the rauzy classes is slightly different and more complicated than in the case of ` ` true ' ' , since for any given generalized class each of the rauzy classes may be uniquely determined . from the @ xmath31 we can see that every rauzy class is an equivalence class for the equivalence operations induced by these three operations ( see also [ category : equivalence ] ) . in contrast with the case of the ` ` true ' ' operation , we define the corresponding equivalence operation for all classes and define _ _ rauzy classes _ as equivalence classes of the generalized classes invariant under these three equivalence operations . the vector space of abelian groupsand of these elements are given by one of the poles of the ordinary elements . we define a subset of the dual space of the ring forms ( with at least three poles ) as @ xmath32 , where @ xmath33 denotes the center of the elements ( @ xmath34 refers to the pole ) . the rauzy classes of the ring forms are in one - to - one correspondence with the classes of and in the dual space of these forms . indeed , the rauzy classes where serve to define the simply - multiplication of the groups of abelian groups . for systems of a finite number of strata , it is possible to define as the set of all strata and , using the rauzy classes to partition them into a finite number of extended rauzy classes . doing this , veech proved that the minimal strata in genus @ xmath35 has two connected components and arnoux proved that the minimal strata in genus @ xmath36 has three connected components ( for abelian groups ) . they gave the extensionby virtue of irreducibility of the second form ( see theorem @ xmath2 ) one can apply theorem @ xmath37 to all the connected components of the set of ordinary integers of sufficiently large degree . this includes , in particular , the following original paper of zorich . each of the following four exceptional strata of the ##s @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 has exactly two connected components . note that a paper of the same name @ xcite shows the connected components of all exceptional strata of meromorphic # # with at most two components . these strata are either disconnected , or contain exactly two connected components each of which is hyperelliptic . the following paper @ xcite shows that each of the following four exceptional strata does have at most two connected components . however , the only currently available proof of the fact they are disconnected is the one based on the proof of the first rauzy function and related to the work of zorich . it would be possible to find an arithmetic - geometrico proof of the above theorem ; using a similar algorithm used in the kontsevich - zorich - theorem @ xcite . note also that a paper of zorich @xcite + explicits properties of for each possible rauzy class . see also @ xcite for examples for each of these rauzy classes . in section [ sec : iem ] we recall the properties of smooth functions , vector spaces and continuous linear maps . in section we recall the rauzy - veech induction and its basic properties . we extend these properties to irreducibility . + in section [ sec : giem ] we introduce the properties of the linear map and the properties of . + in section [ combinatoric ] we introduce a new definition of irreducibility , and prove the first part of theorem @ xmath2 . the main method we use to prove this theorem is the one used by marmi , moussa and yoccoz which is in @ xcite + in section [ sec : dyn ] we introduce the keane s property for the linear map and prove the second part of theorem @ xmath2 , that is in @ xmath40 . for that we prove that @ xmath10 has the keane s property if and only if the rauzy - veech induction is sufficiently well defined and the value of equal to .. . if @ xmath10 does not satisfy the keane ##y , we say that there exists @ xmath24 and that @ xmath41 is locally , which also implies that @ xmath10 is not locally convex . + in section [ dyn : rauzy : veech ] , we describe the action of the extended rauzy - veech system on the space of the two strata , and the theorem @ xmath31 . for that we present the teichmller theorem and the geometry of the space of the strata proved by masur and veech ( see @ xcite ) . + section [ rauzy : r : giem ] is devoted to a proof of theorem @ xmath37 for extended rauzy classes ; we present a proof of zorich ##37 giving an equivalent definition of these classes in three dimensions . + in the section we present the extended rauzy classes as some of the properties which appear in the general paper . we also present a proof of the extended rauzy classes . we thank anton zorich for this information . we thank arnaldo nogueira for support and information on the new edition of this paper .+ this definition is also supported by the anr ` ` teichmller projet ' ' ' anr - 06 - blan - 0038 . in this section we discuss the concepts of flat surfaces , vector spaces and geometric function theory . for other terms see also @ xcite and @ xcite . in this section we will not use terms used in the article @ xcite , or equivalently @ xcite . a _ _ surface _ is a ( real , connected , smooth ) triple @ xmath42 , equipped with a flat surface ( with no conical points ) such that the holonomy operator belongs to @ xmath43 . @ holonomy means that the linear action of a vector in a closed loop maps the loop either to itself or to its inverse . this means that the basis vectors are compact elements of @ xmath3 . equivalently a flat surface is a triple @ xmath44 such that @ xmath45 is a real , connected manifold , @ xmath46 is a compact element of @ xmath45 ( whose points are conical _ points _ ) and @ xmath47 is an element of @ xmath48 such that the linear map @ xmath##49 . + with half - lengths : @ xmath50 , and for each @ xmath51 , there is a neighborhood of @ xmath52 corresponding to a vector space . now we define the _ _ _ _ space by replacing the coordinates @ xmath53 with the coordinates @ xmath54 . this space maps to the restriction of @ xmath46 to points , called translations with pole points ( or @ xcite ) . we will then use the coordinates @ xmath55 or simply @ xmath45 . note that the holonomy is linear if and only if there exists a half - length such that the pole points vanish , or equivalently if the pole points @ xmath56 are the inverse ##s of an abelian group . we will also note that @ xmath45 is a vector space . for @ xmath57 , we define the vector space of abelian groups @ xmath58 as the set of points @ xmath59 modulo the linear map given above : @ xmath60 if there exists an inverse function @ xmath61 such that @ xmath62 . + for @ xmath63 ,we will define the vector space of complex numbers @ xmath64 as the vector space of integers @ xmath65 ( where @ xmath56 is called the total dimension of the abelian group ) modulo the equivalence class defined by : @ xmath66 if there exists an induced basis @ xmath61 such that @ xmath67 . the vector space of abelian differential ( respectively complex forms ) is defined by the dimension of the basis . we will define by @ xmath68 ( or @ xmath69 ) the strata consisting of holomorphic 1 - forms ( respectively complex functions ) with @ xmath70 roots ( or poles ) of : @ xmath71 . these strata are simply - connected in general ( for a complete list see @ xcite in the abelian differential case and @ xcite in the complex differential case ) . the group action of the @ xmath72 - th basis of complex numbers @ xmath73 on the complex plane has a special property . it is a measure - 1 invariant with respect to .natural measure @ xmath74 , for any space of area one algebraic varieties . this flow is known as the _ teichmller _ flow _ . masur and veech proved the following theorem . the teichmller natural measure depends ergodically on the measure ##ness of any one of the vector spaces of area one abelian and complex varieties ( with respect to the natural measure and the lebesgue measure ) . this theorem was proved by masur @ xcite and veech @ xcite for the @ xmath68 case and for the @ xmath75 case . + the theorem of the teichmller natural measure is proved with more detail in @ xcite , and @ xmath76 . the definition of the measure appears in the @ xmath77 preprints of veech : linear algebra on vector spaces of complex dimension i , ii ( see also @ xcite p . 445 ) . these preprints have been reprinted in @ xmath78 @ xcite . in this article we discuss also the notion of complex covering ##s . we first assume that , .under these conditions , and maps exist such that poincar ##t coordinates of the points and lines depend on these maps . here we can consider the rauzy - veech map and its geometric and topological applications ( see @ xcite for more details ) . let @ xmath79 be an open interval and let us consider a finite subset @ xmath80 of @ xmath81 . its complement is the set of @ xmath82 open subintervals . the translation exchange function is a one - to - one mapping @ xmath10 from @ xmath83 to a k - finite subset of @ xmath81 that is a mapping to a subinterval of the same interval . it is easy to see that @ xmath10 is uniquely defined by the following elements : a vector @ xmath84 that describes how the intervals are ordered ( such that the k - th interval , when translated from the left to the right , is translated from @ xmath10 to the right @ xmath85 ) , and a matrix with k entries that describes the order of the intervals . ( marmi , .##ussa , yoccoz @ xcite , we denote these sets by @ xmath86 , with @ xmath19 the finite alphabet . the size of the alphabet is a pair @ xmath87 , and the _ type is a pair @ xmath88 of one - to - one maps @ xmath89 . then @ xmath84 is a one - to - one map from @ xmath90 into itself , by @ xmath91 . we will then define such a subset with the notation : @ xmath92 [ example : 1 ] let us replace the finite alphabet @ xmath93 with @ xmath94 . then we define the subset @ xmath3 as follows . @ xmath95 in this way we define the concepts of winner and loser , using the results of the work of avila , gouzel and yoccoz @ xcite . for @ xmath21 we define the _ type _ @ xmath96 of @ xmath10 and @ xmath97 . we will then assume that @ xmath98 is the winner and @ xmat##h99 removes the pointer . # we create the subinterval @ xmath100 of @ xmath81 , taking the value of @ xmath81 as well . @ xmath101 the rauzy - veech map @ xmath102 of @ xmath10 is defined as the array mapping value of @ xmath10 to the subinterval @ xmath100 . it is easy to see that this is just an array - map , defined by @ xmath4 . ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . we then decide how to classify the values of the new values . there are two ways to classify based on whether @ xmath10 is of type @ xmath103 or @ xmath72 ; the type type of @ xmath30 ##0 depends on @ xmath3 and not the type of @ xmath10 . this produces the types @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 and @ xmath106 , with @ xmath96 the type of @ xmath10 . 1 . @ xmath10 ##2 type @ xmath103 ;equivalently the winner is @ xmath107 . + in that case , we define @ xmath108 by @ xmath109 where @ xmath110 . in an equivalent way @ xmath111 . then @ xmath112 where @ xmath113 and @ xmath114 we have @ xmath115 if @ xmath116 and @ xmath117 . + . @ xmath10 ##7 where @ xmath72 ; equivalently the winner is @ xmath118 . + in that case , we define @ xmath108 by @ xmath119 where @ xmath120 . in an equivalent way @ xmath121 . then @ xmath122 where @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 we have @ xmath115 if @ xmath125 and @ xmath126 . let @ xmath93 be an example . let us consider the product @ xmath3 of the [ 1 : 1 ] . from @ xmath127 we see that the rauzy - veechthis is well defined if and only if the two resulting elements do not have the same length i . e . @ xmath128 . in the following , we want to define the rauzy - veech induction on the linear system defined on the set of interval exchange transformations . then we want the result of the rauzy - veech induction on @ xmath10 to be also well defined . we also want this induction to be a linear renormalization group , in the sense that the results correspond to results on subintervals that tend to zero . this leads to the property of reducibility and to the keane s property . we will say that @ xmath88 is invariant if there exists @ xmath129 and that @ xmath130 is invariant if @ xmath91 . this means , that @ xmath10 splits into two interval exchange transformations . we will say that @ xmath10 has the keane s property ( also called the zero - value condition or o . s . i . s . condition ) , if the values of the elements of @ xmath131 and @ xmath10 are equal .this implies that @ xmath3 is minimal and the results of the rauzy - veech induction are always well defined . if the @ xmath132 are all independent vectors , that is @ xmath133 for all nonzero independent vectors @ xmath134 , then @ xmath10 has the keane s property ( see @ xcite ) . but the converse is not true . note that if @ xmath10 has the keane s property then @ xmath10 is minimal . let @ xmath21 be an elementary inclusion relation . let us denote by @ xmath135 the length of the interval corresponding to the intervals @ xmath136 for the @ xmath70 - th element of @ xmath10 and @ xmath137 ; we define @ xmath138 if it is well defined . the following are equivalent . 1 . @ xmath10 has the keane s property . the rauzy - veech induction @ xmath137 is always well - defined and for every @ xmath136 , the length of the interval @ xmath139 corresponding to, and @ xmath70 goes to infinity . thus we can see this result is very similar to the properties of finite fields . if we want to consider the rauzy - veech induction of a linear relation on the set of linear linear relations , it is necessary to consider the rauzy - veech renormalisation on the projective space of length parameter interval . the first such relation is the following rauzy - veech linear relation on length parameter interval : @ xmath140 with any successor @ xmath3 , we can have two partial successors @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 . similarly , any successor @ xmath143 has exactly two successors : there are exactly two successors @ xmath144 and @ xmath145 such that @ xmath146 . note that @ xmath3 is directed if and only if @ xmath141 is directed . then the order induced by @ xmath147 is a partial successor on the set of linear relations ; we consider it as a partial successor @ xmath148 . we .rauzy considers the connected components of this statement . the above statement is an equivalence relation on the class of graphs . in fact , the equivalence class of a graph is the rauzy class . the first statement is the following : if @ xmath149 then there exists @ xmath150 such that @ xmath151 . we assume there exists an oriented path in @ xmath148 between @ xmath3 and @ xmath152 , _ i . e . _ there exists @ xmath153 such that @ xmath154 . then there exists @ xmath155 such that @ xmath156 . by this definition , there exists @ xmath157 such that @ xmath158 . then there exists an oriented path in @ xmath148 that joins @ xmath152 and @ xmath3 . we can show that this is an equivalent statement in the case of connected components although the proof is much more complicated . first we consider the definition of the _ map _ of the _ edges in @ xmath10 , that is a contact map for which @ xmath10 is thewe have control of the control set of a user defined transformation . let @ xmath21 be an @ ##tric vector . a _ for a _ for @ xmath10 is a pair of vectors @ xmath159 such that : 1 . 2 . @ xmath161 . 3 . @ xmath162 . as a transformation of @ xmath163 , we consider the broken lines @ xmath164 and @ xmath165 defined by addition of the vectors @ xmath166 ( in this order ) for @ xmath167 with starting point at the origin ( see image [ link : image : iet ] ) . next , we consider the broken line @ xmath168 defined by addition of the vectors @ xmath169 ( in this order ) for @ xmath167 with starting point at the origin . if the lines @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 have no points other than the origin , then we can perform the transformation of @ xmath45 as follows : we can replace the side @ xmath170 on @ xmath164 with the side @ xmath##170 . @ xmath168 is the translation ( in the latter case , we can use the veech ##ai ##c ##s , # # [ subsec : # ] ) . let @ xmath171 be the horizontal flow defined by @ xmath172 . then the interval exchange map @ xmath10 is also the translation defined by the corresponding argument value to @ xmath81 of the horizontal flow of @ xmath45 . [ ] [ ] @ xmath173 [ ] [ ] @ xmath174 [ ] [ ] @ xmath175 [ ] [ ] @ xmath176 we have not yet proved the existence of such a suspension data for the horizontal interval exchange map . the necessary condition for @ xmath10 to be suspension data is that @ xmath3 is positive . however , if we set @ xmath177 so that @ xmath178 , and let @ xmath179 be a sequence of real numbers , then : @ xmath180 . the positive part of this number can also be both positive and negative , and @ xmath163 is also the suspension data for @xmath10 . if @ xmath3 is suspension , the definition of the suspension number was given by masur and veech .

[ ] [ ] @ xmath2 [ ] [ ] @ xmath40 [ ] [ ] @ xmath31 [ ] [ ] @ xmath37 we can define the rauzy - veech metric on the space of spheres , as well as on the space of closed surfaces . let @ xmath21 be an open surface , and let @ xmath163 be a section of @ xmath10 . then we define @ xmath198 .2 . we define @ xmath199 ( the original rauzy - veech class ) . if @ xmath200 is the replacement for @ xmath201 then @ xmath202 [ rk : suspension ] since @ xmath203 is distinguished from @ xmath204 by ` ` cutting ' ' and ` ` cutting ' ' , these two classes act as an instance of the same fundamental class , since they occupy the same space in the same space ( see class [ 1 : rauzy : induction ] for an example ) . [ ] [ ] @ xmath173 [ ] [ ] @ xmath174 [ ] [ ] @ xmath175 [ ] [ ] @ xmath176 [ ] [ ] @ xmath205 [ ] [ ] @ xmath206 [ ] [ ] @ xmath207 [ ] [ ] @ xmath208 [ the corresponding class names are @ xmath209 , @ xmath210 , @ xmath211 and @ xmath212 . ] if @ xmath31 is a rauzy class , we define @ x##math213 we have already defined the rauzy - veech map on the image @ xmath214 . it is easy to see that this is an almost surely linear map : if @ xmath215 then then @ xmath216 has exactly one preimage for @ xmath137 . we define the image @ xmath217 of @ xmath214 by the equivalence class generated by @ xmath218 . the linear map , , gives a map @ xmath219 from @ xmath220 to the point @ xmath221 of the vector space of abelian groups ( see also [ rk : 1 ] ) . note that @ xmath71 can be defined in terms of @ xmath222 . we can also check that @ xmath220 is connected and that the image corresponds to the identity point of the manifold . we can define for @ xmath223 the natural lebesgue measure on @ xmath214 i . e . @ xmath224 , where @ xmath225 is the natural measure on @ x##math31 and @ xmath226 preserve the lebesgue measure . the map @ xmath227 preserves @ xmath223 , so it is a measure , given by action @ xmath223 on @ xmath220 . there is an action of the map @ xmath228 on @ xmath214 on @ xmath229 , where @ xmath230 acts on @ xmath231 instead . this action preserves the measure @ xmath223 on @ xmath214 and agrees with @ xmath227 , so it leads to a one - way flow on @ xmath232 called the _ teichmller flow _ . since the action of @ xmath230 on @ xmath220 preserves the measure of the first boundary point , the teichmller flow _ acts on the subset @ xmath233 corresponding to that of x , and preserves the measure @ xmath234 given by the map @ xmath223 on that subset . note also that @ xmath235 is a local ##ization of @ xmath214 for the map @xmath195 and the poincar group of the teichmller group . latexmath : [ \ [ \ mathcal { \ } = \ { ( \ } , \ } ) ; \ \ { \ textrm { \ } , \ } } ] . we can show ( using @ xcite ) that the measure @ xmath219 is a double map from @ xmath237 onto a surface of finite area . a single point of the map and the measure @ xmath223 map to the measure @ xmath74 as in equation [ 1 : 1 : 1 ] . thus the measure of @ xmath230 is equivariant with respect to @ xmath219 , that is @ xmath238 . but if we restrict to dimension , then , the result of masur and veech ( definition of the measure ) is that the measure @ xmath234 is continuous on @ xmath233 . the corresponding rauzy - veech measure is continuous on @ xmath239 . veech proved a similar result , that is the measure of @ xmat##h230 ( at the end of @ xmath240 for the rauzy interval @ xmath31 ) , which proves the existence of the teichmller group for abelian groups ( see @ xcite ) . it is known that the induced map on @ xmath241 is locally linear . let @ xmath45 be a ( compact , smooth , connected ) smooth manifold with @ xmath1 a holonomy and let @ xmath242 be a vertical segment with a choice of a single right end ( or equivalently , a choice of left and right ends ) . we define the global induced map @ xmath243 of all segments starting from @ xmath242 in the same direction . a vertical segment which starts from @ xmath242 and then has reached a point will intersect @ xmath242 again . moreover , the set @ xmath244 is then defined as a finite set of points @ xmath80 ( with saddle points ) that correspond to the segments that start at this point , intersecting in the set @ xmath242 . the set @ xmath245 .a finite number of vertical intervals @ xmath246 and the map of @ xmath244 to each of these intervals is of the form @ xmath247 . the interval @ xmath244 , does not exactly correspond to the set of vertical intervals since when @ xmath248 is the interval @ xmath249 , then @ xmath250 , and @ xmath251 do not correspond to the successive intersections of the vertical interval with @ xmath242 starting from @ xmath252 . to solve this problem , we need to call @ xmath253 the successive intersection point of the vertical interval starting from @ xmath242 in the vertical direction . then if @ xmath248 , the successive intersection with @ xmath242 of the vertical interval starting from @ xmath252 will be @ xmath254 we have a dynamic system called @ xmath255 . following danthony and nogueira ( see @ xcite ) we can call such a dynamic system a dynamic system . we use only the rules that we have applied to our system .[ def : giem ] let @ xmath242 be an open set and let @ xmath256 be two connected components of @ xmath242 . a linear operator on @ xmath242 is a linear @ xmath257 , where : * @ xmath258 is a linear operator without fixed point defined on @ xmath259 , where @ xmath80 is a compact component of @ xmath260 . * if @ xmath261 and @ xmath262 belong to the simply connected component of @ xmath263 then the derivative of @ xmath258 at @ xmath219 is @ xmath13 . the derivative of @ xmath258 at @ xmath219 is @ xmath72 . * @ xmath264 is the derivative @ xmath265 . [ def : math ] in this case , we are dealing with non - linear operators defined on _ real _ surfaces . note that the orientability of the surface @ xmath45 has the following restrictions : the derivative of @ xmath##10 . definition [ def : giem ] . the above definition is satisfied by the following conditions . the first return map of the vertical surface starting from the line at @ xmath242 to the horizontal line @ xmath45 is a return map in the following way . take the positive vertical direction with a copy of @ xmath242 , and let @ xmath242 have two copies of @ xmath242 as in definition [ ttilde ] . we denote by @ xmath266 the one on the top and by @ xmath267 the one on the bottom . now we obtain the second return map by @ xmath8 of two lines , where a line starting from @ xmath266 is taken in the positive vertical direction , and a line starting from @ xmath268 is taken in the horizontal direction . we obtain the map @ xmath258 and it is necessary to verify that @ xmath258 meets the conditions of definition [ def : giem ] . then it is necessary that the map @ xmath269 of the two copies of the vertical line with@ xmath242 . note that the two types are defined by linear and linear transformations : these are a matrix and a matrix with multiple entries . we have an equivalent definition for vector data . [ def2 ] let @ xmath270 be an extension of @ xmath4 types . the _ _ _ _ of pairs @ xmath16 , with @ xmath271 , is a one - to - one function @ xmath272 . we can then define the generalized function as the table : @ xmath273 a linear function @ xmath274 is an extension @ xmath275 without fixed points like the table : @ xmath276 note that every function is in a certain way a generalized function . we can see how a linear _ _ defines a generalized function . let @ xmath10 be a generalized function and let @ xmath258 be the linear function in the table [ def : giem ] . the result of addition of @ xmath258 is a generalized function @ xmath277of these , , where @ xmath278 are subintervals of @ xmath266 and @ xmath279 are subintervals of @ xmath268 . since @ xmath258 is an arbitrary alphabet without fixed point , a @ xmath249 is mapped isometrically to a @ xmath280 , with @ xmath281 , and @ xmath258 to an alphabet without fixed points @ xmath282 and @ xmath283 . as in figure [ ex : iem ] , we map the alphabet @ xmath284 to each a @ xmath285 and we define a generalized alphabet in the form of the above , which is defined similarly to a one - to - one extension of @ xmath19 . [ example1 ] in terms of figure [ ex : giem ] , let us define the generalized alphabet @ xmath93 with @ xmath286 . then we define the generalized alphabet @ xmath3 as follows . @ xmath287 in an analogous way , we can define an involu##tion without a number in order to represent @ xmath3 . @ xmath288 we represent @ xmath274 in the following : @ xmath289 we can show that the generalized number corresponding to the linear combination shown in figure [ 2 : giem ] is the generalized number @ xmath3 . suppose that @ xmath3 is a ` ` true ' ' number of @ xmath4 , if and only if @ xmath290 and for all @ xmath291 , @ xmath292 . in this example ( if @ xmath293 ) : @ xmath294 exists , let @ xmath274 be the generalized number of x @ xmath16 and let @ xmath275 be the linear combination . if @ xmath274 is not a ` ` true ' ' number , then the only necessary and sufficient condition for @ xmath274 to come from a linear combination is that there are at least two values @ xmath295 and @ xmath296 such that @ xmath297 and @xmath298 . [ conv : int ] from here , unless otherwise specified ( in particular in section [ suff : cond ] ) , we can simply show that these functions all follow the above rules . there are at least two sets @ xmath295 and @ xmath296 such that @ xmath297 and @ xmath298 . let @ xmath299 be a set of all real numbers such that @ xmath300 it is possible to define a linear operator on the set @ xmath301 with the symbol @ xmath302 . as in section [ ref : iem ] , we can denote by @ xmath303 a linear operator . we use the _ rauzy - veech induction _ _ linear operators introduced by danthony and nogueira ( see @ xcite 1 . 473 ) . let @ xmath303 be a linear operator on @ xmath301 , with @ xmath274 of and @ xmath16 . if @ xmath304 , then the rauzy - veech induction @xmath102 of @ xmath10 is the linear relation given by the positive integer value of @ xmath10 to @ xmath305 . in the case of string ##ing operations , the corresponding data of the first linear relation depends only on the input type of @ xmath10 and whether @ xmath306 or @ xmath307 . as such , we assume that @ xmath10 has type @ xmath103 and type @ xmath72 respectively . the corresponding output data are given by @ xmath308 for @ xmath142 respectively . note that if @ xmath274 is a positive integer value , the sets @ xmath309 and @ xmath310 can be defined because @ xmath311 and because of the linear relation on the @ xmath312 that must be satisfied . we can define the set rauzy of @ xmath313 . let @ xmath275 be the linear map to @ xmath274 . 1 . + @ xmath314 . + @xmath315 if @ xmath316 and if @ xmath317 then we define @ xmath318 to be of type @ xmath16 and such that : @ xmath319 @ xmath315 if @ xmath320 , and if there exists a pair @ xmath321 included in @ xmath322 then we define @ xmath323 to be of type @ xmath324 and such that : @ xmath325 @ xmath315 if @ xmath326 is not defined . . + @ xmath315 if @ xmath328 and if @ xmath317 then we define @ xmath329 to be of type @ xmath16 such that : @ xmath330 @ xmath315 if @ xmath331 and if there exists a pair @ xmath321 included in @ xmath332 then @ xmath329 is of type @ xmath333 and : @ xmath334 @ xmath315 if @ xmath335 is not defined . we also define therauzy - veech tells @ xmath30 of @ xmath10 : * if @ xmath303 has type @ xmath103 , then @ xmath336 , with @ xmath337 if @ xmath338 and @ xmath339 . * if @ xmath303 has type @ xmath72 , then @ xmath340 , with @ xmath337 if @ xmath341 and @ xmath342 . let us consider the case of example [ example1 ] , with @ xmath343 . then @ xmath344 [ ex2 ] let us replace the type @ xmath274 defined for the example @ xmath345 with @ xmath346 . then @ xmath347 and @ xmath348 are also defined . similarly , consider the following combination with @ xmath274 . see proof . then we necessarily have @ xmath349 . we necessarily have @ xmath350 and @ xmath351 this is . [ ex3 ] consider the following@ xmath274 acts on the set @ xmath352 and @ xmath353 . but @ xmath354 is not defined for all @ xmath96 . however , for any linear map with @ xmath274 as suspension data . then we can define @ xmath355 , because the rauzy - veech induction of @ xmath10 is not true for all x . in the case of generalized linear maps , we can define the rauzy - veech induction of for all suspension data . so we have not yet defined irreducibility . however , it does appear in article [ combinatoric ] that some other definitions with respect to rauzy - veech induction exist also in the general case . in the next section we can give a definition of irreducibility which is guaranteed to generate ##ucible suspension data . it is easy to show that the smallest set @ xmath274 such that neither @ xmath356 nor @ xmath348 is true is not true . indeed , the set @ xmath274 of article [ ex2 ] is irred##ucible ( see theorem [ def : irred ] and theorem [ def ] ) . @ xmath348 is not unique . starting from a linear combination @ xmath10 , we want to have a finite surface and a finite interval whose lengths are equal to @ xmath357 of the corresponding points in @ xmath10 . this result will be called a _ data _ over @ xmath10 , and the expression for this function will be a _ suspension data _ . let @ xmath10 be a linear combination and let @ xmath358 be the length of the finite interval . let @ xmath359 be a collection of edge numbers such that : 1 . 2 . @ xmath361 3 . @ xmath362 4 . @ xmath363 . the result @ xmath364 is called a _ suspension data _ over @ xmath10 . we can now use in the analogous sense of a constant function for a linear combination . let @ xmath164 be a finite interval ( with a finite number of edges ) in the plane such that the edge number @ xmath365 is given .the complex number @ xmath366 , for @ xmath367 , and @ xmath168 is a straight line that intersects on the same side as @ xmath164 , and whose length at @ xmath368 is given by the complex number @ xmath369 for @ xmath370 ( see [ section : section : below ] ) . if @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 both intersect on their sides , then @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 form a triangle whose sides intersect in , and for each of the two sides is equal and has the same length . by joining these points together , one finds a straight line . it is necessary to assume that the vector or vector of the linear transformation at the side corresponding to @ xmath242 and @ xmath45 has the same linear transformation as @ xmath10 , so we have found a bridge at @ xmath10 . we can assume in this case that @ xmath163 has a _ _ curve _ . the two lines @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 both intersect at @theorem ( see section [ right : point : line ] ) . however , we can also construct a flat surface by using the analogous result from the open circle theorem . we can give a proof of this construction ( see e . g . @ xcite for the construction of the generalized function , see section [ subsec : point ] ) . this construction is very similar to the previous one , although the above definition is more complicated . however , for simplicity , we have an equivalent but more general definition . we can consider the special case when @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 form a regular curve . for each pair of points @ xmath371 and @ xmath242 , the absolute value @ xmath372 of the generalized function starting from @ xmath373 and ending at @ xmath374 is zero . this value depends both on the generalized function and on the real part of the integral of @ xmath163 . there is a natural transformation of the open circle @ xmath375 into the flat surface @ xmath45 and this map is obtained from @ xmath376 by induction . theboundaries of the @ xmath377 . . for the horizontal sides @ xmath378 $ ] are defined by the suspension data and boundaries for the vertical sides that depend on the generalized parameters and of @ xmath379 . . ] for the general case , we identify the sides @ xmath377 by the linear method . boundaries for the horizontal sides are defined . boundaries for the vertical sides , that do not depend on the generalized parameters , can be easily determined by the following steps . let @ xmath163 be the suspension data for the linear data @ xmath10 , and let @ xmath274 be the corresponding generalized parameter . there is a linear data @ xmath380 and a suspension data @ xmath381 for @ xmath382 such that : * the linear data associated to @ xmath382 is @ xmath274 . * for the @ xmath383 the two numbers @ xmath384 and @ xmath385 have the same real part . * the suspension data @ xmath381 is a vector2 . we can prove that @ xmath386 ( the second case is trivial and there is nothing to prove when the condition is zero ) . it is known that @ xmath387 , there would be a suitable suspension data . if @ xmath388 , then we can take the imaginary part of @ xmath389 , with condition ( 3 ) ( 4 ) above , and create a suspension data @ xmath381 with the same imaginary part as @ xmath163 , and such that @ xmath390 . this last condition implies that @ xmath381 defines a suitable triangle . if @ xmath331 , the condition @ xmath391 implies that @ xmath392 is closer rather than @ xmath393 . however , we can also turn @ xmath163 into a suspension data @ xmath381 , with an imaginary part , and suppose that @ xmath394 is very close to @ xmath395 . in that case , @ xmath381 also defines a suitable triangle . see @ xcite , section 3 . 2 for more details . we have already proved the following##ed = ##s for the suspension data . note that we have not yet defined the definition of a suspension data . this will be discussed in the next article . this definition is natural . see @ xcite and the following examples . [ t : irr : t ] let @ xmath45 be a flat surface with no real network , and let @ xmath242 be the unit vector corresponding to the point on the surface . let @ xmath396 be the first line passing through the left side of @ xmath242 , we assume that @ xmath396 reaches the point , returning to @ xmath242 , in positive and negative order . let @ xmath21 be the linear map given by the previous section of @ xmath242 of the suspension data . there is a suspension flow @ xmath163 such that @ xmath204 is a curve corresponding to @ xmath45 . see the examples described in the section of the @ xmath397 and @ xcite . we can use the rauzy - veech theorem on the space of equations , as well as on the space of ed curves .let @ xmath303 be a linear combination and let @ xmath163 be a suspension over @ xmath10 . then we define @ xmath398 as such . * if @ xmath303 has type @ xmath103 , then @ xmath399 , with @ xmath400 if @ xmath338 and @ xmath401 . * if @ xmath303 has type @ xmath72 , then @ xmath402 , with @ xmath400 if @ xmath341 and @ xmath403 . we then show that @ xmath404 is a suspension over @ xmath30 and has a structure similar to the one corresponding to @ xmath405 . then in the case of linear combination , we use the extended rauzy - veech induction theorem on pairs of vectors : @ xmath140 we then define as the corresponding extended rauzy - veech induction on the same vector by replacing the imaginary part by the constant @ xmath406 which is the dimension of the resulting vector space . in this case we havea necessary and sufficient condition for a proper subset to be a inclusion ; this will be the first part of definition @ xmath2 . let us first provide some examples to make up the definition . _ notation : _ if @ xmath407 is an inclusion , we will denote by @ xmath408 the subset with type @ xmath409 of cardinal @ xmath410 , and we will use these examples for definitions of @ xmath19 . we will also denote _ top _ ( or _ top _ ) the restriction of a generalized type @ xmath274 to @ xmath411 ( respectively @ xmath412 ) where @ xmath16 is the complement of @ xmath274 . _ notation : _ let @ xmath413 denote ( as a ) a subset of @ xmath19 by @ xmath408 . we say that a generalized type @ xmath274 of cardinal @ xmath16 is free if @ xmath414 and there exist @ xmath415 and @ xmath416 such that * @ xmat##h417 * @ xmath418 * @ xmath419 * @ xmath420 . the corners @ xmath421 , and @ xmath422 can be represented as top - left , top - right , bottom - left and bottom - right , respectively . we should not say that @ xmath423 , nor @ xmath424 . [ def : irred ] we should say that @ xmath274 is _ empty _ if @ xmath274 has a decomposition @ xmath425 where the corners @ xmath426 are not _ empty and one of the following conditions holds 1 . every corner is empty 2 . exactly one corner is empty and it is on the right . 3 . exactly two corners are empty and they are either both on the left , or is on the right . a decomposition that is _ empty is _ empty _ . the main result of this section is the suspension theorem which , being consistent with theorem [ su : irr : 1 ] is a consequence of theorem @ xmath2 . we are clear that in this section , we should speak of proof given by the authors of theorem [ su##sp : giem ] . [ sp ] let @ xmath21 be a linear code . then @ xmath10 admits a suspension @ xmath163 if and only if the underlying linear code @ xmath3 is linear . note that the choice of choice of this suspension is independent of the underlying code @ xmath6 . one can show that this reducibility property is not true with restrictions to the left / right , due to the nature of interval exchange maps . however , the choice of such a suspension to the left side of the segment in the case of the [ susp : giem ] is a possible choice . this may have an important role in construction of the rauzy codes . [ sp : lim : lim ] in the special case of interval exchange maps , one can also define @ xmath163 in such a way that @ xmath427 ( _ i . e . _ ) is a suspension on the left and on the right of the segment ) . but this is not always true . more generally one can show that @ xmath10 admits such a suspension with this additional restriction if and only if for every choice of@ xmath274 if the suspension @ xmath428 holds , then the corners are empty . [ cn ] a complete generalized suspension does not have any additional variables . let us call @ xmath3 a complete generalized suspension . it is useful to give two examples . let us assume that there is a suspension @ xmath163 and @ xmath3 . first we define @ xmath429 the same number @ xmath430 ; we define @ xmath431 if the corner @ xmath2 is empty . then we define @ xmath432 , @ xmath433 and @ xmath4 in an equivalent way for @ xmath434 and @ xmath37 . we then define @ xmath435 . we have satisfied the following conditions [ def : irred ] . _ i - every corner is empty . _ + - the following conditions for @ xmath436 distinguishing the second corner from the third one , and the second one from the third one , we have : @ xmath437 which is a constant . _ ii - if one corner is empty , and .and on the right . _ + we can show without need of argument that this is the upper - right corner . that implies that @ xmath2 , @ xmath40 are empty , and @ xmath31 , @ xmath37 are nonempty . thus the following inequality hold : @ xmath438 using the second inequality from the first one , we get @ xmath439 , which is the first inequality . _ + - if both corners are empty . _ + if they are both on the left side , then we get @ xmath40 and @ xmath31 , and @ xmath37 is empty . this implies that @ xmath440 is both positive and negative , which is impossible . + if they are both on the right side , which is impossible . if the two sides of the triangle are equal , then it is easy to show that all the corners would be empty , since this inequality does not hold under convention . the inequality is false . in this case , we need not necessarily show that the corners satisfy equation [ conv : 1 ] , since for these reasons , no other result of this kind can be obtained foran arbitrary integer is . we would have to work only with the integer part of the @ xmath441 in order to define a suspension . therefore , in order to understand the definition we must use the following vocabulary . we will use this vocabulary again in this article . [ def : # ] a _ pseudo - suspension _ is a set of natural numbers @ xmath442 such that : * for all @ xmath443 . * for all @ xmath444 . * @ xmath445 a pseudo - suspension is _ good _ if all the above definitions are true except for the extremal case . an _ vanishing index _ is the top ( or bottom ) of a pseudo - suspension is an index @ xmath446 ( respectively @ xmath447 ) such that @ xmath448 ( respectively @ xmath449 ) . a pseudo - suspension @ xmath450 is _ stronger _ than @ xmath451 if the set of vanishing indices of @ xmath452 is not embedded into the set of vanishing indices of @ xmath451 . we can see that @ xmath274 is _ good (##reducible _ if for any element of @ xmath274 contained in @ xmath428 of type [ def : irred ] , all the elements are normal . of course , irreducibility is irreducibility . the following proof is straightforward and accessible to the reader . [ max : def : irred ] let @ xmath274 be any element with signature [ conv : max ] that is a positive semi - ##group . then @ xmath274 admits a suspension @ xmath163 with @ xmath453 . let us assume that @ xmath3 is a normal element . one has to construct a suspension @ xmath163 with @ xmath3 . we can then show that @ xmath3 is not normal and we can show that @ xmath3 admits such a suspension with the same signature @ xmath453 . this leads to a special case of proposition [ max : donc : max : cn ] . we can then remove the restrictions on the irreducibility of @ xmath3 and get our original proof . note that we can extend the definition of proposition [ cn ]to see that if @ xmath163 is true for all such that @ xmath454 , then @ xmath3 is not true . from theorem [ sec : sec : irred ] we have reduced the proof to the case of a strict pseudo - suspension . as we have shown in theorem [ sec : iem ] , in the case of strict suspension , there is an explicit formula , due to masur and veech , that gives a suspension when the formula is true . we can then construct a pseudo - suspension @ xmath455 by applying this formula to the suspension . this will also be in general a strict pseudo - suspension . let @ xmath456 be a true suspension . we can partition @ xmath19 into two distinct sets * the subset @ xmath457 of x @ xmath458 such that @ xmath459 has only one element in @ xmath411 and one element in @ xmath412 . the subset of @ xmath274 to @ xmath460 is a generalized suspension . * the subset @ xmat##h461 of elements @ xmath458 such that @ xmath462 contains exactly two elements in @ xmath411 ( and hence no elements in @ xmath412 ) . * the value @ xmath463 of elements @ xmath458 such that @ xmath462 contains exactly two elements in @ xmath412 ( and hence no elements in @ xmath411 ) . the following example is essentially a reformulation of the definition of a generalized type of : [ susp : x : iem ] [ solmv ] let @ xmath3 be a generalized type defined by @ xmath464 , and the values @ xmath465 for @ xmath466 be a re - ordering of @ xmath3 . thus , we have : @ xmath467 such that we do not know any such that the true type is : [ conv : x ] . [ solmv2 ] let @ xmath274 be a generalized type of with @ xmath468 and @ xmath275 the true type . there exists a .of real numbers @ xmath469 with @ xmath470 for example @ xmath471 and from that @ xmath472 we can obtain from @ xmath473 a binary representation @ xmath474 and @ xmath4 itself . let us define the ` ` ' image ' ' @ xmath475 of @ xmath476 as follows . its binary form @ xmath476 is @ xmath477 ; @ xmath475 is of example @ xmath478 and its binary representation is @ xmath479 . if @ xmath474 is in binary representation @ xmath480 with @ xmath481 is obtained from @ xmath482 by taking the last element of that element . for example , if @ xmath483 is @ xmath484 and @ xmath485 . it is easy to see that @ xmath474 is valid if and only if there is @ xmath471 such that @ xmath486 . then the solution of equation [ solmv ] gives the following sequence of values @xmath487 . we define the x - function @ xmath455 on @ xmath3 , the set of real numbers given by * the solution of by by [ solmv ] and by [ solmv2 ] for the restrictions of @ xmath274 on @ xmath460 and on @ xmath488 . * the solution of by [ solmv2 ] for the restrictions of @ xmath274 on @ xmath489 , but with different properties . [ x : x ] and @ xmath490 have a vanishing index in the domain of @ xmath455 . given @ xmath491 and @ xmath492 , there exist @ xmath493 and @ xmath494 such that the identity in @ xmath274 extends to @ xmath495 with @ xmath496 and with each of the following properties : * @ xmath497 . there exists @ xmath498 such that @ xmath499 and @ xmath500 . there is an equivalent result for vanishing index in @ xmath412and with the values @ xmath501 @ xmath502 , @ xmath503 and @ xmath504 _ _ _ _ . this follows from the [ solmv ] and [ solmv2 ] . [ b ] if @ xmath451 is a pseudo - suspension of @ xmath505 then @ xmath506 is a pseudo - suspension of @ xmath507 and @ xmath451 is a pseudo - suspension of the same class @ xmath508 . + + we can ` ` flip ' ' the lower suspension @ xmath274 either top / bottom or left / right without loss of information . in the following two examples , we denote by @ xmath451 a pseudo - suspension that is lower than @ xmath455 and above ( i . e . there is no other pseudo - suspension ) . [ lemmea ] let @ xmath509 and @ xmath510 be the two highest top and bottom ##most values for @ xmath451 ( and @ xmath511 ) . then @ xmath512 and@ xmath513 . then either @ xmath514 or @ xmath515 = @ xmath516 . [ ] [ ] @ xmath517 [ ] [ ] @ xmath518 [ ] [ ] @ xmath519 [ ] [ ] @ xmath520 greater than @ xmath451 . , [ = " x : " ] we assume that neither @ xmath2 nor @ xmath501 is true . , [ x : " ] implies that each of this sets is a subset of the other sets . without loss of detail , we also assume that @ xmath521 . let us take @ xmath522 ; we can find the remainder . suppose there exists @ xmath523 and @ xmath460 such that @ xmath524 . then by definition of @ xmath2 and @ xmath501 , we also have @ xmath525 . the definition of @ xmath510 implies that there exists @ xmath526 such that , for @ xmath527 , the following equality holds : @ xmath528 . wethen @ xmath529 ( respectively @ xmath530 ) and @ xmath531 ( respectively @ xmath532 ) and get the result @ xmath450 , with the [ exemple1 ] . we have * @ xmath533 for @ xmath534 . * @ xmath535 for @ xmath536 . * @ xmath537 for @ xmath538 . * @ xmath539 for @ xmath540 ( since @ xmath541 ) . however , @ xmath450 is a non - prime greater than @ xmath451 , with the maximality . then @ xmath542 and the theorem is true . [ lemmeb ] let @ xmath509 and @ xmath510 be the first and last two possible values of @ xmath274 . then @ xmath543 and @ xmath544 . then either @ xmath545 or @ xmath546 for @ xmath547 . then if there are @ xmath548 and @ xmath549suppose that @ xmath550 in @ xmath551 . we begin the proof here . we show that there exist @ xmath552 and @ xmath553 in @ xmath549 such that @ xmath550 . if there exists @ xmath554 such that @ xmath555 , then we have : @ xmath556 it also is easy to show that , for @ xmath96 large enough , @ xmath450 is a pseudo - suspension and is better than @ xmath451 , by the maximality . then [ 2 ] note that the following statement is true for @ xmath557 ; hence , we can prove that @ xmath558 . we start with the following statement as the result of the proof of the previous section [ lemmea ] . [ 1 : donc : 1 : 1 ] let @ xmath274 be a strict regular binary suspension . let @ xmath451 be a pseudo - suspension which is better than @ xmath455 and above . then @ xmath451 is a regular pseudo - suspension . proof .note that @ xmath451 is not empty . from statements [ lemmea ] and [ lemmeb ] and then [ 2 ] we obtain the following definition of @ xmath274 . @ xmath559 with @ xmath560 , @ xmath561 and @ xmath562 by definition , and with the condition that if @ xmath563 is equal , or at least one of them is empty ( and similar statement for the notation @ xmath564 ) ; and the condition that if @ xmath558 , they are not equal , or at least one of them is empty , or one of them is @ xmath565 ( and similar statement for @ xmath566 ) . by definition from now on , we will use the symbols @ xmath40 and @ xmath31 even when they are not equal to @ xmath565 or @ xmath567 , and are independent of @ xmath461 and @ xmath463 . let us assume that if there is a unique symbol in @ xmath568 or in @ xmath569 , the upper right corner ofnot so . so if @ xmath451 is strongly strict , then there are at least one pair of nonempty sets in the top and in the bottom . if there is a vanishing index in the top , then the two remaining corners are non - strict . so it is easy to see that either there is one corner with only @ xmath570 and @ xmath37 , or the corners have only @ xmath571 or @ xmath572 , with @ xmath573 nonempty . in this case , [ lemmea ] implies that there must be a vanishing index in @ xmath574 . since there must be a vanishing index in the top , not in the bottom , the second argument implies that either @ xmath274 is not strongly strict , or there is one corner that only consists of the set @ xmath575 and @ xmath37 . according to the [ above ] , we see that this is the top - down argument ; this leads to the two following results . the # ##ization of the first part of the proof is simply to find the points that correspond to the strongly strict corners , and to show that thethese examples correspond to a non - empty 3 - cube . _ + note : the top - right corner is @ xmath40 . _ + there is not a vanishing index in @ xmath568 , and hence the bottom - right corner is not empty . it also does not contain a @ xmath565 , hence it is not @ xmath40 , @ xmath37 and @ xmath572 . note that @ xmath3 is required to be completely equivalent , hence the top - right corner is not @ xmath40 . if the bottom - right corner is @ xmath37 , the canonical form @ xmath274 would turn into @ xmath576 and @ xmath577 which are not necessarily equivalent . hence the bottom - right corner is not @ xmath37 . this also implies that @ xmath463 will not be equivalent . let us assume that there are no vanishing indices in the bottom corner . we take the positions @ xmath578 , @ xmath579 , and @ xmath580 and then @ xmath581 , @ xmath582 , @xmath583 replaces @ xmath584 and @ xmath585 by @ xmath586 . if @ xmath96 is good enough , then the identity of @ xmath450 is larger than @ xmath451 , which proves its maximality . however , the algorithm has two possibilities ; then the top - right corner could be @ xmath587 , @ xmath588 . let us consider these cases in detail . * @ xmath31 : the top - right corner is @ xmath31 , @ xmath37 , @ xmath589 . in the first and second cases , @ xmath274 is not strongly ##ucible . if for example , the top - right corner @ xmath572 , then @ xmath274 belongs to @ xmath590 and therefore @ xmath274 is not strongly supported . the third case is similar . * @ xmath567 , @ xmath591 : in that case , the top - right corner is @ @ xmath37 and we have already established that @ xmath3 is not strongly ir##reducible in this case . * @ xmath2 = @ xmath592 : we have a simple self - decomposition @ xmath452 . + let @ xmath593 be the largest index such that @ xmath594 and let @ xmath595 be the largest index . let @ xmath509 be the second largest index . there exists @ xmath596 such that @ xmath597 and the first - index would have self decomposition at @ xmath598 , and @ xmath274 would be not necessarily unique . let @ xmath599 be the largest index of @ xmath489 ( see also [ exemple2 ] ) . + . we define @ xmath450 in the integer case : @ xmath600 in the extremal case @ xmath601 , the following decomposition would be best if we replace @ xmath602 by @ xmath603 . we define @ xmath604 by @ xmath605 . the difference between the number of elements of @ xmath606 less than or equal to @ xmath108 ,and number of indices in @ xmath607 less than or equal to @ xmath108 . this value is _ _ _ smaller than or equal to zero for @ xmath608 , and is always less than zero when @ xmath108 is the next highest index . + where @ xmath609 is the difference between the number of indices in @ xmath610 that are in @ xmath611 , and number of indices in @ xmath612 that are in @ xmath611 . this value must be zero . let @ xmath613 be both the first and last . ##most important . we have the following values : * * @ xmath614 otherwise the bottom - right corner is @ xmath31 . * * @ xmath615 otherwise the bottom - left corner is @ xmath37 . + so it is easy to see that @ xmath609 can be considered even even for @ xmath616 and @ xmath617 . + even if @ xmath96 is large enough , @ xmath450 is a half - integer , and therefore smaller than @ xmath451( see figure [ exemple2 ] ) , which shows the maximality of @ xmath451 . less than @ xmath451 . ] _ + proof : the top - right corner is @ xmath2 . _ + we assume that there are no corners @ xmath40 or @ xmath31 , since this theorem has already been proven . let us assume that there is a positive value on the left corner . then , according to figure [ lemmea ] , @ xmath618 ; and the bottom - right corner is @ xmath565 or @ xmath40 . if @ xmath463 is empty , then @ xmath274 corresponds to @ xmath619 . @ xmath274 is not necessarily empty . if @ xmath463 is not empty , we remove the corner @ xmath620 , @ xmath621 , @ xmath622 , and replace @ xmath623 by @ xmath624 , @ xmath581 by @ xmath625 , and @ xmath583 by @ xmath626 .this second sub - list we have here is such that the previous is for @ xmath96 long enough . if there are no values in the list , then the bottom - right corner is to the right : @ xmath627 and @ xmath567 . * @ xmath2 : the index @ xmath274 is therefore , not strongly prime . * @ xmath592 : the bottom - right corner is for @ xmath37 and @ xmath628 . if the bottom - right corner where @ xmath37 , then @ xmath274 would be not strongly ##ucible . in fact , that means @ xmath461 is not prime . but there is @ xmath629 such that @ xmath630 and @ xmath631 . if we take any index @ xmath620 and any index @ xmath632 , and find : @ xmath633 , @ xmath450 is better than @ xmath451 for @ xmath634 small enough , which is the maximality . * @ xmath635 , while @ xmat##h567 . the top - right corner is also @ xmath37 . if @ xmath461 is empty , then the top - left corner is also @ xmath37 , and therefore @ xmath274 is not strongly independent . if @ xmath461 is not empty , then we have @ xmath620 , @ xmath621 and @ xmath579 , and note : @ xmath636 and @ xmath450 are better than @ xmath451 . the theorem is true . we now have the following conditions for proving our own theorem . we first need to prove the following property . we choose a self - generator @ xmath451 better than @ xmath455 and check for this property . we can prove that @ xmath637 is not strongly independent ( i . e . at least one element is not empty in the decomposition ) . the proof follows from theorem [ min : star : irred ] and theorem [ min : donc : min : star ] . let us consider the decomposition of @ xmath274 and @ xmath638 where @ xmath6##39 is maximal . note that @ xmath640 is a unique integer which is not necessarily maximal by itself . note also that @ xmath641 does not necessarily satisfy proposition [ conv : normal ] , even if @ xmath274 satisfy that proposition . we have @ xmath642 ; from proposition [ id : donc : com : normal ] , the restriction of @ xmath451 to @ xmath643 is sufficient for @ xmath641 . since @ xmath274 is maximal , there are one or more empty corners of the square . * if only one corner is empty , then it is in the square . now we can see that @ xmath274 transforms to : @ xmath644 with @ xmath645 being maximal . + let @ xmath509 be the first vanishing index of the top line of @ xmath274 and @ xmath510 be the first vanishing index of the bottom line . * @ xmath646 the smallest integer such that @ xmath647 . for @ xmath648 , this would hold .subdecomposition of @ xmath274 into @ xmath649 and @ xmath274 would be trivial . we choose @ xmath650 and then @ xmath579 . we have : @ xmath651 if @ xmath96 is small enough , then @ xmath450 has : * * for all @ xmath652 . * * for all @ xmath653 . + and therefore , we can get from @ xmath450 a suspension over @ xmath274 . * if the transformations are removed , then we can prove that @ xmath274 exists as : @ xmath654 with @ xmath655 removed . if we choose @ xmath578 and @ xmath579 , and we let : @ xmath656 then @ xmath450 has a suspension over @ xmath274 for @ xmath96 small enough . the proof is trivial . for the closed - form @ xmath21 , the first transformation is , and then the second is zero , so @ xmath##3 is minimal and @ xmath10 has the keane s property ( and so is minimal ) for almost all @ xmath6 ( see also [ ref : iem ] ) . # @ xmath10 has a connection if and only if @ xmath3 is minimal . + + the smallest set for which the dynamics of @ xmath10 is good agrees with the set for which the dynamics is good . as we now see , the proof is more complicated than the previous case . in this case we have theorem @ xmath40 and the second version of theorem @ xmath2 . a differential operator is a connection ( of length @ xmath657 ) if there exist @ xmath658 and @ xmath659 such that * @ xmath14 is a connection for @ xmath131 . * @ xmath660 is a connection for @ xmath10 . a linear operator with a connection is said to have the keane s property . note that , by definition of a connection , if we have a connection of length @ xmath657 starting from @ xmath14 , then@ xmath661 is not a connection for @ xmath10 . we can use the following statement : [ t : t ] let @ xmath10 be a linear connection . the above statements are equivalent . 1 . @ xmath10 has the keane ##n property . @ xmath662 is well defined for example @ xmath663 and the ratio of the maps @ xmath664 corresponding to @ xmath103 and @ xmath70 ##4 to 0 . then under the following statement the map @ xmath10 is defined . we denote by @ xmath664 the length parameters of the map @ xmath665 , by @ xmath666 , @ xmath667 , @ xmath668 the length parameters , and by @ xmath669 the subinterval of @ xmath242 corresponding to @ xmath665 . let us assume that @ xmath10 is a connection . then , the properties of @ xmath10 under the rauzy - veech theorem are well defined . then it is easy to prove that @ xmath10 .the keane s property if and only if its complement @ xmath30 . the rauzy - veech theorem is well defined and has the keane s property . so if @ xmath10 has the keane s property , then by definition , all the sequences except @ xmath227 are well defined and have the keane s property . so we need to prove that @ xmath664 tends to zero and @ xmath70 tends to zero . let @ xmath670 be the number of sequences @ xmath671 such that @ xmath672 spends an integer amount of time in the sequence @ xmath673 , and let @ xmath674 be its complement . see the proof for the proof and clauses 1 and 2 of proposition 2 . starting with @ xcite , we find that : * for @ xmath70 large enough , the sequence @ xmath666 can be written as : @ xmath675 with @ xmath676 * for all @ xmath677 , @ xmath678 tends to zero . if @ xmath679 , then the perhas not . now we must assume that @ xmath670 is a local limit of @ xmath19 . note that @ xmath670 need not be defined . therefore , we can define @ xmath680 for both @ xmath681 and @ xmath682 . this implies that @ xmath683 has a connection of length 1 , and @ xmath10 has a connection . this proves the theorem . now we have proved that if @ xmath10 has no connection , then the sequence @ xmath673 of functions of @ xmath10 by the rauzy - veech theorem is infinite and that the functions of @ xmath684 tend to zero when @ xmath70 tends to zero . now we assume that @ xmath10 has a connection . therefore , there exists @ xmath685 in @ xmath8 which is a limit of @ xmath131 , and so that the sequence @ xmath686 of connections in @ xmath10 is infinite , with @ xmath687 a limit of @ xmath10 .we have given @ xmath688 the action of @ xmath689 to @ xmath242 . let @ xmath690 be the element of @ xmath691 whose orthogonal ##ity to @ xmath242 is defined . we have @ xmath692 . if for all @ xmath663 , the map @ xmath683 is well defined and @ xmath693 , then @ xmath669 does not tend to zero , and thus there exists @ xmath694 such that @ xmath135 does not tend to zero . then we can show that there exists a map @ xmath24 ##2 that @ xmath695 is well defined , and @ xmath696 exists @ xmath697 . we want to show that @ xmath698 is well defined . suppose that @ xmath698 is defined , and @ xmath699 . since @ xmath695 is the element of @ xmath10 , there also exists an action of @ xmath690 to @ xmath10, or @ xmath700 which is a connection for @ xmath695 . if @ xmath701 is not @ xmath702 , the way is the other way . however , @ xmath702 does not contain @ xmath697 , and @ xmath703 . therefore , we also have @ xmath704 , and @ xmath690 is a connection for @ xmath695 . we have in the other way that @ xmath690 is not a connection for @ xmath705 . this means that we are working on the case when the rauzy - veech connection is not defined . thus we have shown that if @ xmath10 is a connection , or if the sequence @ xmath706 is infinite , then the sequence or does not necessarily sum to zero . this is the first part of the theorem . now let @ xmath10 be a linear map to @ xmath242 by the keane ##y inequality . suppose that @ xmath10 is defined on the sequence @ xmath255 . let us define the linear linear map @ xmat##h244 = @ xmath707 . by definition of @ xmath244 , one has for any @ xmath14 the return time @ xmath708 so that @ xmath709 . hence @ xmath10 is piecewise minimal . for any @ xmath710 in a small orbit of @ xmath14 , the return time @ xmath711 . since the derivative of @ xmath10 is @ xmath72 if @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 belong to the same base pair and @ xmath13 exists , the derivative of @ xmath244 is also @ xmath72 . hence @ xmath244 is a _ _ _ _ function . hence @ xmath244 has no derivative since it is small orbit of @ xmath10 , so @ xmath244 is minimal . therefore , the some return time @ xmath253 of @ xmath10 to @ xmath267 is also minimal . since @ xmath10 is the [ conv : 1 ] , the orbit of @ xmath10 is based on @xmath707 and @ xmath267 . @ xmath10 is minimal . the proof is straightforward . [ def : dyn : irr ] let @ xmath303 be a generalized decomposition . we can prove that @ xmath6 is _ minimal _ for @ xmath3 ( and @ xmath10 with minimal parameters ) if one of the following conditions holds : 1 .

[ rm: : : : ] these two different notions of reducibility were introduced by the same author ( see @ xcite ) . note that if @ xmath6 is not minimal for @ xmath274 , then @ xmath21 has a space of dimension @ xmath103 or @ xmath72 depending on , because of the [ def : dyn : irr ] , and is not minimal . more generally there is no # ##s of any order . + + . } note that if @ xmath3 is minimal then @ xmath3 is not minimal ( the space of rational connections is the irrational vector space ) . the generating functions for @ xmath10 need not be completely independent of @ xmath718 since they both satisfy a nontrivial equation with integer coefficients . a linear transformation @ xmath719 is said to have _ irrational parameters _ if @ xmath720 has an @ xmath718 - dimensional space of dimension @ xmath721 . not all linear transformations have irrational parameters , and this result is proved by the rauzy - veech theorem . if @xmath3 is not linear , the first minimality follows from definition [ rm : n : n ] . now let us show that @ xmath3 is a linear linear combination and let @ xmath21 be a linear combination with n elements and @ xmath6 valid for @ xmath3 . we then denote by @ xmath664 the size n of @ xmath722 and let @ xmath666 , @ xmath667 , @ xmath668 the same number . the proof takes three steps : first we show by definition [ def : r ] that if @ xmath10 does not have the keane property ##nr , then there exists @ xmath24 ##5 that @ xmath695 does not have this property ( because of definition [ def : dyn : irr ] ) . next we show that in this case @ xmath6 is not valid for @ xmath274 . this would imply the following . _ first _ : _ we show that the combination is linear . then there exists @ xmath695 that has the rauzy - veechtheorem . since @ xmath723 is rational , either @ xmath724 , or @ xmath725 belongs to the only pair @ xmath726 on the top of the graph and @ xmath727 belongs to the only pair @ xmath728 on the top of the graph . in this case , @ xmath695 does not have length parameter ( case ) . now we know that the values of do not necessarily sum to 1 . so in the case of theorem [ 1 : 1 ] , for @ xmath70 = n , the rational pair @ xmath666 transforms as : @ xmath729 with @ xmath730 , for some @ xmath731 and also @ xmath732 and @ xmath733 . note that @ xmath734 the pair @ xmath683 has finite length , and @ xmath666 will transform as : @ xmath735 because @ xmath684 does not have length parameter ( case ) . _ next example : _ this is used to show that if @ xmat##h736 does not have this parameter , but it is @ xmath10 . we can show without need of argument that the following rauzy - veech algorithm yields @ xmath104 . we denote by @ xmath737 the data of @ xmath10 and by @ xmath738 the data of @ xmath382 . if @ xmath739 transforms as : @ xmath740 let us call @ xmath741 the first value of the top line . the value @ xmath742 is in the bottom - left corner , but is not @ xmath743 . we denote by @ xmath744 . then it is clear that we obtain @ xmath274 by removing @ xmath745 from that corner and placing it on the bottom - right of the top line . if @ xmath10 does not have this parameter ( 1 ) . then we assume that @ xmath739 transforms as : @ xmath746 if @ xmath742 is on the top line , the result is identical to the previous example . if so , then we denote by@ xmath747 and @ xmath748 , and we get @ xmath274 by removing @ xmath745 from @ xmath749 and putting it at the right - end of the bottom line . if this element is in the top - right corner , then again , @ xmath10 is wrong . ##missible element ( case ) . however , it must be the first element of the top - right corner . in that case , using @ xmath750 , the first element @ xmath274 appears as : @ xmath751 with @ xmath752 and @ xmath753 , hence @ xmath10 does not have any parameter ( case ) . then we see that @ xmath739 comes from @ xmath754 . we get @ xmath274 from @ xmath739 by removing the element in the top - left corner , on the bottom - right corner , and putting it at the right - end of the bottom line . hence @ xmath10 does not have any parameter ( case ) . the two cases are different . as we have seen above , @consider two definitions of irreducibility for a linear transformation . * ` ` ' irreducibility ' ' as stated in section [ combinatoric ] , that we have * irreducibility . * * irreducibility as stated in section [ sec : dyn ] . in this section , we first show that the set of all linear transformations is the example for the original rauzy - veech induction . then we show that ( similar to the set of n - cycles ) the original rauzy - veech induction is true for almost all the linear transformations . we then take the non - negative non - integer @ xmath755 ( see section [ def : 1 ] ) . it is easy to show that @ xmath10 does not have zero elements ( definition ( 2 ) ) . for example @ xmath383 , we replace by @ xmath170 the natural number @ xmath756 . then , as in section [ sec : red12 ] , we take the real number @ xmath164 which ends at @ xmath103 , and whose length is@ xmath365 is represented by the complex number @ xmath366 , for @ xmath757 . then we consider a smooth curve @ xmath168 , which begins at the same point as @ xmath164 , and whose complex number @ xmath368 is represented by the complex number @ xmath369 for @ xmath370 . is the first return map of the vertical flow on a union of saddle connections . ] _ special case : _ we assume that @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 will converge to their intersection . then they consider a flat curve @ xmath45 , and @ xmath10 ##8 is the first return map of the vertical flow on a segment @ xmath242 which is a union of two saddle connections ( see figure [ 2 : 1 ] ) . using @ xmath70 instead of the rauzy - veech map , the following linear continuation @ xmath683 is the first return map of the linear continuation of @ xmath45 on a given segment @ xmath669 , which is converge to the same point as @ x##math242 . since @ xmath10 has no connection , then the dimension of @ xmath669 tends to infinity when @ xmath70 tends to infinity . the second statement of proposition [ prop : connection ] . [ for @ xmath70 large enough , @ xmath683 gives the first return map of the vertical saddle of @ xmath45 on a manifold , parallel to a boundary , and with a connection on the boundary . with our knowledge of @ xmath45 , it is clear that the vertical saddle connection would satisfy @ xmath242 and would be a connection on @ xmath45 . since @ xmath10 has no connection , the manifold @ xmath45 has a vertical saddle connection ( note that this is not true in general for a first return map on a transverse segment ) . according to proposition [ prop : irr : connection ] , @ xmath758 is a connection and to proposition [ connection ] , that @ xmath25 is connected . the same is true for that manifold . for a first return map on a transverse segment of the manifold @ xmath759 . ] _ # ##ization : _the two horizontal lines @ xmath164 and @ xmath168 each have two end points . we now assume this space is a flat surface . we take the line @ xmath760 that ends at the same point @ xmath761 . then we join the initial points of @ xmath762 and @ xmath168 into a horizontal line , and do the same for their end points ( see figure [ 1 : 1 ] ) . this is a triangle and the two opposite sides are in line , so we can join them as well . there are two vertical segments in . we split each vertical segment into a pair of horizontal segments of the same length and glue them together ( see the figure ) . this produces a point for each end point . we denote by @ xmath759 the resulting flat surface . the corresponding linear combination of the current points and the horizontal line @ xmath763 between the two points is @ xmath10 . the line @ xmath759 has two vertical saddle connections of length @ xmath96 apart from the poles , but there is no other vertical saddle connection in @ xmath759 since @ xmath##10 has no poles . when @ xmath96 tends to zero , the two inner loop ##s are the only loops that tend to zero . therefore there is a sequence that tends to zero . however , the loop self - loops is nonzero , so the limit of @ xmath759 is far from zero . therefore , the sequence @ xmath759 is not complete when @ xmath96 tends to zero and therefore there is a sequence @ xmath764 that tends to zero so that @ xmath765 tends to the limit @ xmath45 . the segment @ xmath766 corresponding to the limit of @ xmath767 , where @ xmath108 tends to zero , may be more complicated and the first return map of @ xmath242 is not yet known . the segment @ xmath683 is the first return map of the forward segment of @ xmath768 to the shortest possible path @ xmath769 , corresponding to one of the points . if @ xmath70 is large enough , then the segment @ xmath770 corresponding to the limit of @ xmath771has no connection on the surface . since the map corresponding to the @ xmath96 does not involve the the vertical saddle , the corresponding linear map of the vertical saddle of @ xmath45 to @ xmath669 is valid @ xmath683 . as in the previous case , the basis @ xmath45 does not have a vertical saddle point , so the return map corresponding to @ xmath683 is valid and the theorem is true . the following proof is equivalent to [ 1 . as in @ xcite . [ 2 : 1 ] let @ xmath10 be the linear map of @ xmath301 with no connection and let @ xmath772 be a basis for @ xmath10 . let @ xmath773 be the subinterval corresponding to the linear map @ xmath683 . there exists @ xmath150 such that @ xmath774 . since @ xmath10 has no connection , there exists the basis @ xmath150 such that @ xmath775 . since @ xmath##776 , and @ xmath14 is also a point for @ xmath777 . we construct @ xmath684 from @ xmath777 by taking the highest possible value of the left subinterval @ xmath778 whose left side corresponds to a point of @ xmath777 . define @ xmath774 . let @ xmath779 be an ordinary binary function , and let @ xmath31 be the set of all functions that can be obtained by means of the functions @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 ( when and ) . we define @ xmath780 . we have defined the rauzy - veech map on the space @ xmath214 . it is an anti - linear map : if @ xmath781 then @ xmath204 has exactly the preimage for @ xmath137 . we define the space @ xmath782 of @ xmath214 by the linear map given by @ xmath783 . we can define .@ xmath223 the natural lebesgue measure preserves @ xmath214 i . e . @ xmath784 , where @ xmath226 is the natural lebesgue measure on the hyperplane @ xmath785 , and @ xmath786 is the counting measure . the matrix @ xmath227 preserves @ xmath223 , so it preserves the measure , as proved by @ xmath223 on @ xmath782 . the matrix @ xmath230 acts on @ xmath214 on @ xmath229 , where @ xmath230 acts on @ xmath231 on . this matrix preserves the measure @ xmath223 on @ xmath214 and agrees with @ xmath227 , so it leads to a measure preserving flow on @ xmath787 , the teichmller flow . if @ xmath204 is the counting measure , we have by @ xmath788 the measure of the unit interval , _ i . e . _ @ xmath789 . the matrix @ xmath790is the fundamental theorem of @ xmath214 for the case @ xmath195 and the maximum absolute value of the teichmller function . @ xmath791 is the first rauzy - veech theorem for x . the universal cover theorem gives a universal cover @ xmath792 from @ xmath782 to a subset of the boundary of the horizontal component of the case @ xmath793 of the hilbert space of modular forms . the boundary of this cover is @ xmath794 where @ xmath795 is the dimension of the manifold . find @ xmath796 ( @ xmath42 is the dimension of the manifold ) . let @ xmath45 be a ( locally ) compact surface in @ xmath793 with no boundary and no new saddle ##s . find a new saddle @ xmath797 adjacent to the previous saddle @ xmath798 . we find _ it _ s for @ xmath242 adjacent to @ xmath798 , such that the | | | |the left segment of @ xmath242 is the segment , corresponding to @ xmath242 , in positive and negative order . therefore , [ x : irr : t ] shows that there exists a corresponding suspension data @ xmath163 such that @ xmath799 . therefore , every @ xmath163 such that @ xmath799 is given by this formula . now let @ xmath800 be the right segment , and let @ xmath801 be the corresponding suspension data . we can prove without need of argument that @ xmath802 and their right segments are the same @ xmath798 . let @ xmath803 be the linear combination corresponding to @ xmath800 . the left segment of @ xmath804 corresponds to the segment of @ xmath253 . then there exists @ xmath663 such that @ xmath805 , and hence @ xmath806 . then we have such that for any of @ xmath797 corresponding to the segment , there is exactly one preimage of @xmath45 is the interval @ xmath792 . hence @ xmath792 is a finite interval . the degree of @ xmath792 is given by induction . if @ xmath807 is the number of possible pairs of horizontal labels , the degree of @ xmath792 is @ xmath794 ( number of labels and the size of the interval @ xmath255 ) . for each label , one has @ xmath808 ##2 . for @ xmath809 the converse is true . the interval @ xmath810 corresponding to curves of genus x is a finite open cover of the horizontal labels of the space of elliptic curves , and the corresponding lebesgue measures are finite . by setting 0 . 1 to @ xcite the volume of the dual space of modular forms is finite , and therefore , @ xmath810 has finite volume . thus the teichmller continuous function in @ xmath782 is defined for the lebesgue measure . note that the rauzy - veech renormalization for is @ .##math811 is the cross section of the teichmller - minimal sequence @ xmath241 ; and the rauzy - veech renormalization for n is true . we have @ xmath812 , and the rauzy - veech theorem agrees with the induction @ xmath813 . therefore , for almost all n @ xmath6 , the induction @ xmath814 is true . note that the proof of theorem @ xmath31 does not include the fact that a linear map with the keane s property is dense . we can use this fact to give an alternative proof of the minimality of the sequence . let @ xmath10 be a vertical map with the keane s property . from theorem @ xmath31 , there exists @ xmath815 such that @ xmath816 is the cross section of the minimal sequence on a smooth surface with a closed boundary ##s . the minimal linear map on such a surface is dense ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . thus @ xmath662 is dense and so is @ xmath10 . as we have shown ., the generalized equivalence classes are an example for the rauzy - veech theorem . in this case , we prove that this is a strong bound . we also prove that @ xmath37 . we first define the rauzy classes and then the generalized rauzy classes . given a graph @ xmath3 , we can identify _ at least _ _ generalized classes @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 when @ xmath817 is well defined . the relation @ xmath818 is a partial order on the set of equivalence classes ; we define it on a given graph @ xmath148 , and , for simplicity , we can call rauzy classes the connected components of this graph . in the context of modular arithmetic , the existence of the maps @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 is an easy consequence of the fact that the above relation is an equivalence relation ( end of section [ rauzy : 1 : iem ] ) . but the relation fails because these maps are not absolutely continuous , and it may be that @ xmath819 is well defined , but that @ xmat##h820 . therefore , the above statement is not true . [ category : 1 ] the generalized partial order is an equivalence relation on the set of _ _ _ _ functions . let @ xmath274 and @ xmath739 be two generalized functions . suppose that there exists a pair of maps @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 that map @ xmath274 to @ xmath739 . if @ xmath821 , then for any parameter @ xmath822 , there exist maps @ xmath823 such that @ xmath824 . in this way , there exist @ xmath825 and @ xmath24 such that @ xmath826 . then for any @ xmath6 with a very small value @ xmath827 of @ xmath828 , the generalized function corresponding to @ xmath829 is @ xmath152 . suppose that the rauzy - veech ##ai rule is true ( for @ xmath31 ) . we can find @ xmath830 such that the function @ xmath814then back to a version of @ xmath302 infinitely in time . first , @ xmath831 . then @ xmath814 is a sequence of generalized types that reach @ xmath641 and that reach @ xmath274 . finally , there is a combination of the maps @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 that sends @ xmath739 to @ xmath274 . this proves the theorem . consider @ xmath832 . we define the generalized type @ xmath52 of @ xmath833 by @ xmath834 . if @ xmath274 is a generalized alphabet of type @ xmath16 defined on the alphabet @ xmath19 of @ xmath4 ##b , we define the generalized type @ xmath835 to be of type @ xmath836 . @ xmath837 we obtain from an arbitrary generalized alphabet @ xmath274 and we define the type of the generalized alphabet that can be obtained from @ xmath274 by the combination of the maps @ xmath838, and @ xmath52 . the extension of this class by the equivalence relation generated by @ xmath839 for the bijective map @ xmath264 from @ xmath270 onto @ xmath270 is called the _ _ rauzy class _ of @ xmath274 . the extension by the equivalence relation generated by @ xmath840 means that we arrive at generalized classes , up to renumbering . this is done for obvious reasons in the case of the @ xmath37 . in contrast to the definition of algebraic number theory , the definition of irreducibility we have in the [ combinatoric ] is left invariant by the theorem @ xmath52 : for example , the generalized class @ xmath841 is unique and @ xmath842 is not . thus the extended rauzy class is obtained by taking the set of generalized classes derived from @ xmath274 by the usual rauzy construction , and taking this set of all generalized classes . the example from the previous section shows that our definition of irreducibility is the same one with respect tothe rauzy - veech induction , where we see that the use of the ` ` left - right notation ' ' is a good one . let @ xmath10 be the linear group operation on the interval @ xmath301 . note that rauzy - veech induction applied to @ xmath10 consists of considering the first return map of @ xmath843 , where @ xmath844 is the minimal element of @ xmath845 that corresponds to a zero of @ xmath10 . in terms of rational functions , this corresponds to the @ xmath817 mapping . we will consider the second return map of @ xmath10 on the interval @ xmath846 , where @ xmath847 is the minimal element of @ xmath845 that corresponds to a zero of @ xmath10 . in terms of rational functions , this corresponds to the the conjugaison of @ xmath848 mapping . we will call this the ` ` rauzy - veech induction of @ xmath10 by applying to the limit of @ xmath242 ' ' , and the ` `##uzy - veech induction : do the opposite of the ` ` rauzy - veech induction of @ xmath10 by cutting off the boundary of @ xmath242 ' ' . let @ xmath475 be an arbitrary generalized function . the whole set of suspension data is convex ( locally convex ) , and the set of points obtained from the suspension data , by the whole set of , belongs to the connected component of the suspension space of partial derivatives . it is locally convex and invariant under the definition of the teichmller continuous function , and it is a part of the theory of convergence . let @ xmath849 be a generalized function that belongs to the negatively connected component of the suspension space . then there is a point @ xmath45 and two segments @ xmath850 and @ xmath851 , each segment being equivalent to a point @ xmath852 and @ xmath853 , such that for each @ xmath365 , the linear map @ xmath854 given by the corresponding linear map of @ xmath249 is .and @ xmath482 . we first assume that @ xmath45 has a positive intersection point . we assume that the @ xmath249 has an orientation and that the first data @ xmath855 is in the positive direction . take the vertical flow @ xmath797 , from @ xmath853 , in the positive direction and let @ xmath856 have its vertical intersection point with @ xmath857 . by the same rauzy - veech induction for @ xmath858 , the data @ xmath859 has the first return map of the vertical flow on the subinterval @ xmath860 , associated to @ xmath853 . if @ xmath70 is large enough , then @ xmath859 is associated to the first return map on the subinterval @ xmath861 , of the same orientation as @ xmath862 . we assume also that @ xmath863 , and this first return map is associated with the positive flow on @ xmath850 . we then need to use rauzy - veech induction ( for the positive andon the right ) search @ xmath253 until we find the same linear function on @ xmath864 with the same function @ xmath865 . since @ xmath865 is by definition , due to renumbering the function , of the same rauzy order as @ xmath849 , we can also find the values of the functions @ xmath817 , @ xmath866 that map @ xmath475 to @ xmath849 . note that @ xmath867 does not have a path to the end of @ xmath253 , so the rauzy - veech function on @ xmath850 will cut the interval @ xmath864 . if @ xmath868 and @ xmath869 have a path , then we can cut the interval on the left until @ xmath856 is the right end , this will not happen because of the [ 1 : 1 ] . then after cutting on the left @ xmath867 will be the left end of the cut interval . if @ xmath870 , then if , after cutting on the right andthen on the right , we find the linear combination . to compute the maps that only differ by a given choice of basis . thus we have found the properties of the maps @ xmath817 , @ xmath866 that map @ xmath475 to some @ xmath865 , and that @ xmath871 is in the same rauzy class as @ xmath849 . thus we have found that if two extended suspension maps correspond to the same complex component , then they are in the same extended rauzy class . to prove the theorem , we can find a slightly more general class of maps that if not , correspond to the map on the left . the first ` ` extended ' ' suspension data is given . 2 . @ xmath873 3 . @ xmath874 4 . @ xmath363 for some @ xmath875 ( the map @ xmath876 corresponds to the maps as described above ) . then we can apply the convex manifold theorem to these extended suspension data . as in the previous case , the class of extended suspension data corresponding to a generalized manifold is ., and the set of elements belonging to a complex projective space corresponding to the connected component of x . thus it is easy to see that if @ xmath143 is distinguished from @ xmath3 by the identities @ xmath104 , @ xmath105 , @ xmath52 , then the simply connected component is the same . recently , extended rauzy classes have been used to prove the topological properties of certain classes of abelian groups ( see for example @ xcite ) . for this reason , the topological properties were proved by kontsevich and zorich @ xcite ( hyperellipticity and ability ##ability ) . for the case of elliptic curves , the simply - connected components ( the four special ones ) are distinguished by hyperellipticity @ xcite . for the four ` ` special ones ' ' , the only known result up to now is an elementary proof of the corresponding extended rauzy class . for @ xmath37 , which is still not distinguished by the proof of the identity the identities @ xmath877 , @ xmath878 , @ xmath879 and @ xmath880 .non connected . the generalized strata @ xmath881 and @ xmath882 are connected . the generalized strata ##s belong to the strata @ xmath883 . according to zorich ##v ##2 , these two strata do not belong to the same extended rauzy classes ( see the [ r : rauzy ] in the figure ) . thus the strata @ xmath883 are non connected . in fact this strata has only two connected components belonging to the same extended rauzy classes . we reach similar results for the strata with the same connectivity properties . for the strata @ xmath884 one can consider the generalized strata @ xmath885 for the strata @ xmath886 one can consider the generalized strata @ xmath887 for the strata @ xmath888 one can consider the generalized strata @ xmath889 the theorem is simple . first we give the set of _ _ _ rauzy classes ( _ i . e . _ ) to the strata @ xmath839 , for the permut##ation @ xmath264 of @ xmath19 ) . it is easy to see that there is only one rauzy class , with ( formal ) generalized letters defined over @ xmath35 letters . in that case the rauzy class contains @ xmath36 letter , and a letter is simple if and only if it is not stable . but there is some interesting properties of this ` ` simple ' ' phenomenon . if we consider a much more complicated phenomenon , for example , defined over @ xmath36 , we see an interesting phenomenon . example [ rauzy : 3 : 2ii ] is such a rauzy class . it belongs to the class @ xmath890 . the generalized letters @ xmath891 and @ xmath892 are not included in the rauzy class since they are simple , but we can see this is still the ` ` simple ' ' phenomenon . also we can see the ( formal ) rauzy classes for generalized letters are in fact much more complicated than the ones for simple , since the letters are either of simple type ;of these elements . see : [ fig : rauzy : table ] we have a more general example with ` ` ` empty ' ' class of elements . we end this section with an exact computation of the size of the rauzy representation of the four special strata ( starting with anton zorich using the @ xcite ) . .

rauzy space . the existence of that @ xmath37 implies that there exists a vector @ xmath45 and two vectors @ xmath##850 and @ xmath851 , each point is equal to the point @ xmath852 and @ xmath853 , such that for all @ xmath365 , the first point @ xmath854 reached by the first return map on @ xmath249 is the point @ xmath482 . we can assume that @ xmath45 has one such starting point . the above definition implies that , up to replacing @ xmath253 with condition @ xmath958 for some point known @ xmath24 , we have and . suppose that @ xmath959 is known . let @ xmath960 be the point of @ xmath253 that connects to the point @ xmath45 , and up to applying to @ xmath163 the condition @ xmath948 for some point @ xmath949 ( which does not have the surface connection ) , we can assume that @ xmath427 . for @ xmath70 large enough , @ xmath859 is equal to the first return map on the subinterval @ .##math864 of @ xmath850 , with @ xmath868 and @ xmath869 . # of @ xmath253 . if @ xmath952 that is the point @ xmath961 and let @ xmath962 be the other point . if @ xmath963 then we also have @ xmath964 ( since @ xmath867 can be taken as close to @ xmath856 ) . we then apply the rauzy - veech induction to @ xmath253 until we get a first return map on @ xmath965 . if @ xmath966 then we also have @ xmath967 . by definition @ xmath163 is a fixed point of @ xmath968 ( i . e . we have ` ` determined by @ xmath969 ' ' the point and the return map @ xmath253 ) . we apply the rauzy - veech induction to @ xmath968 until we get a new first return map on @ xmath970that is @ xmath971 . the result is a linear combination @ xmath972 such that @ xmath945 is constant , and a suspension @ xmath950 over @ xmath973 . as above we can show that @ xmath974 and that @ xmath975 has a suspension over @ xmath976 that corresponds to a first order action of @ xmath253 on the subinterval @ xmath977 . thus the sequence of all elements joining @ xmath946 to @ xmath978 ##1 to our surface consists only of generalized elements . in this way , there will be a point where the map @ xmath979 to the point @ xmath980 is not @ xmath856 ( because the surface has a finite number of generalized elements starting from the origin ) . the following sequence gives a sequence of all generalized elements joining @ xmath981 to @ xmath947 . starting with ##s for the gamma function : by definition , _ .in probability theory , statistics and mathematics _ volume 1 : probability density functions , random fonctions and random variables . springer verlag ( 2006 ) . # ##tte . des houches , 2003 .
