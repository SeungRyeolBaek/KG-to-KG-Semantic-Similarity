a new idea about the applications of topological superconductors to quantum information processing has attracted both theoretical and experimental attention @ xcite . according to this idea , a quantum computing device , qubit , can be created and processed by means of a computer ( see , for e . g . , etc . ) , located at the end of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) wire in a topological superconductor @ xcite . several models suggest possible modes ##s of forming a localized mode @ xcite such as the formation of a localized mode in the electric current through a topological superconductor ( s ) - n semiconductor ( s ) junction and the reduction of the josephson current in s - n - n junction . all known localized systems of 1d semiconductor ##s have been found to have such modes ; the mechanism of the formation of these modes results from the interaction of the soi , field - effect superconducting field , electric current and weak nuclear force in these systems @ xcite . the localized modes of the josephson current , induced by two topological semiconductor ##s in one - dimensional superconducting nanowires separated by distance , are involved in splitting of the lowest energy state . this splitting isdepends not only on the phase difference of the two superconductors but also on the relative orientation of the spin axis at the opposite ends of the junction . the existence of a josephson current in two different superconductors separated by semiconductor or oxide as a function of their phase difference , with @ xmath9 current instead of the usual @ xmath10 current due to conservation of spin , was demonstrated by kitaev @ xcite for a theoretical example of an 1d spinless s - type superconductor . confirming this , kwon _ et al _ . @ xcite showed that the same phenomenon can be observed in quasi - 1d and quasi - superconducting tunnel ##ing systems where the superconductors are separated by an electronic barrier , and separated by a plane - wave interface . these junctions do not exhibit soi or magnetic fields ; tunnel - ing effects arise in such systems from the random motion of the tunnel ##s . later it was shown in j . that a variant of the usual josephson current results from both a large josephson current , @ xmath11 , and the presence of a high voltage @ xmath12 due to the2 . these results have been interpreted in terms of the josephson effect being mediated by electrons rather than lone pairs @ xcite . subsequently , it was predicted that a induced josephson effect would be observed at a junction edge @ xcite . this prediction has since been generalized to other edges @ xcite . recent experiments have shown that a topological junction with temperature - dependence similar to a p - type superconductor has a matter - matter interaction @ xcite , explaining the observed interaction not only with superconducting temperature , but also with the variation of the magnetic field . in this case , the magnetic field on one side of the interface is in the direction opposite to the direction of the external magnetic field of the soi ; therefore , the non - induced josephson current changes by with @ xmath13 variation of the magnetic field , and produces a with @ xmath9 or ##ity - josephson effect in response to variation of the magnetic field induced at the other junction edge @ xcite . moreover , a dissipationless induced josephson current caused by with @ xmath14 variation has been also predicted @ xcite at the interface ofsee bose - einstein effect . the josephson effect in terms of both superconducting ( s ) and magnetic ( n ) regions , has been studied by @ xcite . these results also show the existence of large black holes located in s - type regions , and a strong josephson effect with @ xmath9 and @ xcite . these previous works in the field have pointed out the importance of the magnetic josephson and the bose - josephson effect in 1d superconducting devices located on the surface of a hall semiconductor . however , the role of spin - orbit coupling and the external magnetic field in these phenomena has not been fully studied in these previous works . now , this study is the main focus of the current research . to this end , we study the josephson effect in two 1d nanowires located at @ xmath0 with support of @ xmath1 - n superconducting devices and separated by a hall semiconductor with the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soi ) of the @ xmath2 and the effect ( @ xmath3 , @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 along the @ xmath6 axis ) . .a diagram of the new method is shown in ref . [ josephson ] . the main results of our work are as follows . first , we propose a new method for calculating the andreev bound states present in these junctions . such a method is a modification of the method of " . to cope with external magnetic fields and spin - spin coupling . " , using this method , we present analytic expressions for the properties of the andreev bound states in three different ways and demonstrate their dependence in the josephson current . for example , we demonstrate that in the presence of the magnetic field the energy difference between these bound states decreases with the rashba soi , by up to only one . in the presence of rashba soi , they demonstrate the behavior with orientational change of @ xmath15 . second , we provide analytic expressions for the local josephson current pointing out their dependence on both @ xmath5 and @ xmath3 and the soi field " . fourth , we demonstrate the existence of an anti - josephson state in these junctions in the presence of external magnetic fields and provide analytic expressions for their dependence on @ xmath2 , @ xmath7 and @ xmath3 . ", we study the ac josephson effect in the presence of the soi ( for @ xmath8 ) and strong electromagnetic field and find that the sum of the two shapiro effects in such a system can be equal to for @ xmath2 . we propose experiments which will reproduce our experimental results . the details of the publication of the experiment is as follows . in sec . [ sec2 ] , we study the structure and give the expressions of hamiltonian as follows . the interaction energy of these systems is discussed in sec . [ sec3 ] , where the explicit expressions for the josephson interaction energy are given . this is followed by the calculation of the ac josephson effect in sec . [ sec4 ] . the ac josephson effect in these systems and the effect of the shapiro effect on soi , is discussed in sec . , we publish in sec . the details of our experiment are given in the following . we consider a junction of two 1d nanowires with an ac @ xmath1 - for ##leigh effect in the presence of rashba spin - spin interaction and strong electromagnetic field . the phase diagram of such a junction is given in sec . [ josephson ] where the two supercondu##ctors are not shown for clarity . - the action of and magnetic field @ xmath16 and @ xmath5 . - ( and due to spin - orbit coupling ) . the corresponding p - type superconductors which exhibit coupling between the wires are not shown for clarity . , [ = 245 ] in what follows we see the system is generated by the two @ xmath1 - type superconductors which respond to the electric fields @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 between the two wires . the hamiltonian for such a system is @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 represents hamiltonian of the nanowire in the absence of effective magnetic fields and @ xmath21 represents rashba soi . the second state is generated by @ xmath22 \ sigma _ x + h \ sigma _ y + h \ { [ \ sigma _ x \ sin \ phi _ 1 + \ sigma _ y \ sin \ phi _ 2 ] \ theta ( - x ) + [ \ sigma _ x \ sin \ phi _ 1 + \ sigma _ y \ sin \ phi _ 1 ] \ theta ( x ) \ } \ ( ) \ }_ { \ theta ' } ( x ) \ nonumber \ \ & & + ( \ delta _ 1 \ theta ( - x ) + \ delta _ 2 \ theta ( x ) ) \ psi _ { \ uparrow } ^ { \ theta } ( x ) \ psi _ { \ downarrow } ^ { \ theta } ( x ) + { \ rm i . e . } \ theta \ } , \ { { x - x } \ { { x } \ ] ] where @ xmath23 is the electron kinetic energy , calculated from the magnetic surface @ xmath24 , @ xmath25 is the electron spin operator , @ xmath3 and @ xmath5 are the external magnetic fields in @ xmath26 plane and in the @ xmath6 plane respectively , @ xmath27 is the electron spin operator , and @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 are differential and fourier operators operating in free space . note that the magnetic surface @ xmath5 has an interface @ xmath30 with spin which can be adjusted accordingly . in what follows , we have @ xmath5 on the right side of the figureto be aligned with the wire ( @ xmath31 ) , in the opposite direction it is chosen to make an interface @ xmath30 with wire ( @ xmath32 ) . in e . ( [ h - o ] ) , the electric field @ xmath18 in the center of the diagram is chosen to make a phase barrier @ xmath33 corresponding to its opposite directions : @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 . the phase barrier @ xmath36 represents the interaction energy between two superconductors located at @ xmath37 . the hamiltonian of rashba soi can be written as @ xmath38 \ to _ { \ { ' } ( h ) , \ _ { rashba - o } \ to { ' } \ ] ] where @ xmath2 represents the symmetry of rashba soi which is chosen to be the same for all wires . in what case , we shall solve for the two subgap andreev bound states with @ xmath39 for the josephson junction of the nanowires described by e . ( [ aligned ] ) . in this case , we shall find solutions for the andreev bound states for wires described by e. ( [ h ] ) . to do this , it is necessary to solve the two vector field equations given by @ xmath40 . the first index of the density operator ( which we shall write here as @ xmath41 ) labels the right - ( @ xmath42 ) and the left - ( @ xmath43 ) , respectively . the second @ xmath44 labels the right ( @ xmath45 ) or left ( @ xmath46 ) superconductor . in terms of the density operator given by q . ( [ op1 ] ) , the hamiltonian ( q . ( [ h ] ) ) can be written as @ xmath47 using the density operators @ xmath48 - h - and @ xmath49 in black - white space . from q . ( [ h ] ) and ( [ h - 1 ] ) , we get @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 . from q . ( [ h2 ] ) , the energy levels of the electrons are given by the positive and negative energy levels corresponding to @ xmath52 , where @ xmath53 is thekinetic energy . note that the hamiltonians @ xmath54 obey the spin - spin relation @ xcite in the absence of the kinetic energy , so that spin is invariant under the interaction @ xmath55 . the existence of the magnet - josephson effect in a topological state is known to be a consequence of this interaction @ xcite . we shall assume that for the state we consider , the magnet - josephson effect takes place only in the absence of the net net kinetic energy contribution of the spin . the energy levels of n - electrons in a topological superconductor in the presence of soi and other magnetic fields and the conditions for these physical processes are in ref [ appa ] . note that in our model , the interactions are independent from the kinetic energy ; therefore the condition for existence of a topological superconducting phase with an @ xmath56 - wave function is @ xmath57 , @ xcite . however , the existence of such a topological phase with an @ xmath58 , @ xmath3 and the spin implies that only the kinetic energy of a single spin state counts as the kinetic energy . in what case we shalldepending on the transition , where the energies of the transition states are at the critical level and the transition is an s - state . the bogolyubov - de gennes ( bdg ) conditions for the superconductors in the right - and left sides of the diagram are expressed in @ xmath59 where @ xmath60 is the bdg wave function . for the system described by the s - state @ xmath61 , they give the diffusion conditions @ xmath62 where @ xmath63 and the diffusion conditions @ xmath64 are expressed in @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 . for calculating the values of the andreev bound states for our system , we must note that analysis of the energy spectrum of the first superconductor ( see , ex . ( [ eo ] ) ) shows that the rashba soi measures the energy spectrum of states along the z axis corresponding to the critical points in @ xmath67 ( see , ex . ( [ e100 ] ) and ( [ k100 ] ) ) . the information to the andreev bound states comes from measurements of these four .. the external magnetic field separates spin - up and spin - down states ( say , cf . ( [ e011 ] ) and ( [ k011 ] ) ) , and the components of the resulting wavefunction are symmetric around one angular momentum due to the presence of such a barrier . however , the presence of a barrier between the two superconductors leads to separation of the right and left moving components . thus , the bdg wavefunction @ xmath60 can be written as a simple combination of the right and left moving components with four angular momentum and with two spin components . since we look for bound quantum states , the exact solution of e . ( [ sch ] ) with ( [ h2 ] ) can be written as @ xmath68 % \ end { displaymath } \ end { spin } \ end { spin } \ ] ] where @ xmath69 is the density matrix of the bound state , and @ xmath70 for @ xmath71 . therefore , we shall extend the solution to @ xmath72 , @ xmath73 , and @ xmath##74 , @ xmath75 for example . transforming the integral equation ( [ ab ] ) into the wave equation ( [ bc ] ) one gets the following wave equation for @ xmath76 , @ xmath77 , @ xmath78 , and @ xmath79 with @ xmath80 which can be expressed in terms of matrices @ xmath81 as @ xmath82 and a column vector @ xmath83 as @ xmath84 . the details of this method are described below in section [ appa2 ] . the properties of the andreev spin ##or can also be obtained from @ xmath85 . we see that since the matrix of @ xmath86 is both the limit of soi and the limit ; in this case , either @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 or both @ xmath78 and @ xmath79 exist . the sum of the columns of the @ xmath81 matrix , based on @ xmath89 are equal to the two column vectors of @ xmath90 , and the matrix @ xmath82 .= @ xmath91 and @ xmath92 . _ andreev bound states : @ xmath93 : _ in this example , the andreev bound states are calculated as @ xmath94 , and for electron and hole pairs with opposite spins @ xcite . the expression is ( [ wave ] ) for the wave function ( [ wave ] ) , which in the case of the soi defined by it gives the following equations for the terms @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 ; these equations are bdg : for an n - type superconductor with spin - 2 eigenfunctions @ xmath97 and @ xmath98 , where the overline of the term ( e . g . , @ xmath99 ) indicates the opposite direction of spin . one of the terms corresponding to an electron - hole pair with opposite spins . the one corresponding to the term ( written as @ xmath100 is the [ appa2 ] ) . the sum of the terms @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 is used to calculate @ xmath101 where @ xmath102 \ .[ \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { + , \ uparrow , + } } { \ eta _ { + , \ downarrow , - } } - \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { - , \ uparrow , + } } { \ eta _ { - , \ downarrow , - } } \ right ] - \ \ \ nonumber ( 1 - 1 ) \ left [ \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { + , \ uparrow , - } } { \ eta _ { + , \ downarrow , + } } - \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { - , \ uparrow , + } } { \ eta _ { - , \ downarrow , - } } \ right ] \ left [ \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { - , \ uparrow , - } } { \ eta _ { - , \ downarrow , + } } - \ frac { \ eta ^ { \ ast } _ { + , \ uparrow , + } } { \ eta _ { + , \ downar##row , - } } \ } ] . \ label { energy0 } \ label { spin } \ ] ] setting this condition to zero one finds the condition to determine the energy of @ xcite . note that the first two conditions give the same result with the same states , up to @ xmath103 . it is easy to see that the condition to determine the andreev spin - state in this case , where @ xmath82 has no @ xmath94 states , is obtained by setting @ xmath104 to zero . in order to obtain the exact expression for the wave functions @ xmath97 and @ xmath98 we use . . ( [ sch ] ) for ratios @ xmath58 , @ xmath3 and @ xmath2 , @ xmath105 . . ( [ sch1 ] ) . . ( [ sch4 ] ) allows one to find all the ratios @ xmath106 , @ xmath107 , and @ xmath108 , @ xmath109 . finally , we find that since the ratio @ xmath110 is a -and for @ xmath111 . we shall return to this section below . first , we know from . . ( [ sch1 ] ) . . ( [ sch4 ] ) that the solutions of these equations for @ xmath30 and @ xmath33 are quite different . writing the transfer function of @ xmath112 in the general form one finds @ xmath113 the two ratios that appear on the flip - side of . . [ dagup - up ] . . [ spin - down ] can be expressed as follows . the ratio @ xmath106 corresponds to the amplitude of the andreev reflection channel which allows reflection of an electron - like state to a hole - like state with opposite spin on a p - type interface . in contrast , the ratio @ xmath114 which is valid only in the presence of soi and / or magnetic fields , the amplitude of andreev reflection channel where the electron - like spin state on the interface is reflected to a hole - like spin state with the opposite spin state . finally , the ratio @ xmath115 represents the internal reflection channel of an p -for states on the boundary without formation of a spin pair in the superconducting region of the system . since these terms span the domain of @ xmath116 , these equation represent andreev and quantum mechanical ratios for electron - like and hole - like states in the same ( @ xmath117 ) and opposite ( @ xmath118 ) boundary regions . we note that the values of wavefunctions in fig . ( [ dagup - up ] ) depend on either @ xmath30 and @ xmath33 whereas those in fig . ( [ dagup - up ] ) and ( [ up - down ] ) depend on either @ xmath33 or @ xmath30 . this means that the ratios ( [ dagup - up ] ) and ( [ dagup - down ] ) are responsible for the dependence of the energy on the change of field of @ xmath33 , whereas the ratios ( [ dagup - down ] ) and ( [ up - down ] ) are responsible for the dependence on the electric field change of @ xmath30 . the ratios @ xmath119 and @ xmath##120 is derived from q . ( [ sch1 ] ) - ( [ sch4 ] ) - @ xmath121 where the second ( negative ) term @ xmath122 ( @ xmath123 ) reduces to : @ xmath124 ( @ xmath125 ) . from q . ( [ wave - up - down ] ) , one gets , after a few minutes of work , the expressions for @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 for : @ xmath5 , @ xmath3 and @ xmath2 . @ xmath128 ^ 2 \ nonumber \ \ & & - 4d | \ delta | ^ 2 ( e ^ 2 + \ alpha ^ 2 k ^ 2 ) ^ 2 \ alpha ^ 2 \ frac { \ varphi } { \ } \ { \ } ( | \ delta | ^ 2 ( e ^ 2 + \ alpha ^ 2 k ^ 2 ) ^ 2 ) ^ { - 1 } , \ { { wave - up - down } \ nonumber \ \ \ { { \ } \ ] ] - @ xmath129 the solution to the # ##ing equation is :from values of @ xmath130 , and from the others , . by setting @ xmath131 ( q . ( [ f - up - down ] ) ) to , and using the expressions ( [ e000 ] ) and ( [ k000 ] ) for the energy and momentum in this case , one gets the expression for the bound state energy , starting with kwon _ et ##h _ . , @ xcite , @ xmath132 . our expression is the above above expression in the form in this respect . in the absence of the magnetic field the contribution to the bound state energy to soi comes from the _ _ _ andreev reflection of electron - like and hole - like states with different spin . these can be expressed as @ xmath133 where @ xmath134 can be expressed as q . [ f - up - down ] and [ energy0 ] . in general , the corresponding spin reflection in the absence of the magnetic field to an electron - like state with a different spin , than andreev reflection to a hole - like bound state with the same spin . the contribution to the bound state is from thisexample : @ xmath135 where @ xmath136 is determined by @ xmath137 we see that @ xmath138 ( or @ xmath139 ) in fig . ( [ feqss ] ) is obtained from fig . ( [ energy0 ] ) by replacing the term @ xmath140 and @ xmath141 by @ xmath142 . the result for @ xmath114 can be obtained from fig . ( [ sch1 ] ) - ( [ sch4 ] ) @ xmath143 where the higher ( higher ) ratios correspond to @ xmath144 . these results can be combined to give @ xmath145 and @ xmath146 also , the solution to the transfer function from the equation given by ( [ pull - back ] ) can be obtained as @ xmath147 where @ xmath148 the solution , similar to the one described above for @ xmath149 \ to [ \ frac { \ eta _ { + , \ uparrow , - } } { \ eta _ { + , \ downarrow , - } } - \ fra##c { \ eta _ { - , \ uparrow , - } } { \ eta _ { - , \ downarrow , - } } \ right ] \ nonumber \ \ & & - ( c - 1 ) \ left [ \ frac { \ eta _ { + , \ uparrow , + } } { \ eta _ { + , \ downarrow , + } } - \ frac { \ eta _ { - , \ uparrow , - } } { \ eta _ { - , \ downarrow , - } } \ right ] \ left [ \ frac { \ eta _ { - , \ uparrow , + } } { \ eta _ { - , \ downarrow , + } } - \ frac { \ eta _ { + , \ uparrow , - } } { \ eta _ { + , \ downarrow , - } } \ right ] \ nonumber \ \ & = & \ frac { - d ^ 2 } { d ^ 2 _ - ( - ) } \ left [ \ alpha ^ 2 e ^ 2 - > ( e ^ 2 + \ alpha ^ 2 e ^ 2 ) \ alpha ^ 2 \ frac { \ alpha }{ 1 } \ } ] . \ label { fmag2 } \ label { 1 } \ ] ] the expression for @ xmath150 follows from @ xmath151 by replacing @ xmath152 with ( [ fmag2 ] ) . then setting to zero the sum of the contributions ( [ ksy ] ) , ( [ cont1 ] ) , ( [ cont2 ] ) , and ( [ cont3 ] ) yields the andreev bound states , in the presence of soi and magnetic fields . in what follows , we shall consider a special case where a simple mathematical expression for these bound states can be found . _ _ of rashba soi _ : in this case , @ xmath153 and @ xmath154 , the two contributions , which depend on the magnetic field respectively , yield the sum ( [ cont2 ] ) with ( [ energym ] ) for @ xmath155 and @ xmath156 . although the contribution from ( [ cont1 ] ) does depend on the magnetic field , it does not depend on the field of @ xmath30 . a few lines of reasoning then lead to the expression for the contribution of theandreev bound states , obtained by setting the values of ( [ ksy ] ) , ( [ cont1 ] ) and ( [ cont2 ] ) to zero , use ( [ e011 ] ) and ( [ k011 ] ) for the poles , and , with this result , replace by @ xmath157 \ { \ } = [ , \ dot { e - mag - add } \ label { \ } \ ] ] where the second and third contributions come from ( [ cont2 ] ) and ( [ cont1 ] ) corresponding to the bound states ( [ dagup - up ] ) and ( [ dagup - down ] ) . if we use the fourth contribution , which can be done for @ xmath158 , etc . ( [ e - mag - add ] ) , can be done @ xmath159 we find that etc . ( [ mag - add ] ) corresponds to the two properties of the andreev bound states . first , @ xmath160 improves with increasing the magnetic field . second , the kwon et al . result @ xcite is obtained from @ xmath161 . ( [ e - mag] ) can be calculated as . we replace the term in the brackets by a zero - one factor ( [ e0 ] ) , which replaces @ xmath162 with @ xmath163 , where @ xmath164 the second term in the solution of fig . ( [ x - maga ] ) depends on the same term as @ xmath165 for @ xmath166 . we note also that @ xmath167 agrees exactly with the superconducting potential of @ xmath33 and the magnetic moment @ xmath30 of @ xmath5 with the moment @ xmath10 as shown in fig .
