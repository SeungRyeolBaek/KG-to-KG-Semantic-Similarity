recent infrared observations of main sequence stars have detected two planets that have resolutions of 10 , @ xmath6 / @ xmath7 , with the orbital period , @ xmath8 , still unknown ( miller et al . 1999 , marcy & miller 1998 , miller et al . 1997 , miller et al . 1997 ) . these ` ` hot ' ' planets have nearly circular and eccentric orbits , consistent with variations in dissipative circumstellar disks , caused by gravitational forces ( y . lin et al . 1995 , artymowicz 1997 , levison et al . 1998 ) . the semimajor axis are all greater than 0 . 5 au , with some orbiting less than 0 . 3 au . this ` ` mixing up ' ' of planets with their host stars appears to be a natural phenomenon , although explained by the halo structure that allows detection of such planets . planets orbiting between 0 . 5 and 0 . 3 au would be easily detected with our average angular resolution of 10 , but none have been detected . this number of planets suggests scenarios in which the instability of a large protoplanetary disk pulls stars and planets apart ( lin et al . 1995 , lin et al. 1998 ) . the study of the mass of substellar objects has some exceptions . our survey of 107 gk stars found 5 that have @ xmath9 = 10 80 m @ xmath6 @ xmath10 ( marcy & butler 1998 ) . however , ` ` brown dwarf ' ' companions occur with a mass greater than @ xmath111 % , every 1 year . similarly , johnson et al . ( 1997 , 1999 ) surveyed @ xmath11500 gk stars , and found at least 10 companions at 10 80 m @ xmath6 . ( hipparcos data has shown that all other known brown dwarfs from that survey are type ii ##v stars . ) in addition , at least 10 % of gk stars have companions with masses from 0 . 5 5 m @ xmath6 . for example , in our 1998 survey of 107 main sequence stars at lick observatory , we found 10 companions that have @ xmath12 = 0 . 5 5 m @ xmath6 @ xmath10 ( marcy and butler 1998 , this year ) . however , due to this highly unusual extra period of observation , there is no brown dwarf ` ` b ' ' at 10 - 80 m @ x##math6 , located 1 au . the studies mentioned above have focused on m and k dwarf main sequence stars with masses between 0 . 5 and 1 . 5 l @ xmath5 . the question arises of the presence of planets in the m dwarf which constitute 10 % of the mass of the system . here we see the discovery of the first known known companion to an m dwarf , gliese 876 , located 2 . 5 au from the star . gliese 876 ( = hd 113020 ) has a ##v of 0 . 05 , a spectral type of m4v and a distance from hipparcos of 0 . 213 ( perryman et al . 1997 ) . combining this data and the distance measurements of delfosse et al . ( 1998 ) gives @ xmath13 = 0 . 01 , which gives a value of , @ xmath14 = 0 . 0124 and @ xmath5 . the mass of the planet gliese 876 can be calculated from its r - value , magnitude ( r = 0 . 04 ) and radius , together with an inverse mass ratio of ( smith & smith 1993 ) . this gives @ xmath15= 0 . 02 @ xmath3 and . 03 ##0 @ xmath5 . gliese 876 is chromospherically hot ( delfosse et al . 1998 ) , which suggests that it is hotter than @ xmath111 gyr . however , space travel is unknown which suggests that its age is less than 1 gyr . its metalicity is not known yet , but a recent analysis of the data indicates that it is metal poor by a factor of 10 relative to the sun ( valenti , 1998 ) . phase shifts for gliese 876 have been measured at the lick and keck observatory , using the schmidt and the echelle methods , respectively ( vogt 1987 , vogt et al . the first measurements were made in 1994 . 1 ( at lick ) and in 1997 . 1 ( at keck ) , and both data sets correspond to the infrared . the length of wavelengths and the sensitivity of the measured light were determined for each 1 and for each subsequent set of data , with the spectral lines based on the infrared spectrum ( miller et al . 1996 ) . figures 1 and 2 show some of the radial velocity variations in theperiod of 10 , consistent with the independent keplerian fits . the measurements from lick all have mean values of 2 and those from keck have 2 ##s @ xmath10s @ xmath16 . poisson values of the data are the mean values for this very small ( d = 0 . 5 ) object . the values at these points are the differences in the amplitude of the measurements ( @ xmath17 ) from the original 2 ##d measurements into which the data were collected . the measurements of gliese 876 in haute provence by delfosse et al . ( brown et al . 1999 ) also have an amplitude and phase in common with those reported here , thus requiring an error correction . it remains to be seen if their corresponding values agree with those reported here . the lick and keck data sets have independent and identical velocity zero - points . the velocity zero point has been determined by comparing the two data sets and adjusting the velocity values until the keplerian fit ( figure 1 ) has a value in the @ xmath18 range . therefore , the lick and keck data are assumed to have the same zero - point . the keplerian fits are derived from the dataand keck data sets , and the light curve and orbital parameters are shown in figures 1 and 2 . the combined orbital parameters are shown in the [ figure ] , based on the orbital fit to the raw data set . the parameters are the same for the two different orbit solutions . the two models differ in their predictions . the minimum orbital fit is @ xmath19 = 0 . 5 @ xmath3 0 . 01 au , and the maximum is @ xmath2 = 0 . 27 @ xmath3 0 . 03 . the maximum fit has a minimum orbital semi - major axis of 0 . 27 @ xmath3 0 . 01 au , and a minimum mass of @ xmath9 = 0 . 5 @ xmath3 0 . 03 m @ xmath6 . this variation @ xmath9is due to the low mass of the host star ( 0 . 5 @ xmath30 . 03 kg @ xmath5 ) which explains much of the variation in the minimum mass . the occasional occurrence of an irregular radial velocity component is evident from the raw data and from the data in figures 1 and 2 . the orbit is also not stable . there is no variation in the orbital##s , possibly indicating the presence of some other object with a mass greater than the solar radius and a period of 10 days or less in the gliese 876 spectrum . the lick and keck data can be combined to give a better fit , as shown in figure 2 . this shows that the two stars have a similar orbital period in addition to the final value of 220 . we note that the spectra from lick fall off the keplerian limit at 2 @ xmath20 , and we note that the high value of @ xmath1130 in those spectra may be partly due to the high signal to noise ratio of those spectra . the apparent velocity variation of 220 for gliese 876 suggests planetary motion is the primary cause of the velocity variation . rotation of a nearby planet can , in fact , cause artifical velocity variations . however for gliese 876 , the mean rotational period is less than 1 day @ xmath10s @ xmath16 , and the spectrum is only equal to 2 @ xmath110 . 02 . ( marcy and weiss 1992 , weiss 1996 , delfosse et al . ) , they do not change the apparent magnitude by more than @ xmath11##0 . 02 @ xmath21 2000 = 0 . we have not looked for any planets , and the orbital data indicates that such planets are not present here . however , the f and g values for the 2 . 3 m @ xmath5 companion would have length scales of days and years , respectively , given the ~ 90 % orbital variation . the companion to gliese 876 , with @ xmath9 = 2 . 3 @ xmath30 . 5 and @ xmath6 , has a minimum mass of 2 to 3 m @ xmath6 , with similar orbital stability . for an estimated companion mass of 2 . 3 m @ xmath6 , the astrometric semimajor axis would be 2 . 3 au . hipparcos data shows strong support for a hypothetical @ xmath20 upper limit of 4 m ( perryman et al . 2004 , the upper limit to the companion ) is 4 m @ xmath6 . at 1 . 1 au , this is the second nearest extrasolar planet . the semimajor axis is an average of 0 . 045 au , with a minimum separation of 0 . 062 au .it is considered a good candidate for astronomical imaging with both adaptive optics and with interferometry ( i . e . , keck , lbt , sim , vlti ) . astrometric imaging is highly difficult due to : 1 . the close proximity to the star , 2 . the high mass of the star , 3 . the low mass of the star , 4 . the long orbital period which allows many planets to be discovered in a lifetime . gliese 876 is currently the only m dwarf with a known planetary orbit . we have observed all the m dwarfs from our observatory during the last 10 years ( with a count of 10 ) , which suggests that the probability of planetary terrestrial orbits within 1 au of m dwarfs could be a few thousand , based on this latest observation . the number and quality of keck observations makes them not readily available ( @ xmath111 * ) to provide support on the existence of planets orbiting m dwarfs . the low orbital semi - major axis of @ xmath4 = 0 . 25 , and the radius of @ xmath2 = 0 . 25 present some potential problems for the stability of the planetary orbits . there is also little support for a large planetary system and a large protoplanetary .a distance of 0 . 2 au to transfer 10 earth ##s of mass to the host star ( a . lissauer 1995 ) . another possibility is that the planets approach 2 au from the star and then migrate inward . these changes would be caused by interactions between the planet and the star in the protoplanetary disk , bringing the planet closer ( butler et al . 1995 , butler _ et al . _ 1998 ) . however , it is not known what would cause the planet around gliese 876 to halt its migration beyond 0 . 2 au . neither the interaction with the star nor a magnetospherically large planet at the outer edge would extend to 0 . 2 au , and therefore they would not cause the migration . a similar , as yet - unknown , problem is known for the planets around alpha cancri and @ xmath22 cor bor ( butler et al . 1997 , butler et al . 1997 ) . the nearly circular orbits for both @ xmath22 cor bor ( @ xmath2 = 0 . 16 @ xmath3 ##30 . 06 ) and for this planet around gliese 876 ( @ xmath2 = 0 . 16 @ xmath30 . 03 ) suggest thatlarge orbital periods are common for stars and planets orbiting between 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 au from their star . a general mechanism must be found which often produces small planets , in contrast to the inexplicably large orbits of the largest planets in our solar system . infrared spectroscopy reveals a companion to gliese 876 from 1 au away ( smith & smith 1990 ) , and the absence of significant variations in the spectrum rules out planetary companions beyond 1 au . therefore , the formation of the planetary companion to gliese 876 could not have been caused by a stellar wind . however , this , if any , did not cause rotation in the inner disk of gliese 876 . @ xmath22 cor bor . another possible explanation is that tidal forces of planetary companions ( of similar mass and radius ) can influence the orbital parameters ( rasio and lee 1996 , weidenschilling and marzari 1997 , wang and wang 1996 ) . tidal changes and planetary migration among planets in the disk can lead to large orbital periods and massive planets ( levison et al . 1998 ) . long period planets in the protoplanetary disk can contribute to the ##ity , the galactic2 . the planets that lose their momentum also suffer from instability , due to # ##ities along a number of semimajor axes . however , the latter scenario , if true , does not explain the relative abundance of planets from 0 . 2 to 0 . 2 au , and it remains to be seen if planets are found further out . the ideal temperature for a thermal equilibrium in the atmosphere of the stars of gliese 876 is estimated to be - 70 c , very low for planets of this form ( saumon 1998 ) . it would be higher in lower regions of the star . the planets found out to 0 . 2 au would have equilibrium temperatures of - 70 c . it would be interesting to see if planets could exist in close orbits beyond 0 . 2 au , or in proper orbital resonance with the two planets mentioned earlier . we thank kevin apps for publication of hipparcos data . we thank jean delfosse , michel martin , and didier queloz for publishing their results for gliese 876 . we thank y . wang , y . wang , and s . basri for their information . we acknowedge ##d the funding of nagw -
