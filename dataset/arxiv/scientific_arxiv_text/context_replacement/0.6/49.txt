the spectrum of ex lup was discovered by john e . janssen in 1944 while preparing spectra plates at the lick observatory ( mclaughlin 1946 ) . herbig ( 1950 ) also pointed out the similarity of ex lupi a - lines and t tauri lines with the spectral lines of h , caii , feii , and hei . in one of the spectra plates prepared in 1949 / 1950 the h and caii lines both show an unusual t cygni hue . herbig ( 1977a ) gave the spectral type of m0 : being in the 5850 - 6700 range . ultraviolet and visible light - studies over a number of years revealed the extreme annual variability of the star ( mclaughlin 1946 , bateson et al . variations of up to 50 % can occur , but the spectrum usually shows very small amounts of variability . the most extreme variations last about one year . the average annual time period of variations is of the order of one year . + up to now there are only a few other stars known with # # ##s ( herbig 1989 ) . this small group of irregular variable t tauri stars have been called exors or the ex - fuors . these names refer to an analogy to the star of fu orionis2 ( fuors ) . fuors are a type of very low mass stars with much stronger winds lasting for years . in exors , during an outburst fuor characteristics change from t tauri characteristics to that of the older t / m stars with emission line emission ( herbig 1977b ) . fuors have high mass loss rates ( @ xmath0 , hartmann 1991 ) and strong winds ( e . g . calvet et al . 1993 ) and they may be the type that produces herbig - haro winds ( reipurth 1989 ) . + exors are poorly known , but are of great interest because they may represent an intermediate level of activity between fully active t tauri eruptions and full active fu orionis eruptions . in order to shed some light on this phenomenon , we have observed + exors spectroscopically and visually during 1993 and 1994 . the star of lup had been at a low level of activity during the 1980 ##s . in the late 1990 , this was reversed and the star became brighter ( hughes et al . 1993 , hughes et al . ) astronomy ( variable star catalogue of the royal astronomical society of new zealand , 1994 ) shows a significant activity in february / march 1994 . )( 1994 ) report on follow - up observations and high resolution optical observations of the same star . + in this paper we report details of our optical observations of the lup b , eso , la silla . we report on data collected during the outburst in june 1994 and on some additional observations carried out in july 1994 when the star had no pre - outburst radio frequency emission . a brief summary of our observations will appear in a subsequent paper . differential ccd measurement has been carried out with the 1 . 9m - german and the 1 . 54m - dutch instruments . this data is accurately calculated with respect to both sources ' brightness and distance measurements . these measurements have been made with the apphot ##ometer of iraf . the values ( for @ xmath1 ) of the distance measurements are @ xmath2b = 0 . 005 , @ xmath2v = 0 . 004 , @ xmath2r = 0 . 004 whereas the apparent magnitude of itself is close to + 0 . 01 for all other sources . + the rotational lightcurves of u , v , and w are shown in fig . 1 . the period observed between february 22 and march 27 ( herbig, priv . the variability rate of the outburst can be described as an exponential process with small variations only . variability of more than 0 . 1mag is possible on timescales of more than one day ( e . g . march 1 . 5 , see also march 1994 ) . figure 1 shows the brightness variation of ex - 1 during the outburst . the star also appears brighter when observed . for this we have obtained the data corresponding to the magnitude ##s from the outburst . the maximum magnitude was measured @ xmath2v = 2 . 0mag and @ xmath2b = 2 . 6mag . further observations in the same wavelength region were carried out during the first few days of july 1994 on the eso - 1 . 5 ##m telescope using the boller & chivens method at 1 . 5 ##m . after the failure of the lup we obtained pre - outburst spectra in the same wavelength region at resolutions of 1 . 5 and 2 on the 1 . 5m - ntt with emmi in august 1994 . these spectra have been compared with the ctioslit ##hs of iraf . comparison of spectrophotometric nights and their light curves allow for better spectral resolution . +in fig . 3 we see two eruptions of ex lup : one close to the activity , and the other at peak activity about half a century after the eruption . characteristics of the emission components of cai , caii , feii , hei , and heii are shown . under the assumption that the emitted light can be divided into an individual t tauri star system , a debris disk , and other emission components , we can examine the stellar emission components and their characteristics . a simple way to determine the source of emission is to derive the spectrum by comparison with those of stars of the same spectral type and age , but without a spectral type ( hartigan et al . 1989 , 1991 ) . the accuracy of the spectrum analysis increases significantly when the emission component exceeds the photospheric disk . in the case of ex lup during the eruption we originally did not want to determine the source and the corresponding stellar emission spectrum by comparison with spectral type stars , but we could determine the spectral signature produced during the eruption . + the photospheric disk components were absent during the eruption ( see diagram in fig . 3 ) but they appear during the post - eruption phase . + the main source of emission emission is the corona2 . therefore , the difference spectrum between outburst and post - outburst activity should be a good approximation of the difference emission spectrum . in fig . 4 we show the difference spectrum at high temperatures . the first shows the difference between an outburst ( july 3 ) and two post - outburst ( august 3 ) spectra , and the second shows the difference between two post - outburst ( august 3 and 16 ) spectra which show normal low - level activity . the difference emission spectrum of the normal low - level activity is larger than the normal spectrum of during outburst . the most prominent features in the spectrum of a lup are strong emission lines . the balmer lines can be found close to h15 ##0 during periods of high activity . the lengths and width of the lines are given in figure 1 . obviously the strong emission lines gain large width as the spectrum increases . but due to the rapid rise of the temperature the line lengths decrease , which is most evident in the data from wang ( 1994 ) and h @ xmath3 , h @ xmath4 , and h @ xmath5 during the outburst . also the caii lines are much larger # ##es during the outburst than the balmer lines . there is some evidence that the lengthof these do not change when the star goes into outburst ( cai , feii , srii ) . + lrrrr & & & & + & & w @ xmath6 & w @ xmath7 & w @ xmath8 & w @ xmath9 + & & & @ xmath10 & @ xmath10 + & & & & + & & & & + h11 3771 & -

burst spectra also corresponds toradial velocity of @ xmath13 km / s . photospheric variability of the young t tauri star can be observed only in the pre - outburst spectra . figure 1 shows the region around cai 4227 , which contains the main sequence emission line , in the post - outburst spectra . the latter of these two regions no longer contains the absorption lines , and the reduction of visible light by about 50 % is probably due to continuum emission rather than photospheric variability . + the photospheric features of the t tauri star are visible , even at low energies . the surrounding emission line material also participates in the absorption lines . the reconstruction of the spectrum is therefore very difficult . we obtain a rough approximation to the observed pattern of absorption lines by assuming a total continuum emission due to the photospheric variability of the surrounding gas ( with r = 0 , as with hd 202560 , spectral type m0v ) at 4200 when the magnitude of ex lup is r = 1 . 5 . the phenomenon of ex lup can be explained in terms of the mass loss , and the continuum emission in a small region close to the center of the star where the infalling gas then releases the dark matter . the total amount ofthe background and the hot region are separated in the spectrum and thus it becomes much brighter during the outburst . if the photospheric regions are completely separated ( assuming that r = 0 is constant , then the brightness during outburst would be r @ xmath1420 ) . the increased intensity of the infrared light during the outburst compared to the pre - outburst ( see fig . 2 ) suggests that the hot region becomes _ brighter _ during outburst ( with a decrease in brightness due to circumstellar expansion ) . this model also suggests a rapid expansion of the hot region in order to compensate for the dramatic increase in brightness during the outburst . + the observed gamma cygni components of the absorption lines show the infall ##ing of this model . the velocity resulting from the redward component of the absorption component of these lines is of the order of 10 km / s and is much higher than those predicted by the standard boundary layer model for t tauri stars ( lynden - smith & pringle , 1974 ) . alternatively , these high infall rates may result from magnetospherically driven thermal expansion ( camenzind 1990 , knigl 1991 , hartmann et al . high resolution observations ofrecent t tauri observations have revealed a small number of stars with the t cygni variability ( e . g . , 1977 , abbott et al . , 1994 ) . the relatively low amplitude ##s could be explained by temperature changes during the evolution of the star . the more extreme variability could be due to the changes in the temperature , resulting in the intense infall ##ibility of circumstellar material onto the sky . + _ + : _ we thank dr . herbig for leading us to the discovery of the lup in late august 1994 . _ we are grateful to the following astronomers for our offering support of their own work : j . abbott , j . j . claeskens , j . van dam , j . flynn , j . jerjen , j . manchado , j . patat , j . robichon , j . k . am & others . supported by two astronomers of the european southern observatory . it received funding from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) . resolution yo ##1 / 1 -
