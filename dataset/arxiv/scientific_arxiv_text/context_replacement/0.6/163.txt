the discovery of the high - mass ancestors of the most massive galaxies will provide astronomers with new insight into the fundamental factors that influence the evolution of galaxies in the high - mass universe . the latest generation of galaxy evolution models are now able to predict the age distribution and evolution of massive galaxies at low masses . however , this is only part of the problem , as past studies have raised many questions about how the morphology of these galaxies changes with age . in addition to the current question of how high - mass galaxies evolve in general , there is also still much debate about how these massive galaxies evolve in terms of their particular spectral types . recent studies of the early universe have revealed a bimodality in the galaxy - age distribution , with disk galaxies typically forming the central sequence and disk galaxies making up the peripheral sequence ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * baldry et al . 2004 ) ) . however , recent studies at both low ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * bamford et al . 2009 ) ) and high masses ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * van der wel et al . 2011 ) ) have shown a similarstudies of these disk - dominated systems , provide evidence that the chemical processes which drive star - formation may be different from those responsible for terrestrial planet formation . this work is particularly important in light of the more detailed study of high - mass massive galaxies ( and ( * ? ? ? * van der wel et al . ( 2011 ) ) who show that , in contrast to the general population of massive galaxies ( which are dominated by disk galaxies ) , the @ xmath6 * galaxies are not disk - dominated systems . through this study we hope to gain an overall understanding of these galaxies . the candels ( ( * ? ? ? * grogin et al . 2011 ) , ( * ? ? ? * koekemoer et al . 2011 ) ) near - infrared f160w images provide the necessary level of detail , temporal resolution , and resolution to perform the most detailed study to date of the free - space chemical properties of the ( @ xmath1 ) galaxies by @ xmath2 and the ukidss - based survey ( ( * ? ? ? * smith et al . 2007 ) ) . for this study we have developed a model based on the morphological and chemical mass distributions which arederived from the atomic population density model of ( * ? ? ? * bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ) and the chabrier constant model . ( see ( * ? ? ? * chen et al . 2012 ) for more details ) . this provides us with a large space - based sample of @ xmath7 galaxies . we have used the galfit ( ( * ? ? ? * peng et al . 2002 ) ) galaxy classification system to collect the morphological information for all the galaxies in our sample . to perform the three component analysis we need three components : an srsic component looking for @ xmath8 galaxies , an @ xmath9 debris component and a centrally located cluster component to look for the agn and other starbursts in our sample . these three components are combined to produce three different double - layer models , of varying quality , for each object in the sample . these models are highly consistent , and the @ xmath10 model can be used to generate the ` ` b ' ' model with the same set of model parameters . combined with this new morphological information for the objects of different masses we can see how the atomic population density of objects of different spectral types changes during the timeas for cosmic rays , here . in fig . 1 we do this by dividing our sample into three # ##s of which @ xmath11 , and using three alternative cuts in morphological classification as measured by @ xmath12 from our bulge - dominated data . in the left - hand panel of fig . 2 we have further divided the sample into two sections : bulge - dominated ( @ xmath13 ) and disk - dominated ( @ xmath14 ) . in the second panel we have divided the sample into two sections , with all objects for which @ xmath15 . is ` ` objects ' ' . finally , in the right - hand panel we have extended this first section to include all objects for which @ xmath16 . and using three alternative cuts in morphological classification ( both to try to give a clearer picture , and to allow comparison with other objects in the sample ) . , [ = 528 ] from these results it can be seen that @ xmath6 represents a new evolutionary stage , at which the galaxies become predominantly bulge - dominated , and below which they become predominantly dwarf bulge + disk dominated . we also note that at the evolutionary level measured in this sample ( @xmath17 ) it is clear that , while bulge - dominated galaxies are on the rise , pure - bulge galaxies ( i . e . galaxies similar to modern - day giant ellipticals ) have yet to appear in significant numbers , with @ xmath18 % of these low - mass galaxies still having a significant bulge component . this is consistent with @ xmath19 of the larger @ xmath1 galaxy group , which would be identified as pure - bulge from our sample ( @ xmath20 , similar to @ xmath21 ) from the data of ( * ? ? ? * buitrago et al . ( 2013 ) ) . furthermore , our results further extend existing models of star formation to account for the relatively rapid emergence of large bulge - forming galaxies , and the relatively slow emergence of small bulge - dominated objects . in addition to our theoretical analysis we also make use of the sed analysis techniques used in the sample , to determine the relationship between star - formation rate and morphological type . this is the star - formation rate ( @ xmath22 ) versus morphological type for the individual galaxies in our sample , where rate is indicated by the srsic ##s in the left - hand corner , and the right- to - - @ xmath23 - # ##ing . ( @ xmath12 ) in the right - hand corner . the values of @ xmath22 m were derived from the same near - infrared sed data used in the sample analysis , and included corrections for uncertainty , as seen from the three possible values of @ xmath24 plotted during the sed analysis . as a result of the apparent inability of this method to accurately identify the possible star - forming objects , we have also looked for possible @ xmath25 m candidates in the _ spitzer _ and chandra models of the uds , and have identified as candidate galaxies those galaxies which have a similar signal within the estimated range of @ xmath26arcsec . to our glance , our results suggest that the well - established bimodality of the galaxy - size distribution observed at high distances , where elliptical galaxies inhabit the red cloud , and elliptical galaxies inhabit the blue cloud is at least partially held in check by @ xmath6 . however , the distribution also likely includes star - and disk - dominated objects and , perhaps most importantly , a small number of very young disk - dominated objects . to observe andfollowing this , we have shown on the map in between the panel the region occupied by galaxies with disk - dominated disks and @ xmath27 . in the left - hand panel , disk - dominated is defined as @ xmath28 , and @ xmath29 % of the active objects lie within this region ( if we include the other @ xmath25 % region ) , and in the right - hand panel , disk - dominated is defined as @ xmath14 , in which case @ xmath30 % of the active objects lie within this region . the presence of a large number of active galaxies among the active galaxy clusters at these distances means that star - forming events can occur without a massive object having crossed over into a disk - dominated galaxy , as was previously assumed if the process that causes star formation is a significant factor . a plausible explanation for this comes from the experimental results of hydrodynamical models ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * kere et al . 2005 ) , ( * ? ? ? * dekel et al . 2009a ) ) and theoretical models ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * birnboim &dekel 2003 ) ) , which suggests a similar mechanism whereby the high temperature star - formation is accompanied by jets of hot gas . another mechanism which may account for star - forming events , whilst not necessarily consistent with the existence of debris disks , is the presence of debris disk structures ( e . g . ( * ? ? ? * dekel et al . 2009b ) ) , consistent with " explosions " ( ( * ? ? ? * martig et al . 2009 ) ) .
