matrices with random ( or pseudo - random ) entries occur naturally in many computer applications and are extensively used in mathematics and mathematical physics ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . on this page we mention a special class of such random matrices , namely , those associated with tree ( or tree - like ) structures . a common property of random matrices is that the number of non - zero entries in each row and column either remains constant or becomes much larger than the total number when the dimension increases . as such , a ( random ) graph is a graph where each pair of vertices is connected by only one path without crossing itself . vertices are identified by numbers . if a random ( or hermitian ) matrix @ xmath0 exists such that the entries @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 , are non - zero if and only if the @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 are connected by a single path , then the matrix @ xmath0 is said to be associated with the graph . an example of such a matrix is the identity matrix of the graph . in general , the entries of @ xmath0 are nonzero . let @ xmath5 be the indicator matrix for the @ xmath0, and @ xmath6 where @ xmath7 is the identity matrix . it is also known that for functions associated with a matrix there are linear relations which are the and ##s @ xmath8 of the green function with similar properties as for other matrices . perhaps the best way to prove linear relations for a matrix is to use an already proven formula ( sometimes called the schur type identity ) , which states that for the matrix @ xmath0 one has @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 is the green function given above and for the matrix @ xmath11 obtained from @ xmath0 by taking row @ xmath12 and column @ xmath12 . for any matrix , removing a node turns the whole tree into a linear combination of two trees . therefore , @ xmath11 is off - diagonal and the green function @ xmath10 has no diagonal sum over the neighbors of the given site @ xmath12 . it follows that for example fig . 2 the matrix @ xmath13 where the sum is taken over the neighbors of site @ xmath12 and we have that matrix @ xmath0 is hermitian . applying the above formula to@ xmath10 leads to a similar result for each neighbor @ xmath14 of @ xmath12 , except @ xmath15 where the sum is over all neighbors of @ xmath14 and @ xmath12 ( which have already been removed ) . in fact , @ xmath16 on the right - hand side of this diagram is the green function obtained for each site removed from @ xmath0 by removing the adjacent sites @ xmath12 and @ xmath14 . but because we are considering a graph , @ xmath16 is the result whether either @ xmath14 or all its neighbors were removed ; thus it is possible to remove only the one adjacent site . it is this property which allows to use the above relations where on both sides the values are equal . for small graphs the above relations allow to use the green function recursively , but their the most common application is to large ( or very large ) graphs where the values of @ xmath17 are assumed to be independent random variables ( or both ) . in this case , because of the linear ##ity of the b - relations , viz . for which @ xmath14 only has the @xmath18 from the k - tree to which @ xmath14 belongs . then for large uniform trees , we can see that and @ xmath19 are two random variables with the same distribution . let @ xmath20 be the coordination number of the @ xmath14 , and @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 , the random variables distributed according to that distribution . for this we assume also that the identity element of @ xmath23 is the random variable @ xmath24 , off - diagonal elements @ xmath18 are the c . i . d . elements @ xmath25 , and the coordination numbers are equal to @ xmath20 . then , . suppose that the random variable @ xmath26 has the same distribution as the @ xmath21 . this formula is the main tool for the analysis of large uniform trees . it has been introduced first by abou - chacra , thouless , and others in their study of self - organizing properties of graphs @ xcite and then it has been re - introduced by several other authors : the model @ xcite , @ xmath27 - 1 @ xcite , ricatti ##ni @ xcite , @- see for @ xcite , . , @ xcite etc . we shall return here to for the tree equation . strictly speaking , the tree equation is valid only for the directed graphs ( the regular graphs ) . in some cases it is applicable to graphs which have no tree - like properties , i . e . which can only be described by , and which have loops of constant length . a good example is that of the directed graph , where each vertex has the same number of loops , resulting in a graph with fixed coordination number , and where the boundary disorder observed in the graph is constant ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . for all tree - like problems the validity of the tree equation can be verified by @ xcite . there are two main classes of tree - like problems , corresponding to the different models of problems in the tree equation . the first corresponds to a regular tree with a fixed coordination number and with a boundary disorder ( i . g . @ xmath24 is a regular tree and @ xmath28 ) . this class has been described in the 2005 paper @ xcite and was further extended by @ xcite and @ xcite . the second class ( see e . g . @ xcite ) isto models which are also based on a random regular graph and with an off - diagonal disorder ( i . e . , @ xmath25 , i . e . d . random matrices and @ xmath29 ) . finally , the second class of model includes models without disorder and with fluctuating random numbers . some examples of these models are erds - rnyi models @ xcite and the random graphs with a random disorder @ xcite . on this page , as an example , we will restrict ourselves to random regular graphs . a simple algorithm for efficiently solving the tree equation has been developed for @ xcite and it is widely used today under the name of the propagation algorithm @ xcite . the basic steps of this algorithm are as follows . first , choose a large initial sample of a random number , , @ xmath30 , of variables @ xmath31 , @ xmath32 . second , choose , @ xmath33 , from @ xmath34 to @ xmath30 and then @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 from their probability distribution . third , choose @ xmath35 from the tree equation . fourth , choose from an integer from the initial sample and replace it .the energy @ xmath35 . repeat these steps for the approximation of the energy distribution to the energy of @ xmath35 . there are two types of solutions of . the first type corresponds to real values of the energy @ xmath36 : at each step of the calculation , the values @ xmath31 are real and upon iteration one finds the value of the energy of @ xmath35 . the second type of solution corresponds to adding a single positive real part to the energy , that is , adding @ xmath37 to . in this case , upon iteration the @ xmath31 are real , and the result of the calculation should be the sum of both the real and the imaginary parts of @ xmath35 , which is and should depend on @ xmath38 . if the energy @ xmath36 corresponds to a region of localized states , then when @ xmath39 the real part of @ xmath35 will go to zero almost immediately , and if the energy corresponds to a region of non - localized states the real part of @ xmath35 goes to a negative value . if we restrict ourselves to real values of the energy , with @ xmath40 . the result of this methodhow to perform the determination of the mean spectral density of random scale - free graphs by means of exact solutions of the tree equation . strictly speaking , the method is suitable for graphs with a large coordination number and it produces good results even for small coordination numbers . the method itself is relatively simple and has been used extensively for solving erds - rnyi problems ( see e . g . @ xcite @ xcite and others below ) . we will address some important points which are not to be discussed in the section and will discuss in detail the application of the method to other random graphs and to other kinds of models . the rest of the section includes the following . after discussing the definitions in section [ rhodee ] , section [ mean _ field ] is devoted to the general ##ization of the method . it is assumed that the commonly used mean - field solution of the tree equation corresponds to the case of the exact solution of the generalized cauchy equation whose parameters are chosen self - complementary . the numerical methods for the mean spectral density are also discussed in this section . in section [ e ] the case of random graphs with random edges is discussed . by comparing results of random graph studies with different kinds of models we measure their properties and conclude that at any order the meanresults for regular graphs with diagonal disorder are obtained from the so - called regular tree equation introduced by @ xcite . section [ mean _ field ] describes the case of regular graphs with off - diagonal disorder . for these cases the best results are obtained by using the first - best approximation given in section [ mean _ field ] . for all these cases , the second best approximation for the tree equation is , since it is obtained , with the numerical solution obtained by this method , depends on the spectral density estimate over the real numbers . the conclusion of this article ( discussed in section [ below ] ) is that the numerical solution of the tree equation is simple , efficient , and efficient method of determination of the mean spectral density for the regular graph - based cases . the mean spectral density is defined as given by @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 represents values of @ xmath0 and the calculation is based on a sampling of the matrix a . as mentioned in the section , here we will consider the values of and . . let us denote by @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 the ( joint ) probability density of @ xmath24 and @ xmath45 . the probability density of each @ xmath##46 is represented by a function @ xmath47 , and that of # @ xmath48 by a function @ xmath49 . by definition , @ xmath50 = @ xmath51 the tree equation shows that for all @ xmath52 the probability density @ xmath47 yields the equation @ xmath53 or equivalently @ xmath54 values of @ xmath0 correspond to those of @ xmath36 where @ xmath55 is smaller . assuming that @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 in can be represented by two variables , which we denote by @ xmath24 and @ xmath58 in , we find that these values result in @ xmath59 . under these conditions , the calculation yields @ xmath60 where the calculation is repeated for all @ xmath20 values of the second variable . an equivalent expression for the same probability density is obtained by putting fig . into the form @ xmath61 . the calculation of @ xmath62 in fig . yields @ xmath63 of note , the tree equation can be written in several different ways . in the followingof the spectral density can either be obtained from that of the equation @ xmath47 which is the solution of the tree equation , or from that of @ xmath49 . in the next section we give the solutions of these equations . the tree equation must have a single square root , that is , a @ xmath64 ( based on @ xmath36 ) such that @ xmath65 if such a @ xmath66 exists , the mean spectral density associated with this solution is obtained from a @ xmath67 using numerical methods , this solution can be equivalently obtained as @ xmath68 when the real part of @ xmath69 is zero . this is known as the square root estimate ( sda ) @ xcite . to further improve this , we can also show that for a @ xmath33 ( which , as we see above , are the factors which determine this type of approximation ) the sum over @ xmath20 terms in a . can be replaced by the sum over @ xmath33 terms , so that from this follows that the mean spectral density takes the form @ xmath70 this type of approximation is often used for complex random variables, where etc . , called the average value analysis ( ema ) @ xcite . however , this field is a type of simple mean field and so these results are derived by assuming that the random variable @ xmath52 defined according to @ xmath47 varies rapidly around its mean value @ xmath64 ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . such an assumption is simple , technically sound , does not require complex numerical methods , and gives , as a result , very good results . the problem is that the simple assumption that the @ xmath52 varies very rapidly around its mean value @ xmath64 can only be , in general , true for linear - time problems . however , it follows from this . that if the function @ xmath71 is constant , then @ xmath47 has to converge to @ xmath72 in general , this means that @ xmath47 belongs to the class of long - range functions , for which the mean field @ xmath73 does not exist . however , the nature of the ( simple ) mean field , and , therefore , its application to the general linear solution of the optimization problem for the @ xmath##52 is true . the inverse mean value theorem is equivalent to the fact that the distribution @ xmath47 can be replaced by the corresponding cauchy distribution @ xmath74 with @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 real numbers , @ xmath77 , and @ xmath78 . similarly , for the characteristic function @ xmath79 without points in the upper - half plane one gets the distribution @ xmath80 in other words , the cauchy distribution is different from the @ xmath81 - distribution when taken on a finite number of points . in particular , when @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 are equal and @ xmath84 , the formula yields the following : @ xmath85 the only mathematical properties of cauchy distributions that we can make use of are the functional property @ xmath86 and the spectral property @ xmath87 the characteristic function of is given by @ xmath88 let us compute the characteristic functions of @ xmath47 , @ xmath89 and properties of the special linear group @ xmath90if in the right - hand side of this equation @ xmath47 is replaced by the cauchy distribution @ xmath91 given by . . , the approximate solution of gives a first - order reduction of the characteristic function of @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 corresponding to @ xmath94 . requiring that both @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 exist such that for small argument @ xmath95 is also equivalent to requiring that @ xmath96 follows the mean field approach . these solutions can be obtained as follows . let @ xmath64 be a ( positive ) mean value of and @ xmath97 the corresponding cauchy distribution . finding an approximate solution to such that @ xmath98 for small argument @ xmath99 is obtained by replacing @ xmath92 by @ xmath100 in the left - hand side of equation . . this means that @ xmath64 is not the mean value of the random variable as in the usual mean field approach but rather the value of the cauchy distribution which describes the value of the characteristic function @ xmath101 at .@ xmath102 . ( it is important to note that for the same goe function of two variables the corresponding scale parameter also has a cauchy distribution , as e . g . @ xcite . ) the existence of @ xmath64 allows to calculate for the mean spectral density from and . . . in the case discussed in the previous section we see that it does not give good results for large values of @ xmath33 . therefore , we have to use the approximate formula obtained by substitution the cauchy distribution into and . . the calculations based on and . lead to the following approximate formula for the mean spectral density @ xmath103 this formula is not as accurate as ema but it gives better results . we refer to it as to the generalized inverse scattering approximation ( mema ) . a few examples are worth to mention . when @ xmath97 is substituted into and . one gets , after substitution of @ xmath104 , the second order approximation of @ xmath49 , and @ xmath105 the first approximation of the corresponding cauchy distribution , @ xmath106 , is then also obtained , from this or and .. , . . from fig . : if we calculate @ xmath107 , . . can be calculated @ xmath108 where . is taken from @ xmath24 and the @ xmath109 . this is essentially the inverse function of the cauchy function with parameters @ xmath110 ( from fig . ) . if one now estimates @ xmath111 the next iteration can be done in the same way . if we refer to the cauchy function @ xmath91 with parameters from fig . as the first order approximation of @ xmath47 and to the second order as the second order approximation . for second order of approximation one can estimate the total computational power by using either . . . . . . these expressions are equivalent when @ xmath47 is the same value , but for # ##ness they differ and may give different results . however , in general , one can rely on the case of when these two values are equal to each other , for a given n , neither of these expressions is exact and we shall assume that . let us now consider in particular the case of a regular graph ( which can be represented as a regular graphto satisfy these conditions ) where each node is @ xmath20 ##1 . the matrix we get is the identity matrix of the graph , to which we apply the second model given by i . i . d . random variables with e . g . the uniform distribution @ xmath112 , to this model which has been introduced by @ xcite and which has been extended in many ways ( see e . g . @ xcite and see below ) . such a model corresponds to the model given in the [ mean _ case ] with the @ xmath113 . then the random field model is @ xmath114 which means that @ xmath115 is the the uniform distribution of the distribution of @ xmath33 i . i . d . variables , corresponding to the distribution @ xmath47 . from this follows that @ xmath47 is given by the @ xmath33 - 1 value of @ xmath47 ( etc . ) . when @ xmath33 is fixed , the following central limit theorem ( see e . g . @ xcite ) can be proved . it follows that the uniformly distributed distribution of i . i . d . random variables corresponding tothe limit of all stable distributions . if the second moment is zero , the limiting distribution is the same . for long - tailed distributions , when the second moment does not exist , the limiting distribution is one of the stable distributions . the asymptotics show that @ xmath47 belongs to the group of points of the infinite cauchy group , and at large @ xmath33 the spectral density of @ xmath33 - that of @ xmath52 . the limit is equal to @ xmath116 given by the two parameters @ xmath117 and @ xmath118 , with @ xmath119 . it follows that these parameters are derived directly from the definition of the wave function of @ xmath47 at energy @ xmath102 , @ xmath120 and above . the resulting spectral density is then given by which , using the definition , yields @ xmath121 which corresponds exactly to sda . note that the function @ xmath122 takes the form of the wave function @ xcite where one takes as the wave function the energy obtained at the point with energy @ xmath123 . the simplest version of the above definition isto the limit of and , i . e . @ xmath124 . in this case . similarly , for @ xmath125 , the solution @ xmath119 with @ xmath126 . for @ xmath127 , @ xmath128 . from . . , the minimum computing power in this case is calculated at least once by @ xmath129 which agrees with kesten - mckay formula for computing random elements @ xcite . for a simple solution @ xmath43 of random elements , such as , , @ xmath76 and @ xmath75 are also calculated , from . . . since , they have a value ( as a function of @ xmath36 ) equal to . a simple way to calculate @ xmath64 is the first step of algorithm . starting from a different calculation state @ xmath130 , i . e . @ xmath131 where @ xmath132 is the solution of . . . to see that it is possible to use a completely different calculation method , @ xmath133 with the solution @ xmath134 . therefore , @ xmat##h76 and @ xmath75 are defined as functions of density , the spectral density can be calculated either from etc . or from etc . we find that etc . and similar results for and @ xmath33 . the sda is given for a solid lines of @ xmath33 and @ xmath135 in fig . [ fig _ diag _ 1 . 0 ] and [ fig _ 1 ] for the spectral density respectively . the relationship between the first two lines and the results of the partial sums of the solid lines is only good for the values of the density and for the small values of the reynolds number . they are usually observed only at the extreme points , where in some cases the diagonal ##s can also be used . and @ xmath136 ( green circles ) , @ xmath137 ( red circles ) , and @ xmath138 ( blue circles ) , come from calculations performed with @ xmath139 - line - graphs , with @ xmath140 - types of lines and etc . solid lines of all colors have higher order sda values . solid lines correspond to the last part of the equation . for @ xmath14##1 these two values are not the same and the sda formula is presented . ] but for @ xmath142 ( left panel ) and @ xmath143 ( right panel ) . solid lines of corresponding color indicate first order sda formulas . the next order calculations at the scale of the figures are hardly distinguished from the sda and are not presented . ] but for @ xmath142 ( left panel ) and @ xmath143 ( right panel ) . solid lines of corresponding color indicate first order sda formulas . the next order calculations at the scale of the figures are hardly distinguished from the sda and are not presented . ] to determine more about the results of these two calculations , we calculate for the energy @ xmath47 obtained from the wave equation using the wave equation method shown in the [ figure ] . the values for the two distributions are shown in fig . [ w _ 0 . 0 ] and [ w _ 1 ] . for energy @ xmath144 and the distribution @ xmath36 , we calculate the second order and the first order approximation to @ xmath47 . for different values of @ xmath144 ( fig .[ . _ . . . ] ) the two equations are essentially the same , for example @ xmath144 they are slightly different . in the above figure the first order approximation @ xmath106 calculated by . . is in very good numerical agreement with the numerical solution of the tree equation . the second order approximation for the total electron density can be calculated e . g . from . . which , for our example , is @ xmath145 where @ xmath106 is calculated from . calculated directly from the tree equation for two directed graphs with @ xmath146 and @ xmath141 at different vertices , from left to right @ xmath147 , @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 . green lines indicate calculation of the numerical solution of the tree equation using the loss function , taking a set of @ xmath150 boundary conditions and performing @ xmath151 calculations . the dashed lines indicate the second order ( cauchy ) approximation . the second approximation is slightly different from the previous one and is not shown in the figure . , [ = " x : " ] + , with @ .##math152 . from left to right : @ xmath147 , @ xmath153 , and @ xmath154 . red lines show results of the numerical calculation of the above formula for probability density . white solid lines show the second - order ( cauchy ) formula . black solid lines show the first order formula . , [ = " : : " ] + from right . [ = _ diag _ 1 . 0 ] it is clear that this formula agrees exactly with the numerical calculation for small @ xmath33 . for small @ xmath33 the second order and the first order formula are almost identical on the scale of the data . this difference can be seen as follows . as has been noted in the [ limit _ theorem ] , the range of the cauchy formula for the first order formula is to a certain extent , ( what follows is called the asymptotics ) . on the other hand , according to the great central limit of the @ xmath33 - small approximation , @ xmath71 , of the extreme second order , is in the range , and is very close to some of the observed data . ., and which can be expressed as @ xmath71 and @ xmath155 at very high . are more easily described by higher - order approximations than those associated directly with the boundary conditions . in this section we consider a second class of tree - based distributions , namely those associated with directed graphs with a correlation function @ xmath20 , with diagonal elements equal to , and off - diagonal element , expressed as a . i . d . random variables . the quantities @ xmath47 and @ xmath156 are described by and . and with @ xmath124 ( since diagonal elements are excluded ) and the second integral @ xmath44 which is the probability distribution of off - diagonal element . we define for @ xmath44 the probability distribution with variance @ xmath27 and the mean @ xmath157 this formula is not explicit but allows simple calculation . note that changing the variance corresponds to a change of the mean ; so for what , we use @ xmath158 . it is possible to use the function @ xmath159 which for example @ xmath33 corresponds to well - known correlation function . the examples given in the[ mean _ field ] can be obtained from this transformation . the coefficients are known and they are as follows . the mean - field integral is @ xmath160 the first iteration of the @ xmath33 - 1 integral , viz . , as @ xmath161 \ . \ ] ] the first derivatives and changes in the [ mean _ field ] for the probability distribution are now given by @ xmath162 \ label { \ _ mema } \ ] ] and @ xmath163 \ . \ label { sda } \ ] ] the first derivatives form of the integral @ xmath47 , obtained from the first derivative of the cauchy integral , is now obtained from fig . 2 @ xmath164 \ . \ label { \ _ mean _ field } \ ] ] when @ xmath165 = @ xmath166 , the only change in time comes from , where @ xmath167 , and one can write @ xmath168 and @ xmath169 the solution of is . in this case of @ xmath170 one can now see , once again , that in this case @ xmat##h171 and @ xmath172 given above and related to the kesten - mckay result for the same graph @ xmath173 where for simplicity we consider the graph @ xmath27 of off - diagonal elements . the variance @ xmath174 is the non - normal variance @ xmath175 and should come from the graph @ xcite . for small values of @ xmath33 the result is different . it is known ( see e . g . @ xcite ) that for graphs with off - diagonal elements , where the variance of small values of @ xmath45 is non - normal , the normal density of elements has a peak for small values of the graph @ xmath176 where @ xmath177 is a strictly positive constant . this result is consistent with the peak of the density of small sub - regions which are excluded from the graph due to large numbers of small off - diagonal elements . the results for different @ xmath33 and off - diagonal elements given above are shown in bold . [ see _ table ] . in the following figure mema values are shown . we see that sda expressions give similar results for different @ xmath33 .the overall accuracy of the measurements and numerics is very good . the magnitude of the error is quite apparent even for the @ xmath33 . , red squares to @ xmath178 , and blue squares to @ xmath143 . two lines of the same color represent the energy and mema approximation . the white line indicates the first order approximation for @ xmath146 . for small values of @ xmath33 the difference between the energy and the next order approximation is small and only the first order approximation is shown in the figure . ] . in the same figure we can write the as @ xmath47 or as wave ##let # . the values are given in ref . [ energy _ density ] for a few units of length . the same figure also shows the first - order ( cauchy ) approximation and the first order of is given by . in both cases however , the first order approximation is in much better agreement with the measurements . this better approximation of the first - order approximation for @ xmath47 allowed us to find the best approximation to the observed energy density . we derived it from the @ xmath179 with @ xmath106 given by . the samedensity @ xmath180 of @ xmath33 i . e . e . density @ xmath181 with , @ xmath44 , @ xmath182 one can write im @ xmath183 with @ xmath184 ( note that since @ xmath185 and im @ xmath186 one has im @ xmath187 ) . using the above formula for the cauchy group , one also has @ xmath188 for the same reason with @ xmath158 , @ xmath189 for @ xmath190 , and finally . the path # ##s is given by the [ @ xmath191p _ k ( t ) p _ k ( t _ 1 ) p _ k ( t _ 2 ) \ mathrm { d } 1 \ , \ mathrm { d } t _ 1 \ , \ mathrm { d } t _ 2 \ ] ] , with the density of @ xmath192 and @ xmath193 respectively . this reduces ( by integrating @ xmath194 ) to @ xmath195 this integral is evaluated in time . [ p _. ] for @ xmath146 . this also agrees well with the general numerical solution of the mean probability density . for large values of @ xmath33 the second and the first order formulas are equivalent to each other . this is the result given in the previous section that shows the second order formula much better than with the density @ xmath47 . in the wave equation , the difference between the two values of the probability density is significant even for the larger values of the number . for regular graphs with @ xmath146 and off -

diagonal entries . we consider here the special case of matrices of the general form @ xmath198 where @ xmath199 are i . i . d . random matrices with finite mean @ xmath43 and @ xmath200 are i . i . d . - random matrices with finite mean and finite variance @ xmath201 pastur proved by @ xcite that in the case @ xmath202 and under certain initial conditions the mean generating function @ xmath203 is the mean @ xmath204 and theproof : . this solution belongs to the regular graph with coordination number @ xmath205 . since from the limit @ xmath202 @ xmath206 it belongs to @ xmath69 ( ) . and since from the limit @ xmath207 it is easy to see that fig . 2 with the mean - density approximation , which is a solution of the tree - equation solution . we compute the mean spectral density for these regular graphs , yielding an exact real solution of the tree equation associated with these graphs . this method is simple and is valid for all real tree - equation solutions . the mean spectral density for these graphs is given by the @ xmath208 - 1 approximation of the tree equation : , where @ xmath20 is the coordination number of the graph . for example @ xmath33 the first central limit theorem states that in the limit the solution depends only on a few parameters which can be computed directly from the boundary conditions . from the solution of the tree equation it follows that the exact solution belongs to the limit of convergence of the generalized cauchy equation . thus , it is possible to find , for the first real solution of the tree .and , the cauchy distribution itself , whose components are distributed time - independently . solutions of that same cauchy distribution give first order results . when a numerical solution for tree equation solution is found , the mean spectral density can be calculated using one of the above formulas relating it to the tree equation solution ( see equation [ 2 ] ) . we used this formula for the calculation of mean spectral density for regular graphs with diagonal and off - diagonal disorder , and compared the second and first order results with those of other numerical calculations . as such , for small coordination numbers the first order approximation for the solution gives quite good results , which were quite poor results at the time @ xmath33 . for regular graphs with diagonal disorder the sda gives only slightly better results . for graphs with off - diagonal disorder the mema is closer to the numerics than the first order approximation . as for the tree equation solution itself , the second order approximation is usually much closer to the numerical solution given by the wave equation than the first order cauchy approximation . however , the large values for the mean spectral density are usually known only for small coordination numbers . the fact that the mean spectral density of regular graphs is close to the meanof this equation which , strictly speaking , is valid only for finite dimensions is actually quite simple and could be solved even in some cases without symmetry and with # ##ization . the study of this and related problems in the form of the search for it ( see e . g . @ xcite ) is of interest . s . s . mehta , _ random matrix theory _ , ( springer , new york , 1990 ) . m . akemann , m . baik , and m . di francesco , _ the oxford handbook of random matrix theory _ ( oxford university press , 2011 ) . m . abou -
