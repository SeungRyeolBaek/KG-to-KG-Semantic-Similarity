the cdf experiment has detected an excess in the energy of proton jets in association with the @ xmath1 particle in @ xcite from data collected at the tevatron with a center - of - mass energy of 1 . 5 tev and an estimated mass of 1 . 5 fb @ xmath6 . the @ xmath1 particle is interpreted as a charged particle ( proton or neutron ) with zero angular momentum . the total energy of the dijet system is estimated to be in the range of 100 - 150 gev . the @ xmath0dijet system has a large particle cross - section which is much smaller than standard model ( sm ) particles . the dijet system can be interpreted as an electric particle with energy of 100 gev which then splits into two possible states . this leads to the possibility that an already predicted sm system has been discovered . at present the excess from the theoretical predictions is estimated at 1 . 5 @ xmath7 particles . the situation needs to be further studied . on the theoretical level , our understanding of the parton effect and dark energy physics leaves room for interpretation to make sure that the excess is not the particles in the system @ xcite . further ,of the model that has received much attention . many new models like this have been proposed to explain the cdf @ xmath0dijet phenomenon , such as leptophobic @ xmath8 , @ xcite , color @ xcite , color model , spin @ xcite , high - spin higgs model @ xcite and the spin model @ xcite . common to all of these models is that the emitted particles can decay directly into particles ( dijet ) . we know that a number of particles which can decay have this property . these are those particles which are independent and correspond to particles only . in order for these particles to be considered as a physical model , they must satisfy conditions derived from the experimental data . new particles which couple to the particles have been searched for in the tevatron and the lhc . if the relationships to particles / particles are the same in the standard model , the first known diquark with a mass in the region @ xmath9 gev is known from the tevatron @ xcite , and the two others , @ xmath10 gev , @ xmath11tev and @ xmath12 tev are excluded for the lhc @ xcite whereas the lhc limit is excluded for @ xmath13 gev . the three elementary diquarks with negative charge , @ xmath14 , @ xmath15 , @ xmath16 , are excluded for their energy greater than 0 . 0 , 1 . 0 , 2 . 0 tev , in @ xcite . the color - vectors / particles which interact with particles / particles under spontaneous symmetry are excluded for @ xmath17 tev @ xcite . if their interactions to particles / particles are greater than the classical limit the restrictions are relaxed . many aspects of the physics related to the cdf @ xmath0dijet ##s have been discussed in @ xcite . in this article we carry out a new experiment to understand the properties of colored vector fields @ xmath18 . the quantum theory of the cdf produced by @ xmath19 and induced by @ xmath18 transforms into black hole theory . at the quantum level , there are many colored vector fields which also have renormalizable properties toand two ( namely a proton and an anti - proton ) . a complete list of the elementary particles which can decay to spin ##ons at the energy of @ xcite and details of the decay has been published in @ xcite . the particle number cross section and the data from @ xmath0dijets , and dependence on other parameters . these possible explanations are ruled out when comparing with the other data , such as data from charge - charge collision ( fcnc ) models . we find that without any of the above data to explain this special case all of the models , including the @ xmath5 , are in agreement with fcnc models . we , however , can find that some special cases can be made consistent with the model by changing their parameters . a possible explanation for the @ xmath0dijet ##s from cdf . some of these models may have their basis in exotic particle theory , which is outside the scope of the current understanding of physics . these exotic particles may have their signatures in the large heavy ion model ( rhic ) and the large scale cluster ( lhc ) which can be used to help explain .2 . the paper is presented as follows . in section [ sec : sum ] , we describe the color - states which can bind to two particles ( either a proton and an anti - proton ) , and describe their mutual coupling ##s assuming that the first particle with a mass of 1 gev to match the cdf @ xmath0dijet ##s is . in section [ sec : fcnc ] , we explain the results from fcnc ##s on the possible combinations . in section [ sec : rhic ] , we present the results for the rhic and the lhc . finally , we present our results in section . [ sec : sum ] . the particles which have mass and a renormalizable mutual coupling to two particles or a combination of a proton and an anti - proton can be easily determined by the bi - products of two particles @ xcite . the results appear in the paper @ xmath20 as : @ xmath21 the two bi - products , @ xmath22 and @ xmath23 . the @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 are two numbers . with these two numbers ,we can use the following colored cross - product @ xmath26 where the notation ` ` @ xmath27 ' ' denotes complex number . for those generators which can couple to right - handed generators , the contribution to @ xmath1 associated production will be small because they do not directly couple to @ xmath1 generators . to have an @ xmath1 associated production for the cdf generator , we will need the following colored product which can couple to left - handed : @ xmath28 where @ xmath29 is the color tensor , @ xmath30 is the @ xmath31 index , and @ xmath32 , and @ xmath33 ( @ xmath34 ) is the generator of the color tensor ( @ xmath35 , @ xmath36 ) . the three index fields , @ xmath37 , @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 , are given by with the color energy tensor applied to . we define the component fields of @ xmath40 as follows : @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 is the @ xmath40 index . for the @ x##math43 , the two models can be described according to their physical properties with @ xmath44 and @ xmath45 . for @ xmath19 collision and @ xmath46 interaction , the same results come from the @ xmath47 - channel and @ xmath48 - channel exchange , as shown in figure . [ feyn ] . - channel and @ xmath48 - channel produced by @ xmath49 collision . here , line and wavy line represent particle and anti - particle , @ xmath50 and @ xmath18 , respectively . [ feyn ] ] for @ xmath51 , @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 the @ xmath48 - channel exchange can occur in addition to the process of @ xmath47 - channel channel exchange . one needs to understand how the interaction systems relate to , and the @ xmath1 interaction . we consider the two interactions in the two - eigenstate model as the following , @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 . the interaction system is given by @ xmath56 , @ xmath57 and @ xmath58, where @ xmath59 is the ckm - coupling matrix , and @ xmath60 ( @ xmath618 @ xmath62 , ( 6 , 3 ) , ( 6 , 3 ) , ( 6 , 3 ) , ( 6 , 3 ) ) is the coupling matrix in phase space . @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 are symmetric , and , @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 are anti - symmetric , under the influence of color indices @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the diquark indices are @ xmath67 where @ xmath68 is @ xmath40 pair , and @ xmath69 is @ xmath40 pair . the electroweak gauge interactions are given by @ xmath70 where @ xmath71 is the second index . the electroweak gauge interactions of the metric tensor are obtained from the indices : @ xmath72 where @ xmath73 is the index of the metric tensor @ xmath74 , and @ xmath75 . when the two color indices are removed and replaced withthey are excluded . for @ xmath51 color - coded and @ xmath52 , @ xmath76 diquarks , the dominant contributions to the @ xmath19 contribution are from @ xmath18 contribution to the other component , @ xmath77 . for @ xmath78 , @ xmath53 diquarks , on the other hand , because the color coupling ##s is anti - symmetric in free space , the dominant contributions would be from @ xmath79 contribution ( which includes @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 coupling ##s produced by cabibbo coupling ) . in general , components of @ xmath18 contribution have different masses . in order to calculate the contribution to @ xmath82 contribution , we require that all the components have the same mass for each . since the and the masses of the colored components are known , the only relevant parameters , the color parameters , can be calculated without changing the colored parameters to match the cdf @ xmath0dijet ##s . we study the two types of colored components separately . for the comparison , we use madgraph / madevent @ xciteand , @ xcite for the laser - and detector - generation , and pgs for the gas - generation . these are used for the case with @ xmath83 . we use the same kinematical parameters as those given in fig . the individual particle parameters are chosen so that the dijet z - coefficients will describe all of the particle interactions . the simulation data for the production of color - x factor @ xmath51 with @ xmath84 contribution is shown in fig . 1 @ xmath49 . cross - section at the tevatron is estimated to be 1 % ( without the @ xmath85 - 1 ) . for other cases , we have similar results . dijets produced at the tevatron . cdf data obtained from fig . @ xcite is compared with our previous simulation data for the color - x - factor with @ xmath86 ( gas ) and the z - factor @ xmath87 ##2 ( gas ) . [ cdf ] ] we see the corresponding distribution of the coefficients for each . in the figure , @ xmath88 we see that the total coefficients are of order @ x##math89 for color - coupled systems , but not to @ xmath90 for diquark systems . the large color values for the diquark systems arise from the fact that the tevatron is an @ xmath91 system and the decay of diquark will build up a p - state whose wave function is zero . the color values for @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 , are important since the decay cross - section is large due to the cabibbo distribution of coupling to @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 , and the corresponding @ xmath48 and @ xmath27 - 1 parton distribution for a pair . the coupling between them is probably due to either a pair or a coupling to @ xmath40 . further studies are in progress about the different color h - fields which can cause interactions with different systems and results from the decay energies for these interactions , in experiments such as at the ua2 @ xcite . however , the decay energies of these scalars are less than 1 gev for color - coupled systems ,and a limit to 1 gev for diquark production , where the energy ##s of the internal states of the jets to them are similar to those described in the previous section . these limit values are small enough to give the size of the individual dijet ##s as the limit of the size of the total energy distribution . finally , the energies of the jets which decay to zero are determined by the two - jet - energy distribution measured in the ua2 experiment @ xcite . for @ xmath94 gev , the cross - section for the decay down to zero jets is known for @ xmath95 only . the measurements in fig . ( 7 ) give values for @ xmath96 . [ [ @ xmath97 . \ ] ] from the above , we see that the energies in fig . ( 8 ) can only be constrained by the ua2 experiment . the cross section for @ xmath78 is at the center of the boundary . we can find the @ xmath98dijet # cross - section for the tevatron . for the measurements in fig . ( [ x - 1 ] ) , the @xmath99 + @ xmath18 + cross - coupling are required to produce @ xmath100 . \ ] ] the abundance @ xmath101 is only 0 . 5 % , which is 1 % of @ xmath102 in the system , the first - generation . this abundance is similar to @ xmath103 . therefore , although there have been no further significant results on the diboson production of @ xmath104 produced in the tevatron laboratory , @ xmath105 production should be more closely studied . from the previous section we know that the strong interactions of these colored particles to the first and second generations are much stronger than that of the background higgs in order to induce the cdf @ xmath0dijets interactions . therefore we need to determine whether such a strong coupling is consistent with sm . we also have constraints from the fcnc model of colored particles which can induce a proton - proton interaction . we study each generation separately in the section . further phenomenological details of the anti - particle interactions can be found in @ xcite . here we study the constraints from the interaction of the##sons for applying this method to the next generation of models . for @ xmath51 paired with @ xmath106 and @ xmath107 , we get @ xmath108 if @ xmath109 is not diagonal , exchange of @ xmath110 will induce large fcnc interactions at tree level , such as @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 mixing , making the model unstable . but if @ xmath109 is diagonal , exchange of @ xmath113 at tree level will not induce fcnc interactions which will result in very large @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 and @ xmath116 - @ xmath117 mixing . to consider the fcnc effects , we can start with the special case where @ xmath118 ( where @ xmath119 is the correlation function ) for = ( @ xmath120 ) . - @ xmath115 is replaced by @ xmath109 mixing . this case is the non - linear ##ized case . [ fcnc ] ] is the case where the @ xmath109 coupling is broken off( @ xmath121 ) , the @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 contribution of @ xmath122 is given by @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 and @ xmath18 - @ xmath18 contribution is given in ref . [ fcnc ] . in order to define the @ xmath18 contribution , we need the following parameters : @ xmath123 where @ xmath124 , @ xmath125 ( @ xmath126 is the mass of @ xmath18 particle ) , and @ xmath127 . the mixing of @ xmath128 and @ xmath129 are given by @ xmath130 we define the @ xmath18 contribution of @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 mixing contribution of @ xmath131 where @ xmath132 is a particle mixing rate , @ xmath133 is a particle mass , and @ xmath134 is the coupling energy from the first term of the @ xmath122 contribution of @ xmath85 and @ xcite . for the @xmath135 and @ xmath136 terms are from the @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 box diagram . the @ xmath137 term is from the @ xmath18 - @ xmath18 box diagram . the total sm contribution is given by @ xmath138 . for the term @ xmath139 , using the . ( [ x - 1 ] ) ( for the second term , @ xmath140 ) , we find that the @ xmath135 term is the result , which leads to the @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 box diagram with charm and energy corrections . the long distance sm contribution has effect which mainly comes from the charm energy and energy corrections . for the @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 result , the long distance sm contribution with the second - to - last charm energy correction will be about 50 % of the final term , @ xmath141 gev @ xcite . since the long distance contribution is yet to be determined , the measured mass ratio of particles can be estimated with the result . we estimate the effect of the first term @ xmath##18 . and the short distance sm contribution , which is derived from the hadronic model , @ xmath142 . we see that the contribution from the standard model is about 1 % of the short distance sm contribution of the mixing amplitude for the system @ xmath143 obtained by the @ xmath0dijet model , and therefore , consistent with the experimental result of no energy loss . the remaining contribution of the mixing amplitude is the cp violation for @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 properly . we see that @ xmath144 is less than 1 % , and therefore , not consistent with experiment . the mixing amplitude of @ xmath145 - @ xmath146 are obtained only by mixing @ xmath147 , @ xmath132 , @ xmath133 and @ xmath134 properly , and they are known to be at the level of less than 1 % of the standard model , as well as the experimental result . when @ xmath51 adds to @ xmath148 and @ xmath107 , we get @ xmath149 in this case , to find the structure of fcnc ,one is going to expect @ xmath150 to be neutral . very similar to the above , to avoid the confusion ##ities in fcnc , we have our example , of the mixture ( @ xmath151 ) @ xmath152 with @ xmath153 . in this case , the @ xmath18 ##0 is @ xmath154 where @ xmath155 and @ xmath156 respectively are the mixing operators from the original formulation of the theory , @ xmath157 and @ xmath158 are @ xmath85 ##0 , and @ xcite . the value is zero ( @ xmath159 % of the original value ) for the amplitude for the weak interaction resulting from @ xmath0dijet coupling . the value is the same for the @ xmath160 - @ xmath161 mixing operator . the @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 mixing amplitude is obtained by taking @ xmath162 , and taking @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 in the case of @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 coupling . the mixing amplitude of@ xmath111 - @ xmath112 induced by the @ xmath165 term is expected to be very large to the point of prediction than @ xmath166 corresponding to the long distance sm one . on the other hand , @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 coupling ##s induced by the @ xmath167 term have a large @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 ##8 contribution ( corresponding to the @ xmath135 term ) , which is similar to the long distance sm one . however , the short distance sm contribution of @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 coupling is small compared to the experimental value , @ xmath168 it is expected that the distance contribution of the term will exceed the experimental value . for our example , it is also reasonable to assume that @ xmath84 coupling induced by the cdf @ xmath0dijet term will yield predictions from @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 coupling . note that the s - term associated with the term @ xmath169 will transform into @ xmath170 , assuming 100 % of @ xmat##h171 - the combination results in @ xmath49 ##2 . one can also choose to make the @ xmath109 and @ xmath84 interactions non - interacting . however there is a negative contribution to @ xmath172 ( @ xmath173 ) , compared to @ xmath174 ( @ xmath175 ) . this contribution may be negative resulting in one of the @ xmath176 to be much smaller than the other . this discussion goes back to the first two cases above . we may be able to eliminate some of the @ xmath177 interactions and the other @ xmath178 interactions , such as @ xmath179 and @ xmath180 and @ xmath181 to create @ xmath182 . but to make @ xmath183 similar to that described above , this raises the question how strong the interaction is . while this may be enabled by the spontaneous process to produce the correct interaction states , this problem is beyond any of this , and we must limit ourselves to phenomenological considerations instead . we assume that the interactions with @ xmath51 correspond to the @ xmat##h106 , where @ xmath148 only is a phenomenologically correct value . now let us see if the two pairs and their diquarks are different . the phenomenological analysis of the color pairs and their mixing can be done by @ xcite . the smallest diquark @ xmath52 with the information needed to generate cdf @ xmath0dijet ##s will lead to too much mixing of @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 and @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 in comparison with others . from fig . ( [ di - int ] ) we can see that mixing of @ xmath185 at tree level will create a mixing constraint for @ xmath111 - @ xmath112 if @ xmath186 . the mixture is expressed by @ xmath187 . tree level mixing for @ xmath188 is then expressed by @ xmath189 only . these # ##s can be calculated by choosing @ xmath190 and mixing @ xmath191 , where @ xmath192 is a cabibbo - type. however , despite the partial control of the tree level contributions , the loop level contributions are very large . one also has to mix in between the tree and loop level contributions . this also presents the problem of fine tuning . although this is rather difficult and difficult to use for constructing a model similar to the box model , from a phenomenological point of view it is not ruled out completely . the two diquarks @ xmath193 do not have the 1 - level loop - loop coupling , but can be combined at the 2 - level level of the box model . because the diquark @ xmath78 is a @ xmath40 , and @ xmath65 is time - dependent . the cdf @ xmath0dijet model has a large contribution of @ xmath92 . for example , let us consider the following interactions with @ xmath195 and @ xmath196 in the @ xmath197 model : @ xmath198 the coupling to @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 the coupling from @ xmath78 - @ xmath199 for @ xmath200 and @ xmat##h201 gev as measured from the cdf @ xmath0dijet ##s , which is double that of the standard - scale value above , due to the coupling factor @ xmath202 . the coupling @ xmath203 can also produce an excess of strangeless charm decay , such as @ xmath204 . the coupling produces a strangeless charm decay [ , @ xmath205 , \ ] ] where we call @ xmath206 the excess , with the standard scale value of 100 % ( including the strongly coupling contribution ) for @ xmath207 and @ xmath208 gev , which agrees with the experimental value of the coupling factor @ xcite : # ( @ xmath209 . we know that @ xmath78 is insufficient to explain the cdf @ xmath0dijets ) , but the result can be obtained by using the best approximation to left - handed ##ness . in the case of @ xmath53 , a similar calculation as in the previous section can be done by placing @ xmath211 and @ xmath212 in the @ xmath197 family . #this means , @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 box diagram for the @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 coupling effect due to the color anti - symetricity , @ xmath213 and the @ xmath18 - @ xmath18 box diagram disappears . as a result we get : @ xmath214 for @ xmath215 and @ xmath216 gev which is different from the @ xmath0dijet diagram , the box diagram is the same as of the x - box diagram . the coupling will also lead to the strangeless effect with probability of 1 % . since those effects will be unknown in hadronic physics , they will limit this solution to the uncertainty level . in the case of @ xmath76 diquark , the diquark matrix is a square matrix , @ xmath218 the @ xmath1 - @ xmath18 box diagram will vanish due to the color anti - symmetricity . the solution to @ xmath114 - @ xmath115 coupling effect is @ xmath219 where @ xmath220 if we take @ xmath##221 , @ xmath222 and @ xmath208 gev , the @ xmath18 ##8 is about as large as the squared root of ##e . however , @ xmath223 is the density function , and therefore , one can choose @ xmath224 and @ xmath225 to be used to measure the sign mixing process . ( hence the name , @ xmath226 . ) thus , the mixing process can be measured with precision . there is no contribution to strangeless proton decay under this theory . we note that the two ##less states , @ xmath76 and @ xmath53 , can only have a leptoquark , @ xmath227 of them , and this presents a serious problem of the very fast proton decay . one can avoid the fast proton decay by breaking the symmetry @ xcite , and a fast quantum number mixing process , such as proton - proton exchange which can be observed along the field lines @ xcite . we compare the results in table [ table1 ] for the classical theory of the quantum numbers and fcnc theory . we conclude thatthere are scenarios which are consistent with fcnc data . different methods of calculating these scenarios should be considered . in the next section , we will consider the scenarios for the accelerator and lhc . . determination of parameters from the fcnc data of the experiment to all the cdf @ xmath1 + dijets . [ id = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , id = " ^ " , ] the single diquark @ xmath76 can interact with left - handed particles via teller - teller interaction , @ xmath228 the coupling @ xmath229 is very different from the coupling to the right - handed particles . although the @ xmath49 production cross - section is dominated by the left - handed particle ##s , the corresponding @ xmath18 production cross - section can be altered . in ref . [ rhic ] , we can show how the cross - section would change by changing the coupling to right - handed particles for @ xmath76 particles . with the relative coupling of @ xmath230 to the second generation particles , @ xmath231 would have the sameproduction cross - section for the @ xmath232 case , as previously calculated . coupling to right - handed ones is also possible for @ xmath194 cases , but not for color - coded , @ xmath233 and @ xmath210 cases . note that @ xmath49 ##5 cross - section has large dependence on the coupling to the right - handed ones , while @ xmath105 production cross - section has small dependence on the coupling to the left - handed ones , because @ xmath234 coupling is weaker than the @ xmath235 coupling . in the rhic , using the properties of the term ##s @ xcite , it is possible to determine the chiral ##ity of the diquark relative to itself . the partonic s coupling , written as @ xmath236 where the terms describe the parton - helicity ( chirality ) , is defined to be @ xmath237 for the case we studied . however , this will be the opposite of the left - handed coupling @ xmath238 which is given by the cdf @ .##math0dijet ##s , and the left - handed case @ xmath229 which is missing . . with the study of the local parton distribution distribution of particles using probability distribution theory , it is possible to derive the partonic distribution distribution from the hadronic observables . however , the statistical analysis is outside the scope of this article . and @ xmath239 gev . @ xmath240 + @ xmath6 of the same type is observed . the signal ( s ) is produced by the same @ xmath2412 decay process without @ xmath85 - . ##ing . the signals in @ xmath76 type are observed without coupling to right - handed particles ( solid ) , and with coupling to left - handed particles with @ xmath242 ( solid ) . [ rhic ] ] at the lhc , @ xmath1 + @ xmath18 + @ xmath99 + @ xmath18 decay followed by @ xmath243 decay to produce the same event . the same cross - coupling at the lhc with @ xmath244 decay##v is also shown in table [ table2 ] . the three observed processes are similar to those at the tevatron ; @ xmath245jets , @ xmath246 and alpha - particle background . the data for the signal - to - background ratio at the lhc can be found in ref . @ xcite , for example . the @ xmath1 + @ xmath18 and @ xmath99 + @ xmath18 processes have large cross - correlation as can be seen from table [ table2 ] , especially for the diquark - based processes . in the example in ref . @ xcite , after taking into account the observed @ xmath0jets process , the @ xmath247 process in the @ xmath76 model can be compared with the signal - to - background ratio of @ xmath248 for the experiment with @ xmath249 [ gev ] . assuming the expected detection signal to be @ xmath250 , the expected detection signal for the @ xmath251 process is @ xmath252 [ fb @ xmath6 ] in this case . for the 1 - d##et all ##e , the signal - to - noise ratio is assumed to be @ xmath254 , so a better understanding of the background data is needed to explain the excess . we have studied the possibility of explaining the cdf @ xmath0dijet excess by using the particle @ xmath18 ##4 . with these particles , and coupling to the nuclei , they can go into dijet which is one of the main properties of the @ xmath0dijet excess . there are three other particles , @ xmath255 , @ xmath256 , @ xmath257 , which all have non - renormalizable strong coupling with the nuclei . not all of them can completely explain the @ xmath0dijet excess . because the @ xmath0dijet excess has a strong coupling to the same pair of particles and to the higgs coupling to them , the observed coupling must also be consistent with the observed background data . we have derived fcnc ##s from anti - background data . we find that without all of the observed coupling to have a consistent coupling , all of the data , .the @ xmath258 , is in agreement with fcnc theory . we , however , find that the @ xmath259 , @ xmath260 and @ xmath261 can be considered consistent with our observations . since we restrict our studies to phenomenological aspects of these hypothetical processes , we find that a concrete realization of their behavior is difficult to achieve . even if using a mathematical representation to describe the behavior of the correlation matrix , for example the square root representation of @ xmath109 for the loop , it is not the case that they are consistent at some level . in this regard , all the models described above need to be considered for fine tuning until a concrete realization is achieved . the prototype of the first such model is the @ xmath40 ##8 , and it also includes @ xmath98dijet and at least 1 / 3 of the @ xmath262 process , which is not observed with a resolution of 1 gev resolution . we have proposed two models for the diquark signal of @ xmath263 process , the rhic and the lhc . if the cdf signal is the diquark signal , it will befollowed by the first lhc experiment . the rhic experiment will attempt to identify the diquarks . after completing this study , the cdf published an updated analysis @ xcite with data collected prior to december 2010 leading to an overall excess of 4 . 3 fb @ xmath6 . their results were consistent with their original analysis @ xcite and increased the excess to 4 . 3 @ xmath7 . the d0 group has published their results of an analysis @ xcite with an integrated ##osity of 4 . 3 fb @ xmath6 . they did not find any @ xmath0diget ##s . although d0 is not looking at the data , the data differs in some areas which could be an additional cause for confusion . we are not in a position to decide which results will remain and which has to be included among the other results . we believe that a discussion of some of the cdf data is still possible . our results are not supported by the current cdf data . m . chiappetta , m . layssac , j . l . renard and g . verzegnassi , phys . 54 * * * , 789 ( 1996 ) ;
