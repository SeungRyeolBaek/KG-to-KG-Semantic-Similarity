symmetry ( susy ) is one of the most important extensions of the standard model . this extension avoids the gravity problem and the string theory problem at the planck scale @ xmath1 . it also assumes the existence of superpartner of the standard model ( sm ) particles . from the above definition , their energy should be in tev range , and these particles can be observed in tevatron and large galaxy clusters ( lhc ) . mechanism of susy breaking and its relation to the local supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) dynamics is one of the most important topics in the susy theory . in some cases , this mechanism is extended to high energy particles just at the electroweak ( em ) scale , e . g . , planck scale or planck scale . if the mechanism is known , the energy and the structure of susy particles at the em scale cannot be predicted for a large number of particles . however it may be possible to test and predict the mechanism by a method by solid - to - solid - state ( fcnc ) scattering in the infrared . if susy breaking is caused by gravity , the structure of susy and spectrum of particle are known .khler potential . in the next section , we focus on the no - scale structure khler potential , in which the hidden sector and the real sector are defined as follows : @ xmath2 where @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 are hidden sector fields and real sector fields , respectively . this type of khler potential is further developed in ref . @ xcite with @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 . the results of the khler potential ref . ( [ e : noscalekahler ] ) are that both the vector and trilinear vector fields ( z - fields ) vanish with the coupling constant of @ xcite . the main contribution of susy particles are gaugino ##sities . hence this potential is highly interesting , and phenomenological calculations are possible with a few assumptions . the result of ref . ( [ e : noscalekahler ] ) is that behavior of the hidden sector and the real sector is completely invariant , and contributions of susy particles to fcnc are insignificant . hence this khler potential is highly interesting from the perspective of the susy particle model . the no - scale structure of the khlerthis is true in many cases . it has been shown that in some models of string theory , for example , interacting @ xmath7 heterotic string theory , khler potential is the large - scale form @ xcite . if the hidden sector and the sector ##s are contained in the superspace ##s of the supergravity lagrangian , the khler potential is indeed given by , e . ( [ e : noscalekahler ] ) . in the simplest cases , the gaugino potential can be obtained if the hidden sector fields map to the gauge multiplets via the gauge wave function . then it has been pointed out that the form e . ( [ e : noscalekahler ] ) is obtained only in a two - dimensional model with two branes , namely , m - type @ xcite . in this model , the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other . it has been shown that the form of the khler potential of the string theory obtained by dimensional analysis is , e . ( [ e : noscalekahler ] ) @ xcite . if the visible sector fields live on the sector , gaugino and the su##sy jumps from the closed sector brane to the open sector brane and the no - scale boundary condition is satisfied at the compactification point of the first particle ( gaugino mass @ xcite ) . in the no - scale scenario , degrees of freedom of susy breaking particle distribution are high because all non - universal and susy breaking particles have gaugino mass and higgs - mass @ xmath8 at the gut scale where the boundary constraint is satisfied . the phenomenological aspects of this model have been studied in the past , mainly focusing on the energy level . the upper bound and the boundary condition ( i . e . , the breaking particle can only break the lsp if the non - limit is satisfied ) were considered and the structure of the configuration space was considered . for the boundary condition , the following three cases were considered . first , universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . in this case , the boundary constraint is satisfied and also the limit @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 are satisfied since stau ##b to = 0 @ xcite . the second case is that universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . and the third case is that non - universal ga##ugino constraints are given at the gut scale . in this case the , higgsino - sneutrino will be the lsp . in the first two cases , it is clear that the latter problem is much larger than the former case . in the same section , the constraints from the universal higgs for @ xmath11 and the branching limit for @ xmath0 are also used to describe the no - scale scenario . using these constraints , we will show that almost all the parameter region is important when the gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . however , when the minimum constraint is met at the gut scale , a small parameter region is excluded . we will consider the constraint that the non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . we will show that these constraints are satisfied when the higgsino - or neutralino is the lsp . this section is organized as follows . in section [ sec : noscalsebc ] , we discuss the phenomenological aspects of the no - scale scenario , including those of the direct interaction limit and the branching limit . in section [ sec : higgsbsgamma ] , we will consider these constraints from the gut##ggs mass parameter and @ xmath12 * . some of these parameters for the tevatron are also given . our results are summarized in figure [ 2 : 1 ] . in this paper , we will discuss phenomenological properties of susy particles with one - loop boundary conditions , giving estimates of the upper bound and the mass function for lep particles . we consider the following three scenarios . * universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . * we call this scenario the minimal scenario . * universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale @ xmath13 . in this paper , we consider the parameter su ( 2 ) to be the minimum at the gut scale as a special example . * non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . if one of the three boundary conditions is satisfied , the mass of susy particles at the gut scale and their contribution to fcnc can be calculated . in this paper we use the one - loop level rges to calculate the total susy particle mass distribution at the gut scale . the higgsino mass parameter @ xmath14 is satisfied as the minimum mass at the one - loop level . next , we consider the minimal scenario . thethis means , the following boundary condition is satisfied at the large scale , @ xmath15 where @ xmath16 is the universal invariant , and @ xmath17 is the trilinear gauge invariant . with this boundary condition , bino and right - handed sleptons are smaller than the susy ##ons . their dimensions are constant , @ xmath18 from fig . ( [ fig : minimalmneumtau ] ) we know that the smallest right - handed slepton is the lsp if the half - term @ xmath19 is zero , i . e . , @ xmath20 . but this parameter region is excluded from the above formula . on the other hand , lep - calculations give the upper bound on the cross section for smuon - interactions , @ xmath21 for @ xmath22 and @ xmath23 @ xcite , and the parameter region @ xmath24 is shown in fig . [ fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] , the regions of the parameter region are shown in the @ xmath25 figure . the lines are the dotted - dotted line and the dash -of the dot - dot - dot system , given the coupling constant and lep is given by smuon mass , , and . so the minimal case is given by . here we consider the fact that the two gaugino masses are both above the gut scale . in the special su ( 2 ) case , the left - handed slepton reduces to 1 - plet , and the lower scale parameter makes slepton much smaller . for example , when @ xmath26 the bino mass and the right - handed slepton are above the gut scale , also called , @ xmath27 . the upper bound is not satisfied because the stau search is incomplete , and neutralino is the lsp of the scale parameter of @ xcite . in the fig . [ fig : limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ fig : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , the same figures as in the fig . [ fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are plotted . but in the minimal case , the stau search figure for lep @ xcite is not satisfied because the difference between @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 is largethan is the usual limit and it must be larger than the smuon bound . from these results we see that the @ xmath29 lsp is invalid unless @ xmath30 is greater than - 1 . the null stau lsp can also be avoided if gaugino ##s at the gut scale are non - zero @ xcite , i . e . , the following boundary condition is valid , @ xmath31 this boundary condition can be used only at the gut scale @ xcite . in this case , not only bino - like neutralino , but also proton - like , higgsino - like neutralino and sneutrino can be the lsp . for @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 , the lsp is proton - like neutralino . for example , when @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 , the proton mass and the slepton mass are ( note that in this case the left - handed sleptons are heavier than right - handed sleptons ) ; @ xmath36 the higgsino is the lsp if @ xmath37 . for example , when @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 , then the higgsino isand the left - handed slepton particle . @ xmath40 in the two examples given above , neutral particle or higgsino is the lsp . in order from to . [ fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] - [ fig : limit12r232r0 . 5negmu ] we see that neutral particle is the lsp in the transition time , so it is cosmologically invariant . in the next section we take into account the lep 1 bound and the upper limit . we see that the minimal scenario is severely constrained , but the other two scenarios are not . in this section we also see the new higgs 1 bound and @ xmath41 bound . thus we can see , in the above two examples , not only the minimal scenario but also the other two scenarios can be constrained very well . we will answer the question whether this case can be solved in the tevatron . ##time or space . before we publish the final results , further studies on our understanding of the higgs mass and @ xmath12 are in progress . it is well known that radiative confinement is possible when the current higgs mass is constant @ xcite . in the above example , thethe higgs mass is measured by means of the one - loop level of potential @ xcite . this result is obtained from the renormalization level of the gauge theory of the two loops ##over , @ xmath42 . we compare our result with the two - loop result , @ _ feynhiggs _ @ xcite , and conclude that the difference between these two results is less than 5 gev as long as @ xmath30 is closer than 5 . when @ xmath30 is closer to 5 , the difference will be 5 gev . so , as we will see here , higgs upper bound plays an important role in @ xmath43 . and the one - loop results also make the higgs mass larger than that measured at the one - loop level . so our result is correct and is not significantly influenced by the one - loop results . we calculate the result , where the effective higgs mass is less than the expected 100 % s . t . yield from lep - 1 , @ xmath44 @ xcite . in the latter case , @ xmath12 is calculated from the edge ( lo ) of measurements @ xcite , and compare it to the @ cleo .. in the mssm , chargino contributions can be compared to the lo and the higgs contributions . they cancel with ( cancel ) each other when @ xmath45 ( @ xmath46 ) . the difference between the lo and the leading - to - tail particle ( nlo ) contributions can be seen only when interference among the contributions of the lo is replaced by the nlo contribution . as we can see , however , the @ xmath41 constraint is relaxed when the interference is constructive . in the case of constructive interference where the contribution from the nlo contribution would be zero , this constraint is not too severe . thus we see that our mass is not affected directly by the cancellation of the nlo contribution . for the final result , we use the % n . d . result from cleo , @ xmath47 @ xcite . then we use the above formula for the general result . the result for @ xmath48 is shown in fig . [ 1 : limitmimposmu ] . in this case , for the @ xmath30 result , the particle mass is not so large that radiative expansion of @ xmath49 which affects the higgs contribution is neglected . ( for example , @xmath50 gev and @ xmath51 gev for @ xmath52 gev and @ xmath53 ) . now the higgs mass limit affects this region strongly . in fig . [ fig : limitmimposmu ] , the higgs mass limit and @ xmath12 bound for the @ xmath54 region are shown . the regions below the neutral line and above the neutral line are represented by the higgs mass and @ xmath12 bound , respectively . the region of @ xmath55 represented by lep and @ xcite is also shown in this figure . from the figure we see that the higgs mass limit finally reaches the region where the stau lsp is defined . note that , as we mentioned above , the bounds we have on the higgs mass may be wrong , because the closed bound states may actually affect the higgs mass . the same result as for @ xmath56 is shown in fig . [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] . the @ xmath12 bound has the ##ization , since chargino coupling to @ xmath0 works with neutral and neutral higgs particles simultaneously . the region above the solidit is replaced by @ xmath12 constraint . we see that only one of the two constraints is sufficient to cover all the cases where planck bound and the smuon mass limit are equal . so if anti - gravity is zero , i . e . , the planck limit is zero , this case with @ xmath56 is possible . now we consider the planck limit in the case that the planck scale is smaller than the gut scale . as a simple example , we take the theory su ( 2 ) as the limit for the planck scale . in fig . [ fig : limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ fig : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , limits are given for positive and negative @ xmath14 , respectively . in these cases , we use @ xmath58 gev . for @ xmath48 constraint , the limit of the small and susy of @ xmath59 can be as small as about 1 gev , which is the lsp of @ xmath60 gev . for @ xmath56 , as in the gut model , @ xmath12 constraint is zero , and @ xmath59 can be larger than= 280 gev . we also measured the slope of the plot of @ xmath61 from @ xmath62 to @ xmath63 , and found that the slope of the resulting plot did not change too much . according to 1 . @ xcite , tevatron - like particles can reach up to @ xmath64 gev for decay into @ xmath65 . but if @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 , susy particles can be observed at the peak . in this case , trilepton from chargino - neutralino decay with @ xmath68 , @ xmath69 , @ xmath70 is one of the candidates for susy particles . suppose that the two bodies of @ xmath71 interact . then the result , the first dilepton from @ xmath72 , can be observed . the two body experiment allows us to calculate the total energy of the interaction of two bodies of the @ xmath73 . it is expressed in terms of the neutralino mass and the slepton mass of , @ xmath74 . the [ symbol : mllmax ] , the number of@ xmath73 = @ xmath61 as expected . next we measure @ xmath75 . note that when @ xmath61 changes , the left - handed mass changes sizably and the neutralino masses do not . thus we can measure the mass difference among them and the result for @ xmath61 , which corresponds to the compactification observed in the inner space experiment , by measuring @ xmath73 . on the other hand , since only @ xmath76 gev is measured for @ xmath45 , the tevatron mass detector can not handle this data , and we have to perform lhc measurements . first , we point to the fact that gaugino masses are non - zero on the planck scale . we consider the first three cases , gut - like neutralino lsp , higgsino - like neutralino lsp and the tau sneutrino lsp . we can find that in the gut - like neutralino lsp and tau sneutrino lsp cases , this is not too important , if we use higgs ##ino * and @ xmath12 * , but in the higgsino - like lsp cases wheresince are as small as sleptons and charginos , the total higgs mass has to be small , and hence the higgs mass also is small . next , we consider the go - lsp case . the results for @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 are shown in fig . [ fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] and fig . [ fig : limit12r432r2negmu ] , for @ xmath46 and @ xmath45 , respectively . in this case , we have a very small higgs mass since @ xmath77 is allowed and so are the masses of particles . however , for @ xmath46 , @ xmath78 can be as large as 100 gev for @ xmath43 , where the mass of the lsp @ xmath79 is around 100 gev . for @ xmath45 , the @ xmath12 case is much larger than in the @ xmath46 case , @ xmath80 is allowed , which leads to @ xmath81 . thus the go - lsp with mass around 100 gev is allowed . analysis of the upper bound .this pair is shown as point a ( @ xmath46 ) and point b ( @ xmath45 ) in table [ tab : spectrum ] . of the two points , @ xmath59 is chosen to be at the same distance so that the conditions are satisfied . in general , however , signals of @ xmath28 and @ xmath82 are highly different when it is the lsp . in particular , from table [ tab : spectrum ] , we know that the mass difference is less than 1 gev . even the signal from @ xmath70 is very small and trilepton - counting is not possible because the # ##off shows the total mass distance of the signal from @ xmath83 to be less than 1 gev @ xcite . however , results in these cases were discussed in detail . it was shown that in case of @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 , susy ##s which are different from those in the first case can be detected . the high resolution needs to perform radiative analysis to detect @ xmath85 @ xcite , which is part of this problem . it requires further analysis to understandthe result depends on the model . since the constraint for the sneutrino lsp ##s in the @ xmath86 case is equal to those in the non - lsp case , we see the constraint for @ xmath46 . in figure . [ tab : limit12r2 . 532r1 . 5posmu ] . in the figure , we see @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 . note that the value of the lsp depends on @ xmath30 and the sneutrino is the lsp for @ xmath89 . an example of the observed scenario is given at the figure shown below . [ tab : limit ] . in this case , trilepton decay ##s from @ xmath90 , @ xmath91 , @ xmath92 . since @ xmath93 , @ xmath94 of the signal from @ xmath82 , is unknown and this event will be difficult to be detected . we therefore need certain conditions to observe this scenario . first , we go to the higgsino lsp case . higgsino lsp # is observed when @ xmath77 is less than xof @ xmath78 , which means that the particles are smaller than . the # gaugino ##va ##c . is the one - dimensional limit to the higgs mass which means the higgs mass is constant and the higgs mass limit is ignored . the corresponding values from fig . [ fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are given in fig . [ fig : limit12r232r0 . 5posmu ] ( @ xmath46 ) and fig . [ fig : limit12r232r0 . 5negmu ] ( @ xmath45 ) for @ xmath95 and @ xmath39 . in order to obtain the higgs mass limit , @ xmath78 must be smaller than about 10 gev . for the result with @ xmath12 , this is important , except for @ xmath45 , where @ xmath96 is ignored . some of the constraints in this case are given the values d and e in the [ fig : figure ] . here we have obtained the exact value of @ xmath78 where the constraints are satisfied . we assume that the lsp value isand at least @ xmath97 for @ xmath46 and @ xmath98 for @ xmath45 . but this model can also be found in the tevatron # ##time . the gut - scale and boundary conditions are satisfied in both cases of susy models . this model is useful because it is very accurate and can be a solution to the susy model problem . in this case we studied the effects of the new higgs mass and @ xmath41 constraint on susy models with the boundary conditions . first we considered the special case where the new gaugino moments are obtained above the gut scale . this case has been successfully solved by the measurements of lep and the upper bound is , under the assumptions of the standard m - theory . we found that the higgs mass constraint and @ xmath41 constraint are not taken into account , but since all the allowed region is there , a very large allowed region for @ xmath48 . then we considered the case that the boundary condition is obtained above the gut scale . since the boundary condition is not satisfied , this part of the parameter space is excluded . in the @ xmath46 case , tevatron had a chance toand susy instead of trilepton ##s . the mass @ xmath61 can be determined by measuring the outer limit of the mass of the particle at the @ xmath73 . as for the @ xmath45 case , since @ xmath99 is small , we have to use lhc . here we consider the case where non - zero gaugino statistics are known at the large scale . we note that the higgs ##ino mass is lower than the higgsino lsp , because the ##ons are as large as sleptons and charginos . the masses of the higgsino - and neutralino can be less than about 245 gev and 370 gev for @ xmath46 and @ xmath45 , respectively . in the proton lsp and sneutrino lsp cases , the mass of the lsp can be as large as 400 gev . however , the mass difference between the lsp and the particles . in the nucleus is much smaller than in the proton case , and experimental conditions will be required . the author would like to thank t . yamaguchi for understanding the long , hard research and the importance of the paper . he also thanked t . mor##oi and m . a . nojiri for more information . j . ellis , a . kounnas and d . v . nanopoulos , nucl . b247 ( 1984 ) 373 ; j . ellis , a . b . lahanas , d . v . nanopoulos and a . tamvakis , phys . b134 ( 1984 ) 439 ; a . b . lahanas and d . v . nanopoulos , phys .
