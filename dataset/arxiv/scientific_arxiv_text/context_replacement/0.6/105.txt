shape memory effects ( sma ) have received a great deal of attention due to their many industrial applications , especially in semiconductor devices and electronic devices . the shape memory effect also gives rise to superelasticity , which finds application in stents and reference materials . the shape memory effect is related to the classical martensitic ( diffusionless ) phase transformation . it has been shown that the martensitic transformation can be controlled by magnetic fields , heat or pressure , and the mechanical properties of materials , therefore , can be altered significantly . in some cases , like those discussed in the previous section , this can significantly change the properties and the temperatures of the materials , demonstrating the properties of these materials , and their mechanical properties , and the high energetics of sma . there are several different approaches to study of the shape memory effect . continuum modeling involves simulation of the microstructural transformation , or martensitic transformation , over the very short time scale . particle - size information is incorporated into an energy equation for the strain energy in terms of , and the appropriate boundary conditions to determine the time scale . in continuum models , the individual particles are modeled , and their positions determined by the interatomic interactions , which can be described by ,from first - principles density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations , or a combination of the two . the strain and stress energies come from this approach , which produces microstructures with both finite energy scales ( from finite materials ) and atomic scale ( since the materials have different atomic motions and positions ) . however , in these materials , the electronic degrees of freedom do not exist anymore . first principles dft calculations are so energy dependent that direct measurements of microstructural properties are impossible , but they are useful tools for obtaining precise atomic - scale information about strains , strains and stresses out of experimental data , and for understanding the molecular nature of this behavior . thus , first - principles prediction of the thermal behavior of the high - temperature system towards the low - temperature martensitic system is in itself very useful . the above models can therefore also be used as alternatives to the @ xcite and other models of structure and function . typically , martensitic structures are modeled using the temperature as an input parameter , the best example being the bain bcc - type structure of polymers . however , there is an alternative approach available for materials where the electronic degrees of freedom are related to molecular degrees of freedom ( phonons ) . in the first -in terms of quantum mechanics , @ xcite we start from a high - symmetry crystal structure ( ni @ xmath2 ) and break off the phonons of this structure , with good thermal stability , to obtain the solid - state structure . the freezing of the phonons breaks the symmetry of the high symmetry structure . this theory has been widely used in the study of ni @ xcite and ferroelectric ni @ xcite and has been applied to shape memory materials in our recent study of niti @ xcite . closely related to niti , pdti and ptti are shape memory materials with high mechanical stability and good thermal stability . they undergo a martensitic transition at tunable temperatures : pdti occurs at 810k , but this can be reduced to 410k with 50 % reduction of temperature for ni @ xcite . the high - temperature ` ` crystalline ' ' phase is the cubic cubic @ xmath2 or ( space group @ xmath3 ) , while the low temperature ` ` martensitic ' ' phase has been described as the orthorhombic @ xmath0 or @ xcite ( space group : @ xmath4 ) . the world - class work on pdti and ptti @xcite has shown that the observed electrical and mechanical properties of the @ xmath0 structure are accurately predicted by density - functional theory simulations of the observed stable structure . in this paper , we describe the structural energetics of pdti and ptti from first - principles calculations of phonon distribution as well as total energy . this allows us to study local as well as global dynamics and to model transition states , based on the structural interactions between the @ xmath2 - @ xmath0 and bcc - hcp structures and showing that contribution of unstable stress to the structure is a key component of the structural energetics . in sec . ii , we present the first - principles calculations . in sec . iii , we describe and explain the reasons for the phonon distribution of pdti and ptti in the @ xmath2 structure and for the electronic behavior in which unstable stress and strain are neglected , assuming a high - temperature transition state . in addition , we present results of simulations of the stable structure , identifying and describing mechanisms that affect the observed stability of the structure . this concludes the paper . first - principles total energy calculations were carried out using density - functional theory with a plane - wave pseudopotential approximation . the calculations were performedwith the an _ e - initio _ simulation package @ xcite , performed the perdew - zunger @ xcite parametrization of the low - density approximation ( lda ) . the ultrasoft pseudopotentials @ xcite were calculated . our pseudopotentials are updated with time and for example , we treat the cubic @ xmath5 structure as occupied . the lattice wave functions were calculated on a plane - wave basis , with a mean correlation factor of 278ev . the brillouin ##ian ( bz ) simulations were carried out with the hermite - schmidt simulation package @ xcite with the correlation factor of 1 . 1ev . the lattice cells contained four atoms in the cubic @ xmath2 structure and four atoms in the orthorhombic @ xmath0 and cubic @ xmath1 structures . the simulations were performed with a @ xmath6 monkhorst - schmidt ( mp ) @ xmath7point mesh for the cubic @ xmath2 structure and a @ xmath8 cubic @ xmath7point mesh for the orthorhombic @ xmath0 and cubic @ xmath1structure ( point group : @ xmath9 ) , corresponding to 288 @ xmath10 points in the @ xmath11 band bz of the central cubic cell , 288 @ xmath10 points in the @ xmath12 band bz of the orthorhombic , and 576 @ xmath10 points in the @ xmath13 band bz of the cubic cell . this type of structure limits the bond length to about 1 mev / s . the equation of state ( os ) for the @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 structures was determined using the same method with blchl and @ xcite . the bz structures for the orthorhombic @ xmath0 and the @ xmath1 structures are different . to determine the electronic structure of the two structures , we use the @ xmath0 band structure , with the @ xmath0 structure as a special case of @ xmath1 . the phonon correlation coefficients were calculated with the pwscf and phonon correlation @ xcite , and the perdew - zunger @ xcite paramet##rization of the lda , see below . ultrasoft pseudopotentials @ xcite for pd , pd and pt were calculated according to the modified rappe - rabe - kaxiras - joannopoulos ( rrkj ) method @ xcite with electronic wave functions @ xcite . the electronic wave functions were stored on a plane - wave basis , with a total energy value of 408ev . the lattice parameters were stored up to 9000ev . the brillouin zone ( bz ) calculations were carried out using the hermite - simon ##s method @ xcite on a single _ q _ - point mesh ( corresponding to @ xmath14 . ##ization of the @ xmath15 , @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 coordinates ) in the @ xmath11 lattice model . the value of the coupling matrix for @ xmath18 = 1 . 2ev . these energies and phonon frequency increased to 1 @ xmath19 . the scattering energy was stored on an @ xmath20 _ q _ - point mesh associated with the _ q _ - point mesh . the corresponding phonon frequency wasis derived from the study of phase - space interatomic coupling ##s for the solid box @ xcite . the decision to use the two first - order codes is influenced by the physical properties of materials . vasp has a very efficient method for calculating the strains , strains , and stresses , and up to the lowest order codes , but does not have the density - matrix - based approach of pwscf / phonon . even with the different pseudopotentials and _ _ _ - _ values , the results of the two codes are very similar . for example , the difference in the computed lattice parameters for the @ xmath2 structure of pdti is less than 0 . 1 % , and for ptti the difference is less than 0 . 2 % . all of the eigenvector values calculated by vasp using the standard phonon method and by pwscf / phonon methods show good accuracy , to within 1 % . for the box @ xmath2 structure , our calculations yield the computed lattice parameters of 3 . 112 and 3 . 113 for pdti and ptti respectively . for example , we can use large - scale linear - elastic - standing - wave calculations ( flapw ) for thelda @ xcite . the values are in good agreement with flapw results of 3 . 113 ( pdti ) and 3 . 127 ( ptti ) and also in good agreement with the results of 3 . 15 and 3 . 20 . the phonon frequency properties of the energy spectrum , looking at the electronic structure properties , are shown in figure [ phonons ] . the properties are obtained by taking the square root of the square of the density matrix @ xcite . the values , usually written as and , are derived from the values of the dynamic ##al . however , the structure is highly stable against change of the spin eigenvector . it should be noted that the phonon frequency @ xmath21 _ _ _ _ the product of the energy of vibration of this state ( as measured in molecular spectroscopy ) nor is it the energy difference between two energy levels ( as measured in neutron scattering spectroscopy ) . these two values are known only for a single crystal system . for the structure properties , the stable modes can be compared to the stable modes @ xcite ( as measured in electron and neutron scattering ) at room temperature , and thus the stable modes are known to be the renorma##lized is a function of energy and anharmonic symmetry . phonon reflection relations for pdti ( upper ) and ptti ( lower ) in the @ xmath2 structure calculated at the lda equilibrium parameters 3 . 112 and 3 . 125 respectively . the negative slope of the acoustic @ xmath22 branch corresponds to a pure elastic instability ( @ xmath23 ) . symmetry labels are assigned according to the conventions of ref . with pd / pt at the origin . the imaginary frequencies of the unstable modes are plotted as negative values . , title = " fig : " ] + phonon reflection relations for pdti ( upper ) and ptti ( lower ) in the @ xmath2 structure calculated at the lda equilibrium parameters 3 . 112 and 3 . 125 respectively . the positive slope of the acoustic @ xmath22 branch corresponds to a pure elastic instability ( @ xmath23 ) . symmetry labels are assigned according to the conventions of ref . with pd / pt at the origin . the imaginary frequencies of the unstable modes are plotted as positive values . , title = " fig : " ] the energy levels are related by two terms to the energy density function : the partial derivatives of the potential energy with .to measure energy . the eigenmodes of the energy constant ##s represent the different energy levels , and a negative value indicates a stable equilibrium against the value of the negative eigenvector . although the two possible values of these eigenmodes are in general very different they have the same symmetry group as the eigenmodes of the energy constant . this model is intended to serve as a good approximation to the real energy level if the quantum state described above is not " an excited state " dominated by higher - order interactions and forces , as we see above . the phonon - modes shown in the [ phonons ] show properties of the @ xmath2 structure similar to and much stronger than that of niti @ xcite . there are two areas of phase transition where one , two or even three modes are present , with the modes at @ xmath24 and at @ xmath25 - @ xmath26 . the phonon model suggests that the very low - energy @ xmath2 structures of pdti and ptti are strongly dominated by anharmonic phonons , and should be dominated by stable , neutral modes . the phphonon reactions are highly reminiscent of those of the bcc phases such as ti and si , which undergo martensitic addition to hcp via @ xmath21 @ xcite ( via the @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 - @ xmath26 bcc - phonon ( of ) reactions . the results based on the comparison of @ xmath0 modes of pdti and ptti with the related hcp will be further discussed below . in the unstable mode approach , we account for the energy gain by selecting the unstable mode of the highest symmetry domain , working out the interaction with the mode , and analyzing the resulting effect . in most cases , the mode with the largest positive amplitude will have the highest symmetry gain . however , this is by no means strictly true , as the energy gain is determined not only by the size of the symmetry domain but by higher order coupling as well as the ratio of stress to strain and to modes , both unstable and stable , of high symmetry . however , in pdti this ` ` most stable ' ' mode ( i . e . largest positive amplitude ) occurs in the @ xmath25 - @ xmath26 phase .than to @ xmath24 . this mode is also observed in spin - stabilized bcc materials such as titanium and silicon where it is associated with a phase transition to the corresponding @ xmath21 ( @ xmath27 ) mode . the fact that in the highly correlated complex ( pd / pt ) phase , the only phase transition is to @ xmath0 rather than @ xmath27 shows the importance of anharmonic interactions and strong interactions in the energetics of these materials . eigenmode of the non - interacting @ xmath28 - phonon generates the @ xmath2 mode . this mode forms the @ xmath0 structure using pdti and ptti . the structure is shown below in the @ xmath29 representation , with pd / pt represented by full circles and ti by empty circles . ] [ id = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , id = " ^ " , ] in the two - mode model , there is no guarantee that the energy - dependent end - point of one unstable mode will stablize the two unstable modes of the other- symmetry parameter . in the above example , the cubic cubic unit cell has two sets of ( 2 ) @ xmath30 planes each of which is invariant to spin - orbit coupling : r _ r - _ r . the last such plane in the @ xmath0 structure is @ xmath31 , which loses the symmetry to relax @ xmath32 . the relaxed @ xmath1 structure has three additional symmetry parameters : the symmetry parameter @ xmath33 and the free parameters @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 . these parameters are listed for the relaxed @ xmath1 structure in table [ table : struct ] , and together with the corresponding eigenvector structure in table [ table : structure ] . however , it is important to note that the relaxed @ xmath25 phonon modes in the @ xmath0 structure are in fact not equivalent ( table [ table : phonon - distortion ] ) . the loss of symmetry from relaxation to @ xmath1 can also be achieved by a relaxed @ xmath31 phonon mode , but only if the structure is allowed to decay simulataneously ( table [ table: struct ] ) . this may be the case that in a recent study @ xcite , @ xmath0 was found to be the only stable phase . the transition temperatures of the two stable phases are given by : [ : : struct ] . the @ xmath0 transition temperature is lower than @ xmath2 . a rough estimate of the transition temperature is given by @ xmath36 which gives @ xmath37 of 1050k ( pdti ) and 1755k ( ptti ) . these rough values are much lower than the rough values for the hysteretical transition to @ xcite ( of 800k and 1400k respectively ) , and follow the same general pattern . for no reason has the @ xmath1 transition ever been observed before . the best known temperature differences between @ xmath1 and @ xmath1 , translated into units , are 28k and 39k for pdti and ptti , respectively . this suggests that the transition to the @ xmath1 phase should occur at temperatures well below those at which the calculations were performed , and that our calculations are still consistent with the original experimental data . + + the t - hcp ##n model also suggests that we shouldconsider the two - phase structure , which is the @ xmath38 structure . @ xmath38 is separated from @ xmath2 by a small ( 001 ) distance and slightly lower than @ xcite , so we know that @ xmath38 has slightly lower energy than @ xmath0 . we observe this particular result : at the vertices @ xmath1 , @ xmath39 and @ xmath40 , orthorhombic symmetry is broken . the axis of the primitive cell of this type of orthorhombic ( bco ) ( symmetry group @ xmath41 ) structure is tilted in the * - * direction , but the primitive cell still contains four atoms . although of very low energy ( [ see : struct ] ) , this gives us a good structure for comparison with the @ xmath33 @ xcite . note that a phase change to @ xmath42 would change the @ xmath0 phase and structure . the # ##s of the paths in the structure shown above are important for understanding the bonding interactions . we observe the order of the bonds : @ xmath2 - @ xmath0 , @ xmath0 - @ xmath1 and @ x##math1 - bco . in accordance with the timescale relationship between molecular motion and molecular dynamics , we obtain these states by reducing the atoms to their maximum energy , along with the total stress and strain on the molecule . the remaining two possible degrees of freedom are reduced to a single state by the differences in the energies of the two atoms . for the @ xmath2 bond , we define the structure of the @ xmath0 space group , which is a linear mapping of the atoms along the bond . > from the [ 1 ] , it is clear that there is a total energy barrier for the @ xmath2 - @ xmath0 - @ xmath1 transition , and that @ xmath0 is the total energy barrier for @ xmath1 martensitic transition . the @ xmath0 path can be viewed as the binary equivalent of hcp , and the n path as the binary equivalent of the nishiyama - suzuki ( nw ) transition . using the analogy with the n path for the bcc - hcp transition , we can map the transition to a sequence of ( 1 ) @ xmath30 - @ xcite . phase changes in nm are therefer to images of the transition regions , and we have used the band structures of @ xmath2 , @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 to show this . in pdti / ptti the band structure is dominated by the _ and _ - bands , with the like / # ##ti lying below the atomic level and being completely filled , and the like @ xmath43 - ti lying above the atomic level ( respectively [ bands - pdti ] and [ ti - ptti ] ) , the band structures are separated by about 6ev . the free - electron and @ xmath44 bands are very small , and play no role in the transition except to move free electrons to the d - d plane . the high strain observed in the @ xmath45 band suggests that the two surfaces are very different ( @ xmath0 being the higher strain and @ xmath46 @ xcite ) and this strain may not be related directly to the band structure . in fact , the @ xmath0 - @ xmath1 transition is characterized by the presence of a pseudogap at the atomic level , a characteristic feature of the strain . the two surfaces are very similar , the only difference which is##ilises @ xmath1 , due to the distortion at the atomic level of the pocket of electrons in @ xmath47 . the distortion to @ xmath1 is large enough to cause the observed phase transition which leaves this pocket of electrons in both structures . in addition , we have an _ ab initio _ analysis of the relative energetics of pdti and ptti . in this analysis we found that the room temperature solid state phase will stabilize @ xmath1 , with the ( observed ) @ xmath2 and @ xmath0 structures being fully stable . there are no significant energy differences between the structures , so that the phase transition microstates that belong to the @ xmath1 structure _ _ _ belong to the @ xmath0 and @ xmath2 structures . in contrast to niti @ xcite , the observed @ xmath22 phonon structure is stable . we found that the @ xmath0 structure will be stabilized by the ` ` spin cascade ' ' of phonons of the @ xmath2 structure due to the forces associated with the @ xmath48 structure ##ity , and that all other electric - or - magnetic - field -this eigenvector leads to the zero - strain phase . the @ xmath1 phase leads to a new phase coupled to the @ xmath31 phonon of the @ xmath0 phase . comparing the molecular weights of these phases shows that they are also coupled to one of the @ xmath49 phases , and therefore that the combined mechanism is the structural equivalent of the nishiyama - type bcc - hcp mechanism . we thank r . a . smith , v . v . naumov , and s . bhattacharya for the paper . this paper was published in afosr / muri f49620 - 00 - 00 - 0433 . the calculations were performed on the sgi -
