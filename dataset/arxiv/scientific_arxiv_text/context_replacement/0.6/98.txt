close - packed molecules on nonadsorbing surfaces can form the so - called ` ` polymer brush ' ' @ xcite . these molecules have many practical applications @ xcite , e . g . as molecules @ xcite , for ' ##s @ xcite , for improvement of temperature and mechanical properties @ xcite , for improving the biocompatibility of materials @ xcite , as protective agents against chemical attack ( ` ` nonfouling ' ' ' ) in a laboratory environment @ xcite , microfluidic systems for biomolecule ##s @ xcite , etc . the theoretical study of the structure of molecules in these polymer brushes and their interactions has been an active area of research since ( e . g . , @ xcite ; for recent developments see @ xcite . ) the interaction of the brush with either the larger molecules ( e . g . @ xcite ) or smaller molecules @ xcite and / or with nanoparticles ( e . g . , @ xcite ) has attracted some theoretical interest . however , in some areas of interest there can also be other polymer molecules in the brush , interacting with the surface of the brush .this phenomenon has received much theoretical attention , apart from the case where a liquid brush reacts with a pure polymer solution @ xcite . the latter case is particularly interesting because there is very little interaction of the solvent molecules in the brush and the solvent molecules in the solution , if their chemical nature is known ( ` ` ` autophobicity ' ' @ xcite ) . in fact , the algorithms @ xcite , # - ##hesive ##s @ xcite and simulation @ xcite have predicted the penetration of free chains into nearly pure solutions of similar chemical nature as semi - pure solutions when the total mole fraction of solution exceeds that of the brush , and this prediction has been confirmed by @ xcite . of course , when the polymer solution is very pure , the solution has a high space requirement for penetration of free chains into it and this limits the computational efficiency that can be achieved when one creates a brush by removing molecules from it @ xcite ( see also the ability to simulate this interaction in simulation @ xcite ) . however , since all the energy absorbed by the brush chain when it is removed is of the order of @ xmath22 ##1 @ xcite , there is a nonzero chance that free chains areoriginates from the free chain , and is thus removed from the bulk @ xcite . however , all studies reported so far point to the fact that ( apart from the # ##points ) the chains in the bulk and those in the free are identical . it is necessary , however , to consider the more general case when the bulk chains and those in the free differ in their molecular weight . then the problem of correlation ( as illustrated by using the p - type @ xmath1 - type @ xcite ) between the two types of molecules arises . however , there is also the need to assume that the length @ xmath23 of the bulk chains , and the length @ xmath0 of the free chains are identical . these cases ( in particular , when the bulk and the free chains overlap each other , @ xmath24 ) are of great interest for various applications such as surface treatments , antifouling agents @ xcite , etc . however , to the best of our knowledge , no systematic study of the effect of the two parameters ( @ xmath25 and the length of the free chains @ xmath26 ) on the rate of reaction and the reaction rate has been conducted so far . thethe section on simulation and density functional theory ( dft ) is also an attempt to fill this gap . in section [ simulation ] we describe the results and comment on the theoretical results ; section [ simulation ] presents our simulation results which include both linear and dynamic models ( ddft ) of dft as well as self - consistent field theory ( scft ) results . the simulation results are summarized in section [ simulation _ fig ] . section [ theory ] presents the results and comments . at rolling density @ xmath27 and free chains of length @ xmath28 at equilibrium : ( left ) absorption at @ xmath29 , and ( right ) expulsion at @ xmath30 .

[ models _ fig ] , title = " fig : " ] we also used a fine , three - axis antenna array at @ xcite to generate the # ##ization in our simulation . as well as for practical use in a research laboratory , theif polymers are formed @ xcite , we restrict ourselves to the @ xmath31 of the main chain . the # ##ization consists of two molecules of length @ xmath23 attached from one another to a single structureless molecule . the induced molecular interaction is described by the fene ( strongly induced molecular interaction ) potential , @ xmath32 \ ] ] with @ xmath33 . thus the effective bond strength between the neighbor molecules is @ xmath34 . if and in what case we take the length term of the bond , @ xmath35 , as our bond length . the bond strength is expressed in terms of bond energy @ xmath36 where @ xmath37 is the coupling constant . the nonbonded interactions between polymers and small water molecules are described by the interaction potential , @ xmath38 - [ \ exp [ - \ { ( 1 - n _ { 1 } ) ] \ ; , \ ] ] with @ xmath39 and for the interactions of brush - brush , @ xmath40 , brush - brush , @ xmath41 , and polymer - polymer , @ xmath42 respectively . in our current formulation we use the @xmath43 , @ xmath44 ( that is , in the hydrogen bonding mode with no external solvent effects ) . for @ xmath45 the polymer chains are retained in the bulk whereas for @ xmath46 the solvent directly moves them into the bulk . note that we write where the lattice parameter @ xmath1 then becomes @ xmath47 , and does not use the model number ( which is ) when one uses the parameter @ xcite . the name of the brush is @ xmath48 . the polymer chains are attached to two sites which form a perfect circle pattern on the surface whereby the average distance between the sites is @ xmath35 . determining the maximum molecular weight @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 brush segments , if the polymer chains are separated by both @ xmath35 , and @ xmath51 , i . e . , @ xmath52 brush segments , if the density is , i . e . , the distance between the free chains near the surface is close to @ xmath53 . note that @ xmath54 refers to the case where the solvent concentration in the solvent near the surface is close to the surfaceof the polymer model , @ xmath55 would correspond to a highly concentrated polymer solution . for the liquid model , @ xmath56 corresponds to the boundary conditions since the p - value for the ( concentrated ) phase of polymer solution in the figure , viz . [ fene ] - [ me ] has been calculated @ xcite and @ xmath57 . in all our experiments we use containers made from the melt ##s of @ xmath31 molecules , whereas the number of free chains @ xmath58 of each @ xmath0 ( where @ xmath0 is the solvent @ xmath59 ) is chosen so that the total number of free chain lengths is constant and is equal to @ xmath60 . for a given solvent @ xmath61 , however , we can vary the number of free chains in the container by changing their length @ xmath58 by the solvent @ xmath62 . thus , the mole fraction @ xmath63 of @ xmath64 - free chains is constant for @ xmath65 . note that , as mentioned , solvent ##s are not always used @ xcite . one which uses them instead @ xcite would be a better2 . for a polymer brush with free chains of length @ xmath31 these properties are obtained from the @ xmath66 monte carlo step ( s ) per molecule . the monte carlo step consists of random steps whereby a molecule is chosen at random and one has to move it to a new randomly chosen position @ xmath67 from the original position . we calculate the boundary conditions in the @ xmath68 directions and the cell dimensions in the @ xmath69 directions . the experimental results of the polymer brush with free chains of length @ xmath28 , are shown in fig . [ 1 _ 1 ] for the values of good , @ xmath29 , and bad , @ xmath30 , compared with the original brush . we use the dft to calculate density profiles of free and bound polymer chains . this has been discussed in detail in several papers , so that we will present the most recent results . the starting point of the dft ##s is the formula for the gibbs free energy , @ xmath70 , as a function of the density profiles of free and bound chains , @ xmath71 and @ xmath72, , ( @ xmath73 , where @ xmath74 are the lengths of the chain segments ) . the energy @ xmath70 is related to the total potential energy functional , @ xmath75 , via the legendre transform : @ xcite @ xmath76 = [ [ \ phi _ o ( { \ textbf } { r } _ o ) , \ phi _ o ( { \ textbf } { r } _ o ) ] + \ phi _ { \ alpha = r , p } \ int _ { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } \ int _ { \ alpha } ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } ) f _ { \ alpha } ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } ) , \ phi { r } \ ] ] where @ xmath77 is the magnetic field , which in the first case is due to the quasi - wave like interaction of the chain segments with the magnetic surface , @ xmath78 , where @ xmath79 for @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 respectively , with the same expression for @ xmath8##2 . therefore , the inner ( @ xmath83 ) segment of the bound segment is connected to the outer via a link [ @ xmath84 = \ , ( x _ 1 ) $ ] , where @ xmath85 . note that the net energy of the free and bound segments is derived from the above definition of mc . ( [ 2 ] ) because the dft ##s are applied to a constant volume of the free and bound segments in order to obtain the equation ##g : @ xmath86 and @ xmath87 . in the equation , @ xmath88 is the wall length and @ xmath89 is the wall width . the total free energy term is divided into excess and excess terms , @ xcite with the excess given by : @ xmath90 = \ phi _ { \ alpha = r , 1 } \ , \ { \ int } { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } \ phi _ { \ alpha } ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } ) [ \ ln \ phi _ { \ alpha } ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \2 } ) - [ ] + \ , \ int _ { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } \ int _ { \ alpha } ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } ) = _ { ( { \ textbf } { r } _ { \ alpha } ) \ { \ } . \ dot { fideal } \ ] ] where the bonding potential @ xmath91 for the whole molecule is written as follows : @ xmath92 = \ delta _ { i = 2 } ^ { n - 1 } \ frac { \ left ( | { \ textbf } { r } _ { - { \ textbf } { r } _ { n + 1 } | - b _ i ) } { + \ , b _ { i } ^ { 2 } } , \ dot { vbond } \ ] ] with a similar formula for free radicals , with @ xmath23 replaced by @ xmath0 . this bonding potential brings the chains to a new bond @ xmath93 . the total energy of the total bond energy is expressed as a sum of neutral ( free radical ) and neutral electrons , with the totalcalculated using the weighted average method and the results obtained by mean - field methods , using ref . ( 12 ) - ( 13 ) from ref . @ xcite ; for the sake of simplicity we do not use these methods here . the expression of the total free density functional with respect to @ xmath72 gives the total energy density for the polymer chain which can be integrated with orbital and molecular wave - functions to give the following expression for the density functional of the @ xmath94th end of the polymer chain : @ xcite @ xmath95 where @ xmath96 , \ { { ipz } \ ] ] with @ xmath97 the coupling described in ref . ( [ phipi ] ) , @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 ##9 from the free ( @ xmath100 ) and the bound ( @ xmath83 ) ends of the chain , respectively . they are calculated via the methods given in ref . ( 24 ) - ( 25 ) of ref . @ xcite . the coupling of @ xmath101 and ref . ( [ phipi ] )is used to ensure that the @ xmath94th segment density profile is equal to @ xmath102 . the equilibrium segment density profile for the bound chain is given by : @ xmath103 the segment density profiles for the structure of the free chain can be obtained in a similar way , by calculating the total bond energy change with respect to @ xmath71 and integrating the bond - length and transfer functions . the dft methods given above are used directly to obtain the segment density profiles for free and bound chains . the equations are solved iteratively by picard method , @ xcite with the quantum number of the @ xmath69 ##4 chosen to be 0 . 0325 . the above algorithm determines the segment density profiles for a given level of interaction potential . in addition to the observed molecular dynamics , we have also studied the dynamics of the introduction of bound chains into the substrate , with the change of the interaction potential between free and bound chains from neutral to neutral . to this end , we have developed the ddft method , which is a modified version of the dft method . @ xcite and ##s have shown that the segment density profiles of the free##ted chains are completely independent of the strength of the bond between solvent and ted chains . therefore , in our ddft , we define @ xmath104 to be completely independent and based on the time dependence of the free polymer density , @ xmath105 . the time dependence of the polymer density profile of ted chains is given by the following equation : @ xcite @ xmath106 where @ xmath107 is the non - negative total chemical potential , and dimensionless . @ xmath19 is defined according to @ xmath108 , where @ xmath109 is the diffusion parameter . the density profile @ xmath110 corresponds to the size distribution of ted chains at a given time , i . e . @ xmath30 . for @ xmath111 , the solvent - free bond strength depends on ` ` ' ' ' ' , i . e . we define @ xmath112 . the time - dependent polymer density profile is then defined according to the equation . ( [ phipzt ] ) , with the time - dependent chemical potential given by : @ xmath113 where @ xmath114 is calculated from the##stituting the time - dependent parameter @ xmath105 into the equation for @ xmath115 ( and ) for the parameters @ xmath116 and @ xmath117 . we calculate q . ( [ phipzt ] ) using taylor - nicholson method . @ xcite shows that q . ( [ phipzt ] ) takes the form of a continuity equation with the flux ( or mass ) measured by @ xmath118 . the fact that the ddft approach estimates @ xmath105 via a continuity - based equation shows the value of the mc number of particles in the system , which is consistent with the above set - up . in order to compare the results of the ddft approach with kinetic mc values , we take the flux of @ xmath109 back to 1 and calculate the conversion factor between ddft dimensionless values and kinetic mc number of particles for a given number of segments @ xmath0 and @ xmath26 . calculations for all possible values of @ xmath0 and @ xmath26 are done with the same conversion factor , thus allowing @ xmath109 to be directly related to the @ xmath##0 and @ xmath26 . with the aim of casting more light on the structural properties of the brush process , we have also performed self - consistent field theory ( scft ) calculations of the molecular properties as a function of the interaction energy between the molecules of the system and the free energy ( in scft , this interaction is described by the equation @ xmath1 which is derived in the following way from the above equation ##s - 1 : @ xmath119 ) . the main motivation for carrying out scft calculations is the fact that this approach provides a more efficient way to partition the free energy into entropic and elastic components , thus providing a quantitative ( to dft ) description of the brush process . the basic principles of the scft approach are already known , @ xcite and should not be discussed further for the sake of simplicity . once again , the density profiles for brush and molecular systems are described in terms of the dynamics , the only major difference from the dft approach is that instead of the equation of motion , one uses the time series to set up the equations for the density profiles , which are once again solved iteratively by picard1 ) . for example , the equation for the density profile of the free chain segments has the form : @ xmath120 where the equilibrium density @ xmath121 is derived from the average density @ xmath102 , and @ xmath122 , with @ xmath123 . the l - curve @ xmath124 is independent of the particle size and serves as a lagrange point for the above equation , assuming that the free space is completely empty and no net charge exists . the density profile of the free chain segments is obtained in a similar way . once the profiles are obtained , one can then calculate the mass and charge of the free chains ( relative to the other molecules ) as : @ xcite : @ xmath125 @ xmath126 where @ xmath127 is the total mole fraction of the chains . in fig .

[ x _ t _ t ] \ , \ . in these cases one sees the surface effects on the outer container surface , of the brush . however , the contact of @ xmath128 with the container at @ xmath139 has no effect on @ xmath128 in the case of the small brush , the surface area of @ xmath128 , between the brush and the container wall at @ xmath139 is large enough to explain the three - dimensional effects associated with the finite - size of the brush , called @ xmath140direction . we should note also the poor correlation between 2d and dft data . in particular , the lateral effects , of the brush , can not be distinguished from themonte carlo approach ( for brush ) , fig . [ # _ # _ fig ] . , b . the most significant difference between theory and simulation is observed in the density profile for the case of the brush surface , where dft approach ignores the interactions . this difference is mainly due to the fact that in the dft approach the bond lengths are fixed via beta - decay to a constant value of @ xmath141 , whereas in the simulation the molecules are assumed to be under fene conditions , fig .

[ crit _ fig] , style = " article : " ] as a simple example of polymer ##ization of the molecule we note the existence of a _ _ _ type of interaction @ xmath16 between the brush and free chains . [ crit _ fig ] a shows brush and free chain density simulations for different polymer chain lengths with the same value of the brush - brush interaction coefficient ( @ xmath164 for polymer ##ft and @ xmath169 for scft simulations ) . although experimental and theoretical results differ greatly , there is a fundamental structural difference in that the energy profiles , regardless of the length @ xmath0 of the polymer chain , all intersect in two single points ( inside and outside the molecule ) . the dft simulation shows much the same behavior albeit for a longer @ xmath170 ( as shown here ) . [ crit _ fig ] b shows scft simulations for the excess energy and for the excess energy per molecule ( denoted by viz . ( [ energy ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) , respectively ) as a function of @ xmath166 . one sees here that all the energy profiles intersect in a single point , corresponding to @ xmath171 , and thethe polar parameters go through their changes at this point . therefore , the entropic parameters corresponding to the two values of ` ` inside ' ' and ` ` outside ' ' the lines ( as shown above ) converge to the final value of @ xmath166 as shown in the figure of fig . [ crit _ 1 ] 2 . since for @ xmath172 there is such a distance @ xmath69 from the central brush where the local concentration of free chains is independent of the distance @ xmath0 , and @ xmath173 is a constant for distance @ xmath0 , the value of @ xmath172 itself is assumed to depend on the concentration and / or the length of the boundary line @ xmath23 . we used scft analysis to see how the ` ` local ' ' concentration of @ xmath172 varies with @ xmath133 and @ xmath23 at a given distance : @ xmath174 and @ xmath13 . we found that it increases as @ xmath175 with increasing free chain concentration @ xmath133 , and decreases as @ xmath176 with increasing concentration @ x##math23 of the free chain ( in the latter case , the absorption factor is chosen so that the total absorption factor for free chains @ xmath177 is kept constant ) . here we present our theoretical and experimental models for the rate of molecular transfer / diffusion into , and out of the solvent . with expected time @ xmath178 after an initial change of the interaction between brush and free chains . for @ xmath27 and the simulation was done for @ xmath179 and . the figure shows the reaction model for the reaction @ xmath0 of free chains . the total number of free chain molecules @ xmath60 is kept constant .

[ kin _ fig ] , [ = " image : " ] a . [ kin _ fig ] a shows the filling of the largest possible amount , @ xmath154 , with filling time @ xmath178 after an initial reversal of the relationship between brush and polymer chains . as before , the removal of the brush from the sample and the initial switch ##over of brush - polymer chains proceeds much faster than the previous process . the reaction , which is shown from the right to left . [ kin _ fig ] b , proceeds from an initial rapid rise toward a steady state of @ xmath154 whereby the brush molecules grow faster than those with less @ x##math0 . from the results of the plots to the average rate value of @ xmath154 and the initial rate we can calculate the average rate of growing @ xmath19 as function of @ xmath0 - fig . [ kin _ fig ] a . the results are different for different combinations of free chain concentrations , and one sees that ddft simulations are not in good agreement with the data ##ft . this also holds for fig . [ kin _ fig ] b where again the data is in good agreement with that for @ xmath31 . for the concentration of two free chains ( @ xmath23 = 0 , @ xmath181 = 0 . 5 ) , no simulations are performed and plotted against the data @ xmath178 shows the loss of concentration for the concentrations of free chains with @ xmath61 . the log - log plot shows that @ xmath154 grows as function of @ xmath182 . the average times @ xmath183 are plotted in the plot against the concentration of free chains @ xmath58 . one gets @ xmath184 .

( b ) the same thing . ( a ) but without the ` ` critical ' ' attraction @ xmath147 and fixed @ xmath185 where @ xmath186 . the constant @ xmath187 ( x ) . [ sol _ fig ] , title = " fig : " ] two regimes are used . nonwithstanding , for large values of @ xmath23 , one then has two regimes for the dependence of @ xmath19 and @ xmath0 . in the followingthus , the absorption time is constant and decreases rapidly with @ xmath0 ( compared to @ xmath188 for the shorter brush and @ xmath189 for the longer brush ) . by considering the figure shown in ref . [ # _ 1 ] above , one sees that this # ##ization time corresponds to the point when @ xmath11 of the chains is less than or equal to the average distance between the two ends . when @ xmath0 ( and , therefore , @ xmath11 ) is increased beyond the initial limit , one finds the second regime where the rate of @ xmath19 , while still remaining constant , becomes much slower . we see this slowing down as a halmark of the increased size of the conducting chains when their radius of curvature equals the diameter of the length of the free chain . this regime continues up to the point where the lengths of absorbed and free chains are equal . at this point , for @ xmath190 , the third regime is found at , where the absorption time is about half of the free diffusion time . one can see here an example of the change in the rate of free chain absorption into the medium with the @ xmat##h191 whereby , the surface changes over the boundary conditions lead to increase in absorption rate . [ des _ fig ] a provides experimental and theoretical data for the absorption rate for @ xmath31 , @ xmath61 , and the variation of the amount @ xmath192 . the simulation and ddft data show that at intermediate and late concentrations the time dependence of the absorbed amount follows the value of @ xmath182 . the average absorption rate @ xmath183 becomes smaller as the concentration increases ( see figure ) , although the value of @ xmath154 at the end of the observed time dependence is similar for the concentrations of @ xmath58 . this observation is somewhat counter - intuitive , as one would expect the driving force for absorption ( and , therefore , the absorption rate ) to increase with increasing size of the molecule . the slowing down of absorption rate with increasing size @ xmath0 and size @ xmath133 of the side chains has been also observed @ xcite in a solid medium ( mostly water ) which resembles in many ways the molecular matrix . in fig . [ des _ fig ] b we see the variation of the absorbed amount ,@ xmath186 , for the same concentration @ xmath193 - [ [ crit _ fig ] . we found out that this well known power - law of @ xmath154 was observed only at this critical concentration of @ xmath42 whereas for @ xmath194 where all of our previous work was done , a similar @ xmath195 effect was observed - see . [ 3d _ fig ] ] . thus , in a sense , the second type of effect illustrates the important importance of the temperature difference between bound and free vs . of free chains with time , since : , from @ xmath196 to @ xmath197 from dft ##s . the effect is expressed in two terms . suppose the concentration is @ xmath198 and the time interval corresponds to 25000 ms . the polymer brush is applied at @ xmath199 . ( 2 ) change of the concentration of water molecules into the polymer brush with time for two concentrations @ xmath200 i . e . , @ xmath201 , and @ xmath61 . [ [ _ 3d _ fig ] , p = " time : " ]of free chains with time period since the change from @ xmath196 to @ xmath197 from dft data . the result is expressed in two terms . both the current concentration @ xmath198 and the time period correspond to 25000 years . the polymer brush is located at @ xmath199 . ( 2 ) comparison of the flux of free chains into the polymer brush with time for two samples @ xmath200 i . e . , @ xmath201 , and @ xmath61 . [ kin _ 3d _ fig ] , [ = " fig : " ] in order to shed more light on the observed results , fig . [ kin _ 3d _ fig ] uses ddft data for the time - unit flux for @ xmath105 ( @ xmath58 = 6 , left panel ) and for @ xmath202 ( @ xmath58 = 6 and 12 , right panel ) . in the right panel , instead of the ` ` ridges ' ' of @ xmath105 at surface , a large ridge , usually located in the space above the surface , wraps around it , while another ( smaller ) ridge is located abovethe reverse ( slope ) appears and flux decreases even further inside the brush . from the other side , we can see that for higher concentrations ( @ xmath58 = 1 ) the flux increases over the original value both inside the brush and at shorter times ( thus the same flux value of @ xmath154 seen in fig . [ des _ fig ] for lower values of @ xmath58 ) , but the flux is decreased in the brush at longer times . the reverse phenomenon is probably due to increased flux at higher concentrations and thus the comparison of flux @ xmath183 with @ xmath58 seen in the image of fig . [ des _ fig ] . in this way we study the little known but important phenomenon of oligomer and chain interaction ##s in a solid medium - the result of ( more or less ) chemical interactions between molecules in the bulk and the surface . starting from oligomers ( poly - and poly ) and molecules up to molecular lengths @ xmath0 which is even the length @ xmath23 of the bulk molecules , we have studied the concentration of the surface molecules , the molecular lengths @ xmath154 , and the bulk (the diffusion ( into the polymer brush ) of different concentrations of the free chains for different types of medium to one specific polymer brush . in addition , by combining monte carlo simulations with dft and scft data , we have also extended the range of concentration of the free chains to @ xmath13 in order to test more thoroughly our hypothesis . the most interesting , and - to some extent - unexpected properties of the chemical reactions in the polymer brush that we observe are : * the gradual change of the concentration @ xmath7 with _ _ _ _ _ @ xmath0 , and * the gradual increase of the diffusion with increasing concentration ( i . e . , with the decrease of the concentration and of concentration ) of the free chains from these static and dynamic conditions of # ##ization in general , we observe that both the target medium and the brush itself can change their size and concentration , as observed in experiments of @ xmath203 and the dynamic experiments of @ xmath104 , for different amount @ xmath0 and amount @ xmath26 of the free chains , and different amount @ xmath42 of molecules to the free chains . in particular , thedue to which the molecular size @ xmath104 is affected the absorption is found to be well below that predicted by the current theoretical models @ xcite . nontheless , but in these small amounts we find a gradual decrease of @ xmath104 to reach enough size @ xmath154 . @ xmath104 then increases its concentration up to that close to the concentration of free chains with size @ xmath154 . another interesting phenomenon which still needs further investigation is the related phenomenon of the critical attraction @ xmath204 ( i . e . , molecule - oligomer attraction @ xmath205 ) . at @ xmath206 we find that in empirical as well as theoretical dft / scft that the entropy of all the molecules experiences a value independent of their size @ xmath0 whereas their density experiences a value . the critical attraction @ xmath205 is explained by the existence of a distance from the molecular interface where the probability density functions of the free chains meet . therefore , at @ xmath205 the rate of free chain absorption into the molecule follows a simple linear power law with size @ xmath207 . thus , thefurther research is needed until all these important physical properties are better understood . here at present , we note the existence of three different regimes of the theory of free chain formation as far as the length of the free chain @ xmath0 is concerned . in the first regime the average value for length @ xmath19 increases rapidly with oligomer length @ xmath0 as long as the oligomer length @ xmath208 is less than the length of two chains . the second regime is characterized by a rapid growth of @ xmath19 with @ xmath0 and ends abruptly at @ xmath209 . the third regime of the theory begins for @ xmath180 ( i . e . , the entire free chain will still remain in the solvent ) and is characterized by a constant constant @ xmath19 as far as length @ xmath0 is concerned . indeed , this same general phenomenon has been successfully observed for molecules in various media @ xcite . one of these , ( s . i . ) , acknowledges support from patent no . bi314 / 2009 . another , ( s . i . m . ) , acknowledges support from the alexander von humboldt foundation , vienna .a . smith , j . dent ( nature ) * 38 * , 983 ( 1977 ) . a . de gennes , nature , * 38 * , 1069 ( 1980 ) . a . a . skvortsov , v . a . gorbunov , v . v . pavlushkov , v . v . zhulina , v . a . borisov , and v . a . pryamitzyn , polym . 5 * , 1706 ( 1988 ) . j . cosgrove , m . smith , j . de lahr , j . leermakers , and j . j . a . scheutjens , proteins * 20 * , 1692 ( 1988 ) . j . a . milner , j . a . witten , and g . a . smith , proteins * 21 * , 2610 ( 1988 ) . s . muthukumar and g . a . smith , proteins * 22 * , 965 ( 1989 ) . m . murat and j . a . grest , proteins * 23 * , 4054 ( 1989 ) . j . c . lai andm . klein , ann . chem . phys . * 251 * , 9288 ( 1991 ) . j . a . milner , nature * 251 * , 905 ( 1991 ) . a . halperin , j . tirrell , and j . a . smith , adv . sci . * 93 * , 151 ( 1992 ) . m . szleifer and m . a . carignano , adv . chem . phys . * 138 * , 149 ( 1996 ) . m . cohen , ann . * 94 * , 581 ( 1996 ) . g . s . grest and m . murat , quantum _ monte carlo and molecular dynamics , j _ a _ math . _ , columbia univ . press , new york , 1995 , pp . 476 -
