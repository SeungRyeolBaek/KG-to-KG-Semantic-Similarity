the physical structure of an elastic self - organizing system is axial symmetric . for this reason , the axial symmetric solutions of the maxwell equations are good tools to model massive objects in general relativity . in the past decade , many different solutions were studied for different physical problems . static thin disk solutions were first studied by @ xcite and @ xcite , where they studied disks without radial pressure . disks with radial pressure and with constant density have been studied by @ xcite and @ xcite , respectively . counter - rotating thin disks were studied by @ xcite , and @ xcite . furthermore , disks that were sources of black holes with thin disks were studied by @ xcite and @ xcite . also , static counter - rotating thin disks as sources of the kerr ##ian gravity were studied by @ xcite . counter - rotating disks with radial pressure and static disks without radial pressure were studied by @ xcite , and @ xcite , respectively ; counter rotating disks with constant flow were studied by @ xcite . also , static thin disks as sources of the curved spacetimes from the chazy - curzon - @ xcite and zipoy - voorhees @ xcite models were studied by @ xcite . ., @ xcite obtained an increasing number of new thin disk models that correspond to the original thin disk solutions of kuzmin & toomre @ xcite and mestel & kalnajs @ xcite . thin disk models with electric fields @ xcite , magnetic fields @ xcite , and mixed electric and magnetic fields @ xcite have been obtained . in the following years , new solutions for thin disks models with single and multiple particles of dust @ xcite , gas particles @ xcite and a fluid particle @ xcite were obtained . for a discussion of the new models , see @ xcite and @ xcite . many of the models described above were found using the metric to solve the single momentum - tensor , i . e . an open metric . other thin disk models were found using the same method that consists of solving the metric for the single momentum - tensor of the disk @ xcite . at the first step , the disks can be considered to be dense , what really helps the calculations and gives some useful information . however , in order to find the thick disks the geometry of the disk must be known . several different , very thick disks of different star systems were foundsee @ xcite . finally , the spherical coordinates are derived from the schwarzschild " in spherical coordinates , with the form , rotate , rotate , and rotate " by @ xcite . the application of these coordinates , to any structure , in general brings out their stability . the study of the disks , physically and theoretically , is related to the stability of a particular model . thus , the study of different types of structures , when applied to these disks , can give an insight into the stability of bars , rings and - ##iable structures . however , a structure can cause the stability of a particular model with the sudden appearance of a new type of structure . an extensive discussion of the stability of disks in quantum mechanics can be found in @ xcite , @ xcite and discussed below . in general , the stability of disks in general relativity is studied in several ways . one way is to study the stability of the elliptical orbits around disks . this kind of analysis is done by @ xcite applying the first criterion of stability @ xcite into a more general model . using this criterion , the stability of orbits around black holes formed by bars , rings and multipolar systems was studied @ x##cite . also , this method was used by @ xcite to study the stability of the two schwarzschild thin disks , and thin disks of solid and liquid phases . the stability of circular orbits in complex axisymmetric spacetimes was studied by @ xcite and @ xcite . also , the stability of circular orbits of the lemos - letelier model @ xcite for the stability of a black hole and a giant planet was studied by @ xcite and @ xcite . finally , @ xcite measured the stability of the thin disks without local motion or by measuring their stability curves and their angular momentum . another way of measuring the stability of disks is measuring their angular momentum curves . this study is more complicated than the study of fluid dynamics or physics , because we are taking into account the local motion of the disks . however , there are few articles in the literature on this kind of analysis . a general stability analysis of a complex system , with complex physical and chemical properties , was done by @ xcite . they defined the solution of the state equation as : , i . e . , and . however , this definition is very weak . stability .of thin disks from the schwarzschild metric , the chazy - curzon metric and zipoy - voorhees metric , and their angular momentum equations with the general first order symmetry , were solved by @ xcite , showing that the thin disks without this symmetry are more stable . also , the calculations of the nearly stable schwarzschild thin disks as well as the general # ##s for thin disks were done by @ xcite . in celestial mechanics , models for galaxy clusters and spiral galaxies were developed by @ xcite and @ xcite . in the case of disk galaxies , the thin disk models were developed by miyamoto and nagai @ xcite from the original work of @ xcite and @ xcite for thin disks . . miyamoto and nagai built - up " toomre " models of disk galaxies and derived families of three - dimensional distributions and density distributions . also , @ xcite derived a family of three - dimensional axisymmetric density distributions from the first order plummer metric . the miyamoto - nagai model describes many of the physical properties of disk galaxies , including the # ##s of the mass distribution which are very close to thethe curves of the galaxies @ xcite . recently , two further versions of the miyamoto - nagai model appeared in the literature : a triaxial version @ xcite which has as a special limit the basic spherical fluid model , and a newton version @ xcite which has as a general limit the same basic model . in order to construct a general ##ised ##ition model for fluid , we must determine , first of all , the dynamics of the disk and its stability by combinations of the fluid quantities . the goal of this model is to determine precisely the stability of the strongly rotating miyamoto - nagai disk under a simple first order equation . the calculation is done in the temporal , spatial , angular and radial directions of the variables contained in the angular momentum distribution of the disk . for the strongly rotating disk galaxies @ xcite , the number of variables is greater than the number of variables . this gives the possibility of studying different types of combinations of the fluid quantities . in this case we look for cases in which a change in a particular direction of the disk causes a change in the opposite direction of the fluid variables. the energy momentum tensor used in this paper is described as " weak " , because it has not obtained the general results obtained from the solution of these equations . the manuscript is structured as follows . in sec . [ sec2 ] , we present the energy momentum power law for the thin disk model . the energy momentum tensor is right , with all its components starting from zero . later , in particular , we perform the calculations that will be discussed in more detail in the next part of this article . in sec . [ sec3 ] , we present the thin disk model whose structure is described , i . e . the general metric miyamoto - nagai disk . the details of the energy states and structure , as well as , the conditions that the various components must satisfy to obtain the strong , weak and weak energy states are described . later , in sec . [ sec4 ] , we apply the calculations to the general metric miyamoto - nagai disk ; in particular we study its structure . later , in sec . [ sec5 ] , we present our results . the thick disk model is a special case of the general space - time - space model @xmath0 where @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 and @ xmath3 are functions of the basis ( @ xmath4 ) . ( our coordinates are : @ xmath5 , energy tensor + real , complex and real coordinates with respect to the basis @ xmath6 given by @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 , respectively . ) in the reference frame , the energy momentum tensor of the system @ xmath9 is written with coordinates ( - @ xmath10 ) , where @ xmath11 is the internal energy , and ( @ xmath12 ) are the transverse , linear and transverse forces and forces , respectively . thus , in this frame of reference , the energy momentum tensor can be written as @ xmath13 where @ xmath14 , @ xmath15 , @ xmath16 , and @ xmath17 are the three components of the orthonormal basis @ xmath18 which satisfy the orthonormal equation . note that with the above equation , the timelike angular momentum of the fluid at @ xmath14 and the coordinates @ xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @ xmath17 are the spacelike velocity components of the momentum . therefore , the energy momentum tensor is in the theory , @ xmath19 . therefore , the coordinates used in the energy momentum tensor and the values of the corresponding conservation laws are independent of the coordinates ( @ xmath4 ) used . let us do a direct calculation @ xmath20 of the quantity @ xmath21 of the quantity @ xmath22 where @ xmath23 is the physical quantity and @ xmath24 is the coordinate . writing ( [ x ] ) for each term in the energy momentum tensor ( [ tmunu ] ) and solving the corresponding energy momentum tensor , @ xmath25 , we get @ xmath26 @ xmath27 \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta u ^ \ theta [ \ xi _ \ theta ( \ theta u ^ t + \ xi _ i ) _ \ theta u ^ \ theta ) ] \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta u ^ t [ { \ rm ##t } ( x , u , \ theta u ^ t ) + \ xi _{ 3 , 4 } p _ z z ^ z + \ delta _ r { \ rm g } ( t , z , k _ z u ^ z ) ] \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta \ theta ( - w _ u ^ t u ^ t ) = 0 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath28 @ xmath29 \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta \ theta ( y ^ t u ^ t \ gamma ^ r _ { aligned } ) + \ delta p _ r { \ rm g } ( t , z , u ^ t u ^ t ) \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta p _ \ theta ( y ^ \ theta y ^ \ theta \ gamma ^ r _ { \ theta \ theta } ) + \ delta p _ r ( y ^ z y ^ t \ theta ^ r _ { zz } ) = 0 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath30 @ xmath31 + \ delta p _ \ theta ( z _ \ z y ^ \ theta y ^ \ theta ) = 0 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath32 @ xmath33 \ nonumber \\ & & + \ delta \ theta ( u ^ t x ^ r \ gamma ^ z _ { rr } ) + \ delta p _ z ( u ^ t x ^ r \ gamma ^ z _ { rr } ) \ nonumber \ \ & & + \ delta p _ { \ theta } ( x ^ \ theta y ^ \ theta \ gamma ^ z _ { \ theta \ theta } ) + \ delta p _ z { \ rm ##l } ( u , x , y ^ r x ^ r ) = 0 . \ text { \ } \ ] ] where @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 are the christoffel symbols . in the equation . ( [ x ] ) - ( [ y ] ) we find that the total energy momentum distribution does not obey the classical definition . however , we find particles of length equal or equal to @ xmath36 . for details see @ xcite . besides the conservation equation given by the energy momentum conservation equation , @ xmath37 , there is another energy conservation equation , the equation of density , @ xmath38 where @ xmath39 is the proper number density of particles . the proper number density of particles @ xmath39 ,and the total energy density @ xmath11 is obtained from the relation , @ xmath40 where @ xmath41 is the density of the system and @ xmath42 the total energy density . dividing ex . ( [ varepsilon ] ) by @ xmath14 , using the second term ( @ xmath8 ) and dividing ex . ( [ energy ] ) , we obtain that @ xmath43 and , from the relation @ xmath44 and the energy density of ( [ tmunu ] ) , we obtain the expression for @ xmath45 . putting this differential equation into ex . ( [ rhovar ] ) we now get to @ xmath46 which is the first order differential expression for @ xmath42 . finally , with @ xmath42 multiplied by ( [ pdevar ] ) the equation of motion ( [ continuity ] ) is obtained . for this reason , the differential equation cannot be derived from our numerical solution because , in general , we can always find a solution for @ xmath42 . therefore , the contributions of @ xmath47 and @ xmath42 to the total energy .is taken into account in @ xmath11 . in the case in which the kinetic energy density of the system is zero , the equations of motion can be solved . the physical properties of the disk can be derived from physically or theoretically , e . g . from the fokker - planck equation , where we consider the energy density component of the disk . solving the four equations fokker - planck equation is not an easy task , as much work in quantum mechanics has been done @ xcite . the four equations , ( [ t ] ) - ( [ s ] ) , have four independent solutions , in @ xmath48 . however , at this point , the number of variables is greater than the number of solutions . this leaves the need to consider other types of equations . in this case we are interested in equations in which the velocity component in a given direction corresponds to the pressure component in the opposite direction . for example , if we consider the pressure component of the disk , @ xmath49 , then we can solve @ xmath50 . with the four equations , and without adding any additional constraints to the four equations , the systemhowever , are constant and can be used in our thin disk model . first , we replace the constraint @ xmath51 with the two dimensional constraint @ xmath52 . in this special case , the system of equations reduces to a second order ordinary differential equation . a general , 3d model of the miyamoto - nagai disk is obtained in @ xcite , using the relation between the general # volume model in matrix form and the miyamoto - nagai model @ xcite . these two thin disks are labeled with ( [ x ] ) and the metric , @ xmath53 where @ xmath54 , @ xmath55 is the volume of the disk , and ( @ xmath56 ) are parameters that determine the shape of the density matrix . with this formula , the energy levels and parameters for the general ##ised miyamoto - nagai disk are @ xmath57 } { b \ , \ chi ^ { [ \ frac { 1 } { b } + \ chi ] ^ 2 } , \ dot { b } \ \ & & p _ b = p _ \ chi = \ frac { 1 ^ {\ left [ [ r ^ 2 + ( a + \ xi ) ^ 3 ( a + ( \ xi ) \ ] ] } { 16 \ pi \ xi ^ 3 [ \ frac { 1 } { 2 } + \ chi ] ^ 5 [ - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } + \ chi ] } , \ dot { r } \ \ & & a _ 1 = \ frac { r ^ 2 ( a + \ xi ) ^ 3 } { 16 \ pi \ xi ^ 3 [ \ frac { 1 } { 2 } + \ chi ] ^ 5 [ - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } + \ chi ] } , \ dot { pz } \ dot { pr } \ ] ] where @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 . without extra time we have @ xmath60 in effect . ( [ pr ] ) - ( [ pz ] ) . to satisfy the strong energy condition ( for dark particles ) we can assume that the ` ` ' dark particle ' ' @ xmath61 . the strong energy condition requires @ xmath62 and the weak energy condition requires @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 and@ xmath65 . the parameters discussed in this section satisfy the following conditions . first , the level curves show that this is physically acceptable . we note that these are not the only cases in which the level curves are physically acceptable . in the next section we apply the various parameters of fig . [ sec2 ] to the general # miyamoto - nagai disk described above and study its stability . in applying the above types of parameters to the general # miyamoto - nagai disk we must do two things . suppose that the general ##ised miyamoto - nagai disk is stable in the radial and axial directions . we want to study the stability of a perfect disk . however , in order to satisfy this requirement we need a change in the axial coordinate . from fig . ( [ pr ] ) , ( [ pr ] ) and ( [ pz ] ) , we find that the coordinate variables change rapidly enough to reach the maximum in these directions . the radial coordinate @ xmath66 and the axial coordinate @ xmath67 are related by the following equation : the energy density of the disk divided by the two directionshas to be greater than 90 % of the very small surface energy density . the first equation , and the one given in the paper , lead to a radial displacement of @ xmath68 units and an angular displacement of @ xmath69 units . the remaining 90 % of the energy density that is determined from all the experimental measurements to date can be expressed , if necessary , as a change in the surface energy parameters . we start with the angular displacement of the components @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 . from the experimental data obtained in fig . [ sec2 ] we can see changes in the two components @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 . the system of equations ( [ y ] ) - ( [ x ] ) leads to a second order partial differential equation for the components @ xmath73 , and @ xmath78 where @ xmath79 are units of ( @ xmath80 ) , and also [ fmna ] . for this special case we have , @ xmath81 . note that in fig . ( [ edo2mna ] ) the term @ xmath##82 ##4 , as a parameter . therefore , the expression for @ xmath73 is that of the pressure @ xmath83 , but @ xmath83 has to be derived from us to get that expression . the second differential equation ( [ edo2mna ] ) is solved , with two boundary conditions , one at @ xmath84 and the other at the radial pressure . in @ xmath84 we set the pressure @ xmath73 to be @ xmath85 10 % of the radial pressure @ xmath77 ( [ [UNK] ] ) . in the inner plane of the disk we set @ xmath86 because we set our pressure to be when at the center of the disk and , in that case , to be in accordance with the normal pressure law . we say that our parameters are zero if their values are smaller , but of the same order of magnitude , than the 10 % values of the other parameters . in fig . [ figmna ] , we set the pressure ##s of the radial pressure . in the equation @ xmath87 for the value of the pressure @xmath88 and @ xmath89 . but in the first case , the lower the value @ xmath90 , the better is the probability density . we see that the solution @ xmath73 for ( @ xmath91 ) varies along with @ xmath75 and has uniform behavior . at first glance , the solution @ xmath73 seems to be uniform for all @ xmath75 , but in order to perform a statistical analysis we need to compare for the solution the values of the solution with the values of the total solution . for this purpose , we draw on the phase space and amplitude of the 10 % value of @ xmath77 . we see that the values of @ xmath73 for the solution of @ xmath92 are slightly smaller or , at most , of the same order of magnitude when compared to these 10 % values . in the second case ( @ xmath93 ) , the solution @ xmath73 has the same uniform behavior , but the amplitude of the solution is slightly different . in both cases the solution##s are all below the 10 % value of @ xmath77 . if we simulated a very large region ( @ xmath94 ) with @ xmath95 we found that stability tests were only valid for a small region near the center of the galaxy , from @ xmath96 to @ xmath97 , because the extinction coefficient is less than the 10 % value of @ xmath77 and our original theoretical model is no longer valid . we also performed stability tests for the physical phase velocity of @ xmath98 and the physical escape velocity of @ xmath99 . note that our escape velocity @ xmath14 ( [ 4 ] ) has four modes in the time domain , so we could not use values of @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 to make comparisons with the four modes @ xmath102 and @ xmath103 . for that reason we compared , in short order , the phase velocity of these modes with the value of the escape velocity in the classical limit . in the classical limit of general relativity , @ xmath104 ,we use the well known parameter @ xmath105 . therefore , the maximum escape velocity @ xmath106 can be expressed as @ xmath107 , or @ xcite . with this equation , the equations @ xmath108 and @ xmath103 are stable because their values are both well above the escape velocity value . note that the frequency @ xmath73 does not depend on the frequency @ xmath83 , but the equations @ xmath102 and @ xmath103 do . we performed an analysis for the equations @ xmath102 and @ xmath103 with different values of the frequency @ xmath83 , and we found that when we increase the value of @ xmath83 the equations become more stable . in this case we increase the value of the frequency @ xmath87 . we performed the same analysis for different values of the frequency @ xmath109 , and we find that the results are the same approximate results . therefore , we can conclude that the classical , miyamoto - nagaithis produces only non - stable modes for the flat galaxy , e . g . ( @ xmath94 ) . thus the disk is stable under conditions of the type described in this article . however , if we set the 1 % of the energy released by a peak in the inner part of the disk , setting @ xmath110 , where @ xmath111 of @ xmath112 , the observed frequency of the two modes is the same . in the case of flat galaxies , when they have no stable modes , more complex shapes like circles , cones and holes can be observed . however , if we set the frequency @ xmath113 we get the following expression for the frequency @ xmath73 , where ( [ edo2mna ] ) . in this case , the inner part of the energy release decreases with time and the disk is not stable . these two conditions can be applied to the model in the following way . in this case we set the expansion factor and the components @ xmath74 and @ xmath82 , and we see that in the thermodyna##mic ##h @ xmath76 and @ xmath114 . the system of equations ( [ t ] ) - ( [ t ] ) corresponds to the second order partial differential equation for the pressure @ xmath50 given by @ xmath115 where @ xmath79 is independent of ( @ xmath80 ) , see also [ fmnb ] . note that in fig . ( [ edo2mnb ] ) the pressure @ xmath75 ##0 appears as a parameter . in the previous example , fig . ( [ edo2mnb ] ) is independent of the pressure @ xmath83 , so in order to get that , we must set @ xmath83 far from 0 . the second order equation ( [ edo2mnb ] ) is solved , with two additional equations , one in @ xmath116 and the other in @ xmath117 . in @ xmath87 we set the pressure @ xmath50 to be @ xmath118 of the corresponding pressure @ xmath114 ( [ pz ] ) . in the real part of the equation we set @ xmath##119 because we expect our error to decrease when reaching the end of the curve , and in that case , to be in phase with the velocity profile above . in the [ figmnb1 ] , we compared the amplitude profiles of the axial pressure profiles , the physical angular velocity profile @ xmath120 and the physical angular velocity profile for @ xmath121 and the values of the modes @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . for these purposes , we use in the table the amplitude profile that corresponds to 10 % of the value of @ xmath114 and the angular velocity profile . note that for ( @ xmath91 ) the modes of the axial pressure profiles are above the 10 % value of @ xmath114 , e . g . the modes with @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 . in these cases we can see that the mode with @ xmath122 is more stable and that the mode with @ xmath123 is below the stability profile required for the experiment . these cases are not true in the second case ( @ xmath9##3 ) and exhibit the same behavior . the mode @ xmath123 is also not stable . this can be seen in the lateral pressure response graph , where the value is less than the average value . note that in the above two examples the mode @ xmath122 is also not stable . the lateral pressure response , as shown in figure [ figmnb1 ] , has all the values just below the 50 % value of @ xmath76 , and so is unstable . the profiles @ xmath50 and @ xmath71 do not depend on the parameter @ xmath83 , but the profiles @ xmath124 and @ xmath103 do . we have numerical analysis for the profiles @ xmath124 and @ xmath103 with different values of the parameter @ xmath83 , and we found that when we increase the value of @ xmath83 the profiles are more stable . we have done the same numerical analysis for different values of the parameter @ xmath125 , and we found that the optimal solution for the2 . we see from fig . [ figmnb1 ] that the less stable modes become more stable for the small galaxies . similarly , for the large galaxies the modes of @ xmath126 become less stable . in addition , for less stable modes , more complicated shapes like cones , rods and spiral ##s can be considered . in this case we consider the first order of the system parameters , the angular velocity and the mass density of the system . the system of coordinates ( [ x ] ) - ( [ y ] ) leads to a second order ordinary differential equation for the coordinate @ xmath73 of the system ( [ edo2mna ] ) . the coefficients of the coordinate @ xmath79 are given in fig [ fmnc ] . in this case , the coordinate @ xmath82 only appears as one term . due to the fact that we are only considering motion along the z axis , the coefficients of the second order ordinary differential equation do not depend on the wavenumber @ xmath92 . this second order equation is solved again with the same boundary conditions as in fig . [ perturb1 ] . in fig . [ figmnc ]we calculated the amplitude ##s for the velocity ##s of the fluid resulting in the function @ xmath87 for different values of the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . we found from the analysis that the amplitude ##s results only in the value of @ xmath75 . therefore , the values of the four velocity profile and energy density profiles , while constant , fall well below the four velocity and the 50 % pressure profile , respectively . we did the same analysis for different values of @ xmath109 and we found that the parameters all have the same absolute values . from these results , we can see that the linear linear fluid model is not nonlinear and , for that reason , the equations do not involve any differential equations . in this case we consider the radial component of the four velocity , the radial component of the pressure and the energy density of the fluid . the system of equations ( [ y ] ) - ( [ x ] ) leads to a first order ordinary differential equation for the function @ xmath50 of the form ( [ edo2mnb ] ) . the parameters @ xmath79 are included in the[ fmnd ] . note that , as in sec . [ perturb2 ] , the parameter @ xmath75 ##0 appears as one term . in this case , we are only considering physical quantities and therefore the quantities involved do not depend on the coordinate @ xmath92 . the partial differential equation is solved by the method of sec . [ perturb2 ] . in sec . [ figmnd ] we consider the different values of the atmospheric pressure , and the corresponding axial velocity amplitude , for @ xmath121 and for different values of the parameters @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . we note that the axial velocity amplitude ##s for ( @ xmath91 ) are all of the same order of more or less when compared to the 100 % value . in the second case ( @ xmath93 ) , note that the amplitude of the mode @ xmath95 is constant over a part of the plane . this effect is reflected in the axial velocity amplitude , where the modes @ xmath95 have a similar effect . some of the modes , like the modes with @ xmath95, are unstable because they are all below the four velocity , which is not stable . the modes that correspond to the energy density , are not stable . for more complex systems the parameter @ xmath95 is not stable and can have more complex properties . for different values of the parameter @ xmath83 the modes are all stable . we did the same experiment for different values of the parameter @ xmath125 and we found that the modes all have the same physical properties . in this case we set the radial component of the four velocity , the axial component of the four velocity , the axial pressure and the axial temperature . if we are in fig . [ sec2 ] , we use an additional parameter to determine the number of variables corresponding to the number of variables . in this case , we set @ xmath128 . therefore , the system of equations ( [ t ] ) - ( [ t ] ) corresponds to the second order partial differential equation for the energy density @ xmath129 , and @ xmath130 where ( @ xmath131 ) = values of ( @ xmath132 ) , see also [ fmne ] . the partial differential equation( [ pde2mne ] ) is solved for with four boundary conditions , namely @ xmath133 , @ xmath134 , @ xmath84 and @ xmath135 . they are special cases in which we can use the boundary conditions in order to solve different types of pressure problems . first , we consider only the case when we have a pressure gradient at @ xmath84 and along the @ xmath82 axis , i . e . some kind of a linear flow . we set the value of the radial pressure equal to the 10 % of the axial pressure . we set the value of the four boundary conditions equal to zero because we want the pressure to vanish when reaching the center of the flow . we use the 10 % of the value of the axial pressure instead of the radial pressure because it reaches the maximum value at @ xmath84 . in that case , the boundary conditions vanish ##es at the 10 % value of the radial pressure and the following differential equation is obtained . in fig . [ figmne ] , we use the equation ##s for the pressure , the fluid flow , and the fluid# ##ly , for @ xmath95 and for different values of the pressure @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 . we see from the radial velocity graph that the radial velocity decreases to something approaching zero when we move away from the center of the disk . this pattern is the same for every system type . with the pressure curve , we may see a pattern that is more stable in the lower regions . note that in the lower domain of the curve [ - 5 , 5 ) the radial velocity component is positive and in the upper domain ( 0 , 0 ] the radial velocity component is negative . this means that due to the curve ##ity the disk starts to respond to the pressure @ xmath87 . however , if we return to the radial velocity curve ##s , we see that the upper and lower domains separate from the center of the disk due to the negative radial velocity . so , with these curves , we can see that the disk starts to form a kind of ring around the center of the disk . this ring is higher for small elliptical systems and lower for highly massive systems . in this section we discuss the application of the recently developed gravity relat##ivistic miyamoto - nagai disk [ @ xcite ] by using a simple first order approximation . we can see that the stability analysis above is more accurate than the stability analysis of particle transport in fluid because we have taken into account the relative motion of the particles . however , this analysis can be shown to be inaccurate because the angular velocity - distribution of the particles is used as a reference , and does not affect the background temperature . this is the same kind of solution to the same problem in which the effect of electromagnetic radiation is neglected . the initial stability analyses applied to the strongly interacting miyamoto - nagai disk show that this disk is stable for low values of the wave frequency @ xmath92 and the amplitude @ xmath83 . for higher values of @ xmath92 and @ xmath83 the disk contains not - stable modes that can form more complex structures like rings , holes and holes , and in order to explain them we need a second order stability analysis . in general , not - stable modes occur more for smaller galaxies and less for larger galaxies . m . i . and m . i . t . use fapesp for their support ;e . g . , . is called cnpq . the explicit form of the coefficients ( @ xmath139 ) used in the second order ordinary differential equations ( [ edo2mna ] ) is given by @ xmath140 where @ xmath141 , @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 and @ xmath144 in fig .
