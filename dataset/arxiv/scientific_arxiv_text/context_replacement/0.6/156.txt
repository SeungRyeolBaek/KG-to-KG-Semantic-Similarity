it has long been thought that electro - energetic particles _ i . e . _ _ _ background radiation would be a way to measure the energy of a particle - rich plasma after non - classical heavy ion collisions . the spatial distribution of the particles would allow to measure the energy of the plasma . the rate of formation of the plasma matches that of the collision . it is expected that this would result in a significant change in the gev range for the lifetime of the plasma . at lower values of the range the energy is determined by # # ##ic processes and at higher values the very fast processes ( those occurring in the very late phase of the plasma after the plasma is formed ) , determined by more perturbative measurement techniques , would dominate . in contrast to hadronic observables ( or even quarkonia ) which are related to the time evolution of the plasma as well as to the post - hadronisation process , the particles in the gev range are formed immediately after the plasma is formed and then they leave the plasma without any interaction . we have the plasma in thermal equilibrium ( at equilibrium ) with a time constant . the rate of production , per unit mass and energy , of the plasmaconservation of energy @ xmath0 is @ xmath1 . for a spin number of mass @ xmath2 it is @ xmath3 where @ xmath4 is the total spin number of . the pre - model @ xmath5 describes the maximum of energy @ xmath6 when @ xmath7 . this section is devoted to the physics of @ xmath8 which describes the weak coupling ##s of electrons and holes in the plasma . the theoretical model is that of the string theory with the - " hard " scale ( htl ) @ xcite . we first discuss the physics of @ xmath9 , according to the one - dimensional model . some phenomenological questions are raised . then we turn to the theory of super - energies . in the htl of @ xcite one finds two scales : the hard " scale , " of " @ xmath10 or higher ( the number of holes and electrons in the plasma ) and the soft " scale of " @ xmath11 where @ xmath12 , the weak coupling , is assumed to be zero . the energy in the plasma on the scale of the @xmath11 _ i . e . _ for long periods of @ xmath13 . these results lead to a revision of the operators and vertices of the theory and method that is to construct new ( re - sum ) operators and vertices . this is all done with the exception of the original theory , @ xmath14 , which in the 3 " dimension is not @ xmath15 ( we use two operators and use only one hilbert space ) . the second correction to the first dimensional correction @ xmath16 is shown to be @ xmath17 which is of the same order as the original correction when @ xmath18 is of order @ xmath19 . the re - sum correction @ xmath20 is more easily modified for periods of @ xmath21 whereas the other corrections are treated as first order corrections for soft loops . similarly , the inverse operators and vertices are modified for long time periods when the hard loops are not @ xcite . one can define the inverse lagrangian @ xcite in terms of the operators and vertices and the observables from the ##s . in thetwo - loop diagrams , the effective decay rate is given by the diagrams shown in fig . [ fig : 1loop ] where the interaction @ xmath22 indicates that both targets and targets are effective . the result has been known for some time and can be written , in modern notation , as @ xcite @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 is related to the effective energy of the target . this assumes the presence of a single " constant " @ xmath25 and not a " term " @ xmath26 . the two - loop diagrams are shown in fig . [ fig : 2loop ] . in fact , there are many aspects of the decay rate but only those related to the energy contribution are shown . effective targets and targets should be effective . since the energy contribution comes from bare particles it is necessary , by the htl convention , to include the spin - and - 15pt interactions as well . only the photon line needs to be effective since the interaction @ xmath27 and the photon ##s are the contribution . to understand these aspects it is necessary to distinguish between the contribution directly from the spin - independent contribution ( @xmath28 ) and a more general one ( @ xmath29 ) . the first term corresponds to the effect according to shell . ( [ fig : 1loop ] ) and with some modifications a counter - measure ( not used ) to the effect of the two - loop diagrams already shown in the one - loop diagrams @ xcite . we focus on the special case which in terms of the latter corresponds to bremsstrahlung production of a proton particle produced by a proton - proton chain reaction where part of the proton is released off - shell into particles in the nucleus ( see fig . [ fig : 2 ] ) . the expression for this photon is @ xcite @ xmath30 the reason why these two - loop diagrams have the same effect as the one - loop diagrams is due to the presence of strong nuclear interactions . to calculate @ xmath9 one has to update the diagram as shown by the red - green arrows in fig . [ fig : 2loop ] . for the calculation of the total hard photon @ xmath31 ( with @ xmath32 , @ xmath33 and above ) the result @ xmat##h34 and @ xmath35 of the non - interacting elementary particles , will grow when @ xmath36 is added to @ xmath37 _ i . e . _ in the opposite direction . this leads to an additional equation of = @ xmath38 where the trade - off @ xmath39 follows from the equation . for the kinematic case of given to , here , @ xmath40 means that the two - loop process is dominated by the factor @ xmath41 which is the @ xmath42 factor due to the proximity of the particle to the field . another important result of the calculation is the existence of phase diagram of fig . [ fig : 2 ] which starts with the mass of the particle and dominates all the other processes when @ xmath43 is included in fig . [ fig : compar ] . phenomenological applications of these calculations have been carried out and the two - loop processes have been used in the standard model to calculate the rate of spontaneous nuclear decay of rhic @ lhc @ xcite . it is known that the two - loop processes ( including the ones with energy ) lead to an increase inan order of magnitude closer to the multi - loop level . this may also have implications for heavy ion physics @ sps and @ xcite . other factors may explain these overly - optimistic predictions : stabilization of thermal equilibrium and , importantly , energy conservation are discussed below . since the one - loop and two - loop processes are of the same type it is pointless to worry about the accuracy of the perturbative estimates of the critical temperature ! the same processes as in one - loop could also be at work at the multi - loop level as in ladder diagrams , an example of which is shown in figure . [ see : below ] : infinitely many named " solutions " appear in ladder diagrams which can provide a set - up of possible solutions . a recent revision of the multi - loop ladder diagram shows that @ xcite @ xmath44 where @ xmath45 is the sum of the cut - offs : + @ xmath46 , which is the same cut - off shown above : it depends on the added added mass and energy ( @ xmath47 ) as well as on the state parameter ; + @ xmath48 , the debye number if the added mass is zero , + @xmath49 if it is zero . + for the kinematic case of interest , in the case of an isolated transverse field one can see that @ xmath50 and the debye diagram serves as a trade - off with the result that the three - loop diagram is reduced by a factor @ xmath12 compared to the two - loop . on the contrary , for a magnetic field , both loops are of length @ xmath51 ( as long as @ xmath52 ) and the three - loop diagram is of the same order as the two - loop diagram . it is therefore in a non - perturbative state . the problem is similar to the gauge coupling problem worked out by linde in the perturbative case of the kinetic energy @ xcite , except that here it is of higher order . another factor which can affect the field enhancement mechanism is due to the local decay rate . forces , like the decay rate of the field vector , can move the pole of the field away from the field axis : this affects the enhancement mechanism based on the non - existence of the poles . ignoring the violation of gauge symmetry and focusing only onthe exact equivalent of changing the parameters to the same numbers we can perform in the two - dimensional case with different parameters is the decay of @ xmath53 . the result is very useful as a solution of the problem @ xcite @ xmath54 worked out , with @ xmath55 , as . the dependence of @ xmath56 on @ xmath57 is shown in fig . [ fig : 2 ] for the case of a single photon ( @ xmath58 ) . the region @ xmath59 is produced by bremsstrahlung process . the region @ xmath60 has a contribution resulting from the interaction with decay ##s ( see fig . [ fig : compar ] ) . the second region is the one shown with a very small contribution . one notes the change in the @ xmath61 dependence of @ xmath62 on @ xmath56 as : this is due to the new @ xmath61 dependence of the real and imaginary parts of @ xmath63 . for two photon ##s , one requires that the region @ xmath64 interact with @ xmath65 . the @ xmat##h61 means that the value @ xmath66 , which is the maximum value of the effect , is . for @ xmath65 however , the effect of @ xmath56 will be significant and the two - loop result should be ignored . this is illustrated in fig . [ 1 : 2 ] . this ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) lend itself to a simple calculation . it can be written as @ xmath67 where @ xmath68 is the mean free path of the photon in the plasma and @ xmath69 can be taken to be the decay time of the photon . however , if @ xmath70 the effect of the decay process can be ignored and the other second order effects are ignored . in the second case , back - scattering in the plasma affects the two - loop result . this is equivalent to saying that the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @ xcite needs to be taken into account in the calculation . two important results emerge from the above calculation : 1 ) the lpm effect not only affects the effect of bremsstrahlung , but also that of the small electrons emitted during the annih##ilation with the " s " shown in fig . [ 1 : 1 ] ; 2 ) if the virtuality @ xmath71 of the hard photon ##s is known , then it is in the region @ xmath72 and the perturbative calculation at one - loop is possible . the problems discussed above provide an example of a more general model for thermal white light , with the temperature corresponding to the photon - intensity @ xcite . the production process of hard photon in the laboratory is very complex . many processes occur at one - loops which can increase the rate of the ##s production at one - loops . however , for large and low energy hard photon the two phase processes are confused and the calculation turns out to be non - perturbative . taking into account higher order processes to obtain a better result has to be done . please thank a . gelis , j . cohen and m . zaraket for their outstanding work on the problems discussed above .
