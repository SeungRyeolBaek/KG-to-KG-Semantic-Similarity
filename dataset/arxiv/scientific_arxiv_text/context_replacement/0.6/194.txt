the first massive particle with properties @ xmath10 @ xmath11 gev ( atlas ) @ xcite , @ xmath12 gev ( atlas ) @ xcite , both discovered in the lhc , has properties consistent with those of the long - period higgs particles of the standard model ( sm ) @ xcite . this also means that the classical limit of the higgs co - expansion is well beyond the quantum mechanical limit @ xmath13 gev ( see , e . g . ) . however , unlike the sm , the sm is unstable , being stable with a mass exceeding that of the sm by several orders of magnitude @ xcite . without the introduction of these additional massive particles , the sm is still an absolutely self - consistent , well - understood , quantum field , all the way up to the planck scale ( see sm . @ xcite for more detailed details ) . however , it is clear that the sm is unstable . in a number of fine - tuning problems ( such as the weak and weak cp theories ) , the sm is in conflict with the existence of non - zero # ##s , the presence of matter and energy in the universe , and the existence of anti - matter##yonic dark matter . the only known model that can account adequately for particle masses and properties , baryogenesis , and dark matter , is the theoretical physics standard model ( @ xmath14msm ) @ xcite . it assumes the existence of very large neutral particles ( hnl ) and provides a basis for the expected experimental sensitivity @ xcite . the basis for these hnls is the focus of the theoretical study . in addition to hnls , the experiment would be subjected to several other laws of physics experiments that involve weakly interacting neutral particles with a strong interaction with the cloud chamber , see e . g . , . smaller times and better results would be expected compared to the experiments performed earlier in the same experiment @ xcite . in the rest of this article the theoretical basis for hnl ##s is presented in section [ sec : theo ] and the results from the theoretical studies are also discussed in section [ sec : exp _ er ] . the actual experiment set - up is presented in section [ sec : exp ] and in section [ sec : bg ] the observed effects are discussed , and the experimental sensitivity is presented in section [ sec : er ] . the theory ofsee next section [ ref : conc ] . in type - i scattering models ( for further details see ref . @ xcite ) the filling of the central elastic sector with three left - handed ( sm ) particles , @ xmath15 , where @ xmath16 , makes the leptonic sector identical to the sm sector ( see ref . [ ferm ] ) . because of their mass , these three particles can predict the flavour behavior of the background radiation . three different units of hnl ##s , @ xmath17 , are commonly used : msm all ##ons have both left - and right - handed components and masses below the planck scale . , title = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 48 . 0 % ] msm [ ##ons have both left - and right - handed components and masses below the planck scale . , title = " fig : " , scaledwidth = 48 . 0 % ] * models with hnls with @ xmath18gev @ xcite are predicted by grand unified theory . in these models the observed flavour behavior of the background results from cp - violationmass of the hnls , which produces a large mass @ xcite . this mass is then transformed into a small mass at sphalerons @ xcite . the large mass of the hnls results in a fine - tuning problem for the higgs mechanism . a possible solution is provided by high energy physics but at present this is not supported by experimental evidence . models with very large elementary particles are unable to account for dark matter and can only be directly confirmed by experiments ; * models with @ xmath19 gev ( for further details see ref . @ xcite ) are provided by a possible solution to the same problem at the electroweak scale ( see e . g . ) . the mass distribution of the particles can be explained via both leptogenesis and sphalerons @ xcite . as such , there is no need for dark matter models . a lot of the above information can be obtained by the integration of the cm and ref . @ xcite ; * models with masses of the hnls at the planck level and energies of the order of the mass of the atomic nuclei and electrons , are equivalent to .for large masses and energies and they can give rise to the mass variability of the universe and can explain dark matter @ xcite ( for further description see ) . the possibility of gev - scale hnls was first proposed in 2002 . @ xcite . due to its very low mass , the dark matter of the @ xmath20kev hnl , does not contribute to the generation of sterile particles ##s observed only by the planck experiment @ xcite ; * experiments with @ xmath21 and @ xcite were confirmed by the @ xmath22 @ xmath23 and observed by long - range non - planck experiments @ xcite , the planck experiments @ xcite and the experiment ##ium experiments @ xcite . these neutral particles are also referred to as sterile particles . some of these neutral particles can explain neither the mass variability of the universe nor dark matter . the gev - scale hnls of u ( n ) are required to solve the fundamental problems of the universe and the search for sterile particles is the basis of the sm proposal . the sm proposalrenormalisable lagrangian of three active particles and three sm ( with respect to the same gauge group ) particles , @ xmath15 , and @ xmath24 where @ xmath25 , @ xmath26 are the two gauge groups , @ xmath27 is the term for the charge carriers , @ xmath28 , where @ xmath29 is the sm higgs field , and @ xmath30 are the three coupling terms . the fourth term is the weak coupling constant , which is defined when the @ xmath15 has no gauge group . when the sm higgs field has a non - zero vacuum expectation value , @ xmath31gev , the last term in eqn . results from mixing of the hnls and the sm particles in the standard model , the three sm - particle ##s interacting with each other , which is used to describe the interactions . the model described in eqn . has seven additional parameters compared to the original ( three cp - violating parameters , three spin parameters , three spin parameters , and two photon ##s ) . one ofthese effects ( due to two mixing angles of the active particles and their mass differences ) have been measured in high - energy experiments ##s @ xcite . the large number of cp - violating particles suggests the possibility of much stronger cp violation than that found in the standard model . in addition , the expanding nature of the universe can be constrained by a wide range of constraints @ xcite . in particular , hnls with the mass differences and mixing angles imposed by these constraints can have the largest effective mass in the universe ( bau ) . the most famous example of this model is the @ xmath14msm . in this model , the light ##est particle , @ xmath32 , has a very weak interaction with the active particles , playing a role in anti - matter energy transfer . the light from @ xmath32 is not sufficiently massive to be a dark matter candidate . this state could be determined by looking for a narrow band in the x - ray spectrum resulting from radiative decay @ xmath33 ( for a description see ) . the large number of particles that result from requiring that @ xmath32 be a dark matter .they satisfy the additional requirement that @ xmath34 is nearly identical in nature . this allows cp ##t to be raised to the level necessary to determine the mass distribution in the universe . the order of magnitude of the interaction term in eqn . can be determined by considering the absolute value of the first coupling term , @ xmath35 . the order of the active particle interaction is given by the following terms , @ xmath36 for the hnl , @ xmath37gev , and @ xmath38ev , the mass of @ xmath39 is in the order of @ xmath40kev , and the second terms are of the order of @ xmath41 . dividing the coupling term between @ xmath15 and the masses of the @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 , the second coupling term , @ xmath44 gives the relative strength of interactions between the @ xmath15 and the active particles . taking a smaller value , @ xmath45 , or larger @ xmath46 gives the interactions ( interactions ) of the active particles and the active .. in the final stages , the @ xmath46 would result in the @ xmath34 system coming into existence at the electroweak scale and would completely generate the observed structure of the universe . a small fraction of the free particles and the remaining energy would allow hnls to generate the observed mass hierarchy of the universe and would help explain why these phenomena have not yet been observed in nature . , from big bang physics ( black holes : ` ` bbn ' ' ) , from the expanding nature of the universe ( ` ` bau ' ' ) and from the decay process ( the spectral lines : ` ` bau n ' ' and ` ` ba n ' ' refer to the normal mass - hierarchy of the universe and ` ` bau i ' ' and ` ` ba i ' ' refer to an extended mass - hierarchy ) . the corresponding part of the phase space is shown in red for the mass hierarchy only . the results from the experimental data are given in ref . [ exp ] . , 1 from [ . @ xcite . , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] . the @ xmath14##msm the hnl - sm interaction gives rise to hnl ( @ xmath34 ) particles and the decay of sm particles . the weak mixing gives rise to the decay of the hnls to sm particles . the resulting decay energies are high and the @ xmath34 particles are much longer - lived ( by a factor @ xmath47 ) than the corresponding sm particles of similar mass ( see fig . [ taun ] ) . for hnl particles above the threshold threshold , the most common decay modes are shown in fig . [ production - and - decay ] ( left ) . the potential for entry into the system for both production and decay results in high energies which occur on the lower level of the hnl - sm interaction , @ xmath48 . the two - and three - body decay modes of @ xmath34 are shown in fig .

[ taun ] . ] [exp ] is the only region in the @ xmath67 region , satisfying the constraints from particle physics experiments . for the regions in fig . [ exp ] below the limit marked ` ` ba ' ' , the interaction of the hnl with dark matter is too weak to produce the expected pattern of observed nuclear reactions . these constraints result in further constraints . if the hnls are able to provide a mechanism for baryogenesis , their interaction with matter should be too weak such that they fall below the upper limit marked ` ` bau ' ' . the hnl with the region to the right of the ` ` bbn ' ' line would be too weak in the early stages to result in the production of liquid helium - 4 in big bang experiments @ xcite . the regions observed from the soho @ xcite , cern ps191 @ xcite and nutev @ xcite experiments are not shown . those from bebc @ xcite and ccfr @ xcite are not shown in fig .

[ pthnl ] . in order to ensure the high stability for a long time path of the detector , the light source should always be located as close as possible to the target . the emission of the charm particles is caused by the spontaneous decay of nuclei , electrons and long - lived atomic nuclei . the spontaneous decay of these particles would result in a large flux of nuclei and electrons . to detect these particles , a combination of a proton and a neutron detector of a 1 mm diameter , each made of as thin a material as possible , is used . to measure the total occ##upancy and background caused by the residual electron flux , a electron detector is required instead of the proton detector . the detector set - up must also meet the technical requirements of placing the detector as close as possible to the source and of having a sufficiently large radiation window outside of the outer shell of the detector to detect anti - particle interactions . the detector must be able to detect the first two particles from @ xmath71 which , can be used to detect @ xmath34 . ] ] ] , and determine the @ xmath72 particle ##s and the expected decay rate with sufficient accuracy to detect them . to be sensitive to the particles @ xmath73 , @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 in addition to the @ xmath76 particles , a proton detector , an electron detector and a proton detector are required . the expected proton flux and the residual electron flux from the detector are important factors in the design of the detector . interactions of particles in the detector system can cause unexpected effects , in particular via anti - particle interactions of anti - matter . thisand reduce the critical volume to a point where the decay ##s are suppressed ( see figure [ 1 : bg ] ) . interaction of energy and matter with the particles in the critical volume , can produce long - lived @ xmath77 particles , such as alpha particles , which can remain in the same critical volume and undergo exponential decay . to observe decay - induced @ xmath77 ##7 events from the other side of the proton beam , the energy flux from the proton beam must be reduced at the detector . this is achieved through the use of shielding and background shielding material with the highest possible decay energy . in addition , the energy flux must be sufficiently large to reduce decay - induced @ xmath77 events to a flux that is equal to but lower than the flux from above . protection against cosmic rays is also required and the detector could also be placed in an enclosed space . a description of the experimental detector geometry and detector design is given below . for the hnl experiments with @ xmath78 gev . , n = " 1 : " , scaledwidth= 49 . 0 % ] , which hnl operates with @ xmath78 gev . , [ = " : : " , scaledwidth = 49 . 0 % ] the sps beam length , the efficiency and the quality of the pulse series suggest a very large production run for the current experiment . the recently completed cern nice to gran sasso ( cngs ) experiment makes use of @ xmath79gev pulses from the sps for a full range with 50 % of decay , 50 % of decay , and 50 % of the sps supercycle . this gives a range of @ xmath80 pulses on average per pulse . the experiment described above has the same length of operating life as cngs and the same sps range . in addition , the experimental use of the energy range requires no modifications to the sps , retains the efficiency of the original beam , and is consistent with the performance of both the lhc and the wide area laser beam array as they are being developed . the experimental data could come as a by - product of a recent sps or from a recent change ##over of @ @ xmath81 pulses per pulse to @ xmath82 proton##s per sample . the design of the current experiment aims at taking advantage of such an assumption but the experiment does not rely on it . from the technical description given above , the two options include the use of a very slow extraction to increase the sample size per acquisition time , and to adopt a fast extraction design based on suitable conditions . at the same time , the extraction design should not depend on the sps acquisition time as compared to cngs , and should reduce the dependence on the energy density of the extraction chamber and the risk of damage to the sample surface . several options exist , all of which would be useful from the point of view of the experiment , but the final solution requires further research : * fast extraction with a spill cycle of @ xmath83s . this would involve an @ xmath84s sps spill cycle , and therefore a reduction of the number of particles on sample by 50 % ; * a non - coherent fast extraction of o ( 1ms ) ; * fast extraction similar to that of cngs of o ( @ xmath85s ) . the last two options involve extraction with the sps being turned off and the solvent debunched . this is a non - coherent extraction that isbut with a long time readout , as described in the [ ssec : 1 ] . the first two detection methods result in very high detection sensitivity . with detection of @ xmath86s , the large number of @ xmath49 mesons decay without interaction with the target , regardless of the beam energy . however , the number of interacting particles and electrons , which give rise to a large energy output from decays in vacuum , can be greatly reduced by the use of a good ##r material with a short reaction time . for example , the use of diamond , rather than glass , reduces the number of interacting pions and electrons by an order of magnitude . a 10 mm diameter glass tube would work . however , the beam energy deposited must then be reduced in order to reduce the thermal expansion induced by the beam and to allow for energy transfer . it may be possible to extract the excess beam energy by mechanical means . since the particles produced by charm decay , which can interact with hnls , have in this case a very large angular momentum ( see ref . [ pthnl ] ) , there is no need to create a large beam spot . the beam spot .can also be determined independently by the material requirements and constraints . for the same reason , the technique does not impose any constraints on the optical properties of the primary beam . the stabilization of the beam after deposition described above can also be achieved by allowing the total energy of the beam to increase along the straight section of the primary beam line , and then using a series of orthogonally aligned x ##s to generate a lissajous beam on the target , parallel to the lhc beam line . recent work indicates that it should be possible to achieve a beam sweep size of 1 @ xmath87 ##w on the target and a beam width of 10 centimeters , with the only limitation being a beam size greater than the transverse divergence of the target hnls . beam generation in the beam line parallel to the target can be slowed and reduced to increase the total beam energy . the use of a secondary beam would compromise the beam design . to avoid damage to the target caused by mechanical forces along the beam line , the secondary generation would need to be combined with the beam generation in the dedicated beam line . the primary beam would be required to have a beam size of @ xmath88kw , compared to @ .##math89 ##2 per @ xmath90s = @ xmath79gev . further thermo - mechanical calculations must be performed in order to find a suitable target . to trap the incoming beta particles and electrons as they escape , a neutron shield will completely surround the target . besides surrounding the target , the target will also trap nuclei and electrons at small angles which will also trap particles that exceed the detection limit due to small angle separation . the target will also absorb the maximum amount of the neutron flux , as well as absorbing the remaining non - neutral particles ( @ xmath91 of the total proton flux ) and the background radiation contained in the target . the physical properties of the target are determined by the shielding effects of the neutron ##s ( see the [ ssec : mushield ] section ) . as part of the design , a secondary shielding wall will cut - off the neutron shielding area from the main neutron shield area . the neutron flux of the neutron shield is calculated from a combination of @ xmath92 @ xmath93 ##s , with beams with a total decay energy of 400gev and asee proton flux . the prompt component of the proton flux originates from the spontaneous fission of the proton , namely @ xmath94 , @ xmath95 , @ xmath96 , @ xmath97 . the non - prompt component originates mainly from the reactions and decay of elementary particles and electrons . for the best results , only the decay of elementary particles and electrons are considered as non - prompt components . secondary , tertiary , and higher order particle and electron decay should produce a total proton flux that is more strongly coupled than the low - order primary particle and electron decay that impose the constraints on the electron interaction length . the effective effective radius of the electron beam can be calculated based on a computer simulation to ensure that the sources from higher order decay , which will have different interaction lengths , are not present . the dense shield and the light absorber described above will be used to trap the electrons . thus , a sample @ xmath98 of the hadrons in the target will decay into electrons without detection , where @ xmath99 is the interaction length of electrons in the dense shield ; @ .##math100 is the decay energy of the proton and @ xmath101 , @ xmath102 and @ xmath45 are the constant mass , lab momentum and critical mass ; and @ xmath103 is the critical mass for the decay of the proton to zero ( 70 % for @ xmath104 and 30 % for @ xmath105 , if decay - related decay products are used ) . a cross - correlation with the proton flux used in the ` ` ` beta decay ' ' experiment @ xcite shows that the above formula for calculating the ` ` first - generation ' ' proton flux is the average rate of decay . the total proton flux is calculated as a function of the lab momentum in fig . [ . : muonfluxes ] . the flux from these experiments represent a critical fraction of the total proton flux . @ xmath93 was used with particles with a proton flux of 10 gev and a single decay proton ( see figure for details ) . the proton flux of first - generation particles with the constant mass is [ . , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] . [ fig: muonfluxes ] note that if a device were put in place to stop particles above 350gev , the proton beam would be reduced by about two orders of magnitude to 1 ( 5 ) m per @ xmath92 proton on target . however , the neutron - mediated @ xmath77 decay rate from collisions would still be higher than that of the one that is shown in figure [ fig : bg ] . instead , the device will produce a proton beam that effectively stops particles with energies of up to 400gev , which requires a minimum of 40 m of oxygen ( or 10 m of hydrogen ) @ xcite . . . , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] the final configuration of the beam line and beam will be based on an analysis of the beam line configuration , the beam energy , the proton beam and the resulting beam line , and the number of particles on target . the final beam line configuration as shown above is shown in fig . [ fig : 1 - 2 ] . the final beam line configuration consists of a proton beam focused on an @ xmath106 proton on target , followed by a neutron beamof @ xmath107 m beam , a vacuum system to reduce noise and dust , and an @ xmath108 m beam proton and lithium ion detector constructed in concrete and steel . the detector uses a new transfer line from the existing transmission line , which will be very similar to the one currently used for the cngs experiment . the new section of the line , consisting almost entirely of the structure to allow the beam energy beam to be increased , will then carry the beam energy beam to the underground facility that houses the detector and the new detector . the nature of the experiment should be such that it makes use of existing facilities . in particular , the detector will need to be equipped with the ability to collect soil and rock samples , to comply with environmental protection regulations . the detector should also be located at the cern site . the construction and operation of the transfer line and the detector should be such that the damage done to existing facilities is minimal . depending on these requirements and conditions , the north pole could be a suitable location with a very short transmission line of a few hundred metres , cut - off from tt20 , with a new line running parallel to the tdc2 ground station . the current line couldwill be designed to allow the electron beam detector to point to the target bunker at sufficient elevation and distance from the tcc2 target area to facilitate the use of activated carbon . soil tests will be conducted to determine the target location . a 10 m surface area before the target bunker would provide the location of the blast site , and an area of sufficiently high elevation directly behind the bunker mess ##e would provide a suitable location for the location of the other detector elements . the location of the current target bunker close to the tcc2 target area means that it will be able to benefit from the water needs that are being met for the current target area in terms of clean water and wastewater treatment . the detector consists of a large central detector operated by a spectrometer . for a given detector element , the detector resolution should be high . in the figure , the 1 m resolution of the lhcb detector @ xcite is shown on a length scale . the [ length ] is a measure of the resolution of the detector for both a single detector element and for two similarly sized detector elements . for a given hnl length and detector diameter , the ratio of hnls present in the detector with the decay products introduced into the detectorsaturates as a function of the size of the detector . the combination of two detector elements increases the detector sensitivity by 50 % compared to a single detector . thus , the combined detector will have two nearly identical detector elements as shown in fig . [ detector ] . a comparison of a single detector element is also shown in fig . [ detector3d ] . to reduce to a certain degree the damage caused by interaction of particles with the surrounding gas in the decay chamber , a sensitivity of less than @ xmath109 mbar will be required ( see fig [ detector : bg ] ) . each detector element also consists of 10 @ xmath11050 m long cylindrical detector tube of 1 m diameter . the 10 @ xmath111 m is the detector element and the remaining 1 m is used for the magnetic detector . the combined proton and muon detector has a diameter of 1 m . the magnetic detector has a 1 m high permanent magnet , two detector elements upstream of the magnet , and two tracking layers downstream of the magnet ( see fig . [ detector ] ) . for the desired level of sensitivity , the decay chamber size and shape are adjusted to achieve a similar resolution to themass resolution ##s ( see ref . [ magfield ] ) . for the ##berries with @ xmath110120 @ xmath112 m resolution and with 0 . 5 % @ xmath113 , like those currently being used for the na62 and @ xcite , recent studies show that 0 . 5 m is separated between the tubes , giving @ xmath114 m resolution for the mass resolution . an optical detector is placed in the detector chamber for @ xmath115 m and mass resolution . the detector chamber is a part of the vacuum shield for the electron detector , which consists of an outer chamber surrounded by a tracking station . an additional tracking station at the end of the detection process can be used to track the particles in the detector chamber . these stations can also detect the decay ##s . for each particle @ xmath78gev , 100 % of the @ xmath72 m ##s appear to decay with the @ xmath116gev . the resolution and the mass resolution varies with the magnetic field of the detector . a 0 . 5tm mass resolution results in a mass resolution of @ xmath117##mev for @ xmath116gev track ( see ref . [ kl ] ) . for a 1gev hnl this provides a contrast between the decay signal and the high mass tail of the original @ xmath118 track . the analysis of the magnetic field will need to take into account the reflection of the high mass tail from different angles which will affect the high mass tail . decay starts with the data in the left and right panels and the energy envelope of the decay ##s in the left panel . the first figure shown is for the first decay and is used for the comparison of the two decay products . [ hnl with a 1gev is approx . , scaledwidth = 1 . 5 % ] a feasibility study of a new magnet , similar to the lhcb magnet @ xcite , with a size aperture of @ 16m @ xmath119 and a mass aperture of @ xmath106tm , has been conducted . the [ k - scketch ] is a model of the magnet which meets the requirements of the proposed magnet @ xcite . with a radius with a radius of @ xmath120m @ xmath121, and two x - 1 . 2 magnet , the latter two with a peak power of @ xmath122 ##tm , and of @ xmath123tm with a period of @ xmath124 t . for comparison , the lhcb experiment described above uses @ xmath125 t ##m for its core , and uses 10 times the energy . the proposed experiment will use two @ xmath11050 m long , 10 m wide vacuum tubes one of which will be identical to that used in the na62 tube @ xcite . the @ xmath109 mbar pressure used to capture gas ##s ( see figure [ 1 : bg ] ) , is several orders of magnitude more high than the pressure used in the na62 vacuum tube ( @ xmath126 mbar ) and should therefore not be a significant challenge . the receiving electronics of the mass detectors will provide high spatial resolution and minimize the noise from electron capture . the na62 vacuum vacuum tubes @ xcite , which are made from synthetic organic terephthalate ( pet ) , are used to achieve both of these objectives . # ##ification of these tubes has beenconfidence in long term stability and the mass determination method are still being tested . the detection of @ xmath115 particles and the detection of them would be necessary to detect particles such as @ xmath127 and @ xmath128 . an inexpensive instrument with a high energy resolution would also greatly increase the scientific value of the proposed experiment . the lhcb shashlik instrument has achieved the energy resolution of @ xmath129 , which is comparable to the energy resolution of the chandra magnetic resonance in the 10 to 20gev energy range . the shashlik instrument also provides an economical tracker with high detail , as well as a resolution greater than a few hours , which would be sufficient to maintain the calorimeter and the data . the sps provides a quasi - random count of particles on average throughout its operation time . a quasi - random memory system such as that developed for the lhcb and @ xcite would exist for the proposed experiment . this memory system will store data only in 25ns time - slices . the data will be sent directly to read - out machines which in turn will send the data to the data - .to complete the event analysis . events with matching times will be used to produce two - dimensional data , and events with matching times will be used for further analysis . this part of the process will be done on - site in the event center , to reduce the data storage requirements to a certain extent . it is expected that values of @ xmath11010tb / s would be sufficient . the proton shield described above is designed to trap particles with energies of up to 400gev , thereby reducing proton - proton interactions to a microscopic level . the rate of high - energy proton ##s ( cu ) decay at the outer end of the proton shield is determined by calculations from a model of charm @ xcite , which involves 400gev particles interacting with a cu target . to relate this rate to the target geometry , the energy and momentum components of the interaction are calculated using charm @ xcite . this results in an average decay rate for the average decay period of the proton ##s of @ xmath130 per @ xmath131 , on average if a cu target is used . in the cross - section geant @ xcite .used to simulate the # ##s produced by a 400gev proton decay on a cu target . this yields a cc rate 10 times higher than the rate used on the genie model . replacing the cu target with a w target reduces the cc rate to @ xmath132 % . the data from the geant model of the w target is sent to the @ xcite to calculate the proton and non - neutral ( nc ) proton interactions in the gas phase . this yields a cc ( % ) rate of @ xmath133 per unit mass per @ xmath131 proton on target . then , this rate is used to evaluate the background . the pressure in the decay volume could be the source of background . in a decay volume filled with water at high pressure , the cc rate translates into @ xmath134 nc interactions per @ xmath131 proton on target . the pressure in the decay volume of 0 . 01 mbar reduces this pressure to a critical value . the source of background is the size of the nc interactions that occur in the proton ##s , outside of the decay volume . the combination of geant and genie is used to calculatethat means @ xmath114 % of the possible cases of @ xmath135 and @ xmath136 will be observed . this prediction is consistent with predictions from the @ xcite . for the first 35 m of the decay volume two - sided vertices are derived from @ xmath135 and @ xmath137 decay . for the last 35 m of the decay volume @ xmath138 % of two - sided vertices come from @ xmath139 decay . choosing one of the two decay products to be interpreted as a decay , produces @ xmath140 two - sided decay and @ xmath131 decay on average . due to their different sizes , the average size of @ xmath139 decay products is much smaller than that of hnl decay products . [ [ source : kl - 1 - 1 ] calculate the total mass of these products , with their probability of first approach ( 1 ) when sent back to the source ##d . with a 1gev invariant value for the product . , p = " 1 : " , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] with a 1gev .[ for the source . , source = " source : " , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] . for @ xmath141 m reduce this background to a couple of atoms for @ xmath131 m per second , so the ip of all the sources is about 50 % . the number of targets can then be used to determine the background effects in particle ##s from the surrounding environment , from the vacuum tube or the detector , and from cosmic rays . signals that come from particle ##s could be detected by studying the background interactions induced by the cosmic rays , especially the c - type ##r . this technique has not been used yet in the proposed experiment and could be used to reduce the background to a small amount . more detailed background measurements can be performed to determine the ip of the ground source at the top of the detector stack . if shown to be accurate , the first two sites of both the proton shield and the neutron shield could be used in order to determine the strength of these interactions . the success of the proposed experiment depends on the exact method used to measure the background , and the type of interactions between the particle ##s and the hnl##s . the region of @ xmath142 that can be detected by the charm experiment is then defined by assuming that the term @ xmath143 is used and ignoring the reaction of @ xmath144 . the difference between @ xmath142 and @ xmath68 is discussed in ref . @ xcite . as discussed in ref [ 1 : exp _ 1 ] , the two upper limits for @ xmath142 come from the charm experiment @ xcite and are : the @ xmath41 limit for a mass of 0 . 5gev and the maximum at @ xmath145 for a mass of 1gev . the maximum detection limit for @ xmath146 is between @ xmath41 and @ xmath147 . the maximum number of proton peaks for the charm experiment is given by @ xmath148 where @ xmath149 is the maximum number of peaks per proton , @ xmath150 is the ratio of the @ xmath151 peak cross - section with mass to the total cross - section ( the ratio that accounts for the fact that it is not in solution ) , @ xmath152then the total mass and @ xmath153 is the product of the trigger and decay energy levels of the hnls . the quantity @ xmath152 can be calculated as the product of the probability that the hnls are in the same system and the trigger and decay energy . the rate of decay is constant with all probability for all values of @ xmath142 and the odds are assumed to be 100 % . the dependence on the hnl mass produces an @ xmath142 factor for @ xmath152 . since the quantities @ xmath153 and @ xmath152 also depend on the constant @ xmath142 , this results in an estimated @ xmath154 factor . for @ xmath155 , an hnl mass of 1gev , @ xmath156 , @ xmath157s and @ xmath158 , @ xmath159 , and @ xmath160 , would be sufficient , several orders of magnitude less than the mass that would be observed in the above system . for a system in the cosmologically closed system with @ xmath##161 , @ xmath162s and @ xmath163gev , decay + decay @ xmath164 , would be observed in the same channel . the new theory allows the study of decay channels with a single particle in the final state such as @ xmath75 , where the @ xmath165 , is the signal strength to be measured . channels with two , such as @ xmath166 , could also be observed , with a significant increase in the signal and the decay @ xmath167 to be measured . the decay channels with an initial ##e in the final state , e . g . @ xmath168 , are very difficult to study , since the initial mass would have a different sign and could be calculated from the mass with the same background energy . both the energy level and the total decay energy would be determined by the experiment itself . the energy flux from n - electron decay is very difficult to measure directly . a combination of the @ xmath169 measurements of energy flux from the experiment combined with the 400gev pcu measurements @ xcite and a statistical analysis would yield a large. in addition , for an hnl flux of 2gev the proposed experiment has the potential for the cosmologically stable region with @ xmath146 , @ xmath41 and stable region with @ xmath170 . the mass determination of the type ii could be conducted using both the fermilab and kek detector beams . the beams used were the 800gev and 120gev fnal beams with @ xmath171 proton on target and @ xmath172 proton on target , respectively ; and the kek 30gev beam with @ xmath173 proton on target . in fnal , the 800gev beam would have a similar hnl flux to that of the proposed sps experiment , i . e . the increased proton flux would be partially offset by the increase in the beam cross - section at high energies @ xcite . however , a much larger beam size would be required due to the higher beam energies , which would be much more expensive , leading to a significant lack of data . the fnal 120gev beam would have a factor 1 lower event yield than in the proposed sps experiment , while the kek beam would have a factor 0 . 5 event yield, the latter prediction has a significant uncertainty due to the limited resolution of the beam cross - section at high energies . the energy of the proton beam line in the cern lhc is estimated at a yield of 1000fb @ xmath174 and an energy of 14tev , which is expected after three to four years of planning for the high energy experiment . the hnl beam site is expected to be about 1 m ##rad from the collision site and 50mrad off - axis , in order to match the lhc beam line . the resulting hnl energy difference would be a factor of 10 greater than in the original sps experiment . although most of the hnls are assumed to be on the gev - scale , it is possible that they are heavier than @ xmath49 ##5 . if the hnls are heavier than @ xmath1105gev , they could be produced by large scale decay . the most massive hnl ##s associated with @ xmath175 decay would be the semileptonic @ xmath176 , and the total decay energy would therefore be reduced to less than @ xmath177gev . the hcross - correlation for the distribution of beauty particles with respect to beta decay means that the limits that could be reached from a single experiment at the lhc would be about two orders of magnitude lower than those from beta decay . these limits would roughly be equal to the upper limit from the standard model of the early universe . the sps at cern is considered the first facility to conduct the first experiment to search for hnls . the proposed detector would search for beauty particles in the previously known domain of very , very large beauty particles with masses above the planck level . this domain is unique to the lhc , and to comparable experiments at other research facilities . the proposed detector is based on existing technology and therefore requires a further r & d phase . a small research facility could build the entire detector in a few years . the design of the proposed detector is complex , in particular , the data collection and the design , as well as the technical aspects require further research . the technologies involved are being further developed with new tools . the impact that the construction of the hnl would have on particle physics is difficult to predict . in particular , it could address one of the most significant shortcomings of the detector : the lack ofthe exact nature of the beam , the distribution of # ##s . in addition , the results of this experiment , together with astronomical and other data , could be used to determine the nature of dark energy . we are grateful to g . arduini , g . calviani , j . grenier , j . gschwendtner and j . vincke for stimulating discussions and providing information about the beam design and the results . we would like to thank j . rademakers for drawing the three dimensional picture of the beam . j . flegel is also grateful for adapting the design of the lhcb beam to our needs . we are grateful to a . gninenko and a . rozanov for stimulating discussions and to a . van herwijnen for setting up our web site . g . aad _ et al . _ , atlas collaboration , phys . * * 716 * ( 2012 ) * , arxiv : astro - ph / 1207 . 7214 ;
