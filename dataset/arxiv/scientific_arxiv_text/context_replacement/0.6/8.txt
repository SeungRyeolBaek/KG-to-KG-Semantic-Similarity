with most research efforts being devoted to the development of neurocomputers based on the structure of the brain , a paradigm shift is underway in the field of computing based on the classic von - neumann model . the @ xmath0 @ xcite , @ xmath1 @ xcite and the ibm @ xmath2 @ xcite are some of the major neuromorphic projects that seek to develop brain - based computing systems suitable for sensing ( image , sound , video ) , learning and classification tasks . since computer algebra is based on the classic load , store and forward model , these neuromorphic computing systems are both parallel and memory - based and are highly suitable for brain mapping tasks and for computer applications to that end , researchers have developed novel nanoelectronic devices where the neural network can provide a solution to the sensing and computational tasks occurring in the brain . the main motivation for the development of these post - von neumann nano - cmos devices , sensors and computational processors comes from the fact that the physical differences between the cmos technology and the computer hardware can result in different memory and performance requirements for the underlying computer hardware . a particularly important application is the use ofa human example was the ibm pc @ ##tooth , where the power consumption was estimated to be of the order of a watt @ xmath3 @ xcite . while the power required to power the human brain can vary greatly as we move along the pathway in the plant kingdom , the power consumption in the animal kingdom is only a few tens of watts . in a neuromorphic nervous system , there are the connections between neurons and their connectivity determines the nature of the information transmission between the neurons . the exact mechanisms that cause the ` ` learning ' ' and ` ` learning ' ' of these synaptic connections are still under investigation . recently , researchers have attempted to replicate the other phenomena observed in the brain using nanoelectronic devices like phase change sensors @ xcite , @ xmath4 memristors @ xcite and spintronic sensors @ xcite , etc . however , most of the research has focused on non - volatile phase changes of the brain in comparison to the dynamic properties of the neurons it contains compared to long - term memory @ xcite and the nature of this memory has been largely ignored . as a matter of fact , the experiments conducted in@ xcite ##s suggests that neurons form an adaptive memory system where they exhibit temporary activation , and then undergo long - term activation , depending on the strength of the resulting action potential . these molecular and meta - stable memory adaptation mechanisms can lead to neuromorphic architecture where the volatile memory can adapt itself to the new environment since areas of the brain that have been previously receiving electrical stimulation will be rapidly activated and able to store more recent information . therefore , it is necessary to implement these volatile phase memory mechanisms into a neuromorphic architecture in order to benefit from the computational power that the meta - stable memory adaptation mechanism has to offer . [ drawing1 ] ( 2 ) describes the molecular mechanisms involved in these volatile memory adaptation mechanisms . during the transmission of an action potential from the pre - neurons to the post - neurons of the brain , the release of ionic species from @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 causes the release of ions from the pre - to the post - neurons . this results in the activation of the neural network . however , in advance of the action potential , the ionic species slowly dies due to athis happens and the ionic strength decreases . this process is known as short - term memory ( lt ) @ xcite . however , if the action potential occur suddenly , the concentration of the ion does not have enough time to slow down to the desired level and this loss of time eventually results in long - term deterioration of the ionic structure . this process is known as short - term depression ( ltp ) . whereas ltd is a meta - stable state and lasts for a very short time period , ltp is a highly stable state which can last for hours , days or even weeks @ xcite . a different model is needed for the case where there is a long - term decrease in ionic strength with small changes and where the process is referred to as long - term depression ( ltd ) . the ltd and ltp models have been strongly compared to the short - term memory ( lt ) and long - term memory ( lt ) models proposed by atkinson and shiffrin @ xcite ( cf . [ drawing1 ] ( 2 ) ) . this latter model divides the human brain into an ltd and an lt . upon the receipt of the first information , information is then storedin the brain . however , upon repeated stimulation , information is lost to the brain . while the ` ` stuck ' ' can occur at a slow rate in the brain , information can be lost for a much longer time in the brain . in order to overcome such volatile - resistance mechanisms , a nanoelectronic material is required that is able to undergo meta - stable resistance reinforcement depending on the intensity of the stimulation and to return to a long - term stable resistance depending on frequent stimulation . therefore , balance between synaptic resistance reinforcement , learning and resistance reinforcement is a critical factor for designing nanoelectronic devices . in the next section , we will discuss the relationship of the dynamic properties of a nanomagnet to the volatile - resistance mechanisms found in the brain . let us briefly describe the basic structure and mode of operation of the mtj @ xcite ##r shown in figure . [ drawing2 ] ( 2 ) . the structure consists of two thin layers separated by a silicon oxide layer ( fir ) . the thickness of one of the layers is called ` ` pinned ' ' and thus it is known as the ` ` stuck ' ' layer ( pl ) .the spin of the outer layer , represented by the ` ` internal spin ' ' ( pl ) , can be controlled by an external input current @ xmath7 . the mtj structure has two very different spin configurations the low conducting ` ` anti - parallel ' ' orientation ( ap ) , where pl and pl ##s are opposite , and the high conducting ` ` parallel ' ' orientation ( pl ) , where the spins of the two layers are in the same direction . let us assume that the resting state of the mtj structure is called the anti - ap state . for the input current ( pl ) to flow from terminal t2 to terminal t1 , electrons must flow from terminal t1 to t2 and be spin - trapped in the pl of the mtj . then , these spin - trapped electrons will continue to transfer the spin of the mtj ` ` parallel ' ' to the pl . it is worth noting here that the spin - trapping of the electrons in the mtj is similar to the release of calcium from a living cell . the atp and ltp interactions involved in the mtj due to the spin - trapping of the excited states can be .consider the energy profile of the surface of the mtj . let the difference between the fl energy , @ xmath8 , and the pl ##ization , @ xmath9 , be given by @ xmath10 . the fl energy as a function of @ xmath10 has been shown in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( a ) where the two energy profile , ( @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 ) are given by the energy profile , @ xmath13 . during the transition from the ap state to the ap state , the fl starts to transition from @ xmath12 to @ xmath11 . upon the arrival of the input stimulus , the fl energy goes ` ` downhill ' ' in the energy profile ( from the point 1 to point 2 in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( a ) ) . however , since point 2 is a meta - ap state , it keeps going ` ` downhill ' ' to point 1 , if the stimulus is frequent . if the input stimulus is not frequent enough , the fl will start to transition back to the ap state after the stimulus . however , if the stimulus is frequent , the fl will not have enough energy to reach point 2 and will collapse .and to cross the energy barrier ( point 3 in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( b ) ) . it is worth noting however , that after crossing the energy barrier of @ xmath14 , it becomes increasingly difficult for the mtj to exit it and switch back to the original ap state . this is in contrast with the standard model of working memory where it becomes increasingly difficult for the brain to ` ` process ' ' information during transition from ap to ap . however , once it has crossed the energy barrier , it starts switching from the ap to the ltp state ( point 4 in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( b ) ) . the lifetime of the mtj in the ltp state is determined by the size of the energy barrier . the lifetime of the ltp state is directly proportional to the energy barrier @ xcite . for example , for an energy barrier of @ xmath15 hours in this model , the ltp state is @ xmath16 hours . the lifetime can be extended to be @ xmath17 hours by setting the energy threshold of @ xmath18 . the lifetime can be extended by varying the energy barrier , or equivalently , that of the mtj . the ap - ltpbehavior of the mtj can be easily derived from the spin dynamics of the pl resulting in maxwell - lifshitz - schwarz ( llg ) equations with additional assumptions to account for the angular momentum . according to slonczewski @ xcite , @ xmath19 where , @ xmath20 is the length length of the length , @ xmath21 is the gyromagnetic constant for fl , @ xmath22 is stokes ' constant , @ xmath23 is the effective thermal field and the e - constant for the curves . from @ xcite , @ xmath24 is the number of points in the space of the @ xmath25 ( @ xmath26 is permanent magnet and @ xmath27 is temporary magnet ) , and @ xmath28 is the electric field generated by the thermal field @ xmath29 ( @ xmath30 is the spin - orbit dynamics of the pl ) . this field is considered as an effective thermal field @ xcite , @ xmath31 , where @ xmath32 is the probability distribution with zero mean and zero standard deviation , @ xmath33 isthe expression , @ xmath34 is the input and @ xmath35 is the next time step . the [ llg ] can be calculated by performing thermal calculations as , @ xmath36 where , in the absence of the input , the temperature of the device builds up according to frequency of the input . however , in the absence of the input , it starts growing down according to the last two terms in the expression of the above equation . it is worth noting , that , in most digital systems , temperature and frequency of the input stimulus will not have any effect on the pre - ltp response of the device . therefore , frequency of the input is a crucial factor in this process . even if the heat capacity of the input is low , the device will not increase its temperature if the frequency of the input is high . we see that this behavior is observed in mtjs by performing llg calculations ( see thermal calculations ) . the behavior of the mtj as a function of @ xmath10 can be expressed as , @ xmath37 where , @ xmath38 ( @ xmath39 ) is the mtj value and the average ( ap ) value of .as shown in fig . [ drawing2 ] ( a ) , the mtj structure exhibits meta - current transition ( ts ) and is only able to undergo ltp when the time interval of the stimulation ##s is reached ( @ xmath40 ) . however , after each stimulation with time interval of @ xmath41 , the device undergoes ltp transition incrementally . [ drawing2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) show the relationship between memory growth and memory maintenance in the mtj structure that is able to undergo ts and ltp in the brain . we use simulation parameters to model the ts and ltp transitions in the mtj structure based on the time interval of stimulation . the following simulation parameters were derived from the simulation @ xcite and have been presented in table i . [ 1 ] table i . device simulation @ [ t = " ^ , ^ " , ] + the mtj structure responds to multiple stimulation , each stimulation producing a ts transition of between @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 in seconds . as shown in fig . [ drawing3 ] , the rate of ltp transition and the electrical activity at the time of each stimulation increases with increase in the currentvariability of the response . the effect of response time variability can be further examined by measures related to post - stimulus processing ( ppf : neural activity increase when a new stimulus replaces a lost first stimulus ) and post - stimulation processing ( ptp : total neural activity increase when a large number of different stimuli are presented simultaneously ) @ xcite . [ drawing4 ] provides both ppf ( before 9th stimulus ) and ptp ( after 10th stimulus ) measurements for the mtj network with variation in the stimulation interval . the measurements closely resemble those found in the gap networks @ xcite where ppf measurements showed that there was a small neural activity increase when the stimulation interval was high , whereas ptp measurements showed ltp transition after multiple stimulations with a large increase in neural activity on variation in the stimulation interval . therefore , stimulation interval variability plays a critical role in the mtj network to determine the probability of ltp transition . the combined effects of learning and memory on the mtj synapses were first studied in the @ xmath44 memory array . the array was created as a laboratory experiment of the purdue university .where a total of two images ( orders of magnitude @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 in total ) is generated for pixel by pixel . the values of the memory changes of the memory array after the stimulation have been recorded for the different time periods of @ xmath47 and @ xmath48 respectively . although the memory array continues to store the same information even after stimulation , it fails to return to memory for the time @ xmath49 and the memory is completely lost @ xmath50 after stimulation . therefore , it transitions back to memory again for @ xmath51 . it is worth noting however , that the same amount of information is transmitted to the mtj in both cases . the model not only provides a # ##ization of the dynamic evolution of a large array of mtj neurons as a result of stimulation but also provides opportunities for the development of new neuromorphic models using the concepts of st and lt . researchers interested in the theoretical basis of these models of spintronic neurons are referred to below . the relevance of this work to state - of - the - art research can be summarized as follows . this is the first detailed study of st and ltp behavior in the mtj2 . we studied the relation of voltage levels in a single cell to the excited state of electrons in the mtj and performed computer simulations to determine the effect of stimulus intensity on the ltp mechanism in such an mtj device . there have been many reports of other quantum devices that can exhibit similar anti - ltp mechanisms : @ xmath52 neurons @ xcite and @ xmath53 memristors @ xcite . however , it is worth noting here , that the voltage levels are typically of the order of two ( 1 . 3v in @ xcite and 80mv in @ xcite ) and stimulus levels are of the order of a few tens ( 1ms in @ xcite and 1 . 5 ##m @ xcite ) . in contrast , similar effects can be observed in mtj devices with much lower stimulus levels ( average stimulus levels of a few hundred @ xmath54 and tens of a few @ xmath55 ) . we hope that this data will enable proof - of - concept experiments to develop novel mtj devices that could potentially lead the way for future ultra - high performance quantum neuromorphic .journal of quantum optics . the project is funded in part by , center for spintronic networks , optics , and quantum ##ties ( c - net ) , the marco and nasa funded starnet project , by the stanford research institute , the national science foundation , intel , and by the national materials science and engineering research association . j . schemmel , j . fieres , and j . meier , _ _ neural networks , 2008 . ijcnn 2008 .
