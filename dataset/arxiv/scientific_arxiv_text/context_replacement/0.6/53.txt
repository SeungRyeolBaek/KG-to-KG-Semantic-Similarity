it has been known for a long time that due to this collision and the interaction , pure plane waves ( cpw ) exist in spacelike stability [ 1 ] . these properties are only possible when the waves are endowed with a large cross section due to the interaction . a solution given by chandrasekhar and xanthopoulos ( 2004 ) [ 2 ] , also provides an explanation of this situation , namely , ch has a cauchy point ( ch ) instead of a spacelike one . however , this article has a section devoted entirely to the question of existence of ch contained in . ch contained in spacetimes of cpw was shown by yurtsever to be stable against matter - wave interactions [ 3 ] . the density functional theory of ch is also an important result [ 4 ] . a linear transformation back to the cpw spacetime would transform the ch into an electromagnetic field . the fundamental field that was successful in determining the existence of the ch in cpw was the electromagnetic ( em ) field itself . in other words , the effects of curvature on the fundamental field of the pure plane waves turned out to be stronger than the field whenem field is related to bs . in particular , collision of pure em waves can be a special case as far as field formation is concerned . so an alternative solution was given by schwarz and szekeres ( 2001 ) which described the collision of two weakly coupled pure em waves [ 7 ] . the field ( in short , ch ) formed in the interaction region of the bs solution was able to be removed by a linear transformation . on the null boundary , however , formed esential ##ly , which could not be removed by other transformations . since ch field and em field both play roles in the formation of the field it is possible to distinguish these two solutions . this is the cross - metric of the bs ( cpbs ) solution which was discovered some time ago [ 6 , 7 ] . this solution has the interesting property that the weyl fields are not generated in the interaction region . the solution , however , did not remove the singularities formed on the null boundary . in this case we used cpbs , as a special case , instead of bs , with some other special cases to test the validity of the ch stability theorem proved previously by helliwell and konkowski ( hk ) [ 8 , 9 ] .despite the # # ##s of both schmidt and yurtsever the result seems to be very helpful in reaching a definite conclusion about the stability of the ch . this is our main motivation for solving the problem here , for the sake of the solutions of cpw . in this case we look at the spacetimes : a ) null plane waves with a null test field and b ) null plane waves with non - null test field with null field . , fig . 1 for these examples . the stability of ch should be follwed from the results obtained by hk and wang [ 2001 ] . curvature of maximal - extended spacetimes can be classified into three different types : quasiregular ( qr ) , uniform curvature ( dt ) and non - uniform curvature ( nc ) . the ch curvature of due to hk is formulated as follows . for all maximal extended spacetimes with ch , the backreaction due to test field ( whose associated stress - energy tensor is @ xmath0 ) must cross the boundary in one of the following ways . @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 and a known null particle @ xmath3 are null , and if theself - strain @ xmath4 in all freely chosen orthonormal ( ppon ) frames is finite , so the ch is non - unstable . b ) if @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 and any null dust density @ xmath3 is finite , then @ xmath4 is in all ppon frames , then an unstable ch will be formed at the ch . c ) if @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 and any null dust density @ xmath3 is , then an sc ##h will be formed at the ch . + first , the paper attempts to introduce a vector field into the test case and describe the effects it will produce . if no effects exist , then an exact back - reaction , the ch will react with an infinite contribution to the field ( i . e . versus reaction ) . then an exact back - reaction will make the ch unstable and turn it into a vector field . + the paper is presented as follows . in section ii , we present the cpbs theory and the sc ##ness of the mathematical model as described in section a . section iii , deals with theory and test cases and quantum field theory .in section iv , we give an exact back reaction calculation for the collision of two # # ##g waves with magnetic fields . the combination of weyl and einstein equations is given in appendix a . the mapping of the metric coordinates to the real cpbs spacetime and the exact back reaction calculation is given in section v . appendix a is provided for the calculation of this metric . the section is concluded with a discussion in section vi . the metric that allows collision of electromagnetic waves with the second kind was found to : [ 1 ] + @ xmath5 for this form of the metric our coordinates are + @ xmath6 for which @ xmath7 is a metric of the second kind , @ xmath8 is independent of time and @ xmath9 stands for the test null coordinate . it can be shown here that for @ xmath10 the metric reduces to : . unlike the bs metric , however , this is conformally non - trivial for @ xmath11 , where the conformal curvature is given by the inner product . as a matter of fact this metric is a different form of the bs metric . a slightly different form of the bs metric with second kind was found for : [2 ] . their paper , however , uses the ehlers metric and gives two additional solutions which are quite different from ours . these solutions include ch in the interaction region . our result set out in this paper , namely , that the metric is invariant against sectional curvature can now be shown to correspond to the above metric as well . as it was stated , the interaction region @ xmath12 of the new metric consists of c - c without self - action . we want to know all the possible values of x ( s ) . the new definition of the weyl metric helps to accomplish our goal . we find that the real part of the weyl metric @ xmath13 is given by @ xmath14 \ { { s } \ ] ] where we have using the formulas @ xmath15 and @ xmath16 we have @ xmath17 which corresponds to the real part of the original spacetime given by @ xmath18 . we find that the interaction region is affected by the action of the new metric . a similar formula for @ xmath19 yields the new spherical hypersurface ##s @ @ xmath20 . } in order to understand the exact nature ofthe next we focus our attention on the local region at @ xmath21 . the component in this region is written in the form @ xmath22 \ ] ] where @ xmath23 we find that for @ xmath24 , @ xmath25 is a positive - definite function which means that all such components vanish except the ones found here in the local frame , and at @ xmath26 . to do this we have studied all the components in bs and ppon frames ( in region ii ) . it is known that the sectional curvature must vanish at @ xmath27 . in the ppon frame , however , they are not , and according to the gauge theory of wilson and wilson , a component is called a quasiregular ( qr ) singular . this is known to be the simplest form among the types of components . to see whether the qr is mild or not we have the vector fields used to form a local frame and study the components . this we can do in the follwing case . we are interested in the types of qr components that are found at @ xmath28 in region ii and @ xmath29 in region iii . tofor their solution we shall study structure and shape of the tensor and forces generated by the stress - energy tensor in em and ppon regions . + our study of gravity can be extended to region ii below . we shall consider the forces that start at the # ##front and move toward the quasiregular front . solution of the equations in region ii can be done by using lagrangian mechanics and using @ xmath30 as a parameter . the parameters are @ xmath31 } { 1 } \ left ( 1 ) + \ frac { 3p _ { y _ { 0 } } \ left [ 5q ^ { 2 } + 1 -

rotating frame . to test the stability of quasiregular systems , let us consider a test em field whose action potential is choosen from from equation [ 1 ] to be @ xmath41 with the parameters @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 . the only nonzero angular -

rule method . in the first section we give an explicit solution that has cross - section vector fields associated with the curvature . in the second section , we use hk - theory to prove the existence of qr curvature in the bs region of cpbs spacetime . according to the conjecture these new solutions are unstable . in order to prove the validity of the conjecture we introduce this new solution . + let the curvature be ; @ xmath70 \ ] ] the ems solution is obtained from the electrovacuum equation . the ems solution is obtained in the following way . the lagrangian motion of the system is .[ @ xmath71 \ end { aligned } \ ] ] which will produce ##s the following equations from a variational perspective . where @ xmath72 is the em field and we have the vector is 2 -

section wave is to transform the solution into the form , @ xmath91 , @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 representing the solution of electrovacuum , and @ xmath89 ##1 the solution that results from the interaction of the electromagnetic field . + it can be easily seen that for @ xmath10 our solution is the plane wave equation associated with electromagnetic field . it is also the exact back reaction solution to the test vector field solution in the curved spacetime considered by hk ( ) . it is clear to us that the weyl equations are nonzero and non - linear in the basis @ xmath94 . this is in aggrement with the solution of the basis considered by hk . for @ xmath24 the same solution is the exact back reaction solution of the test vector field solution in thecpbs spacetime . in case 2 , we consider the weyl and einstein equations . . + from the explicit solution we see that , the vector field @ xmath95 is singular . @ xmath13 and @ xmath54 are singular when @ xmath96 and @ xmath97 . this implies that the boundary condition of the explicit solution is a positive one . this result is in perfect agreement with the einstein equations . * ( ) * tell us the two null test directions are in the cpbs direction . for this we consider in both cases the @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 directions of the spacetime . we have in the first case @ xmath100 where we have in the case @ xmath101 corresponding to @ xmath102 the energy - momentum relation for two positively charged test particles can be written as @ xmath103 where @ xmath104 and @ xmath105 are the relative mass differences of the particles . the null test is @ xmath106 and @ xmath107 and @ xmath108 with @ xmath109 @xmath110 we observe from ( 1 ) that @ xmath111 which is true for @ xmath112 . the components of energy - momentum tensor in ppon frame are proportional to the metric ( 1 ) . this construction leaves all the components of energy - momentum tensor ##s . in the case of @ xmath113 which takes our attention back to the metric this also lies on the horizon @ xmath114 . because of the energy - momentum tensor being finite , we can construct it from the metric @ xmath115 . one has , @ xmath116 the metric is @ xmath99 , which is not necessarily true in the @ xmath98 case . from the null metric @ xmath117 a similar construction with the null metric @ xmath118 with @ xmath119 @ xmath120 and the metric @ xmath121 from the metric ( 2 ) we observe that @ xmath122 which lies on the horizon @ xmath123 . the metric @ xmath124 constructed from the cosmic metric also yields . the ppon frame of thethe momentum components are also used and it is shown that all of the components are equivalent to the equation ( 1 ) . this means that the components of energy - momentum tensor change as the limit is reached . when we consider the hk problem , an exact back reaction solution will be a complete solution . we have obtained an exact back reaction solution of two crossing null shells in the interaction region of the cpbs spacetime . + * ( ) * the metric given by @ xmath125 where @ xmath126 with @ xmath127 positive constant was used by wang [ 2001 ] to describe interaction of two null shells ( the strong interaction ) . the interaction region is equivalent to the de # space spacetime . in other words the space of two crossing null shells is also equivalent to the de ##hn space . it can be shown also that the product of the conformal parameters @ xmath128 , with @ xmath129 positive constant is equivalent to the anti - spin ##hn factor . + the interaction region of cpbs and null shells can be given by @ xmath130 this leads to the metric @ xmath131where @ xmath132 corresponds to the correlation function of the cpbs , . under this condition the spin and weyl numbers remain constant ( or at least reduced to a conformal parameter ) because @ xmath133 is the energy that comes from those numbers . the sectional curvature , k , which is zero in the case of cpbs , appears as nonzero and becomes zero as we approach the limit . equation 2 describes the two equations @ xmath134 and @ xmath135 . thus the strong back reaction solution is a de ##ity solution suggested by the authors . it is easily seen that the @ xmath136 , which is one of the shells provides us with a single shell moving in the @ xmath37 - direction . from the solution we see that moving a single shell gives rise to a strong back reaction in the spacetime . the solution , in particular , is closed and collapses into a vacuum in the case of a single , or even a single , open shell . let us consider as an alternative solution that the metric ( space ) can be viewed as a collection of shells on a de ##hn manifold . one of thewe have an interaction region in the # ##hn space which is not stable for @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 . in this way we have determined the existence of qr vanishing in the cpbs spacetime . two types of force fields are used to solve the problem . first we have posed the same conjecture to the real cpbs spacetime . from the theory we see that the qr vanishing in the step waves is invariant according to the theory , and it is transformed into an invariant . this completes the proof of the conjecture . finally , the exact chain - rule result is that beside the exact solution for the force fields @ xmath139 and @ xmath140 . there are quasiregular fields in the interaction region . the boundary of the region is spin free and the hypersurface @ xmath141 is a pseudo - cauchy space . as it was pointed out by hk for the case of the em step waves , hk has to determine the exact location of the field in the interaction region . we have also solved the same problem for the cross field case of the em step waves . the case of cross fields .results in the physical sense . + + we have applied test em field to the entire cpbs spacetime . the effect of this field on the qr field is stronger than the effect of the test field itself . we have shown that the qr field is unstable and transforms into a sc . to determine the stability of the solution , we have introduced a new solution , the exact back reaction solution to the test em field in the cpbs spacetime . the solution is the transformation of the - em test case to the test case . the analysis of weyl and the solution shows that @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 holds . the solution is unstable and unlike the test em field , the solution has the form of ch ##s ##n . + + , we have applied test em field into the interaction region of cpbs spacetime . the solution shows that the ch is unstable and transforms into sc . this solution was compared with the exact back - reaction solution and found that the solution holds . to determine the type of field in the interaction region of cpbs spacetime , the gauge metric is used and the ppon dimensions can be used . non -
