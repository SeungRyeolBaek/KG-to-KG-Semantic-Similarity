about 100 years ago however , very rare and unusual events , like centauros , were observed in cosmic ray ( cosmic ) radiation in gas chambers at chacaltaya by himself and others @ xcite . those events were very different from what is normally observed in nature , with a large number of nuclei and a small number of electrons and holes , which suggested the existence of super - fast - beta - decay processes . thus , a significant reduction in the ratio of nuclei to neutral atoms could be observed . the nature and mechanism of centauro events was a long debate , that followed the discovery of the nuclear structure of hydrogen , and is still being resolved @ xcite . however , centauro events were also an important basis for the development of the theory of charged chiral systems ( dccs ) that emerged in the early 1990s @ xcite . for a comprehensive discussion , see ref . @ xcite . assuming that a given chemical reaction could be cooled to the critical ( near ) critical temperature for chiral symmetry breaking , i . e . for temperatures of the order of @ xmath1mev @ xcite , and cooled to higher temperatures , the reaction##ral gas , cooled to helium could decay in any direction in isospin mode . in the opposite ( unstable ) direction , it could break up itself into a stable , or non - stable state , and then decay to the unstable , chirally broken state . the fact that dccs could be used in high - energy heavy ion experiments motivated many experimental studies and theoretical experiments @ xcite . most of the energies used in such heavy ion experiments are high enough to produce an unstable chirally broken electron - hole plasma , and the resulting spontaneous decay can bring the plasma back to the equilibrium @ xcite , so that the process of chiral symmetry breaking and breaking can be modeled in a realistic way @ xcite , so that the change of the order parameter can be directly explained by a spontaneous reaction that often leads to spontaneous fluctuations and instability @ xcite . since , by definition , the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking , i . e . the chiral direction , is constant with respect to the interaction energy ( consistent with the @ xmath2 - term ##inator field theory for strong interactions ) in a dcc , this would be a good way to explain the large amount ofparticles surrounded by electrons and holes , and the distribution of neutral particles with respect to charged particles . because of the outcome of the experiment and the presence of centauro particles , dcc formation appears to be a very important phenomenon in the theory of strong interactions . however , given its classical nature ( see isospin theory ) , it should be ruled out by other statistical analysis methods . so far , there has been no evidence from cr or other experiments . motivated by the possibility of obtaining much better results in future ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) experiments than in the past , and that an event - by - event analysis for future high - energy experiments can in fact be done , we investigate the mechanism of dcc formation in primary air showers . if dccs are produced by high - energy nuclear reactions in the primary , the expected result from the primary shower is very large event - by - event changes in the neutral - to - charged particle ratio , and this could be the outcome of the secondary air shower . very similar , but different results are reported by c . @ xcite . in this article we look for evidence of dcc production in all possible observables of uhecr experiments .we present our results for the effects of the maximum ( @ xmath0 ) and minimum of particles in the shower , and their relation to the neutral - to - charged particle fraction ##s produced by the primary collision . to simulate the effects from the collision of a dcc , we must change the neutral - to - charged particle fraction , so that the effect follows the same pattern , as will be shown below . although this is not a very accurate simulation of the effects of the primary collision , we believe it ignores the important factors that need to be considered in order to determine the feasibility of using dccs in uhecr simulations . this section is organized as follows . in section ii we first describe the effects of dccs , including the knock - out effect and the inverse square root expansion of the charged particle fraction . in section iii the methodology for the simulation is presented . we present corsika @ xcite , a method for numerical simulations of hot jupiter showers caused by high - energy gamma ray bursts . in section iv we present and explain our results . section v presents our results . it is generally accepted that for high - energy bursts , or e . g . by increasing in the energy , the interaction becomes more chiral (this would be an effective solution even if the particles were ( massless ) , so that the chiral symmetry , which is the decay constant for that system , also disappears . on the other hand , for low temperatures the chiral symmetry reaches a non - zero value and breaks down the chiral symmetry of ( massless ) particles @ xcite . using the sigma model , we can calculate an effective value for the chiral field degrees of freedom and study the effects of chiral symmetry breaking and breaking . if we restrict our model to two types of magnetic field , up and down , that can be easily compared with the standard model model restricted to particles @ xcite . in that case , the field degrees of freedom are holes , @ xmath3 , and the electrons , @ xmath2 . in the high - temperature case , the potential values are , whereas in the low case is @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 , where @ xmath6 is the exponential decay constant . the sigma model we have in mind is a hypothetical high - energy heavy ion accelerator that would produce a massive electron - hole plasma where chiral symmetry is completely broken. if the plasma is quenched to high energy during fusion , the plasma will return to the vacuum with a large number of particles . however , the plasma will travel along many different paths in chiral ##ity until it finally reaches the true vacuum , i . e . it can ` ` evolve ' ' into different states , and the ratio of neutral to charged particles produced depends only on the current energy level of the particle . in other words , the expansion of the plasma is exponential in the number of charged particles , causing a transition state and an increase in the ratio of charged to neutral particles . this effect can be , of course , explained away by mass transfer . a more realistic theoretical model for the existence of dccs , the _ inside - out _ scenario , was proposed by bjorken and h @ xcite . imagine a high - energy plasma at high energies . during hadronization , most of the energy produced at the collision point is carried away by the surrounding partons at about the speed of light . this hot and cold ##ned state separates the relatively small plasma from the true vacuum . as the plasma ages , the vacuum expands , and what was once a local minimum becomes a global maximum . theit is then empty and one of the black - holes should be used , with a strong preference for the other one . however , if the length of the shell is long enough , the electron density in the shell can be reduced from its normal state , since it has very little energy , @ xmath7 mev / @ xmath8 @ xcite . when the electron shell hadronizes , the field generated by the external field is replaced by the surrounding field , which can be correlated and cause changes in the event - to - event distribution . assuming that the interaction energy is large enough to be described semiclassically , one can use the double shell model with spontaneous symmetry breaking for the description of the field @ xcite . alternatively , one can write the energy of this model as the sum of these numbers of electrons : @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 is the isospin number . the diamond shaped shell is represented by @ xmath11 with a charge @ xmath12 , where @ xmath13 is the point where the current stops . during the hadronization , the currents @ xmath14 disappear and the currents @ xmath3moving towards the origin into the neutral particles . thus , the neutral system is represented by the source @ xmath15 where @ xmath16 is the scale factor , and the sum of the isospin components @ xmath17 . the correlation coefficient of the system with source @ xmath18 and isospin components @ xmath10 at @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 is the two - dimensional fourier transform of the source @ xmath21 at @ xmath22 . the generation of modes is a poisson process with momentum @ xmath23 and the number of modes produced per unit of mass is then given by @ xcite @ xmath24 however , one knows that the momentum and the chiral component of the source @ xmath25 will vary event by event for each event . let us assume that the initial state is shifted into one of the following directions , i . e . : @ xmath26 and that all the components of chiral ##ity move in the same direction @ xmath27 and isospin direction : @ xmath28 in some areas of physics the neutral particle system , .the @ xmath29 shares a normal distribution with the @ xmath30 . in this case , in the case of the vector @ xmath31 , the probability of the particle being charged is very high . however , if they are the products of a dcc decay , this probability is not significant . in particular , if there is a positive isospin condition , the vector @ xmath27 can decay in any direction along the unit vector . example : @ xmath32 where @ xmath33 is the angle between the unit vector @ xmath27 and the @ xmath34 vector . thus , one has the following well - known values for the neutral state , @ xcite : @ xmath35 the probability of more than 10 @ xmath36 of particles being charged , for example , 10 @ xmath37 . the conditions of a high energy neutral state produced by a normal decay process are only possible to reach in heavy ion collisions at the very high energies of those produced at rhic and to be reached at the lhc , as well as in uhecr collisions at the bottom of the detector . the maximum size of the detector is that of the experimental detector##er ##p @ xcite ( for shower observations at ground level and for satellite data collection ) has been providing high quality data and accurate measurements for the p @ xcite . therefore , even though the formation of a dcc is highly unlikely , we feel it is important considering the relevance of this data to the study of showers measured in uhecr . the neutral particle fraction concept , viz . ( [ sqrt ] ) , is at the core of our efforts to account for dcc effects in uhecr measurements . therefore , any attempt to determine the effects caused by the formation of a dcc should consider the composition of the shower sample with respect to the neutral particle fraction produced by the shower itself . this fraction represents the relative abundance of particles in the solar and hadronic regions of the shower . in this case , we have two observables which are commonly used in uhecr measurements : the maximum angle of the atmosphere ( defined as the gradient of the atmospheric pressure along the x axis @ xmath38 and expressed in units of m / @ xmath39 ) at which the shower reaches its maximum intensity , @ xmath0 , and the number of particles in the plasma @ xmath40 . this isnote that the interaction @ xmath0 is determined from the first interaction cross - section and the associated energy and momentum @ xcite . if dccs do exist , the conditions for them to be observed should include not only high energy interactions , but the sites where these interactions are produced should also be studied as well , since dccs exist in ` ` small ' ' space - time , where the chiral nucleus is always moving in the same direction in the universe . with those conditions in mind , we have started to experiment with spontaneously induced collisions at @ xmath41 sites . however , these collisions are selected from normal interactions by random interactions with a large number of excited states ( @ xmath42 ) which , in turn , should lead to a large decay of the first interaction . for the models discussed in this article , we have used corsika 0 . 617 @ xcite with the theoretical models sibyll 0 . 1 @ xcite and gheisha 2002d @ xcite , for high and low energy interactions , respectively . the dcc - induced collision ##al model is as follows : the @ xmath43 interactions are observed and their associated particles ( mainly electrons and holes )then ; finally , all of the neutral particles in this sample are converted into charged particles ; the resulting sample particle is then sent back into corsika to interact with the other ##s in the plasma . such a process is observed for different @ xmath44 collisions and at different contact points . the first interaction - type ( @ xmath45 ) values for dcc - like showers will therefore be the same as for normal fe initiated showers in these collisions . this is a good approximation , since the dcc fusion usually takes place during the secondary fusion phase of the initial central fusion , with the second interaction type section being the same as for the fe - fe fusion . we note that even if the exact method described above is used , the main components of the model are not taken into account . for example , fe initiated showers as well as normal fe initiated showers are simultaneously generated . for the fe initiated shower , we have generated both a sample generated by the ##ities and a sample with all the results . for each sample we have the value of @ xmath0 and the number of particles in the sample . from here on we shall denote our dcc - like fe initiated showers by fe + dcc . [ xmax ] is the @ xmat##h0 production of a proton shower ( @ xmath46 ) leads to an extremely large interaction ( @ xmath47 ) , that is , where all the samples produced @ xmath44 ##s are absorbed into @ xmath48 . for the case of s . ( [ sqrt ] ) , which occurs at @ xmath47 , the probability for more than 1 % of @ xmath44 ##s being produced is 1 % . four types of interactions : low energy ( # ##ity : fe - central ) , fe ( - central ) , fe + dcc and proton showers are known . thus , we say that the populations resulting from a proton collision are higher than the @ xmath0 , since the higher the probability of the initial interaction the higher is the resulting emission ##s into the system . and there is essencially little difference between the fe - central and the fe - dcc populations in samples of @ xmath0 , which would mean that the initial interaction where the @ xmath44 population is depleted together with the lower the probability due to the higher probability allows for the complete absence of these populations in the subsequent interactions . therefore , it is possible that we should start with the @ x##math0 occurs when looking for dccs signatures , and this phenomenon is characteristic of the large @ xmath44 fluctuations . another phenomenon which can be seen in fig . [ xmax ] is the large @ xmath0 fluctuations for fe - dcc and fe - # ##ites compared to those of fe and co with large centralites . this is to be expected , since the fluctuations in @ xmath0 have only two components : the the fluctuations at the initial shower angle in @ xmath45 ( which , in turn , depends on the scattering cross - section ) and those observed during the cascade , leading to the second . the latter depends on the initial shower angle ( the cascade ) , the former being larger for higher energy particles , i . e . those involved in the initial cascade . the observed mass distributions on the ground for the initial events described above are shown in fig . [ x _ dist ] . as expected , increasing the number of positively charged particles will lead to a much higher number of particles on the ground where the majority of the initial particles remain . when one considers two sets of data ( @ xmath0 and @ xmath40 ) , one has a clear picture of the fe - dc##c shower and all the other samples , as can be seen from fig . [ scatterplot ] . when showers with all the samples are observed , these showers show a high correlation between @ xmath0 and @ xmath40 . the correlation is such that showers with higher energy at much higher than ##s have , on average , a higher relative abundance at ground level , due to the increase in the density of the matter from @ xmath0 to the ground . whereas for fe - dc ##c one sees no correlation between @ xmath0 and @ xmath40 , for the majority of fe - dcc showers , however , a positive cross - correlation of about @ xmath49 g / @ xmath50 / @ xmath51 . [ this correlation is @ xmath52 g / @ xmath50 / etc . ] , as can be seen from fig . [ scatterplot ] . such an upward correlation can be interpreted as the negative correlation between @ xmath0 and the strength of the weak interaction , with about @ xmath0 , leading , on average , to higher abundance . when we compare neutral showers to neutral ones , the resulting( small @ xmath0 ) results in a high correlation number on the ground , compared to the low values ( large @ xmath0 ) . since the number of events on the ground depends both on the @ xmath44 and @ xmath53 and on the other parameters , due to the uncertainty , we have to do a more detailed analysis by using those parameters . using the linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) , similar to what has been done with @ xcite we have found , as a function of @ xmath53 , the power of is given by @ xmath54 , with the power of @ xmath55 , in the two - dimensions ( @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 ) given by : @ xmath58 where @ xmath59 ( @ xmath60 ) is the number of events from population @ xmath56 ( @ xmath57 ) misclassified as @ xmath57 ( @ xmath56 ) and @ xmath61 ( @ xmath62 ) is the number of events from population @ xmath56 ( @ xmath57 ) . from these results wewe observe half of the proton shower , with the other half being used for the calculation of the value of f . [ merit ] ( top , bottom and bottom right ) shows us the three - dimensional test data in the @ xmath63 sample for the first time , and 4 and 5 samples of @ xmath44 , @ xmath64 and @ xmath65 respectively . the merit factor as a fraction of @ xmath53 is shown in the bottom right corner of f . [ merit ] . one knows that for any value of @ xmath53 , proton showers can only be completely separated from fe - dcc , with merit powers of 100 % over the time period of @ xmath53 . for proton showers , of course , as we increase the @ xmath66 population , the merit factor becomes zero . non - proton showers are able to separate from the fe ( energy density ) population only for small values of @ xmath53 , where the number of particles on average is large enough to reach the fe - dcc population . fe - dccs , in which the proton shower contains a small fraction of @ xmath44 are too small for detection and would never be .. . however , even if dccs occur in abundance , very rare - @ xmath53 - are highly unlikely to occur taking into account the conservation of mass . ( [ sqrt ] ) . a more accurate estimate of the rate of formation would be to obtain a priori information about the emission lines for co and co , as well as the dcc formation mechanism . however , since neither the gamma rays ' reaction at the highest energy ( @ xmath67 ##ev ) nor the exact mechanism of dcc formation is known , the results for these observations are the best we can obtain so far . the recent improvement in quality and precision of uhecr data opens the possibility to look for common phenomena as well as rare phenomena using the standard model . among the latter , dccs have been observed over 2000 years ago , but rarely observed due to their rare nature . in this case , using @ ##bag ##h , we looked for examples of dccs forming in ultra - high - temperature ( @ xmath68ev ) , heating regions of the upper atmosphere . in addition , we studied the effect of the dcc formation on the observables @ xmath0 and @ xmath40 , via the difference in the energy- to - - - - at the central collision . for example , we have already observed vertical showers produced by holes and electrons . since dccs are expected to be produced in vertical showers , which lead to larger than expected fluctuations of @ xmath0 ( a ratio of : @ xmath69g / @ xmath50 ##g compared to above , for example ) , one should expect them in this region of extreme abundance . for the same reason , if dcc events are observed they should produce large fluctuations of @ xmath0 . however , based solely on the characteristics of this region one can easily distinguish between a vertical shower and a central collision and those produced in the absence of a dcc . the presence of dccs is associated with large event - to - event changes in the ratio of charged to neutral particles , @ xmath53 . in particular , for @ xmath53 , and large fluctuations compared to @ xmath70 , one should expect a large change in the relative abundance at the surface , especially for vertical showers . this observation was confirmed by the extensive series of experiments . @ xcite . in the special case of @ xmath47 , where dcc events lead to high -for hydrogen , we believe that this correlation is between the events of showers ( especially for hot regions ) and of dcc formation . for hydrogen @ xmath53 , one can easily distinguish these two events due to the large number of holes in the gas . but in this case , the energy is not affected by the pressure . for helium showers , there is a strong cross - correlation between @ xmath0 and @ xmath40 . this comes about since there is no correlation between @ xmath0 and the proton shower event , as was shown in the previous section . this correlation is not significant for a typical vertical shower . in contrast , for helium , due to high pressure , one would expect a positive correlation . even though the model presented here is somewhat crude , it has the potential of providing a model that is well under test for physics , and we believe it provides the essential ##s of the theory described . however , a more detailed model , that should provide a picture of the process of dcc formation , and its dependence on pressure , is still needed . we thank m . catalani and t . takahashi for their analysis . we also thank m . de souza for his work on the usp - san diego experiment [ .##pesp , [ 2008 / 04259 - 00 ] . this version was later adopted also by ibm , cnpq , faperj , fapesp and fujb / ufrj . j . l . a . _ _ et al . _ , prog . suppl . * 65 * , 151 ( 1971 ) ;
