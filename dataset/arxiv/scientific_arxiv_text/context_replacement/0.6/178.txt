reflection , which was first introduced by petit at the end of 19th century , has a long history @ xcite and has been used in many applications . there are two reflection reciprocal representations of the function as shown in fig . the representations in fig . [ fig1 ] ( a ) and [ fig1 ] ( b ) are transmission reciprocal and those in fig . [ fig1 ] ( b ) and [ fig1 ] ( c ) are reflection reciprocal . as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] , we denote transmission by @ xmath0 and reflection by @ xmath1 ; the symbols ##x and @ xmath2 stand for the wavenumber vector and reflection , respectively . the reflection coefficients are given by two reflections of the two components of the wavenumber vector : ( @ xmath3 ) and ( @ xmath4 ) . that on transmission is that @ xmath5 , and that on reflection is known as @ xmath6 , which is not very useful and therefore not accessible to us . the first # ##ization was given by petit in 1980 , @ xcite where the representation as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] was used for .surfaces such as the echelette surface . on the basis of the above formula for the solution of the scattering equation , the proof shows that reciprocal scattering occurs for electromagnetic waves everywhere of wavelength . it is impossible to extend the method to atoms because it would be impossible to find solutions of the form that satisfy the boundary conditions at the interface of the transmitted , reflected , and transmitted waves . the rest of the work on reciprocal optical response has been summarized in detail . since the 1970s , the scattering of atoms , elementary particles , and so on have been represented by the scattering matrix ( s - matrix ) . in the calculations of the s - matrix , it is assumed that there is reciprocal scattering in the matrix . the assumption leads to the unitarity of the s - matrix and makes it possible to prove it . the reciprocal scattering of many particles is proved using this method . @ xcite in this way we have a simple , rigorous , and exact proof of the reciprocal optical response for transmission and reflection based mainly on quantum electrodynamics . we start from the reciprocal scattering ##s . sec . [ th ] and solve the equation for first order transmission and reflection problems # sec . [ th ] . the solution fordue to the above . a physical and mathematical proof of this is given in fig . [ 1 ] . the structure and breaking point of the em waves is not known . the reciprocal theorem has been proved in many fields , such as classical mechanics , quantum mechanics , and optics . @ xcite ##s we prove the equality for and . when current sources exist as in fig . [ fig2 ] and the induced electromagnetic ( em ) waves exist in parallel and parallel ##ized form in which @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 , and @ xmath9 , then the reciprocal theorem describes and . the proof given in fig . for em waves and is equivalent . formula ( [ reci ] ) is valid only for systems with currents . the integrands have non - zero coefficients at the position @ xmath10 where and exist , that is , @ xmath11 . the formula describes the difference between the induced current sources @ xmath12 ( @ xmath13 ) and the induced em waves @ xmath14 which are zero at the position of the current sources @ xmath15 ( @ xmath16 ) . in this case , we introducethe fundamental relates to electromagnetic radiation in the transmission and reflection modes . here , we use the coordinates used for the definition of the fundamental in general . ( [ reci ] ) . an electric field located at the point @ xmath17 produces electromagnetic radiation , which is transmitted in the far field . when a single point @ xmath18 along the @ xmath19 axis is located at the point , it is written as @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 , where @ xmath22 is the unit vector along the @ xmath19 axis and @ xmath23 the distance of the point . the point in turn produces radiation , which in the far field is @ xmath24 where the coordinates ( @ xmath25 , @ xmath2 , @ xmath26 ) are used , the unit vector is given by @ xmath27 , and @ xmath28 . because the point @ xmath18 is given by @ xmath29 and that of point p is given by @ xmath30 , we have the coordinates @ xmath31 associated with the point @ xmath18 : @ .##math32 shows two pairs of @ xmath33 antennas ( long and short ) in the @ xmath34 plane as drawn in fig . the two antennas have the same frequency , and the angles are given by the vectors @ xmath35 ( @ xmath36 ) and @ xmath37 . in this case , the frequency is @ xmath38 . if the antennas all move with the same frequency , then the applied electric fields are equal and produce a wave front at a point away from the array in the @ xmath34 plane as drawn in fig . [ fig3 ] . the electric field component of the wave front , @ xmath39 , is @ xmath40 and comes with wavenumber of @ xmath41 . however , if we move the antenna array far away from the array , the emitted electromagnetic waves decay , turning into plane waves in the @ xmath34 plane to a certain extent . the number of antennas need to be large enough to produce the plane waves . for the second example , we use @ xmath42 ( @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 ) . see [ fig3] for the periodic source pattern , which is an additional periodic source moving along the @ xmath19 axis . the relationship between the vector @ xmath12 , the vector @ xmath35 of the current , and the wavenumber vector @ xmath41 of the wave ##form is represented as @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 . it is possible to convert the electric field into a power factor for the array of three sources : @ xmath47 where @ xmath48 is the fourier transform of @ xmath49 , @ xmath50 ( @ xmath51 ) , and @ xmath52 is the direction of the current along the @ xmath53 axis ( see ref . [ fig3 ] ) . the @ xmath19 axis is represented in polar coordinates in coordinates as @ xmath54 , where the components correspond to the directions along the @ xmath19 axis . when the source pattern is composed of infinitely many and many sources , the integration can be performed to reasonable accuracy as @ xmath55 where @ xmath56 . to ensure that the integration is accurate to @ xmath57 , the number of sources isto be smaller than @ xmath58 : @ xmath59 where @ xmath60 is the most common one of the two lines which is present at the position @ xmath17 . this condition would only be satisfied when @ xmath39 is a periodic line . by permutating 1 and 2 in fig . ( [ j1e2 ] ) , we get @ xmath61 . then ( [ j1e2 ] ) and the integral ##s in fig . ( [ reci ] ) lead to the equation @ xmath62 the electric field @ xmath63 ( @ xmath36 ) is present at the position @ xmath10 where there is a line @ xmath64 ( @ xmath65 ) . the equation in fig . ( [ reci ] ) is equivalent to fig . ( [ j1e2 ] ) which is satisfied only for the two lines of the corresponding electric field . the equation is also independent of higher order equations , which are used for the non periodic ##f - periodic systems . when there is a periodic ##ity in fig . [ fig3 ] , a similar result holds : @ xmat##h66 the form @ xmath67 is given by @ xmath68 from fig . ( [ t _ reci ] ) ( [ t _ reci ] ) , we can get the linear form @ xmath69 . the result of the is that @ xmath69 is independent of the linear form of @ xmath63 and this makes the proof quick and straightforward . the proof can be extended to two - dimensional periodic objects by replacing the one - dimensional periodic object in fig . [ fig3 ] with two - dimensional one . although we have only periodic objects , the proof can also be extended to non - periodic objects . to achieve this extension , fig . ( [ t _ r ] ) needs to be solved in the special case @ xmath70 , and a more precise proof for @ xmath71 is needed . equality for transmission lines is independent of reflection , reflection , and absorption - reflection . in fig . [ fig3 ] the two electric fields @ xmath14 are located in the @ xmath34 plane . the model is called # ##r in the context of # ##s and is also sometimes referred@ xmath72 mode . for the ##m ( which is also called @ xmath73 mode ) for which @ xmath14 has a axis perpendicular to the @ xmath74 axis , the result is similar to what we just discussed except that the mirrors are rotated along the @ xmath74 axis . reciprocal transmission is also calculated in a similar way . the result is shown in figure . the two equations have to be combined to calculate the mirror rotation along the @ xmath19 axis . the calculation of @ xmath71 leads to the reciprocal transmission for the @ xmath75 . note that @ xmath76 , etc . ( [ e0 _ reci ] ) has to be obtained by replacing the periodic crystal with a periodic one . an example of the frequency response is shown below . fig [ fig5 ] ( a ) shows the structure of the sample and the growth curve . the sample consists of cubic crystals suspended between thin layers of cu and cr on a glass plate . the diameter is 1200 mm , as shown by the growth lines in fig . [ fig5 ] ( b ) . the unit cell has the geometry of cu : cu : cr :x = 4 : 1 : 4 : 1 . the size of cr , cr , and cr is 3 nm , 1 nm , and 1 nm , respectively . the crystal is slightly distorted along the @ xmath19 axis . the result was obtained from an afm analysis of the crystal structure . figure [ fig5 ] ( right ) shows our experimental results . the incident light is @ xmath77 and opposite axes ( the electric field is in the @ xmath34 axis ) . the numerical calculation was done with the inverse dot - matrix method @ xcite the permittivities of gold and silver were calculated from and . and ; the permittivity of gold is now taken to be 0 . 5 . in the numerical calculation , the incident light was taken to be a plane wave , and spectra corresponding to @ xmath78 and r . ( [ r _ 1 ] ) were obtained , which is used to make the frequency measurements . the result is that the reflections ( lower solid line ) are exactly the same as the r ##s , but reflection ( upper solid line ) and absorption ( solid line ) spectra show a slight difference . the absorption is also along the opposite axis . the result is thatthe lines are parallel on each side and have equal numbers of electrons . however , the transmission spectra are the same for the wavenumber values @ xmath79 and @ xmath80 . the transmission spectra are shown in fig . [ fig5 ] ( a ) and are consistent with the structure . it is easily observed both physically and theoretically . we perform a few experiments on reciprocal transmission ( see references in ref . ) . in accordance with these experiments , fig . [ fig5 ] ( a ) shows the best example of reciprocal transmission and is the best known experimental evidence of this . we conclude that the spectra in fig . [ fig5 ] ( a ) and [ fig5 ] ( c ) are consistent at 700 nm . on the other hand , they show a slight difference at 700 nm . the difference could result from the difference between the measured profile in fig . [ fig5 ] ( a ) and the observed profile of the material . the difference at 660 nm results from a weak plasmon at the metal - semiconductor interface , so that the observed transmission spectrum would be affected only by the surface tension and the deviation from the measured profile . as shown in fig . [2 ] , the reciprocal theorem states that all systems are nonlinear and have linear behavior . however , it may be that the reciprocal optical responses do not hold for linear , nonlocally coupled media . it is an important property of the solution for the reciprocal theorem in the nonlinear ##ized system of knbo @ xmath81 : 1 . the values of the coefficients differ by a few tens of degrees in the reciprocal theorem . the system has a second - order solution for that @ xmath82 . the breaking down of terms follows from the nonlinearity . does it also break down for nonlocal media ? for nonlocal media the d * d * is given by @ xmath83 . although a general solution for this problem has not been submitted to our research , it has been shown that it holds for a certain general - class of nonlocal media . @ xcite in particular , we have given an elegant and simple description of the reciprocal optical responses for reflection and reflection . when the reciprocal theorem of f . ( [ reci ] ) holds , the following solutions come from the analysis of the source and reflection points , and are independent of theanalysis of the results . the theory has been proven both theoretically and theoretically . we thank s . g . tikhodeev for this . one of us ( s . a . ) thanks the japanese institute for opto - optics and electronics for their support , and the optical research center , tohoku , for their support of the theoretical calculations .
