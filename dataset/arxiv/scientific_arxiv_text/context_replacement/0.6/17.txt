excitons in general have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies of quantum gases . high - energy exciton - exciton scattering are described by the exciton - exciton scattering length , @ xmath5 , which describes the behavior of a low temperature gas and is useful for calculating the thermalization temperature of a typical exciton gas . despite its name , the exciton - exciton scattering length is an uncertain quantity , and difficult to measure physically or to calculate theoretically . as is well - known in particle physics , scattering lengths can be very sensitive to the nature of the interaction between particles . in particular , the choice of a strongly bound or weakly bound state requires the particle size to be very large . therefore , _ a priori _ we should assume that exciton - exciton scattering may be a very important specific property of matter . accurate theoretical calculations of exciton - exciton scattering will require both a highly accurate hamiltonian for the system , and an exact solution to the ( single - electron ) scattering problem . in this case we propose an almost exact solution to exciton - exciton scattering for the commonly used narrow - anglethe scattering hamiltonian . this model allows us to answer three important questions : ( 1 ) how proportional is the scattering length to the mass , @ xmath6 , ( 2 ) how does the scattering length depend on spin states ( single or double ) of the individual excitons , and ( 3 ) to what extent the electron - exciton interaction of electrons and holes causes excitons to decay into higher spin states ? this model can serve as a basis for the # ##t formulation of more general scattering hamiltonians . an alternative method for determining the exciton scattering cross section is to look at line width ##s of the scattering length of a pair of excitons . interactions between excitons alter the line width , causing the line width to depend on the exciton - exciton interaction length , @ xmath7 , where @ xmath8 is the density and @ xmath9 is the average exciton velocity . the cross section from the line width means that ( 1 ) the density and velocity values are known , and ( 2 ) effective wavelength is the same length . as discussed above , @ xmath10 is a useful tool for comparison to the materials discussed in this article. et al . _ @ xcite ##s run our simulations on @ xmath10 and have found a piece of work that gives an upper bound of @ xmath11 for the total energy . although our simulations do not exactly fit @ xmath10 , we can apply our results to this model . most solutions to this problem start with the critical mass model , in which the system under study consists of two electrons , labeled @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , and two holes , labeled @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 . the hamiltonian is @ xmath16 where @ xmath17 . the hamiltonian has symmetry under exchange of electrons and exchange of holes , whose eigenstates can be described by two different quantum numbers . the s - wave functions are invariant under exchange of excitons ; a condition which is satisfied by labeled @ xmath18 and @ xmath19 , where the @ xmath20 numbers correspond to ( weak ) coupling under exchange of electrons and holes , respectively . although this hamiltonian is a well - suited model for exciton - exciton interactions , we should point out a few of its limitations . for large excitons , such asthose like @ xmath10 , that have energies not much higher than the potential energy , non - linear corrections for the potential energy and linear corrections to the kinetic energy can be used . for some metals , such as si and al , the transition band is a mixture of multiple bands and can only be described by a single spin term . in the case of @ xmath10 , the transition band has the same spin - 1 , ##ter ##nary , and there are multiple bands . interband exchange ( or electron - electron exchange ) is another scattering phenomenon that has been studied , and could be described by an equivalent spin - 1 spin model . this hamiltonian also describes a number of scattering phenomena for transition metals , including hydrogen - hydrogen , positronium - positronium , and muonium - muonium scattering . the effective scattering limit is at low energy ( positronium energy ) , where the bose - hall model is the most accurate . there have been published theoretical models of exciton - exciton scattering for classical wells @ xcite and quantum wells @ xcite as well as estimates of biexciton - biexciton scattering , @ xcite .the theoretical , elastic scattering results @ xcite are closely related to the results of this approach , and the techniques presented here could be applied to the elastic scattering problem . therefore , the techniques presented here provide a basis for applying the techniques presented in other theoretical approaches , and could give insight into the validity of the method in more complex situations . the other theoretical approach is called scattering theory , as described in the papers of keldysh and kolsov @ xcite and haug and hanamura . @ xcite they modeled the exciton - exciton scattering problem as observed from a single particle , @ xmath21 , where @ xmath22 is the sum of the noninteracting excitons with where @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 is the electron - exciton recoil energy . this approximation is an approximation of @ xmath26 ( because of the electron distribution ) , where @ xmath27 is the exciton recoil , but it is an approximate approximation which does have some limitations in the high energy limit . a major limitation of the approach is that it does not allow calculations of the biexciton interactionthe method . as we see above , biexciton bound states have a dependence of the free energy on the energy of @ xmath6 , which is not predicted by the first quantum field theory . a more efficient method was developed by elkomoss and munchy , @ xcite and has high energy exciton - exciton states given by @ xmath28 , where @ xmath29 is the wavefunction for the free excitons at distance @ xmath30 , . the energy of @ xmath31 follows from the hartree equation and is used for a two - dimensional constant - mass system . while the exciton - exciton - l - method would be a very useful method , this particular method has some significant problems . among the problems are a lack of symmetry , a van der waals effect , a inability to detect biexciton states , and a low energy potential for @ xmath32 . the cross sections obtained by this method are complex and out of step with the results of the previous method . further insight into exciton - exciton scattering can be obtained by studying the free particles , biexcitons . since the discovery offor example , @ xmath33 , going into the phase space of low energy , @ xmath34 , it is possible that this new theoretical approach for low energy states is to directly estimate biexciton binding energy . @ xcite for the bulk case , ( and even better , for mass ) the biexcitons will only exist in the @ xmath19 states , so biexcitons in the @ xmath35 states will have @ xmath18 wavefunctions . a detailed description of biexcitons can be found in ref . the low energy state was found to be a massive biexciton by hyllerass and bell . a variational treatment , @ xcite and a second variational estimate of the binding energy was done by brinkman , smith and bell , @ xcite which found @ xmath36 , where @ xmath37 is the exciton binding energy . however , because of the lack of _ ##s , the second variational estimate of the _ # _ of the biexciton binding energy , as obtained by quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) method , @ xcite which found @ xmath38 . dmc is a quantum monte carlo (qmc ) , that uses a random walk to sort out the ground state wavefunction from the variational wavefunction , in order to directly determine the exact ground - state . the use of dmc for measuring biexciton scattering has been a pioneer for its use in the quantum scattering problems . the @ xmath30 - based approach to scattering attempts to determine the standing waves of the particles . as described by carlson , pandharipande , and wiringa @ xcite and alhassid and koonin , @ xcite is denoted r as the standing wave the scattering problem can be treated as a standing wave , as for qmc ) . for an ideal scattering problem , we calculate the difference between the mass by @ xmath30 , and the total mass of the particles by @ xmath39 . for exciton - exciton scattering there is some ambiguity in the definition of scattering due to electron - exciton scattering , which we will consider later in our discussion of the exciton - exciton scattering wavefunctions . however , for the n @ xmath30 , the free space of the particles is free - space ##like , and the many - body wavefunctionwrite : @ xmath30 , @ xmath40 , \ end { asymptoticform } \ ] ] where @ xmath41 is the total angular momentum , @ xmath42 is the total energy , and @ xmath43 is the phase shift . if we take the wavefunction to be the minimum for a given exciton , @ xmath44 , we get the minimum energy , @ xmath45 , which can be calculated using ground state or excited state methods , such as dmc . the value of @ xmath44 gives a set of states @ xmath46 , with values @ xmath47 that have values of @ xmath43 , @ xmath48 where @ xmath49 . the density of states is given by the phase shift , @ xmath50 - 1 . \ ] ] carlson has also proposed calculating the time evolution of the wavefunction at the boundary . of the wavefunction to zero , @ xcite @ xmath51 where @ xmath52 is the distance to the boundary surface , at a given point @ xmath53 , and @ xmath54 parameterizes the boundary surface .this method has the advantage of determining the type of state , @ xmath53 ( due to @ xmath53 being in the same region ) , from the number of states , which is done by computing @ xmath54 , and is therefore better suited for computing the path integral . the approach to vmc calculations is feed - forward , and satisfying the boundary conditions for dmc calculations requires the use of computers . @ xcite the methods described above do not satisfy the time - dependent boundary conditions . the use of excited states @ xmath55 is useful when there is no boundary , and , more generally , when the quantum system being simulated reaches its best approximation before the critical point is reached . we use the qmc method to use excited states developed by ceperley and bernu , @ xcite to perform vmc and dmc calculations for the hilbert space of very high order wavefunctions . a family of @ xmath56 ##d wavefunctions is called , @ xmath57 . the first wave equation to be solved is , @ xcite @ xmath58d _ { t \ right } ( t ) = 0 , \ left { t :} } \ ] ] where @ xmath59 is the @ xmath60 eigenvector with parameters @ xmath61 and the matrices @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 are the basis and hamiltonian matrices of our trial basis , and by @ xmath64 the matrix @ xmath65 is the correlation function . the matrices @ xmath61 are the functions @ xmath66 of the state space given by the corresponding trial basis @ xmath67 , and are the free correlation functions in the neighborhood of 1 @ xmath65 . the matrices @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 are calculated with random walks , with a guiding function @ xmath68 which must be known beforehand . the guiding function must have a correlation with the correlation function , and should be used to minimize the size of the whole system . at each point @ xmath69 of the random walk , the matrices @ xmath70 of the system are calculated as @ xmath71 where @ xmath72 is a normally distributed random walk with a mean and a, and @ xmath73 is the first step . in the case of sampling @ xmath73 , , . ( [ _ _ _ _ _ ] ) is the method for sampling @ xmath74 . the matrix form of @ xmath75 is obtained by integrating the local energy of the trial state , @ xmath76 , with the wave vector , @ xmath77 } . \ ] ] the methods for sampling @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 are @ xmath78 where @ xmath79 and @ xmath80 are the local energies of the trial states , . , and the exciton - exciton interface . the matrix forms of the @ xmath81 - wave function configurations are symmetric ( @ xmath18 ) and antisymmetric ( @ xmath19 ) versions of these equations . this symmetric / antisymmetric form is obtained for the experimental wavefunctions @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 , and @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 from above . ( [ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ ( ] ) . ] we will consider the parameters for the exciton exchange functions @ xmath86 and @ xmath87 . as mentioned above , electron - exciton exchange of electrons is the result of exciton - exciton interactions . there are two configurations for inter - atomic excitons , as shown in fig . [ configfig ] . configuration i has the electron and hole pairs , @ xmath88 , @ xmath89 ; and configuration ii has @ xmath90 , @ xmath91 . we take wavefunctions @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 to represent these pairs , @ xmath94 where @ xmath95 , and those for the pair @ xmath96 are variational . these wavefunctions represent the excitons in their initial ground - state state . since these are the eigenstates of the exchange function for electrons @ xmath97 and hole , @ xmath98 , we consider the values of the parameters for our two wavefunctions , @ xmath99 and @ xmath100 . forfor numbers of excitons , the overlap ##s prevent the nodes from directly contributing to the wavefunction . however , a solution can be found for the full wavefunction by simply assuming that @ xmath101 is present for all @ xmath102 . the error caused by this method is of 1 @ xmath103 , and is a limit to the accuracy of the method for @ xmath44 . since we cannot do this for high energy states , like @ xmath44 , the lack of a well - defined exciton - exciton correlation function for large distances does not matter . of the dmc states related to the vmc states as a result of dmc calculations : @ xmath65 , for all of @ xmath104 . the energy of is given by : . ( [ e : overlap ] ) ( [ e : hmat ] ) , where the hamiltonian and overlap ##s have been calculated as : . ( [ e : overlapest ] ) and ( [ e : hmatest ] ) . ] this method for the scattering method is very similar to the scattering method @ xmath105 . to .in ##ly , we do not need to design and compute the variational wavefunctions , but instead use dmc to calculate the energy from the wavefunctions of the energy states by and . ( [ [ _ x _ x _ x _ ] ] ) . the coefficients @ xmath106 , @ xmath107 , @ xmath108 , and @ xmath109 are chosen to approximate the # ##s of the wavefunction for small energy levels . the half - wave envelope functions @ xmath101 are chosen as approximation to the observed exciton - exciton interaction , , @ xmath110 where @ xmath111 and @ xmath112 have been self - - calculated to approximate the energy levels of the two observed excited states . we use the envelope functions @ xmath68 to approximate the same energy as the @ xmath82 wavefunctions with @ xmath113 ^ { 1 / 2 } $ ] . the coefficients @ xmath114 are chosen to approximate energy towards the origin : @ xmath115 for @ xmath18 ##5 and @ xmath##116 for @ xmath19 states to check for stability of the system in dmc , we consider the energy curve , @ xmath117 , as a function of projection time in fig . [ evstfig ] . we have , with the projection time of , @ xmath118 . , for ( a ) symmetric @ xmath18 states , and ( b ) antisymmetric @ xmath19 states , with @ xmath119 . the corresponding spin state , ( c ) is the biexciton with the spin @ xmath120 . these states @ xmath121 are the values of @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 , with the notation [ fig . ( [ kfrome ] ) . ] we also have the corresponding spectra for each state of @ xmath44 , as seen in fig . [ evsrnfig ] ( a ) and [ evsrnfig ] ( b ) . the spectrum for the symmetric state @ xmath18 , is a lower spin biexciton state , as seen in fig . [ evsrnfig ] ( c ) . the antisymmetric states @xmath19 , as shown in fig . [ evsrnfig ] ( 2 ) , has no bound state . the binding energy of the biexciton is @ xmath124 , in accordance with the bound state calculations , and is related to the energy of the node @ xmath125 because it is bound . in general , the two binding energies are very similar to @ xmath125 , and their dependence on @ xmath125 is a function of the different numbers of electrons . for the two @ xmath35 - 1 spin states , for @ xmath119 , see [ fig . ( [ kfrome ] ) and the coefficients from fig . [ evsrnfig ] . ] . solutions for polynomomial corrections to the binding energy are of the following transition states for the node @ xmath119 . [ b = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , c = " ^ " , ] [ scattab ] the positions of two excitons with differently defined initial and final spin states can be calculated by splitting the collision state into the spin states , @ xmath126 and @xmath127 . from the equation of state table ( table [ spbasistab ] ) , we have @ xmath128 , where the coefficients @ xmath129 and @ xmath130 for the non - linear s - wave scattering processes are given in table [ scattab ] . the s - wave scattering cross sections are given by @ xmath131 , where r is a factor of one , due to the linear scattering processes . the spin - spin cross sections take the form , @ xmath132 , \ begin { 1 : 1 } \ begin { [ } \ ] ] where @ xmath133 , @ xmath134 , and @ xmath135 depend on the initial and final spin , and are given in table [ scattab ] . the pulse coefficients @ xmath5 are given by @ xmath136 , where the values of the phase factors are derived from the phase equations ( table [ phasecoeftab ] . ) , for exciton - exciton interactions with @ xmath119 , for the following : ( 1 ) a - pair @ xmath137 b - pair, ( b ) spin - pair @ xmath137 spin - pair for total spin @ xmath138 ( solid line ) and @ xmath139 ( solid line ) , ( c ) spin - pair @ xmath137 spin - pair with @ xmath140 , and ( d ) spin - pair @ xmath137 spin - pair and spin - pair @ xmath137 spin - pair , respectively with @ xmath140 . ] the corresponding spin - dependent bond energies for the case @ xmath119 are given in the first part of the [ scattab ] . these are the bond - energies and the cross - sections shown in fig . [ cs1fig ] . in fig . [ cs1fig ] we have calculated the spin - n bond cross section versus angular momentum for the case @ xmath119 and the non - total spin case . fig . [ cs1fig ] ( a ) the scattering of two spin - excitons . scattering of two spin - excitons as shown in fig . [ cs1fig ] ( b ), where the solid line represents the spin bound @ xmath141 state , and the liquid line represents the @ xmath142 state . the @ xmath142 state works very well because it has a large contribution from the @ xmath143 channel , which is dominated by the spin bound biexciton . p - excitons in the relative @ xmath144 state are also antisymmetric and therefore have strong s - wave scattering . we see s - wave scattering of p - excitons from p - excitons in fig . [ cs1fig ] ( 2 ) . this state has no bound excitons , and can decay by both s - wave and p - wave scattering . as can be seen in fig [ scattab ] , the main contribution to the cross section comes from the relative @ xmath145 channel . the contribution for s - wave scattering is very strong because one half the scattering factor is positive ( p - wave ) , and there is an additional contribution of one - half which is the total scattering factor . there is also a pair - to pair - exciton scattering cross section shown in fig .[ cs1fig ] ( 2008 ) . although this is an effective approximation in physical terms , it loses energy compared to our theoretical hamiltonian because we do not have an effective interband quantum channel . the conversion of two pair - excitons to two pair - excitons can be viewed as an electron - exciton scattering of a pair of electrons ( or holes ) . since the masses of the pair excitons do not correspond to those of the hamiltonian , they do not remain constant during scattering . this scattering effect is a direct consequence of the two inequivalent quantum dots @ xmath143 and @ xmath145 . this effect has been studied in experimental @ xcite and theoretical @ xcite based on exciton scattering by quantum dots . and @ xmath146 is a function of the electron - hole mass ratio . the effect of @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 is due to the presence of higher order biexciton interactions . these solutions are a blur to the effect . ] the effect of the cross section on energy can be further determined by our theory . in ref . [ avmfig ] we use our theoretical@ xmath147 and @ xmath146 as a function of mass ratio , @ xmath149 . we found that the scattering length is very close to the mass ratio for @ xmath150 ( due to a wide range of energies ) , but it appears near @ xmath151 . this effect was ignored in the early theoretical study of exciton - exciton interactions . the difference between @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 is due to the presence of a biexciton excited state . for @ xmath119 the biexciton has three bound excited states , but the @ xmath152 curve has two bound excited states . our calculations have shown the first of these appears near @ xmath148 , with no dependence on the scattering length . the @ xmath146 curve is almost flat because there are virtually no bound antisymmetric states on this curve . we interpreted the negative slope of @ xmath146 for large mass ratios as a rounding error due to errors in projection time for excitonic interactions with very large electron and proton states . the second curve has the projection time @xmath153 of the light source is the next quantum state @ xmath73 . the difficulty of achieving large length scales makes the models ( as described here ) similar to those that use the born - oppenheimer equation . it is important to note that many relationships also hold for the interaction energy and other physical properties , such as the luttinger - kohn effect , the excited state , gauge fields , and spin - orbit coupling , to name a few . theoretical models of these phenomena still require very high - order scattering mechanisms , when compared to more complex hamiltonians , and are an obstacle for practical calculations . to date , we have shown that there are many different possible scattering mechanisms for excitons , and have obtained the correct formula for the currently accepted standard model . we have compared spin - orbit and spin - electron scattering , with both spin - spin scattering and spin - orbit to spin - orbit coupling mechanisms . this is very close to the mass ratio for @ xmath154 , but not as high and also differs from @ xmath155 . dmc has been used as a theoretical basis for this two - dimensional excited state model , since the detectionof these interacting states is an exact description of the correlation energy . this general approach should be useful in many applications . the application to high - energy scattering would yield better results for higher interaction energies . applications to biexciton - biexciton interaction are possible , but would be a lot more difficult because the interaction wavefunction would also need to describe the interacting states . most importantly , the approach should be extended to arbitrary hamiltonians so that the relationship of the correlation energy to physical properties for a wide range of materials can be understood . this approach should be especially suitable for quantum mechanical problems , which have similarities to the scattering problems described above , but have very different physical properties that can explain exciton - exciton interactions . we would like to contact t . ohara and m . carlson for more information . this project is supported by research grant no . dmr ##1 - 02373 , research grants from ncsa , and the department of physics at the university of illinois urbana - champaign . for example , the study of the interaction length dependence of @ xmath156 , described earlier in this article , is very important to the exact description of correlation energy , since it relies on the existence of a single , strongly interacting biexcitonstate of that time period .
