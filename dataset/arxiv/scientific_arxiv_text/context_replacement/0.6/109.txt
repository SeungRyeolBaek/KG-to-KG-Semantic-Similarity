infrared spectroscopy is a key tool in the study of galactic dust components . _ infrared spectroscopy performed by the _ infrared observatory of hawaii _ ( _ irts _ ; * ? ? ? * ) and the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iso _ ; * ? ? ? * ) _ discovered many new spectral lines in the diffuse emission , indicating the presence of new dust components in the galactic plane @ xcite . observations at _ iso _ _ clearly indicate the presence of new materials in young and old stars for the first time @ xcite , although it is not yet known whether these materials occur exclusively in the dust . in the following article we describe the discovery of two star - forming regions , the orion nebula and the sharpless 171 ( s171 ) , with the long - baseline spectroscopy ( lws ; * ? ? ? * ) at _ _ iso _ and the discovery of near - infrared peaks of 60 @ xmath0 m and 70 @ xmath0 m in the diffuse emission . the orion nebula is one of the most massive regions in the galactic plane and appears to contain a number of g - type stars @ xcite . the s171 region is a closed cluster and super - massive @xcite . these regions are thought to have the origins of other regions of the universe . the origins of the two astronomical objects are discussed and we consider the possibility that the ##aceous grains of the graphitic nebula are the source for the infrared dark matter @ xmath0 m emission . the infrared @ xmath1 region of the crab nebula was observed by two - dimensional ct scan with the lws high resolution observing mode and the near - infrared spectra for 43197 @ xmath0 m were obtained for 132 positions ( for details of the analysis , see * ? ? ? ) three - dimensional scan was obtained for 132 positions along the line from the heating source to the molecular cloud region of s171 with the same lws observing mode @ xcite . the outer surface of the two galaxies contains dark matter and molecular clouds and the spectra show the infrared emission from the surrounding medium rather than the emission from star - forming objects . the on - line spectral analysis of version 10 . 1 ( olp 10 . 1 ) provided by the iso spectral analysis program was used in the original study . the spectra were defringed , integrated into the observed data , and the heating source analysis was performed by the iso spectral analysis program ( isap) data . the channel geometry and the correction algorithms are derived from the published lws ( @ xcite . there are gaps in the signal of the detector channels , which can be due to the differences either in the responsivity , in the dark current , or in the spatial brightness distribution of the atmosphere . figure [ fig1 ] shows each of the two combined sizes of the detector channels , while figure [ fig2 ] shows their combined ability to correct the gaps . the channels were obtained in the transition region between the dust cloud and the gas , where the near - field frequency is too high to detect dust particles . the resulting spectra were obtained by combining each channel , because the detector channels are small enough that the differences in the dark current should be less significant than those in the responsivity and in the spatial brightness distribution . as can be seen in figure [ fig1 ] , the size of the channels is constant ( @ xmath2 100 % ) except for the two largest channels ( @ xmath3 @ xmath0 m ) , where 1020 % accuracy is required to correct the gaps . the presence of a very large dust cloud at the @ xmath0 frequency is observed only in the unstitched ., as in s171 . in the spectrum of the orion nebula , the distribution of this feature is slightly different at the lower levels of the upper channel , ( sw2 and sw4 ) compared to the level of the sw3 channel , but it can still be seen in the lower channels of the sw3 channel . a sharp peak starting at 100 @ xmath0 m is also seen in the unstitched spectrum of s171 . the surface of the star appears to become smooth at the boundary between the sw4 and sw5 channels , with a peak starting at 100 @ xmath0 m . in the unstitched spectrum of the orion nebula , the boundary between the sw4 and sw5 channels makes the feature less visible , but the difference in the level of the sw5 channel can still be seen . the observed spectrum clearly indicates the presence of the feature . however there is no such a change in the spectrum at shorter wavelengths and the relative wavelength range of the feature is difficult to determine from these spectra . neither the observations have been made nor the observed frequency difference would indicate the actual change in these spectral lines @ xcite . we must consider several other factors to indicate the presence of the feature andsee the peak intensity in the figure . these features are seen at about one third of the observed wavelengths , in the ob and s171 regions . since these features are seen over a large part of the galactic plane , the ir ##ing can be high even in free space . @ xcite shows the presence of 65 @ xmath0 m and 63 @ xmath0 m features in the spectrum of evolved stars . figure [ fig3 ] a shows a photograph of ngc6302 taken from the iso ##n ##d diagram for galaxies ( cf . * ? ? ? the above ) with a much higher intensity than those in figure [ fig2 ] and the features are strongly interacting with the bright side . to see the features more clearly , the intensity is multiplied by the square of the wavelength ( @ xmath4 ) and shown in figure [ fig3 ] b . the observed 65 @ xmath0 m feature is very similar to that seen in evolved stars . the wavelength of the 65 @ xmath0 m feature is also much higher than [ ] 63 @ xmath0 m feature ( cf . [ fig4 ] ; see also cf . [ fig6 ] ) and it is strongly associated with the cold galactic zone . the@ xmath0 m @ xcite . @ xcite has suggested a carbon - rich black solid , diopside ( camgsi @ xmath5o @ xmath6 ) , as a possible source of the 65 @ xmath0 m line in these spectra . further measurements of the physical properties of diopside confirm the 65 @ xcite . figure [ fig4 ] shows a comparison of the laboratory case with the experimental spectra . the well known spectra described in this article are then compared . the laboratory case has a wider range than those , and other sources , such as sea ##water and methane ( camg ( co @ xmath7 ) @ xmath5 ) , have been shown to contribute strongly to the 65 @ xmath0 m line . @ xcite . diopside has a strong feature detected at 45 . 5 @ xmath0 m . the lws spectrum in this frequency range ( sw1 ) is less sensitive and appears to have weak features . in the laboratory case the line emission is observed at 65 @ xmath0 m , with the upward and downward direction of the peaks , indicating the presence of the 65 @ xmath0ii spectra . the large differences in this spectral type prevent the direct detection and further observations are needed to confirm the results . strong features of other rare elements , such as the 700 @ xmath0 m feature of forsterite found in ngc6302 , are also present in the corresponding lws spectra . diopside also shows strong features in 3040 @ xmath0 m . the crab star was observed by short - baseline spectroscopy ( sl ; * ? ? ? * ) and the spectra of 2 . 345 @ xmath0 m have been obtained . however the sl spectra are not located in the same location as the lws spectra and therefore the direct detection is impossible . the sl spectra are dominated by a nebula and do not yet show any distinct structure except for the rare 65 @ xmath0 m and @ xcite . if the association of the star 65 @ xmath0 m with diopside is correct , this is the first appearance of this rare element in the outer galactic medium . the formation of dust particles by electric fields means that a large number of dust particles must have formed in the medium in addition to those formed from 65 @ xcite . diops##ide is a high - temperature material and can withstand extreme conditions . calcium is a less abundant element than iron and nickel , but it is significantly present in the gas phase of the background medium @ xcite . so the presence of calcium - containing elements should not be detected in this medium . based on the observed # ##ing of diopside @ xcite and the mass spectrum corresponding to the continuum , we can estimate that 510 % of the system material , diopside , is enough to account for the entire continuum , if we use the commonly used standard extinction coefficient of 100 @ xmath8g @ xmath9 for the continuum , or 100 @ xmath0 m @ xcite . @ xcite we estimated that the crystallinity of the continuum is less than 50 % in the background medium based on the presence of protostars . since the feature profile at 100 @ xmath0 m is very large and complex , we consider many possibilities for the baseline temperature to explain the existence of the underlying 100 @ xmath0 m continuum in general and to give a rough estimate of the 100 @ xmath0 m feature temperature . in the case of the continuum we estimate the feature temperature to be about 5560@ xmath0 m , 7080 @ xmath0 m , and 140190 @ xmath0 m , 120190 @ xmath0 m ( see below ) and we try to fit the observed spectra of these regions with the model , as closely as possible . because the larger wavelength range ( 5560 @ xmath0 m ) produces more flux , more weight is placed on this range of the model . we then compare the standard model with the power - law emissivity ( @ xmath10 , where @ xmath11 is a constant ) for the bragg line . we find that the two - component graybody model does not fit the observed spectra ##s â€² . thus the model only has a larger flux at longer wavelengths than the original spectra . this problem can only be solved by adding @ xmath11 because increasing the index would produce a smaller flux at shorter wavelengths . adding a third component with a higher flux increases the index further . the use of @ xmath12 models for hot and cold regions provides better fit , but produces a much larger flux at longer wavelengths ( @ xmath13 @ xmath0 m ) than the original2 . changing of @ xmath11 from small to a large value for the cold grain does not change the fit ratio . the power - law emissivity spectrum has a maximum value of @ xmath14 in the non - scattering limit . the difference in the values for the wavelengths arises from the fact that the longer wavelengths have a constantly changing power - law value . the frequency value of the lws ##m reflects the overall shape of the spectrum . as shown in figure [ fig1 ] the unstitched spectra have very low values at longer wavelengths ( @ xmath15 @ xmath0 m ) , reflecting the uncertainty associated with the spectrum in this frequency range . this also presents a difficulty in determining the assumed baseline for the longer wavelengths . in the figure we use two models for the spectrum ; one with 140190 @ xmath0 m ( case a ) and 120190 @ xmath0 m ( case b ) to determine the uncertainty of the assumed baseline and as a more general example we use the long spectrum and cold grain . @ xcite the quartz and diamond spectra also have both a power - law emissivity of @ xmath16in the near - infrared and this model has a higher accuracy than the power - law emissivity model of @ xmath17 . we show the results of the carbon - carbon model in the figure . we compute the mean temperatures for each of the two carbon and carbon regions and look for the best fit regions . the carbon regions all have different chemical compositions of different wavelengths , and therefore these temperatures are a good proxy for the atomic structure . in the [ fig2 ] the best fit regions are shown along with the observed spectra . the dashed lines indicate the values for the case a baseline , which matches the observed spectra very well even in the longest wavelengths . they contrast strongly with the observed values for @ xmath18 @ xmath0 m in the figure . the dashed lines indicate those for the case b baseline , which have much higher values in longer wavelengths ( @ xmath13 @ xmath0 m ) than the observed spectra . these values also indicate the presence of an excess feature starting at 80 @ xmath0 m . the feature starting at 80 @ xmath0 m is significant and can only be accounted for by the graybodies . the distribution of the excess features between the two regions of theone of the latter and indicates the galactic center . @ xcite ##s attributed the 90 @ xmath0 m feature in evolved stars to calcium ( caco @ xmath7 ) , a calcium ion . in figure [ fig3 ] , we can use a high - mass graybody as a possible reference point . comparison with figure [ fig2 ] shows that the 90 @ xmath0 m feature in ngc6302 is larger than the observed 90 @ xmath0 m feature . the spectrum of ngc6302 shows a slight slope seen in 90 @ xmath0 m , which indicates the longer wavelength edge of the feature . in contrast , the observed features do not show the same difference in the spectrum and suggest that the feature has shifted to longer wavelengths than the 90 @ xmath0 m feature . the longer wavelength edge of the observed feature may not be well determined . although the observed spectral length and width of the feature depend on the observed wavelength and the length of the line , the observed 90 @ xmath0 m feature appears to be shifted to longer wavelengths and covers a larger area than the 90 @ xmath0 m feature seen in evolved stars . the quartz stars are a good candidate for thewhile @ xmath0 m occurs in bright stars and may also correspond to the broad 100 @ xmath0 m feature , we consider the case of organic molecules which have a narrow band of 90 @ xmath0 m for the electron density in the equatorial region . in the following we consider whether the carbon sphere consisting of layered curved graphitic sheets @ xcite may account for the very broad 100 @ xmath0 m feature or not . carbon is an optical material and has good optical properties in the direction of and perpendicular to the c - axis ( the c - axis is perpendicular to the graphitic plane ) . carbon has an interband of around 100 @ xmath0 m in the direction perpendicular to the c - axis @ xcite . the emission efficiency of carbon spheres can be estimated using the so - called approximation @ xcite , in which the properties in the direction and perpendicular to the c - axis are equal with the values of and , respectively . this approximation is valid in the small enough case if the sphere consists of curved graphitic sheets and the optical properties in both directions are equal . for the carbon sphere , the emission efficiency in the direction perpendicular to the c - axis is much .than that in the direction perpendicular to the axis in the near - infrared direction . thus the interband absorption as mentioned above is not visible in the emission efficiency @ xcite . for carbon onion , on the other hand , the graphitic layer is thin and thus lacks a band . thus the optical properties of the two cases should be mutually exclusive and the interband absorption should be reflected in the emission efficiency of the onion particle . example [ fig5 ] shows the emission efficiency , divided by the grain radius for a carbon onion and a carbon onion , under the assumption that the grain radius is much larger than the wavelength of infrared . only the optical properties of particles in the direction of and perpendicular to the z - axis at room temperature , are used in the calculation ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * see below for details ) . the feature for the carbon onion was derived from the calculations of henrard et al . ( 1993 ) and is assumed to have a surface area of 0 . 5 and diameter proportional to the grain radius . the size of the area is proportional to the size of the grain . a similar feature for the @ xmath0 feature is present in the emission efficiency of the carbon sphere in the direction ofto the z - band , but this is not evident in the absorption coefficient . on the other hand , the near - infrared absorption is evident in the emission spectrum of carbon onion grains . see [ fig6 ] for a comparison of the emission spectrum with that of carbon onion grains . to make the comparison , the emission spectra are divided by the assumed continuum , and the length of the carbon onion is divided by @ xmath19 . the numbers in the first two lines indicate the length of the assumed continuum . carbon onion grains show a similar absorption feature to that seen in the # ##d medium , but parts of the structure do not match up . on account of the similarity between the shape of the band structure and the optical properties of carbon onions ( see figure ) , the shape of the band structure suggests that carbon onions are a possible source of the observed 100 @ xmath0 m feature . the 100 @ xmath0 m feature of carbon onions results from the direct absorption of charged particles @ xcite and is below the point where the upper limit of the absorption coefficient in the z band suddenly becomes almost zero . the actual size and shape of the structure also depends on the observed lattice constant . thus the band structure of carbon onionshaving been shown to not differ much from that of the @ xcite , the contribution of free electrons , which occur in the far - infrared spectrum , may be reduced . in fact , calculations of electron band shift and high spatial - resolution measurements show that @ xmath20 electrons in carbon onions are more abundant in the region @ xcite . the addition of @ xmath20 electrons may reduce the contribution of free electrons , causing the absorption coefficient to be greater than 100 @ xmath0 m . we estimate that the shift should be greater than 100 @ xmath0 m . however it is difficult to determine the full magnitude of the shift because the contribution of free electrons depends mainly on the temperature and the strength of the interband transition . carbon onions could also be affected by the shift . the @ xmath20 band shift , the temperature change , and the corresponding change in the interband transition strength should affect the optical properties of carbon onions in the far - infrared . the figure shown in the [ fig6 ] may be just a match in this case . the same figure shows that the same optical properties can be accounted for if carbon onions can contribute to 2030 % of the far - infrared spectrum . carbon is an unstable element ,however the actual presence of carbon onions in the optical medium is not yet known ( e . g . * ? ? ? carbon onions is a carbon compound other than graphite and carbon ) in contrast to other organic compounds and organic compounds whose existence has been confirmed by the broad absorption spectrum of the near infrared star @ xcite . carbon onions have recently gained acceptance as a stable form of carbon , following the discovery of fullerens and their derivatives . in addition , they are known to have formed by chemical reactions @ xcite and the atmospheric conditions accompanying intense dust storms are responsible for the formation of onions @ xcite . they have been suggested as a possible candidate for the nearby 220 nm giant star @ xcite . the carbon onion cloud ( qcc ) , which has a structure similar to the nearby 220 nm hump @ xcite , has also been shown to have graphitic shell features @ xcite . it is not clear that the shell features of carbon onions , if present , could occur in the visible spectrum . in the same paper we also discussed the possibility that the interband features of particles in the near - infrared could appear in the emissivity features of particles made of carbon graphitic , and the emission bandsthe emission at 65 @ xmath0 m can be accounted for by carbon onion grains . further information is still needed for further verification . in the same paper we report the detection of two near - infrared bands , 65 @ xmath0 m and 100 @ xmath0 m in the near infrared emission . the 65 @ xmath0 m feature can also be attributed to the non - crystalline silicon , diopside . if this identification is correct , this is the first appearance of a crystalline silicon star in the near infrared emission . the observed 65 @ xmath0 m feature appears to be uniform and visible at longer wavelengths than the absorption bands found in other stars although the best understanding of the spectral type is unknown . as a possible dust source we consider the possibility that the feature comes from carbon onion grains . while the latter feature may be accounted for by carbon onion grains if the observed optical properties are different , the structure of the feature is similar to the crystal structure of carbon onion . the existence of the observed 65 @ xmath0 m feature can be confirmed by further experimental work . the authors are t . kawara , t . satoh , t . tanab , t . okuda , t .tsuji , s . shibai , and other members of the japanese iso community for their continued support and encouragement . we also thank s . tomita and s . hayashi for their work on the optical properties of green , and h . chihara and c . koike for showing us the far -
