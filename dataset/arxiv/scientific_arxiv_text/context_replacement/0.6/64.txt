we describe the methods to find solutions of _ non - homogeneous _ double - - heun equations that have monodromy eigenfunctions . our work is motivated by applications to nonlinear equations modeling the josephson effect and others . the above results , their definitions and applications ( see [ q ] and [ q = 1 ] ) are stated in section 1 . 1 . applications to monodromy eigenfunctions and solutions of homogeneous double - heun equations and to nonlinear equations modeling josephson effect are stated in section 2 . 2 , sections 3 and 4 . the eigenfunction is the product of a monomial @ xmath13 and a function @ xmath14 holomorphic ##ally @ xmath15 . the heun equation is related to the relations in the laurent series of the function @ xmath16 . the verification of the above - mentioned results is based on finding the corresponding functional relations . we show existence and application of [ q ] for the case of a more general class of these relations ( stated in section 2 . 2 and discussed in section 5 ) . .it is based on results from nonlinear equations and the fixed point method for a linear system . we study the class of linear - heun functions @ xmath17 @ xmath18 our goal is to identify each of the eigenfunctions with a constant factor @ xmath19 , @ xmath5 : solution of the equation @ xmath20 to do this , we study the non - singular functions of , @ xmath21 one of our main results is the following : [ singular ] for every @ xmath22 , @ xmath23 there are holomorphic functions @ xmath24 in a neighborhood of , , @ xmath25 such that the functions @ xmath26 are singular ( [ nonhom ] ) for every @ xmath27 , @ xmath28 . the functions @ xmath29 are defined up to constant factor ( depending on the parameters ) , and they are singular functions : holomorphic functions @ xmath30 . for every constant factor @ xmath31 the singular function @ xmath32 is uniquely defined up to inner product depending on parameters . the corresponding constant factor can be chosen such thatboth @ xmath29 and @ xmath33 behave holomorphically . @ xmath22 and @ xmath24 are real - valued functions @ xmath34 for all real x . [ xi ] = @ xmath22 . the corresponding function ( [ heun ] ) has a monodromy eigenfunction with parameters @ xmath19 , @ xmath5 , if and only if the two parameters @ xmath35 are zero : @ xmath36 and [ xi ] will be given in the next section and section 4 . the theorem will be proved in the next section . the explicit form for the functions @ xmath29 and @ xmath33 , together with the explicit form for the ( [ schivka ] ) will be given in section 3 . [ xi = 0 ] for both @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 there is a corresponding function @ xmath39 ( up to one parameter ) holomorphic in a factor of 2 such that @ xmath40 . the corresponding function @ xmath41 depends only on the parameter @ xmath42 . theorem [ xi = 0] can be found in the next section . theorem [ xi = 0 ] is closely related to the problem of the existence of a solution holomorphic at 0 of equation ( [ heun ] ) ( if a solution is not analytic , i . e . , holomorphic on @ xmath30 ) . this problem was studied by v . m . buchstaber and s . i . tertychnyi in @ xcite . the existence of a solution @ xmath43 from theorem [ xi = 0 ] and the solution for @ xmath43 and the corresponding equation @ xmath44 ( not in @ xmath38 ) were studied in @ xcite . the existence of such that if @ xmath45 , then the corresponding equation ( [ heun ] ) , i . e . , @ xmath0 has a solution holomorphic on @ xmath30 . a problem studied by v . m . buchstaber and s . i . tertychnyi in loc . cit . states that the following is true : if if @ xmath46 has a holomorphic solution at 0 , then @ xmath45 . this was provedand in loc . cit and @ xcite , where it was applied to a set of problems involving the solutions of the heun equations and the polynomial equations of the second kind . all these problems were solved in @ xcite . as the following table shows , theorem [ xi = 0 ] proved the theorem of buchstaber and tertychnyi independently , without solving any polynomial equations , nor any rational functions . [ cxi ] ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3 . 3 ) equation ( [ heun ] ) has an entire solution , if and only if @ xmath45 , where @ xmath44 is the solution from loc . cit . , studied in ( * ? ? ? * theorem ( 2 ) , p . 337 ) ; and the solution ( [ xil ] ) from theorem 3 . 3 . . if @ xmath45 . then the solution @ xmath43 from theorem [ xi = 0 ] is the entire solution of equation ( [ heun ] ) : @ xmath0 . then , let equation ( [ heun ] ) have a solution @ xmath43 holomorphic to x . if @ xmath47 , thenthere exists a holomorphic function @ xmath48 in a neighborhood of x satisfying the equation @ xmath49 , by definition [ xi = 0 ] . this contradiction with the previous statement of definition [ xi = 0 ] implies that @ xmath50 tends to # ##s , for @ xmath51 . the result thus also proves the theorem . equation ( [ heun ] ) is equivalent to the previous equation @ xmath52 which can be expressed in the following form @ xmath53 @ xmath54 [ remnoncom ] a function @ xmath55 satisfying equation ( [ nonhom ] ) for all @ xmath56 , if and only if its fourier coefficients @ xmath57 satisfy ( [ min ] ) , or equivalently , ( [ mat1 ] ) for @ xmath58 . similarly , a function @ xmath59 , @ xmath60 satisfying ( [ nonhom ] ) , if and only if its coefficients satisfy ( [ min ] ) for @ xmath61 . * of the [ min ] . * let @ xmath62 be a solution of equation ( [ non##un ] ) = solution ( [ multi ] ) . for @ xmath63 the functions @ xmath57 and ( [ un ] ) for all @ xmath64 . this together with the above statement implies that the functions @ xmath26 satisfy ( [ nonhom ] ) . the above statement @ xmath65 should stand out , since @ xmath43 is a solution of the above equation . this implies ( [ schivka ] ) . now , let @ xmath26 be one of ( [ nonhom ] ) , and let ( [ schivka ] ) satisfy . then we can divide the above equation by the ##s ( with the arguments ##s ) so that @ xmath66 . then the function @ xmath43 given by ( [ defef ] ) is a solution of ( ( [ heun ] ) . this is the proof . as it was stated above , the [ proof ] is given by the following example statement [ 1 ] : @ ##s @ xmath67 an ordinary function @ xmath57 , where the @ xmath68 given by @ xmath69 satisfy the following equation : @xmath70 @ xmath71 . this is a power sequence @ xmath72 with @ xmath57 satisfying ( [ rec ] ) for @ xmath73 and has no integer coefficients . this extends to powers of @ xmath30 . theorem [ rec ] will be stated in the next section . [ rec ] . the sequence @ xmath74 from theorem [ rec ] for every @ xmath75 the two neighbor coefficients @ xmath57 , @ xmath76 do not vanish either : so , they form a sequence @ xmath77 . every sequence of neighbor coefficients @ xmath78 is a power sequence satisfying ( [ rec ] ) . these results follow from the fact that for every @ xmath73 the sequence @ xmath79 is defined as a linear combination of @ xmath80 and @ xmath57 satisfying ( [ rec ] ) , since @ xmath81 . similarly , if the two neighbor coefficients @ xmath82 vanish , then all the remainder vanish , and the remainder is zero , by definition . [ conv ] for @ xmath83 , and for every@ xmath84 such that @ xmath85 for every @ xmath86 , @ xmath87 there exists and unique nonzero one - sided series @ xmath88 ( up to ##icative ##s ) converge outside some other disk centered at 0 that satisfy the relations ( [ mat ] ) ( or equivalently , ( [ mat1 ] ) ) for @ xmath89 . similarly , for every @ xmath84 such that @ xmath90 there exists and unique one - sided series @ xmath91 ( up to # # ) that satisfy the relations ( [ mat ] ) for @ xmath92 and converge outside some disk centered at 0 . both series converge inside the same other disk , @ xmath15 . [ exkko ] . by the statement of the [ conv ] one has @ xmath93 ( ex . ( [ defu ] ) ) . then both and hold for all @ xmath84 , since and ( [ kko ] ) hold for all @ xmath94 . therefore , if .@ xmath95 , let @ xmath96 , and the statement of example [ conv ] @ xmath97 @ xmath98 prove [ conv ] together with example [ remnoncom ] and the same statement of example [ exkko ] proves theorem [ xi ] . * of theorem [ conv ] and [ xi ] . * the statements @ xmath99 of the form ( [ xi ] ) satisfy the statement of theorem [ xi ] for @ xmath100 ( @ xmath92 ) . thus , the asymptotics ( [ condi ] ) are obtained . let @ xmath81 come from ( [ kko ] ) ( or , ( [ kko2 ] ) ) . this together with example [ xi ] proves theorem [ conv ] , and finally , theorem [ xi ] . * of theorem [ xi = x ] . * let @ xmath101 , @ xmath37 . . ( [ kko ] ) , for @ xmath102 . moreover , there is a power of @ xmath103 . .the orbit of the point , whose parameters are ( [ sum ] ) for @ xmath73 , and which corresponds to that of @ xmath30 ( theorem [ conv ] ) . the system of equations ( [ sum ] ) for @ xmath73 is equivalent to the system that @ xmath104 . this is theorem [ n = 1 ] . our results are supported by references to the system @ xmath105 of differential equations , which arise in many fields in physics , biology and chemistry : for the model of the josephson effect in physics ( our main application ) , see @ xcite ; for dynamics , see @ xcite . where @ xmath106 is the fixed point , and @ xmath107 are the parameters . for @ xmath108 the solution of @ xmath109 is ( [ josbeg ] ) to a non - linear partial differential equation in the n - dimensional @ xmath110 with solutions @ xmath111 : @ xmath112 the orbits of the points are the components of the vector fields @ xmath113 : @ xmath114 . the_ rotation number _ of _ space , denoted @ xcite , is a measure @ xmath115 of space . it is given by the formula @ xmath116 where @ xmath117 is an exact solution of equation ( [ jostor ] ) . the _ phase - lock areas _ are the _ coordinates of the rotation number of the @ xmath107 - domain with non - linear equations . they have been defined by v . m . buchstaber , v . i . ivanov , s . i . tertychnyi et al , in @ xcite and discussed below . the phase - lock area is an infinite number of _ coordinates separated by _ _ points _ . the definition of their values for families of linear functional equations was first introduced by v . m . bushstaber and s . i . tertychnyi in @ xcite and extended by the authors of the same article in @ xcite . later , the definition of non - linear equations was extended in @ xcite to include families of second order linear functional equations of the _ heun type : equation ( [ heun ] ) and the formula @ xmath11##8 the functional equation is obtained by writing equation ( [ heun ] ) in terms of the function @ xmath119 and solving it with @ xmath120 . in the example , when @ xmath121 , buchstaber and tertychnyi have shown that the solutions correspond exactly to those parameter values , for which equation ( [ heun ] ) has a non - polynomial holomorphic solution at infinity ( which is not an entire solution : holomorphic solution @ xmath30 ) ; see the proof in ( * ? ? ? * , theorem 2 ) and the proof in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3 . 3 and theorem 3 . 4 ) . they have also found a number of holomorphic solutions for equations like the ordinary functional equation @ xmath122 , # # [ cxi ] . they have shown that the ordinary functional equation contains the solutions exactly . they have reduced this conjecture to the one stating that if equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) has a polynomial solution , then equation ( [ heun ] ) does not have an entire solution . and they have reduced their original conjecture about the solution to the oneone is that the equations given by the rational functions of the second kind do not depend on the same semiaxis . the last one together with the first three were found in @ xcite . the above - mentioned work of buchstaber and tertychnyi on the equations and the solutions follows from equations [ cxi ] and their relations to the solutions of heun equation . j . a . buchstaber and a . a . tertychnyi have found solutions of pseudo - heun equation ( [ heun ] ) @ xcite . the symmetry @ xmath123 , which is an analogue of the dual ##ity , was found in @ xcite . it corresponds to the solution @ xmath124 of the dual equation ( [ josbeg ] ) ; the other symmetry was found in @ xcite . in @ xcite they have found the nontrivial solutions for the case , when @ xmath125 and _ ( [ heun2 * ] ) do not have integer coefficients . and in the case of _ and @ xmath126 ( and @ xmath127 ) of the rec##urrence ##s @ xmath128 we have a ( one - or two - sided ) sequence of real numbers @ xmath57 satisfying the equation for all @ xmath100 ( or , @ xmath92 ) . ( also we can consider two - sided infinite sequences . ) if in particular , the infinite sequence @ xmath74 belongs to an interval centered at 0 ( for all the sequences under consideration , this would also imply that for all of @ xmath15 ) , the exact sequence under consideration is @ _ _ _ _ _ : the word ` ` _ ' ' is used for convenience . in section 3 we give the explicit formula for solutions of the equation ( [ 0 ] ) and the results of equation [ 1 ] . then in section 4 we have the differential equations given by monodromy solutions of maxwell - heun equations ( the solutions of equation [ 2 ] ) . in section 5 we apply results of sections 3 and 4 to phase - space equations using the method of josephson equations . it is shown that the sum of the monodromy solutions of equations ( [ heun ] ) and @xmath129 and their product let @ xmath130 . this together with results of section 4 implies an ordinary differential equation given by non - zero periodic function of the complex numbers as a function of time ( see [ rhonon ] in section 5 . 1 ) . the description of boundaries of the phase - lock areas starts with the case where the monodromy has multiple ##s and is given by the fact that the monodromy of the ( [ heun ] ) has multiple @ xmath131 . this together with results of sections 3 , 4 implies an explicit description of the boundary ( see [ cboun ] in section 5 . 1 ) . new problems of phase - lock areas and new approaches to solution of them with the explicit description of boundaries are presented in sections 5 . 5 and 5 . 6 . the following explicit solutions can be easily found in section 5 with results of section 4 . [ poteig0 ] let @ xmath132 , @ xmath133 , @ xmath134 , @ xmath135 , @ xmath136 , @ xmath137 , @ xmath138 . thea single heun equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) corresponding to the points @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 and @ xmath120 has a polynomial solution , if and only if @ xmath139 , @ xmath140 and @ xmath141 , and in particular , the point @ xmath107 lies in the boundaries of the phase - lock area of @ xmath142 and is also their intersection . in other words , the points @ xmath143 corresponding to equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) with polynomial solutions lie in boundaries of phase - lock area and lie at their intersection , with the points @ xmath144 , @ xmath141 , except for the intersection . j . a . buchstaber and a . a . tertychnyi have proved using @ xcite that if the point @ xmath143 corresponding to equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) with a polynomial solution , then @ xmath120 , @ xmath142 are equal , @ xmath141 and @ xmath140 . for the boundary of@ xmath145 there is a small sequence @ xmath146 satisfying the condition ( [ rec ] ) , by setting [ rec ] . but in general , the sequence @ xmath147 cannot hold . we want to prove that it holds for some ` ` initial conditions . to do this , we use the following method : we take the sequence in the opposite direction , ` ` from 1 to 1 ' ' . that is , consider a sequence @ xmath64 and a small ` ` initial condition ' ' @ xmath148 . then the sequence holds for all @ xmath149 , @ xmath150 . it follows that the initial condition @ xmath145 we are looking for can be written as the sum of the initial conditions @ xmath151 , by the usual inverse construction ( or reduction ) , and @ xmath152 ; the only restriction of @ xmath153 is that the projectivization @ xmath154 = ( a _ k : a _ { k + 1 } ) \ to \ cp ^ [ $ ] should have a single , positive ` ` transition value ' ' ,which leads to the transformation @ xmath155 , as @ xmath152 . the projectivized solution of @ xmath156 = ( a _ { k } : a _ { k + 1 } ) \ mapsto [ a _ { k - 1 } ] = ( a _ { k - 1 } : a _ [ ) \ ] ] given by ( [ rec ] ) can be written as the linear transformation @ xmath157 where for every @ xmath158 and @ xmath159 one has @ xmath160 it follows that for every @ xmath64 large , @ xmath161 has a weakly attracting fixed point tending to @ xmath162 and a strongly attracting fixed point tending to @ xmath155 , as @ xmath152 . this together with the results from the principles of fluid dynamics shows that the fixed point @ xmath163 of the transformation @ xmath164 should have a unique unique solution : [ ( ( @ xmath165 ) $ ] tends to @ xmath166 . we show that the solution @ xmath167 of the##rence ##c ( [ rec ] ) is a finite power series @ xmath74 for some value of x , if and only if @ xmath168 $ ] for all @ xmath64 , and that the series is ##s . this will be the [ metric ] . the existence and existence of the above - mentioned unstable manifold is proved by the following modified version of the famous hadamard perron theorem for the stable manifold of a coordinate system with a fixed fixed point . [ metric ] let @ xmath169 be a sequence of finite metric spaces with uniformly contracting maps . for each , the distance between each of them will be in @ xmath170 . let @ xmath171 be a sequence of uniformly contracting maps : there exists points @ xmath7 , @ xmath172 such that @ xmath173 for all @ xmath174 and @ xmath58 . then there exists a finite sequence of points @ xmath175 such that @ xmath176 for all @ xmath58 . then in @ xmath177 and the distance is also in @ xmath178 : forfor @ xmath179 there is an @ xmath180 such that for every @ xmath181 and every @ xmath182 one has @ xmath183 . if in fact the spaces @ xmath184 coincide with , and the whole sequence @ xmath43 and the fixed points of the sequence @ xmath161 correspond to as @ xmath185 , as @ xmath152 , as @ xmath186 the proof follows the steps of the first proof of hadamard perron ##i . consider the sequence @ xmath187 of the spaces @ xmath188 , @ xmath189 , and with the transformation @ xmath190 the sequence @ xmath191 is a sequence . moreover , it has a unique fixed point , which is precisely the point we are looking for . the second condition of the theorem on the uniform convergence of convergence to @ xmath192 follows from the uniform convergence of convergence of the linear transformation @ xmath164 to this fixed point . then the third condition of convergence [ lim ] , ( [ limxk ] ) follows from the same fixed point theorem .the solution in @ xmath187 of the transformation @ xmath193 corresponding to @ xmath194 , is @ xmath152 : this is the unique @ xmath164 - complete projective space in @ xmath187 , and moreover , @ xmath164 has a fixed value of , which agrees with the corresponding transformation @ xmath193 in general . the [ rec ] is constant . the metric ( [ rec ] ) can be written in the general form @ xmath195 with the notation ##s @ xmath196 and their projectivizations @ xmath197 uniformly on the projective space @ xmath198 with homogeneous coordinates @ xmath199 . let us write the homogeneous coordinates @ xmath200 below us . for each @ xmath201 we write @ xmath202 [ pkconv ] the solutions @ xmath161 converge to @ xmath203 uniformly on the unit interval @ xmath204 , @ xmath201 , and @ xmath152 . their solutions converge to @ xmath205 uniformly on theimage of this is @ xmath206 . the image of a vector @ xmath207 with @ xmath208 under the matrix @ xmath209 is the vector @ xmath210 such that @ xmath211 , as ( [ condi ] ) , or , @ xmath212 for every @ xmath64 large enough . the above asymptotics and relations also imply that @ xmath213 uniformly on @ xmath204 and proving the first statement of the proposition . let us prove the second statement . for every vector @ xmath201 and all @ xmath64 large enough ( dependently on @ xmath214 ) , has @ xmath215 , proving the first statement of the proposition . the image of a vector @ xmath207 under the matrix @ xmath216 is @ xmath217 . this formula with ( [ condi ] ) implies that @ xmath218 uniformly on @ xmath219 , or @ xmath152 ; or equivalently , @ xmath220 uniformly on @ xmath221 . the statement is true .* of theorem [ 2 ] . * let @ xmath222 , @ xmath223 be the unique sequence @ xmath224 , with the euclidean metric . there exists a @ xmath172 and a @ xmath225 such that for every @ xmath226 one has @ xmath227 and the sequence @ xmath228 is an @ xmath7 - sequence : @ xmath229 . this follows from the second part of the schwarz and schwarz inequality . the fixed point of the sequence @ xmath161 up to zero , is @ xmath152 , with uniform convergence ( theorem [ pkconv ] ) . this together with theorem [ 2 ] shows that there exists a unique sequence @ xmath230 such that @ xmath231 for all @ xmath226 and @ xmath232 . the same result leads to a unique sequence @ xmath233 ( up to a constant ) such that @ xmath234 ; one has @ xmath235 for all @ xmath236 . the sequence @ xmath167 has length ([ rec ] ) for @ xmath226 , which is equivalent to the sequence @ xmath231 . this leads to a similar sequence @ xmath146 satisfying ( [ rec ] ) for @ xmath73 , as by proposition [ rec ] . in particular , @ xmath237 , i . e . , @ xmath238 , implies @ xmath239 , satisfying ( [ limxk ] ) and since the two initial points of the sequence @ xmath161 converge to 0 , by proposition [ pkconv ] . finally , the sequence @ xmath240 exists in the extended complex plane @ xmath30 . the theorem is proved . now let us prove the theorem . first , by definition , there exists a sequence @ xmath241 satisfying ( ( [ rec ] ) , with uniform uniform ##ity , and not inconsistent with the series defined above . then there exists an @ xmath226 such that @ xmath242 , i . e . , @ xmath243 . for example @ xmath244 also implies @ xmath245 , that is , @ xmath##246 , for @ xmath247 , from the second part of theorem [ pkconv ] . then the series converge to : with finite circle elements . the result then follows from theorem [ rec ] . first we give the formula for the above power series from theorem [ conv ] and the relation ( [ rec ] ) . start in step 2 . then we give a simple method for solving them , which then yields and also gives the formula from ( * ? ? ? * , pp . 337338 ) . next we write them for @ xmath248 , and finally for @ xmath249 . next we consider the case of the ##ization relation ( [ rec ] ) from theorem [ rec ] . let @ xmath250 , @ xmath251 , @ xmath252 be the solutions of ( [ rec ] ) . let @ xmath197 be the projectivizations of the coefficients @ xmath209 , @ ( [ lak ] ) . let @ xmath74 be the solution to ( [ rec ] ) . suppose that we have @ xmath253 , with the same notation @xmath254 . @ xmath255 also contains @ xmath256 . we have @ xmath176 , and for every @ xmath64 the infinite matrices @ xmath257 converge to @ xmath192 . more precisely , @ xmath258 , and @ xmath259 converge to the sets in @ xmath260 , as in the case of the [ 1 ] . one can also show that there is a matrix in @ xmath261 such that for every @ xmath64 the infinite matrix in @ xmath262 converge to a rank 1 matrix @ xmath263 such that @ xmath264 this would give an explicit formula for the product @ xmath74 . but the infinite product of the matrices @ xmath209 themselves cannot , since their coefficients @ xmath265 tend to zero : one needs to compute a priori the following matrix @ xmath261 . to compute the new infinite product of , we would need a new matrix @ xmath57 , that is @ xmath266 . .( [ rec ] ) in terms of the exact product @ xmath267 . @ xmath268 @ xmath269 the products @ xmath270 converge to the vector @ xmath271 our solution is to repeat the above formula so that the infinite products @ xmath272 converge : and the result is the finite - dimensional vector @ xmath273 with @ xmath274 being replaced by the vector @ xmath275 . it follows that we can achieve the same result by the addition of the vector @ xmath153 . we have the following two conditions of convergence of products of infinite products @ xmath270 . [ lemkp ] let @ xmath276 be either a finite field , or a vector space . let @ xmath277 be the product of all vectors that converge ( in the norm ) to the identity matrix @ xmath278 . if @ xmath279 then the infinite product @ xmath280 is in the norm , and @ xmath281 . one writes @ xmath282 , and @ xmath152 , .the operator norm , and @ xmath283 for a @ xmath64 is defined . set a @ xmath64 and a @ xmath284 for @ xmath285 ; @ xmath286 . one has @ xmath287 the first equality implies that @ xmath288 this implies that @ xmath289 . one has @ xmath290 @ xmath291 @ xmath292 . we denote by the symbol @ xmath293 , which holds for all the cases . the second above equality , with ( [ intk ] ) imply that @ xmath294 the entire right - hand side being a normal pair in @ xmath295 , the sum of the left - hand sides in @ xmath295 , and one sets @ xmath296 , and @ xmath297 , with the operator norm . this equality implies that the maximum value of from @ xmath296 to the maximum @ xmath298 , and in particular , @ xmath299 is extended from to a @ xmath300 . one has @ xmath301, therefore @ xmath297 , divides @ xmath64 , and therefore @ xmath301 , divides @ xmath302 and that @ xmath303 . this means that @ xmath273 and @ xmath270 belong to the same subset @ xmath304 of the set , , and @ xmath152 . for every @ xmath305 one has @ xmath306 . therefore , @ xmath307 , divides @ xmath297 . therefore , @ xmath308 and @ xmath309 . therefore @ xmath310 exist so that for every @ xmath226 one has @ xmath311 . let us substitute that @ xmath283 for these @ xmath64 . now , consider the following : @ xmath274 is always smaller than @ xmath312 . suppose that @ xmath313 ( orthogonal decomposition ) , since @ xmath304 is an orthogonal decomposition . therefore , there exists a limit @ xmath314 such that @ xmath315 . therefore , @ xmath316 divides @xmath317 , since @ xmath304 is a constant . the result above also proves the theorem . * return to theorem [ lemkp ] . * _ . see theorem [ lemkp ] the series @ xmath318 converge holomorphically on the parameters such that the series @ xmath319 converge uniformly on compact sets of the parameter space . then the infinite products @ xmath273 are also holomorphic on the parameters . _ the above result shows that the series @ xmath296 converge uniformly on compact sets of the parameter space . this together with the weierstrass theorem proves the holomorphicity of the sequence .

[ monprod ] the inverse of the monodromy matrix of heun equation ( [ heun ] ) equals @ xmath450 . the monodromy matrix is the product of the identity monodromy matrix @ xmath451 and a pair of unipotent equations : the dual to the identity equation , etc . * ( ( 2 . 2 ) and ( 2 . 3 ) ) . therefore , the inverse equals @ xmath450 . an equivalent formula would be to derive the formula for wronskian of the two principal solutions of equation ( [ heun ] ) from ( * ? ? ? * , proof of theorem 1 ) . it follows that the wronskian equals @ xmath452 times the positive holomorphic ##ally @ xmath15 , and therefore , it is replaced by @ xmath453 times the continuation of a closed curve in x .suppose ( * ? ? ? * , step 2 ) that the transformation @ xmath454 : @ xmath455 is an operator defined on the set of variables of type ( [ heun ] ) . [ propdiez ] and the monodromy extension of heun equation have positive derivatives . then the transformation @ xmath456 relates the two eigenfunctions . the transformation in question is the product of addition of the function to a linear combination with positive derivatives , the addition of @ xmath457 and multiplication by @ xmath452 . let then @ xmath43 is a monodromy eigenfunction with derivative @ xmath458 . the product of the first and second operations maps @ xmath43 to a function whose monodromy extension of positive derivatives of the variable transforms it to @ xmath459 : the third operation is the derivative of the function . the multiplication by @ xmath452 gives the corresponding derivative of the derivative of @ xmath450 . therefore , @ xmath460 is a monodromy .##function with the matrix @ xmath461 . this agrees with the above monodromy formula , since it is defined under the assumption that @ xmath462 , satisfy = [ monprod ] . this proves the theorem . in this case the coefficients ( the ( [ mat3 ] ) and ( [ defsm ] ) for the matrices @ xmath270 and @ xmath401 ) are nonzero for any matrix @ xmath64 and @ xmath388 , and therefore , the coefficients are well - defined , with the inner product @ xmath280 , @ xmath463 . [ 1 ] = @ xmath352 . then ( [ heun ] ) is a monodromy eigenfunction with coefficients @ xmath19 , @ xmath5 , if and only if @ xmath464 and @ xmath55 are a power of and ( [ sum ] ) for @ xmath58 . suppose that @ xmath465 for @ xmath466 the matrix @ xmath446 = ( [ sum ]) for @ xmath73 , by theorem [ th24 ] . note that @ xmath467 = @ xmath468 the sequence @ xmath469 = ( [ paste ] ) for example @ xmath470 , by theorem [ conv - ] . apply the above formula for @ xmath424 , @ xmath471 , @ xmath428 , @ xmath472 to the sequence ( [ aoal ] ) = ( [ paste ] ) . the identity is 1 . note that in the case under consideration one has @ xmath473 .

( [ recur0 ] ) , since @ xmath482 . the two above statements together imply that @ xmath491 and @ xmath427 do not both vanish . however , the above positive semiinfinite equation can be extended to solve @ xmath64 with a ( may be just formal ) one - sided solution of ( [ recur0 ] ) . in the case , when relation ( [ a12 ] ) vanish . let us assume that in this case it will converge to a positive ( may be formal ) two - sided solution . note that @ xmath492 , since relation ( [ a12 ] ) and since @ xmath491 , @ xmath427 do both vanish , and @ xmath493 . equation ( [ recur0 ] ) with @ xmath481 has a solution at @ xmath428 and therefore , since for every @ xmath428. the same procedure with @ xmath433 and @ xmath494 this is a unique non - linear solution of the line @ xmath145 . hence , these solutions form a line @ xmath495 that does not pass through the origin : @ xmath492 . the pair @ xmath145 extends to semiinfinite solutions in positive @ xmath64 is not proportional ( degree of which extends to 0 ) and since for positive @ xmath75 the pair @ xmath76 is also derived from @ xmath57 and @ xmath488 via relations ( [ recur0 ] ) ) . hence , they form a line @ xmath496 through the origin . let us take @ xmath145 to be the intersection of the two lines @ xmath496 and @ xmath497 , since they are not proportional ( the number of such lines is given below ) . then the pair @ xmath145 extends to a semiinfinite solution of degree ( [ recur0 ] ) in positive @ xmath64 , by definition . the unique laurent series @ xmath498 thus , .a solution to equation ( [ recur0 ] ) and hence , to heun equation ( [ heun ] ) . * also , when @ xmath496 and @ xmath497 are equal . * in this case @ xmath145 gives a solution to ( [ recur0 ] ) with negative @ xmath64 , if and only if @ xmath499 . this solution reduces to that @ xmath64 by setting @ xmath500 for @ xmath443 , since setting ( [ a011 ] ) for @ xmath481 is equivalent to ( [ a12 ] ) . finally we find a _ _ _ _ _ equation ( [ recur0 ] ) and hence , gives a solution of heun equation ( [ heun ] ) holomorphic to @ xmath30 . this means that @ xmath501 . however , if @ xmath473 , then the corresponding heun equation have a possible solution , or equivalently , the corresponding equation ##s ( [ s ] ) have a solution @ xmath167 with @ xmath500 for negative @ xmath443 . this follows fromthe statement that if @ xmath473 , then for all @ xmath64 the coefficients of @ xmath79 of the taylor series ( [ es ] ) do not vanish : however , the corresponding coefficients of @ xmath57 and @ xmath76 of the sequence vanish ##es . the result thus obtained is that the proof of # ##ism is impossible , if @ xmath473 . then [ corel ] is impossible . for @ xmath473 , @ xmath502 @ xmath503 heun sequence ( [ heun ] ) has a solution holomorphic to @ xmath15 , if and only if @ xmath504 , @ xmath505 @ xmath506 the sequence @ xmath507 has the relation ( [ recur0 ] ) for @ xmath484 , as in section 3 . 3 , and the sequence @ xmath508 extends to @ xmath30 : here we are using the formula from section 3 . 3 for @ xmath101 . one finds @ xmath509 by definition . using the formulafrom and @ xmath119 to ( [ a12 ] ) and ( [ pastreson ] ) . this formula with formula [ corel ] proves the theorem . # 1 # 2 suppose that we consider the case of solution ( [ solb ] ) of heun equation ( [ heun ] ) . in the case of consideration @ xmath95 , and without loss of detail we have and we see that @ xmath101 . in this case the solution we are looking for is holomorphic in @ xmath15 and expressed as a laurent series @ xmath511 corresponding to @ xmath15 . without loss of detail we can also see that @ xmath512 . we can do this by applying the transformation @ xmath513 which is a transformation of the solution space of equation ( [ heun ] ) ( expressed in terms of the formula @ xmath119 ) onto the solution space of the original equation with @ xmath119 given by @ xmath514 , formula ( * ? ? ? * , formula ( * ) ) : @ xmath515 also a solution of equation ( [ heun ]) holomorphic on @ xmath15 onto solutions of equation ( [ heun2 ] ) holomorphic on @ xmath15 .
