for a phase transition , the expression @ xmath13 for the non critical value of a closed system @ xmath14 has the well known form @ xmath15 where @ xmath0 and @ xmath16 are the critical values and the critical values ##s . for the statistical analysis of thermal simulations , a scaling procedure with non - critical values of @ xmath0 can be used . the simplest and most common procedure , which can be referred to simply as @ xmath17 scaling , is to replace the @ xmath18 with a temperature correction constant . for practical purposes this constant is chosen to be @ xmath19 for the temperature ; one then writes the resulting temperature correction as the following rule - based formula : @ xmath20 ^ { - \ cal _ f } = { \ cal ##c } _ { t } , ^ { - \ cal _ c } , \ cal { cal _ f } \ ] ] where @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 are the critical values ( see [ ] for a detailed discussion ) . an alternative and _ _ priori _ _ _ procedure is to write @ xmath23 ^{ - \ beta _ scaling } = { \ cal c } _ { f } [ ( 1 - \ beta ) / 2 ] ^ { - \ beta _ f } \ nonumber \ \ & = & { \ cal c } _ { f } \ left [ [ - \ frac { \ beta } { \ bec } \ right ] ^ { - \ beta _ f } = { \ cal c } _ { f } \ right ^ { - \ beta _ f } , \ dot { beta _ f } \ dot { t } \ ] ] where @ xmath24 is the reference to @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 . note that the temperature dependence of the term is slightly different for each temperature . this ` ` @ xmath24 ' ' ' form has become the standard form for theoretical work on the mechanical properties of ferromagnets and other materials , as for example @ xcite , although more complicated forms have been proposed for practical applications . for higher temperatures , corrections and other correction terms ( such as temperature dependence terms ) are used . thus , the first correction term , the critical temperature , @ xmath27, is expressed in terms of the @ xmath24 scaling form @ xmath28 where @ xmath29 with @ xmath30 being the [ critical ] temperature correction amplitude , and @ xmath31 being the temperature correction amplitude . in the @ xmath17 scaling scheme , @ xmath5 in the above form is replaced by @ xmath32 . this extended scaling scheme is well established in the literature in the case of temperatures very close to @ xmath33 @ xcite . values of the @ xmath31 for all observables are universal @ xcite . the universal @ xmath34 is universal for all critical values very far to @ xmath35 . however , a scaling scheme seems to have been developed which would ensure that either the @ xmath17 or the @ xmath24 form is universal for all ( if any ) observables when a much wider temperature range is required . so we have developed an extended scaling scheme for all observables so that the above critical values are universal , even up to the last critical value of the universal @ xcite . our extended scaling scheme is based on a number ofhigh - resolution fourier analysis ( htse ) , and it is usually described in terms of the @ xmath24 model . the most important feature of the model is the use of non - zero prefactors @ xmath36 in the model , where the model @ xmath37 is carefully chosen so that the model @ xmath38 corresponds to the # ##ized ##e of the model @ xmath39 . in the second phase our objective is to further develop our theoretical modeling scheme to include both the model and the critical parameters . we will begin our work by collecting models for the cubic ferromagnets : the @ xmath40 ising , s and z models for cubic liquid crystals of order n . these models have been extensively studied for many years and their three critical parameters : @ xmath0 , the critical parameters @ xmath16 , @ xmath34 , and the critical parameters are known to high precision . detailed descriptions of calculations for high scale models are available for download as pdf . the simulation and htse results have been published in the form of two tables . the simulation results show that the hthe critical parameters have consistent values over the entire temperature range , with small but significant differences due to critical and non - critical terms . we obtain estimates of non - critical critical parameters , critical parameters @ xmath41 and the correction constant @ xmath42 from the high resolution simulation data . our # # ##s are in every respect completely consistent with the theoretical and htse values of the critical parameters . an important part of the theoretical analysis is to demonstrate that the prefactors @ xmath36 which have been introduced play a key role in obtaining accurate estimates of the critical parameters from simulation data obtained over a temperature range close to @ xmath0 , such as @ xmath43 . in the theoretical analysis without the prefactors the values of the observed critical parameters and of the critical terms from analysis of the simulations turn out to be likely to be @ xmath44 ( or @ xmath45 ) . the standard approach based on the htse should be made applicable to a wide range of materials with the same basic htse properties as the standard ferromagnets . applications to more complex systems such as liquid crystals are not a simple @xcite . the paper is structured as follows . in sec . [ sec : description ] we present our extended scaling scheme for the physical observables , and the possible solutions to some terms in our scheme . in sec . [ sec : analysis ] we present ways of solving for the terms in our extended scaling scheme . we show how they work in particular for ising , maxwell and the ferromagnets in sec . [ sec : 3dising ] , [ sec : 3dxy ] and [ sec : 3dh ] , etc . in sec . [ sec : analysis ] we make some remarks and discuss other topics . let us have htse of the form @ xmath46 is represented by @ xmath47 the most important problem of our extended scaling scheme is how to replace @ xmath27 with @ xmath48 where @ xmath49 with @ xmath50 . in particular , the corresponding term without the necessary corrections is written as @ xmath51 the idea here is to have @ xmath27 not only have the correct power - law but @ xmath52 with the correct derivative @ xmath53 ( andwith ( analytic correction terms ) at temperatures equal to @ xmath0 , which has an analytic value ( with the htse at the lower temperature ) . the quantity @ xmath46 is then defined as @ xmath54 . the correction term is the first ( non - analytic ) correction term of the solution scheme . the values @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 are chosen in such a way that viz . ( [ fc _ expression ] ) , combines with viz . ( [ fc _ expression ] ) and ( [ rfc _ expression ] ) , combines with viz . ( [ hight _ expression ] ) termwise as a function of @ xmath24 ; for example , @ xmath57 and the corresponding expression for @ xmath58 . the resulting system of equations with the corresponding values of the coefficients and analytic correction terms yields the explicit expression we have for the quantity @ xmath46 which is constant in the domain @ xmath59 and is constant in @ xmath60 . an equivalent term for in our original solution scheme is @ xmath61 . as @ xmath62 .is the ratio of the critical value of at @ xmath14 to the corresponding critical value of the @ xmath36 prefactor , without the critical term @ xmath41 . thus , in the limit of @ xmath0 where @ xmath63 , it becomes at @ xmath64 the peak @ xmath61 versus @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 . is a straight line with peak @ xmath67 and peak @ xmath68 , where the values of @ xmath0 , @ xmath16 and @ xmath34 are assumed to be constant ( @ xmath37 and @ xmath69 are given by htse ##1 ) . in the limit @ xmath70 , on the other hand , it becomes @ xmath71 beyond these , the value of @ xmath61 will depend on the infinite set of the second order solutions to be . the ` ` reduced ' ' gain , as obtained from the gain due to the externally applied field , is given by the gain - loss relation for @ xmath72 the .thus @ xmath73 is ( now ) almost always referred to in the literature as ` ` the ' ' ' . for simplicity we will follow this convention and write the total expression as @ xmath74 , and we will refer it in the literature to ` ` ` ##ibility ' ' . the htse for the reduced expression @ xmath75 with @ xmath40 ferromagnets is of the form with @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 , and with each of @ xmath78 , @ xmath79 . the first short term , f . ( [ fc _ expression ] ) , is reduced as @ xmath80 with @ xmath81 . the expression @ xmath82 of f . ( [ fc _ expression ] ) is reduced to @ xmath83 where @ xmath84 of f . ( [ fc _ expression ] ) for @ xmath8 . note that @ xmath85 near @ xmath0 , @ xmath86 , @ xmath33 , and @ xmath##87 . critical temperature . if @ xmath82 is equal to zero over the whole temperature range ( which is the case for the material we studied , we will find that ) , the first moment contribution without the correction term , @ xmath88 , is a good substitute for the critical value , @ xmath75 . however , the critical contribution @ xmath89 of the ising and the ferromagnets over the same temperature range @ xmath59 turns out to be represented very well by our critical contribution , @ xmath90 of y . ( [ x _ z ] ) , but with one critical and two non - critical correction terms . there are several different definitions for the correlation length , but the correlation length is at least 1 @ xmath91 . the first moment correlation length @ xmath92 is defined as the first moment @ xmath93 with @ xmath94 the second moment @ xcite . from now on we will refer to @ xmath95 and as @ xmath96 . the htse results show that for @ xmath97 - for @xmath40 ##8 , the solution for @ xmath98 is of the form @ xmath99 and is similarly related with @ xmath100 , where @ xmath101 is the number of nearest neighbors . this yields @ xmath102 and @ xmath103 . we can reduce q . ( [ fc _ scaling ] ) to @ xmath104 where @ xmath105 with @ xmath106 is the first order term of q . ( [ fc _ scaling ] ) for @ xmath107 . the non - zero spin prefactor @ xmath108 for @ xmath109 is our fundamental problem . the boundary - value problem @ xcite of the # ##s using the convection - diffusion method is an example of the correct physical properties of x . ( [ cri _ scaling ] ) . see also the solution of smith and burford @ xcite , with their solution and ` ` effective interaction terms ' ' for @ xmath110 . the most important solution of @ xmath96 with the effective interaction terms is given by @ xmath111and is written as @ xmath112 the result @ xmath113 is @ xmath114 and , because of the above expression , it becomes @ xmath115 , @ xmath33 and @ xmath116 \ [ + \ cdots $ ] with @ xmath117 being the term in question . ( [ htse _ 1 ] ) near critical ##ity . the direct calculation of the critical energy ( defined as the integral of the specific energy at constant pressure @ xmath118 ) near critical takes the result @ xmath119 ^ { - \ beta } + [ \ begin { e _ 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath120 and @ xmath121 are the critical coefficients of @ xmath122 , and it is common practice to add a second non - critical ( in fact , zero ) to @ xmath123 ( see e . g . , [ ] ) . both the coefficients for the first moment and the second moment @ xmath124 are linear combinations of @ xmath24 with both odd and even coefficients , for which ( such as bcc andfor ( ) , the htse series for @ xmath125 consists of integer terms of @ xmath24 and @ xcite , and can be written as @ xmath126 one can write out the same sequence of terms @ xcite as in the case of @ xmath127 , except that if all the terms in the series are even for @ xmath128 , the critical amplitude can be re - expressed in terms of the constant [ @ xmath129 $ ] and @ xmath130 $ ] , the corresponding terms for the correlation function . similarly , with @ xmath131 , one can write the second critical amplitude , which corresponds to q . ( [ fc _ leading ] ) , as @ xmath132 where @ xmath133 . if the leading correction terms are even , we write the term corresponding to q . ( [ fc _ leading ] ) [ @ xmath134 . \ { { fc _ cri } \ ] ] where @ xmath135 is the third critical amplitude . it is clear that , since the leading correction values @ xmath121 and @ xmat##h136 is defined in the same way ( as seen in fig . ( [ c _ c ] ) for @ xmath121 ) , the values @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 appear in the definition of @ xmath139 and in fig . ( [ c _ cri ] ) , respectively . in practice there is a hyper - linear transformation from this @ xmath140 to @ xmath106 @ xcite : @ xmath141 where @ xmath142 is a constant whose value is known earlier than @ xcite . the ( [ cri _ c ] ) is not constant , but it can be made to go to the temperature limit , @ xmath143 , or @ xmath17 or @ xmath0 . in practice @ xmath139 is much less than this ( as can be seen also in the definition of the @ xmath144 ising model ) which is the reason for the large non - critical contribution to @ xmath125 . the non - critical contribution is in fact not a constant to be accounted for , but rather is to be determined by the specific temperature part of the modelwhich corresponds to f . ( [ psi _ c ] ) . using the critical terms so as to clarify the situation , we obtain the corresponding effective function values for @ xmath145 from f . ( [ cri _ c ] ) and for @ xmath125 from f . ( [ htse _ c ] ) . the @ xmath125 corresponding to the two non - critical functional forms is then known as @ xmath146 where the non - critical terms @ xmath147 are determined from @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 . the parameters @ xmath150 and @ xmath151 are derived from htse . so if @ xmath152 and @ xmath153 have been calculated simultaneously , we can find all the parameters which one needs to determine the functional form of @ xmath125 , such as @ xmath154 and @ xmath139 , in f . ( [ eqn : hyper ] ) . this we find to be @ xmath155 , the functional form for @ xmath125 , in the form @ xmat##h24 = @ xmath156 . the well defined value @ xmath155 can be determined by comparison with si and htse data . although we will mention the si only , and will not mention finite - length - scale ( fss ) values , in the next article , we know for sure that the universal scaling function matches the fss expression . the standard fss ansatz @ xcite is @ xmath157 , \ label { fss } \ ] ] where @ xmath158 is the universal scaling function . the commonly used fss expression derived from h . ( [ fss ] ) , @ xmath159 \ ] ] makes the same use of @ xmath17 ##8 for the unit scale . it is therefore only valid if applied to a very narrow range of values like @ xmath33 . with the universal scaling and the finite - scale function @ xmath160 , the fss ansatz can be written @ xcite @ xmath161 , \ label { fss _ ferro } \ ] ] and @ xmath162 , \ ] ] where the scaling functions such as @ xmath##163 and @ xmath164 = @ xmath165 . for the same reason with @ xmath76 , the fss form is written as @ xmath166 , \ nonumber \ \ & = & \ beta ^ { - \ gamma } \ end { \ mathcal } } _ { \ gamma } \ right [ \ left ( \ frac { 1 } { \ beta ^ { 1 / 2 } } \ right ) ^ { 1 / \ beta } \ right \ right ] , \ label { fss _ chi } \ end { xi } \ ] ] where @ xmath167 and @ xmath168 etc . = @ xmath165 . in a similar fashion , the fss form for the same function @ xmath160 , for which @ xmath169 and @ xmath102 , is written as @ xmath170 , \ label { fss _ chi } \ ] ] where @ xmath171 = @ xmath165 . although the standard fss form for the above is different from the above form , , the @ xmath24 - prefactorusing the properties of @ xmath172 , the scaling plot is easily extended for @ xmath173 ising # and @ xmath144 ising # ##or for @ xcite . in order to perform a practical extension of the above scaling plot , we consider the three different ferromagnets : ising , x and y , in three different cubic cubic systems . high resolution experimental data has been collected for all of these systems for the temperature range , from 0 to @ xmath0 to near @ xmath174 and the authors have also published their results in the journal @ xcite . the data has been collected for systems large enough for the melting point to be outside of the theoretical limit . the htses have also been calculated for @ xmath74 and @ xmath124 and for @ xmath175 for all the systems @ xcite , and very good values for the free - energy and the specific heat have been obtained for the ising and @ xcite ; these data can be used to calculate @ xmath8 , @ xmath9 and @ xmath122 and for thebelow @ xmath17 ##6 and @ xmath0 . 5 we denote these htse and sec data as the _ mc _ data . due to a combination of techniques from chaos theory and htse the estimates of the critical temperature , the critical frequency and the critical amplitude are known to a high degree of accuracy , and the critical correction coefficients are also well known . the [ non - critical ] critical correction coefficients are known for these critical parameters and the estimates are much less accurate ( see butera and comi @ xcite for a detailed discussion ) . in this case we will use the ratios @ xmath82 and @ xmath113 as shown in fig . ( [ rchi _ def ] ) and ( [ rxi _ def ] ) with respect to @ xmath65 , where we have used @ xmath176 for the differential equations . the ratios above @ xmath66 are both the critical and the critical temperatures as shown at the bottom of fig . [ 0 : 0 ] . the ratios are defined in the way that they are zero at constant temperature . we will assume that the critical temperatures exist at thethe scaling ratio is in principle close to unity ( or a standard deviation from unity at most ) in the frequency domain of @ xmath5 . in addition , a special scaling relation reduces the observables @ xmath75 and @ xmath96 and @ xmath177 to leading order . this relation has the advantage that it can in principle be used to calculate the ratio @ xmath178 directly from a log - log plot of @ xmath75 against @ xmath96 and @ xmath179 without any additional specification of @ xmath179 . for the extended scaling relation ( @ xmath24 scales with the @ xmath36 scale ) , the ratio can be reduced to leading order @ xmath180 we can have the ratio given by @ xmath181 with the two additional scale parameters , which are as @ xmath33 and @ xmath182 where @ xmath183 and @ xmath184 . we also note that the ratios @ xmath185 are equal and are assumed to be equal @ xmath186 @ xcite . this means that @ xmat##h187 . for the @ xmath144 co - ising case @ xmath188 , along with the high resolution mc steps at temperatures close to @ xmath0 by kim et al @ xcite and the htse case at very low temperatures by butera and comi @ xcite , our total mc steps are also simulated in order to calculate them and to calculate the temperature values of @ xmath189 and @ xmath175 . for our analysis we use the sample rate method in combination with 64 bit multi - step scaling method for the sampling errors . the 64 bit values used are averaged over the range of @ xmath190 . the number of total mc steps for @ xmath191 and @ xmath192 and the total @ xmath193 mc steps are used for calculating the error . # [ source : 3di - chixi - 1 ] . the first is log - log plot of the simple linear regression of the thermal average @ xmath74 against @ xmath194 data . without need for scaling , the length of the interval closest to the data points ( including our mc steps when they arethe ( finite - size effects ) is the first order @ xmath195 . the [ fig : 3di - chixi - c ] is the first order ( @ xmath17 against @ xmath24 ##0 ) log - likelihood plot of @ xmath74 against @ xmath107 with the result equal to the one obtained from fig . [ fig : 3di - chixi - c ] . it can be seen that in the standard scaling form the scaling relationship breaks down very quickly . in the extended scaling form with the full scaled data , the relationship extends to a small degree up to an unknown temperature and up to that of @ xmath33 until replaced by finite - size effects . we use the first line of the standard scaling form given in fig . ( [ fig _ 1 ] ) . to increase precision , fig . [ fig : 3di - chixi - e2 ] is the plot of @ xmath196 against @ xmath197 , against @ xmath198 , @ xmath199 and @ xmath200 @ xcite . the result is obtained by adding the data obtained from @ xmath201 to fig . ([ ( _ def ] ) . the value ##s @ xmath66 , @ xmath202 , is in perfect agreement with the values @ xmath203 , the same values from htse @ xcite . from the experimental data , @ xmath204 , which we will work with here . the [ fig : 3di - rchi ] and [ fig : 3di - rxi ] are the values @ xmath82 and @ xmath113 of vs . ( [ rchi _ def ] ) and ( [ rxi _ def ] ) , respectively . the lower terms are taken from kim et al @ xcite , and the higher order terms are taken from the experimental data of butera and comi @ xcite . the htse values are then assumed , and the values assumed correspond to the theoretical values where the deviation from these values would be greatest , and the duration of the experiment . by using various mathematical techniques , including differential equations , the range over which the experimental htse data @ xcite could be used to determine the temperature dependence of the observables to high temperatures could be greatly extended . the four fundamental principles .@ xmath205 , @ xmath206 and @ xmath207 @ xcite . from the characteristic lengths and angles of the resulting curves , and @ xmath5 , we have @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 , @ xmath210 and @ xmath211 . the @ xmath212 values are in quantitative agreement with the htse estimates @ xcite , @ xmath213 and @ xmath214 . the @ xmath42 values are in quantitative agreement with the htse estimates @ xmath215 and @ xmath216 @ xcite . an important fact about the large scale properties of the @ xmath144 ##e - ising model , which can be verified by the results of the various other models as well , is that this type of model is highly consistent with the high resolution estimates of critical parameters from both htse and field theory ( field ) models . it is known that for the entire frequency range from @ xmath0 to 1 , the largest deviation from the known critical parameters of is . ( [ cri _ 1 ] ) and ( [ cr##i _ ( ] ) is of the order of a few degrees . let us go into the discussion of the @ xmath217 scale . in the image of fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] , we show the same @ xmath17 scaling for @ xmath218 as against @ xmath219 . the scale is calculated using the same combination of the scale values @ xmath220 and @ xmath221 as those for @ xmath217 , and so by measuring in the same @ xmath222 range the peaks and trough of the scales almost coincide . it can be seen that in fact the @ xmath17 scaling curve exactly matches the @ xmath24 scaling curve and makes the scale of @ xmath222 very close to it . this comparison for @ xmath74 with @ xmath223 , suggests the superiority of the @ xmath24 scale , and therefore our own scale , over the @ xmath17 scale . the adjacent figure of the same image of fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] shows the higher scale , @ xmath224 , which is calculated at @xmath225 , with the leading critical term mentioned , and the following non - correction terms . the first term of the equation is a constant , @ xmath226 , which is determined @ xmath227 at @ xmath228 , and over an infinite distance . the second term @ xmath229 , which is also determined via the constant ##s mentioned , is the value of @ xmath224 at @ xmath228 . after taking into account all these non correction terms to the leading critical term , @ xmath230 of e . ( [ cri _ 1 ] ) , we obtain @ xmath224 which matches very well the _ x _ value in the whole temperature range @ xmath231 . note that @ xmath232 close to @ xmath233 . this case also demonstrates the equivalence of our temperature equation with the @ xmath24 ##0 : @ xmath230 not only has the real value of @ xmath75 close to @ xmath0 but also @ xmath75 in the whole temperature range up to 0 . in this case we see also that @ xmath234for the ` ` x ' ' , and that the final value @ xmath75 was derived from our extended scaling method . we also note that the difference between the @ xmath217 plot in fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] and the @ xmath235 plot in fig . [ fig : 3di - rxi ] across the entire range of scales is remarkable . finally , fig . [ fig : 3di - si ] shows @ xmath236 as a variant of @ xmath237 . the data points are taken from the htse of arisue and fujiwara which corresponds to powers up to @ xmath238 @ xcite , our energy simulations for @ xmath239 and @ xmath240 @ xcite , and our energy simulations for all powers up to @ xmath191 . we apply the extended model with non - zero value to @ xmath125 plot in fig . ( [ 1 _ 1 ] ) . then using the hyper - scale model with the value of @ xmath142 corresponds to @ xmath241 @ xcite for the @ xmath144 and##ing out and our @ xmath107 values , we get @ xmath242 . then the non - critical values @ xmath243 and @ xmath244 are calculated using @ xmath150 and @ xmath151 of htse and with the @ xmath245 . the resulting curve is the error - correction curve ##ization of c . ( [ h _ 1 ] ) with the @ xmath246 values known as discussed above . the analysis over the whole temperature range is very good ; the non - critical value is so good that the local thermal power density is a good approximation until is much closer to @ xmath0 than the value predicted by the model . we take this result as an indication that the numerical integration method , with the additional choice of scale factors is an effective method for calculating all - important values in general . the following analysis has been carried out for the @ xmath144 - and ( @ xmath247 ) . high quality experimental results were obtained by gottlob and hasenbusch @ xcite , and are supported further by theoretical results , provided by j . hasebusch @ xcite . the followingthe plot is calculated from the time series of butera and comi @ xcite . the initial value is @ xmath248 and the values @ xmath178 , @ xmath34 , @ xmath249 and @ xmath250 are assigned to @ xmath251 and @ xmath252 , respectively @ xcite . figure [ fig : 3dxy - chixi - e ] shows the @ xmath253 log - log plot . the above plot also works well up to very high values , especially for the ising model . the plot of g . [ fig : 3dxy - chixi - e ] gives us the value of @ xmath178 which is in agreement with the previously calculated value @ xcite . figure [ fig : 3dxy - chixi - e2 ] shows the plot of @ xmath254 ^ { [ - \ n } $ ] against @ xmath65 and the corresponding values for the values @ xmath178 and @ xmath34 as described above . figures [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] and [ fig : 3dxy - rxi ] against @ xmath82and @ xmath113 plotted against @ xmath197 . from the @ xmath66 parameters and the experimental data we can calculate @ xmath255 , @ xmath256 , @ xmath257 and @ xmath258 . these are all very close to the three initial htse estimates @ xcite @ xmath259 , @ xmath260 , @ xmath261 and @ xmath262 , which are much more accurate because they are consistent with the initial experimental estimates of the standard scale @ xmath263 , see table in ref . [ ] . however , the values of @ xmath264 and @ xmath265 from ref . ( [ scale _ 1 ] ) and from the initial values of the parameters represent only the scale factor described in ref . [ 1 : 3dxy - chixi - e2 ] . this model also supports the standard scale method and means that any combination of data from ft , htse , and experiments obtained using this method can lead to very high - scale factor estimates . for example , we compare the parameters @ xmath17 ##0 to @ xmath266 #in fig . [ sec : 3dising ] and in fig . [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] . the comparison with @ xmath217 will not hold for @ xmath267 . as is the case for the ising model , the magnitude of @ xmath268 is equal to that of @ xmath82 and the magnitude of @ xmath269 is much less than the true value of the extended scaling method given @ xmath270 , not @ xmath271 . in fig . [ sec : 3dxy - rxi ] , we will replace the @ xmath17 scaling @ xmath272 and the @ xmath273 scaling @ xmath24 - 1 . the first upper limit of the limit is with the extended scaling method , @ xmath235 of fig . ( [ rxi _ def ] ) with @ xmath247 corresponding to @ xmath274 . with the extended method of scaling the upper limit will hold only for @ xmath267 . in fact , the comparison of @ xmath24 ##7 @ xmath275 with extended scaling @ xmath235 .the appearance of the @ xmath108 prefactor in fig . ( [ rxi _ def ] ) of the extended scaling results . these results show that when compared to @ xmath0 the extended scaling is a significant improvement over the original scaling scheme for both the model and the correction terms . the model in fig . [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] matches our previous model @ xmath224 up to the second term of non - critical ##ity . it is about 3 percent as seen @ xmath217 , from - 0 . 05 at @ xmath66 to 0 at @ xmath228 , to a very good approximation . the corresponding parameter change by @ xmath235 is slightly less than 1 percent as seen in fig . [ fig : 3dxy - rxi ] . to convert this change by @ xmath276 to an approximation as good as @ xmath224 in fig . [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] , however , more than two hundred non - critical correction terms are required . the same work has been carried out for the @ xmath144 - model ( @ xmath277 ) .high - temperature values are obtained by holm and janke @ xcite , and are supplemented later by low temperature values obtained from the experimental data of butera and comi @ xcite . the highest value is @ xmath278 and the points @ xmath178 and @ xmath34 are assigned to @ xmath279 and @ xmath280 @ xcite . more detailed statistical analysis @ xcite gives @ xmath281 , @ xmath282 and @ xmath283 . figure [ fig : 3dh - chixi - 2 ] shows the @ xmath284 log - log plot , which gives an estimate of @ xmath178 compared with that of y . [ ] . figure [ fig : 3dh - chixi - e2 ] shows the plot of @ xmath285 ^ { [ - \ n } $ ] against @ xmath197 and the # ##s for @ xmath286 and @ xmath287 . from this figure it appears that the actual value is very small , leading to nearly identical values for @ xmath288 and @ xmath289 . figure [ fig: 3dh - rchi ] and [ fig : 3dh - rxi ] , and @ xmath82 and @ xmath113 against @ xmath197 , and the values of @ xmath249 and @ xmath250 in ref . [ ] . the mc and htse data do not appear to fit well in these cases , because the way in which the lines are drawn indicates the deviation from the standard normal distribution . however , the variation in the values of both @ xmath82 in ref . [ fig : 3dh - rchi ] and @ xmath113 in ref . [ fig : 3dh - rxi ] are estimated to be a few thirds of their absolute values over the wide range of @ xmath5 as is the case for the other two ferromagnets above . from the straight line analysis of the mc data with only @ xmath197 , we can estimate @ xmath290 , @ xmath291 , @ xmath292 and @ xmath293 . in this case the differences are much greater than with the htse data @ xcite , @ xmath294, @ xmath295 , @ xmath296 and @ xmath297 , . it should be noted that the values for these [ non - universal ] parameters depend very much on the scale values given for the critical temperature . we will need more detailed information on @ xmath0 to calculate the values of these scale parameters for the canonical ferromagnet . we have developed a scaling rule for the calculation and prediction of critical observables with uniform values at all energy levels . this ` ` ' scaling ' ' rule applies for ferromagnets to values of the leading term of the critical temperature of @ xmath0 with @ xmath298 in si with standard units , for the leading term of the second order bond length as @ xmath299 with @ xmath300 and for the leading term of the critical temperature in si as @ xmath301 with @ xmath133 are the non - universal scale parameters which we can calculate by reference to the htse . calculations are required of high resolution experimental data for the canonical ferromagnets using these parameters . for confl##uent ##ric correction terms , and non - correction terms for the other parameters . for @ xmath0 the parameters are all consistent with the critical temperature values ( including the ric correction ) which have been obtained by the fourier scaling , htse and scaling of @ xcite . the most important result stated in the main article is that , for @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 the critical temperature values with the same critical amplitude @ xmath302 of fig . ( [ fc _ leading ] ) correspond to a very good agreement with the ratio @ xmath46 ##0 to infinite temperature . to explain this result , in detail we have used the ratio @ xmath61 shown in fig . ( [ fc _ leading ] ) . for @ xmath74 of the ising ferromagnet , for example , it is equal to the critical values @ xmath303 , @ xmath0 ( @ xmath66 ) and to 1 to infinite temperature ( @ xmath228 ) by definition . @ xmath217 differs from the critical value is given by the ratio shown in fig . [ 2 : 3di - rchi ] , and @xmath217 s . the leading expression @ xmath304 is independent of @ xmath5 and independent to @ xmath303 . the difference between the two is , therefore , at least 10 percent in this case . the corresponding differences for @ xmath217 s of the two other ferromagnets as well as for @ xmath235 s of the two other ferromagnets are less than 10 percent . this is our main problem mentioned just above . we have also demonstrated that our extended scale method , in place of the @ xmath24 method and with the time - prefactor @ xmath36 , is of great importance in successfully calculating the leading value @ xmath42 of the first extended scale method . the expression is represented by the first expression in fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] as well as those in fig . [ fig : 3di - rxi ] , [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] , and [ fig : 3dxy - rxi ] . in addition , we have also demonstrated that the leading expression @ xmath305 of fig . ( [ first _ term ] ) ,one of @ xmath306 and two critical and two non - critical terms , namely @ xmath307 which gives the curve @ xmath61 as well as doing the same in fig . [ fig : 3di - rchi ] and [ fig : 3dxy - rchi ] , where more than two non - critical correction terms would be necessary for a good understanding of the observables . the two non - critical terms of the cubic equation @ xmath122 are easily calculated from just our standard model , with no other known temperature reference . for the ising ferromagnet , the specific cubic equation @ xmath122 is known to a large extent for the entire temperature range ( see fig . ( [ f _ expression ] ) ) . although the non - critical correction terms are different for @ xmath122 , the form of the equation is the same as the one applied also to @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 , for which the corrections to them are very small . thus , the non - critical term @ xmath46 is replaced by @ xmath305 of fig . ( [ f _ expression ]) in the approximate solution of @ xmath24 to a good approximation . the solution term of @ xmath308 , the final correction term and a very large number of non - exact correction terms derived from htse . all these approaches can be summarized as : the ` ` extended scaling ' ' approach . the approach could be easily applied in numerical simulations so as to improve even further the accuracy of critical parameter sets derived for simple models , by adding where possible even higher order correction terms . perhaps a more practical application would be the analysis of experimental data for more complex models , where the numerical accuracy of the critical parameter sets is much higher . for example , it has been pointed out that for the analysis of data on spin glasses with known spin , @ xmath24 should be replaced by @ xmath309 in most cases @ xcite . the errors in the htse for these spin glasses are nearly zero for @ xmath24 . the extended scaling approach used for this and with the @ xmath310 + algorithm has also been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of critical parameter ##s derived from numerical simulations @ ising ##lass ##o @ xcite . we would like to thank dr . butera forfor his scientific and technical contributions , m . arisue for his detailed time series analysis , m . hasenbusch for encouraging us to use his very high - resolution experimental data , and m . janke for technical assistance . this project was supported by the grants - in - aid for this research ( no . 17540348 and no . 18079004 ) and naregi nanoscience ##s , obtained from mext of japan . the mathematical calculations were also performed on the sgi computer 2800 / 384 of the computer center , issp , the university of rome . - g . pelissetto and g . vicari , phys . rept . * 368 * 549 ( 2002 ) . m . gartenhaus and j . a . mccullough , phys . b * 38 * , 11688 ( 1988 ) . butera and m . comi , phys . b . b * 38 * , 144431 ( 2002 ) . wegner , phys . b * 38 * 4529 ( 1972 ) . j . bagnuls and j . bervillier , phys . b * 38 * , 1226 ( 1981 ) . m . g. . , t . hukushima and t . takayama , phys . lett . * 31 * , 117202 ( 2006 ) . m . guida and m . zinn - justin , j . phys . b * 31 * , 8103 ( 1998 ) . m . campostrini , m . hasenbusch , m . pelissetto , and m . vicari , phys . b * 31 * , 144506 ( 2006 ) . m . parisi , mathematical _ _ _ _ _ , ( basic books , 1988 ) . m . a . smith and m . e . burford , phys . rev . * 156 * , 583 ( 1967 ) . m . hasenbusch and m . pinn , j . phys . b * 31 * , 6185 ( 1998 ) . m . butera and m . comi , j . stat . phys . * 109 * , 311 ( 2002 ) , j - ph / 0204007 . t . arisue and t . fujiwara , phys . rev . a * 109 * , 066109 ( 2003 ) . m . stauffer , m . ferer and m. wortis , phys . * 29 * , 345 ( 1972 ) . r . j . barber and r . j . jones , phys . * 29 * , 1516 ( 1972 ) . kim , j . j . a . de souza and a . k . kim , phys . b * 31 * , 2291 ( 1996 ) . j . a . gottlob and a . hasenbusch , physica b * 201 * , 593 ( 1993 ) . a . holm and j . janke , phys . b * 50 * , 936 ( 1993 ) . a . butera and m . comi , phys . b * 68 * , 11552 ( 1998 ) . h . deng and j . h . h . blte , phys . b * 68 * , 036125 ( 2003 ) . a . hasenbusch , quantum mechanics . g . campostrini , a . hasenbusch , g . pelissetto , g . rossi , and g . vicari , phys . b * 68 * , 144520 ( 2002 ) . m . daboul , m . cohen and m . aharony , eur . soc . ,* 41 * , 231 ( 2004 ) . katzgraber , j . krner , and j . m . smith , phys . , * 41 * , 224432 ( 2006 ) .
