the micro radio telescope ( mrt ) @ xcite is a frequency hopping , ring - shaped semi - circular telescope operating at 151 . 5 mhz . the telescope was designed to fill the gap in the database of deep sky surveys in the low frequency in the southern hemisphere . the goal of the experiment with mrt is to add to the database of deep sky surveys in the northern ( @ xmath3 ) range @ xmath4 to @ xmath5 , and the entire southern hemisphere ( @ xmath6 ) , with a mean resolution of @ xmath7 and an average _ source angle ( - - @ xmath0 ) of @ xmath8 mjy = @ xmath9 . the _ source angle _ @ xmath10 is given by @ xmath11 , where , @ xmath12 @ xmath13 is the resolution of mrt . mrt has been proposed to be the southern - hemisphere counterpart of the big 6c telescope at 151 . 5 mhz @ xcite . the next generation radio telescopes , including the low frequency array ( lofar ) and the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) , that are being built are low frequency telescopes ;thus indicating a growing interest in large - scale astronomy . the main space exploration objectives are detection , rotation and expansion of the cosmic background medium , studying the high energy stars and galactic ##s , as well as searching for the redshifted origin of molecular clouds from the cosmologically significant epoch of reionisation ( eor ) . the observations made with these instruments will provide new information about galaxies which will also provide a useful tool for studying galaxies and their evolution . mrt observations at 151 . 5 ghz is a step in that direction and , in turn , will provide the whole sky data for nasa . observing the mrt is also done directly on the meridian to address the problem of non - coplanarity . a two - dimensional ( 2 - d ) image , @ xmath6 - @ xmath14 , was produced by taking one - dimensional ( 1 - d ) images of the meridian at different time intervals . images of @ xmath15 , and @ xmath16 of the whole sky , with an rms image in front of @ xmath17 mjy - @ xmath9 ( re - @ xmath0 ) , were produced by @ .##cite . a set of algorithms developed in - house was used to process @ xmath18 hours of the visibility data ( a quarter of the total @ xmath19 hours processed over a period of @ xmath20 hours ) . the deconvolved data and the reference catalogue of @ xmath21 hours were processed by @ xcite . systematic and significant errors were found when the positions of objects belonging to mrt images and the molonglo reference catalogue ( mrc ) @ xcite were processed . @ xcite identified the errors as errors in @ xmath6 and @ xmath14 respectively . by using two different two - dimensional least - squares tests for errors in @ xmath6 and @ xmath14 the errors were found only in the reference catalogue . however , errors remained in the data which limited use of mrt images for multi - dimensional analysis of data . in addition , the source of errors was not identified . in mrt , the visibility data was processed through two different methods of error detection available to the instrument , however , mainly due to the non - coplanarity @ xcite . it was therefore necessary to check for errors in the visibility data and avoid over - processingthe imaging problem . this paper describes the use of 2 - d homography , a technique used in the computer graphics and imaging industries , to correct the errors in the image processing . homography is used to calculate the rotation angle ( which includes rotation , translation and non - uniform rotation ) that accounts for the errors in the resulting gridded 2 - d image . in our opinion , this technique would be of benefit to the future development of applications where , due to low error rates , raw images with a better resolution would be used as compared to raw images @ xcite . this paper also describes our observation of the difficult errors to detect in the array geometry used for imaging . our observation about the array geometry , its time evolution , and re - estimation of the array geometry and its effect on the image is also presented . the rest of the paper is presented as follows . section [ s : poserror ] describes estimates of errors according to mrt , and mrc . the 2 - d homography method is also described in section [ s : homography ] . section [ s : estimation ] describes the estimation process and its results . the re - estimation of mrt array geometry is described in section [ s : arraygeometry ]. finally , we conclude and publish our results in paper [ 2 : 1 ] . the positions of sources common to mrt catalogue and mrc were compared . we chose mrc because of its similarity with mrt catalogue , its difference in resolution compared to other radio sources , and , similar to @ xmath22 . however , for sources of high flux density @ xmath23 jy ( @ 408 mhz ) the accuracy is reported to be not reliable and , the accuracy is reported to be 99 . 99 % @ xcite . for our current data , differences in mrc source location are very significant , without any correlation . about 20 radio sources common to the other catalogue and with flux density @ 151 . 5 mhz less than 23 jy ( @ xmath24 - @ xmath0 ) were identified and their positions were compared . the sources are considered as common if they are distant @ xmath25 of each other . since mrc has a flux density of @ xmath26 / deg @ xmath27 , the odds of considering two radio sources as common are very high . a source density of c - @ xmath0 indicates a source sufficiently distant to accurately perform homography (( see this section ) . the measurement errors in @ xmath6 and @ xmath3 show linear gradient as a function of @ xmath6 ( refer _ first row _ of fig . [ f : sourcecomparison ] a and [ f : sourcecomparison ] b ) . for example , the errors are expressed in terms of mrt beamwidths . the errors in @ xmath6 and @ xmath3 show a linear gradient as a function of @ xmath14 . the errors in @ xmath6 , plotted against @ xmath14 , reach @ xmath28 of the mrt beamwidth ( refer _ first row _ of fig . [ f : sourcecomparison ] a ) . whereas , the errors in @ xmath29 , plotted against @ xmath14 , are linear and reach @ xmath30 of mrt beamwidth . ( refer _ first row _ of fig . [ f : sourcecomparison ] b ) . errors in fig . [ f : sourcecomparison ] c and fig . [ f : sourcecomparison ] d . the magnitude of errors in @ xmat##h6 and @ xmath3 , respectively . the number of errors in @ xmath3 is a larger error compared to errors in @ xmath6 . re - imaging , to correct for errors in the images , would require re - imaging the @ xmath31 block of raw data . due to the time constraints it is necessary to correct for the remaining errors in the images , thus avoiding re - imaging . the 2 - d homography based method is used for correction for errors in images and is described in detail in the next section . the 2 - d linear homography gives a non - singular linear map between points in x . given the values of @ xmath32 corresponding to points in projective space , @ xmath33 , homography maps @ xmath34 to the matrix @ xmath35 @ xcite . where , @ xmath36 . the homography matrix for is the non - singular @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 such that : @ xmath39 = \ left [ \ begin { 1 } { 2 } h ^ { } _ { 12 } & h ^ { } _ { 12 } & h ^ { } _ { 12 }\ \ h ^ { } _ { 21 } & h ^ { } _ { 22 } & h ^ { } _ { 23 } \ \ h ^ { } _ { 31 } & h ^ { } _ { 32 } & h ^ { } _ { 32 } \ end { array } \ right ] \ left [ \ dot { c } { k } h ^ { } _ { k } \ \ h ^ { } _ { k } \ \ left \ end { array } \ right ] . \ dots { q : inhomog } \ ] ] where , @ xmath40 and @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 of @ xmath32 in mrt and mrc respectively , respectively . in the [ q : inhomog ] , @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 are referred to as the _ _ scale _ and are both exactly one dimension higher than the dimension of the vector space . this is a commonly used notation in vector graphics . the simplest example is that with an @ xmath45 , we have : _ scale _ a consists of 2 - dimensional vectors near the origin and _ scale _ them towards and away from the origin . for @ xmath45it is part of _ _ _ the family of 2 - d coordinates . the homogeneous coordinates allow us to write a multiplication as a multiplication . a simple @ xmath46 matrix , with homogeneous coordinates , can allow for rotation , translation and scaling of 2 - d coordinates . for example , from the [ source : inhomog ] , @ xmath47 . 1 , @ xmath48 ( the error in @ xmath6 - dimension ) is now being converted to the simple orthogonal matrix @ xmath49 that also allows rotation and translation . in homogeneous coordinates , the 2 - d projective plane is a smooth curve in the second dimension around the fixed point . the projective homography of , for projective transformations , has 2 degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) . for our example , the errors in @ xmath6 and @ xmath3 have a @ xmath14 - dimension . however , a more general , 2 - d projective transformation is used . since 2 - d projective transformation ( two rotation , two translations and two scaling ) has 2 - dof @ xcite , errors in @ xmath38 , @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 are zero . since the error- a system with 3 - coordinates , a set of 3 equation pairs are required to represent @ xmath38 in the image space . the set of @ xmath32 - equation pairs , represented by @ xmath32 - pairs , is an over - all linear combination : @ xmath52 @ xmath53 \ mbox { , } \ ] ] @ xmath54 ^ { t } \ mbox { and , } \ ] ] @ xmath55 ^ { t } . \ ] ] the entries [ in : [ ] , @ xmath56 are entries of a matrix . this problem can be solved using least squares - based methods . at this point it is necessary to consider the solutions of the ( @ xmath57 ) - equations to estimate the angular variation of the unit sphere . however , it is the square of @ xmath58 , with respect to the center of the sphere , which are the image coordinates of the system . therefore , the image coordinates from which homography should in principle be derived are @ xmath59 . similarly , in mrt , for 2 - dimensional images of the sphere : @ xmath60 ##0 , @xmath14 is a good representation for some of the errors and is not used in the above example . at the moment , the corresponding error @ xmath61 is zero . for other errors , @ xmath62 , find @ xmath61 , i . e . relative to the meridian : @ xmath63 @ xmath64 [ e : sinza ] similarly , @ xmath65 finds the error in @ xmath6 . finding [ e : sinza ] means that an error in @ xmath61 will lead to an error in @ xmath6 with an @ xmath66 - dependence . the 2 - d images of mrt are 1 - d images of the object , with different spatial coordinates and coordinates . therefore , the errors found in @ xmath6 and @ xmath3 do not show up as a result of @ xmath6 ( _ _ _ _ of ##s . [ e : sourcecomparison ] a and [ e : sourcecomparison ] b ) . we need @ xmath42 - dependence because the mrt images were originally stored in this file format . this representation allows us to usecorrections for errors in @ xmath6 are a function of @ xmath14 rather than @ xmath66 . we compared errors in @ xmath6 against both @ xmath66 and @ xmath14 and used two random least - squares fits . the rms of difference between these fits is @ xmath67 of the beamwidth in @ xmath6 . however , the rms of difference between the fitting of @ xmath66 and @ xmath14 and the @ xmath3 fitting of mrt @ xmath68 is only @ xmath69 of the beamwidth in @ xmath6 . therefore , the resulting errors in the fitting function are larger than the errors caused by the previous @ xmath42 - fitting for @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 . for @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 , the @ xmath6 ranges from 24 minutes to 24 hours and the @ xmath14 ranges from @ xmath70 to @ xmath71 ( compared to the error ranges of @ xmath72 to @ xmath73 ) . therefore , thein @ xmath74 ( differential equation [ 1 : 1 ] ) there are values of 1 s & 2 s . if a matrix is ill - conditioned and in the presence of changes in the system parameters , the solution for the over - saturated system will differ from the original solution @ xcite . the property of the ill - conditioned matrix is that it preserves the solution . a conditioning ( or pre - conditioning ) is therefore necessary . to obtain a good approximation of the original solution we use the transformation matrix as in @ xcite . the method loses accuracy for arbitrary values of absolute and absolute values , leading to differential equations of a non linear form . the homography of @ xmath75 is obtained from the matrix using the least - squares method of singular value decomposition ( svd ) . the matrix is then denormalised to points @ xmath38 . the algorithm is then defined as : 1 . * computation of @ xmath76 : * compute the transformation matrix @ xmath77 , consisting of a transformation and transformation , that maps points @ xmath34 to a finite set of points @ xmath78 such that the coordinates of the points @ .##math78 is the inverse of @ xmath79 , and their squared distance from the origin is @ xmath80 . * transformation of @ xmath81 : * performs a similar transformation of @ xmath82 , and transforms @ xmath35 to @ xmath83 . * * homography : * calculate the homography matrix @ xmath75 from the original matrix @ xmath84 using the method described above in the previous section . * denormalisation : * the resulting homography matrix is given by : @ xmath85 [ e : time ] is the total size of the original matrix . in mrt , the total time range for the 4 dimensional images is divided into 4 _ zone _ ( 4 _ _ zone _ _ lit . [ e : sourcecomparison ] a and [ f : sourcecomparison ] b ) . each zone is used with different resolution , to achieve the same decorrelation to @ xmath86 . thus , the total 4 hours of time under consideration , are 4 hours ( @ xmath87 ) . given the resolution of the images , there are several correction schemes tothe mrt algorithm by using : 1 . 5 homography matrices - one for each hour . 2 . 5 matrices - one for each exposure time . 3 . 5 matrices - one for each hour . . . . a single homography matrix for the entire image . in addition , the errors in each image ( @ xmath88 ) can be used to help evaluate the homography matrix . our first experiment to evaluate the image also showed that the homography matrices are independent . the number of errors in @ xmath6 and @ xmath3 compared against @ xmath6 and @ xmath14 ( compared to vs . [ f : sourcecomparison ] a and [ g : sourcecomparison ] b ) shows that the errors are independent of the image processing parameters and the accuracy of @ xmath6 . this means that calculating a single homography matrix for the entire human eye should assist in finding the error . the homography matrix calculated from @ xmath89 _ errors ( discussed in [ [ c : poserror ] ) is : @ xmath90 . \ { { s : matrixvalues } \ ] ] . the original homography matrix , @xmath91 indicates there is no correction required in @ xmath6 as a function of @ xmath6 . @ xmath92 indicates mrt images should be compressed in @ xmath6 with no @ xmath14 correction . the latter value is close to @ xmath93 of the errors in @ xmath6 , at the other end of the @ xmath14 range . however , @ xmath94 indicates that there is no correction required in @ xmath14 , as a function of @ xmath6 . similarly , @ xmath95 indicates that mrt images should be compressed in @ xmath14 by a factor of 0 . 9990 ( which makes @ xmath1 slightly in error ) . the values of @ xmath48 and @ xmath96 indicate that the estimated cross - section of errors in both @ xmath6 and @ xmath14 , against @ xmath14 is close to the @ xmath14 of the original images ( mrc1932 - 464 ) required for compression . in the [ 1 : inhomog ] , the homography method is used to determinemove away from the image to a new image , while checking for additional errors . fig . [ f : sourcecomparisoncorrect ] shows the errors in @ xmath3 and homography - after correction . a comparison of these images with fig . [ f : sourcecomparison ] shows that homography has reduced the error and the # ##s to within 15 % of the beamwidth for the image - - @ xmath0 , as shown . [ f : scatterplot ] a and fig . [ f : scatterplot ] b show two sets of errors in @ xmath3 against errors in @ xmath6 , and after correction , respectively . for each , the errors are represented as functions of the mrt beamwidths . before , after correction ( refer fig . [ f : scatterplot ] b ) the rms is more accurate as compared to the before correction ( refer fig . [ f : scatterplot ] c ) . the rms before correction is @ xmath97 of the beamwidth . after correction , the rms is equal to @ xmath98 of the beamwidth and , the rmsthey have been combined . [ f : contourplots ] a and [ f : contourplots ] b have mrt images before and after them , respectively , based on sumss ( massey - molonglo observatory telescope ) and @ xcite , for a source around @ xmath99 . the two mrt - images in fig . [ f : contourplots ] b overlap with the ones in sumss fig . [ f : contourplots ] c and [ f : contourplots ] d show similar overlap for a source around @ xmath100 . in fig . [ f : sourcecomparison ] d , since the sources around @ xmath100 are within 1 % of the beamwidth , the images in the fig . [ f : contourplots ] c and [ f : contourplots ] d show a similar overlap as well and homography has been a significant contributor to them at this time . we have combined mrt images for a number of radio sources around 843 mhz provided by @ xcite . [ f : contourplotsextsources ] is a reference .of mrt survey and sumss observations of the regions of the galaxy abell 3667 . the result is perceivably accurate . the 3 - d homography reveals the remaining errors in the visibility domain . for imaging the regions @ xmath101 hours of mrt survey , @ xmath102 hours of observations had to be corrected . therefore , for imaging the same regions , we would have to identify the source of these errors and correct them in the image . in the next section we describe how we identified the source of errors and corrected them in the visibility domain . this section presents our _ error - correction _ method for the source of errors in our image . the exact values we calculated and applied to correct the errors are not known . for short arc images , @ xmath103 . the angular diameter of the galaxy is a function of @ xmath14 and the corresponding values are for the components of the north - south ( x ) - axis . @ xmath104 is a fourier transform @ xcite . a scaling factor of @ xmath105 and @ xmath106 will result in a scaling factor of @ xmath107is the @ xmath104 - component of the baseline vector . after further analysis , it is found that mrt components are stretch ( _ expanded _ ) by length , i . e . , @ xmath108 @ xmath109 [ e : expcomp ] factor , for example the 3 - d homography has a stretch ( _ expanded _ ) factor , @ xmath107 , of 0 . 9990 . this corresponds to the fact that we have extended the north - south baseline vector . the [ e : expcomp ] factor is , the baseline vector of @ xmath110 m in the ns arm is correctly interpreted as @ xmath111 m ( 1 m of length ) . therefore , the @ xmath14 - - component of @ xmath6 corresponds to two @ xmath104 - components of the east - west ( ec ) baseline vector . next , we perform the pre - analysis of the parameters . we start with a brief description of the parameters of operation with mrt . mrt has 12 fixed antennas in the ec arm and 12 fixed antenna arrays in the ns arm . for all antennas , thethe different positions are calculated by positioning them over 1 km with an intra - antenna distance of 32 km ( to avoid replacement of one trolley by another ) . mrt measures the spatial components of the brightness ratio of the antenna in 15 different directions ( referred to as _ _ _ ) to 5 db for every 1 km . thus , theoretically , there are 945 different antennas ( 15 allocations * 15 antennas / m² ) on the sensing network and a total of 1 , 240 ( 945 * 15 ) which are used for sensing . a small error in the length ratio of a sensing antenna is expected to show up clearly when measuring the performance of the instrument . this error would be reflected in the instrumental phases estimated using two calibrators . in addition , the instrumental phases estimated using two calibrators with different outputs , for a given instrument , should be the same , except for temporal errors in the instrumental phases . the non - linear error in these phases could be due to the design of the instrument or choice of calibrators . as mentioned above , our understanding of spatial errors in measurements and the homography is limited to spatial errors in sources ( see reference positions ) . the followingtheory of relativity @ xcite is used to estimate errors in the measurement and are shown below . the true instrumental phases , @ xmath112 , from the measurement with direction @ xmath113 , applied to calibrator @ xmath114 with direction of @ xmath115 , is given by : @ xmath116 where , @ xmath117 represents true instrumental phases , @ xmath118 represents n antennas and @ xmath119 represents m antennas . for space ##borne ##s , [ e : obsphasebasiceqn ] where : @ xmath120 the instrumental phases , @ xmath121 , calculated from the observed data are given by : @ xmath122 where , @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 are errors in the instrumental phase respectively . @ xmath121 gives estimates of the energy being lost in the course of measurement . the [ e : calphaserelation ] has many solutions . to minimize the number of errors , we can estimate the true instrumental phases by performing a measurement @ xmath125 of the instrumental phases . in the calib##rators . this equation is : @ xmath126 } \ nonumber \ \ \ lefteqn { \ hspace { \ } } + \ { za ^ { } _ { ij } \ right [ \ left \ left ( za ^ { \ mathcal { s } ^ { } _ { 1 } } \ right ) - \ left \ right ( za ^ { \ mathcal { s } ^ { } _ { 1 } } \ right ) \ right ] . } \ label { e : diff1 } \ dot { s } \ ] ] however , the @ xmath127 - values of the baseline ##s are discrete and non - linear values . so , in general , we can express @ xmath124 - root - free squared error with linear ##ity . equation [ e : diff1 ] in that case can be expressed as : @ xmath128 . \ label { e : simplediff1 } \ ] ] expressing the error in terms of errors in baseline ##s , as compared to errors in baseline ##s , equation [ e : simplediff1 ] is : @ xmath129 . \ label { e : diffante##nna1 } \ ] ] this model is still not able to account for errors in the antenna measurements . we have two known and one unknown . we set up the baseline with a single calibrator vector , @ xmath130 , given out by : from @ xmath131 and @ xmath132 : @ xmath133 . \ to { et : diffantenna2 } \ ] ] the equations [ et : diffantenna1 ] and [ et : diffantenna2 ] are a complete set of equations for each measurement . for the measurements and the data , the set of equations can be written in the following form and solved by svd - based least - squares methods : @ xmath134 where , the _ _ vector _ @ xmath135 has to be determined . then , @ xmath136 . the measurement vector _ @ xmath137 and @ xmath138 are for 100 ns and 945 # ##e ##q , respectively . the vector _ @ xmath139 consists of two sub - vectors , @ xmath140 and @ xmath141 , given by theright - hand - side of the [ q : diffantenna1 ] and [ w : diffantenna2 ] , respectively . here , @ xmath142 , i . e . , the total number of antennas counted for time . here , @ xmath143 . the _ data matrix _ @ xmath144 . each entry in the data matrix has only two non - zero entries , corresponding to the region represented by one x and one # ##w , making it very simple . the gain response is calculated from the frequency response of the antenna obtained from calibrators mrc0407 - 658 ( @ xmath145 ) , mrc0915 - 118 ( @ xmath146 ) and mrc1932 - 464 ( @ xmath147 ) . the gain per antenna in mrt is @ xmath148 jy for a 1 ghz signal and an integration time of 1 second . it takes @ xmath149 seconds of time for antennas in @ xmath150 to integrate , given @ xmath151 the beamwidth of sources in the east - west direction . this corresponds to a 1per second ( minus the non - linear force applied to the antenna ) of @ xmath152 jy . the current density of these two calibrators as measured by mrt is @ xmath153 jy ; enough to give accurate measurements . however , the calibrators are expensive and come from multiple manufacturers and lack any specific antenna configuration @ xcite . a table of the phase differences obtained from the array of calibrators @ xmath154 is shown in fig . [ f : phasediff ] . fig . [ f : error _ estimate ] a shows the phase difference between 945 different antenna positions . the errors show a gradient of 1 part in degrees along the z axis . this agrees with the linear ##ity of the phase differences obtained from the calibrators . the errors in fig . [ f : error _ estimate ] b show linear ##s of the two antennas of the w arm in the ns - direction . the error shows a gradient of only 1 part in 10 , 000 . this indicates that the w arm is non - linear from the same ns - direction . at the far end ( 1 ##° from the center of the antenna ) of the w arm thethis is @ xmath155 error , due to the angular deviation of @ xmath156 from the rest of the array . this is the result of a small @ xmath14 - dependent error in @ xmath6 that was confirmed by both the error analysis and the homography matrix . therefore , our comparison of the original image of @ xmath6 with the corrected antenna position and the two new antenna positions will show this @ xmath14 - dependent error in @ xmath6 . using the same method , we have re - constructed one image from the array and have now constructed a completely new array . we found no errors in the image , confirming our re - constructed array correctly . the homography - matrix analysis was able to correct for hundreds of small errors in the image , and the errors are within 1 % of the beamwidth for images @ 0 - @ xmath0 . the resulting images of the array are available for viewing at _ http : / / www . rri . nasa . org / images / mrt _ . the error analysis shows that the mrt images are available at the##lination of @ xmath1 , in 1000 . this led to an estimate of the ns baseline vectors , in the frequency domain . the estimates also showed an @ xmath14 - error error in @ xmath6 . this pointed towards the error in our estimate of the array geometry . by performing a linear regression , using the parameters obtained from two well known calibrators whose parameters are well known , the array geometry was re - estimated . the estimated error in the @ xmath104 - error of the ns baseline vectors is about 100 m / s . in other words , the error is about half a second at 150 feet ( 46 m ) for a 100 ns antenna . the estimates also showed a small ( 1 error in 10 , 000 ) @ xmath104 - error in the 4 ns baseline vectors . this indicates that the beam axis is re - aligned and , at the end of @ xmath2 , to the main beam axis . these estimates agree with the original results of mrt , used in both the corrected image analysis and the homography analysis . with the new data , we have re - aligned the antenna from the baseline and have now obtained a completely different ste##radian . we found no error in the errors . this is our well - established image resolution . re - imaging the steradian array from space would have been a very time consuming task . use of 3 - d homography - based techniques allows us to compensate for the many errors in the image resolution . in our view , this new technology will be of benefit to the next generation space telescope where , due to low data volumes , raw images at a given time would be available as compared to raw data . soobash daiboo received a research award from the south african square kilometre array association . the association would like to thank the invited authors for the detailed analysis and .
