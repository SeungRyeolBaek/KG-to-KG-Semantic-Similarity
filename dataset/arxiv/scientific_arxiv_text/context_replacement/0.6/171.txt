waves travelling in a curved spacetime have ` ` tails ' ' . in fact , it is well known that the _ classical _ non - classical tail of massless waves travelling in black - hole spacetimes has a power - law tail . price @ xcite was the first to describe the process by which the spacetime of a ( non - ) classical bubble drains itself of its radiative multipole moments , and leaves behind a schwarzschild black hole ; it was found that the radiative moments go away as an inverse function of time . thus , these inverse power - law tails are associated with the propagation of waves along the mean normal vector at the closed point @ xcite . the work of price was extended by other researchers . bik @ xcite extended the theory and described the behavior of the gravitational field in the _ local _ reissner - nordstrm spacetime . he also found an _ inverse power - law tail of the field , with the _ - _ - notation , in the schwarzschild spacetime ( with the exception of the _ extremal _ reissner - nordstrm black hole @ x##cite ) . in a later demonstration , price @ xcite showed that the late - time tail can be associated with the presence of a small value in the ' s constant for the wave - function . gundlach , price , and pullin @ xcite showed that these local power - law tails can explain the late - time tails of radiative collapse at half - life , and at the black - hole phase boundary . furthermore , they showed that power - law tails are a common feature of gravitational waves the existence of these tails was confirmed by a non - linear functional analysis of the highly nonlinear components of the non - linear gravitational wave @ xcite ( this was later published in @ xcite ) . our current understanding of the late - time tail is , however , very limited . the ( _ _ late _ ) power - law tails in black - hole spacetimes are well understood @ xcite , but the corresponding signals are not very clear at _ _ late _ time . in a slow system , there is a short time interval in which the signal is no longer dominated by the quasinormal tail @ xcite , and the corresponding local power - law tail has not yet taken hold @ xcite . thepurpose of this definition is to provide empirical support for the _ higher - order corrections _ which ` ` contaminated ' ' the well - defined power - law tail of a perfectly symmetric gravitational field . the determination of these higher - order corrections is done from two points of view : the work of bik @ xcite and gundlach et . @ xcite exploits the fact that the first - order power - law tail is _ inverse _ in the sense that it is _ inverse _ of the black - hole electric charge ( i . e . , the power index of _ _ _ _ reissner - nordstrm spacetime was found to be identical with the one obtained by b @ xcite for the original schwarzschild black hole ) . this result raises the question : what effect ( if any ) does the black - hole electric charge have in the absence of gravity ? however , the determination of higher - order corrections to the first order power - law tail is also of fundamental importance ; this is also useful for the determination of the power index from numerical analysis . the _ inverse power - law tail is _ ` ` contaminated ' ' _ by higher - order corrections , whose effect becomes greater as the aveliable rate of gravity increases . the above definitionit is accurate only over very - long times . thus , in general , the _ time _ range of integration presents an enormous difficulty in the calculation of the error factor . the most efficient way to _ correct _ the errors which are caused by the finite time error is to compute _ higher - order corrections _ . if one uses the second term of the higher - order error , then the ratio of the error to the higher order corrections gives a clear , accurate , indication of the error caused by the _ finite _ - time _ error . these problems and many others are addressed in the following paper . the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec . [ sec2 ] we give a mathematical description of the solar system and of the evolution of _ . in sec . [ sec3 ] we give an exact description of the long - time evolution of gravitational fields in black - hole spacetimes . in sec . [ sec4 ] we present our experimental results using numerical methods . we conclude in sec . [ sec5 ] with a brief summary of our results and their implications . we describe the evolution of a perfectly symmetric massless gravitational field around a perfectly - symmetric object ( a neutron star or a massive black hole ) . the resulting gravitational fieldof a spherical ##ly charged particle of mass @ xmath4 and charge @ xmath5 , given by the reissner - nordstrm equation @ xmath6 in the radial - coordinate @ xmath7 , which is given by @ xmath8 , the second term reads @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 . the wave equation @ xmath11 for the gravitational field in the black - box model reads @ xmath12 where @ xmath13 in terms of the radial coordinate @ xmath7 and for @ xmath14 the gravitational field \ . ( [ eq4 ] ) reads @ xmath15 the exact solution to the wave - equation ( [ eq3 ] ) can be written as a function based on two different values @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 @ xcite @ xmath18 } \ . \ { { x } \ ] ] where @ xmath19 is a basic time coordinate and @ xmath20 is an elementary space coordinate . for the value @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 is the @ xmath23th component of @ xmath##24 ; higher - order solutions need to be expressed as follows . the first two terms in fig . ( [ eq6 ] ) represent the first - order solution ( with @ xmath25 ) . the star begins to collapse at some fixed time @ xmath26 . the null line of the stellar surface is close to the ingoing null line @ xmath27 , and the variation of the field on the stellar surface is therefore slightly redshifted @ xcite . this variation is determined by the phase difference between falling frames and infalling frames . a typical astronomical observer describes the fields on the stellar surface as ` ` changing ' ' as the star leaves the surface . therefore , one assumes that the processes are held constant . we then make the general assumption that at some fixed time @ xmath28 becomes @ xmath27 . this assumption has been shown to be very correct @ xcite . we start with the initial phase of the collapse , i . e . , the variation of the field on the star @ xmath29 . the first two terms in fig . ( [ eq6 ] ) represent the standing wave of the wave function , andthe frequency of the radiation . the significance of these # ##s _ parameters comes from the fact that they depend on data spread out over the _ s _ of the entire electromagnetic spectrum , whereas primary waves depend only on data from a fixed @ xmath30 @ xcite . after the arrival of the primary wave there is no new data for @ xmath31 , apart from secondary waves . this implies that @ xmath32 . thus , for a fixed @ xmath7 and @ xmath33 , the first term in fig . ( [ eq6 ] ) is @ xmath34 . the terms @ xmath35 satisfy the following relation @ xmath36 for @ xmath37 , where @ xmath38 , and @ xmath39 . thus , one has @ xmath40g ^ { ( - 1 ) } ( x _ 2 ) \ , [ x + [ ( x / 2 ) \ . ] \ . \ ] ] this is the average frequency of the secondary waves . with this definition of the function for @ xmath41 , we shall first consider the time evolution of the function . we turn our inputto the regions @ xmath42 , @ xmath43 . in this case the spacetime is curved as in @ xcite . ( the accuracy of this approximation is easily confirmed by computer simulations ) . thus , the expression for @ xmath44 can be written as @ xmath45 . ex . ( [ eq8 ] ) with the initial conditions for @ xmath41 ex . ( [ eq7 ] ) , one finds @ xmath46 where @ xmath47 for early times @ xmath48 we can expand @ xmath49 and then for @ xmath50 . using these coefficients we can expand ex . ( [ eq8 ] ) { @ xmath51 } \ , \ ] ] where the coefficients @ xmath52 are those determined by @ xcite . using the initial conditions for regions @ xmath53 ( such as @ xmath54 , for the region of a black hole , and also @ xmath55 for a solar system ) , one finds that for many times the coefficients @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 will be of the same form ( see @ xcite for more details ) .thus , we know that @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 we can conclude that the late - time behaviour of the field for @ xmath60 is @ xmath61 \ , [ [ + 1 ( 1 / 2 ) \ , ] \ . \ big { 1 } \ ] ] this is the late - time behaviour of the field for a given value . it is possible to calculate it . ( [ eq3 ] ) using the method used in @ xcite . we have obtained , however , a modified version of the source method used in @ xcite , which is able to achieve the very high precision required for the calculation ( see @ xcite for more details ) . the late - time behaviour of the new field is independent of the quality of the experimental data obtained . the results given below are for the new field [ @ xmath62 @ xmath63 ^ { { } \ , \ } \ , \ ] ] with a peak at @ xmath64 and a trough @ xmath65 . the black - body parameter is approximately equal to @ xmath66 ; this corresponds to the ability to estimate the field for the maximum value of . the newbehavior of the system at a fixed time @ xmath67 is shown in the top panel of fig . the local _ power - index _ falls into the system at some time t . in order to understand the # ##s of first - order [ ( [ eq14 ] ) ] , we use the notation of the _ local power index _ @ xmath68 , given by @ xmath69 @ xcite . taking advantage of sec . ( [ eq14 ] ) we have @ xmath70 the relationship of the local power index to the well - known numerical expression @ xmath71 is shown in the top panel of fig . the figure shows that @ xmath72 from above , with a good approximation with sec . ( [ eq16 ] ) . in order to understand _ _ _ the vector is shown in fig . [ sec3 ] , we use the notation @ xmath73 . see [ fig2 ] . consider @ xmath74 as a function of @ xmath75 for two points of equal area @ xmath76 , and @ xmath77 ( from above to( ) . the experimental value @ xmath78 ( regardless of the value of @ xmath7 ) is in perfect agreement with the _ theoretical _ value _ @ xmath79 [ see fig . ( [ eq16 ] ) ] . see , fig . [ fig2 ] . note the nature of the corrections _ of _ @ xmath0 . it should be noted that the value of @ xmath80 ##0 in this paper is @ xmath81 rather than the theoretical value @ xmath82 . this slight deviation from the theoretical value is probably due to the lack of reference @ xmath83 in the table for @ xmath68 ##3 . ( [ eq16 ] ) . the purpose of this paper is to provide the expression for the _ first - order corrections _ which ` ` cancel ' ' the well - known power - law decay of a perfectly uniform magnetic field . we have shown , both experimental and theoretical , that the _ correction dies out at late time at @ xmath0 . this late - time decay of the correction is much _ faster _ than has been observed so far @ xcite ( see the table in appendix )) . apart from being _ theoretical _ important , the following fig . ( [ eq14 ] ) is also of _ theoretical _ importance . it shows that an ` accurate ' ( accurate ) determination of the power index requires extremely long integration times . the most efficient method for determining the power index tail leads to the determination of the _ total _ power index . in this way one avoids the extremely heavy error which dominates the first part of the theorem . however , it follows from fig . ( [ eq16 ] ) that the determination of the power index to be @ xmath1 requires an integration time of 1 @ xmath84 . the _ power - index tail is shown to be invariant in the sense that it is _ independent _ of the black - hole charge @ xcite . we have shown , however , that this property is lost when we apply higher - order methods . the first _ value of the black - hole force _ field _ appears at @ xmath3 . * * * we invited tsvi piran for help . this project was funded by a grant from the national science foundation . this follows from fig . ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [eq9 ] ) , and ( [ eq12 ] ) that the total curvature of the field at the two points @ xmath85 ( i . e . , for @ xmath86 ) and @ xmath87 we can get the curvature of the field at the black - hole event , @ xmath88 . for @ xmath89 the curvature of e . ( [ eq4 ] ) is very small , and the exact solution to e . ( [ eq3 ] ) can be written as @ xmath90 . for @ xmath91 we get @ xmath92 ( for @ xmath93 ) . therefore , @ xmath94 must be a constant , and with no loss of information we can take it to be constant . we can write @ xmath95 for @ xmath96 and @ xmath97 in order to get the @ xmath98 solution e . ( [ eqa2 ] ) with the @ xmath99 solution e . ( [ eq14 ] ) , we get the ansatz @ xmath100 $ ]for the solutions in the regions @ xmath98 and @ xmath96 . in other words , we assume that the solution in the @ xmath98 region has the same # ##nt @ xmath75 value as the @ xmath14 region . this assumption has been shown to be very accurate for the first order solutions of the neutral @ xcite and neutral @ xcite regions . under this assumption , one gets @ xmath101 $ ] , where @ xmath102 is a constant . thus , the approximate behaviour of the field in the black - hole region is @ xmath103 \ . \ ] ] the first attempt to find first - order solutions to the classical power - law problem was done by andersson @ xcite ( in the context of the schwarzschild spacetime ) . this method was based on the _ approximate _ curvature potential in the region far ##thest from the black hole [ see fig . ( 1 ) of @ xcite ] . since this curvature potential allowed the calculation , it also _ contains _ the _ first order corrections term . the first order corrections term @ xcite was found to be of size @ xmath104 .this ( exact ) result is explained by the fact that terms of order @ xmath105 ( and above ) are completely replaced by the exact curvature potential used in @ xcite . however , the approximate approach used in @ xcite , _ if _ travelling along the same path to a reissner - nordstrm spacetime would require that the effect of the two - body electric field on the space - time will vanish _ of _ ( i . e . , it would reduce to _ of _ for @ @ xmath106 ) . this result is also a direct consequence of the fact that the approximate approach of @ xcite does not take into account the terms of order @ xmath107 ( and @ xmath108 ) which appear in the ( exact ) curvature potential . the evolution of the electric field , begins with @ xmath67 in a schwarzschild spacetime with @ xmath66 . the observed results show a uniform distribution with @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 . the _ power - law _ ##back is observed at # ##ncy ( top panel ) . the bottom panel shows the evolution of the _ power law@ xmath111 . the power of [ the well - known prediction value @ xmath112 at late times . , width = 642 ] the time values of the terms @ xmath73 , , , @ xmath113 , and @ xmath77 ( from bottom to top ) . the prediction value @ xmath78 is in perfect agreement with the _ well _ known value @ xmath79 at late times . this also implies the power of the second power of [ @ xmath0 . , width = 642 ]
