jet spiral galaxies ( csos ) are a class of compact spiral galaxies comprising about 10 % of jet - driven galaxies observed at radio wavelengths ( taylor , readhead , & pearson 1996 ; pearson & pearson 2001 ) . their defining feature is the presence of high energy jet components on both sides of the jet , at sub - kiloparsec distances with little or no radio emission present . csos also have large jets which move along at subluminal speeds ( owsianik & conway 1998 ; gugliucci et al . ) components that exist between the jets and the bright regions where they meet , tend to split apart , and superluminal portions of the jets are observed in a few cases ( taylor , readhead & pearson 2000 ) . the jets may be brighter or even brighter than the counterjets . csos on the whole exhibit low radio emission , with low radio emission and high radio absorption . their members are most general radio galaxies ( readhead et al . 1996 ) but there are a few notable exceptions associated with seyferts and others . the general consensus that has emerged is that csos are young radio galaxies , with ages between 100 and 2000 years . since they are unusual for thebecause of the unbeamed proto - stars and galaxies , their orientation on the sky is unknown . they can also indicate the presence of intrinsic spin ##ons ( gugliucci et al . 2007 ) , or emission from the gas associated with the core nucleus and the gas that surrounds the stellar core and is assumed to be oriented perpendicular to the galactic axis ( muller et al . 2000 ; pihlstrm et al . 2003 ) . however , since the two possibilities are not obvious , we have the added advantage of measuring the distance from both sides of the sky . csos offer a unique way to measure the gravitational constant , and a direct measurement of the distance to an object can be obtained by measuring its motion through space , if the relative angular velocity can be measured directly . thus , it uses the time scale of the standard model , with the additional restriction that the angular velocity must be slower than this . from two years of observations of the cso 1946 + 708 . 5 , muller & vermeulen ( 1997 ) found a mean value of h @ xmath4 @ xmath2 / - h @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 . we know what can befar from doing this is obtaining more accurate data . we can use this classification system , for which the size of the stars can be easily determined , to determine the nature of their structure . kinematic parameters for the radio emissions from csos can be determined by measuring the relative distance between the bright sources over time and relating this to the relative phase distribution ( owsianik & conway 1998 ; gugliucci et al . 2005 ) . at the present , the cso age distribution appears to be disproportionally biased towards bright sources . however , there are a number of other factors that need to be considered before the entire data set can be accurately interpreted . older sources are well - known from vlbi data so that determining the age is easy ; the slower moving sources require longer time intervals to determine accurate ages . in this section we describe observations of the cso 1946 + 708 over many years . it is of great importance to use this line of research to determine the age of individual sources . we ##c @ xmath1 = 1 . ##c @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 and the resulting model assumes that c = 1 . 835 kpc and an orbital velocity of 2 km / year = 1 .and also at the center ( 0 . 1008 ) of the gravitational wave 1946 + 708 ( taylor & taylor 2001 ) . the observations were carried out at 12 . 4 ghz and 15 . 4 ghz over the course of five days , starting in 1995 december 31 , 1996 january 07 , 1998 march 06 , 1999 april 11 , 2001 may 11 , and at 15 . 4 ghz again in 2003 jan 9 / 2003 feb 11 , 2006 mar 12 , and 2008 mar 21 ( see table below ) . observations in 1995 , 1998 , and 2001 were observed using all ten elements of the vlba of the nrao , and observations from 2003 only were observed using the phased array using all ten elements of the vlba , and the telescopes from the european vlbi network ( evn ) , the 10 cm telescope at effelsberg , the westerbork phased array , onsala , medicina , and in 2003 only , the telescope at noto . due to problems at the st . croix and long island observatory , observations in 1996 and 1999 were observed using two vlba elements each . problems in 2003 prevented effelsberg from observing . only right and left hand observations were made for the first two days , andthe other two where used only in a single epoch . these two used 16 bit channels with if intervals of 2 mhz . the vlba correlator used 16 bit channels across the if during the 2 mhz interval . we also include in our list the 15 ghz observations made between 1992 and 1995 by smith & vermeulen ( 1997 ) , all of which are consistent with the 5 . 5 and 6 ghz observations described above . parallactic interference ##s arising from the near - field antenna system were measured using the aips and clcor . phase information for each station was derived from measurements of antenna height and system speed during the interval . changes in the system speed were measured using the aips and fring ( schwab & smith 1983 ) . this was performed by analyzing the multi - station data set up prior to the development , processing , deconvolution and self - analysis of difmap ( smith , pearson , & smith 1994 , 1995 ) . several stages of amplitude self - analysis and analysis were applied to each station before an attempt at phase self - analysis was made . the same techniques developed for difmap were then applied to aips toand additional measurements , to measure the phase losses in the rcp and lcp components and to look for the phase changes in them . these measurements and self - adjustment were performed in difmap . the fitting of the components to the self - adjusted visibility data was also performed in difmap . the shapes of the components were determined by fitting to the 1995 data ; for the rest of the observations each component was allowed freely to rotate and to vary in spectral intensity in order to fit the final self - adjusted visibility data . each other component ( 5 , 8 . 4 and 9 . 5 ghz ) was modelfit , in order to account for differences in the shapes of them . for our first three observations from 2003 to 2008 , for the 8 . 4 ghz observations , an additional set of components had to be fitted to each side of the spectrum ( epoch 5 . 4 ) . differences in the shapes and sizes for them are derived from signal - to - noise ratio and component size ( fomalont 1999 ) . this implies that they are not independent , which should be the case for the two , well - defined components that we observed at this epoch of 1946 + 708 . if .of the few stars to be classified as a bona - fide stellar binary star , 1946 + 708 is in a few respects unusual for this type . the jet is ' ` ` lines ' ' hot ( see figure 1 and 2 ) . large , strongly curved jets originate from a large , dark central disk and rotate clockwise before terminating in well defined hot spots . the ` ` lines ' ' of emission are seen from the ##Â° to the jet . emission lines from the jet are seen to extend outward from the jet to the hot spots on both the northern ( jet ) side and the southern ( non - jet ) side . our most complete , accurate , and high resolution set of images is that of 8 . 4 ghz . the 8 . 4 ghz images cover the period from march 1995 to march 2008 , and show flux ##es ranging from 163 @ xmath5jy / beam , to 200 @ xmath5jy / beam ( figure 1 ) . no magnetic flux has been observed from 1946 + 708 at either 8 . 4 or 8 . 4 ghz at any time . figure 1 @ xmath6 based on the highly precise magnetic flux 1 @ xmath7100 @ xmath5jy @ 8 . 41 and @ xmath7170 @ xmath5jy or 1 . 23 c . this process is fairly common in the presence of strong and weak jet streams . in addition to the previously mentioned components n2 / s2 and n5 / s5 , we focus now on the discovery of a new set of components which we call n6 / s6 ( no . 1 ) . unlike the previous two , these new components appear to have been observed together as a pair , and appear to be moving away from the core in both directions . the apparent distance between the two components ( n6 and s6 ) measured in our 2008 epoch is 1 . 288 mas . the exact relative distance between n6 and s6 and the core is difficult to determine due to the distance of these components with the core , but the apparent distance can be compared with the 2006 epoch in which it was 1 . 045 mas . the annual mean exchange rate between the components over the past 10 years stands at 1 . 238 mas / year or 1 . 23 c . this puts the exchange rate for the two components at 1997 . 1 . further details of the new data set can be found in the 2003 epoch , and to a lesser extent in 2001 . the discovery ofthe overall expansion rate and the mass fraction of the jet components n6 and s6 during this period ( fig . 3 ) are increasing rapidly , and this appears to be decreasing later on , as the new components move further away from the core . in fig . 4 we estimate the velocity of the four known jet components ( n2 , n5 , s5 and s2 ) , from modelfitting using gaussians to the confidence level of 1 . 08 au . the well - known jet components closest to the core , n5 and s5 , appear to start out with the same apparent velocity ( figure 4 and fig . 5 ; and see also the moviegbtaylor / ] ) , with n5 being the component with an apparent velocity of 1 . 088 au , and s5 moving about three times that in very nearly the same plane . note that these are optical data projected into the plane of the jet , as opposed to real , two - dimensional data . the most distant pair of components ( n2 / s2 ) appears to be moving at about twice the apparent velocity of the nearest ( n5 / s5 ) component . from this , we should be able to conclude that the jet starts out at and .##elerates with [UNK] . if this is the case , and the jet is split , then we would expect to see the n5 / s5 pair break up , but this is not possible . even after several months of observation and a distance of up to 90 % of the radius of the jet , there is no direct evidence for separation of any of the components . the @ xmath8 values are remarkably good compared to a straight line for both components ( the @ xmath8 values would be much higher in inclination than in right ascension due to the north - south orientation of some of the jets ) . if the components split , then the n5 / s5 pair would match up with the n2 / s2 pair , @ xmath075 ##0 , according to the time that they entered the collision zone . alternatively , it could be that there is a sudden separation of the two components at a distance from the core between 6 . 5 and 10 mas ( in the southern hemisphere ) . this distance was estimated as the minimum distance of 6 mas for n2 in 1995 and the maximum distance for n5 starting in 2008 . this is probably the region where the jet enters the core ( @ xmath9 )towards the central bright spot , in the second , should not be ruled out either . for the other pair of components , n6 / s6 , their combined rotational velocity difference is 0 . 72c , larger than that of the n2 / s2 pair ( 0 . 66 c ) , than the n5 / s5 pair ( 0 . 65 c ) . observations of the 10 @ xmath05 period should resolve the question of whether they emerge with their own , repeating pattern of motion , or if they emerge with a fixed pattern of acceleration and rotation . if there is a fixed , repeating pattern , then it may be possible to apply this to a galactic jet model . in a galactic jet , the rotational velocity could remain constant but the pattern changes over time to explain the large variations in the observed rotational velocity . such a model accurately describes the rotational velocity of 1946 + 708 and has been used to explain observations over many regions of the galactic jet including ss433 ( johnston et al . 2008 , hjellming & johnson 1981 ) . the orbits of the two main components of 1946 + 708 ( n5 and s5 ) , are sufficiently stable to explain the observedfrom the sun . there is a suggestion of a change in the direction of n5 near the 2006 epoch ( epoch 7 in fig . 4 ) , but this depends almost entirely on the position of the 2008 epoch . for the more distant southern hemisphere ( n2 ) there are changes in the jet direction between the 1994 , 2001 and 2006 ( epoch 6 , 8 and 9 in fig . 4 ) . there also appears to be an offset at the 5 ghz position ( in fact . this shows a dark region on the far side of this ) . a similar effect is suggested by the multi - phase phase shift of s2 jets on the 5 and 6 ghz positions , but since the components are larger and the gradient is smaller it is impossible to be sure if the temperature gradient is reversed . another bend was observed in the s2 near the 2003 epoch ( epoch 8 in fig . 4 ) . in well known non - spiral galaxies , such as 3c345 ( zensus et al . 1995 , unwin et al . 1997 ) , the components are observed to move along different directions and to accelerate their velocity . this phenomenon has been used as evidence for gravity wave jets , as opposed to the hydrodynamical jets ( vlak##his & konigl 2004 ) . by comparison with these core - jet observations , we reach a general conclusion that the jets of 1946 + 708 are likely to be very stable . note , however , that the sizes of the jets in core - jet agns are typically in the range @ xmath10 , much larger than we find in the cso 1946 + 708 of 2 . 3 @ xmath11 ##2 . 5 ( see figure ) . even though the jet of 1946 + 708 was observed only at 10 ghz initially , the first two observations at 10 ghz confirmed its existence by the bi - directional motion away from the core of the jet . given these observations and the size of the jet ( fig . 1 and 2 ) , it is reasonable to assume that n5 and s5 were observed at the same time , and not n2 and s2 . however , we are close enough to find the jets of n6 and s6 in @ xmath01997 as described above . further observations at 5 . 5 ghz ( see fig . 2 ) , show that there is an exit from the core close to the hot jets . the jet is probably also made up of gas .that can be easily explained by the standard jet flow that we use and modelfit . suppose the jet appears to be a continuous flow , with components of apparent velocity ( acceleration ? ) that pass through the jet . under the assumption that components are ejected in parallel , and that the shocks are due to pressure difference and light travel time difference , we can use the observed apparent motion ratios and angles to account for the observed apparent velocity and angles . for two jet components ejected in opposite directions at an angle @ xmath12 to the line of sight and an opposite angle @ xmath13 , it follows that from the light travel time difference that the ratio of the apparent motions from the side ( @ xmath14 for the approaching side , @ xmath15 for the outgoing side ) as well as the ratio of apparent directions ( approaching : @ xmath16 , outgoing : @ xmath17 ) are given at the origin : ( taylor & vermeulen 1997 ) : @ xmath18 our only necessary condition that the apparent directions @ xmath13 and @ xmath12 can be determined from the direction of @ xmath19 , is that due to the geometry of the reference frame. from this and the change of velocity to zero , we get : @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 is the particle relative velocity , @ xmath22 is the particle velocity relative to the source , and @ xmath23 is the angle . note that fig . 2 has a similar equation , whereas fig . 1 does not , so we can substitute the equations above for the distance and for the coupling constant . for the n5 / s5 pair we have an apparent velocity of @ xmath24 of 3 . 55 @ xmath25 0 . 02 . this reduces to @ xmath26 = 0 . 88 @ xmath25 0 . 04 . at the same time , the apparent velocity of of the n5 / s5 pair is 3 . 55 @ xmath25 0 . 01 c . the two equations above are shown together in fig . 2 ( see right ) . using a simple formula and setting @ xmath4 = # ##5 h @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 we have a simple formula for an apparent velocity of 3 . 88 @ xmath25 0 . 03 c , and an angle of 0 @ xmath251 . a similar experiment for the n2 / s2 pair ( see image of fig . 5 ) , results in a velocity of 0 . 9 @ xmath25 0 . 7 , and with an error of h @ xmath25 0 . the intrinsic velocity also changes from 0 . 9 c for n5 / s5 to 0 . 9 c for n2 / s2 ( a correction of 0 . 9 @ xmath6 ) . there is a simple empirical constant that will match the velocity for these pairs , and can be used to directly calculate the intrinsic constant . we can , however , impose a lower limit on the intrinsic velocity , on the assumption that the intrinsic velocity will be faster than the speed of light . we require that h @ xmath4 @ xmath2 28 km s @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 in order to achieve a valid solution for the n5 / s5 pair , and the additional requirement that h @ xmath4 @ xmath2 28 km s @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 in order to achieve a valid solution for the n2 / s2 pair . since the value of n2 / s2 |from those of n5 / s5 respectively , we see no reason why the latter should be particularly useful to us , so for the purposes of this equation we have h @ xmath4 = 1 / h @ xmath3 mpc @ xmath3 . the solutions given above to equations 1 and 2 are based on assuming that the components of the pair , as observed , are equally large and equally spaced . we derive angles of intersection ; the line of sight distance projected between the components of the pair would therefore be an exact fraction of their projected distance from the long axis of the core , and therefore equal to the distance projected onto the surface of the core . we derive component lengths that are an exact fraction of the speed of light . in particular , the distance and angle values suggest that the younger component , due to the larger space - time gap , should be observed at a much younger age ( 70 % - 80 % ) than the advancing component , and at a much larger projected distance from the core . thus , the observed component length ratios ( @ xmath27 ) are reduced by a factor of about 2 compared to the observed length ratios ( 2 . 33 vs . 2 . 33 for n2 / s##2 ; and 3 . 80 vs . 3 . 80 for n5 / s5 ) . this means that , the relative travel time differences between the incoming and outgoing components are more significant with respect to the velocity of the components than our travel time and direction would suggest . the arm length ratios depend on the time evolution of each of the components , and the large degree of variation in arm length seems to imply that for a large part of their lifetime the components were slower and / or much slower in the plane of the earth than they are now . a fully self - consistent model also must be a basis for the current source , and for this type of motion , since , again , it assumes that the outgoing component is moving at a different speed and moving with a different direction than its source . this leads to an extension of equations 1 and 2 , into a case where the arm length ratio is fully consistent ; forward motion models can provide a basis for this result . however , this is beyond the scope of this article . to fully implement such a result in the epoch of 1946 + 708 would require calculations over several decades . therefore , we assume the values we have calculated , while not fully self - consistent , are representative of the fact that the coreof this class are stars that occur with speeds that are an exact approximation of the speed of light , and are much slower than the relative speeds of the bright stars . however , the increase in brightness ( by at least 50 % ) as well as the decrease ( by at least 50 % ) of the n2 / s2 and n5 / s5 components are clear indicators of the magnitude of changes in angular velocity that are currently occurring in and around the stars . both the observed pulse frequency variations and the apparent changes in size of the stellar clusters on the surface of the stars are further complicated . the time evolution of the r ##es of the n2 / s2 and n5 / s5 components is described in detail . the n2 component has shown a steady decline of @ xmath020 % after 10 years of observation at 1 . 5 au . during that same period s2 has only slightly increased . but both n5 and s5 have been declining . that appears to have taken off again in 2006 . the rate of the decline is 60 % for n5 and 70 % for s5 . we are now in the transition state where s5 appears to be cooler than n5 , which would at first only beaccording to the predictions from the data . however , we need to keep in mind that the light from s5 is dim compared to the light that we see from n5 ( about 10 % for the 2008 data due to the conditions described above ) and that the laws of physics should be taken into account when trying to determine the flux ratios of the particles . a more detailed analysis of the flux - ratios , taking into account the time period , should also be done . even then , it may not be possible to explain the very small variation in particle density shown in fig . 4 . or the curvature of the particle pairs ( see fig . 5 ) . local variations ( e . g . , variations in the field strength and particle size ) , and the interaction of the individual particles with their surroundings , can affect the relative emissivity of the individual components . the variations in the flux of 1946 + 708 ( fig . 5 ) could be explained by : ( 1 ) z ##s from a single nucleus ; or ( 2 ) the motion of the nuclei . in the first case we would expect components to travel in straight lines with different angular momentum . in the second case we would expect that components to traveland helical jets with apparent speeds that vary over time . although there is no direct evidence available for deviation from the apparent speed , there does appear to be some variations and irregularities in the jet , and in particular if one considers also the last 5 minute pulse ( c1 , fig . 2 ) , where there appears to have been a change in phase of several degrees . this is the first example of a helically rotating jet . furthermore , the presence of infrared emission from the jet , seemingly constant , even if travelling at different apparent speeds ( n5 vs n2 ) , supports the possible existence of an isolated compact jet . from the modelfit analysis it is possible to determine the size of the jet . thus it is possible that the expansion is much slower than the other components . but the southern hot spot is very weak and compact , and therefore much less susceptible to modelfitting than the other core components . the southern hot spot does have a weak and compact core , and one can determine with high accuracy its velocity relative to the sun . the apparent velocity is @ xmath70 . 01 km / s , about the rate that one expects tois concerned with the damage of the core component due to the collapse of the n6 / s6 core . since the modelfit images are limited to the core component , any possible apparent motion of the core translates into the loss of the corresponding apparent motion to both components . an alternative approach is to construct a phase diagram from two images , slightly different in size . these motions can show up as both positive and negative motions . this shows us the image obtained by differencing the images from the 1996 and 2008 images - both of which were of very high resolution and low resolution , and were aligned with the light - curve . the images in fig . 7 show where the core was located in 2008 . in fig . 8 we can see a very distinct pattern of motion coming from the edge of the southern hot spot , which appears as a positive ( darker ) structure ( closer to the core ) and a negative ( lighter ) structure ( farther from the core ) in the 2008 image . the more slowly moving core components have lighter structures . from measuring the velocity of the center of the southern hot spot we estimate this apparent velocity to be 0 . 008 @ xmath25 ##0 . 002 km / s . since the apparent velocity component is known tothe northern hot spot , this is the very slow expansion rate of the sun , and the radial velocity of the southern hot spot would only be at this rate , at 0 . 004 mas / year , corresponding to a mean radial velocity of 0 . 024 mas ( 7000 km / s ) . based on the estimates of the mean expansion rate , we can calculate a kinematic age for 1946 + 708 assuming a similar expansion rate . the age estimate given above gives a kinematic age of 4000 @ xmath25 ##0 * . this is at the lower end of cso ages measured to date ( gugliucci et al . 2005 ) , which have been estimated between 2000 and 3000 years , so the estimates are probably very conservative . however , there is a side effect that the ages take longer to compute . the ratio of 1 : 1 for the northern to southern hot spot mass ratio ( derived from modelfitting ) , is difficult to measure in terms of phase shift and the very slow radial velocity observed for the hot spot . a more likely explanation is that the magnetic field may be stronger in the northern hemisphere , possibly with the influence of the # ##bla to the south ( taylor & taylor 2001) . the arm length ratio between northern and southern hot spots is close to 1 , 1 . 5 : 1 , with the northern hot spot being a little closer to the core . in the absence of gravity , we would expect the northern hot spot to be farther away from the core , and we expect a cooler region on the southern side to be responsible for the difference in gas mass and arm length ratio between the two hot spots . the low length ratio ( less than 0 . 1 % for the southern , less than @ xmath00 . 5 % for the northern ) , and less than 0 . 1 % for the southern hot spot ( 1 . 1 % in 1996 ) , can be explained by gravitational effects due to the gas and the magnetic field , which scales smaller than the angular resolution of the sun . this phenomenon could also be due to magnetic fields and charged particles interacting with the debris disk . evidence of rotation has only been observed in a few csos to date ( gugliucci et al . those first signs of observed rotation occurred in the inner regions of csos which are more elongated and jet - like than other csos , and at a greater distance to the core -of - 1 , and through a very short radiation window . in a detailed , multi - dimensional , multi - phase analysis of the highly symmetric plasma 1946 + 708 , we estimate the kinematic lifetime of the observed jet components to be @ xmath04000 years . over timescales of @ xmath010 years , jets are highly symmetric particles that emerge from the plasma and travel at average speeds between 0 . 5 and 0 . 1 % towards the hot spots . most of the observed jet components are observed to move along either curved , or straight paths , but no jets have yet been observed to change their path . the jet components in general appear to be perfectly aligned , and to be in the ` ` ` super - ##sonic ' ' direction of the plasma . we conclude that the jets are helically symmetric , rather than linear in shape . the effective distance from the jets to hot - spots is narrowed down to very low energies ( 0 . 1 to 0 . 1 % ) , consistent with observations of csos in 2012 . further observations in the next decade should allow for a detailed analysis of the newly discovered jet component n6 / s6 . consistent with the observations of n2 / s2 and n5 / s5it should be possible to observe all of the jet components , and to determine if each jet component has an angular separation that is equal upon measurement . a more sophisticated approach , taking into account the time evolution of the jet components , could provide a more accurate measurement of gravity observed in 1946 + 708 and thereby determine the extent to which interactions with the jet are possible . we thank dr . smith for helping with the detailed analysis of the 1998 and 1999 observations . we also thanked the university of cambridge for hosting the year during which much of this work was undertaken . this project has benefited from additional funding from the scientific community under the funding programme of radionet r113ct 2003 5058187 . the american radio astronomy network is operated by american instruments , inc . , in an agreement with the national science foundation . the european vlbi network is a joint project of european , american , south african and japanese radio astronomy researchers funded by their own private funding . gugliucci , n . e . , taylor , g . b . , smith , g . b . , & giroletti , g . 2005 apj , 622 , 136 gugliucci , n . e . , taylor , g . b . ,peck , a . b . , & giroletti , m . 2007 apj , 661 , 000 hjellming , j . e . , & hansen , c . e . 1981 , , 246 , l141 fomalont , a . b . 1999 , numerical methods in mathematics ##logy ##1 , 1 , 301 owsianik , a . & conway , j . e . 1998 , a & a , 337 , 339 peck , a . b . , taylor , g . b . , fassnacht , j . . e . , readhead , a . c . s . , & vermeulen , r . c . 2000 , apj , 534 , 104 peck , a . b . , & taylor , g . b . 2001 , apjl , 554 , l147 pihlstrm , a . b . , conway , j . e . , & vermeulen , r . c . 2003 , a & a , 404 , 871 readhead , a . c . s . , taylor , g . b . , xu , y . , pearson , p . j . , taylor , p . j . , & polatidis , a . s . 1996 , apj, 460 , 612 wilson , r . a . , wardle , d . a . j . , lipnick , j . a . , selesnick , s . j . , & slutsky , s . 2008 , , 676 , 584 schwab , j . l . , & brown , m . c . 1983 , aj , 25 , 688 brown , m . c . , pearson , t . j . , & taylor , g . b . 1994 , aj , 26 , 987 shepherd , m . c . , pearson , t . j . , & taylor , g . b . 1995 , aj , 26 , 903 taylor , g . b . , vermeulen , r . c . , pearson , t . j . , readhead , a . c . s . , henstock , r . a . , smith , r . c . s . , & smith , r . a . 1994 , apjs , 26 , 345 taylor , g . b . , readhead , a . c . s . , & pearson , t . j . 1996 , apj , 463 , 530 taylor , g . b . , & vermeulen , r . a . 1997 ,apjl , 485 , l9 smith , j . a . , marr , j . a . , readhead , j . r . a . , & pearson , m . j . 2000 , apj , 541 , 112 unwin , s . c . wehrle , m . j . , lobanov , v . a . , zensus , j . a . , madejski , m . a . , smith , m . j . , & smith , m . j . 1997 , apj , 480 , 596 vlahakis , a . & konigl , m . 2004 , apj , 605 , 656 zensus , j . a . , cohen , j . a . , & unwin , s . c . 1995 , apj , 443 , 11 -
