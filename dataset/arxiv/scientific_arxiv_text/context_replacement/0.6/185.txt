the theory of quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of a black hole ( s ) has a history @ xcite . the reason for this history is that the qnms is a new way of understanding the physical aspects of the motion of very large objects , without the need of the classical or general relativity theory . for example , by comparing the well known modes qnms with the modes of the gravitational waves , one can prove to prove the existence of the wave modes of very large objects , since those modes exist for the same types of : black holes , superspinars ( with gravity ) , neutron stars , black hole clusters etc . @ xcite . to obtain the qnms , one has to solve the first - order ordinary differential equations for the three components of the system : the regge - schwarz equation ( rwe ) and the zerilli equation for the schwarzschild metric , the teukolsky differential equation ( tre ) for the kerr metric and to find the three boundary conditions the so - called black hole boundary conditions ( for going both into the origin and into infinity ) @ xcite . finally , one finds a boundary condition for the angular momentum of the system. and finally , one has to solve a binary system with two different separation frequencies the frequency @ xmath2 and the other frequency @ xmath3 ( @ xmath4 is for the nonrotating system , with @ xmath5 the separation frequency of the system ) . this problem was first solved by chandrasekhar & detweiler @ xcite and teukolsky & others @ xcite and further improved with the use of continued fraction by others @ xcite . for more detailed details , see also @ xcite . because of the complexity of the differential equations , until recently , those equations were solved either indirectly or directly , with additional constraints @ xcite . the direct solutions of the continued fraction ##s have some limitations and are not directly connected with the solution of the problem . the rwe , the zerilli equation and tre , respectively , can be solved directly in terms of the heun functions , as shown for the first time in @ xcite . with the following constraints on those equations _ _ _ ( @ @ xcite ) one defines a system of differential equations and defines the corresponding heun functions which can be solved directly . in this case , forthe first case we use the @ xmath5 and @ xmath2 _ _ _ in the formula for the solution @ xmath6 of the schwarzschild system , i . e . we define the rwe and tre respectively in terms of the heun function and we use a newly developed method ( the two - dimensional version of the mller method introduced in the original research paper @ xcite ) to find the solutions of the differential equations with two complex variables . then we use the correlation function to calculate the variation of the solution with respect to the change of the phase space . the results are compared with previously - obtained results and are shown to converge with at least 7 digits for the rwe and 11 digits for the tre . for the second case , the so - called algebraic special mode @ xmath0 is found with values of less than 11 digits , and it is shown to have a nonzero real part . this result establishes the linear dependence of this mode with the algebraic special mode . also apparent is the nontrivial dependence on @ xmath1 of the other two modes in both cases . the angular solution for both cases is the solution of the teuk##olsky angular momentum when there is an angle ( @ xmath7 ) : @ xmath8 where @ xmath9 $ ] is the angle . the values for the qnms should be independent of the value of @ xmath10 and the real line . for our local solution , we use @ xmath11 . the general solution of the radial velocity is derived from the results of the rwe and tre ##b in terms of the standard heun function corresponding to @ xcite , in which the black hole boundary conditions have been determined . the derivation of the local solution in terms of the heun functions takes into account the boundary conditions of the universe . first , one is to find the following boundary conditions for the space infinity ( for which is @ xcite ) : @ xmath12 where @ xmath13 is the standard heun function as used by tre and the values @ xmath14 are for the special cases . the values of the solution when the effective radius is @ xmath15 and , if we use @ xmath16 which turns out to be small enough to fit in the space infinity , are ( @ xcite ) : : . for the case ofthe regge - wheeler equation : @ xmath17 = . for the solution of the teukolsky radial equation : @ xmath18 where @ xmath19 is the coupling constant . the solutions are found by using the teukolsky radial equation and the @ xmath20 and they are quite different from those for the regge - wheeler equation . however , it is important to know whether both methods yield the same solution for qnm and with what follows . for solutions of the function @ xmath21 of particular interest , the von heun function @ xmath22 has singular points in the positive x - direction at the singular points @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 . in the above example , if the branch cut is on the non - zero axis @ xmath25 is the real axis . the choice of the branch cut may lead to the splitting of the lines and their lengths , since by changing the orientation of the real axis @ xmath26 , we can make a jump to another sheet of the multivalued manifold . to do this , we use the following method with which we can choose the other sheet and jump on it . this is done by choosing thea solution ( @ xmath27 ) of the system is @ xmath28 ( related to the principle of gradient descent , see @ xcite ) , with which one can reduce the square root away from the origin and thus increase the linear time of the system . for more information on the radial equation and the gradient method , see @ xcite . from the radial equation , it is known that it can be solved even without solving the systems and and the coefficients of @ xmath5 are known : @ xmath29 . in this case , only the first solution , @ xmath30 , is needed to solve the qnms with the radial equations . one can then either solve with the radial equations or solve the systems and with the corresponding values of the coefficients . if one combines the system with a 3 - dimensional system , solving it with 9 digits of integers ( and 1 of floating - point numbers ) , one gets as follows , @ xmath31 with the first value resulting from the solution being the maximum . the above values for the coefficients are given in : [ table1 ] . . a table of the frequencies obtained for the qnms of schwarzschild black holes using the regge -anderson equation and the teukolsky equation . the modes with @ xmath32 were obtained for @ xmath33 , and from @ xmath34 with @ xmath35 . the other two modes ( @ xmath36 ) were obtained independently by fiziev in @ xcite . the solutions of rwe to the heun equation [ tre = " < , < , < , < " , tre = " > " , ] from the table , we can see that the results from the two sets of modes agree with at least three times . a comparison between the rwe results and the results obtained by andersson @ xcite , also in @ xcite shows that the difference between the two results is greater than @ xmath37 in both cases and is due to the algebraic approach . there are two important results from this paper . first , as seen from the [ table1 ] for both the rwe and the tre , the power of two has a large but nonzero real part . according to wilson - smith this power should be equal to @ xmath38 @ xcite , with an equally small real part , if it is to belong to the so - called _ _ _ _ _ . "##ally ##c ( as ) modes have a real value in the qnm of @ xcite . the andersson method is not suitable for them and these are excluded from his results . berti , cardoso and starinets ( @ xcite ) make a note of the results so far for these modes . so the 9th mode ( @ xmath0 ) should be purely imaginary with = @ xmath39 , if it exactly corresponds to the as mode . in our view , even if the imaginary parts do not pose a problem for the method , the real part of the 9th mode is still purely real , and it has at least two real parts when = @ xmath1 in the case described above for the rwe and tre . this result shows that this method does not agree with the one for the 9th mode , which is to be expected since the two modes should correspond to different values than those of the so - called anti - as mode ( @ xcite . the most important problem is the choice of the values @ xmath40 and @ xmath1 . the direction of gradient ##s is assumed to be the only direction in which the modes satisfy the black hole boundary condition at infinity . the two dimensional solution for the ##allyfor the heun , @ xcite . the existence of the same method in its simplest form for the above cases satisfying these conditions and application of this method , however , is still an open question presented here for the first time . using the @ xmath1 method , one can find the intervals for @ xmath1 into which each mode can be found . the intervals for the rwe and tre , as usual , coincide . however , the intervals into which each mode can be found stand out when searching @ xmath41 . thus for the above two cases it is possible to search @ xmath42 for positive and negative values of @ xmath1 in a given interval , as follows : for @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 $ ] , for @ xmath45 $ ] , for @ xmath46 $ ] , for @ xmath47 $ ] , for @ xmath48 $ ] , where the first sign refers to modes with a positive real part and the second sign to those with negative real parts . the third part for the interval @ xmath41 [ . ] for @ xmath49 , ( for @ xmath50 ) the modes with a negative real part .is used again for different values of @ xmath1 , and the dependency with @ xmath51 . for @ xmath0 , the dependency with different values with respect to @ xmath1 for @ xmath52 $ ] , one has the relation with _ _ _ _ _ and vice versa : ( @ xmath53 ) . the so - called solution @ xmath54 needs to be investigated further . for the solution @ xmath55 , the ( to some extent ) relation was discussed earlier in @ xcite ( and later in @ xcite ) . it is known that there are such symmetrical relations which are related to the real axis and which can be associated with the branch cut on the axis of the rwe , when @ xmath2 is not imaginary . using the @ xmath1 method based on the asymptotics of the two heun functions , it can also take the value of the branch cut on the real axis as a function of @ xmath1 and they can be directly combined in the solution @ xmath56 . however , the combination of the two heun functions and the @ xmath1 method fails .a way to determine the functions and their values in relation to the fixed points of the upper half - plane , something that can not be easily done with the continued fraction ##s , is to solve the qnms . an examination of the function @ xmath57 ( and @ xmath58 ) in the way described above shows that , for both the rwe and the tre , there is indeed a constant function with amplitude @ xmath59 and period @ xmath60 which varies with @ xmath41 in a nontrivial way ( fig . [ fig1 ] and fig . [ fig2 ] ) . for @ xmath61 , from the rwe and the tre one finds @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 and those that are approximately constant with respect to @ xmath41 ( @ xmath61 ) . for @ xmath64 , the dependence of @ xmath59 and @ xmath60 on @ xmath41 is quite obvious : the amplitude and the period of the rwe vary with @ xmath41 until they become @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 for @ xmath67 . for the tre, the amplitude and the frequency correspond to @ xmath68 , @ xmath69 . for @ xmath0 , the first two parameters have an equal amplitude @ xmath70 . those results show that , although the previously - given values are consistent with at least two parameters with respect to @ xmath1 , there is still a complex structure , the details of which should be carefully considered . @ xmath71 { \ includegraphics [ height = 120px , width = 110px ] { fig1a . eps } } & \ { [ ] { \ includegraphics [ height = 120px , width = 110px ] { fig1b . eps } } \ \ \ { [ ] { \ includegraphics [ height = 120px , width = 110px ] { fig1c . eps } } & \ } [ ] { \ includegraphics [ height = 120px , width = 110px ] { fig1d . eps } } \ \ \ { { { } $ ] in this example , we given the qnms for the schwarzschild bh ##q from the rwe and thetre , by solving the differential equations directly in terms of the heun functions . the qnms from the tre for the mode @ xmath6 were used for the first time and were found to agree with the well - known qnms from the rwe with precision of 6 digits . we propose a new method for obtaining the results of the qnm method . the results show nontrivial dependence on the value of the phase factor ( the @ xmath1 condition ) which requires additional calculations . for the first time , the mode @ xmath0 was derived directly from the numerical analysis of the partial differential equations of rwe and tre and was found to have a nonzero real part , which proves that this mode is not the only stable mode . the mode in tre was found with 6 digits of precision with respect to that of @ xmath1 , which proves that the real part is also not unstable . those results presented here show the possibility of using the heun functions to find qnms of nonrotating modes and of continuing and improving this work by finding qnms of stable modes . this paper is published in the journal ` ` theoretical and mathematical physics and mathematics '' , and the swiss national scientific fund , contract do - 1 - 872 , do - 1 - 895 , 2010 - 02 - 136 , and the national scientific fund , contract 185 / 01 . 04 . 2010 . p . f . started the analysis of the qnms of non - black holes as a part of the high - performance mller method , called the new method , as a modification of the original method and has continued the work . p . f . is responsible for the evaluation of qnms , based on the use of the heun method and for the identification and analysis of the @ xmath1 - space , the region of the upper half - plane where qnms can be found . 00 , _ the non - rotating state of the schwarzschild black hole _ , proc . science : * 344 * : 441 - 452 ( 1975 ) , _ black holes and gravitational waves . - - the gravitational theory of black holes _ , apj : * 239 * , 292 - 295 , ( 1980 ) , _ the gravitational theory of black holes _ , clarendon press / oxford university press ( oxford series of reviews in physics . volume 2 ) , ( 1983 ) , _ the##normal modes of black holes and quantum branes _ , gen . , grav . * d * 163001 ( 108pp ) ( 2009 ) , _ black hole quasinormal modes : foundations of quantum mechanics ?
