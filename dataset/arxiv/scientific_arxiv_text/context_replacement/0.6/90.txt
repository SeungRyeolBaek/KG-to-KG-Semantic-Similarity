the increasing use of the new @ xmath0 - body model to make accurate predictions of the future evolution of star clusters has also matched advances in computing power ( heggie 2011 ) . the focus has moved from non - @ xmath0 models based on planets ( e . g . von hoerner 1963 ; mcmillan , brown & makino 1990 ; giersz & heggie 1997 ) to simulations of large star clusters and into the @ xmath9 model ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) , making use of general - purpose computer simulations ( makino 2002 ) . further developments in a longer timeframe have produced new models ( aarseth 1999 ; portegies zwart et al . 2001 ) that improve the accuracy of the model by considering stellar and planetary evolution , star formation , black - body , and other variables . as a result , @ xmath0 - body models have been used in many ways to model the evolution of star clusters ( examples : vesperini & heggie 1997 ; baumgardt & makino 2003 ; zonoozi et al . 2011 ) , even though the original models could only represent the outer half of the clusterl - space ( see aarseth 2003 and heggie & smith 2003 for a more detailed discussion of this work ) . at the other end of the spectrum , monte carlo ( mc ) methods have proven useful in constructing statistical models of @ xmath10particles ( giersz & heggie 2011 ) . these models have shown that processes usually described as pre - core - collapse may actually occur in a different post - core - collapse environment ( heggie & giersz 2008 ) . in general the two approaches are equivalent with one being the more general @ xmath0 - body approach ( such as the initial points ) and @ xmath0 - body the points of evolution . in this case we propose an @ xmath0 - body model of the cluster evolution that starts with @ xmath1 clusters and ends . this extends the @ xmath0 model already provided by the @ xmath0 - body models and provides two additional features . first it provides a new starting point for the mc . this new model is more efficient for increasing @ xmath0 and estimates for increasing @ xmath0 are more accurate . it also allows us toto improve our theoretical understanding of star cluster evolution and see how the values obtained from simulations of the @ xmath0 lead to new models . the latter is the focus of this new study . a good example of the non - @ xmath0 models that we want to work with is the original model of star cluster evolution produced by giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) with data that included the wave function , stellar evolution and the gravitational pull of a low - mass star , albeit consistent with @ xmath7 , instead of @ xmath11 . more recent models for this include baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) and kpper et al . we were originally trying to create a model that predicted star - formation up to a certain point without collapsing at that time . what we find when using this model is that much of the data described previously for the @ xmath0 - based model holds up well in simulations and that the existence of a cluster composed of massive black holes ( galaxies ) is a new clue to the nature of the galactic halo . in section 2 we describe the structure of the model . this is followed by a summary of the models in sections 3 to 5 . the stellar evolution (( size and shape ) , the nature of the c - h interaction , mass distribution , density , and energy ( binary orbital and internal energy ) . in these sections the results are summarized and compared to previous results where possible . then in section 2 we will look at how the estimated timescale of the new model relates to observations made in the past . for our example we use the nbody4 board ( aarseth 1999 ) and the k - 3 board ( makino 2002 ) developed at the american museum of natural history . nbody4 uses the first - order hermite diffusion algorithm and the inverse timestep algorithm to determine the mass of cluster members and several other algorithms to deal with the internal energy of non - @ xmath0 stars ( see aarseth 2003 for details ) . orbital and mass segregation of the cluster members was modeled in accordance with the new model as described by hurley et al . ( 2001 ) . the model worked with @ xmath2 dwarf stars and @ xmath3 stars . we will refer to this as the k200 model . the initial value of 0 . 025 was supported by the results of hurley et al . ( 2008 ) which was the most stable .mass of @ xmath12 for the open cluster ngc @ xmath13 , is at the half - way side of the cluster . as shown in hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) and again in hurley et al . ( 2008 ) , this can be taken as part of the total binary mass of the cluster . so we use this method for our study . some of the binary mass estimates can be seen in figure 2 . masses for the individual stars were chosen from the initial mass estimates ( data ) of kroupa , wilson & gilmore ( 1993 ) with the upper limit of 0 . 05 and @ xmath14 . the binary mass was chosen from the data of kroupa , wilson & gilmore ( 1991 ) , but this had not been used for the mass of stars , and the binary masses were calculated by calculating the g - value from the normal distribution . for nbody4 we find that all stars are on the intermediate - mass main sequence when the process begins and that any residual material from the star formation process has been removed . the metallicity of @ xmath15 was chosen for all stars . the angular masses of the @ xmath3 and 4 were calculatedfrom the quasi - normal distribution found by eggleton , fitchett & wilson ( 1989 ) with a maximum of @ xmath16au and a minimum of @ xmath17au . the masses of the parent galaxies are expected to follow the normal distribution ( heggie 1975 ) . for the mass expansion of the parent galaxy we have found the slit - like galaxy associated with the parent galaxy in a circular orbit at @ xmath18kpc with an orbital period of @ xmath19 . in finding @ xmath20 we have been strongly motivated by the desire for the cluster to have a minimum of mass - expansion at @ xmath21gyr . previous work suggested that @ xmath22kpc would do this for a galaxy cluster with @ xmath1 . we used the plummer star profile ( plummer 1911 ; aarseth , hnon & wielen 1974 ) and assumed the cluster and galaxies were in virial orbit when calculating the cluster mass and distances . the plummer model also applies to larger distances but in practice a trade - off of the value of @ xmath23 is required , where @ xmath24 is the half - light .. this is to avoid including stars of similar size in the mass distribution . the initial model has a tidal radius equal to : @ xmath25 where @ xmath26 is the gravitational radius and @ xmath27 is the tidal radius ( see giersz & heggie 1997 ) . we have the @ xmath0 - the length - scale of our model means that the starting point of the initial model is : @ xmath28 . this is the value reached when gas produced from star formation is removed from the stellar density ( which we do not have ) , so our initial model should be more widely used than the initial protocluster . stars were ejected from the cluster when their distance from the cluster center was twice that of the tidal radius of the cluster . with these values the initial values of the k200 model were @ xmath29 , @ xmath30pc and @ xmath31pc . the half - life and timescale of the initial model was @ xmath32myr . some of the performance of this model can be compared to that proposed by hurley et al . ( 2008 ) for the model that started with @ xmath33 ##pc star and @ xmath##3 . . this can be referred to as the k100 model . the k100 model was based on a circular orbit around a slit - like star at a radial velocity of @ xmath34kpc . it had the same number of planets as the k200 model but not the same mass . the positions of the stars and planets were set up in the same way as described above for the k200 model . models orbiting at @ xmath18kpc ( solid line ) , the hurley et al . ( 2008 ) @ xmath35 ( k100 ) model orbiting at @ xmath34kpc ( solid line ) and the @ xmath35 model orbiting at @ xmath36kpc ( solid line ) . [ f : fig1 ] , n = 317 ] in the [ f : fig1 ] we look at the distribution of the total stellar mass with respect for the k200 model . this work was completed for 2008 by @ xmath4gyr which had the goal of building a star - cluster - like model ( see below ) for the very center of the milky way galaxy cluster . at this time the original model had only @ xmath37 of its total mass . in theof those remaining at @ xmath4gyr the k200 model with @ xmath38 consists of @ xmath39 core stars and @ xmath40 cores . we use the results of the k100 model from hurley et al . ( 2008 ) in figure [ f : fig1 ] and show that at @ xmath4gyr the two model clusters have the same number of stars remaining ( but decreasing with a rate of 10 times ) . for this we will show in figure [ f : fig1 ] the cluster that starts with @ xmath8 is on the same scale as the k200 model . as such this cluster does not exist for the current epoch and has completely collapsed before reaching @ xmath41gyr . the change in the mass - loss curve is similar to that of the k200 model and differs from that of the k100 model with @ xmath34kpc . the evolution of the mass - loss rates and collapse rates of model clusters as a function of distance around the star will be the subject of a study ( hurley et al . 2012 ) . figure [ f : fig2 ] shows the evolution of the high radius , the low - mass radius and the collapse rates of the cluster##200 . ] . both the half - mass and mass values have an average value similar to the core mass - independent from the cores , which are all located in the outer regions of the cluster . the half - mass value gradually decreases , appearing to reflect the average value of the tidal radius at successive stages . at @ xmath4gyr we find @ xmath42pc which is similar to the maximum tidal radius observed for open clusters ( e . g . jordn et al . 2005 ) . the half - radius reaches a deep minimum at @ xmath5gyr which we define as the point that the initial core - collapse phase begins . this is based mainly on analysis of data [ see : fig2 ] , showing that the same approach used for the initial deep ##ening of the time - and space - dependent tidal radius has been successfully used in the past ( e . g . baumgardt & makino 2003 ; hurley et al . 2004 ; kpper et al . 2008 ) . at this point the effective radius , @ xmath43 , decreases from the average value of @ xmath44 . then the radius expands again , leading to post - core - collapse phase##s . by heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) . here , we find that the universe has dynamic stability right down to the time of core - collapse as follows . - the core radius ( + 7 ) , the black - body radius ( lower solid line ) and tidal radius ( upper solid line ) for the @ xmath1 model . the models are two - dimensional . the lower solid line in @ xmath5gyr is the radius we have associated with the length of the initial core - collapse period . [ f : fig2 ] , n = 317 ] the tidal radius in the [ f : fig2 ] is the core radius as used in @ xmath0 - 1 models ( casertano & smith 1985 ) , calculated from the mass density average of the distance of the core from the solid line ( aarseth 2003 ) . by heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) we have also looked at the actual core radius used in their monte carlo simulations , such as @ xmath45 where @ xmath46 is the star - specific core radius , and @ xmath47 is the radial velocity , all calculated from the first few stars . we found that @xmath48 and @ xmath49 have a constant value at all times . in contrast , for the region @ xmath50gyr , i . e . @ xmath6gyr during core - collapse , values range from 0 . 5 to @ xmath51pc for the duration of the period . for example , the region of the largest 50 % of the core radius is @ xmath52pc during this period and is therefore a good approximation for the total core radius . however , heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) we have used the autocorrelation method to determine if there is a significant change in the value of the @ xmath0 - body core radius of the @ xmath6gyr prior to core - collapse . this is a change of 1 @ xmath53myr : greater than the crossing time ( @ myr ) and less than the crossing time ( @ xmath54myr ) . in addition , heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) found the x ##s of @ xmath55myr for their @ xmath0 - body core - collapse , as observed for @ xmath6gyr[ from a post - collapse monte carlo model with an average of @ xmath4gyr . ] , although this was lower @ xmath0 than our post - collapse k200 model and also had a lower half - life and timescale of @ xmath56myr . it is of interest to see how the @ xmath0 - like values obtained for previous @ xmath0 models are true in comparison to our current models . the k100 model of hurley et al . ( 2008 ) had a similar average value at the time of core - collapse as did our k200 model ( @ xmath57pc ) , albeit at a different scale ( @ xmath58gyr compared to @ xmath5gyr ) . as mentioned above , the average value of @ xmath48 at core - collapse is equal to the 1 % lagrangian radius for the k200 model . for the k100 model @ xmath48 evolved up to the 1 % lagrangian radius ( although it would go down to the 1 % radius on collapse ) and for the @ xmath59 model of giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) @ xmath48 evolved .the 1 % lagrangian error is zero . so it follows that with ratio @ xmath0 the depth of core - collapse decreases relative to the # ##ing density . if we look closely at these values , and the value of the ratio @ xmath60 as a function of is determined from the core - collapse loss timescale , we see that the k200 and k100 ratios match each other very well . the ratio starts at @ xmath61 and then increases to an average value of @ xmath62 at the depth of core - collapse . giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) used @ xmath63 for their model of core - collapse , except that they used @ xmath49 rather than the casertano & wilson ( 1985 ) model and that it was about twice as large as the core - collapse period for their model ( we assumed that the ratios had similar mean values ) . mcmillan ( 1993 ) proposed models with @ xmath64 , a gas and a gravitational wave . for these models @ xmath60 is at about 0 . 5 in perfect agreement with the density of the gas ( see mcmillan 1993 for details ) . it also follows that this can be explainednot a typical value for mass at the time of core - formation ( although see the previous section for details of the extreme cases ) . a notable event in the [ see : fig2 ] is the sudden change in the mass of the core at @ xmath65gyr , the very young core , when the mass of the core rapidly increases and decreases rapidly from that point on . this change is due to an interaction with the core of a binary system of two stars . the system in question is near - binary . the star originated from a binary companion star at the core @ xmath66myr of stars with masses of @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 , respectively . the two stars formed a binary , @ xmath69myr , a two - star system , but with a relatively low mass and an orbital period of @ xmath70d . it remained at the core for the rest of its life and underwent a series of events and interactions that saw the mass increase from 0 . 1 to 0 . 5 and the orbital period decrease to @ xmath71d from @ xmath72myr . during that time the star- it is involved in a strong interaction with a binary consisting of two main - sequence stars ( masses of @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 ) . the binary binary is broken - up and the two main - sequence stars are ejected separately from the cluster ( masses of @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 ) . this causes the collapse of the b - binary which leaves the cluster and enters the cluster itself ( @ xmath66myr , with a mass of @ xmath77 ) . the destruction of the central core of the cluster by this b - binary and the subsequent collapse is similar to the scenario described by aarseth ( 2012 ) . the rapid loss of mass from the core the core radius increases by 50 % ( see next section ) and with the rapid retreat of the two main - sequence stars causes the cluster to collapse . we expected that after this event the core radius will begin to increase once again but without effect . however , the effect of the strong interaction with a binary system has accelerated the core collapse process . up to the point that we are at the end of the initial core - collapse , the core radius has decreased .a total of about 100 . the collapse of open clusters is usually described by the structure of @ xmath78 ( harris 1966 ) . milky way clusters have a number of @ xmath79 ratios ( harris 1996 ) with the most common core collapse phase being @ xmath80 and with @ xmath81 being seen as indicative of a low - mass star undergoing a massive core - collapse phase ( mateo 1987 ) . at the beginning of the core - collapse phase our k200 model has @ xmath82 and this changes to @ xmath83 when the # - 1 is removed from the core . therefore , the model would not be expected to behave like a core - collapse cluster if observed at this stage . hurley ( 2007 ) showed that the presence of a long - period b - h binary in the core , with both components being of equal mass , could significantly increase the @ xmath60 ratio of the ratio with @ xmath8 ##1 . the b - h binary in our @ xmath1 model has also shown a significant increase of the ratio . mackey et al . ( 2007 ) compared @ xmath0 - 1 ratios with @xmath9 for which they calculated @ xmath84 - body values . they found that the cluster had a stable core in which stars were formed and matter could be removed from the core , leading to a greatly reduced cluster mass . it is our intention in the near future to look at a wide range of @ xmath0 - body models and study in detail the structure and dynamics of h - h interactions in the context of model simulations . this will involve applying our ( 1966 ) model to the mass distribution of the individual stars so as to directly predict the mass values rather than the @ xmath0 - body values as we have shown previously in our previous fig . 2 . the first straight line represents the beginning of the initial star - formation phase shown in figure [ f : fig2 ] . [ f : fig3 ] , n = 317 ] . [ f : fig3 ] looks at how the average cluster mass varies for the k200 cluster , based on four main lagrangian regions : a core shell that contains the ~ 1 % of the cluster mass , a middle shell that lies between and between 1 % and 2 % of the cluster mass , an outer shell that lies betweenthe 50 % and 50 % lagrangian radius , and an outer region that contains all stars within the 50 % lagrangian radius . note that these are rare and are expected to be rare . the average stellar mass of the open cluster is @ xmath85 at the center of the cluster there is a minimum mass , and is low in inner regions due to the large pre - loss of the mass for the region @ xmath86myr . we can see that the process of mass loss caused by two - body interactions takes place , with an increase in the average stellar mass in the inner regions and a corresponding decrease in the outer regions . by the time that the minimum - mass separation timescale has passed ( @ xmath87myr ) there is a large difference in the stellar masses in each of the regions . in the inner region the average stellar mass continues to increase up to the time of pre - collapse and then decreases post - collapse ( until the formation of the cd - cd cluster ) . the activity in the cluster core is reduced due to the smaller number of objects and the movement of these objects in and out of the cluster . we see a largeincrease in this mean occurs as the region moves closer to the point of core - formation ( see the figure with @ xmath48 in figure [ f : fig2 ] ) . the increasing average mass in the outer region is then offset by the increase of the atmospheric pressure which then floods the low - density regions that have been moving closer to this region . we see that from @ xmath88myr , the average mass in the outer region is also increasing and that this effect is also increasing in the central region . [ now consider the spatial distribution . [ f : fig4 ] , n = 317 ] if we first look at the distribution of three - dimensional spatial data we find that the average mass is the same in the two outer regions but decreases to about 5 % in the 1 - 2 % region and 10 - 15 % in the central region ( after the last gyr ) . giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) look at the distribution of average mass in both regions , as we have shown in figure [ f : fig3 ] . they find a general pattern which can be described as : ( 1 ) a slight decrease of the average mass in the 1 % lagrangian heading towards core -and ; ( ii ) a decrease in the central regions that spreads out with time and then disappears at subsequent time ; and ( iii ) density decreases in the central regions . however , using their @ xmath59 model they show that the timescale for the initial onset of mass segregation is approximately the same as the core - collapse timescale , whereas we find that mass segregation is already occurring well before core - collapse . the @ xmath89 models of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) agree with our k200 model in that respect and with the experimental results , showing the decrease of the relative density of the central regions post - collapse . so by comparing the data vs . [ f : fig5 ] , [ = 317 ] and figure [ f : fig4 ] we see the density distribution for the central lagrangian regions shown in figure [ f : fig3 ] . these regions show a gradual density decrease due to the increased size of the cluster . this is followed by a further gradual decrease as the cluster progresses towards core - collapse , with all regions appearing in an almost identical pattern . as the cluster slowly approaches the point of core - collapse there is a further decrease##turn to the velocity distribution at the 1 % radius . this is also carried over to the 10 % radius and again to the half - circle points , although to a much lesser degree . note that the result for three - dimensional distributions in the lagrangian plane is the same , with values that are about 20 % larger . the main features of our new model are those of the non - @ xmath0 model of giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) . these features are the same : the values for the 1 % and 10 % regions differ ; the velocity distribution of the outer regions is much greater than for these inner regions ; and the values for the 20 % radius are much closer to those of the inner regions than the outer regions . another measure of density to consider is the mean . we have tried to express this as the square of the mean squared contribution to the velocity distribution , @ xmath90 ( as in giersz & heggie 1997 ) and the result is shown in figure [ 1 : fig5 ] . in three dimensions this is equal to one for distributions , greater than two for a uniformly distributed distribution and less than one for a distributed##ly ##c model . an alternative is to use the model of @ xmath91 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; baumgardt & makino 2003 ; smith et al . 2003 ) where @ xmath92 is spherical , @ xmath93 is locally spherical and @ xmath94 is locally spherical . we see from figure [ 1 : fig5 ] that the inner regions of the model remain close to equilibrium throughout the evolution . the inner region has an increased local value after the collapse @ xmath95gyr and then decreases back to a constant value for the rest of the evolution . this model behaviour is similar to that observed by baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) in their study . it is also similar to the behaviour for the k100 model , although the amount of gas in the outer region is about 10 % less than in the k200 model . however , because the k100 model is stable until the post - collapse it is easy to see that the gas is constant post - collapse and tends towards equilibrium in the outerrate of evolution ( as previously noted by baumgardt & makino 2003 ) . the proper motion in the central region is similar to the observations of proper motion for pre - @ xmath0 stars ( giersz & heggie 1997 ; li et al . ) and can be caused by stars coming from the central region on radial orbits and ejected from the cluster at the expense of stars on eccentric orbits which make them harder to observe . in the inner central region ( outside the 10 % lagrangian radius ) the phase change is very small and intermediate between radial and eccentric orbits . therefore , the final phase is unknown . 1 . shown is the binary fraction of the entire cluster ( dotted line ) , inside the 10 % lagrangian radius ( black solid line ) and outside the radius ( white solid line ) . also shown is the binary fraction of main - sequence stars and stars within the half - light limit ( red solid line : which exactly matches the binary fraction of the entire cluster ) . compare with figure 1 of hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) . the first dashed line is shownat the time of the initial core - collapse , as in figure [ f : fig2 ] . [ f : fig6 ] , n = 317 ] hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) compared the distribution of binary fraction with values for the cluster of @ xmath0 - space - time @ xmath96 to @ xmath8 and the binary fraction from 0 . 05 to 0 . 05 . in particular , they found that the binary fraction of the cluster increases and the 95 % lagrangian distribution increases as the cluster progresses towards core - collapse while the overall binary fraction of the cluster remains close to the initial value . figure [ f : fig6 ] shows the same results for the k200 cluster . similar results were found in that the overall binary fraction increases significantly as the cluster progresses , particularly towards core - collapse when it is a factor of six or seven greater than the initial value , while the overall binary fraction will remain close to the initial value ( although the presence of a large number of nearly identical clusters would lead to an incorrect value ) . this provides some support to the results of hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) although values of @ @xmath0 ( and above ) is still evolving before the parameters for the formation of the milky way star clusters can be fully established . hurley et al . ( 2008 ) measured the binary fraction amongst main - sequence stars near the half - mass radius of ngc @ xmath13 and found it to be about 50 per cent . this was taken as evidence of the stable binary fraction of ngc @ xmath13 . building on the findings from hurley et al . ( 2008 ) , that the binary fraction of near the half - mass radius of the cluster can be taken as a reliable evidence of the ##rdial binary fraction . this is illustrated in : [ f : fig6 ] for our k200 model where we find that the binary fraction of main - sequence stars and those near the half - mass radius of the cluster remains at about the same level throughout the cluster . the horizontal dotted line denotes the time identified with the end of the initial core - collapse phase for this model . [ f : fig7 ] , width = 317 ] next not for the k100 model . the horizontal dotted line denotes the time identified with the end of the initial core - collapse phase for this model . [ f : fig8 ] , width = 317 ] nextwe look at the differences in units for the k200 simulation in figure [ f : fig7 ] and for the k100 simulation in figure [ f : fig8 ] . here we note that for the @ xmath97 % lagrangian simulation , the energy and mass for the two regions are very different . as such the binding energy per star increases as we move closer towards the galactic center , although the energies of the 5 - 10 % and 10 - 20 % regions are lower towards the end of the simulation . we note that the average binding energy is expressed in the local ##ised units of @ xmath98 to allow for comparison of the binding energies of the two different regions . adding to the energy of @ xmath99 ##8 based on the average binding energy of the cluster stars ( e . g . mcmillan 1993 ) increases the k100 values by a factor of two compared to the k200 simulation , i . e . the regions have much higher binding energies than the regions with cluster stars . slight changes in the binding energy occur in the regions when stars cluster ( as shown by kpper , kroupa & baumgardt 2008 ) although these are less pronounced in figure [ f : fig8] due to more careful calculations . the energy per star in the ~ 1 % region of mass starts out slowly for most stars , at around the 5 - 10 % range . however , the expansion of the k - system in the k200 region from @ xmath100gyr onwards is obvious to us , increasing the binding energy by about two orders of magnitude to a sudden peak when the star is ejected from the system . significant increases in binding energy are also seen at various temperatures and result from the formation of tight bonds by the stars . for example , the increase in the 50 - 60 % lagrangian region at @ xmath101myr in figure [ f : fig7 ] results from a rare event in which outer - shell fusion produces a short - period binary consisting of two white dwarfs which subsequently come into contact and fuse . thus the binary retains the energy in this region for a short period and then disappears . we see a more significant increase in the binding energy in the 1 % region at @ xmath102myr in figure [ f : fig7 ] . this is seen when a main - sequence star and a black dwarf form a short - period binary via an orbital resonance . the binary isfor the @ xmath103myr in the diagram , only the main - sequence star was swallowed by the black hole . it is reasonable to ask if the characteristics of these long - lived binary systems were different ? the binary that resulted in the formation of two wds would not produce a wd with a mass in excess of the chandrasekhar constant and could not be a true population ii star ( see shara & hurley 2002 ) . however , the resulting wd would be very large , massive and _ _ _ . thus it could be expected to be one of the largest wds in the universe for several gyrs and would be easily observed . the second binary that resulted in the main - sequence star being tidally locked and swallowed by the black - hole of @ xmath104 . this could be expected to give rise to a burst of x - rays and possibly gamma - rays , along the lines of li et al . ( 2011 : albeit for a supermassive black hole ) . . observations of core - collapse , @ xmath105 , and extended timescales , @ xmath106 , for the k200 and k100 stars . note that the sequence @ xmath106 iscompare to @ xmath107gyr and @ xmath108gyr for the k200 and k100 simulations , respectively . also included is the time for the cluster to lose half of the initial mass , @ xmath109 . [ t : table1 ] [ t = " < , > , > " , t = " , " , ] timescales for open cluster simulations are difficult to study , with the time until core - collapse and the time until collapse being also of interest ( e . g . gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . however , the comparison of these with @ xmath0 ##9 theoretical models of galaxies / stars is difficult ( baumgardt 2001 ) , especially since theoretical models of open clusters are out of date . in the [ t : table1 ] we show the following timescales for the k200 and k100 simulations : the time for half of the initial mass to be lost , the time until the start of the core - collapse , and the core - mass loss time until the end points . kpper et al . ( 2008 ) compared a series of open cluster simulations with a steady state model and found that the core - collapse time corresponds to thethe half - life formation times range from 1 for clusters formed from outside their tidal radius ( smaller @ xmath110 ) to 20 for clusters that entered their tidal radius from the outside ( larger @ xmath110 ) . our k200 model and the k100 model of hurley et al . ( 2008 ) differ by measuring their tidal radius and size @ xmath111 which is in perfect agreement with kpper et al . ( 2008 ) . baumgardt ( 2001 ) looked at the size of @ xmath0 - size clusters in terms of up to @ xmath112 low - mass stars . in this study the time for a cluster to reach stars of its size , @ xmath109 , was used as an estimate of the cluster size with @ xmath113 found to be the largest size . baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) then used their non - @ xmath0 model ( up to @ xmath114 + ) to once again show that at the same size as @ xmath115 was possible , this time for multi - body models that included multiple clusters . finally , we see from table [ 1 : table1 ] thatthe half - mass relaxation time varies greatly throughout the lifetime of the cluster and it is not always clear which model to use when comparing timescales . for an observed cluster it would be the same as the entire lifetime of the cluster . a better choice would be to use the same half - mass relaxation time throughout the lifetime of the cluster , @ xmath116 of . this is not true for an observed cluster . for the k200 and k100 simulations we find that @ xmath117 is the same for both models , and the data for this scaled timescale are in perfect agreement with the previous models . we also find that @ xmath109 compares very well with @ xmath118 . however , if we only use @ xmath119 , we will not find satisfactory results for either the core - collapse or half - collapse timescales . thus our agreement with the results found for other models is dependent on which @ xmath106 is used . we have proposed an @ xmath0 - based model that starts with @ xmath11 ##7 and then , up to the point of core - collapse , @ xmath5gyr and then @ xmath120and the smaller @ xmath4gyr . we have used our larger @ xmath0 - body model to explain the core - core - body fluctuations observed by the monte carlo approach of heggie & giersz ( 2008 ) and the smaller @ xmath0 - body / core approach of heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) . we have also shown that these fluctuations can be explained by the separation of the outer sub - core from the core . this produces a core that shows no signs that it has already gone through core - collapse . we have looked at how the results of these models relate to the model of smaller @ xmath0 and found similar results provided that certain parameters are used ( such as the full - radius to half - radius - ratio at core - collapse ) . in terms of these parameters , limitations exist : the core size at core - collapse is close enough to the upper limit for smaller @ xmath0 , for example . the effects of variables such as the core size and stellar radius have been studied and the observed behavior matches those from previous studies . but at other scales such as the transition to core - collapse and the core , we can find models with similar properties as thein the simulation , however this is dependent on which part of the wave - life and timescale is used . in fact , the reduction of relaxation time with @ xmath115 used in baumgardt ( 2001 ) could be achieved assuming that the initial @ xmath106 was used and not the final @ xmath106 . the @ xmath1 model described in this paper took the better part of a year for the helium - 4 model to complete . this shows the slow evolution of @ xmath0 used in the @ xmath0 - based model from the @ xmath59 model of giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) to the @ xmath89 model of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) . however , with the @ xmath121 used in our model at the time of @ xmath107gyr we are still only at the upper limit of the current observed wave - life . this is taking considerable effort . in fact , we are still some way from the completion of the full 10 - year model of the solar system ( heggie & smith 2003 ) . how can we move forward to reach that limit ?the move towards graphics processing units ( gpus ) as the primary processing unit for @ xmath0 - body codes , along with ongoing hardware development , provide opportunities ( nitadori & aarseth 2012 ) . simulations of @ xmath8 codes can be performed even on a single - gpu ( hurley & mackey 2010 ; zonoozi et al . 2011 ) and the advent of multi - gpu systems will likely make simulations of the problems described above possible in the near future . further hardware development and the expansion of efforts to develop large @ xmath0 - body codes ( spurzem 1999 ) will likely continue the trend towards large @ xmath0 . in this follow - up paper we will provide a detailed analysis of the binary and binary nature of our model . it is also our intention to make periodic observations taken at regular intervals throughout the life of the model available for others to _ find _ and use . these can be obtained by consulting the authors . at the beginning of this paper we noted that an important use of the non - @ xmath0 code would be to assist in the development of the monte carlo method . this is currently underway ( giersz et al . 2012) and to provide a graphical representation of @ xmath0 - m and @ ##m , from the same mathematical model . we acknowledge the financial support of the cordelia foundation and that of fred norton which has allowed amnh to purchase ring - shaped models and other equipment . we thank john miller for helping to develop the software for this project and ivan miller for the other two . aarseth s . j . , 1999 , pasp , 111 , 1333 aarseth s . j . , 2003 , numerical n - body dynamics : principles and techniques ( cambridge texts in theoretical physics ) . cambridge university press , cambridge aarseth s . j . , 2012 , mnras , 422 , 841 aarseth s . , hnon s . , wielen j . , 1974 , b & p , 1 , 183 baumgardt h . , 2001 , mnras , 325 , 1323 baumgardt h . , makino s . , 2003 , mnras , 340 , 227 binney j . , tremain j . , 1987 , fluid dynamics . princeton university press , princeton , j . a . , et al . , 2011 , 1 , 476 , 421 casertano a . , wilson j . , 1985 ,apj , 298 , 302 miller j . a . , richer r . j . , miller j . , miller j . , hurley j . , kalirai j . , richer r . j . , smith , d . j . , 2008 , aj , 112 , 2155 eggleton j . a . , fitchett j . , miller r . j . , 1989 , apj , 347 , 998 giersz m . , heggie d . c . , 1997 , mnras , 286 , 709 giersz m . , heggie d . c . , 2011 , mnras , 410 , 2698 giersz m . , heggie d . c . , hurley j . , hypki j . , 2012 , mnras ( arxiv : 1112 . 6246 ) gnedin j . a . , ostriker j . a . , 1997 , apj , 474 , 223 ##0 g . m . , 1996 , aj , 112 , 1487 heggie d . c . , 1975 , mnras , 173 , 729 heggie d . c . , 2011 , journal of the genetics society of america , 39 , 101 heggie d . c . ,giersz m . , 2008 , mnras , 389 , 1858 heggie d . c . , giersz m . , 2009 , mnras , 397 , l46 heggie d . c . , smith a . , 2003 , the one - body problem . cambridge university press , 2003 hurley j . r . , hall m . a . , aarseth s . j . , hall o . r . , 2001 , mnras , 323 , 630 hurley j . r . , hall c . a . , aarseth s . j . , hall o . r . , 2004 , mnras , 355 , 1207 hurley j . r . , 2007 , mnras , 379 , 590 hurley j . r . , aarseth s . j . , shara m . a . , 2007 , mnras , 665 , 707 hurley j . r . , shara m . a . , miller r . a . , miller j . a . , miller j . a . , kalirai j . a . , hansen j . m . a . , dotter j . , miller j . , fahlman j . m . , miller r . a . , 2008 , aj ,2 , 2129 hurley j . r . , mackey a . d . 2010 , mnras , 408 , 2353 jordn j . , et al . , 2005 , apj , 634 , 1002 miller j . i . , 1966 , aj , 72 , 73 kroupa p . , miller j . a . , gilmore g . , 1991 , mnras , 251 , 293 kroupa p . , miller j . a . , gilmore g . , 1993 , mnras , 262 , 545 kpper j . j . a . , kroupa p . , baumgardt a . , 2008 , mnras , 389 , 889 mackey a . d . , miller j . a . , miller j . a . , gilmore g . a . , 2007 , mnras , 379 , l40 hurley j . r . , hurley j . r . , sippel j . a . , 2012 , apj , 312 ( arxiv : 1208 . 0340 ) makino s . , 2002 , in shara s . a . , editor , 2002 , paper 263 , high winds , collisions and their consequences . springer , san francisco , p . 389 mateoj . , 1987 , apj , 323 , l41 mcmillan s . l . w . , 1993 , galaxies djorgovski s . , meylan j . , 1993 , galaxies , part ii , survey of galaxy clusters . springer , san francisco , p . 171 mcmillan s . , hut p . , makino j . , 1990 , apj , 362 , 522 nitadori s . , aarseth s . a . , 2012 , mnras , 424 , 545 plummer j . s . , 1911 , mnras , 317 , 460 portegies zwart j . a . , mcmillan s . l . w . , hut p . , makino j . , 2001 , mnras , 321 , 199 shara m . a . , hurley j . r . , 2002 , apj , 571 , 830 spurzem s . , 1999 , journal of mathematical and theoretical physics , 109 , 407 vesperini s . , heggie s . j . , 1997 , mnras , 289 , 898 von hoerner j . , 1963 , z . astrophys . , 47 , 200 hurley j . a . , hurley j . r . , mackey j. . . , gilmore j . m . , smith m . m . , 2003 , mnras , 343 , 1025 zonoozi a . m . , kpper m . j . m . , baumgardt m . , haghi m . , kroupa m . , hilker , m . , 2011 , mnras , 411 , 1989
