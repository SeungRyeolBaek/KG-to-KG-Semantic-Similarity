the ##ians of interest are a system of two first order differential operators , @ xmath3 where the @ xmath4 has derivative with respect to , @ xmath5 , and @ xmath6 . they can be viewed as the transfer function of the linear differential operator @ xmath7 with @ xmath8 the first order differential operator @ xmath9 generates a flow in euclidean space . if @ xmath10 does not depend strictly on @ xmath5 , the partial solution of ( [ hamiltonianflow ] ) becomes @ xmath11 in most cases this will be strictly true , but one can also split the hamiltonian into two parts , @ xmath12 , with a function of @ xmath13 such that the flow generated by @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 respectively are integrable . one can also use the cambell - hamilton - hausdorff formula to approximate the flow generated by @ xmath8 . one uses the strang ##ulation [ @ xcite @ xmath16 \ { ] + \ cdots } , \ ] ] which shows that : splitting this flow with a timestep @ xmath1 gives an approximation with reasonable accuracyof solving @ xmath0 , and satisfying the symplectic equation of the system . this leads to the symplectic splitting scheme of all the steps of solving @ xmath17 . the second part of one formulation can be confused with the first part of the other , unless one deals with the dependent variables and wants to know the state of the system at the next stage . from a mathematical point of view the most important feature of this formulation is that it can be expressed directly in terms of random walks . for example , for hamiltonians @ xmath18 , the usual splitting scheme is to solve @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 . in that case ( [ symplecticsplitting ] ) refers to the collection of freely streaming particles and kicks at different time intervals @ xmath1 , these particles represent states of the state @ xmath21 of the system . i . e , we can think of the concept of a collection of _ particles _ and _ states _ @ xcite . it is not clear that this is the correct way to describe and represent the current state of the quantum system . for example , why should the collection of particles represent the freely streaming state of @ xmath22 ? what shouldvery difficult to split the hamiltonian into two integrable solutions @ xcite ; the first solution is most likely the one which best fits the form of it ( [ hamiltonequation ] ) . however , since this solution is defined _ exactly _ ( [ symplecticsplitting ] ) for any odd value of @ xmath1 we will not necessarily expect @ xmath23 to be _ exactly _ @ xmath24 as long as it reaches this value very quickly for @ xmath25 . we can use this fact to improve the efficiency of the splitting scheme ( [ symplecticsplitting ] ) in a practical setting . we are , of course , making the first attempt to work on the strmer - verlet splitting scheme . an extensive list of the previous attempts can be found at link @ xcite . neri @ xcite has developed the first method to find symplectic solutions for hamiltonian equations . david and david @ xcite developed the # fouth ##ing method for the solution of hamiltonian equations for the most non - trivial order . yoshida @ xcite worked on the symplectic method for any odd value , and suzuki @ xcite developed the method ofhow the control of the approximants can be applied to optimization problems . for a simple example of our approach see the hamiltonian @ xmath26 whose optimal behaviour over the time interval @ xmath1 & @ xmath27 } ^ { \ begin { r } } \ begin { pmatrix } = \ begin { pmatrix * } [ 1 ] \ sin \ tau & \ sin \ tau \ \ -

and - kick _ start algorithm , with @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 , the result of @ xmath36 \ ^ { \ begin { 1 } } \ begin { pmatrix } = \ begin { pmatrix * } [ \ ] + - \ frac { 1 } { 1 } \ begin { 1 } \ begin { 1 } \ tau ^ 2 &( 1 -

kick - move _ step operator is @ xmath49 as well . differs from the usual notation for the first order , but the confusion can be reduced by allowing higher order terms @ xmath50 to be used for both the _ move _ and _ kick _ steps . similar to the two - dimensionalto with potential @ xmath51 this agrees with equation ( [ harmonicoscillatorcorrection ] ) . with this correction the _ kick - move - kick _ splitting scheme agrees with the exact solution to @ xmath52 order in @ xmath1 , but differ in the @ xmath53 -

dimensional problem with equation @ xmath51 this corresponds with : ( [ harmonicoscillatorcorrection ] ) . with this solution the _ kick - kick - kick _ kick correction agrees with the original solution to @ xmath59 ##0 , @ xmath1 , but not in the @ xmath60 - order . we can apply the correction indefinitely , but this is still far beyond the scope of our applications today . addition of the problematic terms @ xmath61 is in fact necessary for integration of the _ move _ steps . the solution , @ xmath62 can now be solved exactly , preserving the symplectic structure . the result is impossible for the kinectic equations @ xmath63 , since it now reduces to equations @ xmath64 which are no longer possible to solve exactly . although the problematic terms are removed we should make sure that the _ move _ steps preserve the symplectic structure exactly . then @ xmath65 take the solution and the##a just before the _ move _ step , and @ xmath66 the next and a just after . we have the following : @ xcite @ xmath67 , with @ xmath68 this is the symplectic solution ; we only need to use @ xmath69 to order the _ move _ step as well . consider also the problem without the - term . the solution @ xmath70 is @ xmath71 which is the exact solution . we add the @ xmath72 - term to the _ move _ step . to change @ xmath73 the exact position of x ( [ movesteps ] ) gives @ xmath74 \ begin { exactmove } \ \ [ -

order method is used or not will depend on the system under consideration , and the optimal solution . as happens with higher order methods the increased complexity per step can be explained by the increased computational cost per step @ xcite . m . cohen ,j . jahnke , j . muller , and j . lubich , _ numerical analysis for nonlinear -
