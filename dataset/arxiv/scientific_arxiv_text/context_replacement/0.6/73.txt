both cosmic ray expansion rates and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity have been observed to reach their peak at @ xmath32 @ xcite . since the early universe , a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) has existed at the center of s - type galaxies with the black hole density roughly corresponding with that of the disk or its companion @ xcite . the interaction and co - evolution between the galactic smbh and host galaxies has also been studied @ xcite . in one of the most popular co - evolution scenarios , disk galaxies have been observed to pump gas into the center of galaxies , leading to a massive starburst and the formation of the smbh @ xcite . a popular approach to studying the disk - dominated co - evolution scenario is to study the expansion rates of agn host galaxies . however , these studies have yielded mixed results . on one hand , the two low - mass x - ray - agn galaxies ( @ xmath4erg and @ xmath5 ) have similar disk - dominated spectra to those of non - host galaxies , with a significant difference in the gas content , namely at @ xmath6 @ xcite and at @ xmath7 @ xcite .on the other hand , the highest merger fraction ( @ xmath8 ) has been observed in a subsample of the brightest ( @ xmath9erg s @ xmath5 ) , iron - rich galaxies @ xcite . this may lead to the conclusion that this process is dependent on agn physical properties @ xcite . there are also theoretical models suggesting that these mergers may involve the agn process . other physical processes may be involved in most luminous agns @ xcite . therefore , it is important to understand the relationship between the most luminous agns and merger fraction . however , # ##era studies of the most luminous agns ( @ xmath9erg s @ xmath5 ) and @ xmath7 are lacking in the literature . for the most luminous agns , era studies have been dominated by the brightest blue sources , consistent with the current understanding of the source substraction @ xcite . the extensive use of deep and galactic surveys is biased against the brightest x - ray source agns . / / _ wide - field _ survey explorer _ ( _ nasa _ ; smith et al . 2010 ) all - sky survey provided an opportunity to study the most luminous sources .mid - infrared emission . @ xcite and @ xcite discovered a new population of hyperluminous , hot dust - obscured galaxies ( called hot dogs ) using the so - called ` ` w1w2 ##e ' ' - process . follow - up studies have revealed several interesting properties of this population : ( 1 ) the follow - up studies revealed that they are very high - mass galaxies , with mass ranging from 1 to 10 @ xcite . ( 2 ) properties of the population are highly consistent with @ xmath10 @ xcite . ( 3 ) using x - ray spectroscopy @ xcite and surface energy distribution ( sed ) analysis ( assef et al . 2015a ; smith et al . 2016a ) , strong evidence has been found that their strong mid - infrared emission is caused by a hot dust - obscured , hot gas - dominated agn . due to the extreme obscuration of circumnuclear structure , the host galaxy of this population is easily determined . the hot dogs are good candidates for astronomers to study the formation processes of the more distant agns . in this section , we list the host galaxies of the hot dogs , which include _ the _ telescope ( hst )_ wide - field telescope 3 ( wfc3 ) near - ir high - resolution imaging . our goal is to gain an understanding of the decay rates of the most likely agns . for this purpose we use a typical @ xmath11cdm telescope with @ xmath12 , and @ xmath5 , @ xmath13 , and @ xmath14 . the hot dogs shown below are selected from the _ sky _ to - earth _ catalog @ xcite . in order to study the host morphology of hot dogs , we compare a subsample of our targets ( figure 1 ) with the _ hst _ wfc3 images . we can assume that they have a high priority in the catalog @ xcite for studying their physical properties . to investigate the host morphology of hot dogs , we use the high resolution _ hst _ wfc3 near - ir imaging . we select our targets and use the available images from them . images come from four _ hst cameras with instruments at 12488 ( pi : a . negrello ) , 12585 ( pi : c . smith ) , 12481 and 12930 ( pi : c . smith ) .we plot hst ##d - data for this sample in table 2 . all but one ( w0831 + 0140 ) use the _ f160w _ ( @ xmath15 - sample ) imaging . the w0831 + 0140 uses the _ f110w _ imaging . the wfc3 image has a pixel density of 0 . 5 bits / pixel . . the sample of hot dog [ tbl - sample ] [ x = " < , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] we plot the total merger fraction ( @ xmath1 ) for the hot dog sample , using the # ##ization used in table 2 . given the high agn - abundance ( @ xmath16 ) of the hot dog sample , this result is very strong evidence that the highly massive agns have not been linked to star formation . in order to determine the effect of merger fraction on agn - abundance , we select the stars in the sample and plot them in table 2 . green diamonds are selected from the sample of @ xcite . , and blue diamonds , which represent the stars of the site @ xmath6 and of @ xmath7 , are, as seen from the previous study @ xcite . our data for the noble gas sample has been described with an appendix . among all the samples , our sample is the second largest , which has the spectral density much less than that of the dust - rich qso found at @ xcite . the strongest evidence can be seen in figure 2 that the merger fraction agrees with agn spectral parameters at low temperatures , but the merger fraction shows a strong dependence on agn spectral parameters for the most luminous agns . we compare the observed data with the correlation - based data of @ xcite ( red and blue lines in figure 2 ) . red and blue lines match the spectra of @ xcite , at @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 , respectively . the merger fraction of our sample agrees well with the predictions found at @ xmath7 . the observed spectra at @ xmath7 of near - infrared bright qsos ( red triangle , del ##ong et al . 2016 ) , dust - rich agns ( red triangle , lanzuisi et al . 2015 ) and dust - thick qsos ( red triangle , glikman et al .2015 ) , the combined results also show a good fit with the original data . as suggested by @ xcite , planetary processes , especially planetary mergers , may play the most important role in explaining the highly distorted agns of @ xmath7 . in figure 3 , we show the distribution of srsic ##s in our hot dog sample . the distribution is reduced @ xmath19 , ranging from disk - dominated ( @ xmath20 ) , but with a large bulge , ( 1 . 0 @ xmath21n @ xmath213 . 0 ) to disk - dominated ( @ xmath22 ) . the values of disk - dominated , disk and bulge - dominated indices are 58 . 9 % , 59 . 1 % and 60 . 8 % , respectively , in our hot dog sample . we inform the reader that a single srsic model wo , is a good fit for the two reduced hot dogs . for example , both w0851 + 3148 and w2207 + 1939 show large mean differences ( see figure 3 ) and the results of a single srsic model wo show a large fraction of the mean @ xmath23 ( > 40 ) . also , for each of our hot dogs ,the combined srsic profile alone is a good estimate . generally speaking , the srsic profile with @ xmath24 will represent the number of galaxy clusters of hot dogs . our conclusion is that most of our hot dogs have an intermediate morphology ( one with a large central region ) . the intermediate morphology of hot dogs has been observed in the gas - rich phase if hot dogs are in the intermediate phase when the ones with gas - rich regions are considered as clusters . so this letter is an accurate report on the results of our previous study . the @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 values of our hot dogs range from 0 . 75 to 0 . 75 with a median value of . 75 , and from @ xmath27 to @ xmath28 with a median value of @ xmath29 , respectively . we use the @ xmath30 relation to describe the mergers using the cluster model of lotz et al . 18 out of 19 hot dogs have the relation @ xmath31 , considering them as clusters . the total merger probability ( @ xmath3272 % ) given above is also consistent with the results of our morphological classification . for this relation , we use the relation @ _ hst _ wfc3 .- infrared spectroscopy to estimate the merger fraction of a subsample of the hot dogs by stellar mass . we find that the merger fraction is high ( @ xmath1 ) for our hot dog model . the high merger fraction of these highly luminous , heavily - obscured agns is consistent with the results of hydrodynamical models @ xcite and the space - based model @ xcite . we also estimate the agn by mass fraction using the seds models . the heavily obscured agns in hot dogs are among the most luminous agns in the universe ( @ xmath2 ) . the visible radio emissions from hot dogs are very high ( see figure 2 ) , indicating that there is a starburst in the universe . both the agn and starburst events are likely caused by mergers as indicated by the high merger fraction . however , the selection of a comparison sample may reflect the merger - driven nature of hot dogs . therefore , it is difficult to select a good comparison sample , as both the stellar mass and black hole mass of hot dogs are not yet known . the upper mass - limit of hot dogs derived from sed models at @ xcite and at @ xmath33 . , and the stars at @ x##math34 shows a very good distribution of the merger ##s . for instance , the @ xmath35 samples from the elliptical galaxy group with the highest solar mass @ xmath36 show strong merging in @ xcite . this new data suggests that the high merger fraction of our hot dog sample is partly responsible for all the observed agn variability . according to all the observed brightness data , we found that the number of srsic ##s of hot dogs is at 10 , which indicates that most of the dogs have low brightness . from the point of view of observation , this result supports our previous findings ( wang et al . 2016a ) , which suggested that hot dogs may be a major event during the formation of new stars , moving from the dark starburst ##ing phase to the more active qso phase . we can see that the samples with high merger fraction are uv - rich @ xcite and / or super - luminous ( this sample ) in phase 2 . as for the other , dark qsos , no high merger fraction with a major merger component has been found . for example , @ xcite has found an ir / ir - rich @ xmath37 qso sample with high super - luminous black hole content ( @ xmat##h38 ) , which is due to the low smbh abundance of the stars @ xcite . they found that the optical extinction rate for qso galaxies was low and similar to that of radio galaxies . they also found that major mergers are not the main driving force for agn evolution . the relationships between them are complicated . however , the problem can be solved if assuming that visible / ir - selected qsos and infrared - selected active qsos represent different stages in the merger - driven evolutionary model @ xcite . in the merger - driven evolutionary model , gas - driven major mergers have an initial starburst and a period of rapid star decay , followed by an unobscured phase where the gas is absorbed and ejected from the galaxy by qso stars . after starburst , smgs and hot stars may be the final products of the merger . they are expected to have a high merger fraction , which has not been determined ( e . g . , bussmann et al . ir - selected agns formed at an early stage of the merger . thus the only gas is not present in their host galaxy . as a result , the high merger fraction can be estimated according to local characteristics . ) for unobscured qsos whose nuclei are expected to be in darktherefore , they are in a critical stage of formation , just as the young stars fall into the # ##s . we conclude that the observed brightness and obscuration should be used for predicting the high formation rates of agn stars . we note that this result is also true for radio - loud agns . it would be different than for radio - loud agns @ xcite . a similar merger model has also been proposed by @ xcite for x - ray bright agn , radio - bright agn , metal - rich , and unobscured agn ( see their discussion below ) . we thank the authors for the quick response and the additional information that will support our conclusion . this paper is supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( nsfc , no . 11203023 , 11303084 , 11303002 and 11433005 ) , the national research council for the northeast china ( wk3440000001 ) . it acknowledges the support from qilu young stars group of shandong university . yh acknowledges the support from the bright star telescope association . gf acknowledges the support from the china space science research foundation ( 2014fb155 ) . chen , c . s . , tanvir, d . m . , wang , j . c . , et al . 1996 , , 279 , l47 alexander , d . m . , & hickox , d . m . 2012 , newar , 1 , 25 assef , r . j . , eisenhardt , j . a . s . , smith , j . , et al . 2015 , , 804 , 147 assef , r . j . , alexander , d . m . , brightman , m . , et al . 2015 , arxiv : 1511 . 05155 smith , j . a . , & alexander , d . m . 2015 , , 1 , 25 bussmann , j . s . , dey , m . , lotz , j . , et al . 2011 , , 733 , 147 chiaberge , m . , gilli , m . , lotz , j . s . , & smith , j . 2015 , , 806 , 147 smith , j . , jahnke , m . , inskip , r . a . , et al . 2011 , , 726 , 147 cutri , r . a . , & et al . 2013 , , online online version , 2328, & del ##any , l . , draper , d . r . , bauer , m . j . , et al . 2016 , , 456 , 2105 miller , d . r . , & ballantyne , d . r . 2012 , , 751 , 173 eisenhardt , m . j . a . , liu , y . , tsai , s . -
