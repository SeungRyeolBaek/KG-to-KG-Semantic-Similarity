this work on the american options under mixed transaction costs dates back to the original proof by @ xcite that to protect against a buyer who can exercise the option at any ( optimal ) stopping time , the option must in effect be protected against all mixed ( optimal ) stopping times . this was proved by @ xcite , which provided a non - constructive dual representation for the set of strategies superhedging the seller ' ( but not the buyers ' ) interest in the american option under transaction costs . the computational methods for computing the higher and lower transaction costs of the option , the transaction costs , the stopping times as well as the representations for both the seller and the buyer of an american option under transaction costs were developed by @ xcite in a model with two assets , and @ xcite in a multi - asset model . both these approaches take it for granted that the seller can only exercise the option once , at any optimal stopping time of his choice . in contrast , in the above example we give the buyer the option to exercise the american option twice , rather than all within a fixed time interval . since it would be possible in general to exercise a fraction of the option , and to hold on to the option to exercise it gradually , the probability of that fractionportfolio of agents may also choose to exercise the same options on different days if that is beneficial . does this freedom to exercise options affect the time frame , pricing strategies and the response time for the buyer and / or seller ? not surprisingly , the answer to this question is yes , it comes in the form of transaction costs . gradual exercise turns out to be due to a mechanism , referred to as market closure , which will also be discussed here . if a sudden loss of confidence occurs in the market , as evidenced by very short bid - offer spreads , agents might become solvent . being allowed to return to their options until it is exhausted will cause them to become solvent once again . this allows more flexibility when choosing pricing strategies than the usual requirement that agents should be solvent at all times . @ xcite was the first to explore the consequences of gradual exercise and portfolio closing in a model with a single single asset as a starting point . in the following years these consequences were explored in a different way and led to the much more general case of the multi - asset pricing model with transaction costs similar to @ xcite ; see also @ xcite and @ xcite . finance and optimization for the study of theamerican option with transaction costs is a convex optimization problem regardless of whether instant or gradual exercise is used . however , this is not true for the buyer . in this case one has to solve a non - convex optimization problem for options that can only be bought once . a very important feature of gradual exercise is that pricing and optimization is a convex optimization problem only for the case of the american option , making it possible to use convex optimization methods . the simplicity of the problem also makes it much easier to apply the pricing and optimization methods together . we will make use of this new approach in this paper . the paper is structured as follows . section [ et - multi - curr - et ] describes the general ##ization of kabanov with multi - option portfolio with transaction costs . in section [ et : et - versus - et - exe ] the optimization problems for the buyer and seller and the american option portfolio under gradual exercise are described and treated with the same detail as instant exercise . a simple example is set up to show that it is possible to hedge american option and that the bid - offer ratio of the option prices can be reduced under gradual exercise as compared to instant exercise . this .[ sec : buyer ] the seller s price is discussed in detail . the problem of price choice is then introduced and linked in theorem [ sec : am : seller : bu - price ] with the auction strategy for the purchase of the option , with gradual exercise . the set of seller s price strategies are then constructed and linked to the bid price of the buyer with gradual exercise and to the set of the seller s price strategies for the option purchase ; see theorem [ am : seller : zau0 = bu - price ] . the dual representation of the seller s price is established in theorem [ sec : buy - ultimate - construct ] . the toy example is used to illustrate the dual model and results for the problem . theorem [ sec : buyer ] is related to the seller s price . seller s price sets and strategies are constructed and linked to determine the bid price of the buyer ; see theorem [ prop : 2012 - 07 - 01 : buy - ultimate ] . finally , the dual model for the seller is established in theorem [ sec : bu - ultimate ] . once again , the toy example serves to illustrate the problem . the dual model with real coefficients can be found in theorem [ sec : buy##m - 1 ] . the current and possible future versions and applications are elaborated upon in section [ 2 : 1 ] . more details and examples are given in the section . let @ xmath0 be a conditional probability distribution . we assume that @ xmath1 is true , @ xmath2 , @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 for each @ xmath5 . for each @ xmath6 let @ xmath7 be the collection of nodes of @ xmath8 , called the _ successor _ of the binary currency model . a node @ xmath9 is said to be the _ successor _ of a node @ xmath10 if @ xmath11 . for each @ xmath12 we replace the collection of atoms of the other node @ xmath10 by @ xmath13 . for each @ xmath6 let @ xmath14 be the collection of @ xmath8 - and @ xmath15 - independent random variables . we replace nodes of @ xmath16 with those of @ xmath7 whenever possible . we use the discrete - time currency model developed by @ xcite and developed further by @ xcite and@ xcite among others . the algorithm exchanges @ xmath17 units of assets . for each exchange rate @ xmath18 and for each @ xmath19 a unit of asset @ xmath20 can be obtained by exchanging @ xmath21 units of asset @ xmath22 . we assume that the exchange rates @ xmath23 are @ xmath8 - valued and @ xmath24 for all @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 . we assume that a portfolio @ xmath27 has to be _ transformed _ into a portfolio @ xmath28 at time @ xmath25 whenever there are @ xmath8 - valued random variables @ xmath29 , @ xmath30 such that for all @ xmath31 @ xmath32 where @ xmath33 is the number of units of asset @ xmath20 obtained as a result of exchanging two units of asset @ xmath22 . the _ _ transformed _ @ xmath34 is the number of assets that are _ transformed _ at time @ xmath25 , i . e . the portfolio at time @ xmath25 that can be transformedinto processes with non - negative holdings are the @ xmath17 positions . it is easy to see that @ xmath35 is the convex cone generated by the convex basis @ xmath36 of @ xmath15 and the basis @ xmath37 for @ xmath30 , and that @ xmath35 is a convex cone , but smaller . note that @ xmath35 has all the non - negative holdings of @ xmath16 . a _ trading strategy _ @ xmath38 . a _ @ xmath15 - trading strategy with initial value @ xmath39 and initial value @ xmath40 . for all @ xmath41 the basis @ xmath42 is transferred from time @ xmath43 to time @ xmath25 . let @ xmath44 be the set of trading strategies . we say that @ xmath45 is an _ self - financing _ condition whenever @ xmath46 for all @ xmath12 . note that the other _ self - financing condition is included in the definition of @ xmath44 . a trading strategy @ xmath45 is an _ trading strategy _ if it is self - financing, @ xmath47 and there exists a portfolio @ xmath48 with non - zero condition , and @ xmath17 , such that @ xmath49 . this condition of equality was introduced by @ xcite , and its definition is roughly equivalent but identical to the original non - zero condition introduced by @ xcite . [ th : 2012 - 10 - 03 : ftap ] the portfolio has one such condition if and only if there exists a probability of @ xmath50 equal to @ xmath51 and by @ xmath15 - pair @ xmath50 - pair @ xmath52 such that @ xmath53 where @ xmath54 is the value of @ xmath55 ; see ( [ th : 2012 - 09 - 03 : aast ] ) in the figure . we denote by @ xmath56 the set of pairs @ xmath57 satisfying the conditions in theorem [ th : 2012 - 10 - 03 : ftap ] , and by @ xmath58 the set of pairs @ xmath57 satisfying the conditions in theorem [ th : 2012 - 10 - 03 : ftap ] , with @ xmath50 .defined with respect to ( and not necessarily equal to ) @ xmath51 . we assume for the purposes of this definition that the model has only infinite pairs , i . e . @ xmath59 . in place of the compact @ xmath60 we can equivalently define the so - called _ _ _ _ _ @ xmath61 ; _ @ xcite . we also assume for all @ xmath62 @ xmath63 in the model of , @ xmath54 has a non - trivial compact @ xmath64 - generated - cone for all @ xmath25 ( * ? ? ? * = 1 . 5 ) , which implies that @ xmath65 . ( for the definition of a compact @ xmath64 - generated cone , see : [ subsect : x - x - x ] . ) the price of the american option in the model with @ xmath17 generated price is , in fact , an @ xmath15 - generated price of @ xmath66 . the seller of the american option is obliged to pay , and the buyer is obliged to pay the price of the @ xmat##h67 is the stopping time @ xmath68 chosen by the buyer . # @ xmath69 is the number of stopping times with probability of @ xmath70 . this is the first case in which the option is exercised _ immediately _ at a stopping time @ xmath68 . other options with the requirement for immediate exercise of the multi - agent model with different transaction costs have been studied by @ xcite , who established a non - linear version of the superhedging strategy for the option seller strategy , and by @ xcite , who established more general linear versions of the give and take auction strategies and the superhedging strategies for both the option seller and buyer . in the latter case we ignore the fact that the option has to be exercised immediately at a stopping time @ xmath68 . instead , we allow the buyer to exercise _ immediately _ at a mixed stopping time @ xmath71 . ( for the case of mixed stopping times , # # [ category : mixed - stopping - times ] . ) if the buyer decides to exercise the option _ immediately to a mixed stopping time @ xmath71 , then the seller of the american option will be unable to exercise , and the buyerto be able to sell the portfolio @ xmath72 of the portfolio of assets @ xmath73 at any time @ xmath6 . the question then is whether or not it would be more efficient for the buyer to sell the portfolio quickly rather than immediately ? what would be the optimal real - time @ xmath71 for the buyer ? how should the buyer hedge against rapid exercise ? are the sell ( seller s ) and buy ( buyer s ) option prices and trading points reduced by rapid exercise as opposed to slow exercise ? in the case of rapid exercise the buyer of the option portfolio @ xmath74 needs to hedge by means of the trading strategy @ xmath45 against all the price points @ xmath68 set by the buyer . the trading strategy @ xmath75 needs to be price - consistent up to time @ xmath76 and to enable the buyer to become profitable by selling the portfolio @ xmath67 at time @ xmath76 , for time @ xmath68 . then the set of buyer - superhedging points is determined by @ xmath77 and the _ _ _ _ ( _ buyer _ s _ ) ofthe option in currency @ xmath62 is @ xmath78 this is the largest amount in currency @ xmath64 needed to superhedge the short option at @ xmath74 . on the other hand , the purchase of a short option @ xmath74 can have both a trading strategy @ xmath68 and a trading strategy @ xmath45 . the trading strategy @ xmath75 needs to be self - sufficient up to time @ xmath76 and to allow the buyer to be active after buying the option @ xmath67 at time @ xmath76 . thus , the number of buyer s superhedging strategies is given as @ xmath79 and the _ bid price _ ( _ buyer s _ _ ) of the option in currency @ xmath62 is @ xmath80 this is the largest amount in currency @ xmath64 that the buyer can buy with the option @ xmath74 as well . for the firms with no option , the sum of the option and bid price of @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 and the respective buyer s and seller s superhedging strategiesfrom @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 , denoted by @ xcite . when the buyer is unable to maintain control , the seller has to use a different buying strategy to maximize his profit . since the seller will respond to the buyer ' s , this strategy will in turn depend on the market buying strategy @ xmath71 used by the buyer , and may be denoted by @ xmath85 . in other words , we create a portfolio @ xmath86 . for each time @ xmath25 the buyer will be buying the portfolio @ xmath87 and will be able to take a percentage @ xmath72 of the portfolio @ xmath73 . he will then rebalance the resulting portfolio @ xmath88 into @ xmath89 in a self - financing manner , so that @ xmath90the self - financing and superhedging strategies are combined into one . we call ( [ example : fin - to - fin - superhedge ] ) the _ rebalancing _ strategy . when buying the portfolio @ xmath87 each time @ xmath43 , the buyer will only use assets purchased at that time . this means @xmath91 , and the seller has no way of knowing the exact strategy @ xmath92 that will be adopted by the buyer . the trading strategies @ xmath85 that will be adopted by the buyer are exactly equivalent to those of the _ _ - default _ condition @ xmath93 in general , the _ price @ xmath94 of the trading strategy @ xmath95 is the same for all @ xmath71 . we denote this endowment value by @ xmath96 . we compare the values of non - superhedging strategies against the trading strategy @ xmath97 and the _ _ _ price _ ( _ _ _ _ _ ) of the option in currency @ xmath98 . @ xmath99 this is the stock option in currency @ xmath22 that the seller uses to superhedge the short position in the stock market @ xmath74 when the buyer is ready to buy it . on the other hand , the seller is allowed to choose between the _ exercise strategy @ xmath71 and the trading strategy @ xmath45 , and will be allowed choice of a price @ xmath72 of the short##off @ xmath73 with stopping time @ xmath25 . because the value of the chosen stopping time @ xmath100 is available to the buyer , the american option @ xmath75 needs to be satisfied only for the first given stopping time , and does not need to be considered as a subset of @ xmath100 , in contrast to the ' s ' . the _ rebalancing _ strategy @ xmath101 needs to be satisfied . similarly , the family of superhedging strategies for the sale of the american option @ xmath74 with continuous time is known as @ xmath102 and the highest _ bid _ _ ( _ _ _ _ _ ) of the option in currency @ xmath98 is @ xmath103 this is the only option in currency @ xmath22 that can be sold with the intention of moving to a buyer who is willing to sell it .
