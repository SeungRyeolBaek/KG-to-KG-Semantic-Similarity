the so - called ` ` special mass distribution ' ' discovered by the european physics collaboration ( emc ) starting in 1988 is one of the most important discoveries in the history of particle physics @ xcite , @ xcite . the development of the fields of high energy and neutron scattering is closely related to this epoch - making discovery . however , one of the most important discoveries made today in this area of physics is the discovery and the systematic study of the physical observables called special parton distribution functions ( gpd ) . it has been shown that the gpds , which can be obtained by the so - called deep - virtual spin measurements ( dvcs ) or the deep - virtual spin measurements ( dvmp ) , contain much more information than the ordinary parton distribution functions @ xcite @ xcite . roughly speaking , the gpds are composed of the parton distributions and the principal scale factors of the particles . the gpds in the most general case are composed of three kinematical components : the total # ##ness fraction @ xmath1 of the special parton between the initial and final states , the skewdness fraction @ xmath3 which is the difference betweenthe point groups , and the one - dimensional - distribution function @ xmath4 of the initial and final states . in the backward limit @ xmath5 , some of the gpds reduce to the usual proton , electron and proton distributions . on the other hand , from the @ xmath0 - the sum of the gpds with respect to the energy @ xmath1 , one gets the sum of the electromagnetic form factors of the proton , which are also the electromagnetic form factors of the electron . the complex nature of the gpds , i . e . the fact that they are composed of many variables , makes it very difficult to understand their true meaning both physically and theoretically . from the physical perspective , it would be best to start off with the two main limits . the first is the forward limit of the momentum distribution . we have shown that , in this limit , some of the gpds reduce to the usual parton distribution functions based on the variable @ xmath1 . however , it turns out that , even in this limit , there are two very different distribution functions , which can only be explained by the all - but - one field theory . . ., it was discovered by researchers that each of these distributions provides additional information on the spin angular momentum contributed by the magnetic moment of the spin @ xcite @ xcite . this information , together with the additional information about the total spin structure , makes it possible to compute the total spin angular momentum contribution to the total nuclear structure more directly . a relatively - easy - to - compute distribution is the generalized form factors of the spin @ xcite , @ xcite , which are given as the pull - apart spin matrix elements of the spin - @ xmath0 , spin - @ , and @ distributions . since these two distributions are given as the spin matrix elements of the distributions , they can be part of the same calculations . ( these should be contrasted with parton distributions . the actual calculation of parton distributions is outside the domain of lattice quantum mechanics , since one has to compute the spin matrix elements of the bilinears , which are _ nonlocal and _ _ . ) in fact , two groups , the lhpc , and the qcdsf , have measured the generalized form factors of the distributions , and obtained the experimental results , whichwill in fact be possible with the use of gpds in the near future @ xcite @ xcite . although possible , there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe that the results of these lattice simulations are correct ones . the reason is probably that the previously mentioned lattice simulations were carried out in the heavy ion regime at @ xmath6 with some of the so - called bound states . our physical limit is very close to the chiral limit with large quantum numbers , and we know that , in this case , the lattice model plays some important role in the physical properties of the system . the lattice simulation carried out in the heavy ion regime is in danger of losing an important part of chiral symmetry . on the other hand , the chiral quantum field model ( cqsm ) is an experimental model of lattice , which also explains the chiral ##ity of lattice and its theoretical extensions @ xcite , @ xcite . ( see @ xcite @ xcite for further results . ) it is also applied to the study of the parton effect , with important results @ xcite @ xcite . for example , an important study of π - and π - spin##quark mass was found to be sufficient to perform the first nmc experiment , which showed the superiority of the @ xmath7 - particle over the @ xmath8 - particle in the lattice @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite . therefore , it would be interesting to see what predictions the cqsm would make for the particles mentioned above . however , the main aim of the theoretical analysis is to introduce the generalized form factor of the proton into the framework of the cqsm and compare its predictions with those of the lattice qc ##d . of our main interest here is to compare the analysis of the experimental results against the predictions of the proton mass . such an analysis is expected to give useful information for improving the accuracy of the lattice qc model at the present time for the observables in question . the structure of the model is as follows . in sect . ii , we shall first explain how to introduce the nonzero proton mass into the framework of the cqsm with born - villars formula . in sect . iii , we present the experimental predictions for the generalized form factor of the proton . sect . iv is devoted to the interpretation of the results of the experimental analysis .the following observations are then made in q . 3 . we start with the total effective lagrangian of the chiral - symmetry breaking in the chiral region given by @ xmath9 with @ xmath10 which is the current magnetic field , with a randomly generated particle @ xmath11 , and finally with particles @ xcite , @ xcite . since one of the main goals of the original paper was to show how the fundamental observables depend on electron masses , we add to @ xmath12 the explicit chiral - breaking term @ xmath13 given by @ xcite @ xmath14 . \ { { x : lsb } \ ] ] . the term , ( [ x : lsb ] ) has to be evaluated with respect to this symmetry . the total effective lagrangian is then given by @ xmath15 however , we could have made an alternative formulation in which the explicit chiral - symmetry - breaking term is expressed in the form of the electron mass , or @ xmath16 . we could not do this , because we did not have a suitable version of the effective lagrangian with anti - { ##sin the form of the abel - villars ' theorem , as expressed in terms of @ xcite . the group equation corresponding to the classical lagrangian is defined as @ xmath17 = s _ f [ x ] + s _ f [ y ] , \ { { { : energsol } \ ] ] with @ xmath18 = - \ , - \ , m _ 2 \ , \ mbox { sp } \ , \ ln ( x \ , \ ! \ , - [ \ ^ { \ pi _ 1 } ) , \ ] ] and @ xmath19 = \ int \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ , m _ { \ pi } ^ 2 \ , m _ { \ dagger } ^ 2 \ , \ mbox { tr } _ 2 \ , [ f ( x ) + \ ^ { \ pi } ( x ) - 1 ] \ , f ^ { 2 . \ ] ] and @ xmath20 with @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 being the values of the - delta function and the moments ( isospins ) , respectively . the real ( real ) part of the group equation is the -\ ] . to eliminate these parameters , we must choose new parameters . for the purpose of this , first we use the newton - villars invariant formula . as shown in @ xcite , we must eliminate not only the cubic coefficients contained in @ xmath23 $ ] but also the cubic and linear coefficients contained in the equation of motion given above . to get rid of all these additional parameters , we need at least two additional operations . the group action is then defined as @ xmath24 = s _ f ^ { reg } [ u ] + s _ f [ u ] , \ ] ] where @ xmath25 = s _ f [ u ] - \ sum _ { u = 1 } ^ i \ , s _ f \ , s _ f ^ { \ sum _ { } [ u ] . \ ] ] . @ xmath26 is derived from @ xmath27 $ ] with @ xmath11 replaced by the newton - villars invariant formula @ xmath28 . these parameters are chosen as follows . first , the cubic and linear coefficients contained in the equation of motion( again , the energy of the vacuum ( ##s ) is , however , zero if the following conditions satisfy the above two conditions : @ xmath29 ( we see that the formula which removes the second term [ @ xmath23 $ ] also agrees with the values of the above conditions . ) for solving the above equation for @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 , we obtain @ xmath32 which gives the values of @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 , and @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 are negative . for solving @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 , we obtain the equations @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 which lead to finding the exact value of the second order term in the effective vacuum lagrangian and obtaining the mathematical expression of the vacuum particle energy . to obtain the equation of state , we must first write down the mathematical expression for the effective vacuum energy . using the corresponding ansatz @ xmath37 for the vacuum particle energy , it is written in the form : @ xmath##38 = e _ p ^ { reg } [ f ( r ) ] + e _ { [ f ( r ) ] , \ ] ] where the electron ( particle ) part is given by @ xmath39 = - \ , m _ { \ pi } ^ 2 \ , m _ { \ pi } ^ 2 \ int 1 ^ [ [ \ , [ \ , f ( r ) - 1 ] , \ ] ] and the proton ( particle ) part is given by @ xmath40 = e _ { val } + e _ { [ p } ^ { reg } , \ label { p : estatic } \ ] ] with @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 being the two single - particle states , given by the values of the background vacuum hamiltonian for the background vacuum state : @ xmath43 with @ xmath44 , \ label { q : dirach } \ ] ] and @ xmath45 are the values of the vacuum hamiltonian given by ( [ q : dirach ] ) with @ xmath46 ( = @ xmath47 ) . the corresponding value @ xmath48, which is a positive steady - state energy resulting from the negative energy state under the influence of the zero vector field , also called the zero energy . the expression @ xmath49 $ ( [ 1 : regenerg ] ) is the sum over all the negative energy eigenstates of @ xmath50 , i . e . the negative energy density operator . the following equation of state is derived from the steady state of @ xmath51 $ ] with respect to the derivative of the wave function @ xmath52 : @ xmath53 \ nonumber \ \ & = & { \ \ } ^ 2 \ , \ , \ { - \ , - \ , [ s ( r ) \ sin f ( r ) - s ( r ) \ sin f ( r ) ] + m _ { \ pi } ^ 2 m _ { \ pi } ^ 2 \ , s ( r ) \ , \ } , \ , { \ } \ ] ] which yields @ xmath54 . @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 are the real and pseudoscalar # ##s associated by @ xmath57 with @ xmath58 and @xmath59 and @ xmath60 are the energy profiles associated with the system mass @ xmath28 and of the control system mass @ xmath11 . we also find that @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 . as before , the self - consistency momentum basis is obtained as follows with use of kahana and ripka , discretized momentum basis @ xcite , @ xcite . then , using the same ( but different ) momentum basis @ xmath52 , the fundamental problem of the quantum hamiltonian is solved . from the two eigenfunctions and their corresponding eigenenergies , we can obtain the new momentum and pseudoscalar basis @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 . with use of these @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 , etc . ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) can also be used to obtain the new energy basis @ xmath52 . the whole process above is repeated with this momentum basis @ xmath52 until the self - consistency is achieved . since the two part masses of the system are given by each of the part##on the ( gpds ) , it is necessary to start with the following formulation of the unpolarized gpds @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 in the cqsm . from the expressions of @ xcite , @ xcite , we obtain the quantities @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 respectively , the isoscalar and isovector quantities that correspond to the sum and the product of the quantities ##s @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 . the relations between these quantities and the two parton correlation ##s @ xmath71 and @ xmath72 are expressed quite easily in the so - called breit formula . they are given by @ xmath73 where @ xmath74 these two corresponding values of @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 can be obtained from the second derivative of @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 where tr " is the sum of r " , for @ xmath77 . similarly , in the cqsm , it is possible to obtain the right - hand side ( right ) of ( [ p : hetrace ] ) and ( [ q : het##trace ] ) . since the results are already published in the other papers @ xcite @ xcite , we need to repeat the process . so we rely instead on the standard mathematical description of the standard models for the observables in the cqsm . the leading order term corresponds to the mean field strength , which is independent of the local rotational motion @ xmath78 of the particle ##s . the next - to - leading order term takes account of the local contribution of the local particle ##s to the local motion of an independent variable , and so it is equal to @ xmath78 . it is true that the leading - order term corresponds to the isoscalar part of @ xmath79 and to the isovector part of @ xmath80 , but the isoscalar part of @ xmath79 and the isovector part of @ xmath80 are only of the next - to - leading order of @ xmath78 ( instead of @ xmath81 ) . the leading - order gpds are usually written as @ xmath82 . the term @ xmath83 is the sum of the terms ( the local##nce for high - energy ( h ) molecular orbitals in the strong magnetic field . on the other hand , the corresponding expressions for the isovector part of @ xmath84 and the isoscalar part of @ xmath85 , which are of the second - to - last kind , are a bit more complicated . they are expressed as partial sums of the spin - orbitals of @ xmath86 \ , e ^ { - } e _ { z ^ 0 } \ nonumber \ \ & \ , & \ hspace { \ tau } \ , \ \ langle n | \ tau ^ a | n \ rangle \ langle n | \ , \ tau ^ 0 \ , ( n + \ tau ^ a \ tau ^ 0 ) \ , e ^ { -

i ( z ^ 0 / 2 ) \ hat { p } _ 3 } | | \ rangle . \ end { 1 : gpdemiv } \ end { align } \ ] ] these are expressions for the unpolarized gpds , i . e .( [ q : gpdheis ] ) @ xmath88 ( [ q : gpdemiv ] ) , are the standard governing equations for our current study of the electromagnetic form factors of the particles in the cqsm . there are a number of generalized form factors , which are known as the @ xmath0 - 2 moments of gpds . for the current study , we restrict ourselves to the 1st and the 2nd moments , which respectively correspond to the generalized electromagnetic form factors of the channel and the so - called generalized form factors . we are especially interested in the 2nd moment , since they are known to provide important information about the energy dependence of the channel particle ' s angular momentum conservation : @ xcite , @ xcite . for the isospin case , the 1st and the 2nd moments of @ xmath89 define the sachs - electric and gravito - electric form factors as @ xmath90 and @ xmath91 on the other hand , the 1st and the 2nd moments of @ xmath92 also define the sachs - electric and gravito - electric form factors as @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 for the channel ,we shall see how we can define the various form factors based on the physical properties of the gpds , by defining @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 as follows . taking @ xmath97 and integrating over @ xmath98 into ( [ e : gpdheis ] ) , we have @ xmath99 ##8 this integration into ( [ e : ge10def ] ) , we have @ xmath100 it is easy to see that , in the generalized normal form of the spherical configuration , the expression for the factor @ xmath101 also decreases , so that @ xmath102 is equivalent to a simpler expression as follows : @ xmath103 apart from the factor @ xmath104 , this is all but the simplest expression for the isoscalar sachs - type form factor of the configuration in the cqsm @ xcite . a very simple expression is @ xmath96 , which is defined as the second term of @ xmath105 . taking ( [ e : heis ] ) into ( [ e : ge10def ] ) and carrying out the integration over @ xmat##h1 , we obtain @ xmath106 using the s - q expansion of @ xmath107 , this can be divided into @ xmath108 this can then be divided into two parts : @ xmath109 where @ xmath110 with @ xmath111 to go further , we first note that , by using the generalized spherical symmetry , @ xmath112 exists and when @ xmath113 , i . e . @ xmath114 which leads to the result : @ xmath115 to obtain @ xmath116 , we first note that @ xmath117 ^ { ( \ 0 ) } . \ ] ] therefore , the generalized spherical symmetry implies that @ xmath118 must be constant , and that the value of the above expression is then equal to @ xmath119 ^ { ( 0 ) } . \ ] ] this result is @ xmath120 ^ { ( 0 ) } \ , \ lambda _ { ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ $ $ } } ) . \ , { \ } \ ] ] due to the expression @ xmath121 we obtainusing that @ xmath122 term we obtain the third term @ xmath123 . } @ xmath124 ^ { ( \ lambda ) } \ \ sim \ -

type form factor of the} . alternatively , we can call @ xmath96 the gravitoelectric form factor of the molecule ( the spin part ) , since it is related to the nonforward ##ian ##d component of the spin component of the total energy density tensor . the other two form factors can be described in a similar way . the isovector combinations of the generalized magnetic form factors exist only at the next - to - leading order of @ xmath78 . they are given as @ xmath136 and @ xmath137 ^ { ( 0 ) } \ , { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ alpha $ } } ] ^ { ( 0 ) } \ , { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ alpha $ } } \ , | | [ \ rangle \ , \ } . \ , { \ } \ ] ] the isoscalar combinations of the generalized magnetic form factors can survive only at the next - to - leading order of @ xmath78 , so that they are known as the ##ts of the spin - 1 orbitals of the generalized magnetic group . @ xmath138 and @ xmath139we see that @ xmath140 also agrees with the theoretical value of the isoscalar sachs - type form factor of the electron in the cqsm @ xcite . on the other hand , @ xmath141 is also called the gravitomagnetic form factor of the electron ( in isoscalar form ) , which we can define in the qcsm based on the available theoretical results . finally , the leading - edge approximation to the isovector sum of the local magnetic form factor is given by @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 . useful to evaluate all the values of the magnetic form factor in the forward limit @ xmath5 . the expression of this relation is especially useful for evaluating some of our theoretical results , since it leads to the local ##mation sum above . we also consider the forward limit of @ xmath95 . from ( [ q : inthe10is ] ) , we get that @ xmath144 has the local ##ization factor , this leads to @ xmath145 . if we use the expression @ xmath146 the forward limit of ( [ q : inthe10is ] ) also givesto the # ##mation : @ xmath147 which means that the sum of the @ xmath69 - proton and @ xmath70 - proton energies for the proton is 1 . thus we get to the upper bound of @ xmath96 , which is @ xmath148 it is easy to see that , with time and space correction , the first term of the sum of the above expression corresponds to the second ( electron ) term of the proton energy , i . e . @ xmath149 . ( [ q : estatic ] ) . it is proved by @ xcite that , for the cqsm with finite electron mass , the following identity holds : @ xmath150 in the case of finite electron mass , which we are considering , this identity does not hold . however , we can see ( see below ) that @ xmath151 that is , the first part of the sum of terms of , . ( [ q : momsum ] ) , agrees with the second part of the proton energy ( electron mass ) . since the products of the electron and proton energies arethe total electron is @ xmath152 , we can get that @ xmath153 after addition of and . ( [ 1 : inthe20is ] ) , this result can also be written as @ xmath154 which means that the total space currently occupied by the ##s ( the @ xmath69 - and @ xmath70 - masses ) is just unity . this is the desired result , since the cqsm uses the electron alone ( assuming that the electron is in an infinite set of states ) , and that the total electron mass should be determined by the electromagnetic field alone . in the backward limit of @ xmath155 , we are not subject to the same sum rule , given by the two laws . in particular , we get @ xmath156 , leading to @ xmath157 which means that the sum of the @ xmath69 - mass and the @ xmath70 - mass values for the electron is just unity . on the other hand , the forward limit of @ xmath158 leads to the same nontrivial sum rule as @ xmath159 since thisthis , which is the interaction of z and ##s between the @ xmath69 - proton and the @ xmath70 - proton in the system , is not governed by any physical law , the exact value can be determined only indirectly . here we return to the calculation of the forward limit of the two # ##ity identities . thus , the forward limit of @ xmath140 gives @ xmath160 which is the exact value of the isoscalar magnetic moment of the proton in the cqsm @ xcite . on the other hand , the backward limit of @ xmath141 gives @ xmath161 it is only in @ xcite that the value of the above identity is not known , i . e . @ xmath162 after application of ( [ x : gm2nd ] ) , this identity can be simplified into a much simpler one : @ xmath163 \ , [ x . \ , { 0 } \ ] ] . the same angular - momentum identity applies to : @ xmath164 \ , [ x = d ^ { x + 1 } , \ ] ] the above identity implies that @ xmath165 whichnote that the nuclear spin is determined by the magnetic moment and . this is not a surprising result , because the cqsm is an arbitrary standard model which has no known nuclear spin . the second argument ( [ q : gm20ist0 ] ) gives yet another result . since the fact that @ xmath141 consists of two states , @ xmath166 q . ( [ q : gm20ist0 ] ) implies that @ xmath167 since it also follows that ( the second conservation law ) @ xmath168 it also follows that @ xmath169 which is interpreted as indicating the spin of the _ _ _ due to the known gravitomagnetic symmetry of the particle _ . thus , we get the upper expression of the isovector expression of the known magnetic form factor . from q .

[ ref : a1020is ] shows the predictions of the cqsm for @ xmath203 and @ xmath202 are independent of @ xmath183 , consistent with the open lattice prediction . as for @ xmath203 , the cqsm prediction and the lattice prediction predictions are also independent of @ xmath183 and consistent with the predictions of the black - hole model : @ xmath204 with high - spin . compared to @ xmath202 , one sees a slight difference between the predictions of the cqsm and of the lattice prediction . the lattice prediction is that @ xmath205 which means that the one @ xmath206 of the total electron momentum is carried by the magnetic fields , while the other is carried by the gauge fields . on the other hand , the cqsm prediction for the open lattice is @ xmath207 which means that the gauge fields carry the total electron momentum . this may also be a result of the open lattice prediction , which has no such gauge symmetry . note , however , that thethe angular momentum of @ xmath202 is a scale invariant quantity . the experimental scale corresponds to the energy scale of @ xmath208 @ xcite , so the cqsm value should be taken as that of the corresponding energy scale of @ xmath209 @ xcite . we shall then make a direct calculation , taking account of the scale dependence of the observables . and @ xmath210 are symbols of @ xmath183 , together with the corresponding physical parameters @ xcite , @ xcite . the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig .

[ fig : a1020iv ] , we consider the isovector properties of the quantum representations of @ xmath211 and @ xmath210 . the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig . [ fig : a1020is ] . , for @ xmath211 , both the cqsm and the experimental scale use the quantum mechanical representation of @ xmath212 with equal accuracy . similarly to @ xmath210 , one assumes that theprediction of the cqsm has several important effects on the atomic region . starting from a simple absolute value in the chiral limit ( @ xmath213 ) , it gradually increases as @ xmath183 increases , but as @ xmath183 also increases it tends to decrease , thus having a tendency to affect the lattice prediction for the larger atomic nuclei . ( similarly , to put aside the absolute value , a similar @ xmath183 effect is also seen in the chiral limit of the lattice prediction for the momentum fraction @ xmath214 shown in fig . 2 of @ xcite . however , the prediction @ xmath210 has a dependence of the values of the momentum fraction given by the @ xmath69 - nucleus and the @ xmath70 - nucleus . the empirical formula for this is @ xmath215 @ xcite . one assumes that the prediction of the cqsm in the chiral limit is also derived from this absolute value , although a precise calculation must take account of the scale factor of @ xmath216 . and @ xmath217 is part of @ xmath183 , together with the realthe predictions @ xcite , @ xcite . the values of the predictions are the same as in fig .

[ fig : b1020is ] . the cqsm predictions for @ xmath218 and @ xmath217 . the latter value is equal to the isoscalar value of the total total magnetic moment of @ xmath219 . ( we find that the empirical value is @ xmath220 . ) we find that this distribution is very similar to the distribution of the atomic nucleus . it appears that the cqsm of @ xmath221 due to chiral limit increases the decay rate . however , the increase is only very slightly in this case . in fact , if we carry out a calculation of the total isoscalar magnetic moment of the nucleus @ xmath222 , the cqsm using the chiral limit is @ xmath223 in comparison with the empirical value @ xmath224 . to our knowledge , the best predictions are made for this quantity by means of the lhpc or qc##dsf ##3 . the second part of fig . 2 shows the result for @ xmath217 , which is also called the isoscalar contribution of the spin - gravitomagnetic moment , or simply the _ total _ contribution to the _ total gravitomagnetic moment _ . as previously pointed out , the form of the cqsm for this result is such that : i . e . @ xmath169 the only interaction model that does this . it should be noted that the sum rule @ xmath225 used in the cqsm is actually a linear combination of the _ total sum rule _ and the _ total _ total sum rule _ , both of which are used in the same way here in the cqsm : @ xmath226 and @ xmath227 \ = \ \ langle ^ \ rangle ^ { c + d } \ = \ \ frac { 1 } { d } . \ ] ] in the example , the interaction model contributes to these sum rules , thus leading to more accurate results : @ xmath228 + [ b _ { 1 } ^ 2 ( d ) + |_ { align } ^ { ( align ) ] = \ , \ _ { align } \ ] ] which means that only the contribution of @ xmath217 and @ xmath229 is sufficient to count as @ xmath230 ( if we include only the contribution of more terms than the @ xmath69 - and @ xmath70 - terms , this has no place in our discussion here . in fact , to count them , we have had to replace the term @ xmath231 by @ xmath232 . ) the second nontrivial argument is that the net contribution of vector and vector contributions to the net gravitomagnetic moment of the lattice must be equal . an important question is whether the vector and vector contributions to the net gravitomagnetic moment exist , because they are not associated with vector fields . a perturbative analysis based on a very simple gauge theory indicates the result is @ xcite . on the other hand , a nonperturbative analysis in the context of the lattice model indicates that the net vector contribution to the net gravitom##agnetic mass , at or near zero , @ xmath233 @ xcite , @ xcite . ( to be more precise , we note that the value of the lhpc collaboration for @ xmath217 is slightly negative @ xcite , while that of the qcdsf collaboration is slightly positive @ xcite . ) this observation suggests the strong possibility that the electron and proton contributions to the observed gravitomagnetic moment of the universe may not exist . worthy of special mention here is an important statement made by teryaev many years ago , namely that the value of the contribution to the observed gravitomagnetic moment of the universe , observed in standard theory , is unlikely to be reduced in a nonperturbative standard theory to the result @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite . more importantly , if this actually happens , it leads to a very unexpected result , i . e . the vanishing of the angular momentum and the mass of @ xmath234 as predicted by teryaev @ xcite , @ xcite , @ xcite . a far reaching theoretical problem arising from this observation is also observed in ourwe show @ xcite . ( see also the table at the bottom of this article . ) and @ xmath235 the predictions of @ xmath183 , together with the corresponding corresponding terms @ xcite , @ xcite . the values of the terms are the same as in fig . [ fig : a1020is ] . , width = 604 , length = 264 ] finally , we show in fig . [ fig : b1020iv ] the predictions for the isovector combination , i . e . @ xmath236 and @ xmath235 . we note here that the term @ xmath236 is the isovector combination of the electron cloud magnetic moment @ xmath237 , the highest value of which is known to be @ xmath238 . one notices that this value is very sensitive to the variation of the electron mass calculated for @ xmath239 . this is only true if one considers the important variation of the electron mass in the isovector magnetic moment of the cloud . ( one should note that the value of the cqsm for @ xmath240 is a non ) empirical value .in the chiral limit . we note , however , that , in the limits of the cqsm , there is an important @ xmath241 correction ( the second order ) due to the number of isovector quantities ( the isovector magnetic moment of the molecule in question is the wave - particle coupling constant of the molecule @ xcite @ xcite . this second - to - last correction for @ xmath241 should also be taken into account in more detailed terms . ) illustrated in the second part of fig . [ 1 : b1020iv ] is the general expression for @ xmath235 , the value of which can be expressed as the sum of the total angular momentum produced by the @ xmath69 - particle and the @ xmath70 - particle , due to ' the angular momentum conservation in @ xcite . the cqsm makes rather little prediction for this quantity , in comparison to the theoretical predictions of these quantities . it seems that the nuclear spin theory explains this quantity only partially . if we assume that , the reason why the cqsm ( in the chiral limit ) makes a little prediction for this quantity is directly connected with the fact@ xmath1 consists of the reflection @ xmath242 , the second derivative of the isovector unpolarized spin - 1 gpd of the particle . to understand this , we must note that , in the fundamental physics section of the cqsm , @ xmath236 as well as @ xmath243 are defined as values of @ xmath244 and @ xmath245 and of @ xmath246 and @ xmath247 , respectively , of @ xmath248 although the values of the quantities can be calculated directly without reference to the distribution function , they can also be defined as @ xmath1 - spin values of the two gpds . @ xmath249 the distribution function @ xmath242 has already been defined in the cqsm in our original paper @ xcite . as stated above , the mean square contribution to this function has a sizably significant peak at @ xmath250 . since this significant peak due to the spin anti - spin state is not symmetric with respect to the reflection @ xmath251 , it only contributes to the reflection .@ xmath252 , whereas there is a rapid increase to the initial peak @ xmath253 . the initial initial peak of @ xmath242 and @ xmath250 can also be interpreted as the increase of the mass . we can be interpreted in two ways . first , we see how this value of @ xmath242 changes as the total mass is increased . start with @ xmath182 and @ xmath239 . , width = 340 , height = 264 ] instead of @ xmath254 . , width = 604 , height = 264 ] . in fig . [ fig : eiv _ pi0 ] and in fig . [ fig : eiv _ pi24 ] compare the cqsm values for @ xmath242 with the values of @ xmath183 . i . e . @ xmath255 , and @ xmath256 . one also finds that the value of the value of @ xmath250 , due to the constant x - value ##v , changes rapidly as @ xmath183 increases . this supports our interpretation of this phenomenon as the formation of a cloud . thethe other hand , one also finds that the size of the spin sea contribution , centered on @ xmath257 , rapidly decreases as @ xmath183 becomes larger . this result of @ xmath242 turns out to be a rather simple @ xmath183 combination of @ xmath253 and @ xmath252 . as a result of @ xmath183 , the electron sea contribution to @ xmath253 decreases rapidly , whereas the spin sea contribution to it increases rapidly , so that the net @ xmath253 is a decreasing function of @ xmath183 . on the other hand , due to the complex wave - like nature of the electron sea contribution to @ xmath258 with respect to @ xmath1 , it also contributes to @ xmath259 because of the effective temperature , while the spin sea contribution to @ xmath258 is an increasing function of @ xmath183 , thus leading to the conclusion that the net @ xmath259 is a decreasing function of @ xmath183 . as with @ xmath182 and @ xmath239. , width = 340 , height = 264 ] [ of @ xmath260 . , width = 604 , height = 264 ] we can give yet another clue to the above - mentioned interpretation of the effect of the anti - sea distribution . to do this , we can assume that the original unpolarized wave function @ xmath261 used in the analysis @ xmath262 also has a small peak in @ xmath250 corresponding to the original anti - sea distribution . as shown in fig . [ fig : fiv _ pi0 ] and in fig . [ fig : fiv _ pi24 ] , this peak is also a slowly increasing function of @ xmath183 , supporting our interpretation of it as the effect of molecular clouds . finally , we can do this . we point out that this anti - @ xmath1 distribution of @ xmath261 is exactly what is used for the experimental nmc analysis @ xcite . to do this , we assume that the decay @ xmath263 in the original @ xmath1 region should also be interpreted as the effect of clouds . to be sure , it follows that @ .##math264 the large and large values of @ xmath261 in the smaller @ xmath1 region evolved to @ xmath250 indicates that @ xmath265 is dominant , i . e . the dominance of the @ xmath7 - particle over the @ xmath8 - particle in the sea , which has been confirmed by the nmc measurement @ xcite . updated to @ xmath266 and @ xmath267 by comparison with the wang and nutev models [ the corresponding energy scales @ xcite , @ xcite . , mass = 340 , energy = 283 ] are in bold . [ 1 : dbdu ] . the predictions of the cqsm for @ xmath268 correspond to the corresponding energy scales according to the same measurement @ xcite . ( the same predictions above were made with @ xmath182 and @ xmath269 . ) the model follows exactly the same predictions of @ xmath268 , although the magnitude of the flavor change of the @ xmath1 regions appears to be much smaller . it is a widely accepted fact that this flavor change of the region ##r occurs .the model can also be described by the effects of proton cloud at infinity . @ xcite @ xcite . this paper presents our understanding of the interactions of the two s - type particles , @ xmath242 and @ xmath261 and the effects of proton cloud . . the @ xmath270 interactions of @ xmath271 , @ xmath272 , and @ xmath273 satisfy the cqsm with @ xmath182 . [ tabivb20 ] [ id = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , id = " ^ " , ] in this paper , we have described the generalized form factors of the model , which can be derived from near - field analysis of the two parton wave function , within the framework of the cqsm . a special emphasis is placed on the energy density dependence as well as the energy dependence of the generalized parameters , which we compare with the experimental results of the classical model of the lhpc and the qcdsf , carried out in the same time frame . @ xmath199 . the generalized form factors are the corresponding generalized form factors of thesuch masses are the proton and neutron form factors of the proton and the neutron . we have found that the cqsm with its chiral model has exactly the observed values of the observed electron form factors , but the lattice simulations of the above two groups show a tendency to ignore the physical properties of the atom . however , this may also be due to the fact that the above two lattice simulations were done with very large electron masses . we have also attempted to find out the fundamental electronic structure of the atom through the study of the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic form factors of the atom , by taking care of the observed energy levels as well as of the scale dependence of the spin equations . by taking care of the scale dependence by means of the spin ##or = at the nlo and the @ xmath274 level , the cqsm states , that @ xmath275 , that @ xmath276 , and @ xmath277 , which means that the electron orbital angular momentum contains some amount of the electron mass even at such a very low energy level . this isthe results of the lhpc and qcdsf models show that the total spin angular momentum of electrons is very small and inconsistent with this . it should be noted , however , that the prediction of the cqsm for the total spin angular momentum is also very different from the theoretical lattice prediction @ xmath278 at the full renormalization group . the evidence of this can also be traced back to the lhpc and qcdsf / 2 prediction for the electron mass , @ xmath279 = 0 . 5 , which supports not only the predictions of the cqsm but also the emc prediction . as was stated in our previous paper @ xcite , @ xmath279 is also a model that is very sensitive to the distribution of the electron mass , especially in the region close to the chiral plane . the recent lattice prediction results for the @ xmath270 - version of @ xmath279 are still speculative . worthy of special mention is the fact that , if we have the lattice prediction @ xmath280 , i . e , the prediction of the top spin corresponding to the total gravitomagnetic spinof the latter , which is predicted by properties of the lhpc and qcdsf _ ##s , we are now referring to a very strong relation , @ xmath281 and @ xmath282 , i . e . the sum of the energy and angular momentum distributions shared by the electrons and the proton . using these results , together with the corresponding theoretical predictions for the unpolarized and the spin - pdfs , we can make _ energy - based predictions _ for the electron and proton states of the same particle . for example , with the results of the mrst2004 fit @ xcite and the dns2005 fit @ xcite , we have @ xmath283 , @ xmath284 , and @ xmath285 / @ xmath275 . since @ xmath286 ( as well as @ xmath287 ) is a strictly linear function of the energy scale , and the energy scale of @ xmath279 is very strong , we can assume that the former is much more stable than the latter at the level of @ xmath288 where the higher energy states are likely to2 . the problem is a bit more complicated for the non - nonsinglet ( non isovector ) case , because @ xmath289 , and also because the cqsm and the lattice theory have very similar predictions for @ xmath271 . when compared with the corresponding predictions for @ xmath271 and @ xmath290 , the predictions of the cqsm turn out to be for @ xmath291 . we have shown that the relatively small enhancement of @ xmath246 observed in the cqsm is directly correlated with the small @ xmath1 enhancement of the le parton distribution @ xmath292 , which is characterized by the formation of pionic @ xmath293 clusters in @ xmath294 . ( we assume that the first enhancement of @ xmath292 is @ xmath246 . ) however , such an @ xmath1 - like distribution for @ xmath292 can not be predicted in the framework of lattice theory . however , the relatively small @ xmath1 enhancement of @ xmath295 as well as of @ xmath296 suggest that the predictions of the##ral changes in the crystal structure of dna , which has not been fully accounted for in the quantum field model at the experimental level . this project is funded in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research for ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , poland ( reg . no - 16540253 ) . we will begin the proof of the existence of ##mation dynamics of @ xcite , by taking into account a first step in the calculation of @ xmath297 . the starting point is the following formula for the total mass ( or the total electron mass ) : @ xmath298 \ - \ ( [ \ rightarrow m _ n ) \ + \ int _ 1 , \ ] ] with @ xmath299 \ = \ - \ , f _ \ pi ^ 2 \ , f _ \ pi ^ 3 \ , \ int \ , [ \ , m ( n ) - 1 ] \ , [ ^ { 1 . \ , { 1 : emeson } \ ] ] the total mass must be invariant with respect to the invariant component of the chiral ##ity @ xmath300 or equivalently the energy of @ xmath##52 , which leads to the fixed point theorem : @ xmath301 \ + \ \ delta e _ m \ = \ , . \ ] ] if we choose a particular ( dilatational ) type of chiral ##ity @ xmath302 for each @ xmath3 , we get @ xmath303 note that @ xmath304 \ = \ \ theta \ , ( [ x ^ k \ partial _ k , h ] - 1 \ gamma ^ 2 \ gamma ^ 1 \ partial _ k ) . \ begin { aligned } \ ] ] with the identity @ xmath305 ) \ = \ \ mbox { sp } ( [ \ , \ , ( x _ k - h + i \ varepsilon ) ] x ^ k \ partial _ k ) \ = \ \ , \ begin { aligned } \ ] ] we now have the identity : @ xmath306 = - \ , \ delta e _ m . \ end { align : keyid } \ ] ] now , by adding ( [ align : emeson ] ) \ with the identity , @ xmath307 we get @ xmath308 \ , taking advantage of thethe relation @ xmath309 we can write as @ xmath310 we can get the equivalent relation : @ xmath311 taking this relation into ( [ e : keyid ] ) , we get @ xmath312 as @ xmath313 if we get the direct sum ##mation . taking the eigenstates of the corresponding linear hamiltonian @ xmath50 , a similar set of equations , ( [ e : traceap ] ) can also be written as @ xmath314 which is the relation given in ( [ e : alfp ] ) . we find out that our solution has the form chiral ##ity , since @ xmath315 is @ xmath316 and since @ xmath317 has agreed with the relation given in ref . @ xcite .
