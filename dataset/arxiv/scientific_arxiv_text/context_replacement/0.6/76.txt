ten years later , @ xcite demonstrated that the absorption lines observed in the spectra of the qsos are related to the surrounding gas content of the galaxies . since that time , researchers have studied the processes associated with the absorption lines ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and have used qso observations of the rest - phase phase transitions to determine the nature of baryonic processes in the outer regions of galaxies , e . g . , collapse , expansion , and contraction @ xcite . these processes include ly @ xmath9 and others that probe hot , photoionized gas @ xcite , and and others that probe cooler , more dense gas @ xcite . however , while the high abundance of qsos provides excellent signal - to - noise , high - resolution datasets , they often obscure the lines themselves , and thus require follow - up efforts , especially for high mass galaxies . furthermore , qsos are too large in the sky to probe very distant galaxies with different sightlines . therefore , information on the outer region ( @ xmath10 ) and the distribution of the ##s must be considered ( e . g . , * ?? ? * ; * ? ? ? the @ xmath11 gas in particular has been studied extensively , as it is only visible at short wavelengths with temperature @ xmath12 and is a gas ( with temperature @ xmath13 ; * ? ? ? * ) with a narrow band of low gas - density ( @ xmath14 @ xmath15 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in spite of this , the physical properties of the gas giving rise to these spectra vary . some ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ) suggest an infall model for this gas ; for example , @ xcite propose an infall model with which they model the observed mass distribution curves for galaxies as well as their interactions with @ xcite . other researchers @ xcite suggest instead that these properties result from gas which has been sucked out of star - forming galaxies via superwinds . in support of this latter hypothesis , a recent study at @ xcite of changes in coadded deep2 images of a group of star - forming galaxies in @ xmath16 revealed large , possibly even massive , amounts of this gas . @ xcite can be very high .gas from @ xmath17 super - starburst is carried by winds . these winds then transport the gas , leading to a new halo ##n , although the extent to which the gas may is unknown . in one of the first studies of this problem , @ xcite detected the infrared spectrum several kiloparsecs from the center of a group of @ xmath18 ultraluminous spiral galaxies . in addition , infrared spectroscopy can directly study the halo ##s of individual galaxies along the sightline ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this imaging technique has several advantages for qso - based cluster ##ing ( cf . koo et al . 2009 , in detail ) . the average mass distribution of galaxies in the cluster is much larger than that of qsos ; increasing the number of galaxies can greatly increase the number of available galaxy sources for a single galaxy cluster . additionally , many galaxies have infrared spectra which offer the ability to study galaxies along all lines of sight of a single individual galaxy , including their halo ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? ) imaging unit ( ifu ) images can also be used to study the haloof gas , and the spatial distribution of that gas . close transverse pairs of galaxies can be observed by both infrared and optical surveys so that a systematic search for gas present in the background galactic system can be performed . this technique has been used at @ xmath19 to detect absorbing regions caused by transitions such as the lyman line at at @ xcite ; however it has not yet been used at great distances where high resolution imaging and spectroscopy can be performed for this galaxy . in the course of carrying out a large survey to study the ##s of galaxies at @ xmath20 , we find a close transverse pair of galaxies in which the spectrum of the more distant galaxy ( @ xmath2 ) allows the detection ( and identification ) of gas in the environs of a distant galaxy ( at @ xmath0 and the other at @ xmath21 kpc ) . this gas also shows signs of strong stellar activity , has a chemical composition consistent with that of a non - starburst galaxy , and is similar to a low - mass agn . here we use the spectra of the distant galaxy to determine the gas in the surrounding region . we expand our understanding ofthe physical description and coordinates are in [ sec . thepair ] . analysis of the halo gas of the galaxy and the background dark gas is given in [ sec . analysis ] . the possible sources of the dark background halo gas are discussed in [ sec . analysis ] , and we conclude in [ sec . analysis ] . we construct the @ xmath22 group with @ xmath23 , @ xmath24 , and @ xmath25 . where it is not already known , we construct @ xmath26 . physical and coordinates in the table ##d . our new galaxy group is located in the h - band system ( smithsonian institution infrared survey ; * ? ? ? * ) and has been observed with the hst ##2 , for objects in the infrared sector ( f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp , and @ xmath27 , @ xmath28 , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 ) . the objects observed by these surveys and surveys are described in the [ sec . photinfo ] . we obtained images of the galaxy with the high resolution infrared system ( lris ) at keck and @xcite [ 2008 - 09 - 31 ] . we combined the @ xmath31 grism blazed at 4000 on the blue side and the @ xmath31 seeing blazed at 7500 on the red side with the d560 dichroic . this combination produced an fwhm coverage difference between @ xmath6 and @ xmath32 and a coverage between @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 . two sets of data were obtained . we first used a slitmask to project an @ xmath35 slitlet into the center of the target galaxy cluster , and combined @ xmath36 seeing with fwhm @ xmath37 seeing . we then used an @ xmath38 - based longslit between the two and combined @ xmath39 seeing with @ xmath40 seeing ( see image [ image . im ] ) . the resolution was achieved using the xidl lowreduxxavier / lowredux / ] image processing pipeline . the pipeline includes line scan and counter - scan , source detection , source correction , source filtering , bias correction , gamma ray correction , and aperture correction . radial and angular resolutions are2 . because the distance between the two is about 0 . 5 , we use a very narrow weighted window for the background galaxy to measure the spectral lines ( with @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 for the blue and red wavelengths , respectively ) . this allows measurement of the observed distance of lines from the background galaxy to @ xmath43 . using a narrow weighted window ( @ xmath44 ) does not improve the maximum resolution ( resolution ) of the spectra ( e . g . , h9 , ) measured for the background galaxy , but it does significantly improve the accuracy of our fine structure calculations ( shown in [ e . fg ] ) . we derived estimates for the two galaxies using idl codes developed for use in the deep2 project ( cf . wang et al . 2009 , in press ; * ? ? ? * ) from the publicly available code developed for the sdss . ] in particular , this code estimates the maximum @ xmath45 resolution as a function of the difference between the observed spectrum and a linear combination of two template . one template is an observed spectral line , with resolution . for wavelengths with an observed resolution of @ xmath46 ,one is the coadded pair of pairs of absorption - line background galaxies @ xcite , and another is the x - system . the absorption line which contains the two absorption lines was not used to identify the pair . the galaxy pair has not been confirmed by analysis . we assume that the spectra of the background and background galaxies are @ xmath47 and @ xmath48 , respectively . the errors are the @ @ xmath49 errors in the visible spectrum . these errors are the @ xmath50 of the spectrum measured by the first keck digital sky survey ( tkrs ; * ? ? ? * ) for these galaxies . we expect the radial velocity of the galaxy to be at the lowest possible value . both [ fig . im ] and [ fig . fullspec ] show hst images of the galaxy pair and our lris image of the background galaxy , respectively . the absorption lines in the x - region of the background galaxy are marked as red and are offset to the right from us , indicating the presence of an object . emission due to , as well as emission from the absorption lines , is also red . the emission pattern in theand followed by the dark center of the background galaxy in question ; these features correspond with phase transitions in the background , and are probably due to the interaction with the @ xmath51 background galaxy . we determined width of absorption and emission lines by extending the spectrum to the continuum level . this width was determined via a rough fit to the regions of the galaxy of interest . we found different continuum levels for each region with widths between 1 and 12 . we used the pattern - matching techniques used with @ xcite to find and measure the maximum width of the emission and absorption lines with @ xmath52 ( see [ maximum . width ] ) . the active open cluster / halo galaxy has an absorption value @ xmath53 and is classified as " ultrastrong " with @ xcite . @ xmath54 . this range is limited in terms of variation in qso sightlines ; e . g . , galaxies with @ xmath55 make up only 1 % of the mass of halo galaxies with @ xmath56 @ xcite . although the number of active halo - qso galaxy pairs with absorption values greater than @ xmath57 is very large , only one of these ( @xmath55 . ( we are not using the halo - ray data from the sample of @ xcite data , because they lack any evidence of the existence of the central halo . ) this galaxy also contains @ xmath58 and is described as " the " ( @ xmath59 ) of @ xcite . the @ xmath60 of this halo / ray pair is among the wavelengths used for the galaxy in the @ xcite data . we have no evidence of it ( e . g . , [ ] @ xmath61 ) due to this light exceeding the wavelength of the halo observed in either the slitmask or the longslit image . however , the background galaxies used in the hst study are much smaller and located at lower spectral depths than the previously identified background galaxies . we know that the background galaxy is consistent with this galaxy and in @ xmath62 from the sample of the background data , where the distance was calculated from a statistical analysis of the @ xmath29 - based sample by j . lotz ( 2008 , data collection ) , using the data used in @ xcite . the background galaxy is one of the few galaxieswhen the @ xmath27 - band reaches the tkrs @ xcite reaches its maximum and is among the stars " in the red zone " in the stellar absolute - magnitude distribution ( cmd ) , as shown on the right side of the [ ref . cmd ] . we calculate the star formation rate ( sfr ) of @ xmath63 from the spectrum of the h @ xmath64 line emitted by @ xcite and then the @ xcite spectral line curve with a h - band of h @ xmath65 is obtained from the stellar stellar dynamics section above . we use effects of gravity to calculate the h @ xmath9 line and use the spectrum of @ xcite to convert this to sfr . @ xcite has an oxygen abundance of @ xmath66 , corresponding to the expected abundance ratio of 0 . 5 . our lris star has a weak [ ] @ xmath67 spectral line , which indicates the star is close to the agn ( e . g . , * ? ? ? agn and may well exceed the sfr ) and the strength of the oxygen abundance . because the [ ] line is weak ,a linear fit to the line profile results in a rest - time value of @ xmath68 ; this value is independent @ xmath69 of the instrumental velocity values at this point . ( the instrumental velocity values above are obtained by making a linear least - squares fit of the data to the observed spectral line and the observed continuum and taking the instrumental velocity value from the initial value @ xmath70 in quadrature . these points are assumed to be at distance r from the continuum . ) we also observe an interaction that results in a p - cygni line - profile ( see [ 2 . fullspec ] ) , as well as a number of emission features from the emission line which we interpret as fine - structure transitions from the origin of . to our knowledge , this is the only known example of _ _ _ fine - structure transitions from an observed object . these emission features may be due to agn emission , or they could be due to some other physical process . their significance will be discussed in a later article . to determine the contribution of the agn to the observed emission , we use @ xcite ##r - wave analysis to generate a number of .starburst galaxy spectra . these spectra represent an extensive stellar population , including a 10 gyr - old single - lined stellar population ( ssp7 ) with low metallicity , and the stellar population of a 10 myr - old young galaxy with high star formation rate . these two sets of young and old stellar populations are used by @ xcite , who use them to model pre - starburst galaxies via stellar population models . to each of these models , we add a large power - law continuum with a high minimum to explain the agn contribution to the emission spectrum . we also account for a small amount of infrared emission , parametrized in @ xmath71 . ( details of the model are available in [ j . fg ] and j . rubin et al . 2009 , under review . ) the model will fit well to models with a minimum in @ xmath72 that model a young starburst with a power - law continuum that contains less than 1 % of the population at 4200 in the reference frame . we conclude that the best fit is consistent with a galaxy population that is dominated by stellar star formation , rather than agn emission . because of the low surface brightness and a strong blueward of the galactic@ xmath73 , this spectrum is an excellent and reliable source for the gas in galactic halo . at the same time , the spectrum can be used to detect the gas ( via gas - phase spectroscopy ) associated with the inner halo and its ##s proximity to other nearby star - forming galaxies . as mentioned above ( see [ www . thepair ] ) , the spectrum of tkrs4389 provides evidence for the strong presence of hot gas . a detailed study of the physical parameters ( e . g . , mass , @ xmath10 , effect on the gas , velocity , and mass loss rate ) of a large number of galaxies like this one will be conducted by dr . rubin et al . ( 2009 , in press ) . 1 . @ xmath74 for tkrs along with @ xmath75 ( left - hand panel ) and @ xmath76 ( right - hand panel ) . background ( tkrs4389 ) and background ( tkrs4259 ) galaxies are shown with a solid circle and square , respectively . the black square is the red sequence " from the black sequence " as shown in @ xcite . the red line isin the so - called " halo " and to correspond to the other stars of the main sequence ( e . g . , * ? ? ? [ sec . cmd ] , n = 172 ] and @ xmath77 ; * ) . the peak absorption lines in the data are marked with the dotted lines . these lines and the central part of balmer absorption lines in the model spectra are masked out prior to alignment ( these lines are shown in red ) , so the model spectra do not show the lines from agn - co . these lines are also masked out . alignment with 600myr @ xmath78 ##1 . 4gyr will show the peak balmer , g and h absorption lines in the [ . [ sec . specmodel ] ] kpc . the radial velocity is marked with the dotted line . the dotted line indicates the continuum level . the maximum amount of @ xmath4 emission due to the galactic halo is @ xmath5 . we note that these absorption lines are located at the central part of the spectrum . the lines are slightly distorted ( see [ * . psb _ 1 ] ) and have energies of @ xmath79 % of the continuum level . this is one ofsee @ xmath10 for the case of @ xmath80 . [ ref . fgspecstamps ] ] the existence of this galaxy also allows us to determine the physical properties of the background galaxy using the distance estimate of @ xmath3 kpc . to put these properties in perspective , we will need an analysis of the inner halo of the background galaxy . tkrs4259 is a young ( @ xmath8 , where @ xmath81 is the mass number ; @ xcite ) , relatively young galaxy , in " the transition zone " between the red sequence and the blue sequence in the @ xmath82 region . @ xmath74 cmd ( figure [ fig . cmd ] ; * ? ? ? although the gini / m20 analysis ( j . lotz , 2008 , data collection ) indicates tkrs4259 is an s - type galaxy , it shows signs of a peculiar ##ity and # ##iness in some of the hst / im images ( i . e . , a low - mass halo galaxy ; figure [ fig . im ] ) . both its appearance in the cmd and its shape in the galaxy may be derived from a very well -possibly due to a strongly interacting star . tkrs measurements of mass @ xmath74 and those of the solar system abundance are similar @ xcite . the [ ] , @ xmath83 , and [ ] emission - line spectra for this galaxy were detected by @ xcite and are listed in table [ tab . photinfo ] . we also compare the [ ] @ xmath67 spectrum with emission - line emission from @ xmath84 ( see table [ tab . ref ] ) , indicating this galaxy has an agn . in making the sfr analysis on the @ xmath83 and [ ] spectra , we consider the possible agn due to this emission - line emission . the observed ratio is [ ] @ xmath85 ; the ratio is well below the [ ] @ xmath86 , putting adams ( at lower values ) and seyferts ( at higher values ) into the range of spectral ratios used here , e . g . , @ xcite , @ xcite and @ xcite . however , we do not have the ratios of [ ] and @ xmath87 and do notwe use this region as a liner . however , because [ ] / h @ xmath9 is correlated with metallicity in star - forming galaxies , and because there is a strong correlation between brightness and metallicity in these galaxies ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ) , we can use @ xmath81 as a proxy for [ ] / h @ xmath9 . this is illustrated by table 1 of @ xcite , which shows the relationship between the @ xmath88 - type color and the [ ] / h @ xmath9 and [ ] / h @ xmath64 in the liner ##s . our own galaxy is far from the majority of star - forming galaxies in [ ] / h @ xmath64 - @ xmath81 region , with the @ xmath89 ratio higher than other galaxies with similar [ ] / h @ xmath64 ratios in the tkrs . this also meets the agn requirements of above . yan et al . ( 2009 , in chinese ) , we find that @ xmath82 region may serve as a proxy for [ ] / h @ xmath9 as well . we find that [ the agnthis is the very broad limit . in particular , @ xcite has an x - ray emission of @ xmath90 for this object . this emission is strong enough to be explained by star formation ; however , based on our measurements of the emission spectrum , we attribute the x - ray emission to ongoing agn formation . we do not , however , rule out future star formation based on this emission spectrum . the upper limit of the sfr is that @ xmath83 emission is due to star formation ( and therefore the distance @ xmath71 from the distance measured from stellar mass density , @ xmath91 , as described above ) , is @ xmath92 . we have a velocity spectrum of @ xmath93 for this object , and conclude that a line of this type cannot originate from an agn , because the emission from agn has been found to have roughly the same velocity spectrum as the emission of the agn region of @ xcite . in order to accurately estimate the rate of current and future star formation , we use the starburst model as described in [ 2 . bg ] . as such , our measurements use [ 1 . 5 .##yr - old burst - burst stellar population ( ssp7 ) of stars @ xmath94 with solar metallicity ( @ xmath95 ) and # # myr - old burst with solar sfr which has solar mass solar mass @ xmath96 . we create a new population of stars with supersolar metallicity ( @ xmath97 ) . the spectrum of the population is parametrized in @ xmath98 , where @ xmath99 ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ) . we create spectra with @ xmath100 and compare them to the lris spectrum of the spiral galaxy * 5620 @ xmath101 7550 ( see figure [ 2 . specmodel ] ) . we do not find the portion of the spectrum blueward of this range , because it is on the dark side of the d560 dichroic , and because it lacks the energy necessary for rapid star formation events . the portion redward of this range is very dark and is due to radiation pressure . for this region , we find the best - fit region of @ xmath102 , with the light side parametrized in @ xcite, and using the @ xmath45 minimization . the data do not show uv or agn spectral lines , so the lines in the data are resolved well prior to analysis . we find that the solar and non - solar metallicity * ##es do not exactly match the values of the balmer lines and the f and * ##n lines in the spectrum . the addition of a gravitational power - law ( qso ) model ( @ xmath103 with @ xmath104 ; * ? ? ? * ) does not improve the resolution significantly . these results suggest that there is still ongoing star formation in this galaxy . a possible rapidly expanding universe is ruled out by the model as well . we will continue to explore possible star formation histories . one possible star formation history that presents itself , based on the position of the galaxy in the cmd as well as its age , is one in which the galaxy expanded rapidly for several million years and then experienced a period of star formation , which has since ceased . we then create a series of stellar metallicity models , starting with the ssp which occurred 1 gyr ago . a model with an sfr of 1 myr was added to the model at the time @ xmath105 ,where @ xmath105 is between 1 . 5 gyr ##s and 1 myr ago . as shown above , this definition of mean value reflects the lack of use for models which provide a better fit to the data . we use only @ xmath106 . we allow for the use of a qso power - law component , as shown above . we calculate the best - fit values of @ xmath71 and the fraction of light contributed by the power - law component by using @ xmath45 for each model in our table . we do a detailed analysis of the parameters of each model , and find that models with high @ xmath105 values and low values of @ xmath98 are most effective when adding the maximum balmer gap and e and f field - strengths to the data . the best - fit model has a high value of @ xmath98 ( @ xmath107 ; other models give better fit ) and a 1 gyr - long component ; this value is shown in the [ ref . specmodel ] . the best - fit values of @ xmath108 , and the fraction of the total light contributed by the power - law component is 4200 .the mid - point is @ xmath109 . models with @ xmath110 , with @ xmath111 and @ xmath112 , and with @ xmath113 do not exactly match the balmer , wolf and l ##n # ##s and therefore yield poor fits . models with @ xmath114 yield good fits if @ xmath98 is large enough for these models , with the range of fits @ xmath71 being between 1 and 1 . 5 . we conclude that the starburst is in the region between 1 . 4gyr and 600myr ##☉ . the results are valid for @ xmath97 ##1 . + in addition , we conclude that the new galaxy is close to a high mass agn and has a disk shape consistent with that of the pre - starburst galaxy . it has an elliptical shape and is located in the " ring " of the cmd . we conclude that the shape of this galaxy in the @ xmath115 model is in fact consistent with that of the merger at @ xmath116 and the subsequent merger @ xcite . these results can be explained by a model in which the galaxythus , a collision which produces a starburst . the starburst has stopped , probably because the surrounding gas stream was exhausted and exhausted . in this case , the galaxy will return to the white dwarf . + in our study of the second galaxy ( tkrs4389 ) which is within the orbital zone of @ xmath117 , we find , , , and emission from lines associated with the emission line . a comparison of these lines is shown in figure [ ref . fgspecstamps ] with values corresponding to the radial velocity of tkrs4259 . the same comparison was made with the slitlet associated with the emission line in figure [ fig . im ] ; however , the spectrum associated with the longslit ( associated with the lines in figure [ fig . im ] ) shows different emission line lines with different sizes and shapes than those above . the resulting @ xmath4 spectrum is thus : @ xmath53 . the optical strength of the lines in the spectrum have a ratio 2 : 1 , and as the optical strength of the lines increases and they disappear , the absorption ratio of the lines increases from 2 : 1 to 3 : 1 . thethe ratio of the lines in our spectrum is @ xmath118 , indicating a high degree of coupling . in the case of heavily saturated lines , the @ xmath54 ratio is indicative of weak coupling , i . e . , a differential velocity value of @ xmath119 @ xcite . with such a high impact parameter , it is possible that our line of sight passes through holes in the outer layers of the galaxy . however , even if the line is edge - on ( it is circular ) , the average differential velocity of the line with this impact parameter would be of the order of few tens of @ xmath120 . we assume that the gas phase is dominated by non - linear lines and that the source of gas is extraplanar , i . e . , the gas in the vicinity of tkrs4259 . because the lines are heavily saturated , the depth of the line depends mainly on the wavelength of the particular gas source that is illuminated by the line ( @ xmath10 ) and the slit used . the deepest portions of the line obtained from the spectra , with slits at _ different _ depths are @ xmath79 % of the average depth , which is the most -@ xmath121 . the very low - flux of the light , and the dark parts of the images may in fact be at much higher - flux values when viewed at higher resolutions . this observation of @ xmath10 is particularly interesting given the large beam size provided by the background source : the distance between the two focal points in this region is @ xmath122 kpc and @ xmath0 . this would imply that the absorbing cloud itself almost completely covers the background gas and has a high velocity component at all the points involved . this is consistent with the results from @ xcite , which showed the formation of the clouds at @ xmath123 kpc ##s . we leave the explanation of the effect of such a large beam size on the background gas to a later study ( although see @ xcite for an explanation of the effect of grb vs . qso beam size on the later studies ) . here we present two different models for the formation of the clouds in the background source images . in the cloud complex model provided by @ xcite and @ xcite , @ xmath124 clouds form out of the background gas in the background as it expands . the clouddensity of these stars is half that of the galaxy itself ; we can then estimate the radial velocity dispersion in - space directly from the halo mass for the galaxy . using the relation between halo mass and the density given in @ xcite via the " exponential " method , we estimate that the halo mass ( @ xmath125 ) of the target galaxy is @ xmath126 for @ xmath127 . using the relation between @ xmath125 and the virial mass given in @ xcite and using a # ##ity model for the stellar temperature profile , we estimate that the mean fwhm of the line - of - sight temperature profile for a gas in a galaxy this size is @ xmath128 . this process could then yield an @ xmath129 @ xcite , consistent with the formula @ xmath54 for this galaxy . the thermal expansion analysis of the hot corona in galaxies measured by @ xcite shows that in the case of an active galaxy more massive than that of the milky way ( @ xmath130 ; * ? ? ? * ) , the highly dense , hot corona is subject to thermal expansion and therefore does notcollapse into gas halo . however , this model does not account for the amount of gas ejected from the galaxy ; nor does the existence of a very large gas disk necessarily hold in this case , given that our own galaxy is a hot zone . the two - dimensional numerical simulations of @ xcite show that , in conditions " beyond the horizon " , ( @ xmath131 ) , in which dense , virialized clouds form via shock - waves during gas exchange , cold flows of gas from the neutral medium ( halo ) can penetrate deep into the gas disk . at critical mass ( @ xmath132 ) , these cold flows envelope the central star and cause star formation . in @ xmath133 , in the case of the @ xmath134 star , the clouds expand to about half the virial mass , and then collapse into dense , dark clouds via gravity , tidal effects , and other mechanisms . when these clouds are virialized within the halo , they can form a strong gas halo and form a new @ xmath135 , as described above . however , we do not expect cold flows from thehow to determine the most likely composition of the young halo gas we need . first , our measurements of @ xmath136 @ xmath4 halo gas and @ xmath137 # ##r emission in this system ( as reported in [ sec . thepair ] ; in the table [ sec . fgspecstamps ] and in [ fig . 2 ] ) , show that the halo gas is rich with metals and minerals . we do not measure the metallicity and metal content of this system directly , because we lack the required spectral data . second , young star systems with the composition of @ xmath138 have been found to have low - qsos @ xcite ; however , the rate of enrichment increases with @ xmath135 . @ xcite shows that for stars with @ xmath139 and @ xmath51 , the same time - as @ xmath140 ( using their values above ) . they also find that stars with @ xmath56 have an average dust - to - metal ratio similar to those found in the milky way galaxy . different values for the average dust - to - metal ratio of young stars have been obtained .@ xcite , we also find that dust content increases with the @ xmath60 ( * * * ? ? ? as mentioned above , the dust we see has an @ xmath60 component as well as the gas component in these systems . these results suggest that there may be a large amount of dust in this system . however , we could not see the gas clouds because of our limited spatial resolution ( @ xmath141 ) ; however , we see that the absorption line profiles of them [ 2 . fgspecstamps ] show up . @ xcite shows that the gas clouds , and that the dust content is related to the dark matter content of the surrounding gas clouds tend to have an absorption line profile , although this depends on the number of individual stars in the system and the observed sightline ) . both the relatively high dust content of the absorption lines and the line profiles also provide an alternative explanation for the observed excited states . we also consider whether the @ x ##s could have been originated in the core of the host galaxy or other galaxies which had formed during a late starburst , outburst or early agn phase . if this galaxy was @ xmath137 gyr .( as is expected ; see [ ref . psb _ 1 ] ) , the gas would have had to reach speeds of 1 @ xmath142 to reach a maximum velocity of @ xmath3 kpc ##s , where @ xmath143 is the angle between the plane of the cloud and the direction traveled by the cloud . gas clouds can reach speeds in excess of @ xmath144 in starburst galaxies @ xcite and have also been observed in sub - starburst galaxies with high velocity @ xcite . the gas which has been tidally stripped from the source region of this extinction event can also give rise to new gas clouds with large @ xmath54 , provided that the velocity spread of the resulting gas is large enough @ xcite . the magellanic cloud , for example , has a velocity spread of @ xmath145 @ xcite , and thus could not match the size @ xmath54 of the distribution of gas clouds . however , the formation of gas clouds from comet tails could also produce enriched gas spectrum ##s . we know that an object which is compressed and pulled out of the surrounding sub -hot regions during the previous starburst , outburst or agn activity are a possible source for this gas . if in fact the gas originated from a hot gas or a star as stated in [ cf . above ] , our finding that the galaxy experienced a starburst @ xmath137 gyr , is not a coincidence , and is not directly related to the observed hot gas . we conclude that it is unlikely that there is ongoing activity of stars , since there is no recent star formation activity in the galaxy , and the observed agn activity is low . however , in this case , if the hot gas was ejected or stripped , it is likely to have remained hot for about 1 gyr , i . e . , since the starburst occurred . the analysis of @ xcite showed that the _ hot _ gas could not have traveled through time , although again , the assumptions made in that study did not apply in this case . hot gas being ejected or stripped from the ism and passing through the cold region may be due to the einstein - helmholtz effect . @ xcite showed that thermal radiation from the surface of the cloud does not completely cool the gas unless its crossing time is longer than the actual crossing time. . @ xcite , we find an open cluster with mass @ xmath146 and with a radius of @ xmath147 , where @ xmath148 is the cosmic ray velocity @ xcite , and @ xmath149 is the halo expansion rate of the cluster ( equal to the virial radius in this case ; see @ xcite for details ) . we assume that the gas clouds are formed @ xmath150 and that they will go into thermal equilibrium with the surrounding neutral gas as soon as they enter the cluster . the sound crossing time for the cloud is given by the ratio of the gas pressure to the relative rotational rate ( @ xmath151 ) . to calculate the cooling time of the cloud , we use equation derived from @ xcite . we find that the sound crossing time exceeds the cooling time by at least an order of magnitude for clouds with mass @ xmath152 equal to the maximum virial radius ( @ xmath153 kpc ) . we conclude that these clouds will be stable against the maxwell - einstein instability . we also assume that the gases at the upper end of this temperature range are replaced by water at timescales of @xmath154 gyr , where the orbital timescale is given by # # ##c @ xcite . if we assume that the halo gas content does not change significantly with time , we can conclude that gas , released into the halo from the star during a starburst or merger event @ xmath137 gyr , should remain there indefinitely , and persist for at least one gyr afterwards . events during the same starburst , merger and other agn events may have been caused by a variety of mechanisms . the galaxy gas model proposed in ( * ? ? ? * and discussed below ) suggests that in the gas ages past , gas is driven to the center of the galaxy where they have formed , causing the starburst ##s and black hole formation and creating a new qso . gas from this , is also known to cause emissions from starburst ##s ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and could have contributed some of the energy needed to create the hot gas to that of @ xmath155 . observations of the galaxies @ xcite suggest that they can produce a gas - induced stellar wind ,thus forcing cool gas into the halo . in addition , material from the galaxy that was tidally locked during the merger event could have been left behind as large scale gas . thus , a large agn could have contributed to forcing cool gas into the galactic halo and to the process of star formation . in the @ xcite scenario , the phase in which the original halo material is stripped away and the qso is revealed is expected to occur within a few million myr of the merger itself . the phase in which the qso is revealed and the original material disappears and forms the post - starburst remnant region of @ xmath156 after the merger . our observations of the star formation rates , sizes , and shapes of this region fit well into this scenario . first , we assume that we have the physical evidence that the region is post - starburst ; the possibility of a second merger is only theoretical . we also consider whether gas ejected from the galaxy would cause a significant increase in diameter of @ xmath157 per gyr after the starburst event has occurred . to determine this , we use a mathematical model of the size of the ejected gas and the remnant material . to determine, we define @ xcite and note that the velocity ( @ xmath158 ) of the ejected gas as a function of distance from the starburst velocity ( @ xmath159 ) is given by @ xmath160 , where @ xmath161 is the total gas mass , @ xmath162 is the upper limit of the starburst velocity required to ejected a large amount of the ' s gas when it is sufficiently dense , and @ xmath163 is the escape velocity of the gas . this equation holds until the final velocity is reached , @ xmath164 . for @ xmath165 , @ xmath166 kpc and @ xmath167 , the gas is compressed to values of @ xmath168 kpc during a 1 myr - long starburst . the values are similar to the values of @ xmath169 as well as @ xmath170 ; however , @ xmath171 and @ xmath163 both have values such that the gas will not fall back onto the galaxy within 1 gyr . if @ xmath##166 kpc , values of @ xmath172 are doubled ; if @ xmath163 is doubled , the higher values of @ xmath173 are equal , and are large enough so that they remain in the atmosphere for the same amount of time . we therefore assume that the starburst stops abruptly , and that the forces from the cloud are therefore due only to the gravitational attraction of the cloud , and not the effect of the forces from the more dense ##r ##gb . then using the equations of motion for clouds with mass @ xmath174 kpc and with boundary conditions given by the above equation for @ xmath158 , we calculate the cloud distances and speeds of 1 gyr . a circular trajectory for the cloud with an opening angle of @ xmath175 is obtained , along with that of the opening angle of the vortex cones formed by mass @ xmath9 and the vortex of m82 ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , so that our line of sight crosses the vortex cones and is perpendicular to the wind passing through the center of the cones . we calculate the line - of -radial velocity for the clouds that formed at a given distance of @ xmath176 kpc between 1 and 2 gyr . the velocity distribution is well above @ xmath177 in all time scales . although this data is very limited , it suggests that clouds coming out of the cloud 1 gyr away will have the same velocity distribution that we observed , and that they will maintain this velocity distribution for at least another 2 gyr . from all of the observations described above , we conclude that the absorption spectrum is most likely primarily composed of the dust from the galactic halo we observed . this dust may have been carried by a wind caused by a starburst , jet , or agn , or tidally stripped from the original cloud . if all these clouds formed in the past , this is one of the first observations of the radial velocity of the clouds of tidally stripped dust in the early universe and indicates that it originated from outside the galactic halo . because the clouds we observed were all dusty ( see [ fig . 1 ] ) , this wind may be responsible for transporting the dusty material present in the clouds to spatial scales much larger than the size of thesee @ xcite . a new technique which has also been used to study the host stars of neutron stars measures the magnetic strength of a small number of systems with respect to that of nearby giant stars ( lrgs ) , to determine the mean halo mass at which systems of this magnitude are observed . these results have shown that there is a strong anticorrelation between @ xmath135 and the masses of systems with @ xmath179 . this has been interpreted as strong anticorrelation with the mean halo mass , even at the low @ xmath70 level ; i . e . , systems with 1 . 5 @ xmath180 1 . 5 have mean halo mass @ xmath181 , while @ xmath182 systems have mean halo mass @ xmath183 ( @ xcite ; see also @ xcite and @ xcite ) . the bias of @ xmath184 mass in these systems is very small ; therefore , the @ xmath185 we calculate for our own system , while larger than the mean halo mass of the system described above , is well beyond the uncertainties in the calculation of the mean halo mass for_ are _ large and strong . ( see # 7c , * ? ? ? ) explanation provided by @ xcite for the phenomenon of strong absorption is that the gas is drawn into the halos via starburst - like winds . these results suggest that galaxies are more likely to receive gas from galactic nuclei through their gas layers , and allow for strong absorption to be only found in low - mass halo . @ xcite suggests , however , that the mechanism of strong absorption is _ unbiased _ with respect to dark matter , and that strong absorption does not occur _ in lower mass . however , the same model provides an explanation of strong absorption which is most likely due to recent volcanic or volcanic eruptions in the low mass ( @ xmath186 ) halo . our model suggests that while these eruptions may be an important source of the dark matter , they should not necessarily be the main contributor to the low mass halo , and it _ should _ only occur _ in low mass halo if they fail to adequately explain the # ##es of @ xcite . an alternative explanation is provided by results of , e . g . , @ xcite and @ xcite , which provide support for thethe " halo " , in which cold gas can form ##haven when it is drawn onto the star is shown in [ fig . 1 ] . @ xcite shows that the anticorrelation between @ xmath125 and @ xmath135 , as well as the relative mass distribution of both , can be predicted by a stellar expansion model which assumes only a minimum mass , and that the more massive stars are far too cold to form a @ xmath54 . lower mass stars contain more cold gas and thus give rise to large @ xmath54 stars . as shown in @ xcite , cold gas can also pass through the cool regions of massive stars like @ xmath187 and other massive stars , which can then help in further star formation . since our galaxy is unique in that it is non - starburst , the presence of an _ _ _ @ xmath188 star in our galaxy with a mass called " the minimum mass " is consistent with this observation , and if the galaxy system is not a halo , so that ( 1 ) the effects of star formation on cold gas are not going into the transition regime in which cold gas accretion exceeds the cool gas accret##ion , and ( 2 ) there are a range of stellar models for forming hot halo . using multiwavelength observations of the luminous components of this galaxy at @ xmath0 in combination with analysis of the faint , diffuse emission line emission at @ xmath2 , we conclude that the halo , surrounded by dust and the central hot halo with the center @ xmath189 kpc , probably formed from the merger of the parent galaxy and its halo . this galaxy has no known star formation and shows only weak agn activity ; however , it experienced a starburst @ xmath137 gyr ##o , which may have been caused by a violent eruption . the hot halo ##s could have then been ejected and carried away from the star - forming regions during this most recent phase , and could have remained in the hot halo since that time . our new theoretical model for the formation of clouds drawn into the halo by a violent starburst suggests that these clouds would have very high radio emission @ xmath190 ##pc , consistent with our observations . we conclude that the study of the luminous components of this galaxy reveals an unprecedented level of confidence in the field of study of the g - type starswith @ xmath191 . this discovery was important because of the large dataset available as well , including the infrared images from tkrs @ xcite and our lris satellite . we were able to identify the post - starburst and galaxy - related sources from this dataset ; previous searches could not even find such a source , and thus provided a more detailed picture of the host galaxies of the survey . @ xcite searched for @ xmath87 and with @ xmath192 and with @ xmath133 to find a starburst source for them ; this data can then be used to identify other sources without @ xmath87 emission , such as post - starbursts with no agn emission . @ xcite identified all of @ xmath193 sources by studying the nearby qso galaxies ; however , they lacked any evidence of source - source interactions and have not studied the galaxy formation history of these galaxies . our survey also aims to demonstrate the ability of the host galaxies to identify host galaxy ##s . several other galaxy surveys have been completed or are nearing completion that can be used to identify galaxies or for a direct search for the2 . the detection with an instrument such as lris requires that the light will be bright and diffuse and that the high signal - to - noise ratio of @ xmath194 to @ xmath195 can be achieved in a very short time ( i . e . , @ xmath196 takes less than 10 seconds ) . this @ xmath197 is expected to have an @ xmath198 spectral power ratio of 0 . 5 for the case of @ xmath179 . there are @ xmath199 galaxy pairs with distances measured as part of the deep2 survey of the extended groth survey ( egs ) with similar results @ xmath200 @ xcite which satisfy these criteria . surveys such as kepler - 1 @ xcite and zcosmos @ xcite will identify galaxy pairs with distances on the same scale as deep2 , as will the proposed vimos vlt survey @ xcite . the [ surveyeisenste / survey / images . com ] @ xcite will collect all images within 1000 square degrees and should allow detection of over 1500 galaxy pairs . the pan - galactic survey , which will measure 1200 square degrees in theand to @ xmath201 , to provide an increased number of pair samples . using the high success rate and the average low success rate of the egs instrument of the deep2 and @ xcite to increase the number of pair samples to that expected from a single source , and to scale back the 2400 - fold increase in spectral resolution with pan - starr , we predict that @ xmath202 pair samples will be available for further analysis . the use of filters on imaging telescopes is similar to that of grb sightlines , which have a smaller sample size but still allow for detailed analysis of the galaxy of @ xcite . under good light conditions and with extended background galaxies , we can observe both sightlines in a single galactic nucleus . resolution measurements greater than @ xmath203 kpc and @ xmath204 are not currently possible because of hardware limitations . however , with adaptive optics and ifus on 10m - aperture telescopes and detectors , imaging extended background galaxies will allow analysis of the structure and composition of their nuclei in conjunction with detailed analysis of the physical properties of their halo . the authors propose to use r . tremonti forfor providing her stellar structure classification code , m . cooksey for providing her stellar structure -
