virtually all astronomical observations are made via gravitational waves . the production of accurate gravitational wave measurements over the next decade or so will also be a major challenge for astronomers . in addition , since the interaction of electrons and holes could occur at the quantum level , gravitational waves emitted by cosmologically - distant ` ` space - time sirens , ' ' such as two pairs of massive black holes , could be used as useful quantum tools of observation at large scales . black holes with mass @ xmath0 are located at the center of two interacting galaxies ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? ) the galaxies move in gravitational rays , their respective black holes interact , producing @ xmath1 bursts of dark energy in the form of gravitational waves ( @ gws ) . to measure the gws emitted by these cosmologically - distant space - time sirens , esa and nasa will develop the gravitational wave detection instrument , lisa . gws emitted by black hole sirens have the objective function of providing a direct measurement of the gravitational wave , @ xmath2 , to the black hole , without interference effects . due to the gravitationalcoherent measurements of gw sources @ xcite , the stress ( or strain ) , @ xmath3 , mass , @ xmath4 , and , , , @ xmath5 , of the leading edge ( quadrupolar ) gw inspiral sources are : @ xmath6 ^ { 5 / 3 } f ^ { 11 / 3 } } { z _ 1 } , \ \ \ m _ ( z ) & \ propto & \ left [ ( z + 1 ) m _ [ \ , ] ^ { 5 / 3 } f ^ { 11 / 3 } , \ dot { z } \ ] ] where @ xmath7 is the only possible gw sources , @ xmath8 is the black hole with ` ` spin ' ' , and @ xmath9 , mass . since the gw sources can be very well localized in the sample , the frequency range of the source frequency leads to coherent measurements of @ xmath3 , @ xmath4 , @ xmath5 and , @ xmath2 , mass . as shown in fig . [ 2 : 1 ] , lisa spin resonance method searches for the ` ` spin ' ' ofgw ##p in the sky , to measure a certain distance @ xmath10 deg @ xmath11 and @ xcite . this allows very accurate measurements , e . g . , with sources @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 typically @ xcite . distances are also measured to very high precision ( typically @ xmath14 ; e . g . , @ xcite ) = in addition , the available galaxy data that can determine the distance to the source , can be used to identify the host galaxy of a pair of merging black holes observed in lisa . the accurate identification of the host galaxy would enable a wide range of future galaxy black hole observations ( see [ ref : newbh ] ) . initially , the chances for identifying the host galaxy of a pair of merging black holes were thought to be slim , mainly because of the large number of possible sources . in the @ xmath10 deg @ xmath11 lisa is dust - free ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) however , recently , this idea has been advanced , with more accurate results @ xcite . using a computer , it is possible to perform the exact amount of observationsto the gw transform into a smooth image slice in which the host galaxy should be located @ xcite . the solutions to the statistical problems that arise in performing this analysis are given in ref . [ 1 : 1 ] , for a very low - mass galaxy , as a function of the gw and ms @ xcite . at ms @ xmath15 , where many black - star systems are expected to be located , gravitational lensing effects due to line - of - sight effects ( on top of the smooth ##er problem ) are the main obstacle to the accurate determination of the image slice in which the host galaxy ought to be located . @ xcite has discussed in detail the possibility that the three - dimensional images obtained ( see image + image ##s ) could be used to rule out a planet , or some other very large object ( such as a big - o ##er ) , from the lisa data table , after all . finding such a very significant object pre - merger would make it a good host galaxy candidate for the well - known population of black holes . = however , it is far more difficult to use the pre - merger strategy toidentify the host galaxy of a cluster of young black holes observed by lisa . thus , lisa could use the real - time gw ##p in the galactic clock , in conjunction with the precise timing of the inspiral signal , to determine just in time where in the galaxy the object is located . this possible host galaxy identification could then occur using similar techniques with other telescopes , thus searching near real time the surrounding sky for possible electromagnetic emissions , as the investigation progresses . a number of mechanisms exist by which dark matter in the form of black hole remnants can produce electromagnetic emissions during and after emission @ xcite . for example , at the time of emission , @ xmath16 pulses of electromagnetic radiation are applied to the nearby black hole remnant and its surroundings , for a peak velocity @ xmath17 m / s ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . this could lead to electromagnetic emission @ xcite and thus the possible discovery of a new host galaxy . the exact mechanism of these electromagnetic emissions is currently unknown , however . to a large extent , lisa has .to measure a long - period source , the receiver is exposed to the gw signal , generated as a result of the ' s rotation and change of phase when the source orbits around the star ( cf . [ fig : one ] ) . even though most of the gw snr occurs during the final stages of inspiral / emission for most gw sources , no accurate information about the source will be available well before the measurement since this information changes rapidly , over the entire distance measurement ( sm ) timescale . because of the cross - correlation between the position and distance measurements , it turns out that this model is not even valid for the measurement at @ xcite . the [ fig : one ] shows the pre - stellar orbital evolution of the source and the observed position components for a binary black hole orbiting at @ xmath18 . they decay rapidly at early times but their decay ##s decrease rapidly at later times . according to these models , even allowing for accurate measurements of various source and receiver components ( shown in best , worst and worst cases ) , much information is lost up to weeks prior to the first measurement @ xcite . the black hole observations in the past have been .to result in an improvement in the results during the last few minutes to hours prior to merger @ xcite . with the increasing availability , by the time lisa becomes operational , of very large field - of - view ( fov ) astronomical instruments for gravitational lensing and other applications , it is important to consider the period of time prior to merger during which the lisa sky area falls within the fov of such an instrument . when this occurs , continuous monitoring of the lisa sky area , until the merger , is possible . @ xcite has done a detailed analysis of this data , using lsst and the @ xmath19 deg @ xmath11 fov as a reference . the [ 1 : 1 ] gives results for all medium - sized sources , as a function of their relative brightness and size . the same results show that results for continuous monitoring up to weeks after the merger are available for observations using the @ xmath13 @ xmath20 . searching for the missing gw ##b compared to @ xmath21 - @ xmath22 may also be useful @ xcite . a significant amount of active and black hole observations would be enabled by the use of thehost galaxies of the black hole pairs . we have only a few examples , and refer the interested parties to @ xcite and @ xcite for more information . from the black hole masses , distances and orbital orbits , all carefully determined by the gw signal , we would be able to predict the effects of the post - collision ##al process onto the host black hole @ xcite with high accuracy . this would involve placing limits on the upper limit of the radio signal , its emission and absorption , and on its rotational velocity . also , observations of the galactic host galaxies inform us about the temperature ( dry / wet ) and the timing of the physical events that result in the black hole pairs forming . thus , measuring the variations , @ xmath23 , for the host galaxies , together with the black hole masses derived from the gw signal , would allow us to accurately predict the interaction of the @ xmath24 @ xmath23 pair with cosmic rays , at least for the distant galaxies of the hosts of the black hole pairs . a means of correctly predicting the host galaxies of the black hole pairs is the ability to construct a gravitational wave model , i . e . .that relates the optical spectral distances , @ xmath2 , of these gw galaxies to the optical distances , @ xmath9 , of their parent galaxies . one of the main advantages of a gravitational radiation diagram arises from its relation to the effects of gravitational radiation . theoretically , a gravitational radiation diagram , which is based on gravitational radiation measurements with well - known instruments , is not subject to any adverse effects from absorption , emission or emission of gws . in practice , however , the accuracy of such a diagram is limited by line - of - sight energy differences , which produce significant lensing effects in the corresponding @ xmath2 diagram ( see ) . [ 1 : 1 ] ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? although the lensing process can in theory be carried out at seemingly arbitrary line - of - sight , it may also be possible to do so for large numbers of massive black holes if lisa ##n collision rates are high ( e . g . , a few times per second , @ xmath25 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?* ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * lensing effects in lisa events correspond to large values ranging from @ xmath26 at @ xmath27 to @ xmath28 at @ xmath29 ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ) , which makes the lisa phase diagram useful even at high energies . the extent to which lisa data can be used to construct a galaxy phase diagram will likely depend both on the large number of known black hole burst events with lisa and the relative accuracy of the various measurements . as we see in [ lisa : wd ] , however , red dwarf bursts into massive black holes may provide a new opportunity for studying galaxies with lisa . the idea that the rapid expansion of the universe results from a theory of general relativity has motivated much theoretical work on large scale theories of gravity over the past few decades . since constructing a general theory of quantum quantum gravity is a difficult task , any advantage that could be derived from direct field measurements on the local gw signal may not be achieved . lisa , with its ability to determine the gw signal from cosmologically - related observations , may not be capable ofour model consists of model systems of large scale @ xcite . one would expect these models to have a large length scale , @ xmath30 , in which it differs from general relativity . in order to explain the very slow expansion of the universe , this scale is required to be of the size of the usual length scale , @ xmath31 . the first proof of gravity of this scale is provided by dgp - @ xcite , a braneworld model with an additional extra dimension . @ xcite suggests the possibility that extra - dimensional transfer of energy in dgp - gravity models can lead to cosmologically - observed gw regions appearing larger than they actually are , from the transfer of gw energy relative to the extra - dimensional region . however , in the case of higher energy levels , energy transfer in the frame - free hypersphere means that the gw energy varies with scale @ xmath32 from the same scale @ xmath33 where @ xmath34 is the maximum number of space - time dimensions available to these models . however , for @ xmath35 , it differs from the usual @ xmath36 scale . in physics , black - string theory and gravitythese observations could also show the effects of gravity over distances of only a few short moments , in contrast to other known astronomical objects , which are sensitive to strong gravitational fields . this is just one of many possible modified gravity signatures of the gws from cosmologically - related experiments @ xcite . this class of signatures is related to the gw radio signal , with many other signatures like the standard model quadrupolar ( @ xmath7 ) signature of general relativity ( e . g . , * ? ? ? . ) being observed in addition to the gw signal , which , in modified gravity signatures , may differ from the speed of light . in this case , the ability to measure the observed gw , similar to the astronomical measurement , associated with the black hole model , could provide additional signatures of large - scale modified gravity . this could show , for example , that the timing of the gw signal differs from general relativity predictions , when measured over large distances . @ xcite has explored all the possibilities of measuring particle and photon travel times from the same radio signal . a major problem with this approach is that there may be a complex and a prioriintrinsic delay in the emission of hydrogen , similar to the emission of electrons , since the binary would not be behind the perturbing gravitational event . this delay could be overcome if it were possible to measure the relative timing of the electromagnetic and gravitational event at the source . due to this , matter present in the near infrared of the black hole source would be strongly excited in such a way that it could produce a radio frequency signal with a frequency roughly resembling that of the first - order quadrupolar wave produced by the gravitational event ( see fig . [ 3 : 1 ] ) . this would help determine the gravitational component of the gw signals . in addition , it would be possible to compare the relative frequencies of the gravitational and gw signals . the difference in frequency between the two components of the two signals with different frequencies could be used to directly measure the intrinsic delay in the event at the source . both inspiral and extinction could be measured via the gw signal , so that the relative timing of the gravitational and electromagnetic signals can be considered to be a function of the total photon emission period . the difference in space - time with time between the gravitational and electromagnetic .##rping ##s , that the universe spends about a second at gw ##b during the last few years of inflation , could also be attributed to a fundamental difference in the way electrons and holes travel over different scales . for example , such a phenomenon could occur if the particle is accelerated , resulting in a time - dependent travel pattern ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this latter case is illustrated below in ref . [ 2 : 1 ] . ) , since gauge theory has been extensively studied for standard gauge theories , this phenomenon could be observed in the gravity sector , and at different scales ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . with a good theoretical understanding of the phenomenon , binary signals to black hole binary signals could perform experimental measurements of symmetry breaking in the gravity sector , via the ability to measure and compare the gravitational and quantum signals by frequency and amplitude . it would be possible , as the black hole binary moves toward a point , over a range of frequencies , to measure the difference between particle frequencies . particle frequencies , as a result of the motion of the particle##rping ##s . the energy released if lorentz violation is observed in the gravitational field could be measured directly for effects observed at smaller scales . to have the opportunity to perform such rigorous analysis of gravitational effects , we would need to understand the physical properties of these pairs of massive black hole objects as thoroughly as possible . this would be one of the main reasons for the need to detect these rare , unexpected events even before further analysis . as seen above , a large number of experiments could be used to develop the gravitational force field into a high quality tool for analysis . brown dwarfs rapidly evolving into ( potentially ) massive black holes could provide new opportunities in this area . an important goal of the lisa project is the detection of gws produced by small particles being absorbed by massive black holes ( the so - called extreme cases ##less inspirals , # emris ) . @ xcite performed a detailed ( ##ization study for this class of lisa events and found that they could be detected with an snr up to a distance @ xmath37 gpc . in addition , these experiments found that the measured brightness values for these events ( @ xmath38 ##a , @ xmath37gpc ) is related to the frequency of black hole - formation events . no electromagnetic emission is expected from emris of massive neutron stars or low - density black holes . on the other hand , partial ( or partial ) melting of inspiraling low - mass white dwarfs ( wds ) could predict such events and could help identify candidate stars for such events . to the best of our knowledge , the need to determine the physical properties of this type of lisa emris and use them for further measurements has not been extensively discussed in the literature . as a result of its relatively low mass , a typical wd undergoes partial destruction by a super - massive black hole of size @ xmath39 . this mass loss is equivalent to mass @ xmath40 if the black hole is rotating towards @ xcite . even if the wd is partially melting , some level of partial melting of the low density outer layers ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ) would be expected during the inspiral ##ing . if the mass of matter from a partially melted wd collapses against itself in the inspiraling wd ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ) , some level of electromagnetic emission during the emris is expected .a tidally - induced expansion of the wd is yet another possibility @ xcite . all these results point to the possibility that electromagnetic interactions may account for a subset of all the emris observed at lisa ( the region closest to wd inspirals ) . the fraction of the emris which are wds is , therefore , likely to be large @ xcite . if electromagnetic counterparts for a subset of the lisa emris could be found , the number would be enormous . much like black hole - based models , emris with their electromagnetic interactions and associated geometry could be used to construct a galactic phase diagram , with the added advantage that , at energies as low as @ xmath41 @ xmath42 , gravitational lensing due to line - of - sight effects would be absent or reduced ( cf . [ 1 : 1 ] ) and that the @ xmath2 @ xmath9 galaxy at these low energies is closely related to the galactic dark energy spectrum . dark energy is also dynamic , affecting the expansion rate and structure of the universe , and the @ xmath2 , and @ xmath43 ( see , e . g . * ? ? ?* for ( reference ) . if , as shown in @ xcite , the high - background measurements are measured at lisa , @ xmath2 will be measured directly from @ xmath44 , and the low background ( @ xmath45 ) measurements will be the best fit to the background background measurements . wd emris measurements with lisa also occur naturally , and they could easily be ruled out on the basis of the relatively large mass of the inspiraling background objects . it remains to be seen how the lisa - based approach corresponds with pre - collision ( or pre - collision ) observations for cosmic rays and what is the nature of their observed effects . at first , the many problems that we have encountered point to the need for a detailed study of the potential applications of wd emris for distance measurements with lisa . for decades , astronomers have measured distances independently with lisa . modern astronomical measurements , including gps , and models of the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational waves are two different ways to measure distances at different wavelengths . the problems inherent in accurate , background - independent electromagnetic and gravitational measurements will require that considerable effort be made to reach consensus among the gw and astronomical communities .
