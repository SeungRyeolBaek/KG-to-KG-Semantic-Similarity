the long - lived stars ( slri ) @ xmath4al remained active during the formation of the most stable phases of the solar wind , the al - , al - , phases ( cais ) , in the martian rocks . this suggests that at least some of the solar wind @ slris may have been injected into either the presolar disk ( e . g . , miller & keiser 2012 ; miller 2012 ) or the solar nebula ( ouellette et al . 2007 , 2010 ; dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) by a solar wind agb shock - wave . in either case , it occurred in a single disk that was widely dispersed , which would greatly increase the efficiency of @ xmath4al . a highly accurate model ( dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) for the determination of the initial stages of star formation ( macpherson et al . 2012 ; j . krot et al . ) and ( e . g . , boss 2011 , 2012 ) have shown how the total stellar carbon abundance can be significantly reduced under a large upper bound ( mgu ) model , as a resultof the large - scale inward and outward migration and diffusion of gas and liquid large enough to interact with the planet ( e . g . , wang et al . 2012 ) . of elements and their distribution in a relatively well - defined solar system ( e . g . , os : wang 2012 ; os : wang et al . 2013 ) . the remaining oxygen molecules , on the other hand , appear to have been widely dispersed in the solar system during the early stages of its formation ; e . g . , the dust ejected from comet 81p / - may have produced @ xmath5o / @ xmath6o ratios that cover the entire solar system instead of @ xmath0 ##2 % . ( nakashima et al . 2012 ) . the simplest mechanism for determining these isotope ratios is the photodissociation of co molecules at the surface of the inner solar nebula ( e . g . , podio et al . 2013 ) , where self - shielding could lead to the transition between gas - phase and liquid - phase co molecules ( e . g . , smith & smith 2005 ; krot et al . ) self - shielding at the cold , dark outer edge of the nebula would( due to the phase separation , theoretically the event would be repeated over time , rather than a one - time event or a nuclear shock event . however , the recent discovery of small particles in ngc 81p / - 1 ( brownlee et al . 2006 ; liu et al . 2008 ; nakamura et al . 2008 ) , which are thought to have formed prior to the protosun , suggests that these small particles undergo large - scale particle transport from the inner solar system to the gas - rich regions of the outer solar system . mgu models provide a way to predict this possible large - scale transport ( e . g . , liu 2008 , 2011 ; liu et al . 2012 ) . ) highly massive stars are thought to be involved in the fu orionis events caused by very low - mass stars ( e . g . , zhu et al . 2010b ; vorobyov & basu 2010 ; liu et al . mgu model models ( e . g . , liu 2011 ) can also lead to the high mass debris disks ( @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 ) used to predict fu orionis events . fu orionis events are estimated to last for about 10 billion years andto occur simultaneously for all low mass protostars ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ; miller et al . mgu models are also capable of describing an alternative mechanism ( disk collapse ) for inner ##eous ##on formation ( e . g . , miller 2010 ; meru & miller 2012 ; basu & vorobyov 2012 ) . however , the magnetorotational effect ( mri ) is expected to be present in fu orionis disks as well ( zhu et al . 2009a ) , with mri occurring in the inner outer ##most disks as well as at the inner outer edge . zhu et al . ( 2009c , 2010a , b ) have proposed one - and two - dimensional ( axisymmetric ) models of a coupled mgu - mri mechanism , with mgu collapse leading to a build - up of mass in the intermediate disk , which then triggers a secondary disk collapse and disk instability . alternatively , mri may occur in the intermediate disk , being accelerated by gamma rays , leading to a build - up of mass in the instability region at the inner disk edge , thus initiating another mechanism of mgu collapse . such a coupling mechanism may be useful for disk stability in t tauri disks , where the low masses are expected tomuch larger than the two stages of formation . we present here two different types of mgu disk models that model the dynamic evolution of the elements , in either the inner or outer solar system , in either a one - time process or a continuous time process , for a range of stars and disk protostar ##s , including protostars with m dwarf disks . high mass exoplanets are expected to be found in an extremely large number of m dwarfs ( bonfils et al . 2013 ; martin & charbonneau 2013 ; kopparapu 2013 ) , with the majority of these being very massive exoplanets , increasing the understanding of gas transport and other phenomena in m dwarf disks . the numerical simulations are performed with the same two dimensional , linear equation code that has been used in previous mgu disk models ( e . g . , martin 2011 ) . more details of the code and its implementation can be found in martin & myhill ( 1992 ) . specifically , the code performs first - order - linear ( in both space and time ) calculations in a spherical coordinate system , using radiative expansion and the spherical coordinates . a spherical coordinate ( @ xmath9 ) system ofthe disk gas energy density is used to measure the anti - rotation of the disk , with values up to and including @ xmath10 . the active grid has 50 grid points for the 50 au radial models and 100 grid points for the 100 au active model . both models have 256 active grid points , and only 100 active grid points , reflecting the rotational period of the disks . the radial grid is spaced along the disk - axis to provide maximum spatial resolution , while the active grid is equally spaced . the dimensions ' scale is chosen to ensure spatial resolution . the disk boundary contains infalling disk gas , which is attracted to the central protostar , while the outer disk boundary retains the mass of non - moving disk gas , while absorbing the mass in the inner disk . the central protostar moves in such a way as to move the center of mass of the inner disk . the time evolution of the color field is used ( e . g . , in 2011 ) in order to measure the movement and diffusion of matter either by the disk gas or by small particles , which should move along with the disk gas . the value for the evolution of the color field is @ xmath11 ( e . g. , ( 2011 ) is equivalent to the above formula for the initial energy density @ xmath12 @ xmath13 where @ xmath14 is the initial angular momentum and @ xmath15 is the radius . the total density of gas is conserved in the same way that the energy density is conserved , and the above equations are expressed in power of units ( e . g . , boss & myhill 1992 ) . the initial surface density distributions are based on the distributions derived by boss ( 1993 ) for the non - rotating disk of a star with radius @ xmath16 @ xmath17 @ xmath18 , \ ] ] where @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 are the parameters , @ xmath21 is the gravitational constant , @ xmath22 is the gas constant , @ xmath23 is the surface density , @ xmath24 ( # ##t ) and @ xmath25 . the initial energy density is @ xmath26 . the initial surface density is @ xmath27 the parameters @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 and the radius parameter @ xmath30 are given in figure 1 for the initialsee examples presented in this article . the total amount of mass in the system does not change during the simulation ; the entire infalling disk then collapses onto the disk , and an additional layer is added to the disk , the outer disk , with @ xmath31 . the outer disk layers are completely opaque to any external source of solar radiation . for the 40 au outer radius disks listed in tables 2 and 3 , the initial disk temperature values ( tables 1 and 2 ) are based on the brown ( 1996 ) temperature profile , with variations in the specified outer disk temperature @ xmath32 , chosen in order to minimize the effect of the different values of the @ xmath2 stability parameter . values of @ xmath33 indicate the more stable disks . the inner disks are more highly @ xmath2 stable , with @ xmath34 . for the 40 au outer radius disks listed in table 3 , the outer disk temperatures are set to the specified outer disk temperature @ xmath32 , leading to uniform high @ xmath2 stability for the disks . for all of the disks , the temperature of the infalling disk is 2 k . the outer disk temperature is equal to the temperature of the inner diskand an equatorial plane of either 60 degrees ( 20 au inner radius disks ) or 40 degrees ( 20 au outer radius disks ) with a circular radius of about 20 au , centered on the disk volume shown in the figure . these images are intended to represent single - shot , multi - shot measurements of molecular heterogeneity , such as p - type black - body scattering or x @ xmath4al ( e . g . , lyons & keiser 2012 ) . table 1 shows both single - shot and continuous injection models , where in the former case the color is applied continuously to the same spot on the object , throughout the experiment , thus representing the photodissociation of oxygen ( e . g . , young & young 2005 ) , leading to the oxygen energy transfer between the gas and liquid phases . the color field in the latter case is intended to represent isotopically distinct # ##eous and those resulting from the same reaction . note that in both the single - shot and continuous injection models , the total amount of color applied is constant ( e . g . , the color field in the latter model is generally not equal to zero ) , and is intended to be applied to the object .and for the disk ( s ) under study . the color field is a massless , diffuse field that has no effect on the disks ' evolution , and the total amount of color added is sufficient for the disks ' dynamic evolution . the authors attempt to model the evolution from equilibrium of the color field , and the total amount of color added ; the division of the magnitude of the color field by the mean angular value , and by the mean angular value at each unit of time , is the basis of these models . studies of the tau tau disk by podio et al . ( 2013 ) have shown that the disk itself fills it ' s outer regions from 10 au to 100 au with a high uv flux , allowing for rapid stellar photolysis and the formation of new water molecules . even higher levels of uv flux can account for protoplanetary disks that form from dense disks of young stars ( e . g . , walsh et al . 2013 ) , an explanation that has been proposed for our early solar system ( e . g . , dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) in order to explain the search for the slris ##s of young stars . the fact that neutral hydrogen forms the vast majority of thethe nu ##n , which can not be directly observed , except in the disk - disk interaction region , means that estimates of disk mass are unreliable at best ( e . g . , smith & smith 2007 ) , as they are not based on an empirical relationship between the mass of medium - mass dust particles and the total disk mass . isella et al . ( 2009 ) found that low - and middle - mass pre - main - sequence stars exist with disk masses ranging from 0 . 05 to 0 . 05 @ xmath1 . the nu ##ri disk has a mass estimated to be as low as 0 . 05 @ xmath1 ( podio et al . ) , the mass of the tw ##b disk was estimated again to at least 0 . 05 @ xmath1 ( bergin et al . 2013 ) . these and other results suggest that the mgu - mass predicted by these models may be present in other types of protoplanetary disks , and possibly in the solar system as well . in addition , smith et al . ( 2011 ) observed a fu orionis outburst in the young t tauri star lkh @ xmath35 188 - g4 . the masses are generally assumed to be @ xmath36 for such outburst . thenote that the fu orionis collapse occurred in lkh @ xmath35 188 - g4 means that even the disks of h ##2 - type stars can undergo collapse due to massive mass loss , e . g . , mgu collapse events . we have models for a variety of protostellar and protoplanetary disk systems , with different minimum @ xmath2 mass values , and different collapse rates , for disks of many different masses . figure 1 shows the initial model for the model with a @ xmath37 disks in orbit around a @ xmath38 protostar . the distances range from 1 au to 10 au , as in the model of brown ( 2008 , 2011 ) . the main difference from these previous models is that the predicted mass ( @ xmath37 ) is much greater than that of the previous model ( @ xmath39 ) . as a result , the predicted minimum @ xmath2 values are much higher than in the previous models , ranging from 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 , compared to the previous models of 2 . 0 to 2 . 2 . the new models are much more likely stable models than the models previously proposed , with the goal being to determine whether or not the previous modelsthese allow for higher values of @ xmath40 . figure 1 shows the initial disk temperature distribution for these models . only the inner regions of the disk are large enough to be tightly bound , and the results show that this is likely to result in very stable conditions for most of the figure 1 models . figures 2 and 3 show the mid ##point distribution of the color / gas ratio ( @ xmath41 ) for periods 1 . 0 - 2 . 0 - 3 . this ratio is linear , and it is similar to the @ xmath4al / @ xmath42al and @ xmath5o / @ xmath6o ratios used by cosmochemists , i . e . , the concentration of an active , photolysis free species , divided by that of the species that was injected in the pre - existing system . figure 3 shows that the initial disk surface temperature at 1 au has resulted in the slow runaway of the red gas back to the ' outer surface , as well as failure to return to the inner disk region after 10 au . the strong three ##fold winds of the mgu system are responsible for this large - scale runaway at about 10 au . at this point , the color / gasit is still highly variable , but figure 4 shows that only 146 days later , the color / density ratio has been completely determined over the entire disk region . figure 4 shows the effect of the change of the ratio of the color density to the gas density for samples 1 . 0 - 2 . 0 - 9 and 1 . 0 - 2 . 0 - 9 at different distances . these samples differ only in the injection radius , either 1 au or 2 au . the ratio shown in figure 4 is assumed to be the square root of the sum of the components of the magnetic field generated by the gas density , multiplied by the weighted average of this field at a given injection radius , multiplied by the magnitude of the weighted average at that radius , multiplied by the number of sample observation times , and multiplied as a function of distance at the sample center . figure 5 shows that the density ratio is a linear function of injection radius and distance , with the ratio actually being very large ( i . e . , around 1 au , in spite of the small increase shown in figure 4 at the same distance ) and a function of the radialboth outward and both inward and outward . however , the density increases significantly in the outer disk for both models at 777 au to a rate of @ xmath0 1 % to 10 % . in contrast , the material in the models 1 . 0 - 2 . 0 - 5 and 2 . 0 - 2 . 0 - 10 moves toward roughly the same radial velocity at this point , so that the changing location of the starting point has no effect on the long term stability of the disk : that is , only on the properties of the surrounding mgu material , which is unique for these two models ( i . e . , the density changes # # ##ly , and has no effect on the model # ##nr ) . note that the small gas grains found in the outer disk will be transported along with the disk itself , so that some of the grains that crop out at 750 au will be transported to the inner disk , in the same way that some of the gas is transported inward . most of the gas and dust , however , is ejected from the surrounding protostar . figure 1 shows the data for both models with values @ xmath40 , i . e . , models 1 . 0 - 2 . 0- 9 , 1 . 0 - 1 . 0 - 9 , and 2 . 0 - 2 . 0 - 9 , all within 1370 days . it can be seen that in spite of the differences in the apparent amount of gas , the parameters of the inner disks exactly correspond to the parameters of @ xmath0 1 % to 2 % . this means that mgu ##2 models are not very sensitive to the correct ##ness of the underlying @ xmath2 model , a result that was also found by boss ( 2011 ) for the more distant disks . as was found by boss ( 2011 ) , the parameters in the inner disks are much higher ( @ xmath0 10 % to 2 % ) than in the outer disks , a direct result of the faster rotation associated with the larger inner disks , in spite of the shorter rotation times of the outer disks . figure 1 shows the initial conditions for the models with the @ xmath43 disks around @ xmath44 protostars , or @ xmath45 disks around @ xmath46 protostars . in each case , the parameters range from 1 au to 10 au . these parameters are of interest for understanding how conditions can change for disks around xb and g dwarfs , with important implications for the evolution of the new stars that formed ( e . g . , raymond et al . 2007 ) from m dwarfs . figure 6 shows the inner disk temperature data for these models . figure 7 shows the initial behavior of the disk for model 0 . 1 - 1 . 8 - 2 , as for a typical m dwarf protostar . as in all the models , it can be seen that the non - outer disk becomes more dense , in this case at around 5000 k . note that this time period is much longer than that for m dwarf star formation and evolution models , as a result of the longer keplerian orbital period for lower mass , m dwarf protostars . as in the m dwarf protostar models ( e . g . , model 1 ) , the inner disk temperature is higher than in the outer disk , but in these models ( with the model of @ xmath47 ) the inner disk temperature drops to @ xmath0 5 % to 10 % , compared to @ xmath0 5 % to 10 % in the outer disk . figure 8 shows the initial behavior for model 0 . 1 - 1 . 8 - 2 , whichdiffers from the first model shown in figure 3 , in that the injection occurs at 20 au instead of 10 au . as for the m dwarf disks , the parameters for all of these models tend toward nearly constant radial velocity : the initial mgu disk size determines the conditions for the models . these conditions hold for the models with @ xmath46 protostars , i . e . , the m dwarf disks . we then return to the study of the effects of single - injection versus multiple injection into the core of much larger # ##most ( 50 % ) disks than has been shown to occur for m dwarf disks ; smith ( 2007 ) found disks extending from 10 au to 20 au in diameter . figure 4 shows the initial conditions for the models with a @ xmath48 disks and a @ xmath38 protostar , with the disks extending from 10 au to 20 au . because of the much larger inner and outer orbital periods for this class of disks , these disks can be studied for periods as long as @ xmath49 years ( figure 5 ) . these periods are typically much longer than the average periods ( @ xmath50 years ) of t tauri disks , meaning that in order for mgu disks to beat these early stages , a second stage of the uv - mgu experiments would be needed to make the required data available . figures 9 and 10 show the evolution of the dispersions for models 1 . 0 - 1 . 1 - 40 - 20 and 1 . 0 - 1 . 1 - 40 - 20c , differing only in that the former model has single - shot injection and the latter model has continuous injection , combining to produce a disk with both continuous photolysis and convection at the outer disk boundary . for model 1 . 0 - 1 . 1 - 40 - 20 , it can be seen that the mechanism is similar to that of the original single - shot model : a rapid increase in the density , followed by cooling to @ xmath0 1 % to 2 % away from the outer disk boundary . the high density fluctuations at the inner disk boundary ( @ xmath0 3 % ) are probably caused by the unphysical break - up of the disk material at 3 au and should be ignored . however , for the continuous injection model shown in figure 10 , it can be seen that the density of the disk material at @ xmath3 au can be as high as @ xmath0 3 %, along with the much greater difference in the oxygen isotope ratios , compared to slri models . in a situation with high - resolution images , as well as with sub - optimal mixing conditions , one would expect much greater mixing to occur , and the energy levels obtained from the two models should be considered to the first order . the total amount of color injected during the continuous injection process is increased , compared to single - shot injection models : for models 1 . 0 - 1 . 1 - 40 - 20c , for example , at 20 au , the total amount of color injected is increased by a factor of @ xmath0 60 compared to the single - shot models , and by a factor of @ xmath0 60 at 27000 years . figures 11 and 12 show the results for continuous injection at ~ 20 au and 20 au , respectively , i . e . , for models 1 . 0 - 1 . 1 - 40 - 20c and 1 . 0 - 1 . 1 - 40 - 30c . in spite of the different angular sizes , figures 11 and 12 show that , at a very early stage ( 405 years ) of development , the angular velocity / composition curves are very similar ; as such , the mguthe effect is the same for both models , and that is the main cause of the long term stability . however , similar results to those shown in figure 11 - 12 were obtained for the two models shown in figure 13 . these results suggest that the key factor in determining the radial velocity rate is whether the effect occurs as a single - event or continuously ; in the latter case , the mgu disk does its best to reduce the gravitational effect , but the fact that this effect is not continuously observed limits the extent to which this effect can be observed . although the grains in the interstellar medium are generally amorphous , crystalline dust grains have been observed in the largest brown dwarfs ( sst - lup3 - 1 ) , at distances ranging from about 1 au to about 10 au , in both the inner and outer regions ( mern et al . ) crystalline dust grains are thought to have been produced by thermal convection in the outer regions of the disk , usually inside of 5 au ( smith et al . 2009 ) . however , thermal convection appears to be insufficient to explain the phenomenon , and the data for the case with the 2 . 5 @ xmath1 protostar suggestthat mgu disks in low mass red dwarf stars may be responsible for these variations . in addition , the mass distributions of protoplanetary disks do not seem to vary with disk mass , radius , rotation rate , disk temperature , or the planet to star ratio ( smith et al . these observations also appear to be consistent with the predictions of the theoretical models , which show that mgu disk phases are also capable of very rapid large - scale expansion and collapse , mass of the star , disk temperature , and the expected value of the @ xmath2 ##al parameter . these models have provided a relatively simple model , showing that a period of strong gravitational attraction between planets and stars with a combination of star and disk temperatures can lead to a rapid inward and outward mixing of massive stars and small grains , as necessary to drive the protostellar disk formation associated with fu orionis outburst , as well as to drive the formation of small grains in * 81p / - ) . the mgu disk phase in the fu orionis outburst is also very likely to have implications for our protosun , and cosmochemically important for understanding the high abundance of @ xmath4al / @ xmath42al .data from a similar explosion event , and the results of @ xmath5o / @ xmath6o were derived from the solar gamma - radiation at the center of the inner solar system . low - mass objects , from g dwarfs to m dwarfs , may also experience a similar pattern of mgu - mixing and formation . in this regard , it is important to note that fu orionis itself , the site of the fu orionis explosion event , has a mass of approximately @ xmath51 ( zhu et al . 2007 , 2009b ; miller & aspin 2012 ) , i . e . , the mass of a g dwarf , and that m dwarf protoplanetary disks may experience mixing similar to that of the solar system , with possible implications for the stability of the outer solar system ( e . g . , raymond et al . 2007 ; bonfils et al . 2013 ; martin & charbonneau 2013 ; kopparapu 2013 ) . we credit jeff cuzzi for his work , the authors for a number of other results , and david keiser , john acierno , and raj pandit for their support of the # ##ing project at dtm . this project is being funded by the large clusters of planetary satellites at( nnx09af62 ##a ) and is credited in part to the national space program ( nna09da81a ) . most of the observations were performed using the solar wind instrument , the development of which was also funded by an american national research council grant ( 0 -
