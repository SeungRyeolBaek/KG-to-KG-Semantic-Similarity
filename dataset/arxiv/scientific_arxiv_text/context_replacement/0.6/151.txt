samples of type 1 agn show a variety of wide and narrow emission lines that provide valuable insight into the structure and properties of photoionized , and therefore stable , stars at the core of the narrow ##ly massive star . wide emission lines , like the narrow h @ xmath0 ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * * z10 ) , are likely to occur in regions near the galactic center serving as the primary source for the local supermassive black hole ( see h @ xmath1 h @ xmath2 ) . h @ xmath0 show a variety of line lengths as well as phase transitions and h @ xcite . despite this , several trends have emerged and are best understood via the comparison of two type 1 agn h @ xcite . population a shows the wide emission - line profiles fwhm h @ xmath0 = 3000 - 4000 and for the narrow ##est seyfert , ( nlsy1 ) , ( fwhm @ xmath3 2000 ) . the h @ xmath0 profiles are therefore best described by a probability density function . population b profiles show fwhm h @ xmath0 =4000 - 12000 and requires two gaussians ( one unshifted and one redshifted ) for a good spectral resolution . ` ` narrow - line ' ' h @ xmath0 sources as narrow as fwhm = 3000 @ xcite and as wide as fwhm = 40000 @ xcite have been reported . it is mostly radio - quiet and pop . b is a mixture of radio - quiet and the presence of radio - loud sources . broad - and narrow - line phase transitions are common and the results can be confusing . weak blue lines like [ oiii ] 5007 are used as a good indicator of the local optical rest frame , despite the presence of ` ` blue lines ' ' , usually found in sources with fwhm h @ xmath0 = 1500 - 3500 and in [ oiii ] @ xcite . blue lines like [ oiii ] blueshifts very wide h @ xmath41000 . strong pop . b sources with blueshifted [ oiii ] are found at higher energies ( or less ) . the use of [ oiii ] and h @ xmath0 blue lines as rest frame sources shows that .h @ xmath0 in pop . b sources usually show a strong red or blue shift at the fwhm energy level . no blueshifted shift or absorption is seen in the primary feii emission components . a h @ xcite . b sources show more complex red shift patterns . the h @ xmath0 source usually shows two components : 1 ) a ` ` classical ' ' broad side ( kb ; fwhm = 4000 5000 ) with moderate or strong ( red or blue ) absorption , and 2 ) a secondary broad ( vbc ; kb ) and redshifted ( @ xmath51000 ) component . studies of the 469 ##2 sdss - dr5 sources suggest that these two components form the primary crystal structure of h @ xmath0 in pop . b sources . low feii emission has been observed in type i sources since the advent of infrared spectroscopy in the 1970s . feii emission lines are most common in a few of the brightest ( spectral type m / m ) sdss ##s ( z10 ) . new evidence has emerged supporting the hypothesis that feii emission occurs in regions near the absorption regions that have very strong emission lines .h @ xmath0 ( see e . g . , @ xcite ) . fwhm feii appears to interact with fwhm h @ xmath0 in the broad range where feii can be observed ( fwhm = 1000 - 12000 ) . this can be clearly seen in h @ xmath6 by comparing the properties ( e . g . , structure ) of the feii 4450 - 4700 spectral region ( and the feii multiplet # ##50 - 5018 ) at [ oiii ] 5007 . in pop . a sources the emission breaks into emission lines and it is much stronger in pop . b sources . sources with the strongest feii emission can show a pattern of h @ xmath0 , as seen if the blend is collisionally unstable in the broad spectral region where the feii emission can be observed @ xcite . these emission line patterns are important factors in models for the structure and properties of the broad spectral band . the most important example is the observed blueshift of high emission lines ( e . g . , civ 1549 ) compared to low emission lines ( e . g . , balmer ) . in pop . a sources (e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? evidence was recently published ( * ? ? ? * @ h08 ) for the existence of a _ strong _ pattern of feii related to [ oiii ] 5007 ( and to the balmer group ) in a sample of type ii galaxies . this pattern , along with a large _ feii band ##ing , has been attributed to feii spectral lines in the region with galaxies affected by infall and located at greater latitude than the region . the pattern of emission @ xmath0 . h08 suggests that the magnitude of the emission correlated strongly with the spectral lines ( h / h @ xmath7 @ xmath8 @ xmath9 ) . evidence for such a feii model have recently appeared @ xcite suggesting the potential existence of such a first - order kinematic model . having worked on the magnitude and phase relationships for many years we were intrigued by the h08 results and decided to test the validity of a possible feii model . could we have predicted it ? so let us see what we have . the quasa##rs has highly symmetric unshifted string - like components @ xmath0 associated with fwhm @ xmath34000 . in our paper on the original ( @ xmath10 17 . 5 ; @ xmath11 17 . 5 ; @ xcite ) sdss dr5 , we analyzed data for @ xmath4260 pop . a source ( from the range of 469 ##2 ; z10 ) and we found no evidence for a significant shift of feii lines relative to the @ xmath0 source . such a feii value should be easy to find in the best pop . a sdss source with strongest z - axis values and strongest feii lines . it is also possible that larger and larger feii values are obtained for pop . a sources . for every one pop . a source in our paper sdss j0946 + 0139 , we found a mean h @ xmath0 or ( @ @ xmath12 ##0 ; ) value of 1830 . this result is similar to oq208 ( @ xcite and also called h08 ) which is @ xmath13 @ xmath142000 . sdss j##0946 is the best example . the source with a high feii was in our z10 sample ( 1 / 260 ) . z10 had 2 sources with an h @ xmath0 peak ( 1 / 260 peak shift ) blueshifted more than - 320 and 2 sources with the same peak more than + 320 . the remaining 241 disappeared . this sample showed no significant h @ xmath0 peak shift ( figure 1 of z10 ) . the feii data applied to these samples showed no significant difference in peak shift between feii and h @ xmath0 . there are two possible causes of small and large h @ xmath0 ( low feii ) shifts : 1 ) host galaxy contamination and 2 ) blue extinction . only in these cases host galaxy contamination is unlikely to produce peak shifts with the effect reported in h08 . small source sources with [ oiii ] blueshifts in the range 1 - 3 are rare and so may not be the cause of the small and ##ious shifts reported in h08 . in the h08 the following are most likely to be strongly affected : 1 ) and 2 ) . h08compare 4000 + sources from sdss dr5 with mean s / n @ xmath15 10 . z10 % matches dr5 where @ xmath494 % of sources show s / n @ xmath15 10 . our data is frequency - dependent with a much lower mean magnitude value ( n = 0 . 5 instead of 0 . 5 ) . how do we draw these conclusions about feii values ? a large part of the problem could be how s / n is calculated . compute s / n over the range 44305500 @ xmath16 . this range improves the accuracy of the measurements because it has fewer emission lines in the spectrum . we compute s / n over the range 5600 - 5800 @ xmath16 , which is full of emission lines and is as close as we can get to an approximation of mean s / n @ 1000 @ xmath0 . in our calculations the h08 s shows mean and mean s / n values of 6 . 5 and 7 . 5 , respectively ; approx . 10 % of s / n @ xmath3 % . we find that all 182 sources of our reference spectrum are located in the h08 s . the size of the h##08 ##2 sources have higher s / n than those in our study . we can also estimate the feii shift lengths using the sdss ##s for sources smaller than the h @ xmath417 - 7 . 0 . in the terms of , our results show that the accuracy of feii shift lengths depends on : 1 ) feii size and feii / n @ xmath0 ##8 size , 2 ) spectral s / n and 3 ) if they rely only on reference to the 4430 - 4680 blend , instead of heii 4686 blend . the individual spectra quoted by h08 _ and _ have high s / n to draw some conclusions about feii size and accuracy . parameter values for these sources are much higher than the parameters associated with our spectral s / n model ( for a type a2 source with s / n @ xmath1720 most of parameter values are smaller than @ xmath181500 ) . the individual spectra with the average feii size and s / n at the spectral boundary are derived from the h08 data and specfit data . for a feii model with parameter values ranging from 0 up to the parameter value derived from h08 , @ xmat##h19 can only range between 0 and e . g . , # ##0 for the sum of the samples . the only alternative is to use the s / s . ##s . h08 means that one can either confirm or deny the existence of a strong feii effect in the ##s because of the wide range of fwhm , flux and # ##es for both h @ xmath0 and feii . this is also true for effects generated from small subsamples of , but less so if one generates them over very wide ranges of input values . one can generate random samples over wide ranges of fwhm h @ xmath0 and feii effects using the 4de1 method ( @ xcite ; z10 ) . 4de1 , a2 ( fwhm h @ xmath0 = 3000 - 4000 , 1 . 5 @ xmath20 @ xmath20 1 . 5 ) and b1 ( fwhm h @ xmath0 = 4000 8000 , @ xmath20 1 . 5 ) are of particular interest because they produce the largest number of thousands of random samples . specfit ##2 ( @ xcite ; flux : @ x##cite ) of the a2 shift plot ( n = 130 z10 ) ( s / n 90 ) is a well - fit solution with low feii strength . the solution for the b1 sample ( n = 131 samples from z10 ; s / n 90 ) is less likely because samples are smaller and feii weaker . table 1 : feii and ##s and # @ xmath21 ratios for specfit solutions given in this section . we also report the values of bc peaks from the various specfit samples , with ` ` ' ' ' shifts occurring at the center of the bc peaks ( # ##o . in no sample does we find any significant difference between feii and the median , or between feii and . we also do not find any systematic feii shifts if we go to samples with l / l @ xmath7 and @ xmath22 ( h08 ; the latter may be responsible for the l / l @ xmath7 ratio ) . since we have no evidence for systematic feii shifts in our z10 - 1 median , it is possible to generate feii shift plots using the h08 method . we generate them using the 4de1and we calculate the values of fwhm h @ xmath0 , feii shift , ( and therefore , fwhm feii ) for each sample . since the range of feii width estimates for h08 is small we focus on the samples with no known mean values . if these values are not known the observed shifts are much less likely to be observed . we now focus on # # ##s for the h08 samples found at 4de1 , a2 and b1 with h08 feii width estimated @ xmath23 ( figure 1 ) . two models were developed for each sample bin : 1 ) one with no limits on feii width ( h08 do not include fwhm feii in their spectral estimates as it is not significantly different from fwhm h @ xmath0 ) and 2 ) one with feii width restricted to the fwhm value of h @ xmath0 for that particular sample ( i . e . , @ xmath24 for a2 and @ xmath25 for b1 ) . upper and lower limits of figure 1 are : a2 ( fwhm h @ xmath0 @ xmath3 4000 ) and b1 ( f##whm ( @ xmath0 = 4000 - 8000 ) , and ( n = 156 for bin a2 and n = 240 for bin b1 ) . the h / h @ xmath4 = - 60 for the minimum . these show best - fit specfit values below . the left and right panels show feii values averaged to the best 1000 and 1500 ##0 , respectively . our theoretical data is shown in @ xcite ##s ##x for the best - fit as shown in the right panel of figure 2 . they were averaged to the minimum @ xmath17 4470 5450 , where feii and spontaneous decay accounted for the maximum , making it the optimal fit for the @ xmath26 region . @ xmath26 values were calculated for the range of possible feii values . in order to obtain confidence , we consider a number of cases with minimum @ xmath27 = + @ xmath28 , for minimum @ xmath29 , along with the best fit and a few other @ xmath27 values in addition to the minimum @ xmath26 . we can see a strong support for zero and near - zero values . the range of @ xmath26 values isdenote h @ xmath30 as appropriate for fits of @ xmath26 and @ xcite . given the large number of degrees of freedom in the frequency range ( 4500 4630 , 5040 5090 , 5310 5360 ) , @ xmath26 matches between the samples are significant at the 50 % confidence level if @ xmath31 . the @ xmath26 results show that best fit and ` ` worst fit ' ' results in figure 1 are not significantly different . the results for h @ xmath5 , are not similar . the second part of figure 1 , also shows clearly that the fit with @ xmath13 = + @ xmath32 ( and compared to the one with 42 samples ) does not include the 42 feii lines . both the above and @ xmath19 results rule out a significant match for at least one of the h08 samples ( viz . ) that the fit to the two very large multiplet 4 feii lines of is @ xmath0 and [ oiii ] 4959 and to the blue side of [ oiii ] 5007 . the redshifted fit fails to include the blue side of the 4450 4700 line and the redthis is supported by the recent appearance of heii 4686 . the latter source was not included in the h08 , leading them to conclude that it was not included in their analysis . this would also explain the appearance of the variation of the feii blue blend , which is the most common feii blend in the composite spectrum of high energy sources ( the blue feii blend is often accompanied by emission lines as well as mgii ##i spectral lines in low energy sources ) . a principal component analysis of the bqs and @ xcite shows that heii4686 # ##ly anticorrelates with them , ( but is eigenvector ##less ) . there is a tendency for the h08 sources with large feii shifts to have a wider and longer ( @ xmath33 ) range of sources , than those with near zero energy ( @ xmath34 ) . thus the presence of heii shifts seems to play a major role in the regions where the largest feii shifts have been found . see the spectra for the list of feii sources in their sections below . the sample sources of the feii # ##s showa large heii signature that , if not removed , will reduce the sample size of a given feii signature . even the case of sources with high feii signatures ( in the bin ) shows no evidence of heii signature . figure 9a of h08 shows that a large number of sources with fwhm ##s @ xmath35 4000 ( bin 1 ) have low feii signatures . the two parts of our figure above are specfit estimates based on the b1 composite , obtained from the h08 data with a feii signature greater than 1 . the analysis is much more complicated than for the a2 composite . it is difficult to compute the feii shift . samples are long , feii is low and under these conditions there are significant limitations on the use of fwhm and other methods for feii ( cf . fig . 2 of @ xcite ) . the same analysis as above for a2 composite has much better results for the feii shift . the same analysis yields @ xmath13 @ xmath36 which is very far from the best possible estimate . if one simply puts @ xmath26 ##0 in the range 4474 4640 ,5040 5105 , 5320 5400 , the @ xmath26 monotonically increases from 0 to ( figure 16 , lower right corner ) , although the shift remains constant until @ xmath17 1100 , where @ xmath37 . b1 feii is too large and the lines are too thin to make assumptions about the lengths and shapes . the existence of these feii shifts is not , and should not be , confirmed . @ xcite ##s published a feii analysis of sdss , and the feii shifts they measured ( their figure 16 ) are much larger than those measured for h08 ( the largest feii shift relative to the spectral lines is at @ xmath18 240 ) . returning to our previous analysis of the sources of data for feii shifts and fwhm , leads us to conclude that high mean y / z and low mean heii values are the norm . the proximity to the 4430 4680 ##0 sample is the best for @ xmath19 240 . the absence of heii4686 from the h08 sample also results in a tendency for heii to ` ` match ' ' the observed feii shifts . this tendency has beenbut the other distribution , where heii is larger than b1 , still supports the conclusion that feii is not redshifted . we base this hypothesis on the heii data from our sample to the combined a2 and b1 data taken from the h08 sample . feii values in bin 4 and 5 of bin 1 range from - 700 to + 770km / s and from 730 to 1570km / s , respectively . the strongly correlated a2 data suggest that heii will represent the entire observed range covered by h08 . we _ do not _ know the feii values corresponding to narrow [ oiii ] and wide [ @ xmath0 ] from type ii agn . we still rule out the possibility of possible red ( or blue ) shifts in both subsamples . the data sets taken from samples with the highest feii values ( @ xmath23 ) show large values with an upper bound @ xmath17 ##70 for bin a2 . in the case of b1 the best fit is @ xmath17700 . the fit is very tightly controlled . in both cases the results are not significantly different from expected . these results do not support the hypothesis of feii values from thethe system ##ity from the data in the central part of . our analysis also shows the properties of feii and of system ##s . the scale changes of feii with respect to the observed values are possible . a similar analysis is possible based on analysis of the s / t values . lcccccc a2 -
