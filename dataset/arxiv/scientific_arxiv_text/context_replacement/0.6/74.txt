quantum systems can be described in ways that resemble classical physics . however , there are examples of non - classicality for measurement results . for example , we consider quantum measurement results , with the two , geographically separated , parties being called alice and bob as well . at the weaker end of the spectrum are quantum systems whose states can also be described as a mixture of product - states of the system . these are called non - classical or classical systems . the product - states contained in such a mixture form a local hidden state ( ns ) model for any measurements performed by alice and bob . at the stronger end of the spectrum are quantum systems whose measurement results also satisfy the bell inequality @ xcite , thus proving ( modulo n @ xcite ) the existence of quantum symmetry @ xcite . this property , known as non - nonlocality @ xcite is the only way for two geographically separated parties to prove the existence of states if one of them , or their other , can not be trusted @ xcite . we say that a quantum system is noise - free if and only if there is a local hidden state ( lhv ) model for any measurements alice and bob perform . if the` variables ' are closely related to classical correlated variables , hence the distinction between non - classical and non - nonlocality . in describing these types of non - classical states is epr - steering . the term was inspired by the original paper of einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) @ xcite , and the follow - up of schrdinger @ xcite , which used the term ` ` variable ' ' for the phenomenon epr was describing . although written ten years ago , as this first article shows , the concept of epr - steering was actually introduced ten years ago , by one of einstein and co - workers @ xcite . this paper shows that epr - steering is the best way to prove the existence of states if one of the detectors , alice @ xcite and her colleagues , could not be used . we say that a given state is epr - steering if and only if it is a kind of epr - steering . a state is called epr - steering if and only if there is a corresponding lhv bob model to the alice bob model . since in this article we are dealing with states , when we refer to the bob .we have a classical model for describing alice ; it is possible that alice could have a slightly different lhv model . the following three concepts of non - steering for quantum states imply for classical states : the dot - dot ##less than is bell - free , eps - free , and eps - nonlocal . but for pure states , the combination of quantum and classical concepts has a much simpler meaning . for pure states the strict combination of the classical concepts leads to a definition for the following problem : the set of pure states is a strict subset of the set of eps - epr - steer states , which is a strict subset of the set of eps - free states @ xcite . although the epr - steer concept has been well defined for all classes of the mixed states ( at least for the case where alice and bob use projective reasoning ) @ xcite , until recently very little was known about what classes of states are , except for the special case of two qubits . for this simple case , the concept of steering in a more general way i . e . , what set can alice influence ' s state by means of her steering has been introduced , using the so - called double arrow .@ xcite . recently , the relationship between the steering model and epr - steerability has been questioned . in this paper , we discuss epr - steerability of the class of two - qubit states whose quantum states are not independent , the so - called t - states @ xcite . we use the steering model above to develop a quantum steering model for projective actions on these states and we conclude that this model is correct . then we determine the sufficient conditions for t - states to be epr - steer , via the epr - steering models @ xcite ( using the # # ##al ##g for the s - model ) . these sufficient conditions are the optimal conditions for most applications of the class of t - states , and everywhere else the distance between them is very large . the paper is structured as follows . in section 2 we discuss in detail the three concepts of non - locality , quantum non - nonlocality , epr - steerability and non - locality . section 3 uses the quantum steering model above for the two - qubit states , and in section 4 we use the quantum algorithm to develop them .this allows for projective measurements in 3 - space . in section 5 , the quantum mechanical mechanisms for quantum n - qubit systems are discussed . and in section 6 we continue and discuss this topic . two independent observers , alice and bob , each use a local quantum state to determine measurement outcomes in different measurement settings . each observer carries out a local measurement , labelled by @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 respectively , to obtain measurement results labelled by @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 . the measurement results are described by a kind of local probability distribution , @ xmath5 , with @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 distributed over the local states . the states of state measured by alice and bob can be determined via the distribution of these probability distributions , for example the measurement results @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 . the states of the _ local - quantum _ system have a local hidden variable ( lhv ) , @ xcite , @ xmath6 for the ` local ' hidden variables @ xmath7 with probability distribution @ xmath8 . thus , the local states can be viewed as arising from variations of the distribution of @ .##math7 , where the final value represents the choice of the states @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 and is independent of the choice of @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 . similarly , a state is said to be _ _ - nonlocal _ if it has _ lhv _ . these states allow , for example , the autonomous operation of a private network between alice and bob without interference from their state @ xcite . in this article , we are concerned with whether the state is _ not _ ; that is , whether it allows for operations that require epr - steering . as stated in the paper , epr - steering by alice is allowed if it is _ not _ the case that the state can be described by a _ lhv _ model , wherein , @ xmath9 where the probability measures @ xmath10 correspond to statistics of the _ outcomes @ xmath11 , i . e . , @ xmath12 . \ ] ] and @ xmath13 is the _ initial probability measure ( povm ) corresponding to the @ xmath2 . the state is said to be _ not _ by alice if it is _ _ _ _2 . the positions of alice and bob can also be used in the example , to allow steerability by hardware . from fig . ( [ lhv ] ) and ( [ v ] ) , it is shown that all nonsteerable states are bell - local . indeed , all bell - nonlocal states are local , by both alice and bob . in particular , the class of such states is strictly smaller @ xcite . thus , while not as strong as bell - nonlocality in general , steerability is still susceptible to hardware attacks @ xcite , and thus to the use of untrusted hardware for the state distribution , albeit only at the level @ xcite . as a similar result , the new quantum state discovered by alice and bob , @ xmath14 , is both bell - local and nonsteerable . however , the class of such states is strictly smaller than the class of nonsteerable states @ xcite . it is important that epr - steerability of a system should not be confused with : the effect of the conditional probability of one measurement on the probability of measurements made by another , which can occur only for quantum states . the word ` quantum 'has been used with reference to this phenomenon , in particular for the concept of ` projective states ' , which we will use in our discussion . epr - steer , as mentioned above , is a special case of this phenomenon , and is only possible for a set of nonseparable states . we are interested in the epr - steerability of states for _ non _ projective _ states . if alice is doing the steering , then it is possible for the state ##1 to be a tomographically ordered set of states . it is easy to see in this context that the requirement for alice to have an explicit representation , viz . ( [ 1 ] ) , leads to the need of a representation of the state @ xmath15 = \ sum _ \ lambda p ( \ lambda ) \ , p ( 1 | e , \ lambda ) \ , \ sum _ p ( \ lambda ) , \ \ \ begin { p _ _ } _ _ p & = \ operatorname { tr } [ \ lambda _ \ otimes \ ] = \ sum _ \ lambda p ( \ lambda ) p ( 1 | e , \ lambda ) . \ begin { tr } \ ] ] . @ xmath16 is anote that can be measured by alice ; @ xmath17 is the result of measuring ` @ xmath18 ' and @ xmath19 is the corresponding result ` @ xmath7 ; @ xmath20 is the partial sum of bob s components corresponding to this result ; and @ xmath21 $ ] is the partial sum of alice s components . note that this result , and hence epr - steerability by alice , is invariant under all linear transformations of bob s components . the epr - steerability in this case , where alice is able to measure a hermitian state , is not easy , with the condition only satisfied for certain special cases such as werner and @ xcite . however , in this case we have a strong enough condition for the epr - steerability of a finite number of two - qubit states , which we assume is not necessary . this condition is satisfied via the construction of a new standard form , which is in turn determined by means of the ` @ spin ##or ' @ xcite . properties of this form are further discussed in the following section . an arbitrary two - qubit state may be written in the standard form @ xmath22 @ @ .##math23 is the quantum correlation matrix , and @ xmath24 , ~ t _ j = \ operatorname { tr } [ \ i \ , \ i \ otimes \ sigma _ j ] , ~ t _ { jk } = \ operatorname { tr } [ \ i \ , \ i _ i \ otimes \ sigma _ j ] . \ ] ] here , @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 are the state variables for alice and bob s qubits , and @ xmath27 is the quantum correlation coefficient . if alice performs a projective transformation on her qubit , and finds the expression corresponding to the @ xmath16 , bob s reduced state , from it . ( [ 1 ] ) { @ xmath28 } { \ operatorname { tr } [ \ i \ , i \ otimes \ sigma ] } . \ ] ] we can also refer to @ xmath20 as bob s ` reduced states ' . to understand bob s ` reduced states , note that the expression @ xmath16 can be written in the same form as @ xmath29 , with @ xmath30 . this is thethe initial condition @ xmath31 , with steering vector is @ xmath32 where @ xmath33 is the associated matrix of , @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 = \ frac { ( a + { \ boldsymbol } , \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } b ) , \ ] ] , @ xmath17 } . in what follows we will refer to the result @ xmath36 rather than the associated matrix @ xmath16 . the domain of the steering vector is defined to be the set of all the points , @ xmath37 , and in general . @ xcite it is known that the coordinates can be obtained from the real - valued functions ( povms ) . the surface has poles @ xmath38 and the semiaxes @ xmath39 . the coefficients of the coefficients of the vector @ xmath40 the eigenvectors of @ xmath41 satisfy the equation of the area around the center @ xcite . thus , the general shape of the steering vector vector is @ xmath42 with @ xmath43 as the centerstarting from the state @ xmath44 . quantum states can have many steering spheres the largest one being the steering ball , which is generated by the other quantum state @ xcite . in particular , the area of the steering sphere is strictly bounded for stable states . therefore , a two - qubit state is stable if and only if the steering ball is contained within the sphere contained within the steering ball @ xcite . thus , the theory of two - qubit states has a simple mathematical formulation in terms of the same steering sphere . no exact proof has been found for epr - steerability , to date . however , for non - stable states , intersection of the steering balls of @ xmath41 , the centre @ xmath45 , and alice s steering ball @ xmath46 , gives the stable state @ xmath47 according to a simple linear combination of alice s , @ xcite , @ xcite and this is used , in particular , to prove the epr - steerability of @ xmath47 . in this way we make a direct connection between epr - steerability and thethe spin matrix , for the case that the diagonal matrices @ xmath48 and @ xmath46 vanish . let @ xmath49 be the singular value decomposition of the spin correlation matrix @ xmath27 , for some diagonal matrices @ xmath50 and some matrices @ xmath51 . assuming that each @ xmath52 is either a rotation or the product of a matrix with the diagonal matrix @ xmath53 , it follows that @ xmath27 can also be represented in the form @ xmath54 , for some matrices @ xmath55 , where the diagonal matrix @ xmath56 may also have multiple entries . the matrices @ xmath57 and @ xmath58 can be replaced by the linear transformations of the shared state @ xmath47 , corresponding to a linear transformation of . thus , many properties of a quantum n - qubit state , including steerability , in particular , can be represented in the form in which the spin correlation matrix has the diagonal matrix @ xmath59 $ ] . it follows that if the shared state @ xmath47 has spin - correlated spin correlation with @ xmath60 , then it has aand , relative to the unitaries , form the pair @ xmath27 , i . e . one can associate @ xmath61 without loss of detail . these states are called t - states @ xcite . they are analogous to pairs of two states , and they occupy the region of the space parameterised by @ xmath62 @ xcite . the t - states also contain @ xmath63 , and the center of the t - states is an arc in the space @ xcite . the t - state rotation matrix is located at the center , @ xmath64 , and the circle itself is at @ xmath65 , which follows from ex . ( [ qse _ mat ] ) and ( [ qse _ mat ] ) with @ xmath66 . the semiaxes contain @ xmath67 for @ xmath68 , and are aligned with the @ xmath69 - axis of the unit ##aries . similarly , the center of the curved curve has polar coordinates @ xmath70 for @ xmath71 , with @ xmath7##2 we see a direct connection between this result and the epr - steerability of x - space in the following example . without loss of detail , consider measurements by alice of hermitian observables on her qubit . these observables can be equivalently represented via : , @ xmath73 , with @ xmath74 . the result of measuring ` @ xmath18 ' and the corresponding unit unit vector is shown in fig . ( [ qsteerb ] ) and ( [ 1 ] ) with @ xmath60 , i . e . , @ xmath75 . , let @ xmath76 be the unit vector corresponding to @ xmath77 in fig . ( [ 1 ] ) , and from fig . ( [ 2 ] ) and , it follows that is an effective representation for alice if and only if there is a representation of the form @ xmath78 for the unit vector @ xmath36 . note also that @ xmath76 can also be represented as a combination of unit vectors , corresponding to ` @ xmath11 , these properties are equivalent to the existence of a representation of the form@ xmath79 with coordinates of the state vector . similarly , the hidden state vector @ xmath80 contains both the individual hidden states and the hidden components . for the case for , for any two t - states , of the form ##s @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 , it is possible to construct an effective model for the t - state corresponding to @ xmath83 , for ` @ xmath84 , via the general property of nonsteerable vectors @ xcite . our goal is to construct _ _ _ _ models for all combinations of t - states , for which the basis ` @ xmath18 ' is uniquely determined by that of @ xmath80 , i . e . , @ xmath85 . effective models can then be constructed for all possible combinations of t - states in this set . to construct effective quantum models , we are motivated by the fact that the corresponding state vectors @ xmath86 are precisely those vectors that form the basis of the corresponding spin basis for the t - state @ xcite . we have the ansatz that @ xmath87 is equivalent tothe definition of the term @ xmath88 is fig . ( [ n _ eqn ] ) that gives this expression , i . e . , @ xmath89 ^ { \ equiv } _ m \ , \ , [ { \ boldsymbol } ] ^ \ intercal ##l ^ { - 1 } { \ boldsymbol } [ \ [ ] ^ { 1 / 2 } \ ] ] for @ xmath90 , where @ xmath91 is a positive constant . then , on the surface of the unit circle , for which @ xmath92 [ @ xmath93 $ ] , the expression is fig . ( [ peint ] ) { @ xmath94 } { ( { \ boldsymbol } n ) { \ mathop { } \ ! \ mathrm { n } } ^ { { \ boldsymbol } { = \ frac12 $ ] . we say this is only true if @ xmath95 is a constant , as a consequence of the expression @ xmath96 for the general case of @ xmath87 . thus , under the assumption that ( for) @ xmath87 is satisfied by the transfer function as per fig . ( [ pform ] ) , and ( 2 ) @ xmath93 $ ] has one constraint for each n . @ xmath36 , the only other constraint to be satisfied by a numerical simulation algorithm for the steady - state is fig .

( [ surface ] ) for @ xmath103 ( see appendix a ) . an equivalent formula for the spatial dimension of @ xmath91 is also given in appendix a , and it is also known that the family of t - states in fig . ( [ surface ] ) is equivalently given by the equation @ xmath104 this can be expressed directly in terms of the geometric ##al value of the ` index ' of @ xmath105 , equal to @ xmath106 . fig ( [ surface ] ) is the matrix of the set of all @ xmath27 matrices , shown in fig . 1 ( right ) as a function of the semiaxes @xmath107 and @ xmath108 . as a consequence of the existence of nonsteerable surfaces ( see below ) , the t - states corresponding to the surfaces enclosed by this plane and the green circle have self - steering properties for all . hence there is the boundary of the local t - state ( @ xmath109 @ xcite ) , in red , which is also a local boundary of the nonsteerable t - states . the red plane corresponds to the necessary condition @ xmath110 for epr - steer surfaces , derived from above . in ##b . it follows that the necessary condition for a t - state to be epr - steer ##able alice is that it corresponds to the plane of the green circle , in red . note that this condition is in fact necessary for alice and bob , since their red planes are the same for t - states . because of the close relationship between our mathematical model and the red plane , and the conditions given above , we know that this condition is a _ necessary _ for epr - steerability . . * in ##f ( t ) * : the red plane is ##tangled ( left ) and tangled ( right) t - states . the additional blue surface corresponds to the necessary condition for epr - steerability given by our generalized linear equation in fig . 4b : all t - states to the right of this surface are also epr - steer . we show that this condition is also true , i . e . , that all states to the right of the blue surface are epr - steer . for example , the red line corresponds to the necessary condition for epr - steerability in . . ( [ linsuff ] ) of figure 5a : all t - states to the right of this surface are epr - steer . only a few of the curves are connected , and they are shown as part of @ xmath111 . * bottom figure ( b ) * : this cuts to the bottom figure of @ xmath112 , where the necessary condition can be found . ( see below . the ( red line ) corresponds to the non - trivial necessary condition for epr - steerability in [ . . , height = " height : " , width = 336 ] . * bottom figure ( a ) * : the red line is connected ( left ) and connected ( right ) .- 3 . the additional blue surface corresponds to the sufficient condition for epr - steerability satisfied by our original linear formulation in sec . 4b : all t - states to the right of this surface are also epr - steer . we assume that this condition is also equivalent , i . e . , that all states to the right of the blue surface are epr - steer . for example , the blue surface corresponds to the sufficient condition for epr - steerability in sec . ( [ linsuff ] ) of theorem 5a : all t - states to the right of this surface are epr - steer . only a few of the conditions are equivalent , and they are invariant to those of @ xmath111 . * see figure ( right ) * : see this for the corresponding figure of @ xmath112 , where the last condition can be satisfied . ( see ) . the additional blue - surface corresponds to the non - trivial ##ity condition for epr - steerability [ . . . , height = " 1 : " , width = 259 ] when @ xmath113 we can solve sec . ( [ * ] ) * , because the solution of @ x##math91 } . the corresponding solution of the @ xmath108 semiaxis , in terms of @ xmath114 , is given by @ xmath115 ^ { - 1 } & u < 1 , \ \ \ , [ 1 - \ frac { \ sqrt { 1 - u ^ { - 2 } } } { - ( u ^ { - 2 ) } \ ln \ frac { | 1 - \ sqrt { 1 - u ^ { - 2 } } | } { 1 + \ sqrt { 1 - u ^ { - 2 } } } \ right ] ^ { - 1 } & u > 1 , \ end { aligned } \ right . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] and @ xmath116 for @ xmath117 . equation ( 2 ) gives this same epr - invariant boundary for the zero - norm case @ xmath118 , showing more clearly the spatial boundary ##s . the corresponding equation @ xmath119 applies to werner states . our corresponding corresponding solution is for @ xmath120 in this case , which is used to show the epr - invariant boundary for werner states@ xcite . however , our model is not sufficient for this set of states . in the next section a second necessary condition for the epr - steerability of t - states is given , similar to the condition given in fig . ( [ 2 ] ) and illustrated in fig . 3 . although we have shown that this condition is indeed necessary , it is not necessarily necessary if all t - states satisfying this condition satisfy epr - steering . thus we define two additional necessary conditions for epr - steerability , and apply them to t - states . these conditions satisfy conditions of epr - steering inequality , i . e . , probability distribution , that cannot be satisfied by the standard model for states @ xcite . therefore , existence of such an inequality also implies that alice and bob already have an epr - steering state . our first model is based on a nonlinear epr - steering inequality for the s - matrix , and the second on a new nonlinear epr - steering inequality @ xcite . the epr - steering conditions are also of interest in that they are invariant under the action of alice and bob . ##nr . suppose alice and bob have a one - qubit state withspin correlation coefficient @ xmath121 given by @ xmath122 and that we can define a hermitian matrix on their qubit . we show in fig [ app : cov ] that , if there is an effective expression for it , then the values ##ities @ xmath123 , @ xmath124 , @ xmath125 of the spin correlation matrix all satisfy the corresponding epr - steering condition @ xmath126 from @ xmath127 , and from @ xmath60 and @ xmath128 for t - states , it follows , that bob has the self _ steering _ condition @ xmath129 for the epr - steerability of t - states ( for example alice or bob ) . the set of t - states satisfying this condition is shown in fig . 2 ( a ) and ( b ) , showing that the condition is very strong . in particular , where is the tangent vector to the steering function at the point corresponding to werner states ( which we now know to be the point on the inner boundary of epr - steering states ) . however , for small samples , a stronger condition can be satisfied , as per the. . alice and bob construct a two - qubit system as follows , where bob can measure the observables @ xmath130 , @ xmath131 on his qubit , with @ xmath132 , for [ @ xmath133 $ ] , and alice can measure the hermitian observables @ xmath134 on her qubit , with each represented by @ xmath135 . it can also be shown that the quantum state for x must satisfy the epr - type [ @ xcite @ xmath136 , \ hat { 0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath137 is the result that alice obtained for @ xmath138 , and @ xmath139 is the obtaining the vacuum expectation value for @ xmath130 for this state . as per the second part of fig . 4a , we can also use a representation in which the quantum correlation coefficient @ xmath27 is zero , i . e . , @ xmath140 $ ] , without loss of information . given the states @ xmath141 and @ xmath142 in this representation , then @ xmath143and @ xmath139 is replaced by @ xmath33 and the second component of @ xmath144 replaces the . ( [ q ] ) and ( [ qsteerb ] ) , respectively , with @ xmath145 . thus , the above inequality reduces to @ xmath146 , \ { { [ } \ ] ] where @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 are the two components of alice and bob - independent of @ xmath48 and @ xmath46 . for t - states , given that @ xmath149 , the above inequality reduces to , to the special case @ xmath150 . , since these results can be obtained by using @ xmath151 , we have the _ t _ condition @ xmath152 for the epr - steerability of t - states . the set of t - states satisfying this inequality is shown in fig . 1 ( below ) for the case @ xmath112 . it is said to be stronger than the above inequality in fig . ( [ linsuff ] ) if the semiaxis is sufficiently small . thesimply satisfying the necessary conditions is not different from the # ##ness of our boundary conditions , confirming our conjecture that the boundary is the optimal solution . in this way we have studied models for the set of n - qubit states with only independent marginals ( ` t - states ' ) , where alice is allowed to take only projective measurements on her qubit . we have constructed the lhv steering model ( lhv for alice , hc for bob ) , which includes the quantum steering for strongly interacting , and a corresponding set of non - interacting , t - states . that is , this model extends the above model , in which alice by default maps bob s state to the werner state on the boundary of the quantum steering plane . our model is constructed from the clifford algebra , and agrees with the corresponding lhv steering model for the set of werner states . however , only a small ( and possibly infinite ) gap exists between the set of t - states that are strongly non - interacting by our lhv steering model , and the states that are weakly interacting by the quantum steering model that we observe . as such , we conclude that this gap##v this model is in principle valid for state - space . even this , however , remains an open problem . a further extension of this problem is to the lhv statistical models for arbitrary two - qubit systems . how can any of their steering laws be incorporated into our lhv statistical models ? efforts in this area have already begun , but the problem becomes even more complicated when alice and bob / alice both have nonzero components and the problem of ` ` two - way mixing ' ' has become @ xcite . finally , our lhv statistical models refer to the case where alice is restricted to states of hermitian observables . it would be of great interest to extend these to other povm states . however , we find that this is a very difficult task especially for the case of two - qubit werner ##s @ xcite . however , the steering law is a collection of all possible states , including those obtained from povms ( they are the initial states of the system ) and so this may provide some guidance for how to deal with this problem . sj would like to thank john jennings for his many contributions to this field . sj has retired .epsrc / ep / k022512 / 2013 . this work was funded by the european research council centre of excellence ce110001027 and the european union seventh framework programme ( fp7 / 2007 - 2013 ) research funding for the @ xmath153 [ 316244 ] . the set of 3 - surfaces described by our original fundamental theorem in fig . 4b corresponds to the set described by solutions of n .

( [ qv ] ) can also be written in the form : @ xmath200 to determine the the surface component of @ xmath199 , note that the integral of @ x##math184 , @ xmath201can been evaluated directly by examining the expressions @ xmath202 , or @ xmath203 for either @ xmath204 , or @ xmath205 . using the expressions for @ xmath206 and @ xmath207 , from , we get @ xmath208 we only need to add the last term to @ xmath181 . using the expression @ xmath209 the general surface integral reduces to the form that can be obtained by mathematica ( or by complex analysis on the unit circle or the complex plane ) : @ xmath210the general form of is obtained by using the expressions @ xmath211 and @ xmath212 , for which @ xmath213 and the integrand reduces to @ xmath214 , which reduces to yield @ xmath215 . then , unsurprisingly , we take the integral sign . this allows the first term of the integral to be @ xmath216 _ 1 = \ frac { \ pi \ to \ pi } { x [ x \ .##s ^ { 2 } \ alpha + [ ( a \ sin ^ { 2 } \ beta + b \ sin ^ { 2 } \ alpha ) \ sin ^ { 2 } \ beta ] ^ { 1 / 2 } } . \ end { 1 } \ ] ] the results of @ xmath184 for the first two parameters of @ xmath199 , etc . ( [ qvnew ] ) are still not very good . however , there is a simple method that allows us to integrate both the parameters and , and that is to integrate the integral with respect to the parameters @ xmath217 and @ xmath218 . since the only dependence between @ xmath217 and @ xmath218 is on the parameters @ xmath219 , this removes the need to integrate for @ xmath184 . in fact we only need to integrate with respect to one of these parameters , namely @ xmath217 . to see this , note that @ xmath220where @ xmath221 can be found by the integration of the functions and . in particular , @ xmath222 ^ { 1 / 2 } } \( ) \ end { 1 } \ ] ] @ xmath223 ^ { 1 / 2 } } . \ end { 1 } \ ] ] combining the first two terms and the expressions for @ xmath224 and @ xmath225 into the expression above , and using the expressions @ xmath226 and @ xmath227 as above , we obtain : @ xmath228 ^ { 2 } } { \ mathop { } \ ! \ mathrm { 2 } } \ , \ nonumber \ \ \ sin { xy1 } ~ & = & \ sin ^ { 2 } \ , \ int _ { 2 } ^ { 2 \ phi } \ frac { ( \ sin \ beta \ sin \ sin \ sin \ phi + \ sin \ beta \ sin ^ { 2 } \ phi , \ sin \ beta \ sin ^ { 2 } \ phi + \ sin \ sin \ sin \ sin \ sin \ phi ) } { ( n \ sin ^ { 2 } \ phi + n \ sin ^ { 2 } \ phi + 2n \ sin \ sin \ sin \ phi ) ^ { 2 } } { \ sin##op { } \ ! \ mathrm { 1 } } \ right . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] therefore , there are two additional values we need to compute and these can be used in mathematica ( or in real analytic geometry ) : @ xmath229 using the values we computed for @ xmath230 we put these values into place and carry out @ xmath217 to compute @ xmath231 _ 2 = \ pi \ int \ frac { \ sin ^ { 2 } \ alpha ( m \ sin \ beta - m \ sin \ beta ) } { ( m - n ^ 2 ) ^ { 1 / 2 } } , \ int \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath232 ^ { 1 / 2 } } , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] and @ xmath233 _ 2 = \ pi \ int \ frac { \ sin ^ { 2 } \ alpha ( m \ sin \ beta - m \ sin \ beta ) } { ( m - n ^ 2 ) ^ { 1 / 2 } } d \ alpha \ \ \ end { qv2 } & = \ frac { m ^{ - 1 } \ alpha \ sin \ beta \ sin \ beta } { [ b \ sin ^ 2 \ alpha + c \ sin ^ 2 \ beta ( b \ sin ^ 2 \ alpha + c \ sin ^ 2 \ beta ) ] ^ { 1 / 2 } } . \ { { 1 } \ ] ] the existence of these conditions can be proved by assuming that these conditions hold for @ xmath211 i . e . , when the axis @ xmath234 is aligned with the @ xmath101 - axis , they should imply that . then the conditions of viz . and apply to @ xmath235 . combining this with viz . ( [ qv3 ] ) and ( [ qv1 ] ) - ( [ qv2 ] ) , we get @ xmath236 and similarly for @ xmath237 , the result is as follows . similarly , the corresponding function @ xmath91 in viz . ( [ 1 ] ) can be directly found in mathematica . under the assumption that @ xmath238 , and @ xmath239 . we get @ xmath24##0 + ib ( b + a ) = [ a ] + ib ( a - b ) ( e [ a _ 1 , b ] - e [ a _ 2 , b ] ) + ib ( a + b ) ( f [ a _ 1 , b ] - f [ a _ 2 , b ] ) \ { \ } \ right ) , \ { { 1 } \ ] ] to obtain the following epr - type result in q . ( [ lin ] ) , let @ xmath253 be a dichotomic function that alice can perform on her qubit , with parameters given by @ xmath135 , where @ xmath157 is a random variable . we will give a simple example of @ xmath253 # . consider the following : # @ xmath254 if there is an alternative definition for , then , note that we can use @ xmath255 . q . ( [ lin ] ) to be true without loss of argument , there are examples @ xmath256 such that @ xmath257 \ , [ { \ boldsymbol } } ( \ right ) - { \ boldsymbo##l } [ ] \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } [ $ ] , where @ xmath258 , and the end point @ xmath11 define the inner sphere @ xmath76 . thus , the inner sphere can be divided into two parts , @ xmath259 \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } [ \ geq [ \ } $ ] and @ xmath260 \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } [ < 0 \ } $ ] , for each value of @ xmath7 . similarly , for @ xmath261 , @ xmath262 is equal to @ xmath263 \ , [ { \ boldsymbol } v ( \ lambda ) - { \ boldsymbol } v ] \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } v \ right . \ \ & ~ & \ left . + \ int _ { v _ - ( \ lambda ) } { \ mathop { } \ ! \ mathrm { \ } } ^ { { \ boldsymbol } } \ , [ \ int _ { { \ boldsymbol } v } ( \ lambda ) - \ alpha { \\ } _ { { \ boldsymbol } v } ] \ , [ { \ boldsymbol } n ( \ lambda ) - { \ boldsymbol } b ] \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } v \ right \ } \ , { - } \ ] ] @ xmath264 \ , [ { \ boldsymbol } n ( \ lambda ) - { \ boldsymbol } b ] \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } v \ right . \ \ & ~ & - \ } . \ int _ { n _ - ( \ lambda ) } { \ mathop { } \ ! \ mathrm { d } } ^ 2 { \ boldsymbol } } \ , [ & + \ int { \ lambda } _ { { \ boldsymbol } v } ] \ , [ { \ boldsymbol } n ( \ lambda ) - { \ boldsymbol } b ] \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } v \ right \ } \ \ & = & \ int _ \ lambda n ( \ lambda ) \ int { \ mathop { } \ ! \ mathrm { d } } ^ 2 { \ boldsymbol} w \ , | [ { \ boldsymbol } n ( \ lambda ) - { \ boldsymbol } b ] \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } v | \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath265 \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } w \ \ & = & \ int _ \ , w ( \ lambda ) | { \ boldsymbol } n ( \ lambda ) - { \ boldsymbol } b | \ , \ int { \ mathop { } \ ! \ mathrm { 1 } } ^ { { \ boldsymbol } w \ , | { \ boldsymbol } v \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } n ( \ lambda ) | , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath266 is the unit vector in the @ xmath267 axis , and the last term obtained by taking the components and integration of the last term of the above equation . the integral of the last term can be obtained for any value of @ xmath7 by rotating the axis so that @ xmath268 is aligned with the @ xmath101 - axis , and@ xmath269 . therefore , the schwarz inequality can be written as @ xmath270 ^ { 1 / 2 } \ \ \ begin { cav } & \ leq & \ frac { 1 } { 1 } \ sqrt { { - { \ boldsymbol } , \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } [ } , \ begin { c } \ ] ] where the second and third equations are called the schwarz inequality and @ xmath271 , respectively . note , by the authors , that the schwarz inequality is valid for the case @ xmath272 \ cdot { \ boldsymbol } ( \ { ) $ ] . now , comparing the case @ xmath273 with @ xmath274 , one sees from fig . ( [ cjk ] ) and ( [ cc ] ) that @ xmath275 compared with fig . ( [ cav ] ) , yields the epr - schwarz inequality @ xmath276 similarly , this inequality can also be derived from the formula in which the authors use the sign ##or # @ xmath121 in any order , with each rotation corresponding to a constant .the spin ##ity of @ xmath121 ( corresponding to the quantum rotation of @ xmath27 ##7 , . 4a ) . since @ xmath277 is invariant under quantum gravity , and .
