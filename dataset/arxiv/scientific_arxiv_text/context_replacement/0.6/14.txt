quantum and bose - einstein coupling ( bec ) of molecules @ xcite has also been demonstrated successfully on ultracold molecules with light - induced feshbach molecules @ xcite . in these molecules , feshbach resonance is achieved by placing a single molecular atom in the optical continuum , which allows for an energy transfer of these atoms into space . this mechanism works for almost all noble metals , and helps distinguish ultracold molecules from bose gases @ bose gases @ xcite , ordinary bose gases @ xcite , and quantum bose gases @ xcite . feshbach molecules have interesting and unique properties . they can have only a single - electron ground state , and the excited state can only interact to the scattering state via feshbach resonance . we can ask the following question : should feshbach molecules better be considered as atoms in a quantum rovibrational state or as groups of molecular atoms in the continuum ? this question is also used in the study of the bec to bcs ( bose - hall - schrieffer coupling ) transitions in ordinary bose gases , which allows for a study of the quantum dynamics of the feshbach molecule @ xcite . .the near feshbach resonance has been successfully predicted based on simple and accurate two - body and three - body theory @ xcite and multi - body resonance theory @ xcite . these results show that the feshbach molecule is actually a complex mixture of the foreign molecule in the closed channel and long - range resonance ##s in the open - channel . for systems with large channel sizes , the system can be best described by atoms in the open channel . for large systems , as predicted by the theory @ xcite , the closed channel model and a long - range resonance model is used . in this model , we use a simple single - channel model to model the real atoms in a feshbach resonance ( sec . ii ) . to account for the large energy levels of the molecules , we use a black hole model , which allows us to accurately model the lower energy states in the channels and their interaction states ( sec . iii and sec . iv ) . furthermore , we apply our model to feshbach resonance from the quantum mechanical simulations and to model the near feshbach resonance ( ) . we model the interaction of two massive , ultracold molecules with atoms @ xmath0 ##2 in the open channel @ xmath##1 that supports the scattering continuum and the open channel @ xmath2 that supports the highest excited state . the wave function of the state is then expressed as @ xmath3 , where @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 are the energies of the open and closed channels , respectively , and @ xmath6 is the inter - channel energy . we have the state @ xmath7 , represented by a black hole , with an energy potential of @ xmath8 , see fig . ( 1 ) . for @ xmath9 , the interaction energy of the open channel is , and the closed channel @ xmath10 . for @ xmath11 , the open ( closed ) channel has an interaction potential of @ xmath12 @ xmath13 , and a coupling of @ xmath14 between the channels . the wave function is the schrdinger equation : @ xmath15 . the quantum state with energy @ xmath16 corresponding to the scattering continuum is described by the open channel . , [ = 211 ] the solution of the wave equation for the scattering length @ xmath17 can be expressed as : @ xmath18 where the scattering length @ xmat##h19 and @ xmath20 are real , @ xmath21 " the total wave vector " for @ xmath11 together with the wave vector @ xmath22 . based on the boundary conditions @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 , we get @ xmath25 the following table shows how in general , open channel contributes to the energy spectrum . in single electron scattering , feshbach channels are , in many cases , affected by weak interactions and spin - orbit interactions . these interactions are several orders of magnitude larger than the standard long range weak interactions . it is an easy approximation to get @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 . similarly , we get @ xmath28 , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 . in this case , the open channel contribution is valid only when the quantum state is close to the origin , in which case the last term in fig . ( 6 ) disappears . writing the components of the open channel contribution as @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 , the boundary condition @ xmath33 allows us to write the last term in fig . ( 5 ) as @ xmath34 . since @ .##math35 for the feshbach coupling equation . to the second order of analysis , the second term in equation . ( 7 ) is the coupling of the channel and can be expressed as @ xmath36 , where @ xmath37 is the background scattering properties . and ( 8 ) reduces to @ xmath38 finally , the total coupling between the channel and the ground state can be expressed as with the magnetic field @ xmath39 - the phase factor @ xmath40 , where @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 are the magnetic moments of the entire ( quantum ) channel . dividing @ xmath16 by @ xmath43 , we can express equation . ( 9 ) in terms of the magnetic moment of @ xmath44 where the resonance length @ xmath45 and the resonance width @ xmath46 are given by @ xmath47 . interesting results are discussed below . first of all , we know the resonance length is related to both the feshbach coupling @ xmath48 and the background scattering properties @ xmath49 . the wavelength dependence is due to the fact that the field strength at short wavelengths is proportional to the resonance width . .for long background scattering lengths leads to a stronger coupling to the open channel . finally and finally , the resonance shift is given by : @ xmath45 relative to the boundary of the bare state and the continuum , @ xmath50 , in ref . ( 2 ) . for small background scattering lengths @ xmath51 , this shift is approximately @ xmath52 . this also leads to the renormalization " of the feshbach coupling ##s " in ref . @ xcite . to understand the effect of the resonance shift , we should turn to physics . the change of the scattering length occurs when the open channel one ( start term ) is slightly offset from the closed channel one ( end term ) . for molecules with small background scattering lengths @ xmath53 and large feshbach coupling @ xmath48 , this cancelation can occur even when the bare state is far away from the continuum . a strong phase shift also occurs . next we look to the binding energy of the molecule . if a single molecule ##space @ xmath54 is on the continuum , @ xmath55 , where @ xmath56 is the binding energy , we can obtain @ xmath57 by doing exactly the same thing .ref . ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) . the solution of ref . ( 11 ) gives @ xmath58 where @ xmath59 . for @ xmath28 and the bound states in opposite directions , corresponding to the resonance , respectively , @ xmath53 and @ xmath60 , we can change the bound terms on the left side of ref . ( 7 ) to the terms for @ xmath36 and @ xmath61 , respectively . ref ( 12 ) then corresponds to @ xmath62 this result proves the existence of the bound states in the resonance . this result is derived from ref . @ xcite ##r of the standard model . we can also see that in the absence of the feshbach coupling @ xmath63 , the solutions of ref . ( 13 ) give @ xmath64 and @ xmath65 ( for @ xmath51 ) , which then correspond to the corresponding bound states in the closed channel and the open channel ( for @ xmath51 ) , respectively . in the absence of the feshbach coupling @ xmath66 , ref . ( 14 ) gives an additional set of " - free " states , whichfig . ( 14 ) , which also shows the observed energy distribution . the energy distribution , however , is not linear as it is in a two - dimensional system . in fact , for the transition energies , the bound state energy crosses the boundary quadratically , see fig . ( 14 ) below . starting from the boundary , the bound state is the energy minimum of the boundary ( . , bound state ) . we write ( a ) @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 and ( b ) @ xmath69 and @ xmath68 , where @ xmath70 cannot have the same energy level . we denote the boundary by ##s . to show the approximate behavior of the bound state . , [ = 268 ] to accurately represent the behavior of the open and closed channels , we can write the wave function of the boundary ##space as @ xmath71 and , with our assumptions , @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 and the mixing amplitude @ xmath74 is given by . we assume in fig . ( 15 ) that the bound state energy includes both the closed channel and open channel . we can calculate the mixing amplitude @ xmat##h75 is the energy of the closed channel @ xmath76 the energy of @ xmath77 can be calculated by a simple calculation of the closed channel wave function . however , assuming that the method only leads to the dependence of the excited state near the crystal surface , we can also calculate @ xmath77 from the dependence of @ xmath57 and @ xmath16 , and from the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule @ xmath78 . all these lead to the final result @ xmath79 unlike the more complicated calculations described in previous sections , the feshbach molecules are stable and stable in the resonance regime . using fig . ( 9 ) with the @ xmath57 and @ fig . ( 10 ) - ( 11 ) , we find the kinetic energy of the feshbach molecule has a linear dependence on the scattering length and varies quadratically with magnetic moments near the surface , namely , @ xmath80 where @ xmath81 . fig ( 12 ) shows the dependence of scattering length and energy fraction ##s of the crystal molecules in the resonance regime @ xcite . similarly , using the value @ xmath82 in fig . ( 13) and ( 13 ) , we obtain the resonance distribution function that is purely in the open channel . the resonance range is given by the parameter , @ xmath83 , and can be much larger than the interaction range @ xmath84 . within this limit , the feshbach molecules are bound to long - range ion pairs in a small open channel . by expanding fig . ( 12 ) for smaller @ xmath85 and from fig . ( 13 ) , we obtain the open channel fraction can be expressed as @ xmath86 where @ xmath87 . from fig . ( 14 ) , we find that @ xmath88 is the first edge region of the open channel fraction . when @ xmath89 = @ xmath90 ( this also happens when @ xmath91 ) , the feshbach molecule is purely in the open channel . as before , the interaction range is larger for resonance with smaller @ xmath48 and @ xmath92 . we can then obtain the " electron - capture " fraction by expanding @ xmath93 from fig . ( 13 ) . for resonance with smaller @ xmath94 ,this region corresponds to @ xmath95 , which , in terms of electric charge , corresponds to only a small region of @ xmath96 around the center @ xmath46 . for molecules with only @ xmath97 , the open channel is when @ xmath98 , which covers the entire channel as when @ xmath99 , and covers the full long range of the excited state when @ xmath100 . based on the definition of the open channel parameter , we let the broad ( wide ) resonance be described as those with @ xmath97 ( @ xmath101 ) . given the range of the feshbach resonance , the molecules associated with the broad ( wide ) resonance are usually described as long range pairs in the open channel ( short range pairs in the closed channel ) . we note that this description is not based on two - electron interactions . . definition of the @ xmath102li and @ xmath103k feshbach resonance . the parameter @ xmath8 is derived from q . @ xcite , full h . feshbach resonance @ xmath48 is derived from q . @ xmath104 .the energy and @ xmath105 of a molecule . [ options = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , options = " ^ " , ] [ table1 ] ( solid lines ) and mixing fraction @ xmath77 ( dashed lines ) of the molecules in the @ xmath102li and @ xmath103k feshbach resonance . the energies are calculated from fig . ( 13 ) , fig . ( 14 ) and the molecules in table 1 . the data from multi - electron experiments @ xcite ( dashed lines ) , from jila ##p experiments @ xcite ( solid lines ) and the mixing fraction calculated from the experiment @ xcite ( solid lines ) are available for comparison . the dashed lines represent the two bec - bcs experimental experiments , @ xmath106 . , n = 268 ] here , we compare our results to the @ xmath102li @ xmath107 and @ xmath103k @ xmath107 feshbach resonance calculated by the bec - bcs experiments @ xcite . these molecules are located at the nucleus and have the same structurethis and the interaction length have been extensively studied and calculated @ xcite . to model the interactions of atoms , we choose @ xmath46 , @ xmath45 , @ xmath108 and @ xmath109 from our experimental and numerical simulations . to account for the threshold range of the atomic structure , which at low energies is described by the van der waals law of @ xmath110 , we choose the interaction length @ xmath8 from our simulations to approximate the maximum scattering length @ xmath111 calculated in 1984 . this choice gives the correct value of the interaction length in the threshold range @ xcite . the results are given in table 1 . in ref . ( 2 ) , we use the maximum binding energy @ xmath57 and the mixing fraction @ xmath77 of the feshbach potential for the two @ xmath102li resonance and the @ xmath103k resonance . the results agree very well with the multi - resonance model @ xcite and the calculations of the binding energy @ xcite , magnetic moment @ xcite and mixing fraction @ xcite . both the c resonance at 834 k and the d resonance are consistent with @ xmath##112 and @ xmath113 , respectively . the open channel - coupling energy of @ xmath114 210 khz for the 834 k li resonance is much lower than the coupling energy of @ xmath115 200 khz for the resonance . ( so the corresponding quantum number is @ xmath116 . ) for the li resonance , the energy - spectrum of the crossover state is open channel , with energy much greater than @ xmath117 . therefore , we consider the open channel coupling of these feshbach molecules in the crossover state to be a good approximation . for the second li resonance , @ xmath118543 hz , we consider @ xmath119 and @ xmath120 , and @ xmath121 200 khz . this gives an extremely strong open channel coupling of less than 1 @ xmath109 hz at the surface , where the coupling constant is doubled by @ xmath122 . the experiments performed on these feshbach molecules can only be described by open channel coupling , and therefore lead to very poor results . we attribute the large difference between the two li resonance to their different energies @ xmath48 and their differentfor details on @ xmath37 , see table 1 . in the following table , we note that mixing energy @ xmath123 is an important parameter which depends on the nature of the molecule . whether the states of the scattering spectrum can be described by single channel models depends on the parameters . the @ xmath124 model , therefore , is a better and simpler way to describe feshbach resonance . we note that the narrow feshbach resonance on @ xmath102li are the only examples of wide and narrow resonance with @ xmath112 and @ xmath125 . in addition , the single - channel model is a simple way to describe the broad ##ness of the feshbach resonance . the experimental results of the molecular scattering spectrum and mixing energy of @ xmath102li and @ xmath103k agree with the experimental and the theoretical results as well . based on the " nature of the molecular state , we need a dimensionless model to describe the states " of the feshbach resonance . we thank j . a . hansen and j . nygaard for the us and m . muller of vienna and the scientists of germany for the work during ourspringer . the project is partly funded by the lise - funded program of the german research foundation ( fwf ) . a . jochim , m . bartenstein , j . altmeyer , j . hendl , m . riedl , c . schmidt , j . hecker denschlag and r . grimm , science * 302 * , 2101 ( 2003 ) ; m . greiner , m . a . wang , y . h . jin , science * 426 * , 537 ( 2003 ) ; j . zwierlein , j . a . stan , j . a . schunck , j . j . a . raupach , s . gupta , m . hadzibabic , and j . ketterle , phys . 91 * , 250401 ( 2003 ) . m . herbig , j . kraemer , j . schmidt , j . schmidt , c . schmidt , j . - l . ngerl , and r . grimm , science * 301 * , 1510 ( 2003 ) ; m . drr , j . volz , j . marte , and j . rempe phys . rev . * 91 * , 020406 ( 2004) ; y . xu , y . mukaiyama , j . m . al - shaeer , j . r . lee , j . lee , and j . ketterle , phys . rev . lett . * 65 * , 210402 ( 2003 ) . m . marcelis , j . j . j . van kempen , j . j . verhaar , and s . j . j . m . f . kokkelmans , phys . a * 65 * , 012701 ( 2004 ) ; s . j . j . m . f . kokkelmans , m . m . milstein , m . m . chiofalo , m . walser , and j . m . brown , phys . a * 65 * , 053617 ( 2002 ) .
