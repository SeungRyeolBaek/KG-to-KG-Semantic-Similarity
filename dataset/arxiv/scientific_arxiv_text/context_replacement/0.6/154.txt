several developments in the last two decades have transformed the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics from a formal theory to a theoretical theory of physics , such as a quantum field collapse at the scale of one dimension or more . despite its name the sm is not an entirely new model , however , because it has many fundamental features . in particular , the quantum field collapse , _ i . e . _ , the collapse of the electroweak scale @ xmath7 without radiative confinement , has captured the attention of many theorists and led to the development of a number of models of physics like the sm that challenge competing theories at scales even well beyond the tev scale . a particularly promising model for approaching the electroweak scale , using a compact extra dimension with a non - factorizable anti - de ##hn ( ads @ xmath8 ) background , is the randall - sundrum ( sm ) model @ xcite , which by virtue of the ads / cft coupling @ xcite can be thought of as analogous to the strongly interacting four - dimensional ( 4d ) cft . with the d - branes acting on the boundary of the compact extra dimension , the ads @ xmath8 model has an effectivechoice of , , , means that the binding energy at one orbifold lattice point ( the ultra - violet ( ir ) brane ) is much larger than at the other ( the ultra - violet ( ir ) brane ) , @ xmath9 . in the rs , the string theory problem is easily solved by quantum gauge - shifting . there are several proposals for building blocks of electroweak symmetry breaking in ads @ xmath8 . the main building blocks for the construction of a string theory are , among others , the existence of the gauge gauge group , the two - dimensional standard model , and the various methods for generating the higgs field on ( or in ) the same brane . although in the original rs , the matter fields were constrained to reside on the grain , and the gauge group was constrained to sm @ xmath10 , it was later realized that allowing sm @ xcite and the fields @ xcite to reside in the ads @ xmath8 framework not only admits many higher - order interactions caused only by interactions of @ xmath11 , but also allows a direct transformation of the internal structure of the grain @ xcite via gauge interactions @ xcite . this method of generating the##rmion ##ism also provides a high level of stability of the flavor - changing bound states ( fcncs ) @ xcite , a mechanism referred to as the rs - gim mechanism @ xcite . the solution to the @ xmath1 problem can be obtained in an explicit way by extending the local hypercharge parameter to @ xmath12 and extending it to @ xmath13 and the neutral brane @ xcite . the explicit incorporation of the p - state parameter ##e into the standard model mechanism also provides the opportunity to extend the cp - based mechanism to the @ xmath14 system @ xcite and its flavor - changing neighbor @ xcite . as a result , the high electroweak energy and cp - based fcnc ##s are fully sufficient for the generation of the neutral kaluza - k ( kk ) - state within a few tev . however , in terms of the rs - gim mechanism , cp - based effects in the neutral neutral state @ xcite and due to the local local magnetic field @ xcite appear to be quite large in comparison with classical effects , pushing the particle - physics limit to at least 1 tev andthus extending the reach of the cern large scale cluster ( lhc ) . reaching the halfway point seems to require an exact symmetry breaking of the states and has required a lot of model - building work . the goal of this work is to provide a complete understanding of the interaction of the rs model with the spontaneous decay @ xmath15 at the core , where @ xmath3 connects the two @ xmath16 vertices and is responsible for the breaking of the @ xmath14 symmetry . whereas in the previous work on the full rs model the contributions of the bulk field to the higgs field are treated as a whole , we can obtain the exact solutions to the einstein equations of state ( eoms ) and to the boundary conditions ( bcs ) . in that way we obtain exact solutions for the positions and energies of the individual @ ##es and their kk components . this approach is not only more efficient but also has many advantages than the perturbative approach . in particular , it enables the exact understanding of the properties of the @ xmath17 , including those resulting from the breaking of the @ xmath3 symmetry by the bcs and by the bulk fields . the exact nature ofthe general results in terms of ( non ) local states of symmetry breaking are clearly evident in our paper , and this is not surprising if the contribution of the matter fields to the higgs field is seen as a whole from the very beginning . the general discussion then extends to studying the interactions of matter in three dimensions in a completely new way , making the question of the local nature of the matter fields clear . in particular , it is possible to ask questions about the gauge - theory of the local matter - and higgs - matter interactions with the local fields . in addition , our paper presents the properties of the first three dimensions on a very general basis , both at the quantum mechanical and phenomenological levels . in a later paper we will apply the same results to tree - based tree - based @ xmath18 and @ xmath19 theories in the quantum sector . this paper is structured as follows . for some additional information and details , we discuss in the [ 2 : 1 ] the kk theory of the local matter fields in the case of the brane - type higgs field , as in the simple @ xmath20 theory . we also discuss how to compute it .kk ##z of gauge theories in vector space . the main result for this theory is presented in section [ sec : coupling ] . much attention is given to the exact nature of the theory of @ xmath21 - particle coupling ##s . in sections [ sec : custodialprotection ] and [ sec : higgscouplings ] we present the main results of our work . we first examine the properties of gauge - like interactions with the matter and then examine the contribution of the higgs interactions to them . in the first case , we give two sections that show , on one hand , the mechanism for obtaining the gauge properties of the left - handed @ xmath2 - particle interactions and , on the other , which are the interactions that can permit detection . in addition , we show also that no such mechanism is necessary in the non - gauge case . in the second case , the direct effect on the physics of the gauge properties of the higgs - like interactions is pointed out . in our section we focus on the gauge contributions to the observables of matter , the relative properties of brane - like particles ##s @xcite . although the other terms are not suppressed , it is reasonable to assume that these terms are not suppressed , and that they can be reduced to second order . the most important phenomenological aspects of our model are described in the [ ref : pheno ] . we start by considering the constraints imposed by the precision ##s of the bottom - up - observables , and the scale - based methods that determine them . we then examine the behavior of the particle model in the @ rs model and compare it to the behavior of the standard model . finally , we consider the local variations of the higgs production cross section and branching fraction in the lhc , and the first - order scale changes expected from the @ electroweak m - theory and other models . in a series of experiments we give information about the properties of the @ bcs and higgs - like fcncs , the derivation of the @ xmath21 - even and - odd gauge theories , our input values for the precision ##c , and the input values for the scale factors used to determine the production cross section and the branching fraction of the higgs model in the rs model . we start with the non - standard##izable . ##t @ xmath22 where @ xmath23 is the metric on the 4d hyper - sphere of size @ xmath24 with curvature @ xmath25 . the extra dimension is the @ xmath26 orbifold of [ @ xmath27 represented by @ xmath28 $ ] . the extra dimension has orbifold lattice ##s , @ xmath29 ( the ir brane ) and @ xmath30 ( the ir brane ) . since the product of the scale factor and the curvature , @ xmath31 , corresponds to the fundamental energy scale of the 4d sphere , the gauge coupling ##s can be described by an arbitrary choice of the product @ xmath32 . in order to define the difference between the electroweak scale , @ xmath33 , and the corresponding energy scale , @ xmath34 , one needs to define @ xmath35 . we can therefore refer to @ xmath36 as the ` ` k ' ' of the extra dimension . the product @ xmath37 also allows the energy scale for the low - energy kk states of the gauge theory to be of order of the ` ` kk ' ' '@ xmath38 for example , the coordinates of the first kk particle and photon are 1 @ xmath39 . it would therefore be useful to use the notation @ xmath40 , which means @ xmath41 on the dark brane and 1 on the visible brane @ xcite . coordinates over the orbifold are then calculated using the coordinate system @ xmath42 we now need several experiments and calculations in order to complete our work . in this section we study the kk theory and the gauge theory and obtain new results for the gauge theory , including the existence of an extra brane - like higgs field . in the later version of the theory ##t with slight corrections , the contributions of the higgs field to the field were treated as a whole , reducing the uncertainty to that of @ xmath43 . this led to the possibility of using one - dimensional models which had to be modified , yielding only one ( or a few ) kk solutions . while such an approach should in theory lead to accurate results @ xcite , it is necessary to change the set - up on the basis of the eigenstates , thus obtaining accurate results @ xcite .however , we should note that the sum of the original kk theory contains large contributions , which are removed by solving @ xcite . since the sum can be written in this form , it is possible to start with the original theory and to write the final result in terms of @ xmath43 . thus in this case one can easily distinguish between bonding and subleading modes . alternatively one could use 5 - dimensional ( 5d ) space @ xcite , which would be equivalent to our calculation . an explicit description of the perturbative result for elements of the bonding mode can be found in @ xcite . we use the same theory with weak symmetry , found in @ xcite , with the weak coupling of @ xmath44 . on the r brane , the symmetry - breaking of @ xmath45 breaks a local symmetry , which is the @ xmath1 theory . the weak @ xmath3 symmetry prevents the left - handed @ xmath46 theory from making any large contributions @ xcite . on the ir brane , the symmetry breaking @ xmath47 breaks the local gauge symmetry . the symmetry breaking due to @ xmath48 is due tothe existence of - and - bcs and will become clear later on . the 5d metric of the outer shell takes the form @ xmath49 with the gauge - kinetic term @ xmath50 where @ xmath51 is the 5d metric . since this is not necessary for our calculations , we use the faddeev - popov lagrangian . the higgs lagrangian @ xmath52 is unique to the ir brane . a detailed description of how to work with @ xmath53 has already been given by @ xcite and we apply the same method to @ [ symbol : fermkk ] . the gauge - kinetic lagrangian , @ xmath54 , will be presented in the next section . we expect the wave - function components of the gauge field to be even with the @ xmath21 term , while the gauge components ##s are odd , in order to arrive at a high - dimensional metric that is even with it . the higgs gauge - field , used for mapping @ xmath55 to the wave vector @ xmath56 of the ir brane , maps to @ xmath57 and thus to @ xmath58 where@ xmath59 are the vector fields , @ xmath60 , and @ xmath61 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs sector . @ xmath62 transformations act from the left of the z - axis , and the @ xmath63 transformations act from the right . the second derivative of the higgs sector replaces @ xmath64 with @ xmath65 . the equivalent transformation corresponds to @ xmath66 \ \ [ - [ z ] & \ text { z } + \ text { \ non - \ { z } \ , , \ nonumber \ text { z } \ ] ] where we have : @ xmath67 the choice of ( [ q : cohigg ] ) allows us to define the vector fields @ xcite @ xmath68 which correspond to the full rotation of . we also define the 4d vector field @ xmath69 . the fields are identical to the vector fields of the @ xmath2 electron and proton sectors of the sphere , which are themselves orthogonal to ( [ q : za ] ) . here , the metric tensor takes the form@ xmath70 and breaking the symmetry of @ xmath71 , gives the higgs vev @ xmath72 . the bcs is the neutral electroweak gauge group up to the weak coupling group on the outer . @ xmath73 therefore , this is done by introducing the vector field @ xmath74 and the dirichlet bcs to @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 on the outer brane . the @ xmath13 hypercharge ##s is related to the @ xmath77 ##3 . @ xmath78 the string - like neutral electroweak gauge groups are related in the same way as @ xmath79 it follows that the symmetry of the string and that of the anti - null field , @ xmath80 agree with the description in the paper . therefore , the fields @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 can be related to the vector field @ xmath83 and vector field @ xmath84 via @ xmath85 where @ xmath86 and we have @ xmath87 , where it is a linear combination of @ xmat##h88 and @ xmath89 , which are equivalent to @ xmath84 . we can see here . @ xmath90 ##0 # [ tab : bcs ] we use the bcs that we calculated for the model in order to get the corresponding mass values for the different gauge states . they are expressed in terms of fields with background bcs on the two different branes . in the figure we will refer to these types of fields in the uv and ground states , respectively . the result is illustrated in # [ tab : physics ] , where we will describe the symmetry - breaking interactions at the two branes . the bcs can also be converted to standard form at the expense of mathematical models that use other variables . the model @ xmath91 has background and background - independent uv bcs on both branes , and only the ground state is massless . note that there is only one additional parameter @ xmath92 in the uv bcs , in contrast to the two parameters @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 appearing in the standard model . in the standard model , the same calculations for the different electroweak gauge ##s are done in the uv bcbcs of the gauge is in the ir basis ( ( ( [ sec : sp ] ) . ) . the fact that there is only one invariant wave vector is important for the effective value of the @ xmath1 model . we will elaborate on this below : [ sec : mwmzstu ] . ( 0 , 0 ) ( 0 , 0 ) ( - 285 , - 7 . 5 ) ( - 330 , 170 ) ( - 282 . 5 , 45 ) ( - 292 . 5 , 45 ) ( - 285 , - 7 . 5 ) ( - 330 , 170 ) ( - 108 . 5 , 45 ) ( - 117 . 5 , 45 ) [ sec : 1 ] the structure of the gauge theory involves the ##s of gauge fields and operators , which can be represented by an explicit gauge - invariant lagrangian . since the higgs field is related to the null brane , it is necessary to be in the ir basis for that matter . for this reason , we consider the 5d model in the ir basis . the general ##ization of the gauge theory can be found below : ( [ sec : sgf ] ) . after considering the kk model , we consider the relations for the gauge (right ) and # ##l ( left ) . they are @ xmath95 \ left ( \ begin { array } { c } \ sin l _ m ^ \ pm \ \ r _ m ^ \ pm \ begin { array } \ right ) & = \ right ( \ begin { array } { c } \ sin \ theta _ w & -

dimensional matrices @ xmath110 , with @ xmath111 , representing the product of the two gauge fields and their kk components . these matrices are defined according to @ xmath112 so that the matrix @ xmath113 should in fact also have the notation @ xmath114 , indicating the group to which it belongs , but we need not do this , as the gauge group should be already known from the data . the matrices @ xmath115 and @ xmath116 indicate the type of field we have on the matrix of the uv brane , _ i . e . _ , they are smooth and weak gauge fields - respectively , which have dirichlet statistics at the uv brane and are therefore not smooth at this orbifold boundary point . these matrices are also called odd , because they behave like an odd matrix if one simply takes all of the orbifold. the correlation ##s correspond to the fields with [ vector bcs . ] on the orbifold . note from the [ vector : bcs ] that these fields have a vector field on the frame , , which we need not state only using the notation @ xmath115 to avoid the confusion of notation . let us instead use the corresponding vector @ xmath117 for the representation of the neumann field . in contrast to the vector representation of @ xcite , the fields @ xmath118 do not obey standard orthonormality conditions . this decomposition is analogous to the decomposition of fields with neumann and dirichlet bcs into the corresponding 4d gauge - fixing field . the correlation ##s @ xmath119 with @ xmath120 are also orthonormal for the frame , @ xmath121 assuming also that the field has the standard orthonormality condition . we can write the 4d gauge field in the form of the eigenstates @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 by : @ xcite @ xmath124 using the method described in this article , the gauge -

profile by an integer factor into the vector @ xcite . we can denote this integer factor by a dot in the middle of the word , _ e . g . _ , _ = @ xmath135 . the corresponding vector bcs for the photon can be obtained by integrating the eoms ( [ tab : gaugeeom ] ) over an arbitrary region of @ xmath136 . for the 5d level they have already been described in the [ tab : bcs ] . however , since the derivatives of the vector components are assumed to be equal to the @ xmath24 - derivatives of the vector components , they appear only on the quantum brane @ xcite . we start with @ xmath137 where @ xmath138 means that for the photon the right - hand side condition ( [ tab : irbc2 ] ) is equal to 0 . by integrating the eoms and the orthonormality condition ( [ tab : ortho ] ) , we find that the 4d level has the following canonical form , if @ xmat##h139 the value of the uv is determined by the parameter bcs ( [ e : irbc2 ] ) . the profiles @ xmath140 are the values of @ xmath141 = [ \ , , \ ] ] with @ xmath142 after the parameters are determined , the eigenvectors @ xmath143 are determined by ( [ e : irbc2 ] ) . we now have equations for the parameters @ xmath144 . in order to obtain the eoms for the parameters ##e we replace ( [ e : gaugeeom ] ) by @ xmath145 from the equation . using the parameter @ xmath146 , we can write the equation : @ xcite @ xmath147 with @ xmath148 c _ n ^ { ( -

free state . in this section we will show how to calculate the weighted sum of gauge - invariant masses @ xmath176 multiplied by the sum of the two kk - modes @ xmath177 , @ xmath178 which occurs when one happens to observe the two - dimensional state of the standard electroweak theory , described by the kk modes in the presence of zero ( or negligibly low ) energy levels . the binding energy of ( [ sec : kksum1 ] ) can be calculated by applying the method used for @ xcite . we then run the eoms ( [ sec : gaugeeom ] ) method , looking for the bcs in both the sm and sm brane . by applying to @ xmath171 , this gives @ xmath179 \! { \ , p } _ { ( + ) } \ , \ frac { \ vec { \ , } _ n ^ { \ , \ } ( \ big ) } { \ , ( ) _ n ^ { \ , ) ^ 2 } \ , , \ ] ] where we have : @ xmath180 using the definition of @ xmath181 for the n - dimensional case , it is now possible to show that @ xmath182 where @ xmath183 . with these results in mind it is now a matter of some further analysis to arrive at @ xmath184 \ \ [ ( + ] & \ delta { 1 } + \ , [ \ , \ delta { 1 } -

\( ^ 2 \ , ) { \ cal p } _ { \ , \ , ] ^ [ , \ end { split } \ ] ] which is applicable to all values of @ xmath185 . with the use of the orthonormality relation ( [ ex : ortho ] ) , the two terms in the ##s looking at the resulting brane can be transformed into the [ @ xmath186 \ , \ bigg ] ^ { - 1 } { \ cal p } _ { ( + ) } \ , , \ end { split } \ ] ] where @ xmath187 is the @ xmath188 order of the corresponding d - dimensional gauge . this formula has the advantage that it can be also expressed in terms of @ xmath43 ##0 ( [ ex : expprof ] ) and ( [ ex : veca0a ] ) . adding the last two terms to the formula leads to @ xmath189 + { \ cal p } ( ( _ a ^ 2 ) \ , ) { \ cal p } _ { ( + ) } \ , . \ ] ] keeping in mind that @ xmath190 and @ pheno##menologically solving equations of first order for @ xmath191 , we will arrive at @ xmath192 + \ , [ \ frac { 1 } { 2 \ pi x _ a ^ 2 } + \ frac { 1 } { 4 \ pi } \ left ( 1 - \ frac { 1 } { 1 ##l } \ , ) \ , ] { \ , \ } _ { ( + ) } + { \ cal ##c } ( x _ a ^ 2 ) \ , , \ ] ] where @ xmath193 provides at least one explicit expression for the two - variable solution to ( [ x : kksum1 ] ) . , @ xmath194 will also prove useful results in our calculations . using the equations ( [ x : expprof ] ) and ( [ x : veca0a ] ) , a simple calculation leads to @ xmath195 \ \ [ 1 ##x ] & \ , { 1 } + \ , [ \ , \ frac { 1 } { 2 \ pi x _ a ^ 2 } + \ frac { 1 } { 4 \ pi } \ right ( 1 -

64 terms in @ xmath196 except the terms proportional to the s - factorizable term @ xmath197 come from the s - mode term @ xmath198 . factorizable terms proportional to the s - modes @ xmath153 and @ xmath2 respectively are then given by the value of the coupling factor with respect to the contribution from the sum of kk and @ xcite . we also note that the term @ xmath197 from the - 5dinstead of the matrix ##c , which is possible when one has only a few low - energy kk modes @ xcite . our experimental results for @ xmath199 and @ xmath200 ##0 turn out to be phenomenologically very useful , as they allow for a better understanding of the nature of the effects in @ xmath18 and @ xmath19 fcnc ##s . in particular , the general form of the term @ xmath201 and its relations with the terms corresponding to the @ xmath202 and of @ xmath203 are important tools for the theoretical understanding of the flavor - violating @ xmath14 coupling as well as of the flavor - violating @ xmath204 coupling . we will for the moment no longer focus on this problem , but will refer to it in detail in section [ 2 : custodialprotection ] . before moving on , let us note that the kk modes for electron and photon interactions do not depend on whether the electroweak symmetry group is broken or not , and that the calculations for the above calculations ( including the transition energies ) can be done directly from @ xcite . we will also considerthe quantum representation of the local field of the field under consideration . then we can return to the kk representation and compute the quantum structure for the local field . if we want to provide a strong representation of the @ xmath205 and @ xcite , we need an odd @ xmath3 symmetry that separates the odd @ xmath16 fields . as a result , the left - handed local field happens to be part of the @ xmath206 pseudo - field with isospin quantum number @ xmath207 ( see also [ see : custodialprotection ] ) . this relates the quantum numbers of the corresponding fields , and gives the quantum multiplet representation for the corresponding fields with odd @ xmath21 symmetry : @ xmath208 { \ cal t } _ 1 & \ equiv { \ cal t } _ { 1r } \ oplus { \ cal t } _ { 2r } \ equiv \ , ( \ text { 1 } { 1 } { \ lambda _ r ^ { \ prime \ , ( -

quality description of the field that was consistent with it . the spectra corresponding to the @ xmath48 and @ x##math209 representations , respectively , which are replaced by the operators @ xmath210 and @ xmath211 . for current and future applications , we present the quantum states of the two generations in figure [ 1 : 1 ] . the left - handed up - type representations need to be combined in the @ xmath63 representation in order to arrive at an @ xmath209 - invariant sm representation . note that we have chosen the same @ xmath55 representations for all three generations , which is important if one wants to successfully use gauge theories in the grand unified approach to physics in the three dimensions . the sm representations also play a crucial role in the construction of flavour - invariant left - handed @ xmath2 - invariant representations @ xcite . here they represent 15 different gauge theories in the up - type and nine in the down - type sector . according to the bcs , there will be five new particles in each sector to be associated with the new representation . these are connected by kk representations which consist of representations of five and nine particles of different energy in the up - and down - type sector ##s , respectively . here they areconsider the kk group of the elementary particles of high energy @ xmath212 , which has three levels with a small difference between each level . in addition to ( [ see : multiplets ] ) we have a second group of multiplets , corresponding to the group of the chirality . the three components have a bcs . in fact , they all have dirichlet bcs on the same brane . note that the @ xmath62 transformations act vertically , while the @ xmath63 transformations act horizontally on the multiplets . [ id = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , id = " ^ " , ] similar to two - particle production , higgs - particle production and quantum field - theory production , @ xmath213 with @ xmath214 , which is expected to be highly efficient for experiments in the lhc , has a yield reduction of the @ xmath215 ( @ xmath216 ) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath218 ) . the same reduction will yield the @ xmath153 - particle production , @ xmath21##9 , which is the only one that the theory would allow for a higgs interaction at the tevatron . the rs predictions for the experimental cross sections for @ xmath220 at the tevatron and for @ xmath221 at the lhc are illustrated by the horizontal black lines on the left and right sides of the [ r : prodplots ] , respectively . the corresponding sm models were derived from @ xcite and illustrated by the same horizontal lines . however , the cross section of the left - right model produced , @ xmath222 , will not show rs suppression . for measurements of the kk ##v in the frame of @ xmath223 , this prediction will apply only to @ xmath224 . since @ xmath225 , @ xmath226 , and @ xmath227 are s - like models , their sm predictions have only been confirmed by a simple analysis of the corresponding sm models . in particular , we note that the two higgs - proton interaction modes at the origin are predicted by the standard standard model applicable to the universe . the modes of @ xmath228 are not predicted in @ xcite. a more direct comparison with our model is still not possible , since @ xcite only studied low - mass particles , whereas @ xcite studied the ##s that arise from the heavy bottom - up model above . for @ xcite the authors propose extensions to proton - proton interactions arising from the confinement of the fermionic kk . . . it has been shown that for a heavy bottom - up model with a symmetry @ xmath229 of a few hundred gev the higgs - proton interaction cross section via @ xmath228 would be greatly reduced . we would like to point out in this paper that in order to achieve @ xmath230 with the number of particles carefully controlled , ( [ see : multiplets ] ) , the @ xmath3 symmetry needs to be modified , via the local energy distribution of the @ xmath231 multiplets by moving @ xmath232 as far away from @ xmath233 . as for @ xmath234 it is possible to achieve @ xmath235 and with an extension of the @ xmath236 cross section , the combinations of symmetry need to be fine - tuned to thethe measured mass distribution of the heavy particles for the gauge theory . if , on the other hand , @ xmath237 , we find that @ xmath238 is also positive , and as a result the @ xmath228 channel has spin cancellation . we also find that breaking of @ xmath232 lead to a spontaneous breaking of the @ xmath3 and lead , as an accidental break , to a spontaneous phase transition of the @ xmath14 ##0 channel ( [ deltad2 ] ) , which is surprising in view of the symmetry breaking arising from the @ xmath239 channel observables . to which the electroweak theory can relate the properties of the fermionic kk particles for further study . we will go on to consider the decay ##s of the higgs interactions . in this case , we will consider the interactions with , and decay ##s of the standard model that will have mass distribution , and have a mass number greater than @ xmath240 . since we have not yet measured the masses of the particles in the s frame , we assume splitting into , and ##ons .due to the background radiation of the leptonic particles , we can see that the decay ##s of the higgs into two particles are also gauge - invariant . however , we did not consider the decay of kk ##b in our analysis of the @ xmath241 and @ xmath242 decay ##s . we will focus on the theoretical aspects of this analysis here . in order to be able to relate the decay ##s of the higgs field into two vector fields , we first need to consider the local coupling to the @ xmath243 , @ xmath244 , and @ xmath245 n - body interactions . due to the new @ xmath48 ##8 symmetry , the @ xmath246 interaction remains invariant with respect to the sm to sm interactions in @ xmath43 . the local coupling to the higgs field are different from the weak and strong coupling corresponding to ( [ x : \ ] ) . in this case , the coupling is in the lagrangian [ @ xmath247 , \ ] ] where @ xmath248 + { { \ cal ##c } } \ left ( x _ 0^ { \ } ) , \ begin { \ } \ end { \ } \ ] ] and @ xmath249 for @ xmath214 . in the case of the @ xmath3 model ( [ plr ] ) , one has @ xmath250 and @ xmath251 , which means that the coupling term applied to @ xmath252 takes the form @ xmath253 . for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath254 ) these statements lead to the reduction of the @ xmath243 and @ xmath244 terms in the @ xmath255 ( @ xmath256 ) model to the original . note that in the @ x model the terms ( [ see : hbosoncoupl ] ) are in the form @ xmath257 , and that the corrections to the coupling of the higgs to other gauge theories are reduced by about a factor of two . our assumption that the terms @ xmath243 and @ xmath244 are a reduction from their initial value from the model - checking table contained in @ xcite . the exact solution of @ xmath##258 of the higgs particles decay to a single state @ xmath259 is also obtained by dividing the sum by ##s . we replace @ xmath260 with @ xmath261 in the calculations of the decay of the higgs particles into a pair of @ xmath153 and @ xmath2 particles , respectively . the same @ xmath262 corrections for decay into two states , middle and bottom , have also been obtained by ( [ fig : kappagg ] ) and ( [ tbratios ] ) . in the [ fig : hprodec ] the results of the decay into a pair of bottom particles and two top particles are shown on the right in the first figure . apart from the effects in the @ xmath263 coupling , we have effects due to the two - body decay @ xmath264 , which due to the two - body decay @ xmath265 lead to a change of ( just over ) 50 % of the energy . despite the importance of this result , the lack of the standard - model effects in the @ xmath266 coupling that would explain the@ xmath267 in is for all practical purposes empty . in the case of the standard model with n particles , we have @ xmath268 in ( [ fig : gammahtof ] ) , where @ xmath269 , @ xmath270 , @ xmath271 , @ xmath272 , @ xmath273 , and the corresponding equations for the scale factor @ xmath274 , including the @ xmath153 - particle contribution , can be found in figure [ app : formfactors ] . the first , second , and third terms of the equation describe the effects of the k - particle , @ xmath153 - particle , and kk - particle interactions , respectively . the corresponding closed - form equations are shown to the right of the bottom plot of figure [ fig : hprodec ] and of the top plot of figure [ fig : hkkcontr ] . the contribution @ xmath275 varies slightly with the particle contribution @ xmath276 , ranging from @ xmath277 for @ xmath278 to @ xmath279 for the @ .##math280 approaching @ xmath281 and then approaching @ xmath282 within the limit @ xmath283 . comparing these results with the results for @ xmath276 mentioned above , one finds that within the limit the @ xmath153 - 1 contribution to the @ xmath284 amplitude , is always well above 1 . we note that the ( [ kappagamma ] ) contributions from leptonic kk loops are not excluded . since the relative magnitude of these contributions depends on the particular sector of the particular loop ( which we have already observed ) , it is possible to determine their relative direction as well as even their magnitude . extending the definition ( [ kappagamma ] ) to include contributions from the sector with kk loops , and to include the limit @ xmath285 where @ xmath286 and the replacement @ xmath287 are the effects due to kk - like loops . under the general assumption that @ xmath288 , we conclude from ( [ kkleptonsinkappaa ] ) that the kk loop contributing to the @ xmath289 amplitude amounts to the @ xmath29##0 of the kk causes confusion and works best with the sum . based on this , we see that the inclusion of kk and ##s in the calculation of @ xmath291 has only a small negative effect on the resulting higgs - like continued fraction . the sum @ xmath292 and the one - sided sum of the @ xmath153 - 4 kk sums can be calculated together in the above method . the inverse fourier transform is shown in the top right of figure [ fig : hkkcontr ] . using the formula for the kk sum given in figure [ fig : kksum ] , we calculate @ xmath293 \ hspace { 1 . 0 } } \ vec { 8 } _ 0 \ , \ , ( - \ frac { 4 } { 4 } + { \ cal o } \ left ( 1 / \ tau _ n ^ w \ right ) \ , ) \ \ & = - \ , \ frac { 4 } ) \ , \ , tau _ n ^ w \ , ( - + { \ cal o } \ left ( 1 / \ tau _ n ^ w \ right ) \ ,) , \ { { \ } \ ] ] where @ xmath294 and @ xmath295 . since for @ xmath296 , the effects produced by use of @ xmath297 in ( [ fig : nugammaw ] ) can be measured in time . the results for @ xmath298 can be found in ( [ fig : hbosoncoupl ] ) . in order to find the actual sm decay channel , for @ xmath299 , we use @ xmath300 in ( [ fig : gammahtof ] ) . for @ xmath301 , and @ xmath302 for @ xmath303 . the results @ xmath304 of the decay of the particles and @ xmath153 produced by @ xmath242 are described in appendix [ app : formfactors ] . the corresponding differential equations are shown on the right in the first section of appendix [ app : hprodec ] . as in the case of @ xmath289 , the sm decay channel for @ xmath299 is just the part of the state space generated by the @xmath153 - 1 - 1 . it has @ xmath305 for @ xmath306 and @ xmath307 for @ xmath308 . on the other hand , the term @ xmath309 goes from around @ xmath310 to @ xmath311 , @ xmath312 and @ xmath281 , and finally falls to around @ xmath313 in the case @ xmath283 . the second term in the equation of ( [ kappagammaz ] ) depends on the parameters @ xmath314 which determine the relative strength of the vector coupling of the @ xmath2 particle to top and bottom indices . on the right side of the [ source : vectorzplot ] we see the results for @ xmath315 versus @ xmath316 for the randomly generated interaction model sm . it is clear from the results that the vector coupling of the @ xmath2 particle to the ##ons is slightly suppressed in the weak interaction model due to the background . thus , the result corresponds to a slow decay of @ xmath256( @ xmath317 ) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath318 ) . in general , the @ xmath2 - 1 coupling to bottom - up theory is greater than the sm value , and therefore the coupling ##s turn out to be negligibly strong compared to the weak coupling ##s . therefore , we can reduce @ xmath319 to 1 using our above formula . parameterizing the sm value of the phase transformation @ xmath320 to @ xmath321 the transformation @ xmath322 can then be calculated using a formula . using the same set of data points , we obtain the coefficients for @ xmath322 shown in table [ 1 : 2 ] . the last term in the sequence of ( [ kappagammaz ] ) is the solution to the @ xmath242 equation resulting from the @ xmath153 - 1 coupling inequality . the calculation of this two - dimensional transformation is further simplified by the following two equations . first , one considers @ xmath323 and then @ xmath324 ^ 2 = { \ cal ##c } ( c ^ 2 / \ mkk ^( ) $ ] . the expressions for @ xmath325 and @ xmath326 used to derive these relations can be found in ( [ q : expprof ] ) and ( [ q : veca0a ] ) . in general these two expressions imply that the triple gauge - field coupling of two @ xmath153 - and two @ xmath2 - like states will not change strength in @ xmath327 from the # ##a , because of the corresponding gauge symmetry . following the same line of reasoning , it is now also apparent that all the n - dimensional terms will vanish at 0 @ xmath328 from the corresponding sm values . in spite of this slight difference , we can relate the triple gauge - field coupling of the two states to their sm values when considering the higgs - like power law . in this case the effect of the @ xmath153 - field coupling to ( [ kappagammaz ] ) is now given by the term @ xmath329 , which according to the above calculations closely resembles the effect of the second term to ( [ kappagamma ] ) . the second term is the numer##ator of ( [ kappagammaz ] ) describes the coupling to the @ xmath242 mode resulting from the real exchange of kk modes . the following two - dimensional figure is shown in the middle of figure [ fig : hkkcontr ] . for the up - type up mode we have @ xmath330 where @ xmath331 describes the relative strength of the coupling of the @ xmath2 mode to the @ xmath332 up - type up kk mode , in addition to ( [ fig : kappaiv ] ) , and @ xmath333 . similar results exist in the case of up - and @ xmath334 - type up kk modes . since the numerical evaluation of ( [ fig : nugammazu ] ) turns out to be incorrect , we resort to a numerical evaluation of the kk modes using the formula described in the [ fig : higgsproduction ] . the expressions for the real exchanges of @ xmath335 , @ xmath336 , and @ xmath337 corresponding to the number of the two ##ized data modes are shown on the right side of figure [ fig :vectorzplot ] . the two figures shown below show the approximate values of the coefficients @ xmath338 to the set of points with kk values in the [ @ xmath339 \ , { \ rm tev } $ ] . as such , points with @ xmath340 have been omitted from the table , since they are subject to some second - order corrections . the exact coefficients @ xmath341 can be found in table [ sec : scattering ] . the approximate values of the real parts of @ xmath335 , @ xmath342 , and @ xmath337 calculated from the above data are @ xmath343 ( @ xmath344 ) , @ xmath345 ( @ xmath346 ) , and @ xmath347 ( @ xmath348 ) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath218 ) , respectively . the real part @ xmath349 turned out to be unstable . the reason for this problem has recently been explained in table [ sec : higgsproduction ] . results from kk - dimensional point groups have also recently been published in ( [ kappagamma##z ] ) . dividing these values by @ xmath350 , they can be obtained via the following formula @ xmath351 in order to calculate the expectation value of @ xmath350 we need an explicit expression for the expectation strength of the weak interaction between the @ xmath2 - and fermionic kk modes , in ( [ q : nugammazu ] ) . we obtain @ xmath352 where the result for @ xmath353 can be found in ( [ q : delta2 ] ) . in the case of the @ xmath3 , ( [ q : extendedplr ] ) , it turns out that for down - and @ xmath334 - type kk modes the result for @ xmath354 can be expressed in terms of the electric charge and the total power of the total isospin of the two modes , but no such result can be obtained for down - type and kk modes . we come to an expression ( @ xmath355 ) @ xmath356 which states that for down - and ( @ xmath334 - type ) kk - modes ##scorresponding with the ##ity to the second sector of the @ xmath2 - type model . it follows that in the upper limit , @ xmath357 , one gets @ xmath358 from the sum of the two ##s . in the [ k : s ] , we see that this expression is accurate to an accuracy of for @ xmath359 . the kk - t interactions between the down - and @ xmath334 - type two ##s that correspond to @ xmath360 , and @ xmath361 are almost identical , in the sense that they can be easily distinguished from each other by the exact nature of the vector coupling of the two sectors . using also the general fact that in the limit , the terms @ xmath336 and @ xmath362 vanish ##es in the sum of the vector coupling @ xmath363 and @ xmath364 , we get the following expression for the sum to ( [ kkleptonsinkappaaz ] ) from leptonic states to down - and and kk states : @ xmath365 as a result , the sum ( [ kkleptonsin##kappaaz ] ) can be written as @ xmath366 where the second term on the right - hand side describes the effects due to kk particles , and in order to obtain the numerical result we have taken the corresponding electroweak quantum number and added @ xmath367 . for @ xmath368 , the second term of the expression ( [ kappa : sumlkk ] ) reduces to @ xmath369 ( @ xmath370 ) if effects due to kk particles are included ( 1 ) . all these results show that the absence of kk particles ##s does affect the expected value of the kk - contribution . , it is very difficult to show that the scale factor ( [ kappagammaz ] ) itself is small , since the coefficient @ xmath371 is dominated by the @ xmath153 - k - contribution . we therefore show that the absence of kk - contribution effects in our expression for @ xmath242 ( which is very difficult to obtain in the lhc ) does not affect any of the values given above . the coefficient @ xmath372 = ( [ kappa##gammaz ] ) for the loss of @ xmath242 due to the kk - type loop in the loop . the full loop expression is shown at the top right of ( [ 1 : hkkcontr ] . this expression can be written as @ xmath373 with @ xmath374 } \ , , \ { { 1 } \ ] ] and @ xmath375 . note that the prefactor of the first term of the above expression corresponds to the term @ xmath376 . since the first term of the expression of ( [ 1 : nugammaz ] ) is also obtained by the computation of @ xmath43 , the computation of @ xmath372 to this order also extends the definition of the weak term ( [ 1 : iwwz ] ) to this order , the sum of the terms of the kk field . we compute @ xmath377 which is also an easy way to compute the sum of @ xmath378 to the critical length of @ xmath379 , for which the scale factor is @ xmath380 . we compute the sum of ( [ 1 :nugammaz ] ) ) , for infinitely many kk levels until the process stops . in this case , we get @ xmath381 @ xmath382 for @ xmath383 ( @ xmath384 ) . values for @ xmath372 corresponding to the kk levels can be calculated by means of the fit formula @ xmath385 with the coefficients @ xmath386 collected in table [ tab : fig ] . in the two rows of table [ tab : fig ] we see the corresponding values @ xmath387 , @ xmath388 , and @ xmath389 for @ xmath217 ( left ) and @ xmath390 ( right ) . the resulting results use the previous values obtained from ( [ fig : hbosoncoupl ] ) and ( [ fig : nugammaw ] ) as well as the rs fit formula with the values of the coefficients collected in table [ tab : kappa ] . since the value of @ xmath387 has already been described in table [ fig : higgsproduction ] , we see that @ xmath391 is equivalent to theand because of the dependence of the higgs - mass amplitude . this means that the average decay rate @ xmath392 in the standard standard model is almost constant with respect to the sm . the error of @ xmath388 is , on the other hand , a non - linear function of @ xmath393 . at the @ xmath280 level , the @ xmath153 - h decay , the # @ xmath289 decay , and the decay rates to kk , and @ xmath153 , all interact strongly with the # ##e - h decay inequality . for @ xmath394 , the anti - decay rates increase to around @ xmath395 ( @ xmath396 ) of the total , and for @ xmath368 ( @ xmath397 ) , resulting in around @ xmath398 ( @ xmath399 ) . for @ xmath400 , the higgs - mass dependence of the decay amplitude is zero , and the sm amplitude is almost constant . the exponential decay of @ xmath388 , especially at higher levels of the higgs decay , isfrom the fact that for @ xmath401 the pull - down effect effectively ignores the @ xmath153 - 1 contribution to the decay . in contrast , for @ xmath402 the loop in @ xmath403 is almost completely due to interactions with the kk particles , with the contribution from kk particles being the only exception . the standard higgs - particle branching ratios calculated from the above curves are shown in figure [ fig : hxx ] . the dashed lines show the sm predictions . with the help of hdecay @ xcite , , the main data set of hdecay version 0 . 1 was used . ] . the dashed lines show the sm predictions based on the results for @ xmath404 shown above and the results for @ xmath405 shown in figure [ fig : xx ] . it is clear that in the standard standard model the branching ratios @ xmath406 , @ xmath407 , and @ xmath408 are relatively small corrections , compared to the value of @ xmath409 . for @ xmath410 the single particle predictions for the decay of the higgs .in the lhc , the ` ` ' ' ' corresponds to the particle , @ xmath411 . since the @ xmath408 branching ratio is also non - 1 , the modifications in the @ xmath228 decay line length may make the determination of the higgs mass in the experimental data more difficult . extreme effects occur in the pre - decay modes @ xmath299 and @ xmath412 . in the production section for the higgs mass , the modifications in the branching ratio amount to : @ xmath413 ( @ xmath414 ) and @ xmath415 ( @ xmath255 ) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath218 ) . the most extreme effects are observed for @ xmath416 and @ xmath289 . for higgs mass in the @ xmath280 limit , the branching ratio of the former mode is reduced by a factor of around 8 ( 8 ) , while the branching ratio of the latter mode is reduced by a factor of around 2 ( 2 ) . the two extreme effects of @ xmath417 and @ xmath418 ( @ xmath41##9 ) for @ xmath217 ( @ xmath254 ) and again for @ xmath420 . using the value of @ xmath421 for @ xmath422 and the corresponding maximum branching ratio , we get the result @ xmath423 ( @ xmath424 ) . these results show that the statistical significance for the lhc detection of the higgs particle by @ xmath289 can be determined using the standard ##ised method for the kk scales . a detailed explanation of how the parameters observed in the # ##a affect the detection for the higgs particle in the lhc should be available soon . we find that if the kk scale is equal to @ xmath425 , the branching ratio of @ xmath426 will be well below @ xmath240 for higgs and above @ xmath427 . , the maximal branching ratio is then obtained from ( [ brthc ] ) by calculating the branching ratio for @ xmath428 with @ xmath429 and from @ xmath430 with @ xmath431 . of course , the same result applies tothe scale of @ xmath432 . ] for such a large kk scale , then the rs model @ xmath433 will close up at the @ xmath280 scale , but it opens at the scale of @ xmath434 . note that our predictions for the higgs - particle branching fraction are always at the scale of the kk scale , and are very similar to the rs model usually used in the model . for example , the rs results do not necessarily depend on the local gauge properties of the fermionic r particles . we have shown that the effect of kk - r interactions does not have a causal effect . our predictions for the particle branching fraction of the higgs field have been made explicit in @ xcite . even a direct comparison with our results is difficult , since the rs model only includes the effects for the tree - level effects of the higgs field to r . we have done a detailed analysis of the effects of tree - level effects in the rs model with a gauge - theory @ xmath0 and an extended brane - like higgs field . in contrast to the previous analysis , where the rs results are .when used as a tool , we have solved the kk decomposition of the sm field in powers of @ xmath20 ##5 on the basis of the eigenstates , thereby obtaining the exact solutions to the gauge equations of motion , with appropriate boundary conditions . the kk decomposition of the weak sector has been solved using the same techniques and for the analysis of fermionic interactions of different energies and generations in a more general way . by expanding the energy spectrum , we have obtained simple analytical expressions for the energies and masses of the individual sm particles as well as for the interactions between kk groups of gauge particles , which include all but up to one term in the conversion of the higgs vacuum mass value @ xmath435 to the kk mass value @ xmath316 . we have shown that our general method is not only quite accurate , but also has two important advantages in calculating the contributions of the sm particles to the higgs field perturbatively . by expanding the high - energy spectrum as well as the weak sector in powers of @ xmath43 , we have obtained analytical expressions which allow not only for a general solution , but for a comprehensive and complete analysis of the gauge - weak interactionsboth of the peskin - takeuchi ##d @ xmath1 and the left - handed @ xmath2 - odd interactions are p - type interactions . in the case of the gauge - coupling breaking to the @ xmath436 symmetry , we have ruled out the mechanisms that provided the symmetry breaking and replaced them with the classical mechanisms of @ xmath3 - odd breaking , resulting from the same boundary conditions of free and bound gauge - field interactions in the same brane . working in the perturbative approach , which in turn involves solving high - dimensional problems directly , the significance of our results to particle physics is now made clear . by making the constraints on the size of the local coupling explicit , we are also able to answer the fundamental question of the mass - dependence of the local gauge - field interactions with the ##es . we have shown in this way , that the @ xmath3 symmetry is only broken by the local coupling ##s of the @ xmath21 - and @ xmath62 gauge ##s if their energies differ from the energies of their @ xmath21 - odd counterparts . turning our attention to the high - dimensionalhowever , we have also shown that a similar protection is unlikely to occur in this case . we have also addressed the issue of the non - existence of the two - way coupling and weak protection , extending our understanding of the mechanism of the flavor - invariant higgs - string interaction to the case of the minimal case with weak protection . here we have demonstrated the practical implications of our theoretical results . a further examination of the limits imposed by the precision measurements of the bottom - symmetry string observables opens our phenomenological eyes . we note that , compared to the minimal case , the requirement for the coupling to the @ xmath205 vertex in the minimal case with the @ xmath3 protection is completely independent of the right - handed bulk mass parameter of the first - generation model . this also removes the constraints that emerge from the precision measurements of the left - handed @ xmath2 - * * ##s , giving us sufficient constraints to protect the same string from a tight coupling of the bottom symmetry . we have also found out that , irrespectively of the underlying symmetry , and with an extremely high value of the bulk mass parameterof the right - handed bottom particles , the attempt to find the correct top - and bottom - hole ##s requires significant corrections to the @ xmath437 coupling . the direct measurement of the coupling - the forward - backward coupling for particles - is more easily possible in the three - dimensional model in which the right - handed bottom and top particles are part of the same multiplet . searching for a heavy higgs particle with a mass on the order of 1 . 5 tev ( which is the lowest possible mass value for @ xmath393 in models with a brane - like higgs field ) leads us to a good agreement between @ xmath438 coupling and coupling . however , the heavy higgs particles would require correction in combination with weak coupling , since the variations observed in @ xmath439 in the models @ xmath165 and @ xmath1 could not be explained by the ##t - wave coupling , and this would require the use of large closed loop interactions in order not to achieve the correct electroweak coupling . the theoretical analysis of the quantum - mechanical results show the bottom - hole interactions as well because of the variation in the spinthis section and branching fraction of the higgs interactions informed our phenomenological analysis . in the latter case , we found that due to the existence of the @ xmath14 sector , the best results for both @ xmath440 and @ xmath441 are more likely in the limit than in the # ##ized sector . in contrast , for kk anti - particle interactions in @ xmath442 the branching fraction of both @ xmath443 and @ xmath428 would be in the limits of the lhc . in the latter case , our analysis shows that due to the interacting nature of the higgs particle , the top particle , and the kk particle , these effects in higgs physics can only occur in the sector under study . in order to arrive at this conclusion , we have performed the first complete closed - form analysis of the higgs - particle interactions and # ##s associated to the sector , incorparating the effects arising from the main electroweak # ##s and their interactions . for the two higgs - particle interaction interactions between the tevatron and the lhc , going to @ xmath228 ,@ xmath220 , and @ xmath221 , we note that they are significantly reduced in the standard rs framework compared to the rs . since the reduction of the production cross section can affect the relevant experimental and theoretical parameters , the increase in higgs particles produced in the rs framework should be significant in the lhc . on the other hand , the reduced @ xmath228 production cross section should make the discovery of the higgs particle with a mass above the @ xmath444 threshold via the ` ` s ' ' multi - particle model more likely , because the @ xmath408 branching fraction is reduced , - 1 in the standard rs model . the significant reduction of the branching fraction for @ xmath289 could also lead to a higher statistical significance and a possible lhc discovery of the higgs particle , if its mass is above the @ xmath280 threshold . we note that our results in higgs physics need to be more detailed ##ly , since they depend only partially on the quality of the data ( and not the standard model being used ) . the details of the two kk models have been discussed . the experimental and theoretical models presented in this articleis the basis for the study of flavor - changing interactions in the @ x model . a detailed phenomenological analysis of the general particle - like properties of spin - neutral interactions and the beta decay of the and @ xmath445 particles , and their related and related interactions , is available for future reference . it is our pleasure to thank a . azatov , a . toharia , and y . zhu for our discussions of flavor -
