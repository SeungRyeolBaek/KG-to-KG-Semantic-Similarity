it is well known that the high magnetoresistance ( mr ) of metals and alloys with a narrow - band electron surface increases quadratically with the magnetic field @ xmath2 for @ xmath3 and decreases when @ xmath4 . thus @ xmath5 has the high - magnetic - moment property . however , the unexpected long and linear mr ( lmr ) , which follows this simple model , has been attracting much attention as recently as its discovery . in the last decade , this unusual lmr has been observed in potassium chalcogenide , @ xcite potassium antimonide , @ xcite gold , @ xcite mnas - gaas , ##s , @ xcite and graphene . @ xcite kapitza the long mr @ xcite shows that the metal has a magnetoresistance proportional to the magnetic field when it has an open electron surface and a mean free path larger than the electron larmor radius . recently , another two models , both of the open electron surface , have been proposed to provide possible explanations for the lmr phenomenon . abrikosov proposed a lower - dimensional model of lmr for the homogen##ous , with a gapless surface energy gap . @ xcite his model assumes that landau bands are not present and the electron density so small that the electrons occupy only the lowest landau band . however , smith and littlewood proposed a similar model without studying the molecules . @ xcite using the same experimental data , they attributed this low density to the processes involved in a completely inhomogenous system . novel materials @ xcite ( 2005 ) discovered novel materials with a large energy gap in space , where there are gapless surface states . due to the novel molecular structure with both a small landau band and high energy gap , @ xcite the surface states of the molecules . @ xmath0se @ xmath1 is an important tool for the study of quantum - mechanical lmr . the first experiments with this novel surface state , however , found that a very low mr , which is not positive with the experimental behaviour of @ xmath6 @ xmath7 @ xmath8 ##e , was observed , in the opposite direction where the electron energy gap is such that electrons occupy more than one landau band . @ xcite also , they found that raising temperature to room temperature , had no effect on the observed mr##r . it is clear that this model is in agreement with abrikosov standard model and not with the original hardy - littlewood model . so , a complete theoretical model capable of describing this particular phenomenon has long been lacking . in this paper , we apply the two - dimensional model @ xcite to the model of the surface states of the three - dimensional space to describe the three - dimensional magnetotransport of ti . we find that both linear , nonsaturating and dominantly linear magnetoresistance can occur in a narrow magnetic - field , with the two surface states having both positive and negative magnetic g - forces . this linear magnetoresistance shows up under the conditions of the ion ##ization and high temperature when they are in short range and move to the high boiling points , and even up to room temperature , providing a possible explanation for the first observed linear magnetoresistance in the single bi @ xmath0se @ xmath1 nanoribbons . @ xcite we study the surface states of the bi @ xmath0se @ xmath1 - @ ti - ti junction in the @ xmath9 - @ xmath10 junction under the influence of a strong magnetic field @ xmat##h11 is in the @ xmath12 group . @ xcite from the above paper , @ xcite we know that the surface energy is at the gap of the bulk band and at the zero point , i . e . the surface energies are small . however , the temperatures of the magnetic surface from the gap of bulk band and zero point are much higher than the surface temperature ( @ xmath13 ) described in this paper . therefore , the transition from the bulk band to the magnetotransport is slow . these electrons , generated by randomly distributed electrons and free phonons , are excited by a strong in - plane magnetic field @ xmath14 in the magnetic domain . the hamiltonian of this one - electron and phonon system consists of an electron part @ xmath15 , a phonon part @ xmath16 , and one - electron and electron - phonon parts @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 : @ xmath19 therefore , the resulting hamiltonian is written in the form @ xmath20 , \ ] ] in which @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 , @ xmath23 and @ xmat##h24 , 26 , 27 , for the angular momentum , position , momentum and spin operators of the @ xmath25th electron . for @ xmath26 , @ xmath27 is the dot product of the external magnetic field @ xmath28 is the melting point , @ xmath29 is the electron spin , @ xmath30 is the electron quantum - number of the surface electron , and @ xmath31 is the surface electron with @ xmath32 the total electron spin . the spin operator @ xmath25 . r .

spin part @ xmath54 of the hamiltonian , and. . . the c . m . coordinate and the relative density of electrons are completely independent from each other . the interactions between the electrons occur only in the electron density and electron phonon interactions . therefore , the magnetic field @ xmath55 shows up only in @ xmath38 . and , in terms of @ xmath56 = { \ rm i } \ delta _ { \ alpha \ beta } ( \ delta _ { ij } -

branch levels and the range of ` ` @ xmath100 ' ' - branch levels are so small , that they are restricted to electron transport . special attention has to be paid to the @ xmath104 case , since , depending on the direction of the doping the effective g - factor of the n - state , @ xmath30 , can be positive , negative or neutral . @ xcite the direction and value of the effective g - factor determines how the states of the n level should be included , or excluded from the possible potential for electron transport in the case of @ xmath120 - doping with finite electric field . ( 2 ) if @ xmath131 , the @ x##math104 . 1 is in the @ xmath132 and the state is black - hole rich . the total number of negative energy states ( including the states of the upper half of the @ xmath104 level and states of the @ xmath100 " - branch levels ) and that of positive energy states ( including the states of the upper half of the @ xmath104 level and states of the @ xmath99 " - branch levels ) does not change when entering the state . however , the upper - half negative energy states of this state are not occupied and the upper - half positive - energy states of it are used for the selection of states which are considered as not being in it in the process of @ xmath120 - branching . ( 2 ) for a very large @ xmath133 , the @ xmath104 level @ xmath134 is closer to zero energy and will exit to the nearest @ xmath100 " - branch level of @ xmath135 rather than to the " + " - branch level where the magnetic moment is @ xmath2 . this is equivalent to the existence of an infinitely wide ( with more @ xmath2) energy gap between the + " - branch states and the states of the zero - level and the @ xmath100 " - branch states . the existence of a large energy gap means that with sufficient magnetic field the electrons occupying the + " - branch states would no longer pass into the zero - level , and that the @ xmath104 level should be completely removed from the transition band , i . e . , particles occupying the + " - branch states are considered as electrons participating in transport in the states of @ xmath120 - and , when the magnetic field @ xmath2 gets larger than a certain value ( depending on the value of @ xmath30 ) . ( 2 ) for a positive current @ xmath136 , the @ xmath104 level @ xmath134 goes close to zero , and an extremely large energy gap should be created between the states of the zero - level and the + " - branch and the states of @ xmath100 " - branch states , and particles occupying the @ xmath104 - and + " - branch states are electrons participating in transport when the magnetic field @ xmath2 gets larger than a certain value . as a result , thethe relative electron energy @ xmath33 of electrons involved in collisions is related to the kinetic energy @ xmath137 by the following is valid at temperature @ xmath30 for the magnetic field @ xmath2 greater than a certain value : @ xmath138 in which @ xmath139 + { \ } ^ { - [ } $ ] . the energy is valid at temperature @ xmath76 and the case of @ xmath120 ranges from @ xmath140 for @ xmath133 , and @ xmath141 for @ xmath136 . in the case of @ xmath131 , @ xmath142 \ ] ] , for a magnetic field , in which @ xmath143 . the second part of electron - electron - wave equation in the case of a magnetic field , @ xmath86 , can be written in the vector form : @ xcite @ xmath144 in which the scale is @ xmath145 ^ { , \ { { \ } \ ] ] with @ xmath146 , @ xmath147 , @ xmath148 ,and @ xmath149 with the laguerre polynomials . the landau - level correlation function @ xmath150 in fig .

[ rhob ]( 2 ) . this system is the only one which has a very small magnetic field @ xmath187 . note that here we will consider the case @ xmath157 for a system @ xmath2 larger than @ xmath188 . , for which the small energy change @ xmath135 is taken to mean that with the change of the magnetic field the electrons at the ` ` + ' ' - ' level no longer fit into the zero level and that they should be hidden from the electron electrons . this is of course not true for very large magnetic fields . when @ xmath189 the energy changes @ xmath190 , the situation is similar to the case of @ xmath131 : the entire upper portion of the zero - level states are available to electron electrons and we should have a flat changing @ xmath157 when the magnetic field . with small @ xmath2 the portion of the zero - level states available to electron electrons changes until the magnetic field changes @ xmath191 . as a result the system @ xmath157 should have a transition from a flat changing at small @ xmath2 to a flatsimilar to @ xmath192 . this is precisely the pattern observed in the experiment . @ xmath0se @ xmath1 . @ xcite note that in the case of @ xmath170 , the average landau - level width is much smaller than the neighboring level interval : @ xmath193 , which is @ xmath194 ^ [ $ ] , and for the same peak value @ xmath195 , i . e . the average landau - level width is infinite . with approaching the zero - point , the width of the @ xmath157 increases , and when the average landau - level width is larger than the neighboring level interval , @ xmath196 , a large sdh distribution tends to form around the time - averaged peak width of @ xmath157 for a portion of the total field spectrum , as shown in fig . [ rhob ] ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) for @ xmath197 and @ xmath198 . on the other hand , in the case of infinite fields , e . g . @ xmath199 , where the average landau - level width@ xmath200 is much larger than the planck time scale . for samples of @ xmath120 as well as @ xmath201 , the magnetoresistivity of the sdh , and the linear - independent position changes , with the onset of the hall effect , @ xcite as shown in fig . [ rhob ] ( f ) . abrikosov field theory for the lmr , the applied magnetic field strong enough to reach the landau level at which all the particles are at the same landau level , @ xcite . it is possible that more than one landau level is present in the different samples of the experiment , at which the stable and self - consistent magnetoresistivity is observed . @ xcite for the total magnetic flux of @ xmath202 , the filling of different landau levels , and the filling of @ xmath172 , with different magnetic fields as shown in fig .

[ rhon ] with fixed magnetic field @ xmath209 t . the mobility is shown here to be @ xmath210 and @ xmath211m @ xmath212 / 3 to show the mobility in the lmr region . a non linear dependence of @ xmath213 on the surface density @ xmath33 is observed in both cases , indicating that this non - linear density dependence is not directly proportional to the surface density . in the figure we also show @ xmath208 versus @ xmath33 under the influence of fixed magnetic fields @ xmath214 and @ xmath215 . in this case the half - life @ xmath216 is independent of the density . the linear dependence however remains , indicating that this density dependence is directly proportional to the mobility @ xmath##33 - effect of landau level increase @ xmath216 as long as the temperature is in the lower landau level range . from the above report , it is assumed that lmr ends up in the system with two landau levels and the difference of landau levels is the first result from the linear mobility . at higher temperatures , the thermal expansion would increase the field strength and phonon scattering would decrease landau levels . therefore , it is assumed that this lmr would be dependent against the temperature . this is not the case as shown in ref . [ rhot ] , where we compare the observed magnetoresistivity @ xmath157 for the same system with two - dimensional linear mobility @ xmath217m @ xmath212 / 2 versus the magnetic field at lower room temperatures . we can see that higher temperature to lower temperature has no effect on the dependence of mr . due to the large contribution at higher temperatures from phonon scattering , the observed sdh contribution in the magnetic field tends to decrease . these results are in good agreement with the above results . @ xcite in particular , we have observed the one - dimensional magnetotransport in the complex plane of the two - dimensionaland , which results from the interaction , with a wavevector - like magnetic field and a stable , linear energy distribution in the landau - range . when the field strength is equal to or less than the landau - level , and the free electrons move into the landau level , a stable , dominantly uniform and self - organizing magnetoresistance appears in a very narrow range of magnetic field and temperature up to room temperature . this discussed lmr is a possible explanation for the recently discovered quantum magnetoresistance of the ##ly , @ xmath0se @ xmath1 nanoribbons . @ xcite in contrast to the hall effect which occurs in the regime of very high landau levels and to abrikosov s . magnetotransport , @ xcite which is restricted to the upper upper limit that the electrons go into the low landau level , the discussed lmr is a form of the quantum one - dimensional magnetotransport in a medium with linear - energy - distribution , and in the regime of low landau levels , because of their growth due to the high magnetic field strength . therefore , the following article deals with the # ##ity without .the resulting model is a strongly correlated model , which was used in the first brown and littlewood experiments to model the lmr . @ xcite the magnitude of this large high - charge local magnetoresistance depends on the case of a positive and sizable effective g - factor . if the magnetic energy splitting was very small the experiment @ xmath157 would show a decrease with increasing electric field . in the case of a positive and sizable effective g - factor the magnetoresistivity would change significantly with increasing magnetic field . thus , the study of the local electric versus magnetic field would be a useful tool for determining the direction and the magnitude of the local magnetic energy splitting in v ##v ##1 . this model is supported by the national science foundation of canada ( grant no . 11104002 ) , the national scientific research council of china ( grant no . 2012cb927403 ) and by the council for science & technology and workers ' development of henan province ( grant no . 2012hastit029 ) .
