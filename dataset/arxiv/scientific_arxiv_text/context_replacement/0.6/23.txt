in 1957 g . a . askaryan pointed out that turbulence and cavitation of the motion of an energetic particle in a fluid leads to nonlinear effects @ xcite . in the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s , theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted on the acoustic radiation of waves and particles in dense media @ xcite . the difficulties in studying the properties of the acoustic particle detector , among other things , led to the idea that the technique could be used to detect ultra - high energy ( @ xmath1 ) radiation , i . e . cosmic radiation , in dense media like water , ice and snow . in the 1970s this concept was developed in the dumand - based research project @ xcite and has been used in conjunction with cherenkov particle detector projects since . the detection of cosmic radiation is much more difficult than the search for low - energy radiation ( @ xmath2 ) which is performed by under - ice and under - water cherenkov particle detectors @ xcite . due to the high photon energies , path lengths of 100km @ xmath3 are possible @ xcite . however , the mostof the detection methods used for close coupled experiments with @ xmath4100 w / km @ xmath3 . to understand the performance of the detection methods based on acoustic data it is necessary to understand the propagation of the sound waves by combining measurements and simulations based on different models . according to the so - called thermo - mechanical model @ xcite , the energy deposition of particles in medium leads to a rapid heating of the medium which can be described as cooling with respect to the finite time scale . according to the temperature , the medium expands and contracts according to its own thermal expansion coefficient @ xmath5 . the rapid heating of the surrounding medium produces an electrical signal whose temporal component is zero and which remains in the medium . coherent propagation of the electromagnetic sound waves , transmitted in the vertical plane of the energy deposition , leads to the propagation of a large disc - shaped wave in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the light beam . in this case , the coherent energy deposition of two types of particles , associated with a single source , is observed : a light and a pulsed light , and the emission of a hadronic plasma from a single source under certain conditions . with theto the further further development of the thermo - acoustic method , the results presented below will make use of more - general methods such as geant4 @ xcite for the detection of laser - induced hadronic scattering of water . this data was obtained by the comparison of the resulting acoustic signal with the experimental results , providing opportunities to apply the analytical method in the case of the scattering of ultra - high energy particles . a key observation made in this experiment is non - residual signal formation at a density of water @ xmath6c , where for water at its maximum density the thermo - acoustic signal should be detected and studied in depth . such a residual signal was also observed for the acoustic scattering experiment described in this article , but not for the laser experiment , suggesting that the magnitude of this signal is proportional to the density and the temperature of the medium . in the experiment , the thermo - acoustic signal @ xcite is calculated from these measurements , using a simple formula . because of the energy difference , i . e . , the differential equation @ xmath7 for mass density @ xmath8 , rate of expansion of the momentum @ xmath9 and mass - energy density @ xmat##h10 gives the equation @ xmath11 @ xcite . equation ( [ e _ thomson ] ) can be derived from heat transfer . in the equation , heat transfer effects from processes such as natural convection and heat transfer are included . processes described by the wave equation above are linear . taking the two partial derivatives of f . ( [ e _ thomson ] ) with respect to @ xmath12 and solving for the yields the wave equation @ xmath13 the non - equilibrium wave equation can be derived : @ xmath14 to obtain this equation , the system is split into two slightly different regions : firstly , a region @ xmath15 ( _ ` acoustic ' _ ) , where the energy is lost in the acoustic interaction with the gas and where the gas changes in a non - equilibrium manner ; and secondly , a central ( _ ` acoustic ' _ ) region @ xmath16 , where the acoustic energy flows through the fluid and where # ##ity in local equilibrium can be derived . this region can be represented by the heat transfer matrix , expressing it as @ xmath17 in local equilibrium the changes in momentum distribution are represented by @ xmat##h18 with the bulk thermal expansion ##s @ xmath19 , the bulk pressure @ xmath20 , the high rate of deposition @ xmath21 in the bulk and the waste heat @ xmath22 . in the second case , where @ xmath23 , the momentum transfer equation can be written as @ xmath24 ( with ex . ( [ energy _ densitytensor ] ) and ( [ energy _ density _ vector ] ) ) , where we have the energy difference varies with time . the non - linear process ##s @ xmath25 _ @ xmath26 according to ex . ( [ energy _ densitytensor ] ) can be accounted for the pressure @ xmath27 from the energy difference @ xmath28 and the pressure difference @ xmath29 from the bulk pressure @ xmath30 @ xcite . in the regime above , where non - linear processes exist , we can associate the _ ansatz _ @ xmath31 with the velocity @ xmath32 of the fluid which breaks the symmetry of the energy - density equation and describes with the velocity @ xmath33 in an explicit way the momentum transfer .the following . although a non - equilibirum we replace the . ( [ energy _ wave _ change ] ) with the energy _ wave @ xmath34 of the beam . then , with the total energy - momentum transfer due to the interaction @ xmath35 the wave equation ( [ energy _ wave _ change ] ) becomes @ xmath36 the exact expression for the wave equation can be written in the \ dot notation [ @ xmath37 \ nonumber \ { { e } \ ] ] with the use of the unit space @ xmath38 and the unit space @ xmath39 . for the energy transfer , the first and the second term @ xmath40 have been studied extensively . note that @ xmath41 for @ xmath42 , and that the integration is carried out for the whole of the energy transfer in @ xmath15 . for the energy transfer without momentum transfer to the beam , the total energy of the _ ansatz _ ( [ e : ansatz ] ) can be written ( @ xmath43 ) . @ xmath44 for a thermo - thermal signal produced only by heating of the medium . the energy is@ xmath45 can be shown to be equal to the dimensionless factor @ xmath46 when solving fig . ( [ e _ pressure ] ) for the effect of an internal energy deposition . this ( [ e _ 5 ] ) is equivalent to the one obtained from the calculations given in @ xcite . the approach given above , however , takes a different form , with the above equation and the appropriate energy - momentum equation , yielding a more precise expression in fig . ( [ 1 : 0 - approx ] ) . thus if for an internal energy deposition one arrives at the expression for the standard factor @ xmath45 given in fig . ( [ e _ pressure ] ) . note that the validity of the above equation @ xmath43 as a good approximation would require a direct calculation of the momentum transfer from the material to the energy . taking this into account would result in an extra dipol of @ xmath47 in fig . ( [ e _ pressure ] ) which would be the only contribution to energy transfer if @ xmath48 reduces to 1 . 5 @ xmath49c . however , for @ xmath43 the momentum transfer obtained from thethe energy of the medium is determined by the spatial and temporal variation of the energy deposition density @ xmath50 , . the intensity of the resulting acoustic signal is determined by the acoustic parameters @ xmath21 , @ xmath51 and @ xmath5 , the latter two depending only on the properties of the medium . the accurate evaluation of these properties from the various experimental experiments and the analysis of the resulting acoustic signal , allows for a good interpretation of the thermo - acoustic model . simulations based on the thermo - acoustic model , as used to reproduce the results of the experiments presented in the previous paper , can be described in ref . [ 1 _ 1 ] . note that the energy deposition density @ xmath50 and the time scales for the electron and electron pair interactions presented in this paper are significantly different from those given for the interaction of ultra - high energy particles . therefore , if the interpretation derived from first results allows for a good interpretation of the experimental results , it is reasonable to assume that these experimental results are applicable to the ##s , since they are governed by the same fundamental physical laws . the experiments presented in this paper were connected with the near - ir : yag research .( @ xmath52 ) ' at the erlangen centre for astroparticle physics ( ecap ) of the university of erlangen , and the dedicated @ xmath53 test tank of the ` ` gustaf werner institute ' ' at the ` ` theodor werner institute ' ' in stockholm , sweden . the physical characteristics allowed for a practical test setup . in both cases , the samples were placed into the dedicated @ xmath54 test tank , where the acoustic pressure was measured with two non - linear pressure sensors ( see ref . [ experimental _ test _ results ] ) . the sensors ( also called hydrophones ) could be placed in the tank with an accuracy of 100 % . the temperature of the water could be measured by @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 with a precision of @ xmath57 . the temperature was set to a desired value by first filling the sample with water ; then the resulting water volume was brought to the desired temperature by a slow , controlled process . once the desired temperature had been reached , at least 10min allowed for measurements until the water volume filled , and @ xmath57 allowed heat transfer from the sample . this time period was used for the measurements made .at temperatures above the room temperature . the typical range of spill energies for the proton beam is from @ xmath58 to @ xmath59 , the spill intensity measured at @ xmath60 and the arrival at @ xmath61 . for @ xmath62 samples , the energy transfer into the water along the z axis ( @ xmath63 - 1 , the exit into the water at @ xmath64 ) was more uniform compared to @ xmath65 resulting in the highest z - axis at @ xmath66 ( see ref . [ beam _ energy _ transfer _ method ] ) . to determine the spill energies , the number of particles per bunch was measured . the molecular mass of the sample was measured with two different methods ( atomic rings and molecular rings ) , leading to an uncertainty in the value of 10 % , with much less uncertainty for the spill energy . to determine the spill intensity and arrival for the proton beam in the water tank , the distance of the 1 . 5 km that the beam was traveling from the end of the discharge line in water and its entry into the water tank was used in the geant4 simulation . for the same simulation , the spill energy .measured at @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 and measured with a laser light source . the beam had a duration of 4 @ xmath69 s and the beam width was measured at @ xmath70 . for the visible light beam , the laser energy density distribution along the beam axis is in exponential decay with an average value of @ xmath71 ( see ref . [ laser _ energy _ density _ curve ] ) . for both beam profiles the same laser beam pattern was observed ( the same beam pattern on the @ xmath72 sides of the curve ) . the two researchers had to observe the spatial and temporal dimensions of the beam , as well as the different types of energy transferred into the beam . for these beams , energy is transferred via laser , after which the beam is directed in the direction of the [ ##s . , x = 294 ] for the signal processing , sensors based on the piezo - acoustic sensor @ xcite were used . a new series of these sensors had been developed prior to the experiment . they are linear in frequency response , the frequency response is linear , from a few seconds up to the peak peak of @ xmath73 with ainstead of @ xmath74 ( @ xmath40 . 02v / s ) . the maximum sensitivity is made up of @ xmath45 @ xmath75 and it decreases rapidly at higher frequencies ; at 90khz , the sensitivity is up to 20db . the maximum accuracy of the measurement of the sensitivity is at a resolution of 2db in the frequency range of interest . above 90khz the sensitivity is 5db . to measure the sensitivity of the sensor to an external beam , a parametrised model of an integrated circuit , as described in @ xcite is used . the sensitivity depends on frequency when examined and the average sensitivity was found to be less than @ xmath76 ( or about 0 . 13db ) per @ xmath77 . for a set of the sensor parameters ( frequency , time , spatial resolution , etc . ) the average of the beam pulses is measured with a scanning laser at a pulse rate in excess of @ xmath78 . this method is used for the measurements with all frequencies up to 100khz , where the sensitivity of the sensor is negligibly reduced . these beam pulses are used to remove thermal and acoustic noise from the sensor , thus reducingwith a high temporal resolution . the [ two _ signals ] are the signals used in the proton and the laser beams , respectively , in the same detector and detector setup . the main characteristics of the two signals are : the direct signal for the proton beam has a simple structure , the signal for the laser comes from such a simple structure . the proton pulse contains high frequency pulses up to 10 khz due to the high energy transfer rate at the point of beam entry and the high - energy density relative to the @ xmath79s region of the proton beam ; thus the frequency of the pulse is represented by a portion of the direct signal . the spatial distribution of the measurements of @ xmath50 ##s by the detector corresponds to the two two signals : the first is from the same region of the same @ xmath63 - s as the beam entry ( _ ` direct signal ' _ ) , the second from the beam exit , the point of entry where most of the energy is deposited ( _ ` beam exit ' ' _ ) . the resonance of the proton beam is linear with respect to the laser beam structure . two main solutions to this phenomenon can be identified : the direct signal occurs at the actual location of the direct signal( 0 . 5 @ xmath79s for the reference value , see fig . [ sound _ time ] , followed by the sonic time . ) ; amplitude of the reflected wave from the sensor , and of the transmitted wave , at the initial sub - profile point ; and ; there are periodic changes of the signal affecting the fundamental frequency of the sensor , thereby altering the signal amplitude and causing ringing . the ringing frequency was measured and found to be consistent with the positive energy deposited on the sensors surface by the proton beam . the onset time is also consistent with the proton beam entering into the sensor , even for penetration depths of up to 10 m , and at the acoustic nature of the main signal . the amplitude of this non - linear signal is consistent with the initial sub - profile of the signal , with only slight frequency decay . this distortion of the main signal is called a systematic uncertainty in the signal , and used as input to the analysis . for the most part , the quality is determined and extracted from the data . in order to determine the effect of the systematic uncertainty caused by the systematic uncertainty on the quality of the main signal , two parameters were used : the peak - to - peak ratio and the frequency range from 0 toanalysis of the sample . for the model , these values were used for the laser experiment @ . = 10 cm and @ xmath63 = 10 cm and were calculated over the specified time period . the red - green line in the top right represents the nonlinear ##ity values in the model . [ = _ 1 ] , [ = 264 ] for an in - depth analysis of the thermo - acoustic model , comparison of the experimental data with the data based on the model are performed . to this end , a simulation of the laser signal was performed . it was based on the thermo - acoustic model with a numerical solution of equation . ( [ = _ 1 ] ) . the input parameters to the model were either measured at the surface , i . e . the temperature and pressure difference , or underground , i . e . the surface area of the sample ( see geant4 ) . the diffusion coefficient , thermal expansion coefficient , heat capacity and speed of sound were measured from the tap water , using various parametrisations . good water quality was measured . a series of experiments were performed , where the input parameters were measured only under the conditions described in the model , with precision . both the spatial and temporal acoustic characteristicshas a direct effect on amplitude , frequency and phase of the signal . simulation signals and the corresponding sensor responses compared to the measured signals of fig . [ fig _ signals ] are shown in fig . [ fig _ signals _ sim ] . to avoid unwanted noise from the sensors , e . g . , noise from the sensors , the sensor response was projected onto the simulated signals , rather than deconvoluted from the measured signals . . for the experiment temperature rather than pressure signals were used . . the corresponding straight - line signals match the measured signal in comparison with the sensor response . for better accuracy , the two signals are equal to 1 . [ fig _ signals _ sim ] , n = 264 ] the amplitude of the simulated signals are influenced by the sensor response , with the high - frequency signal being the resonance frequency of the sensor . in the case of the laser experiment , only the output of the sensor is measured , leading to a characteristic shape . for the proton beam , the characteristic bipolar shape is also used , whereas the laser pulse is divided into the two beams described above . the electron beam of the laser experiment has a bipolar shape as well , albeit less so than for the proton beam . ] [fig _ data ] shows the dependence of the signal intensity on the four parameters of the sensor : spatial pressure , pulse length , beam pulse length @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 , water pressure and the temperature of the sensor . the first measurements of the sensors @ xmath82 m , @ xmath83 m , and @ xmath84 m were made . these values were calculated from @ xmath85 to the value of the best agreement with temperature , i . e . the value used for the calculation of the parameters used in fig . [ fig _ data _ sim ] . examples of the effects of thermo - mechanical noise generation are shown . as shown in fig . [ fig _ data ] , the dependence on temperature passes into the sensor @ xmath46 ( where the dependence on the speed of sound is zero ) and is approximately constant under the conditions required for this purpose . the dependence on pressure is roughly linear . the dependence on the beam pulse length is nonlinear . it is governed by the parameters of fig . ( [ pulse _ data ] ) and it depends on both the spatial and the temporal pressure , and the interaction of the sensor with the water. for a given point in space and time , the sound waves produced by the process of energy deposition can vary significantly or not depending on the physical environment . thus , the duration of the light absorption has an effect on the duration , but with 9ns it is much less than the travel time of the acoustic signal through the energy deposition volume . for the 1 million @ xmath79s of energy deposition , the spill time is equal to the transit time . thus the acoustic signal has a linear dependence on the spill time . the dependence of the radial intensity @ xmath86 is . i . e . the radial intensity @ xmath86 follows from the dependence / / @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 fall - off of the light absorption in the near and the far infrared , respectively . the @ xmath81 - dependency was only between @ xmath892 and # ##n , but the pulses were all of the @ xmath90 - dependency . the total difference in intensity was about 50 % . the @ xmath63 - dependency for the acoustic experiment shows the only fall - off resulting from the light absorption . the dependency for the optical experiment shows the only non - linearthis parameter refers to the behaviour of the secondary signal with the same central frequency . from these parameters the combined parameters of the signal are calculated from the experimental values of the individual signals . the main uncertainty for the proton signal is given by the spatial profile of the signal , which is similar to the temporal profile for this section ( but not for the rest of this chapter ) . for the laser signal , this profile includes the signal amplitude angle at the 1 - axis . the other main uncertainty of the signal is the phase angle along the z axis ( @ xmath63 - z ) . fig [ tab _ signals ] shows the parameters and their values ( @ xmath91 ) used for the analysis of the signal . the resulting systematic values of the amplitude ( @ xmath92 ) are given as follows . the experimental values are @ xmath93 for the proton signal and @ xmath94 for the laser signal , . . . the parameters used for the proton signal in fig . [ tab _ signals _ sim ] with their resulting systematic values ( @ xmath91 ) and the values of the amplitude ( @ xmath92 ) . the signal amplitude of theit was adjusted to a value much lower than in the simulation , to reduce reaction time . the resulting change in the parameter values was : @ xmath95 [ n = " < , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] in the figure , the results obtained from the combination of experiment and simulation are shown . the [ fig _ 1 _ sim _ meas ] shows a comparison of reference and measurement signals for the ion beam curves with different sensor positions . for maximum accuracy , the central component of the experiment ( the reference signal ) was used . the measurement parameters of the experiment were kept with the same parameters until the best agreement with the measured signals of amplitude and phase was obtained for the reference signals for @ xmath80 = 0 . 50 m and @ xmath63 = 0 . 50 m . for this purpose , a new process of comparing the parameters , and displaying the best agreement , was found to be necessary . the reference signals were kept with the same parameter values , but the sensor positions were changed . the parameter values changed for the @ xmath63 - values due to the variation of the ion beam curves shown in fig . [ fig _ 1 ] with different curves . the @ xmath##96 - plane and a low energy beam at @ xmath63 - plane correspond to the bragg peak at @ xmath63 = 0 . 2 m . due to this , an almost continuous signal is generated in the medium , with all components parallel to the beam axis . in the medium @ xmath97 m the components are of bipolar shape . along the beam axis ( @ xmath98 m , @ xmath99 m ) the main component of the coherent signal arises from the bragg peak of a nearly continuous signal and a perfect bipolar shape exists . the relationship between signals and measurements is clear for all applications . not only amplitude and phase vary ( see also the previous section ) but also the bipolar shape is preserved to a very high degree . the measurement errors , especially in the non - event region of the bipolar shape , are generated both from the non - incident laser beam and also from the sample surface . however , a large part of the error may be in the reflected energy , or from the thermo - optical signal itself . the main component of the initial deposition of the laser beam is in the initial penetration into the sample . however , the structure of this materialis essentially a laser beam with beam axis along the @ xmath63 - axis , as for the proton beam , with emission mode perpendicular to the beam axis ( coherent mode ) . the signal from the source along the beam axis is reflected , and from the incident source ( beam entry signal ) . in contrast to the proton beam , the frequencies of light at the positions along the @ xmath63 - axis do not differ significantly , but the relative frequencies of the two signal parts differ . thus , fig . [ fig _ laser _ sim _ meas ] is the model for the @ xmath63 - axis in the middle of the first column . therefore , the signal components are well reproduced in the model . the beam entry signal of this part is not well reproduced in the model due to the different geometry , where the instrument function is not well reproduced . + + for the beam positions see @ xmath80 ( shown in @ xmath100 ##0 ) . for more details [ fig _ laser _ sim _ meas ] , n = 325 ] to understand the behavior of the signals in model and analysis of the case above , their frequency and the delay in time of the arrival of the signal .was not developed . for the laser signal , the direct current method was used instead . figure ( [ at _ time ] ) shows the speed of sound for the thermo - laser and the speed of sound in the surrounding , pure water . to determine the physical properties of the measured signals the values of the arrival times for the beam waves perpendicular to the beam axis were obtained . figure [ at _ time _ and _ pressure ] shows the measured signals and a rough fit for the beam wave . the fit is compatible with the sound wave velocity in water , and the measurements yield a speed of sound consistent with pure water at the temperature of . for the laser signal @ xmath101 ( @ xmath102 ) was obtained for the water temperature of @ xmath103c , where the @ xcite gives for pure water the water temperature @ xmath104 which is in complete agreement . for the laser signal the water temperature of @ xmath105c and if the speed of sound is much higher , the beam @ xmath106 ( @ xmath107 ) was obtained in complete agreement with the water temperature of @ xmath108 . the interaction between water and the laserposition ( fig . [ fig _ time _ vs _ distance ] is due to the relative trigger time difference between trigger time and delay time of the two sensors in the system and is used for the determination of the speed of light . ) ) . the vertical lines represent the distances to the reference points : @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 for the electron and proton sensors , respectively . [ fig _ time _ vs _ distance ] , n = 325 ] the amplitude of the measured , led signal varies with sensor position , due to reflections , which are not present and could therefore not be measured . the relationship of model and measured signals for different sensor positions in the same system , with the amplitude of the signal produced by sensors , is shown in fig . [ fig _ time _ sim _ meas ] . the close relationship between model and measurements also manifested itself in the relationship of the phase curve with distance of sensors from the z axis , shown in fig . [ fig _ time _ time _ vs _ distance ] . to avoid systematic errors from measurements , only the amplitude of the measured signal is measured . if there are systematic errors , the original shape of the signal is preserved . the curve is well describedfor the different @ xmath63 - positions . the behaviour at @ xmath111 m is the behaviour observed from the laser source with a @ xmath112 behaviour in the near field compared to @ xmath4 @ xmath113 m and a @ xmath88 behaviour in the far field at that distance . at the same measured distance , the observed behaviour differs from the observed behaviour . ) this is due to errors made in the calculation of the model ( sec . [ fig _ amp ] . at @ xmath114 m the behaviour changes much more rapidly , this is probably a result of the near - source transmission line of the laser source interfering with the input signal at @ xmath115 m . ) for the ion ##ization model . ( consider the measured distances for the different @ xmath63 - positions and the are the corresponding transmission lines . [ fig _ amp _ vs _ x _ laser ] , n = 325 ] the behaviour for the laser source is not very well described in the model ( ( sec . [ fig _ amp _ vs _ x _ laser ] ) . this is probably due to the over - all experimental detection ofthe latter , where the modification of the design will result in significant changes of the signal shape . ( the interactions of the signal with the beam line and beam change the signal shape . at depths of 0 . 5 m the two signal shapes can easily be separated . ) for the proton beam fig . lays out the measured amplitude at @ xmath116 , and the lines the same width . [ fig _ amp _ vs _ vs _ laser ] , [ = 325 ] in these two measurements , the energy - density @ xmath50 scales directly with the beam energy . thus the formula that can be used as a pre - condition for fig . ( [ # _ 3 ] ) scales the width and the measured amplitude ##s . as shown in fig . [ fig _ amp _ vs _ laser ] this effect was observed in the experiment of the zero - ness of the beam lines at @ xmath117mpa for the proton beam and @ xmath118mpa for the laser beam . these values are consistent with experiments . the width of the beam depends on the energy density and the beam energy along the beam line and can therefore not be determined for the two beams . as seen from the data , thethe intensity and signal amplitude have a time dependence on temperature . 2 . there is a 50 % absolute error in the time dependence of the signal amplitude . the values are approximate ##d to the frequency , with the p - value of the lines associated with the error in the signal . the figure shows the figure for the proton beam . [ fig _ intensity _ and _ amplitude ] , x = 325 ] the main limitation of the thermo - optical laser is its dependence on the temperature of the sample . the [ fig _ intensity _ amplitude ] shows the temperature dependence of the signal peak - to - peak ratio for the proton beam , where the minus ( negative ) sign indicates the leading edge ( positive ) component of the signal . the two pulse points shown in the figure were recorded by two cameras simultaneously , which were located at @ xmath119 perpendicular to the beam axis and at @ xmath120 and @ xmath121 along the beam axis , respectively . in the case of the proton beam sensor , which will be shown below , these hydrophone points correspond exactly to the @ xmath63 - position of the bragg - peak and the @ xmath63 - position half time between the bragg - peak and the first pulse intothe temperature , etc . for example , the same position and the same pressure were used for the laser and ion beam experiments . at @ xmath122 . the figure shows the set - up of the laser at @ xmath123c where the sign of the amplitude changes . [ fig _ q _ laser ] , [ = 325 ] the ion beam as shown in illustration . [ fig _ q _ laser ] changes its sign at @ xmath124 , as seen from the thermo - laser experiment . the model expectation for the measured temperature , which is positive to @ xmath125 and zero to @ xmath126 for the same position and pressure , was fitted to the experimental data . only the model , the measurement error , and the change in amplitude ( for the observed variation of the temperature distribution ) were worked out as independent variables . the figure shows a double - negative of the amplitude at @ xmath127 , where the negative is caused by the systematic deviation from the experimental data . therefore , consistent with the model expectation as shown in the figure . the systematic deviation from the model expectation where the amplitude changes its sign is clearly evident . the models were fitted to @ .##math128 . @ xmath122 . [ t _ amp _ proton _ uncorr ] , width = 325 ] . to allow for an accurate comparison of the signal shapes , the point in time at the beginning of the two signals was used as input , and for the corresponding signal the input time was added and decreased to produce the corresponding signal at that time . [ t _ amp _ signals ] , width = 325 ] comparing the signal shapes in the same parameters results in a signal that differs from the other parameters , and a zero - crossing signal different from @ xmath129 and @ xmath130 , see fig . [ t _ amp _ proton _ uncorr ] . the results clearly show the existence of a periodic effect in the zero - crossing of the signal shapes . to investigate this effect , the signal shapes at the beginning of @ xmath129 were used ( fig . [ t _ amp _ signals ] ) . the non - periodic effect is only present at @ xmath129 and the signal has its amplitude at @ xmath129 and @ xmath131 . in light of the observationfrom the laser pulse , and the more subtle evidence of the signal from the pulse shown in fig . [ fig _ of _ the _ uncorr ] , we obtained the residual signal at @ xmath129 , which is an amplitude of @ xmath132 of the @ xmath122 signal , from the pulse . then a low - temperature nonlinear effect in relation to the thermo - thermal effect was observed . the residual signals shown in fig . [ fig _ heat _ proton ] were not supported by the measured parameters . it was corrected for the signal . the signals were then added to @ xmath128 and @ xmath122 . the image shows the build - up of the signal at @ xmath123c where the magnitude of the signal changes . [ fig _ heat _ proton ] , c = 325 ] the exact amplitude of the residual signal at @ xmath133 , which is not observed in the laser beam , could not be directly compared with the laser pulse . from the theoretical point of view , the basic idea for the purposes of fig . ( [ fig _ 2 ] ) is to assume the non -momentum transfer and energy transfer to the electrons in the momentum transfer experiments @ xmath134 and the @ xmath43 , etc . ( [ ref : ansatz ] ) . as mentioned in sec . [ wave _ experiment ] , electromagnetic waves could come to mean the end of the momentum transfer factor for the experiment @ xmath135 . also a non - thermo - optical signal processing method has been proposed in the literature which could give rise to an almost completely different experiment , see e . g . @ xcite . the main differences to the previous experiment are the energies , coming from the electrons themselves and the mass of the electrons which could lead to an interaction with the surrounding gas molecules . another difference is the charged particles transform to massless particles . the results from @ xmath133 were used in earlier experiments as well @ xcite , which will be discussed in more detail in sec . [ subsec : experiment ] . for example , interactions are possible either with free neutral particles ( e . g . electromagnetic radiation ) or with charged particles ( e . g . electrons , @ xmath136 - 7 ) with the electrons located in thezero - crossing . with this analysis it would be possible to distinguish between the number of particles in the fluid and of the charge produced by the particles . with the analysis that has been done above , the current flow due to the thermo - mechanical effect could be unambiguously established . since the model has been used in previous experiments , the analysis used in this experiment required a high level of precision . the most important phenomenon , the residual signal at 4 @ xmath6c that was not observed in previous experiments , was observed with greater precision by analyzing the water column data in terms of @ xmath137c . the observed pattern of the zero - crossing of the amplitude towards values higher than 4 @ xmath6c , followed by the small , non - linear residual signal at 4 @ xmath6c , was in qualitative agreement with @ xcite . in @ xcite , the residual signal at @ xmath123c was also observed . since in that experiment the zero - crossing of the amplitude was observed at @ xmath138c , i . e . a higher value than the average @ xmath123c , it can be assumed that the resulting residual signal was .see below . in @ xcite , a residual signal was observed at @ xmath139c , albeit with a leading compression rather than compression . the authors note that this would lead to a result of just _ below _ the expected value , in contrast to @ xcite and the experiments presented in this article . for the experiment with the proton beam reported in @ xcite , a residual signal was also observed at @ xmath123c , albeit with a leading compression and a slight decrease of the size of the zero - point of the signal required to reach @ xmath140c . this result is in contrast to the other experiments presented in this article . in addition , the results of the experiments listed above show a non - thermal residual signal for both beams , albeit with different results regarding the size of the peak and the amplitude of the resulting non - thermal signal . the results for the proton beam reported in @ xcite differ from those reported in the experiments in question . it should be pointed out , however , that in @ xcite and @ xcite they were reported by the same authors for proton and for laser beam , respectively . a comparison of these two experiments shows that the statistical analysis of the results of @ xmath##123c was used for the same types of waves . however , to the best of our knowledge , there are still no results in contradiction with the existence of fundamental non - linear effects in the form of acoustic waves . see beams with waves . the available data does however allow for a more detailed understanding of the relationship between boundary conditions and the magnitude of the zero - point of the beam intensity . methods to detect particles at ultra - high energies are at the forefront of research in the field of astroparticle physics . they are the best known methods at ultra - high energies beyond the planck limit , i . e . , far beyond several tens of megaparsecs . if successful , the detection of these exotic particles will not only improve the understanding of their own nature , but also provide valuable new information about the physical processes and the mechanisms that drive them to such high energies . for the particle physics , not only the technical aspects such as detector design and detector operation are areas of research . but for the fundamental physical processes the existence of hadronic states arising from particle reactions in dark matter has not been observed before by particle experiments at these energies . the even more difficult extrapolation of reaction rates to ultra - high energies .an ongoing study . with advances in the understanding of waves produced in water and availability of new measurement techniques , the uncertainty in cascade ##s from previous studies increased : the results improved only in @ xcite . at the same time it is important to have a better understanding of the sound signals resulting from the waves produced by the cascade . for this reason , more measurements are required . this study , together with others @ xcite , confirmed the validity of the thermo - acoustic model with measurements from the @ xmath141 laboratory . the analogy to a cascade as described in this study is an echo produced in water . it is waves produced by a wave that originates from a single cascade . in comparison with the uncertainty in the thermo - acoustic model , uncertainty related to the nature of hadronic interactions and cascade - to - cascade interactions are high @ xcite , increasing the difficulty to calculate and model the signals resulting from these interactions . it can also be argued that the high level of uncertainty of the sound signals in the parameters of the thermo - acoustic model is not sufficient for the detection of the cascade ##s . the uncertainty is needed to increase the computational efficiency and reduce noise forthis also results in potential for acoustic radiation detection . several experiments have been conducted @ xcite to study the acoustic properties at the surface of the very large - scale acoustic radiation detectors in the ##water , under snow and ice . the combination of experimental experiments , theoretical experiments and experiments with in - situ experimental data will allow for the demonstration of the theory of acoustic radiation ##s . we have shown that the sound absorption coefficient of the particle detectors is well described by the thermo - acoustic model . in almost all experiments performed , the acoustic properties are consistent with the model . the main results of the experiment are at the energies @ xmath0 ##2 . an example is the non - dependent signal at 15 @ xmath49c for the beta decay process , which can be combined with an additional high - energy dependent signal with 10 @ xmath132 and to the signal at 15 @ xmath49c . the technique allows for analysis of the generation of acoustic waves generated by the presence of high energy particles in combination with the measurement of the thermal energy of the decay cascade . a practical application of this technique would be the detection of particles with 10 @ xmath142 this technique was .and the german ministry for education and research ( bmbf ) with measurements 05cn2we1 / 2 , 05cn5we1 / 2 and 05a08we1 . most of the measurements were made at the ` ` theodor nobel institute ' ' in uppsala , sweden . the authors want to thank all the researchers and all the research staff of desy zeuthen and of uppsala university for their work .
