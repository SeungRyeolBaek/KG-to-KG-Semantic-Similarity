it has become a widely accepted fact that the euv energy observed during the course of _ _ _ mass extinction ( cme ) _ is the total mass loss of the cme , and so we can see a one - to - one correlation between the occurrence of cmes and euv dimmings , unless there are special circumstances . for example , the cme could originate in the corona , in which case the euv source is nearby , or the cme could originate in the upper atmosphere , where there is no euv , because of the thermal scale . the latter case would have a large mass associated with the cme that is at the edge of the corona , i . e . , @ xmath0 between the thermal scale regions . however , there is a case with an isolated cme , that does not have any mass lost by euv ( robbrecht et al . ) a study of the mutual association of euv dimmings and cmes has recently been published by bewsher et al . this study based on cds / ms and lasco data found a 50 % association rate of eu ##s with cmes , and vice versa a 50 % association rate of cmes with eu2003 . some of the non - astronomical observations may be due to noise , cme detection errors , or even phase changes between euv and soft x - rays . eventually the cme - related detection error will reach 100 % when the kepler spacecraft arrives at the center of @ xmath1 and at the galactic plane of the galaxy . a number of studies have been carried out , using the phenomenon of solar wind to detect cme light sources , focusing on small galaxy clusters created by star formation ( harrison 1983 ; watanabe et al . 1992 ) , euv emission during cme eruptions ( harrison 1997 ; aschwanden et al . 1999 ) , soft x - ray emission in cmes ( harrison & lyons 1997 ) , soft x - ray emission during a volcanic eruption ( gopalswamy & hanaoka 1998 ) , the detection of soft x - rays and euv during cme eruptions ( zarro et al . 1999 ; harrison & lyons 2000 ; harrison et al . 2003 ) , detection of cme emission from euv , from imaging data ( harrison & lyons 2000 ; harrison et al . 2003 ) and from euv emission data ( harrison and auchere2004 ; aschwanden et al . . these results support the idea that dimmings in the sky ( as detected by euv , by x - ray , or ultrasound ) are the source of cme activity , and they can be used vice versa to determine the original source . in this section , we attempt for the first time to understand the dynamics of the cme and the associated euv burst itself , which requires a detailed theoretical knowledge of the cme core , and of the cme structure during the initial expansion phase . the dynamics of a cme can also be explained by the slow motion of a negatively charged fluid , that extends from the lower surface down into the upper . various models have been developed to accurately model the internal structure of a cme , such as a central cone , an anti - cone , a ring , and a magnetic - cone , which extend into a self - contained region and which have the same number of vertical and horizontal waves during the initial phase of the expansion . thus we have a three - dimensional ( 4d = 3d + 2d ) model that models the time evolution of the cme structure in space ( time ) in terms of 4d electron density . @ xmat##h2 that allows us now to model and well - model the resulting euv - value of h @ xmath3 at the reference temperature . for the sake of simplicity we start off our model here with the following assumptions , namely : ( 1 ) a similar model for the cme front and cavity ; ( 2 ) self - adjusting changes over time ; ( 3 ) density expansion in the cme front and net density expansion in the cme back ; ( 4 ) energy requirements for the interaction of the cme front , cavity , and the surrounding plasma ; ( 5 ) ##static ( or hydro ) and non - static length scale conditions ; ( 6 ) self - adjusting conditions for the magnetic field at the cme front ; and ( 7 ) a net driving force that remains constant during the time interval of the initial expansion process . this model is consistent with the traditional division of the observed cme front into three parts , namely a cme front ( leading edge ) , a cavity , and a bubble ( although we do not know the first part ) . the first cme front lights up the surrounding plasma that appears as a small bubble around the ' ` ` cme front ' ' or leading edge . the bubbleof the cme bubble is a large increase in energy , due to the thermal expansion , which makes the surface of the cme bubble larger than euv and appears in the name ` ` cme bubble ' ' . the phenomenon of thermal expansion has a temperature and energy distribution along the entire cme bubble , and this is explained with the assumption of a constant plasma @ xmath4 - parameter in the region with a magnetic field , where the cme bubble will be expanded into the solar corona and beyond , where the plasma @ xmath4 - parameter is zero ( not seen in our diagram above ) . the simple dual shape can be described by a single free parameter , the radius @ xmath5 of the bubble . the self - dual shape has the same parameters , but the shape of the cme bubble can also be parameterized by a single time - dependent parameter @ xmath6 . the time - dependence of the cme bubble is governed by two forces , e . g . , both the electromagnetic force and gravitational force . for sake of simplicity we assume a gravitational force during the initial expansion of the cme bubble , which corresponds to the bubble radius @ xmath7 and the two free parameters (@ xmath8 ) to calculate the breakout cme diameter , @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 is the initial velocity at starting time @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 is the initial velocity and @ xmath7 is the acceleration of the vertical expansion . for the location of the cme sphere at time @ xmath13 we have a similar model parameterization , @ xmath14 where @ xmath15 is the initial velocity at starting time @ xmath11 , @ xmath16 is the initial velocity and @ xmath17 is the acceleration of the vertical expansion . this parameterization was obtained with theoretical fit to a simple mhd model of the breakout cme ( byrne et al . 2004 ) as well as with kinematic fit to other cmes ( byrne et al . 2009 ) . , the outer radius of the cme sphere is @ xmath6 , and the inner radius of the cme sphere is @ xmath18 . these values vary quadratically with time . the inner footpoint region of the cme with radius @ xmath19 remains constant during the line - balancing process in order to satisfy the line - balancing requirements of the[ magnetic field at the footpoints . , n = 313 ] . we model the cme bubble with a minimum footpoint area of area @ xmath19 , which extends from the top surface to the bottom surface of the spherical cme bubble . in order to achieve accurate tie - breaks between the footpoints , the cme bubble should always be located at the cyclidrical footpoint area , which means that the scale height is @ xmath20 and the coupling points are @ xmath21 . we show the above figure in fig . 1 . the time - dependent cme bubble model allows for a simple numerical calculation of the cme from the total volume down into the minimum scale height , since the spherical cme bubble can naturally rise to higher dimensions with no net energy loss ( over time @ xmath22 , see right - hand side of fig . 1 ) . with thermal expansion of the cme bubble , the mass density of the critical volume increases relative to the total volume , i . e . , @ xmath23 . it decreases with the thermal expansion as a function of distance from the critical volume @ xmath24 ( of the total mass of the cme ). for the temperature distribution of the cme we distinguish between a convection region at the outer boundary , called the cme front , and a convection region at the inner , which is also the cme back . we have an outer radius @ xmath25 of the cme front that is assumed to be held constant during the non - heating phase of the cme . since the radius @ xmath6 is the outer radius of the cme front , we replace the outer radius of the cme front by the radius of the boundary with @ xmath18 , @ xmath26 which has an initial value of @ xmath27 . the inner radius @ xmath28 of the cme is composed of the outer volume with radius @ xmath6 and the cylindrical base of the cme with an initial value of @ xmath29 , @ xmath30 \ , \ ] ] which has an initial initial value of @ xmath28 , @ xmath31 \ . \ ] ] the width of the cme front @ xmath32 is simply the difference between the outer and inner volumes ( with the cylindrical base as the footpoint ) @ xmath33 is the initial@ xmath34 of the plasma front , @ xmath35 we have now to calculate the time - averaged volume of the cme , for both the cme front , which heats the plasma during thermal expansion , as well as for the cme rear , which heats due to the thermal expansion . the total volume @ xmath36 of the plasma that is taken up from the external corona to the cme corresponds to the initial cme volume @ xmath37 . the total volume of the cme front , @ xmath38 \ \ & = m _ p < m _ n > { n \ to t } \ , [ m ( t ) ^ 3 - m _ p ^ 3 ] \ end { array } \ , \ ] ] where @ xmath39 is the mass of the excited atom and @ xmath40 is the electron density in the external corona spread over the cme front . the electron mass has to be included in the volume @ xmath41 of the cme front , @ xmath42 \ end { array } \ , \ ] ] therefore , the volume is a function of the average electron density @ xmath43 of the cme front and the cmthe density @ xmath40 of @ xmath44 this density ratio increases to infinity at the same time , i . e . , @ xmath45 and monotonically increases with time . the critical value of the density ratio in mhd , derived from the _ smith - hugoniot equation _ ( e . g . , smith 1982 ) is : @ xmath46 . faster cmes are expected to be faster and therefore have a higher compression factor at the cme front than slower cmes . so we use the maximum compression factor @ xmath47 as a critical parameter , keeping in mind that all the plasma should be in the range of @ xmath48 . since we know both the density @ xmath25 of the cme front as well as the maximum density compression factor @ xmath47 we have the value of the critical radius @ xmath49 for the critical radius @ xmath18 when the desired external density of @ xmath47 is reached ( see fig . 1 ) , @ xmath50 which is the critical radius @ xmath49 , @ xmath51 ^ { 1 / 2 } \ . \ ] ] however , for plasma in this rangeradius @ xmath49 can be used as the cme front , because the plasma at this outer radius enters the gas flow and fills the cavity , with the same pressure as @ xmath52 of the plasma ( according to fig . 1 ) , @ xmath53 } ^ 3 & { \ rm for } \ \ r ( t ) \ , r ( t ) \ \ { \ left [ t _ 1 / r ( t ) \ . ] } ^ 3 & { \ rm for } \ \ r ( t ) < r ( t ) \ , { t } \ , . \ . \ ] ] our theoretical model of the circular cme front has a total of 12 physical parameters : 5 physical parameters ( the heliographic radius ( @ xmath54 ) and height @ xmath55 of the inner cme front . ) , 4 kinematic parameters ( the pressure @ xmath11 , velocity @ xmath56 , density @ xmath57 ) , 4 physical parameters ( the velocity @ xmath19 and height @ xmath25 of the cme front ) , and 4 density parameters ( the outer radius @ xmat##h24 , a density compression factor @ xmath47 in the cme front , the effective surface temperature @ xmath58 ( the peak thermal temperature ) , and an effective density scale height factor ( or quasi - hydrostaticity factor ) @ xmath59 that is the ratio of the effective density scale height to the density scale height factor ( @ xmath58 ) . the temperature @ xmath58 is the density scale height @ xmath60 of the temperature in the 3d temperature distribution , which is the ratio of the effective density scale height @ xmath61 ( e . g . , { . [ fig . 1 . 2 ] ( aschwanden 2004 ) , @ xmath62 } \ . \ ] ] then , for an actively convection region ( fig . 11 ) , a density compression factor @ xmath63 in the cme front ( fig . 12 ) , and a temperature in the cme front ( fig . 13 ) , we have the following distance - dependent 3d temperature distribution : @ xmath64 where @ xmath65 is the distance of an observation associated with a temperature @ xmath66 to the cm##aneous shell [ @ xmath67 $ ] of the cme , @ xmath68 ^ 2 + [ y - y _ 0 ( t ) ] ^ 2 + [ z - z _ 0 ( t ) ] ^ 2 } \ , \ ] ] which is located at [ @ xmath13 ] from the heliographic coordinates ( @ xmath54 ) . another cme event observed with data that appears as a perfectly symmetric shell , and therefore is not suitable for comparison with our analytical data , was the 2008 - 10 - 01 , 12 : 00 utc , event . this cme was on the left side for spacecraft stereo / above , and was observed on the frontside of the solar system with spacecraft stereo / below . a detailed description of this event , cme mass and euv , can be found in aschwanden et al . ( 2009a ) , the cme event was observed in white light with stereo / cor - 2 ( colaninno and vourlidas 2009 ) and with stereo / euvi ( aschwanden et al . 2009b ) , and the shell structure was observed with co - projection of the analytical data to the white - light region ( thernisienet al . 2009 ; temmer et al . 2009 ; maloney et al . 2009 ; mierla et al . 2009a , b ) . while the previous models consider the visible - light emission of this cme , only a few solar masses away from the sun , our model looks specifically to the cme emission , from the solar system , as determined by euv . we use the model developed by aschwanden et al . ( 2009a ) . our model directly describes the geometry and structure of the cme , as well as the euv parameters associated with the size of the cme . figure 2 and 3 show sets of 16 ( 16 ) euv images , each labeled with u / a and scanned with a resolution of 1 m during the time period of 18 : 55 - 19 : 00 , effective 2008 - 10 - 11 . in order to determine the physical size of the cme as a function of time we measure the outer edge of the cme bubble ( a simple circle of 3 points ) between each image and each pixel and draw a circle around the 3 points in the image . the 3 points for determining the size of the cme bubble are all located in the surface area of the image .##e = , which could not have been identified except in regions with large overlapping features . in those cases we selected the regions that are closest to the rapidly expanding bubble . the x and y - positions of the circular shells are well separated from the stereo / b images , so that only the y - positions of the regions of the circular shells need to be compared to the epipolar stereo / b images . we found that the dimensions of the cme bubble models correspond with the dimensions of the bubbles seen in the stereo / b images first ( up to 18 : 36 ut ) , and there is no difference later on . thus the cme has a more complex structure than our original bubble model , which needs to be analyzed further . this analysis gives the cme values [ @ xmath69 $ ] and @ xmath70 $ ] for the time period @ xmath71 . the distances in fig . 2 and 3 are displayed with a small resolution ( by displaying the pre - cme image at 18 : 36 ut ) to increase the resolution of the cme images . the actual distances to the cme bubble models are shown in fig . 2 and 3 . these images areare coaligned and converted into epipolar coordinates ( inhester et al . 2006 ) , so that the y - coordinates of a given spacecraft are identical to the original a and b coordinates , and the x - coordinates are related to the angular angular distance @ xmath72 , which corresponds to @ xmath73 at the time of the cme measurement . the epipolar coordinates obtained from the conversion are directly related to the heliographic coordinates @ xmath74 , latitude @ xmath75 , and longitude @ xmath76 from b . as above , @ xmath77 which can then be used to obtain the spherical ( epipolar ) coordinates @ xmath78 , @ xmath79 ^ { } \ \ } = \ end { ( x _ a / y _ b ) } \ end { \ } \ ] ] then , using circular coordinates , we can directly obtain the spherical coordinates @ xmath80 , @ xmath81 for all the time series , as well as calculate the cme value of @ xmath82 from the closest approach to the cmes . we consider the quantities called observables@ xmath83 , @ xmath84 , @ xmath6 , and @ xmath85 from fig . 1 and using our combination of @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 from the data . we have a combination of @ xmath86 ( for spacecraft stereo / a ) , @ xmath87 ( for spacecraft stereo / b ) , and a latitude @ xmath88 . thus , the cme source region is completely observed for stereo / a . these epipolar coordinates can be entered into the lunar coordinate system using the viewing angle @ xmath89 of the spacecraft stereo / b camera . seen from earth , the longitude is at @ xmath90 . thus , the cme source region is @ xmath91 on the lunar surface when seen from earth . this is why the euv region is completely uncontaminted from solar - system ##s , which is observed for stereo / b and not for stereo / a . ( top panel ) and longitude @ xmath84 ( bottom panel ) of the cme plane , the latitude @ xmath6 of the cme plane ( bottom panel ) , and the##e = s @ xmath13 ( 0 ) . the average values are @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 for the heliographic function . the cme radius @ xmath6 and radius @ xmath13 are calculated with simple formulas ( straight lines ) , yielding the values @ xmath94 mm ( 18 : 38 ut ) , @ xmath95 mm , @ xmath96 km , and s @ xmath97 km s @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 km s @ xmath98 ( see fig . 1 - 2 ) . , [ = 313 ] we consider all the observables @ xmath13 and @ xmath6 in fig . 1 and compute the average values @ xmath55 , @ xmath100 , @ xmath17 , @ xmath7 . consider the average values @ xmath6 ( fig . 1 ) and @ xmath13 ( fig . 2 ) , for which we calculate the mean radius @ xmath94 km ( 18 : 38 ut ) , the average cme radius @xmath95 mm , the initial velocity @ xmath96 mm , and the velocity @ xmath97 km s @ xmath98 for the cme of jupiter , and @ xmath99 km s @ xmath98 for the radial velocity . the initial velocity was found to be two ( @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 ) . we estimate the parameters of the resulting model to multiple of 1 @ xmath0 , based on the probability of approaching the outer edge of the cme . thus , we estimate 12 out of the 13 known parameters of our model sofar . note that the acceleration described above corresponds to the outer edge of the cme at the closest radius of @ xmath103 the radius described in euvi ##i . the acceleration is assumed to be very large and to gradually decrease further out , when the local gravitational fields are at higher frequencies . this is why our estimates for the acceleration at low corona heights are much higher than those further out in the sky , typically on the order of tens of tens of @ xmath104 in the range of 10 - 100 solar masses , as compared withsoho / lasco . soho / lasco shows only a slightly higher brightness at altitutes of 18 - 20 solar masses . the strong gravitational waves that form the cme are also reduced to much higher frequencies . we model the surface brightness of the cme boundary with the time - varying width @ xmath6 and the width @ xmath25 of the cme boundary region . in fig . 2 we show cross - sectional euv radiation profiles of the cme in horizontal direction ( parallel to the sample boundary ) and in vertical direction for the euvi / soho 171 boundary ( shown with horizontal direction parallel ) . these space - based models also show the surface brightness with a single bright rim at the cme boundary , which corresponds to the upper boundary region of the thermal radiation profile of the cme . the bright rim are clearly visible in the image during 1 : 1 @ xmath10518 : 1 as shown in fig . 2 . the average brightness of the two bright rim is @ xmath106 , , the value we use in our model . thus we are presented with the two brightness profiles @ xmath107 , and @ xmath47 . since we are the only observersas with the 171 filter , the effective temperature is given by the maximum value of the observed euvi response function , which is therefore @ xmath108 mk . this is the temperature response up to @ xmath109 mk . the temperature response parameters @ xmath59 , @ xmath24 , and @ xmath47 are to be obtained from forward - fit methods for forward - fit of observed euv brightness images ( or profiles , as shown in fig . 1 ) to observed euv brightness images ( or profiles ) . the euv brightness image for each pixel of @ xmath110 can be obtained by line - of - sight integrating with the @ xmath111 - axis of our sub - model @ xmath112 per pixel , @ xmath113 for each pixel @ xmath114 , @ xmath115 from which the magnitude @ xmath116 of the resulting signal in terms of dn s @ xmath104 can be directly calculated by integrating with the thermal response parameters @ xmath117 of the 171 filter , @ xmath118 where @ xmath119 dn s @ xmath10##4 @ xmath120 mk @ xmath104 and the fwhm of the 171 stars in @ xmath121 mk . in fig . 4 we obtain best - fit values of horizontal and vertical flux profiles . the vertical flux profile is similar to the actual horizontal flux profile , which we obtain by measuring the absolute brightness difference between horizontal and actual flux profiles . we obtain a best - fit value of @ xmath122 @ xmath123 . the non - hydrostaticity profile is very similar to the vertical flux profile ( fig . 5 , right - hand side right ) , for which we obtain a best - fit value of @ xmath124 . however , the peak density scale observed in the cme region is not too - large , as expected for active regions . these values are consistent for non - active region and active region samples ( see fig . 6 and 7 , aschwanden and acton 2001 ) . the most important factor , the peak density scale factor @ xmath47 , is called the brightness of the cme region . so the value measured in the cme region for those regions where no stars are present is consistent with the value of @ x##math125 . ll ##l & best -

sectional horizontal and vertical pressure profiles ( fig . 5 ) , we are now in the position to cross - reference the above calculated images with the actual images , as shown in fig . 6 for two different spacecraft , for both the europa / a and b spacecraft . the image has a high resolution for the location of the center of the the two dark regions , possibly up to about 1 . 5 million square degrees above the lunar surface . the maximum - density images of euvi / b show a relatively uniform cme ( as the camera assumes by definition ) , dominated by theand one of the northern and southern cme boundary ( if the model is able to describe them ) . the model , however , is not in agreement with the actual euvi / b images . the shape of the euv ##l bubble corresponds almost exactly , although the northern dim ##ming is strongly associated with the postflare regions that lie in the vicinity of the cme , which are largely absent in the euvi / b images . the main difference between the model and the euvi / b images is the location of the western side of the cme bubble . the effects of measurement error and density compression produce a dark rim on the western side , where we look for a higher and wider rim lying closer to the cme boundary , which is not present in the images of euvi / b . also , there is a dark rim just beyond the western rim that could not be predicted by the model . thus there is more density compression on the southern side of the cme bubble than the one predicted . another difference is the bright rim observed in euvi / b at 12 : 00 ut , which does not match the shape of the northern cme bubble as predicted by euvi / b . the, there are some differences from the perfectly simple cme shell model that is present in euvi / b but not in euvi / c . even a simple bubble model could better fit the data than a cylindrical shell model . these differences between the observations and our simple first - order model provide the conditions for a more complex model ( with many additional variables ) that describes changes in the size distribution of the cme . our model allows us , in particular , to estimate the cme density by integrating the density @ xmath2 over the entire cme region , which is of course increasing with time , and appears to increase to a maximum density when the cme expands far enough into the universe . a similar upper limit can also be obtained by measuring the density of the cylindrical shell at the footpoint of , @ xmath135 from our cross - fit of @ xmath95 g , @ xmath136 , @ xmath137 @ xmath123 and the maximum expansion factor of @ xmath138 g , we obtain a lower limit of @ xmath139 g . however , this cme appears to expand in a bubble - like manner .the size - factor is , so the total radius and mass are estimated to be about a quarter of @ xmath140 g . however , the mass measured at 171 corresponds only to about a quarter of the total cme mass ( aschwanden et al . 2009b ) , so a more accurate estimate of the total cme mass is about a factor of 2 than our theoretical estimate , i . e . , @ xmath141 g , which takes us into the context of two cme mass estimates of this particular object , i . e . , @ xmath142 g from stereo / cor - 2 brown - dwarf observations ( colaninno and vourlidas 2009 ) , and @ xmath143 g from stereo / euvi observations ( aschwanden et al . we use an inverse 4d model that models the cme mass and euv , in terms of a linear combination of euv values that can then be compared to the parameters of stereo / euvi . the galactic envelope of the cme is characterized by a self - organizing galactic envelope of a large cme disk , with a galactic front with high density and a front with low density , andthe interaction of the cme and the atmosphere . we re - compare this data to iso / euvi data of the cme event of 2008 - 08 - 09 and obtain the following results : 1 . the model is able to estimate the relative vertical motion and expansion of the cme through multiple observations and gives an estimate of @ xmath144 km s @ xmath98 for both the observed surface motion and vertical expansion during the first half minute of cme entry . adding the euv data set of the model to the data set gives the mean mass distribution of the cme region ( @ xmath145 @ xmath123 ) and the region at infinity , which is assumed to be non - negative by a factor of @ xmath136 . the mean cme propagation speed during the first half minute is : @ xmath146 km s @ xmath104 , similar to the propagation speed calculated for eit data during the same event ( i . e . , @ xmath147 km s @ xmath104 , veronig et al . 2008 ; @ xmath148 km s @ xmath104 , veet al . 2008 ; @ xmath149 ( and @ xmath104 , patsourakos et al . 2009 ) , and . the cme relaxation process appears to be closely related to the thermal relaxation time of eit ##p . the annual mean temperature , peak temperature , and footpoint all predict the cme shell , but these estimates have a roughly equal ##ized relationship with the euv model ( e . g . , see aschwanden et al . 2009b ) . 5 . the size and the relaxation time of the cme shell are well predicted by our model , but these estimates suggest a more compact cme shell . 6 . while the spherical shell model fits the euvi / b model well , significant differences are observed in the euvi / b model , with large differences in the cme shell , thus allowing a better understanding of density and molecular orbital dynamics . the most important result of this recent work is that euv model can be modeled in a mathematical way and that it is a direct model of the molecular energy distribution of the cme . this work has shown that the spherical shell model can explain a number of physical properties of the molecular cme , whichdescribes the physical and kinematic characteristics of the first phase of the cme process , and describes no additional effects that require further modification of the original 2d - wave model . the combination of full 4d models with back - projection to the euv models appears to be a useful tool to understand further the behavior of cmes . combined with the rms and mhd measurements may help clarify the physical properties and may provide the ability to distinguish between different different cme models . full 4d models of the observed cme data can also provide a self - consistent description of eit ##v and cme effects ( e . g . , wang et al . 2005 ) , for which we have no kinematic models . this work is documented by the company website and us patent n00173 - 02 - 04 -
