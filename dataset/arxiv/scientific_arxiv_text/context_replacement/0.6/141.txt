at that time @ xmath9 a cloud of gas particles of average size @ xmath10 is brought into contact with a gas particle of size @ xmath0 space @ xmath3 space . the particles are ejected upon hitting the gas . thus , this mathematical model describes the dynamics of the pressure - driven gas transport process @ xcite . the behavior of the _ _ _ fine - grain ##ed density of the gas is described by the following equation @ xmath11 , \ text { difeq } \ ] ] where @ xmath12 is the gas diffusivity . here we will be interested in the dynamics rather than just the particle density . an important statistical variable is the number of particles @ xmath13 that are hit during a given time @ xmath2 . we will focus on two questions : ( i ) what is the probability that @ xmath14 , that is , will hit the gas until time @ xmath2 ? ( ii ) what is the most likely value of the particle density of the gas based on the non - impact until time @ xmath2 ? these questions often arise in the context of the search for an unknown object .for examples of random walkers , see e . g . , . @ xcite and discussed below . this behavior has been studied only in the special case when the swarm contains non - random random walkers ( rws ) . in this case @ xmath15 , and the fact that the swarm survived until , @ xmath2 , @ xmath16 was found to exhibit the following real - world behavior @ xcite : - , & @ xmath17 , [ survivaldecay1 ] + , & @ xmath18 , [ survivaldecay2 ] + ( t - t ) _ dr ^ , - , t _ dr - , & @ xmath7 , [ survivaldecay3 ] where @ xmath19 is the surface area of the @ xmath3 - the search space , and @ xmath20 is the diffusion length . since ( [ survivaldecay2 ] ) and ( [ survivaldecay3 ] ) are the upper limit of the diffusion asymptotics for random sequences , when @ xmath21 , i . e . , the average diffusion length @ xmath22 is very small compared to the diffusion length @ xmat##h0 . 0 ( [ survivaldecay1 ] ) is independent of @ xmath0 , and the value @ xmath6 is zero . as a result , ref . ( [ survivaldecay1 ] ) is valid as long as @ xmath2 is no larger than the corresponding particle diffusion factor . the particle diffusion problem is a special case of the more general problem of determining the average extent of particle absorption by the gas . for the rws , this problem has been successfully solved by ref . @ xcite . here we solve the diffusion problem in two ways . first , we consider a lattice gas of _ n _ particles . for each of the particles , we assume that the particles interact via diffusion . this would be a very useful approach for studying diffusion - dependent chemical reactions in complex environments such as the solar system @ xcite . second , we will consider a lattice gas characterized by the single particle diffusion process ( ssep ) . in this process a particle will hop to a new target site if that site is occupied by another particle . if it is not , the hop is repeated . the diffusion rate of this process is then described by the diffusion factor ( [ difeq] ) with @ xmath23 @ xcite , both the ssep and the rws are equal at the level of population . however , as we see here , the long - term expression of the average survival probability @ xmath1 for the ssep is differently from that for the rws : @ xmath24 this expression has the same form as fig . ( [ survivaldecay3 ] ) , but it is much faster with the population : @ xmath10 @ xcite ; see fig . [ arcsinsquared ] . we note that the expression for the ssep above gave values for @ xmath25 @ xcite . finally , we note that , for @ xmath17 , the survival probability @ xmath1 depends only on the initial state . this expression does not affect particle - particle interactions , and it only holds for the rws , as we see here . in addition , the expression ( [ survivaldecay1 ] ) is only valid for averaging over the initial states of particles , that is , for the initial state @ xcite . we have a similar expression for the population boundary condition , fig .see the equation @ xcite . for the rws , the two solutions for @ xmath8 differ by a small amount . for the ssep , only their @ xmath10 - value is valid for @ xmath17 . third , we note that the two and three - dimensional solutions , combined and transformed , play a key role in three dimensions when one is interested in _ and _ asymptotics of @ xmath1 for @ xmath26 , that is when the diffusion coefficient @ xmath22 is much larger than the diffusion length , and much smaller than the diffusion coefficient @ xmath0 . finally , in addition to evaluating @ xmath1 in three dimensions , we also evaluate the most likely value of the solution , based on the target survival until reaching @ xmath2 . we obtain this solution , and many of the others , by using the maximum diffusion theory ( mft ) @ xcite . this coarse - grain ##ed - scale method was developed when most of the calculations of the target survival rate were done . the mft is well suited for the analysis of representative samples for many parameters , including the ( expected ) target survival at all timesthat we are dealing with now . one of our main results for the ssep is that , in the long - term case , @ xmath27 , the most likely equilibrium density profile for @ xmath7 is , for one of the cases , [ exactly : @ xmath28 , \ ] ] where the escape velocity is given by the extinction coefficient @ xmath22 . it is this density profile that gives the second term ( [ actresultd ] ) of the survival probability . last but not least , we apply our results to a whole range of other , related problems . in the next section we consider the mft solution of the gas stability problem . the [ exact ] solution with @ xmath29 for @ xmath27 . the @ xmath8 is also referred to as the _ _ _ solution of the mft problem , regardless of whether the gas is stable or not . we solve these equations , for @ xmath30 and obtain the results for @ xmath31 by solving the mft problem above . in addition . [ nonstat ] we compute , and compute the survival probability under non - equilibrium conditions , stationary and stationary ,in three dimensions and for all energies . in sec . [ extension ] we extend our results for @ xmath29 to a whole family of interacting lattice gases . our microscopic results are given in sec . [ extension ] . in addition we give , for non - interacting rws , a microscopic derivation of @ xmath1 for the ground and excited states and for @ xmath17 , @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 . both the microscopic results and the mft ##s show that , for @ xmath34 , the main improvement to @ xmath8 is due to the microscopic results obtained in one dimension . the quantum field theory ( mft ) was developed for the study of non - interacting excited states of interacting lattice gases @ xcite . later it was extended to a family of non - interacting systems @ xcite . the mft , and its extension to elementary electronic systems @ xcite , have proven to be very useful and useful . here we see the mft ##s , refer the reader to the next section for more details . the starting point for the derivation of the mft will be the langevin equation that provides a very large - scale solution to the entire problemof these are : @ xmath35 + \ nabla \ cdot \ left [ \ sqrt { \ math ( t ) } \ , \ left { \ boldmath $ \ , $ } ( \ mathbf { t } , \ ) \ right ] , \ ] ] where @ xmath36 is the second - order background noise , well - known both in space and in time @ xcite . as we now see , the quantum background noise is also described by @ xmath12 and the gas , @ xmath37 , that arises from the background noise and is equal to half the mass of the particle @ xcite . finally , the mft theory is the wkb version ( by wentzel , kramers and brillouin ) of the classical fokker - planck equation derived from the langevin equation ( [ lang ] ) . the wkb theory treats , in a similar way , the total number of particles in the same region of space as a single number @ xcite . in the mft theory , the probability - density function @ xmath38 and the complex - particle " mass " @ xmath39 arethe linear equation @ xmath40 , \ label { d1 } \ \ \ int _ { [ & = & - f ( q ) \ nabla ^ { & - \ frac { { } { q } \ , \ pi ^ { \ partial } ( q ) ( \ nabla } ) ^ { , \ label { d2 } \ , { q } \ ] ] where the derivative is the derivative with respect to the target . , and can be expressed in terms of variational equations : @ xmath41 , @ xmath42 = \ int [ \ mathbf { x } \ , \ mathcal { x } \ ] ] is the hamiltonian , and @ xmath43 is the hamiltonian . . the linear analysis of . . ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and as in the above , is done in the phase space of the target . because of the periodic nature of the target , we know that the solution only depends on the target position and orientation . we can solve the following linear equation over an arbitrary space @ xmath3 . the boundary conditions of the target are @ xmath44 @ xcite , where the solution is @ xmath45 which is an initial point .further away from the source the system becomes unstable , hence @ xmath46 . the initial conditions in general are the same . for @ xmath9 we have @ xmath47 where , for the ssep , @ xmath48 . this is a finite , possibly random , initial condition , see below . a different initial condition ( that is , an infinite one ) is given in ref . [ app : 1 ] . in working on the ideal gas theory , let us consider for a moment a slightly different case where @ xmath13 , the minimum number of free electrons in the @ xmath49 , is zero . this constraint , @ xmath50 = [ , \ ] ] is an initial condition on the system . this constraint is similar to the one used in the theory of propagation of electric fields during a finite time @ xcite . a similar approach gives the following initial conditions for @ xmath51 : @ xmath49 : @ xmath52 where @ xmath53 is the classical gamma function , and @ xmath54 is the a priori classical lagrange function that is not satisfied by us .( [ 1 ] ) next , we calculate @ xmath55 . the special case of @ xmath14 in which we are interested , corresponds to @ xmath56 @ xcite . in this case the net neutron flux to the target is at all times @ xmath57 . the solution of the mft problem for @ xmath58 is the following equation : the most likely life form of the target depends on the number of free particles @ xmath13 . once @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 are known , we can solve the following equation @ xmath60 which becomes @ xmath61 due to the pre - elimination process : @ xmath62 for the ssep @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 @ xcite , and etc . ( [ actionmain ] ) for @ xmath65 upon replacing @ xmath66 by @ xmath2 and @ xmath67 by @ xmath22 @ xcite , we can then calculate @ xmath68 , etc . ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 1 ] ) and replace @ xmath0 by @ xmath6##9 and @ xmath13 and @ xmath70 ##0 . example ( [ actionmainssep ] ) for the ssep is @ xmath71 where @ xmath72 we are working in the boundary of @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 . in two - dimensional , @ xmath17 , the limit @ xmath0 ( and hence @ xmath75 ) is neglected because of the rotational symmetry of the whole mft space . we will illustrate this example in fig . [ 1d ] . for @ xmath29 there are two other limiting cases : of small and large @ xmath6 . the solution @ xmath6 with the _ stationary _ solution , shown in fig . ( [ difeq ] ) , shows that @ xmath2 is much longer than the half - life @ xmath76 required for the gas phase to reach a steady state at the target . as a result , the net heat transfer to the target can be calculated by solving the _ stationary _ solution of the diffusion equation . for @ xmath15 this amounts to solving the diffusion equation @ xmath77 with the boundary of @xmath78 and @ xmath79 , and to @ xmath80 we find that this also holds for _ fluctuations _ , namely those responsible for the extinction factor . thus , when @ xmath27 , the first possible solution to the equation @ xmath60 from is . ( [ actionmain ] ) follows from the _ fluctuations _ solution of the mft equation that satisfy the boundary conditions in space , but not the boundary conditions in time . for these , viz . ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) , @ xmath81 = q = \ text { const } , \ text { zeroflux } \ \ & & \ frac { f ( q ) } { r ^ { d - 1 } } \ , \ frac { d } { dr } \ , ( r ^ { d - 1 } + \ left ) + \ frac { d } { dr } \ , \ right ^ { \ right } ( q ) ] ^ [ = \ , \ text { steadyv } \ , { q } \ ] ] where @ xmath82 . the positive value implies that the overall survival of @ xmath83 is##es ##r all times @ xmath57 . to @ xmath84 , and from to . ( [ zeroflux ] ) @ xmath85 . putting this into the . ( [ steadyv ] ) we obtain @ xmath86 where @ xmath87 is the spherical symmetric differential equation in @ xmath3 dimensions . for the ssep : . ( [ steadyeqgen ] ) , @ xmath88 ##8 , the solution @ xmath89 reduces the linear ordinary differential equation ( [ steadyssep ] ) to the spherical symmetric differential equation in @ xmath3 dimensions : @ xmath90 the boundary between @ xmath91 and @ xmath92 are @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 . solving this equation and applying to @ xmath95 , we obtain : . ( [ qd ] ) . this is the most efficient survival function based on stability of the system until reaching @ xmath2 . thus we can write @ xmath96 : @ xmath97 } . \ { { { } \ ] ] in particular , for @ xmat##h31 @ xmath98 , \ label { q3 } \ \ right ( es ) & = & \ frac { r \ , \ , \ sqrt { n _ 0 } } { r ^ 2 \ , \ , [ r \ , ( 1 - \ frac { \ , } { r } \ right ) \ , \ , \ sqrt { n _ 0 } \ right ] } . \ label { v3 } \ , { r } \ ] ] the behavior of @ xmath99 near the target , @ xmath100 is similar to @ xmath101 . also there is a distance behavior of @ xmath102 near the target : @ xmath103 which is independent of @ xmath10 . the following behaviors near the target show that the behavior close to the target exists . however , one of the two behaviors in the equation , in fig . ( [ zeroflux ] ) , is ##es . as it turns out , these behaviors , like the ones in the distance behavior ( [ vdiverge ] ) , are quite different : they are not , for@ xmath104 , for the ground and excited states and in three dimensions ( for @ xmath17 where the mft _ is _ _ _ - zero ) for all the particles that behave as non - interacting rws at low temperatures . an example of the equilibrium probability density function for @ xmath31 is shown in fig . [ 3dthnum ] . in case of the presence of @ xmath96 and @ xmath83 , the step ( [ actionscaled2 ] ) is taken , and we get @ xmath105 and again , etc . ( [ actresultd ] ) . in particular , for @ xmath31 @ xmath106 and @ xmath107 note that as @ xmath10 ##9 @ xmath108 , the average survival probability goes up , and becomes non - negative . since the particles ( [ qd ] ) and ( [ d ] ) are interacting , the survival probability is independent , to the first step , of whether the particles are interacting uniformly or deterministically at @ xmath9 . thus for sufficiently short times , @ xmath109 , thethe solution is determined by the problem itself , and some of the boundary conditions are known . as we can see in sec . [ nonstat ] , the following holds for @ xmath17 , and for for @ xmath3 when @ xmath34 . for @ xmath110 , sec . ( [ s3d ] ) reduces to sec . ( [ survivaldecay3 ] ) for the rws . similarly , sec . ( [ qd ] ) and ( [ 3d ] ) for @ xmath111 ^ { - 1 } . \ end { vdrw } \ end { 3d } \ ] ] these time - dependent asymptotics for the ssep yield optimal solutions for the rws , where @ xmath63 and @ xmath112 @ xcite . the optimal solution ( [ qd ] ) and ( [ 3d ] ) , and ( [ qdrw ] ) and ( [ vdrw ] ) , do not satisfy the boundary conditions in time . to satisfy these boundary conditions , the optimal time - dependent solution of the mft ##s must have the ##est solution in time . @ xmath9and @ xmath113 , respectively . the boundary conditions also provide a subleading solution to @ xmath114 . we exploited this technique successfully for the ssep . fig [ 3dthnum ] shows the time complexity obtained by solving the general non - linear mft problem , for a very large @ xmath6 and @ xmath31 . the exact solution is described in fig . [ numeric1d ] . we can see that @ xmath115 remains approximately constant for most of the time and , during these times , fits very well with the theoretical prediction ( [ q3 ] ) . the numerical solution , obtained directly from fig . ( [ actionscaled2 ] ) , is very similar to the theoretical prediction , fig . ( [ s3d ] ) . in the special case of @ xmath18 , exceptions exist . for @ xmath18 , non - linear solutions of the time - independent partial differential equation ( [ fc ] ) converge ##s with @ xmath67 . as a result , a complete numerical solution of fig . ( [ steadyssep ] ) can only be obtained if we arethe solution is @ xmath116 ( to help the distinction , the variables are denoted by @ xmath22 ) : @ xmath117 ##3 , @ xmath118 although there is a small increase of @ xmath99 at @ xmath119 , and decrease of @ xmath96 at @ xmath83 and @ xmath119 , the difference remains constant ( and close to zero ) throughout . the variable @ xmath116 in these cases should be : @ xmath120 : for the two variables it is of the order of the average diffusion coefficient @ xmath22 where the stationary equation changes due to the time - dependent solution . the time the solution has also affects the accuracy of the solution . as a result , viz . ( [ q2 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) are solved with different methods . the same happens @ xcite if one ignores the average , time - dependent solution of the two - variable ( @ xmath121 ) diffusion coefficient ( [ difeq ] ) and solving for the stationary equation @xmath77 for the problem of measuring the total heat flux onto the surface . the corresponding solution is @ xmath122 ^ { - 1 } \ ! ^ { \ ! \ sqrt { p _ t } $ ] with the same numerical solution . for @ xmath123 for @ xmath110 , q . ( [ action2 ] ) reduces to q . ( [ survivaldecay2 ] ) as well . in the discrete - time case , @ xmath26 , the kinetic theory of diffusion - like processes is non - linear . for @ xmath17 the p - stationarity holds , unlike the continuous case , for example @ xmath6 . however , we see that the same results hold in the case of discrete time . for the ssep of t , q . ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) can be written as @ xmath124 , \ begin { qt } \ \ \ partial _ t , & = & - \ partial _ { p } ^ 2 , + ( 1 , - 1 ) ( \ partial _ t \ ) ^ 2 , \ \{ aligned } \ , { aligned } \ ] ] whereas the hamiltonian of ( [ pt ] ) is @ xmath125 \ , and after all of the previous calculations in the ssep and rw , we have @ xmath126 . we then take the three - dimensional space and set the boundary point to @ xmath127 , so that @ xmath128 . we take a single initial state , @ xmath129 and then @ xmath130 . upon computing @ xmath66 , @ xmath2 and @ xmath131 , @ xmath132 etc . ( [ pt ] ) , @ xmath133 and we will have @ xmath134 . we tell the reader that @ xmath54 is directly proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms : when this number goes to zero , @ xmath135 @ xcite . when @ xmath115 and @ xmath136 are equal , we have @ xmath137 where the term for @ xmath138 goes to @ xmath17 . we have been able to solve this problem successfully for the @xmath10 . in the following we see , in the limit of @ xmath110 , when the ssep reduces to rws . based on these results , we can apply the first - order solution of @ xmath10 perturbatively . at the end of this step we solve the problem again for a range of solutions of @ xmath10 . in the limit of @ xmath110 we can solve @ xmath139 , the hamiltonian equation ( [ pt ] ) , and the remaining terms of the mft problem , arriving at the rw solution . as with the problems @ xcite , the mft problem for the rw is solved by the hopf - schwarz equations @ xmath140 and @ xmath141 . this is because , with the above solution , the # ##ians are obtained : @ xmath142 we can solve the diffusion - diffusion equation ( [ pt ] ) , in time , with the initial condition @ xmath143 and the boundary conditions @ xmath144 and @ xmath145 . the solution is @ xmath146 where @ xmath147 , and @ xmat##h148 is the diffusion coefficient . at @ xmath9 we obtain @ xmath149 this value extends the boundary condition for the diffusion coefficient ( [ qt ] ) , in time . the boundary conditions are @ xmath150 and @ xmath151 . the limit of @ xmath152 goes back to @ xmath95 and @ xmath51 , and in the limit of @ xmath135 @ xcite , we obtain @ xmath153 . [ rwquenchedq ] is the density peak of the gas as shown in figure . ( [ qrw ] ) . the next figure shows " density peak " that appears first . also , is the density peak that crosses the phase boundary . to the right of the density peak @ xmath154 is very large , and the expansion is not governed by the diffusion coefficient ( [ difeq ] ) and leads to a slow expansion of the gas . at @ xmath113 we obtain @ xmath155 . we can see , @ xmath156 grows rapidly from @ xmath131 to the @ xmath##131 . at @ xmath157 , however , @ xmath156 is constant in time @ xmath131 , as in the original formula given above . similarly , @ xmath158 , as shown in q . ( [ vrw ] ) , which is the first variation of the time scale . similarly , at @ xmath159 , @ xmath160 consists of q . this same formula holds at @ xmath9 . the character of q at @ xmath127 also holds at @ xmath113 , so @ xmath161 is equivalent to @ xmath162 with an additional prefactor @ xmath135 . to compute the character of @ xmath163 we use @ xmath164 which derives from q . ( [ actionscaled1d ] ) at @ xmath165 . it is more convenient , however , to use the formula ( derived from @ xcite ) which also involves numerical integration . for @ xmath14 this formula reduces to @ xmath166 . \ ] ] for cancelations we use @ x##math167 where @ xmath168 . as a result , @ xmath169 has the same relationship with @ xmath10 and @ xmath2 as in ref . ( [ survivaldecay1 ] ) . the coefficient @ xmath170 , however , is different from the coefficient @ xmath171 except for the same boundary conditions ( see ref . @ xcite , ref . [ app : 1 ] and appendix ) . coefficient ( [ 1dquenched ] ) can also be derived from the exact mathematical expression when the variables are all distributed uniformly in time , see ref . @ xcite and appendix . the corresponding probability density ( [ qt1 ] ) can also be derived from these calculations . now let us go back to the ssep and find the large but stable @ xmath10 . we can make a direct solution @ xmath172 to the equation ( [ actionrw2 ] ) by solving the action @ xmath173 of the ssep hamiltonian ( [ action ] ) perturbatively . for the first term of the equation we have @ xmath174 \ nonumber \ \ & = & \ int_ 0 ^ 2 dt \ int _ 0 ^ { \ infty } dx \ , [ _ 0 ^ 2 ( x , t ) , _ 0 ^ 2 ( x , t ) , \ label { s1a } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath175 and @ xmath176 are the _ _ _ functions , given by the rw equations ( [ qrw ] ) and ( [ vrw ] ) . insert viz . ( [ qrw ] ) and ( [ vrw ] ) into viz . ( [ s1c ] ) we get @ xmath177 ^ 2 , \ label { s1c } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath147 . to obtain the above formula , we first replace the integral of the integral over @ xmath178 by the product of the original integral over @ xmath179 and @ xmath180 . the integral over @ xmath181 reduces to the following distribution : @ xmath182 \ nonumber \ \ & \ ! & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! [ \ ^ { -\ frac { \ left ( x - \ mu _ 2 \ right ) { } ^ 2 } { t } } - e ^ { - \ frac { \ left ( x + \ mu _ 2 \ right ) { } ^ 2 } { t } } \ right ] \ nonumber \ \ & = & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ sqrt { \ frac { \ pi \ , \ ( 1 - 1 ) } { t } } \ , e ^ { - \ frac { \ pi ( \ mu _ 1 + \ mu _ 2 \ right ) { } ^ { ( 1 + 1 ) } { { t } } \ , ( e ^ { \ frac { 1 \ mu _ 1 \ mu _ 2 } { t } } - e ^ { 1 \ mu _ 1 \ mu _ 2 } \ right ) . \ label { intx } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] . we have [ [ @ xmath66 ##3 c . ( [ s1c ] ) : @ xmath183 \ equiv ( ( \ mu _ 1 , \ mu _ 2 ) , \ label { intt } \ end { x } \ ] ] where @ xmath18##4 . the resulting path integral of @ xmath179 and @ xmath180 is solved again to get @ xmath185 where @ xmath186 . then , @ xmath187 we solve the mft problem using a variation of the above algorithm , originally developed by chernykh and stepanov @ xcite for calculating the spatial distribution of the surface temperature gradient in the turbulent flow . variations of this algorithm have been used in the study of mft of the ##s , with and without on - line version @ xcite . the algorithm takes the diffusion - type equation ( [ d1 ] ) forward in time from @ xmath9 to @ xmath113 , and the diffusion - wave - type equation ( [ d2 ] ) backward in time from @ xmath113 to @ xmath9 . as in fig . @ xcite , our version of this algorithm uses an explicit finite element method , which is necessary for the ##s . with the @ xmath10 and @ xmath54 we continued iteration until the ##ization of the solution was reached with a high accuracy . then we fixed @ xmath54 and improved the algorithm until the solution ([ actionscaled2 ] ) up to 1 per second . we also found that , for the @ xmath54 that we found , the energy loss to the system is zero . figure [ ssepnum ] shows an example of our exact solution for the nonlinear initial condition and @ xmath17 . for small and for large @ xmath10 , the energy profile of the system is similar to that for rws , with a rapidly expanding energy peak followed by a density peak . the density peak is smaller than for the rws , and it becomes progressively lower and lower as @ xmath10 approaches @ xmath108 . the theoretically found @ xmath188 is , for large @ xmath131 , the nonlinear solution ( [ sing1d ] ) . figure [ snumeric ] shows the solution for @ xmath189 for the nonlinear initial condition and @ xmath17 . for large @ xmath10 , this is the exact solution with the rw solution ( [ actionrw2 ] ) . for large @ xmath10 , the results agree with the non - linear solution ( [actionweak ] ) . as @ xmath10 continues to grow , @ xmath138 grows more slowly . it will end at @ xmath190 , because in this case @ xmath191 ends with origin at @ xmath2 rather than @ xmath132 , which follows from our numerical calculations . our numerical solution is obtained when @ xmath10 is equal to 1 . the above figure shows the @ xmath192 instead of @ xmath138 and @ xmath193 . a more symmetric 3 - dimensional version of the above method is used for the calculation of the numerical solution for @ xmath31 , shown in fig . [ larged ] . when @ xmath26 , etc . ( [ actionscaled2 ] ) converge to @ xmath195 the resulting path integral is equivalent to the original problem @ xmath189 and the ( symmetric ) _ 3 - dimensional _ solution , @ xmath196 , with the origin at @ xmath197 . because of the rotational symmetry , @ xmath198 is independent of @ xmath##6 . as a result , @ xmath199 = @ xmath200 is equivalent to @ xmath132 , rather than @ xmath2 . in particular , for @ xmath31 @ xmath201 the value of @ xmath18 is a special case , and 2 . ( [ sfast ] ) theorem : @ xmath202 in the flat setting , that we consider here , one chooses the points in the initial state and jumps to them . in the final stage of the process , the initial density profile is chosen from the flat probability distribution corresponding to density @ xmath10 . as a result , the most likely initial density profile , based on the optimal time until density @ xmath2 , is chosen from the uniform distribution @ xmath203 . the term " of interest " here describes the cost of choosing the optimal initial density profile . thus , the optimal probability is greater than the cost for the initial ( optimal ) state , , and the optimal probability for the flat setting is less than for the uniform state . in the mft model , the flat setting is replaced , in one step , by theinitial condition that is a combination of @ xmath204 and @ xmath205 @ xcite : @ xmath206 for the ssep , @ xmath207 and @ xmath208 , this is @ xmath209 } = \ } \ , \ right ( x ) . \ ] ] for the rws , @ xmath207 and @ xmath210 , we have @ xmath211 .

( [ qann ] ) . as in the above setting , it is more efficient to calculate @ xmath138 using fig . ( [ ff ] ) that is also valid in the above setting . the value of the survival function @ xmath213 can be calculated from fig . ( [ freeenergy ] ) . adding to @ xmath213 and @ xmath138 , we find the cancelations @ xmath228 and @ xmath229 with @ xmath230 , in accordance with the expression @ xcite , in the above . to our knowledge , the optimal density profile ( [ qann ] ) that contributes nothing to this .however , has been left out . now we return to the ssep . for @ xmath110 , we can derive a small correction @ xmath231 to the expression @ xmath232 from fig . ( [ s0s1 ] ) . the correction to @ xmath138 is now derived from fig . ( [ s1a ] ) , where @ xmath176 is now given by fig . ( [ vrw ] ) , and @ xmath175 is now given by the previous expression , fig . ( [ qann ] ) . we obtain @ xmath233 the integral over @ xmath131 can be derived by the expression @ xmath234 the second integral over @ xmath66 is evaluated , @ xmath235 and we obtain @ xmath236 there is also a small correction to @ xmath213 that comes from the difference of the variables of the ssep and the rws . we obtain this difference by extending the integrand of fig . ( [ freeenssep ] ) for both @ xmath10 and @ xmath214 , to , and finally ,the general form . the corresponding expression is @ xmath237 ^ 2 = \ frac { ( 0 - \ sqrt { 1 } ) { _ 1 ^ 2 } { \ sqrt { \ } } } , \ ] ] where we have the first - order solution ( [ q0ann ] ) for @ xmath214 . adding to @ xmath238 and @ xmath239 , we now have , for the original setting , @ xmath240 . \ dots { actionweakan } \ to { 1 } \ ] ] the @ xmath241 solution agrees with the results of brown and schtz @ xcite . they solved a similar problem for the ssep , which involved particles moving from the parallel into a non - parallel state . however , that problem can be transformed , even at the initial solution stage , into the particle exchange problem we are dealing with now . as a result , the @ xmath241 correction for the original setting , denoted by q . ( [ actionweakan ] ) , corresponds to the first cumulant of the square of the total number of interacting particles at time @ xmath49 , when theit is solved when @ xmath9 @ xcite . thus , ex . ( [ actionweak ] ) and ( [ actionweakan ] ) show that , in each dimension , the transfer function has different @ xmath10 - values for the empty and empty settings . when @ xmath26 , the @ xmath242 equation for the empty is " an important building block " in two dimensions @ xmath194 . when one finds @ xmath243 these equations are ex . ( [ sfast ] ) and ( [ sfast ] ) , except that the corresponding two - dimensional quantity for the empty setting @ xmath244 is different from the corresponding quantity @ xmath189 for the empty setting . for very small ##sities @ xmath244 is described by ex . ( [ annrw1 ] ) . for large , stable systems it is described by ex . ( [ actionweakan ] ) . for solutions @ xmath10 , it can be solved explicitly . similarly , the steady - state problem ( [ steadyeqgen ] ) can be solved .for example @ xmath245 and @ xmath246 , consider applying our polynomial - time method for @ xmath29 to a certain family of quantum states of n particles . now , by { @ xmath247 } { \ sqrt { \ { [ f ( x ) ] } } \ ] ] we can transform e . ( [ steadyeqgen ] ) into one more second order ordinary differential equation ( ode ) , @ xmath248 whose exact solution is @ xmath249 , \ ] ] where @ xmath250 . from e . ( [ uf ] ) , we obtain a simple second - order equation that can be easily solved . using the boundary conditions @ xmath91 and @ xmath92 to find the corresponding coupling constant , we obtain the solution for @ xmath99 in the form : @ xmath251 this solution holds for all # ##s for which the coefficients of e . ( [ qgeneral ] ) are zero . this gives a limit on the values of @ xmath245 and @ xmath246 and @ xmath252 . for the, for @ xmath253 and @ xmath254 . then the equations vanish for @ xmath255 if and only if @ xmath256 for the ssep and rws ##ep gets @ xmath257 and @ xmath258 . thus , the condition ( [ crit ] ) is satisfied , and the solution ( [ qgeneral ] ) exists . the condition ( [ crit ] ) is also satisfied for the set of linear operators @ xcite . when the solution ( [ qgeneral ] ) exists , the action is simplified up to a nonzero target survival problem . the general expression is the following : @ xmath259 ^ { 2 } , \ label { scaledgeneral } \ label { r } \ ] ] where and . ( [ f ( x ) ] ) and the two - state equation @ xmath85 have been solved in the first place . as a result , @ xmath260 ^ { 2 } . \ ] ] this closed - form equation addresses the target survival problem for a wide range of gas ##eous ##s . it has the same form as above . ( [ survivaldecay##3 ] ) and the @ xmath10 - process which is site - specific . when applied to the rw and ssep , viz . ( [ pgeneral ] ) , viz . ( [ survivaldecay3 ] ) and ( [ actresultd ] ) , viz . for @ xmath18 we obtain , with high probability , the discrete - time [ @ xmath261 ^ { 2 } . \ ] ] . an immediate consequence of the two ##izations ( [ qgeneral ] ) and ( [ pgeneral ] ) , we have the class of short hop processes ( zrp ) . the zrp involves including ( but not including ) other particles in a network : a particle at site @ xmath262 will travel to a neighboring site with a probability @ xmath263 that only depends on the number of particles @ xmath264 at the neighboring site @ xmath262 . hence , @ xmath265 . if @ xmath266 , the zrp is represented at the network level by @ xmath267 and @ xmath268 , ( e . g . fig . 1 ,@ xmath269 . using the results in fig . ( [ qgeneral ] ) , we solve for the probability distribution function : @ xmath270 ^ 2 . \ ] ] . its form , fig . ( [ pgeneral ] ) gives the long - range estimate of the target survival probability for the zrp : @ xmath271 in this case we evaluated the survival probability @ xmath1 of a spherical particle of radius @ xmath0 and a mixture of two spherical particles ( 1 " ) , with radius @ xmath10 , that interact with each other via interactions as predicted by the ssep . we then evaluated the most likely target size , based on the target size until large @ xmath2 . the results depend on the size of the @ xmath3 and on the time scale of @ xmath4 . when @ xmath6 is large and @ xmath7 , @ xmath1 is usually referred to as the effective _ steady _ state of the mean field theory ( mft ) that we studied . for any @ xmath6 , and for any @ xmat##h6 in one dimension , the corresponding mft ##s is non - stationary . in this case @ xmath8 matches up with @ xmath2 , @ xmath0 , @ xmath3 and @ xmath10 , and it also depends on whether the boundary layer is stationary or not . these results ( for large @ xmath6 , and for small @ xmath6 in one dimension ) are quite different in the case of gases : for non - stationary lattice gases . in the special case of @ xmath34 and @ xmath18 , changes to @ xmath1 occur . the [ table1 ] will serve as a useful guide to our experimental results for the survival probability for the ssep in the limits . the long - term asymptotics of the survival probability for the same set of stationary lattice gases for @ xmath7 and @ xmath18 are given by . . ( [ pgeneral ] ) and ( [ pgeneral2d ] ) , and . . @ xmath1 for the ssep in the limits [ parameters = " < , < , < " , parameters = " < " , ] the following##ft gives a simple explanation to the fact that , at @ xmath7 , @ xmath272 scales as @ xmath2 on very small scales , whereas at @ xmath17 ##2 scales as @ xmath132 . the difference in scale is due to the lack or non - existence of a unique optimal solution of the mft problem . in short , the random walk problem opens the doors to the mathematical theory of target survival probability . we are grateful to davide gabrielli for a helpful introduction and to gunter schtz for a thorough review of mr . @ xcite and his contributions to the target survival probability of the ssep in one dimension . both of us ( ft and plk ) thank the galileo galilei institute for theoretical physics for the research and the infn for their support during the course of this work . this work was funded by grant no . 2012145 from the united states ' binational science foundation ( bsf ) . first we construct the models of the target survival probability @ xmath1 for the non - stationary rws in one , two and three dimensions . we show that , for @ xmath17 , @ xmath1 scales on theinitial conditions ( random and random ) . we also note that , for @ xmath18 and @ xmath33 , the first estimate of the value of @ xmath1 is independent of the initial conditions . for @ xmath31 we obtain , both in these calculations and in the mft ##s , the exact result @ xcite for @ xmath1 for the random setting . similarly , we obtain , for @ xmath31 , a more exact result of @ xmath1 for the random setting . after all these calculations we obtain @ xmath126 . we start with the initial conditions and we calculate rws over a small , finite interval @ xmath273 . this rw is in the interval @ xmath274 , where @ xmath275 , with probability @ xmath276 . the probability that this rw will not reach the end ( which is at the end ) until eventually @ xmath2 reaches @ xmath277 . then for all the states at @ xmath9 we calculate the maximum single - digit non - zero probability @ xmath278 for a small @ xmath27##9 we can see that the number of rws in the lattice is equal to @ xmath280 . since all the @ xmath281 particles are present , the probability that one of them hits the target is @ xmath282 ^ { n _ 0l } , \ ] ] which is the @ xmath283 \ & @ xmath284 \ nonumber \ \ & = & \ exp \ ! \ left ( - \ frac { 1 } _ { \ sqrt { 1 } } { \ sqrt { \ right } } \ right ) , \ dot { anmicro } \ dot { 1 } \ ] ] in accordance with ref . and cf . @ xcite . we let the relative values of our rws be known . an example of this case is a simple lattice , with only one particle at each site @ xmath285 of the lattice with each site @ xmath286 . the probability that the particle that is not present at site @ xmath287s does not hit the target until site @ xmath2 [ @ xmath288 $ ] . the probability that none of the particles hits the target is@ xmath289 in the limit we have @ xmath290 we are working in the limit of @ xmath291 , when the unit of length is much larger than the planck constant . the first - order approximation can be obtained by solving the term in ref . ( [ 1 ] ) by solving . now we have a more general expression that also has a pre - exponential factor . we have the expression @ xcite : @ xmath292 , @ xmath293 , and ref . ( [ actionrw2 ] ) . as a result , @ xmath294 the exponential factor is independent of details of the initial initial condition . this agrees with our mft results ( [ 1dquenched ] ) and also from the experimental results , ref . ( [ anmicro ] ) and and ref . @ xcite . the pre - exponential factor is non - negative : it depends on details of the initial condition . this factor is very large , as can be seen if we estimate the spatial distribution of rws at @ xmath9 by placing only the particles in the _ _ _ region at @ xmath##295 , @ xmath296 of the same order as before , with the time coordinate reversed . repeating the process , we arrive at @ xmath297 with the same result as in 1 . ( [ rw : periodic ] ) but a slightly different pre - value . in two dimensions , the probability @ xmath298 that the rw particle at the x of @ xmath299 will actually hit the system at the time @ xmath2 has a more precise value . for the next time series , @ xmath27 , it follows to obtain the following formula that is calculated with arbitrary precision ( for e . g . @ xcite ) : @ xmath300 where @ xmath301 is the inverse correlation function . we then follow the same line of reasoning as in one dimension . for the initial ##ized state we calculate the sum ( [ prob : periodic ] ) of the possible number of the particles in the system @ xmath302 and calculate the maximum single - particle non - zero value @ xmath303 when @ xmath304 , the number of rws in the system is .\ to @ xmath305 . therefore , the probability that the rw hits the target is @ xmath306 ^ { \ pi n _ 0 ( l ^ 2 - l ^ 3 ) } \ \ & & \ to \ exp \ ! \ , [ - \ frac { { \ pi n _ 0 } } { \ ln \ frac { 2 } { \ pi ^ 2 } } \ , \ int _ { ^ \ infty dz \ , \ left ( 0 , 1 ) \ - ] , \ left { - } \ ] ] where we have obtained the proof of this by finding that @ xmath34 and computing the integral of @ xmath283 . from the integral @ xmath307 , we get to . ( [ survivaldecay2 ] ) . in the second case the integral is @ xmath308 \ ] ] the integral is obtained over the conditions @ xmath309 which are equivalent . we find that , for @ xmath9 , there is only one point at the corner of the lattice lattice with the radius @ xmath310 instead of the lattice center of the @ xmat##h0 . we take the values of and , with pre - existing ##s in the first term , expand the series to the second order and solve the equation by dividing by parts of @ xmath34 . we write @ xmath311 , as : 1 . ( [ survivaldecay2 ] ) . that is , in contrast to @ xmath17 , all the second - order series for @ xmath312 for random and all initial locations converge with the result of @ xmath27 . in three dimensions , the probability @ xmath298 that an rw particle at the spherical coordinate @ xmath299 will not hit the target until after @ xmath2 can be obtained by solving the backward diffusion equation ( which is approximately equivalent to the forward diffusion equation ) @ xmath313 leading to @ xmath314 in up to two dimensions , the probability @ takes the following form : @ xmath315 when the initial locations are random , we start with the spherical coordinate @ xmath302 and integrate the initial locations to obtain the expected single - particle target - hit probability @ xmath316 the probability @xmath312 that the rw of the test is verified by @ xmath317 \ nonumber \ \ & & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ to - 4 \ pi n _ 0 ^ \ sqrt { 4t } \ int _ 0 ^ \ infty dr \ , t \ , \ text { erfc } \ ! \ , ( \ frac { x - 1 } { \ sqrt { 4t } } \ right ) \ nonumber \ \ & & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! = - 4 \ pi n _ 0 r \ , \ sqrt { 4t } \ int _ 0 ^ \ infty dx \ , ( x \ sqrt { 4t } + 1 ) \ , \ text { erfc } \ , t \ nonumber \ \ & & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! = - 4 \ pi n _ 0 r \ , [ - 4 \ sqrt { \ right } \ , n _ 0 r ^ { \ sqrt { aligned } , \ text { r } \ ] ] in conjunction with the following @ xcite . com ( [ twoterms ] )is valid for only @ xmath6 . when @ xmath318 , the first term is the leading one and yields sec . with @ xmath31 . in the special case of @ xmath319 there is the second term that is the leading one , and thus yields sec . ( [ sfastan ] ) with @ xmath31 . even for the half - time case , @ xmath318 , sec . ( [ twoterms ] ) is more accurate than the first - order approximation that follows from the steady - state mft formulation . however , the final solution ( [ twoterms ] ) can also be derived from the mft formulation if it is the full time - running problem . the final solution is almost identical to that for @ xmath17 , in sec . [ app : 1 ] , except that sec . ( [ inann ] ) is replaced by @ xmath320 and the jumps of @ xmath131 from @ xmath321 to @ xmath322 are replaced by jumps over the full range of the problem . the calculations are along the lines of sec . [ app :2 ] . the most common probability density function , using the original ( but modified ) definition , is @ xmath323 \ nonumber \ \ & \ \ & \ , \ { 1 - \ frac { r } { 1 } \ , \ begin { erfc } \ , [ \ frac { 1 - r } { \ sqrt { [ ( r - r ) } } \ , ] \ , \ } . \ begin { qann3d } \ , { r } \ ] ] the calculation of the conditional mean probability distribution leads to using the same parameters as in equation . ( [ twoterms ] ) , giving the same result . in the continuous - time solution , @ xmath27 , this distribution is only represented by the variable @ xmath324 . thus this integral ( [ qann3d ] ) can be written , subject to some modifications , as @ xmath325 , which agrees with the initial value ( [ qdrw ] ) for @ xmath31 . the corrections from the steady - state limit are used for the second term on the right - hand side of equation . ( [ twoterms ] ) , which is a sublea##ding ##le in this case . in the second case the following result , similar to that of @ xmath121 , comes close to that the [ @ xmath326 . \ ] ] is the integral as obtained from the mft . for @ xmath27 , we reduce the integral to the second term and arrive at @ xmath327 the second term agrees with that for the original function , etc .
