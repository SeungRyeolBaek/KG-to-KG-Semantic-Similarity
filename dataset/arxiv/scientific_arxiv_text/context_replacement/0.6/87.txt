( note that @ xmath183 is the subgroup generated by @ xmath184 ; the diagram of @ xmath183 is derived from the diagram of @ xmath4 by placing it on the upper left . ) we shall also often use the fact that if @ xmath185 and @ xmath186 are character - free , then @ xmath89 is also character - free . if @ xmath187 and @ xmath188 then the characters from this case also are character - free characters . they correspond to our case ( a1 ) . if then it follows from comparison with smith s rule and pieri s rule that @ xmath##189 so , for @ xmath55 in this case , @ xmath190 is scale - free unless @ xmath31 contains @ xmath191 . when @ xmath31 it is also shown that @ xmath192 is _ scale - free , and if @ xmath37 is one of the first two index @ xmath30 - groups of @ xmath193 , containing @ xmath194 and @ xmath195 , then @ xmath89 _ is _ scale - free . this includes the odd characters in our case ( a1 ) and the even in case ( a2 ) . if @ xmath2 is odd then we have to deal with all the groups from saxl in case ( b1 ) . if @ xmath47 is even then we also have to deal with the groups of @ xmath196 , and @ xmath197 . the work done to show that all these groups are scale - free is ; they are in our case ( b2 ) . there are the index @ xmath30 groups of @ xmath49 , @ @ xmath51 , @ x##math198 and nothing else , which we shall call order @ xmath199 . figure 1 below shows the types of groups we will consider ; note that they are in bijection with the definition of the dihedral group of order @ xmath200 .

( in the canonical decomposition above , young s rule can be combined with the young s rule : see ( * ? ? ? * . 2 ) . ) however , if @ xmath37 is a subgroup of @ xmath51 , then @ xmath219 is not identity - free . then one finds that the first character induced from @ xmath202 is not identity - free , but the one induced from @ xmath198and @ xmath199 ##9 . this is the first identity for our group ( b2 ) . we now turn to saxl # ##n ( n ) . the characters @ xmath220 for @ xmath221 are : @ xmath222 - homogeneous . ( it follows from young s rule and figure 2 that this is a sufficient condition for the induced characters @ xmath223 to have order - 1 for all @ xmath2 . ) they are : the @ xmath30 - homogeneous frobenius group @ xmath224 ; the @ xmath32 - homogeneous subgroup @ xmath225 ; and the @ xmath32 - homogeneous subgroup @ xmath150 - homogeneous subgroup @ xmath226 . here @ xmath69 is the homogeneous subgroup of @ xmath227 generated by the character @ xmath32 frobenius group @ xmath228 . then the young s rule shows that the induced characters @ xmath229 are all zero - dimensional . a simple way to solve these problems is the group automorphism of @ xmath230 : if @ x##math231 is a single element of @ xmath230 , and @ xmath10 is mapped by an induced automorphism of @ xmath230 to a point , corresponding to @ xmath232 . examination of the entire sequence of @ xmath230 shows that the constituent @ xmath233 of @ xmath234 is mapped to the constituent @ xmath235 of @ xmath236 . since @ xmath237 is mapped from @ xmath238 to @ xmath64 , the character derived from @ xmath64 can only be obtained by checking . the first character from saxl , ##n ( n ) is @ xmath239 which is of length - 1 . we find a way to obtain this character . we first check that @ xmath240 , and that , @ xmath3 appears in @ xmath241 if and only if @ xmath242 exists . by checking [ 1 : tworow ] , either of @ xmath243 , @ xmath244 , or their combination , appears in @ xmat##h5 . from the equation @ xmath245 and frobenius , one has that @ xmath246 where @ xmath247 if @ xmath248 , and @ xmath249 otherwise . ( since @ xmath69 = @ xmath150 - cycles , it does not matter which type @ xmath250 we use . ) then @ xmath251 . the subgroup @ xmath227 has a finite conjugacy class of cycles of odd order ; these are periodic , and since @ xmath227 is not @ xmath32 - cycles , they all come with the form @ xmath252 . clearly @ xmath253 . it follows from the equation @ xmath254 for @ xmath255 , that the first n - cycle that appears when we change @ xmath227 to @ xmath69 is @ xmath60 . hence , @ xmath150 - cycles appear in the canonical form of the combination of @ xmath69 , and @ xmath256 . therefore , starting from @ xmath25##7 and @ xmath258 , the first hook character to appear in @ xmath5 is @ xmath259 . we then have @ xmath260 where @ xmath165 has degree @ xmath261 . with the exception of @ xmath262 ( which has degree @ xmath263 ) and the characters @ xmath264 , @ xmath265 ( all of them @ xmath266 ) , all the hook characters of @ xmath267 that are not allowed to appear in @ xmath165 have too high a degree . if @ xmath262 occurs three times , then we would have @ xmath268 ; the other four values can be checked by hand , and printed in ( * ? ? ? * # 2 . 2 ) . finally , @ xmath69 contains all characters of degree @ xmath59 , so that @ xmath269 . 7 occurs . it is possible to prove using the algorithm @ xmath270 and pieri - 1 that , in @ xmath271 , the characters @ xmath272 and @ xmath##273 is also norm - free . this gives the result in our case ( ii ) . it remains to deal with saxl s case ( iii ) : inclusion of of index @ index @ xmath150 . by the work of inglis , wilson and saxl , @ xmath274 is norm - free . however , this subgroup is called norm - free if we apply addition to @ xmath216 , since @ xmath275 where the sum is over all elements @ xmath4 of @ xmath276 with only one identity element . we then remove @ xmath70 from saxl s case ( iv ) . this gives our case ( v ) . it then also remains to look at the normal subgroup of @ xmath70 . let @ xmath10 be the maximal normal subgroup of @ xmath70 of index @ xmath30 and the proper subgroup @ xmath277 . a simple calculation shows that , in @ xmath278 , the subgroup @ xmath279 is the normal subgroup of @ xmath70 of index @ xmath150 . this subgroup is not in @ xmath70 ,and the index index @ xmath280 is equivalent to @ xmath281 . it follows that there are three copies of index @ xmath30 ##0 @ xmath70 , in @ xmath282 , @ xmath283 , and one more , which we shall call index @ xmath284 . the data structure is shown in figure 1 below .

[ see : selfdual ] let @ xmath83 denote the ring of prime powers @ xmath93 . if @ xmath37 is a subset of @ xmath1 such that the integer of @ xmath381 is not - 1 then all the summands of @ xmath91 are self - dual . _ for example , we assume that @ xmath83 is the field with @ xmath93 elements . let @ xmath86 denote the indecomposable direct summand of @ xmath91 . let @ xmath382 denote the ring of @ xmath93 - adic integers . since @ xmath86 is a direct summand of a - module , we can restrict @ xmath86 to an @ xmath383 - module @ xmath38##4 states that @ xmath384 is a direct summand of @ xmath385 and @ xmath386 . ( see @ xcite for an example of this elimination algorithm . ) suppose that @ xmath86 is not self - dual . then the identity character @ xmath384 is not self - dual either . since @ xmath387 is self - dual , we also have a summand @ xmath388 of @ xmath387 such that @ xmath389 . since @ xmath384 and @ xmath388 are non - dual , they are direct summands of @ xmath387 . thus @ xmath384 and @ xmath390 have the same identity character . this supports our assumption that the character @ xmath381 is square - free . @ xmath353 this section starts with the statement of this general form [ 1 : 1 ] . this can also be used to explain the reference to the letter . ##j . phil ##o ( * ? ? ? * . 5 . 5 . 5 ) . the statement of theorem ##s of @ xcite. . , we shall now get into the habit of assuming that the induced module @ xmath91 is a specht module , and trying to prove that the same result holds for each of its summands . since in theorem [ a : mod ] we assume that our local ring @ xmath83 is locally closed and of degree @ xmath391 , we can use the universal algebra approach taken by hemmer and nakano in @ xcite . ( for an alternative , but more general approach , see the paper attributed to a . suzuki at the time of proof of @ xcite . ) we are now trying to prove theorem [ a : mod ] . from the results of hemmer and nakano @ xcite , when @ xmath88 , the characters of the modules in the specht module are well - defined . so it follows to show that each of the induced modules in theorem [ a : mod ] is a specht character , with the specht ##s replaced by their real roots . we start with the result following from statement ( 1 ) of theorem [ a : mod ] . suppose that @ xmat##h392 . since the residue of @ xmath83 has odd characteristic , @ xmath393 also follows from theorem [ theorem : sgnfilt ] and theorem [ theorem : jamesyoung ] that each of the two summands has two specht representations . theorem [ theorem : summands ] also states that _ the _ indecomposable summand of @ xmath394 has a specht representation . this agrees with all the representations of in case ( a1 ) , and with the representation of @ xmath196 in case ( b2 ) . now suppose that @ xmath45 . we can assume that @ xmath395 where @ xmath206 is the @ xmath26 - th representation of @ xmath49 . by 2 . 2 . then all of the summands have a specht representation . ( so it is true that @ xmath83 has odd characteristic : see 2 . 2 for an example when @ xmath83 has characteristic @ xmath30 . ) it follows that @ xmath396 and @ xmath397 both have specht2 . finally , if @ xmath37 is any subgroup of @ xmath49 of type @ xmath150 then @ xmath398 is in this case a direct summand of @ xmath399 , and so has a specht decomposition . and if @ xmath37 is any subgroup of @ xmath215 such that @ xmath46 , then @ xmath400 has a specht decomposition . by theorem [ th : jamesyoung ] , @ xmath401 also has a specht decomposition . these results agree with all the other cases in case ( b ) . in cases ( c ) and ( d ) , a large amount of work was done for proof of # ##s of @ xcite , which shows that @ xmath402 has a specht decomposition . by theorem [ th : jamesyoung ] , @ xmath403 also has a specht decomposition . the proof given in fig . 3 shows that @ xmath404 we can also apply theorem [ theorem : sgnfilt ] and theorem [ theorem : summands ] to thethat the summands of the right - hand side are specht modules . this also fails to deal with the problems arising from equation ( 2 ) . using our above argument , together with the argument taken from [ by : jamesyoung ] , one is to show that for @ xmath63 , @ xmath60 , @ xmath61 , @ xmath405 is a specht module . this is true if @ xmath406 , and since the @ xmath378 - module is a direct sum of specht modules . the following arguments turn out to be very simple . if @ xmath407 and @ xmath408 are @ xmath409 , the specht modules corresponding to the non - zero algebraic elements of @ xmath410 are simple and projective . for @ xmath411 when @ xmath407 and @ xmath412 we have that since @ xmath69 does not contain algebraic elements of , @ xmath59 , @ xmath413 is projective . it is also known ( via @ xcite ) that every projective module for the fundamental group .a specht module . the simplest example such is when @ xmath414 and @ xmath412 . one follows from that each individual projective representation of the @ xmath415 is in a single @ xmath416 - module of @ xmath267 , and that the only non - projective representations are the identity and identity elements . in @ xmath417 this is the result of theorem [ 1 : 1 ] .

( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 12 . 2 ) ) , @ xmath419 always appears at the top of @ xmath422 . however , @ xmath419 appears at the top of @ xmath423 if and only if @ xmath424 appears at the top of @ xmath425 ; this is also ruled out by ( * ? ? ? * theorem 12 . 2 ) . the same result holds for @ xmath426 . by , we can define the two -and @ xmath427 , by the term @ xmath428 introduced by hamernik in ( * ? ? ? * p449 ) to show that @ xmath429 contains @ xmath419 in its ring , but not in its top . ( hamernik works only with simple modules of finite type , but it is possible to extend this part of his proof to work with non - specht modules for @ xmath84 whenever the top of @ xmath83 contains @ xmath2 : and @ xcite . ) not all of the other specht modules contain @ xmath419 as a submodule . the proof fails . it fails to show that @ xmath419 is in the ring of @ xmath371 . for this we shall need the following proof , which is of completely trivial form .
