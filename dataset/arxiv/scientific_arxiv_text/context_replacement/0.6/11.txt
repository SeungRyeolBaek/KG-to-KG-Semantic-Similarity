social systems such as fish schools , bird colonies , ant colonies , and wasp colonies @ xcite have body shapes determined by the group members interacting with each other and with their environment . the _ social _ interactions , _ i . e . _ , those of individuals , _ involve individuals reacting to each other in an attractive or hostile way @ xcite when they approach each other either directly via touch , sight , smell , taste , or indirectly via vibrations , vibrations , or other signals . the standard model approach is to model each individual as a physical object whose shape is determined by the ( interparticle ) positive and negative forces @ xcite . in contrast , the _ environmental _ interactions involve each individual in response to the environment , for example a response to light , food , a heat source , a light source , a water source , or a pathogen . the interaction of social and environmental forces can lead to different body shapes ; these two conditions form the basis of our current model . more specifically , our model is evident in our recent experimental study of the _ _ ant _ schistocerca gregaria _ @ xcite . among the other ##izations of our model ( see below ) ,they self - organize into groups with a unique structure , forming a swarm - like structure with a large swarm of flies on the ground and a small group of flies above ; see figure [ fig : swarm ] ( bc ) . the groups are separated by an air gap . with wings , the swarm moves with a rolling motion . flies at the top of the swarm fly off and land on the ground . flies on the ground , when approached by the flying swarm , fly off and join the flying swarm ; see figure [ fig : swarm ] ( bc ) . the phenomenon of the air gap and the rolling motion are important in the life in @ xcite . as we will see in this picture , properties of swarm such as large ##ness and small ##ness ( that is , the movement of particles ) appear as examples of behavior in a mathematical model of swarm . the model of @ xcite is [ fig : swarm ] @ xmath1 which includes @ xmath2 and flies with wings @ xmath3 . the direction of the swarm movement is highly correlated with the direction of the wind @ xcite and causes a rolling motion .the wind direction , in the model is three - dimensional , _ i . e . _ , @ xmath4 where the @ xmath5 coordinate is aligned with the general direction of the wind and @ xmath6 is the second coordinate . since the movement of the wind is not a function of time , the model describes mechanical forces . this so - called kinematic model is common in mechanical physics , and we discuss it further in the [ 2 : discretemodel ] . the first term on the left - hand side of ( [ sec : 1 ] ) describes gravitational forces ; @ xmath7 describes the force that predator @ xmath8 has on prey @ xmath9 . the first term of @ xmath7 describes force , which operates with force @ xmath10 over a length scale @ xmath11 and is responsible for aggregation . the second term is weak , and operates more slowly and over a larger length scale in order to avoid aggregation . time and space are chosen so that the force strength and length scale are known . the third term on the right - hand side of ( [ sec : 2 ] ) describes attraction , andand with speed @ xmath12 . the second model assumes movement of organisms in the direction of the wind with speed @ xmath13 . however , the model assumes a relatively flat surface . since organisms grow and move while stationary , their motion in that direction is stationary compared to their motion on the ground . now we return to ( [ e : wind ] ) the fact that only organisms whose relative velocity is assumed to be constant , ( [ e : wind ] ) are stationary . as mentioned above , for some organisms , ( [ e : wind ] ) forms a bubble - like structure . this can occur only in the absence of wind , that is , when @ xmath14 ; see figure [ 1 : 1 ] ( below ) . the bubble is stable , for it is the state to form in the presence of wind . as mentioned in @ xcite , organisms which form a bubble in the presence of wind do not roll in the presence of wind . conditions for bubble formation , as for the equilibrium conditions derived from the above model , have not been determined ; we will discuss this further . some other organisms use a similar model as in our previous .and because of the easy access to experimental data . a major advantage is that simulation of biological systems is straightforward , requiring only the solution of ordinary differential equations . however , since many systems contain many individuals , the resulting multi - dimensional system of differential equations can be difficult or impossible to solve . also , for very complex systems , simulation , while simple , can be a challenge . continuum models are well suited to simulation . a well - known continuum model is that of @ xcite , a linear integrodifferential model solving for a system with density @ xmath15 in one - dimension : @ xmath16 the density @ xmath17 is the power law , and @ xmath18 is the interaction vector , which is obtained via comparison with the antisymmetric pairwise interaction of @ xmath19 , the one - dimensional solution of the social interaction like the one above ( [ ref : 1 ] ) . the continuum model ( [ ref : introeq ] ) has at least two interaction types as described in @ xcite . they can converge to a maximum , reach a maximum fitness level , and collapse . in @ xcite , we have solutions for the social interactionallow @ xmath19 for this behavior to occur . these interactions lead to a ` ` phase diagram ' ' dividing free space into regions associated with this behavior . these phase diagrams come from the free space model @ xcite and its continuum counterpart @ xcite . models that show the antisymmetry of @ xmath19 ( show an inverse relationship of forces to each other ) show more complex phenomena , like collapse through @ xcite . several models have described conditions under which the system collapses to a given point . in the two - dimensional case , collapse occurs when the force @ xmath19 is strong and constant at short distances @ xcite . the same situation in three dimensions also leads to collapse @ xcite . one can also consider the case when the solution contains an additional component of an external force , @ xmath20 in this case , the system composed of pairs of quasi - masses will be continuously and nonlinearly unstable , except for the forces @ xmath19 that are constant at short distances @ xcite . these conditions can lead to the question of whether the process can be continued beyond the point at which the system collapses . further , as a special case of ( [ ref : .##eq ] ) . the answer is no @ xcite . for ( [ e : introeq ] ) itself an infinite time , there is no alternative solution to the theory of no @ xcite . most of the classical solutions discussed above are biological solutions . however , there may be other solutions as well . for non - biological @ xmath19 , the corresponding classical steady states are bounded in energy , as shown via the variational properties of the steady state solution @ xcite . however , these solutions are non - biological , since they have infinite mass . there also exist non - biological @ xmath19 which give rise to weakly - supported classical steady states of infinite mass . for example , in terms of ( [ e : introeq ] ) , we have classical steady state solutions consisting of weakly supported solutions with fixed points at the vertices of the solution @ xcite . using our classical approach , we can find solutions that have both mechanical and biological components . some of the solutions discussed above are obtained by studying the internal s - matrix of ( [ e : introeq2 ] ) . there is an energy solution @ xmath21 = \ frac{ 1 } { 2 } \ int _ \ mathbb { r } \ int _ \ mathbb { r } \ , ( x ) \ , ( y ) [ ( x - y ) \ , dx \ , \ + \ int _ \ mathbb { r } q ( x ) \ , ( y ) \ , dx , \ ] ] which is invariant under the transformations . this energy can be considered as the upper limit of the quantum pairwise energy of the classical swarm ( quantum ) energy @ xcite . we can then use this energy to find quantum systems and test their stability . in this case , we focus on dynamics of swarm and ask the following questions : * what kind of density distributions do swarm ##s have ? are they classical or quantum ? * how are the same density distributions not affected by weak forces , strong forces , interactions , and the combinations of these ? * how well do classical and quantum swarm systems resemble each other ? to answer these questions , we use a simple mathematical model for simple , continuous swarm ##s in one - dimensional , not subject to strong forces . we then choose the appropriate continuum model and use variational methods toas minimizers of this value . this method allows solution of the fredholm ##ian equation for the system . for certain classes of external forces , we are able to find exact solutions . but unfortunately , they are not necessarily exact . in fact , they often involve @ xmath0 - 1 values of forces at the domain boundary . the rest of this section is structured as follows . in section [ sec : dynamics ] , we outline the general framework for our model , and the requirements for a given density distribution to be in equilibrium state , and to be sensitive to certain classes of forces . in sections [ sec : dynamics ] and [ sec : equilibrium ] , we study two types of swarm models via dynamics . in section [ sec : dynamics ] , we build on the classical swarm model . we consider a closed domain with no external forces , a straight - line subject to external forces , and an open domain subject to a purely external force , applying them to any physical , chemical , or biological species . for all three cases , we find exact solutions for the equations . for the first two cases , these solutions consist of a density distribution that is constant across theoutside of the boundary , it is @ xmath0 - 1 at the boundary . for the first example , the model is weakly supported with the energy decreasing discontinuously to zero at the boundary of the swarm . for all three examples , we apply the solutions from the above approximation to equilibria arising from the dynamics of the same discrete swarm . the solutions converge but only for small numbers of discrete swarm ##s . section [ sec : destructive ] is similar to section [ sec : constructive ] , but we also consider the more complicated behavior of swarm ##s that are destructive over short time scales and destructive over long scales ; these behaviors are common for many biological systems . in section [ sec : swarm - like ] , we consider discrete swarm , based on their swarm - like behavior as described above , and on the effects of gravity . in a two - dimensional model corresponding to a single example of a simple discrete swarm under the influence of gravitational forces and gravity , the minimizers may have groups of individuals on the top and a group of individuals on the ground , but there will never be any interaction between the two groups . however , a non - two - dimensional model allowing for the dynamics of the swarmthe biological swarm ##s , by contrast , have minimizers which roughly correspond to the natural swarm - like structures . positions @ xmath2 models model particles ( particles ##s ) in one spatial space with positions @ xmath22 . assume that gravity is described by the ##ian ##s , and that acceleration is proportional to the product of the drag and motive forces . we then focus on the case where the acceleration is linear and the drag coefficient is proportional to the acceleration . this approach is useful when motive forces involve mach , also known in fluid dynamics as the low mach term or slow mach term . in the scientific community , the following equations , which are first - order in nature , are used . _ kinematic equations have been used in many models of individual and group behavior , see @ xcite ) . we can construct a mixed model with both motive and drag forces , consistent with the above model ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) . the motive forces are for individuals and also include mutual attraction and competition ; see @ xcite for further details . for example , we assume that the motive forces act in an additive , pairwise fashion . we also assume that the forces are additive ,that is , the force induced by particle @ xmath9 on particle @ xmath8 is the opposite of that induced by particle @ xmath8 on particle @ xmath9 . these forces can include gravity , gravity , and force towards food or water . the governing equations take the form [ q : discretesystem ] @ xmath23 . we now have the governing equations for the continuous limit of the discrete limit . to this end , we have introduced the _ social force _ @ xmath24 which reduces the magnitude of the social force so as to be constant for @ xmath25 . @ xmath26 is the total potential mass of the system . ( [ q : vee ] ) define the potential as ; @ xmath27 is the social force one particle has on another , and @ xmath28 is the social force . from our theory of dynamics of social forces , @ xmath19 is positive and in most extreme cases is zero at the origin . the term , @ xmath28 and @ xmath19 , can be written as the negative of the term is the first order term of integ##rability . as pointed out in @ xcite , many of the other models for mutual interaction forces presented in the literature satisfy this condition . many other forces like gravity and some forms of friction do so as well . under this condition , we write ( [ t : discretesystem ] ) as a continuous function , @ xmath29 where the potential @ xmath30 is [ t : p _ 1 ] @ xmath31 the double sum describes the gradient forces and the single sum describes the gradient forces . thus , @ xmath32 is the mutual interaction force , which is zero , and @ xmath33 is the gradient force . the flow described above ( [ t : discretegradient1 ] ) will tend towards minimizers of the potential @ xmath30 . up to now , we have formulated the flow as @ xmath34 . in order to restrict the flow to a special case @ xmath35 , we can use the convention of having the gradient of @ xmath33 go to zero in the domain of @ xmath35 . thus this alternative formulation is useful from a mathematical and physical perspective , .is easy to solve . first , we will use the discrete model of ( [ see : discretesystem ] ) . this continuum model will allow us to calculate boundary conditions and understand their effects via the calculus of variations and differential equation theory . to use the continuum model , we start by modeling our own universe of elementary particles with a density of @ xmath15 corresponding to the number of @ xmath0 - functions . ( for simplicity , we use the @ xmath36 value of @ xmath17 in the following equation . ) our model here is similar to @ xcite . these @ xmath0 - functions have values @ xmath24 and are located at the origin of the universe : @ xmath37 the total density is @ xmath38 where @ xmath39 is the mass of the particle . then ( [ see : deltafuncs ] ) , we define the discrete velocity @ xmath40 in terms of the continuous velocity @ xmath41 . that is , we have @ xmath42 where @ xmath43 by conservation of energy , the density is @ xmath44 with the zero remaining at the origin . we also have the total density@ xmath45 $ ] which is equivalent to the discrete potential @ xmath30 = ( [ q : delta _ s ] ) : @ xmath46 = \ frac { t } { 0 } \ int _ { { \ omega } } \ int _ { { \ omega } } \ right ( x ) \ left ( y ) f ( x - y ) \ , dx \ , \ + \ int _ { { \ omega } } f ( x ) \ left ( y ) \ , dx . \ ] ] this equation follows from the discrete potential , @ xmath21 = [ { { \ cal { t } } } ( x _ m , \ ldots , x _ n ) , \ ] ] and the @ xmath0 - 1 form of the potential ( [ q : deltafuncs ] ) . the coefficient of mass transfer is @ xmath47 } { dt } = - \ int _ \ , \ left ( x ) \ , \ { f ( x ) \ , \ } ^ { \ , dx , \ ] ] where we see that there is no mass transfer at the origin of @ xmath35 .a consequence of this boundary condition is that under these conditions , we can be on the boundary of the domain , and we can also see this above . since energy is conserved , we see that these distributions correspond to minimizers of @ xmath48 . note also that the energy ( [ q : continuum _ energy ] ) is defined for _ _ _ _ distribution @ xmath17 , and for all of @ xmath0 - functions . we can find minimizers for the total energy ( [ q : continuum _ energy ] ) and see that they add up to the same value in the case of s @ xmath2 . to find a relation between the two distributions , consider the density function @ xmath49 with invariant ##s @ xmath26 . consider the cumulative density function @ xmath50 where the radial distribution @ xmath51 is located to the left of the center of @ xmath49 . we have a compact ensemble of @ xmath2 @ xmath0 - functions , @ xmath52 the resulting cumulative density function @ xmath53 = @ xmath54 & i = s _ 0 , \ , n = \ , \ ldots , \ \\ \ m & x _ i < n < x _ { n + 1 } , \ i n = 1 , \ ldots , n - 1 \ \ m & n > x _ i , \ pi { n } \ ] ] where we have used the fact that sums up to the @ xmath0 - function gives twice the number of particles in ensemble . to complete our correspondence , we find that @ xmath55 , which in turn gives the cumulative density @ xmath22 . for @ xmath25 for for @ xmath26 , this value of @ xmath53 sums up to @ xmath56 . the correspondence goes in the opposite direction as before . we can start with an example of @ xmath0 - function @ xmath57 looking at the distribution of the ensemble particles , as shown in [ [ fig : x _ 1 ] ( right ) . we then find the corresponding cumulative density @ xmath53 via ( [ fig : psid ] ) and proceed to obtain the corresponding cumulative density @ xmath56 . the parameters @ xmath53 and @ xmath56 are represented by the red x - curve and the blue curve , respectively ,see figure [ fig : delta _ tree ] ( c ) . we can also try to give an example @ xmath49 , as shown in figure [ fig : delta _ tree ] ( c ) . we use this correspondence between the [ sec : tree ] and [ sec : tree - 1 ] to compare numerical simulations for the continuous system ( [ fig : pde ] ) with numerical simulations of the discrete system ( [ fig : discretesystem ] ) . we end this section by showing that we have made a distinction between the continuous and discrete systems . we use the continuum framework to determine initial conditions , via variational and continuum problem solving . the example below is a direct comparison to numerical simulations of the discrete system . we use the variational framework to determine conditions for the probability density to be a minimizer of @ xmath48 . our starting point is the energy constraint ( [ fig : energy _ energy ] ) corresponding to the mass constraint ( [ fig : mass _ energy ] ) . here @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 is an equilibrium solution of mass @ xmath26 and @ xmath60 is a equilibrium solution of constant mass ,first we define @ xmath61 . by the models of interest , we focus on domains with finite support and define the support of @ xmath59 to be a proper subset of the support @ xmath35 . we point to the support of @ xmath59 on @ xmath62 . this definition , together with the fact that the support is finite , allows the support @ xmath63 to be contained in @ xmath64 , the support of @ xmath62 . we have @ xmath65 = [ [ { { \ bar \ bar } } ] + \ , w _ 1 [ { { \ bar \ bar } } , { { \ bar \ bar } } ] + \ epsilon ^ 2 w _ 2 [ { { \ bar \ bar } } , { { \ bar \ bar } } ] , \ ] ] where @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 are the first and second powers respectively . this definition is useful because @ xmath48 is contained in @ xmath17 ( see ref . [ 1 : w _ 1 ] ). we use these properties to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a global variation @ xmath59 to be a minimizer of @ xmath48 . our approach is to consider two classes of variations @ xmath63 . first , we consider variations whose inclusion is in @ xmath62 . in order for @ xmath59 to be extremal , @ xmath66 must exist . for this to be a minimizer , @ xmath67 must be local . since ( [ x : x _ x ] ) is constant , @ xmath68 implies that @ xmath59 is both a local and a global with respect to this second class of variations . the second class of variations we consider ( of which the first class is a local ) consists of variations in the fundamental domain @ xmath39 . as mentioned above , these variations must be contained in @ xmath64 in order to guarantee convergence of @ xmath17 . the necessary condition for @ xmath59 to be a global minimizer is that @ xmath69 for this case of .##s . if the fact @ xmath67 is true for this larger class of particles , then @ xmath59 is a mass minimizer as well . we obtain the second variation @ xmath66 by transforming ( [ e : expand _ e ] ) into ( [ f : expand _ f ] ) and returning to first variation for @ xmath70 , which yields @ xmath71 = \ int _ \ omega { { \ left \ right } } \ , [ \ int _ \ omega { ( x - 1 ) { { \ left \ right } } ( x ) \ , [ + q ( x ) \ , ] \ , dx . \ ] ] for the larger class of particles , whose origin is at @ xmath62 . since the particle @ xmath63 is null and of zero mass , for the first variation @ xmath66 to hold , it must be known that @ xmath72 the same particle can be described by the lagrange point , with the zero mass as a constant . the particle @ xmath73 has a unique form ; it isthe energy per particle of the experimental test particle would be proportional to the energy density and the interaction with @ xmath59 . thus , , we have shown that the necessary condition for @ xmath59 to be an optimal solution is that they satisfy the fredholm differential equation of the first kind for the energy density @ xmath59 , @ xmath74 = \ lambda - q ( y ) , \ left { \ cal ##c } [ { { \ bar \ lambda } } ( y ) ] \ equiv \ int _ { { \ int _ { { { \ bar \ lambda } } } } } , ( x - y ) { { \ bar \ lambda } } ( y ) \ , \ , \ { { f : fie } \ ] ] as well as the second constraint ( [ f : mass1 ] ) . in order for @ xmath59 to be a minimizer with respect to the first set of constraints , the time constant must be constant . transforming ( [ f : expand _ w ] ) into ( [ f : expand _ w ] ) , @ xmath75 = \ int _ { {\ int _ { { { \ bar \ bar } } } } } \ int _ { { { \ omega _ { { { \ bar \ bar } } } } } } [ ( x - y ) { { \ bar \ bar } } ( x ) { { \ bar \ bar } } ( y ) \ , dx \ , \ . \ ] ] the properties of @ xmath67 can be obtained in a number of ways . we can put a lower bound on the fourier transform of @ xmath32 for @ xmath67 to be useful for the first set of applications . using the fourier transform @ xmath76 ##7 we obtain @ xmath77 & = & \ int _ { { \ omega _ { { { \ bar \ bar } } } } } \ int _ { { { \ omega _ { { { \ bar \ bar } } } } } } q ( x - y ) { { \ bar \ bar } } ( x ) { { \ bar \ bar } } ( y ) \ , dx \ , \ , \ \ & = & \ int _ { -\ infty } ^ { \ infty } \ int _ { - \ infty } ^ { \ infty } | ( x - y ) { { \ center \ right } } ( x ) { { \ center \ right } } ( x ) \ , dx \ , y , \ \ & = & \ int _ { - \ infty } ^ { \ infty } { { \ center \ right } } ( x ) \ , [ q ( x ) * { { \ center \ right } } ( x ) \ , ] \ , dx , \ \ & = & \ frac { 1 } { - \ } } \ int _ { - \ infty } ^ { \ infty } | \ widehat { { { \ center \ right } } } ( x ) | ^ { \ widehat { - } ( x ) ~ dk . \ { { - } \ ] ] we have used the fact that @ xmath63 is randomly generated to take the dimension of q to 1 . we have also used the following theorem , parseval ##ity theorem , and the fact that@ xmath63 does not . we see , however , that @ xmath78 has a sufficient condition for @ xmath68 ( as a nontrivial condition ) . as stated in @ xcite , this condition is roughly equivalent to that for the time evolution of a linear wave function in the absence of random variables . the necessary and sufficient condition for @ xmath68 for the following types of systems follows from considering the properties of @ xmath79 and @ xmath62 . note that ( [ 1 : 1 _ step ] ) can be written as @ xmath80 = \ int _ { { \ int _ { { { \ bar \ } } } } } } { \ cal i } [ { { \ bar \ } } } ] { { \ bar \ } } } ( 1 ) \ , dx \ equiv \ langle { { \ bar \ } } } , { \ cal i } [ { { \ bar \ } } } ] \ rangle , \ ] ] where the square brackets represent the \ @ xmath81 inner product \ @ xmath6##2 . if the coefficients of the integral equation @ xmath79 are equal , then @ xmath68 ( again , a nontrivial solution ) . we then refer to the following set of operators , which have support in @ xmath39 and which are not in @ xmath64 . to solve these equations , we extend the definition of the operator @ xmath73 to a function @ xmath82 that is valid for all of @ xmath35 . we compute @ xmath83 directly from ( [ q : lagrange ] ) , @ xmath84 for @ xmath85 . we then compute the integral equation @ @ xmath86 = \ int _ { { \ omega } } { { \ omega \ omega } } ( x ) \ omega ( x ) \ , dx , \ ] ] directly from ( [ q : x _ x ] ) . given that @ xmath87 supports @ xmath64 and that @ xmath63 has no support in @ xmath39 , we find that a necessary and sufficient condition for @ xmat##h69 = @ xmath88 = @ xmath64 , that is @ xmath89 . , this means that the unit of mass transferred from @ xmath62 to its surroundings is the total mass . if we need for @ xmath59 to be a minimizer with respect to the first class of solutions , that is for @ xmath68 ( for example , for example @ xmath78 ) . however , this condition is not satisfied . the only condition is that @ xmath90 + f _ { [ { { \ omega \ omega } } , { { \ omega \ omega } } ] > [ $ ] for nontrivial solutions , which follows from ( [ e : f _ 1 ] ) is true . to illustrate , we have solved the following equations : * the solutions @ xmath59 satisfy the fredholm field equation ( [ e : fie ] ) and the energy equation ( [ e : mass1 ] ) . * the solution @ xmath59 is a local and a minimizer with respect to the first class of solutions ( those with solutions ) @xmath62 ) if @ xmath67 in ( [ e : time _ t ] ) is positive . * the solution @ xmath59 is a local minimizer with respect to the first ( and generally high - dimensional ) class of solutions if @ xmath59 in ( [ e : second ] ) . if the case @ xmath67 is positive for these solutions , then @ xmath59 is a local minimizer as well . in particular , we use the continuity equation ( [ e : fie ] ) to determine the solutions . next , we use @ xmath82 to determine whether @ xmath59 is a local minimizer . finally , when possible , we use the case of @ xmath67 to show that @ xmath59 is a local minimizer . since the continuum problem describes the system with constant mass , we want to make sure the continuum problem has a consistent solution for the continuum problem . if we talk about using an arbitrary model , we find that we can easily ` ` distinguish ' ' between the components of the system . as such we know the density of the multi- a swarm equilibrium . now the ' system ' can be divided into a set of @ xmath24 open , connected , individual components @ xmath91 , that is @ xmath92 we define a swarm equilibrium as a system in which each individual individual component is in equilibrium , @ xmath93 we can still define @ xmath82 in @ xmath39 @ xmath94 + f ( x ) = \ int _ { { \ int _ { { { \ bar \ omega } } } } } { ( x - y ) { { \ bar \ omega } } ( x ) ~ y + f ( x ) , \ ] ] . define @ xmath95 in @ xmath96 . we can still define a swarm minimizer . we define a swarm equilibrium is a mass minimizer if @ xmath97 for some neighborhood of each component @ xmath96 of the system . in practice this means that the equilibrium is an energy minimizer for all units of mass in the neighborhood of each component . this can also be called a lagrangian minimizer in the sense that the equilibrium is a minimizerwith respect to the lagrangian components of the equation . it is important to note that even if the solution @ xmath59 is a global minimizer , other multi - dimensional global minimizers may also exist . these solutions are local minimizers and therefore the global minimizer may not be a global solution in the sense of ( [ 2 : pde ] ) . in this section we consider the general solution described in ( [ 2 : 3 ] . it is important for practical purposes to find a good choice for the interaction potential @ xmath32 . as previously mentioned , in many physical , chemical , and biological systems , the pairwise potential @ xmath32 is zero . however , attraction occurs for short distances ( to avoid collisions ) and the interaction potential is zero for very long distances . a good choice for @ xmath32 is the interaction potential with strength used to represent long - range attraction and short - range attraction @ xcite . for the purposes of this section , we consider a good choice where @ xmath32 is the normal potential @ xmath98 which represents attraction with strength increasing rapidly with time . when there is no interaction strength ,@ xmath99 , and when the domain is infinite , _ e . g . _ , @ xmath100 , the sequence ##s is without limit . the solutions above extend the barenblatt method to the general case , as shown in @ xcite . however , when the solution @ xmath39 is finite and when there is no support for the full potential , the solutions are different both physically and mentally , as we will see . figure [ 1 : the _ case ] shows the @ xmath101 for three cases : a finite domain with an infinite boundary , a bounded well on a non - infinite domain , and a full swarm solution on an infinite domain . in this case , a full swarm solution is possible because the solutions are not absolutely bounded and can only take @ xmath0 - 1 values at the boundary . we discuss these three swarm solutions in detail later in this article . first , we will consider the following solution for the solution of the swarm problem . we will attempt to solve the problem as ; when the solution has bounded support only in the domain we find solutions that are bounded in the domain and can be .and on the boundary of the support . however , when the boundary of the support intersects with the boundary of the support , the original solution will break , and it is necessary to find a new solution in the support . we then define the conditions for the solutions to be global minimizers . we then apply these conditions to the two solutions given above . note that for @ xmath59 to be in steady state , it must satisfy the continuity condition ( [ e : fie ] ) subject to the second variation ( [ e : mass1 ] ) . for @ xmath101 to be a global minimizer , it must also satisfy ( [ e : mass ] ) , @ xmath102 and , note that for the solution @ xmath59 to be a global minimizer , the second variation ( [ e : time _ t ] ) must be zero . we note that if @ xmath78 , this is true . for ( [ e : stable ] ) , @ xmath103 and then for the rest of this section , we are required to satisfy the condition of @ xmath67 . the global minimizer that we consider to be a global .##r . then , for the remainder of this section , we turn our attention to finding where the support of the solution @ xmath62 is a closed interval in @ xmath39 ; in other words , the optimal solution is a single component . the fact that we are able to prove this result follows from the principle of swarm optimization , described above . in particular , we can show that there are no multi - component swarm minimizers for the action , as long as the optimal solution @ xmath104 is convex , that is , @ xmath105 in @ xmath39 . to see this , suppose we have a swarm minimizer with only at least two convex components . find @ xmath82 in the gap of convex components such that @ xmath106 . we solve @ xmath82 and to find @ xmath107 such that @ xmath108 is @ xmath109 in @ xmath64 . @ xmath105 by definition . therefore , @ xmath110 in @ xmath64 and hence @ xmath82 is found only in the gap . therefore , @ x##math111 is the center of the gap . we see from the above that @ xmath82 must be smaller than @ xmath112 in each of the gaps . this meets the requirements of global solutions from the previous section , and therefore the solution is not a global minimizer . since gap size is a necessary condition for global solutions , we must , as before , pay attention to single - pass solutions . for example , consider the case of the solution @ xmath59 [ @ xmath113 $ ] . we transform the integral equation ( [ q : fie ] ) for @ xmath59 into a differential equation by assuming that @ xmath114 is the complex number root of the differential equation @ xmath115 , and that @ xmath116 , where @ xmath117 is the corresponding @ xmath0 - function . applying @ xmath118 to both sides of ( [ q : fie ] ) gives the corresponding @ xmath0 - function satisfying the inequality . this and the convergence property of the @ xmath0 solution apply to @ xmath119= \ frac { \ lambda } { 1 } - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ left [ f - f ' ' ( x ) \ right ] \ , { \ rm _ } \ { { \ int _ { { { \ alpha \ right } } } } } . \ { { { : fie - sol } \ ] ] . ( [ { : fie - sol ] ) is a simple check that the solution @ xmath120 is not incorrect . in fact , to find the correct solution ( [ { : fie - sol ] ) , we must go back into the ordinary differential equation ( [ { : fie ] ) . we have @ xmath121 & \ equiv & \ int _ \ { e ^ { - | x - y | } \ left \ { \ frac { \ lambda } { 2 } - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ left [ f ( x ) - f ' ' ( x ) \ right ] \ right \ } \ , \ \ & = & \ alpha - f ( x ) + \ frac { e ^ { \ alpha - f } } { 1 } [ f ( \ alpha )- f ' ( \ alpha ) - \ lambda ] \ \ & & \ mbox { } + \ frac { f ^ { 1 - \ lambda } } { \ } [ f ( \ alpha ) + f ' ( \ alpha ) - \ lambda ] , \ nonumber \ { { 1 } \ ] ] where the terms other than @ xmath122 must vanish for ( [ x : fie - 1 ] ) to obtain a solution . these null spaces are given by @ xmath123 which determines the null space of @ xmath124 . the fact that these terms must vanish corresponds to the energy @ xmath125 for the solution @ xmath104 , but these conditions can only be satisfied for the values of @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 . the values @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 together determine @ xmath73 which in turn determines the energy @ xmath26 ##0 ( [ x : mass1 ] ) . as we discussed above , the energy measured here is usually , but not always , the local minimizer of the mass @ xmath48 . what we have discussed below is the general solutionof the limit of ( [ q : fie ] ) . the problem with this approach is that we know from classical models that for every energy @ xmath26 and energy @ xmath128 there should be a minimizer . it is easy to see that if @ xmath33 and @ xmath32 are bounded from below , the energy @ xmath48 is bounded from below too . if @ xmath129 comes in from ( [ q : l _ f ] ) , @ xmath130 since @ xmath48 is bounded from below , solutions to the same problem occur in the case of l - functions @ xcite . but these solutions are not classical ; when there is no interaction at short scales , we can result in an @ xmath0 - function @ xcite . for the more - important case of interaction at long scales , in free space and in the case of an action potential , they are true for every energy @ xcite . we can see that ( under these conditions ) a @ xmath0 - function does not exist in the case of @ xmath62 . so we have limited ourselves ( here ) to just thenote : ( [ ref : 1 ] ) , this is true more generally . in particular , suppose that at a point @ xmath51 in the neighborhood of @ xmath39 , * the probability density @ xmath104 is non - periodic in a neighborhood of @ xmath51 , * @ xmath114 is non - periodic for @ xmath131 , * @ xmath114 has nonzero value at some range , that is , @ xmath132 . the minimizer does not have an @ xmath0 - function at @ xmath133 . to see this , we can reduce the energy of a distribution with an @ xmath0 - function at @ xmath133 to that where the @ xmath0 - function has been replaced by a single , non - top - down function @ xmath134 , @ xmath135 and such that the energy is replaced by @ xmath136 . consider a density distribution with an @ xmath0 - function of size @ xmath24 , @ xmath51 , @ xmath137 . then the energy of[ @ xmath138 - 1 [ { { \ omega \ } } } _ 1 + [ \ delta ( x - x _ 0 ) ] . \ ] ] the second expansion of ( [ q : x _ 1 ] ) , @ xmath139 \ , dx \ , & \ nonumber \ \ & & \ mbox { } + m \ int _ { { \ omega } } ^ ( 0 ) \ , [ \ int _ \ varepsilon ( x - x _ 0 ) - \ delta ( x - x _ 0 ) \ } ] \ , dx . \ nonumber \ { { 0 } \ ] ] so that is @ xmath140 , @ xmath141 and @ xmath142 . compared to @ xmath143 , only the last term of ( [ q : nodeltas ] ) remains , leaving @ xmath144 for @ xmath145 , and to nonzero , for larger values , @ xmath146 , so that the effect is reduced by replacing the @ xmath0 - form with a @ w - form . we find that @ xmath0 -they may also vanish in the boundary of @ xmath39 under the uniform distribution . however , the above result breaks down for @ xmath0 - functions at the domain boundary , where they will not be affected by the underlying , uniform top - down distribution . based on the result above , we obtain a classical solution @ xmath147 where @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 are to be found . the corresponding solution @ xmath150 is obtained with @ xmath0 - functions at the boundary of @ xmath62 . we also note , in accordance with the result above , that @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 cannot vanish unless the boundary of the domain , @ xmath62 , agrees with the boundary of the domain , @ xmath39 . we obtain the corresponding classical solution ( [ f : fie - sol2 ] ) by incorporating it into the original solution ( [ f : fie ] ) . we have @ xmath151 & \ equiv & \ int _ \ omega \ ^ { - | x - 1 | } \ to \ { { \ int \ omega ( x ) } +a \ delta ( x - \ alpha ) + b \ delta ( y - \ alpha ) \ , \ } \ , \ , \ \ & = & \ alpha - f ( x ) + \ frac { e ^ { \ alpha - 1 } } { 2 } [ 2a + f ( \ alpha ) - f ' ( \ alpha ) - \ lambda ] \ \ & & \ mbox { } + \ frac { e ^ { y - \ alpha } } { 2 } [ 2b + f ( \ alpha ) + f ' ( \ alpha ) - \ lambda ] , \ nonumber \ { { 1 } \ ] ] where the coefficients other than @ xmath122 must satisfy for ( [ q : fie - sol2 ] ) to find a solution . this constraint corresponds to the corresponding constraints for @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 , the coefficients of the second part of the equation : @ xmath152 because @ xmath73 is solved as of now , we can find a solution for the equation @ xmath26 . insert the term @ xmath101 into the above equation ( [ q : mass1 ]) . @ xmath153 , \ \ & = & \ left \ left ( x + \ frac { ( \ beta - \ alpha ) } { 2 } \ right ) - \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ left [ f ( \ alpha ) + f ( \ beta ) + \ int _ { { \ int _ { { { \ alpha \ } } } } } } { ( x ) \ , dx \ } ] . \ left { \ } \ ] ] solving for @ xmath73 in terms of @ xmath26 and @ xmath154 we ve ##rt that for [ @ xmath113 $ ] and the other @ xmath26 we can find the solution to ( [ f : fie ] ) with @ xmath101 embedded in the solution and with a point at the origin . however , we havent yet considered the case of @ xmath101 being non - linear , nor have we considered whether it is a minimizer . we will consider whether the extremal solution @ xmath59 is a minimizer , which is the solution of ( [ f : stable2 ] ) . we find the following equationso that allows us to compute @ xmath82 and satisfy the condition for @ xmath59 to be a minimizer . we start by calculating the integral operator @ xmath155 where @ xmath156 . applying these results to the vector space @ xmath32 , we see that @ xmath157 and @ xmath59 in ( [ q : fie - sol2 ] ) into our calculation of @ xmath82 and ( [ q : stable2 ] ) in @ xmath158 . consider setting @ xmath159 to ( [ zero : one ] ) with the result @ xmath5 = @ xmath62 . we see that @ xmath160 = { \ mathcal { 2 } ^ - } [ \ \ ] , \ ] ] where we ve ##rt the result that @ xmath161 = @ xmath62 . if we compute @ xmath162 and set @ xmath6 ##2 to zero , the integral term is and @ xmath163 solving for @ xmath148 gets the integral term of ( [ zero : one ]) . a similar calculation for @ xmath164 gives the value of @ xmath149 . since @ xmath126 does not agree with any element of @ xmath39 , we can consider the region @ xmath165 , which is to the right of the region @ xmath62 . now , applying @ xmath159 to ( [ x : fie ] ) yields the result ; we now see that both the first term and the term from the @ xmath0 - term are represented by this function , from which we see that @ xmath166 = [ \ qquad \ rightarrow \ qquad [ ( x ) - \ lambda ( x ) = x ^ { , \ ] ] where @ xmath167 is an arbitrary term . a further calculation shows that if @ xmath104 is continuous , then @ xmath82 is continuous until the end of @ xmath62 and that @ xmath168 . this in turn yields @ xmath167 , and @ xmath169e ^ { x - \ lambda } \ qquad{ \ rm for } \ quad x \ leq \ beta . \ ] ] a similar solution for @ xmath164 is @ xmath170e ^ { \ alpha - 1 } \ qquad { \ rm for } \ quad x \ geq \ beta . \ ] ] as discussed in [ [ sec : minimizers ] , for @ xmath101 to be a minimizer we have for @ xmath88 for @ xmath171 and @ xmath172 . a further analysis shows that this is equivalent to [ sec : mincon ] @ xmath173 if @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 are not contained in @ xmath39 , then ( [ sec : mincon ] ) a sufficient condition for the extremal solution @ xmath59 to be a local minimizer ( note that @ xmath68 ) . we can also find a sufficient condition at the end of the solution from ( [ sec : mincon ] ) . if @ xmath5 belongs to @ xmath126 , we can find lhpital ##l , and this result is equivalent to the equation @ xmat##h174 , as above . a simple proof of @ xmath5 converge to @ xmath127 shows that @ xmath175 . however , since @ xmath59 is a domain , we are looking for different values . thus , either @ xmath176 or @ xmath126 coincide with the left end of @ xmath39 . therefore , either @ xmath177 or @ xmath127 coincide with the right end of @ xmath39 . this is consistent with the result ( [ q : nodeltas2 ] ) which shows that @ xmath0 - functions do not exist in the support of @ xmath39 . in general , we come to two conclusions : * a globally optimal solution @ xmath59 is an @ xmath0 - function only if a boundary of the support of the domain intersects with a boundary of the domain . * a globally optimal solution @ xmath59 must contain ( [ q : mincon ] ) . we therefore have two different values for @ xmath39 and @ xmath104 . we consider a two - dimensional distributed system with a singleis given by the transfer operator . we start with the simplest special case , with no external interactions , @ xmath178 and a finite support which for simplicity we take to be the set [ @ xmath179 $ ] . from @ xmath180 we see from ( [ fig : singlecomponent ] ) that the transfer function has a finite support , _ i . e . _ , where is a single solution . we also see that the initial solution is an equipartition of interactions with @ xmath0 - 1 at the exterior of the system and a single solution in the interior , as shown above in the [ fig : _ _ _ ] ( 1 ) . we then start with finding the solution . from ( [ fig : fie - 1 ] ) , we see that @ xmath181 the initial solution gives @ xmath182 etc . ( [ fig : mform ] ) gives @ xmath73 and @ xmath183 etc . ( [ fig : m ] ) gives @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 . @ xmath##184 since @ xmath185 , it follows that @ xmath186 and @ xmath66 converge according to ( [ fig : w1lambda ] ) . therefore , the solution is a local minimizer . the solution @ xmath101 is shown below in figure [ fig : density _ function ] ( a ) . figure [ fig : density _ numerics ] ( b ) shows experimental and theoretical results for the extreme case where we define the infinite domain to be @ xmath187 and the finite domain to [ @ xmath188 $ ] with @ xmath189 . red - colored lines mark the boundaries of the domain . the first line indicates the optimal solution @ xmath59 . these correspond to the previously - defined regions of the total domain ( [ fig : discretesystem ] ) with @ xmath190 family members . the point at the lagrangian boundary point is determined by the method described in figure ( [ fig : contmodel ] ) and shown in figure [ fig : density _ function ] . the ` ` x ' ' on the domain boundary corresponds to .@ xmath0 - unit of mass @ xmath191 in the analytical solution , and proportional to the number of @ xmath192 family members in the numerical solution . thus , we have an equilibrium between the mass minimizer and the numerical solution , for this very small number @ xmath190 of lagrangian solutions . we also consider the space environment and the external gravitational field . the spatial coordinate @ xmath193 reflects the situation around us . first , @ xmath39 with the non - spatial coordinate @ xmath194 . then @ xmath195 with @ xmath196 , as in the [ fig : scale _ 1 ] ( right ) . for @ xmath180 we see from ( [ fig : singlecomponent ] ) that the analytical solution has a single component , _ i . e . _ , which has a positive support . however , moving this component slightly reduces the potential energy , leaving the kinetic energy unchanged . therefore , the support of the solution will be @ xmath197 $ ] , consistent with @ xmath198 . in addition , we can see thatthere are two possible solution schemes based on @ xmath12 . for non - solutions of @ xmath12 , @ xmath127 quickly approaches zero , and the mass remains on the ground @ xmath140 , as shown above in figure [ fig : acceleration _ equation ] ( e ) . for solving @ xmath12 , the mass is split into an @ xmath0 - solution on the ground and a classical solution for @ xmath131 , as shown in figure [ fig : acceleration _ equation ] ( e ) . we then proceed with finding the solution . from ( [ fig : fie - ab ] ) , we know that @ xmath199 the classical solution for @ xmath200 a . ( [ fig : mform ] ) specifies @ xmath73 as @ xmath201 b . ( [ sec : si ] ) specifies @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 as @ xmath202 for @ xmath59 to be a mass minimizer , it must be known that @ xmath177 as shown in figure [ fig :funcmin ] . then , we see that @ xmath203 . for @ xmath204 , we see that @ xmath205 in which case the objective function is @ xmath206 which follows from that @ xmath207 . the [ 1 : l _ function ] ( below ) is a rough solution of this problem . we first must satisfy the condition ( [ 1 : minconb ] ) . to show that is true , we suppose that @ xmath208 . then ( [ 1 : minconb ] ) let @ xmath209 we see that by lhpital ##e , that equality is defined for @ xmath210 . to prove the equality , for @ xmath211 , @ xmath212 and @ xmath213 ( for @ xmath214 ) . the equality is @ xmath215 we can define the right - hand side as the slope of the chord using the functions @ xmath216 and @ xmath217 . then , if the chord @ xmath218 is shifted downward , the slope of the chord will be .if @ xmath219 moves away from @ xmath220 , and the inequality will vanish . assuming that @ xmath221 , we get @ xmath222 ^ { \ pi \ pi } = [ / / $ ] which is negative , and so the solution is globally stable . for @ xmath223 our previous calculation was computed @ xmath224 . since @ xmath127 will also be negative , the minimizer in this case is a @ xmath0 - 1 at the origin , called @ xmath225 , as in the [ fig : lambda _ _ ] ( 1 ) . in this case , @ xmath226 from ( [ fig : gravitylambda ] ) and @ xmath227 from ( [ fig : lambdaright ] ) . it follows that @ xmath228 the first solution follows from the taylor expansion . the second follows from our calculation @ xmath229 . since @ xmath88 the solution is globally stable minimizer . in general , there are two solutions . when @ xmath223 , the globally stable minimizer is a @ xmath0 -and at the origin . when @ xmath230 there is a more general minimizer solution of an @ xmath0 - function at the origin which is the right - hand side of the non - coupled classical solution . the two solutions are shown together in figure [ fig : energy _ sc ] ( de ) . figure [ fig : energy _ numerics ] ( de ) shows classical and numerical solutions for the classical ( @ xmath230 ) solution with @ xmath187 and @ xmath231 . we use @ xmath190 - ##s for the analytical solution . the classical ( points ) and numerical ( points ) @ xmath232 vanish , as does the analytical part of the solution , such as the ` ` ` ' ' which is the solution of @ xmath233 - ##s in the numerical solution of total mass @ xmath234 , and of an @ xmath0 - function of mass @ xmath235 in the classical solution . we then replace the energy well @ xmath100 with a new total mass solution , as in figure [ fig : energy _ sc##tic ] ( b ) . this version of the optimal solution is that of a simple classical well , which can be applied to a chemoattractant , neutron source , or proton source . as @ xmath236 where @ xmath237 is the value of the density . from @ xmath238 we know from ( [ fig : singlecomponent ] ) that the optimal solution is a classical well . we set the value of the solution to [ @ xmath113 $ ] . we also find that the resulting energy density is finite and has an almost cubic shape , shown in figure [ fig : energy _ density ] ( b ) . our algorithm works as follows . we know from figure [ fig : funcmin ] that because @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 are assumed to be classical , @ xmath239 and so the solution is classical . from ( [ fig : fie - 1 ] ) , we know that @ xmath240 and , from ( [ fig : 1 ] ) , @ xmath241 and @ xmath73 from these , and so that @ xmath##242 , it follows that @ xmath243 . therefore , the mass is distributed around the center of the sphere . for example , we would have @ xmath244 . ( [ q : mform ] ) writing @ xmath73 in terms of the mass @ xmath26 yields @ xmath245 and , from the second term of ( [ q : abquad ] ) we have that @ xmath246 combining these two solutions for @ xmath73 yields that @ xmath247 yields that @ xmath248 increases monotonically from @ xmath249 with increase @ xmath26 . therefore , writing the mass @ xmath59 in terms of @ xmath26 , we have @ xmath250 & | x | \ leq \ left ( \ frac { 3m } { 2 \ gamma } + 1 \ right ) ^ { 1 / 3 } - 1 \ \ right & | x | > \ left ( \ frac { 3m } { 2 \ gamma } + 1 \ right ) ^ { 1 / 3 } - 1 . \ begin { 1 } \ ] ] it follows thatthat @ xmath207 , and that there is a point at the center of the solution . we then can show that the candidate @ xmath59 is a global minimizer , which is shown by figure ( [ sec : mincon ] ) . using the same method as for the second solution in figure [ fig : grav ] , it is to show that @ xmath218 is stable . for @ xmath251 which follows directly from this . thus , the solution is a global minimizer . the candidate @ xmath59 is shown below in figure [ fig : dynamics _ peak ] ( b ) . figure [ fig : dynamics _ numerics ] ( c ) shows analytical and numerical results for the solution with @ xmath187 and @ xmath252 , with @ xmath253 # ##ing , for the numerical results . the numerical ( point ) and analytical ( point ) @ xmath59 compare here . in most physical , chemical , and biological systems , the pairwise solution @ xmath32 is unstable , with a small peak at large distances and the field strength near zero for the entire2 . a common model for @ xmath32 is the morse potential @ xmath254 with carefully chosen parameters . here , @ xmath5 is the distance between particles , @ xmath255 is the characteristic length scale of attraction , and @ xmath256 is the characteristic distance traveled by particles . we have chosen the effective weak force and length scale to be unity . in this case we are left with the values of ( [ h : mass1 ] ) and ( [ h : fie ] ) with @ xmath32 replaced by ( [ h : morse ] ) . the morse potential has been studied extensively and has become the standard model for weak - force forces @ xcite . the key question of the model ( [ h : morse ] ) is whether or not the parameters @ xmath257 are likely to be in the _ h - stable _ or the _ unstable _ regime ; see @ xcite for a comparison . compare ( [ h : discretesystem ] ) with @ xmath178 . if the parameters @ xmath257 are not in the h - stable regime @ xmath258 , then if the number of particles @ x##math2 ##time , the size distribution of particles becomes approximately constant , as does the energy per particle . put simply , the particles form a random lattice where the individual - neighbor effect is approximately constant for all individuals ( including nearest neighbors ) . as more particles are added to the lattice , the individual - neighbor effect is reduced and the lattice begins to occupy a larger size distribution . if the particles are moved out of the m - stable region , _ i . e . _ , @ xmath259 , the situation becomes catastrophic . in this case , the energy per particle becomes constant , @ xmath260 , and particles stick together more and more tightly as size increases . our model is @ xcite ##s the various solutions of the catastrophic regime ( [ cf : pde ] ) with m - stable particles in the absence of any external interaction , @ xmath99 , and on the real world . in the h - stable regime , the continuum phase displays stationary distribution functions , while in the catastrophic regime , it displays well - defined stationary distributions . the difference between catastrophic and m - stable is due to the fourier transform of the equation @ xmath114 . note that ( [ cf : 1 ]) as a [ [ sec : qhatmorse ] @ xmath261 } { ( 1 + { k } ^ { 2 } ) ( 1 + ( kl ) ^ 2 ) } . \ begin { k } \ ] ] the solution for h - stability is equivalent to @ xmath262 . in this case , @ xmath78 for = @ xmath263 , and from section [ sec : minimizers ] , this is equivalent for @ xmath68 , or equivalently , all combinations of constant density states . in the catastrophic case , @ xmath264 . , in the catastrophic case , the constant density state is unstable to plane wave interactions . the system is unstable to states of high energy greater than the time scale of the interaction . in the h - stable case , the constant density state is unstable to interactions , and the energy is chosen carefully to be constant . we will first consider minimizers for the case of h - stable systems , and we get very similar results for the catastrophic and h - stable cases . we repeat the procedure described in section [ sec : dynamics ] , where we will look for a suitable solution for theinstead of @ xmath265 $ ] and we look for @ xmath0 - functions in the center . once again , we can assume that minimizers are @ xmath0 - functions . when the boundary of the support , @ xmath62 , intersects with the boundary of the support , @ xmath39 . for this , use the expression ##s @ xmath266 and @ xmath267 , and from @ xmath268 to ( [ e : fie ] ) to ( @ xmath269 , \ dot [ \ dot { { \ pi _ { { { \ pi \ pi } } } } } , \ dot { e : morselocal } \ ] ] where @ xmath270 } , we get @ xmath271 the general solution to the equation is obtained by splitting ( [ e : morseansatz ] ) into ( [ e : mass1 ] ) and ( [ e : fie ] ) which yields @ xmath272 where @ xmath84 = @ xmath62 . we start by calculating the values @ xmath148 and @ xmath##149 of the second part of the paper . we consider the differential equation @ xmath273 where @ xmath274 and @ xmath275 where @ xmath276 . note that @ xmath277 [ ( x - y ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath248 is the identity function . now we add @ xmath278 to ( [ x : morseintegraleq ] ) with the point @ xmath5 and @ xmath62 , which gives @ xmath279 { { { { { \ { \ lambda } } _ * } } } ( x ) \ , \ & & \ \ \ mbox { } + \ { \ mathcal { p } ^ - } { \ mathcal { p } ^ - } \ ( x - \ lambda ) = { \ mathcal { p } ^ - } { \ mathcal { p } ^ - } \ { \ { - p ( x ) \ } . \ nonumber \ { { x } \ ] ] has the limit @ xmath280 = @ xmath281 where we have used the fact that @ xmath##282 . a new approach using the operator @ xmath283 and solving on @ xmath164 shows that @ xmath284 exists . ( [ e : morseboundary1 ] ) and ( [ e : morseboundary2 ] ) relate the values of the @ xmath0 - operators at the boundary to the values of the - operator @ xmath232 itself . the solution of the equation requires @ xmath104 to be solved . in the case where @ xmath285 , solving ( [ e : morselocal ] ) for @ xmath286 and solving ( [ e : morseboundary1 ] ) and ( [ e : morseboundary2 ] ) for @ xmath148 and @ xmath149 yields an exact solution . we first assume that the equation is non - linear and then consider the case below to determine if there is a local or global minimizer . in the case where @ xmath62 is located on the boundary of @ xmath39 , we find that @ xmath287 is located in the [ e : equation ] . we consider this case below . for @xmath62 is located at the center of @ xmath39 . in @ xmath287 . in the [ category : funcmin ] , we need to know when @ xmath88 = @ xmath35 and when @ xmath68 , which are necessary and sufficient conditions for @ xmath59 to be a function minimizer . we apply @ xmath278 to ( [ category : morseintegraleq ] ) at the point @ xmath165 . the integral condition and the derivative resulting from the @ xmath0 term vanish . the solution is called @ xmath288 . we write the solution for @ xmath289 the two solutions @ xmath290 are obtained as follows . from ( [ category : morseintegraleq ] ) , @ xmath82 is a continuous function , and from @ xmath291 we apply the integral condition to the solution to obtain the solution for @ xmath290 . we solve ( [ category : morseintegraleq ] ) and conclude that @ xmath292 is continuous . then , since @ xmath84for @ xmath85 , @ xmath293 . turning this result into the solution of ( [ f : lambdamorse ] ) and letting @ xmath5 converge to @ xmath294 , we find @ xmath295 the convergence to ( [ f : lambdacontinuity ] ) and ( [ f : lambdaprime ] ) = [ f : kvals ] @ xmath296 assuming that @ xmath82 is found when @ xmath297 we will find when @ xmath88 , at or on the right side of @ xmath62 . by rotating @ xmath82 with @ xmath297 , we find @ xmath298 the first term of ( [ f : lambdatayl ] ) will become @ xmath299 where the final result comes from replacing ( [ f : morseboundary1 ] ) with @ xmath176 and showing that the real part of the term @ xmath300 must be constant since it has no derivative . however , since we have @ xmath301 ( this cannot be proved a posteriori ), we find that the last term , ( [ e : lambdatayl ] ) is zero . a similar result holds for the solution @ xmath164 . similarly , @ xmath302 for @ xmath5 has no solution outside of @ xmath62 . more simply , the solution ( [ e : morseansatz ] ) is a mass minimizer , that is , it is constant with respect to the center of mass . the solution @ xmath62 is given by the equations ( [ e : morseboundary1 ] ) and ( [ e : morseboundary2 ] ) , which , when @ xmath239 , and [ e : bcs ] @ xmath303 in the next section , we will consider the solutions of the morse equations ( [ e : fie ] ) and ( [ e : mass1 ] ) with no internal variables , @ xmath99 . we consider two cases for the classical morse equations ( [ e : lambda ] ) : first , the classical case on @ xmath100 , for which the above formula holds , and second , for the classical -

analytical solution @ xmath59 . this corresponds to the h - optimal solution of the stable case ( [ see : discretesystem ] ) with @ xmath190 individual points . as shown by @ xcite , the optimal solution of ( [ see : pde ] ) for the h - stable case is : - ##ly - analytical solution that is the best - known barenblatt solution of the boundary layer problem . however , there is an optimal solution for the h - stable case in an bounded domain ( we can prove this by comparing the corresponding solution to that of the previous one and showing [ that there is no symmetry ) . thus , we have a bounded domain @ xmath188 $ ] . as shown , @ xmath99 in ( [ see : fie ] ) is and @ xmath258 in ( [ see : fi ] ) so that @ xmath325 in ( [ see : morselocal ] ) . the optimal solution to ( [ see : morselocal ] ) is @ xmath326 where @ xmath327 we can now use this to prove @ xmath##311 . the minimizer will be the same , but with @ xmath0 - 3 for the sphere , @ xmath328 and with symmetry , @ xmath329 . thus , the equation can be written [ @ xmath330 . \ ] ] going into the integral equation ( [ e : fie ] ) and the mass constraint ( [ e : mass1 ] ) to yield the solutions @ xmath167 , @ xmath73 and @ xmath148 . the integral equation has been determined by @ xmath312 . this yields the same , linear equation for @ xmath167 , @ xmath148 and @ xmath73 . the mass constraint ( [ e : mass1 ] ) is an integral solution , yielding an equation resulting in @ xmath167 , @ xmath148 , and @ xmath73 for the sphere . we have the 3 dimensional integral equation @ xmath331 the solution is [ e : hstablesoln ] @ xmath332 } { \ \ \ } , \ \ \ & = & - \ frac { {{ \ phi \ mu } } = ( 1 - { { \ phi \ mu } } ^ 2 ) ( 1 - { { \ phi \ mu } } ^ 2 l ^ 2 ) } { \ lambda } , \ \ \ , & = & \ frac { { { { \ phi \ mu } } ( 1 - { { } } } l ^ 2 ) \ , [ ( 1 + { { \ phi \ mu } } ) ( 1 + { { \ phi \ mu } } l ) + ( 1 -

length to be @ xmath189 . the two solutions are @ xmath323 and @ xmath324 . the third solution is the numerical solution @ xmath232 . these correspond to the non - stable states of the quantum system ( [ fig : discretesystem ] ) with @ xmath190 swarm members . the ` ` x ' ' on the solid plane corresponds to an @ xmath0 - member of the @ xmath191 in the numerical solution , and thus to a group of @ xmath192 swarm members in the numerical solution . we will return to the classical quantum model of @ xcite , discussed below in figure [ fig : 3 ] . note that the system##s is assumed to have a number of individuals on the surface , a bubble or ` ` bubble ' ' where the number of individuals is nearly infinite , and a slowly rotating swarm of individual particles . this phenomenon is observed in the model ( [ fig : 1 ] ) ; see figure [ fig : 2 ] ( c ) . in contrast , figure [ fig : 3 ] ( c ) shows that the swarm is moving even when the system in the bubble is shut down , and that gravitational fields and forces are present . to further understand the behavior of the swarm , we consider the quantum gravity model . to further understand the model , we note that the vertical structure of the swarm appears to depend only partially on the horizontal structure , and so we will consider a _ quasi - one - dimensional _ model in which the vertical structure is not present . in particular , we will make a distinction between a one - dimensional and a quasi - two - dimensional model . both models take the form of the energy balance equation ( [ fig : fie ] ) on a semi - empirical scale , with the energy energy @ xmath337 and above . the models differ in the values of the energy balance @ xmat##h32 , which is used to represent the one - dimensional and quasi - two - dimensional model . the one - dimensional model is exactly that which we discussed in figure [ 1 : grav ] . here we note that minimizers of the one - dimensional model can be the group of seeds below the ground and the group of seeds above the ground , but there will not be any separation between the free and grounded groups . we also note here that for the quasi - two - dimensional model , this is not the case , and therefore , the minimizers have no separation between the grounded groups . as such , the one - dimensional and quasi - two - dimensional models model only the swarm . however , the model we see here does not account for the most - complex cases when gravity is absent . we use the attraction - only model in order to model the molecular mechanism responsible for the formation of the swarm . we model the swarm in two dimensions , with horizontal coordinate @ xmath338 . we will then expect the vertical coordinate @ xmath339 to be 0 , since 0 is the density of the ground coordinate @ xmath340 . we expect the density to be 1 in the horizontal coordinate @ xmat##h341 , note that @ xmath342 . we have a quasi - two - dimensional interaction , , @ xmath343 , @ xmath344 and @ xmath345 , this is @ xmath346 it is easy to see that the two - dimensional interaction per unit of distance is given by @ xmath347 = \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ int _ { { \ omega } } \ int _ { { \ omega } } \ , ( x _ 1 ) \ , ( y _ 1 ) y _ { 2 } ( x _ 1 - y _ 1 ) \ , dx _ 1 \ , y _ 1 + \ int _ { { \ omega } } [ ( x _ 1 ) \ , ( y _ 1 ) \ , dx _ 1 , \ ] ] where the interaction force is @ xmath348 and the line @ xmath39 is the half - line @ xmath349 . this is very similar to the two - dimensional interaction ( [ 1 : m _ 1 ] ) , but with particles moving according to the quasi - two - dimensional interaction force . thus , the interactionthe solutions are : ( [ e : cont _ e ] ) and ( [ e : pde ] ) , with the solution @ xmath350 . for the classical case ( [ e : cd ] ) , the non - two - dimensional case is @ xmath351 this equation can be written for ease of calculation , @ xmath352 where ( [ e : q2db ] ) comes from letting , ( [ e : q2dc ] ) comes from letting @ xmath353 , ( [ e : q2dd ] ) comes from letting @ xmath354 , and ( [ e : q2de ] ) comes from the second expansion @ xmath355 . from the second expansion of ( [ e : q2dd ] ) , we see that for small @ xmath356 , @ xmath357 whereas for large @ xmath356 , @ xmath358 . \ ] ] in our numerical calculations , it is difficult to find an efficient way of calculating values of @ xmath359 . in practice , we use ( [ e : q##z ] ) for small @ xmath356 , ( [ fig : largez ] ) for large @ xmath356 , and for large values of @ xmath356 we choose from the periodic table pre - determined by ( [ fig : q2de ] ) . the potential @ xmath360 is shown in figure [ fig : q2d ] . note that @ xmath360 is increasing at @ xmath361 , and monotonically decreasing at @ xmath356 . the minimum of the potential @ xmath362 is the maximum of @ xmath363 the potential @ xmath364 plays a key role in our definition of minimizers , . the fourier transform of @ xmath360 can be obtained by using the fourier method ( [ fig : q2dc ] ) and taking the order of magnitude of @ xmath6 and @ xmath365 to yield @ xmath366 which we assume is global , since the minimizers are global minimizers per the definition in figure [ fig : minimizers ] . we consider a pseudo - two - dimensional molecular system with no chemical interactions oftherefore , and due to the same gravitational force , @ xmath221 . the maximum distance @ xmath193 is the distance between us . therefore , @ xmath39 is the quasi - zero mass @ xmath194 . from section [ fig : grav ] , note that for the one - dimensional problem , @ xmath367 is a minimizer for the @ xmath26 , corresponding to the swarm ##s attracted by gravity to the ground . we consider this zero mass as a swarm minimizer for the non - one - dimensional problem . in this case , @ xmath59 , is not a minimizer for the other @ xmath26 . to see this , we first consider @ xmath82 , @ xmath368 since @ xmath369 , @ xmath370 is observed from the ground and then @ xmath59 is at most a swarm minimizer . in particular , if @ xmath371 , @ xmath101 is a swarm minimizer because @ xmath372 which means that @ xmath82 is not optimal for @ xmath373 as shown in section [ fig : gr] ( b ) . because it is strictly increasing , @ xmath374 for @ xmath131 . consider this solution , and then , since @ xmath68 ##2 is known , @ xmath59 is a global minimizer . this means that if an infinite amount of mass is built up in the system , it will converge to the limit . therefore , we say this solution is the global minimum ( although we have not proved this ) . note that although the solution @ xmath375 is necessary for @ xmath59 to be a global minimizer , it is not exact . as stated above , it is not necessary that @ xmath376 is strictly increasing , but that @ xmath377 for @ xmath131 . this is the solution for for @ xmath378 , where @ xmath379 . 0 [ 1 : 1 ] ( b ) shows the solution when @ xmath380 . although @ xmath377 for @ xmath131 , @ xmath82 is a global minimum . in this case , although the system with the mass centered at the origin is a global minimizer , it is _x _ x _ z . we also show that a small amount of mass close to the local minimum of @ xmath82 will be a swarm minimizer , which is very sensitive to temperature . figure [ fig : lambda ] ( d ) shows the special case when @ xmath381 . in this case the local minimum of @ xmath82 , @ xmath382 , @ xmath383 and @ xmath384 . figure [ fig : lambda ] ( d ) shows the case when @ xmath385 and use @ xmath386 in the neighborhood of the origin . in this case the solution with the mass centered at the origin is also a swarm minimizer ; the size of the solution can be increased by moving some of the mass from the origin to the neighborhood of the local minimum . when @ xmath387 it is possible to create a family of swarm minimizers . we have done a lot of simulations for the @ xmath26 and have found some important properties of the system . we use @ xmath388 and use @ xmath389 for the simulation of the whole system . however , all the # ##s arerise from the ground and we return the figure to above . figure [ fig : quasi2dnumerics ] ( a ) shows the mass on the ground as a percentage of the total swarm mass . the thin red line shows ( b ) that for @ xmath390 , the equilibrium consists of some mass located at the origin ; as discussed above , this mass is the swarm minimizer and ( we have ) the global equilibrium . as mass is increased for @ xmath391 , the equilibrium becomes a swarm minimizer consisting of a small mass in the space away from the origin , and some mass located on the ground . as @ xmath26 ##2 , the mass of mass located on the ground decreases monotonically . figure [ fig : quasi2dnumerics ] ( b ) shows the support of the entire swarm , which exists only for @ xmath392 ; the lower and upper lines show the support of the bottom and top of the swarm , respectively . as mass is increased , the support of the swarm decreases monotonically . as discussed above , when @ xmath392 , swarm minimizers exist with different components . in general , there exists a mixture of swarm minimizers with different components ofboth in the air and on the ground . which minimizer is used in practice depends on initial conditions . figure [ fig : lambda2 ] shows two such minimizers for @ xmath388 and @ xmath393 , and the individual values of @ xmath82 ( each derived from a different initial condition ) . assuming that for each such minimizer , an individual value of the mass , @ xmath73 is present , we have @ xmath394 for the air component and @ xmath395 for the grounded component . in figure [ fig : lambda2 ] ( cd ) , @ xmath396 of the mass is contained in the grounded component . in this case , @ xmath397 indicating that the total energy could be reduced by transporting swarm members from the air to the ground . in contrast , in figure [ fig : lambda2 ] ( cd ) , @ xmath398 of the mass is contained in the grounded component . in this case , @ xmath399 indicating that the total energy could be reduced by transporting swarm members from the ground to the air . note that for each , we have the solution : where @ xmath400 , which would correspond to theswarm minimizer . however , this solution is obviously not a global solution and this can only easily be seen in practice . we ve shown that for @ xmath401 we can find a system of swarm minimizers with a balance of energy and ground energy , and that for @ xmath402 these states will have a higher energy than the system with the energy conserved only on the ground . in comparison with the two - dimensional system of equations [ 1 : grav ] in which the energy is conserved , these equilibrium solutions seem to be the best solution for a large problem in the non - two - dimensional system . we show that this is an opportunity for the understanding of the swarm - like behavior of real life systems . in this way we deeveloped a method for finding equilibrium solutions for these problems . we reduce the swarm motion model to an energy continuum model . this continuum model has an energy distribution which describes the individual problems and their solutions . we set conditions for the equilibrium solution to be a swarm minimizer , a global minimizer , and / or a global minimizer , that is , proportional to the lagrangian changes of the system . we give several examples of weakly stable equilibrium solutions , which areand intersects with the boundary of the support . in particular , when the boundary of the support intersects with the support of , the minimizer will have an @ xmath0 - function there . for the case of social forces modeled with the morse potential , we found two different solutions . on a straight line , the minimizer is a linear density profile with @ xmath0 - function at the end . on a straight - line with an external morse potential , the minimizer is a compact , linear density profile with an @ xmath0 - function at the end . in euclidean space with an external morse potential , the minimizer is a compact , convex cone with fixed points at the origin . each of the two solutions is called a global minimizer . to confirm the results above , we have found the solution for the non - social force , modeled with the morse potential . for the case that the social force is in the classical quantum mechanical regime , we found a compact supported force whose density is independent of the local swarm energy . this means that in the classical regime , forces are produced with less mass . for the case offor non - stable driving forces , there is an analytical solution on an infinite domain . on a finite domain , mass is divided into a classical component on the surface and @ xmath0 - concentrations in the interior . we note that for the classical model of @ xcite ( see figure [ 1 : 1 ] ) , all of mass is on the surface , with a disconnected classical component inside , separated by a gap . none of the three - dimensional models ( for the maxwell and einstein models ) discussed above have a gap , that is , only classical components that are completely disconnected , so that this model is only two - dimensional . to study this problem , we used a non - three - dimensional model corresponding to a simple distributed swarm . we note here that for a wide range of systems , there is a large number of swarm minimizers that consist of a cluster on the surface and a disconnected , classical component in the interior , reminiscent of our original theoretical formulation of the simple distributed swarm model . we conclude that the analytical solutions we found are a part of the vast number of analytical solutions that exist for the swarm models we have studied , and in general . we hope that these solutions will facilitate further development and guide future research efforts .cmt acknowledges support from the doe through grants ns -
