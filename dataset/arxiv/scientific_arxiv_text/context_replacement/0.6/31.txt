one of the main tasks in the theory of complex surfaces is to construct a special class of complex surfaces of general type with @ xmath0 . in this way we have _ _ _ _ _ campedelli surfaces _ with an order , i . e . simply connected minimal complex surfaces of general type with @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 , that is an automorphism of with @ xmath5 . there has been a recent search for complex surfaces of general type with @ xmath0 with an order ; a . y . keum - y . shin @ xcite , calabri - ciliberto - mendes , @ xcite , calabri - mendes de - pardini @ xcite , a . shin - y . shin @ xcite , rito @ xcite . the class of _ _ godeaux surfaces _ ( i . e . minimal complex surfaces of general type with @ xmath0 and @ xmath2 ) with an order is given by calabri - ciliberto - mendes , @ xcite . it is known that the dimension space of a numerical godeaux surface is its dimension is .similar but birational to the enriques surface , and the bicanonical map of the numerical godeaux surface factors through the identity map . however , the problem is more complicated in the case of numerical campedelli surfaces , because the bicanonical map may also factor through the identity map ; cf . calabri - mendes barlow - pardini @ xcite . in general it may be that the surface is of general type . more precisely , let @ xmath6 be a numerical campedelli surface with an intersection @ xmath7 . if @ xmath7 has four fixed points and no fixed poles , then the upper limit @ xmath8 of the intersection @ xmath9 is a numerical godeaux surface and @ xmath7 has only four fixed poles ; cf . barlow @ xcite . similarly , if @ xmath8 is of general type , then @ xmath7 has only four fixed points and no fixed poles ; calabri - mendes barlow - pardini @ xcite . there are also examples of numerical campedelli surfaces @ xmath6 with an intersection @ xmath7 has only four .m . barlow @ xcite constructed examples with @ xmath10 . barlow @ xcite also constructed examples with @ xmath11 whose first resolution of the solution of the problem is the first resolution of the _ _ _ _ _ godeaux surface . now , catanese , and @ xcite constructed both this example and @ xmath12 . then calabri , # ##i , and pardini @ xcite constructed the numerical campedelli surface with solution @ xmath13 and other examples . frapporti @ xcite proved that there is an example of exactly two intersection points of the numerical campedelli surface with @ xmath14 constructed independently by bauer - catanese - grunewald - pignatelli @ xcite . it is known that the limit of the total symmetry group of numerical campedelli surfaces is at most @ xmath15 and the dihedral groups @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 can also be determined . however , the same problem for numerical campedelli surfaces with @ xmath18 was answered by the construction of examples with @ xmath19 ; frapporti @ xcite and e . g- y . lee @ xcite . com it would be an interesting problem to find numerical campedelli surfaces with an order with @ xmath20 for a finite resolution @ xmath21 with @ xmath22 . but we are dealing with the simply connected case because the symmetry group of all the complex surfaces with an order has an order : @ xmath23 . so the first case of _ simply connected _ numerical campedelli surfaces is very interesting ( y . wang - y . lee ) , but we have no proof about the existence of an order in their case . the main idea of this paper is : there exist simply connected minimal complex surfaces @ xmath6 of general type with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 which have an order @ xmath7 such that the minimal resolution @ xmath8 of the group @ xmath9 is a simply connected minimal complex surface of general type with @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 . we can show that the minimal resolution @ xmath8 of the group @ xmath9 has a finite symmetry group of order @ xmath28 corresponding to the @xmath29 of @ xmath8 shows that the general intersection @ xmath30 is the general fiber of the resolution @ xmath31 of a finite campedelli . @ xmath32 is an resolution @ xmath33 ; theorem [ proposition : orientation - preserving ] . in particular , we show that the resolution @ xmath8 should be already simply connected if the double cover @ xmath6 is already simply connected ; theorem [ proposition : simply - connected = > simply - connected ] . thus barlow @ xcite shows that if the resolution @ xmath8 is a simply connected numerical godeaux surface , the general intersection of the four fundamental domains of the double cover @ xmath6 is @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 , @ xmath36 , @ xmath37 , and @ xmath15 . as far as we know , the example with barlow @ xcite is the first example whose resolution is simply connected . it was @ xmath38 as shown above . hence we have an example with @ xmath39 . so it would be an easy task in this case to find an example with @ xmath40 . but thisto illustrate the problem , we use the # ##t and an @ xmath3 - gorenstein smoothing algorithm developed by k . lee - y . lee . first we find singular surfaces by adding smooth curves and then smoothing them with a single smooth closed curve . these singular surfaces grow by adding new @ xmath41 - curves . if we smooth all of the @ xmath41 - curves , we get a smooth curve @ xmath42 in the space of kollr ##witz - barron @ xcite , and we prove that the number of @ xmath3 - gorenstein copies of @ xmath42 is finite and @ xmath43 finite ; proposition [ propsotion : numerical - godeaux ] . a ( @ xmath3 - gorenstein ) deformation of @ xmath42 in this space produces simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces . in particular , the smoothing of @ xmath42 proves the existence of a three dimensional family of simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces with a @ xmath41 - curve ; proposition [ stability : stable ] . we also prove that a three dimensional deformation in this space produces simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces with an @ xmath5 - curve di##visor space of four distinct @ xmath41 - curves ; theorem [ theorem : smooth - section - of - curves ] and theorem [ theorem : smooth - section ] . these four godeaux surfaces are used to construct the numerical campedelli surfaces with their extension . the resulting numerical campedelli surfaces are obtained by taking smooth sections of the numerical godeaux surface , and the four distinct @ xmath41 - curves ; theorem [ theorem : campedelli ] . on the other hand we can also construct the campedelli - surface from the locally smooth section @ xmath44 . this follows from taking the sections and smooth part of a smooth - closed curve ; theorem [ theorem : campexplicit ] . the @ xmath3 - gorenstein space of sections of @ xmath44 is smooth and @ xmath45 smooth ; theorem [ theorem : q - campedelli ] . by combining godeaux and campedelli , we find @ xmath46 to have a local - to - global way to construct them ; theorem [ theorem : h2 ( ty ) = 0 ] and theorem [ theorem : h2 ( ty ) = 0 ] . this is a special case ( theorem[ see : burns - wahl ] ) which is a consequence of burns - wahl @ xcite for the existence of higher order solutions of a smooth elliptic curve with two rational double points . self - intersection of ( th ##s @ xmath47 of ) @ xmath48 , where @ xmath49 with @ xmath50 means @ xmath51 - th ##ratic form of @ xmath34 , @ xmath52 , and @ xmath53 , and denoted by @ xmath54 . @ xmath55 = @ xmath56 . a @ xmath57 - curve ( or @ xmath41 - curve ) on a complex manifold has an intersection @ xmath58 with self - intersection @ xmath59 ( or , @ xmath60 ) . in this article we use the same notation to describe the curve and its fourier transform as a birational transformation . a solution of a @ xmath61 is a smooth curve which is an @ xmath3 - gorenstein curve with intersection . they have both rational double points or @ xmath62 with @ xmath63 and @ x##math64 ; @ kollr . - barron @ xcite . for the finite group @ xmath6 the mapping of @ xmath65 is @ xmath66 . the kernel of @ xmath67 is @ xmath68 . the authors would like to thank professor yongnam kim for the help during the publication , the editing of the original paper , and other useful information . the authors also like to thank professor jenia tevelev for making the corrections in the original editing of this paper , and the authors thank for the correction in the introduction of section 1 . 2 which makes it longer . heesang kim was supported by basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) grant funded by the korean government ( 2011 - 0012111 ) . dongsoo kim was supported by basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) grant funded by the korean government ( 2010 - 0002678 ) . giancarlo urza was supported by the fondecyt inicio grant funded by the italian government ( 11110047 ) . in this paper we introduced a family of locally compact finite godeaux groups , the @ xmath5 - 1 di##visor smoothing of four smooth @ xmath41 - curves self smoothing the singular surface @ xmath69 ; # [ see : self - smoothing - of - curves ] . this is the way to describe the campedelli surface with boundary x . in particular , we have the only stable model of the singular surface @ xmath69 . in particular , we have a smooth complex projective surface @ xmath42 with four curves @ xmath70 , @ xmath70 , @ xmath71 , @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 smooth . thus @ xmath42 is a singular surface ( cf . kollr - smith - barron @ xcite , barron @ xcite ) . we also know that the versal @ xmath3 - gorenstein - smoothing @ xmath74 ( cf . hacking @ xcite ) is smooth and @ xmath43 smooth , and that the @ xmath3 - gorenstein smoothings of @ xmath42 are simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces . in particular , this means that there are simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces whose stable model has only one @ xmath70 -;
