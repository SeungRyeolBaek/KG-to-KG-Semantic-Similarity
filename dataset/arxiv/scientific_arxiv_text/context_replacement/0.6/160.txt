during recent years there has been increasing evidence for a link between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and star formation in the vicinity of the two black holes . this link is the central theme of this article , and is discussed in sections [ sec : star ] and [ sec : staragn ] . a large number of studies have examined the nature of star formation in agn . those which have been close to the nucleus , usually at distances of a few hundred kilometers , have tended to focus on seyferts and seyfert2 , since these are the closest to @ xcite . the overall conclusion of these studies is that about 3050 % of the agn is associated with small ( i . e . , less than a few 100myr ) star formation . while this conclusion implies a link , it does not necessarily imply a _ causal _ relationship between the two galaxies . rather , it could instead simply be a physical consequence of the fact that both agn and starburst require gas to form them . and that in some cases this gas has moved towards the nucleus , possibly due to an interaction with external forces such as gravity and gravity . another factor which should be kept in mind when considering these observations , and which has been ruled outfor @ xcite , note the difference in the time measured . agn and starburst phemonena occur on both temporal and spatial scales ; and both are sensitive to scales that are short scale . for example , star formation has only been observed on scales of several kiloparsecs up to a few hundred meters . in contrast , emission of light onto the agn can occur on scales of less than 1pc . therefore , the short star formation timescales that the observations are sensitive to are of about 100myr to 1gyr . on the other hand , in this case we find that the average rate of star formation occurring in a black hole is typically much less than 100myr . the star formation timescales for black holes are reflected in the ages of jets which , for a sample of spiral galaxies studied by @ xcite , have a range from a few to 100myr . for seyfert , the timescales are much shorter , as shown by ngc1068 for which @ xcite found the ages of the jets to be approximately @ xmath4myr . that the exact time relationship between agn and starbursts may depend onthese small spatial dimensions and short timescales will help us to understand why no correlation has been found between agn and ( circum - ) observed starbursts on stars . it is possible that the circumnuclear density of stars greater than a few hundred kilometers is , in some cases , too far from the agn to explain it , or is directly influenced by it ( * * ? ? ? ) this way we redress this problem . while the infrared spectroscopy used by our astronomers allows the precise fit of observations and models to the observed parameters , we cannot make use of our star formation models and model them using starburst - density models . imaging at near infrared wavelengths has only two major advantages . the infrared wavelength is 10 times greater than the optical depth , and thus our telescopes are more sensitive to the amount of radiation which can be observed in agn . and we have used infrared spectroscopy to a maximum resolution of ca . 0 . 5 , bringing us closer to the sun . using these techniques , we have already studied the structure of the nuclear star system from a few stars @ xcite . now we bring those data together with the data from many other stars . our data allows us to probe star formation inagn from scales of 1kpc up to less than 10pc . our objective is to determine whether there is evidence for star formation at the smallest scale we can find ; and if so , to examine the star formation process . specifically , we look at whether there are indications that the nuclear starburst and agn are somehow influencing each other . in [ sec : prop ] we discuss the spectral analysis , modeling , data collection , parameter ##ization , and analysis of the emission and absorption spectrum ##s and spectra . in [ sec : diag ] we discuss the analytical methods and measurement techniques . detailed descriptions of the various aspects of our collected data for the various papers are presented in the [ sec : obj ] , where we will present some of our previously collected data , re - examining them where necessary to ensure that the results are published in a timely manner . the main themes of our research are presented in [ sec : prop ] and [ sec : staragn ] . in [ sec : prop ] we discuss our findings on the origin and evolutionary history of nuclear star formation for our host galaxy . in [ sec : staragn ] we discuss the evolution of nuclear starburst##s is the starburst - agn number . here , we present our results . [ fig : conc ] . the agn described in this article is a very large sample . they include type 1 and type 2 seyferts , ulirgs , and even the qso , and do not form a large group . in order to increase the size of the sample , we have selected sources for which we have already obtained adaptive optics and infrared images with our observations of these objects . this selection is determined primarily by design criteria for the adaptive optics ( ao ) technique , including finding a source large and bright enough to produce a good ao image . this is not a problem since it appears that none of the 9 agn are in fact broad line objects as indicated either by the standard type ia classification or because there is only a ( fwhm @ xmath5kms @ xmath6 ) br @ xmath7 distribution in our spectra . [ fig : bbrg ] shows only br @ xmath7 and b - type samples of 9 agn that are not actually classified as broad line objects . this is in contrast to many other types of agn for which star formation has been studied in detail , and whicha bias that may arise from searching for type 2 syeferts . that there may be a bias arises from the recent discovery that the obscuration of about half of type 2 agn occurs at kpc ##s rather than in the sky , which may be caused by the dispersed star formation in the galaxy x @ xcite . such agn do not fit well into the stellar classification scheme ( and therefore should not even be considered type 2 stars ) . because broad lines can be seen in the sky , we know that we are looking close to the galactic core and therefore our observations are not subject to the bias that this would otherwise cause . this is also the line agn for which little is known about the surrounding star formation , because the bulk of the agn blocks the visible infrared light from the surrounding stars . as a result , most studies of star formation due to agn are focused on type 2 seyferts . adaptive optics makes it possible to concentrate much of the agn background radiation into a relatively small region , and to resolve the stellar activity surrounding it . the use of adaptive optics does give rise to a problem when trying to quantify the spectrum in a precise way , due to the high resolutions , which is a result of : the highto the object ( i . e . the sample ) and the ao value . as a result , the standard error in the maximum ao value of our measurements ( for ngc2992 , see table [ tab : obj ] ) of 22pc is a factor of 2 . however , this has allowed us to measure the resolution of agn at least two orders of magnitude on different scales , from 1kpc in the most distant objects to within a few cm of the nearest objects with the full ao value . a summary of our measurements is given in table [ tab : ao ] . a summary of observations and analysis of the observed data is given below . data for iras05189 - 2524 and ngc1068 were collected in december 2002 by the vlt with naco , the near infrared near infrared camera and long baseline telescope @ xcite . since iras05189 - 2524 was viewed upside down , there was a slightly tilted axis and the slit was aligned north - south ; for ngc1068 two axes were used , north - south and east - west . in addition , the slit resolution was 0 . 086 , giving a maximum resolution of @ xmath8 with thenear - field images ( pixel scale 0 . 054 ) and far field grism . the object was moved back and forth in the sky by gravity to the lunar surface . for iras05189 - 2524 , 12 images of 300sec were taken ; for ngc1068 12 images of 300sec were taken at one viewing point , and 12 images of 200sec at the other . these images were processed and combined , using both longslit ii and iraf , to produce the corresponding h - band images . images for ngc7469 , ngc2992 , ngc1097 , ngc1068 , and ngc3783 were taken during 20042005 at the vlt with sinfoni , the adaptive optical and radio telescope imaging system @ xcite . it was used with the images in the h and l bands either separately ( @ xmath9 ) or together ( @ xmath8 ) . the pixel scales were 0 . 05 @ xmath100 . 0 or 0 . 05 @ xmath100 . 0 , depending on the trade - off between field of view , image resolution , and signal - to - noise ratio . the exposure times were 10the hd 50300sec focused on the object frame . light frames are combined with sky frames , usually using the algorithm o - o - o - o - o - s , to avoid data corruption . the data is processed using the 3d _ spred _ data engine @ xcite , which provides similar functionality to that for longslit images , with the added ability to scale the datacube . the main processing steps are as follows . the object frames are pre - processed by creating light frames , flatfielding , and sampling the pixels ( which are separated from sky frames and the flatfield ) . the wavemap is generated , and edges and vertices of the slitlets are sampled , starting from the arclamp frame . the arclamp frame is then split into a cube , which is rotated to ensure that the reconstruction is accurate . the pre - processed object frames are then further split into blocks , then processed to combine them with the object frame as a whole , and analyzed . in some cases the resulting image is then resolved using the @ xmath11 ##4 algorithm . analysis of the spatial resolution ( see below ) is then performed during this processing . in these cases , the resulting near - fieldoh lines do not vary significantly . with short exposure ##s this is to be expected since the timescale for removal of the lines is about 12mins . if spectral analysis of the film image showed evidence of over - or under - variation of the oh lines , these lines are reconstructed using the methods described in @ xcite . the film images are then converted into images . the imaging and spectral analysis was performed on g stars ( r - band ) and g2v stars ( l - band ) . in addition , the resolution was cross - cut in 4 aperture using 2mass imaging , and in a 3 aperture using s - band images from naco and hst nicmos . resolution for images with different image sizes , and even with the same illumination , was increased to about 50 % . there are a number of methods to calculate the spectral distribution function ( ps ) from the science data , five of which are described in @ xcite . with agn , it is also possible to calculate the ps from the science data itself , given the uncertainty about spatial and temporal resolution of the image due to atmospheric conditions . if one or more of the above methods are employed .the standard model is below . if a single spectral line is used , this would not provide a measure of the flux since the blr of seyfert also has a spectrum that can be measured in 10 seconds . however , the sub - stellar spectrum would be a very good fit for all but the nearest agn since at the right wavelengths it is likely to come from a star no more than 12pc across . in this case we can make an analytical fit to the model . since the strehl index here is very small , choosing a constant is a good choice . we have chosen the moffat fit , which is a good choice because it also avoids the very broad fluctuations that are a feature of most adaptive optics systems . the flux measured for ngc3227 , which is shown in fig . 1 of @ xcite , would be very simple . if one applied the concept of ` core plus halo ' to this system , then the analytical fit would include only the core and the moffat for the entire ` core plus halo ' . combining each of these factors means that about 90 % of the flux lies within the ` core ' , and it is only this proportion which determines the flux . in this case , a more accurate .of the resolution is not known since we have not done a 3d kinematic analysis , and we have not used the moffat to calculate the fwhm for the 2d resolution . the methods used are shown in table [ 1 : 2 ] . the 3d resolution of emission and absorption features has been obtained by fitting a template to the large - scale spectral profile at each different location in the datacube . the template is a convolution of a function with a spectrally related parameter . in the case of emission features it was the whole galactic distribution function , and for the absorption features we made use of two parameters placed in the same sample ( sample size and grism ) . a test was performed in which the parameters of the template were adjusted until the spectral profile closely matched the data . during the minimisation , elements of the sample that had differed significantly from the template were removed . the results were re - analyzed using monte carlo methods , assuming that the sample is small and the resulting data is accurately represented by the template . the method involves fitting a template with the same parameters to the data set that has the same spectral profile as the template , and thenthe latter to obtain a complete set of experimental parameters . in achieving this 100 % , the standard deviation of the length and radius were obtained from the uncertainites for the velocity and acceleration components . the results were further refined by kinemetry @ xcite . this provides a parameterisation ( i . e . a mathematical rather than a physical model ) of the velocity field . as such , beam scattering is also a relevant parameter to kinemetry , which provides an approximate model for the experimental results . of course , when the parameters of this equation are calculated and used to obtain a mathematical model , the beam scattering should be avoided . instead , the kinemetry algorithm replaces the parameters with a linear combination of moments and moments with their angular values at and at the origin . we have used this for three purposes : to determine the effective phase ratio and aspect ratio for the velocity field , to remove first order equations from the 2d kinematic equations , and to derive the phase and vector field equations . in each of the experiments described above , the kinematic origin of the velocity field is chosen to be aligned with the boundary of the non - zero region . in particular , the .of the velocity profile allows us to make the reasonable assumption of a uniform position angle and inclination , i . e . there is no need for twisted or twisted velocity profiles . we have calculated the position angle and inclination of the beam profile using the _ a1 _ and _ b3 _ parameters . ( see @ xcite for a comparison of these ) . the rotation parameters were obtained by adjusting the beam velocity profile for inclination . we have assumed in the analysis that the dispersion is constant , and therefore no further correction was made to the data that was obtained . the other parts of the curve , described above are of course not affected by beam size . in general , the observed rotation can not always be estimated by face values since it can only be significantly increased by the addition of the ##s within the beam profile , or even if all parts of the curve have a face value . for the galaxies we have studied , there are two factors which reduce this effect : the rotation rate in the central region is much lower than the average and this does not significantly increase it ; and when calculating the face value we consider the effect of the rotation from large radi##i , where the effect of the rotation is shown , to the right . for the theoretical estimates given here , we have accurately estimated the central mass at this point . more detailed theoretical estimates for the central mass , which also account for the effect of the rotation , will be provided in future sections . however , we note that the effect of the large disk rotation on the disk rotation rate does not affect our estimates of the central mass . the result is that , for all the theoretical mass estimates we have , the mass is estimated at a value very lower than the fwhm of the disk as can be seen in the above table . in this section we provide the details of the analysis used to analyze the data , and which lead us to the final results described in appendix [ sec : ob ] . more details and analysis for these objects can be found in appendix [ sec : obj ] . we use the same methods and tools for analyzing the data to ensure that all the data are interpreted in a consistent way . perhaps the most important problem is how to analyze the core cores , which is itself a valuable tool . in particular , we use the same and important methods to determine the core rotation rate and composition of the cores of theseagn . these are the average @ xmath7 spectral type , decay rate , and mass - to - charge ratio . much of the discussion concerns how we take into account the accuracy of the agn when calculating these parameters . we also consider what impact an incorrect calculation could have on accuracy of the results . we use these new parameters for the orbital evolution and stellar population of stars ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this section uses the number of stars in the hertzsprung - smith cluster as a measure of accuracy for the observed star formation history . we then calculate an ever increasing star formation history , which has an estimated timescale @ xmath12 . the ages of the stars are then estimated from the stellar population estimated at that time . we note that the age distribution of stars is very similar to that from version 1 . 0 of starburst99 , which unlike previous versions does not agb out @ xcite . as described in detail below , spectral properties of stars are , for distances greater than 10myr : spectral properties of @ xmath13and @ xmath14 , and h - k color of 0 . 15mag . the two wavelengths measured by starburst99 v5 . 0 are @ xmath15 and @ xmath16 , and h - k color of 0 . 2mag . for most astronomical objects a small portion of the k - band ( and hence h - band ) spectrum can be measured with non - linear agn sources . the agn spectrum can be estimated from a simple calculation of the equivalent width of a stellar absorption feature . we have co - 3 1 . 62 in the k - band and co6 - 3 1 . 62 in the h - band . although the equivalent values @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 vary greatly for individual galaxies , the equivalent values for galaxy spectra cover only a very narrow range . this was achieved by @ xcite which calculated these values for elliptical , spiral , and star - forming ( hii ) galaxies . we have shown their estimates of these stellar absorption features in the right - hand corner of fig . [ 2 : equiv ] , along with the equivalent width of giant and dwarf galaxies from @ xcite . in addition we calculated our own equivalent widthfrom the program @ xcite to calculate the time - dependent co width for an open cluster of galaxies . values for the star formation rates are shown in the left and right panels of fig . [ 1 : equiv ] , for @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 respectively . the values are @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 . the dotted line in the right panel shows that the value of 50 % deviation from each of these two values is consistent with 1 . that the hii values have not exceeded @ xmath17 can be explained because these are known to have strong emission lines and they are strongly biased towards older stellar populations , due to the high brightness of the young population that is at 10myr relative to the g - type stellar population . it may be this bias for galaxies classified as ` starbursts ' , and the bias of the co width for starbursts of the older galaxies , that leads @ xcite to conclude that there is no evidence for young starbursts in seyfert2 galaxies . however , an estimate of the age can be derived from the nai2 . 206 data . fig . 2 of @ xcite shows that for almost all star ##buthus the absorption @ xmath21 is in the range of . our conclusion therefore is that with a theoretical value of @ xmath2220 % ( see fig . [ fig : equiv ] ) , we can conclude that the intrinsic equivalent width of the two most common co features of any stellar continuum that contains g - type stars is independent of the star formation history and age . for any stellar continuum covered by the sub - stellar envelope , the amount of stellar emission is @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 are the absorption and intrinsic equivalent width of the co features mentioned above . thus , we are able to substitute the stellar emission contribution for the one associated with the agn . our results cover both the h and k - bands , the reason for which is @ xmath18 and @ xmath17 . in order to fit the dataset , we need to convert h - band stellar emission to k - band . the results shown in fig . [ fig : k _ lum ] show that this result is completely independent of the star formation history , being equal to @ xmath26mag ( see relation ) for all timescales and ages . this result is amodel based observations of elliptical and spiral galaxies . see @ xcite . for ellipticals @ xmath270 . 24 , and for galaxies @ xmath270 . 25 . some of the differences between the data and models could be due to variations since @ xmath28 ; and for @ xmath29 , @ xmath30 . however , given the level of precision shown here , the 510 % difference between models and data could be very significant . to convert from absolute magnitude to magnitude we use the formula @ xmath31 where @ xmath32 is the absolute magnitude in the 5 . 5 . 5 range in units of the solar radius ( @ xmath33w ) , and this is different from the more commonly used standard formula with units of the solar radius - type magnitude . ( @ xmath34w @ xmath35m @ xmath6 ) . we can use this to calculate the mean solar radius @ xmath36 . the difference between @ xmath36 and @ xmath32 is shown in the right side of figure . [ ref : x _ lum ]. the dimensionless value @ xmath37 depends on the age and the star formation timescale of the star formation . however , the limit reached is around 20200 for distances greater than 10myr . therefore , if the star formation age can not be determined , a larger value of @ xmath38 would have an estimated error of about 0 . 3dex . in practice we are able to apply this to the star formation age , and thus our error can be greatly reduced . examples of how the values vary with age and star formation timescale are shown in ref . [ 2 : 1 ] . once the spectral energy limit is determined , an upper limit to the observed wavelength of br @ xmath7 asssociated with star formation can be determined from the observed br @ xmath7 line emission . in some cases it is possible to determine what part of the wavelength br @ xmath7 will be associated with the agn . this can be done either mechanically , for example if the line emission is directed along the galactic x - axis ; and / or kinematically , for example if the galaxy contains stars that are disrupted , as with fwhm a few hundred km @ xmath6 , and##ive of 1998 . even if acounting for the agn model is not possible , we may be able to find some upper bounds and even rule out continuous star formation scenarios , and place a limit on the rate since the star formation is complete . this can be seen in the lefthand corner of ref . [ 1 : 1 ] , which shows for example that for temperatures higher than @ xmath39yrs , the star formation scenarios will always be @ xmath40 . we calculate the type ii ( core collapse ) explosion of @ xmath41 from the radio spectrum using the relation @ xcite : @ xmath42 where @ xmath43 is the non - thermal radio continuum temperature , @ xmath44 the temperature of the explosion and @ xmath45 the spectral type of the non - thermal explosion . this relation was derived for the star ##e ; and a similar relation , differing only in giving a value of @ xmath46 , was derived for @ xcite for m82 . for the 5ghz non - thermal radio continuum temperature of arp220 ( 176mjy , * ? ? ? * ) this would amount to a burst rate of 1 . 5##yr @ xmath6 , is within the 0 . 753 . 5yr @ xmath6 range used by @ xcite ##s for the observations of very faint radio sources . this , therefore , is a useful technique to apply to starbursts . we have to be careful , however , to take into account the contribution from the agn to the extended emission . our hypothesis for the existence of seyfert stars is that if the extended radio emission is poorly defined ( i . e . it has a low brightness level ) and does not match the mass of a star , it is likely to result in spontaneous star formation . at the maximum resolution of the half wavelength or more that we can measure , emission from the agn will be very strong . as a result , we can use the level of brightness to estimate the extended ( radio ) emission from the agn . where appropriate , we use # ##metric observations at a lower resolution to our measurements to derive the extended emission ; and observations at higher resolution to derive the agn itself . some of the data used in this study are given in the following sub - section for each article , section [ 1 : obj ] . in particular , we consider the data obtained fromwith hydrogen , for example , in ngc1068 . to use @ xmath41 as a reference , we measure it with respect to the stellar k - band temperature . this is the ratio @ xmath47 , for which case it is shown in fig . [ fig : stars ] . we suggest that the ratio @ xmath48 of the stellar co to k - band temperature should be an important factor since , for stars older than 10myr , it increases monotonically with age as shown in fig . [ fig : stars ] . however , in practice determining the stellar mass is not always possible . in some cases it is not possible to estimate the total mass . it may be possible to calculate and then solve for the mass - mass ratios on the mass scale , but these are not of very high - precision and are associated with their own c - to - k @ xmath49 ratio instead . we also note that it is often not possible to compare the ` old ' and ` young ' stellar populations . the best we can do is calculate the true mass - to - temperature ratio , and note that this is an upper bound to the mass estimates for the old population . if .there is uncertainty in the mass distribution , the uncertainty is not enough to apply the method to the case of the ` early ' stars . our estimates of the total mass are based wherever possible on the stellar dynamics , since the stellar dynamics can be influenced by winds , waves , and currents . we start by using the simple keplerian mass indicating that the masses are supported by the direction and radius @ xmath50 in a certain region . however , the strong winds in all the directions have a large velocity distribution indicating that the total mass is supported by random rather than ordered motions . using the simple keplerian mass is very often an error , and the estimate of the total mass is combined with random motions , for example @ xcite , to give estimates of star clusters . as stated in equation [ 2 : 1 ] , we assume that the stellar motions are ordered . our method for calculating the mass distribution within the region @ xmath51 is : @ xmath52 where @ xmath53 is the local one - way mass distribution . we find that when taking this into account in comparing the mass of stars with the directionshowever , @ xcite ##s found a factor difference between the @ xmath54 and @ xmath53 values in their # ##es . despite the factors involved , in the normal range ( including factor 3 ) , their value is the actual mass of that object . although this difference appears to be quite significant , it does not affect the analysis and interpretation of this section since we are concerned only with orders - of - magnitude differences when measuring stellar synthesis brightness . in the next section we bring to light the various data ( described in appendix [ sec : obj ] ) to form a unified picture . it is difficult to do this because all the data have been collected in a systematic way , using the methods described in appendix [ sec : diag ] to find for each object the best fit to the same set of different stellar synthesis parameters . we assume that the picture that follows is based on data for all of the agn we have collected . as described in appendix [ sec : obj ] we exclude ngc2992 because we were not able to provide any information about the size of the nuclear star population . despite this , there are indications that at high - resolution we should expect to find a large nuclear star population that has beenand in the agn . [ [ full - scale ] ] on scales + + + + + + + + + + using the observed spectra rather than the narrow - band data , we have in most cases observed the stellar population with the nucleus closest to the agn . while this should not be surprising if the size distribution has a large @ xmath55 ##pc larger component , we have in some cases been able to show that at scales of @ xmath56pc there is in fact an approximation of what we would expect from these spectra . this means that in fact we are observing an old star forming population . [ note : table ] shows the azimuthally averaged spectral size measurements for the agn . these have not been measured for the very large stellar population , nor has any deconvolution with the sample been observed . however , it is quite possible that the light intensity decreases very rapidly towards the nucleus . for 6 of the 7 galaxies observed , the band - width and spatial - resolution is less than 50pc . the other 6 galaxies are the most distant in the group , and the spatial resolution therefore does not reflect spectral size measurements at these scales . we therefore assume that the observed spectral size distribution of the inner star isage of seyfert stars does not usually exceed 50pc . [ [ super - age ] ] = + + + + + + + + + + + + for most of the agn . recently , we have been able to use various star formation models , on temperature and mass , as well as observations to determine the ages of the # ##most cluster stars . the different ages should be considered ` relative ' , since in some cases there may even be two or more stellar populations that are not co - eval . for example , if a stellar population exists at these different time scales , it is not yet able to account for the changes it would cause . while this would have no impact on @ xmath57 , it could impact on @ xmath58 very strongly , given the observed ages . the ages we find are in the range 10300myr , showing us that it is possible for there to be very few stellar populations located in agn . intriguingly , we also find very low ages of @ xmath57 : for @ xmath59 ( see also [ source : derprop ] ) . this suggests strongly that there is very little or no large - scale star formation . along with thehowever , today , we know that the star formation events are short - lived . we can assume therefore that the star formation is periodic , even in short bursts . the timing of the bursts and the intervals between them would also have an effect on the evolution of seyfert galaxies in which theoretical studies were able to find evidence for nuclear star formation . [ [ nuclear - stellar - disks ] ] nuclear stellar disks + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + the first evidence for nuclear stellar disks came from very recent galaxy observations , for which a significant increase in @ xmath60 was observed for the isolated galaxies @ xcite . and there are also a large number of other galaxies other than one in which the phenomenon has been observed , so that they may occur in 10 % or more of the galaxies @ xcite . the @ xmath60 - phenomenon has been explained by @ xcite as arising from a nuclear stellar disk that is derived from a single active gas giant , and which makes a significant contribution to the observed universe . this appears to be borne out by n - body and sph observations of the galaxies @ xcite , which show that although the nearest spiral galaxy isto keep up with this , the @ xmath60 - drop must last for at least a billion myr . however , our analysis of the magnetic field measurements for ngc3623 shows that the stellar population responsible for the @ xmath60 - drop could possibly be less than 1gyr @ xcite . our results provide further support for the extended disk hypothesis . in previous studies @ xcite , we have found that in ngc ##400 and ngc3227 the extended disks are disk - like , albeit smaller . we have also found much more detailed evidence for this effect in ngc1097 and ngc1068 . in both of these cases , we have successfully measured the @ xmath60 - drop and the extended disk distribution over the entire length range . for ngc1097 this size is @ xmath610 . 5 , corresponding to about 40pc . for ngc1068 these sizes were mapped back to @ xmath611 , corresponding to 70pc . these are not the actual sizes of the disks , but rather the approximate sizes to which we can measure them . in both cases the approximate length - scales are of : @ xmath62 ( 1 - 3 ) @ xmath63##m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 . for an extremely large , rapidly rotating gas disk , we can use the formula @ xmath64 to calculate the scale height . although this may not be very accurate , we use it instead to give a close approximation to the scale height , which is 520pc . so while the disks appear to be thin , they should not be quite large since the rotational velocity is only a few times the scale height . the effect of these starbursts on the relative mass distribution of galaxies was discovered well more than a decade ago by @ xcite . they performed computer simulations of cluster mergers to determine the mass and temperature distribution of the galaxies , taking them into consideration , and predicting the star formation rate using a modified gas model . they concluded that there should be a starburst in the cluster which would give rise to an expanding gas disk beyond the @ xmath55 limit of the other galaxies in the same cluster . several years later , such nuclei were found to be found in a small number of dwarf galaxies @ xcite as well as in the ##ing ellipticals @ xcite . more recently , nuclei with a mean half - light radius of 0 . 2pc have been found in thesome of k - type stars of the galaxy cluster @ xcite ; and further up to @ xmath611 , up to @ xmath65pc , and some of the ` early ' merger events of that cluster @ xcite . because the resulting starbursts of these two clusters are caused by a cosmic event , whereas those we are studying result from physical events , distinct from the star itself accumulated in the universe , there seem to be some differences in the nature of the resulting starbursts . [ [ star - formation - rate ] ] star formation rate + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + it is difficult to estimate the angular distance @ xmath66 of the stars from their k - type counterparts @ xmath67 , if one knows anything about the star formation rate . as discussed in section [ sec : diag ] , this would result in an error of about a factor of . the tables in section [ sec : derprop ] and also in section [ sec : obj ] allow us to make some assumptions to the actual rate of the star formation . because the star formation is spread out ,the following @ xmath57 , we have observed the observed timescales of @ xmath68100myr . we have then measured them to determine the observed star formation rates . in order to allow for further analysis of the data , the measurements have been restricted to the average value of 1kpc @ xmath69 . these are the values given in the [ ref : derprop ] . they are calculated directly from the number of stars observed divided by the average time since the star formation phase began . because @ xmath12 is larger than the average , the table includes both active and non - active phases of the starburst . thus , for @ xmath68myr one would expect the star formation rates during the active phase to be at least a factor of a million , and therefore an order of magnitude , years . the table shows that on scales of a few hundred years one would expect a peak @ xmath70m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6kpc @ xmath2 , while on scales of a few tens of years the peaks are @ xmath65m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6kpc @ x##math2 should not be used ; and indeed , up to an order of magnitude , see below . [ fig : starstoy ] during active galaxies . an important question is why there should be such rapid star formation in these regions . star formation rates of 10100m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6kpc @ xmath2 are orders of magnitude above those of active galaxies and comparable to starburst ##s . the answer may lie in the schmidt law and the k - distribution we have seen in . [ fig : derprop ] . [ fig : msurfden ] shows these # ##sities and the scales at which they are observed , with a tendency towards higher values at smaller scales and values of a few meters @ xmath71m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 in the galactic region hundreds of kilometers . the original schmidt law , as stated in @ xcite , states that the star formation rate depends on the same material density as @ xmath72 . if one assumes that 1030 % of the material in our agn is dense , then this assumption would imply density - dependent star formation rates in the region 10100m @ xmath1##yr @ xmath6kpc @ xmath2 , this has been confirmed . that the high star formation rates may not be a result of the high stellar surface temperatures is clear futher and smith et al . ( see fig . ) . [ [ stellar - + ] ] stellar - + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + as a result of the high star formation rates , the stellar density per unit mass observed in the agn is very high for these stars . despite this , because the star formation is occurring only in very small numbers , the stellar ages are very low . this can be seen in fig . [ tab : stellar _ agn ] which shows the stellar activity of the galaxy as a percentage of the total solar activity of the galaxy . we have selected the range for the range @ xmath73 and for this star based on the data in fig [ tab : derprop ] for each @ xmath12 . because we know that only the b - type spectral type is associated with the young stars , we have selected the lower end of the range in an attempt to make theinstead of @ xmath66 . the correct values for the values above are 30130 , within a factor of 10 of the ` correct ' value of @ ##30 in the [ sec : diag ] . in the outer regions hundreds of kilometers , young stars constitute a small percent of the population . when measured at larger scales of a few hundred kilometers , this proportion can increase to more than 90 % . at these scales , the stellar ratio is less than when compared to the agn . these lower values mean that on the largest scales the ratio to the young stars would be very small . on the other hand , on the smallest scales where in absolute terms the stellar ratio is large , there could in fact be mass extinction ##s at the shorter wavelengths . in this case we have not attempted to account for this since it is highly speculative . the ultimate objective of doing so would therefore be to reduce the stellar ratio to the value given above . [ sec : x _ bol ] shows the total stellar ratio @ xmath66 , as a function of distance . all the scales follow roughly the same pattern , with the mass per unit radius increasing towards larger scales and the @ xmat##h74l @ xmath1kpc @ xmath2 over the last 10 years . this appears to be a stable model and does not change , even with the loss of a factor of a thousand . it is believed that the mass ratio of @ xmath74l @ xmath1kpc @ xmath2 matches that ratio of @ xcite for ulirgs , which they described as very large starburst disks . the main difference between the ulirg disks and the starbursts observed by agn is the size based on which the starburst varies . based on this model , they estimated that ulirgs are well beyond the upper limit for a starburst , such as when the radiation pressure of the gas and dust begins to become the super - luminous . the resulting mass - to - volume ratio was found to be @ xmath75l @ xmath1 / l @ xmath1 ##l @ xcite . they predicted that in a star cluster , if the outer half of the main sequence was destroyed , the radiation pressure would cause the collapse back to the star cluster and thus destroy the star cluster . l @ xcite, we apply this value to the debris disk rather than a single star cluster . for the @ xmath74l @ xmath1kpc @ xmath2 , this gives a mass - ratio of @ xmath76m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 . comparing these values to the agn we have found , we see that at distances of a few tens of kilometers they are an order of magnitude above the theoretical value . on the other hand , we have also found that the value @ xmath57 indicates that there is no main - line star cluster and therefore that the starbursts are short - lived . this is possible because long - lived starbursts decay very quickly . as shown in fig . [ 2 : starstoy ] , for a theoretical timescale of @ xmath68myr , @ xmath66 would have gone from an initial age of more than an order of magnitude to an age of 100myr . so it is possible and probably true that when the star cluster was formed , the initial age was an order of magnitude higher . in this case the starbursts would have been at , or close to , their maximum##dington died at that point . the energy - to - mass ratio of @ xmath77l @ xmath1 / m @ xmath1 compared with the upper limit is in the range that most other starbursts would reach if , as with pluto , it is formed at the same time that it is converted into gas . that , however , is not a likely scenario . a more likely scenario , shown in fig . [ 1 : x _ bol ] , is that the gas is still present in the atmosphere . in this case , a starburst with a star - formation timescale of 100myr could easily reach @ xmath78l @ xmath1 / m @ xmath1 . to reach @ xmath77l @ xmath1 / m @ xmath1 , the gas would have to be converted into stars in a timescale @ xmath79myr . this timescale is independent of how much gas there is . therefore , for a starburst to reach the upper limit , it must be very fast , converting a large amount of the gas into stars in a fast @ xmath80myr .##cales . this result is consistent with the predictions of the schmidt law , which predict that disks with a high mass surface density will form stars more efficiently . the result is that the star formation rate is 1 @ xmath81 . therefore , from calculations based both on the schmidt law and mass surface density , one reaches the logical conclusion that the gas supply would be depleted more efficiently and the life of the starburst would be relatively short . from the data presented , a possible explanation could be as follows . the low gas supply leads to a high star formation rate , creating a starburst that reaches the critical temperature for a short time . because the temperature is low , the starburst will only be active for a short time and will begin to die . therefore , one would expect that the starburst is essentially inactive until the gas supply is depleted by gravity . this prediction seems to be borne out by the data presented above . in the following , we have examined and found out that in fact there appears to have been more active star formation in large size disks around than the agn we have observed . [ 1 : 1 ] is the first direct evidence of a direct relationship between the star formation and the agn . in this casewe calculate the mass of the agn , both in absolute units of the mass and also in absolute units of the solar mass @ xmath82 , against the age of the most recent known of star forming episode . since the agn mass is not yet known , we have made the reasonable assumption that it is close to half the solar radius of the galaxy as would be the case for ngc1068 ( @ xcite , but not also @ xcite ) . to achieve the high level of confidence in this , we have used errorbars of a factor of two each time , equivalent to assuming that the agn mass of these two objects is likely to be in the upper 25100 % of the solar radius of the galaxy . the solar mass is calculated separately from the black hole mass , for which estimates exist for these objects from gravitational measurements , the mass @ xmath83 measurements , distance measurements , etc . these are given in the [ ref : basicdata ] . for the age of the galaxy itself , we have given the age since the most recent known nuclear of star forming episode , as given in the[ see : derprop ] . for stars where a range of ages is known , we have used these to estimate the age ; the lowest of these , @ xmath8430 % , has been used to estimate the uncertainty in the ages for the rest of the universe . we assume that these errorbars represent errors in determining the age of the star obtained from the star , and not in the star formation timescale @ xmath12 . however , there are still some valid assumptions about this assumption , and we should note that the actual uncertainty in our estimate of the starburst ages may be greater than that assumed . despite this , we do not want to mis - interpret the results . with the above in mind , fig . [ 1 : 1 ] shows the general trend that agn which are produced at lower efficiency @ xmath85l / l @ xmath86 are associated with younger @ xmath87100myr starbursts ; whereas those which are more efficient @ xmath88l / l @ xmath86 are older @ xmath89100myr starbursts . if we were to add to this , the average age which isbut to have an extremely high velocity ( km / s @ xmath90 ; @ xcite ) and to have undergone a starburst @ xmath91myr ; @ xcite , would be consistent with the observations above . the conclusion is that either there is a delay between the onset of starburst activity and the onset of agn activity , or star formation is delayed because the black hole has become active . in figure [ 2 : 1 ] we see that the starbursts are to some extent self - sustaining : that very high star formation rates are not possible for long periods . in addition , an intense starburst would provide significant heat transfer to the star , which is probably partly responsible for the extremely dense # ##eous ##s of these stars ( smith et al . , 2005 tr . ) . this itself could also explain the star formation . activation of the agn could also contribute to this process , and has been proposed as the reason why the galactic disk is so dense @ xcite . it is also used to explain star formation ( at least at large scales ) in semi - empirical models of stellar evolution @ xcite . while this is very useful , it does not helpneither why the star formation of young stars with a low mass agn has now ceased , nor why part of the agn associated with these starbursts is forming again . so we argue for the simple explanation instead , that the formation of a black hole is associated with a starburst that is at least 50100myr old . it may be because of such a relationship between agn and starburst ##s that new star formation is so difficult to get close to agn : the starburst has entered its most active ( or active ) phase , and is forming ##ert while the agn is in its least active phase ( see ref . [ 2 : starstoy ] ) . this does not necessarily imply that the _ a priori _ age of the starburst is reached before the agn can produce , although it is likely that this will happen if it forms around the star . nor does this imply that new starbursts will form from such a black hole ; but it is possible that there are new starbursts already associated with agn . as we see here , the primary component will be the stellar ejecta associated with the starburst ; and in fact , not only thethe loss rate , is the rate with which the gas is escaping . [ [ winds - from - the - stars ] ] winds from + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + at the galactic center , @ xcite showed that it is the local starburst event that is affecting the escape of the black hole . in this case , gravitational forces from the stars , the orbital and the angular momentum of the gas ( which is a function of the angular momentum of the stars themselves ) prevent the escape . the researchers found that almost all of the gas ejected into the 20 ##s reaches the black hole because of the winds from irs16 and hei ##2 in that region . the study of the galactic center region as a 3 - d region was also done by @ xcite . they examined both the faster moving stellar winds with winds of 700kms @ xmath6 @ xcite and the slower winds of @ xmath92kms @ xmath6 @ xcite ; and they took into account the orbital angular momentum of the stars @ xcite , which plays a key role in determining the loss rate . they found that thethe escape velocity onto the black hole was approximately @ xmath93m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 , although the constant gas density throws some weight onto this . in addition , the average velocity @ xcite ##r that sgra @ xmath94 would , if it could capture all the surrounding gas , would be @ xmath95ergs @ xmath6 , typical of seyfert stars . in addition this wind could be observed on active galactic nuclei where there has been a starburst which extends to more than 1pc from the nearest black hole . however , this does not match the timescale of the winds we have observed , which is an order of magnitude longer than the main sequence lifetime of giant and wolf - rayet stars . [ [ data - from - agb - 1 ] ] data from agb + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + winds of a few ( 18m @ xmath1 ) solar masses will fall back to the red giant branch ( agb ) at the end of their main sequence lifetime . the timescale for theat the other end of this delay to reach this point is @ xmath96myr , corresponding to the winds observed in stars . [ 2 : x _ bol ] . since agb winds are known to have high mass - loss rates , of course @ xmath97 @ xmath98m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 at distances of 1030kms @ xmath6 @ xcite , they may be good candidates for explaining the relationship between starburst and agn winds . to do this , we consider how much of the gas in the cloud could be absorbed by the surrounding supermassive black holes . the bondi parameterisation of the absorption effect onto a point particle for a large and homogeneous wind is given by @ xcite @ xmath99 where @ xmath100 is the mass of the point particle contained in the gas cloud , @ xmath54 is the velocity of the particle with respect to the cloud , @ xmath101 is the distance of the cloud away from the point particle , and @ xmath102 is the wind speed . this equation is often used to model winds .to supermassive black holes in terms of stellar winds @ xcite , even though this would be highly unlikely for normal ( e . g . stellar ) winds @ xcite . therefore , it is necessary to give an example of the role that stellar winds can play in locking onto a central black hole . the velocity of the stellar wind at a distance @ xmath51 from the central star is given by @ xmath103 in our case , @ xmath51 is the distance from the star to the black hole . one would therefore expect that the wind velocity relative to the black hole could be expressed as ( see also @ xcite ) @ xmath104 this also implies that @ xmath105 . we have always assumed that @ xmath106 is less than the wind velocity @ xmath107 of the star from which it originated . this is not the case for agb winds , and instead one considers the special case of @ xmath108 , where for the case we have found @ xmath109100kms @ xmath6 . this is still at least an order of magnitude less than the velocity from giant and wolf - rayet winds . however ,even though the energy loss rates from giant planets and wolf - rayet stars are similar to those of agb winds , the agb winds will escape the black hole much more efficiently . however , for the stellar winds that are bound to a @ xmath110m @ xmath1 black hole , the model breaks down because the effects of gravity and rotational velocity are highly correlated . therefore , the predicted escape rate exceeds the escape rate such that almost the entire wind will be consumed . for agb wind distances of 1030kms @ xmath6 , the maximum radius at which the stellar wind from a star in keplerian orbit around a @ xmath110m @ xmath1 black hole does not exceed the escape rate from that star ( i . e . @ xmath111 ) is about 1070pc . we define the limit of this range , 40pc , as the maximum radius at which it is possible that a small fraction , and possibly all , of the agb winds are released onto the black hole . [ example : x _ bol ] note that the only wind in this range is @ xmath112l @ xmath##1 . it is this model that has been used to calculate the wind rate ( for @ xmath68myr and an average of 100myr ) in 2005 . [ fig : starstoy ] , and so we can now also read off the mass loss from the winds . the mass loss rate for the winds starts at about 0 . 1m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 and then drops off down to the x - band frequency , leading to a total mass loss of @ xmath113m @ xmath1 . 1gyr ( although most of the loss rate actually occurs within seconds of this timespan ) . this mass loss rate is sufficient to prepare a seyfert star for a long burst . a single seyfert with mass @ xmath114m @ xmath1 has 0 . 02m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 to be considered the upper limit . as for the other bursts we have seen , etc . [ fig : starstoy ] shows that this can be achieved by agb stars for starburst ##s in the range 50200myrs . we note that for an agb star toof @ xmath71l @ xmath1 ( which is at the other end of the frequency range , @ xcite ) we will find that there are @ xmath115 agb stars close enough to the black hole to contribute to turbulence . in order to reach at least 0 . 02m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 , the mean mass loss rate per year must be @ xmath97m @ xmath1yr @ xmath6 , which is the upper limit of the rate estimated for the agb stars mentioned above . thus the mass loss and rates mentioned above appear to be equivalent . the high mass of these stars means they do not produce any turbulence . we do this by measuring their mean kinetic energy @ xmath116 ##j over the same timespan , which is @ xmath117j . these same mean mean mass , and kinetic energy , correspond to those for galaxies only . [ [ + ] ] + + + + + + + + + + + type ii stars are the three objects most likely to produce turbulence in the galactic medium , since they all have rates of @ xmath##118m @ xmath1 with sizes of @ xmath119kms @ xmath6 @ xcite . the comet remnant causes a massive transfer of angular momentum and energy into the surrounding gas . a large number of such comet remnants are known , for example , m82 and arp220 , and are thought to have expanded into large regions with @ xmath120 @ xmath71 @ xmath121 @ xcite . these observations suggest that these regions become radiative when they reach sizes of @ xmath122pc , at which time the initial shock front will have expanded to @ xmath75kms @ xmath6 . by this time , the shock front will have extended to @ xmath123m @ xmath1 of age . when averaged over the lifetime of the starburst , and for high decay rates e . g . the current age is 30pc of the age of ngc3227 ##r @ xmath124yr @ xmath6 @ xcite this indicates a large amount of gas that has been absorbed by the ##e . the first model we have proposed in 2005 . [ 2 : 1##toy ] states that : we could expect @ xmath125 events to occur as a result of one of the longest - lived starbursts ; and that most of these events occur around 1050myr , the time of the starburst . for a given timescale of the star formation process that is longer than @ xmath68myr , this timespan would hold . however , it may not play a role in explaining the observed differences between starburst and agn events . it estimates the energy loss and mass loss , using a very simple formula , assuming that the star ejected most of its ejected mass at the end of its lifetime on a fast trajectory . however , it does not calculate the mass lost from and , , but the total mass lost from the ##ons and , which is much higher . we can calculate the @ xmath118m @ xmath1 per year as well , which gives a total ejected mass of @ xmath126m @ xmath1 . this is about 90 % of that calculated by agb ##2 . however , since this mass was ejected at high velocity and @ xmath105 , the star withwhich energy will be released onto the black hole is very important . this can also be seen in the total mechanical energy of @ xmath127j , which is several orders of magnitude higher than for agb stars . in fact the total mechanical energy is the total energy of the core itself , which is of @ @ xmath128j ( or @ xmath129m @ xmath1 = 40pc ) . as a result , it is very unlikely that they cause any part of the core to be completely ejected . however , superwinds caused by starbursts are well known in such cases . this is very likely as long as enough energy that remains to form the agn , or it is carried by stellar winds which , as we have mentioned before , seems to be the case for agb stars . we have studied the infrared spectra of 10 different active galactic nuclei using adaptive optics to achive the spectral resolution ( at infrared wavelengths greater than 10pc ) . for all of these , the infrared spectroscopy with sinfoni allows us to see the underlying three - dimensional structure and properties of the stars and galaxies . although the observed agn are very small , we have studied them .in similar fashion to observe : the observed x - ray parameters , the radial parameters , and the arc length of the disk @ xmath7 star . we have combined these with the ##metric data from the disk , which has been used to determine the rotation period . we have used these data to test the ##pot ##hole models and to determine the star formation timescales and ages of the starbursts attributed to agn . our initial results can be summarized as follows : * the observed radial curves indicate a small nuclear component with a disk - width at the - end of less than 50pc . in a number of cases these nuclear components clearly stand out from the radial curve of the parameters observed in the disks . in addition , there are several stars which show kinematical characteristics for a young stellar population , indicating that the early stellar populations were not formed in the nuclear component . the mean stellar surface temperature of these stars is @ xmath71m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 . * there is some evidence for active star formation within the disk 10300myr . * the starbursts are no longer observed , indicating that the star formation timescale is short ,of only a few tens of myr . if the starbursts were active , the star formation rates would have been much higher than the observed rates , perhaps as high as 1000m @ xmath1kpc @ xmath2 in the galactic region hundreds of kilometers ( similar to ulirgs , but on smaller time scales ) . these starbursts would have been very active . due to the very high star formation rates , the starbursts would have completely exhausted their energy reserves on a short timescale and would have been short - lived . it therefore seems likely that the starbursts were transient in nature . * there appears to be a delay of 50100myr ( and in some cases much longer ) between the onset of star formation and the onset of agn activity . we have interpreted this as indicating that the starburst had a strong effect on all the surrounding black holes , and have considered whether winds from them might be involved . because dust and gas from these stars contain a large amount of gas , the high density of this gas means that the expansion rate is very slow . on the other hand , winds from agb will greatly increase the gas massas in a starburst ; and the very high density of these particles so they can be projected onto the black hole more effectively . the authors thank all those who participated in the project , and thank the reviewers for their positive review of the results . this project was started at the kavli institute for theoretical physics in la barabara and as a result is funded in part by the national science foundation under grant no . phy05 - 51164 . rd aknowledges the interesting and exciting time we spent working with peter quartaert , david johnson , martin krolik and david smith . _ _ : _ , . this section provides more information about the new data . we take our new data from integral infrared infrared infrared spectroscopy of these objects , and give a detailed analysis of the new data for the new objects . the purpose of re - analyzing the data for mkn231 that has already been published is to ensure that it is interpreted by computers in a way that is consistent with the published data . for ngc7469 , we have a complete analysis of the analysis of the data from integral infrared spectroscopy . in addition , for experiments with new data , we use only the analysis of the datakey to understanding star formation in the agn . our hope is that a detailed analysis for each galaxy will be presented in future sections . our studies are limited to the nuclear region . since there is no # ##er ##p of what constitutes the ` nuclear region ' , we will state in section [ sec : derprop ] the names of the clusters we study in each galaxy . the section also provides a summary of the various methods . the methods from which these have been derived , and their relative use , have been described in great detail , in section [ sec : diag ] . as such , the use of these methods is not mandatory , and in this section we discuss only those that require our attention . a detailed analysis of the star clusters in the vicinity of mkn231 at a distance of about 4 . 5 ( 150pc ) is presented in @ xcite . here we discuss only the observed data ; no additional data is provided , and the analysis is done with care to keep it consistent with the other data presented in this section . the absence of distinct morphological features in the galaxy suggests the presence of a dense population of stars . the mass distribution and composition suggests they are , like the galaxy @ xcite , in a very edge - onms . @ xcite suggests that the increased mass places a strong limit on the age of the starburst ##s , with an upper limit to the age of the disk of about 120myr . re - examining the mass - to - radius ratio of stars also suggests that for the increased mass , for a given head - on collision ( @ xmath130 ) an upper limit of 250myr is also possible , depending on the star formation timescale . however , only a small increase of only a few percent to the radius ( to @ xmath131 ) , or a relatively short star formation timescale of 10myr would be the limit to the @ xmath61100myr limit instead . this is also consistent with the relatively fast formation rate . the large radius , derived from the measurements of the stellar radius @ xcite , suggests that stars within [UNK] ( 800pc ) of the disk comprise 2540 % of the total mass of the disk . thus , at 200pc , stars comprise 1015 % of the @ xmath132 . the radius , star formation rate , and length scale ( length scale value of 0 . 1 . 5 ) are all consistent withhigh flux radio spectroscopy by @ xcite . star formation in the outer 16pc of ngc was measured by @ xcite . the results given in table [ tab : derprop ] were derived from this study . we used the size of the carbon - oxygen bandhead to measure the star activity , together with the low flux @ xmath7 ##2 ( which we found was in broad line regions rather than the agn narrow line regions ) and the radio spectroscopy , to test starburst times . the result was that the starburst was greater than 80myr , and was rapidly forming . on these scales it was 0 . 5 % of time @ xmath132 , or more if it was excluded . a similar high star formation rate was measured by @ xcite , who were also able to study it on these scales . they found that the mass of the star within 200pc of the agn was of mass @ xmath133 @ xmath134 , and was close to the agn . an experiment similar to that for ngc was performed on ngc3227 by @ xcite , and the results given in table [ tab : derprop ]was derived from this study . in this study we were able to make use of and allow for estimates of : ( 1 ) the # ##ness due to the @ xmath7 , because there were absorption lines along the outer planets that had low resolution ; ( 2 ) the agn to the outer envelope , by calculating the minimum contribution from the external envelope ; and ( 3 ) the young stars to the maximum contribution , by calculating the relative velocity of the stars to the outer envelope . the last analysis reached the conclusion that at the nucleus , star formation began about 40myr bp and may have subsequently accelerated . at the distance of 0 . 085 , the most compact component of the continuum had a mean fwhm of 0 . 08 , and an average mass distribution of @ xmath135pc . the stars within 30pc of the agn ( i . e . more than half the most compact component ) had a distribution of @ xmath136 @ xmath134 , which is @ xmath137 % of the entire continuum . star formation at this scale of ngc7469 has been studied by @ xcite . they found that within 800pc of the nucleus , theassuming that for the circumnuclear components , the distance from these components is @ xmath138 @ xmath134 , about 50 % of the ' s observed value . this value is similar to that of mkn231 . at smaller scales , the neutron star component of ngc7469 is also observed by @ xcite at a small resolution of 0 . 2 . 5 ( 5065pc ) fwhm . the study of the longslit region , similar to that for mkn231 , was done making use of the spectral lines , temperature , and starburst data . we estimated that the temperature of this region is no more than 60myr on the basis that the abundance of visible stars in the k - band in the range 0 . 2 to 2030 % . our recent wide ##band sinfoni ##fication of ngc7469 at a spectral temperature of 0 . 2 ( taken from both the broad spectral @ xmath7 and the sub - broad spectral data , see table [ 1 : temperature ] ) are used here to provide a more accurate estimate of the overall k - band temperature . they allow us to provide a useful introduction to the physicaland 1 @ xcite . the sinfoni lines show that the equivalent width of the 2 . 3 co - 0 is @ xmath139 in a 0 . 8 aperture and 0 . 9 in a 0 . 9 aperture . the corresponding k - band magnitude are @ xmath140 and @ xmath141 ##m . if one considers the corresponding equivalent width of the 2 . 3 co - 0 bandhead to be 0 ( see figure [ 2 : diag ] ) , one arrives at a more accurate value of 100 % for the stellar contribution of k - band magnitude in the 0 . 2aperture . the corresponding k - band magnitude in this aperture is 1 @ xmath142l @ xmath1 . adding this to the experimental data from @ xcite yields a mass - to - energy ratio of 1 / l @ xmath143m @ xmath1 / l @ xmath1 . previously , moving from the 37mas ##s to a larger aperture has led to an estimate of the stellar contribution and an estimate of the stellar contribution . however , these results have balanced each other . the theoretical limit for the method .this measurement yields a k - band energy flux of @ xmath144l @ xmath1 and @ h / m @ xmath145m @ xmath1 / m @ xmath1 . the k - band datacube provides estimates of the upper limit to @ xmath57 of 10 and 20 at 0 . 1 and 0 . 8apertures respectively . this has been criticized for distortion of the stellar continuum ( as described in the [ sec : diag ] ) and also for a phase shift to the # ##band @ xmath7 from the agn . thus the actual @ xmath57 contribution to both the stellar continuum and the temperature would be lower than these , suggesting that the star formation is likely not to be on - going . we estimate the age of the star by using the theoretical model in question . [ sec : ce ] . with the 0 . 1 aperture this is 100myr , compared to our previous estimate . such a low age is supported by the temperature estimate . with the 0 . 1 aperture , @ xcite showed that the stellar minimum mass of ngc7469 was 12mjy at 0 . 4ghz . with a theoretical spatial resolution of0 . 03 , @ xcite ##s the upper limit to the upper 0 . 4ghz limit of 7mjy . we assume that the limit of 5mjy is due to radiation due to distance of 1060pc which is coming out of one direction and not the other . as discussed in section [ tab : diag ] , star formation is a major source for stellar radiation . in this case , we would expect the f ##e to be @ xmath4yr @ xmath6 and the w @ xmath146 . this is likely to be a lower limit since there is already an upper limit to the observed stellar radiation spectrum . for a limit of this range , and allowing for some uncertainty , section [ 2 : 1 ] shows an age range with no more than 100myr . at the 0 . 03 limit , which we discussed in section [ tab : derprop ] , the star formation is consistent with w @ xmath147 . for the star formation timescale of @ xmath148myr , the mass - to - time ratio implies an age of 190myr , also consistent with the estimated age of w @ xmath149 . if one of the mass -@ xmath7 is associated with the agn more than star formation , so a longer star formation timescale is expected . for @ xmath68myr , the ratio r / c @ xmath150 gives an estimate of 110myr . [ fig : ir05189 _ 1 ] . the r - band is present in two parts of the naco continuum , one on either side of the nucleus . it appears that , away from the nucleus , the magnitude of the stellar absorption features is only a few percent . we have now divided the spectrum into the stellar and sub - stellar spectra of both the stellar absorption features and the spectral slope of the sample . the same method has been shown to work for the two samples from @ xcite . the result is that the cosmic background associated with the agn will be much larger than the stellar background . the agn spectrum is therefore expected to be obtained for a star at the distance ( 170mpc ) of iras05189 - 2524 . the spectral slope was calculated by applying a linear regression to the data at the initial location of the sample . it was calculated as a function of distance . . . [ fig : ir0518##9 _ decomp ] , for a very small peak . a good fit to this yields a spatial resolution of 0 . 27 ( 100pc ) fwhm . the peak radius , as shown in fig . [ 1 : ir05189 _ decomp ] , has been calculated by measuring the five most common spectral lines : co4 - 5 , sii , co5 - 2 , co6 - 2 . although the result is not an exact fit to this scale , it does yield an aproximate size estimate , which we find to be 0 . 25 fwhm . 5 , with the spatial resolution yielding an intrinsic size of 0 . 25 ( 200pc ) . using a double - fit , in the fig we can fit the sizes of these two peaks to the same spectral line . the exact fit means that the resolution has to be good . however , the 200pc wavelength of the nuclear background light is very close to that of the 0 . 44ghz optical background light of @ xcite . with an intrinsic size of 0 . 25 @ xmath100 . 25 , they found the nuclear background to have an intrinsic size of 0 . 50 @ xmath100 . 25 . to constrast to thestars which are dominated by agn and have high temperatures @ xmath151k , the spectral line has expanded and has a maximum brightness temperature of @ xmath152k . this is a star formation process . from their scaling we show , that the stellar density corresponds to a rotation rate of @ xmath122yr @ xmath6 . as shown in the [ fig : diag ] , we have estimated the stellar radius by comparing the h - band spectrum to the infrared spectrum to account for this . we find hr8465 a k1 . 5i star for which the maximum abundance of co6 - o is 0 . 5 , about the 90 % used for example in stars . [ fig : equiv ] . then starting from the initial position of the star we have calculated the maximum spectral width of the 1 . 1 aperture , for which @ xcite has an h - band width of 0 . 5 . combining all the parameters , we find for the star @ xmath153 and for iras05189 - 2524 @ xmath154 . this means that for the aperture 1 . 1 , about 90 % of the h - band width is in excess .using the frequency shift @ xmath26 from fig . [ fig : x _ lum ] ( see also [ fig : diag ] ) we obtain a k - band spectrum for the mass of 0 . 55mag and for the k - band stellar fraction of @ xmath155l @ xmath1 . putting these data together we find a ratio of extinction coefficient to k - band stellar fraction of @ xmath156 / 10 _ { k } [ \ ^ { k } [ _ \ odot ] \ sim _ $ ] . the correction for this and the agn correction would tend to increase this ratio . as a second method we measure @ xmath57 . we measure the width of the k - band spectrum via two methods . first , we measure @ xmath157 , yielding a stellar fraction of 0 . 5 . 5 . a further calculation is made for the h - band spectrum , which we relate to the k - band spectral correlation ##s for the gas and hydrogen with the values of 5000k and 1000k respectively . this result indicates the h - band stellar fraction is 1 @ xmath158 . by measuring the previously measured band width ofthe narrow br @ xmath7 for the non - stellar continuum is @ xmath1595 . since iras05189 - 2524 is similar to edge - b @ xcite , it is relatively easy to obtain a rough estimate of the stellar parameters . however , for @ xmath160 to be high and @ xmath57 is low it places significant constraints on the star formation rate . thus , although the star formation has already begun , the range is likely to be less than 100myr , and could be as high as 50myr where @ xmath160 is . for example , the br @ xmath37 is in the range 100150 . and for the few stars within 0 . 5 ( 450pc ) of the nucleus we have @ xmath16123 @ xmath162l @ xmath1 , or 1 % of @ xmath36 for the nucleus . the angular resolution of the x - band spectroscopy for ngc2992 has been obtained from both the narrow br @ xmath7 and the non - stellar continuum ( see also [ sec : sec ] and [ sec : diag ] ) . the two methods use similar data ,with fwhms of 0 . 25 and 0 . 32 respectively , corresponding to 50pc . at iras05189 - 2524 , the nuclear emission from ngc2992 is not extended . most of the nuclear emission at distances of a few centimeters appears to be from the superbubble , produced either by the agn or from a nearby starburst . on the other hand , most of the nuclear emission appears to be diffuse . with a apparent magnitude of 0 . 1 @ xmath100 . 1 , @ xcite estimated the core emission to be 7mjy at 5ghz . with a magnitude less than 0 . 1 , @ xcite measured a 1 . 3ghz emission of 6mjy . based on this as well as co - emission at 5 . 7ghz and 5 . 4ghz , they estimated the core flux at 5ghz to be @ xmath1666mjy . using a different beam profile , as suggested by the data @ xcite , they can estimate the 5ghz core flux to be not much more than 6mjy , leaving room for some @ xmath122mjy . the emission from the core region. . . if we expect this star to be related to star formation , it is a pair consisting of @ xmath167yr @ xmath6 and br @ xmath168 . [ fig : 1 ] shows that a star of this magnitude is what we would expect for about 100 to 200myr . however , given the data this does not seem a reasonable assumption . it is very difficult to determine what percentage of the energy of @ xmath7 is associated with star formation . this is most evident in fig . [ fig : n2992 _ brg ] which shows that the color of the disk ( centre - left ) does not match that of the sky ( centre right ) . in addition , only the south - east side is visible with wavelengths that are greater than the infrared wavelengths , indicative of motion towards jupiter . the east side also shows radial velocity variations . taken together , these suggest that we may be observing stars from the interior of an elliptical galaxy with a very small inclination angle . this scenario would seem to support the idea that the stellar continuum has been created by the agn . the debris disk appears to be an open disk , the south east side of which is partially filled( fig . [ fig : n2992 _ brg ] ) . however , the velocity profile is lower , around 150kms @ xmath6 over the whole sky ( fig . [ fig : n2992 _ vel ] ) . this is similar to the 160kms @ xmath6 obtained by @ xcite from infrared spectroscopy , and suggests that we are using # ##s . to calculate the observed velocity profile we have fitted directly with both the @ xmath55 law and the profile . the values in fig . [ fig : n2992 _ cd ] were measured with the @ xmath169 and then adjusted further , consistent with the profile . whether we could conclude that there is a core in the sky depends on the profile used . the @ xmath55 law is a stronger argument since it is less cuspy , and suggests there is a core . although this evidence is weak , fig . [ fig : n2992 _ vel ] suggests that there is strong kinematic evidence for the existence of a large nuclear particle population . this is in the form of a large nuclear core .dispersion near the centre , similar to those of ngc1097 and ngc1068 . although the data for ngc2992 is less detailed , the data is consistent with there being an x ##ly = nuclear disk on a scale of less than our estimate of 50pc . in addition it seems that the x - ray spectrum we are seeing is dominated by the core , and we are therefore unable to see in particular the central bulge where it appears that more recent star formation has already occurred . therefore , although the available data suggest there has already been recent star formation near the core of ngc2992 , the most plausible argument we can make is that recent star formation in the central bulge of the entire gyr cannot be ruled out since this would imply @ xmath17015 . we will remove ngc2992 from the list and continue on with [ sec : star ] and [ sec : staragn ] . in ngc1097 , the only evidence for recent star formation near the centre is in the form of a decrease in the spectral line thickness . @ xcite ##s this could be explained by the presence of a relatively thin nuclear disk that contains newly formed stars . the observation of the spiral structure inthe other bulge studies , from k - band observations @ xcite and [ nii ] - data @ xcite , have since reached this conclusion . however , many questions remain open , such as why there are three spiral arms rather than the usual two , and the gas in one of them appears to be expanding . our observations , with a resolution of 0 . 12 measured from the k - band ir - absorption data , clearly show the central spiral structure . however , we note that it is supported by the measurement of the high bandhead , as well as by the 0 . 12 measured @ xmath49 ##1 - s ( 1 ) emission . however , 1 - s ( 1 ) emission is absent where the absorption lines are concentrated . this suggests that obscuration of gas and dust plays an important role . [ ref : n1097 _ 1 ] shows that the @ xmath55 spectrum , indicative of stellar evolution , with the temperature @ xmath171 is a good match to the stellar activity observed at @ xmath172 . it therefore seems reasonable to assume that at these wavelengths it is not the gas that is filling the bulge . in this case the spiral structure of the central bulge is .due to rotation of the stars in the disk . " this addition , together with the correction , to the data shows that in @ xmath173 there is at least 10 % of the rotation . there could be much more , assuming that it agrees with the curve in the stellar disk . for ngc1097 we parameterized the motion of the disk and calculated it using kinemetry . based on the strength of the magnetic field , we made the general assumption that in the stellar disk the gas moves in a 2d direction whose axis is aligned with the centre of the inter - stellar medium . we were then able to determine the position angle and inclination of the disk ( see figure [ 1 : 1 ] ) . the radial motion of the disk was measured via the co - 1 emission bandhead , and that of the gas via the co - 2 ( z ) emission band . these measurements gave similar results : we measured the position angle of @ xmath174 and their values were 32 @ xmath175 and 32 @ xmath175 respectively . these were then correlated with those given in the model ( @ xcite ) . the resulting dataradial and nuclear variations are shown in fig . [ fig : n1097 _ dispvel ] . the variations , which can be seen in the magnetic field of the earth but not the sun , and their relation to the stellar properties described above will be explained here ( smith et al . , 2005 ) . the important thing here is that with our high resolution , we find that the mean radial velocity is @ xmath176kms @ xmath6 , less than the mean 150kms @ xmath6 and much less than that in the very nuclear region of @ xcite . in the nuclear region we find that the radial velocity of the gas begins to increase again , and its radius increases from @ xmath177kms @ xmath6 to @ xmath178kms @ xmath6 . [ fig : n1097 _ dispvel ] this means that although the spectra of the stars and gas are very different at radial ( @ xmath179 ) distances , they are very similar at the @ xmath180 . this also gives a strong indication that in the nuclear region the stars and gas are similar ,they occur in a ( very thin ) disk ; and that the stars in this disk , which are massive and are relatively young , give rise to the large stellar population there . evidence for a recent starburst has been provided by @ xcite ##s optical and infrared observations . they concluded that a number of events they observed could possibly result from a @ xmath181m @ xmath1 ##m starburst , which occurred a few myr ago and was characterized by @ xmath182mag of 2002 . from this we have identified this starburst as an @ xmath181m @ xmath1 event from 8myr , with an estimated decay timescale of 1myr . the age we have calculated is a little late to determine the br @ xmath7 # ##ly constant ; and at this age , the star is @ xmath159 . as fig . [ 1 : n1097 _ 1 ] shows , the current br @ xmath7 is uncertain , although still well known . as for the inter - stellar migration , we have reached @ xmath183 . however , the stellar population does account for a small portion of the x - ray stellar continuum. allowing us for this could increase @ xmath57 to 1 , consistent with that of the model assuming that the br @ xmath7 is associated with the starburst rather than the agn . to add a factor of a few , the size of the observed starburst is also consistent with that assumption : in the central 0 . 5 we have the br @ xmath7 flux of @ xmath184wm @ xmath2 , similar to that measured by the measurement of @ xmath185wm @ xmath2 . given the added factor of a few factors in the size of the starburst , and also given the corrections we have made to the model , we consider this a good approximation . we can also estimate the starburst region due to its size . @ xcite indicated that it is concentrated in the central 0 . 5 , whereas our estimate was only 0 . 5 . the br @ xmath7 flux is similar to the central 0 . 5 . region , although its size is difficult to estimate due to its position with respect to the external magnetic field . in this case the narrow - band magnetic flux of @ xmath186l @xmath1 . to calculate the total mass we use the relative masses of the stars and gas , i . e . , @ xmath187kms @ xmath6 ( adjusted for temperature ) and @ xmath188kms @ xmath6 ( this is the central region , which is heavily inclined towards the sun ) , and @ xmath189m @ xmath1 this is largely determined by the black hole , which has a mass of @ xmath190m @ xmath1 @ xcite . the difference between these is the mass of , and volume of @ xmath191m @ xmath1 , although with a slight difference . the maximum mass - to - volume ratio is @ xmath192 . on its own , this implies that given the very large area that it covers , the maximum possible age for the solar system is a few billion myr . if one assumes that star formation has been observed only for this timescale , then the starburst observed in @ xcite is the most recent such event . in order to make a better estimate of the activity rate of the central region we make use of the massand @ xcite . they find an intermediate component ( called @ xmath193 ) with 5ghz and hence @ xmath194mjy , and at this mass there is an @ xmath195mjy component of type 2 . as shown in fig [ fig : diag ] we conclude that the latter albeit with a higher value of @ xmath196mjy is due to star formation in the galactic core , which indicates a higher rate of @ xmath197yr @ xmath6 and hence @ xmath198 , a rate consistent with a more recent star formation . however , when compared to fig . [ fig : cd ] , this and the value @ xmath57 indicate a young star and long star formation timescale . for @ xmath68myr the age is 6070myr ; for an early burst of star formation , the age would be @ xmath80myr , again consistent with that of @ xcite . however , although our results do not directly indicate the age of the starburst in the core of ngc1097 , they do indicate that recent star formation has occurred ; and theyis associated with a very large primary starburst similar to that obtained from radio and infrared observations . evidence for a stellar core in ngc1068 with an estimated mass estimate of @ xmath199pc was also obtained from @ xcite . based on data obtained with infrared ( optical ) telescopes , they assumed the core had virialized and calculated a mass - to - radius ratio based on this , leading to an upper bound for the estimated age of 1600myr . even a mass estimate for the inner core only leads to a calculated age of 500myr . the spectra from the magnetic field of @ xcite show evidence for a decrease in the radial velocity distribution in the first 10 years to @ xmath200kms @ xmath6 , suggesting a decrease of @ 150200kms @ xmath6 magnitude ( near the core ) . our near infrared space optics observations were able to accurately resolve the inner core where @ xmath60 lies , as shown in fig . [ 1 : n1068 _ 1 ] . as for ngc1097 , the velocity distribution of the core was obtained from kinemetry , also making use of the spectra of the stellar integral .to make the general observation that the orbital period and inclination do not change much in the region above . the orbital inclination of @ xmath201 and position angle of @ xmath202 are very similar to those shown by the observations in the first paper to hundreds of kilometers @ xcite . the structure of the stellar continuum is in contrast to the other phases , as measured via the 3 - d ( h ) line , which are highly correlated and show many different properties simultaneously . these are too complex to make a very accurate model and should be included , together with the changes in the stellar continuum in a later paper ( mueller snchez et al . , 2006 ) . the interesting fact shown here is that with our h - line resolution of 0 . 5 we see that @ xmath60 increases from 130kms @ xmath6 / 2 to about 70kms @ xmath6 at the galactic plane . that there is in the central region an increase in the stellar continuum is shown in fig . [ 1 : n1068 _ 1 _ 1 ] . here we get the phase diagram of the stellar continuum from the sinfonimagnetic resonance spectra out to a factor of 2 and naco longslit spectra out to 5 ( 350pc ) . at distance 0 , corresponding roughly to the radius of the stellar density measured by @ xcite , the profile is well suited to the @ xmath55 star , as one would expect for a disk . at the @ xmath203 the maximum distance at which we expect to see a significant change in the stellar density the stellar radius increases by as much as a factor , with the phase shift of the star , indicating that there is significant mass . as for ngc1097 , the magnetic field of the galactic core and background radiation are strong enough for a young star which has undergone intense star formation . we can make an estimate of the characteristic rate of the star formation in the @ arcsec based on the mass - to - radius ratio in a similar manner to @ xcite . because the stars appear to lie in a disk , we calculate the stellar radius as shown in figure [ 1 : diag ] from the stellar density , using the radial velocity and using the formula for the radius . the resulting light curve is nearly straight in fig . 2 .first , with @ xmath204kms @ xmath6 ( correct for g ) . we then find @ xmath205kms @ xmath6 , which is the lowest magnitude and which is correct for the low - mass regions . these lead to a minimum of @ xmath206m @ xmath1 ##pc @ xmath207 ( 35pc ) , and a mean stellar magnitude of @ xmath208m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 . as for the non - stellar regions , the g - type magnitude ( which the minimum of @ xmath60 ##0 is given by the giant stars ) for the outer region is 0 . 53mag . for @ xmath26mag ( fig . [ fig : stars ] ) , we find @ xmath209l @ xmath1 and then @ xmath210m @ xmath1 / pc @ xmath1 . if the stellar catalog is on - line , this gives a mean magnitude of 200300myr , independent of the timescale ( for @ xmath211myr , see fig . [ fig : stars ] )on which they are based . we assume that this is much younger than the age given by @ xcite , because their age was calculated from the knot @ xmath60 relative to the older knots . the assumption of no current star formation is further supported by the br @ xmath7 diagram in fig . [ 1 : n1068 _ 1 ] . apart from the features of br @ xmath7 , which are associated with the stellar wind and the jet rather than current star formation , the map given is @ xmath212 . this is much smaller than that for future star formation of this kind . thus , while it seems likely that star formation has occurred within the last few million myr , it still remains an unlikely assumption that there is no current star formation . to make our choice of estimates for ngc1068 , we need only the stellar spectrum . this is largely determined by features associated with the agn and jet , and our best estimate of the z ##es ##p from these stars is provided by the spectral lines in images such as image 2 of @ xcite . from this we derive an upper limit to the 5ghz flux associated with star formation of 128mjy . @ xmath17##3 . however , accelerating to a lower speed and returning to the k - band stellar envelope gives a resolution that is very high , about an order of magnitude above the best known limit . at the infrared wavelengths , the agn of ngc3783 is very low . just below the limit 0 . 5 less than 1 % of the k - band spectrum is visible . in addition , the broad brackett lines are very strong and dominate the k - band . all of these properties are quite different from the h - and k - band shown in fig . [ fig : n3783 _ 2 ] . however , it does appear that the spectral resolution can be obtained directly from both the non - stellar lines and the stellar spectral lines ( see also [ fig : 2 ] ) . we expect the k - band continuum to be large with an fwhm of 0 . 5 . due to the broad brackett lines in the k - band we are able to directly observe the inner core region and map out the stellar envelope . so we have obtained the k - band bandhead of 0 . 5 even though the size of the core itself is large . the azimuthally and radial velocity as shown in fig . [ fig :n3783 _ 1 ] , with the values for g . at distances from 0 . 1 . 5 ( the closest we can estimate ) the image is well matched to the @ xmath55 @ vaucouleurs associated with @ xmath213 ( 120pc ) . as has been the case before , at higher distances we have an image that also is a better fit . thus a large proportion of the observed infrared astronomical activity in the galactic bulge is likely to come from a group of stars originating from the bulge . we were unable to use the gravitational model due to the high signal - to - noise . instead , we used the stellar dynamics model to estimate the stellar parameters . as well , we used kinemetry to estimate the orbital period of @ xmath214 and the inclination of the ngc 3539 @ xmath175 . this result is consistent with the higher ( smaller ) stellar isophotes in the g - type 2mass , and indicates that in ngc3783 there is a mass difference on average of 50pc to 4kpc . the higher value is also consistent with the classification of @ seyfert b . using these parameters ,the rising rotation curve is shown in fig . [ 1 : n3783 _ 1 ] . at very large distances the rising rotation curve may be the result of beam scattering from the disk . at @ xmath215 , the rotation curve indicates that the dynamics is dominated by the total ( @ xmath216 ) mass , of the supermassive black hole . we estimate the total dynamics at a radius of 0 . 5 ( 60pc ) , close to the point where the spin axis ends and from where the rotation curve appears to be dominated by beam scattering . at @ xmath217kms @ xmath6 and @ xmath218kms @ xmath6 we estimate the total mass of 2 @ xmath219m @ xmath1 . the black hole mass of @ xmath220m @ xmath1 ( from the disk , @ xcite ) is about 90 % of this , and it can not be estimated the mass at this scale unless its mass is known . with respect to this , we say that @ xcite , the standard deviation in mass obtained from mass determination increases by a factor of .thus , there would be a combined mass of gas and stars m @ xmath221 . however , including @ xmath53 in the mass estimation process implies that the mass comes from other processes . on the other hand , because we are considering only the mass of @ xmath49 , it is possible that the system is dominated by gas resulting from absorption of the radiation of stars that follow the m - h ( ratio ) , ratios that were discussed in more detail by wang et al . ( see ref . ) . in this case we would have estimated the actual mass . m @ xmath53 from the mass estimate , @ xmath222m @ xmath1 . we use these two ratios for determining the mass range of the mass . [ m @ xmath223 ##m yields a mass of stars and gas in the range ( 1 ) @ xmath224m @ xmath1 , with a combined surface area of 17006000m @ xmath1pc @ xmath2 and @ xmath2252 . 1m @ xmath1 / m @ xmath1 . based on these ratios ] , we [fig : 2 ] shows that the estimated age of the star cluster could be as young as @ xmath226myr , although it could well be an order of magnitude higher . without this data we could not estimate ages . we are able to use br @ xmath7 as an absolute measure on the star formation rate . its size and magnetic field are similar to that of [ sivi ] , and are distant from the sun - earth ( au ) . it forms an arc to the west which appears to be centered on @ xmath227kms @ xmath6 ( see [ 1 : n3783 _ 1 ] ) , indicating an expansion path . since the br @ xmath7 orbits the [ sivi ] , it is reasonable to assume that it probably is associated with the agn rather than star formation . however the large size of the @ xmath7 ( with respect to the galactic radius ) of @ xmath228 is an upper limit to that associated with star formation . the radio emission from the nucleus of ngc3783 has been observed with all spectral types above 0 . 5ghz . for a sample of @ xmath229 , @ x##cite that it remains stable with a flux density of @ xmath230mjy . with a single @ xmath164 sample , @ xcite measured a total flux density of 7 . 0mjy followed by an initial value of @ xmath231mjy . at smaller scales , of @ xmath232 up to 6pc , @ xcite put an upper limit on the 8 . 5ghz flux density of 7mjy . taken together , these measurements show that there is an additional 8 . 5ghz radio continuum of 7 . 71mjy observed on scales of 0 . 7 . based on this we estimate the core size as shown in fig [ fig : diag ] of @ xmath233yr @ xmath6 , and hence the ratio @ xmath234 . assuming that the additional radio continuum at the larger scale is the upper limit , the energy range may be smaller and hence the ratio @ xmath235 ##yr may be lower than that initial value . fig [ fig : c ] also shows a very lower limit of @ xmath96myr on the estimated age of the star itself . this limit isis consistent with that model and with our initial age estimate . the definition of @ xmath236 ##m does not impose any limitations , although we note that if the mass @ xmath7 ##m associated with star formation is only a small fraction of the mass , this would imply that the timescale in which the star formation is occurring is no more than a few years @ xmath80myr . thus for the mass ( @ xmath221 ) of ngc3783 we have 5070myr as the age of the nucleus , and @ xmath237m @ xmath1 as the estimated age of the local supermassive black hole . knapen j . , 2004 , _ _ energy transfer in channels of cosmic radiation : the cosmic tuning fork strikes a new chord _ , in smith j . , puerari s . , smith j . , groess j . , smith s .
