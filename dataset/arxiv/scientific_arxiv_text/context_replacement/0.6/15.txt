the study of galaxies ( sne ) has greatly expanded in the last 20 years . large and very precise surveys of individual galaxies ( e . g . , schmidt et al . 1996 ; treffers et al . 1997 ; filippenko et al . 2001 ; dimai 2001 ; qiu & hu 2001 ) , wide - field , very precise surveys ( e . g . , reiss et al . 1998 ; cohen - cohen & maoz 1999 , 2002 ; hardin et al . 2000 ; schaefer 2000 ) , and ground - based , automated , high - resolution galaxy search programs ( perlmutter et al . 1997 ; berg et al . 1998 ) all aim to produce hundreds of new new discoveries each year . other projects that are currently ongoing and underway [ e . g . , the mobile galaxy survey aldering et al . 2001 ; the stability / evolution program ( sam ) perlmutter et al . 2000 ; and galaxy searches using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @ vanden ##berg et al . 2001 ; miknaitis et al . 2001b ; see also @ xmath9 ] to increase these numbers by at least an order of magnitude . snevery rare stars , and divided into several subtypes , with the primary classification being based on their brightness . however , sne of type ii show emission lines in their spectra while sne of type ia do not . each of these types is further divided into subtypes , the most common types being ia , ib , and ic , as well as ii - m , ii - n , iin , and iib . see filippenko ( 1997 ) for a detailed description and @ xmath10 for more details . it is generally accepted that sne ia is formed from the gravitational collapse of a white dwarf at or near the chandrasekhar line , while the other types of sne ( ib , ic , and ic ) result from the gravitational collapse of other stars . while the sne , their spectra , and their fundamental physics are of great interest , sne are also useful tools in the study of many other stellar phenomena . sne ia is useful for measurements , and their hr diagram has been used to determine the # ##ization of the hr diagram ( e . g . , parodi et al . 2000 , and references below ) . the sensitivity of the hr diagram to the local##hifts ( @ xmath11 ) describes the gravitational and matter - dominated structure of the universe ( e . g . , goobar & perlmutter 1995 ) . two other experiments using large numbers of particles - @ xmath12 sne ii made a strong case for a new model of the universe ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; see filippenko 2001 for a comparison ) , one with a nonzero coupling constant , @ xmath13 . another experiment ( riess et al . 2001 ) , using a ii - ia at @ xmath14 , shows the transition from matter - dominated acceleration to @ xmath13 - dominated acceleration at @ xmath15 . sne ii - ia can also be used in gravitational acceleration models for the solar system model ( epm ; kirshner & kwan 1974 ; kwan , kirshner , & schmidt 1992 ; schmidt et al . 1994 ) , which was most recently studied by hamuy et al . ( 2001 ) and leonard et al . ( 2002a , b ) . leonard et al . ( 2002a ; see also hflich et al . 2001 ) showed that thecorrection to @ xmath16 % ( @ xmath17 ) may be achieved for sne ##1 - 3 by simply measuring the observed difference in magnitude , without the need for a new epm , unless a more accurate result is obtained . hamuy & cohen ( 2002 ) use this method , finding that the combination of the observed magnitude and the ejecta return rate , yields a much larger error than the previous values . these rates as a function of distance reflect the star - formation history of the universe , the physical processes leading to sne formation , and the cosmic background ( jorgensen et al . 1997 ; garcia et al . 1998 ; ruiz - lapuente & garcia 1998 ; madau , della valle , & panagia 1998 ; yungelson & livio 2000 ) . these rates are also useful for measuring the chemical composition and energetics of the galactic medium ( e . g . , matteucci & greggio 1986 ) and the intracluster environment ( e . g . , brighenti & mathews 1998 , 2001 ; lowenstein 2000 ; ben - david , maoz , & sharon 2002 ) . once again , the nature of the galactic medium , and its effectsas a tool for each of the purposes above , it almost always focused on data collection and analysis . the information obtained from the data often includes ( but is not limited to ) the spectral type , temperature , and brightness ( relative to the time of occurrence of observed brightness ) . further analysis may not always be possible or desirable . sne , even at high resolution , may be too faint for detection , especially with the faint , sub - g - type stars already known . it is also not known if large numbers ( tens of thousands ) of sne are discovered in a very short time , as is expected to happen in the case of the sdss star cluster ( miknaitis et al . 2001b ; see also @ xmath18 ) . however , detection is possible for sne stars in archival data ( gal - gal & maoz 2000 ; riess et al . 2001 ; gal - gal et al . 2002 ) , which had already disappeared by the time they were discovered . the detection of sne in archival data is expected to become possible as high - resolution astronomical instruments become faster and more sophisticated , especially with the development of software such as astrovirtel ( http : / / www .stecf . org / astrovirtel ) and the galaxy and universe ( brunner , djorgovski , & szalay 2001 ) . the aim of the latter approach is to enable the practical detection of sne for which no other methods exist . the best method for this is multi - spectral optical spectroscopy . the practical utility of such an approach is demonstrated , in part , by the use of the ` ` high resolution ' ' technique to determine the number and type of galaxies and galaxies that are too faint or too distant to observe spectroscopically ( e . g . , weymann et al . 1999 ; sullivan et al . 2001 ) . using a similar approach to sne is not possible since , unlike light , the properties of sne vary greatly with temperature , distance , and distance . although various approaches to the detection of the sne have been proposed before ( dahln & fransson 1999 ; smith et al . 2000 ; riess et al . 2001 ) , no satisfactory solution has been given so far . in a seminal paper , dahln & goobar ( 2002 , in dg2002 ) addressed the problem of infrared spectroscopy for the study ofand , cluster - based , high - @ xmath12 cluster ##ing . their work relies heavily on the same detection techniques used by these groups i . e . , the combination of data from @ xmath194 years ago , and to detect sne before , and after , peak brightness . as these results show , this effort is not oriented toward the detection of sne itself . the main goal of dg2002 is the analysis of the high - @ xmath12 sne data from each individual cluster , the discovery of the individual clusters and the sne themselves . for the particular observation methods they use , dg2002 also tries to determine the association of the galaxies with non - ia sne . to do this , they use the work of dahln & fransson ( 1999 ) and improve their ability to detect the non - ia sne based on their abundance and peak brightness . however , the models used for the detection of non - ia sne are based on various properties and properties , such as the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum , peak brightness , light intensity , and the abundance of non - ia sne , that are not well known anywhere in the early universe , let alone the non -. as dg2002 uses methods to identify non - @ xmath12 sne types , not a single single method , we find several methods that apply to all the known galaxy subtypes and can be used for a wide range of galaxy types , including those that are similar to those used by dg2002 . identification of sne by broadband colors is such a complex problem that , as we see here , a simple method ( i . e . , determining the type , size , and age from a few broadband colors ) is almost impossible . but we can see here that the problem can be solved . type , size , and age may not all be known yet . many sne are associated with other galaxies that are already known . one can also determine the age of the source from that of the source , usually either from measurements ( that can be obtained only after the source has cooled ) or from a measured distance . in fact , for sne that are found in well - known regions of the galaxy , the source most often already exists . yong - ho et al . ( 2002 ) first demonstrated this with sne they discovered using space _ .space telescope ( hst ) _ list of well - known open - cluster clusters . five of the eight galaxy sne they observe ( and two of those not associated with the cluster ) have # ##s in the spectrum . for the purpose of sne , the type can only be determined from observations of the host , and not of a single galaxy . in the case of a galaxy , the galaxy type can only be determined by measuring the overall light curve of the source . thus , the source may not be a problem for new or very old galaxies , and is generally not necessary for determining sne ( see riess et al . 2001 for an example ) . however , for many of the practical applications of sne ( e . g . , the determination of type ia ) , the type of the galaxy is known . knowledge of the type of the galaxy is required for many of the applications described above . the galaxy type can be directly determined only from observations of the observed galaxy itself . while some information can be obtained from the source ( e . g . , some galaxies are known to have a sne type ) , this information is limited and this information does not count for high .. we now focus our efforts on using multi - spectral mass data to determine sne . since we want to determine the spectrum of a star with an unknown ( but known ) type , it is not possible to use pure colors ; multi - spectra for sne of all types , and of all wavelengths , are readily available . instead , we have created a large statistical sample of known , well - known sne . these data are used to generate the spectral colors for various star types using a linear filter , at any given time . the linear nature of our data allows us to create data for phase diagrams which show the evolutionary evolution of each sn type . from the observed data , we can then search for stars which are either populated by a particular type of sn , or that are populated by many other types . the observed photometric properties of a particular star with a known type can then be compared against the observed data , and estimates of the type and age can be applied . as we show in @ xmath20 , the type of the star can still be easily determined . when this is not the case , the type can only be determined by combining the color information with other spectral informationand the source , such as depending on its temperature , and even ( even if very small ) on its activity ( e . g . , whether its temperature is rising or falling ) . our standard classification method is based on properties , determined by the surface energy density ( sed ) of the source . by definition , such a method can distinguish only between two subtypes with similar spectral properties . thus , a sne with very different spectral properties ( e . g . , light curve , emission spectra ) , but with similar seds at different wavelengths , would not be distinguished by our method . the standard classification method we use tends , therefore , to rely mainly on spectral properties . however , the standard classification of sne ( see filippenko 1997 for a comparison ) is mainly based on their colors , with one notable exception which we see here . it is possible to divide the electromagnetic spectrum into two main types : type ii sne , which have strong emission lines in their spectra , and type i sne , which do not ( fowler 1941 ) . type i sne are further divided into type ii whose spectra are characterized by a strong blue and ii @ xmath21 , similar to blueshifted . ##i @xmath226347 , 6371 ##d , type ib that show only si ##i lines , and type ib that show only si ii and si iii ( e . g . , matheson et al . 2001 , and see below ) . type ii sne are divided ( e . g . , barbon , ciatti , & rosino 1979 ; doggett & brown 1985 ) into two groups according to their light - curve characteristics : sne ii - p show a sharp peak during the h @ xmath23 phase of their spectrum , and sne ii - l appears in a linear pattern with a phase vs . phase pattern , similar to sne ii . other studies ( e . g . , filippenko 1997 ) show that sne ii - l show similar spectra , with the h @ xmath24 phase having a p - cygni spectrum . on the other hand , sne ii - l has not been well characterized spectroscopically , and the two spectroscopically characterized lines ( sne 1979c and 1980k ) are thought to be very rare ( ` ` overluminous ' ' ; brown & brown 1990 ) compared to normal sne ii - l . during theconsequently , the focus of study of sne ii shifted from observation to spectroscopy . two new subtypes have emerged . sne iin is characteristic " @ xmath24 " ( e . g . , schlegel 1990 ; filippenko 1997 , and references here ) , and sne iib are new forms that first appear as a young sne ii , then mature to mature sne ib ( filippenko 1988 ; filippenko , matheson , & smith 1993 ; matheson et al . 2001 , and references here ) . for our purposes , only three subtypes with well - defined spectral profiles are considered . we therefore consider not only sne ii - p , iin , and iib as subtypes of the type ii population . sne iin and iib represent only a small fraction of the total population that was previously classified as type ii - p based solely on their light - curve properties ( about half of the type ii population , e . g . , cappellaro et al . using the best available data available to us , we conclude that most of the sne ii ##s in our study belong to the spectroscopically similar subtypes ii -ii , iin , and iib ( see below ) . sne is a complex continuum , with many rare and sometimes unusual types , from rare hypernovae ( e . g . , s 1998bw galama et al . 1998 ; patat et al . 2001 ; s 1997cy ##u et al . 2000 ; turatto et al . 2000 ; s 1997ef iwamoto et al . 2000 ; matheson et al . 2001 ) to rare type 1987a - b stars ( e . g . , arnett et al . 1989 , and references here ) , and to ` ` rare ' ' ( e . g . , filippenko et al . 1995a ; van dyk et al . 2000 , and references here ) . therefore , we restrict our study to those events that are not so rare , and are well - known and well - studied spectroscopically . assuming that the sne types in the iau catalog are those of the same type that were observed by amateur astronomers , we conclude that , overall , the best - characterized subtypes we have ( ib , ib , ib , ii - ib , iin , and iib ) are :about 10 % , and possibly more , of the total population . for this , we need only the sne that were discovered during the year 2000 and whose existence was not confirmed by iau reports , or which could be confirmed by data available to us . among the discovered events , there were 13 type ia , 8 type ib , 4 type ic , 3 type iin , 6 type iib , one peculiar sne ii , one peculiar type ib , and 5 events which were classified collectively as ` ` type ia . ' ' from the observations and data contained in the iau reports , we know that of the discovered 110 events , 10 have a pre - cygni type , the @ xmath24 , type of sne ii - p , 7 events may or may not belong to the ii - p , iin , or iib subtypes , and 7 events are clearly not ii - p , iin , or iib types . while 86 events ( 86 % ) belong to our spectroscopically confirmed four types ( type ia , ib , ic , ii - p , iin , and iib ) , 8 events ( 5 % ) may or may not be of these types , and only 6 events ( 5 % )are likely to be of origin and included in our database . it is highly likely that data based on our database will be relevant to the vast number of sne searched by current programs . this is probably also true for future programs that will use other search methods . we are concerned that a large number of relatively stable sne ( e . g . , ngc 1987a - b ) may be underrepresented in the existing databases . analysis of future data that may be relevant to such data may justify their inclusion in the current database . the core of our data system is the spectral database : a database of the spectra of the sne . most of the these spectra were obtained with the shane ##t - 1 telescope at lick observatory . the spectral resolution is less than @ xmath25 ( half length , half width ) , and the majority of the data available covers the range 320010000 . other spectra with higher resolution ( ~ 40008000 ) were also obtained . the spectra were either measured at the parallactic level ( filippenko 1982 ) , or filtered by optical measurements , to ensure that the line changes due to frequency - dependent light intensity were not observed . telluric lines were observed , and in theis the brightness of a single star . according to the radial velocity of the individual stars , the spectra are analyzed for significant differences , using the methods of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) and the light curves of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) . the working group of the project was organized in the following manner . for each of the well - known spectral subtypes listed above , we have selected a sample . the main concern was the presence of spectra with wide temporal variation and multiple sources . in addition , a few sample events of other types were used in order to ensure consistency and fill gaps in the spectral catalogue , when possible . table 1 shows the sne whose spectra comprise our database , with the sample events for each subtype listed above . we have also selected events that are likely to either result from extinction , or to be very rare . for sne stars , these ( overluminous , ngc 1991t - like , and underluminous , ngc 1991bg - like ) events are very well known , and may be very common , at least in low - mass galaxies ( davis et al . our spectral catalogue contains the majority of thesne ia , and we consider the spectrum of the sne observed in @ xmath26 ##2 . the spectra were re - redshifted according to the single - source spectral data from the ned database . after redshifting the spectrum down to a certain frequency ( see below ) , the observed spectra were re - analyzed , producing synthetic spectra . in our ned database , we estimate the synthetic spectrum of sne at a given frequency using the johnson - brett @ xmath4 ( johnson 1965 ; brett 1976 ; see johnson & munari 2000 for details ) , bessell @ xmath27 ( bessell & brett 1988 ) , and sdss @ xmath6 ( fukugita et al . 1996 ; stoughton et al . 2002 ) classification schemes . if a sample of bandpass is not fully covered by the synthetic spectrum , the flux in the missing spectral region is proportional only to the expected amount of the excess . a spectral line that contains such an excess is assigned an error proportional to the amount of flux in the missing region of the excess , thus giving a synthetic spectral profile . the resulting synthetic spectrum is then known as .- spectral analysis . note that in all the diagrams we use , the source and axis are composed of lines consisting of different colors ( e . g . , @ xmath28 vs . @ xmath29 , @ xmath29 vs . @ xmath1 etc . ) . since most of the samples in our study have a wide color range , the lines will therefore usually run only along one axis . in the next section we present these diagrams , describe their use in the analysis of sne spectra of different groups , and provide a few simple examples . note that the quality of diagrams that give the best - quality spectra , apart from the statistical effects on the sample being used , also depends on context . for these diagrams , for any plot ( with a single source and all the samples ) one has to look for multi - source diagrams that have the same spectral properties . the table will allow us to see here only a few simple examples of these diagrams . the tables for different versions of @ xmath12 can be downloaded from our website ( http : / / big - data . uk . ac . uk / $ \ sim $ dovip / tables ) . in section 2 , we present ourcompare early sne ia to the colors of normal sne ia described by leibundgut ( 1988 ) . we can see that our template colors follow the same curve in color space , with a slight deviation ( @ xmath30 mag ) , consistent with the previously mentioned trends in sne ia spectra ( e . g . , tripp 1998 ; phillips et al . 1999 , and references below ) . since our original analysis included that of the 1994d , which is much brighter at several wavelengths than normal sne ia ( phillips et al . 1995 ) , our analysis includes an even wider range of the spectrum of normal sne ia . from this data , we can estimate the maximum size of color - space space for normal sne ia to be @ xmath300 . 5 mag . note that sne ia follows a similar curve in color space , with a small turn - around of @ xmath16 mag at peak brightness . the ia spectral pattern is nontrivial . like normal sne , the spectral pattern of normal sne ia is initially blue , and becomes red as the spectrum gets larger . this change is slow during the first stages of the ia spectrum , but is quickly followed by the appearance ofmost absorption occurs in the upper part of the spectrum ( restframe 40005500 ) . the absorption - type spectrum results in higher values for long - period ( @ xmath31 ##0 ) sne ii ( e . g . , periods 2 , 3 ) . in figure 3 our spectra for sne ii - p are plotted against the total spectrum of the previous , well - known outburst 1999em . it can be clearly seen that the results show , up to about 90 % at maximum brightness , where no line exists in our observed stellar spectrum . our spectral analysis for sne ii - p is based on three different sources ( sne 1992h , 1999em , and 2001x ) . the three events that have much higher @ xmath28 values ( @ 127 , 127 , and 127 d ) have already been derived from the spectra of outburst 2001x , which up to that point are consistent with the data sne ii - p obtained . this is the best - known case of absorption - type spectra of sne ii ( filippenko 1997 ) . in our calculations , we use two sources of ` ` and ' ' sne ii - p ( with the data derived from observations of outburst 2001x ) , when the( , in a continuous spectrum ) , and use the color space occupied by them as a starting point for the sne . compared to sne ia , the evolutionary history of sne ii - p is relatively simple . the observed color variation is determined primarily by the changes in the color space , from dark blue at early stages , to red with age ( e . g . , filippenko 1997 ) . late - time ( @ xmath31 mag ) transitions are also characterized by strong and distinct spectral lines , like the @ xmath24 , that give sne ii - p their characteristic late - time characteristics ( see , e . g . , fig . 2 , below ) . in figure 1 ( top right ) , we see the evolutionary history of two types of sne ia high frequencies : @ xmath28 mag . @ xmath29 . one is that older sne ia when light is visible , with @ xmath32 mag . while the younger sne ia have @ xmath33 mag , older sne ia have brighter @ xmath29 colors ( @ xmath34 mag ) and brighter @ xmath28 colors , with @ xmath35 mag . there is alsonote that young ( @ xmath36 d ) sne ia have more colors ( @ xmath37 mag , @ xmath38 d ) , than do those of the sne ia - ia ( @ 19100 d ) which have the most colors of any sne . the diagram illustrates the extinction effect due to @ xmath39 levels of extinction , using the linear ##ity model of cardelli et al . we can see that the linear ##ness of young ( @ xmath40 d ) and of old ( @ xmath31 d ) sne ia can not be explained solely by the changes in their ages . first , we note that high extinction levels are unusual for sne ia . for example , the two among the sne ia ( @ xmath41 ) studied in the cfa and caln / tololo groups , and one among riess et al . ( 1999 ) , are @ xmath42 mag . furthermore , because extinction occurs only in one direction , all objects with one background color can be easily identified to be sne ia . however , the rest of the spectrum is dominated by sne of various colors . for example , the two - colorhowever , of this type , with values of @ xmath43 mag , @ xmath44 mag , would be difficult to classify based on these colors alone . but the bottom panel of figure 3 shows that if one uses an unknown color , such as @ xmath1 , this problem can be easily resolved . for the color @ xmath45 mag , there is a value of @ xmath1 that would shed more light on the other type . negative values of @ xmath46 mag would favor the type ia type , while a positive value would favor one of the core - collapse types . use of the @ xmath2 value ( fig . 3 , bottom panel ) would widen the gap even further , since for this reason , at this point , different types have different colors , from the brightest sne types to the darkest types ( ib , ib , and ib - ia ) . looking at the colored lines in the top and bottom panels of figure 3 , we will see that very little light ( @ xmath47 mag ) can transform sne ia into dark spaces created by core - collapse sne . before we proceed , we will comment on the type of core -galaxy radiation . since our contribution to the spectrum of a host galaxy is a constant constant , and this is usually determined by the age of the host galaxy , an explanation for the phenomenon should exist . it should therefore not be possible to separate the observed # ##ne from the observed spectrum . to measure the amount of self - absorption of host - galaxy radiation , with no error , we parameterize the magnitude of the observed galactic flux , at any given time , by the equation @ xmath48 where @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 are the galactic flux of the host galaxy and its neighbors , respectively , averaged over the entire length of the period of the observation . we define contamination as zero , when it is not possible to make one type of galaxy look like another . thus , we assume that for older types of sne and clusters , when @ xmath51 the effect of contamination is also zero . for younger sne galaxies , the worst - case scenario would be the presence of a young dwarf galaxy that could make them look like a core - type sne . when , for restframe type galaxies ( e . g . , @ xmath##52 ) , this effect is apparent only when @ xmath53 , and if blue bands ( e . g . , @ xmath54 ) are present , red sne can produce effects similar to those of the core - collapse events observed in @ xmath55 . the blue effect ( i . e . , of the source galaxies producing a core - collapse sne ) is much stronger , and contamination from intermediate hosts is sufficient to produce core - collapse sne with red sne ia . even minor contamination ( @ xmath56 ) from a bright blue , star - forming host galaxy can make a red - blue - ia look similar to a blue - ia on a @ xmath52 multi - color map . with blue bands ( e . g . , @ xmath54 ) , even this intense radiation produces small changes in brightness . we note that if the source galaxy flux has been removed , at least slightly , from the original source galaxy , the light has no noticeable effect . a light emission from an intermediate host ( e . g . , with a flux similar to that of the source itself ) that has already been removed can produce red sne ia with core - collapse events ,this is enough to make the g - type stars classified as sne ia . in the diagram above , we must consider illumination of the core region by light from the nearest host star . with increasing distance , the visible spectral line shifts to longer - wavelength wavelengths . the middle panel of figure 3 shows how the sne ia can be distinguished from other types at @ xmath57 on the @ xmath1 vs . @ xmath2 axes . on the @ xmath2 axis the only sne with both colors is sne ia . they are also the only type with @ xmath1 masses less than 0 . 6 mag while @ xmath2 masses less than 0 . 6 mag . during most of the age range of sne ia , their separation from other types is largely determined by the observed metal content , as can be seen from the diagram above ( the vector is derived from the observed time vector ) . the middle panel of figure 4 shows a similar situation as at @ xmath58 . dating is much more difficult . first , sne ia - types ( ` ` ` ' 2001x - p , ' ' and @ xmath59 ) with ages under 10 years .@ xmath2 values higher than sne of all types ( at all wavelengths ) . due to peak brightness , sne can have @ xmath1 values of a few tens of a magnitude higher than other types , and therefore , this effect is mainly due to noise . even where these types seem to match , like @ xmath60 mag and @ xmath61 mag , sne ia and ii - p have @ xmath1 values that are 1 . 5 times higher than other types . should any of these types be made stable by other data , such as an object that is too bright to be an type ii - p , the type will be stable or nearly so . for example , sne ia - p can be easily identified by their light ##ness ; no other spectral type has a constant constant @ xmath54 value for such a long period . in contrast , two @ xmath62 - p ( restframe ) bands separated by , say , 1 d can easily identify a type ii - p . at values greater than 0 . 2 , the @ xmath62 component of the restframe disappears , completely disappears .our color classification . currently , only one type ( @ xmath2 ) is in the cavalier - smith classification . the sdss classification system has three types ( @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 , and @ xmath12 ) covering the entire range covered by the @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 types , and even further into the range of @ xmath67 . using this classification , we can extend our classification to other frequencies . this is shown in the first part of figure 1 for sne ia @ xmath7 . first , late - time sne ia - ia are significantly brighter than other types ( @ xmath68 mag and @ xmath69 mag ) , while mid - time sne ia are significantly brighter ( @ xmath70 mag and @ xmath71 mag ) , and remain bright even in the vicinity of significant extinction by sunlight . in later stages ( about two decades ) , sne ia emerge from the range of other types and reach @ xmath72 wavelengths of 0 . 5 mag . sne iin at this time appears to be different from other types . as we move alongfurther down the color range the use of infrared ( ir ) filters is possible . between @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 , this would require a combination of ir and infrared filters . figure 4 ( bottom panel ) shows that while @ xmath75 , sne ib have distinct red colors ( @ xmath76 mag and @ xmath77 mag ) at almost identical ages , sne ii - p has very distinct @ xmath78 colors ( @ xmath79 mag ) several months after birth , and sne ib and ic are the only ones that have @ xmath80 colors that are brighter than @ xmath81 colors . as such , these colors are not affected by age . between @ xmath82 and 1 . 5 our colors fall into the range covered by the bessell @ xmath27 code . in the bottom panel of figure 4 ( @ xmath83 ) , we can see that sne ib has much fewer @ xmath80 colors ( @ xmath84 mag ) , seen at ages of one to two years , and only by the younger years iin , ii - p , and ic2 . sne ib and ib are the only events to have high @ xmath80 and @ xmath85 between them . the use of synthetic colors , obtained from spectra of distant sne , to identify high - @ xmath12 events , ensures that type ia does not vary along with them . the relationship , to a rough approximation , between the spectra of distant sne ia and their close counterparts has been established ( riess et al . 1998 ; smith et al . 2000 ) . however , for all other types of sne , high - resolution spectra of distant ( @ xmath86 ) events are currently available . since we use synthetic spectral colors , any significant change in either the spectral type or the emission and absorption lines will affect our classification method . however , this is a problem that will be solved when spectra of the core - type sne become available . we will consider the spectra of distant sne ia and their characteristics for our classification method . using the same method as above , we have the spectra of the two common types of distant sne ia : overluminous ( @ 1991t - 2 ; e . g . , filippenko et al . 1992a ) and underluminous (( 1991bg - 1 ; e . g . , filippenko et al . 1992b ) and , as well as that of the 2000cx , a second type ia that could be considered a subtype of its own ( smith et al . figure 6 gives more details for these ) . in figure 6 ( top panel ) , which shows the @ xmath28 vs . @ xmath29 levels of the two type i subtypes at full brightness , we see that , although the colors of normal sne ia in color space are different from those of ` ` normal ' ' sne ia , they share the same color space . on the other hand , in the top panel of figure 7 , showing @ xmath1 vs . @ xmath2 , at full brightness , we can see that underluminous sne ia have much higher @ xmath2 levels ( by approx . 1 . 5 % ) than those of the normal sne ia , and are more likely to interact with the other core - body components . this is illustrated in the bottom panel of the next figure , where normal , underluminous sne ia from all stages ( up to@ xmath87 c ) can easily be distinguished from core - collapse sne . later in their evolution , these stars develop blue components ( @ xmath88 d , @ xmath89 d ) that are different from the other types of sne . because ngc 1991t - like and ngc 2000cx - like stars are almost always brighter than ` ` ` ' ' sne ia , they are relatively easy to distinguish from core - collapse sne , and pose a significant challenge for our understanding . sne ia of the underluminous , variable , and 1991bg - like types are difficult to distinguish from core - collapse sne in early stages , and may be problematic for age - based models . this problem is very apparent at low energies , where underluminous sne ia are found ( @ xmath90 % of the type ia data ; li et al . 2001a ) , and may be completely absent at high energies where , indeed , the 1991bg - like events have not been found at all ( li et al . 2001a ) . high - energy type ia studies that focus on the sne ia forbrightness and quality measurements address the problem of spectral overlap with other spectral types , especially the si version of sne ii ( riess et al . 1998 ; clocchiatti et al . 2000 ) . the problem is two - fold . first , the si - type sne uses very valuable brightness data for its observations . second , when very low signal - to - noise ratio spectra of bright , low - @ xmath12 stars are available , the sne ii will classify as sne ia . the latter problem becomes apparent for low @ xmath12 , since at these wavelengths the si ii pattern ( the si ia @ xmath91 pattern ) is missing out of the visible spectrum , and sne ia stars lack the characteristic x and y peaks that distinguish sne ia and sne ib , respectively . spectra with high signal - to - noise ratio can provide better results ( smith et al . 2000 ) , but these are time - consuming to obtain . > from table 1 , one concludes that spectral analysis can help , at least partially , to solve this problem . we define and apply the well known ` ` rule of thumb ' ' ( e . g . , riess et al . 2001 ): sne ia is not compared to sne ic at a certain temperature . we can see that , for sne ic ages that are known for pre - @ xmath12 band data , used to estimate sne ic surface temperatures , sne ia have about 1 . 5 % less of @ xmath72 than sne ic , well below the maximum level of confidence . while it is possible that younger ( pre - maximum ) sne ia have ages similar to those of older ( @ xmath92 , near maximum ) sne ic , only the most basic physical information ( e . g . , whether the temperature is increasing or decreasing ) prevents this illusion . figure 1 also illustrates the fact that most of the data at this time can be obtained from the @ xmath72 band data , and the use of @ xmath12 - band data does not appear to be cost - effective . @ 2001fg was the first known ic from sdss ##s . this object was discovered on 1 december 2001 . . vanden ##berg et al . ( 2001 ) with @ xmath93 , @ xmath94 , and @ xmath952 . observing the star - pattern and looking for the host star ( @ xmath96 , see below ) , we can see ( fig . 1 ) that the mass and the age of the host star can be determined . the spectrum clearly indicates this is a young star , about one year old . further observations by filippenko & chornock ( 2001 ) using the keck observatory 10 - meter telescope indicate that the object is indeed a type ia , designated @ xmath96 . the spectrum is similar to those of sne ia , two months past maximum brightness . this result , at the time of the first observation ( in december 2001 ) , indicates the object only one month past maximum brightness at present , confirming our hypothesis . a more ` ` active ' ' approach would have , of course , required an extensive spectroscopy and gravitational search for the potential host star . the search described above will be much more difficult when more detailed data are available . however , non - @ xmath12 sne are often observed at longer wavelengths ( i . e . , @ xmath62 , @ xmath65 , and @ xmath66 ##0 ) . in theto use these data for analysis , knowledge of the restframe uv spectrum is required . currently , uv spectra are available for only a handful of types , but classifications like those presented here allow multi - dimensional analysis of all data for each individual subtype . the properties of the various object types , most importantly the absolute peak magnitude and their values for every object type , the typical light curves , and the relative rates of the different types , would also be useful . with this information at hand , one could use the limiting properties of the system to determine , for each object type , at what time it is close enough to be observed , thus avoiding any errors in the data . a similar approach could be used to deal with the regions of deep space that are dominated by many different object types . using the typical light curve and absolute peak magnitude for different types , and the relative rates , one could calculate the amount of time an event of a certain type exists in that region and calculate the probability that the observed event belongs to a certain type . as previously described in @ xmath97 , work along these lines has been done by dg2002 , which found the experimental data with various assumptions and predictions .sne are usually identified by their colors . however , the methods used in this area may allow us to identify sne by their colors only . however , these methods have already been used for the detection of one type of binary , gamma - ray burst ##ers ( rhoads 2001 ) . multi - year wide - area surveys ( e . g . , becker et al . 2001 ; jannuzi et al . 2001 ; sdss ##ky et al . 2000 ) that are either ongoing or already underway may be able to detect large populations of sne using these methods . to illustrate this point , we show in figure 1 the population of sne of these samples at @ xmath98 , starting with the region in which lie the vast majority of stars , galaxies , radio galaxies , cepheids , and planets , as measured by krisciunas , margon , & szkody ( 1998 ) . as for one - year sne samples , these sne have higher @ xmath99 ##8 and higher @ xmath72 values than these samples . similar values were found for the same sample at @ xmath100 00 . therefore , the number of sne .and the sdss . this demonstrates the importance of the use of sne , a technique which can serve as an important tool when applied to complex , complex data sets . an important example of the results presented in this paper would be the study of sne variation in the sdss equatorial strip . during the months of june to december , when the primary target of the sdss , the south galactic pole , is not visible , the sdss also observes parts of the sky near the south galactic pole . the so called ` ` continuous equatorial strip ' ' is the section of sky that will be observed continuously during the 5 - year continuous period of the telescope . according to the sdss website ( http : / / www . sdss . org / www / 5yearbaseline . pdf ) , this 270 - kilometer area will be observed @ xmath101 , during the 5 - year period , or about 20 times per year , on average . assuming that this data reflects the average of the sne that occurred during the @ xmath19 when this area is observed per year , for 5 years , the total observed area is @ xmath102 deg @ xmath103 - 1 , or 337 . 5 .##g @ xmath103 - a . gonzalez et al . ( 1996 ) have calculated a ne ##a frequency of one per cent per square kilometer in the frequency range @ xmath104 , and the absolute magnitude of the sdss ##s in this range is given by @ xmath105 ##a . we would therefore expect about 2300 sne ia ##s , and a rate of about 10 , 000 sne ia in this range . the rate of sne of all objects ( not just galaxies ) would probably be much higher . miknaitis et al . ( 2001b ) report that a systematic search for sne in these regions is underway , and the first sne has already been found ( miknaitis et al . 2001a ; gonzalez , miceli , & covarrubias 2001 ; miknaitis & krisciunas 2001 ) . this relatively new dataset , which will contain an order of magnitude more events than any other known sne , combined with narrow - band ##ing and many other observed effects , is an excellent tool for future research . as an example , type ia , based on analysis of observations , can be estimated as a function of absolute magnitude , sub - stellar mass , and the##hift . however , it is true that comparing data for clusters of a sne every year is still possible . the data could still be a useful tool . the sdss supplies narrow - band data , along with ready - made tools for the determination of the spectra for all the clusters , and spectral lines for all of the faint galaxies . this makes our method of using the available data for classification , assuming that the source is known , even more efficient . since no data is required , such an analysis may not be done any considerable time in advance , and may even be carried out only after the project is completed , and after the data are made available . in particular , we have developed our method for the classification of sne , called multi - spectral spectral analysis . we have shown that the spectrum of a galaxy can be easily determined in many ways . even when this is not the case , limitations on the classification may still be imposed . in particular , sne clusters may be different from core - type sne during certain periods of their existence , for some of the source and cluster lines observed . also , we have demonstrated the application of our method to a newly discovered sample from the sdss , andwe have shown how this technique can be a useful tool for the analysis of the large sample samples expected to result from this and other studies that are currently underway or to be completed . this study shows that direct analysis is not necessarily a requirement for sne to become a useful analytical tool , and lays the foundation for the analysis of large sample samples for which direct analysis may not be possible . we thank the many colleagues in s . i . s . r . at the university of california , berkeley ( including j . j . smith , j . chornock , j . r . smith , and j . r . smith ) who , over the years , helped collect and analyze the spectra that comprise most of the dataset used in this study . we are grateful to a . fassia , a . hamuy , and y . qiu for providing us with the images of their images of the 1998s , 1999ee , and 1996cb , j . a . leibundgut who provided us with j - curves , and we thank j . smith , j . a . ofek , r . smith , and j . shemmer for their contributions . we appreciate the efforts of the members of thebush ( in hawaii ) where the samples were collected . this research project made use of the nasa / ipac data archive ( ned ) , which is maintained by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . m . f . received funding from the national science foundation the david adler foundation for space research , on 2000 / 01 - 01 . d . m . f . is responsible for the financial support of nasa grants ast9417213 and ast9987438 , as well as of the rockefeller foundation . aldering , j . , # ##e . smith , & the solar observatory inc . 2001 , nasa , 199 . 1100 . 01 arnett , j . a . , bahcall , j . a . , kirshner , r . j . , & woosley , r . j . 1989 , araa , 72 , 629 barbon , j . , ciatti , g . , & rosino , g . 1979 , a & p , 76 , 287 becker , j . , et al . 2001 , nasa , 199 . 1101 . 01 ;
