nuclei in interaction with magnetic fields exhibit a wide variety of collective vibrations known as pairing modes , associated with high degrees of freedom and multipolarities . the giant isovector nuclear resonance and the giant isoscalar quadrupole resonance are the most important phenomena of this type of resonance . this resonance phenomenon , that is associated with increases in the number of particles , has been discovered in the paper @ xcite and published , under the name of nuclear magnetic resonance , since the middle of the 80 ##s in a series of papers @ xcite . this phenomenon , despite the great efforts made to find the energy differences between the high - energy lines in ( s , t ) modes @ xcite , is still without any solid experimental evidence . for further information , see particluar in connection with multi - electron resonance reactions , on the phenomenon of pairing modes in nuclei we refer to the recent paper @ xcite . we have studied the phenomenon of collective vibration associated with high - energy in the electron capture beam with the aim to demonstrate the existence of an intermediate state as a useful tool to improve the understanding of pairing modes @ xcite . the main problem is that with all capture beams one is faced with a large energy difference that canallows the formation of high - energy electrons and allows the transition to the ground state of the reaction product . thus the optimal p - state state for the ( @ xmath3he , @ xmath4he ) chemical reaction is the ground state and should allow the transition to the - 20 mev transition state . we have performed two - particle rpa calculations on gold and bcs + rpa on copper , both as examples of liquid and superfluid systems , on the transition to the spin vibrations . all the two - particle interaction scale parameters have been included within the parameters of the standard model @ xcite and used in dwba computer simulations . we have observed cross - coupling of the order of several millibarns , for almost the entire transition to the ground state . recently we performed similar calculations for other , larger systems to provide a basis for further calculations . the close relationship between two - particle and two - electron interactions is now well established both from the theoretical side @ xcite and from the experimental side for what are high - energy he ##s in closed atomic nuclei and spin vibrations in open nuclei . the high number of atoms of the @ xmath5 ##he ##izes the low - lyingenergy ( 10 - 20 mev for atomic nuclei ) is defined here as the spin number of 2p ( or 2h ) states in the first major shell of the atomic nucleus . we have already described the concept in detail . ( [ fig1 ] ) . for closed shell nuclei the coupling of a pair of states ( or particles ) to the next major shell , with the corresponding energy @ xmath6 , is expected to have a high degree of collectivity . and in the case of open shell nuclei the same is true for the coupling of a pair of particles with @ xmath7 energy . for atomic nuclei the hamiltonian with the monopole operator , is : @ xmath8 where @ xmath9 is a pair of particles coupling to @ xmath10 with angular momentum . getting rid of all the problems of the solution of the pp - rpa problem ( that can be found in the previously mentioned paper of the author ) we can assume that the atomic phonon can be understood as a pair of 2p ( or 2h ) states with equal forward and backward spin ( @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 ) . the spin - number , that isthe measure of the amount of collectivity of for each state @ xmath13 , is given by : @ xmath14 . \ hat { p5 } \ ] ] this measure is shown in the first column of fig . ( [ fig2 ] ) for the pairing ( upper panel ) and the processes ( lower panel ) . in the second column is shown the pairing strength of for the addition of @ xmath1sn . to obtain these two values for superfluid atomic systems one has to change the hamiltonian according to the bcs rules and then to solve the complicated rpa problem . in this case the pairing strength for the addition of the states is given , for each state @ xmath13 , by : @ xmath15 _ { 00 } | - \ rangle = \ sum _ { 1 } \ sqrt { 2j + 1 } [ u ^ { 2 } _ { 2 } x _ { j } ( j ) + u ^ { 1 } _ { 1 } x _ { j } ( j ) ] \ ] ] where the @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 are the two pairing ##s . the amount of collectivity is a useful measure of the current stateof the pairing resonance in the low - light energy range . we will display here a number of similar results for other well known nuclei = 9 . 4pc = 9 . 4pc = 9 . 4pc with the intention of giving useful information to experimentalists on the subject . we believe that calcium and calcium are two of the most likely candidates . we have studied several samples of nuclei with double shells . even if the relative energy of the @ xmath18 is high , it is important to note that little change is seen in the more electron - rich @ xmath19ca with respect to @ xmath20ca . an important difference in this process is both due to the different electronic states of the two nuclei as well as to the methods that we use to determine the range of the ##t states . the latter is important for the collectivity of the addition modes of both the nuclei and also for the difficulty of working out the relative energy of the addition modes . we have also looked for @ xmath21zr where the range is much more limited and the determination of the gpv is more difficult . in the case of broglia and the values for the energy of the pairing resonance are given by @ xmath22 mevand @ xmath23 mev for normal and superfluid systems respectively . our calculations follow from these calculations based on previous calculations ( and are more accurate in the case of sharp systems ) as derived from the [ ta1 ] . . comparison of values of gpv between our calculations and the broglia and smith calculations . [ ^ = " ^ , ^ , ^ " , ^ = " ^ " , ] = 13 . 8pc = 13 . 8pc these cross - sections have been calculated for energy states , and we refer to the table in the previous section when is of order of magnitude ##s . the cross - section for the low - energy energy states has a small ( and infinite ) width that should be sufficient for a more accurate measurement of the system . we have found a simple solution that uses a lorentzian distribution with a width that varies quadratically with the measured value , @ xmath24 , with @ xmath25 , to give a value of 24 mev for the gpv . this could be quite simple since there is no need for an _ a priori _ distribution of this width . we have been attracted to this simple solution because all energy states ( of this energy ) are in the same regioneach has different rules for their width , and it is possible to use this information to narrow the low - energy states and to expand the high - energy states . the experimental results for the nuclear reactions occurring in helium are shown in figure [ fig4 ] where the lines corresponding to the cross - sections shown above have been shaded to give a view of the relative speed of the transitions to the ground state and to the gpv states . it is important to note that in the case of helium there is a considerable difference from the proton beams , but in general is much less intense . one sees the advantage for unstable beams when comparing the results for the pairing resonance in the ( a ) and b ) states with the one at zero energy : in the latter case the transition to the ground state is more rapid . # @ xmath3he ##q is now available ( or possibly will be available in the very near future ) for using the proton beams from around the world and the results that we have presented could be a basis for future experiments designed to explore the as yet - unraveled nature of pairing resonance in helium beams , using # ##ally ##l ##s as possible targets . the author wishes to formally initiate collaboration with andrea vitturi , peter muller andw von oertzen , some aspects of theoretical and experimental ion physics . the conference of the _ _ international sub - commission on heavy ion physics , dubna , bulgaria _ 2002 has been published by the infn . xxxx ##v . a . broglia and d . r . sofia , plb691291977 . m . a . herzog , m . a . liotta and m . j . sibanda , _ phys . _ _ * 14 * , 259 , ( 1985 ) . et al _ , prl 3914511977 . w . von oertzen and a . vitturi , _ j . phys . _ * 14 * , 1247 - 1337 , ( 2001 ) . a . fortunato , w . von oertzen , d . r . sofia and a . vitturi , _ eur . _ _ * 14 * , ( 2002 ) , in f . a . a . dasso and a . vitturi ( 1987 ) , _ _ theory of electron spin resonance _ , _ proc . 1 , ( editrice compositori italiana , 1987 ) . d . r . sofia and r . a . bro##glia , _ phys . _ _ * * * , 2349 , ( 1971 ) . c . h . dasso and a . pollarolo , plb 1552231985 . c . h . dasso and a . vitturi , prl 596341987 .
