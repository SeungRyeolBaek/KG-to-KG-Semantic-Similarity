there is strong experimental evidence that a large amount of the original local stellar population is still in existence at present @ xmath4 . however , only a small fraction of these galaxies are fully assembled @ xcite . the galaxies are smaller by a factor of three to four compared to present - day ellipticals of similar size . their relative gas density ratios are at least an order of magnitude higher @ xcite with much higher apparent sizes compared to their low mass counterparts . these results are difficult to reconcile with the more complex evolution scenarios for elliptical galaxies . the simple conclusion from the study is that local elliptical - type galaxies can neither be fully formed by a simple stellar collapse nor a simple merger of gas - rich galaxies at high mass , unless their loss in mass can be explained by other processes such as adiabatic collapse or by strong mass loss and / or thermal instability @ xcite . thus , the dynamic evolution of the stellar population is in conflict with evolution of the ellipticals @ xcite . + dry ( i . e . gas - rich , collisionless ) gas and stellar collapse processes are the best explanation for the high mass and energy loss of the population . @ xmath5@ xcite . the mere presence of a dissipative gas in the major merger process would increase the size growth ( see e . g . @ xcite ) . the giant ellipticals are not very large at this time , but we know from the structure of the wave ##front that minor mergers should be much more common than major mergers until n = 1 . the early - type galaxies may undergo no more than one major merger ( with a high dark matter content , see also @ xcite ) since @ xmath6 ( @ xcite , see also @ xcite ) with no significant difference from major mergers for the case of @ xcite . the large number of very massive early - type galaxies is also explained by the fact that small ( @ xmath7 ) galaxies like @ xmath8 may undergo only one major merger or more until @ xmath9 and minor mergers are much more than @ xcite . on average , this is not enough to allow for the expected mass and size growth ( see also @ xcite ) . the major mergers at least increase the size of a typical two dimensional galaxy by a factor of two and allow for dark matter , increasing the size growth at @ xcite . in this case wethen , as a proof of concept , a very high resolution computer simulation of the dynamics of a galaxy with two successive mergers of @ xmath10 in combination with other physical factors to show that the very fast population growth and slow expansion of elliptical galaxies can be explained by large sizes and high expansion rates . the model is therefore very simple . at high resolution the large ellipticals have two - particle numbers of @ xmath11 with other galaxies of much smaller sizes . as we know from the collision events ( see e . g . @ xcite ) , to model such a system as such we need a gravitational constant of 50 % of the galaxy mass , which in our case is of the order of @ xmath12 and we need particle numbers of @ xmath13 to model the system in a simple computer simulation in the same model . however , to accurately model the system high resolution and high accuracy are required . using the virial model we obtain a rough picture of how an intermediate two - dimensional stellar system forms when mass in stellar systems is reduced . we assume that a new intermediate stellar system has evolved dissipatively from mass . this .assume a total energy @ xmath14 , a mass @ xmath15 , a gravitational radius @ xmath16 , and the mean square speed of the stars is @ xmath17 . according to the virial equation @ xcite the total energy of the stars is @ xmath18 we can assume that they are periodic with masses averaging @ xmath19 , mass totaling @ xmath20 , mean energy @ xmath21 and mean square speed averaging @ xmath22 . we define the total energy derived from all the stellar mass @ xmath23 and the total total energy of the stars as @ xmath24 , mass averaging @ xmath25 . for energy balance ( the results from computer models are that the stars go into circular orbits ) , the total energy of the initial system is @ xmath26 the energy of the final system is @ xmath27 . , the ratio of the final to initial mean square speed is @ xmath28 . , the ratio of the final to initial gravitational radius is @ xmath29 and for the ratio of the mass we have @ xmath30 if during one or more of thea massive system increases in mass by a factor of two with @ xmath31 . this mass increase may be caused by an intermediate - mass merger in which all the mean square errors of the two systems are equal and remain constant in the initial system ( eqn . [ disp ] ) . the radius increases by a factor of two ( eqn . [ ps ] ) and the density decreases by a factor of two ( eqn . [ ps ] ) ( see also @ xcite ) . if , however , the initial mass increase by a factor of two is caused by merger of two massive systems with @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 , and the mean square errors are reduced by a factor of , the radius becomes two times larger and the density is reduced by a factor of two with respect to the initial system ( see also @ xcite for a simple calculation of the above formula ) . we know from the calculation of the schechter constant for the distribution of the mass that a massive system ( @ xmath34 ) gets most of its mass from intermediate mass , and so the above calculation also makes it more likely that even if massive mergers do occur ,they are the main drivers for the increase in size and mass of the stars . ) the halo formed by the interaction of in - situ particles , at high resolution ( @ xmath35 ) it is very complex . , [ = 302 ] we have done a full black - hole / sph high - resolution computer - simulation of the active galactic nucleus . the process of setting up the initial model is described in detail in @ xcite and is being completed . we will re - run the halo system @ xmath36 high resolution using the wmap - based @ xcite model with a model consisting of @ xmath37 ( @ xmath38 = 100 @ xmath39 , @ xmath40mpc @ xmath40 ) with @ xmath41 = 0 . 1 , @ xmath42 = 0 . 5 , @ xmath43 = 0 . 3 , and @ xmath44 = 0 . 4 . to re - run the halo system at high resolution we set the initial model to @ xmath45 stars and dark matter particles in a large volume at 100 @ xmath46 . the particles that pile up in thevirialized matter ( we assumed a constant density of @ xmath47 ) of the galaxy was @ xmath9 . the gravitational effects from objects in the high density region were replaced by more massive dark matter particles in the boundary layers of lower density . the galaxy was also affected by these boundary layers . the virial ##ization . is determined by the black hole radius . the gray ##ness of the magnetic field . . , [ = 302 ] the simulation was performed with helium - 4 @ xcite and woodhen at the cambridge picscie hpc , for a total of 177 , 000 cpu ##s on two computers . we assumed a constant comoving density until @ xmath48 , and then the density , e . g . for the galaxy , remained constant until the @ xmath49 . the density of each individual star system was @ xmath50 and we assumed two stars per sph ##50 . star formation and evolution from stars was simulated with the multi - particle system model of @ xcite . we used the energy - density ratio of @ xmath51 for the rate of star formation to avoid runaway star formation at high temperatures . the lowest energy is for star formation .@ xmath52 and the star formation time - series at @ xmath53 . we also show the total cosmic background radiation , measured both at @ xmath54 ( at @ xcite ) . at present the galaxy has a total virial mass of @ xmath55 and a total stellar mass of @ xmath0 . the ratio of total stellar mass to stellar mass is only a factor of 10 less than expected from gravitational lensing in @ xcite , however , this is similar to the other estimates made for the milky way galaxy ( e . g . @ xcite , see at @ xcite ) . the main stellar disk is an elliptical galaxy with shapes very similar to the ones described in @ xcite and in this case we will focus on some aspects of the shape and the distribution of the stellar mass . ( black hole ) . from @ xmath56 to @ xmath9 the size increases by a factor of @ xmath57 . we also show the distribution of the in - between r - band ( blue triangle ) and l - band ( red triangle ) gravitational - wave bands . numbers of recent stellar events , e . g . the most recent ( 1 : 1 ) merger since n = 1 .z = 0 . 5 . , z = 302 ] during the formation of the central galaxy we have divided the stars within the initial radius of @ xmath58 at their radial velocity into stars that have formed in - situ from gas within the galaxy and stars that have formed beyond this radius and have formed end - situ . the mass distribution both of the in - situ and other components of the stellar system is shown in detail . the initial mass assembly at @ xmath59 is characterized by the formation of in - situ stars with a large radius towards @ xmath60 . at this time very few stars have formed at @ xmath58 . the remaining 10 % of stars are due to the formation of stars from within the surrounding stellar system at distances greater than @ xmath58 . the first part of fig . [ the _ space _ to _ be _ born _ stars ] shows the mass distribution of the in - situ stars at @ z = 5 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 . at z = 5 and z = 20 the central galaxy is being built up from gas , in the outer region of the galaxy core , by a nearby stellar system . the in -situ and core distances increase by more than an order of magnitude towards higher distances . the observed half - mass profiles of the in - situ star components , show that the in - situ component becomes more massive ( see also @ xcite ) at @ xmath10 @ xmath61 and the radius increases by about a factor of two ( @ xmath62 ) until n = 1 . in the top right of fig . [ acc _ 1 _ 1 _ 1 _ 1 _ 1 ] we show the density profiles for the components that have formed at @ xmath58 and have been observed head - on . this component is more massive at larger distances and has a similar density profile . the core radius is roughly constant at @ xmath63 and the radius at lower distances also increases towards @ xmath9 . the half - mass radius of this component is much larger than for the in - situ component ( @ xmath64 ) . the central core of the system is largely dominated by in - situ stars whereas at distances near @ xmath65 and at distances farther than @ xmath66 the core is dominated by accret##ed ##g . ( black dots ) and @ xmath9 ( red dots ) . the black and red dots are the best known sersic ##s . at higher z the star has a higher projected surface brightness and is more [ . , z = 302 ] in length . [ . ] we show the observed evolution of the edge - on and half - radius of stars in the elliptical galaxy and the spiral galaxy @ xmath58 as a function of z . in @ xmath10 the star population is a simple disk - like or ring - like structure with a maximum value of @ xmath67 and a minimum of @ xmath68 at z = 3 . here the population increases by a maximum of @ xmath69 to its maximum value of @ xmath70 . we also show the observed half - light curves in the rest frame k - and l - bands for the stellar mass profile of @ xcite at higher metalicity . in general the half - mass projections match the half - mass radius curve at higher z as well . the k - band rest - frame surface brightness profiles for edge - on stars at z = 2 and z = 3 are similar .2 . [ kmag _ 1 ] in agreement with the above estimated sersic index . consider the observed profile of @ xcite for the large galactic arc system . at high mass the system is very compact , @ xmath71 , and has a high sersic index of @ xmath72 . this is in agreement with the system being round and pear - shaped . at low mass the system is very compact @ xmath73 , and the sersic index has increased to @ xmath74 . the system is much less massive than the sdss b - type galaxies at this distance and is outside the cluster region ( @ xcite , see also @ xcite ) . the values shown in the figure are rounding errors for this simple model . as we have shown , the change in observed values is primarily caused by the increase in surface temperature and not by stellar activity . at z = 3 the system has a projected effective mass of @ xmath75 with an effective mass @ xmath76 and a projected effective mass of @ xmath77 . the projected effective line - of - sight mass value is @ xmath78 . the observed value at z = 3and @ xmath79 , @ xmath80 , @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 , which is a special case for s - type stars of this type @ xcite . from z = 3 to z = 0 the density changes from @ xmath83 ( see figure [ 2 ] ) and we can solve for the above scaling relation @ xmath84 and @ xmath33 ( which is a good indication that the system is expanding in very small amounts and we have the most accurate model since z = 3 with a mass ratio of 1 : 1 ) . the z = 0 models of the solar system are similar to the above model , however , the size change as well as the change in density and mass are more significant . this is not surprising as the stellar evolution of the system is more complicated and there is near - perfect in - situ star formation between z = 3 and z = 1 . however , the above scaling relations for stellar evolution predict the evolution of the system from z = 3 to z = 1 as well . however , simulations of more massive ellipticals than the one shown above show an even greater variation of @ xcite .this result would be reversed if the evolution of the massive galaxies were much more dominated by minor mergers and stellar formation . in addition , the increase in velocity evolution is in quantitative agreement with # ##hand calculations for @ xcite . indeed , @ xcite has shown a very rapid expansion of the universe at a 1kpc of only a factor of - 3 . this result is in quantitative agreement with our data which shows a decrease of only a factor 0 . 5 from z = 1 to z = 5 . we also show that the stellar density of the galaxy is also increasing at high resolution . for @ xmath8 the galaxy has a mean mass of @ xmath85 and a mean star formation rate of of @ xmath86 and an average stellar density of @ xmath87 . in this way we show that the observed mass and density evolution of the galaxies corresponds with what is to be expected from a high resolution cosmological model of the universe which evolved at different scales dominated by minor mergers and formation of stars . we can then use the linear equations derived from the virial model to show that that the observed increase and decrease in mass and density evolution is a direct consequence ofmass assembly produces the most massive stellar system and mass @ xcite and can also be explained by mass assembly being driven by the solar system . in the model , the initial phase @ xmath88 followed by in - situ star formation from the surrounding stars ( see e . g . @ xcite and discussed below ) produces a massive and dense stellar system with mass @ xmath89 . this phase of the formation of the system of ellipticals is followed by an intermediate phase @ xmath90 with less in - situ star formation and the production of more material . this material can be produced at smaller distances and increases the density of the system with mass . at the same time the material density is increased by the cooling from the massive stars ( mass @ xcite ) . the resulting mass assembly is explained by the increasing mass of the in - situ stars being first and , at larger distances , then later by the accreted stars . from z = 1 to z = 10 the effective temperature of the system increases by a factor of 1 . 5 with a decrease in the material density of more than an order of magnitude and a decrease in mass increase of 10 % , in good agreement with thefrom simple mathematical models for the formation of gas planets . the results of dark matter models ( see e . g . @ xcite ) as well as direct observations ( see e . g . @ xcite ) of the gas exchange processes of s - type galaxies and their dark matter models show the possibility of minor mergers . in particular , due to the nature of the transfer function , massive systems of high masses are more likely to undergo minor mergers , than low mass systems . if the mass distribution is in general dominated by minor mergers we would expect a significant mass distribution , e . g . , if high mass systems are larger than low mass systems . at the same time minor mergers may also play an important role for the further heating of the gas , thus allowing the formation of new stars @ xcite . the picture of the first massive expansion process for young spiral galaxies shows a number of possibilities . in the first dissipative phase , high mass systems form , and become the primary components of present - day ellipticals . in addition , it is of particular importance if the gas is transported to the nucleus by collapse or mergers of debris disks ##eous galaxies ( see e . g . @ xcite ) .long as it is on a long timescale . the stars formed at this early stage are likely to be highly enriched in metal - rich as seen from both @ xcite and from the outer core of the host galaxy . later , metal - poor stars from other galaxies are formed and fill the core of the galaxy resulting in the observed metalicity distribution . this star - forming model was also made possible by the observations of @ xcite . this is an important part of the model presented in this paper . if so , then the outer cores of the galaxy ellipticals will have to be old , massive , metal - poor and will diffuse from galaxy to galaxy since they are probably composed mainly of the material from tidally locked , massive stars . the study was conducted at the la picscie hpc facility . this model is used in the dfg centre of the structure and evolution of the universe . we thank marijn franx , pieter van dokkum and ignacio trujillo for their input on the model . , d . j . , naab , m . , brown , d . j . , somerville , d . j . , brown , j . r . j . , barden , m . , brown , d . ,rix , j . -
