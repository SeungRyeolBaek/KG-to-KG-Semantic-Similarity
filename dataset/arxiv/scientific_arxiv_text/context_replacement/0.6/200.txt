the study of @ xmath1 - transition systems is in many ways limited by the structural properties of these films . in particular , the ladder - type poly - p - phenylenes ( lppp ) @ xcite offer the opportunity to study rigid , ladder - type structures of planarised phenylene films . as a result , the @ xmath1 - transition is spread out over the entire molecule and the vibronic component of the @ xmath2 transition is called @ xcite . in order to study the properties of the individual films @ xcite , including the overall reaction mechanism , molecular oligomers have been used in the past to study the low - energy and stationary states of the films @ xcite . absorption of lppp films @ xcite has been described as a function of the energy of the first photon , Î± . the initial absorption peak of the photocurrent occurs between the initial peak and the absorption peak at higher energies and is in this case about 1 . 5 ev . this part of the photocurrent which does not appear after the absorption plateau is sometimes called ` ` drift ' ' . a possible explanation for this phenomenon relies on the presenceof the possible excited states for the two species . excited states of @ xmath1 - like polymers are often described as tightly coupled electron - hole pairs . this general description comes from solid - state studies of ( si ) nano - conductors . therefore , these excited states are often referred to as excitons , although they need to be clearly distinguished from the other excited states of the polymer . a high value of the exciton photon energy for these states has been obtained , e . g . , from scanning electron microscopy experiments @ xcite which has led to a value of 1 @ xmath3 + . excited states with a higher energy , and fewer electron - hole pairs , therefore , should be more sensitive to the interaction via an external electric field . from this observation , the idea has been put forward that such a phenomenon is responsible for the # ##ening of the photocurrent in poly - phenylene - vinylene ( ppv ) @ xcite . later on , another proposal has emerged based on the observed photon energy which is equal to the photon energy of @ xcite . the latter proposal is not widely accepted . in order to apply these calculations for excited states of @ xmath1 - conju##gated polymers , or oligomers of the lppp , with up to 14 phenylene rings are used in this study . the study of oligomers consisting of one ( infinite ) chain extends the previously mentioned study and allows the direct comparison with polymers . the main limitation to the study in gas phase is the limitation to infinite length in the film . since the vacuum tested polymers are much more complex one has to consider the different molecular substituents corresponding to lppp by themselves ( see figure [ fig : 1 ] and figure [ fig : 2 ] ) . this should have only one effect on the optical properties , which are dominated by the molecular orbitals of @ xmath1 - 4 . these molecular substituents are not necessary for the water content of the film , or to prevent the formation of bubbles in the film ( @ xmath4 = 4 . ##f [ fig : 1 ] ) . since the polymers themselves cannot reach the limit of the infinite chain length required for lppp ( @ 14 phenylene rings @ xcite ) , ab - initio and other experimental methods are not available , and one has to assent to more experimental methods# ( am1 , indo / s ; see below ) . similarly , the wave functions of the corresponding ground state are the indo ( slater ##s of the equations ) and ##s @ xmath5 @ xcite . for the excited state @ xmath6 ( the symbol [ phicisdef ] ) , the indo / s calculation is done in the quasi - classical form . the excited state with the lowest frequency will be denoted as @ xmath7 for the first excited state , @ xmath8 for the second excited state and @ xmath9 for the higher energy , ` ` frenkel - type ' ' state . the corresponding ground state will be denoted as @ xmath10 , the same system is also described . in sect . [ geometryspectra ] , the results for the physical properties of the oligomers and their properties are given . the second part of this section , sect . [ physics ] , focuses on the development of a general ##ization scheme for ground - state wave functions . the approach to indo / s wave functions is in a similar way to the description of the excited states as the black - body states . a brief introduction to the section . although there iswhen wanting to calculate the two oligomers using higher - order methods , the oligomer with two phenylene groups ( @ xmath11 ) has been calculated using mp2 / p - - - * _ @ xcite ( mller - plesset pertubation method of first principles ) . the results are used as a basis for the above method . in the example of brdas _ et al . _ @ xcite , one has to use a different method which describes the molecular structure . in the first step the ideal ##ized parametrization ( am1 ) @ xcite shows an almost perfect match with the mp2 method ( cf . @ xmath12 for the phase diagram in figure [ 1 : 2 ] ) . this method can also be used to determine the molecular structure of the transition states . note , however , that the pm3 method @ xcite gives better results for zero - point transition states ( zpe ) . the am1 and mp2 calculations have been carried out on an ibm / sp2 computer using the gaussian94 ( g . d4 ) @ xcite software library . the structures are obtained by analysis of the atoms##ian ##d , whereby the zero - point energies ( zpe ) have been calculated , etc . the results can be given unscaled in the table . in the second step , the excited states are calculated as zerner @ indo / s and @ xcite based on the different am1 energies from the two excited states . here it is shown that the electronic configurations of the excited states are different . the upper ci space consists of the 22 highest occupied and the 22 lowest occupied ci orbitals . this is the largest ci space found in the ci space , and it contains orbitals of @ xmath13 and for the oligomers as well . as well , the electronic configuration ##al ##g . the ci space contains @ xmath1 @ xmath14 electrons . the analysis of the spectra has been performed on the pentiumiii processor using the intel core architecture 1 . 0 @ xcite . in order to give a more accurate picture of the different bond lengths , charge distributions and least - squares related to the indo / s bond strengths . this method produces spectra with high bond strengths which are close in magnitude to the electronic configuration . this is also the case for the low - energy states of thee , in which the @ xmath15 transitions affect others . the transition states are clearly visible in the visible part , and consist of a number of possible transitions corresponding to the rest of the total . ##e ( figure [ fig : 1 ] ) . the visible part of the spectrum contains all states with one transition , except in rare cases , where two nearly identical states are seen together . in these cases only one transition can be seen ( the @ xmath2 transition for the @ xmath11 oligomer and the @ xmath16 transition for the rest ; see figure 2 ) . the spectra have been studied without any significant change . however , the results do apply to certain point groups in crystallographic space ( @ xmath17 ##1 . 001 , @ xmath18 ) . the observed point groups are similar to those covered by the original p - n structure , see figure [ fig : 1 ] . oligomers with an even number of phenylene atoms adopt @ xmath19 symmetry . those with an odd number adopt @ xmath20 symmetry . the double - bond lengths vary between about 1 . 380 and about 1 . 400 . figure [ fig : 1 . 001 ] . the si##2 , for the @ xmath21 oligomer is an example . since the shortest possible double bond length in the aromatic ring is 0 . 503 a , they are similar to single bridges . as a result , the carbon atoms of the single bridges do not overlap in the transition state , although this would be surprising . this supports the existence of all the other substituents . in figure [ 1 : 2 ] the ( vibronically excited ) emission spectra of lppp oligomers are shown . the comparison with the emission spectra of the oligomers @ xcite shows some differences , i . e . , they show the typical @ xmath2 transition which is shifted to lower energy with the transition temperature . as one would expect for the @ xmath7 transition , the homo lumo transition is the dominant transition . homo ( lumo ) refers to the lowest energy ( lowest energy ) molecular orbital in the indo ##le state . a more complex transition can be seen in the figure for the oligomers with four and six electrons . it can be referred to as the @ xmath22 transition , because it is located in the transition between the @xmath7 state and the lowest energy state . in the @ xmath8 state the two bonds are broken : the substitution of the homo by the lumo + 1 and the substitution of the homo @ xmath231 by the lumo + 2 . the energy of the @ xmath16 state then shifts to higher positions with higher oligomer energy . this is not apparent in the experimental data because of the second harmonic expansion effect . however , both sets of data show a second transition at approximately 4 . 40 ev which is followed by a transition at approximately 5 . 40 ev for the oligomer . this state will be called the @ xmath15 state , while the @ xmath9 state has a higher level of energy ( i . e . , the ` ` frenkel ' ' state ) , which will become apparent later in the experiment . the @ xmath9 state is described by # # ##al ##g , where low - energy molecular molecular orbitals are substituted for orbitals with higher energy . see figure [ 1 : 3a ] the energy of the two highly excited states is determined as a function of the total number of phenylene atoms in the molecule . thecalculations of the @ xmath7 and the @ xmath8 states show a strong energy difference , whereas the energy of the @ xmath15 states only varies with particle size , in accordance with the experimental data . given this strong difference , a direct comparison with the experimental data for the electron density of @ xcite is not possible , since the energy difference tends to an unphysical expectation value . the main reason for this problem is the absence of the observed effects in the calculations which consider the electronic transitions between the two states of the system . therefore , the governing equations for the transitions to the @ xmath8 and the @ xmath7 states are a combination of the two , which should not be taken for granted at this time . from the moment moment moment of @ xmath24 for the @ xmath2 state , one gets the expression for the radiative potential ##s @ xmath25 for the oligomer , and [ 1 ] @ xmath26 where , @ xmath27 is the electron charge , @ xmath28 is the charge density of the _ _ _ - a state of the @ xmath29 , @ xmath##30 is the planck constant , @ xmath31 is the speed of light , and @ xmath32 is the energy of the molecule , all are expressed in si units . the values @ xmath25 have a linear dependence on the total length of phenylene rings , in table [ fig : 3b ] . however , the value of several hundred ps for the largest oligomers is in reasonable agreement with the observed value of about 100 ps for the smallest , measured from an experimental sample @ xcite . under the assumption of a linear dependence between @ xmath25 and the value of the oligomer observed , one concludes from the table in table [ fig : 3 ] that the value of @ xmath33 corresponds to an optical absorption length of about 15 phenylene rings , in reasonable agreement with the length of the rings measured from the experimental data @ xcite . for this reason the correlation functions for the ground state and the excited state need to be converted to the measured values . the optical absorption of 0 @ xmath34 is related to the frequency part of the optical absorption , as shown by the kubo equation @ xcite @ xmath35 = \frac { { \ rm im \ , } \ , [ \ limits _ { jj } ( \ omega > 0 ) \ , ] } { \ , } \ ; , \ , { 0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath36 is the net energy correlation function , @ xmath37 is , @ xmath38 is the correlation function of the potential , @ xmath39 is the eigenstates with parameters @ xmath40 ( @ xmath41 ) , @ xmath42 , and @ xmath43 of the potential . thus , the energy part of the electrical potential can be written as @ xmath44 = \ frac { \ , } { \ , } \ , \ , _ { \ , | \ phi _ s \ right \ rangle } \ right | \ , \ langle \ , _ 0 \ , | \ begin { \ jmath } \ left | \ phi _ s \ right \ rangle \ , | ^ { \ ; \ , \ { ( \ , - ( e _ s - e _ t ) \ , ) \ ; . \ , { resigmadelta } \ ] ] the correlation function is given by @ xmat##h45 where @ xmath46 , @ xmath47 are capture and decay operators for electrons with spin @ xmath48 in the molecular orbitals @ xmath49 , and @ xmath50 is the identity element of the two two - dimensional matrices . # ( [ resigmadelta ] ) is also obtained . the absorption of a photon with spin @ xmath34 is an interaction of the ground state @ xmath51 and the excited state @ xmath39 with spin @ xmath52 . the energy for this photon , @ xmath53 is the field strength , @ xmath54 . for a detailed analysis of the energy @ xmath55 , the absorption amplitude is given in terms of the decay operators , @ xmath56 which create / lose an electron with spin @ xmath13 and @ xmath57 . from the analysis of the molecular orbitals @ xmath58 one also finds @ xmath59 with @ xmath60 similarly , the energy can be divided into the energy @ xmath61 where the spin - exchange operators @ xmath62 are .consider the comparison of the excited state @ xmath63 and the ground state @ xmath64 with an electron at @ xmath65 and a hole at @ xmath66 ( if @ xmath67 ) . it is now clear that the values @ xmath68 serve to reduce the uncertainty in how far a single excited state @ xmath63 can be interpreted as the electron - hole content of the ground state , and they also satisfy the kubo equation for the electrical potential . note that the definition of ( [ matrix ] ) does not include the direct time dependence of the two - dimensional wave function @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 as in @ xcite or the energy dependent wave function of the ground state as in @ xcite . the basis functions for the energy density , @ xmath69 and ( [ matrixelement ] ) , do not change significantly over long distances . therefore , it is not necessary to use the coarse - grain expression for the electron - hole content of @ xmath39 with respect to @ xmath70 , @ xmath71 where @ xmath72 is the basis function for the ( [) atom @ xmath73 . atom @ xmath74 . @ xmath75 is the energy difference of the atom @ xmath76 and the ground state @ xmath70 with the electron - hole interaction between the atoms of @ xmath74 and @ xmath77 , respectively . formula ( [ 1 ] ) is simple and applicable to all quantum - mechanical systems . it is currently under development for the structural analysis of quantum mechanical systems with the density functional renormalisation group ( dmrg ) and @ xcite . in the following section , the ground state of indo / indo wave function will be discussed in more detail . as shown above , the ground state is expressed as the indo # ##s @ xmath78 \ psi _ { \ sigma } ^ { \ dagger } ( \ vec { x } _ n ) \ ldots \ psi _ { \ sigma } ^ { \ dagger } ( \ vec { x } _ n ) where the atomic orbitals @ xmath79 ( @ xmath80 ) are expressed as a linear combination of the atomic orbitals ( aos ) @ xmath81 @ xmath82the atomic orbitals are based on the hole so that @ xmath83 represents the atomic orbital ( @ xmath84 ) and the hole @ xmath85 . the spin - excited - configuration state functions are given by linear combination of spin - excited configuration state functions [ phicisdef ] @ xmath86 where the numbers @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 correspond to the configuration states of occupied and occupied atomic orbitals , respectively . with these values for @ xmath51 and @ xmath39 , it is assumed that the positions of the two electrons change ( [ amplitude ] ) only in the virtual hole @ xmath89 whereas the rest is represented by the other , virtual holes @ xmath90 , @ xmath91 to perform the calculations , one needs to use the fine - structure approximation @ xmath75 , ( [ amplitude ] ) , @ xmath92 is the hole and the indo ##le @ xcite and the coordinates of the atomic orbitals in the real plane are identical , i . e . , @ xmath93 requires that @ xmath94 = ao ##e , and@ xmath95 are the fourier coefficients of the indo wave function . in this case , one can say that @ xmath96 , if one takes into account the indo approximation and the coefficients of @ xmath97 ##4 ( [ phicisdef ] ) , @ xmath98 # , @ xmath99 can be interpreted as a split wave function for both a hole around the nucleus @ xmath74 and an electron around the nucleus @ xmath77 . this interpretation is not possible with the indo / cis approximation . the question must be asked , whether the coefficients of @ xmath99 are the weights corresponding to aos of @ xmath13 symmetry . it turns out that this number is very large , and one cannot calculate the values of the aos of an electron without additional calculations . one has to assume that the observed electron - hole interactions for the excited state actually result from the electron - hole interaction rather than from a description of the motion of two free electrons relative to a single nucleus . thus , the theory @ xmath100 has been formulated according to the formula ( [ [UNK] ] ) . thus , @ xmath101 is the indowave function where the band is determined by the lumo . this corresponds to the ` ` ` wave - function ' ' ' , i . e . , in a steady state . this # ##al representation has the coefficients @ xmath102 for @ xmath103 , @ xmath104 , and all other coefficients are set to 0 . for the @ xmath99 the standard value @ xmath105 of the size of the electron - hole pair can be obtained with the sum of the two coefficients @ xmath106 the standard value @ xmath107 is not known , @ xmath108 in smaller molecules , the size of the oligomers will increase the size of the electron - hole pair . in larger molecules , if the interaction between hole and electron is constant , @ xmath109 and @ xmath107 will vary with molecular size since the electrons move almost independently of the molecule . on the other hand , the interaction between electron and hole will hold them together at a constant distance even if the size of the molecule varies . so a large electron - hole pair will tend to the standard values of @ xmath109 and @ xmath107 forno solution exists . unfortunately , however , @ xmath109 and @ xmath107 both give useful information about the total energy of the system . they fail to explain the distribution of the electron - hole pair onto regions of the spectrum ; an example of this problem is shown below . in order to get a more accurate representation of the electron - hole distance distribution , one must focus on the corresponding two - dimensional distribution of the chain ; here [ 3 : 4a ] shows how those chains are formed . when @ xmath110 is chosen for this , the corresponding electron - hole pair will have large values on the diagonal of the chain and very small values in the off - diagonal ##s . both choices will lead to the same distribution . the two - dimensional distribution @ xmath110 can be easily transformed into @ xmath111 which is also a function of the electron - hole pair . the substitution of @ xmath112 gives the distribution as a function of @ xmath88 . @ xmath113 is the most accurate representation of the electron - hole pair . the @ xmath114 distribution has been proposed for the molecules , whose energies are of different osci##llator ##ization of the states : the @ xmath7 , the @ xmath8 , and the @ xmath9 states . here , the state @ xmath7 is known . as seen from figure [ fig : 4b ] , a bound pair is formed for the two phenylene rings . in general , the tight binding is possible due to the maximum size of two phenylene rings . for five phenylene rings , see figure [ fig : 4c ] , and other examples , no bound electron - hole pair is formed . the position of @ xmath115 in the spectrum along the three - dimensional axis does not change for systems larger than five phenylene rings . the @ xmath7 state therefore corresponds to a single bound electron - hole pair . figure [ fig : 5a ] shows the measured electron - hole density and the measured standard deviation for the @ xmath7 states as a function of ring size . they exist for more than five phenylene rings , @ xmath116 . this is in good agreement with the measured values of energy loss from electro - optical spectroscopy @ xcite . other aspects of the energy - loss model , like, seems to hint at a very similar behavior of the two states : they are almost expected to increase with the size of the oligomer @ xcite . at present , the reason for this phenomenon is not known . the exponential behavior for @ xmath117 and the relatively low exponential behavior for the standard state @ xmath118 are best explained from the ` ` ' ' ' probability distribution @ xmath119 , , ( [ smoothedp ] ) . as shown in figure [ fig : 5b ] , @ xmath120 , with increasing ring size , the probability distribution increases , and reaches its maximum at @ xmath121 . for oligomers with more and more phenylene , the distribution does not increase much . since at the same time the distribution expands , the values of @ xmath117 and @ xmath122 decrease . the relatively low values of @ xmath122 are due to the formation of the maximum of the distribution at the lower value of @ xmath123 . however , figure [ fig : 5c ] shows the probability distribution @ xmath124 for the same oligomer with five phenyle##ne ##f ( @ xmath125 ) . finally , the question @ xmath8 is answered . brdas and coworkers have identified a state in the optical spectrum of poly - p - phenylene - vinylene ( ppv ) , which they attribute to a charge transfer state . in this case this state is corresponding to an extended electron - hole pair . the energy corresponding to this charge transfer state lies in the same region as the observed population of the photocurrent in the observed optical spectrum . as a result , they conclude that the energy of this state is responsible for this ` ` ' ' ' increase of the photocurrent . the @ xmath8 state predicted by the above equation lies in the same region as the charge - transfer state of ppv , that lies between the @ xmath7 and the high - energy state . the question remains , whether the @ xmath8 state is a charge transfer state or not . as shown in equation [ 5 : 6a ] , the @ xmath8 spectrum has nearly identical values of @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 . no change in these values occurs for the @ xmath125 oligomerwhich occurs at larger scales for larger molecules . this statement , however , is not true . a more detailed look at the results for @ xmath128 as a function of oligomer length , see figure [ fig : 6b ] , and the results for @ xmath129 for the same oligomer , see figure [ fig : 6c ] . the results are essentially the same as for the original @ xmath7 state . for example , compare figure [ fig : 5c ] and [ fig : 6c ] : @ xmath115 and @ xmath129 are both oriented in the off - axis direction . similarly , the results @ xmath128 as a function of oligomer length match those of @ xmath119 , see figure [ fig : 5b ] and [ fig : 6b ] . the only difference to the @ xmath7 state is the distribution of the two to three positions of the electrons in @ xmath8 . because of this , we can also model this state as a ~ elctron - electron , or ~ exciton , and give the explanation for the origin of the photocurrent oflppp of about 1 . 5 ev can be observed at this level of energy . this is in accordance with the fact that the ##ization up to high temperature is the reason for the existence of the photocurrent @ xcite and for the existence of the two stable states . however , for the @ xmath9 state , the initial electron - hole separation does not decrease but increases with increasing temperature , see figure . [ fig : 7a ] . from such an observation one would expect a stable state . on the contrary , for the @ xmath9 state the degree of doping is _ less _ than in the other two stable states , and the electron - hole separation is not confined to a single phenylene atom . as can be seen from the [ fig : 7b ] and [ fig : 7c ] , the apparent lack of doping between @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 points to the fact that the elctron - hole pairs and line pairs cannot be completely independent , i . e . , an exchange interaction can be observed which , however , does not contribute to the separation . as for the states @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 ,there is a distribution of @ xmath132 into off - diagonal regions with different system size , and the smoothed distribution of @ xmath133 is the same distribution as before . so again , the phase transition can be viewed as a single electron - hole pair with different degrees of freedom . they are the basis of the excitons in the structure of dna . in order to reduce the effect to a single ` ` band gap ' ' , the process is repeated for @ xmath101 , and ( [ homolumo ] ) . as mentioned , and illustrated by figures [ fig : 8a ] , [ fig : 8b ] , and [ fig : 8c ] , the distribution of electron and hole in the system is uniform . in contrast to the excitonic model above , the approximately uniform distribution of the average electron - hole density and its variance as a function of system size in figure [ fig : 8a ] is accompanied by the spreading and variance of the probability distribution , @ xmath134 , in figure [ fig : 8b ] . as seen from figure [ fig : 8c ] there is a variation on the off - diagonal part of the probability distribution @xmath135 , which also looks like a perfect circle . therefore , the excitonic effect of the states @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 , and @ xmath9 is significant , and not just a change in the relative behavior of an electron and a hole in a particular region . the excited and ground excited states of the oligomers of lppp have been analyzed with different methods . a direct comparison was made with the atomic absorption spectra , allowing for the determination of the optical properties , and the relative electron - hole interaction . a theoretical analysis of the excited states has been made . as in other spectroscopy methods , the transition of energy between excited states and the ground state with an electron - hole interaction is determined as a function of their relative position in the oligomers . the states with the absorption spectra are considered to be the electron - hole interactions . therefore , a description of the # ##ity of the photocurrent of lppp , can be obtained at this level of the quantum theory . this analysis has been made possible with the help of efforts of dr . frenking , and the financial support of the graduiertenkolleg ` `optoelektronik mesoskopischer halbleiter ' ' as well as the aurc and the marsden laboratory in germany . r . ditchfield , w . j . hehre and j . a . pople , _ j . chem . phys . _ * 56 * , 724 ( 1971 ) . + w . j . hehre , r . ditchfield and j . a . pople , _ j . chem . phys . _ * 56 * , 2257 ( 1972 ) . + p . c . hariharan and j . a . pople , _ theo . * 76 * , 209 ( 1974 ) . + j . a . gordon , _ chem . lett . _ * 34 * , 163 ( 1980 ) . + p . c . hariharan and j . a . pople , _ theo . . acta _ * 29 * , 213 ( 1973 ) . + m . a . petersson , j . hansen , m . a . tensfeldt , m . a . el - laham , m . a . shirley and m . mantzaris , _ j . chem . phys . _ * 29 * , 2193 ( 1988 ) . +##ian ##ni , # d4 ;
