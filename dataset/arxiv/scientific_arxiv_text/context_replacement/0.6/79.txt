the presence of a water film at a fluid - liquid interface affects the behavior of the interface . this is expressed in terms of the surface waves , generated either externally or by internal fluctuations @ xcite . the interface dynamics can be studied by measuring the light scattered by the surface waves ( see the review by earnshaw @ xcite ) . the scattering of light by surface waves is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of water films at fluid interfaces @ xcite , and a number of systems have been successfully studied using this technique ( e . g . reynolds @ xcite , see also the review by smith and others @ xcite ) . recently , the use of water films to study the interface dynamics has been extended to the case in which one of the fluids is a liquid - crystal mixture ( e . g . liquid crystal colloids @ xcite ) . the presence of a liquid crystal in one of the fluids presents the possibility of studying the interface dynamics by measuring the behavior of the surface waves for the following reasons . firstly , there are many types of change in the behavior of the liquid crystal mixture relative to the water . secondly , the interaction withthe resulting film is more stable due to equilibrium forces . however , the resulting film and the electric field generated by the adjacent liquid crystal surface itself exhibit similar properties , even if it appears as a two - dimensional isotropic film on the interface of two liquids . a relatively new method for chemical and biological detection ##s has recently emerged which exploits the phenomenon of surfactant films self - organizing at the interface between water and the nematic liquid crystal . the surfactant film changes the orientation of the nematic director @ xcite . the concentration of chemical and biological molecules in this orientation can then lead to displacement of the nematic director , and detection by the optical sensor @ xcite . with these methods , the resolution is limited to the degree to which it changes the properties of the film with respect to the adjacent liquid crystal surface , significantly . therefore , the equilibrium anchor angle should change over time . the range of applications of these methods could be made much broader , however , if a method was developed that was sensitive to changes in the anchor angle of the interface that did not necessarily result in nematic director changes . for example , the following##ing ##ress will remain . @ xcite , the current flow changes the orientation of the water . if a certain amount of the analyte is present in the water it can be incorporated into the water molecule , since the two molecules possess certain chemical properties . however , this incorporation will result in a change in the elastic and mechanical properties of the water . therefore , experiments which are used to determine the chemical properties can allow for more detailed theoretical insight into the structure of the interface between the water and the analyte than has previously been possible , and the study of surface waves is a useful tool for this purpose . the theoretical study of surface waves at interfaces between nematic and ionic liquids was published first in 1970s @ xcite . the results show that the spectrum of surface waves has a more complex structure than in the ionic liquids , and suggested the use of wave theory to determine properties of nematic liquids @ xcite . since then , many theoretical and experimental contributions have been made , and today these contributions are the subject of investigation @ xcite . the first contribution was a detailed study of the spectrum of the surface waves of a monomolecular organic solution with athe liquid ( e . g . water ) and the nematic solid interface . the four characteristic properties of these interfaces , are ( i ) the elastic effect of the liquid layer , ( ii ) the surface tension of the surface , ( iii ) reduction of the curvature due to diffusion , and ( iv ) the reduction of the surface tension ##ity . we base our model on the continuum model for strongly curved surfaces , rey @ xcite , which takes into account elastic and curvature properties of the surface . we consider the interface of the liquid surface layer that is in the dominant polar orientation ( the three - phase interface ) , and the homeotropic ( parallel to the surface ) orientation of the surface . the model is presented as follows . the mathematical model used in the preparation of the model is drawn up in section [ sec : modes ] . in section [ sec : modes ] the phase relation for surface waves is obtained . in section [ sec : modes ] the exact solution of the phase relation is obtained with different values of the parameters , and the equations for the surface waves are expressed in terms of the surface forcesorientation , and the direction of the magnetic field are given in appendix [ app : orientation ] . the general form of the above equation is given in appendix [ app : orientation ] . in this article we consider the dynamics of the particle - liquid interface between an organic liquid and a nematic liquid crystal , described in the previous section , and write down the following equations . we base our analysis upon the dynamics of the nematic - rich liquid @ rey @ xcite , and the corresponding interface dynamics of the liquids @ xcite and nematic liquid crystals @ xcite . we consider the case when the particle concentration has homeotropic ( close to the equilibrium ) orientation of the nematic director , which is also observed in a mixture of the different phases @ xcite . this case is the easiest to study , and , at the same time , the most suitable for biosensing applications where the small change in particle density may not be easily explained . we consider the applied magnetic field in our model and begin our analysis by studying the part of the magnetic field that does not affect the orientation of the nematic director . we conclude that the orientation is different ##iable from the originaland also in the bulk phase @ xcite and in the nematic phase @ xcite . here we have been treated to the variation of the nematic and bulk order parameters and the fluctuations of order parameters near phase transitions . the bulk phases also exhibit near phase transitions @ xcite , and the value of the surface stress tensor depends upon the orientation of the film . however , this does not have bearing on the physical properties of the transition state compared to the bulk phase @ xcite . in the current paper we assume that the thin film is of the same symmetric phase ( a two - phase system ) . although the symmetry of the film should break in favour of the new one - phase symmetric phase , the system is essentially at equilibrium if the motion of the nematic is homeotropic , and this equilibrium can occur only due to fluctuations of the transfer function . if we neglected the order parameter for the film , the net mechanical contribution to the surface stress tensor would be of higher magnitude in the direction of the film flow than is assumed in our current paper , and these fluctuations can be ignored . we consider the boundary conditions at the interface .nematic and bulk liquids to be both very thin . we assume that the interface interface is thin and flexible . this means that the theory is applicable to systems in which the diffusion of water molecules between the interface and the bulk liquids is slow , and the speed of the diffusion of water molecules is slow compared to that of sound waves . we shall assume the relaxation to be very slow and that the interface is in thermal equilibrium . we shall not consider systems where mechanical forces , such as friction , are present . we shall arrange the interface in such a way that the interface surface is in the plane @ xmath0 , the half - space @ xmath1 is occupied by the uniaxial nematic liquid surface , and the half - space @ xmath2 is occupied by the bulk liquid . the details of the theory presented in the above paper are given in the [ app : table ] . the following equations in the above paper describe the conditions for the balance of forces ( ) . ( [ app : forcebalance ] ) and torque ( ) . ( [ app : torquebalance ] ) at the interface . the general form of these equationsbased upon the underlying experimental data , and the remainder of this section is devoted to some of the equations presented in the previous article . the bulk force balance equation describes the relationship between the surface stress and the bulk stress fields : @ xmath3 , @ xmath4 is the force per unit area generated by the interface , @ xmath5 , @ xmath6 is the force per unit area generated by the interface material , @ xmath7 is the force per unit area generated by the nematic liquid crystal , the expression @ xmath8 indicates that the bulk stress fields in the adjacent liquid , @ xmath9 , and in the nematic , @ xmath10 , are generated at the interface , @ xmath11 is the surface area perpendicular to the interface and extending into the adjacent liquid . the bulk force balance equation can be written as @ xmath12 where @ xmath13 is the bulk stress field due to surface tension , @ xmath14 is the force acting upon the surface of the adjacent nematic liquid crystal . the mathematical expression for surface and bulk stresses and forces that describes the##qs ( [ app : forcebalance ] ) and ( ) . ( [ app : torquebalance ] ) are incorporated into the remainder of this section . in this and the following section we compute the values for the surface stress tensor @ xmath5 and surface torque vector @ xmath13 . we write these values as the sum of the non - dissipative ( elastic ) and dissipative ( plastic ) components : @ xmath15 @ xmath16 to calculate the non - dissipative contributions to the surface stress tensor , @ xmath17 , and surface torque vector , @ xmath18 , we use the differential equation derived by rey @ xcite , which is given below . rey estimates the relationship with the mean free energy per unit volume @ xmath19 of the interface @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 is the bulk energy parameter , @ xmath22 is the most important parameter of the interface ( see also [ app : energy ] ) . the partial equation is written as @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 _ { \ mathbf a , \ mathbf b } \ ] ] is the differentialhere , @ xmath25 is the elastic component of the displacement tensor ( @ xmath26 is the surface tension ) , and @ xmath27 is the elastic moment tensor . the elastic surface tension tensor was identified to be @ xmath28 where the elastic - liquid interaction is given by @ xmath29 @ xmath30 denotes the elastic tensor , @ xmath31 the variational tensor with respect to @ xmath11 . the elastic response to surface tension was identified as @ xmath32 where @ xmath33 is the surface shear tensor , @ xmath34 is the levi - civita tensor , and @ xmath35 is the surface tension tensor . the mechanical properties of interfaces between an elastic solid and a nematic liquid phase were studied in 2010 by rey @ xcite , and the results are presented below . the components and components that contribute to the transfer function @ xmath36 were identified as follows : @ xmath37 where @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 are , respectively , symmetric and antisymmetric components of the elastic surface stress tensor @ xmath40 , @ xmat##h41 and @ xmath42 are the components of the surface normal tensor , polar and normal to the surface , @ xmath43 \ ] ] is the surface rate - of - change tensor ( @ xmath44 is the last term ) , @ xmath45 \ ] ] is the surface vorticity tensor , @ xmath46 is the temperature , @ xmath47 and @ xmath48 are the partial time derivatives of the components @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 of the nematic and of @ xmath51 , polar and normal to the surface , respectively . however , presence of the solvent film at the interface prevents the calculation of the entropy production due to the internal degrees of freedom of the interface , and to the properties of the surrounding nematic surface . therefore , if the solvent film that is in the stationary phase , and the homeotropic phase of the nematic , the internal anisitropic changes in the entropy production are due to the surface properties of higher order than before , and they can be ignored in the final solution . since this is the case weafter this , we shall use the form of the entropy factor ( [ q : entropyproduction ] ) in our equations and consider the application of the entropy factor to the surface stress tensor given by rey @ xcite , which is given by @ xmath52 , \ { { x } \ ] ] where @ xmath53 is the partial jaumann ( corrotational ) derivative @ xcite of the principal component of the stress @ xmath54 , and @ xmath55 , @ xmath56 are two different surface stress tensor . in the first case @ xmath57 , the expression for the surface shear stress tensor corresponds to the surface stress tensor of boussinesq - schriven ##ing | @ xcite with the surface shear stress @ xmath58 given by @ xmath59 and dilatational stress @ xmath60 given by @ xmath61 the surface shear stress , proportional to s . ( [ q : entropyproduction ] ) , is given by @ xcite @ xmath62 where the joint shear force of @ xmath63 and @ xmat##h64 the transport equation @ xmath65 can be expressed in terms of : @ xmath66 . we shall use only the expression for the total free energy : @ xmath67 to obtain : the angular velocity @ xmath68 ( cf . ( [ e : def - xi ] ) ) , the longitudinal component of the normal vector @ xmath69 ( cf . ( [ e : def - xi ] ) ) , and the elastic moment tensor @ xmath70 ( cf . ( [ e : def - xi ] ) ) , we need to consider the dependence of the total free energy @ xmath19 on the area of the surface given by the normal vector @ xmath11 , and on the area given by the moment tensor @ xmath22 . for the values of @ xmath11 and @ xmath22 from x , we can express the free energy in terms of these , and expand the expression . the result can be represented by @ xmath71 instead of the values given above . the expression @ xmath72 refers to the surface tension @ xmath7##3 of the flat interface ( flat surface , the nematic director relative to the interface ) : @ xmath74 the second contribution to the surface free energy density , @ xmath75 , is the energetics of the preferred orientation ##s of the nematic director relative to the interface . for the homeotropic method used , this can be expressed in terms of @ xmath54 as follows : @ xmath76 the formula corresponding to the commonly used rapini - papoular definition of the anchor strength and density @ xcite @ xmath77 shows that these values of the anchor strength coefficient have different meanings : @ xmath78 we shall use @ xmath79 as the anchor strength coefficient to show that it is useful in the context of the homeotropic method being used . the third contribution to the surface free energy density , @ xmath80 , is determined by the film thickness , and is related to the deviation of the orientation of the flat surface from the current preferred ( flat ) orientation . the commonly used form of this formula is the helfrich ##t : @ xcite @ xmath81 . the thickness of the film is defined asthe spontaneous curvature @ xmath82 and the spontaneous curvature @ xmath83 , and the other parameters of the interface are the bending strength @ xmath84 , the saddle - point ( or flat ) curvature @ xmath85 , and the spontaneous curvature @ xmath86 . the curvature @ xmath87 means that the friction coefficient of the solid surface ( @ xmath88 , @ xmath89 ) is zero . to complete the description of the interface , we use the continuity equation for the interface , @ xmath90 . for solid surfaces , the continuity equation is : @ xmath91 we shall apply the description of the effect of the shear forces upon the surface of water , given by buzza @ xcite , to the parameters of the interface ( surface tension @ xmath73 , shear strength @ xmath79 , spontaneous curvature @ xmath84 , saddle - point curvature @ xmath85 , spontaneous curvature @ xmath86 , and surface tension @ xmath66 , @ xmath92 ). for the difference @ xmath93 of the corresponding concentration @ xmath90 from the corresponding concentration @ xmath94 , these values can be written in as @ xmath95 and as for other values . taking surface displacement @ xmath46 as the first constant of the total surface displacement @ xmath96 , @ xmath97 we get from the above equation , . ( [ 2 : 1 ] ) that @ xmath98 this allows us to calculate the interface displacement of the interface . @ xmath99 @ xmath100 @ xmath101 @ xmath102 . these terms @ xmath103 , @ xmath104 , @ xmath105 , @ xmath106 are , respectively , the interface tension , anchor strength , bending radius , and bending curvature of the interface . , @ xmath107 is the interface dilatational tension , @ xmath108 , @ xmath109 , and @ xmath110 are values of the first constant ##s of the form of anchor strength , bending curvature, and sectional curvature in terms of ( @ xmath111 ) . there are maxwell equations for surface tension @ xmath85 and surface tension @ xmath66 , @ xmath92 . the equation @ xmath112 for the polar and nematic liquids has maxwell equations @ xcite @ xmath113 @ xmath114 sectional curvature of the liquid , the equation is : @ xmath115 @ xmath116 where the density of the polar liquid is @ xmath117 where @ xmath118 is the magnetic moment of the polar liquid , the density of the uniaxial nematic liquid crystal is @ xcite @ xmath119 where @ xmath120 is the product of the polar and the surface tension of the nematic : @ xmath121 we know that the polar liquid and the nematic liquid crystal are polar , and that their ##sities @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 , are polar . the maxwell equation for the incompress##ible these equations are also equations @ xcite . they are the continuity equations @ xmath124 and navier - stokes equations @ xmath125 where the shear stress tensor is given by @ xmath126 where @ xmath127 is the surface tension of the bulk fluid , @ xmath128 is the strain rate , @ xmath129 \ ] ] is the strain rate tensor . we have the non - negative initial condition for the behavior of the crystal close to the interface , which is the product of the concentration of liquid , @ xmath46 , and that of the bulk fluid at the interface , @ xmath130 : @ xmath131 to describe the behavior of the nematic liquid crystal that is far from the fluid - nematic equilibrium and is a deviation from the equilibrium constant , we shall use the simplified version of the eriksen - leslie equation @ xcite . the three equations for the ideal nematic liquid crystal are the continuity equation ( [ see : below ] ) , the equation for the pressure @ xmath132 and the equation for the velocity @xmath133 [ @ xmath134 \ ] ] is the antisymmetric vorticity parameter , @ xmath135 is the bulk packing parameter , @ xmath136 the orientational parameter , @ xmath137 is the molecular weight which , takes the shape of the spin ##y surface of a nematic particle , with magnetic field @ xcite @ xmath138 ^ 2 \ \ & + & \ frac { f _ n } ) \ left [ \ mathbf n \ times \ delta ( \ nabla \ times \ mathbf n \ right ) \ right ] ^ 2 - \ frac12 \ chi _ a ( \ mathbf n \ cdot \ boldsymbol { \ mathcal \ } ) ^ 2 , \ { { \ } \ ] ] is the transfer function @ xmath139 where @ xmath140 \ } \ } + \ \ chi _ a \ right \ left [ \ mathbf n _ a \ times \ delta ( \ nabla \ times \ delta \ mathbf n \ right ) \ right ] \ right \ } + \ chi _ b ( \ mathbf n \ cdot \ boldsymbo##l { \ mathcal h } ) \ boldsymbol { \ mathcal h } , \ { { \ } \ ] ] @ xmath141 , @ xmath142 , and @ xmath143 are the stress , twist , and torque , ##en ##l , respectively . the stress tensor can be written as the sum of passive and active ( dissipative ) components , @ xmath144 the active component of the reactive component is @ xmath145 the total elastic stress tensor of the nematic is @ xmath146 the stresses @ xmath147 , @ xmath148 , @ xmath149 , @ xmath136 , and @ xmath135 can be calculated using the commonly used leslie field equation @ xcite . equations that compare @ xmath150 to the total stress tensor @ xmath151 of the original ideal fluid ( see references in ref .

( [ e : fsz ] ) . the resulting displacement law for this case is simply the expression @ xmath251 which describes well - behaved gravity waves @ xcite .in the special case of the wavevectors , the curvature energy is large . application of equations ( [ f : fsz ] ) and ( [ f : tsx ] ) gives the corresponding ranges of @ xmath234 @ xmath252 and @ xmath253 , which we can find in the following : the range of curvature energy @ xmath84 and its dependence with respect to the density , given by @ xmath254 . 0 @ xmath255 , and the range of @ xmath234 in which the density and curvature energy are equal , given by @ xmath256 is very large . for the ranges @ xmath257kg / s @ xmath258 , @ xmath259m / s @ xmath260 , @ xmath261j / s @ xmath260 , @ xmath262j , the expression ( [ f : x - 1 ] ) becomes @ xmath263 @ xmath264 @ xmath265 , which is the range of wavevectors commonly used in light - scattering experiments .to satisfy the conservation law for surface tension at certain values of the wavevector @ xmath234 , the following equations must be solved for . the numerical solution given below uses the above numerical values of the above parameters when it is not possible otherwise . for the nematic equation , we have the solution of : - @ xmath266 - pentyl - 3 - cyanobiphenyl ( 5cb ) = m @ xmath267c @ xcite : the temperature @ xmath268kg / m @ xmath269 , the coupling constant @ xmath270n , @ xmath271n , @ xmath272n , the leslie numbers @ xmath273kg / ( m @ xmath274s ) , @ xmath275kg / ( m @ xmath274s ) , @ xmath276kg / ( m @ xmath274s ) , @ xmath277kg / ( m @ xmath274s ) , @ xmath278kg / ( m @ xmath274s) , @ xmath279kg / ( m @ xmath274s ) . the general equation used in the original paper can be derived from the leslie equation @ xcite and : @ xmath280kg / ( m @ xmath274s ) , @ xmath281kg / ( m @ xmath274s ) , @ xmath282kg / ( m @ xmath274s ) , @ xmath283kg / ( m @ xmath274s ) , @ xmath284 . we use the parameter of the first moment @ xmath285j which is used for thin films @ xcite . for other materials we use the following numerical values : @ xmath286kg / m , @ xmath287 , @ xmath288n / m , @ xmath289n / m , @ xmath290j / m @ xmath291 , @ xmath292j / m @ xmath291 . the constant @ xmath293 for certain material types in terms ofand , obtained by solution of the phase relation ( [ fig : dvert ] ) with the values of the parameters given in the figure .

( [ fig : qg ] ) . comparison of the real ( vertical line ) and imaginary ( horizontal line ) values of the value of the constant , ( as shown on figure [ fig : nogravity ] ) upon the bending moment @ xmath300 , occurs at @ xmath301 @ xmath265 in presence of gravity . this line corresponds to the value of @ xmath300 that in fig .

( [ fig : gravity ] ) ) , upon the pinning strength @ xmath305 , calculated at @ xmath306 @ xmath265 in absence of gravity. ] the second law for the effects produced by relaxation of the nematic director , , @ xmath154 and @ xmath168 , corresponding to relaxation of the nematic director to the interface , obtained by the integration of the second law with the values of the parameters given above , is then given by the equations ( [ fig : omegan ] ) and ( [ fig : n ] ) . however , as the field strength becomes greater , other parameters have to take precedence , as shown in sections [ fig : xanchoring ] and [ fig : yanchoring ] . in this section we show how the two parameters given in section [ fig : h ] are expressed in terms of the external magnetic field applied directly to the interface ( see @ xmath237 above ) . the external magnetic field then acts on the nematic director as an external magnetic force ( see fig . ( [ fig : sec - h ] ) ) , and the net driving force is produced by orientational phase change . thus we can see the effects of the magnetic field are stronger than @ xmath307 because of the real ( straight lines ) and imaginary ( curved lines ) parts of thedependence of the modes 1 and 2 ( as shown on figure [ fig : nogravity ] ) upon the magnetic field , occurs at @ xmath308 @ xmath265 in absence of gravity . the transmission mode goes to @ xmath309 ( see g . ( [ fig : hstar ] ) ) . ] the results of the exact solution of the transmission problem in absence of magnetic field , shown on figure [ fig : gravity ] , show that the variation in frequency of transmission and dilatational modes occurs only at the direction of the field determined by g . ( [ fig : hstar ] ) . the variation due to magnetic field and that determined by gravity is known to be negligibly large . at the @ xmath234 the variation of the transmission mode under the magnetic field is derived from the equation ( [ fig : omegac ] ) and is given by @ xmath310 the variation of this mode is due to the mechanical properties of the liquid , because the nematic liquid has to be transported by the gas rather than to be mixed with the nematic liquid . the main application of this method ., but , not , because at short wavelengths a strong magnetic field is produced , and at long wavelengths it is weak ( ) . ( [ e : omegag ] ) . in addition , the field can also produce electromagnetic waves by changes in the orientation of the director ( e . g . surface tension ) due to the presence of the water . further research is needed to determine the nature of this phenomenon . we have derived the following equation for the surface tension at the liquid - water nematic ##s interface for the case when the water layer has homeotropic ( close to the surface ) orientation of the director , and the water layer is in the same three - dimensional liquid phase . we have derived the second law of the surface tension , in the frequency range , and also in the range of radio frequencies , for the properties of the surface properties . at short wavelengths the combination of shear , dilatational ( thermal relaxation ) , in - plane shear , and elastic surface tension is given by : ( [ e : omegac ] ) ( ( ( [ e : omegag ] ) ) , ( [ e : omegad ]) , ( [ q : omega ] ) , and ( [ q : omegan ] ) , etc . at smaller scales , the result of the same conservation law should be obtained . gravity is the net flow of the wavevectors ( cf . ( [ q : qg ] ) ) , and the effect of gravity can be ignored if wavevector is not too large ( cf . ( [ q : qkappa ] ) ) . for surface modes , the influence of the external magnetic field running parallel to the surface is insignificant . the influence of the magnetic field should be more significant if the direction of the flow does not coincide with the nematic director . in this case the linear relation for surface modes can be considered to be quite different due to nature of the flow in nematic , and the curvature involved . the results of the above method can be also applied to the case of small variations of the magnetic field and to other types of nematic director . more recent developments , which greatly extend the range of the method and applications , include the extension of the method to the range of the thickness of the film thickness , and thedependence of the waves which may be produced by the phase changes between the solvent interface and the liquid crystal . dependence of the surface waves upon the shape of the interface . the surface wave function at the solvent - laden nematic - solvent interface is a useful tool for investigation of the properties of solvent - laden nematic - solvent interfaces , and as a useful tool for a medical or biological research application . we thank prof . j . m . smith for the publication of the paper , and prof . a . j . m . smith for the information on solvent - laden nematic - solvent interfaces which accompany this work . the physical description we present is similar to that of that given by both @ xcite and @ xcite . we define the interface @ xmath0 to coincide with the solvent interface , the half - space @ xmath1 to be filled by the uniaxial nematic liquid crystal , and the half - space @ xmath2 to be filled by the solvent interface . let the position of the charged particle at the interface be @ xmath311 , where @ xmath312 is the position at theundeformed as ( @ xmath0 ) , and @ xmath313 is the displacement vector with sign @ xmath314 . we shall take @ xmath315 and @ xmath316 as the coordinates and write them as @ xmath317 , @ xmath318 and with the letters of form 1 and 2 . the vector @ xmath319 of the surface on the interface in 3d coordinates can be written as @ xmath320 the surface metric basis of @ xmath321 , normal to the corresponding 3d surface , can be written in terms of the components of the displacement vector : @ xmath322 and @ xmath323 the surface metric basis @ xmath324 the tensor @ xmath325 the two reciprocal displacement vectors @ xmath326 and the tensor @ xmath327 together are @ xmath328 @ xmath329 @ xmath330 the normal and reciprocal displacement vectors are @ xmath331 we have the displacement vector @ xmath11 , normal to the interface and transformed into the displacement vector , and @ xmath332 weshall we consider the bulk fluids idem . @ xmath333 the first curvature equation @ xmath334 and the second curvature equation @ xmath335 the surface curvature @ xmath82 and surface curvature @ xmath83 are given by @ xmath336 @ xmath337 other important results are the surface curvature @ xmath54 of the nematic ##al . @ xmath51 , with ( [ e : n ] ) and ( [ e : n0 ] ) , @ xmath338 and the surface curvature @ xmath339 this equation is the solution to the partial differential equation for the bulk fluids , given by kramer @ xcite . integration of q .
