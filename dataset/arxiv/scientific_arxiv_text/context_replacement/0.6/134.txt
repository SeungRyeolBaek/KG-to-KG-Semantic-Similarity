one of the most popular solutions to the same problem is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model @ xcite . in this model there is a single extra dimension compactified space @ xmath1 with the non - factorizable coordinates of @ xmath2 @ xmath3 . @ xmath4 is the extra - dimensional coordinate , and @ xmath5 is the boundary of the @ xmath6 coordinate , @ xmath7 . two branes define the boundary of the extra dimension . one , at @ xmath8 , is called the rs , or ir , brane . the other , at @ xmath9 , is the te , or tev , brane . the @ xmath10 , which is simple in its selection process , avoids the hierarchy of @ xcite . in the original rs model the matter was confined to the rs brane , and the energy confined to the energy @ xcite . it has since been shown that both matter and elementary particles can exist in the universe in a certain way @ xcite . these theories are equivalent , but the effective entropy can be greatly reduced by using electroweak theory . solutions of this problem can be generalized to thenote that the local gauge fields have a contribution to their energy from the local field which does not break the symmetry @ xmath11 . this can be solved by changing the gauge field to @ xmath12 , which greatly breaks the electroweak symmetry @ xcite . the breaking of this new electroweak symmetry occurs in two directions : on the ir brane @ xmath13 ; on the ir brane @ xmath14 , where @ xmath15 breaks the symmetry of the @ xmath16 group . this section describes the breaking of the higgs sector that causes this breaking . we now know what causes the breaking of this brane . on the ir brane the degrees of freedom will have different scale values , so we can fix them . we can now solve the equation with boundary conditions to this effect . this leads to the boundary conditions : @ xmath8 @ xmath17 , @ xmath18 and @ xmath19 and solutions of 5d gauge fields : @ xmath20 , and @ xmath21 . on the tev brane , the coupling ##s have tev values , so we should look at the higgs sector in detail . the gauge field thatto complete the same there is a new higgs that is not bidoublet in @ xmath22 . this leads to the boundary conditions in @ xmath9 @ xmath23 so that in the @ xmath24 limit we have the new higgsless boundary conditions , and this then leads to the higgsless limit in @ xcite . we can use this limit , @ xmath25 to distinguish between the classical limit ( @ xmath26 ) , and the higgsless limit . [ t : wroot ] to work out the new 4d fields , we convert the 5d fields into kaluza ##v ( kk ) fields , @ xmath27 we can then obtain the gauge field wavefunctions by solving the equations of state corresponding to the boundary conditions ( [ q : gaugebcr ] ) and ( [ p : gaugebcrp ] ) . this gives a set of parameters corresponding to the energies of the gauge interactions . the two masses of each of the neutral and spin sectors , correspond to the @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 states . the neutral sector , has a third mass , corresponding to the spin . .[ fig : wroot ] shows the coupling for the @ xmath28 as a function of the parameter @ xmath25 . [ fig : wcoup ] an interesting feature of this model is that the @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 wavefunctions are localized on the same brane , as can be seen by changing the boundary conditions . this suppression occurs for the @ xmath25 . this means that the coupling of the gauge field to the higgs will always be zero . [ fig : wcoup ] shows the coupling of the @ xmath28 to the higgs . for values of @ xmath25 at infinity the lep dependence on the higgs mass will be greatly reduced . ( for large values of @ xmath25 the model is nearly higgsless . ) the second version of this model is more complex . first , the higgs vev has new boundary conditions that allow left and right magnetic moments to have the same mass . however , there are two different degrees of freedom . second , since 5d particles are achiral , ther particles only have one spin , in the parameter @ xmath30 . thethe purpose of this process is to change the direction of the local ##ization mode of the system . by changing this , we can cause the zero mode to be located very near the dark or visible brane , and we can determine the direction of this interaction . this allows us to determine the interaction of the zero mode with the planck brane , and therefore the speed with which the fermion interact with the higgs . in this way the mass of the particles can be broken in order of magnitude from the 5d state . the main problem arises from the @ xmath31 condition which states that , for example , @ xmath32 if broken . this mass hierarchy can be broken by interacting with the particles closer to the planck brane , where the @ xmath31 is broken . for more details , see @ xcite . note that there are high - order corrections to the electroweak observables , derived directly from the kk theory of the gauge interactions . however , the magnitude of these corrections is directly proportional to the mass of the gauge particles . for the first particles observed in @ xcite we have the correct @ xmath33 . there are , however ,for cases like the general case , where the coupling is zero , then a wider range of @ xmath25 should be considered . the most important problem in higgs theory lies in the relation to massless gauge theories , _ i . e . _ particles and fields . the coupling of the higgs to spin glue is mediated by top loops . therefore , in this case the kk can only relate to the higgs . now , suppose that we have replaced the 4d - coupling for the colored states of the wavefunction ##s with the would - be coupling ##s . the 5d - coupling are of order 2 , and the colored states are _ all _ wavefunction ##s . thus there are large contributions to the higgs - spin - spin coupling from the kk family of _ all _ spin states . this leads to an increase in that coupling , as shown in fig . [ 2 : hgg ] . there are large contributions to the higgs - x - ray coupling . the coupling mechanism is more complex , however , since there are large contributions from @ xmath28 top loops , which are involved in the coupling , and the .##ggs coupling to @ xmath28s is broken . we will then look at the suppression of the higgs - mode , as shown in fig . [ 1 : widthbr ] . see in particular the suppression of @ xmath34 over a wide range , and the first detection of @ xmath35 . this is followed by the @ xmath31 mode , which gives a better picture of the @ xmath36 - 1 interaction , and the suppression of the gauge theory interactions . see also the suppression of the @ xmath37 mode . this will make production at the lhc difficult . the loss of the coupling to gauge theory also means that production at the ilc will be reduced , making this higgs a very difficult particle to produce . therefore , it will be difficult to measure the higgs interactions with which to establish a suitable gauge theory for the gauge theory of particle physics , if indeed this is what is known to exist . - m . smith , arxiv : astro - ph / 0505074 . j . randall and j . sundrum , phys . lett . * * * , 3370 ( 1999 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 990##5221 ] . j . a . goldberger and j . a . smith , phys . * 84 * , 4922 ( 1999 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9907447 ] . h . davoudiasl , j . l . hewett and t . g . rizzo , phys . lett . * 84 * , 2080 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9909255 ] . h . davoudiasl , j . l . hewett and t . g . rizzo , phys . b * 473 * , 151 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9911262 ] and phys . b * 84 * , 075004 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0006041 ] ; j . pomarol , phys . b * 486 * , 153 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9911294 ] ; j . grossman and j . neubert , phys . b * 474 * , 361 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 9912408] ; g . gherghetta and g . pomarol , nucl . d * 586 * , 141 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0003129 ] . s . agashe , m . delgado , m . j . garcia and s . sundrum , jhep * 0308 * , 050 ( 2003 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0308036 ] . c . csaki , c . grojean , t . murayama , l . pilo and j . terning , phys . d * 92 * , 055006 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0305237 ] . c . csaki , c . grojean , l . pilo and j . terning , phys . * 70 * , 101802 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0308038 ] . a . cacciapaglia , c . csaki , c . grojean and j . terning , phys . d * 70 * , 075014 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0401160 ] and phys .d * 71 * , 035015 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0409126 ] ; m . cacciapaglia , m . csaki , m . grojean , j . reece and m . terning , arxiv : he - ph / 0505001 . m . nomura , jhep * 0311 * , 050 ( 2003 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0309189 ] . m . barbieri , m . pomarol and m . rattazzi , phys . d * 591 * , 141 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0310285 ] . m . davoudiasl , j . l . hewett , b . smith and t . g . rizzo , phys . d * 71 * , 015006 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0312193 ] and jhep * 0405 * , 015 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : he - ph / 0403300 ] ; j . l . hewett , b . smith and t . g . rizzo ,jhep * 0410 * , 014 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0407059 ] ; s . m . chivukula , r . j . simmons , j . c . smith , t . kurachi and t . tanabashi , phys . b * 70 * , 075008 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0406077 ] and phys . b * 603 * , 210 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0408262 ] . a . birkedal , a . matchev and a . perelstein , phys . * 70 * , 191803 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0412278 ] . j . csaki , j . grojean , j . hubisz , j . shirman and j . terning , phys . d * 70 * , 015012 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : astro - ph / 0310355 ] .
