in this article i will present my recent work together with david dinsdale on the approximate calculation of non - perturbative power corrections for the event shape observables @ xcite . for @ xmath1 event shape _ distributions _ the current collaboration has shown in a recent paper that , if the low - to - medium order ( nlo ) perturbative parameters are calculated using the method of effective charges @ xcite , then we can provide a fit to , without includingany power corrections @ xcite . in particular , based on the combination of the zero - point field theory and the @ xmath2 model with a single choice of renormalization group corresponding to the i . p . group , provide good power corrections @ xmath3 with @ xmath4 . power corrections of this type are also provided by a fit based on standard quantum field theory @ xcite , which is able to fit the data very well in terms of a single parameter . in the current collaboration it is important to consider how to apply the method of effective charges to event shape _ distributions _ rather than to . for an @ xmath1 and @ xmath5 , e . g . , event shape .##servable - charge , thrust - effective charge , @ xmath6 and the r . j . @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 . together with the leading coefficient r , such an r is called the _ effective charge _ . the couplant @ xmath9 satisfy the beta - function equation @ xmath10 , @ xmath11 and @ xmath12 are constant , the leading coefficients @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 , are r - dependent and can be used to solve the equation , along with : ##ity , @ xmath0 @ xcite . the _ effective charge _ @ xmath15 satisfy the equation @ xmath16 this reduces to the beta - function equation # # # where the first - order coefficients are and @ xmath17 , the beta - function coefficients in this equation are the r - dependent ##s @ xmath18 , . ( 1 ) for @ xmath19 can be shown to be @ xmath20 + \ int _ { r } ^ { { \ cal { q } } ( x ) } { dx } \ to [ \ frac { q } { \2 ( x ) } + \ frac { 1 } { { 1 } ^ { 2 } ( x + 2 ) } \ { ] \ ; . \ ] ] the dimensionful constant @ xmath21 acts as a unit of integration . it is related to the # ##ful constant @ xmath22 by the following expression , @ xmath23 combines @ xmath24 with @ xmath25 , creating the nlo perturbative constant . fig . ( 4 ) can be converted into the parameter @ xmath26 the above expression reduces to the original expression for @ xmath0 . here @ xmath27 is the _ x _ of @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 is @ xmath30 . @ xmath31 is the nnlo ech ##1 - 1 . if only the nlo conversion is performed , as is the case for @ xmath1 - observables , then @ xmath32 , and @ xmath33 etc . ( 5 ) can be used to convert the original expression for the parameter @ xmath15 into the expression of @ xmath34 bin - bin - bin. . an analysis was carried out in 2006 . @ xcite for a number of @ xmath1 - independent observables , including light and heavy ions , which we shall focus on here . it was found that the initial @ xmath0 model has a nearly linear distribution , apart from the one - thrust prediction , and the prediction of @ xmath35 where the nlo coefficient of is . the result for two - thrust and for hadronization , is shown in fig . 2 . another way of describing the initial model , is the use of ` ` ' renormalization group ' ' ' ( ' ) @ xcite . one can write the nlo of @ xmath36 as @ xmath37 . one can write rs - invariant @ xmath38 - logs and rs - invariant ` ` ' ' ' as @ xmath6 - logs . the coefficients are written as @ xmath39 . @ xmath40 is the nlo coefficient of @ xmath39 , coefficients of @ xmath41 are ` ` rs - invariant ' ' . one then writes @ xmath42 as @ xmath43 . @ xmath6 - logs ,and these are in the @ xmath44 . the @ xmath6 - dependence of @ xmath5 _ arises only from the rs - dependence of @ xmath45 . however , if we assume that @ xmath38 has a rs _ dependence of @ xmath6 _ the resulting @ xmath6 - log is in the ` ` and ' ' of @ xmath6 - dependence of @ xmath43 . # ##ity dependence arises only if we resum these @ xmath6 - logs to _ alpha - r _ . for all the nlo result , and assuming for all that that we construct a new alpha - r - function @ xmath46 so that @ xmath47 the rs - dependent result will be @ xmath48 in the following step one writes @ xmath49 \ nonumber \ \ & = & / / [ { \ ln } ( 1 / { \ n } _ { \ cal { 1 } } ) . \ { { 1 } \ ] ] the @ xmath38 - logs ` ` cancel themselves ' ' and one looks at the nlo ech of @ xmath50 . + and weas above , @ xcite , application of nlo in charge distribution theory ( renormalization group of ( rgi ) field theory ) leads to the results for @ xmath1 event shape _ means _ associated with the above model , as shown in figure 1 . retrieved from ref . @ xcite . from this , it would be possible to extend the effective charge method to event shape _ means _ . it is also assumed that the definition of effective charge is restricted to those values which exist at different scales . thus for the on @ xmath51 and off @ xmath52 , it can also be written as @ xmath53 . the @ xmath54 are _ dimensionless _ quantities that can be assumed constant , allowing the @ xmath55 value of @ xmath15 to be expressed as : . in the 2 - jet region for @ xmath1 observables , values @ xmath56 exist and need to be resummed to higher - dimensions . the corresponding values for the ( @ xmath57 ) and 2 - jet region ( @ xmath58 ) are _ kinematical _ , @ .##math59 , where @ xmath60 . @ xmath61 , @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , are leading terms , second - to - last terms , etc . for jet and liquid - metal , the term _ exponentiate _ @ xcite @ xmath64 . @ xmath65 contains the ll and @ xmath66 the nll . @ xmath67 is part of @ xmath68 , and @ xmath69 contains terms that appear in @ xmath70 . it is common to choose the effective charge @ xmath71 so that @ xmath72 this effective charge will have the expansion @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 , and the corresponding terms @ xmath75 have the expansion @ xmath76 . one resums these coefficients to sub - terms in the following closed - form expressions for @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 , where @ xmath79 is taken to be the @ xmath80 term with the ` ` ' ' ' energy term @ xmath25 ( @xmath80ps ) . so we have to resum ##mit to all - orders in the @ xmath81 scheme ( ech ) . the computation of the @ xmath82 rs - invariant ( fig . ( 4 ) ) shows that the @ xmath82 has the form @ xmath83 we can then compute all - orders rs - invariant @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 corresponding to @ xmath81 , @ xmath84 the resummed @ xmath85 can then be used to compute for @ xmath86 by copying it into fig . ( 5 ) . note that since @ xmath21 is the _ real _ part of @ xmath87 there is no such function as in the original @ xmath2ps scheme . the resummed @ xmath88 can then then be computed for @ xmath89 with @ xmath79 , so that @ xmath90 . the same procedure with @ xmath91 works for @ xmath92 , although in this case one has to use @ x##math93 terms , e . g . the @ xmath94 term which would not be found in @ xmath31 . this can be done by simply calculating the @ xmath95 with @ xmath96 terms . + . we have shown the main advantage of the universal ##ization method is that it resums to many - hundreds _ of - fixed _ values of the first - order result , whereas the nlo ech result ( in @ xmath97 for example ) corresponds to the rs - invariant resummation ( r . i . s . ( 2 ) . ) @ xmath98 ##1 . for fixed - values without the resummation of large logs in @ xmath81 rs _ invariant _ resummation of large logs is always possible . thus we can see that the ll ech result is an nll independent of the limit @ xmath80ps result . + in figure 1 we see the nlo results . note that the liquid curve , which corresponds to the exponentiated nlo ech result , is a very good approximation even in the two - dimensional case , whereas the liquid curve which represents the nlo @ xmath2pstherefore , is a slightly different result . the higher - order of resummation of the data in fig . ( 2 ) is a large heavy - jet effect . figure 4 shows that the nll @ xmath80ps derives ` ` ' ' ' from the ll ech data by re - fitting it to the @ xmath2ps and is in perfect agreement with the two coeffiecients corresponding to it ( @ xmath99 ) . we can refer to data obtained from @ xmath34 and the size of power corrections @ xmath3 from the data . to do this we consider the fact that size of power corrections actually affects the observed free space , which can be explained by using different types of hadronization , or by the renormalon effect @ xcite . once we extract @ xmath100 this new data was then compared to the data for 1 - thrust and heavy jet mass . @ xmath1 fits in the c . i . t range from @ xmath101 gev were obtained ( see @ xcite for the full list of fits ) . the same data for 2 - thrust and heavy - jet mass are shown in figures 5 . and 6 . . + theech values for light and heavy jet mass show some variation , from nlo to ll to nll , probably because at each stage the charge resummation of the system is also performed . the power reductions obtained with ech are somewhat larger than those obtained with @ xmath80ps , but we did not find a similar power reduction as we found for the latter . this may be because their use matches the results for heavy jet mass , which we have obtained . the mean value of @ xmath34 for ech is somewhat smaller than that obtained with @ xmath80ps , ( @ xmath102 ( thrust ) and @ xmath103 ( bottom - jet mass ) ) . these mean values are obtained with the direct charge efficiency ( dge ) of @ xcite . the problem with the automatic charge resummations is that the @ xmath81 function has a branch cut which limits how far into the l - log log it can go . we have referred to @ xmath104 in the analysis we have done . this branch cut has a similar branch cut in the resummed @ xmath105 function . however , @ xmath106for @ xmath107 the scattering coefficient @ xmath108 increases and the effective charge distribution goes down . we need to apply the results to @ xmath109 . from the ` ` meta - analysis ' ' , we can see that these results would not be useful for the nnll @ xmath80ps resummation . we will be able to explore this further when a solution for @ xmath110 becomes available . quantum driven processes have also been described in detail by @ @ xcite . for example , she provided a description of the pdf ##s and the scattering cross - section , @ xmath111 there is no way to directly relate these processes to effective charge . the scattering cross - section would depend on the _ energy scale _ @ xmath112 , and _ renormalization factor @ xmath38 _ nlo . in addition we could use unphysical ##ly - dependent @ xmath113 and @ xmath114 , and - dependent @ xmath6 - log , and then apply year - round resummation of the @ xmath112 and @ xmath38 - logs to ` `by itself ' ' . the method of corrections is much more complicated than the normal method for the positive energy means , and a mathematical model for it has not been found so far . alternatively one can use the method of mass balance ( ps ) @ xcite , and for the event shape means @ xmath115 and for the corresponding saddle point in the @ xmath116 plane @ xcite . it follows that there are large values of the nlo values for proton and neutron decay subprocesses . one can choose between two methods , @ xmath117 where one finds a saddle point in the @ xmath116 plane for the case of parton subprocesses , and @ xmath118 where one uses the energy means @ xmath119 and @ xmath120 and finds a saddle point in @ xmath121 . @ xmath117 gives power corrections , compared to @ xmath80ps with @ xmath122 . @ xmath118 in turn gives much larger power corrections . this is shown in figure 1 for the case of the event shape means . for the case of nlo .further - corrections should be made _ _ _ for the @ xmath123 and @ xmath124 - based subprocesses , and finally @ xmath118 which also fits the model perfectly , seems to be correct . this also means that @ xmath1 shape is well - fit in nlo - theory to the effective charge model , without large power corrections being required . with the new @ xmath80ps ##v , and @ xmath125 is compatible with @ xmath126 gev . very large power corrections are required for the calculation of e . @ xcite . it would be possible to modify this model so that the perturbative model fits the effective charge model , but this has not been done . we show how resummation of large distributions of the effective charge wave - function @ xmath127 could be carried out for @ xmath1 - shape distrtibutions . if the distributions are given by the exponentiated effective charge , then in nlo theory simple resummation of the distributions is possible . as shown in figure 1 this results in good fit to the two - dimensional model , with thevalues in the 2 - jet region in good agreement with the data . in addition the @ xmath80ps result has a poorly defined peak in the 2 - jet region , and is well below the value for the actual value of @ xmath128 mev values . we also found in figure 3 that the ll ech result contains quite a large part of the nll @ xmath80ps result . we found out that @ xmath127 lacked a branch point like that of the resummed @ xmath77 result . this was the best that we could make . we looked for power correction and @ xmath34 to the 2 - jet mass and 2 - jet mass data , with much better power corrections for the ech data compared to @ xmath80ps , with power corrections going from nlo to ll to nll . the results of the ` ` n - model ' ' result in figure 3 would suggest that the nll ech result contains a large part of the nnll @ xmath80ps result . this suggests that the branch point , which has the ability to match the 2 - jet result , would also show up in the nnll result . thiscan be found if the @ xmath129 * is available . the work on energy driven processes in physics was well reviewed and continues to show that significant low energy losses are achieved when a highly efficient transfer function is used . yasaman farzan and the members of the organizing committee of the ipm lph -
