let us start with the following examples : 1 . for the differential graded algebra @ xmath1 , the hochschild cohomology @ xmath2 has a gerstenhaber algebra structure . 2 . let @ xmath3 be a manifold , either @ xmath4 - or @ xmath0 - or , @ xmath5 be the associated metric space . similarly , @ xmath6 has a batalin - vilkovisky ( in fact , gerstenhaber ) algebra structure . 3 . let @ xmath7 be the differential graded algebra of differential forms , @ xmath3 . there is a linear combination @ xmath8 given by the algebra of differential forms , which satisfy the gerstenhaber identity . \ ( a ) is also due to gerstenhaber @ xcite . ( b ) is due to chas - simon @ xcite , which wrote the very first book on representation theory . ( c ) relates the differential construction ( b ) to the algebraic construction ( a ) . it follows that ( a ) is not well - known to us ( see also [ 150205 _ 1 ] ) . ( b ) ( c ) relates these structures .in theory , and it is an important and difficult problem to construct chain level models of these structures . for ( a ) , something called deligne s conjecture states that the closed chain model of the unit ##al operad depends on the hochschild cochain structure . many other solutions to this problem and its consequences are known ; see @ xcite part 2 section 13 . 1 , @ xcite section 2 . 19 . 1 , and the articles below . the goal of this problem is to construct a chain level model structure which is ( a ) ( the batalin - vilkovisky ( bv ) chain model of algebraic geometry ) , and combine it with the solution to deligne s conjecture via a chain map which is a chain level model of ( a ) . let us first explain our main problem ( see # [ 150628 _ 1 ] for the full proof ) . first of all , for a simple , over @ xmath0 - over @ xmath3 , we define a chain map @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 , which is a chain model of @ xmath11 . we then define a - over operad @ xmath12 and a suboperad@ xmath13 . these operads are chain models of the two big circles operad and the great circle operad , and exist independently from @ xmath3 . we have the following properties : 1 . for any closed operator on @ xmath1 , the hochschild complex @ xmath14 admits an action of @ xmath13 , which preserves the gerstenhaber action of @ xmath15 in ( a ) . 2 . for any closed , connected @ xmath0 - connected @ xmath3 , the hilbert complex @ xmath9 admits an action of @ xmath12 , with @ xmath16 preserving the bv structure ##s . there is an action @ xmath17 preserving the bv structure . 3 . there is an @ xmath18 - equivariant action of @ xmath19 , such that @ xmath20 preserves the action in ( a ) . there can be several different ways to carry out chain model problems in string theory , based on properties of chain models of the real vector space . the simplest chain model avoids the transversality problem , because the closure ##s are mapped differently for each model to the other .the hochschild model of modular geometry ( as e . g . , @ xcite ) avoids this problem , but it is not necessarily a complete chain model of the real field theory ( see remark [ 150811 _ 1 ] ) , and has some important properties ( e . g . number of terms , see section 1 . 11 . 2 ) . our chain model @ xmath9 is an exact combination of these two . this section is organized as follows . in section 1 . 11 . 3 , we state the main results and applications , using the types and symbols . in section 1 . 4 , we give remark [ 150628 _ 1 ] , which is our main result , and a few other results . section 1 . 6 discusses other results and 1 . 7 discusses some applications to symplectic geometry . section 1 . 2 describes the structure of the rest of this section . here we will give the definition of ( nonsymmetric ) operads . the second idea is to use @ , and we use @ xcite as of section 1 . 1 for example . let @ xmath21 be a real monoidal space with a multiplication @ xmath22 and a division @ xmath23 . @ _ nonsymmetricoperad _ @ xmath24 _ @ xmath21 consists of the following properties : * an object @ xmath25 for every element @ xmath26 . * a morphism @ xmath27 for every @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 . these morphisms are called _ ( _ ) objects _ . * a morphism @ xmath30 is an _ object _ of @ xmath24 . we know that groups have associativity , and @ xmath31 is a four - dimensional cube for example . when @ xmath25 is a group action of the symmetric group @ xmath32 ( @ xmath33 is the group action ) for every @ xmath26 , such that these actions are compatible with groups , @ xmath24 is called an _ operad _ object @ xmath21 . for every ( nonsymmetric ) operads @ xmath24 and @ xmath34 , a morphism of ( nonsymmetric ) operads @ xmath35 is a family of morphisms @ xmath36 which satisfy the above properties . when @ xmath37 is monics forfrom @ xmath26 , we see that @ xmath24 is a suboperad of @ xmath34 . in this paper , graded vector spaces are defined over @ xmath10 . a graded vector space @ xmath38 is a sequence @ xmath39 of vector spaces . a double graded ( or chain ) vector space ( or vector space ) is a sequence @ xmath40 of a graded vector space @ xmath38 and @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 . we may define a graded vector space as a graded vector space with @ xmath43 . we may define the following monoidal sequence for the category of graded vector spaces as follows : @ xmath44 the sequence @ xmath45 is defined over @ xmath46 and @ xmath43 . in this paper , we will focus on the category of graded and chain vector spaces . operads in these categories are called _ graded operads _ and _ graded operads _ , respectively . for any graded vector spaces @ xmath38 and @ xmath47 , @ xmath48 has the structure of a graded vector space : @ xmath49 for .1 - in @ xmath38 , @ xmath50 has the structure of a graded operad , as follows ( @ xmath51 , @ xmath52 , and @ xmath53 ) : @ xmath54 this graded operad is called the _ endomorphism operad _ of @ xmath38 . for any graded operad @ xmath24 , a graded @ xmath24 - algebra is a chain complex @ xmath38 with a morphism @ xmath55 of the operads . for any @ xmath26 we have a chain map @ xmath56 for any graded @ xmath24 - algebra @ xmath38 and @ xmath47 , a chain complex @ xmath57 is called a morphism of graded @ xmath24 - algebra if @ xmath58 for any @ xmath59 and @ xmath60 . for any graded operad @ xmath24 , the structure of graded @ xmath24 - algebra and their morphisms are defined in a similar way . for any graded operad @ xmath61, the _ _ sequence _ of @ xmath24 is a sequence @ xmath62 such that the following conditions hold : * for any @ xmath26 , @ xmath63 is a free subcomplex of @ xmath25 , which is generated by the @ xmath32 - operation on @ xmath25 . * for any @ xmath59 , @ xmath64 and @ xmath28 , @ xmath65 for any graded sequence @ xmath66 , the sequence @ xmath67 has the internal structure of a graded operad , and there is a free morphism of graded operads @ xmath68 . for any graded operad @ xmath24 , the set of associated graded ideals and associated associated graded operads are defined in the following section ( see @ xcite section 13 . 2 . 1 ) . gerstenhaber and bv operads are graded operads , which play important roles in this section . we provide examples of these operads by definitions and operations , as in @ xcite sections 13 . 2 . 12 and 13 . 3 . 13 . the _ gerstenhaberoperad _ @ xmath69 is generated by @ xmath70 , @ xmath71 , @ xmath72 with the following relations : 1 . @ xmath73 . 2 . @ xmath74 . 3 . @ xmath75 . 4 . @ xmath76 , @ xmath77 . more precisely , we define the free operad @ xmath78 ( see @ xcite ##d ##1 . 2 ) generated by @ xmath79 , @ xmath80 , @ xmath81 , and the free module @ xmath82 generated by _ ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) . then , we define @ xmath83 . for the free @ xmath69 - module @ xmath38 , we define _ @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 , @ xmath38 and @ xmath86 . , @ xmath87 is a graded algebra , lie algebra , and @ xmath88 is a graded lie algebra ( with dimension equal to @ xmath89 ) . thethus @ xmath90 is called a _ gerstenhaber algebra _ . by the above definition , the gerstenhaber algebra @ xmath38 is a unit @ xmath91 of the algebra @ xmath84 . it follows that the existence of a unit is also not true . the _ bv operad _ @ xmath92 is recovered by @ xmath93 , @ xmath94 , @ xmath95 , @ xmath96 with the elements ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and @ xmath97 together , there is a linear morphism of such operads @ xmath98 . for any multiplication @ xmath92 - 1 @ xmath38 , we replace the elements @ xmath99 and @ xmath38 by @ xmath100 . the algebra @ xmath101 is called a _ bv algebra _ . the algebra @ xmath85 is recovered by the multiplication @ xmath102 . for any algebra @ xmath103 , let @ xmath104 be the set of tuples @ xmath##105 states that * for every @ xmath106 , @ xmath107 is a finite set of finite points contained in @ xmath108 . we denote its center by @ xmath109 . @ xmath110 is a point of @ xmath111 . * @ xmath112 is empty . the space @ xmath104 has the natural structure . let @ xmath113 be the center of @ xmath104 , which consists of @ xmath105 such that @ xmath114 for every @ xmath106 . we use @ xmath115 to denote the unique center of this point . thus , @ xmath116 has the natural structure of a regular operad , and @ xmath117 is a suboperad . @ xmath118 ( resp . @ xmath119 ) is called the _ _ disks _ ( resp . _ _ _ disks _ ) operad . there are examples of the operads @ xmath120 ( @ xcite ) and @ xmath121 ( @ xcite ) , which aretogether with the linear map . a _ differential graded - algebra _ is a graded vector space @ xmath1 with a units @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 , which is compact , and satisfy the product rule . we can say that it has a degree @ xmath124 . we use the notation ` ` differential graded - algebra ' ' or ` ` dga algebra ' ' . here the notation ` ` d ' ' stands for ` ` algebra ' ' , not for ' ( ) @ xcite pp . let @ xmath1 be a dga algebra . a _ @ xmath125 - bimodule is a graded vector space @ xmath3 with units @ xmath122 left and right @ xmath125 - and @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 , which satisfy the product rule and associativity . for units @ xmath128 and @ xmath129 , we define the linear map @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 we define @ xmath##132 define @ xmath133 , and define the hochschild cochain of @ xmath134 and @ xmath135 . note that @ xmath136 _ is _ the index of @ xmath89 . the cohomology of this complex is defined by @ xmath137 , and define the _ hochschild cohomology _ . note that @ xmath1 itself has the natural structure of a - @ xmath125 - bimodule . @ xmath138 has both dga and matrix - like structures , with the @ xmath139 and @ xmath85 listed below . the bracket @ xmath139 is defined as @ xmath140 the bracket @ xmath141 is defined as @ xmath142 where @ xmath143 is defined as @ xmath144 the brackets @ xmath139 and @ xmath141 represent the gerstenhaber action on @ xmath2 . this action is also equivalent to gerstenhaber @ xcite . in this section , we define @ xmath145 . then @ xmat##h3 is the compact , connected @ xmath0 - topology of the @ xmath4 . @ xmath5 is associated with the @ xmath0 - topology . we often refer @ xmath146 to @ xmath147 . however , we often use the notation @ xmath148 . in @ xcite , chas - simon defined the _ topology and _ map @ xmath149 . let us first consider the definition . let us consider the evalutation of @ xmath150 , and the inner product @ xmath151 let @ xmath152 be the thom neighborhood of @ xmath153 , and @ xmath154 be the thom neighborhood . the gysin map @ xmath155 is defined as the intersection of the following maps : @ xmath156 let @ xmath157 be the thom map . formally , it is defined as : ( recall the definition in pp . 780 @ xcite ) . let us consider the [ @ xmath158 - map @ xmath159 \ to [ 0 , 1 ] $ ] such that @ xmath16##0 and @ xmath161 ( @ xmath162 is the @ xmath163 - 1 term ) for each @ xmath164 . therefore , @ xmath157 is defined as @ xmath165 it is easy to see that @ xmath166 does not depend on values of @ xmath167 . the product of @ xmath168 is defined as the product of the following two maps . the first map is the intersection product and the second map is the gysin product . @ xmath169 ^ - { \ , } & \ _ { * + r } ( \ , ^ { \ , r } ) \ ar [ r ] & \ h _ * ( \ , { \ , _ { e } \ ! \ ! \ , _ { e } } \ , ) \ ar [ r ] ^ - { \ , _ * ( r ) } & \ , _ * ( \ r ) . } \ ] ] let us define the product @ xmath170 . let @ xmath171 be the intersection product . then , @ xmath172 on the other hand , @ xmath147 is a product@ xmath173 - manifold @ xmath174 , which is represented by @ xmath175 . we have @ xmath176 [ @ xmath177 \ ( x ) $ ] , where @ xmath178 \ times x _ [ ( x ^ 2 ) $ ] is represented by the symbol [ @ xmath179 $ ] ( see the previous section for the definition of @ xmath180 ) . [ th : ch - su ] for a compact , compact @ xmath4 - manifold @ xmath158 - manifold @ xmath3 , @ xmath181 has a bv structure . this algebra is the starting point of loop theory . the loop @ xmath85 of this bv structure is called the _ _ _ _ . there is a relation between gerstenhaber algebra , k - theory ( = [ th : ch - su ] ) and hochschild cohomology ( theorem 2 . 1 ) . we obtain this relation via the integral of differential forms , which follows from @ xcite . to obtain the integral of differential forms , it is necessary to start with @ xmath0- # ##ity graph @ xmath146 . let us consider the @ xmath182 - dimensional spaces @ xmath183 and @ xmath184 . map @ xmath185 is said to be of class @ xmath0 , if there is an open neighborhood @ xmath152 of @ xmath186 and a neighborhood @ xmath187 , such that @ xmath188 , and @ xmath189 are of class @ xmath0 . let @ xmath190 be the @ xmath10 - dimensional space spanned by the @ xmath0 - map @ xmath191 . it is easy to see that , the @ xmath0 - map @ xmath192 is unique with respect to the @ xmath0 - map of @ xmath146 . therefore , @ xmath193 is a subcomplex of the singular ##ity graph of @ xmath146 . in figure 2 , we see that this unique map is a self - map ( see [ 150219 _ 1 ] ) . hence , @ xmath194 . for example @ xmath##195 , let us define @ xmath196 . , @ xmath197 is a dga map , where @ xmath4 denotes the outer product , and @ xmath198 denotes the inner product . we denote it by @ xmath7 . we define a new @ xmath199 - bimodule , [ @ xmath200 _ * : = \ hom ( { { \ mathcal { d } } } ^ { * + 1 } ( x ) , \ beta ) $ ] as follows : @ xmath201 - morphism of @ xmath7 - bimodules @ xmath202 ; \ , \ , \ mapsto ( \ , \ mapsto \ int _ { \ , \ , \ beta ) $ ] is a cross - product ( this is an immediate consequence of the poincar theorem ) . for each @ xmath0 - pair @ xmath203 and @ xmath129 , we have @ xmath204 ; @ xmath205 and ( @ xmath206 ) $ ] for @ xmath207 it is easy to see that @xmath208 ) ; \ quad \ quad \ mapsto ( [ _ ( ( \ quad ) ) _ n \ ] ] is the identity matrix ( these are given in section 1 . 2 ) . using this , we have [ ( @ xmath209 ) \ cong . ^ * ( { { \ mathcal { a } } } _ m , { { \ mathcal { b } } } _ n ) . \ ] ] this also preserves the gerstenhaber structure of @ xmath210 and @ xmath211 . [ 150205 _ 01 ] the fact that ( [ 141218 _ 01 ] ) preserves the gerstenhaber structure remains to be seen ; see @ xcite for the product , and @ xcite _ 1 for the sum . we can see this result as a consequence of theorem [ 150628 _ 1 ] , see theorem [ 150703 _ 1 ] . we have our main result , [ 150628 _ 1 ] and some other results . let us use the notation : @ xmath69 and @ xmath92 are the gerstenhaber and bv operads . for example @ xmath0 - 1 @ x##math3 of spaces @ xmath4 , @ xmath5 , and @ xmath212 . @ xmath7 is the dga algebra of linear operators on @ xmath3 . [ 150628 _ 1 ] there exists a single operad @ xmath12 and a suboperad @ xmath13 , satisfying the following conditions . 1 . there exist copies of the operads @ xmath213 and @ xmath214 , such that the linear map is : @ xmath215 \ ar [ d ] _ - { \ cong } & [ _ * ( \ \ - { \ cong } ) \ ar [ d ] ^ - { \ cong } \ \ \ ger \ ar [ d ] & \ batvil . } \ ] ] 2 . for any dga on @ xmath1 , the hochschild space @ xmath138 has a compact @ xmath13 - manifold structure , which is the gerstenhaber algebra of @ xmath2 . 3 . for any compact , connected @ xmath0 - manifold @ xmath3 , there exists : * * * @ x##math12 - algebra @ xmath9 . * an element @ xmath216 of bv ##2 . * a morphism of elements @ xmath13 - algebra @ xmath19 such that @ xmath20 is equivalent to the map ( [ 141218 _ 01 ] ) . [ 150212 _ 1 ] it follows that ( although there are some technical issues the author has not addressed ) the following extended version of ( 1 ) is also true : there is a hi - algebra of quiasi - algebra ( of chain operads ) , @ xmath13 ( resp . @ xmath12 ) and @ xmath217 ( resp . @ xmath218 ) , which is the left chain operad of @ xmath118 ( resp . @ xmath119 ) . [ 150703 _ 1 ] since @ xmath219 is the product of the @ xmath13 - algebra , and @ xmath214 , ( b ) - ( c ) such that the map ( [ 141218 _ 01 ] ) is the gerstenhaber identity . [ 1508##11 _ 01 ] . ( b ) - ( c ) follows , the hilbert space @ xmath9 is a ` ` ' extension ' ' of the hochschild complex @ xmath220 . the important fact is that the map @ xmath221 holds for the locally compact @ xmath3 , and we make some assumptions ( e . g . @ xmath222 ) to show that the map ( [ 141218 _ 01 ] ) is an extension . as the last example suggests , we can define chain , loop , and operators on @ xmath9 . [ 150801 _ 01 ] the loop product @ xmath84 and the loop product @ xmath85 / @ xmath223 correspond to operators on @ xmath9 , denoted by the same symbol . @ xmath84 defines a dga algebra structure , @ xmath85 defines a compact lie algebra structure on @ xmath9 , and the chain map @ xmath224 preserves these structures . moreover , there is an injective chain map @ xmath225 such that @ xmath226 and the following formula shows : @ xmath##227 ^ - { \ h _ * ( i _ m ) } \ ar [ r ] _ { \ cong } & \ h _ * ( { { \ mathcal { l } } } } ) \ ar [ r ] ^ { \ cong } \ \ c ^ { - * } _ \ dr ( r ) \ ar [ r ] _ { i _ * ( \ h _ m ) } & i _ * ( d ^ { { { \ mathcal { l } } } } } ) . } \ ] ] as a result , one can define @ xmath228 - structure of the tensor algebra . similarly , by the homotopy equivalence theorem ( see section 2 . 2 @ xcite ) , one can define the @ xmath228 - structure @ xmath229 and @ xmath223 , so that @ xmath230 , @ xmath231 and @ xmath232 are homotopy equivalent to the dga of @ xmath233 . similarly , we can define @ xmath229 so that @ xmath234 for example @ xmath128 , and @ xmath235 are homotop##y corresponds to the dga of @ xmath236 . in particular , @ xmath229 is the dual massey algebra of @ xmath237 . in this way , we can define the @ xmath238 - structures @ xmath239 and @ xmath223 , so that @ xmath240 , @ xmath241 , and @ xmath242 are homotopy equivalent to the k - structure @ xmath243 . similarly , we can define @ xmath239 so that @ xmath244 for any @ xmath128 . when @ xmath3 has a length metric , @ xmath223 is associated with the length metric , and it is assumed by @ xcite that the network topology preserves this metric . one of properties of our chain model @ xmath9 is that , we can define the length metric of this chain model so that the length is preserved by the topology on . for any @ xmath245 , let x = @ xmath246 . for any @ xmath247 $ ] , we define @ x##math248 . in mathematics , a family ( denoted [ @ xmath249 $ ] ) of the chain complex @ xmath250 is a family @ xmath251 } $ ] of subcomplexes of @ xmath250 , such that @ xmath252 . for any @ xmath253 , we have @ xmath254 .

[UNK] ) of @ xmath223 described in section 2 . 1 . 2 . on the other hand , fukaya @ xcite studied chain level loop bracket for compactifications of the vector spaces of non - holomorphic functions with lagrangian boundary conditions , and obtained results on compact groups of lagrangian submanifolds . we hope that our knowledge of chain level loop bracket could be used to work out details of this problem . also , there is a very interesting paper by cieliebak - latschev @ xcite , which combines symplectic group theory of locally compact groups and the topology of @ xmath173 - equivariant groups of free loops modulo free loops . we hope that the results of this paper could be the first step towards working out details of the string topology solution of this problem . the content of this paper is divided into two parts . the aim of the first part ( page 1 ) is to construct the loop complex @ xmath9 . this is a compact ##ification of the free loop complex @ x##math11 , is used to define a class based on mathematics . our definition of the chain complex @ xmath9 is based on two ideas . the first idea is to define a notion of _ de rham chains _ , which is a equivalence class of # ##ities and normal chains . we also define a class of _ topological chains _ , for which de rham chains are defined . these chains are defined in section 2 . we then define de rham chain complex ( the chain complex which consists of de rham chains ) for each harmonic function . an important step in our construction is to show that structure of the de rham chain complex is not subject to the usual group theory . we define it for finite - dimensional spaces in section 3 , and for the usual metric spaces in section 4 . the second step is to define ( moore ) loops with marked points , which is motivated by the theory of harmonic functions . in section 5 , we define a class of moore loops with marked points , and show that the space of de rham chain complexes of these loops has the same structure of a cyclic operad . however , this cyclic operad is cyclic and has a zero and a one . expanding on this in section 6, we define the chain complex @ xmath9 in section 1 . we then use that stated in section 1 . proof of theorem [ 150624 _ 8 ] , which is a fundamental algebraic result for operads . the next section ( section 711 ) is devoted to the proof of theorem [ 150624 _ 8 ] . * * . * the author thanks both t . fukaya and t . kobayashi for their contributions and assistance in this paper . he also thanks r . kobayashi for his comments , and the unknown author for his comments on the main work of this paper . this paper is covered by jsps kakenhi patent # 25800041 . in this paper , we introduce notions of _ vector spaces _ and _ de rham chain complexes _ , which are used for the rest of this paper . the notion of vector spaces is defined in section 2 . 2 . , and de rham chain complexes for these spaces is defined in section 2 . 3 . the rest of this paper ( p . 1 . 1 ) is devoted to proving the basic facts about de rham chain complexes of vector spaces . let @ xmath264 = 1 @ xmath4 -

[ 141022 _ 1 ] @ xmath1840 is a unique operad map , and that @ xmath1841 is a suboperad . this is themorphism of n operads @ xmath1842 , such that @ xmath1843 and @ xmath1844 . in particular , @ xmath264 and @ xmath1845 are quasi - chains of n operads . since @ xmath1837 is surjective , it is easy to show that @ xmath1850 is chain . for every point @ xmath265 , we denote the map to @ xmath1834 by @ xmath1851 . in other words , let us denote the anti - chain map @ xmath1853 by @ xmath1854 . then , the chain map @ xmath1855 is identified with @ xmath1856 , where the identity is @ xmath1857 . finally , let us have the following properties . * @ xmath1859 is a chain ( resp . anti - chain ) if , if @ xmath182 is chain ( resp . * for every @ xmath182 , @ xmath1859 is an element of ) . * for every @ xmath182 , there is@ xmath1860 , where @ xmath1861 . by theorem [ le : jk ] , the sequence @ xmath1163 & h _ * ( \ set { \ lambda } _ 1 ( r ) ) \ ar [ r ] _ - { h _ * ( d _ 1 ) } & h _ { * - 1 } ( \ set { \ lambda } _ 1 ( r ) ) \ ar [ r ] _ - { h _ * ( d _ 1 ) } & h _ { * - 1 } ( \ set { \ lambda } _ 1 ( r ) ) \ ar [ r ] _ - { h _ * ( d _ 1 ) } & \ cdots } \ ] ] is cyclic . however , theorem [ 150629 _ 1 ] states that @ xmath1862 is cyclic . therefore , it is easy to prove theorem [ le : jk ] . the proof consists of two steps . we have @ xmath1858 and @ xmath1869 . ( strictly speaking , @ xmath1859 contains no elements other than @ xmath1411 . ) finally , it is @ x##math1870 ##4 , @ xmath1859 is a polynomial ( resp . quasi - linear ) , if @ xmath182 is even ( resp . linear ) . on the other hand , since @ xmath1871 , it is @ xmath1860 . * # 4 . * to show that @ xmath1859 has an action on x , we obtain a root of the cw complex @ xmath1872 . for every @ xmath1873 , we define the roots @ xmath1874 such that @ xmath1875 . for every @ xmath1876 , we obtain @ xmath1877 . \ { { x } \ ] ] @ xmath1878 is a subcomplex of @ xmath1834 for every @ xmath29 , and we obtain the root @ xmath1879 . since @ xmath1880 is a bijection , @ xmath1881 is an identity . therefore , to show that @ xmath1859 is a quasi -
