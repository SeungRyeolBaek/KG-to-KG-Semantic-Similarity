superconducting josephson one qubit is one of the most promising candidates for efficient quantum computing @ xcite . two qubit coherent coupling in superconducting qubits has been observed charge @ xcite and both the qubit computation and computation have been performed on charge @ xcite , flux @ xcite and flux @ xcite qubits . efficient quantum computing requires weak and strong coupling between the flux as well as its neighbour qubits . so far research efforts have been devoted to the study of the strong coupling of charge @ xcite , flux - phase @ xcite and flux qubits @ xcite . for flux qubits the usual coupling can give strong coupling , but it is too weak to perform the s - qubit gate operations . therefore , while the superconducting two qubit ##s - qubit coherent coupling and cnot gate operations were also performed @ xcite , no such coupling was made for inductively coupled flux qubit @ xcite . in this context , we propose a scheme to achieve a strong and tunable coupling between two flux - phase flux qubits . the strong - coupling scheme , which wethus , @ xcite , has been used in the theoretical model @ xcite . the phase coupling energy of flux - coupled qubits with strong dc magnetic fields was first proposed in @ xcite . subsequently , there have been studies of the different phase - coupling schemes @ xcite . the induced loops of a flux qubit are characterized by the mutual coupling energy associated with the phase differences across josephson junctions in the qubit loop . if we try to connect two flux qubits with dc fields , the coupling energy @ xmath0 @ xcite will be too weak to perform the equivalent cnot ##t @ @ xcite , since the mutual current @ xmath1 and the induced current of the flux ( s ) qubit @ xmath2 are equally strong . even if the induced currents of flux qubits are weak , the phase differences across josephson junctions @ xmath3 are as strong as @ xmath4 . therefore , if two flux qubits are characterized by the phase differences across the josephson junctions of flux qubits , we can get a good correlation of the values of josephson loop energy @ xmath5 of the josephson junctions in the induced loopwhose energy density is as high as up to + 200ghz . using the dc - squid ##s in the connecting loop as shown in fig . [ coup3jjs ] we can see the coupling between dc - squid flux qubits . the control currents , @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 , from the dc - squid ##s must be in _ opposite _ direction in order to give rise to the correct coupling . when the currents are in the _ opposite _ direction , the change of the flux causes an additional current flowing in the connecting loop , causing the change of qubit states as well as the change of coupling strength . such a coupling still exists in the case of _ 2 _ dc - squid ##s in the loop . however , if the control currents are in opposite direction , we have shown that the control currents flowing from the dc - squid ##s are different in time and therefore the coupling strength cannot be tunable with the qubit states present . the maxwell - josephson flux qubits @ xcite in fig . [ coup3jjs ] have two different values ; if the qubit is @ xmath8 , it is zero and , if @ xmath9 ,2 . using the terms @ xmath10 @ xmath11 for the ( internal ) ground states of a qubit in 3 - space , there will be four possible states of two qubits , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 , of which we have one of the two ground states , @ xmath12 , and one of the two current states , @ xmath14 , as symbols . [ coup3jjs ] . the phases @ xmath16 and @ xmath17 of the josephson junctions of the non - josephson - qubits have different energy if the qubits are in different states . so the energy @ @ xmath18 equals the energy @ xmath19 of the josephson junctions of the - # ##s . if we take the internal energy , the two states of the first ( internal ) qubit and the closed phase can be simply written as @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 is the energy and @ xmath22 with the external flux @ xmath23 and the internal flux and @ xmath24 withdimensionless effective flux for the same ( right ) qubit . then @ xmath25 with the induced current @ xmath26 and the induced flux @ xmath2 of qubit ##s is the effective flux of the qubit and @ xmath27 that of the connecting loop and @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 are connected . we assume that the effective flux @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 of the qubit ##s are oriented in different directions , since they are oriented in a different direction in the initial condition of . . . therefore , for considering the qubit ##s , we must make the direction of the flux in the qubit ##s irrelevant . since there is no effective flux in the connecting loop , but the value of @ xmath32 in the initial condition of is . ( [ loopbc ] ) is the value of the flux in the connecting loop , @ xmath33 when both qubits are in their initial state , i . e . , one is connected and the other not , the value of @ xmath34 is @ xmath35 . since the effective flux of each qubit is injust like @ xmath36 , the interaction of @ xmath37 with the time - dependent coupled qubits can be a strong one due to the weak coupling theory . the hamiltonian of the coupled qubits can be given by @ xmath38 which is that of the system with effective mass @ xmath1 and the effective mass @ xmath39 with @ xmath40 . the kinetic part of the hamiltonian follows from the effective energy of the josephson junctions , as @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 are the energies of the josephson junctions of the outer ( outer ) qubit loop and the center loop , respectively . the amount of # # ##ating energy in josephson junctions @ xmath44 @ xmath45 is proportional to the energy of @ xmath46 [ where @ xmath47 = $ $ ] , where @ xmath48 , @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 the energies of the josephson junctions . if we use the effective energy @ xmath51 and the effective energy @ xmath52 @ xmath53 to give the effective energy ofthe hamiltonian . the coupling energy of the two qubits is composed of the coupling energy of ; and the josephson coupling energy of ; @ xmath54 . @ xmath55 is the coupling energy of coupling with the energy of the right qubit @ xmath56 , left qubit @ xmath57 and connecting loop @ xmath58 . @ xmath59 is the energy of the josephson junction of right qubit ##s and @ xmath60 that of the connecting loop with josephson coupling ##s @ xmath61 and @ xmath5 . taking the coupling energy @ xmath76 and applying the boundary conditions of and . ( [ switchbc ] ) to obtain @ xmath77 the josephson coupling energy of the connecting loop @ xmath78 can also be written as @ xmath79 \ { [ \ phi ' _ t + \ phi ( f ' _ s - f ' _ t ) ] , \ nonumber \ { { 0 } \ ] ] where we have @ xmath80 and @ xmath81 . first of all we consider the fact that the connecting loop , @ xmath##6 and @ xmath7 , have opposite signs so that @ xmath82 implies that the boundary conditions in q . ( [ switchbc ] ) also have opposite signs . in order to calculate the fourth power as a function of @ xmath83 and @ xmath84 , we reexpress @ xmath85 into @ xmath86 using the boundary conditions in q . ( [ loopbc ] ) and the terms in ##q . ( [ phi1 ] ) . then @ xmath87 can be written as @ xmath88 with the term of @ xmath89 in the last term . depending on whether @ xmath90 is even or odd , the results will be slightly different , but still the same . let and then , for , we write @ xmath90 is odd and then @ xmath91 , @ xmath92 and @ xmath93 for , and then @ xmath85 = @ xmath94 and the term of josephson is not the term in question . ( [ uswi ] ) @ xmath95 . \ | { 1 } \ ]] since the local energy @ xmath55 can be calculated , the lowest effective potential @ xmath96 in fig . ( [ usum ] ) is given by the product of the energies in fig . ( [ uqubit ] ) and ( [ uswidiff ] ) , @ xmath97 the local energy value of @ xmath98 in @ xmath99 ##8 can be obtained by writing the local energy @ xmath100 in fig . ( [ uswidiff ] ) and @ xmath101 when @ xmath102 . we get the effective potential @ xmath103 in fig . [ ii ] ( i ) with two local energies . the value of local energy of case ( i ) can be calculated from @ xmath104 and we have found that both local energies have the same energy , @ xmath105 , for different pseudo - spin state with @ xmath106 . then we get @ xmath107 of case ( ii ) from @ xmath108 for different pseudo - spin state . as a result , we get @ xmath109 where @ x##math110 is the value of @ xmath111 with . ##ization of the same spin state , @ xmath112 , and @ xmath113 the value of @ xmath114 of the same spin state , @ xmath115 with @ xmath116 . the value of the same spin state , @ xmath117 , is higher than that of different spin states , @ xmath118 , as shown in fig . [ 1 ] ( 2 ) . thus we have @ xmath119 , @ xmath120 and @ xmath70 . for the same spin state we have two values , @ xmath121 , corresponding to different spin states , @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 . when @ xmath124 , @ xmath125 and @ xmath126 and then @ xmath127 and @ xmath128 from the same solution as fig . ( [ qubitbc ] ) with @ xmath129 . since the spin states of the qubits of @ xmath130 are , this can be seen fromfig . [ coup3jjs ] ( b ) , this two - qubits state can be written as @ xmath12 ##0 as in fig . [ 2 ] ( a ) . on the other hand , when @ xmath131 , @ xmath132 , the qubit at @ xmath133 corresponds to the spin current at , @ xmath13 . we would like to note that , since the spin currents @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 of left and right qubit ##s are moving in opposite directions , the ( spin ) currents of coupled qubits in @ xmath12 ( @ xmath13 ) , are moving in opposite directions . . the values of spin transitions of coupled qubits vary in three dimensions with @ xmath119 , @ xmath120 , @ xmath70 and @ xmath102 . [ values = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , value = " ^ " , ] for different spin currents , different values are easily obtained for @ xmath134 . when @ xmath135 , @ xmath136 forleft and right qubit ##s , which corresponds to the state , @ xmath14 ##1 fig . [ potential ] ( a ) . in the same way @ xmath137 corresponds to the state @ xmath15 . hence we can get two stable states , @ xmath138 and @ xmath15 , with states @ xmath139 and @ xmath140 being the energy levels of @ xmath103 as shown in fig . [ potential ] ( a ) . even though these four states are stable states in @ xmath141 plane , they can be solved in the same plane if they are fixed points . hence we can get the effective potential @ xmath98 in @ xmath142 plane . from the expression of @ xmath143 in fig . ( [ potential ] ) and the expression @ xmath144 in fig . ( [ rel ] ) , we can get @ xmath145 and , by this means , in the @ xmath141 plane , we get the effective potential as shown in fig . [ potential ] ( b ) , where we can also use the energy . in fig .[ potential ] ( a ) , for the states @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 of case ( i ) , we can compute the values @ xmath146 and , for case ( ii ) , the values @ xmath147 of fig . ( [ rel ] ) , ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) and the values of @ xmath83 in the plane . as a result , we are able to compute the energy differences at local coordinates of fig . [ potential ] ( b ) from fig . [ potential ] ( a ) with and , and prove the existence of the states in the plane . in the [ potential ] we compute the values of the energy differences for the states , @ xmath148 , of coupled qubits at local coordinates . thus we found the energy states in fig . [ potential ] ( b ) , but found that they are not in @ xmath142 states . the hamiltonian of coupled qubits can be written as @ xmath149 where @ xmath150 and @ xmath151 with @ xmath152 and @ xmath153 with the @ x##math154 . statement . first two terms are qubit ##s , the third is coupling term and last two terms are energy terms which arise from the quantum numbers induced by the coupling term of the hamiltonian . so the coupling term @ xmath155 of the coupled qubits is given by @ xcite @ xmath156 in fig . [ contpot ] we compare the energies of n - qubits for the @ xmath157 with @ xmath120 , @ xmath119 and @ xmath70 in @ xmath158 diagram . when @ xmath102 in fig . [ contpot ] ( a ) , the energies @ xmath139 of the two spin states , @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , are higher than @ xmath140 , of the opposite spin states , @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 . the energies of the spin states are shown in figure [ 1 ] . as with @ xmath157 , the energy of @ xmath159 becomes larger ( see figure 2 ( b ) ) and so @ xmath160 and @ x##math161 ] ( b ) . since @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 , the coupling strength can be expressed as @ xmath164 . the coupling strength of the different qubits varies by varying the magnetic field @ xmath157 of the dc - ac junction and the feedback mechanism . from fig . ( [ umin ] ) the coupling strength @ xmath155 can be expressed as a function of @ xmath157 and @ xmath165 , which is @ xmath166 in fig . [ twodiff ] ( c ) we express the coupling @ xmath167 and @ xmath168 as a function of @ xmath157 , where @ xmath169 . when @ xmath102 , @ xmath155 is of the order of @ xmath5 so that we can have a very strong coupling . by tuning @ xmath157 the coupling strength can be changed from weak coupling to support for @ xmath161 . the coupling strength @ xmath168 in fig . ( [ 2 ] ) depends on @ xmath170 as well= @ xmath5 . when @ xmath171 is positive , @ xmath168 is equal to @ xmath5 and @ xmath172 . recently the cross - correlation effect has been successfully demonstrated @ xcite , where three - josephson junctions qubits are used instead of the two - josephson junctions qubits . in that experiment the josephson type value @ xmath173 of the loop is changed so that the value of @ xmath170 is now @ xmath174 . as a result , the circuit has a strong coupling effect . the length of the loop can be written as @ xmath175 , which gives the voltage , @ xmath176 and then @ xmath177 with then @ xmath178 satisfying the boundary conditions in fig . ( [ switchbc ] ) . then , using fig . ( [ phi2 ] ) and the corresponding current @ xmath34 using fig . ( [ rel ] ) , the voltage @ xmath179 is given by @ xmath180 this current - voltage relationship can be written as the josephson - type value , @ xmath18##1 , with the effective josephson coupling energy , @ xmath182 , of the spin - states , in the connecting loop @ xmath183 and the phase difference @ xmath184 . the coupling constant in q . ( [ j ] ) , can be given by the effective josephson coupling energy , @ xmath182 . then the effective phase difference , @ xmath185 , and the josephson coupling energy , @ xmath182 , gives the current in the connecting loop and the coupling constant of the state - space qubits . for the two spin states , @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , the current of connecting loop @ xmath58 is weak , since @ xmath186 and not @ xmath187 . for the two spin states @ xmath14 with @ xmath102 , @ xmath188 and we get @ xmath189 from @ xmath190 and the current in q . ( [ j ] ) . a strong current @ xmath58 in the connecting loop , implies the boundary condition of the qubit and connecting loop , that @ xmath191 for @xmath102 . when @ xmath157 becomes @ xmath192 , the total josephson junction energy @ xmath193 and therefore the energy @ xmath58 in connecting loop becomes zero , which means that the interaction between two qubits is closed loop . now we need to consider the case that two control flux are in the same direction and the case that there is only one anti - current in connecting loop . if two control flux are in the same direction such as @ xmath194 the josephson junction energy of the connecting loop becomes @ xmath195 . \ nonumber \ \ \ { { 0 } \ ] ] the model used in the case of two types of control flux is that the two spin states , @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , have equal energies such as @ xmath196 for @ xmath197 . for two spin states , @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 , the energies @ xmath198 and @ xmath199 are equal to the different energies @ xmath200 which can be derived from this . ( [ swisame ] ) . since the two, @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 , a different sign for @ xmath113 , the next step is the sign of @ xmath201 where @ xmath113 is in one of the states of @ xmath114 for the different spin states . the [ contpot ] ( diagram ) ( top right ) for @ xmath202 shows that , when the control loops are in the same state , the states @ xmath198 and @ xmath199 are different from @ xmath203 . the energy levels of @ xmath204 are shown in fig . [ twodiff ] ( b ) . in this figure the total energies @ xmath205 and @ xmath206 corresponding to left and right qubits of the hamiltonian of fig . ( [ hcoup ] ) are greater than respectively , @ xmath207 , as @ xmath157 increases from above . for the different spin states in fig . [ coup3jjs ] ( b ) , if the control loops @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 , the spin - 1 ##s are in theopposite ##ly , the control currents @ xmath58 in the connecting loop will flow into the left and right qubit states . all the qubit states are separated by the magnetic field , which also makes the two - qubit system possible . however , if the control currents @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 flow in opposite directions , the energies of the coupled states are equal to each other , @ xmath208 , as shown in fig . [ twodiff ] ( 2 ) . this means that the control currents coming from the dc - squid ##s are opposite each other and the coupling energy produced by the effective currents @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 is zero in the connecting loop . as a result , the net result is in fact the coupling energy @ xmath155 of the left qubit ##s . we can get one of two qubit ##s with a dc - squid , whose control currents are @ xmath209 instead of those in fig . ( [ loopbc ] ) and ( [ switchbc ] ) . so we get the josephson coupling energy of the dc - squid , @ xmath210 which gives energies equal to those of the two- squid s with flux in the same direction as that @ xmath211 for @ xmath197 and @ xmath212 as shown in fig . [ twodiff ] ( 2 ) . so the currents of one dc - squid in the connecting loop are exactly the same as those of two dc - squid s with flux in the same direction . so we need to apply currents in dc - squid s in both directions to provide the control coupling in the connecting loop for obtaining the control coupling . in order to obtain the control coupling , the qubit - flux , @ xmath213 , and the flux , @ xmath214 , of the left qubit are in opposite directions to those of the right qubit , @ xmath31 and @ xmath7 as shown in fig . [ coup3jjs ] . in these cases it can be very difficult to apply two fields of equal strength together . we have already obtained a control coupling for spin - locked n qubits @ xcite , where an isolated pair of qubits is connected in a spin state . however , applying two magnetic fields in the same direction reduces to the fluxof , in both directions , for the experimental design . the first experiment with the dc - coupled flux qubits without dc - squid ##s @ xcite has shown that the flux qubit ##s are in a strongly correlated state . the dc - squid ##s in the opposite direction of the fully tunable modulation field can have a decoherence effect on the flux qubit ##s . a recent study showed that the dc - squid experimental design should be the main source of the decoherence of the flux qubits @ xcite . for the experimental design , fig . , 2 , the decoherence from the dc - squid ##s should be used . since the dc - squid design is connected to a zero state , the signals from transmission lines to the ##es can be opposite each other . for the case of qubit ##bc , the two states are very far from the non - zero state , @ xmath70 , and therefore we could not any longer use the external inductance and external currents . so we compared the results of this experiment with a simulation with the same boundary conditions similar to those in above . ( [ qubitbc ] ) @ xmath215 ( [ switchbc ] ) , dc -coupling relation @ xmath216 and the coupling relation @ xcite . exact coupling between two phase - coupled flux qubits can be obtained by using two dc - squid ##s in the connecting loop with control pulses in opposite directions . we can show at non - experimental level ( @ xmath70 ) that the coupling relation of the phase - coupled flux qubits can be obtained by changing the value of @ xmath157 from @ xmath217 to @ xmath192 ; this can be as small as 1 @ xmath218 and change the cut - off voltage . when all the control pulses are in the same direction or there is only one dc - squid in the connecting loop , the flux qubits can also be described by the same hamiltonian . under slightly different conditions principles of experimental and theoretical physics can be used to obtain exact coupling . - a . makhlin , a . schn , and a . shnirman , j . phys . * 73 * , 357 ( 2001 ) ; j . galindo and j . m . martn - delgado , _ ibid . _ * 73 * , 347 ( 2002 ) . s . nakamura, yu . a . pashkin , and j . s . tsai , nature * 398 * , 786 ( 1999 ) . t . yu , y . yamamoto , y . chu , y . chu , and y . wang , nature * 296 * , 889 ( 2002 ) . m . chiorescu , y . nakamura , a . j . a . j . harmans , and j . j . mooij , nature * 299 * , 1869 ( 2003 ) . yu . pashkin , y . yamamoto , o . astafiev , y . nakamura , v . a . averin , and j . s . tsai , nature * 421 * , 823 ( 2003 ) . t . yu , yu . a . pashkin , o . astafiev , y . nakamura , and j . s . tsai , nature * 425 * , 941 ( 2003 ) . m . izmalkov , m . grajcar , m . iichev , m . ivanov , m . - meyer , a . yu . smirnov , a . a . m . amin , alec maassen van den berg , and a . a . zagoskin , phys . . lett. * 93 * , 037003 ( 2004 ) . a . grajcar , a . izmalkov , a . j . j . van der ploeg , a . linzen , a . iichev , a . schmidt , a . hubner , a . - meyer , alec maassen van den berg , a . uchaikin , and a . a . zagoskin , phys . b * 93 * , 020503 ( 2004 ) ( 2005 ) . j . j . majer , j . j . paauw , j . j . j . ter haar , a . j . a . j . harmans , and j . j . mooij , phys . rev . lett . * 91 * , 090501 ( 2005 ) . r . j . berkley _ et al . _ , b * 93 * , 1548 ( 2003 ) . a . a . averin and a . bruder , phys . b * , 057003 ( 2003 ) ; y . c . you , y . y . tsai , and y . nori , phys . * 93 * , 024510 ( 2003 ) . j . blais, alec maassen van der wal , and a . a . zagoskin , phys . lett . * 76 * , 127901 ( 2003 ) . a . j . a . plourde _ et al . _ , b * 73 * , 140501 ( pdf ) ( 2004 ) . a . bertet , a . j . a . a . harmans , and j . e . mooij , phys . b * 73 * , 064512 ( 2006 ) . y . - y . liu , y . a . nakamura , j . s . tsai , and t . nori , phys . * 76 * , 067003 ( 2006 ) . j . a . niskanen , y . nakamura , and j . s . tsai , phys . b * 76 * , 094506 ( 2006 ) . j . e . mooij _ et al . _ , science * 285 * , 1036 ( 1999 ) ; and j . van der wal _ et al . _ , science * 290 * , 773 ( 2000 ) . j . a . muller _ et al . _ , phys . rev . b * 290 * , 15398 ( 1999) . j . k . kim , k . kim , and y . hong , phys . rev . b * * * , 134513 ( 2003 ) .
