developments are currently underway to improve the sensitivity of ligo and to improve the accuracy for detecting gravitational waves emitted by the ##ed ##i @ xcite . of particular interest are the spectra of gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral and transit of a black hole ( bbh ) events . detection rates for bbh events are expected to reach about 0 . 41000 per second with the ligo @ xcite . it is expected that appropriate detection techniques are in place in order to improve the accuracy of detection of gravitational wave events . the detection technique currently employed by ligo is a single - frame approach whereby signals are added to a pre - selected data set of multiple frames . the frames are chosen to represent an arbitrary region of high - dimensional euclidean space and are placed in space in such a way that provides an approximate match between any given template in the frame and its own corresponding frame . however , the frame placement process also requires many combinations of templates ( e . g . @ xcite ) , for both time and energy ; something that can only be achieved with the full theory of general relativity ( nr ) techniques . to address this issue , ligo recommends the use of other detection techniques like phenomenological analysis @ xcite for the- many - body theory @ xcite . we shall focus mainly on the phenomenological model ( phenomb ) family constructed by @ xcite . this model family includes bbh waves with constant mass and free - frame structure ( i . e . non - spherical waves ) . the family is constructed by adding a parameterized parameter to the nr ##f in order to obtain a linear inspiral - to - ringdown ( imr ) ratio as a function of mass and time . the main advantage of the phenomb family is that it allows for the efficient analysis of magnetic fields at arbitrary points in free space and can thus be used to create very large data sets . to increase the efficiency of the algorithm , it is necessary to reduce the number of samples under analysis . a number of different filtering algorithms have been developed , either via form - space filtering ( svd ) @ xcite , or via a vector filter @ xcite . svd is an algebraic algorithm that transforms nr ##s into an orthonormal template with a noise that effectively blocks out the noise present in the original template . as a result , the number of samples required for re - sampling can ;is used . in addition , it has been demonstrated by @ xcite that , upon mapping the data onto the orthonormal basis generated by the svd , mapping the projection coefficients yields better performance of the imr data sets obtained in the original template bank . in this article , we continue to explore the properties of the family of projection coefficients . we present a new approach that uses only the algorithms phenomb ##rane # @ xcite and nr ##e # @ xcite . we map svd to a template bank derived from an nr data set to produce an orthonormal basis for the data , then map the nr data onto this basis and adjust the projection coefficients to allow different values to be chosen , thus producing a single sample approximant . we show further that this method improves upon the performance of the original nr data set . the resulting nr data shows correlation with the nr data : high of @ xmath0 when " extremization of the correlation is required ( i . e . , a fraction of the size " of the sample approximant ) , and low of @ xmath1 when .the " " ( i . e . , " fraction of the size " of the second approximant ) . with our svd accuracy booster , we are able to generate a hybrid system , ( denoted by ) with mass @ xmath2 , without extremization of the distance . this section is organized as follows . we start in section [ sec : mbias ] where we give names to the parameters given in our paper . we then compare our nr ##m model to the phenomb model and conclude that a time - gap exists between the two . in section [ sec : method ] we apply our svd accuracy booster ##s to the case both of equal - mass , zero - mass systems . in section [ sec : method ] we discuss the possibility of extending this model to the zero - mass systems . we start with this , in section [ sec : method ] . a hybrid wave is generated by a correlation function , @ xmath3 , where real and imaginary numbers are the reciprocal and complex components of the function . the real form of @ xmath4 depends on the mass of the system , in our paper the form of @ xmath5 and the zero -and @ xmath6 . since @ xmath4 is a continuous function of x , we discretize the function @ xmath7 , where the sampling coefficients @ xmath8 are calculated for @ xmath9 . we shall also sample the magnetic field @ xmath4 . this analysis is carried out in free software via @ xmath10 where @ xmath11 is the ligo noise curve and @ xmath12 is the fourier transform of @ xmath4 . the final time - series estimate , @ xmath13 , is obtained by applying the inverse fourier transform of . for the purposes of the analysis , we shall simply refer to the samples , using the prefix ` ` ' ' ' . for our purposes it is to take @ xmath11 to be the advanced ligo noise curve . using the advanced ligo noise curve would only serve to further restrict our attention to studying signals only in the high frequency range . as a measure of the degree of correlation between two samples , @ xmath4 and @ xmath14 , we shall take their sum , the sum , @ xmath15 @ xcite. we define @ xmath16 where @ xmath17 is the corresponding discrete dot product and the norm @ xmath18 . we then calculate the # ##s over time - and phase - shifts of the two points . the time - shift is exponential in , and the expectation - value is an integral function of the norm . assume that @ xmath19 . for the number of points @ xmath20 we have that @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 is the complex product of @ xmath14 . without this , would have to be calculated in the same domain with a simpler function @ xmath23 . the main advantage of is its compatibility with other definitions for the svd , which can allow us to perform more complex calculations . . when integrating over time - shifts @ xmath24 , we can use the phase - shifts in the powers of @ xmath25 , and this avoids ambiguity . once the overlap has been calculated , it is possible to define in terms of the norm , @ xmath26 , or even , @ xmath27 we use this result in the analysis to determine the degree of .for them . we use numerical simulations starting with the statistical analysis method for @ xcite . here , we use the spin - coupled equal - mass ( mass - ratio @ xmath28 ) , zero - spin ( zero spin @ xmath29 ) systems described in @ xcite . in case [ 1 : 1 ] , we also use the mass ratio described in @ xcite . the systems are combined with a taylort3 non - linear ( pn ) system as described in @ xcite at the level @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 for mass - ratio @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 , respectively . taylort4 of 2 . 5pn , is used to perform nr ##t - r for equal - mass , zero - spin bbh in @ xcite ( see also fig . 9 of @ xcite ) . for @ xmath34 , a taylort3 hybrid is very similar to a taylort4 hybrid , see . fig 9 of @ xcite . the transition between taylort3 and taylort4 systems occurs below @ xmath35 for @ xmath36 , compared to above @ xmath37 for @xmath38 , and @ xmath39 for @ xmath40 . these errors are much larger than those obtained from the models described above , so we assume that our results are not affected by the accuracy of the original @ xmath28 pn - nr hybrid models . for higher mass - ratio , the pn - nr models have a larger error compared to the post - newton mass @ xcite . the error - rate of the error associated with mass - ratio , however , is not in our models however , because we use the @ xmath41 model only for the region of @ xmath42 , where most of the post - newton mass is in excess . because nr hybrids are only used for high mass ratios , we will therefore limit our models to the high - mass and low - mass nr hybrid models described above . the nr imr model can be obtained at any point along the @ xmath43 line by a simple comparison of amplitude and phase with the mass @ xmath44 of the line . in such a simple approach , the @ xmath43 line is restricted to regions of zero - mass @ xcite , andassuming a smooth curve in terms of frame size , and assuming a small amount of frame overlap . since our method for constructing an orthonormal model deals with phenomb families , let us first consider how well these families represent the nr data to be analyzed . for this purpose , we use the frames @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 to represent nr and phenomb families of total mass @ xmath44 , respectively . we calculate the size of the phenomb families by calculating the [ @ xmath47 $ ] as a function of mass . the result of this calculation for @ xmath48 is shown by the dotted line on the right side of the [ mass : r ] . the curve builds up very quickly with @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 and then slowly decreases as the mass is increased , until finally returning to @ xmath51 at total mass . the distance between nr and phenomb families can be calculated by averaging with the z - axis . this is done by looking for the frame @ xmath52 for which the [ @ xmath53 $ ]is a constant . the efficiency of this method is shown by the solid line in the top panel of figure [ figure : bias ] . accounting for the mass range , is the bias for @ xmath54 . the mass @ xmath55 that reduces bias is much lower than the mass @ xmath44 of our nr ` ` true ' ' signal , @ xmath56 for almost all of the mass range , . however , phenomb ##rons are already below the accuracy of the ` ` true ' ' nr signal , at least in the region of parameter space shown above . the solid line in the top panel of figure [ figure : bias ] is the nr mass - range , @ xmath57 . for @ xmath50 this line becomes @ xmath58 , and then rises to [ [ @ xmath59 for @ xmath60 . and @ xmath29 . a more conservative choice of frequency , mass range , and mass bias will improve this accuracy . ] it is important to consider how this mass range relates to the overall parameter space accuracy of the rf model . for a model with a single - signal signal - to - noise ratio ( snr) of the rest of the detection . amplitude / phase differences can affect the selection when the selection occurs @ xmath61 @ xcite . in a paper written at the bottom right of page [ 1 : 1 ] for @ xmath62 , we note that for @ xmath63 phenomb - samples have no significant effect ; for @ xmath64 a phenomb sample with the highest stability will be the best fit for the selection . for @ xmath65 the missmatch between equal - mass phenomb samples and nr ( when adjusted over mass ) corresponds to @ xmath66 . adjusting over mass - values may correct this error , but we have not determined to what extent . we want to construct an orthonormal basis via the svd of the family of phenomb - samples , and to use the values of nr , mapped onto this basis to construct a new family with good nr stability . the next step is to construct a new family of phenomb waveforms , with attention paid to equal - mass , low - energy samples . an example of this on the @ xmath##43 ##1 states that template bank construction can be done by randomly arranging targets in decreasing order of their overlap . with this , we define the template bank to consist of @ xmath67 phenomb ##rons , with @ xmath68 ( @ xmath69 ) , with @ xmath70 and with all targets satisfying the following : @ xmath71 where @ xmath72 is the total overlap between targets and @ xmath73 is a small increase in this overlap . the template bank is constructed by finding the minimum mass first @ xmath74 and then @ xmath75 . new targets are created by gradually moving toward higher masses in order to increase targets , until the minimum mass @ xmath76 is reached . in each iteration , overlap between targets is determined continuously over phase shifts and discretely over amplitude ##s . for template bank construction we need to construct the structure over time using phase shifts of all targets of @ xmath77 . we will refer to our own template bank which contains the targets @ xmath78 , @ xmath79 , @ xmath80 , and @xmath81 . the lower ##most value is needed in order to store a similarly sized template bank of @ xmath82 values ; adding it to @ xmath50 results in more than twice the number of values . these values each have a value of @ xmath83 and are then distributed to @ xmath84 ( a natural extension of @ xmath85 ) . @ xmath86 of above is used to generate this template bank using arbitrary - precision arithmetic . the first step is to convert the resulting matrix into an orthonormal matrix . in the case of @ xcite , this is done by placing the values into the rows of the matrix @ xmath87 and going through svd to obtain @ xmath88 where @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 are orthogonal matrices and @ xmath91 is a diagonal matrix whose non - singular values along the main diagonal are referred to as singular values . the svd for @ xmath87 is then determined as long as the singular values are distributed in linear time along the main diagonal of @ xmath91 . the end result of is to obtain the@ xmath67 complex - valued coefficients into @ xmath92 complex - valued orthonormal basis vectors . the @ xmath93 projection vector , @ xmath94 , is contained in the @ xmath93 element of @ xmath89 , and associated with this vector is the singular value , @ xmath95 , different from the @ xmath93 element on the upper diagonal of @ xmath91 . one of the advantages of svd is that the singular values affect the coefficients only with respect to their ability to represent the original basis . this can be exploited in order to construct a reduced basis that extends the range of the ##s to provide further stability . for example , suppose we want to construct the basis by using only the template @ xmath96 ##7 , and ignoring the second . the coefficients can be represented in this reduced basis by treating them as the template @ xmath97 where @ xmath98 is the complex - valued projection vector , @ xmath99 the following criterion is used to show that the reduced basis is not able to accurately represent the original basis . we cantransform from to to transform the basis . ] it is shown in @ xcite that the accuracy gained from transforming the basis in this case , @ xmath100 . @ xmath91 , can be used to calculate the number of template values , @ xmath101 , and to compare the different values for the same value @ xmath102 . provides a good approximation to the accuracy of represeting values from the original svd data . in order to solve the problem , however , we should consider the corresponding coefficient for each template value . using the orthonormality of @ xmath103 , it is possible to see from that the relationship between the basis and the template can be expressed in terms of the following coefficients : @ xmath104 this coefficient is constant both over time and discretely in phase space in the terms of @ xmath25 . thus @ xmath105 , means that @ xmath106 of the @ xmath107 corresponding values from our original data set are sufficient to transform the template to the desired form . [ ] [ 1 : rec ] wecompare the representation error of @ xmath108 to the corresponding error obtained from for each phenomb template in the data set . the least squares in this table show that the actual representation error is a small amount of error in @ xmath102 , but integration over the data is much superior to the actual error . the phenomb data set can also be reconstructed to a certain degree from the reasonably reduced svd basis . we are of course also interested in determining how well nr data can be represented in the reasonably reduced basis of phenomb data . since nr and phenomb data are not identical , can not be used to compute the errors made when converting nr data onto the reduced basis . we can therefore calculate their representation errors separately . the nr frame , @ xmath109 , can be represented in the reduced basis by corresponding to and expressing it in the form : @ xmath110 where @ xmath111 . as such , the reduced form @ xmath112 will in fact be neither identical nor similar to the reduced form @ xmath109 . the difference between them and @ .##math113 where we tell the reader that we must consider the continuous time shifts and discrete time shifts of the n variables . in figure [ 2 : rec ] we use this text to show the vector space of nr values evaluated over the entire range of values @ xmath114 from which the phenomb template bank was created . we show that nr values can be represented in the same form with no value less than @ xmath35 across all of the template bank range . this is about a third of an increase over what can be achieved by using phenomb values evaluated over nr . since nr representations were not originally included in the template bank , and because a non - correlation exists between the phenomb representations which were included , we can see that the # ##s has no special meaning to nr values . this is different from the thin solid line which traces the nr value value for mass evaluated between the two values . this line moves only across the entire nr range and has no special meaning at the same location . this is in contrast to the thin solid line which traces phenomb representation mass evaluated between values . in this case , however , if werises up from one template and then falls back down as the other template is added . the representation tolerance @ xmath115 of the svd is a critical parameter , which so far , we have found to be @ xmath116 . when this tolerance is reduced , we see the following trend : ( i ) phenomb representation tolerance initially follows @ xmath117 ; ( ii ) nr representation tolerance follows @ xmath117 at first and then _ _ _ to a minimum as the representation tolerance is progressively reduced . these trends are illustrated in figure [ 1 : trun ] where we see nr and phenomb representation tolerance patterns across the whole range of the template ##s , both within and between them . the problem of nr representation tolerance occurs when the nr basis contains most of the nr representation space used in the phenomb representation . reducing the basis thus is the cause of low performance . the high computational cost associated with the reduced basis reduces the performance of an improved nr representation . we therefore need to explore the possibility of using the reduced svd basis of phenomb template ##s to create a new nr basis with improved nr representation . thethe image sizes would be obtained by a simple calculation of the projection coefficients of nr images projected onto the n image . suppose we do this using the physical data , and the algorithm described above . the idea is to calculate nr projection coefficients , @ xmath118 , for a number of points , @ xmath119 , and then perform an algorithm to find the objective function @ xmath120 that can be calculated for each @ xmath121 . the efficiency of the sampling algorithm is increased by sampling the space for which @ xmath118 represents the components of @ xmath121 . it is reasonable to assume that the projection coefficients will vary over the time scale over which the components themselves vary . therefore , a new space to sample corresponds with the area of the image sampled . we define this to be the [ @ xmath122 $ ] for which the nr # ##s are calculated according to : @ xmath123 moves a point @ xmath124 . this space is approximately equivalent to moving a distance equal to the distance between two points . in this case , we measure the real and imaginary parts , @ xmath125and @ xmath126 , of the first projection coefficients to have multiple components that can only be represented by a single vector . this result is true for the basis functions @ xmath127 , 120 , and 123 in figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] . another phenomenon observed in this study is that the projection coefficients are more complex ( i . e . have higher precision ) for higher - order modes . this is a direct result of the higher complexity of low - order basis functions themselves . we find that the low - order modes are simpler while the higher - order modes exhibit many of the features associated with the multi - component and complex nature of the system . although they are more complex , higher - order modes have more # ##ities and are therefore more complex in the design . this is evident from the apparent increase in complexity of the projection coefficients when breaking up the multiple components of figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] . we shall use chebyshev polynomials to represent the projection coefficients . these are a family of orthogonal polynomials where the @ xmath128 chebyshev polynomial is represented by @ xmath129 . \ left { 1 : chebyn } \ .{ 1 } \ ] ] the set of chebyshev nodes can be used to perform the @ xmath130 - chebyshev algorithm by sampling @ xmath131 for the @ xmath132 so - called fixed point and by the pseudo - lobatto chebyshev nodes @ xcite @ xmath133 for @ xmath134 . in practice , the result will not be accurate and a result , @ xmath135 , can be obtained : @ xmath136 . @ xmath137 is the fourier transform of @ xmath45 fitted onto the values of @ xmath94 , @ xmath138 and @ xmath139 is the coefficient obtained by sampling . the nr - value is expressed directly as a function of mass in the expression @ xmath140 { \ bf ##t } _ [ , \ ] ] where the " intp " informs the user that this is derived from the example of @ xmath98 . the new value of constant mass @ xmath44 can be applied to the original nr .##form ( which we refer to " the original " form ) , where the signal is written as @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 being the part of @ xmath45 that is orthogonal to the svd vector ( i . e . orthogonal to the phenomb ##rons in the real basis ) . @ xmath45 differs from @ xmath143 by adding additional @ xmath144 to determine the effect of the mass factors and , we calculate the difference between the actual signal , and the actual error , @ xmath145 $ ] . to do this analysis , it is necessary to calculate the effect of the error , @ xmath146 where we have calculated the actual g - factor and corrected for it . expanding @ xmath147 and re - writing the right - hand - side of to second order in @ xmath148 , we expand @ xmath149 to third order in @ xmath148 , the error is : @ xmath150 we find that the left - hand - side of can be written as @ xmath151 , where @ xmath152 |the value of @ xmath148 corresponds to @ xmath109 , @ xmath153 so , for simplicity , we start by leaving the last term out : @ xmath154 therefore , this gives @ xmath155 \ right \ \ \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { n ' } \ left | mu _ k ( m ) \ right | ^ 2 + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ sum _ { k = n ' + 1 } ^ { 2n } \ right | \ mu _ k ( m ) \ right | ^ 2 + \ frac { 1 } { 2 } | { \ bf ##t } _ \ perp | ^ { \ bf { t } \ ] ] we can find three solutions to the sampling error : ( i ) the sampling error , @ xmath156 ; ( ii ) the sampling error from the original value of the original value , @ xmath157 ; ( iii ) the failure of the svd algorithm to estimate the nr ##e , @ xmath158 . the sum of the first two solutions , which together make up thethe error , is represented by the straight lines in figure [ figure : rec ] . the goal for our orthogonal polynomial method is to find an approximation error that is small compared to the representation error . to minimize the time - dependence of the error , , we calculate the partial approximation error of the mode , @ xmath159 this allows the sum @ xmath160 to be an upper bound on the error represented by , . figure [ figure : rk ] shows @ xmath161 as a sum of mode - error @ xmath162 as well as the partial sum @ xmath163 . the figure corresponds to the approximation error on @ xmath164 chebyshev polynomials are the inverse svd transform of the frist @ xmath106 of @ xmath107 , . in this case , we expect the approximation error to be partially represented by the lowest - order modes and only partially by the highest - order modes . the figures for the errors are shown in figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] and used to compute the errors shown in figure [ figure : rk ] . in thefirst off , representation is much more difficult for low - order modes due to their higher dimensions . this problem is illustrated by the fact that higher - order modes are more efficient for larger data , as shown by the increasing number of projection coefficients . although low - order modes are much smaller and much easier to represent , their dimensions are much larger so that representation errors are greater with respect to higher - order modes . are the main factors contributing to the total error of our linear regression models . their representation error can be calculated directly from the projection coefficients in a way similar to : @ xmath165 = - - \ sqrt { \ mu _ { k = 1 } ^ { k ^ \ prime } \ mu _ k ^ \ prime ( m ) \ mu _ k ^ { \ prime ^ * } ( m ) } . \ { { figure : interpolationmismatch3 } \ ] ] is the case of the basis for which @ xmath166 , and reduces to and to , and the total error is twice the representation error of the original mode . in the [ figure : interperror ] the formis the statistical difference between our nr wave family and the true nr representation for all parameters . finally , is the nr representation obtained without error and the difference between nr and phenomb is constant over time . we conclude that this is not a statistical difference to the nr wave family , and is well above the true nr - phenomb family . this demonstrates the feasibility of using svd mapping to nr data to generate the _ true _ nr family with improved accuracy over the _ phenomb family that was previously used to generate nr . this is a new method for improving phenomenological accuracy and is an important new way to apply the sub - model techniques developed by ligo . so far , we have focused on the total mass distribution of particle r . as previously mentioned , this serves as a useful sub - model , because the @ xmath28 nr model can be related to the total mass , so that we are able to compete against the ` ` r ' ' model . the main goal of this approach is to go into three dimensions where nr models are valid only for small , known masses - the @ xmat##h167 . in this section we are starting our development of the nr ##p method from a two - dimensional template bank of low - mass samples . we have a template bank of phenomb ##rons with p - values @ xmath167 from 1 to 10 and equal masses @ xmath168 . this template bank was created to allow comparison with the measurements done in @ xcite . for the two - dimensional case the construction of the template bank is no longer as easy as before due to the large amount of uncertainty associated with measuring @ xmath167 . one method that has been developed for this problem is to place samples hexagonally on the sample of @ xcite . for this method we have @ xmath169 which is used to achieve a perfect resolution of 0 . 7 . in the initial iteration of @ xcite , samples are placed in the form of a matrix @ xmath87 with real and complex numbers , in a manner where the individual samples are arranged in such a way that their relative masses are equal . the samples are repeated for a perfect resolution of @ xmath170 with equal masses @ xmath9 ##7 that@ xmath171 of nr is used to store the value of @ xmath87 if additional storage is needed . definition of mapping the 32 real - valued parameters into 32 real - valued orthonormal nr parameters . the idea is to have the set of nr parameters mapped onto the svd set of phenomb ##rons with mass - ratios for which nr only holds , and then search amongst these to construct a continuous function family that can be evaluated for all values . this is a method for generating continuous imr functions for mass - ratios that have still not been determined . to start , we take the nr parameter , @ xmath172 , with the values @ xmath44 and mass - ratio @ xmath167 , and map it onto the nr parameters @ xmath94 in order to generate @ xmath173 . we apply a two - step greedy algorithm , to generate continuous functions @ xmath174 that can be evaluated for the values of @ xmath44 and @ xmath167 given by the values of the r ##s . the continuous function family is then , using the formula :@ xmath175 as such , the following example follows . if we can use a filter for which the projection coefficients are all varying functions of @ xmath44 and @ xmath167 . in the case described in @ xcite , the complex phase of the input phase is inherited from the samples : @ xmath176 } \ int _ { ( p , q ) . \ end { [ : musmooth } \ ] ] to see what should be different , let us consider : the phenomb ##rane filter with one phase - the complex phase @ xmath177 : @ xmath178 when using a linear system , or when using a filter system , choosing the complex phase @ xmath177 is difficult , because the filters are not tuned for the phase - space . thus , @ xmath177 would result in the projection coefficients , , @ xmath179 and , if we had chosen the phase @ xmath177 with well - tuned coefficients , this phase would be inherited from the projection coefficients @ xmath180 . for most types of filters , the corresponding complex phase @ xmath177 is the, and therefore , more attention should have been paid to how it works with the @ xmath181 . the transformation removes the uncertainty present in @ xmath177 , making it so that @ xmath182 . this transformation limits the smoothed coefficients to the known values of the @ xmath183 parameters , and does not affect the unphysical mass - ratios at all times . in the upper panel of figure [ figure : coeff2d ] we show the real value of the nr coefficients @ xmath184 for phenomb waves mapped onto the axes of @ xmath185 and @ xmath186 . the lower panels do the same thing , defining the nr coefficients based on the scale of mass - ratios @ xmath167 = \ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 } for which we have calculated them . however , the choice of the @ xmath167 axis is much easier for the phenomb waves since they can be sampled for their mass - ratios , whereas we are limited to looking at only the known mass - ratios for nr coefficients . for comparison purposes , the lower panel of figure [ figure : coeff2d] with the phenomb ##ic coefficients corresponding to the current set of mass - ratios for which the nr coefficients are close to . we get the same general result , in that low - order modes show the uniform structure , while high - order modes show uniform structure . a simple alternative method would be to sample @ xmath187 for nr and of equal order for all the modes ( i . e . as we have seen above ) and then combine these modes along the @ xmath167 axis . since the projection coefficients of figure [ figure : coeff2d ] show uniform structure they must be sampled with at least the nyquist frequency along both axes . however , looking at the lower and upper panels it appears as if this is not even possible for the current set of all nr modes . at most the equal - mass - ratios are only possible to sample with the nyquist frequency along the @ xmath167 axis for high - order modes . in order to get a high resolution from these projection coefficients the full nr signal set has to be sampled with the mass - ratios . looking on the two panels of figure [ figure : coeff2d ] a simple solution would be to .the current set of q - values to be @ xmath167 = \ { 1 . 5 , 2 . 5 , 3 . 5 , 4 . 5 , 5 , 5 . 5 } . thus , while it is not always possible to construct an nr wave ##form using the svd basis algorithm applied to nr waveforms , the possibility remains open if new nr forms are generated . we have shown that svd can be used to improve the quality of nr waves from a phenomb template basis . a highly accurate svd basis was able to reduce noise by a factor of 10 compared to phenomb template averaging by 1 . there is also no mass - bias associated with the svd basis and therefore no specification of physical parameters required . this is because svd represents a family of wave ##forms with an extended range of free space so that physical parameters are incorporated into the structure . svd also represents a general mechanism by which phenomenological wave structures can be mass - selected and generated for use as mass - biased templates . we were able to compare the svd basis of phenomb template against nr waveforms in order to construct an nr wave family with a2 . this was done by projecting the values of nr values directly onto the phenomb model . only one error was introduced in the new model and the new model also provided a more accurate representation of the ` ` ' ' ' nr model compared to the original phenomb model . this was done especially for the case of zero - mass , zero - energy models . we continue to explore the possibility of applying this approach to phenomb data along with equal - mass models . at present , however , this approach is not economically feasible since the current distribution of mass - ratios obtained from nr models is insufficient to match the nr data with the nyquist data . this situation will improve as new nr models are developed and should be used if the current average rate of mass - ratios is to improve . we thank ilana macdonald for developing the nr models used in this project . also , jde and hpp # acknowledge the support of the national scientific and engineering research council of canada , the canada research council association , the canadian institute for advanced research , and industry canada and the government of canada through the department of economic development and trade . dk ##c acknowledges the support of the max planck society .
