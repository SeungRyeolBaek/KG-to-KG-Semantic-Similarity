the pair - correlation density @ xmath1 is one of the key concepts in determining the interaction energy , arising from the uncertainty principle and weak interaction , in the homogeneous electron system ( noble gases ) . @ xcite , also plays a key role in the study of the pair - correlation density - functionals in density - functional theory ( dft ) , @ xcite since in these cases the homogeneous electron system is often used as a reference frame . a great deal of theoretical progress has recently been made in obtaining an accurate description of @ xmath1 , and the more general time - domain pair - correlation density @ xmath3 , with @ xmath4 $ ] . @ xcite in particular , @ xmath0 , the single - shell pair - correlation density , which exists independently from @ xmath5 since @ xmath6 , has become well known to play a key role in dft . @ xcite the theoretical value of @ xmath0 was not known in many - body physics long , because the random walk approximation ( rpa ) , @ xcite due to the lack of accurate predictions of the long - range particle dynamics , gives only approximate values for @ xmath##0 when the energy levels are not too high . @ xcite it is well known that , in many - body physics , the long - range correlation can be most easily taken into account by the rpa , whereas the short - range correlation can be better understood by the string theory ( lt ) . @ xcite in this case , we want to describe the long - range correlation in terms of @ xmath7 in the lt , in both three dimensions ( 3d ) and two dimensions ( 2d ) . in fact , experiments in this area go back decades ago , and a great deal of progress has been made . @ xcite it is important here to give an introduction to the lt . the weak interaction @ xmath8 in the lt between two different atoms with different energies @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 has the following h - type equation : @ xcite @ xmath11 where @ xmath12 is the fourier transform of the electron energy , @ xmath13 is the wave function of the noninteracting ground state and @ xmath14 is the electron energy , and @ xmath15 . as mentioned above , the rpa has failed .of the long - range values of the electrons , similarly for @ xmath1 and @ xmath16 . in particular , the expressions for @ xmath17 in the rpa satisfy the following minimum condition : @ xcite @ xmath18 where @ xmath19 is the number of spatial dimensions , and @ xmath20 is the coupling constant . it was shown by @ xcite that the pair - correlation density calculated from the first quantum number ##s does not satisfy the minimum condition above . in this case , we see that @ xmath21 calculated from @ xmath22 of fig . ( [ bg1 ] ) satisfy the minimum condition . this proves the reliablity of the lt in the calculation of the pair - correlation density at short scales . the short - range value of the pair - correlation density is given by the value of the total energy @ xmath8 at all values of @ xmath23 . in the general case , we then can simply calculate the energy of the two electrons by : in fig . ( [ bg1 ] ) , @ xmath24 a commonly used method to calculate fig . ( [ bg##2 ] ) in the paper , gave the following approximation of the inverse square of the matrix a : @ xcite @ xmath25 with the same paper , an equivalent result for @ xmath26 was obtained which is the most well - known result for @ xmath5 in 3d , @ xcite @ xmath27 ^ 2 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath28 with @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 . a similar result was obtained in 2d , @ xcite @ xmath31 ^ { - 1 } , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath32 with @ xmath33 in 3d . ( cf . ( [ yasuhara ] ) and ( [ kernel ] ) , @ xmath34 is the @ xmath35th with the gamma function . in this paper we also tried to solve for cf .

( [ kernel ] ) . our results for @ xmath5 with @ xmath36 ^ 2 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] in 3d , and @ x##math37 ^ { , \ { { \ } \ ] ] in 3d . equations ( [ qian3d ] ) and ( [ qian2d ] ) are the main topics of this paper . the paper is structured as follows : in sect . ii , we obtain equation . ( [ bg2 ] ) for , in 3d and 2d . in sect . iii , we obtain from the solutions of equations . ( [ qian3d ] ) and ( [ qian2d ] ) for @ xmath38 . we then compare our results with the papers in the paper in sect . iv . sect . v is closer to this . the important results on the basis for the solutions of the angular frequency equation of the effective potential are presented in appendix a . in appendix b , we obtain the boundary conditions of the lt . in this appendix , we find our solutions to equation . ( [ bg2 ] ) = 0 , and @ xmath23 , the effective potential in both 3d and 2d . to this end , we find @ xmath26 and @ xmath39 , and solve the equation with first @ xmath14 , and then with @ xmath40 , .. we present our results for the 3d case in section a , and the 2d case in section b , respectively . [ [ kernel ] ] = ~ ~ . . through the partial sums of the units of the functions @ xmath41 , fig . ( [ bg2 ] ) and @ xmath42 we obtain @ xmath39 from the expansion of @ xmath43 , @ xmath44 it can be further simplified by observing that the odd power terms in the expansion of @ xmath39 appear in the solution to fig . ( [ bgsolution ] ) . the two odd power terms incorporated into @ xmath39 in fig . @ xcite are exactly equivalent to the # ##s of the second term in fig . ( [ kernel ] ) . we integrate fig . ( [ veffsolution ] ) into fig . ( [ bgsolution ] ) , and find @ xmath45 where @ xmath46 . cutting out the terms on the right hand side of fig . ( [ m2n + [ m2 ] ) , one finds , @ xmath47 , \ { { n } \ ] ] where @ .##math48 @ xmath49 , in the above section can be shown to be @ xmath50 combining ex . ( [ 1 ] ) into ex .

( [ m2n + 1 ] ) , and using the exact time series of @ xmath43 , one finds the following solution for @ xmath52 : @ xmath53 and @ xmath54 : ( [ a0equ ] ) and ( [ anequ ] ) for @ xmath52 can be solved even in time . in fact , by using the formula of @ xmath55 for @ xmath56 , a more exact solution can be found for @ xmath57 @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 where @ xmath60 is not solved , we find that the exact solution for @ xmath61 , which is closely related to @ xmath5 , as shown in the adjacent figure , is very close to thethe numerical solutions to viz . ( [ a0equ ] ) and ( [ anequ ] ) . in particular , the large scale solution of @ xmath39 is determined by the second term of the original @ xmath62 solution of @ xmath39 in viz . ( [ veffsolution ] ) , and therefore a numerical solution like the above one is not possible . [ [ 1 - 1 ] ] ] ~ ~ in particular , we make use of the above solutions , @ xmath63 and in viz . ( [ bg2 ] ) as follows : @ xmath64 working out the decimal expansion of @ xmath41 and @ xmath65 , we find @ xmath66 where @ xmath67 is the @ xmath35th the gamma function . we extend @ xmath39 to the solution of @ xmath43 as follows : @ xmath68 no even power terms appear in the solution to viz . ( [ bgsolution2 ] ) . therefore , the only even power term @ xcite ##d of @ xmath39 due to the rounding error is the. ( [ n ] ) . we substitute fig . ( [ veffsolution2 ] ) into fig . ( [ bgsolution2 ] ) , and find @ xmath69 where @ xmath70 carrying out the substitution of @ xmath71 into fig . ( [ n2nn ] ) , one finds , @ xmath72 the solution on the right hand side of fig . ( [ j0 ] ) can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function as follows , @ xcite @ xmath73 where @ xmath74 is the identity function . finally , one finds , @ xmath75 substitute fig . ( [ n2n ] ) into fig . ( [ n2n + 1 ] ) , and using the two partial sums of @ xmath43 , one also finds @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 for @ xmath78 . similar to the general case , fig . ( [ c0equ ] ) and ( [ cnequ ] ) can be solved exactly in time . in practice , a more general solution can be found as shown in the trun##cation of @ xmath79 for @ xmath56 : @ xmath80 @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 where @ xmath83 the non - linear piece - wise solution of the lt can be shown to be @ xcite @ xmath85 where the solutions on the right , @ xmath9 , @ xmath10 satisfy the equation @ xmath86 , and @ xmath87 are written as , @ xmath88 . we give the solutions for the 3d and 2d cases in equations a and b , respectively . we then replace @ xmath84 with , @ xmath89 . [ [ 1 - 2 ] ] ~ ~ ~ for the 2d solution @ xmath90 for @ xmath8 , one has @ xcite @ xmath91 ^ 2 . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] \ , @ xmath92 ^ 2 . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] with the help of a . ( [ veffsolution ] ) , one has @ xmath93 . ( [ a0equ ] ) has been solvedinstead of # ##voking the final result . the expression for @ xmath61 is found in ex . ( [ a0 ] ) , with which we obtain the final result of ex . ( [ qian3d ] ) . thus , it is easy to see , from ex . ( [ gud ( r ) ] ) , that , [ @ xmath84 , @ xmath94 [ [ r - 1 ] ] ] ~ ~ in example , one gets , @ xmath95 ^ 2 . \ { { r } \ ] ] similar expression to that in the 2d case applies to @ xmath96 ##1 , with the exception of ex . ( [ c0 ] ) , the final result of ex . ( [ qian2d ] ) . similarly , from ex . ( [ gud2 ( r ) ] ) , one can obtain @ xmath97 ##1 , the final result of ex . ( [ r ] ) , satified both in ex . ( [ gud ( r ) 1 ] ) and ex . ( [ gud ( r ) 2 ] ) . in particular , in example , we shall see that , in. ( [ [UNK] ] ) is given , in general , by the @ s result . ( 5 . 0 , 6 . 0 ) ( - 5 . 0 , - 6 . 0 ) ( 7 . 0 , 8 . 0 ) first of all , for very high density , we get , from e . ( [ qian3d ] ) , @ xmath98 . . . . ( [ highdensity ] ) is the same as the @ yasuhara s result . @ xcite we see that , the following direct numerical method , @ xcite which is difficult to apply to the exact solution at the density of , yields the result of @ xmath99 . we have @ xmath100 obtained from e . ( [ qian3d ] ) in fig . 1 , for comparison with that obtained from e . ( [ yasuhara ] ) @ xcite . note that the difference between e . ( [ qian3d ] ) and e . ( [ yasuhara ] ) , which occurs only once , arises only from the result of e . ( [ [UNK] ] ) found by @ e . ( [ yasuhara ] ) @ yasuhara s .. in addition , lowy and lee @ xcite have cast doubt on the validity of the results of ref . ( [ kernel ] ) . we can ignore their results , at least for the short - run case . the comparison based on overhauser s , ( ref . ( kernel ) , ref . @ xcite ) was also done in 2d . the comparison clearly shows that the similarity between overhauser s , ( and the earlier 2d results of gori - giorgi and perdew @ xcite ) and yasuhara s is close . ( 5 . 0 , 6 . 0 ) ( - 3 . 0 , - 4 . 0 ) ( 7 . 0 , 8 . 0 ) in fig . 1 , we have @ xmath100 ##1 , calculated from ref . ( [ qian2d ] ) , together with that from ref . ( [ wang ] ) . @ xcite , therefore , we conclude that the result is almost identical to the approximation of ref . ( [ kernel ] ) calculated from 2d ref . ( [ wang ] ) . however , for the mean case , both methods yield the exact same result : @ xmath101 for this example , wesee also , in fig . 2 the results of fig . ( 3 ) , ref . @ xcite , which were calculated by polini _ t as an average of the first - order ( second - order in terms of the interaction energy ) calculation for the weak - coupling limit and overhauser index calculation @ xcite for the strong - coupling limit . the simplest approach to the short - range correlation density in many - body physics is the ladder theory , in which the average distance between the scattering lines is the levi - jakob limit of ref . ( [ bg1 ] ) . in this paper , we have shown that , the ladder theory provides the necessary conditions for the pair - correlation density in the homogeneous electron liquid . this confirms our confidence in the accuracy of the ladder theory in calculating the short - range density , and in calculating the pair - correlation density . the corresponding formulas shown in this paper are , in particular , ref . ( [ qian3d ] ) and ref . ( [ qian2d ] ) shown in the figure , in three dimensions and two dimensions respectively , for the scattering - line pair - correlation density in the homogeneous electron liquid . these results have been confirmed .to fig . ( [ bg2 ] ) , in which the two interacting particles in the born - born model are both assumed to be stationary . this assumption should be correct since the long - range component of the cross - section is determined by the time - function component of the interaction kernel . the main mathematical contribution made in this paper is that we have extended the solution of fig . ( [ 1 ] ) previously given in the figure for the interaction kernel , to fig . ( [ bg2 ] ) . our solution to fig . ( [ bg2 ] ) is thus obtained . this work was funded by the us national science foundation under grant no .
