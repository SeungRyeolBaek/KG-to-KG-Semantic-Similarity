the main goal of the efar project ( wegner 1996 ; table 1 ) is to use the strong correlation between the local properties of early - type galaxies and all the fundamental parameters ( fp : djorgovski & smith 1987 , dressler 1987 ) to determine the distances to clusters of galaxies in order to determine their structure and the mass distribution at large distances . but these fundamental parameters also affect the local properties and evolutionary history of early - type galaxies . for example , renzini & ciotti ( 1993 ) showed that the tilt of the fp implies a change in mass - to - distance ratio @ xmath2 among ellipticals of less than a factor of two , while the relative tilt of the fp implies a change of @ xmath2 at a distance in the region of less than 1 % . this relationship has been used to determine the star formation rates of dwarf ellipticals using the colour magnitude relation ( smith 1992 , kodama & arimoto 1997 ) . both the fp , and colour magnitude relationships have been carried out to various distances and distances to show that the early - type galaxies observed in @ xmath9 @ xmath101 differ from late -for early - type galaxies in the sample consistent with their environmental conditions ( van dokkum & franx 1996 , ellis & bender 1997 , kelson 1997 , bender 1997 , kodama & arimoto 1997 , bender 1998 , kodama 1998 , bender 1998 , van dokkum 1998 ) . in this section we consider the relation between the radio frequency of @ xmath11 and the frequency of the mg line at the radio frequency of 5174 for the early - type galaxies in the efar sample . this relation relates the physical properties of the clusters with their stellar population . the relatively small uncertainty in this relation ( burstein 1988 , guzmn 1992 , bender 1993 , jrgensen 1996 , bender 1998 ) , and its time - dependent nature , make it a very useful tool for analysis of the star formation history of early - type galaxies and to account for environmental conditions in the fp ( burstein 1988 , bender 1996 ) . there are , however , several problems with determining the parameters for early star clusters . two of these problems are derived from the stellar population data ( worthey 1994 , vazdekis 1996 ) : ( 1 ) the temperature and metallicity due to the gas linestrengths in the2 , meaning that the variation of linestrengths could be due to either a range of ages or a range of metallicities in any combination ; ( 2 ) the mg linestrengths are not always stable : at constant metallicity a difference in mass of a difference of 1 dex results in a change of 0 . 05 - 0 . 05 mag , and at fixed mass a difference of 1 dex for metallicity yields a change of 0 . 05 . 5 mag . therefore , linestrength measurements must be made in order to provide accurate information on the ages and metallicities of stellar populations , and the relation on its basis can only remove information on degrees of age and metallicity and treating one or the other differently . david trager ( 1997 ) has suggested that the validity of the relation may be the result of a ` paradox ' , in that there appears to be an anti - correlation between the ages and metallicities of the stellar populations of g - type stars of fixed mass which helps to explain the variation in the mg linestrengths . trager takes the ages data @ xmath12 , ma and mg linestrengths from gonzlez ( 1993 ) and uses the stellar population data of worthey ( 1994 ) to calculate ages andand from line breaks with significant effects on age and metallicity . he found that in the observed distribution the ages and ages vary in a region of a high precision linestrength , allowing him to predict a change in the ages , for small changes in age and metallicity a factor of 10 in magnitude ( from 0 . 1 gyr to 10 gyr ) and a factor of of about 0 . 010 . 02 ##0 . this prediction depends on the validity of the current galaxy data , and its verification from the high - precision linestrength data . it can also be verified from the high - precision data now currently available . in a similar vein , a number of studies ( ferreras 1998 , shioya & bekki 1998 , smith 1998 ) have recently re - examined whether the observed slow evolution of the colour temperature relation corresponding to @ xmath9 @ xmath101 * has a high significance for the origin of the star - formation of older galaxies . they found that in general this evolution would be consistent with a very slow distribution of ages and metallicities if the galaxies of more young were on average more metal - poor than the galaxies of comparable age . as such ,although based on the structure of the galaxy cluster , there have also been reports of apparent interactions with the environment . guzmn ( 1992 ) has found that there are systematic differences in the data which challenge estimates of the distances based on the fp . they find a significant difference in the zeropoint of the distance between galaxies in the center of the galaxy cluster and galaxies in the galactic center . jrgensen and co - workers ( 1996 , 1997 ) study a number of galaxy clusters and find a strong correlation between the linestrength and the environment of the cluster which is consistent with this observation . similar relationships were found for field and cluster ellipticals by de carvalho & djorgovski ( 1992 ) and jrgensen ( 1997 ) , although burstein ( 1990 ) found no evidence of such interactions . these apparent interactions could result from different star - formation events , different temperature ranges , or variations in the mass - to - density ratio of the galaxy population . fp distance measurements would also be subject to environment - related measurement errors due to missing data ##ities . where data for field and cluster ellipticals come from other sources , however , the possibility still exists that the zeropoint differences are due to differences in the relative distances rather thanand other effects . the relation has since become an important tool for studies of both the star formation rate and the proper motion of individual galaxies . first we examine the data from the efar survey , which includes more than 100 early - type galaxies collected from galaxy clusters over a wide range of distances . in 2 we examine the physical properties of the data and the methods used to calculate the and linestrength values , the radial velocity distribution @ xmath11 , and the errors in these measurements . we examine the relation between clusters and see how it varies from cluster to cluster in our sample , and with the central concentration , x - ray absorption and x - ray emission . in 4 we compare our results with the rest of the model , in order to determine constraints on the ages , metallicities and mass - to - charge ratio of early - type galaxies and clusters . in 5 , we examine the constraints on the variation of the ages and metallicities from the observed effects of the sample on its neighbors , and in particular with the observed variation of the fp . our conclusions are reached in 1 . here we give a detailed description of our model and dataset , with constraints on the central concentration and theis described in this article . the interested parties can see more information on the sample described in paper 1 ( wegner 1996 ) ; on the structure , composition and error correction methods for the sample described in paper 2 ( wegner 1998 ) ; and on the physical and optical properties of the sample in paper 3 ( saglia 1997 ) . the efar sample of galaxies comprises 736 ##2 early - type galaxies in 13 clusters . these galaxies have a range of sizes and distances in all directions toward the aurora borealis and gamma ray , at distances of between 6000 and 15000 . in addition to this large group we have also included other well - known galaxies including hercules , hercules and the sculptor in order to provide a useful guide to other sources . the efar galaxies are described in paper 2 of paper 1 , and are an extremely mass - dense group of galaxies smaller than about 1 cm with the notable exception of ellipticals . infrared spectroscopy ( paper 2 ) shows that 3 % are ob , 5 % are type ia and 2 % are late - type ob / s0s ; about 69 % of the galaxies are early - type galaxies , with the remaining 31 % being spiral and barred galaxies .we have performed surveys for 666 individual galaxies , measuring distances , velocity variations and linestrength ##s ( figure 1 ) . we have combined the data we measured here with the data for the clusters in the sample in order to assign these galaxies to the cluster . we have used the measured cluster ##s for these physical clusters to measure cluster ##ing ##ress and velocity variations . the early - type galaxies in our sample have a wide range of shapes , size and mass : they have apparent ages from @ xmath13 = @ xmath824 to @ xmath818 ( @ xmath14 = @ xmath821 . 5 ; and @ xmath15 = 50kms @ xmath16mpc @ xmath16 ) , mean masses from 1 to 70 ( @ xmath17 = 70 . 5 ) and mean velocity variations from less than 1 to > 220 ( @ xmath18 = 220 ) . the sample is largely dominated by early - type galaxies with shapes , sizes and masses typical of giant ellipticals . we present here the methods used in determining the clusters##hifts , galaxies , and other linestrengths ; the results are given in table 2 . = energy and velocity values , calculated from the same source , using the iraf and fxcor . linestrength based on the solar system was defined by the definition given by gonzlez ( 1993 ) . the and indices were also chosen : because it was the one most widely used in scientific papers , and because it could be used for greater precision ( since it has a wider frequency range ) and is well - defined ( being less prone to error than the non - defined ##ity limit ) . we find it more convenient to measure the ` atomic ' index in degrees and the ` molecular ' index rather than with the angular scale in ngstroms , since this puts these two indices on equal footing . the index is @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 is the maximum bandpass ( 0 . 5 for ) . the results for this method were obtained from numerical monte carlo simulations , and by comparison of the measurement results with the results obtained from previous comparisons ( over 90 % of our samples had at least two bands missing ) . different types of corrections were made to the index and linestreng##ths : ( i ) an error correction , based on that of jrgensen ( 1995 ) , to account for different rms errors in different parts of the system simultaneously , and ( ii ) a systematic way to compare rms errors across different measurement systems . after making these corrections , the measurements for each quantity are compared using a classification system based on the rms error and the measured value of the measurements . = = the corresponding rms errors for the three measured quantities are @ xmath21 ( @ xmath22 dex ) , @ xmath23 mag and @ xmath24 mag . the distribution of rms errors for each quantity is shown in the upper panel of the [ figure : errsum ] . the lower panel of the figure shows how the rms errors are compared against the repeat observations : the distribution of the ratio of rms error to predicted errors for quantities with rms errors is similar to the predicted errors . the rms errors are the predicted values . the rms error estimates from the model have been re - scaled to give the best fit ( with a maximum - error limit ) to the rms errors from the repeat observations . the re - scaling by factors of 0 . 5 and 0 . 5 respectively gives an estimate for the error . @ xmat##h11 and ; = 0 . 005 . ##s provide consistent values for the parameters observed . the comparison with the data ( paper 2 , figure 1 ) shows that our measurements are consistent with the measurements by smith ( 1987 ) , guzmn ( 1993 ) , jrgensen ( 1997 ) , lucey ( 1997 ) and whitmore ( 1985 ) . for the set of observations in question , we compare our linestrengths with the original lick system measurements of trager ( 1998 ) in order to obtain the necessary zeropoint values needed to fit our measurements to the lick system ( paper 2 , figures 14 & 15 ) ; the comparison of our measurements with those of lucey ( 1997 ) also shows consistency ( paper 2 , figure 1 ) . in this section we discuss the linear relation found amongst the small number of efar ##s with e - type morphological parameters ( cd , cd , cd / s0 ; see section in figure 1 ) for which we need linestrength values . the relation is shown in figure [ fig : mgsig ] a and the relation in figure [ fig : mgsig ] b . in order to obtain linear relations with morphological parameters in the absence of significant rounding or in other cases , weanalysis of the dataset and the new model fitting algorithm , we have developed a new maximum likelihood ( ml ) fitting algorithm ( saglia , in italian ) . for galaxies with distances greater than 100or and of less than 1 % , and for galaxies with low distances , the ml fit to the model ( 490 galaxies ) and the data ( 423 galaxies ) are : @ xmath25 these lines are shown in figure [ fig : mgsig ] as dashed lines . the distribution of the values of these lines is given with the - notation we published in figure 1 : @ xmath61 . 05 @ xmath80 . 05 . monte carlo analysis of the dataset and the data , the results of which are shown in figure [ fig : mgsigsim ] , show that there is no bias between the measured values of the poles and zeropoints , and give accurate estimates of the bias in the model . = + = the ml fit can be converted to a regression of and : @ xmath26 . these lines are shown in the figure as dashed lines , and on : @ xmath27 as expected , the simple regression gives results which are accurate , compared to theobservations in the range of values in the data as well as the distribution , and of the large errors in the data . other non - accurate fits are obtained using least squares fit to the velocity distribution ( jrgensen 1996 ) : @ xmath28 these least squares fits and their parameters are estimated using the linear regression method developed by a . l . feigelson and improved by isobe ( 1990 ) and feigelson & colleagues ( 1992 ) . the fits are under - estimated because these estimates do not fully account for the sampling error and the sampling bias . we know that the estimates of the parameters of the relationship are likely to be incorrect , whenever the dataset being analyzed has large errors in the velocity distribution ( which is usually the case ) . so we estimate the ml fits to the relationships . the values of the parameters of and of the ml fits are given in the references to both [ fig : mgsig ] a and [ fig : mgsig ] b . in order to estimate the number of errors , we first estimate the values of the fits over only the area covered by the first 1 % of the data ##set . we obtain ._ intrinsic _ values of 0 . 022 @ xmath290 . 002 mag about the relation and 0 . 031 @ xmath290 . 003 mag about the relation . despite this , the families of coefficients are very well represented as gaussians parametrised by the median error and the mean squared error . there is also evidence for a tail of intrinsic values , as shown by burstein ( 1988 ) and jrgensen ( 1996 ) . as the latter authors point out , the existence of such a tail is related to the slope dependence of the model . the large ellipticals do , however , have very large _ linestrengths for their radial velocity ( schweizer 1990 ) . the values of the _ intrinsic _ values for the coefficients that are predicted by the best model can be affected by large or small deviation of the observed distribution of velocity in the model from the standard model . we can abandon the assumption of an underlying linear velocity distribution in the model and use monte carlo methods based on the observed distribution of coefficients and linestrengths and their median error ( accounting for the mean errors and error )2 ) . these models assume , that there is a unique linear distribution for which there is no intrinsic distribution . we model this intrinsic distribution and get the best estimate of the intrinsic distribution from the estimates ( the half - squares of the first 1 % of the data ) for the observed data . the results of these models are shown in table [ fig : mgscat ] , which shows the maximum likelihood ratio for the intrinsic distribution , and shows the intrinsic distribution . we note that to account for the linear distribution in the model we need an intrinsic distribution of 0 . 016 @ xmath290 . 001 mag for and 0 . 023 @ xmath290 . 002 mag for . the fit of the relation ##atter , to the intrinsic distribution , is much better than that from the linear distribution , @ xmath61 . 001 @ xmath80 . 05 ( see figure 1 ) . = . table of the tables [ , = " < , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] = = table [ fig : mgsig ] shows our fit to the data given by the relation , and shows the intrinsic . @ xmath30mg @ xmat##h31 and the sample cd @ xmath30mg @ xmath32 in the fig are in this case . for the and the values we obtain are about 50 % higher than those obtained by the other methods . this is not due to the bias in our results , but rather from our use of the linear approximation rather than regression . in this case we are biased towards higher values than the other values because they ignore the random ##ness , the presence of errors in the models and the overall bias of the dataset . the linear and regression approximation ##s to our results , which our method can re - estimate the values of the cds , yield values very similar to those obtained by other methods . if we divide the cd by the features , we find that the cds have a zeropoint which is 0 . 009 mag higher than that of the other h - type galaxies above , and 0 . 014 mag lower than . these differences in the zeropoints are also reflected in the lack of information about the galaxy structure ( see the references to the [ ref : mgsig ] a & b ) , and are estimated at the cd @ xmath11 - 12 . all these zeropoint values , including and including the cd ,the method increases the ml fit by more than the average , so they make up only 10 % of the total data . we find a systematic error , however , if we consider the data for the two regions of interest , the hercules - corona - borealis and hercules - hercules - corona regions , from which our data are derived . the two regions have relationships with slope and zeropoints which are consistent both with each other and with the ml fit , so to say that there are no significant observed data differences between these two regions . we do not have enough data per cluster to measure both the slope and the zeropoint of the relationship on a cluster - to - cluster basis , even for our well - known clusters . we therefore limit ourselves to measuring the relationships at the zeropoint . to this end we compare the observed variation to and from the ml fit described above for the clusters with three or more linestrength measurements ( 75 % for and 75 for ) . note that we only sample clusters that are group ##ed based on their properties ( see table above ) . the relationships are not consistent even if we sampled all clusters , but only clusters with three or more measurements . = = the top right of the [ source : mgclus ]plot these zeropoint values as a function of the index - n ( n ) , and the top panels show the distribution of the offset ##s . the best - measured variation of the zeropoint offset is 0 . 012 @ xmath290 . 002 mag in and 0 . 019 @ xmath290 . 004 mag out , showing that the values are completely consistent among the thousands of clusters in the efar model . the bottom panels of the model show the offset distribution as a function of distance , showing that there is no dependence of the offset on the distance to the cluster . this variation of the zeropoint offset could also be a variation of the cluster - to - cluster variation in the above model , but it could also be a variation of the zeropoint of the relation from cluster to cluster . these problems are solved by repeating the process described in the previous section , adding a new type of variation to the model in the form of an intrinsic variation of clusters at the zeropoint of the relation . for simplicity we assume that this variation also has a normal distribution . we note that if we make the general assumption that there is cluster - to - cluster variation with no intrinsic variation##atter for galaxies in a cluster , the zeropoint variation between galaxies with an rms of 0 . 009 mag in and 0 . 015 mag in is required to recover the observed galaxy - to - cluster ratio . however this method under - estimates the observed variation about the global relation , with 0 . 017 @ xmath290 . 001 mag for and 0 . 025 @ xmath290 . 002 mag for compared to the actual values of 0 . 022 @ xmath290 . 002 mag and 0 . 031 @ xmath290 . 003 mag . on the other hand , if we assume that there is a zeropoint variation between galaxies , then the observed variation between galaxies required to recover the actual values about the global relation ( 0 . 016 mag in and 0 . 023 mag in ; see next section ) is a variation about the actual zeropoints of 0 . 012 @ xmath290 . 001 mag for and 0 . 016 @ xmath290 . 002 mag for , which is consistent with the actual values of 0 . 012 @ xmath290 . 002 mag and 0 . 019 @ xmath29##0 . 004 is from the above table . we conclude that there is no explanation for the observed zeropoint differences between clusters , since using a mass sample directly from a nearby galaxy and with a mass associated with the cluster cannot account for the zeropoint differences between our clusters . since there is very little variation in the zeropoint of the data from cluster to cluster , it follows that there must be at least only a small influence of the zeropoint on the mass of the cluster . next we consider the influence of cluster mass on the physical properties as measured from the zeropoints , including the velocity variations , x - ray spectra and x - ray temperatures ( all independent of cluster mass ) . the velocity variations are from table 1 of table 1 , including those obtained from efar and from the zcat data ( huchra 1992 ; as of 1997 : 4 ) . x - ray spectra and temperatures are estimated for all of our galaxy clusters in the mass and time - series study of x - ray spectra of abell 1 ( ebeling ( 1996 ) based on rosat all - sky survey ) . the x - ray spectra are estimated to a high accuracy of about 90 % . in theto obtain similar results between the two mass distributions , we can use clusters with masses ranging from at least 10 million kg ; this method yields 23 clusters , all of which are in agreement with the x - y subsample . the [ ref : mgrich ] shows the nature of the correlation between values of @ xmath33 , @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 . using the spearman - correlation coefficient , we find that there is no significant correlation between the ratios and values of these quantities , and therefore no evidence for a change in the zeropoint of the ratios with cluster size . these relationships are well - fit relationships and their coefficients : @ xmath36 if we take a different approach , splitting the ratios into two subsamples with the cluster size of @ xmath37 and applying the ratios to the values of the high - @ xmath37 and low - @ xmath37 clusters respectively , we will find no significant change in the values of the zeropoints of the relations , which are consistent with the experimental data presented here . there are at least three important questions which can be answered by the following equations . \ ( 1 ) what are the upper limits of thelack of correlation between the mass of the cluster and the zeropoint of the relation for dwarf galaxies ? \ ( ii ) what effect do the relative mass changes caused by the small variations in the relation have on fundamental plane estimates of peculiar and the ##ities ? \ ( iii ) what effect does the relative uncertainty of the relation have on the estimates of mass , metallicity and mass - to - distance ratios amongst early - type galaxies within clusters ? \ ( iv ) what do effects on these estimates result from comparing the uncertainty of the relation with the intrinsic uncertainty about the fundamental plane ? the small variation in the zeropoint of the relation from cluster to cluster , and in particular the lack of correlation between the zeropoint and the cluster mass , seem to indicate that the - and - abundance at mpc ##n at which an early - type galaxy is observed has no correlation with its stellar population and star - formation rates . the uncertainty of the relation with cluster mass had already been observed in a number of dwarf galaxy clusters by jrgensen ( 1996 ) and jrgensen ( 1997 ) . following guzmn ( 1992 ) , these studies looked for a number of problems with the ` stellar population ' _ of _ clusters . the uncertainty of thealso there is @ xmath38 , where @ xmath39 is the true distance of the cluster from the cluster centre . since @ xmath39 is only a lower bound on the galaxy clusters ' distance from the cluster centre , this is a very close approximation of the true local density . jrgensen showed that the data _ shows at [ trend0 . 009 ( jrgensen , priv . comm . ) ] with local density , @ xmath40 . since the values of _ they _ correlation with mass of the cluster ( see figure 5 of jrgensen ( 1997 ) ) , and _ they _ show a strong correlation with cluster mass , , @ xmath41 ( least - squares fit to the data in figure 5 of jrgensen ( 1997 ) ) , we would say that a more accurate interpretation of their result is a correlation of zeropoint with the cluster mass rather than local density . the distribution of this data is also consistent at the @ @ xmath11 level with the distribution of x versus @ xmath33 for the efar model ( see also [ eqn : clusfitmg2 ] ) ; using jrgensen ' s viathe relation has a variation which is consistent at the 0 . 5 @ xmath11 level with mass [ eqn : clusfitmgb ] . we note that the correlation between the relation zeropoint and the cluster mass is so small ( of 1 @ xmath42 or less ) that it is not well known from the experimental data , which is consistent with no correlation at all . semi - empirical models for the evolution of cluster galaxies , which previously ignored metallicity effects ( see kauffmann 1996 , baugh 1996 ) , are also now able to predict chemical enrichment and to predict the physical properties of the observed mass distributions and properties ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) . in addition , there are as yet no theoretical bounds for the variation of the relation zeropoint with cluster mass . the data given above , together with limits on the distance between zeropoints for field and cluster ellipticals ( burstein 1990 , de carvalho & djorgovski 1992 , jrgensen 1997 ) , should provide some useful information and allow the development of chemical enrichment models in a theoretical framework for field and cluster galaxies . we also consider the limits on fp - dependence of the distance between the observed nuclei of early - type galaxies from theto us . in [ ssec : clusvars ] we found that the observed cluster - to - cluster variations in the zeropoint were consistent with having a good global relation with intrinsic variation between clusters , and did not _ allow _ for variation between clusters . so we turn the question around and ask how much _ cluster - to - cluster variation is _ caused _ by the observations . from , using the data given in [ ssec : clusvars ] , using intrinsic variation both between galaxies and between clusters , we found that the observed cluster - to - cluster size variation in the observed @ xmath11 range and the variation between the global relation and the observed zeropoints is between 0 . 005 mag in and 0 . 010 mag in . for our best - fit global relation and the fp estimate of @ xmath39 @ xmath43 @ xmath44 with @ xmath45 @ xmath61 . however , this type of cluster - to - cluster variation would lead to rms errors in fp distance estimates of up to 50 % . these rms errors , resulting from variations in the observed local distribution of galaxies , would apply only to clusters for which the fp estimateerrors due to stellar population differences between clusters have been considered only by the individual galaxies in the past . we note that our results _ do not _ make _ a cluster - to - cluster comparison , but are _ inconsistent _ with cluster - to - cluster comparisons due to _ systematic differences between clusters with an rms of up to 50 % . we therefore do not conclude from the results _ of _ whether systematic differences in the relative stellar populations of clusters contribute any ( if at all ) to the error in fp estimates of distance and radial velocity . a more direct method of testing for _ systematic differences is by simply comparing cluster ' s zeropoint distance from the cluster center to the sum of the fp and global distance estimates ; this comparison will be used in a subsequent paper . to answer the questions about the relative size , metallicity and mass - to - radius ratio of early - type galaxies which were raised at the time of this paper , we need to use stellar population models . we use the data from the original stellar population models of worthey ( 1994 ) and vazdekis ( 1996 ) , and the various comments made by these authors about their results . to do our calculations , we need , and @ xmath##46 a good combination of both age ( @ xmath47 , with @ xmath48 1 gyr ) and metallicity ( @ xmath49 ) , for samples with ages greater than 1 gyr and metallicities in the range @ xmath80 . 5 to @ xmath500 . 5 . for the model of worthey ( 1994 ; salpeter 1995 ) we have @ xmath51 . [ source : mgbmlrw ] compare this model to worthey ##s model in the terms of the relative dependence of and @ xmath46 on age and metallicity . the comparison shows that for samples of 1 gyr or more the model and the model are in good agreement for both metallicities . = for the model of vazdekis ( 1996 ; best fit , @ xmath52 = 1 . 5 ) we have @ xmath53 in agreement with the model given by jrgensen ( 1997 ) . there is good agreement between the results of the two models for the dependence of and on age and metallicity , and also good agreement for the results of @ xmath54 . note that the observed change in the two models is caused by changes in and , @xmath55 , and metallicity , @ xmath56 , if @ xmath57 . this follows the ` 3 / 4 law ' of worthey ( 1994 ) , which applies to all of the mg - models , rendering them invariant with respect to changes in age and metallicity . the age and metallicity have the differential ratio , @ xmath46 , if @ xmath58 = 3 / 4 , so that measurements of mass - to - age ratio can in turn be combined with the linestrengths to determine the age / metallicity ratio . in the following section we calculate the changes in the ages and metallicities of g - type stars by measuring the sum of the data with the sum of the two stellar population models given in the previous section . this section uses the stellar population model to calculate the changes in the distribution of mass , and their relative distribution . it is also important to note that by the change in age and metallicity we calculate the change in these quantities at time @ xmath26 or , equivalently , the period since the initial observation with @ xmath26 being accounted for . by the change in age and metallicitywe see only the distribution of the galaxy mass , and the distribution of ages and metallicities as a function of the mass ( which is related to the mass of the spiral and the number of stars in it ) . the stellar population , represented by ( amongst other things ) a known mass and a known metallicity may also be an approximation to other galaxies , whose stellar populations may also have a distribution ( and possibly a wider range ) of ages and metallicities . since the galactic mass distribution can be very similar to the global metallicity distribution ( greggio 1997 ) , many of the variations we see may be due to galaxy - to - galaxy variations in the size of the metallicity , rather than to variations of the galaxy metallicity or age . a further example is provided by the over - abundance of mg with respect to sun ( compared to the normal abundance ) in the spectra of g - type stars ( peletier 1989 , smith 1990 , worthey 1992 ) . as a result of the [ fig : mgsig ] & [ fig : mgbmlrw ] above , the models presented in the previous section are unable to account for the many known mg linestrengths . tantalo ( 1998 ) gives a similarsample size , and the population of [ mg / fe ] , and such that @ xmath59 + 0 . 089 \ delta \ log z + 0 . 166 \ delta \ log z / { _ \ odot \ { { eqn : tantalo } \ ] ] combining this data with those above , we find that the observed relationship between age and metallicity is similar to that described by worthey ( 1994 ) and vazdekis ( 1996 ) . thus , the intrinsic variability in the [ mg / fe ] @ xmath11 data will contribute significantly to the intrinsic variability of the data and to the variation in age and metallicity needed to account for the effect . for these reasons , and also because of other possible sources of intrinsic variability such as dark matter , radiation , gravity , tidal effects and orbital symmetry , the effects of the variation in age and metallicity given above should be taken as upper bounds . with these considerations in mind , we want to use the data as described in the previous section to estimate the variation in age and metallicity based on the observed intrinsic variability of 0 . 016 mag in and 0 . 023 mag out . for .of course we have the variation in age and metallicity and the intrinsic values @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 . in comparing the data to what follows , we take the sum of the values for the observed variables and calculate the variation in age and metallicity according to the intrinsic assumptions of the model . then the intrinsic values derived from the model would yield values that are @ xmath1030 % error , since the mean value of the intrinsic values is @ xmath62 @ xmath61 . 1 , rather than . 1 as would be expected either from the observed data or from the model . we use the # ##s rather than because our objective is to analyze the data on the variation in age and metallicity . the observed variations in the intrinsic values correspond to variations in the mean of 510 % . if the variations in the cell size are the sole source of variation then the variation in age is @ xmath3 = 43 % , whereas if metallicity variations are the sole source then the variation in metallicity is @ xmath4 = 43 % . therefore , the observed variation in the absolute zeropointfor the cd , note that these galaxies are either less or more metal - rich than typical e or e / s0 galaxies . if the zeropoint differences are interpreted as age differences , cds are on average 10 % higher than typical e or e / s0 galaxies ( as high as the most early - type galaxies ) ; if the zeropoint differences are interpreted as metallicity differences , cds have metallicities on average 20 % higher than typical e or e / s0 galaxies ( as high as the most metal - rich late - type galaxies ) . we can then use the relation above to calculate the observed change in @ xmath54 due to the change in the mg line density . if these changes are caused by age differences only , then we have that @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 ; if , however , they are due only to differences in metallicity we have @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 . thus the change in @ xmath67 is about 10 % larger if the observed change in the mg lines is due to age differences rather than metallicity differences . the slight change in the density suggests a mass - mass - to - charge ratio of 10 % if due to age differences , but the50 % if due to metallicity change . this effective distance in @ xmath2 is in fact the difference between distance and surface brightness ( since that is what the models deal with ) . we can more fully understand the dependence of this distance on distance given by the uncertainty principle ( fp ) if the distance in @ xmath2 is consistent with the effective distances and brightness , as it is the case for the efar model ( at least for models with @ xmath11 @ xmath68100 ) . for the fp given by @ xmath39 @ xmath43 @ xmath69 , with @ xmath39 the effective distance and @ xmath70 the estimated surface brightness at this distance , if the distance in @ xmath2 is exactly the distance in @ xmath70 we get @ xmath71 . all models of the fp , including our own , use @ xmath72 ( dressler 1987 , jrgensen 1996 , saglia 1998 ) . combining this information with the dependence of @ xmath2 on the spectral line distance given above , we find that the distance isthe relation leads to an intrinsic variation in galaxy population away from the fp of 5 % if due to age variations , or 10 % if due to metallicity variations . since the intrinsic variation in the fp is assumed to be in the range 1020 % ( djorgovski & smith 1987 , jrgensen 1993 , jrgensen 1996 ) , we need to consider both the variation in the relation and the variation in the fp as the result of age variations alone and metallicity variations alone ( unless the underlying galaxy population models are correct and there are no galaxy - to - galaxy variations in the metallicity distribution ) . various combinations of age variations and metallicity variations _ _ _ , however , account for the large intrinsic variation in both the and fp distributions . as a simple example , we assume that the variation in the fp and the relation ( all except @ xmath26 ) is also due to variations in age and metallicity ( at different galaxy distances ) . these distributions are then assumed to be probability distributions : @ xmath47 and @ xmath49 with s @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 and # ##s @ xmath7 ( @ x##math81 @ xmath75 @ xmath7 @ xmath751 ) . while the linear distribution of metallicities for fixed stellar masses is a good alternative model for observed changes in the iron abundance ##s , the non - variable version of the linear lognormal distribution for the stellar ages does not accurately predict the star - formation rate ( even for galaxies of the same mass ) . the variation in ages observed under this assumption should therefore be taken seriously as a reliable indicator of the time - scale at which early - type galaxies of different masses formed the majority of their stellar populations . using the coefficients in the linestrengths and fp coefficients in @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 and the coefficients of @ xmath47 and @ xmath78 , @ xmath79 and @ xmath80 , this simplified formula relates the variation in the latter coefficients to the variation in age and metallicity coefficients : @ xmath81 , @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 are the coefficients of @ xmath47 and @ xmath78 for both , and @ xmath##84 and @ xmath85 the constraints for @ xmath86 , come from the sum of the two solutions to the two corresponding density equations given in [ ssec : data ] . = = = [ fig : figure ] . the constraints on the variations in age and metallicity ( known for long to be constant ) which are given by the predicted intrinsic distribution in the relation and the intrinsic distribution in @ xmath46 come from the intrinsic distribution in the fp . the intrinsic distribution we derive from the and model is then associated with variations in age and metallicity in the same orbit given by the [ eqn : modelmg ] ( with @ xmath7 = 1 ) in the @ xmath3 @ xmath4 model . the corresponding constraints for and ( the two parameters in the [ fig : figure ] ) come from the difference between the expected ratio of the density corresponding to that density and the expected density from the model , and give an indication of variations both in the intrinsic distribution in the relation and about the parameter ##mg . the third constraint is then derived from the intrinsic distribution in and ( with @ xmath87 )and the fp is the [ eqn : modelfp ] ( consistent with @ xmath7 = 38 ) . the mg values in the [ ec : 2 ] correspond to a value in the fp of 10 % , 15 % and 20 % . the important thing to note in the figure is that , as shown in [ ssec : 1 ] , the effects of the two linestrengths and dark - to - light ratio on age and metallicity are very similar , so that ( if differences in age and metallicity are ignored ) the two sets of values are almost identical . but the part of the @ xmath5 @ xmath4 relationship that is consistent with the values in both the mg and the fp is very different . if we ignore the intrinsic error in the mg and only the 10 % intrinsic error of @ xmath87 about the fp ( at the bottom right of the table , see , , djorgovski & smith ( 1987 ) and jrgensen ( 1996 ) ) , we can obtain lower bounds on the differences in age and metallicity of @ xmath3 = 20 % and @ xmath4 = 20 % .if , however , we ignore the higher value of the latter and assume an intrinsic fp value of 10 % ( as used for example by jrgensen 1993 ) , then we have the intrinsic values of @ xmath3 = 10 % and @ xmath88 = 10 % . these values allow us to consider the relative importance of the differences in age and metallicity to the differences in the estimates derived from the fp . for the older data ( @ xmath30fp = 20 % , @ xmath30 = 0 . 016 % and @ xmath7 = 0 ) , where @ xmath3 = 20 % and @ xmath4 = 38 % , the age - based model assumes that the difference of age has the intrinsic fp value of 10 % and the variation in metallicity of 38 % . in fact for most of the wide range of variations in age and metallicity shown in figure [ 1 : 1 ] , it is the difference in age which explains the intrinsic value of the fp . thus for the lowest plausible age , and the highest plausible metallicity , ( @ xmath5 =40 % and @ xmath4 = 10 % , corresponding to @ xmath30fp = 10 % and @ xmath30 = 0 . 016 mag ) . the contribution to the fp ##n from the variation in metallicity has compared with the contribution from the variation in age . = the effects of the data are if there is a positive correlation ( or cross - correlation ) between the variations in age and metallicity . figure [ fig : x _ [UNK] ] shows how the values corresponding to the upper bounds @ xmath30fp = 10 % and @ xmath30 = 0 . 016 mag ( corresponding to the spectral lines in figure [ fig : [UNK] ] ) are obtained . the correlation coefficient @ xmath7 varies over the time range from @ xmath81 to [UNK] . note that for @ xmath89 we have @ xmath90 . the basic idea to get from this equation is that if the variations in age and metallicity have a correlation coefficient over the range @ xmath80 . for @ xmath91 @ xmath7 @ xmath911 , then the values of age and metallicity vary .and @ xmath296 % and @ xmath2912 % respectively are the values obtained from the above data . only if the age and metallicity data are strongly cross - correlated ( @ xmath7 @ xmath6 @ xmath81 ; the galaxies are more metal - rich ) can we find much better results , with a large spatial variation in both age and metallicity ( @ xmath3 as small as 50 % and @ xmath4 as large as 50 % ) . this conclusion is similar to that reached by ferreras ( 1998 ) , who found that the slow time evolution of the x ##ation spectrum observed in low - mass galaxies does not necessarily indicate a regular pattern of recent star - formation if the galaxies are on average more metal - rich . we can determine the degree of correlation between the variations in age and metallicity by examining the spatial distribution of stars in the and fp data . this result is shown for the efar data and for the [ ref : dmgdfp ] below . there is no evidence for a correlation between the two in this study ; the spearman - smith coefficient between the two is 0 . 084 , and is a factorand the corresponding @ xmath11 position . in order to estimate the observed distribution of values in the absence of the observed measurement error , we have performed monte carlo simulations of the efar data using the formula for the variation between age and metallicity described above . figure [ fig : dmgdfp ] b shows a distribution with @ xmath3 = 20 % and @ xmath4 = 20 % ; these are the values resulting from the intrinsic variation in the data and the fp distribution of 20 % when there is no correlation between age and metallicity . the observed distribution matches the observed distribution , although there is a small but significant cross - correlation between the two ( due to the absence of the intrinsic variation in the fp distribution ) which is not present in the efar data . after two computer simulations , a two - dimensional k - means analysis ( in 1992 ) found a combined probability of 99 . 1 % that this distribution and the observed distribution are the same . figure [ fig : dmgdfp ] c & d show the distributions for the cases where the intrinsic variation observed is due to age variation or metallicity variation . this distribution is consistent with the observed distribution , under the hypothesis that neither age normetallicity can be partially blamed for the correlation effect between the age and the fp . figures [ fig : dmgdfp ] g also show probability distributions for the cases where the changes in age and metallicity are correlated ( with @ xmath7 = + 1 , + 1 . 5 , @ xmath80 . 5 and @ xmath81 respectively ) . the perfectly correlated and perfectly non - correlated distributions are all consistent with the observed distribution . the figures [ fig : dmgdfp ] g show that a model with a high correlation between the and fp distributions , is possible when @ xmath7 = @ xmath80 . 5 . a two - dimensional t - test model has a predicted probability for 100 % cases of 99 . 5 % that this model and the observed distribution are the same . this relatively low probability may be a problem with the model , although this may also be due to the inconsistent ( the assumptions of this assumption differ between models with an rms of a factor of 10 ) or non - correlated distribution in the efar model . the point to be made is that a model with a high degree of non - correlation between age and metallicity tends to be .better consistent with the sample distribution than a distribution in which mass and metallicity are unknown . we have improved the results for g - type stars using the efar model . we use parameters and distributions ( like [ eqn : mlmgbp ] and [ eqn : mlmgtwo ] ) that have values about 50 % less than those used by the original authors . this variation arises not from the model itself but from an empirical statistical technique : we use a modified maximum likelihood method which also accounts for the variation caused by both the sample distribution , and the observed variation of the parameters and @ xmath11 . the _ intrinsic _ variation of the parameters is 0 . 022 mag in and 0 . 031 mag in ; the _ intrinsic _ variation of the sample distribution , obtained from monte carlo simulations , is 0 . 016 mag in and 0 . 023 mag out . with a few observations per cluster to fully understand the sample distribution for each cluster individually , we compare the values of the parameters to their absolute values in order to determine the variation of the zeropoint from cluster to cluster . we find that the zeropoint has no intrinsic variation for values of 0 . 012 mag in and out .019 % in , and that this observed scatter is consistent with the total number of galaxies present in the cluster being derived from a simple statistical correlation with the distance between clusters . note that the terms _ not _ describe _ intrinsic differences in the zeropoint between clusters . the _ error _ value for the observed distance between clusters corresponds to cluster - to - cluster systematic differences in fundamental plane distances and peculiar ##ities with an rms error of the - 010 % . we therefore can not determine from the data _ set _ whether systematic differences in the average angular distance between clusters contribute any ( if at all ) to the variation in distances and peculiar ##ities measured in the fundamental plane . we have also compared the variations in the relation with local properties . our observed data varies from poor clusters to clusters as well as galaxies , with velocity variation from 300 to 1000 and x - ray temperature of 0 . 38 @ xmath9210 @ xmath93ergs @ xmath16 . we do not find any significant variation of zeropoint with local velocity variation , x - ray distance or x - ray temperature , nor is there any significant variation in the relation . by comparing the data .the high - @ xmath37 cluster and low - @ xmath37 cluster exist . the determining factor in the amount of gas in these early - type galaxies ( and in the @ xmath45 - types and in their metallicity and star - formation rate in general ) is _ _ galaxy _ size and _ _ radius _ these authors place emphasis on semi - empirical models for the evolution of these galaxies , which are just enough to show cosmic age and should therefore be used to make accurate predictions for the structure of the universe with # ##ing . we use the hierarchical galaxy evolution model of worthey ( 1994 ) and vazdekis ( 1996 ) to determine upper limits on the relative variation of the ages , metallicities and @ xmath2 distances of early - type galaxies of known age in the overall structure of the early universe . we have an upper limit on the variation in @ xmath54 of 50 % if the variation there is due to age differences alone , and 50 % if it is due to metallicity differences alone . these lead to lower limits on the variation in the galaxy size away from the galactic source ( fp ) of 10 % ( age alone ) and 20 % ( metallicity alone) . since the total variation in the fp is estimated to be 1020 % , we can then ( in the framework of the fixed galaxy population model ) measure both the variation in the age and the variation in the fp as the sum of age variations alone and metallicity variations alone . we then consider the full range of variations in age and metallicity which are associated with the total intrinsic variation in both the and fp values . for a population model in which the galaxies have intrinsic age variations of @ xmath47 and @ xmath78 , we find the bounds of @ xmath3 = 20 % and @ xmath88 = 32 % of the total population . if the variations in age and metallicity are not independent , but have correlation with @ xmath7 , we find that as long as @ xmath7 is in the relation @ xmath80 . according to , these values of the variation in age and metallicity differ by approximately @ xmath296 % and @ xmath2912 % respectively . even if the age and metallicity variations are not co - correlated ( @ xmath7 @ xmath6 @ xmath##81 ) . we have even tighter upper bounds , with @ xmath3 as small as 50 % and @ xmath4 as large as 80 % . the value of the parameters from the and fp relationships is only partially consistent with the model with no correlation between age and metallicity , and is self - consistent with a model in which age and metallicity values are strongly cross - correlated ( @ xmath3 @ xmath640 % , @ xmath4 @ xmath650 % and @ xmath7 @ xmath6 @ xmath80 . 0 ) , with older galaxies being more metal - rich . tighter limits on the variation in age and metallicity amongst g - type galaxies of different ages will allow more accurate measurements of the parameters from the sky and the galactic center and allow better estimates for the effect of the spectral lines and mass - to - light ratio on age and metallicity . more accurate results can also be obtained by measuring the energy levels of the and fp relations at different temperatures , since the linestrengths and mass - to - light ratio have different effects on temperature . mmc has the support of the dist ##r working group. it was also supported by nato grant ast90 - 16930 . rld supports the hastings group and dr . de zeeuw . rkm received full support from nato grant ast90 -
