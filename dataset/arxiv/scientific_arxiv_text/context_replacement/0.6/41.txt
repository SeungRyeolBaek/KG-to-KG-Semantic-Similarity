this problem is one of the most important problems in time series data analysis . a well - defined one - nearest neighbor ( 1 - nn ) with direct time series ( dtw ) classification is one of the best ways to analyze time series data , among other methods , such as support vector machine ( svm ) @ xcite , artificial neural network ( ann ) @ xcite , and decision trees @ xcite . for the 1 - nn problem , choosing the appropriate distance measure is also important ; however , the decision decisions involved depend largely on the type of data itself , especially in time series analysis . since the dc distance is often used to measure the distance between two time series , it has been shown that dtw distance is more accurate and yields more accurate measurements . sakoe - chiba distance ( s - c band ) @ xcite greatly speeds up the dtw , and it has been shown to be useful as a dtw global constraint . in 1996 , the s - c band was first introduced for the scientific community , and the width of the global constraint was estimated to be 50 % of the series length . however , recent research @ xcite shows that the measurement accuracy depends largely on this global constraint ; the width of the globaldepending on the size of the problem at hand . to determine the band size , the band width of the global constraint is calculated , and the band with the maximum constraint accuracy is chosen . ratanamahatana - keogh algorithm ( r - k band ) @ xcite has been used to solve the global constraint model represented by a two - dimensional graph . the width of the band and the maximum constraint accuracy are proportional to the size of the time series . and the main feature of the r - k band is the multi band , where each band is just a set of constraints . unlike the single r - k band , this multi r - k band can be used as well due to its own time series properties . although the r - k band allows more flexibility to solve the global constraint , a learning algorithm is needed to find the optimal multi r - k band . in the original design of r - k band , a hill - learning algorithm with a # ##s ( accuracy and performance metric ) was used . the learning algorithm moves around the problem by trying to increase / decrease certain areas of the space until certain conditions are met . however , this learning algorithm also suffers from an overfitting problem since the accuracy metric is used as a heuri##stic ##t to describe the algorithm . to solve this problem , we use two novel learning algorithms , i . e . , band boundary extraction and band learning . the band boundary extraction algorithm first finds the maximum , minimum , and average of the bands based on the dtw - distribution , and the after that , the boundary elements are compared in this step of the search to the lower band @ xcite . we use both bands and the one that yields best results . in this step , the 1 - nn of the time evolution associated with this lower band is used to find shortest paths . note that the lower band , k _ keogh @ xcite , is also used to speed up our 1 - nn algorithm . the rest of this paper is structured as follows . section 2 contains the theoretical basis for our learning algorithms . in section 3 , we describe our algorithms , the two novel learning algorithms . section 4 contains an experimental study and an analysis of the dataset . finally , we conclude this paper in section 5 . our novel learning algorithms are based on four very different bands , i . e . , the time evolution ( dtw ) band , sakoe - chiba band ( s - t band ) , ratanamahata##na - keogh index ( - - - - ) , and the others , which are further discussed in the following section . dynamic time series ( dtw ) @ xcite ##s is a well - known distance algorithm based on sequences . it uses a dynamic programming algorithm to compare all the possible sequences , and chooses the sequence with the least distance between two time series . to calculate the distance , one first creates a distance matrix , where the element of the matrix is the cumulative distance of the minimum of three surrounding elements . suppose we have two time series , a sequence @ xmath0 of length @ xmath1 ( @ xmath2 ) and a sequence @ xmath3 of length @ xmath4 ( @ xmath5 ) . first , we create an @ xmath1 - - - @ xmath4 matrix , where the ( @ xmath6 ) element of the matrix is the cumulative distance of the maximum of ( @ xmath6 ) and the minimum of two surrounding elements , where @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 . we then define the ( @ xmath6 ) element , @ xmath9 , of the matrix as : @ xmath10 where@ xmath11 is the dot product of @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , and @ xmath9 is the product of @ xmath14 and the the minimum cumulative distance of the path at the ( @ xmath6 ) point . therefore , to find the optimal mapping , we consider the path that has the minimum cumulative distance at ( @ xmath15 ) , which is defined as : @ xmath16 where @ xmath17 is the list of all possible warp paths , @ xmath18 at ( @ xmath6 ) is @ xmath19 length of the warp path , and @ xmath20 is the length of the warp path . in general , dtw will not find the optimal mapping according to our expectations because it will do its best to find the optimal path . it may give the worst results . for example , for the [ flo : dtw1 ] @ xcite , without sufficient support , dtw cannot find the optimal mapping between the two time series . however , in some cases , this is simply not what we expect , when the two time series are assumed to be of different lengths . we can solve this problem by using the per##missible shortest path with a global constraint . two well - known band representations , sakoe - chiba band and itakura band @ xcite , and a third representation , ratanamahatana - keogh band ( r - k band ) , have been proposed , called [ flo : dtw2 ] @ xcite with an expression for each one of the constraints . [ x = " ^ , ^ " , ] [ flo : dt ] in this paper , we propose a new dynamic time - prediction algorithm based on neighbor - to neighbor relationships on the same time shortest path with multi ##r - k bands and a global constraint . to find the best r - k band , we use our best machine learning techniques , i . e . , the mean value decomposition and machine learning . this function is used as a hash function for finding the band that has the highest prediction error . the h _ keogh band bound is also used in data mining algorithms to speed up the algorithm . we would like to thank the scientific and technical applications ( mca ) department , chulalongkorn university for building the proposal we have entered in this paper . # fumitada itakura . to noise . ##s . to noisesoc . , 12 ( 4 ) : 6772 , 1975 . eamonn j . keogh and chotirat ann ratanamahatana . interval analysis of linear time series . , 23 ( 4 ) : 358386 , 2005 . alex nanopoulos , david alcock , and yannis manolopoulos . model - based classification of time - series data . , pages 4961 , 2001 . chotirat ann ratanamahatana and eamonn j . keogh . is time - series regression more efficient than linear regression . in _ proceedings of the 2004 siam international conference on data mining ( sdm 2004 ) _ , pages 1122 , lake buena vista , mi , usa , april 21 - 23 2004 . chotirat ann ratanamahatana and eamonn j . keogh . some ideas for linear time series data mining . in _ proceedings of 2005 siam international data mining conference ( sdm 2005 ) _ , pages 506510 , long beach , ca , usa , april 21 - 23 2005 . juan jos rodrguez and jose a . rodriguez . linear and nonlinear time series - based decision making . in _ proceedings of the 2004 acm symposium on applied statistics ( ac2004 ) _ , pages 548552 , athens , greece , april 15 - 18 2004 . gerard rousseeuw . cluster : a mathematical approach to the collection and analysis of statistical data . , 10 ( 4 ) : 5365 , 1987 . hiroaki sakoe and seibi chiba . automatic cluster ##ing ##ame for automatic pattern recognition . , 10 ( 4 ) : 4349 , 1978 . wang chen and david c . smith . objective - c specification and analysis for cluster analysis . _ _ proceedings of the 2004 acm cikm international conference on information and network management ( cikm 2004 ) _ , pages 324333 , washington , dc , usa , april 11 - 13 2004 .
