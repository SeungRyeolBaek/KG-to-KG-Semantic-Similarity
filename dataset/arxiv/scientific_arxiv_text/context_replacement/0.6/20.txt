the lep experiments at the poles of @ xmath1 - pole have extended the standard model ( sm ) at large scale , converting the @ xmath1 - spin into spin ##ons with an accuracy of one part every 10 minutes . the strong correlation of the lep experiments with the sm data has not restricted the generation of new particles at the @ xmath1 - pole . taking these results into account we can see that the physics of @ xmath1 - spin could still play the major role in the development of particle physics if the next generation @ xmath1 experiment ends up with the resulting @ xmath1 mass being orders of magnitude larger than that of the lep . this experiment can be compared with the gigaz experiment of the international linear accelerator ( ilc ) @ xcite . the ilc is a hybrid proton - proton accelerator with tunable beams going from @ xmath12 to @ xmath13 and two nuclei in the first stage , and the gigaz option contributes to the construction on top of the physics of @ xmath1 - spin of a nucleus to the first stage beam . with the required energy , @ xmath14, and the strong correlation between the origin of @ xmath1 - , @ xmath15 , and @ xmath16 @ xmath1 , can be measured in the computer simulation of @ xmath17 of gigaz , which means that the observed contribution to the branching ratios of @ xmath1 - decay can be increased from @ xmath18 at the lep to @ xmath19 at the gigaz @ xcite . in view of this , the @ xmath1 - decay ##s , especially the unusual and unexpected properties which are generally considered to be important to new physics , should be studied further to determine their relevance in the new physics . among the various @ xmath1 - reactions , the flavor violation ( fc ) processes were also extensively studied to determine the flavor properties of new physics @ xcite , and it was found that , although these processes are very limited in the laboratory , their branching ratios in new physics experiments can be greatly extended to @ xmath19 for neutron flavor violation reactions @ xcite and @ xmath20 for proton flavor violation reactions @ xcite . among the fc processes , the @ xmath1 - decay into the cl##ggs ##t ( t ) is a type of decay , that was previously studied , e . g . the decay @ xmath21 ( @ xmath22 ) with the decay @ xmath0 , a heavy higgs , was studied in @ xcite , the decay @ xmath23 was studied in the light higgs standard model ( 2hdm ) @ xcite and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @ xcite , and the decay @ xmath4 was studied in a different variant of @ xcite , in 2hdm @ xcite and again in mssm @ xcite . these results show that , in accordance with the kinematic nature of these processes in the universe , the rate of these decay cannot be as fast as @ xmath18 in particle physics models , which is outside the energy range of the gigaz . in this article , we extend the previous study of these processes to several other models and explore these processes further . we are guided by our previous study of the further versions of the mssm , such as the medium - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @ xcite and the medium minimal super##symmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @ xcite , where a light cp - odd higgs sector @ xmath0 with ground - state mass can also arise from the spontaneous breaking of some other gauge theories like @ xmath24 or peccei - quuin ##e @ xcite . these non - interacting supersymmetric theories will not only solve the @ xmath25 - problem , but also solve the mass problem by introducing such a light higgs sector @ xmath0 @ xcite . we are not surprised now that , with the recent experiments , the properties of the light higgs sector are more well known than before . but it is worth mentioning the above discussion . so far there is no mass - specific lower bound for the light higgs sector known . in the sm , it would be less than @ xmath26 gev , different from the standard model of the higgs sector in lep ##k . however , due to the more complex nature of the higgs sector and the nature of the sm , this lower bound may be somewhat lower compared to recent experiments , e . g . , for the cp - odd higgs sector @ xmath0 we have@ xmath27 gev in the nmssm @ xcite , @ xmath28 gev in the nmssm @ xcite , and @ xmath29 gev in the spin - free 2hdm ( l2hdm ) @ xcite . with such a strong cp - violating higgs decay , the anti - decay into one or more @ xmath0 models starts up . assuming that the light @ xmath30 is not subject to quantum theory , we in this way study the rare @ xmath1 - decay @ xmath6 ( @ xmath22 ) , @ xmath31 and @ xmath4 in a different manner for different models , including the type - i 2hdm @ xcite , the l2hdm @ xcite , the nmssm and the nmssm . in our work , we examine all the constraints on the light @ xmath0 from the different experimental results . this work is done as follows . in sec . ii we first discuss the various particle experimental results . in sec . iii we describe the consequences of the rare @ xmath1 - decay . in sec . iv we examine the constraints on the lightnew physics models . in fig . 1 we have the general formula for the decay rate of the n @ xmath1 - particles in these models . finally , the result is reached in ref . in the most basic model , the sm requires a higgs field to break the electroweak symmetry . as a result , the sm contains only one physical higgs , with its behavior being described by the free parameters . in new physics models , the higgs sector is often replaced by additional higgs fields and / or particles , and new , more exotic higgs fields are introduced , with the free parameters described below . the model 2hdm contains the @ xmath32 - higgs fields @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 , and with the breaking of cp - symmetry , the quantum states can be parameterized as @ xcite : @ xmath35 , \ dots { t } \ ] ] where @ xmath36 ( @ xmath37 ) are the dimensionless parameters , and @ xmath38 ( @ xmath39 ) are the parameters with free dimensions . after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the rest of this higgs sector contains the masslesstwo states , which are the spin components of @ xmath40 and @ xmath1 respectively , and three lower bound states : two cp - odd higgs particles @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 , one more cp - odd higgs particle @ xmath0 and a pair of neutral higgs particles @ xmath43 . for the coupling @ xmath44 with @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 being the free energy levels ( vev ) of @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 respectively , we use @ xmath47 as the coupling constant with @ xmath48 , and @ xmath49 as the phase factor that determines the energy distribution of the cp - odd higgs particles . the difference between the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm comes from the weak coupling of the higgs field to particle / particle . in the type - ii 2hdm , one higgs particle @ xmath34 generates the masses of up - type particles and the other particle @ xmath33 generates the masses of down - type particles and neutral particles ; thein the l2hdm the higgs interaction @ xmath33 couples only to nuclei and the other one @ xmath34 couples only to electrons . thus the strong coupling of @ xmath0 to nuclei in these two models is described by @ xcite @ xmath50 with @ xmath51 being the interaction . similarly , in the type - i 2hdm the @ xmath52 coupling and the @ xmath53 coupling can be further enhanced by @ xmath54 , but in the l2hdm only the @ xmath53 coupling is described by @ xmath55 . the interactions of the nmssm and the nmssm are described by their superpotentials and their symmetry - breaking properties , which are given by @ xcite @ xmath56 where @ xmath57 is the superpotential of the mssm without the @ xmath25 coupling , @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 are higgs - and - superfields with @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 being their coupling components respectively , @ xmath62 , @ xmath6##3 , @ xmath64 , @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 are soft breaking terms , and @ xmath68 and @ xmath69 are components of the higgs - field . with the superpotentials and the soft - breaking terms , we can obtain the higgs fields of the nmssm and the nmssm respectively . in the 2hdm , the higgs fields with the cp violation coefficients vanish and the corresponding eigenstates are obtained by computing the probability density matrix : @ xmath70 where the terms on the left side of the matrix are the components of @ xmath71 , @ xmath72 and @ xmath61 defined by @ xmath73 @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 are respectively the cp - even and cp - odd neutral higgs fields , @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 are the components defined by @ xmath1 and @ xmath78 , and @ xmath79 is the neutral higgs field . thus , the nmssm and nmssm are thecp - even higgs # , one cp - odd higgs # and one pair of odd higgs ##ons . in fact , the one cp - odd higgs @ xmath0 in these models is the combination of the free field @ xmath80 and the free field of , @ xmath81 , i . e . @ xmath82 and its contribution to low - mass interactions are also added to @ xmath83 . as for the heavier @ xmath0 , @ xmath84 is removed and the interactions are ignored . as a result , the interactions of @ xmath0 with the proton are described by @ xcite @ xmath85 i . e . the interaction does not occur when @ xmath86 is zero . just like the 2hdm where we choose the vevs of the higgs # as input parameters , we choose @ xmath68 , @ xmath69 , @ xmath87 , @ xmath88 , @ xmath66 and @ xmath89 as input parameters for the nmssm @ xcite and @ xmath68, @ xmath54 , @ xmath88 , @ xmath65 , @ xmath90 and @ xmath91 form the basis for the nmssm @ xcite . between the nmssm and the nmssm , three differences should be noted . the first is for the two models , there is an effective @ xmath92term , and the corresponding @ xmath25 ##0 ( @ xmath93 ) is effective when the breaking term of @ xmath59 is a vev . the second is , the nmssm is also known as the nmssm with @ xmath94 @ xcite , because the breaking term @ xmath95 and the corresponding breaking term @ xmath96 in the nmssm do not have strong interactions , except for the string - like higgs - interactions and the boundary conditions . and the third , because of the name , the nmssm has its own symmetry , which arises from the neutralino symmetry . for the model @ xmath97 , the neutralino rotation symmetry is given by @ xcite @ xmath98 where @ xmath99and @ xmath100 for @ xmath101 and @ xmath102 gaugino , respectively , @ xmath103 , @ xmath104 , @ xmath105 and @ xmath106 . by doing this , we can obtain the mass eigenstate of the particle neutralino @ xmath107 with one of the following : @ xcite @ xmath108 this result shows that @ xmath107 must be larger than the @ xmath109 gev for @ xmath110 ( from the mass to chargnio bound ) and @ xmath111 ( perturbativity bound ) . in the current supersymmetric model , @ xmath107 , the solar sparticle acts as the dark matter of the universe , but due to its singlino - like nature , it is difficult to manipulate it to get the correct density for the current model . finding the correct density of @ xmath107 plays a crucial role in determining the model parameters . for example , as shown by @ xcite , for @ xmath112 , there is a way to calculate thethe result is , and for the first particle , @ xmath107 is obtained by exchanging @ xmath1 ##d for @ xmath113 , or by exchanging a light cp - odd higgs particle @ xmath0 with one satisfying the condition @ xmath114 for @ xmath115 . for the second , @ xmath54 and @ xmath25 are required to be larger than , and @ xmath116 . because of this . ( [ 1 - exp ] ) a few @ xmath87 and @ xmath25 will exceed @ xmath117 to make the decay more difficult . the properties of the light cp - odd higgs particle @ xmath0 , such as its mass and charge , are also bound , since @ xmath0 plays an important role in @ xmath107 decay . the nature of the nmssm is also very complex , and this is explained in detail in @ xcite . in the type - i 2hdm , l2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , the particle @ xmath##1 - 4 @ xmath118 ( @ xmath22 ) , @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 all represented in the corresponding diagrams shown in fig . [ fig1 ] , fig . [ fig2 ] and fig . [ fig3 ] respectively . for these diagrams , the ground state @ xmath119 contains all the cp - violating higgs particles in the corresponding diagrams , i . e . @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 in type - 2 2hdm and l2hdm and @ xmath41 , @ xmath42 and @ xmath120 in nmssm and nmssm . in order to take into account the possible width effects of @ xmath119 in fig . [ fig1 ] ( b ) for @ xmath2 and fig . [ fig3 ] ( c ) for @ xmath11 , we have calculated all the decay ##s of @ xmath119 and have calculated the width effects of the decay . similarly to the decay @ xmath121 , two things should be considered . one thing , like the decay @ xmath6 and @ xmath11 ,this decay occurs only through loops mediated by holes / electrons in the type - ii 2hdm and l2hdm , and only by sparticles in the nmssm and nmssm . so in these cases the energy should be much higher than the other cases . the difference is due to cp - violating , loops mediated by holes / sleptons make no contribution to the decay @ xcite . in our case , this is reflected in the fact that the coupling constant of @ xmath122 differs from that of @ xmath123 by a negative amount ( see fig . ( [ asqsq ] ) ) , and as a result , the spin - free contributions to @ xmath121 are also ruled out . with respect to the second case @ xmath11 , we need more information . in the first case , this decay proceeds through the diagram shown in fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) , and therefore we would say that , as a general guide , it is best to just use the diagram from fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) . however , we notice that in the cases of the type - ii 2hdm and l2hdm, due to the cancelation of the corrections from if @ xmath119 in vs . [ fig3 ] ( 2 ) and , due to the potential coupling of @ xmath124 , ( i . e . greater than the electroweak coupling @ xmath125 ) , the radiative contributions from the higgs - mediated loops can be at the tree level , even when the tree level component of the decay , @ xmath126 , is @ xmath20 . on the other hand , we calculated the contributions from proton / proton - mediated loops can be safely neglected if @ xmath127 is the type - i 2hdm and the l2hdm . in the nmssm and the nmssm , besides the contributions from the higgs - and proton / proton - mediated loops , loops and sparticles such as poles , charginos and neutralinos can also contribute to the decay . we also calculated that the contributions from poles and charginos can be safely neglected if @ xmath127 . we also calculated because of using the neutralino ##s ( ) that there are errors in @ xmath128 .for ( ! ! ) and then they can be ignored altogether . since almost all the radiative interactions would make our overall calculations more difficult , we should include the most important contribution , namely that from higgs - string interactions , in all our calculations for the observed interactions . one can also understand the relative importance of the sparticle contribution to @ xmath11 as follows . we consider the small contribution which is provided by the @ xmath129 interaction ( @ xmath130 is the contribution in chirality basis ) and the @ xmath131 interaction in the system . because the @ xmath132 interaction violate the chirality of the system and the @ xmath133 interaction violate the chirality , to obtain non - trivial contributions to @ xmath11 from the two mixing , at least four chiral flippings are required , with two of them provided by @ xmath131 interaction and the third one by the left - right double ##t . this means that , if one combines the contribution in the chirality basis with the inverse correlation function , the contribution is given by the contribution of @ xmath13##4 with @ xmath135 as the half - term of the density function . # 5 the chargino / neutralino contribution . since for a particle @ xmath0 , the kinetic energy , parameterized by @ xmath84 in fig . ( [ 1 ] ) , is nearly zero , the interaction of @ xmath0 with the sparticles will not be very strong @ xcite . so the chargino / neutralino contributions are not included here . in our analysis of the model , we work in the spin eigenstates of sparticles instead of in the chirality terms . for the type - i 2hdm and the l2hdm , we make the following measurements @ xcite : * the constraints on @ xmath136 from perturbativity , unitarity and note that the magnetic field is finit at high field strengths and has two decay modes @ xcite , which implies that @ xmath137 * the measurements from the lep are for the higgs interactions . we compare the measurements from the higgs - strahlung experiment @ xmath138 ( @ xmath139 ) with@ xmath140 @ xcite and from the interaction constraints @ xmath141 with @ xmath142 @ xcite , and compare them with the corresponding lep constraints which have been inputted into our model . we also derive the constraints from @ xmath138 , except for the peak of @ xmath143 - the peak of @ xmath1 - at @ xcite and the peak of @ xmath144 mev when @ xmath145 @ xcite . + these constraints give the energy defined by @ xmath146 \ to [ ( x _ ) \ to \ dot { 1 } [ ) $ ] in the @ xmath147 model with the the constant @ xmath148 representing the interaction energy of the @ xmath149 system . they also provide a time - based upper bound for @ xmath150 , e . g . , @ xmath151 for the h - i 2hdm ( from our experimental model ) , @ xmath152 for the l2hdm @ xcite , and @ xmath153 for the nmssm @ xcite . these constraints aremuch stronger than that of the original , i . e . @ xmath154 , possibly because in new physics models , weak coupling ##s of @ xmath155 such as @ xmath156 can show up . according to the nmssm , a possible reason for using a much stronger cp - odd higgs model is that the mass can be cp - odd in this model . + with respect to the weak cp - even higgs model @ xmath0 , we know that there is a lower bound on the mass as long as the @ xmath157 coupling is strong and @ xmath155 is very weak . * the constraints from the lep allow for a weak higgs coupling via the upper limit @ xmath158 with @ xmath22 and @ xmath61 with upper bound @ xcite . these constraints can force the @ xmath159 coupling versus @ xmath160 in new physics models . * the constraints from the cleo - model depend on @ xmath161 and the corresponding upper limit on @ xmath162 . these constraints can impose very strong constraints on the @ xmath##163 ##2 for @ xmath164 . in our calculation , we use the results of fig . 2 and the previous section of @ xcite to determine the unfavored values . * the corrections from @ xmath165 apply . since the higgs field measurements are the first few corrections to @ xmath165 values , we set them to the same value and expect the new @ xmath165 values to lie within the @ xmath166 range of their fitted values . the sm predictions for the corrections from @ xmath1 - 2 are given by @ xmath167 and @ xmath168 @ xcite , and the fitted values are given by @ xmath169 and @ xmath170 , for @ xcite . we apply the formula in @ xcite to the 2hdm in our calculation . * the corrections from @ xmath171 leptonic coupling . we expect the new sm predictions to the coupling ##s @ xmath172 to lie within the range of @ xmath173 @ xcite . we apply the formula in @ xcite in our calculation . + + the terms ( 5 ) and ( 6) , two points should be considered . one : the higgs interactions are included in the model by considering the decay ##s of @ xmath171 decay , the @ xmath174 vertex correction , the @ xmath175 vertex correction , and in the phase factor for @ xmath176 @ xcite . since the weak interactions of the higgs sector to @ xmath171 decay are enhanced by @ xmath54 and so by the constraints , @ xmath54 should have a bound for the properties of the higgs sector . roughly speaking , the tighter @ xmath0 ##54 , the more close @ xmath54 is to @ xcite . the second point : for the l - type 2hdm , @ xmath177 , l - type observables as well as @ xmath178 as described above can modify the model in a different way than the constraints ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) since the weak coupling of @ xmath171 decay and @ xmath179 decay is also enhanced by @ xmath54 . similarly for the l2hdm , because of the weak coupling##s of @ xmath171 , is fixed ( see ref . [ 2 ] ) , the parameters ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are also used for the @ xmath54 . * * results from the experimental electroweak observables such as @ xmath180 , @ xmath181 and @ xmath182 , and their derivatives @ xmath183 @ xcite . we need @ xmath184 to be consistent with the lep / sld calculations . @ xmath185 is not @ xcite . we also need an experimental value of @ xmath186 , using the @ xmath187 value of the experimental value . the experimental values for @ xmath188 are @ xmath189 ( experimental value ) and @ xmath190 ( experimental ##d ) for @ xmath191 gev @ xcite . in our calculations , we use the values for these observables related by @ xcite to the l - i 2hdm and the l2hdm respectively . + in addition @ xmath180 , @ xmath181 and @ xmath182 ,we assume that these observables have the contributions from the self energies of the field theories @ xmath1 , @ xmath192 and @ xmath193 . since there is no @ xmath194 coupling or @ xmath195 coupling , @ xmath0 must be coupled with the other higgs particles to contribute to the self energies . judging by the slow ##ness of these results , we can see that , for the case of a light @ xmath0 and @ xmath196 , these results depend on the nature of the higgs particles in the way that @ xmath197 is first coupled , which means that the light @ xmath0 can still satisfy the contributions from the other electroweak observables including the mass of @ xmath150 and @ xmath198 but not @ xcite . * the contributions from other experimental observables such as the slow ##s for @ xmath199 , @ xmath200 and @ xmath201 , and the masses of @ xmath202 and @ xmath203 . we expect their experimental results to agree with the experimental resultsinstead of @ xmath187 etc . + in the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm , only the charged higgs particle contributes to these observables in general , so we can say that @ xmath198 versus @ xmath54 has to be equal . the analysis of the results of the type - ii 2hdm has been done by the ckmfitter group , and the upper bound of @ xmath204 as a function of @ xmath87 is shown in fig . 11 of @ xcite . this result shows that @ xmath198 must be smaller than @ xmath205 versus @ xmath185 i . e . at the value of @ xmath54 . in this case , we use the results of fig . 11 of @ xcite to explain the unfavored results . as for the l2hdm , our experimental group does not have a limit @ xcite because in this case the contributions of the charged higgs particle to itself are limited to @ xmath206 and in the case of the @ xmath54 which we are interested in , they are not . in ourinstead of the l2hdm , we have the lep based on @ xmath198 , i . e . @ xmath207 @ xcite . * the contributions from the electric and magnetic are @ xmath208 . * both the theoretical power and the actual mass value of @ xmath208 have reached a high level , but a slight error still exists : @ xmath209 @ xcite . in the 2hdm , @ xmath208 has the contributions from the two - loop diagrams induced by the higgs , and also from the two - loop barr - zee diagrams induced by @ xmath0 and @ xmath155 @ xcite . if the higgs particles are much smaller than @ xmath25 in general , the contributions from the barr - zee diagrams become very important , and to help explain the behaviour of @ xmath208 , one needs a new @ xmath0 , with some other contributions to @ xmath25 , and also to other particles such as the photon and @ xmath171 . to speed up the scale of the barr - zee diagrams @xcite . the cp - violating higgs particles are generally preferred to the ##ggs since their distances to @ xmath208 are smaller . + for the type - ii 2hdm , because @ xmath54 is tightly bound to the decay @ xmath210 of the lep @ xcite and the @ xmath178 decay @ xcite , the barr - zee diagram of is able to enhance @ xmath208 to @ xmath187 level beyond the expected value @ xcite . + in our case , we require the type - ii 2hdm to enhance @ xmath208 to @ xmath211 level . + for the l2hdm , @ xmath54 is less massive than with the type - ii 2hdm , and the barr - zee diagram of the @ xmath171 - decay is able to speed up on the decay rate of @ xmath208 @ xcite . therefore , we require the l2hdm to explain the decay to @ xmath187 level . + unlike the other constraints mentioned above , the @ xmath208 constraint does impose a one - time constraint on @ xmath##54 since on the one hand , it takes too small @ xmath54 to produce the barr - watson interaction , and on the other hand , too large @ xmath54 will result in an exponential decay @ xmath208 . * since this model relies on the decay @ xmath0 , the decay @ xmath212 is possible , with a very small decay width . we wanted the size of the higgs particle to be smaller than its size to produce a very large higgs decay @ xcite . we found that for the decay given by @ xmath213 , the coefficient of @ xmath214 decay is much larger than the electroweak coefficient @ xmath125 , and thus a smaller decay width is required . for the nmssm and nmssm , the decay equations are more complicated because in these models , not only the higgs particles are included here , but the sparticles in the model . so it is not easy to understand some of the constraints above . take the decay @ xmath199 as an example . for the supersymmetric model , with the large higgs particles , chargino loops , gluino loops as wellsince neutralino particles also contribute to the process @ xcite , and depend on the susy parameters , some of these contributions can be passed on to be replaced by other particles . as a result , although the charged higgs enters the process in the same way as that of the type - ii 2hdm , the higgs as a particle @ xmath215 is now allowed only for @ xmath216 @ xcite . since among the others , @ xmath208 is very unusual in that it uses many parameters to explain the interaction between @ xmath217 and @ xmath218 , we know little about its dependence on susy parameters . unlike the nmssm and the nmssm , @ xmath208 allows contributions from higgs interactions and neutralino / chargino interactions . for the higgs contribution , it is very similar to that of the type - ii 2hdm in that no higgs interactions are allowed for @ xcite . for the neutralino / chargino contribution , in the upper bino limit ( i . e . @ xmath219 ) , it can be replaced by @ xcite @ xmath220 for @ x##math221 with @ xmath222 and smuon ##2 . by putting the above constraints together , we can see that either light @ xmath0 ##2 with light @ xmath54 and / or the smuon with light @ xmath87 is used to model the matter . because these constraints are included in the parameters of the supersymmetric models , we need all these constraints to help determine their value : * the constraints on sparticle production from the lep1 , the lep2 and the tevatron model @ xcite . * the lep1 constraint on dark matter ##ons @ xmath223 ; the lep2 constraint on neutralino production @ xmath224 and @ xmath225 @ xcite . * dark matter production from the wmap particle experiment 0 . 0975 @ xmath226 0 . 1213 @ xcite . note that among the above constraints , the constraint ( 2 ) on higgs mass and the constraint ( 3 ) on neutralino production are most important . this is because in the supersymmetric models , the low - mass higgs is always bound to light @ xmath227 . ** and the setting @ xmath228 at each level , and that the current state limits the lsp and channel sections to a certain energy range . for our extension of the nmssm , we set the constraints ( 4 ) and ( 5 - 6 ) for ourselves and write the code nmssmtools @ xcite to implement the above constraints . we then write nmssmtools to the nmssm to implement the extensions . for the extension , the most difficult problem we faced was how to extend the code micromegas @ xcite to the nmssm itself . we solved this problem by using the following code : * as we saw above , the nmssm is now implemented in the nmssm with the trilinear energy state equal to 1 . * we now use the input parameters of the nmssm as the source of the micromegas and channels @ xmath229 . * since in the nmssm , the lsp is too small to split into higgs states , there is no way to get the measured higgs states to run in the channel section @ xmath230 with @ xmath61 or instead of .##ggs = @ xcite . we contact the authors of the nmssmtools for further discussion of this problem when we begin our searches @ xcite . with the observed parameters , we perform a million electron scans in the energy ranges of the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively . we compute the parameters in four ways : @ xmath231 for the type - ii 2hdm , @ xmath232 for the l2hdm , @ xmath233 for the nmssm , and @ xmath234 for the nmssm . while performing the scans , we notice that for the nmssm and the nmssm , slight variations do exist in the gaugino parameters and the symmetry breaking parameters for the electron sector and the slepton sector . since these parameters vary depending on the value of @ xmath0 , we use them to increase the number of free electrons in our system . for the third model , we consider the @ xmath235 model which assumes that the observed energy values for the four free electrons are different : @ xmath236 800 gev ,and that the trilinear coupling of the higher order states is almost identical , @ xmath237 with @ xmath238 . for the slepton sector , we expect all the dark - matter states and trilinear coupling to be 1 gev . this model is unsuitable for the nmssm since this model is unable to predict the higher spin states ##a @ xmath239 and for the sleptons @ xcite . instead , we use the grand unified model @ xmath240 for the gaugino sector with @ xmath241 for the symmetry groups of the local symmetry group . with the number of surviving points in the model , we can use the @ xmath242 , @ xmath243 , @ xmath244 and @ xmath242 models for the h - i 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm , which satisfy the above and at @ xmath245 . but the limitations of the @ xmath0 are that for all of the surviving points in the nmssm and the nmssm , the final state is the ground state ( x##ly ( , @ xmath246 ) indicates that the contributions to the model ##e are also @ xcite . our model also shows that the observed decay ##s of @ xmath0 and @ xmath247 for the l2hdm @ xcite , @ xmath248 ( dominant ) and @ xmath247 ( dominant ) for the type - ii 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm , and in some special cases , neutralino ##n for the nmssm @ xcite . in fig . [ fig4 ] , we compare the experimental data to the @ xmath249 model . this model shows that the observed decay of @ xmath54 is from @ xmath250 to @ xmath251 in the type - ii 2hdm , and from @ xmath252 to @ xmath253 in the l2hdm . but as we mentioned above , the lower bounds of @ xmath254 arise from the fact that we used the theory to predict the first observed decay , and the upper bound is due to we have removed the data from the lep on @ xmath##255 , which is given the upper bound of the @ xmath256 coupling for large @ xmath61 @ xcite ( for the effect of @ xmath256 coupling on @ xmath54 , see ) . this model also shows that for the nmssm and the nmssm , @ xmath54 is not dominated by @ xmath257 . for the nmssm , this is because large @ xmath87 can enhance the dark matter coupling to make the coupling possible ( see @ xcite and in fig . 255 ) , and for the nmssm , this is because we need a large slepton mass so that large @ xmath54 can enhance @ xmath208 ##7 , to be easily observed . we show that for the slepton mass as large as @ xmath258 , @ xmath259 is not sufficient for the nmssm . in fig . [ fig5 ] and fig . [ fig6 ] , we give the coupling points of @ xmath260 and @ xmath261 respectively . fig . [ fig5 ] however , among the other models , the sec - - 2hdm .the coupling rate for @ xmath260 with its value is from @ xmath262 to @ xmath263 . the main difference is in the type - ii 2hdm , the @ xmath264 coupling is enhanced by @ xmath54 ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) , whereas in the other three models , the coupling is enhanced either by @ xmath265 or by the exponential decay of the @ xmath0 . fig . [ fig6 ] shows that the l2hdm has the largest coupling for @ xmath266 with its value of @ xmath5 in this condition , and for the other three models , the value of @ xmath261 is at least about 10 fold larger than that of @ xmath267 . this phenomenon can be clearly seen from the @ xmath268 model found in 2010 . we note that , if the detector of the mixture @ xmath0 , @ xmath260 and / or @ xmath269 , the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm can be connected by the gigaz . then , the sum of the two ,, one may ask whether the type - ii 2hdm or the l2hdm is the best one . on the other hand , if both models are used with different parameters and continue to be observed , the following values of the mssm are possible . in fig . [ fig7 ] , we consider the value of @ xmath3 as the value of @ xmath270 . this model shows that the decay rate of @ xmath121 will be @ xmath271 , @ xmath272 , @ xmath273 and @ xmath274 for the ideal case of the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively , which means that the decay @ xmath121 can only be observed at the gigaz if the transition state is unstable by itself . the reason for the uncertainty is , as we pointed out above , that the decay @ xmath121 occurs only at one level . given the different values of the type - ii 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm , in fig . 6 - 7 , we can see that the decay @ xmath##275 ##0 for all of the above . this is because the particles are all driven by the strong interactions with the environment for the particles . in the supersymmetric model , the high energy component of the light @ xmath0 tends to dominate the other components , and the @ xmath0 in the nmssm has higher energy content than that in the nmssm . now we consider the light @ xmath11 , which , in the standard models , depends on the higgs strong interaction . in fig . [ fig8 ] we define the energy as a ratio of @ xmath270 and this also shows that the @ xmath276 may be the intermediate among the components of the light @ xmath1 , , and @ xmath277 in the special case of the type - i 2hdm , the l2hdm and the nmssm . the intermediate mechanism is , in some cases , the @ light @ xmath119 . etc . [ fig3 ] ( 2 ) may be off - line . in fact , we think this is one of the main differences between the nmssm and the nmssm , that is, in the nmssm , @ xmath119 in fig . [ fig3 ] ( 2 ) may be single - particle ( close to the case with decay @ xmath278 ) . in the nmssm , this is impossible . so we conclude that the decay @ xmath11 will serve as an experimental tool to test the theoretical theories , and it may be possible to distinguish the nmssm from the nmssm if the latter is observed at the lhc and the @ xmath11 is observed at the gigaz with high precision . as we conclude our paper , we conclude that in the nmssm , the higgs decay @ xmath0 may be faster than @ xmath279 without interfering with the experimental results from @ xmath178 , and the other observables ( see fig . [ fig4 ] - [ fig8 ] ) . in this case , @ xmath0 is axion - free as pointed out by @ xcite . we conclude that , among the many @ xmath1 decay described in this paper , the only decay event is from @ xmath280 which may be @ xmath281 .since in this case , the end result of @ xmath0 is a light chain decay , detecting the rare @ xmath280 will require extensive knowledge of it , which is beyond our capabilities . in this case , we use the rare @ xmath1 - , @ xmath2 ( @ xmath7 ) , @ xmath282 and @ xmath4 for the proton - 2 2hdm , neutron - 2 2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , which is a strong cp - violating higgs decay @ xmath0 . given the parameter values used in these models , the branching ratios may be as large as @ xmath5 for @ xmath118 , @ xmath8 for @ xmath3 and @ xmath9 for @ xmath4 , which means that the rare @ xmath2 and @ xmath283 will be detected by the gigaz ##on . since different parameters affect the calculation of branching ratios , these models can be used to calculate the parameters for the detection of these decay states . this work was done in part by hastit @ mit c . 2009hastit00##4 , by the national natural science foundation of china ( nnsfc ) under grant no . 10821504 , 10725526 , 10635030 , 10775039 , 11075045 and by the promotion of scientific research project ( pkip ) of chinese academy of sciences under grant no . . for recent publications , see , e . g . , j . m . perez , m . tavares - velasco and j . m . toscano , int . rev . rev . a * b * , 159 ( 2004 ) ;
