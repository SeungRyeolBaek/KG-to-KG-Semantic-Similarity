the light resulting from the molecular collsions is a rare phenomenon . the method of modeling and simulation has not yet been established . a number of approaches have been proposed . some of these include diffusion models @ xcite , diffusion models @ xcite , molecular diffusion models , and molecular models based on diffusion models @ xcite . in this section we present the sampling approach @ xcite where one considers clusters of clusters of non - interacting atoms . additionally , chase and mekjian @ xcite proposed methods which allow the accurate determination of the molecular wave function for such a system . by avoiding the need for more intensive monte carlo calculations and mathematical models , this approach allows for an insight into the chemical properties which govern the motion of molecules . in the next section we present the computational methods of chase and mekjian and introduce the solvent models , many of which have already been presented in the paper . we show that the free volume is the most important parameter for understanding the thermal and phase space properties of the system . in the two next sections , we introduce properties of the solvent which are important for the understanding of such systems : free energy , scattering energy , andisospin degrees of freedom . in the [ x _ 1 ] we show how the microcanonical distribution can be derived from the exponential distribution . for this , we use an extension of the model , which is based on the work of chase and mekjian @ xcite . the equations given above are based on a system of non - interacting liquid droplets . mekjian and chase have also done a extension of @ xcite to a different but equivalent computational problem that is also based on the liquid - drop model . we assume that there exist @ xmath0 particles which thermalize in a volume @ xmath1 much larger than @ xmath2 where @ xmath3 is the ground - state of the system of @ xmath0 particles . these particles can exist as particles and also as complexes of @ xmath4 particles . the energy partition function of this system can be written as @ xmath5 where @ xmath6 is the partition function of a single composite of particles @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 is the number of the composite and the sum is over all the values which constitute @ xmath9 .a priori this appears to be a horrendously difficult problem . @ xmath10 can be solved recursively via the formula , @ xmath11 where @ xmath12 = 0 . it is this fact and the extension of this to the general case ( see below ) that makes this formula so widely applicable . the components of the system are determined by the partition functions of indepedent fragments . the general approach also allows a great deal of flexibility in the choice of partition functions for individual fragments , @ xmath6 . any combination of temperature , pressure and @ xmath0 is possible . however , the information on the properties of the components of the system is outside the scope of this section . for the first part of this equation , we assume the form , @ xmath13 the first part is due to the kinetic energy of the center of mass of the particle and the pressure @ xmath1 and the second part is due to the internal energy . for the case of form @ xcite we assume the form @ xmath14 where @ xmath15 is the kinetic energy per particle ( = 1 mev ) , @ xmath16 is the surface at whichis a function of the energy @ xmath17 . the sequence of the energy terms in fig . ( [ bondorf _ t _ 1 ] ) is the following : @ xmath18 is the ground state energy of the composite of @ xmath19 electrons , and the second term is the taylor expansion because the electrons can be excited only in the ground state but not in excited states which are described only in the einstein - bell model . in ref @ xcite the energy of @ xmath20 is taken to be 20 mev . is the energy density of @ xmath16 [ ref @ xcite = @ xmath21 ^ { 1 / 2 } $ ] with @ xmath22 mev and @ xmath23 mev . any energy value could be taken as a dependence on the energy density . upon analysis , the transition shown above is a first order phase transition . in ref [ 1 _ 1 ] the specific energy at room temperature , @ xmath24 , is taken as a function of , for values of electrons , @ xmath25 , @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 . the temperature difference is a peak in the energy density , whichand for very small clusters . the usual model of the liquid - solid phase transition gives a spike in the energy level when temperature is kept constant rather than when the pressure is kept constant . to see this , we consider a solid divided into one large cluster and two small clusters . the bulk and surface energy can then be calculated using @ xmath28 where @ xmath29 is the number of clusters . the bulk term depends only on the temperature and not on the way in which the clusters are partioned into clusters . we have calculated the surface energy , which is proportional to @ xmath30 . in this case , @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 = @ xmath33 the bulk term depends only on the temperature and is kept constant throughout the phase transition . however , a spike in @ xmath32 is equivalent to a spike in @ xmath34 since both are proportional to @ xmath35 . it is difficult to make a distinction between this approach and the standard model approach , since the interactions between atoms occur only at the free energy . the physical quantities can be calculated in a different way . for example the physical and chemical quantities can be calculated using the standard, @ xmath36 , of @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 are given in the [ mup _ fig ] as a function of temperature for a system of molecules @ xmath39 . both the pressure and the temperature are approximately constant in the region of maximum density . of particular interest is that the pressure always changes in the same direction due to the temperature distribution . we also have some information about effects of small variations in temperature . ( [ bondorf _ t _ fig ] ) . the surface terms , @ xmath40 , are not affected by the free energy , but they can be ignored when considering other observables . their influence with respect to the physical properties is of a general nature . the surface term @ xmath16 is also important for all the observables associated to it and for all aspects of the phase transition . apart from the particle , @ xmath0 , it is affected by two dimensionless terms . the first is the free heat , @ xmath41 and the second is the energy , @ xmath42 . at a constant temperature the free energy @ xmath43 of @ xmath0 nucle##ons should be used . with the surface tension equation , @ xmath44 is minmised if the whole system exists as a collection of @ xmath0 fragments . the pressure term involves breaking up into clusters . at low temperatures the pressure term dominates . at high temperatures temperature dominates and the system breaks into smaller clusters . the mass distribution can be calculated from the partition function . @ xmath45 the mass distribution is shown in the [ massdist _ n ] for three nuclei , 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 and 6 . 5 mev which are based on the binding energy of 6 . 5 mev . the parameters have been modified in @ xmath7 to reflect the size of the nuclei . the mass distribution changes rapidly in this small temperature range . the behavior is reminiscent of that observed in the structure and crystal structure of @ xcite . the formula used to refer to the partition function of the nuclei , @ xmath6 and @ x . ( [ bondorf _ n _ n ] ) , should represent only that volume in which the nuclei are able to move . smith and stcker suggested using @ xmath46 to represent the volume taken up by the fragments . then using @. ( [ bondorf _ t _ t ] ) we can show that this defines the partion function while not defining the mass or energy required to form observables . more generally , the excluded volume could depend upon the density . however , in more complicated cases as mentioned above , it is clear that for the purpose of using @ xmath47 diagrams in the areas of interest in this paper , it is an excellent idea to include the density dependence of the excluded volume @ xcite . ignoring the density dependence would be outside the scope of the original paper , as it would cause an abrupt difference in dimensions . alternatively , we could add an @ xmath4 - dependence to the density dependence to account for the effect of packing particles of different sizes into a single cluster . this would change the density in a non - linear manner . we need to remind the reader that the number @ xmath48 in the van der waals diagram : @ xmath49 diagram has its origin in the excluded volume . from this @ xmath48 plays a different role . we could not for instance have @ xmath48 = 0 without causing an increase in the density . therefore , the phase change occurs when @ xmath4is equal to zero . it has been shown that the two interactions cause the phase transition of the reactions @ xcite . although the two interactions are outside the scope of this article , they can be explained by using the standard steady state equation for the free energy that has been derived by bondorf and donangelo @ xcite . the solution to the first free energy term in fig . ( [ bondorf _ ref _ fig ] ) is @ xmath50 this also assumes a jellium of high density that dominates the net electric field when moving over a large area . this may be more strongly used for the description of atomic reactions where the electrons play the role of the jellium . we have @ xmath31 , but with and without the equations for the @ xmath51 and in the [ cvcoulomb _ ref ] . these effects greatly affect the temperature at which the transition occurs . for very large drops , matter dominates the temperature and these particles are subject to the strong force . the general definition given above is often extended to include different types of particles . if there are a number of particles with different properties @ xmath52, @ xmath53 , one can find a similar expression for the form @ xcite . @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 is the total nuclear charge of type @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 is the charge of type @ xmath56 generated by the nucleus formed by @ xmath19 . for the nuclear collision case , one would like to solve @ xmath58 where @ xmath59 and @ xmath60 are the corresponding electron and proton numbers . to solve @ xmath61 one must solve @ xmath62 for both @ xmath63 and @ xmath64 . to do this one must use the above equation . for nuclear collisions , one does not have access to a heat sink , so one must calculate the collision energy . the microcanonical ensemble is much more appropriate for nuclear calculations , by considering the case of a first order phase transition which has an infinite ( in the case of 1 @ xmath0 ) range of temperatures in a classical ensemble , and a finite range of temperatures in a microcanonical ensemble . the energy density , for a microcanonical ensemble is the density of energy , @xmath65 where the sum over @ xmath56 is the sum over all many - body systems . although @ xmath66 is quite accurate using the selection rules described in the previous section , we cannot perform the calculation of @ xmath67 ##1 . the correct value for the density of states would be ill - defined given the complex nature of quantum mechanics which cannot easily be calculated with the delta function . however , if one considers the density of states over a wide range of energies @ xmath68 , the density of states is well - defined even for large spectra . for that reason we cannot precisely calculate the density of states . @ xmath69 we might have considered replacing the delta function by a lorentzian rather than by a function , but this would be impossible given that the density of states always increases rapidly for a many - body system . the energy of @ xmath68 used to calculate the density of states should correspond to the energy of the state measured in the original experiment . in the case @ xmath70 , @ xmath71 is the density of states . as an example of this , one might wish to calculate within microcanonical energies , we calculate the energy distribution of a fragment of species @ xmath19 in a system whose total energy lies between @ xmath68 of @ xmath44 . @ xmath72 where @ xmath73 is the number of pairs of species @ xmath19 in the system @ xmath56 . the integral of @ xmath67 ##3 presents an additional probability value that varies for each @ xmath68 . for the purpose of calculating the probability value , one must perform this calculation for each fragment . it may be worthwile to calculate all the values of @ xmath67 with the fixed point method , although one should be wary of the values of @ xmath74 with respect to @ xmath67 in the phase transition method . microcanonical energies can also be measured in a slightly different way , discreetizing the measurements . for example one might measure energy in units of 0 . 5 mev . one could then measure it on the same scale as any other electrical field . one could then calculate the energy for @ xmath75 , the number of ways to combine @ xmath0 ##7 withnet energy @ xmath44 , where @ xmath44 is an electron . @ xmath76 , , @ xmath77 is the number of ways of splitting a strand of dna @ xmath19 with net energy @ xmath78 . also the relavant microcanonical effects can be calculated in a similar way . since one has to calculate @ xmath59 over all energies @ xmath79 greater than the net energy @ xmath44 , and then integrate over all energies greater than @ xmath79 to get @ xmath80 , the energy of the decay is equal to @ xmath81 . typically , these reactions occur with on the order of 1 gev of energy difference in the nucleus . however , these reactions can be very difficult unless the decay is discreetized very well . the synthetic methods described above have some interesting properties . they are easy to work with , have properties of molecular dynamics and seem to have the properties of gas - liquid phase reactions . in the simplest cases these techniques are resricted to high energies . for simple chemical reactions this is not a significant problem , although for many it wouldbe sure to be careful to extend the theory so that it can be extended to higher dimensions . in this way we have described the properties of the particles , and we note the importance of the kinetic energy in describing these properties . we also attribute the change in the energy associated with fusion to the change in the motion of particles . in addition , we have shown that adding these terms increases the rate at which the fusion reaction occurs and thus the rate of the fission reaction . we have also proposed an extension of the method for the calculation of isospin degrees of freedom . for comparison to other theoretical approaches , one of the microcanonical approaches presented here is of particular interest . it remains to be seen whether the microcanonical approaches are correct , as they have yet to be proven . ph . chomaz , ann . b * 41 * , 669 ( 1996 ) burgio , m . chomaz and j . randrup , phys . 38 * , 885 ( 1992 ) . j . feldmeier and j . schnack , prog . of nucl . phys . * 38 * , 393 ( 1997 ) . t . ohnishi and j . randrup, phys . b * 394 * , 260 j . kiderlen and m . danielewicz , nucl . b * 620 * , 346 ( 1997 ) . j . pratt , m . montoya and j . ronning , phys . b * 349 * , 261 ( 1995 ) . j . randrup and a . koonin , nucl . b * 356 * , 321 ( 1981 ) . lee , j . phys . * 47 * , 605 ( 1990 ) . bondorf , a . s . botvina , a . s . iljinov , i . n . mishustin and k . sneppen , physics b * 257 * , 133 -
