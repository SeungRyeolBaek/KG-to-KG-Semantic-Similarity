the light - hole ( lg ) phase transition in nuclear matter is important and a controversial research topic because of the many attempts made to understand its theoretical and experimental properties by the nuclear physics community over the years @ xcite . for a comprehensive list , see , e . g . , ref . @ xcite . most of the recent studies have focused on the lg phase transition in symmetric nuclear matter . even in such symmetric nuclear matter , the lg phase transition is expected to have some interesting physical properties because of the isospin degrees of freedom and the many additional and interesting physical laws @ xcite . this , along with the need to understand the properties of symmetric nuclear matter , for both nuclear physics and chemistry has motivated a lot of new studies recentlyliko97 , ma99 , wang00 , su00 , lee01 , li01 , natowitz02 , li02 , chomaz03 , sil04 , lizx04 , chomaz06 , li07 . however , the research on the lg phase transition in symmetric nuclear matter has received quite a big boost from the recent advances in the more powerful electron beams that can be made to be usedin some cases large amounts of highly radioactive nuclear matter . although much progress has been made recently on the properties of isospin in nuclear matter and the lg phase transition in general , there are still some important questions to be answered . among the main ones are our current understanding of the isovector spin , and the momentum dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @ xcite . however , recent studies of the isospin spin data from metal - metal interactions have allowed us to see a strong influence on the symmetry energy of neutron - rich matter at non - normal densities betty04 , chen05 , lichen05 . it is therefore important to consider how the nuclear symmetry energy will help us to better understand the lg phase transition in hot nuclear matter . ideally , both the isovector ( i . e . , the nuclear quantum number ) and isoscalar components of the nuclear electron interaction should be momentum dependent . however , some of the momentum - dependent interactions on the lg phase transition in hot nuclear matter were not fully studied yet . we report on our recent research on the effects of the isospin and momentum dependent interactions on the lg phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter . theself - assembled nuclear system has three nuclear interactions @ xcite . the first one is the isospin and momentum dependent interaction , determined by the isospin density resulting from ion - ion collisions . the second one is a momentum - dependent interaction ( mid ) which leads to a fully momentum dependent single particle potential , and the third one is an isoscalar momentum - dependent interaction ( emdyi ) in which the isoscalar part of the single particle potential is momentum dependent and the isovector part of the single particle potential is momentum independent . we know that the mid interaction is important , and the first two are often used as tools in order to understand properties of the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear interactions . using the isospin and momentum - dependent nuclear interactions , the kinetic energy density @ xmath0 of a fully interacting assembled nuclear system with atomic mass @ xmath1 , energy @ xmath2 and isospin density @ xmath3 is calculated as : @ xcite , @ xmath4 using the mean field approximation , etc . ( [ 1 ] ) corresponding to the classical single particle potential for single nucle##on with momentum @ xmath5 and isospin @ xmath6 for the cold - symmetric nuclear matter das03 , chen05 @ xmath7 in the figure the isospin @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 for electrons and @ xmath10 for holes , and @ xmath11 is the phase space distribution function of momentum @ xmath12 and momentum @ xmath5 . the exact values of the parameters @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 can be found in ref . @ xcite and have been shown to be spin energy parameters . the isospin and spin - dependent nuclear interaction gives the spin energy per particle of @ xmath15 mev , momentum @ xmath16 mev and the spin energy of @ xmath17 mev for cold symmetric nuclear matter at room temperature @ xmath18 @ xmath19 @ xcite . the energy @ xmath20 parameters in the above equation are used to determine the distribution function of the nuclear interaction , while using both parts of the same equation of state in @ xcite . we see that the energyit has been also used in the diffusion model for the isospin effect in high - energy metal - ion collisions caused by hydrogen - like molecules li04b , chen04 , chen05 , lichen05 , li05pion , li06 , yong061 , yong062 , yong07 . in addition , the isospin diffusion model from nscl / msu has shown the value of @ xmath20 to be between @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 for the energy is less than 1 @ xmath23 @ xcite . we have : in the second case is the potential values of @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 with @ xmath24 giving a softer symmetry energy and @ xmath25 giving a harder symmetry energy . the potential value of the symmetry energy @ xmath26 is this energy can be parameterized as @ xcite @ xmath27 ( % \ frac { \ dots } { \ sum _ { 1 } } ) ^ { [ ( 1 ) } , \ dots { epotsym } \ ] ] where the values of @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 forthus @ xmath20 can be found in ref . @ xcite . in the time - dependent mid interaction , the total energy density @ xmath30 of the fully cold symmetric nuclear matter at equilibrium density @ xmath1 and isospin density @ xmath3 can be expressed as @ xmath31the energy @ xmath32 , @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 is given by the energy @ xmath35 of cold symmetric nuclear matter at equilibrium density @ xmath36 as in ref . @ xcite and @ xmath35 is also defined to be @ xmath37 mev as in the mid interaction . and @ xmath26 is the parameter in ref . ( [ epotsym ] ) . thus the mid interaction combines very well the energy of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter with the mid interaction at constant density for example @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the total energy density of the mid interaction can be easily calculated from @ xmath38with @ xmath39 { \ tau } { \ tau } \ notag \ \& + & ( 1 . 0 - g ( x ) ) ( g ( x ) - 1 ) ( \ frac { \ , } { \ , _ { 2 } } ) ^ { g ( x ) } { \ , } ^ { 2 } . \ dot { uasy } \ dot { 1 } \ ] ] the momentum - dependent part of the particle interaction is also isospin dependent . the # ##point is also momentum dependent . in order to understand the nature of the momentum dependence of the isovector part of the charged particle interaction ( the interaction energy ) , we can consider an isoscalar momentum - dependent interaction , called the mdyi ( emdyi ) interaction since it has the same general form as the well - known mdyi interaction for symmetric nuclear matter @ xcite . in the emdyi interaction , the kinetic energy density @ xmath40 of the _ symmetric symmetric nuclear matter at total density @ xmath1 , density @ xmath2 and isospin density @ xmath3 is defined as @ xmath41here @ xmath42 is the momentum dependent wave function of _ symmetric nuclear matter _ at total density @xmath1 and then @ xmath2 . then @ xmath26 has the same expression as q . ( [ epotsym ] ) . we have @ xmath43 and @ xmath44 , and @ xmath45 , @ xmath46 and @ xmath14 have the same expression as for the neutron interaction , so that the emdyi interaction also has the same value of the nuclear spin as the neutron interaction at zero temperature for example @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the single electron potential for the emdyi interaction can be calculated from @ xmath47where @ xmath48and @ xmath49 , the same as q . ( [ uasy ] ) which means that the spin potential is identical for the emdyi and neutron interactions . however , in the emdyi interaction , the isoscalar part of the nuclear spin interaction is temperature , while the nuclear spin part is spin . at zero temperature , @ xmath50 @ xmath51 and then the values of these interactions can be calculated from @ xcite , and at a higher temperature @ xmath2, the phase space distribution function is the total entropy @ xmath52where @ xmath53 is the chemical potential of proton or neutron and can be calculated from @ xmath54 using the scheme , @ xmath55 is the proton or neutron potential and @ xmath56 is the proton or neutron per unit mass for strong interactions . from the self - consistent calculation of @ xcite , the chemical potential @ xmath53 and the distribution function @ xmath57 can be calculated as . from the chemical potential @ xmath53 and the distribution function @ xmath58 , the entropy per proton @ xmath59 can be calculated as @ xmath60 . \ label { e } \ ] ] similarly , we can calculate the entropy per proton @ xmath61 ##dp @ xmath62dp \ label { e } \ ] ] with the transition function @ xmath63finally , the entropy @ xmath64 can be calculated from the total entropy @ xmath65 \ mu + \ sum _ { \ tau } \ sum _ { \ tau } \ sum _ { \ mu } . \[ { aligned } \ , { aligned } \ ] ] with the above two equations , we can also calculate the lg phase transition for the hot nuclear matter . the phase transition is given by the gibbs equation and for the cold nuclear matter non - phase equilibrium equations . @ xmath66where @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 are for liquid phase and gas phase , respectively . the thermal equilibrium equation is given by @ xmath69the boundary conditions ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) for phase transitions with different physical and chemical properties for two solutions with different sizes and shapes . for a given solution , the two solutions will have the shape of a triangle . the proton and neutron chemical bond forms as a result of isospin interactions @ xmath3 and can be calculated by means of the geometric ##al method @ xcite . calculate @ xmath70 mev for the low and high interactions ( left ) and the emdyi interaction ( right ) with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the al method allows to calculatethe isospin interactions and chemical potential in the two interacting phases are also shown . taken from ref . @ xcite . ] calculate @ xmath70 mev for the md and mid interactions ( left ) and the emdyi interactions ( right ) with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the geometric construction used to calculate the isospin interactions and chemical potential in the two interacting phases is also shown . taken from ref . @ xcite . ] we calculate the chemical potential ##s with @ xmath70 mev , which is a fixed temperature of lg phase transition . the solid structures shown in the second section of ref . [ mudelta ] calculate the proton and proton chemical potential ##s as a function of the isospin interactions @ xmath71 at a fixed temperature @ xmath70 mev and with @ xmath72 mev @ xmath73 @ xmath74 , and the md and mid interactions with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the solid structures from the geometric construction are also shown as straight lines in theright panel of fig . [ mudelta ] . when the pressure increases and reaches the critical pressure @ xmath75 , an additional line will show for proton and electron chemical instability ##s . at the critical pressure , the chemical potential of atoms ( s ) increases ( decreases ) monotonically with @ xmath3 and the chemical instability increases . in the right panel of fig . [ mudelta ] , we will show the chemical potential components of the critical pressure by the dotted lines . at the critical pressure , the pressure is shifted to a plane perpendicular to the @ xmath3 plane , indicated by double - dotted lines . the components of the critical pressure are @ xmath76 , @ xmath77 , @ xmath78 and @ xmath79 mev @ xmath73 @ xmath80 for the mid interaction with @ xmath24 , mid interaction with @ xmath24 , mid interaction with @ xmath25 and mid interaction with @ xmath25 , etc . shown in the right panel of fig . [ mudelta ] is the chemical potential component as a function of the isospin .##ymmetry @ xmath3 → @ xmath70 mev by studying the emdyi interaction with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . compared with the results from the md and mid interactions , the only difference is that the left ( and right ) sides of @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 do not correspond to the pressure @ xmath3 as they do for the md and mid interactions as shown in the adjacent diagram . the chemical potential of ions increases more rapidly with pressure than that of electrons at this pressure . at higher pressures , for example , @ xmath72 mev / @ xmath80 as shown in figure ( 1 ) , the equation can be completely solved and therefore the gibbs equations ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) are exact solutions . due to the large increase of @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 with pressure , we can assume a constant pressure @ xmath83 for which a solution can be drawn and the gibbs equations ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coe##p ] ) have no effect . panel ( b ) : the interactions at the critical point with @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 mev / @ xmath80 for @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 , respectively . with constant density , in panel ( c ) @ xmath81 passes through an equilibrium point while @ xmath82 still forms a more stable solution , and in panel ( d ) @ xmath82 passes through an equilibrium point while @ xmath81 reacts monotonically with @ xmath3 . for this case , the two different values of @ xmath3 correspond to two different phases with different density and the lower density phase ( with larger @ xmath3 value ) defines a gas phase and the higher density phase ( with smaller @ xmath71 value ) defines a liquid phase . for all the values of @ xmath86 and @ xmath87 ##1 is the binodal 1 . mev between the liquid and the gas with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . the critical temperature ( cp ) , the values of critical concentration ( cp ) and critical concentration##ymmetry ( # ) is also shown . ( a ) the section of binodal surface at @ xmath88 mev for the emdyi interactions with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . this is the transition state . [ from fig . @ xcite . ] from fig . [ pdelta ] ( b ) , we see the section of the binodal surface at @ xmath88 mev for the lp and lp interactions with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . on the left side of the binodal surface there only exists a liquid phase and on the right side only a gas phase interaction . in the case of the mignon is the mixed state of liquid phase and gas phase . however , we can see from fig . [ pdelta ] ( b ) that the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( @ xmath25 ) slightly lowers the cp value ( cp ) and makes the binding energy ( ma ) a little higher . also , the electron transfer to the mid ( ma ) increases the cp by a small amount , but it seems to have no effect at the molecular level . in fact , just as before , the effect of@ xmath20 does not affect the real ##ization ( z ) , but the momentum dependence affects it . ( example : @ xmath89 mev / @ xmath80 ) . these results also show that the critical pressure and the area of phase - transition region in the case ##al ##d are highly sensitive to the strength of the symmetry , with a higher symmetry strength , a larger critical pressure and a larger area of phase - transition region . also , the critical pressure and the area of phase - transition region are highly sensitive to the momentum dependence . the mid interaction has a larger area of phase transition , and a larger area of the critical pressure , compared to the area of mid interaction in the case of @ xmath70 mev . [ pdelta ] ( 2011 ) opens the section of the binodal curve at @ xmath70 mev , and the emdyi curve with @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . we can see that the section is closed except for the critical pressure with @ xmath84 and @ xmath90 mev / @ xmath80 for @ xmath24 and @ x##math25 , 6 . we can also see that the limiting pressure and the area of phase - transition region are directly related to the value of the symmetry energy with the higher symmetry energy ( @ xmath24 ) having a higher critical temperature and a smaller area of phase - transition region in this case . from the properties of the high and low interactions shown in fig . [ pdelta ] ( 2 ) , we can see that for pressures higher than the limiting pressure , the binodal effect from the emdyi interaction is similar to that from the mid model . this also means that the momentum dependence of the nuclear potential has no effect on the lg phase transition in electron heavy nuclear matter . the momentum dependence of the isoscalar single electron potential only affects the area of phase - transition region for pressures lower than the limiting pressure . for pressures above the limiting pressure , the momentum dependence of both the isoscalar and isovector single electron potential is stronger . in particular , we have predicted the liquid - solid phase transition in hot electron - heavy nuclear matter as a self - consistent thermal equilibrium with two different possible temperature parameters , namely , the isospin and thethe spin is described by the isospin interaction , for heavy - ion particles , the spin - dependent mid interaction , and the isoscalar momentum - dependent emdyi interaction . at constant pressure , the above three interactions give the same result for all nuclear reactions . by comparing liquid - gas phase transition and the proton - proton nuclear reactions with the above three interactions , we find that the area of the phase - transition region is more sensitive to the momentum dependence of the spin symmetry energy . a lower symmetry energy leads to a lower critical temperature and a larger area of the phase - transition region . in addition , the areas of phase - transition region are also found to be sensitive to the isospin and momentum dependence of the mid interaction . for the isoscalar spin - dependent emdyi interaction , a critical temperature at which the liquid - gas phase transition can actually take place has been proposed . this model is supported in china by the national natural science foundation of china under grant no . 10334020 , 10575071 , and 10675082 , moe of japan under grant ncet - 05 - 0392 , and five - star institute under grant no . 06qa140##24 , the srf for japan , sem of taiwan , the chinese government national key science grant corporation under award no . 2007cb815004 , the us national science foundation under award no . phy - 0652548 and the british council under award no .
