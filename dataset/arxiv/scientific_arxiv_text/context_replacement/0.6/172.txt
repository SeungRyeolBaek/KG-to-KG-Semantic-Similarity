the general electronic properties of single - layer graphenes received more attention , and experimental results , @ xcite although they were not the subject of scientific research prior to the paper . @ xcite multilayer films which have more than two layers can also be studied , and electronic properties depending on the atomic structure have been studied . @ xcite in this paper we have a theoretical study of the band structure of multilayer graphenes . the band structure of the monolayer graphene is very different from the films , because the bonding and bonding electrons are at @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 , in the brillouin plane , in which the structure is more like a band structure . for multi - layered graphenes , the bulk material forms a band structure with the bulk structure . the electronic properties of graphene bilayer were also studied for the band structure @ xcite and the electronic structure . @ xcite for single - layer graphenes of more than two layers , the band structure was studied , using the @ xmath3 model , @ xcite a density functional model , @ xcite and a ligand - ligand model . @ xcite on the theoretical basis , the electronic structure of graphenes from is to .they were first studied using time - dependent analysis techniques . @ xcite the surface structure of graphene - like systems was first studied for the monolayer using a simple way to calculate the layer thickness of molecules . @ xcite it was found that the disorder is significantly reduced at @ xmath4 ( band touching point ) even though the density of electrons remains there . the study was extended to both @ xcite and to multi - layer graphenes in the class of diamond like systems . @ xcite the energy level of the molecule was found to be trigonally ordered at the band touching point @ xcite and the effect of the disorder on it is discussed in the perturbational model . @ xcite also , the thermal effects on the thermal state @ xcite and on the disorder @ xcite were studied for the monolayer graphene . here we have a detailed description of the free energy for multilayer graphenes with different layer thickness in the same temperature range . we find that the hamiltonian of the multilayer graphene can be divided into those corresponding to monolayer and bilayer , which allows us tonote the effect of the energy on the geometry . we introduce the energy - state into the system and note that the electronic structure of the energy gives rise to the ##ity * . we divide the system hamiltonian and the parameters into terms in sec . [ sec _ disc ] , and continue the calculation of the system in sec . [ sec _ disc ] . the calculations and results are presented in sec . [ sec _ disc ] . we consider a multilayer graphene composed of @ xmath5 layers of a single atom each , which are arranged in the usual ( bernal ) way , as shown in sec . [ ab _ schem ] . each unit cell has @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 layers on the surface @ xmath8 . for example we divide the layers into two groups : @ xmath9 the atoms of group i are arranged in the planes perpendicular to the surface geometry , while those of group ii are at or near the center of mass of the adjacent layers . the coupling constant of each layer is given by @ xmath10 nm and the coupling between adjacent layers @ xmath11 nm . the system can be described by k * k *@ xmath12 * the * hamiltonian is equivalent to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattice model . @ xcite the total energy estimate is given by the values of the basis of @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 located in the brillouin region . let @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 be the wave functions at the @ xmath1 point , corresponding to the @ xmath15 and @ xmath16 sublattices , respectively , of the @ xmath17 . for monolayer graphene , the hamiltonian of @ xmath1 , for the layer @ xmath18 , @ xmath19 is given by @ xcite @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 with @ xmath23 represents the nearest - neighbor coupling between a single layer . we need the energy of @ xmath24 above . @ xcite for the two - layer model , we need both @ xmath25 , and @ xmath26 , and the hamiltonian is given for the bilayer graphene . @ xcite where @ xmath25 represents the coupling between two oriented layers of layer i ( @xmath27 ) , and @ xmath26 for type i bonds between other atoms ( @ xmath28 ) , which are equivalent to @ xmath29 ev , @ xcite and @ xmath30 ev . @ xcite if we are at the interface between layers 1 and 2 , the matrix element @ xmath31 , corresponding to the double bond , becomes @ xmath25 with the in - plane molecular components . the matrix element @ xmath32 is calculated from @ xmath33 with @ xmath34 corresponding to the intra - atomic matrix @ xmath35 , but the in - plane molecular components from @ xmath36 to @ xmath37 are identical to those from @ xmath38 to @ xmath36 . therefore , if the matrix is calculated from @ xmath39 ; @ xmath40 ; @ xmath41 ; @ xmath42 , the hamiltonian for the multilayer graphene at the @ xmath1 interface becomes @ xmath43 with @ xmath44 the corresponding hamiltonian for @ xmath2 is calculated by combining @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 and then @ xmat##h25 with @ xmath47 . the definition of the canonical hamiltonian based on the tight - binding chain is given in appendix [ e _ app _ h ] . we show in the appendix that the hamiltonian of ( [ app _ h ] ) can be sub - divided into two groups by choosing the appropriate basis set of @ xmath48 . first , we choose the basis of the order of group i and of group j , i . e . , @ xmath19 , @ xmath49 , @ xmath50 , @ xmath41 ; @ xmath18 , @ xmath51 , @ xmath52 , @ xmath41 . finally , etc . ( [ app _ h ] ) replace @ xmath53 with @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 , such as @ xmath56 where the upper and lower indices correspond to odd and even @ xmath5 , respectively . if we take @ xmath57 ( the @ xmath1 basis ) , @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 respectively . then @ xmath60 is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a two - dimensional tight - binding chain withthe nearest - neighbor , @ xmath25 , is the product of eigenenergies @ xmath61 with @ xmath62 . , @ xmath63 is an even number when the real number @ xmath5 is even , and @ xmath63 is even when @ xmath5 is odd , and therefore @ xmath64 is odd only for the @ xmath5 . the resulting wave function is now written as @ xmath65 , \ left { x _ 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath66 is the values of @ xmath19 , @ xmath49 , @ xmath50 , @ xmath41 and , @ xmath67 we get the matrix between the wave functions @ xmath68 and @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 . we obtain the matrix by applying @ xmath71 to the elements of group i and writing out @ xmath72 and trying to find the hamiltonian ( [ x _ Ïˆ ] ) . the remaining elements of group i come from @ xmath60 and are , as is clear from the above, @ xmath73 off - diagonal relations between @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 are written from @ xmath58 as @ xmath76 for the first time we have relation ( [ off _ diagonal ] ) and relation ( [ off _ orthogonal ] ) . similarly , the following relations in string theory are written from @ xmath59 as @ xmath77 \ nonumber \ \ + \ ! \ ! & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! & \ gamma ' ( k _ x \ sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { j - 1 } ( - 1 ) ^ * \ = [ \ psi _ { m ' } ^ * ( j + 1 ) \ psi _ { m } ( j ) - \ psi _ { m ' } ^ * ( j ) \ psi _ { m } ( j + 1 ) \ right ] \ nonumber \ \ = & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! & \ gamma ' \ sum _ { m , j } ( k _ x \ delta _ { m , m ' } + { k _ y \ delta _ { m , - 1 ' } ) . \ ] ] the hamiltonian isthus this is the basis @ xmath78 for all @ xmath79 . however , @ xmath64 is different in that the basis is written with all the vectors @ xmath80 , and this is used for odd - layer graphenes . the sub - basis is written as @ xmath81 which is composed of @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 , and corresponds to the hamiltonian of the monolayer graphene . for @ xmath82 , we write the basis as @ xmath83 where we replace @ xmath84 without loss of information . we also replace @ xmath85 with @ xmath86 . this is equivalent to the hamiltonian of the bilayer graphene except that @ xmath25 and @ xmath87 @ xmath88 are replaced by @ xmath89 . thus the hamiltonian of odd - layer graphene is composed of both monolayer - type and @ xmath90 bilayer - type subbands while that of even - layer graphene is composed of @ xmath91 bilayers and one monolayer . the same basis was also usedfor trilayer graphene without @ xmath26 , where it is shown that the energy difference is a sum of that for a monolayer and for a bilayer . @ xcite - we have extended this result to independence of the hamiltonian basis , and to systems with any number of states except the ground state . we also showed that @ xmath48 - independence of the basis is shown in the following section , since this allows us to model the system as a sum of states from sub - hamiltonians , which are then independent . several other parameters were used for the prediction of the electronic structure of these materials . @ xcite the the @ xmath92 are group i and ii atoms depending on the neighboring layers , such as @ xmath93 and @ xmath94 . this parameter does not affect the bonding energy of the low - energy state and therefore is gauge invariant . @ xcite the @ xmath95 and @ xmath96 are energy hoppings on the low - order neighboring layers for group i and ii atoms , respectively . similarly , @ xmath97 is the energy difference between the group i and ii atoms due to changes in the surrounding layers .use of these parameters @ xmath95 , @ xmath96 , and @ xmath97 allows filling up of the band gap between the bonding and the transition bands . however , these parameters do not play important roles in the model as will be seen in the figure . the 2d limit , @ xmath98 , the eigenstate is a pair of parallel plane waves with @ xmath99 in the same band . the difference between the parameters @ xmath63 and @ xmath100 is obtained by replacing the eigenenergy of @ xmath60 , fig . ( [ x _ 1d ] ) , to that of the 2d limit , @ xmath101 , to @ xmath102 the 3d limit of the hamiltonian ( [ x _ 2 ] ) can be obtained by replacing @ xmath25 by @ xmath103 and @ xmath26 by @ xmath104 to that of the bilayer . @ xcite we see in fig . [ x _ band0 ] the expression for @ xmath105 , which has the same band gap . the expressiontwo subbands stand out in @ xmath106 . the other two bands are located in the energy range @ xmath107 . if we define @ xmath26 , the corresponding hamiltonian for @ xmath108 is @ xmath109 which accounts for the same energy @ xmath110 ( a gauge invariant system with the same energy @ xmath111 ) with @ xmath105 and @ xmath112 . @ xmath113 is represented by two spectral lines . right side of points outside of the band . ( 3 ) a point of the same spectral power at the band touching point . the two parts of @ xmath4 represented by , . , [ = 302 ] the band corresponding to @ xmath26 is used for the double shell state , which is only apparent at the band touching point @ xmath114 . let us define @ xmath115 in the energy range @ xmath116 , the spectral line splits into four equal parts , a central part and two side parts , trigonally , which split into two equal points starting with @ xmath117 . wenote that @ xmath118 is similar to @ xmath119 and is very close to @ xmath89 , so the energy of the fig - band atom , @ xmath103 , is similar to @ xmath89 . the energy of @ xmath89 becomes smaller as the band thickness increases , so that @ xmath118 is as large as @ xmath120 mev . the [ table _ 1 ] shows the band structure of the @ xmath1 atom in the @ xmath121 band of the multilayer graphenes with @ xmath122 , 3 , 4 , and 5 and @ xmath123 . the energies of @ xmath124 are shown by @ xmath125 . we have used @ xmath23 , @ xmath25 , and @ xmath26 in our graphene calculations , the last two used only to explain the changes in the band structure . the fig structure of the multi - ##layer graphene has been used in the density functional calculations @ xcite and the fig - band calculations . @ xcite those calculations differ from ours , in that the atomic structure will change depending on@ xmath63 , and that an open gap exists where the emission and absorption bands ( with values different @ xmath63 ) touch , and where the bands ( with different @ xmath63 values ) touch . these are due to effects of parameters such as @ xmath95 , @ xmath96 , and @ xmath97 , which are described below . in terms of the standard quantum hamiltonian ( [ x _ 1 ] ) , those parameters appear as matrix elements without being described by the quantum numbers @ xmath121 and @ xmath126 , since they are associated with a direction on the @ xmath127 side of the matrix element . however , they do not appear in @ xmath128 ( @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 ) and provide the energy to fill the gap . apart from the gap effect , the general structure of the crystal lattice is well understood in the following article . it should also be noted that the open gap is caused by an electric field perpendicular to the crystal boundary plane , @ xcite where the electric field appears as matrix elements instead of @ xmath12##1 and @ xmath126 as well . with @ xmath123 , where the @ xmath1 axis ( known as 0 ) is the @ xmath121 axis . the figure shows the cut - out of the diagram . numbers attached to brackets are @ xmath63 . , [ = 302 ] for the bulk case , we write the following equation based on the frequency response of , @ xcite @ xmath129 with @ xmath130 where @ xmath131 is the grain size , @ xmath132 is the chemical number , and @ xmath133 is the valley temperature . we write [ @ xmath134 , @ xmath135 , @ xmath136 , and @ xmath137 ^ { - 1 } $ ] with the chemical number @ xmath138 and the temperature @ xmath139 . the term used only for the hamiltonian ( [ see : bilayer _ spin _ theory ] ) is given in ref [ see _ app _ 1 ] . by addition of terms in ref . ( [ see _ 2 ] ) , weand @ xmath140 such that the scattering at non - zero temperature is expressed in terms of that at zero temperature . the contribution of @ xmath141 and @ xmath138 equals that of @ xmath139 . we calculate the observed scattering rate by adding the half - term @ xmath142 . the resulting delta function , i . e . , @ xmath143 , ( [ x _ 1 ] ) is given by @ xmath144 . thus we can assume the scattering rate @ xmath145 to be independent of temperature . using the decomposition of the hamiltonian , the contribution of the @ xmath5 - free graphene can be expressed as a function of the z - hamiltonian . the contribution from @ xmath64 is approximately equal to the contribution of the monolayer graphene , @ xcite which is at zero energy and is the excited state , @ xmath146 however , the mono - layer graphene also has a small scattering rate at zero temperature . the delta - function decomposition of @ xmath147 corresponds with the above description of the scattering in general .by the @ xmath148 - based hamiltonian , as described in ref . [ q _ 1 ] . in the case of disorder , the wave - function is divided into the lorentzian with constant @ xmath149 and the peak at , @ xcite i . e . @ xmath150 in the standard model has a peak @ xmath149 . the size of the peak itself depends on the model , and we can use the different types of model for a more general purpose . in particular , for the monolayer graphene it is found by the self - consistent standard model @ xcite that @ xmath141 has a much larger peak at @ xmath151 than the lorentzian and has a smaller peak compared to @ xmath152 for @ xmath153 . @ xcite in multi - band , cases of disorder are more common because of the presence of multiple peaks . this article is out of the scope of this article . the structure of the bilayer graphene described by the hamiltonian ( [ q _ 1 ] ) was first studied for the case of @ xmath154 . @ xcite the expression for @xmath155 and @ xmath156 are replaced by @ xmath157 with @ xmath86 , where @ xmath158 is the quantum number . for @ xmath159 the peak increases rapidly toward @ xmath0 , becomes much smaller for @ xmath160 , and peaks for @ xmath161 where the red subband disappears . in the absence of doping , the energy range is defined again as @ xmath162 . the integral of @ xmath141 in fig . ( [ e _ chi _ mono ] ) over the laser energy is @ xmath163 independent of @ xmath25 , which is about twice as large as that of the monolayer graphene ( [ e _ chi _ mono ] ) . this is due to the fact that the integration of @ xmath141 over the energy level is defined only in terms of the hamiltonian term , not to @ xmath121 and @ xmath126 , and is independent of and independent of @ xmath121 and @ xmath126 . .proof of this important fact is given in fig . [ fig _ disc ] . if we add the additional disorder parameter @ xmath26 , the maximum - order structure of the band ( [ fig _ fig _ hm ] ) also changes due to the crystal structure of the atoms within it . to see this , we can compute @ xmath141 for the hamiltonian ( [ fig _ hm ] ) in the case of the maximum order structure , @ xmath164 . ( [ fig _ disc ] plots the state as a function of @ xmath165 with some values of @ xmath149 . we calculate @ xmath166 , where the # ##onic shift occurs much earlier than @ xmath167 . for this we can plot the state without the band splitting , @ xmath168 , with a dashed curve . ) plot the multilayer graphene with @ xmath169 , @ xmath123 and the disorder parameters @ xmath149 . this is measured in terms of @ xmath167 . dashed lines indicate values for @ xmath170 . shown on the right is thelook out of the top panel ( @ xmath171 ) with values of energy @ xmath25 . , [ = 302 ] when we look down from the top of the bottom panel ( the figure @ xmath149 ) , the energy curve changes slightly from the initial value of @ xmath168 , and shows a small peak at @ xmath172 . then we see a small peak centered at @ xmath4 , which is regarded as the center of the electronic portion of the molecule . the ratio of @ xmath141 to the low energy is approximately at @ xmath173 as shown in ref . [ the _ figure ] , suggesting that the peak at high energy is the higher energy peak . as @ xmath149 gets smaller , the peak begins to decrease with the increase in the energy and the peak of @ xmath26 ##1 disappears when @ xmath174 . in contrast , the peak associated with the monolayer of @ xmath64 is at ##est @ xmath149 and eventually disappears , as shown in ref . ( [ see : monolayer _ with _ electrons ] ). . [ fig _ chi _ multi ] . @ xmath175 of graphenes with layer numbers from @ xmath176 to 5 with different band structures @ xmath149 . for @ xmath177 , we show the peak from each of bilayer - type bands . the band of 5 @ xmath5 also contains a monolayer - like component , which is exactly the same as @ xmath176 and is shown from the figure . we can see that multi - ##layer graphenes have a very large peak , which also comes from the monolayer - type bands . the bilayer - like component has a small peak due to the band structure and a small peak in the band , in contrast with fig . [ fig _ chi ] . the layer - number dependence of the structure of multilayer graphene has been demonstrated for the lattice based system . @ xcite this system can be described as two multilayer graphenes separated by the intercalant gap , where the intercalants have a strong driving force in the z direction , due to the charge transfer among the layers . @ xcite as a result the band structure and the chargeis very different from our case with a strong magnetic field in the opposite direction . for the multilayer graphenes , from these experiments , we can see the temperature difference among layers depending on the experimental conditions , and this may also be affected by the applied magnetic field already described . in sec . [ s _ 1 ] , we can show that , as long as the field is not too strong to affect the actual crystal structure , this does not affect the physical properties of the material . the peak landau distribution in the bilayer - wide subband comes from light - scattering waves arriving at the landau levels . from the above experiment for the bilayer , @ xcite we can show that the sum of the landau levels in the central pocket , of @ xmath178 with @ xmath179 , and those in the outer pockets of @ xmath180 , where @ xmath181 is the bond length . since the sum is calculated directly from landau level distribution , we apply this to the monolayer ##s of @ xmath182 and to @ xmath141 from the above by using @ xmath183 . sec . ( [ s _ s _fine ] ) . we end up with @ xmath184 , for a slight deviation from the average of the two energy states . the lower - energy state in fig . [ chi _ fine ] corresponds exactly to the lorentzian with parameters @ xmath149 and the value of the delta - function ( [ fig _ chi _ fine ] ) , as well as @ xmath185 . the area corresponding to @ xmath147 is as small as 0 . 5 when @ xmath164 and @ xmath123 , and so the area is not too large compared with that of the monolayer . for @ xmath5 - layered graphene , a simple calculation @ xmath186 corresponds to the area of ( [ fig _ chi _ fine ] ) over all the bilayer - spanning subbands , @ xmath187 in fig . [ fig _ chi _ multi ] the peak area is a little larger than this , due to interactions with the molecular bonds . the delta - function area of @ xmath141 - monolayer graphene is a common feature corresponding to the @ xmath148 - layered hamiltonian . this can beinvariant by the scale rule . we have a hamiltonian @ xmath188 which has the coefficients of ##ly @ xmath121 and @ xmath126 . we change the energy and natural number functions by an inverse transformation @ xmath189 and @ xmath190 . the hamiltonian is almost invariant under this transformation , since the coefficients of @ xmath148 - linear terms of the hamiltonian remain unchanged . looking back to the coefficients of @ xmath141 , ( [ f _ chi ] ) and ( [ e _ chi ] ) , @ xmath191 is defined as @ xmath192 the energy @ xmath193 should depend only on the coefficients of @ xmath148 - linear terms and natural numbers , and it is invariant under the scale rule , so we have @ xmath194 . with ( [ e _ e _ chi ] ) , we come up with a function , @ xmath195 which is invariant and by @ xmath196 the function @ xmath15 is equal to the integral of the energy @ xmath175 over the entire surface @ xmath##165 . from ( [ e _ li ] ) , we can obtain @ xmath197 where the integral over @ xmath198 is a circle with the integral axis with counter - clockwise direction . in the original model , ( [ e _ f _ explicit ] ) , is the integral over @ xmath199 . this is the integral of the energy as @ xmath200 and it is zero . from sec . ( [ e _ f _ explicit ] ) with energy @ xmath15 ##5 sec . ( [ e _ li ] ) , we can obtain the energy integral of the low - energy as as @ xmath201 . . in sec . [ e _ li ] , the band structure in the recent models has an energy gap of negative energy due to the band structure level in the original model . it is also known that the external electric field in these states has an energy gap . one would expect that the theory would not predict the effective energy at the band structure level . however , we can see from the negative energy gap that the distribution of energy as @ xmath165 is independent of the number of band elements without@ xmath121 and @ xmath126 , which are adjusted for gap width . this is clear from the above equation ( [ x _ 1 _ oint ] ) ; even if the hamiltonian contains @ xmath148 - independent terms in addition to @ xmath148 - independent terms , they can be easily ignored in the calculation because they are small compared to @ xmath202 and the corresponding @ xmath198 . in the low - energy state of the multilayer graphene we will notice that the state is independent of @ xmath25 , @ xmath95 , @ xmath96 , @ xmath97 , and all other parameters outside of the wave function . thus we conclude that the original energy state is still present even when the gap narrows , although it may be reduced in size with the gap width . the first of these two states is known as the @ xcite and was discovered for the experimental super ##nova . @ xcite the above calculation requires a direct calculation of the integral of the energy , but we leave this for the following discussion . the calculation of the suscept##ibility can be obtained from the hamiltonian with the @ xmath148 - linear modes and , and it depends only on the energy gap associated with @ xmath148 - . ##ization . in our model ( [ x _ 1 ] ) , the value is only determined by the base mode @ xmath23 , and @ xmath26 is the correction for all of the energies of @ xmath203 . the correction must be the dominant term of @ xmath26 because we can convert @ xmath26 to @ xmath204 of the hamiltonian with a linear combination of the base - modes @ xmath17 and @ xmath205 . as a result , the value of @ xmath175 for the bilayer - based hamiltonian becomes approximately twice as large as the monolayer s , and the value for all the modes of @ xmath5 - linear graphene becomes with @ xmath5 twice as large as the monolayer s . it is possible to calculate the value directly from the base - type model . for the monolayer graphene , the base mode @ xmath206 is the[ @ xmath207 \ , \ } , \ begin { align } \ ] ] where @ xmath208 , @ xmath209 with @ xmath210 , and @ xmath211 the exponential term which then goes to zero for @ xmath212 with the integral @ xmath213 . we can write this as @ xmath214 where @ xmath215 , \ ] ] with @ xmath216 . taking the integral @ xmath217 with respect to @ xmath218 , we will have @ xmath219 \ nonumber \ \ = & \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! & \ int _ h ^ \ infty h ( x ) = \ - { 1 \ over 12 } h ^ [ \ !

( [ q : high _ energy : _ monolayer _ graphene ] ) , as is usual . for the bilayer graphene , the effective energy with @ xmath154 in the region @ xmath230 can be calculated from the hamiltonian ( [ q : bilayer _ high _ energy ] ) : @ xcite @ xmath231 where @ xmath232 with @ xmat##h233 represented by fig . ( [ h _ mstar ] ) , @ xmath234 , and @ xmath235 . we have two quantum states with zero energy ( @ xmath236 , @ xmath234 ) , and the energy band gets higher as @ xmath237 gets higher . in a similar but more complicated way , the energy is calculated as @ xmath238 which also represents the energy band with zero energy in the rigorous expression ( [ e _ chi _ t ] ) , as well . the second term value of energy is ignored in fig . ( [ e _ chi _ t _ t ] ) since this depends on all the zero - energy states which are used in this expression . we can understand the rigorous expression simply by looking into the landau - level energy . the landau level energy can be calculated for [ @ xmath237 , @ xmath239 , \ ] ] where the first term represents the zero energy , and the second gives a step toward zero energy , which is calculated as @ xmath240 . for @ xmath241, for example , the change in the total energy due to the temperature change is expressed as @ xmath242 with the @ xmath243 dependence of the temperature . for the hamiltonian ( [ see : bilayer _ total _ energy ] ) with energy equal to @ xmath244 , the above relation ( [ sec _ chi ] ) with ( [ app _ f ] ) is no longer valid , since this is only valid for systems in which @ xmath245 agrees with @ xmath246 and @ xmath247 . the above transformation should yield @ xmath248 this is expressed simply as [ chi _ app _ f ] . a further transformation applied to the case of the monolayer graphene , yields @ xmath249 . this then leads to the temperature dependence of @ xmath141 on the total energy , which agrees with ( [ sec _ chi _ app _ f ] ) resulting from the gap . the first studies of the behavior of two - dimensional quantum dots were done in the first heterostructures , by using the superconducting quantum dot device ( sip ) @xcite is by the following method . @ xcite we found that the prediction of the graphene disorder is also possible with those methods . we have modeled the atomic structure of multilayer graphene with the bernal effect and the effective mass equation . we have shown that the hamiltonian and therefore the energy can be divided into those corresponding to the monolayer and bilayer bands . the monolayer - like band exists only in two - dimensional graphenes and gives a strong energy peak at @ xmath250 . the bilayer - like bands also exist and give a strong peak in the region of low energy , unless the internal atomic structure described by @ xmath26 is affected by the effect . this work has been funded in part by the 21st century coe ##d , center for large - scale semiconductor research and by grants - in - aid for scientific research from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan . we have in the form the effective mass equation : . ( [ x _ n ] ) = energy in the case of @ xmath1 , for a multilayer graphene , and energy from the zero - energy bi - band state .the model is simple but not useful because of the monolayer model . @ xcite in the self - binding model , the wave function is written as @ xmath251 , \ { { 1 } \ ] ] where @ xmath252 is the atomic position , @ xmath253 is the wave function of the @ xmath254 state of a single site , near the origin , as a component of two - dimensional position @ xmath255 . @ xmath256 is the two - dimensional position of the state @ xmath257 , and @ xmath258 is the two - dimensional position of @ xmath259 , closer to the origin . in the case of the states @ xmath23 , @ xmath25 , and @ xmath26 ##0 in s . [ # _ 1 ] , schrdinger # ##nr can be written as follows : for [ @ xmath17 , @ xmath260 , \ \ \ vare \ , _ { b _ { j } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ _ $ } } _ { b _ { j } } ) & = & - \ \_ = \ psi _ { j = 1 } ^ { \ psi _ { a _ { j } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { a _ { j } } + { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ 1 ) \ nonumber \ \ & & \ hspace { 1 } } + \ gamma _ 1 \ , [ \ psi _ { a _ { j + 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { a _ { j } } ) + \ psi _ { b _ { j - 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { b _ { j } } ) \ ] ] . \ , \ begin { x _ sch1 } \ begin { 1 } \ ] ] for [ @ xmath17 , @ xmath261 , \ , \ \ \ vare \ psi _ { a _ { j } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { a _ { j } } ) & = & - \ gamma _ 1 \a _ { l = 1 } ^ 3 \ psi _ { a _ { j } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { a _ { j } } + { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ l ) \ nonumber \ \ & & \ hspace { - 1 \ } + \ psi _ { \ psi _ { j = 1 } ^ 3 \ left [ \ psi _ { a _ { j + 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { b _ { j } } - { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ l ) + \ psi _ { a _ { j - 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ { a _ { j } } - { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ tau $ } } _ l ) \ right ] . \ left { a _ sch2 } \ { { \ } \ ] ] . we map the distance from b sites to the distance to a sites : @ xmath262 , @ xmat##h263 , and @ xmath264 , and we have @ xmath265 . the result of @ xmath1 , can be expressed in terms of the time - varying envelope functions @ xmath266 , @ xmath267 where @ xmath268 , and @ xmath269 , @ xmath270 are the functions used by @ xmath271 with @ xmath272 . when @ xmath273 is much less than the full value of the envelope function , we replace @ xmath274 with @ xmath275 , @ xmath7 . by replacing e . ( [ e _ env ] ) with ( [ e _ approx ] ) , into schrdinger integral ##s ( [ e _ sch1 ] ) and ( [ e _ sch2 ] ) , we have for example @ xmath17 , @ xmath276 \ nonumber \ \ \ vare f _ { b _ j } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ \ $ } } ) & = & \ \ f _ + f _ { b _ j }( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) + \ gamma _ + \ left [ f _ { a _ { j - 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) + f _ { a _ { j + 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) \ right ] , \ nonumber \ \ \ { { \ } \ ] ] and for [ @ xmath17 , @ xmath277 , \ nonumber \ \ \ vare f _ { j _ 1 } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) & = & \ gamma _ _ + f _ { a _ 1 } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) + \ gamma ' f _ - \ left [ f _ { a _ { j - 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) + f _ { a _ { j + 1 } } ( { \ mbox { \ boldmath $ \ pi $ } } ) \ right ], \ nonumber \ \ \ [ { 0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath21 with @ xmath278 , @ xmath279 . we have derived the equation @ xmath280 if we divided this system of equations into the following : for the system @ xmath281 , we can obtain the hamiltonian matrix ( [ e _ c ] ) . the effective hamiltonian for the system @ xmath282 can be derived in a similar manner , where @ xmath283 and @ xmath284 are given by : . ( [ e _ c ] ) . the corresponding equation ( [ e _ e ] ) with ( [ e _ c ] ) has been derived for the luttinger - kohn solution of the differential equation @ xcite and valid for systems characterized by the hamiltonian matrix of the total linear kinetic energy @ xmath285 and the angular momentum @ xmath286 . @ xcite we obtain from the same formula which is valid for the effective hamiltonian @ xmath287 which includes @ xmath148 - related terms in off - diagonal linear form as well .@ xmath148 - these equations . we shall restrict ourselves to the case without electron - hole interactions for simplicity . consider the system described by the schrdinger equation @ xmath288 with @ xmath289 and @ xmath290 as the gauge fields . the resulting equation @ xmath206 is given by @ xmath291 \ , \ } \ nonumber \ \ & = & - k _ { \ rm r } \ \ , k _ { \ rm r } \ frac { 1 } { 1 } \ int { \ varepsilon \ , \ , ( \ ! - \ ! { - \ , \ ! } \ , ) { \ rm # ##0 } \ , { \ rm tr } \ , \ frac { 1 } { \ vare - { \ cal ##c } + i0 } \ nonumber \ \ & & \ qquad \ qquad \ , \ ln \ , \ { - \ ! + \ ! \ exp [ \ big ( \ ! \ ! - \ ! \ varepsilon ) ] \ , \ } , \ , { f _ 1 } \ , { 1 } \] ] where @ xmath292 is the system entropy and @ xmath293 is the system entropy . we consider an ideal system and consider the vector potential @ xmath294 , with @ xmath295 where we are going to consider the short vector field @ xmath296 , for which the field causes the scattering the same as that due to a perfectly uniform magnetic field . in the absence of this vector potential , the hamiltonian changes from @ xmath297 to @ xmath298 , with @ xmath299 , where @ xmath300 . the hamiltonian can be expanded to @ xmath301 where @ xmath302 , @ xmath303 , and @ xmath304 . note that for the @ xmath148 - the hamiltonian @ xmath305 does not agree with @ xmath246 but agrees with @ xmath306 . expanding the hamiltonian up to the last term of the term of the magnetic field @ xmath16 , we get @ xmath307 where @ xmath308 is the magnetic field , @ xmat##h309 , @ xmath310 , and we find that the solution is scale invariant ( unlike the scale change in the case of carbon ) . we then modify @ xmath311 , to the last term , @ xmath312 , to replace @ xmath313 with @ xmath314 . this solution gives the solution of the surface of @ xmath315 with cf . ( [ f _ n ] ) . the solution @ xmath141 is given by the solution @ xmath316 , @ xmath317 this gives cf .
