it has been known for several decades that most low - mass x - ray stars ( lmxbs ) are @ xmath1 and occur in galaxy clusters ( ngc ) close to the galactic center ( katz 1975 ; smith 1975 ) . more specifically , ngc contains all of the @ xmath1 and ngc lmxbs , but only @ xmath20 . 01 % of the total total stellar population of the galaxy . the reason for this is thought to be the lack of _ _ _ lmxb formation channels , which are commonly found in galaxy star clusters . other examples include the direct interaction of a massive star ( neutron ) with two gas giants ( verbunt 1987 , smith et al . 1992 , ivanova et al . 2005 ) , the direct interaction of a main sequence star by a planet ( smith , pringle & rees 1975 ; bailyn & grindlay 1987 ) and the processes between nss and neutron stars ( smith 1976 ; rasio et al . 2000 ) . if the observed lmxb formation channels are located between galaxies and the galactic field , the composition of their individual lmxb components may also be different . in addition , some of the observed lmx##bs ) which may be ultracompact x - ray objects ( ucxbs ; bildsten & deloye 2004 , ivanova et al . ucxbs , which are small objects with relatively large angular dimensions ( @ xmath3 min ) and short rotation periods ( @ xmath4 - 5 ) , seem to be rare amongst the wide ##st lmxb population : the list of confirmed ucxbs ( with numbers @ xmath5 ) from int zand et al . ( 2007 ) lists only 5 objects that belong to this group . in comparison , three of the 5 known lmxbs are confirmed ucxbs ; these are 4u1820 - 02 in ngc6624 ( @ xmath6 min , homer et al . 1987 ) , 4u1850 - 087 in ngc6712 ( @ xmath7 min , homer et al . 1996 ) and cxoj212958 . 1 + 121002 - m15 ( = m15 - x2 ; dieball et al . 2005 ) , with all three thought to be ultracompact x - ray objects on the basis of some recent observations ( see e . g . verbunt & lewin2006 for a review ) . since the mass distribution of the lmxbs could be a direct result of the many close encounters taking place in their vicinity , it is important to ensure the stability for as many of these systems as possible . doing so could potentially lead to a significant increase in the size of the total ucxb population . this is important , because ucxbs are astrophysically stable systems in their own right . this is because they provide opportunities for galactic and star formation in many cases , and because they are powerful gravitational wave sources that can be detected by lisa ( nelemans & jonker 2006 ; nelemans 2009 ) . first , we have well - resolved , far - uv images of the lmxb 4u 0513 - 1 in ngc 1851 , which is confirmed to be a ucxb based on several lines of experimental evidence ( deutsch etal 2000 ; verbunt 2005 ; nelemans & jonker 2006 ; int zand etal . 2007 ) . our far - uv images of this system show a @ xmath8 - x ##x ##ity that is present in all three star systems , is consistent with being stable and is not caused by a gravitational wavealong with the dark matter of the central star of this system . based on all this , we conclude that the observed brightness variation is an observed anomaly , and therefore that 4u 0513 - 1 should be regarded as a true ucxb with @ xmath9 observations . ngc 1851 was observed three times with the f140lp instrument from the large system camera ( sbc ) of the infrared survey for science ( ars ) on board the _ hst _ . this camera / detector / filter combination has a plate scale of 0 . 032 pixel @ xmath10 , a maximum bandwidth of @ xmath11 , and an rms resolution of @ xmath12 . all of the observations took place in march of 2006 . the observation record consists of the _ hst _ orbit , broken down into a series of 30 orbital periods . in total , we obtained 273 of these orbits . in addition , we also obtained three images taken in march of 1999 with the space telescope imaging system ( stis ) , using the fuv - 1 / f25qtz camera / filter combination , with a plate scale of 0 . 025 pixel @ xmath10 , @ xmath13 and @ xmath14. a detailed description of the techniques , as well as their development and improvement will be given in a subsequent paper ( zurek et al . 2009 , in press ) . however , most of the fuv count rates and distances used in this paper are calculated via other image measurement methods , as described in the _ daophot _ section and _ iraf _ . for the resolution of our ac / sbc ( stis / fuv - mama ) instrument , we need an aperture value of 7 ( 7 ) pixels and a background value ranging from 10 to 35 ( 20 to 35 ) pixels . this value is useful for our instrument because the fuv area is not very large ( see figure 1 ) . the aperture - relative aperture ##s of the ac / sbc / f140lp and stis / fuv - mama / f25qtz aperture / radius / background instruments are very similar , but not identical . . we corrected for near - field interference by comparing the aperture and stis count rates , and checking for the differences and the different relative aperture ##s and background values that are used . we then calculated this correction factor from a set of ( very narrow - band ) values that are common to both instrumentsof chandra . we note that for these objects , our ap / sbc distance estimates are 1 . 5 times higher than our stis / f25qtz estimates . homer et al . ( 2001 ) had already used the hst / stis / f25qtz data to determine the visible / far - infrared properties of 4u 0513 - 40 . they followed the conclusion of deutsch et al . ( 2000 ) that ` ` star a ' ' ( in the words of deutsch et al . ) is the true counterpart to the lmxb , and two other nearby stars , identified as correct counterparts by aurire , saint - bidaud & saint - miramond ( 1994 ) , such as x - 1 and x - 2b , are consistent with the original chandra measurements of 4u 0513 - 40 . figure 1 shows the positions of these 3 objects in our ap / sbc images . since homer et al . ( 2001 ) had already conducted a successful search for far - uv sources associated with star a in the stis images , we proceed by focusing on the later , higher signal - to - noise ratio observations . the chandra - based far - infrared light sources of these three objects are shown in figure 2 .it is immediately obvious that star a , the candidate proposed by deutsch et al . ( 2000 ) and smith et al . ( 2001 ) , does , in fact , show significant far - uv variability , especially between the 3 different periods . for example , the spectral count rate varies by a factor of about 1 between periods 2 and 3 . a significant variation in count rate is observed between periods x - 2a and x - 2b , which place star a in far - uv variability . we have searched for _ b _ n in the data by carrying out a simple statistical analysis . figure 1 shows the lomb - scargle ##n values obtained for all the stars from the previous two data sets . it is immediately obvious that neither star a shows any evidence of a signal at a frequency other than hst mid - infrared ( @ xmath15 ) . more specifically , there is an amplitude signal at a frequency of both @ xmath16 min and @ xmath10 ( which corresponds to a period of @ xmath17 min ) . in an attempt to better give the star a power spectrum ( both the power spectrum at @ xmath15 and the sidebands at @ xmath18 ) , we have developed a simple modelpower excess . this data has essentially the same frequency sampling as the above , contains a strong 17 - min peak signal with ~ 1 . 5 % at @ xmath10 and accounts for the high long - term variability in the data by increasing the simulated photon emission rate for each epoch relative to the observed data . the power excess resulting from this last analysis ##less noise is shown in the second quadrant of figure 4 ( labeled ` ` in the simulation ' ' ) , and it illustrates some of the important features of the data . this means that both the sidebands at @ xmath19 and the strong peak signal at @ xmath15 show significant differences . the difference , in part , is due to interference from the high - frequency power curve associated with the long - term variability . in order to determine if the 17 min peak was present , we carried out power excess analysis for each time period , where we had previously analyzed the stis data that was collected 3 years before the observed data . the result is shown in figure 4 . the peak was clearly present in all three periods ( 1 stis + 1 c ) , but was much smaller in the stis epoch and in the 1 ##c period . taken in total , the power excess0 @ xmath19 . each of those values would be very significant at present . " figures 3 and 4 show that there are four different values associated with the 50 hz signal . in order to determine the mean values for each of these and get rid of the errors associated with each of them , we carried out a statistical analysis . only the above data was used for this analysis , since the correlation is weak in the stis data and since the average mean value cannot be applied to the entire time interval between the stis and the data . we started by eliminating long - term errors from the data and by taking the mean count values for each hst interval and removing these errors from the data . next , we compared 1000 different time intervals of data with samples from the orbit - mean - mean power spectrum . finally , we calculated power spectra for each of these 1000 time intervals and recorded the values corresponding to the intervals . the data obtained from this collection of sample frequencies is shown in figure 5 ( based on the orbit - mean ##tracted power spectrum for each of the intervals , which is shown in the spectral chart ) . as seen from the power spectrum , there are only two possible spectral values. the total number of maximum peaks associated with each alias provides a measure of the probability that this alias is the correct alias ( see southworth et al 2006 , 2007 , 2008 and dillon et al . 2008 ) . also , the number and size of the maximum peak associated with each alias provides a good measure of the amplitude and phase distribution for this alias . our initial results for the three possible alias were : @ xmath20 we also wanted to test very closely whether the observed amplitude is consistent with being constant across all of our observations and whether the evidence for a constant amplitude is sufficient . to this end , we carried out a least - squares test to the root - mean - square stis + ac parameters used for alias formation . in this case , the amplitude was not parameters from @ xmath21 that were included in the original value of the _ [ _ stis + ac ] . ] , and the only parameters were the phase and amplitude ( both assumed to be constant across the observations ) . the result of this experiment is shown in figure 1 . this shows quite clearly that the amplitude is not constant across observations . as we saw above , the amplitude is constant at the points 1 and 2 and atcompare the stis , and cas data sets . the data set shows that the assumption of constant amplitude is correct , i . e . the average amplitude is consistent with being coherent throughout the entire data set . in order both to study further the physical properties of the data , and to estimate the average amplitude , we can fit the combined stis + cas data set for star formation onto the same ( non - ) data that was used for the measurements in figure 6 . the fit is shown in figure 7 , along with the double - binned average signal . overall , the measurements appear to be consistent with the assumption that the signal is not coherent . however , the average amplitude is fairly uniform and nearly spherical . in the second step , we carry out several measurements with different parameters to the data epoch in order to quantify the average amplitude of the 17 - day period . table 1 shows the observed decay rate and amplitude as well as relative amplitude of the signal as obtained from these measurements . the average amplitude varies by about a factor of 10 between observations , from about 5 % to 10 % , with the greatest variation occurring during the 17 - day period between the observations 2 and 3 . it is also worth noting thatthere appears to be a correlation between the fuv frequency of the system ( i . e . the photon ##ic frequency ) and the amplitude of the 17 - min signal , in the sense that the amplitude is greatest when the system is excited . this relationship holds regardless of whether the amplitude is measured in absolute or relative terms . it is worth noting that there is a contradiction between our assumption that the 17 - min signal is present in the stis data , and the non - existence of a signal in the original data set by homer et al . ( 2001 ) . as mentioned above , the signal is only truly present if this data set is studied in detail . what makes the weak signal signal in the stis data possible is that it is transmitted at the same frequency as the strong signal in the same data set . therefore , homer et al . ( 2001 ) put a theoretical upper limit of 5 % on the amplitude of the signal between 17 min and 17 min . this is also consistent with our previous assumption of a 5 % limit for the 17 min signal in the stis data ( see figure 2 ) . we have shown that the fuv corresponding to 4u 0513 - 1 in ngc 1851 is a clear periodic ##ity with@ xmath0 ##3 . this signal is roughly spherical , has an amplitude of 1 % - 5 % , is observed in all known fuv observation data and is consistent with observations well resolved . these characteristics are in agreement with those of the optical signals observed in infrared / visible observations of the ucxb ( e . g . anderson et al . 1996 ; anderson et al . 1997 ; dieball et al . 2005 ) and with a simple model in which these signals are due to the ` ` halo effect ' ' associated with the first donor star in the system ( arons & king 1993 ) . in the arons & king ( 1993 ) model , there are two sources that contribute to the fuv / optical signal : the large orbital face of the donor star ( which is assumed to be a low - mass , cold - core white dwarf ) , and the surrounding disk , whose material content is largely dominated by matter . the large # signal is due to the high surface temperature of the orbital face of the donor star , with the large # ##s caused by the high sensitivity of the star and disk to the phase - shifted fuv / optical light . we have shown that this simple modeland for observing the same fuv , with a range of frequencies ( with a mid - to - high amplitude ) . the effect of the fuv signal is determined primarily by the fuv response of the donor and donor to changes in the observed x - ray intensity . in this context , a combination of @ xmath8 , 1 in total fuv and brightness change would produce about an order of magnitude change from @ xmath22 . this is consistent with the x - ray variability of the source in the rxte data set , where upwards of 100 % in decay rate are observed on time - scales as small as 1 . for example , the well - defined changes in x - ray intensity from this source require a factor of 2 ( grindlay & smith 1983 ) . it is likely that other factors such as changes in pressure , changes in ambient temperature , and increased temperature , play a significant role in the change of the amplitude of the source signal . based on all this , we are convinced that the fuv signal we have observed is gravitational in origin and therefore leads to a strong gravitational interaction . we now identify 4u 0513 - 1 , and ucxb with @ x##math17 ##4 , making it the second largest ucxb in a known cluster . the identification of this system as a ucxb is also consistent with the experimental evidence for its existence . more specifically , the high mass , x - ray emission and physical properties of 4u 0513 - 1 have been known for some time to point towards a ucxb origin ( e . g . verbunt 2005 ) . given the relatively short orbital period we have observed , it is difficult to see if the gravitational potential energy emitted by this system would be detected by lisa . the mean radiated power for a circular orbit is given in a simplified way by nelemans , yungelson & portegies zwart ( 2001 ) as : @ xmath23 where @ xmath24 , @ xmath25 is the mass of the neutron star primary , and @ xmath26 is the mass of the white dwarf secondary , and with the radiation coming almost entirely from the outer half , for a circular orbit . if we have @ xmath27 , @ xmath28 kpc ( brown 1996 ) and @ xmath29 ( and for this @ xmath5 ) the mean - radiated formula of deloye &bildsten [ 2003 ] ) , we consider the value of @ xmath30 . this is only about the sub - @ xmath31 value for a given time associated with lisa , suggesting that the signal will be stable if the sample time is several years . in practice , this may , however , strongly depend on the position and time - evolution of the gravitational - wave source due to the wds , which may be significant in the higher frequency range ( @ xmath32 ) ; e . g . nelemans et al . an additional challenge for measuring the signal from this source will be dealing with the possible effect of location of the source on the magnetic field of the galaxy cluster , which could lead to a large frequency variation over many years , for which a correction would need to be made in order to measure all the gravitational wave sources in a single frequency range . the fact that the location and time of the source are well known ( and the signal can therefore be significantly altered once lisa begins ) may be helpful in this regard and help solve the single source problem . we also point out that , as the ucxb parameters are further studied , it is more likely that there are large changes in the spatial distribution of theand field ucxbs . all four of the confirmed field ucxbs have @ xmath33 min , whereas all four of the confirmed field ucxbs have @ xmath34 min ( nelemans & jonker 2006 ; int zand , jonker & markwardt 2007 ) . however , this situation can not always be solved in absolute value : the quantum numbers are still very large and their values have not been taken into account . furthermore , there is still no clear dividing line between the different orbital period distributions . for example , the galaxy lmxb 4u 1543 - 624 ##b has an orbital period of around 10 years ( wang & chakrabarty 2004 ) , even though it is not yet included in the list of field ucxbs published by nelemans & jonker ( 2006 ) and int zand et al . ( 2007 ) . therefore , the period distributions are in agreement with the idea that the ucxb decay ##s should occur in the two different environments . if so , it may be useful to use the period distribution of field ucxbs as a trace of binary evolution , and that of field ucxbs as a trace of binary evolution in both environments . this work is done byfunded by grant 2006 - 10184 from the space telescope science center , which is administered by nasa , inc . , and the grant nas5 - 26555 . we thank professor verbunt for pointing out that all the x - ray sources with rotation periods greater than half an hour occur in open clusters . arons , a . & davies , j . j . 1993 , apj , 413 , l121 aurire , j . , & fvre , j . & terzan , j . 1984 , b & c , 138 , 415 bailyn , j . a . & grindlay , j . a . 1987 , apj , 316 , l25 bildsten , j . & deloye , j . j . 2004 , apj , 607 , l119 davies , j . a . 1975 , apj , 199 , l143 davies , j . j . , benz , j . & jones , j . a . 1992 , apj , 401 , 246 deutsch , j . a . , margon , j . , & jones , j . a . 2000 , , 530 , l21 dieball a . , knigge a . , zurek a . m . , sharaj . a . , hill j . a . , taylor s . a . , hannikainen j . a . , van zyl j . , 2005 , apj , 634 , l105 dillon , j . , gansicke , j . j . , augwerojwit , j . , rodriguez - gil , m . , smith , j . a . , barros , j . a . m . , szkody , m . , wilson , j . , krajci , m . & oksanen , m . 2008 , mnras , 386 , 1568 hill j . a . , pringle j . a . , rees j . a . , 1975 , mnras , 172 , 15p hill , j . a . 1996 , aj , 112 , 1487 hill j . a . , 1976 , mnras , 175p , 1 homer , l . , hill , j . s . , naylor , j . et al . 1996 , mnras , 282 , l37 , 1 . , taylor s . a . , margon j . , deutsch j . a . , hill j . a . , 2001 , apj , 550 , l155 hill , p .2003 , kitp conference : ` ` the physics of ultracompact solar winds ' ' ( may 1 - 3 , 2003 ) , authors : a . bildsten , s . chakrabarty , g . nelemans , http : / / www . itp . ucsb . edu / article / article _ c03 / . int zand c . j . a . , jonker p . g . , markwardt j . a . , 2007 , a & b , 465 , 953 ivanova , a . , rasio , f . a . , lombardi , g . a . , dooley , j . j . & proulx , j . a . 2005 , apj , 621 , l109 katz , m . a . 1975 , b , 253 , 698 nelemans , g . 2009 , arxiv : 0901 . 1778 nelemans g . , jonker p . g . , 2006 , astro , arxiv : astro - ph / 0605722 rasio , f . a . , pfahl , j . j . & rappaport j . 2000 , apj , 532 , l47 katz , m . ,priedhorsky , j . , & smith , d . a . 1987 , apj , 312 , l17 southworth , j . , gansicke , b . t . , marsh , t . r . , de martino , d . , hakala , p . , littlefair , j . , rodriguez - gil , m . & szkody , m . 2006 , mnras , 373 , 687 southworth , j . , marsh , t . r . , gansicke , b . t . , augwerojwit , a . , hakala , p . , de martino , d . & lehto , a . 2007 , mnras , 382 , 1145 southworth , j . , gansicke , b . t . , marsh , t . r . , torres , j . a . . m . , steeghs , m . , hakala , p . , copperwheat , j . a . , aungwerojwit , a . , & mukadam , m . 2008 , mnras , 391 , 591 verbunt , f . 1987 , apj , 312 , l23 verbunt f . , 2005 , multiple organ systems: origins , development , and applications , aip conference proceedings , aip conference proceedings , 797 , 2005 verbunt j . , lewin w . m . a . , 2006 , _ _ the _ y - chromosome _ _ , cambridge university press : cambridge , uk ( w . lewin , m . van der klis ##s . )
