in @ xcite the problem of how to provide an adequate formal description of these extra dimensions was solved , and the development of a formal language for their formal description was begun . in the course of this , the pioneering work of other authors , most notably lewis @ xcite and leinster @ xcite , contributed significantly to our understanding of these dimensions . the basic idea of @ xcite is that the definition of the @ xmath0 - dimensional data , @ xmath2 , should begin by starting with only the first @ xmath0 - dimensional data , that is , the sets and relations @ xmath3 ^ { t } \ ar @ < - 1ex > [ l ] _ { s } & { x _ 2 } \ ar @ < 1ex > [ l ] ^ { t } \ ar @ < - 1ex > [ l ] _ { s } & { x _ 3 } \ ar @ < 1ex > [ l ] ^ { t } \ ar @ < - 1ex > [ l ] _ { t } & { . . . } \ ar @ < 1ex > [ l ] ^ { t } \ ar @ < - 1ex > [ l ] _ { t} & { x _ t } \ ar @ < 1ex > [ l ] ^ { t } \ ar @ < - 1ex > [ l ] _ { t } } \ ] ] satisfy the conditions @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 , which define the the ##s ( elements of @ xmath6 ) , classes ( elements of @ xmath7 ) and other elements of the type in question . at this time standard structures have been defined , and when they exist , one has a standard set with these elements . in this case the problem of defining an anti - standard structure of a given type is that of defining the structures on the category @ xmath8 of @ xmath0 - the sets whose objects are these structures . as stated in the introduction to @ xcite , this method works because the structures themselves have certain structural properties , which allow their formal definition and formal ##ization . the @ xmath0 - operads of @ xcite can be defined from the point of view of categories : one defines the category @ xmath9 of @ xmath8 whose objects are the @ xmath0 - structures , and the @ xmat##h0 - operad consists of a module @ xmath1 and @ xmath8 , with a tensor product morphism @ xmath10 . the objects of this @ xmath0 - operad are exactly the objects of @ xmath1 . strict @ xmath0 - categories are categories enriched by binary operations : a strict @ xmath11 - category is a category enriched in the sense of strict @ xmath0 - categories via the tensor product , but not necessarily enriched for the specific use of homotopy theory and topology . for @ xmath12 the only category that can replace an arbitrary strict @ xmath13 - category with and not lose . ##ity is a gray category , which is a category enriched by @ xmath14 via the gray tensor product of r - modules instead of the tensor product @ xcite . this definition leads one to the question of how to define what the higher dimensional objects of the gray tensor product are , so as to set up a similar strict definition as for strict @ xmath0 - categories , and to define the following non - strict @ xmath0 - categories , which in the strict sense, would be the only way one could associate an arbitrary gray @ xmath0 - category with and not be # ##ity . we in @ xcite tried to prove this result in figure 1 , and one of our main goals is to find a way that could extend the notion of tensor product that i am trying to demonstrate here , but in a concrete way that we could try to extend to even higher dimensions . our papers ( [ id : gray ] ) and ( [ ex : gray ] ) show the progress that we have made in this area in this paper . in @ xcite the result of the previous paper is : to show that the _ tensor _ product _ of is which is what one gets by taking the gray tensor product of @ xmath15 - categories and doing what applies to n - categories is to construct an arbitrary gray monoidal category based on the set of objects of a given operad . from these results it appears that a full understanding of the higher dimensional nature of the gray tensor product is within reach . now , we have two collections of gray categories suitable for the theory and construction of higher dimensional gray @ xmath0 - operads and tensor products . in @ x##cite the definition of the relation between tensor products and @ xmath0 - operads already given , and @ xmath11 - operads whose objects have a structure at the same level are also associated with the lax tensor product of @ xmath8 . in this definition the objects of the @ xmath11 - operad coincide with graphs enriched in the corresponding lax tensor product . sections ( [ sec : eg - lmc ] ) - ( [ sec : 2 - functoriality ] ) of the previous article continue this development by providing , for the new category @ xmath16 , the assignment @ xmath17 where @ xmath18 is the category of graphs enriched in @ xmath16 , in a similar way . this development continues in sections ( [ sec : 2 - functoriality ] ) where the second definition is given by the second definition of the 2 - functor @ xmath19 where @ xmath20 is the derived 2 - category of the 2 - category of the monoidal category , and @ xmath21 is also defined by the category category of the @ xcite . from this definition , one is able to work out a more general andin ##ly , some of the main results of higher categories are in the same category . for example , in section ( [ ssec : definition ] ) we give a short and detailed mathematical description of the structures @ xmath9 for - @ xmath0 - , from which all their important properties are clearly known . in sections ( [ ssec : co - op - mult ] ) and ( [ ssec : definition ] ) we give longer and more detailed versions of some of the main results of @ xcite . in section ( [ ssec : monmonad - distlaw ] ) of the extended version of our 3 - functor @ xmath22 and the general ##ization of @ @ xcite , we give a complete mathematical explanation for how it is that this structure can arise in higher category structures : @ xcite @ xcite . in sections ( [ ssec : tci ] ) and ( [ ssec : tcii ] ) we use our results to explain some properties of @ xcite . the relation between @ xmath11 - operads and the new monoidal structure , @ xmath8 introduced by @ xcite , corresponds to the 3 - fun##d @ xmath23 for all categories , the lax tensor product is the category of 2 - dimensional objects . and the gray tensor product itself is the tensor product of 2 - categories . a lax monoidal structure on the category @ xmath16 starts with a ` ` ' ' ' tensor product , which rather than being flat as in the common case with non - lax tensor products , is in fact a point of @ xmath16 . for the gray tensor product induced by @ xmath23 , this is the case for 2 - categories . next , ( [ sec : lift - mult ] ) we consider the general ##ization of converting a gray monoidal structure , to a tensor product on the category of objects of the category induced by the second category . this result , called ( [ sec : lift - mult ] ) , is the main result of the proof , and is also the case in which these gray tensor products are used . in concrete terms this means that in order to construct a gray tensor product on the category of - the ##ity category , from our perspective , it is to construct an operad whose objects are also induced by that tensor product . in this case , one has tonote that the dual of tensor , and that of gray , do so similarly . by applying this result to the free tensor product of @ xmath8 and to the @ xmath11 - operads ( and @ xmath24 ) , one finds the category generated by @ xmath11 - operads in the category whose homs have an @ xmath0 - algebra structure . in this respect the lifting approach is very closely related to that of the other approaches to algebraic category theory , such as that of tamsamani @ xcite . in theorem ( [ ssec : a - infinity ] ) we give two versions of the lifting approach . in theorem ( [ cl : a - infinity - app ] ) we construct a tensor product of @ xmath25 - sets . as stated in @ xcite the problem of constructing such a tensor product is of interest to category theory , and it is partly because of the previous theorem @ xcite which showed that the ` ` lax ' ' tensor product does exist . but this result does not rule out the existence of the _ lax _ tensor product , which is what we are trying to prove in theorem ( [ cl : a - infinity - app ]) . it is possible to use the definition of joyal and street @ xcite , of strict monoidal structures and monoidal structures with matrix multiplication as an element of multiplication ( [ sec : 1 - 1 - app ] ) . another example is our previous result , by theorem ( [ cor : coh - bm2c ] ) , giving an identical definition to that of joyal and street , for strict monoidal 3 - structures . the weak @ xmath0 - structure is an example of a _ contractible _ @ xmath0 - operad . by theorem ( [ sec : contractibility ] ) we use this result , consider the whole category of contractible strict monoidal structures and define the precise relation between them . in this paper we work on a more abstract approach than in most of the previous papers on this subject . in particular , instead of studying structures on the category of @ xmath0 - derived categories , or structures on presheaf categories , we start with studying structures on the weak @ xmath18 of directed categories . as our paper shows , the basic results and tools of studying category theory in the same way can be found in this paper . .one could from the very beginning start not with @ xmath24 , the set of @ xmath26 - cells , but with the simple example @ xmath16 . for all the properties to work on , such as that of @ xmath9 , the relation between weak and strong # ##s , their associated properties , as well as the general definition of the @ xmath0 - cell , one is to take @ xmath16 to be a weak locally - finite category in the sense described just above ( [ ssec : lcpres ] ) . in this way one has also the category of @ xmath0 - cell structures generated by @ xmath16 . that is to say , the set of @ xmath0 - cells of any two @ xmath27 - cells of such a structure would be the set of @ xmath16 rather than a proper subset . some other properties of @ xmath16 which could also be of interest are : ( 1 ) the relation @ xmath28 = \ { [ < < \ } $ ] ( for the theory of locally - finite dimensional structures ) , ( 2 ) simplicial sets ( to which the relationof higher level categories which come equipped with a simplicial category ( the highest degree ) , ( 3 ) the category of structures on a locally compact manifold , or more generally the locally compact grothendieck manifold , ( 4 ) the category of the @ xmath0 - operad and ( 5 ) the category of multicategories ( complete or not ) . the fact is , the category which we have defined , is no _ more _ than this , and the properties given above follow from _ no _ more _ . given a topological space @ xmath2 and points @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 respectively , we shall define the topological space @ xmath31 of points of @ xmath2 from @ xmath29 to @ xmath30 with a higher degree of freedom . for all the following let us denote by @ xmath32 the category of ` ` points ' ' which are compact , cocomplete and locally closed . we shall use @ xmath33 for the origin point . we shall also show that @ xmath32 comes equipped with a bipointed point @ xmath34 in the role of the origin . .another example for @ xmath32 is the category of simply connected hausdorff spaces with a reduced suspension , although there are many other examples which would work just as well from the point of view of homotopy theory . let us denote by @ xmath35 the reduced suspension of @ xmath2 , which can be written as the pushout @ xmath36 { \ { \ sigma } \ } = " tr " [ l ] { \ @ { - } . } = " l " [ l ] { \ { + } \ } = " bl " " br " ( : " tr " : " tr " , : " bl " : " l " ) " br " [ d ( . 2 ) d ( . 3 ) ] ( : @ { - } [ d ( . 15 ) ] , : @ { - } [ d ( . 15 ) ] ) } \ ] ] . @ xmath37 for the category of bipointed sets , that is to say the coslice @ xmath38 , the above definition defines the reduced suspension of as a functor @ xmath39 in a sense this functor is the foundation of homotopy theory bringing it up to themultiplication of the whole space into the sphere , one of the projections of the @ xmath27 - disk into the @ xmath0 - disk for example @ xmath40 , and the left adjoint @ xmath41 , the functor which maps the bipointed point @ xmath42 , to the point @ xmath31 of x and @ xmath2 from @ xmath29 to @ xmath30 . this point @ xmath43 is easy to construct by using the most elementary construction of @ xmath44 as a pushout , and the unit vector @ xmath45 { x ^ i } = " tr " [ d ] { d ^ { - { + } } } } = " d " [ d ] { - } = " bl " " br " ( : " tr " : " tr " ^ { x ^ i } , : " bl " : " br " _ - { ( a , b ) } ) " r " [ l ( . 4 ) - ( . 5 ) ] ( : @ { - } [ l ( . 4 ) ] , : @ { - } [ r ( . 5 ) ]) } \ ] ] where @ xmath46 is the set of the elements of @ xmath34 . the category of objects @ xmath31 is our first example of an enriched category in the sense of [ def : a - graph ] let @ xmath16 be a graph . then @ xmath2 \ to @ xmath16 _ consists of an ordered set @ xmath6 whose elements are the _ object _ , together with an object @ xmath31 of @ xmath16 for each ordered set @ xmath47 of elements of @ xmath2 . the object @ xmath31 may also be called the _ hom _ from @ xmath29 to @ xmath30 . the morphism @ xmath48 of @ xmath16 - - graphs consists of a graph @ xmath49 together with a morphism @ xmath50 for each @ xmath47 . the category of @ xmath16 - graphs and their morphisms is denoted by @ xmath18 , and we denote by @ xmath51 the same 2 - functor @ xmath52 with object _ as above . the 2 - fun##ctor @ xmath51 is the extension of the set category in the same way extending it up to the inclusion of the empty set into the category ( or the corresponding object ) , this is the inclusion of the object of @ xmath27 - empty sets into the category of @ xmath0 - empty sets . in the category @ xmath53 this is the inclusion with object of @ xmath54 { . . . } = " r " [ r ] { x _ { n { - } 1 } } = " l " " l " : @ < 1ex > " m " : @ < 1ex > " l " " m " : @ < - 1ex > " l " : @ < - 1ex > " l " } } & \ mapsto & { \ xygraph { { x _ 1 } = " r " [ r ] { . . . } = " r " [ r ] { x _ { n { - } 1 } } = " r " [ r ] { \ emptyset } = " rr " " rr " : @ < 1ex > " r " : @ < 1ex > " r " : @ < 1ex > "[ " " rr " : @ < - 1ex > " r " : @ < - 1ex > " l " : @ < - 1ex > " l " } } \ begin { 1 } \ ] ] and when @ xmath55 this is the functor @ xmath56 which leaves over the empty set . so there is only one @ xmath57 - derived object which cannot be identified with the empty set . it is therefore natural to think of @ xmath51 as left over from @ xmath58 . then applying the endofunctor @ xmath51 to the identity functor @ xmath59 for instance @ xmath16 , is the identity functor @ xmath60 which assigns the empty value to the empty set of objects . this category @ xmath61 has a left adjoint which we shall define in @ xmath62 for reasons that are yet to be clear . the functor @ xmath62 is a variant of the grothendieck category . to this single functor @ xmath63 one assigns the category @ xmath64 with two objects @ xmath65 where @ xmat##h29 is an element of @ xmath1 , and @ xmath66 is an empty set of elements of @ xmath67 . these are the maps of @ xmath1 which take these initial points in the usual way . it is useful to look at the object and counit of this sub - category . given a category @ xmath16 , @ xmath68 is the set of bipointed enriched objects of @ xmath16 . the counit @ xmath69 sends @ xmath42 to the hom @ xmath31 . when @ xmath16 has an initial point @ xmath70 has a left adjoint given by @ xmath71 . given a functor @ xmath63 the object @ xmath72 sends @ xmath73 to the enriched graph whose vertices are elements of @ xmath67 , and the hom @ xmath74 is given by the bipointed object @ xmath65 . consider the case where @ xmath75 and @ xmath76 are the objects @ xmath77 . then @ xmath64can be seen as the category of endo - cospans of the set @ xmath26 , that is to say the category of sets @ xmath78 and a map of @ xmath73 is also called a map @ xmath79 . when @ xmath1 is not cocomplete we can take the left adjoint to @ xmath80 . to see this means that every set @ xmath2 contained in @ xmath64 gives rise to a functor @ xmath81 where @ xmath6 is the set of elements of @ xmath2 . for each object @ xmath82 , @ xmath83 is defined as the identity object . it has two kinds of objects : each element is either an element of @ xmath82 , or an ordered pair of elements of @ xmath82 . there are two kinds of non - empty objects @ xmath84 where @ xmath66 is an ordered pair from @ xmath82 , and @ xmath83 is ordered from the set as well . a more precise way to define this category is as the set of elements of the set@ xmath85 { = } = " - " " r " : @ < 1ex > " - " " - " : @ < - 1ex > " - " } \ ] ] where the source and destination sets are the induced sets , and a presheaf is the set @ xmath86 { = } [ - ( 0 . 1 ) ] { \ xybox { \ xygraph { } [ } ] } " l " : @ < 1ex > " l " : @ < 1ex > @ { < - } " - " } } } * \ frm { - } } \ ] ] and so it is a free fibration @ xmath87 . the functor @ xmath88 maps it to @ xmath75 , and the map @ xmath66 to the elements of the hom @ xmath89 . the identity element of @ xmath88 is the bipointings of the homs . we can then easily also have @ xmath75 , @ xmath77 and @ xmath1 are cocomplete . then @ xmath90 is left adjoint ##ed . image of @xmath91 . in the work so far we have worked on finding an equivalence between the reduced graphs of a category and the graphs of in that category . now we shall label these two together . as we have shown , to the graph @ xmath2 we can associate a complete , reduced graph whose homs are the identity elements of @ xmath2 . labeling this reduced graph as @ xmath92 , the graph @ xmath93 is the empty set of the left - adjoint sets @ xmath94 { \ ca g ( \ top _ { \ top } ) } = " l " [ 1 ] { \ ca g \ } } = " l " " l " : @ < - 1 . 5ex > " b " _ - { \ top } | { } = " b1 " : @ < - 1 . 5ex > " b " | { } = " t1 " " t1 " : @ { } " b1 " | { \ perp } " b " : @ < - 1 . 5ex > " b " _ - { \ ca gh } | { } = " b2 " : @ < - 1 . 5ex > " b" _ - { \ { } \ } } | { } = " t2 " " t2 " : @ { } " b2 " | { \ perp } } . \ ] ] as proved by cheng @ xcite , this functor @ xmath95 is a key part of the trimble construction of the @ xmath0 - graph . the many properties of @ xmath51 are important because of the close relationship between @ xmath51 and the @ xmath96 category . a very simple reformulation of the notion of @ xmath16 - graph is the following : the @ xmath16 - graph @ xmath2 consists of a graph @ xmath6 together with an @ xmath97 - graph consisting of maps of @ xmath16 . together with the simple reformulation of the notion of @ xmath18 , this means that we have the category : @ xmath98 _ { ( - ) _ r = \ { gt _ r } \ save \ ar ? ( . 3 ) = " lpb " \ ca \ bar [ - ] ^ - { } \ bar \ ar ? ( . 4 ) = " lp##pb " \ } & { \ fam { - } } \ ar [ d ] ^ { \ fam ( d _ 1 ) } \ } \ } ?

( . 3 ) = " bpb " \ } & { \ } } \ } " rpb " ; " lpb " * * @ { } ; ? ! { " bpb " ; " tpb " } = " cpb " * * @ { } ; ? * * @ { - } ; " tpb " ; " cpb " * * @ { } ; ? * * @ { - } } } \ ] ] in @ xmath99 , and as a unique 2 - object in @ xmath100 . from @ xcite . ( 1 . 1 ) we have [ example : gfam2fun ] @ xmath51 is a unique 2 - functor . in fact it follows from the definition of @ xcite that @ xmath51 has no upper bound as long as thethe objects of ` ` grothendieck fibration ' ' which we can use correspond to a freely generated 2 - category . all the linear operators for these objects are left adjoints . see @ xcite for more details on this aspect of 2 - category theory . we shall not use these notions too much in what follows . also useful for us is [ 1 : 1 - 1 - 1 ] @ xmath51 for eilenberg - type categories . from a cell @ xmath101 to the cell @ xmath16 , we shall define @ xmath102 for the category of @ xmath101 - algebra and morphisms # , and @ xmath103 for the identity functor . we shall replace the typical object of @ xmath102 by a cell @ xmath104 , where @ xmath2 is the typical object of @ xmath16 and @ xmath105 is the @ xmath101 - algebra ##s . from @ xcite the g - cell @ xmath106 , whose intersection with @ xmath104 and @ xmath107 itself is the unique intersection .@ xmath102 is a kind of one - dimensional extension of the _ eilenberg - type _ _ . see @ xcite and @ xcite for more details on this particular extension . the following result that for any object @ xmath101 in any category @ xmath16 , the natural structure @ xmath108 of an object breaks down to the following result that for any @ xmath16 - category @ xmath109 , a @ xmath110 - algebra structure on @ xmath109 is the same thing as a @ xmath101 - algebra structure for the homs of @ xmath109 , and also for the morphisms . let us consider the notion of strict monoidal category and category defined above from @ xcite . for any category @ xmath16 , the associated strict monoidal category @ xmath111 on @ xmath16 has a very simple definition . an object of @ xmath111 is a finite sequence @ xmath112 of objects of @ xmath16 . a sequence is a sequence of objects of @ xmath16 there are no maps between sequences of objects offor example . the module @ xmath113 of the 2 - module @ xmath114 is the set of modules of length @ xmath33 . the addition @ xmath115 is done by addition . a _ the monoidal a _ is the derived category for the 2 - module @ xmath114 . thus it consists of an derived category @ xmath16 , a functor @ xmath116 , and modules @ xmath117 for length @ xmath82 , @ xmath118 from @ xmath16 which are similar in their structure , and such that @ xmath119 ^ - { u \ ope \ limits _ i } \ ar [ d ] _ { d } \ alpha \ alpha ?

. the empty set is @ xmath154 , @ xmath155 for @ xmath156 , and all the other homs are equal to @ xmath151 . now we define @ xmath157 and the successor is @ xmath158 . for @ xmath159 we have two objects . given objects @ xmath160 of @ xmath16 where @ xmath156 , and @ xmath161 and by @ xmath162 the first is identity , @ xmath18 : the identity that is , and @ xmath163 , and the hom maps are identity . now given objects @ xmath118 of @ xmath16 where @ xmath164 and @ xmath132 , one defines the function @ xmath165 : by and by @ xmath166 and @ xmath167 for @ xmath164 , and the hom maps by @ xmath168 and @ xmath46 for @ xmath169 . with these objects in mind we can also define the successor of @ x##math159 . @ xmath170 ^ - { \ { { \ text { \ } } \ } _ { 0 , 1 } } & & { [ ( z _ { k } , . . . , z _ { kn _ k } ) ( 0 , n _ { \ bullet } ) } \ , [ rr ] ^ - { \ int _ { 0 , n _ { \ bullet } } } & & { \ tbar \ int _ { ij } n _ { ij } } } . \ ] ] from here until the end of ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we shall be satisfied with the proof of [ id : tbar ] . @ xmath16 define a string with an index . @ xmath151 and @ xmath147 define a module over @ xmath24 and @ xmath18 . let @ xmath152 be replaced by ( [ id : tbar ] ) - ( [ id : mubar ] ) define a multitensor over @ xmath16 . in theory we could get a proof of this theorem simply by simply going through a simple list of the variables . then we shalltake a more abstract approach , and along the way consider other objects that are of finite type . for all of the above we will require a lot more of @ xmath16 : that object has no coproducts , to support our more abstract approach . in the end however , we will show that only the first condition is necessary . we break down the construction of @ xmath152 into two steps . so in ( [ ssec : nmonad - > monmonad ] ) , we show how @ xmath171 generates a monoidal structure and @ xmath147 generates a monoidal structure @ xmath172 on @ xmath171 . then we show that this monoidal structure generates a new monoidal structure on @ xmath171 , which in turn can be extended to the category to generate @ xmath152 . these last two steps are very useful : they are at the level of the category of lie groups for an arbitrary 1 - form ( which in our case is @ xmath114 ) . so in ( [ ssec : laxalg - const1 ] ) and ( [ ssec : laxalg -const2 ] ) we consider these two objects , and in ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we begin the proof of in ( [ c : tbar ] ) . then in ( [ ssec : c - graph ] ) we impose a condition on @ xmath101 which ensures that @ xmath101 - graphs and @ xmath173 - graphs can be represented . from then until and before the proof of ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we shall assume that @ xmath16 has no coproducts . we shall consider the consequences of this . first , the functor @ xmath174 which maps an arbitrary object to a set of objects is defined . we shall denote by @ xmath26 the @ xmath16 - graph which contains @ xmath175 . it contains this object and its associated hom , @ xmath151 . the second consequence is that @ xmath171 is a unique monoidal category and the corresponding category @ xmath147 and @ xmath18 can therefore be represented as a monoidal category @ xmath172 . the proof for this starts with the followingthat the representability of the object set functor @ xmath175 is a natural reformulation of the category @ xmath171 into the category of endocospans of @ xmath26 , see below ( [ ssec : k - 1 ] ) . the consequence of this is that the cospans can be generated , by replacing @ xmath171 with a complete monoidal category . the intersection of @ xmath151 and @ xmath16 allows one to compute coproducts under @ xmath18 . the coproduct @ xmath2 of the category @ xmath176 of @ xmath16 - sets the object set 1 as the inner union of the object sets of the @ xmath177 , @ xmath178 when @ xmath107 and @ xmath179 are elements of @ xmath177 , and all the object homs of @ xmath151 . with these coproducts , one can also compute pushouts under @ xmath26 , that is the pushout @ xmath180 of the @ xmath181 ^ - {\ } \ { [ x ] _ - { x } & \ } \ ] ] . @ xmath18 ##0 defined as follows . the object set of @ xmath180 is the smallest union of the object sets of @ xmath2 and @ xmath182 modulo the union of @ xmath107 and @ xmath179 , and let us write @ xmath183 for this single element of @ xmath180 . the homs of @ xmath180 are formed from @ xmath2 and @ xmath182 in much the same way as for coproducts . that is if @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 are not both objects of @ xmath2 but both elements of @ xmath182 and they are not in @ xmath183 , then their hom @ xmath184 is made up by @ xmath2 and @ xmath182 . the hom @ xmath185 is the coproduct @ xmath186 . and this hom is @ xmath151 . note that in the special case where thehoms @ xmath187 and @ xmath188 are linked @ xmath151 , one only needs the corresponding object map @ xmath16 to create this pushout . given a list @ xmath189 of non - linked @ xmath16 - sequences , one defines their _ _ _ @ xmath190 where @ xmath191 is the colimit of @ xmath192 _ - { a _ n } \ ar [ r ] ^ - { a _ n } & { . . . } & { \ ar [ r ] _ - { a _ { r - 1 } } \ ar [ r ] ^ - { a _ n } & { a _ n } } \ ] ] . @ xmath18 which can be created via the pushouts of @ xmath26 . this is a monoidal map over @ xmath171 whose inner product we denote by @ xmath193 . given a functor @ xmath194 and @ xmath24 , one defines a functor @ xmath195 whose object map is shown on the right in the previous section . when using @ xmath16and @ xmath196 using the initial object , one has for each pair of well - ordered @ xmath16 - cells a map @ xmath197 as well . and @ xmath198 for the case of the colimit cocones ( [ 2 : 3 ] ) . for the initial object @ xmath199 , there is a unique map @ xmath200 and that @ xmath201 . using the # ##ness of these maps , they work together to create the unique n - map @ xmath202 ^ - { * } \ ar [ d ] _ { t _ { \ bullet } } \ save \ restore ? = " dom " \ restore & { \ ca gv _ { \ bullet } } \ ar [ d ] ^ { t _ { \ bullet } } \ save \ restore ? = " dom " \ restore \ \ { { \ ca gw _ { \ bullet } } \ ar [ d ] _ -

[ note :dist ] @ xmath296 is a bicategory and the extension of @ xmath296 is also a horizontal multitensor . that is to define the extension and define the # ##s . the definition we have used here for the coproduct exactly matches that used in proposition ( 3 ) of @ xcite . the proof of the second part of proposition ( 3 . 2 ) of @ xcite interpretted in our slightly more abstract form , is the proof that @ xmath296 is a bicategory . the definition of horizontal multitensors as defined in @ xmath296 is derived from the proof and our original definition of kan extensions in terms of kan extensions . what in @ xcite is here @ xmath315 is called the hom @ xmath316 . because of the extension @ xmath299 and the inclusion of the comonad @ xmath298 , a natural number on @ xmath18 is the same thing as a number on @ xmath16 in the kleisli k - form @ xmath297of the ( non - ) comonad @ xmath298 . the reason this is so important is that it shows how our maps over @ xmath24 always contain objects at the level of homs . the importance of this reformulation is most easily shown by showing that the definition of @ xmath51 , the identity on the 1 - functor given by the 2 - fully - faithful 2 - functor , can be written as @ xmath317 ^ - { j } & { \ kl { \ , i _ { \ i } } } \ , [ i ] ^ - { j } & { \ set / \ i } } \ ] ] where @ xmath318 is the left adjoint image of the kleisli map for @ xmath298 . then , @ xmath210 maps a point in @ xmath297 over @ xmath16 to a point in @ xmath18 over @ xmath24 , and the existence of @ xmath51 and the 2 - fully - faithful of @ xmath210 show that one special point arises naturally in this case . this is the point on the. . the function @ xmath304 , @ xmath301 is defined by the left kan extension @ xmath319 ^ - { * } \ ar [ r ] _ { { \ varepsilon } \ save \ } ? = " dom " \ , & { \ gamma } _ { \ gamma } \ } \ ar [ r ] ^ { \ gamma { e } } \ } \ } ? = " dom " \ , \ \ { * } \ ar [ d ] _ - { * } & { * } \ , " dom " ; " cod " * * @ { } ?

[ kan : spancomp - lra ] let @ xmath1 be a slice with finite products and let @ xmath29 be an extension of @ xmath1 such that @ xmath326 also has finite products . then the one - cell part @ xmath327 of the monoidal extension of @ xmath328 defined by this definition has a local right adjoint . note that for each @ xmath40 the sets @ xmath329 , where @ xmath330 is the @ xmath0 - th direct sum of @ xmath29 , have finite products , so the statement of the definition makes all and all the conditions we use in this definition apply . in particular a functor consisting of a coproduct of sets with a local rightadjoint iff the composition with the coproduct of is a local right adjoint . thus it helps to verify that @ xmath0 - the composition of spans @ xmath331 is a local right adjoint for span @ xmath40 . the case @ xmath332 may be exhibited as the composition @ xmath333 ^ - { r _ ! } & { a / b } \ - [ r ] ^ - { \ ar _ ! } & { r / - { \ ar } \ } } \ ] ] of local right adjoints and this is a local right adjoint . the case @ xmath273 may be exhibited as the composition . this helps to verify the case @ xmath334 because with this in mind , the proof will show the general case . the composite composition of spans is shown on the table @ xmath335 = ( [ dr ] { a } = " a1 " , [ dr ] { a } = " a2 " ) , [ dr ] ( [ dr ] { a } = " a3 " ) " a " : " a2 " _ { a } : " a1 " _{ - } " a " : " a2 " ^ { y } : " a3 " ^ { y } " b " : " a2 " ^ { z } " c " : " a2 " _ { - } " a " [ d ( . 1 ) l ( . 1 ) ] [ d ( . 2 ) l ( . 1 ) ] : @ { - } [ d ( . 2 ) l ( . 1 ) ] : @ { - } [ d ( . 1 ) l ( . 1 ) ] } } [ d ( 1 ) ] * \ xybox { \ xygraph { ! { } ; ( 0 . 0 , 1 ) : ( 1 , . 0 ) : : } } [ d ] { \ { \ } } } } = " a2 " [ d ] { a ^ 2 } = " a4 " [ d ] { a ^ 1 } = " a3 " [ d ] { a ^ 2 } = " a2 " " a2 " ( : @ { . > } " a3 " _ { ( wp , xp = yq , zq ) } ( : @ { . > } " a2 " _ { ( \ pi _ 1 , \ pi _ 2 ) } , : "a4 " _ - { a { \ times } \ delta { \ times } a } ) , : " b " ^ - { ( p , q ) } : " a4 " ^ { ( y , x ) { \ times } ( y , z ) } " d " [ r ( . 1 ) ] [ r ( . 1 ) ] : @ { - } [ r ( . 2 ) ] : @ { - } [ r ( . 3 ) ] } } } \ ] ] can be found using the # # ##s on the left of the main section , and the binary structure of endospans of @ xmath29 ##6 given by the binary functor @ xmath336 ^ - { \ textnormal { a } _ { ( a ^ 1 , a ^ 2 ) } } & { a / ( a ^ 2 ) } \ ar [ r ] ^ - { ( a { \ times } \ delta { \ times } a ) ^ * } & { a / ( a ^ 4 ) } \ ar [ r ] ^ - { ( \ pi _ 1 , \ pi _ 2 ) _ ! } & { a / ( { \ times } { } } \ ] ] where @ x##math337 is the ( right adjoint ) functor @ xmath338 which maps a category to its local product ( and @ xmath339 to the product of @ xmath337 in the category @ xmath340 ) . the dual functors of this dual category are also called local right adjoints . note @ xcite @ xcite that local right adjoints can be defined in terms of local products . the basic definition is as follows . a functor @ xmath323 is a local right adjoint iff for all @ xmath341 the objects of the dual category @ xmath342 are the points . a category @ xmath343 which is equivalent to the product of @ xmath342 is said to be _ cogeneric _ , and by definition , @ xmath76 can be written as @ xmath344 ^ - { fh } & { fc } \ [ [ \ ] ^ - { f } & { } \ ] ] where @ xmath345 is cogeneric . this map is linear up to an element and is called the_ cogeneric factor _ of @ xmath76 . [ c : lla - ple ] let @ xmath323 be the chosen left adjoint . suppose that @ xmath1 is a set @ xmath346 of its components , each of which is an initial object , and that @ xmath109 is locally compact . for the functor @ xmath347 where @ xmath348 are coproducts , the left kan extension @ xmath349 of @ xmath23 and @ xmath292 is and is defined by the formula @ xmath350 where @ xmath351 is the initial object of the set @ xmath352 , and @ xmath353 ^ - { fh _ f } & { fa _ f } \ , [ [ ] ^ - { fa _ f } & { } \ ] ] denotes the _ cogeneric factor of @ xmath354 . by the usual convention for treating left kan extensions as colimits , it follows to identify the empty set with the colimit of @ xmath355 ^ - { f } & {\ ar [ r ] ^ - { { } & { } \ ] ] where @ xmath356 is the canonical sequence . this is since the components of @ xmath342 are connected by length @ xmath357 , where @ xmath352 and @ xmath354 , and the component of @ xmath342 corresponding to @ xmath357 the sequence is identified by @ xmath358 , which is connected by @ xmath356 to @ xmath359 . in the case of @ xmath193 , the initial values of the components of @ xmath360 are of the sequence @ xmath361 and the sequence @ xmath362 is the sequence @ xmath363 which corresponds to a sequence of components of @ xmath2 of length @ xmath145 starting at @ xmath29 and ending at @ xmath30 . the reader can then see that @ xmath364 & { r ^ * { } \ ar [ r ] ^ - { \ overline { x } } & { y } } \ ] ] is the cogeneric projection of the sequence .to @ xmath250 . then we are given a detailed description of @ xmath365 and @ xmath276 which are contained in ( [ ssec : tree - structure ] ) , as well as in the definition of [ cor : explicit - gamma ] for @ xmath16 and @ xmath196 with coproducts and @ xmath304 , the exact sequence kan ##a of @ xmath301 , and we have the composite @ xmath366 we shall identify @ xmath22 with the composite @ xmath367 , which corresponds to identifying @ xmath368 with the composite @ xmath369 and the composite @ xmath299 . then for @ xmath127 and @ xmath261 , we have for each @ xmath40 and for each composite @ xmath250 such that @ xmath251 and @ xmath252 have coproduct and @ xmath370 with in ( [ cor : explicit - gamma ] ) . the coefficients of the sequence of numbers for @ xmath22 will be : for x . fromthe definition of the unit @ xmath371 for @ xmath296 , one has that for @ xmath261 the coproduct of @ xmath372 is an inclusion . thus we have the unit @ xmath373 . the units @ xmath374 and @ xmath304 , @ xmath375 and @ xmath261 , we have the hom definition of @ xmath376 for @ xmath377 , with the first condition being that for each @ xmath378 where @ xmath164 and @ xmath132 , @ xmath379 and @ xmath380 , the unit @ xmath381 { ( \ opeof \ limits _ { ij } ) , ( x _ { ij - 1 } , y _ { ij } ) } = " d " [ r ] [ x ( . r ) ] { \ gamma ( \ { \ gamma } f ) x ( a , b ) } = " d " , [ r ] { \ ope \ limits _ { \ gamma ( r ) } ( ._ { x - 1 } , ( _ 1 ) } = " d " [ ( ] { \ gamma ( e ) \ gamma ( f ) , ( a , b ) } = " d " ) " a " : " a " ^ - { \ ope \ limits _ 1 \ opc \ limits _ j } : " b " ^ - { a _ { x _ { x \ i } } } : " a " ^ - { \ limits _ j } " b " : " c " _ - { \ opc \ x _ { ij } } : " c " _ - { c _ { x _ { ij } } } } \ ] ] for @ xmath196 } , where @ xmath382 and @ xmath383 for @ xmath384 . we have changed the syntax so as to keep pace with the definition of @ xcite ##r ( 2 ) , and the definition of the first part of section ( 1 . 1 ) of _ loc . _ interpretted in the following form : [ _ : _ - psfunctor ] the functions @ xmath385 are divided in @ xmath22 into [ _ -functor . given a set @ xmath101 over @ xmath18 over @ xmath24 , and a set @ xmath82 , one starts by taking the set @ xmath386 and the set @ xmath387 of @ xmath16 - 2 with an associated set @ xmath82 . let us substitute @ xmath388 for the functor given by @ xmath22 over @ xcite . then for a fully enriched multitensor @ xmath122 , our sets @ xmath22 and @ xmath388 are given by the set @ xmath389 where the @ xmath33 on the right hand side of this table is the lattice . in other words we have already obtained the ` ` two - worlds theorem ' ' of the theory given in @ xcite , ( 2 ) . having already obtained the means to extend the multitensors on @ xmath16 to those on @ xmath18 over @ xmath24 , we shall now extend the whole theory to the lattice . this means two things : suppose that the two worldsstarting from the multitensors , path - like , and introducing the connection between @ xmath22 and the definition of paths ( [ sec : gamma - > mult ] ) of multitensors from it .

[ pi0 ] the most obvious example of this occurs when @ xmath16 is a grothendieck category . the objects @ xmath16 satisfying the following form of definition ( [ prop : lext - transform - charn ] ) are said to be _ locally connected _ . this definition is useful since for a connected category @ xmath2 , one says that @ xmath2 is locally connected to a category iff the entire set of objects is locally connected in this sense . the category @ xmath450 of elements of @ xmat##h16 has a _ strong generator _ when for all maps @ xmath48 , if @ xmath451 is bijective for maps @ xmath452 then @ xmath76 is an example . a _ strong generator @ xmath16 is _ accessible @ xmath392 - accessible _ when it is cocomplete and has a strong generator _ of all maps . # note that a functor is _ accessible _ when it preserves @ xmath392 - valued colimits for a given cardinal @ xmath392 . the notion of locally present categories is one of the starting points of modern category theory , and this notion has many different definitions @ xcite @ xcite @ xcite . for instance , present categories are precisely those categories which preserve the @ xmath24 - valued definition for a limit cone . grothendieck categories are locally present because a limit cone of a grothendieck cone for a cardinal @ xmath453 gives rise to a cone in @ xmath454 , and a function is called a functor @ xmath455 which maps these cones to the cones in @ x##math24 . that is to say , grothendieck categories can be defined as the product of a set , which one derives in an equivalent way from the set which contains it . just as locally small categories are grothendieck categories , the above result holds for all grothendieck categories . [ def : lcc ] a locally small category @ xmath16 has _ _ _ - _ _ when it is cocomplete and has a finite core set of locally connected objects . just as locally small categories have no strong core we have the above result for locally c - connected categories . the result is given by using the # ##ization of @ xcite in the form of the statement for @ xmath392 - locally connected objects , which is ` ` ' ' ' ( ' @ xcite ) , and then ( [ def : lext - c - charn ] ) .

[ c : n - 1 ] if @ xmath16 is locally c - filtered and @ xmath101 is an open coproduct - structure of @ xmath16 , then @ xmath102 is locally c - filtered . then we show that colimits in @ xmath102 can be generated by the colimits of @ xmath16 and the slices of @ xmath101 ( see for example @ xcite for a proof of this ) . by definition we have a category ##izer @ xmath392 such that @ xmath101 has @ xmath392 - derived colimits and @ xmath16 is also @ xmath392 - derived . define @ xmath457 to be the smallest subcategory of @ xmath16 consisting of the @ xmath392 - derived and normal categories , @ xmath458is a function with identity in the sense of @ xcite . it has the general form @ xmath459 ^ - { i ^ t ( 0 , 1 ) } \ ar [ r ] _ { j } \ save \ , ? = " c " \ , & { \ psh { \ theta } _ 0 } \ ar [ r ] ^ { \ theta _ j } \ , \ , ? = " c " \ , \ \ , \ ar [ r ] _ - { t ( i _ 0 , 1 ) } & { \ psh { \ theta } _ 0 } \ { " d " ; " c " * * @ { } ; ? * { \ iso } } \ ] ] in the sense of @ xcite . thus @ xmath460 is orthogonal since @ xmath461 has colimits , and @ xmath101 and @ xmath462 are orthogonal . by the last definition of @ xcite @ xmath460 is not fully accessible , but has been fully adjoint since @ xmath102 is cocomplete , and by setting @ xmath46 ##0 the yoneda line , andso we have defined @ xmath102 as equivalent to ( ( [ ex : lc - gabulm ] ) ( [ lc4 ] ) .

[ def : 2cat - distmult ] the 2 - category @ xmath20 of all multitensors , is defined to be the smallest non - non - category of @ xmath234 and of the @ xmath634 such that @ xmath16 has coproducts and @ xmath122 is singleton . for the 2 - category @ xmath222 is the 2 - category @ xmath643 from @ xcite of sets in @ xmath222 . another way to define this non - category is that it is the 2 - category of all sets of the same type in @ xmath222 . thus the 2 - category @ xmath644 has two objects : @ xmath645 where @ xmath16 is a pair and @ xmath101 is a pair on @ xmath16 . the object @ xmath646 is a pairconsists of a functor @ xmath636 and a natural transformation @ xmath647 satisfying the following two conditions : these are essentially the ` ` and ' ' part of the definition for a lax monoidal functor @ as above . for example , a lax monoidal functor @ xmath648 as above determines a natural functor @ xmath649 . a natural transformation of natural functors @ xmath650 consists of a natural transformation @ xmath641 satisfying the following conditions . for example a monoidal natural transformation @ xmath522 as above determines a module of @ xmath651 . in fact if we are interested in modules of @ xmath24 , we shall start not with @ xmath644 but rather with @ xmath652 . an example @ xmath645 of this natural sub - category is a module @ xmath16 , with a functor into @ xmath24 , and with a module @ xmath101 into @ xmath16 which ` ` is point - wise ' ' with respect to this functor . that is @ xmath101the unit map does not change the underlying dual ##s , except for the dual diagram of @ xmath101 , and the dual of @ xmath101 . dual and dual are defined on objects in the usual way . each element @ xmath646 of @ xmath652 is a component @ xmath648 , in the case of @ xmath644 , with the additional condition that @ xmath653 whose elements are the identity on objects , and of the s - components of @ xmath652 , with an additional identity - on - objects condition . we shall also define the s - functor @ xmath19 which on objects is defined by @ xmath654 . let @ xmath655 be a lax monoidal functor on the dual monoidal category . then for @ xmath127 and @ xmath261 , we define the hom of @ xmath656 to be the complement of @ xmath657 { \ coprod \ sum _ { i = x _ i , . . . , x _ i = 0 } , \ ope \ sum _ i ( x _ { i - x} , ( _ i ) } = " i " " l " : @ < 1ex > " l " ^ - { \ coprod \ { } } \ ] ] and @ xmath658 \ coproduct = # ##s . it follows easily from the definitions that @ xmath659 as defined above is the definition of the identity functor . similarly for a monoidal linear map @ xmath660 , it also follows easily from the definitions that @ xmath661 is a complete object . it is then straight - forward to show that these transformations are non - functorial . by definition ( [ prop : pl - adjoint - objects ] ) and definition ( [ cor : pl - > copr - pres ] ) we know properties of the image of @ xmath22 and we present this information in [ prop : pl - dual - objects ] for @ xmath16 a set with coproducts , the sets @ xmath662 and @ xmath24 are in the image of @ xmath22 iff @ xmath101 is complete and set - preserving . similarly , for @xmath101 also generates coproducts . it generates the natural multitensor @ xmath122 such that @ xmath663 = @ xmath664 . since the map @ xmath405 is itself a non - functorial , the cells and sub - cells of the image of @ xmath22 can not be easily obtained . [ gamma : 1 - gamma - 1 - gamma - 1 ] 1 . let @ xmath634 and @ xmath635 be strict and monoidal categories . a linear functor of the form @ xmath665 is in the image of @ xmath22 iff @ xmath666 for example @ xmath667 . [ gamma - char1 ] 2 . and @ xmath668 are the monoidal functors and map to monoidal categories . a linear map @ xmath669 is in the image of @ xmath22 iff and is of the form @ xmath670 . [ gamma - char2 ] are the linear functors and maps to the image of @ xmath22 .the above holds , and we can do the same . for @ xmath671 such that the cells of @ xmath653 are the same for x , one defines for @ xmath672 from @ xmath16 , the following natural monoidal functor : defined as the hom map from @ xmath26 to @ xmath0 of the category @ xmath673 . that is to say , we apply @ xmath405 to the appropriate tensor functors to obtain ( [ gamma - char1 ] ) , and we apply the map to the appropriate tensor components to obtain ( [ gamma - char2 ] ) . [ def : plmnd ] we define for @ xmath674 the following 1 - cells . its cells are arrows @ xmath675 of @ xmath24 such that @ xmath16 is coproducts and @ xmath101 is independent and set - independent . its cells are arrows @ xmath676 of @ xmath652 , and its 2 - cells are 2 - cells @ xmath677 of @ xmath##652 . starting from the definition of above ( [ 1 : 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 ] ) we have [ cor : 2eq - mult - 1 ] @ xmath22 and @ xmath405 for a 2 - category @ xmath678 . the categories of the 2 - category split themselves into _ _ _ _ 2 - categories depending on whether one has lax or oplax free morphisms . so in particular one has the 2 - category @ xmath679 of lax monoidal categories , _ _ op _ _ 2 - monoidal functors between them and monoidal natural transformations between those . the definition @ xmath653 for an oplax @ xmath655 goes in the opposite direction , and so the properties look like this : @ xmath680 the user should also be able to write down exactly the two main conditions that this category must satisfy , as well as the conditions that must be satisfied by the monoidal natural transformation between oplax monoidal functors . also there is a special case @ xmath681 of the 2 - category @ xmath643 of .consider the natural n - category @ xmath222 contained in @ xcite . an arrow @ xmath646 of @ xmath682 consists of a functor @ xmath636 and a natural transformation @ xmath683 satisfying the two above conditions . an arrow of @ xmath682 is also a natural opfunctor . as such @ xmath684 differs from @ xmath652 in that all the operations involved start with a functor into @ xmath24 , and all the functors and natural transformations involved are started with these natural functors . we then consider the first example of the n - functoriality of @ xmath22 ##2 in sections ( [ ssec : gamma - 0 - functor ] ) and ( [ ssec : gamma - 1 ] ) . when considering the n - category structure of @ xmath22 in sections ( [ ssec : gamma - 1 - functor ] ) we are surprised by the fact that the coproduct construction algorithm works the same way : using the definition of the natural functor @ xmath685 ##2 . this time , we do not do thethen , and for this , we can restrict ourselves by the above definition to coproduct and oplax monoidal functors . [ def : opdistmult ] the 2 - cell @ xmath686 is defined to be the left full rank - 2 - category of @ xmath679 , of the left full monoidal category , and the oplax monoidal functors @ xmath648 such that @ xmath658 preserves coproducts . we denote by @ xmath687 the rank 2 - category . its arrows are arrows @ xmath675 of @ xmath24 such that @ xmath16 preserves coproducts and @ xmath101 is free and non - independent . its arrows are arrows @ xmath676 of @ xmath684 such that @ xmath658 preserves coproducts . its 2 - cells are 2 - cells @ xmath677 of @ xmath684 . we can replace @ xmath688 with arrows of @ xmath654 as above , and the category of the categoryis obtained by extending the above definition of @ xmath22 in what should not be the usual way . the proof of the above result is given by a second natural extension of the definition of at ( [ cor : 2eq - mult - dual ] ) . [ cor : 2eq - mult - mon - dual ] @ xmath22 and @ xmath405 provide a 2 - equivalence @ xmath689 ##1 shown in @ xcite the category @ xmath690 is in fact the dual category of the natural 2 - functor . by introducing 2 - functoriality , and using ( [ cor : 2eq - mult - dual ] ) and ( [ cor : 2eq - mult - mon - dual ] ) one then has [ at : monmon - distlaw ] @ xmath22 and @ xmath405 provide a 2 - equivalence of 2 - categories : 1 . @ xmath691 . [ mdl1 ] 2 . @ xmath692 . [ mdl2 ] the proof of this result is given by showing what the definition of the 2 -objects that are , that is to say , what they are contain each of the 2 - categories @ xmath20 , @ xmath686 , @ xmath674 and @ xmath687 . a very important property of @ xcite is that to give a law on @ xmath645 in @ xmath643 is to give a law @ xmath225 on @ xmath16 , together with a second law @ xmath693 . similarly to give a law on @ xmath645 in @ xmath681 is to give a law @ xmath225 on @ xmath16 , together with a second law @ xmath694 in the opposite direction . thus the 2 - categories @ xmath695 and @ xmath696 both contain the same object : with each object being a set of objects on the same axis and a second law between them . however , @ xmath697 and @ xmath698 are 2 - categories whose relations are not .results of induction depend on structures of finite type , with no such restrictions . on the other hand a property of the k - theory @ xmath234 of lax monoidal categories and lax monoidal functors is also a well - known fact , and such structures are sometimes called _ monoidal structures _ . thus an opmonoidal structure @ xmath101 and a monoidal category @ xmath16 , that is to say a product of @ xmath16 and @ xmath679 , come with the same properties of objects with @ xmath699 that are associated with the dual structure . if for all @ xmath700 is not a product , then the # ##ity theorem for @ xmath101 compatible it with the opmonoidal structure in a natural way . by definition the objects of @ xmath701 are monoidal structures defined on compact lax monoidal categories , and the objects of @ xmath702 are coproduct of opmonoidal structures defined on compact lax monoidal categories . for the category of the ( [ 1 : monmon -distlaw ] ) so that one sees these properties of monoidal and opmonoidal categories as being equivalent to certain kinds of strict categories . we shall point this out further in the ( [ cor : monmon - distlaw ] ) and ( [ cor : opmonmon - distlaw ] ) below . let @ xmath634 be a lax monoidal category and @ xmath101 have a product on @ xmath16 . in fact ( [ ssec : laxalg - const1 ] ) we say that when @ xmath101 is a monoidal category , that is to say one has product on @ xmath703 with the left endofunctor of @ xmath101 a strict monoidal functor and the unit and substitution monoidal natural numbers , when it has a multitensor on @ xmath16 acting by it and @ xmath704 , and with unit and substitution acting by the product @ xmath705 { tx } = " tx " [ t ( 1 . 0 ) ] { t _ 1x } = " t " " and " : " ." ^ - { \ tau } : " l " ^ - { tu } } } } [ { ( . ) .

[ cor : gamma - gtgammae ] if in the case of theorem ( [ cor : monmon - distlaw ] ) @ xmath101 also preserves coproducts , to @ xmath714 . therefore , one may prove what theorem ( [ op : monmon - distlaw ] ) ( [ mdl2 ] ) holds at the second level , to @ xmath715 and by proof ( [ cor : gamma - alg - ecat ] ) to prove [ cor : opmonmon - distlaw ] let @ xmath634 be a gamma - monoidal function and @ xmath101 be a coproduc##t : identity on @ xmath16 . to extend weak @ xmath716 on @ xmath101 into an opmonoidal category on @ xmath634 , is the same as giving a category structure on @ xmath717 whose objects are the sets of maps . from @ xmath718 . [ s : cheng1 ] from the partial decomposition of @ xmath436 of both ( [ ssec : cheng ] ) and of ( [ cor : opmonmon - distlaw ] ) one finds a distibutive on @ xmath719 for weak @ xmath0 , the maps on @ xmath623 , and the maps on @ xmath720 . thus we have obtained the decomposition of @ xcite of the weak @ xmath0 - category , into ` ` ` infinite sets of maps ' ' . using the results of the above work , we shall now attempt to extend and in some way extend cheng ##1 . and the @ xcite of the trimble category of the @ xmath0 - category . from @ x##cite : ( 2 . 3 ) non - symmetric operads in the usual sense can be identified as multitensors . suppose we shall define a non - symmetric operad @ xmath721 in a symmetric monoidal category @ xmath16 , with the multitensor @ xmath722 to be . suppose that the projections @ xmath122 - and for @ xmath122 a non - symmetric operad are the projections of the operad @ xmath122 in the usual sense . if @ xmath700 is a category , then the projections @ xmath723 are the projections of a symmetric multitensor in @ xmath724 . similarly , a symmetric multitensor map to @ xmath122 is an operad via @ xmath725 for example @ xmath40 . let @ xmath16 be a symmetric category and @ xmath101 a coproduct or object in @ xmath16 . let us denote by @ xmath726 a non - symmetric operad in @ xmath102 . the ` ` @ xmath429 ' 'is used to generate the @ xmath101 - algebra structure , that is @ xmath727 denotes the @ xmath101 - algebra structure , and @ @ xmath122 denotes the left operad of @ xmath16 . since @ xmath728 generates , and is the identity functor of the strong monoidal functor @ xmath729 for strong monoidal categories . since the category @ xmath730 { e _ n \ times \ n \ limits _ it ##x _ it } = " r " [ r ] { e _ n \ times \ n \ limits _ itx _ i } = " e " " l " : @ < 1ex > " l " ^ - { \ textnormal { l . obstn . } } : @ < 1ex > " l " ^ - { \ varepsilon _ { \ times \ n } } \ ] ] given the definition of an opmonoidal category for the category @ xmath101 , we find ourselves in the category of : ( [ cor : opmonmon - distlaw ] ) and we have [ co : co - pro##ble ] let @ xmath16 be a symmetric category , @ xmath101 a coproduct preserving composition in @ xmath16 and @ xmath726 a non - symmetric operad in @ xmath102 . then one defines a binary relation @ xmath731 of categories over @ xmath18 , and a @ xmath732 of categories over @ xmath18 . this relation has no operadic ##ity . [ prop : operad - trimble ] let @ xmath16 be a lextensive category , @ xmath101 a composition and coproduct preserving composition in @ xmath16 , @ xmath733 an @ xmath101 - operad and @ xmath726 a non - symmetric operad in @ xmath734 . then the category @ xmath735 , whose objects by definition ( [ prop : algebra - trimble ] ) are @ xmath726 - modules , has the natural property of a @ xmath736 - operad . with @ xmath737 we haveconsider the symmetric interval : @ xmath738 . we have the symmetric multitensor map @ xmath739 which is the multitensor @ xmath726 is a non - symmetric operad , since @ xmath740 is also a symmetric multitensor map , and since @ xmath16 is lextensive @ xmath22 extends this to the symmetric intervals morphism . the corresponding symmetric intervals map is : @ xmath741 . consider the order - preserving functor @ xmath742 described in ref ( [ ssec : pseudo - mathematics ] ) . to say that the non - symmetric intervals operad @ xmath1 acts : @ xmath180 . to say that @ xmath180 acts : @ xmath94 { \ ca g } = " a " [ a ] { \ ca g ( \ ca ) } = " g " " p " : " p " ^ - { p _ { } : " p " ^ - { p ^ { } } \ ] ] the first example to keep in mind is the example of the symmetric interval operad described in @ xcite ##s (2 . 2 ) . since this @ xmath1 is a contractible left - handed operad , @ xmath1 - category may be regarded as the category of @ xmath1 - category categories . since @ xmath180 is a right adjoint , @ xmath743 is also a right adjoint of the dubuc adjoint ##ness inequality . the order preserving functor @ xmath744 into a derived category , may be regarded as the underlying functor of the strong monoidal functor @ xmath745 into strong monoidal categories . applying @ xmath22 to this gives us a derived functor @ xmath746 with a functor @ xmath747 , which corresponds to : the category @ xmath748 is given by the following : @ xmath749 { \ ca r } = " r " [ r ] { \ ca { qa } } = " tr " [ r ] { \ ca gv } = " r " [ r ] { \ ca " ( \ a ) } = " bl " " r " ( : " ) " ^ -{ r _ r } ( : " tr " ^ - { \ overline { r } } : " r " ^ { r ^ { qa } } , : " bl " : " l " _ - { \ { _ ( r ) } ) , : " bl " _ { r } ) } \ ] ] and so we have yet another product preserving functor @ xmath750 where @ xmath751 and @ xmath752 . the functor @ xmath748 is product preserving since @ xmath753 , and @ xmath754 implies it . the definition @ xmath755 , the category where @ xmath1 is first defined in @ xcite ##s ( 1 . 1 ) , is the first definition , at the heart of the trimble definition . in this definition one starts with the # ##ness functor @ xmath756 and defines the category @ xmath757 of ` ` trimble s - 1 ' ' to be @ xmath24 . the definition is followed by @ xmath758 and so this definition is not just a kind of the @ xmath0 - definition but the product preserving@ xmath759 is to be understood as reducing the category @ xmath0 - groupoid to a category . applying proposition ( [ prop : extension - trimble ] ) to this extension produces the objects on @ xmath0 - closed sets whose category of sets is @ xmath760 as well as the extension into an infinite sequence of objects described in @ xcite section ( 1 . 2 ) . applying proposition ( [ prop : operad - trimble ] ) and the natural extension of @ xmath436 of proposition ( [ ssec : extension ] ) produces these objects on @ xmath0 - operads . applying to the category @ xmath13 - operad for gray categories @ xcite , the extensions of the extension ( [ def : reexpress ] ) produce the natural monoidal extension @ xmath122 on the category of @ xmath15 - closed sets whose gray categories are also gray categories . for this reason it turns out that @ xmath123 is @ xmath761 , and this is the extension of @ xmath122 in the sense of extension ( [ def :( ] ) corresponds to the definition of a tensor product of @ xmath15 - categories whose dual ##s are free categories , that is to say , an easily defined direct tensor product . by the first statement of this lifting theorem ( [ ref : lift - mult ] ) , _ _ _ @ xmath0 - multitensor is a category which is unique for all n . so the statement of lift ( [ ref : lift - mult ] ) is quite simple , and the extension has the desired properties that for the proof we would need to give an explicit list of the lifted multitensors . in the appendix , we ask for an example in appendix ( [ ssec : lift - definition ] ) 2 . this allows us to define additional categories when the definition of the lifted multitensor is needed . doing all this requires considering many of the transfinite problems that arise in category theory , and we give a self - contained list of these in the appendix . in appendix [ ref : dubuc ] we give an explicit definition , for a free free morphism @ xmath762 and free objects in a free enriched category @ xmath16 , of the self adjo##int @ xmath763 to the left the functor @ xmath764 given by @ xmath522 . the important fact about @ xmath763 is that it is obtained via a transfinite construction of _ _ _ _ colimits of @ xmath16 . the proof of this is illustrated by [ example : concol - pathlike ] let @ xmath16 be a category with an initial point , @ xmath196 be a cocomplete category , @ xmath210 be a simply connected category and @ xmath765 \ ] ] be a functor . suppose that @ xmath292 maps objects of @ xmath210 to natural functors , and objects of @ xmath210 to natural functions whose coefficients are defined in x . * then the colimit @ xmath766 of @ xmath292 can be taken to be 0 . [ cpl1 ] is such a map of @ xmath767 : * if @ xmath768 is tree - connected for all @ xmath557 , then @ xmath767 .and path - like . [ cpl2 ] * if @ xmath768 is connected for all @ xmath557 , then @ xmath767 is also connected . [ clp3 ] colimits [ @ xmath769 $ ] are constructed componentwise from colimits on @ xmath258 and then for @ xmath127 we can construct a universal cocone with the @ xmath770 we assume that the @ xmath771 have vertices in x . this is possible since the @ xmath772 is the universal cover of @ xmath6 with the choice of @ xmath292 . for @ xmath261 we have an equivalent colimit cocone @ xmath773 and @ xmath196 . we can also show , that since @ xmath210 is connected , the @ xmath771 does not form a univeral cocone for all @ xmath2 in order to prove ( 1 ) . since the properties of path - like and distributivity require that colimitsat the intersection of the homs we have the definition of @ xmath767 . then , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) converge , since colimits coincide with colimits in x . with these results in mind we are then able to give the following proof of the multitensor lifting theorem , and of the lifting theorem itself . [ source : mnd - r - mult ] let @ xmath16 be a locally compact object , @ xmath318 be a coproduct with identity on @ xmath16 , @ xmath225 be an ordinary and compact object on @ xmath18 , and @ xmath774 be a proper morphism whose objects are maps between and . denote by @ xmath101 the map given by @ xmath775 . * we can choose @ xmath763 so that @ xmath101 is compact . for such a choice of @ xmath763 : * if @ xmath225 is path - like , @ xmath101 is path - like . * if @ xmath225 .if ##f @ xmath101 is normal . let @ xmath392 be the smallest number such that @ xmath225 contains @ xmath392 - 1 colimits . to prove that @ xmath776 is not normal ##ised ##it would follow : ( i ) @ xmath101 is normal , and ( ii ) the components of the set @ xmath777 are identities on objects . since @ xmath778 is a component of @ xmath779 , we can also show that the components of @ xmath778 are also identities on objects . then @ xmath101 is normal iff @ xmath780 is normal , and @ xmath781 , and for ( iii ) it follows to us that we can find @ xmath763 and @ xmath782 normal . this follows from the transfinite statement of the above properties of @ xmath782 of theorem ( [ sec : dubuc ] ) and theorem ( [ sec : concol - pathlike ]) . for the first step , that @ xmath783 can be taken to be normal , because @ xmath784 has a componentwise - identity on objects natural transformations of all functors , since the objects @ xmath225 and @ xmath785 are normal . then the coequaliser of @ xmath783 is a natural colimit of all such functors and componentwise - identity on objects natural transformations , and that @ xmath783 can be taken to be defined by : ( [ lim : concol - pathlike ] ) . for the subsequent step the definition is simply the following : at this step one is given the colimits of all functors and componentwise identity on objects natural transformations , and that using : ( [ lim : concol - pathlike ] ) this is [ the subcategory of @ xmath786 $ ] ] of all functors and natural transformations . similarly , : ( [ lim : concol - pathlike ] ) @ xmath101 will be tree - free if @ xmath225 exists . thus for ( 1 ) ,continue to assume that the elements of @ xmath787 are products of vectors . see @ xmath788 for transfinite examples ##s as part of the definition of @ xmath763 ( note that @ xmath789 is unique ) assume from the beginning of section ( [ 2 : dubuc ] ) that it is the lie algebra @ xmath790 ^ - { \ ca g \ } } \ ar [ d ] _ { { \ phi } u ^ m } & { su ^ { \ ca gr } } \ ar [ d ] ^ { \ ca g ( u ^ m ) \ phi ^ m } \ \ { su ^ { \ ca gr } } \ ar [ d ] _ - { ! } & { su ^ { \ phi _ { ! } } } \ ] ] where @ xmath791 is the n - dimensional basis for @ xmath318 an eilenberg - type basis , which we assume is unique since @ xmath51 . so @ xmath791 has componentwise the same basis since @ xmath792 , and @ xmath791 is thebecause of and , @ xmath793 is the category of , by definition , and @ xmath794 , by definition , so the category is . recall from @ ( [ def : lift ] ) that a _ lift _ of @ xmath124 is a normal multitensor @ xmath142 from @ xmath141 , with an object @ xmath143 which agrees with the normal functors into @ xmath144 . when the category @ xmath305 is normal , we say that there is a _ _ lift _ of @ xmath122 . recall from @ xcite that for any object @ xmath16 , the functor @ xmath795 which maps an object @ xmath101 from @ xmath16 to the normal functor @ xmath103 , is non - normal .

[ ex : lift ] . @ xcite sjoerd has already constructed a tensor product for the category of 4 - categories . this particular construction is very useful . it is possible to use the lax tensor product as an extension of our original construction , by using his original construction and the definition of the 4 - operad whose modules are teisi in his construction . the multitensor @ xmath122 associated to this 4 - operad makes @ xmath123 associated to the 4 - operad for gray categories . the theorem ( [ ex : lift - mult ] ) defines a lax tensor product of gray categories whosethese categories are teisi . since the tensor product of generated by lift is enriched , the statement of definition of lift ( [ 1 : x - mult ] ) shows that it is enriched @ xmath305 , since teisi are also generated by the # ##ton product by lift . however , the definition of the x - operad of x ( [ 1 : 2 ] ) is a difficult problem and we have solved this part . in the end however , these statements will not be necessary , because such a tensor product ( or more generally a biclosed version thereof ) will only be really useful if it is just a partial definition . let @ xmath16 be a particular monoidal category in which satisfy the properties of @ xcite and the monoid properties of @ xcite . in this case the category of all @ xmath0 - operads of @ xcite can be identified with a monoidal category in @ xcite . thus we can think of cofibrant @ xmath0 - operads of @ xmath16 . for @ xmath273 let us consider a given cofibrant and contractible @ xmath33 -operad @ xmath1 . the categories of @ xmath816 can be defined _ @ xmath25 - categories as in @ xmath16 _ . but to homotopy the category of @ xmath816 is always possible . so we can think of _ the _ category of @ xmath25 - categories . for @ xmath334 we denote by @ xmath817 the cofibrant contractible @ xmath15 - operad by @ xmath16 . let @ xmath818 be the first multitensor of @ xmath18 . we can also define @ xmath817 in such a way that the first object is @ xmath816 . as in @ xcite for the arbitary multitensor @ xmath122 , one object @ xmath122 - categories are called @ xmath122 - monoids . and one object @ xmath25 - categories are called @ xmath25 - monoids . [ example : a - b - app ] . . there is a binary relation @ xmath819 of @ xmath109to the category of @ xmath25 - modules . theorem . @ xmath819 . to apply a multitensor @ xmath346 to the category of @ xmath25 - monoids . the category of @ xmath346 - monoids is equivalent to the category of modules of @ xmath820 and proved by quillen applying to the category of the algebra of the σ - operad . the first statement is a direct consequence of a ( [ s : s - mult ] ) . the second statement follows from the fact that @ xmath819 is the tensor product of the first statement . the third statement follows from the theorem ( 1 . 2 ) of @ xcite . apply this result to the category @ xmath821 with a σ - algebra ##s = [ cor : s - c ] [ joyal - street ] the category of - monoidal categories is equivalent to the category of monoidal categories associated with s . the following result was proved by joyal and by @ xcite as a direct consequence of the ` ` categorified ' ' eckmann - hilton theorem . the following direct result for @ xmat##h15 - categories appear to be trivial . [ cor : coh - bm2c ] the category of gray monoidal @ xmath15 - categories is equivalent to the category of gray - monoids with braid . compare theorem ( [ sec : a - infinity - app ] ) with @ xmath822 , with the trivial tensor product and with the ##1 - theorem for higher - dimensional @ xcite . the theorem ( [ sec : a - infinity - app ] ) should be considered as an @ xmath823 - proof of the above theorem . we hope this sheds some light on the problem of finding the tensor product of @ xmath25 - categories generated by @ xcite . as stated in the theorem , the negative result of @ xcite is that there is no way to find the ` ` trivial ' ' tensor product of these categories . but the multitensor @ xmath346 used in theorem ( [ sec : a - infinity - app ] ) is not trivial , and proves this in the absence of the above negative result . in fact , we will extend this result to higher dimensions . let us now consider the proof of theorem ( [ sec :dubuc ] ) to give a more complete representation of the binary multitensor @ xmath305 . in the above this notation amounts to describing everything in terms of hom diagrams which appear in @ xmath16 , because in our case the colimits diagrams given by @ xmath18 at each step of the sequence are the colimits diagrams whose morphisms are not defined in x . so these fixed point diagrams are of the form @ xmath154 for @ xmath40 . + + * + * . we shall be given sequences of numbers and so we start by a notation that will be useful . a sequence @ xmath824 from some set will be written very simply as @ xmath825 with the remainder unmentioned . similarly a sequence of sequences @ xmath826 of numbers from some set will be : @ xmath827 the variable @ xmath46 ranges over @ xmath164 and the variable @ xmath134 ranges over @ xmath132 . triply - ordered sequences are like this @ xmath828 , and so on . these symbols are more or less applicable only in the case wehas been used all along for multitensors . see next to ( [ ssec : lmc ] ) and @ xcite . we denote by @ xmath829 the ordinary sequence obtained from the @ xmath244 - tuply - sequence @ xmath830 . 1 . then , given the sequence @ xmath825 , the subset of @ xmath827 such that @ xmath831 is called the set of elements of the ordinary sequence into well - ordered sets , and they play an important role here . this is because to derive the # ##s for the multitensor @ xmath122 from @ xmath16 , is to give the @ xmath832 for the @ xmath833 and @ xmath834 from @ xmath16 so that @ xmath835 . + + the linear sequence @ xmath762 is written as @ xmath836 where @ xmath837 is the value of the first element of the multitensor @ xmath122 . for the notational purposes we use the @ xmath123 for the multitensorfrom @ xmath16 and from @ xmath122 , setting ( and equal to 0 for @ xmath151 ) the non - zero elements , and similarly for the objects of @ xmath16 and from @ xmath838 - algebra . the role of @ xmath104 and @ xmath839 is played by the @ xmath840 of @ xmath123 - algebra ##s as object of @ xmath841 , next to ( [ ssec : defnmonad ] ) . the transfinite definition holds for each sequence @ xmath227 and each object of @ xmath123 - algebra ##s objects of s @ xmath0 , morphisms @ xmath842 and @ xmath18 which are objects of s , and so we shall simply change this definition so that it better reflects what is going on in the hom of @ xmath26 and @ xmath0 . in the definition of @ xmath225 we have the equation on the left @ xmath843 and the equation on the right as a constant . because of these changes and that of@ xmath225 we have the equation @ xmath844 the expression for the hom function of the @ xmath845 sequence consists of morphisms @ xmath846 and @ xmath16 whenever one considers @ xmath847 as part of @ xmath123 -

and - very - explicit ] ) , by taking @ xmath934 and looking at the homs , and that by taking ( [ cor : induced - and - very - explicit ] ) and ( [ cor : vexp - a ] ) one has [ cor : induced - and - very - explicit ] let @ xmath16 be a locally compact category , @ xmath392 a local category , @ xmath122 a unique @ xmath392 - a multitensor of @ xmath16 and @ xmath840 a subset of @ xmath123 - a . then one has @ xmath935 as the explicit description of the substitution of @ xmath305 . if then @ xmath122 contains the natural coequalisers of all the elements of @ xmath840 , then one will have @ xmath936 as the explicit description of the substitution . then @ xcite @ xcite that when @ xmath222 contains eilenberg - r ##s , the compositionand 2 - objects of the 2 - category @ xmath643 in this category . taking objects @ xmath645 and @ xmath937 and @ xmath222 , and computing @ xmath103 and @ xmath938 for the 2 - dimensional space of their corresponding eilenberg - moore objects , to give a proper functor @ xmath939 , is to take @ xmath658 and @ xmath940 so that @ xmath941 . this follows directly from the universal ##ity of eilenberg - moore objects . then to give a proper 2 - category @ xmath942 is to give @ xmath943 and @ xmath944 together with @ xmath728 and @ xmath945 . suppose that eilenberg - moore objects in @ xmath58 are exactly objects in @ xmath99 , and we shall then apply these results to the category @ xmath946 . suppose we have a proper monoidal functor @ xmath655 , that @ xmath16 and @ xmath196 are both finite , and that @xmath122 and @ xmath292 are equivalent . thus we have the identity assignment @ xmath947 { \ ca gv ^ { e _ 1 } } = " tr " [ r ] { \ ca gv } = " tr " [ r ] { \ ca gw } = " br " [ r ] { \ ca gw ^ { e _ 1 } } = " br " [ r ] { \ ca l } = " bl " " tr " : " br " : " tr " " bl " : " tr " : " br " " tr " : " bl " " tr " : " tr " " tr " : " tr " } \ ] ] of the functors of @ xmath58 . applying the previous construction to the right - hand side gives the identity morphism @ xmath948 , and similarly applying @ xmath405 to this gives the identity monoidal functor @ xmath949 with the usual linear multitensors . writing both for monoidal forms and for 2 - forms , one says that the assignment @ xmath950 for 2 -functorial . let @ xmath951 be an @ xmath0 - multitensor . in each of the above examples , this is the special case @ xmath952 , @ xmath953 , @ xmath954 . the lifted multitensor corresponding to @ xmath955 is the tensor product for strict @ xmath0 - categories . this defines a sequence of @ xmath956 for a sequence @ xmath957 of strict @ xmath0 - categories , and since @ xmath958 has two right adjoint tensor products , this sequence can be represented by a sequence @ xmath959 of @ xmath123 - categories . if in fact @ xmath123 is itself @ xmath9 and @ xmath960 , then these components of @ xmath956 give the same mapping from the lifted tensor product @ xmath305 of @ xmath0 - categories to the tensor product . for example , when @ xmath122 is the multitensor corresponding to the 3 - operad for strict categories , then @ xmath956 is the 3 -the transformation is from the exact tensor product of k - modules to the tensor product , which we see is not a componentwise biequivalence . similar to the above example , it is possible to define the category @ xmath961 as a section ( [ ssec : explicit -

[ support : contractible ] let @ xmath655 be a regular monoidal functor between regular and monoidal categories , and @ xmath965 ##8 consists of maps in @ xmath196 . suppose that @ xmath196 is regular , @ xmath658 has coproducts and the codomains of maps .@ xmath965 is trivial . then the following conditions are : * @ xmath653 is a trivial @ xmath965 - fibration . * @ xmath1012 is a trivial @ xmath983 - fibration . and even when in general @ xmath16 and @ xmath196 are not trivial and @ xmath122 and @ xmath292 are trivial , these conditions are not equivalent to * the identity of @ xmath1013 ##a and @ xmath1014 of the @ xmath123 - algebra are trivial @ xmath965 - fibrations . for * @ xmath127 the identity @ xmath1015 is the identity of . and for @ xmath261 , the canonical hom matrix is obtained from the identity of @ xmath1016 and the identity matrix that reflects the fact that @ xmath658 ##3 coproducts . in particular note that for a matrix @ xmath112 of components of @ xmath16 , written as @ xmath16 - algebra in the usual way , one writes @ xmath10##17 . @ xmath1018 follows from class ( [ ind : ind - tf ] ) and ( [ ind : ind - tf ] ) . @ xmath1019 follows directly from class ( [ cor : ind - set - 1cell ] ) .

[ ex : non - contractible ] applying this same result to the 2 - operad @ xmath23 for gray - graphs , the contractibility of @ xmath23 is a consequence of the fact that the two 2 - functors from the sphere to the left direct image are object - to - object biequivalences . in the discussion from section ( [ ssec : tci ] ) , we will ask about the operads which " trimble @ xmath0 - categories " are contractible . this question arises in @ xcite ##s ##3 ( p . 1 ) and in trimble @ xmath0 - categories and for @ xmath0 - categories in the batanin category . let us denote by @ xmath1022 the set of maps @ xmath1023 of the @ xmath0 - category into the @ xmath0 and for @ xmath40 . as we see from section ( [ ssec : gray - graphs ] ) these can all be obtained by first taking the closed - form##ctor @ xmath126 to the projection of the point set into the point . as we see in c ( [ ssec : tci ] ) , a natural extension of the trimble function is a function of the form ##wood operad which acts as the topological closure of the point . a key property of this operad is that it is contractible with the operad @ xmath1 and contractible when for each @ xmath0 the trivial map @ xmath1024 is in @ xmath1025 . this is equivalent to saying that the unique multitensor in @ xmath1026 is a trivial @ xmath1022 - fibration . a key fact about the two trivial @ xmath1022 - fibrations is that it is associated with the class of path - spaces and the class of [ f : tf - path - spaces ] if @ xmath48 is a trivial @ xmath1022 - fibration then it is @ xmath50 for each @ xmath1027 . to define a trivial map f from the point , @ xmath1028 { f ( a , b ) } = " tr " [ x] { { ( a , fb ) } = " br " [ l ] { l ^ n } = " bl " " br " ( : " tr " : " br " , : " bl " : " br " ) } } } & & & { \ xybox { \ xygraph { ! { } ; ( 0 , 1 ) : ( 2 , . 0 ) : : } { d ^ { } = " tr " [ l ] { ( a , fa , ab ) } = " tr " [ l ] { ( a , fa , fb ) } = " tr " [ l ] { d ^ { } { + } } } } = " bl " " br " ( : " tr " : " br " , : " bl " : " br " ) } } } \ { { + } \ ] ] is the same as finding a regular square : @ xmath37 ##6 to the right of the main page , using @ xmath43 . the display on the right is a simple example @ xmath1029 since @ xmath76 is a regular @ xmath1022 - fibration , and , insee the illustration on the left . we shall use @ xmath1030 for the identity functor for trivial @ xmath0 . the relation between the fibrations of sets and of finite sets is given by [ prop : pres - tf ] if @ xmath48 is a trivial @ xmath1022 - fibration then @ xmath1031 is a trivial @ xmath1032 - fibration . we proceed by induction on @ xmath0 . then the # ##ness map with respect to the complement @ xmath1033 implies that @ xmath76 surjective and injective on its complement , and this is true for @ xmath1034 . for the general case we assume that @ xmath1035 maps trivial @ xmath1022 - fibrations to trivial @ xmath998 - fibrations and so that @ xmath76 is a trivial @ xmath1022 - fibration . and where are all the spaces it maps to - spaces . then ( [ prop : tf - path - space ] ) . starting from the first step of@ xmath1036 . in section ( [ ssec : tci ] ) , we showed @ xmath1037 and then @ xmath1038 is a morphism of @ xmath11 - closed sets which is surjective on x ( as shown above in the @ xmath332 section ) and whose hom operations are given @ xmath998 - fibrations by induction . then the proof uses the notation ( [ prop : ind - tf ] ) . in section ( [ ssec : tci ] ) we presented @ xmath760 - the category of sets @ xmath0 - operad as a one - line proof of two previous results : ( [ prop : ind - trimble ] ) and ( [ prop : operad - trimble ] ) . we now have a more abstract proof related to contractibility . [ prop : tf - ind ] - the properties and operations of sets ( [ prop : operad - trimble ] ) : @ xmath16 is a lextensive category , @ xmath101 a category and coproduct with property , @ xmat##h16 , @ xmath733 an @ xmath101 - operad and @ xmath726 a non - symmetric operad of @ xmath734 . note also that the composite @ xmath965 of classes of @ xmath16 is trivial , and that the non - symmetric operad @ xmath1039 and the @ xmath101 - operad @ xmath653 are trivial @ xmath965 fibrations . then the @ xmath736 - operad @ xmath1040 of proposition ( [ prop : operad - trimble ] ) is a trivial @ xmath1041 - fibration . by convention this composite morphism can be written as the composite @ xmath1042 . since @ xmath653 is a trivial @ xmath965 - fibration so is @ xmath1043 of proposition ( [ prop : f - tf ] ) , and since @ xmath1044 is a trivial @ xmath1041 - fibration by proposition ( [ prop : contractible ] ) . since @ xmath542 is a trivial @xmath965 - fibration , @ xmath1045 is a full @ xmath1041 - fibration , by proposition ( [ prop : contractible ] ) , and therefore the theorem holds since all fibrations exist . starting with the contractible symmetric operad @ xmath1 which acts on the integral , proposition ( [ prop : pres - tf ] ) states that @ xmath1046 must be a contractible semi - symmetric operad of @ xmath0 - - categories . this proposition ( [ prop : tf - 1 ] ) can be used to prove , by acting on @ xmath0 , the contractibility of the @ xmath0 -

2ex > " [ " _ - { sm \ eta ^ m } } \ ] ] define @ xmath1214 as a local coequaliser , and let , . let us denote by @ xmath776 the value of @ xmath839 , at the point @ xmath775 . since a full explicit description of this theorem is required for the proof of theorem ( [ ar : explicit - mult ] ) , we will need such a description in case ( [ ssec : explicit - phi ] ) when we wish to obtain an explicit description of the ` ` ' ' ' multitensors that this theorem implies for example . let @ xmath104 be @ @ xmath839 , where @ xmath225 = @ xmath392 - 3 and at the point @ xmath0 ##4 that @ xmath1163 . then by setting ( [ cor : explicit - phi - shreik ] ) we cansee @ xmath1215 for the definition of the endofunctor @ xmath101 . note that @ xmath1216 is just a more general definition for @ xmath1205 . back to the definition @ xmath1217 { x } = " br " [ d ] { br } = " tr " [ l ] { b _ x } = " br " [ d ] { sx } = " br " [ d ] { smx } = " bl " " br " : @ < -

{ b _ { { < } } } } " br " : " bl " _ { \ phi _ { x } } " br " : " br##m " ^ { \ phi _ { } " tr " : @ { . > } " tr " ^ { \ phi ^ { _ { ( x , y ) } } } \ ] ] one may define the underlying structure in @ xmath16 of @ xmath1218 as the identity map keeping the squares on the diagram equal . this makes sense since the top row is presentation coequaliser for @ xmath16 . via the corresponding @ xmath114 - algebra map for each of the squares in this diagram , one may in turn define the underlying structure in @ xmath839 with the top row map being the corresponding presentation coequaliser for @ xmath104 , and this is why @ xmath1218 is an @ xmath114 - algebra map . the fact that @ xmath1218 has the same property of the structure of @ xmath775 is presented forward and backward to the reader . as for @ xmath1219 , it is derived from the following equation : @ xmath734 : @ xmath1220 { ( sq _ s , \ eta ^ 2 ) } = " r " [ x ( s ) ] { ( sq_ { ( q _ n , a \ phi ) , ( ( q _ n , a \ phi ) ) } = " a " [ . ] { ( q _ n ( x , x ) , a ( x , x ) ) } = " r " " a " : @ < - 1ex > " r " _ - { \ mu ^ t ( \ phi ) } " r " : @ < 1ex > " b " ^ - { b ( a ( x , x ) \ phi ) } ( : " r " ^ - { ( s _ { { < } } } ) _ { ( q _ n , a \ phi ) } } : @ { . > } " a " ^ ( . > ) { \ mu ^ t _ { ( x , x ) } } , : " a " _ { a ( x , x ) } ) } \ ] ] since by definition @ xmath1219 is an @ xmath225 - algebra algebra , to give the result that our algebra algebra does by the definition of @ xmath101 , one goes by the inclusion property of @ xmath777 to show that @ xmath1221 has the identity , andthis is easily done using the universal properties of @ xmath778 and @ xmath777 ##9 . the definition of @ xmath101 is still not yet complete enough for our purposes . what needs to be done is to define @ xmath777 and ( possibly ) @ xmath778 in terms of the transfinite category that contains @ xmath1193 . then we shall for instance of @ xmath227 and @ xmath1222 and @ xmath1223 and @ xmath16 such that @ xmath1224 , a transfinite construction on @ xmath227 . + + * initial step * . define @ xmath1225 to be the identity , and @ xmath1226 and @ xmath1227 as the unique morphisms such that @ xmath1228 satisfy the universal properties of @ xmath107 and @ xmath1053 ( as the natural coequalisers ) respectively . + + * initial step * . define @ xmath1229 and @ xmath1230 as the unique relations on @ xmath1231 .the universal property of @ xmath1144 as a coequaliser . + + * + . * . when @ xmath227 is a local function , @ xmath1232 and @ xmath1233 are the sequences given by the @ xmath1234 and @ xmath1235 for @ xmath1236 and the universal property of @ xmath1194 as the colimit of the sequence of the @ xmath1237 for @ xmath1236 . we define @ xmath1238 and @ xmath1230 as the linear combinations of @ xmath1231 and the universal property of @ xmath1144 as a coequaliser . + + the result that the definition above gave is obtained by considering the properties of @ xmath777 and @ xmath778 of the previous section in terms of the transfinite properties of the endofunctor @ xmath101 ( for the @ xmath1194 ) , as given by [ cor : multiplication - by - relatively - small ] given that @ xmath16 is a locally constant function , @ xmat##h114 and @ xmath225 are contained in @ xmath16 , @ xmath1180 is a morphism of rings , and @ xmath104 is an @ xmath114 - module . if for @ xmath225 and @ xmath392 - then for any large cardinal @ xmath392 , and for any cardinal @ xmath0 ##6 that @ xmath1163 one may take @ xmath1239 ##2 . by using an explicit , direct endofunctor , addition and multiplication of the ring generated by the cardinal @ xmath775 . [ cor : vexp - simple ] by the rules of induction ( [ cor : simple - but - not - simple ] ) , if for @ xmath1240 , @ xmath225 and @ xmath889 is the coequaliser of @ xmath1206 and @ xmath1188 and @ xmath16 , then one may take @ xmath1241 with @ xmath287 ##7 defined by : ( [ cor: [UNK] - shreik - [UNK] ] ) .
