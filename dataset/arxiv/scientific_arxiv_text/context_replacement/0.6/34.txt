high q sources such as wide - band ( wgm ) sources have already reached quality values ( @ xmath0 ) as high as @ xmath3 and have shown the potential to reach even higher quality values @ xcite . however , there are limitations in terms of the linewidth and q of these high quality sources . while in theory , the q factor could be as high as @ xmath4 and be limited only by light intensity @ xcite , in practice , it is limited by additional losses in the cavity . they include absorption and scattering losses due to defects in the cavity itself , and anti - scattering losses due to optical effects . due to the extremely large cavity size and high q - factor of the cavity , the signal pick - up power is extremely high , especially in the case of an amplifier with low power ( as low as 1 mw ) . such a high light intensity leads to highly nonlinear optical processes in wgm sources , such as raman scattering , second harmonic generation , and two - dimensional absorption @ xcite . whereas this is useful for many applications , it introduces additional losses in the cavity and thus makes the q factor more difficult ( at least , making it non -2 ) @ xcite . squeezed fields of electrons and light have been used in various applications such as : for interferometric @ xcite and quantum @ xcite ##s , for quantum emission @ xcite and quantum transmission @ xcite , and for quantum absorption @ xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , no method for measurement of optical properties by means of vacuum has yet been developed . in this article we propose and describe an alternative method of measuring q factor by means of a squeezed vacuum field which is equivalent to a vacuum with two quantum sidebands @ xcite . this method is superior over other measurement methods in that it requires the introduction of a vacuum into the vacuum tube cavity to measure the optical properties within the cavity . when the vacuum frequency is detuned from the input carrier frequency , it reflects only the upper or lower quantum sidebands of the desired linewidth , reflecting the output ( the upper or lower sidebands ) and not the quantum sidebands . the linewidth of the cavity can then be measured by measuring the strength of the coupling between the upper and lower quantum sidebands with respect to the input frequency . we assume that the linewidth and q factor ofthe test values of the method compares with those measured by traditional optical methods . this paper is summarized as follows : in sec . [ sect : theory1 ] , we explain the theoretical basis for the new method . in sec . [ sect : theory2 ] , we explain the advantages of the use of squeezed vacuum as a basis for non - classical methods and use the results to obtain a new method . in fig .

( similarly for @ xmath19 , @ xmath32 , @ xmath50 , and @ xmath51 ) . the lie algebra describes the amplitude and phase vector components of the incident wave in the vector representation , @ xmath52 where we consider the vector- ic ##ic ##p @ xmath53 for the cavity @ xmath18 ( and for @ xmath19 , @ xmath32 , @ xmath50 , and @ xmath51 ) , @ xmath54 represents the matrix of electrons in the cavity , and @ xmath55 @ xmath56 represents the optical components of @ xmath57 , absorption by factor @ xmath58 , and emission by factor @ xmath59 . thus we have : @ xmath60 , \ \ l _ { \ omega } & \ equiv & \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ right [ | l _ c ( \ omega ) | \ pm l _ { \ omega } & \ equiv & \ frac { 1 } { 2 } \ right [ l _ c ( \ omega _ d + \ omega ) \ pm l _ c ( \ omega _ d -

dependent measured amplitude and phase components from @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 to : @ xmath71 \ left ( \ begin { array } { cc } 1 \ \ 1 \ end { array } \ right ) \ nonumber \ \ & & \ hspace { - 1 . 5 \ } + \ eta _ m ( 1 -

coupling associated with the lo ##ci . 1 . can be expressed in terms of the quantum efficiency of the incident field @ xmath76 since the cavity - coupled reflection @ xmath77 and the mode - coupled reflection @ xmath78 come from the same incident field @ xmath76 , so that @ xmath79 and therefore , @ xmath80 \ , ( \ begin { array } { aligned } ^ _ 2 ^ { a } \ \ eta _ 2 ^ { a } \ , { a } \ right ) \ nonumber \ \ & & \ hspace { -

induced output signal is composed of the upper sidebands within the linewidth and the associated lower sidebands outside of them . the result is the destruction of the correlation of the linewidth between the upper and lower frequency sidebands . this is analogous to the destruction of the correlation between electro - optical and quantum sidebands in vacuum , in which the correlation of thecarrier and the upper and lower sideband can be measured only when one sideband is reflected into the cavity , leaving the carrier and lower sideband . the effect could only be observed if all the signals are reflected . similar measurements could be made with the reflection of the external magnetic field in the cavity . however , the signal - to - noise ratio would not be as good as in the original measurements because the amplitude of the reflected signal is the same . it is possible to measure the maximum effective linewidth @ xmath83 , the frequency of @ xmath0 , and the amplitude @ xmath84 , and @ xmath85 \ nonumber \ \ & \ simeq & \ frac { 1 -

squeezed limit of @ xmath99 , which is the upper lower limit @ xcite , @ xmath100 . therefore , it is safe to assume that the optical properties of the squeezed vacuum arethese are shown . and @ xmath101 are represented as gas and liquid solutions , respectively , for the input state . ( a ) and ( b ) show the ( classical ) noise state with @ xmath102 db and @ xmath103 db , _ _ the center of the curve _ . ( c ) and ( d ) show the cavity - coupled response to the squeezed and anti - squeezed noise states , respectively . ( e ) and ( f ) show the cavity - coupled response to injection of the classical noise state with @ xmath104 db , @ xmath105 db . in ( e ) and ( f ) , we see that this improves the signal quality , since the squeezed noise and the anti - squeezed noise behave almost similarly [ cf . ( e ) and ( f ) ] . ] therefore , it is possible to apply this technique to such a noise state . for example , assuming that the combined noise of both states is frequency - dependent , we consider the case in which the lower sideband is fully reflected through the edge - zipper cavity and the upper sideband is partially reflected through the zipper cavity such that @ xmath##106 and @ xmath107 and @ xmath108 , respectively , which yields @ xmath109 from above . similarly , the amplitude and phase noise limits of the electric field are defined to be @ xmath110 in the case of visible light , the signal contrast can be expressed as the signal variance at detuning frequency @ xmath22 relative to the non - zero signal variance at z - axis frequency ( @ xmath111 ) , in which case @ xmath112 and @ xmath113 , and the signal contrast at the two phase frequencies are then given by @ xmath114 in the special case of @ xmath115 and @ xmath116 , we obtain @ xmath117 we find that @ xmath118 has about the same noise variance as in the general case , but @ xmath119 only if @ xmath120 is smaller . hence , @ xmath121 ( the phase noise limit ) , and using a filter we can obtain @ xmath122 , and the signal contrast for a vacuum with the same2 . this is illustrated in fig . [ s _ r _ sq ] , where we compare the signal contrast for measurements of the cavity linewidth of the classical filter with the signal contrast for squeezed variance measurements . the well - matched components of the classical and non - classical squeezed variance vary almost equally in the presence of the well - matched filter , whereas this reduces the signal contrast of the cavity . it is important to note that even in the presence of experimental difficulties , squeezed variance measurements are not limited by quantum noise itself . the standard deviation of the squeezed variance is given by @ xcite @ xmath123 therefore , the uncertainty of the measurement is proportional to the quantum noise itself , and different experiments can be performed to measure different noise ratios . this is different from the classical approach where the properties of the cavity are determined by measuring the effect of the s - wave ##form on the cavity as a result of the detuning . in this approach , the measurements are not limited by quantum noise : the number of measured photon ( mhz ) has been reduced to @ xmath124 . however , the signal - to - noise ratio increases with the number of the measured photon ##s . |and @ xmath125 ( ) . the squeezed vacuum generator is composed of an optical pulse generator ( opo ) and a second harmonic generator ( shg ) that pumps the opo . the pulse generator is tuned to the radio frequency by the pdh - 1 gate and pzt ( pzt2 ) . the homodyne length is controlled by the q - lock gate and pzt ( pzt1 ) . ] the setup is also shown in diagram . [ 2 ] . the n : yag laser ( lightwave type 126 ) has an output of cw 700 mw at 1064 nm , which is fed into the squeezed vacuum generator ( rm ) . the generator is composed of a second harmonic generator ( shg ) and an optical pulse generator ( opo ) , both driven : @ xmath126 mgo : linbo @ xmath29 the lasers exist in optical fibers ( hemilith for the shg and sapphire for the opo ) in the type 126 q - locked mode . the shg generated by the n : yag laser is 250 mw at 532 nm , which then pumps the op##o ##d starts with a vacuum cavity . the vacuum cavity generated by the opo is a vacuum vacuum tube with a carrier frequency of 0 . 1 mhz defined by the opo cavity linewidth . a quasi - vacuum field , frequency - shifted by the acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) to a frequency that is consistent with the ideal tem @ xmath127 mode , is injected into the outer half of the opo cavity . the cavity is then locked to the tem @ xmath127 mode , defined by 220 mhz from the carrier frequency , using the smith - drever - smith ( pdh ) modulation method @ xcite . the frequency - shift is necessary to ensure that no broadband laser emission at the carrier frequency is injected into the opo cavity since it acts as a filter and prevents interference transmission due to the positive ##ion of the vacuum isolator @ xcite . this is especially important for high power lasers with linewidths as low as 1 because high - power transmission is difficult to achieve . the squeezed field is injected into a vacuum vacuum tube with the fsr of 713 khz and fwhm of @ xmath2 khz , as required by modulation methods .2 . the frequency shift , of the subcarrier am @ xmath128 mhz so that the modulation mode is detuned from the tem @ xmath129 mhz to @ xmath130 mhz . as a result of this frequency shift , only the lower sidebands are at the desired linewidth , reducing the difference between the upper and lower sidebands and , therefore , reducing the squeezing and anti - squeezing . this cross - correlated squeezed vacuum signal is detected by a homodyne technique , where the signal to be detected varies with a linear electric ( lo ) field and is detected by two ( almost ) identical photodetectors . the combination of the two photodetector signals is applied to the hp4195a spectrum analysis ( ra ) to measure the noise level of the squeezed and anti - squeezed vacuum . the results are described in ref . [ linewidth ] . the ra results are then repeated several times . the maximum sensitivity of the ra analysis is 1 db . since the squeezed vacuum does not have any characteristic noise , the noise - reduction technique @ xcite is used to reduce the homodyne signal to either the squeezed or anti - squeezedn = 1 m . s . ] when comparing the experimental data points , the homodyne efficiency @ xmath131 and @ xmath132 , and the quantum efficiency of the input - mirrors @ xmath133 need to be taken into account . the sum of the homodyne efficiency and the quantum efficiency are then found to yield @ xmath134 and @ xmath135 respectively . the sum of the efficiency @ xmath136 and fig . is given by @ xmath137 . we choose @ xmath132 since the effective input - switching frequency is @ xmath138 and not @ xmath139 , which produces @ xmath140 . first , we have assumed that the output signal of @ xmath141 is free . this assumption is correct since it has a one - electron state and does not affect the linewidth of the cavity . we then compare fig . to the experimental data points with the mirrors @ xmath88 , @ xmath142 , and @ xmath22 ; and the results and the references are given in ref . [linewidth ] . the best known values are @ xmath143 , and @ xmath144 mhz . therefore , the fwhm linewidth of the cavity was chosen to be @ xmath145 mhz , which corresponds with the best known linewidth of the cavity without the loss ( @ xmath2 mhz ) . we found that @ xmath38 can be calculated from the data , and so we have used the best measured parameters to calculate the linewidth . this is possible because the size of the cavity does not affect the fsr . we have developed and successfully demonstrated a method for non - classical measurement of the cavity parameters by means of squeezed vacuum . the method has the advantage over classical measurement in that the use of a squeezed vacuum field as a proxy for cavity parameters does not cause optical interference even in solution , and is , therefore , suitable for ultrahigh mode applications such as scanning probe microscopy ( wgm ) experiments . we have demonstrated that when a squeezed vacuum field is injected into a detuned cavity , the linewidth and @ xmath0 frequency of the vacuum field can be determined by measuring the ratio of theand the spectral sidebands with respect to the resonance frequency . the linewidth of a given cavity is assumed to be @ xmath146 khz , which agrees with the actual measured linewidth of the cavity without the resonance ( @ xmath147 khz ) . we have also shown that the use of optical mirrors leads to better image quality , as well . we would like to thank our colleagues in the ligo project , including david corbitt and david wipf , and stan whitcomb for his positive feedback on the results . we also have support from national science foundation for applications . phy - 0107417 and phy - 0457264 .
