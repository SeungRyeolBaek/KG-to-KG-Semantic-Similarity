thought to be the direct result of the energy loss effects of @ xcite and the sun , the rhic and @ xmath2 @ xmath3 , parton energy loss via gamma - rays is expected to depend on the properties ( particle number and mass ) of the ` probe ' created by the radiation and on the properties ( size , and shape ) of the ` probe ' parton @ xcite . soft electrons would lose more energy than soft electrons due to the strong nuclear interaction with the medium . in fact , light and heavy particles are considered heavy particles with respect to hard partons , since their energy loss is expected to be greater , as a result of a time - dependent reduction in the phase - space into which the decay can occur @ xcite . we calculate these effects for heavy particles by the perturbative energy loss of the probe @ xmath4 , with in - plane energy loss , calculated via the bdmps energy function . the decay energies , both for light particles and electrons in @ xcite and for heavy particles in @ xcite , depend on thetransport coefficient @ xmath5 , a function of the laser wavelength , and of the in - plane path length . these coefficients are calculated at a parton - to - parton basis , using a glauber - method . measurement of the resulting @ xmath5 profile in the radial direction @ xcite . the @ xmath5 profile was created in order to measure the heavy - flavor particle nuclear modification factor @ xmath6 observed by the experiment . @ xmath7 ( fig . [ fig : rhic ] , right ) : the profile produced by the experiment for the parton - derived transport coefficient is @ xmath8 @ xmath9 . [ x = " < , ^ " , ] heavy - flavor particle density is then measured at rhic using measurements of the nuclear modification factor @ xmath10 of ` non - photonic ' ( @ xmath11 - lyman - and @ xmath12 - dalitz - conversion ) free particles . the most recent results for phenix @ xcite and alpha @ xcite , at up to 6 and 10 gev , respectively , are shown in fig . [ fig : rhic ] ( right ) . since this is an experiment ,, with charm decay dominating at low @ xmath4 and photon ##s dominating at high @ xmath4 , the results with time - dependent energy level measurements should depend on a clear and well - defined pp baseline . this data is unfortunately limited at the moment , as we see in the figure . the state - of - the - art perturbative methods ( fonll ) , that we use at pp baseline , show that , at pp baseline , charm decay affect the electron @ xmath4 spectrum down to about 2 gev @ xcite . however , there is a large perturbative uncertainty on position of @ xmath4 of the @ xmath13 - decay / @ xmath14 - decay critical region : depending on the parameters of the model and renormalization , this uncertainty can range from 1 to 10 gev @ xcite . in particular , the uncertainty tends to underpredict the non - photonic electron states observed in pp collisions @ xcite . for our electron @ xmath10 spectrum ( cf . [ ref : rhic ] , below ) , in addition to the uncertainty in the electron states ( as for @ xmath8 , above , @ xmath##9 ) , we can compensate for the perturbative uncertainty in determining the scale of the charm and of the @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 scale ##s ( the latter corresponding to the @ xmath15 scale ) @ xcite . we find that the mass loss rate of single electrons is only 0 . 5 less than that of high - mass electrons . thus , we are in fact close to the mass basis of parton energy loss . the experimental data cannot allow us to make claims of consistency between theory and experiment , nor do they support establishing the correct mass hierarchy . it is important to note that , in principle , the perturbative uncertainty in determining the partonic mass ##s is comparable to the model - based uncertainty in determining @ xmath5 . if the experimental work at rhic succeeded in determining the mass and charm due to single electrons , the accuracy of the experimental - theoretical approach would be greatly improved . ( left ) and @ xmath1 ( right ) [ for the rest of the one - dimensional models and for the model , in which the exact mass basis of parton energy loss is unknown @ xcite , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ]the mass will be measured with differential cross sections @ lhc , and the analysis will be performed with methods suitable for the study of alpha and beta decay ##s . therefore , it should be possible to carry out a direct measurement of the mass of light - flavor particles , @ xmath0 particles , and @ xmath1 particles . we measure the heavy nuclear modification factor @ xmath10 , the very - large difference in the energy required for the measurement . @ xmath16 : @ xmath17 . we use the nlo perturbative methods for the @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 @ xmath4 - differential cross sections @ xcite . the [ mass : lhc ] ( thin lines ) shows our results for the heavy - to - light ratio of @ xmath0 and @ xmath1 particles @ xcite , defined as the ratio of the nuclear modification factor of @ xmath18 compared to that of light - flavor particles ( @ xmath19 ) : @ xmath20 . we measure the value of the ratio by directly measuring the net effect of parton energy . ( thin lines ) .the root of decay that occurs in the @ xmath21 region is probably due to the color - charge dependence of energy loss , since at lhc , most of the light - flavor energy losses come from a nuclear source . our calculations show that , for @ xmath0 , , the mass dependence is large and includes the region @ xmath22 , while for @ xmath1 , a mass dependence can be seen down to @ xmath23 . thus , the comparison of the results - @ xmath4 , for @ xmath0 , and for light - flavor - will test the color - charge dependence ( nuclear daughter vs . nuclear parent ) of parton energy loss , while the comparison for @ xmath1 , and for light - flavor nuclei will test the mass dependence @ xcite .
