nuclear multifragmentation is being actively studied both theoretically and theoretically . due to the interaction existent between the proton - electron interactions and the van der waals effect , examples of a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter were found . while the theoretical work on this phenomenon started at the end of 1980 @ xcite , the first experimental observation of the observed stability curve was made in 1995 by the aladin ##s @ xcite . a small region located at about 10 mev and ranging from 1 to 5 mev / s in energy was observed . the region was immediately associated with the possible existence of a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter and opened up opportunities for both theoretical and experimental studies . experimental studies of ars @ xcite and ars @ xcite followed suit . for different reasons they found very different stability curves , the bubble - free state being observed in the majority of reactions . also contributing to these results are both the accuracy of the experimental results and the high - energy nature of the observed molecules manifested by the influence of the equilibrated state [ @ xmath5 ] on the reaction rate . from the theoretical point of view , the firstof the aladin reaction , the kinetic energy of the spectator particles all together of about 30 @ xmath6 ( in the case of the reaction @ xmath1au + @ xmath1au , 600 mev / proton ) . more precisely , it was shown that the energies of the spectator particles are consistent with about 30 @ xmath6 in the kinetic energy of 600 to 700 mev / proton . on the other hand , the description of the reaction @ xmath7 according to the observed energy variation ( which was also shown @ xcite to be a form of quantum mechanics ) means that for the above - mentioned reaction the kinetic energy at [ @ xmath5 should be the same . therefore , we deal with several possible nonequilibrium species involved in the observed reactions with electrons which also correspond to the pre - fission and pre - break - up reactions @ xcite . the smm experiment showed a large amount of nonequilibrium energy variation in the case of the 600 mev / proton kinetic ##s reaction @ xcite . therefore , the lack of accurate theoretical models of the break - up reactions and of the observed alpha particle interactions leads tois necessary in order to distinguish between the finite and nonequilibrium states of the gibbs free energy . these methods should also satisfy the requirements of the physical laws which , in the case of statistical multifragmentation , are not microcanonic . as we have discussed @ xcite , in spite of their success in interpreting the experimental data , the two widely used statistical multifragmentation methods ( smm @ xcite and mmmc @ xcite ) are not fully satisfying the microcanonical requirements . the next section describes the developments and improvements made to the original microcanonical multifragmentation method presented in @ xcite and describes the development of the model in the new context and the presentation of the new experimental results of the aladin method @ xcite . the improvements made to the model @ xcite are summarized in section iii . section iv describes the new definition of temperature , and the new definition ( consistent with this model ) of heat transfer in finite systems ( @ xmath8 ) , as a function of the free energy and pressure and describes the differences between the theoretical model and the corresponding empirical heli - temperature model [ @ xmath9 @ xcite . ]as discussed in figure 2 . the conclusion given to the microcanonical multifragmentation model is both the _ break - up _ stage and the _ _ particle capture _ stage . + ( a ) _ _ break - up _ _ + according to the definition of above . @ xcite the current version has the following important changes : + ( a ) the new discrete energy levels are called the level density for fragments with @ xmath10 ( in the original version of the model the modified - form level density formula was used for the particle capture events ) . in this case , if the total energy of the fragment and the scale parameter is @ xcite the level density values are replaced by the width of the total energy , @ xmath11 ( where @ xmath12 denotes the width of the @ xmath13th energy level ) . without a requirement for level density ( i . e . the expected life - span must be longer than the expected lifetime of the capture event ) we have @ xmath14 = mev , where @ xmath15 denotes the width of the energy level . + ( b ) in the case of the fragment with @ xmath16 the level density formula is changed toto take into account the relative decrease of the fragments size in space - time ( due to the relative increase of the decay time ) with the increase of their kinetic energy . to this is the following : ##onic formula @ xcite is derived with the formula @ xmath17 ( see ref . @ xcite ) : @ xmath18 where @ xmath19 , @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 . + ( 1 ) _ + of the secondary decay model _ + for the @ xmath22 , it is shown that the fragment kinetic energies are very low and that the secondary decay model is not valid . according to weisskopf formula @ xcite ( scaled down to 0 for fragments smaller than @ xmath23 ) , the probability of producing a fragment @ xmath24 from an unstable state is equal to the following : @ xmath25 where @ xmath26 is the first excited states of the fragment @ xmath24 due to spontaneous fission ( their upper bound is usually around 5 - 10 mev ) , @ xmath27 is the kinetic energy of the first fragment in the center of mass ( c . m . ) region , @ xmath##28 is the mass of the particles @ xmath13 , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 , is the total energy of the fragment and the separation energy of the particles @ xmath24 and . @ xmath31 is the inverse reaction cross - section . due to the use of the multifragmentation method we estimate the mass of the individual particles @ xmath24 compared to the @ xmath32 family . for the inverse reaction cross - section we have used the # ##ly = parametrization from above . the beta decay process is performed by means of a monte carlo ( see for example @ xcite ) . for comparison with @ xmath33 ( the highest excited states of @ xmath34 being taken into account are at energies greater than 1 mev compared to the @ xmath23 family ) based on their conservation of energy we have _ the follow - up _ for @ xmath35 and weisskopf . theorem ( where @ xmath36 is the total energy of the particles @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 is the separation energy ) . the microcanonical reaction will take the general equation @ x##cite for the wave - functions which are usually replaced by the real ones below . due to the large size of the @ xmath39 model , the break - up channels are neglected ( and a simple monte carlo approach is used ) when the singular value method is used for the nuclear interaction model . in this case , the taylor - seitz method @ xcite is used for the nuclear interaction : @ xmath40 where @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 are the mass and the volume of the source nucleus , the resulting channels take the form @ xmath13 , @ xmath43 ^ { 1 / 2 } $ ] and @ xmath44 . fragment @ xmath45 is the break - up channel and @ xmath46 the radius of the fragment at normal density . it should be noted that @ xmath47 is the mass of the source nucleus at break - up and @ xmath48 is the radius of fragment @ xmath13 at normal density . for the case of the primary break - up channel , the entire model of primary and secondary break - up channels is monte carlo based . in the first version of the microcanonicalmultifragmentation ##ally , the two curves corresponding to the freeze - out points ( r = 2 . 25 a @ xmath49 and r = 2 . 25 b @ xmath49 respectively ) are : for the size of the system , ( 10 , 000 ) ( the microcanonical ) is used with the initial conditions of the system are shown in detail . these are shown in fig . 1 ( 1 ) . one may note that the main components of the lift curve from r . @ xcite are reobtained . first , one can consider the plateau - like region at the base of the lift curve , then the larger plateau - like region and finally the smallest independent plateau - like region . one should also note that the lift curve evaluated at the freeze - out radius level is : : the decrease of the freeze - out radius leads to a gradual decrease of the lift curve . as it is well known , the values of the total system heat capacity ( @ xmath8 ) as a function of the internal energy ( @ xmath50 ) and as a function of temperature ( @ xmath51 ) , provide useful information about the system temperature and the total volume. for this reason the curves @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 have been calculated ( see fig . 1 ( a ) and fig . 1 ( b ) ) . we see that the corresponding specific temperature curve ( @ xmath8 ) is calculated in the general case using the formula @ xcite : @ xmath54 ^ 2 \ right > + t ^ 2 \ right < \ { ( \ frac32 } _ 1 - \ frac52 \ right ) \ frac1 { t ^ 2 } \ right > . \ ] ] it can be seen that the @ xmath52 curve has a sharp peak of 1 . 5 mev / s of energy for the considered freeze - out region . this means that a phase transition occurs in that region . the transition temperature can be very easily determined by observing the @ xmath53 . one can trace the double - peak lines from the transition region back to the previously considered freeze - out regions . in order to make a direct comparison between the original heli structure data and the current experimental data @ xcite one needs to consider the distribution of transition states as a function of the temperature . [@ xmath5 . this is defined as in ref . @ xcite . the result is the simultaneous fit of the @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 curves . this set of curves can very accurately represent the mass and the charge of the same charged particle @ xcite . here @ xmath2 stands for the mass of the fragment , and is defined as the sum of fragments with @ xmath57 from a fragmentation event , @ xmath3 is the relative charge of the two resulting fragments and , for a fragmentation event , defined as @ xmath58 with @ xmath59 where @ xmath60 is the relative charge of a fragment and @ xmath61 is the second highest charge of a fragment from the fragmentation event . @ xmath4 is the _ # ##ing _ of a fragmentation event and is defined as the sum of the charges of the fragments with @ xmath62 . the simultaneous fit of the matching curves @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 to the same experimental data ( @ xmath1au + @ xmath1au = 1 mev / s ) is shown in ref . thethis is very important . the calculated source sequence [ @ xmath5 we need for this ] is shown in fig . 2 along with the experimental lines of the kinetic energy as a result of source sequence for the reaction @ xmath1au + @ xmath1au at 600 , 800 and 1000 mev / proton . the theoretically calculated line is very close to the experimental line corresponding to 600 mev / proton kinetic energy . the differences between the theoretically calculated source sequence and the actual experimental lines is that the experimental lines predict a quantity of non - equilibrium energy which increases with increasing the kinetic energy . as shown in fig . @ xcite , this energy can be found in both the pre - reaction and pre - start - up states . these differences are mainly due to the higher kinetic energies which , unlike @ xcite from the 1995 prediction @ xcite , are much lower . it should also be noted that , from the smm prediction @ xcite , the quantity of non - equilibrium energy predicted by the 1995 prediction is lower and that the energy predicted by this prediction is close to the experimental line of the 600 mev / protonof the reaction . after evaluating the properties of the energy reaction , direct comparison the heli - scale temperature calculated with the one previously calculated in the aladin and @ xcite is made . to this end the @ albergo temperature is calculated : @ xmath63 $ ] , the experimental values are given by @ xmath64 ( which is the value used in the aladin calculation of the heli temperature , used specifically to calculate the qsm , mc and mmmc values . ) . the temperature is shown in fig . 2 as a function of @ xmath4 . it can be seen that the relationship between the calculated @ xmath65 and the experimental data corresponding to the @ xmath1au + @ xmath1au model with 600 and 700 mev / s of energy is consistent over the energy range of @ xmath4 . in contrast , the smm model shows in the calculated @ xmath66 a slope greater than the experimental data . sumarizing , the microcanonical multifragmentation model from fig . @ xcite is modified by removing the primary break - up rate and by increasing the secondary breaking rate .the resulting curve rededuced with the new version of the model has the same shape @ xcite with an additional plateau - like region . the plateau ##s are clearly represented by the sharp edges of the @ xmath52 and @ xmath53 curves . the model has the advantage of accurately describing the ` ` definitory ' ' part of the observed multifragmentation ##s @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 . for the observed decay rate @ xmath67 [ ] by the method of the values @ xmath68 and @ xmath69 versus @ xmath70 , the nonequilibrium value of the previously calculated decay rate associated with the square of the decay rate was calculated . the direct sum of the two heli - curves has an inverse relationship with the other heli curves as calculated by the aladin group . g . fai and j . randrup , nucl . * * 404 * , 551 ( 1983 ) ;
