to determine the stability of cu surfaces with nitrogen dioxide ( no @ xmath0 ) is an important issue for development of new catalytic methods effective in the no @ xmath0 reduction experiments @ xcite . the no reduction of no @ xmath0 , for example , was found to be not stable for cu , compared with the stable ni , cu , cu , cu , and ni surfaces , although no reduction was possible at low temperatures for no @ xcite . in order to determine stable conditions for no reduction , both molecular films and high temperature films were analyzed on the experiment @ xcite . in the electronic simulation simulations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) , on the other hand , no reduction of cu was found to be possible but was less - stable compared with the experiments @ xcite . we found that the calculations were not accurate with respect to stability of cu bulk surfaces . although the simulation results showed the stability of cu bulk surfaces for no @ xmath0 reduction , there could be more stability on the nano - scale structure scale of cu . when we consider the range of nano - scale structures other than cu .of the cubic structure , we could find no structure . in this kind of case , however , many experimental studies with computer simulations have been conducted , to improve understanding of _ e . g . _ no - n structure of the molecules @ xcite . to find the cubic structure , we used # ##fine crystalline lattice . in this paper , we focused on a simple molecular structure , that of the triangular form of cubic . we used the computer simulations based on electronic structure calculations to find a very thin cubic lattice ( nano - nm ) . in this thin lattice , we added an electron , and performed an oxidation step . after analyzing the added electrons , we looked for chemical effects on the molecular structure . to find a possible oxidation mechanism and to find a reduction mechanism , we adopted simulations for reaction rate optimization . in the discussion of this paper , by comparing the chemical bond structures with each other , we can find a possible no @ xmath0 reduction mechanism by analyzing the nano - nm . we used the electronic structure calculations based on the density matrix of @ xcite to determine the molecular structure , and to determine inter - atomic distances . in this study , the kohn - teller wavefunctions were used as thes - waves and the electron charge density were modeled both on the 2d optical mesh and in the fourier transform . an approximation for the high - rate electron density of perdew , brown , and ernzerhof @ xcite using the method of the density gradient method was used . the ultra - thin nano - model @ xcite was used to model the electron charge density . most of our calculations were done in the simulation facility , the # ##lab @ xcite . the simulation results were given as follows . the theoretical cut - off for the wave function expansion was 240 [ ry ] , and the cut - off for the energy expansion was 240 [ ry ] . the brillouin mesh simulation was performed with a @ xmath1 instead of a @ xmath28 @ xmath21 for the first # ##position calculations . these results were sufficient , if the simulation environment allowed for faster calculations . the failure rate for the coupling theory meant that the theory failed , when the maximum strength of the electron magnetic field was less than a @ xmath210 @ xmath3 [ ry / r . e . ] . to improve the simulation performance of the nano - cells , we developed nano - scale models . the ideal environment for our simulationconsider the cubic triangular lattice ( cu - cu ) . in this simulation , we have data for molecular and electronic properties of cu - cu . we assume the ideal ##ized position of a cubic atomic nucleus in a cubic # ##position . the initial conditions were the same as those given in the [ figure ] . the @ xmath1 - cell number was calculated @ xmath224 @ xmath21 in this simulation . the lattice was calculated as a cubic shape . the unit cell had dimensions of 3 . in this simulation , the value of the lattice constant was calculated . the bond length was chosen to be 2 . 55 . [ figure : cu - c - c - c ] ) this value was very small compared to the bond length 2 . 55 of the cubic cubic structure . the reason for super ##ing the bond length was also to increase the electron band gap . the bond energy of cu was much higher than the total energy of 1 . 5 ev per cubic cubic t . of the triangular lattice of cu . the energy of @ xmath4 in particular was calculated as a function of the lattice constant @ xmath5 [ ] . , [ = 302 ] . from these initial conditions , wesee structure of cu - t ##l crystal structure . as an attempt to determine the local stability of cu - t , we used an intermediate two - dimensional structure ( atls ) . this structure was constructed by cutting the bulk cubic cu atoms and then placed in a cubic unit - cell . the molecular arrangement was perpendicular to the ( 100 ) atoms of cubic cu and it was placed in an orthorhombic unit cell . the difference between atls and cu - t was 0 . 5 electrons per cubic cu atom . the final analysis of the structure showed local stability . however , atls was not stable against the distortion which was observed when a no molecule was placed on it . instead , we observed a spontaneously reacted structure resulting from a no molecule placed on atls . it seems that using atls as an intermediate structure , surprisingly enough , we used spontaneous combustion in our simulation . even with this non - equilibrium structure , cu - t was found to be stable . when the no was placed on atls , formation of atls occurred and formation of cu - t was observed in our simulation . therefore , we can conclude that cu - t is stable against distortion and tends toward atls .even when we observed the realization of the atomic layer in air , however , the physical properties of the layer would be impossible to be obtained by physical methods . realization of the atomically equivalent layer , _ i . e . _ atomic - layer , would require development of a physical method . thus , realization of the atomic layer of pb on the silicon ( 111 ) substrate was achieved @ xcite . in this superconducting semiconductor material , positions of pb atoms are determined by the atomic structure of the substrate and inter - atomic distance between the atoms is therefore measured directly from the substrate . the most recent example of the realization of the atomic layer is graphene @ xcite . this highly reactive layer of carbon is able to be produced in silicon due to the strong c - c sp @ xmath6 bond . cutting the graphene off and placing it on the c - di - metal substrate , graphene is produced directly from it . in case of failure , we could observe realization of the atomic layer on a suitable silicon substrate . we would be able to produce the atomic layer as a sheet , on a surface with a nano - mm - diameter gap . thus , the properties of the atomic layer would be given off by the surface##ene ( @ xcite . ) for our case of atomic bonding , the local structure of cu is conserved . thus , we have the nano - scale band structure of a sheet of nano - scale metal . the transition of states ( ts ) of cu - 111 is shown in fig . [ fig : cu111 - cu - 111 ] . the two bands are arranged according to the bulk structure . using calculations from the low energy level , we see that the 2d band starts from - 4 . 05 ev and crosses over at the high energy . the peaks of both bands are present from - 4 . 04 ev . the 2d bands disappear at the high energy . however , parfectly the 2d band with the @ xmath7 band is present and the metal described by the @ xmath8 band . these same bands are present in the 3d band structure of cu - 111 , etc . [ fig : cu - k - m ] ) in the @ xmath9 - m line , and the cu - @ xmath9 line , we see overlap of the 2d band and the 3d band . comparison with the cu ( 111 ) structure allows us to see similarity and difference between cu - 111 andthe cubic molecular surface . the number of atoms on the surface is limited to about 0 . 5 due to two - dimensional nature . dos at the 3d band is well above 5 for cu - t , the number of atoms / atoms per cubic unit cell , so the density ranges from 5 to 10 , except for the peak at the top of the 3d band , for the cu ( 111 ) surface . the longer the length of cu is , the density of dos should be higher for a typical cubic structure . however , the higher density values for cu - t than for the bulk structure suggest that two - dimensional nature of cu - t dominates dos . since dos at the 3d band is about the same for the cu - t and the cu ( 111 ) surface , the overall density of both is expected to be higher , if the surface is completely undeformed . however , we should note that the energy of the 3d band is much closer to the surface energy for cu - t than the cu ( 111 ) surface . this also affects the correlation of cu - t against dos . when the first active site is the co - target site , changes in the values of the surface energy would be observed .however , if a bridge site or a metal site is available for no and cu - 111 , we could expect different effect in the metal reactivity from that of the cu ( 111 ) species . this is because of more area of the metal surface than is required for cu - 111 and the bond formation between no and cu - 111 can cause problems . in the next section , we discuss occurrence of the interactions between no and cu - 111 . we consider effects of no on cu - 111 and the atomic - layer structure ( ass ) based on the atomic atomic scale . the ass structure was obtained by the study of no and on atls . using simulations of no - adsorbed structures obtained from atls , we found a metal surface located on the super ##layer of cu - 111 with no in our domain . therefore , we identified cu - 111 and ass as the inter - atomic layer structures of no . the possible bridge sites for no were identified in these structures . the other structures were obtained by structural simulations . starting from an open setup with a bridge site and a distance from the no , cu - 111 , ass or atls , the possible structure was identified . after a series of simulations, we find the following two structures for molecular bonding . on cu - t , formation of a hollow site is the most favorable . on ass , a hollow site on the substrate surface is the most favorable among all : an on - top site , a hollow site on the front surface , and a hollow site on the back surface . however , we consider these as typical structures , following the following rules . first , structures favorable to molecular adsorption were found by placing cu and o sites a little apart on the surface and then folding the surface structure . we also found these very favorable molecular bonding structures on cu - t and on ass . the structures are shown in fig . [ 1 : 2 - sideview ] . as typical structures , we consider these structures only . we calculate the total energy in the following rule . @ xmath10 is , @ xmath11 is the molecular bonding energy , and @ xmath12 is the molecular bonding energy . the energies of @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 are the total energy of a cu slab with o and that of a slab with a cu slab and with o# ##ized for the cu slab , @ xmath15 is the total energy of the cu slab without si , and @ xmath16 is the total energy of the no molecule present in the unit cell with the same energy as the above figure . the total energy is expressed as , @ xmath17 the molecules used in our calculations are shown in the following table . the total energy is not shown in the figure for si . molecular transport on cu - t : : in formation of a no molecule on the surface of cu - t , a hollow site ( - 1 . 67 ev ) is selected . see the center figure of fig . [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( a ) . molecular transport on ass : : in formation of a no molecule on a si crystal - growth surface , a hollow site ( - 1 . 69 ev ) is selected . see the center figure of fig . [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( b ) . molecular transport : : molecular transport of si is performed on cu ( - 1 . 67 ev ) and on si ( - 1 . 69 ev ) . .the right figures of fig . [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( a ) and ( b ) . here , two cubic structures are shown . we have two different cubic local structures on cu - n and on o . in the latter case , the n atom is at the center of the outer oxygen layer . ( see the right figures of fig . [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( b ) . ) this structure can be considered as a cubic local structure or a cubic layer . arrangement of atoms is slightly different from the nitrogen , so that the n atom is embedded in cu layer . the o atom is at a different center and cu is embedded in o layer . the local structures of these two groups are ncu @ xmath18 and ocu @ xmath19 . finally , the ocu @ xmath19 configuration is shown . the basis for explanation of the different coordination number for cu and o is that the structure is very much distorted and that 3d @ xmath20 configuration is very stable . both atoms are in excited state and that the groups o @ xmath3 and 3d @ xmath21 are completely replaced .and four and six copper atoms . for this , we have a possible cubic structure for ass . the nitrogen atom is not present in the cu structure . ( see the second section of ms . [ 2 : 3 - sideview ] ( 2 ) . ) in this structure , the copper atom is at the bridge site and maintains two - fold coordination , while the nitrogen atom keeps one - fold coordination . then we compare the observed values of bond energy with those in the structure . the molecular bond energy is higher for abs than those for cu - like . even for the absence of a bond - breaking site on the outer face of ass , the dynamics favors the bridge site of the cu - like structure . this general ##ization seems unusual in comparison to the cubic structures reported in the literature . the most interesting aspect of our study is the determination of the molecular hydrogen bond energy . we find that the molecular transition can occur , when the copper atom can bond to the bridge site of the cu structure . the energy value of @ xmath12 ( - 1 . 66 ev on abs and - 1 . 66 ev on ass ) is very significant , since these structures arethe interaction of cu with the nu decreases . in the 3d cu ( 111 ) structure , it is the negative interaction ( with the interaction energy of - 1 . 22 ev , in ref . @ xcite ) against the coordination of cu , where the negative interaction energy is estimated to be - 1 . 22 ev in ref . @ xcite . the only difference between simulations for the cu structures and our simulations should be based on movements of cu atoms in the optimization simulation . in our simulations , movements of cu atoms are very poorly determined because the 3d structure of cu is not a linear molecule . also in the optimization simulation , we can see the nitrogen insert into the cu structure . from the simulation data , we have the following results . if the cu structure undergoes the energy changes due to the chemical reaction with no , the nitrogen atom can insert into the cu structure and form the local ncu @ xmath22 structure . ( @ xmath23 , no . ) due to the energy changes resulting from the negative interaction energy of the local ncu @ xmath22 structure , we can reach to the chemical equilibrium of cu and no . in the 3d cu nano - structure ,there can be large changes of molecular structure due to high energy and high local strain . therefore , our experiment , which was conducted on the atomic layer of cu , we have found a significant side effect of the no no reduction on these molecules . to determine the reaction temperature for the no reduction on cu - tl , we calculated the molecular structure and the existence of a transition state using the linear - to - elastic approximation . the first configuration was the free adsorbed carbon on cu - nm and the second configuration was the dissociative molecular structure obtained from [ cu - nm ] . the final configuration was determined by measuring the transition state with the equation @ xmath24 for the no no reaction . the total energy for reduction of cu in the atomic layer was calculated using the above equation . @ xmath25 the upper limit of the transition state energy was estimated to be 1 . 5 ev . in the transition state , the cu was adsorbed on cu - nm with the oxygen atom attached to the cu molecule . in the transition state , the oxygen atom had no local strain with the cu molecules to increase the bond strength . to keep this molecular structure in the transition state , the cu molecule .these electrons changed , causing a reaction in cu - cu . using the dft - gga model , we have shown that the same reaction can occur on the outer boundary layer , which is the outer layer of the layer ( n - cu ) . the stability of cu - cu against the oxidation of no was predicted to be similar to the cu ( 111 ) structure . the molecular structures for no were predicted to have high stability . however , our first simulations revealed that there was a hydrogen - bonding effect of cu and no atoms , which was also reduced by 0 . 08ev than the fully stable n - cu structure . the reaction rate simulation showed formation of a structure with an energy barrier of 1 . 4ev . thus , we can observe the structure of no on the outer boundary level . the energy barrier formation was due to formation of local n - cu and o - cu structures and formation of local n - cu @ xmath26 and n - cu @ xmath22 structures . we also observed the unusual cut - out point ( s ) of cu , which is an atomic - scale hole in the n - cu2 . the estimated value of the total free energy of the no is lower than the value found for cu - based surfaces like cu - metal . our study showed that there was a complex cu structure in which a metal oxide complex embedded in the cu structure was present . the estimated free energy of no was - 1 . 5 ev / m . flexibility against formation of this complex cu structure in the nano - nm range was needed both to prevent the formation of no and to meet the energy requirements of the co - activation reaction . the activity of no to form no should result in the atomically stable cu structure . therefore , in order to produce cu - based surfaces @ xmath0 ##7 _ , it is necessary to create complex structures of no , _ i . e . _ atomic structures , atomic scale structures , and atomic scale structures , which undergo conformational changes . this project was initiated by the national science and technology foundation and funded by grants - in - aid for scientific research , western australia ( no . 19051016 ) and by grants - in - aid for industrial research ( no . 22360049 ) . the research is being done with the computing capabilities of issp , .##iv . of japan , and ri2 . , japan c . and satterfied b . 1996 _ _ systems in clinical practice _ , 2nd ed .
