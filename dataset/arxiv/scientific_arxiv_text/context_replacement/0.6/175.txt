apart from the best known sequence , @ xmath0 which is a sequence of integers with initial values @ xmath1 these numbers can be called _ _ - sequences _ , since the removal of the sequence of @ xmath2 in favor of the sequence of integers , @ xmath3 after the death of one of them ( bacher , sloane 2004 ) , they have been listed as _ * a098777 * in the _ on - line archive of _ _ _ @ xcite , which is being maintained by sloane and his team of _ _ . the purpose of this article is to show that these numbers , while not unique , have a number of useful properties . the _ _ generating function _ , @ xmath4 is essential to our understanding . ( the fact that the initial values @ xmath5 are divided by 0 implies that @ xmath6 is , at most , @ xmath7 . ) we first show the relation between @ xmath6 and generating functions of this type introduced by john cardew dixon in 1890 ( _ vide _ @ xcite ) , and apply the relation to the most general weierstradefinition of @ xmath8functions : this is the framework of sections [ dixon - sec ] and [ weier - sec ] . a further extension of the bell curve , set out in section [ dixon - sec ] , is the interpretation of pseudo - polynomials as elements of a square matrix . first , we define a continued fraction of a certain form , related to the _ normal _ form _ of pseudo - polynomials , @ xmath9 to be expressed in the form of a power series since the coefficient of f is 1 . to obtain : @ xmath10 where the coefficients of are @ xmath11 , and the coefficients are @ xmath12 . finding a generating sequence of size 1 in what is known as the _ continued fraction _ is very difficult . the pattern was first described in and in the section [ sradd - sec ] [ proofadd - sec ] is the starting point of the above section . second , the convergents of the continued fraction can be made explicit , via generating functions : this is related to what appears to be a special class of ` ` exponential functions ' ' in the work of lomont brillhart @ xcite; in section [ ortho - sec ] . in section [ cong - sec ] , we also discuss the details of the recent work , in the form of hankel number properties and elementary functions ##s of pseudo - polynomials . as was mentioned by our friend and by the editor of _ the ramanujan journal _ , we have a few suggestions as to the motivation for this , such as the following one . one such motivation is to gain a deeper understanding of a rather interesting class of continued fraction , the ones that have coefficients that are rational ( possibly rational ) and of the form @ xmath13 . this very interesting and rather obscure class of elementary functions seems to have been first introduced by pollaczek # @ xcite . it is important to note that the ##tic - fraction @ xcite , which has led to the first test of the hypothesis @ xmath14 , has rational coefficients and sextic coefficients , a property also shared by the # ##ian ##s @ xcite and to the dixonian fraction @ xmath15 , themselves closely related to pseudo - polynomials ( section [ dixon - sec ] ) . our own continued fraction ( section[ cong - sec ] ) and pollaczek in a slightly different way : it has integer coefficients , is represented by an unsual polynomial of degree 2 . on this note , the relation of the curve to continued fraction is an open question , going back at least to taylor , stieljes , conway , and ramanujan . whereas the @ xmath16series and @ xmath17function ##s are not directly relevant to our understanding , we can assume that the continued fraction associated to the jacobian of @ xmath18 have arithmetic content : together with the hankel - evaluation properties that they possess , they have been studied by conway in his original paper @ xcite of sums of integers as sums of @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 , for rational ##s . in this sense , we give some useful hankel - tests in the [ cong - sec ] , but we leave to others the task of determining whether they are of sufficient arithmetic content . the class of orthogonal polynomials associated to the continued fraction , whose coefficients are polynomials - in - the - plane , is also of interest . orthogonal polynomials of any degree have been studied by chihara in @ x##cite . ` ` elliptic functions ' ' , that is , the notation associated with the expansion of elliptic functions , a term that goes back at least to carlitz @ xcite and they are the subject of the following article by lomont and brillhart @ xcite . the introduction of a new section ( section [ ortho - sec ] ) is of interest in this article . indeed , the pseudo - polynomials are already associated with @ xmath21 , as seen from our discussion of the structure in section [ cl - sec ] . in this section , it is also worth mentioning a new elliptic continued fraction for @ xmath22 , also discovered by de rivoal @ xcite , which is of the sextic duodecimic type ( ! ) . this and other sections highlight the fact that our knowledge of the structure of polynomials , the pollaczek continued fraction , elliptic functions , elliptic curves , and diophantine ##s ##s , is still incomplete ; but they also show that ` ` elliptic ' ' polynomials are yet to be discovered in this section ( see also our previous discussion in section [ concl - sec ] ) . this also helps to clarify the precise relationship between pseudo - polynomials and elliptic functions .the starting point is the exponential generating function given above ; it is the differential equation , @ xmath23 which also determines the first term . to solve @ xmath6 ##24 , take the functional equation and solve it , note that @ xmath24 since , by definition , one has @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 . in order to solve the second functional equation , ` ` ` ' ' , ##es @ xmath27 to give @ xmath28 which is enough to replace @ xmath29 with @ xmath30 a previously unknown value . equivalently , one has @ xmath31 which upon some simple computation yields @ xmath32 where use has been made of the unknown value @ xmath33 . the constant @ xmath30 is then obtained by means of a second taylor series ( with @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 ) , to the extent that one can have @ xmath36 . ( the results are those of @ xcite . ) in view of our current situation , it is necessary to check . a simple change of variables yields @ xmath37 where we have taken into account that @ xmath##36 . in this article , a similar expression exists @ xmath38 ( a multiple of the function @ xmath39 shown above . ) , @ xmath40 where the expression follows from the following eulerian equation @ xcite : @ xmath41 ( here , with @ xmath42 the continued fraction , so that @ xmath42 is an integral of @ xmath43 to the last term of . ] , we have @ xmath44 . ) a simple comparison shows that @ xmath45 and that we can identify @ xmath46 the function @ xmath6 can also be expressed in terms of polynomial elliptic functions introduced by a . j . dixon in his original paper @ xcite . identify the function @ xmath47 with the function @ xmath48 . , a multiple of and allows us to identify @ xmath6 . [ k - polynomials ] the polynomial elliptic function of k - polynomials is @ xmath49 where the dixonian elliptic function @ xmath47 is shown above and @ xmath38 is the constant . we can give a few examples of dixonian functions . there is an a _ b _ of ` `second - order ' ' ' functions , @ xmath39 and @ xmath50 , where @ xmath39 and @ xmath50 are values of a function and a generating function , respectively . their properties can be seen from basic calculations , first done by dixon and by jean flajolet @ xcite , starting with the differential equation , @ xmath51 and the conditions @ xmath52 , @ xmath53 . ( see also the work of lundberg @ xcite and the later work of lindquist and peetre @ xcite for a much more detailed discussion . ) for the example , we observe that @ xmath54 whose coefficients ( @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 ) are the * a104133 * and * a104134 * of sloane _ _ _ _ . the results of dixon and flajolet @ xcite give the fraction ##s for the corresponding generating functions of these functions , but these are small compared to the values of @ xmath15 at @ xmath57 , and _ _ _ at @ xmath58 , resulting in . finally , we see that , after the integral and the, we define the pair @ xmath59 such that the pair @ xmath60 parametrizes the _ _ _ _ @ xmath61 , by the polynomial @ xmath62 , which is of degree 2 . it is _ a priori _ possible to extend the polynomial generating function @ xmath6 of k - polynomials to one of the two special cases of elliptic curves . first , we show , by doing operations similar to the one of the previous section , how to arrive finally at an identity for the weierstra ##ss @ xmath8 . we show that this pair @ xmath63 is also defined by the ordinary differential equation @ xcite @ xmath64 , with the boundary equation @ xmath65 = @ xmath66 . in contrast , the pair @ xmath67 parametrizes the elliptic curve @ xmath68 , with equation @ xmath69 . the fixed point is the following curve , namely , @ xmath70 . we thus obtain the pair @ xmath71 the identity is obtained by showing that the degree of the right - hand side is 1 , @ xmath72( the first solution is ) , and with the additional equation @ xmath33 . 3 , we obtain @ xmath73 , by means of . now consider @ xmath74 the first direct solution is given by the following equation @ xmath75 which is also of the weierstra ##ss . to obtain this , one takes to consider the two sides of the equation and , and consider the sides . equation ( 2 ) also shows that @ xmath76 is closely related to the elliptic curve @ xmath77 . by @ xmath78 the curve @ xmath77 has six integral points , since it is known that the mordell curve @ xmath79 has six integral points ; so , for example , the simath equations that are available at mathematics . org . [ - u . s . jp / simath / mordell / mordell + . ] ( with the point at infinity corresponding to the last element of the fundamental group ) has a fundamental group of order 8 . the non - rational elements of this group are : @ xmath80 ( of order @ xmath81 ) , @ xmath82 ( of order @ xmath8##3 ) and @ xmath84 ( of index @ xmath85 ) . since @ xmath86 , the index @ xmath76 is the integral of the weierstra function @ xmath8 with the constant term @ xmath81 - constant term @ xmath80 of @ xmath77 . the following algorithm derives @ xmath6 from @ xmath87 and completes the final part of this section .

we can call this the ` ` primary ' ' regular lattice . there are two examples of @ xmath6 in the complex plane , namely @ xmath157 and @ xmath158 , which , upon multiplication by @ xmath131 , form the ` ` secondary ' ' regular lattice . the pole of @ xmath6 ( formed from and ) , is also known to be of the form @ xmat##h159 is a result of the form @ xmath160 $ ] , which corresponds to the 3colouring of the regular regular lattice ( since @ xmath161 is the square root of unity ) . the corresponding continued fraction result is for @ xmath6 . similarly , the factf $ ] is the value of @ xmath162 in the usual power series - generating function @ xmath163 . ] that , for @ xmath124 , @ xmath164 \ left ( \ frac { 1 } { z - 1 } + \ frac { 1 } { z } + \ frac { 1 } { a ^ n } \ right ) = - \ frac { 1 } { a ^ { n + 1 } } . \ ] ] is the corresponding partial - order result for @ xmath121 . the result defines the 3 - lattice as a three - dimensional set of real and complex numbers , and that works similarly to the regular lattice . it may be of interest to study the continued fraction corresponding to the regular lattice ##s . it is also of note that the definition of the ` ` lemniscatic' ' and , relative to the cubic root , have been published by hurwitz @ xcite . this work attempts to describe the computer algorithms used to obtain our explicit continued fraction expansion from an addition formula of a similar form . an alternative method relative to partial - sums is , in section [ experadd - sec ] . we can then examine the results in section [ proofadd - sec ] and thus obtain our explicit continued fraction expansion ( section [ cd - sec ] ) . stieltjes and rogers also showed that the continued fraction expansion of the exponential generating function , @ xmath165 , is closely related to _ addition formula _ satisfied by the corresponding exponential generating function , @ xmath166 . first , by definition . let @ xmath167 be a formal power series . this is said to be the _ addition formula of the stieltjes - rogers _ if there are nonzero integers @ xmath168 and a power series @ xmath169 , such that @ xmath170 where @ xmath171 has coefficients @ xmath123 and is satisfied by @ xmath172 . second , the last condition is@ xmath173 is zero , the expression @ xmath174 is a good approximation for what follows . the addition formula gives rise to an algorithm for computing the @ xmath175 , and @ xmath176 , either directly or via the decimal expansion . first , using @ xmath177 as the addition formula means that @ xmath176 will be equal to @ xmath178 ( this makes use of the coefficients @ xmath179 ) . second , suppose that the coefficients @ xmath180 and the coefficients @ xmath181 have already been computed . then , by computing @ xmath182 as the addition formula with respect to @ xmath183 , and computing @ xmath177 , one gets @ xmath184 _ { x = 1 } = \ int _ \ omega \ varphi _ \ omega ( x ) . \ ] ] upon considering the coefficients of @ xmath185 and the power series of the coefficients , we find that _ at least _ the nonzero coefficients @ xmath186 will satisfy the formula , and the coefficients @ xmath187. if this point has been reached , then @ xmath188 is now determined by a linear combination of the function @ xmath189 , together with that of @ xmath190 , and the construction will continue . this section also covers the whole class of cases in which the @ xmath175 results : _ sequence @ xmath175 refers to the function sequence determined by @ xmath191 by the partial derivatives @ xmath192 of the function @ xmath176 _ . this result , albeit suboptimal from a mathematical point of view , allows us to work with the problems related to the generating function of a given infinite sequence @ xmath193 , a fact that can be very useful in the [ experadd - math ] . the results of the stieltjes ' algorithm are also related to the fraction ##s as shown by the following : the ##s attributed to stieltjes @ xcite and rogers @ xcite ; see also perron @ xcite and rogers @ xcite .

1 ] , yields the continued fraction ##s : @ xmath208 where the coefficients @ xmath209 , are expressed simply as sums of two prime ##s . the followingof course ##ity uses the definition of @ xmath210 . the [ sradd - project ] has shown that , in order to use the definition of a continued fraction formula for n - series , we need to find a properly rounded addition formula for their common arithmetic , @ xmath6 , which is linear . we proceed first in an experimental manner in order to determine the general case of such an addition formula . once this has been done , the study of our general continued fraction leads to the general problems to be set out in the next section . the first problem that comes to mind is to look for an addition formula of linear type relative to the general case , namely , @ xmath211 for a polynomial ( or infinite series ) @ xmath212 . however , all these formulas can only come from a group of elliptic functions that have _ n _ parametrized coefficients , of which there is @ xmath213 ( this is not part of the list of the elliptic functions due to meixner @ xcite . ) therefore , elliptic functions are not amongst this group . another source of information is the continued fraction related to elliptic curves , which is also due to stiel##tjes and others . with @ xmath18 the jacobian elliptic curve , as previously stated , where we have the expression @ xmath214 therefore , we have @ xmath215 , for which @ xcite . this can be transformed into the equivalent stieltjes ' formula ( subject to conditions ) , namely , @ xmath216 corresponding to the continued fraction [ @ xmath217 where @ xmath218 \ cn ( z ) $ ] . we then proceed to the continued fraction formula corresponding to z - 1 which , by setting [ sradd - 1 ] , is finding the first multiplication factor for @ xmath6 . based on results with the original conditions as well as the results from the elliptic and jacobian cases , we are looking for an equivalent formula of the form @ xmath219 for each term of @ xmath220 , with ( at most ) @ xmath221 , and @ xmath222 , and @ xmath223 . since the same term is contained in the continued fraction , it is reasonable then to assume that @ xmath224 , @ xmath225 ,which then leads to the ` ` even - odd ' ' addition formula , @ xmath226 where @ xmath227 \ psi ( w ) $ ] and @ xmath228 \ psi ( w ) $ ] . using the definition of , we can look for an addition formula of the form @ xmath229 where @ xmath230 implies that the function @ xmath231 is a constant . the main advantage of the above formulas and is that their accuracy can be independently estimated . thus , from the previous section , we have found an algorithm that will make the ( constant ) @ xmath232 proportional to @ xmath233 , this to the desired value . one then proceeds to show that @ xmath234 comparison of these values for about a third of the @ xmath235 and related functions from the year 50100 tells us that we are on the right track . in addition , we show us that @ xmath236 proportional to @ xmath237 , the order . from @ xmath238 onwards , the function @ xmath239 that results in will be proportional to @ xmath##240 of the addition formula , whose form appears as @ xmath241 . that is @ xmath240 must itself , under certain conditions , be a linear combination of @ xmath6 and @ xmath242 without a root , and that @ xmath243 and , assuming the power series of the coefficients of the continued fraction to continue with , we can determine the smallest possible shape of the @ xmath244 and @ xmath245 respectively . the shape @ xmath246 is then determined on the basis of the fact that @ xmath247 must be a linear combination of @ xmath248 . all in all , the form of the addition formula of interest is in question , and we come very close to finding the addition formula for @ xmath6 @ xmath249 which we shall see in the next section . at this point , we conclude that determining the continued fraction corresponding to the exponential generating function @ xmath250 of half - integers amounts to testing the form of the above addition formula for the exponential generating function @ xmath6 . the method we use is a computer - aided one . if weshall note , it only performs basic algebraic operations ; namely , the usual multiplication , additions , division , as well as basic linear functions . the operations are performed using the maple linear algebra system ( version 2 ) . without any attempt at programming ( we just expect our program to work only on the most basic algebraic operations ) , the actual program amounts to the mathematical equivalent of a few hundred machine words each , with a few seconds of cpu time . [ c - code ] the algorithm @ xmath6 has the following mathematical equations : @ xmath251 we have _ a priori _ access to either the dixon or the weierstra algorithm , and we have support for the dixon . the weierstra @ xmath8function , @ xmath252 has the two following equations @ xmath253 the first one ( def ) is the partial differential equation , which appears as _ existence _ of @ xmath8 ; the second one ( def ) is the basic _ existence _ equation of the curves , @ xcite . both are ` ` and ' ' to us ; they can be used as _ and ##s _ functions to extend and solve equations . @xmath8 . let @ xmath254 be the first term ( real number ) of theorem [ weier - sec ] . we find that @ xmath145 . the derivation rule ( def ) starts with the formula of @ xmath6 given in the [ weier - sec ] , above , and one writes @ xmath6 as a rational function of @ xmath255 and @ xmath256 , where @ xmath257 . similar values are obtained for @ xmath242 ( using the derivation rule combined with the derivatives rule ( def ) ) and @ xmath258 ( since @ xmath8 is an even number , and @ xmath96 an odd ) . in this case , one then writes the values of @ xmath259 for @ xmath260 where the last term is a fraction @ xmath261 , obtained by repeated application of the ( def ) rule . let then @ xmath262 be the difference between the left - hand side and the right - hand side of the theorem to be proved , and . in the formula described above , @ xmath262 is thethe function , with term = @ xmath263 , has the _ normal _ form @ xmath264 , where @ xmath265 , @ xmath266 , and , for @ xmath267 , with @ xmath183 and @ xmath43 . the ( very simple ) inverse function has to the form @ xmath268 , with term @ xmath113 and term @ xmath269 being , respectively , 2388 and 1256 monomials . we can then proceed with the function ( def ) , given by @ xmath270 the above is also directly given by the linear transformation . when this is done , we find that @ xmath113 reduces to zero , and @ xmath269 is reduced to an _ nonzero _ term , which is of degree 7 in @ xmath271 and of degree 8 in @ xmath272 . the proof of the addition formula for @ xmath6 is quite straightforward . the direct application of theorem [ sradd - prop ] to the addition formula given in theorem [ r - prop ] gives rise to ourmain continued fraction .

[ qegf ] let @ xmath304 be the power series function of the orthogonal group @ xmath305 of , with and : @ xmath306 be the orthogonal group @ xmath307 which is of type @ xmath57 and is parametrized by @ xmath308 and let @ xmath309 be the function that defines @ xmath310 : @ xmath311 : @ x##math312 and , the two symbolic operations @ xmath313 here , the two functions @ xmath314 and @ xmath315 this was first arrived at by a combination of manual and of partly automated methods , based on ` ` integration ' ' of the numbers as well as the # ##s symbolic integration algorithm . rather than presenting a manual proof of the solutions of the defining equation , we have chosen to present a computer - aided proof of . in this case , we assume we have variables , not numbers , and time . the price to be paid was only a few hours of work with the symbolic integration and ( yes ! ) a few hours of computer processing time . as in the previous proof , only well - known non - manual methods are being used . once again , there is no difficulty in finding the solutions against the numbers corresponding to step 3 and 4 . our proof of the solution then comes down to finding a first - order differential equation , @ xmath316 , with coefficients of @ xmath317 , that is satisfied by the boundary between the two sides of . it is then possible to show that both sides satisfy the same boundary condition satisfied by the coefficients of @ x##math318 leads to @ xmath319 . the above proof relies on the _ holonomic function _ provided by zeilberger @ xcite , with other references to be found in works of others , such as @ xcite and ( * ? ? ? ) @ xmath320 be the ground field , which we take it to be @ xmath317 , the field of continued fraction of @ xmath321 .

[ cong - fig ] @ xmath423 the sequence @ xmath126 of pseudo - integers , also occurring modulo the integer @xmath424 . @ xmath425 for example @ xmath426 , the sequence @ xmath126 has modulo @ xmath427 a linear sequence with integer coefficients that is of order at most @ xmath414 . the result is an example of the simple result that @ xmath428fraction ##es with integer coefficients will induce ##s ##s @ xcite . @ xmath423 the infinite continued fraction of the number field sequence @ xmath250 of non - integers has its root of @ xmath429 and a root of order @ xmath430 . in particular , the roots made by the roots @ xmath430 , @ xmath431 , and so on , of this continued fraction are equal modulo @ xmath429 . in other words , @ xmath250 is equal modulo @ xmath429 to the @ xmath418th root of the continued fraction . moreover , it has , modulo @ xmath429 , a linear sequence of order at most @ xmath418 . @it is also integral modulo @ xmath418 . @ xmath425 the properties of of the products of the series obtained from these properties of the k - polynomials can be further improved @ xcite . by the expression @ xmath432determinant reduction of the series and their products , the sum of the successive convergents of is the equation @ xmath433 this leads to the @ xmath428fraction and to @ xmath250 , when the @ xmath434 are taken to be polynomials in . by assuming that @ xmath250 is the sum of the sums of the successive convergents , we can obtain , for all @ xmath435 , @ xmath436 by addition , since the @ xmath434 are all integers and the @ xmath437 is identical with @ xmath438 , we obtain , @ xmath439 in the case that all of the coefficients are integers , by addition modulo @ xmath418 . similarly , modulo @ xmath418 , the @ xmath121 is a linear equation whosethis form is also the form of @ xmath440 ( 1 + @ xmath418 ) . as an example , similarly to @ xmath441 , we consider the form @ xmath442 which also explain the use of figure [ cong - 1 ] for the @ xmath443 ; for example , from the form @ xmath444 , we get @ xmath445 . for @ xmath446 , the form @ xmath447 describes the absolute value of @ xmath126 modulo 7 and the sequence up to 7 . in contrast , for @ xmath448 , we find that @ xmath449 ( @ xmath450 up to 1 modulo 7 ) , thus showing that the @ xmath121 with @ xmath451 are always divided by 7 . as the above figure shows , arithmetic properties of 7 - 1 are closely related to the properties of the @ xmath452 , whose integer generating function has been described by figure [ qegf ] . let the @ xmath343 be an integer multiple of the @ xmat##h123 . without giving a formal definition , we may rely on the possibility of working out , as illustrated by the following examples . namely , for @ xmath414 a function of the form @ xmath453 : @ xmath454 \ mod ~ 12 & \ mod ~ 18 & \ mod ~ 19 & \ mod ~ 20 \ \ \ hline \ ds \ frac { p _ 6 } { p _ 6 } \ equiv \ frac { \ pi _ 7 } { 1 + 4z ^ 2 } & \ ds \ frac { p _ { 19 } } { p _ { 12 } } \ equiv \ frac { \ pi _ { 19 } } { 1 + 11z ^ { 18 } } & \ ds \ frac { p _ { 19 } } { p _ { 19 } } \ equiv \ frac { \ pi _ { 12 } } { 1 + 11z ^ { 18 } } & \ ds \ frac { p _ { 19 } } { p _ { 30 } } \ equiv \ frac { \ pi _ { 31 } } { 1 + 4z ^ { 30 } } . \ \ [ ] .5 mm ] \ hline \ hline \ end { array } $ } \ ] ] and , for @ xmath414 a function of the form @ xmath455 : @ xmath454 \ mod ~ 15 & \ mod ~ 16 & \ mod ~ 17 & \ mod ~ 18 \ \ \ hline \ , \ frac { p _ 4 } { p _ 5 } \ equiv { \ pi _ 11 } & \ ds \ frac { q _ { 10 } } { q _ { 10 } } \ equiv { \ pi _ { 11 } } & \ ds \ frac { q _ { 22 } } { q _ { 22 } } \ equiv { \ pi _ { 22 } } & \ ds \ frac { q _ { 23 } } { q _ { 23 } } \ equiv { \ pi _ { 22 } } . \ \ [ 1 . 5 mm ] \ hline \ hline \ end { array } $ } \ ] ] the connection between elliptic functions and continued fraction is an open problem , one that is still important . comparisons are made with the elliptic function , in the form of the forms of @ xmath16##series identities , starting with , and including the # # ramanujan series ( * ?
