in modern dark matter models , the normally uniform distribution of matter in the universe is predicted to evolve into a complex network of loops and strings , structures which have been dubbed the ` ` dark forest ' ' . the filamentary distribution of matter in the early universe has been studied in detail by using large - scale surveys such as the 2dfgrs ( colless et al . 2001 , baugh et al . 2004 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , stoughton et al . 2002 , doroshkevich et al . 2004 ) and the 2 @ xmath19 digital sky survey ( 2mass , maller et al . ) to accurately measure this distribution ( jenkins et al . 1998 ; colberg et al . 2004 ) and show that they are at the tip of the end of this tangled web ( katz et al . 1996 ; miralda - escud et al . ) models suggest that in the early universe , in addition to dark matter and matter , the universe are also composed of a state of cold , photoionised matter ( the 2 @ xmath0 state of the universe ) and a highly dense , high - temperature gas state .and between @ xmath20 k and @ xmath21 k that contain most of the baryonic radiation , the ` ` red - hot ' ' background radiation ( wang , cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al . 1999 ) . the questions on the physical properties , namely , the heavy ion ##ization of matter in the low - energy cosmic background are currently very high . the model of the universe appears to be a poor candidate of numerical simulations ( dav et al . ) , considerable resources are currently being invested in the search for it , and , more importantly , the large filamentary structure predicted by the model . large - scale such structures have been observed in x - ray spectra ( wang et al . 1997 ; scharf et al . 2000 ; tittley & henriksen 2001 ; rines et al 2001 ) . however , x - ray spectroscopy studies with modern techniques only detect gas which is hotter and heavier than the background ; this x - ray emission gas is only known to contain a significant fraction of the present - day mass ( dav et al . the most promising approach for studying the universe is the gravityone is to look for infrared ( o @ xmath4roman6 , o @ xmath4roman8 ) and x - ray ( o @ xmath4roman7 , ne @ xmath4roman8 , ne @ xmath4roman9 ) absorption lines corresponding to the lines in the spectrum of the qsos / agns ( tripp et al . 2000 , 2001 ; smith et al . 2002 , 2005 ; nicastro et al . 2002 ; bergeron et al . 2002 ; richter et al . 2004 ; sembach et al . 2004 ; prochaska et al . 2004 ; danforth & shull 2005 ) . while these lines are a useful and accurate measure of the universe , the ion - ##ization method of the measurement of the # ##line provides little information in the nature of the gas , e . g . , whether the lines occur in an active galactic nucleus / halo , a galaxy cluster , or low - mass regions of a large - scale galaxy or both . however , to study the properties of the background gas at high energies , several groups are conducting large - scale measurements and observations of qsos in well - known galaxy clusters .2004 . for example , to identify organic molecules in large - scale clusters , bregman et al . ( 2004 ) have searched for sight lines typical of the molecules in clusters of star clusters / superclusters and have identified several clusters . in this case , we carry out a cluster survey as part of a combined survey that includes a large _ hst _ survey of high @ xmath0 and @ xmath4roman6 star clusters located near sight lines to low @ xmath0 galaxies ( tripp et al . 2004 ) and a ground based survey to determine the properties and distances of the galaxies according to the observed qsos . the ground based survey is done in three stages : first , multi - spectral ( a , b , c , d and e ) imaging is used to observe the galaxies and to measure their relative distances . second , the images are taken for the galaxies that are located ( according to the observed redhshifts ) within the distance that the observed galaxies . as part of the large _ hst _ survey , we have identified the galaxies hs0624 + 6907 ( @ xmath22= 0 . 3700 ) with the e140 _ echelle telescope of the space telescope imaging system ( stis ) on board the _ infrared _ telescope _ . we have also obtained multiband imaging and optical images of galaxies in the 0624 region . the spectral line to 0624 is in the large abell cluster ( [ see : abell _ cluster ] ) and provides an opportunity to look for gas in large - scale structures . we shall note that lines ( spectral lines ) and galaxies are located at the edges of the regions studied by the abell telescope in this field . since the background gas is neutral , and it is clear that we are observing gas in the surrounding universe , the properties of these structures are different . instead of low - metallicity neutral gas , we will find neutral , photoionised , and high - metallicity gas in these large - scale structures . this field is defined as follows . the analysis and data collection methods are described in articles , _ _ hst _ / stis and _ _ infrared sky survey _ ( ) , as well as ground - based infrared and optical resolution data . in addition ,we provide information on the spectral regions dominated by the 0624 spectral line , both from the data on abell stars and from our recent deep field observations . the line - emission spectroscopy methods are discussed in 4 , and we present the physical properties and metallicity of the lines in 5 . section 6 discusses the analysis of the complete set of ly @ xmath16 lines obtained from the stis , with emphasis on the search for the ly @ xmath16 lines . section 7 reviews the results of this study , and we present our results in 8 . in this section , we present the following theoretical models : @ xmath23 , @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . 0624 was used with stis on 22 feb . 2002 and 23 - 24 feb . 2002 as part of the program of _ hst _ 1 _ ( n = 9184 ) . the echelle detector was used with the e140 optical telescope which has a resolution of 10 fwhm and covers the 1150 @ xmath261730 lines with only a few small gaps between them at wavelengths greater than 1630 . the @ xmath27 ##0 detector was used to determinethe tips of the ends of the antenna stick out . the total processing time is 1 . 5 ksec . the frequencies are , as described by tripp et al . ( 2001 ) , the stis and members of calstis from the goddard space flight center . the average signal - to - noise ( db / h ) per active signal is 8 at 1150 , increases again to 8 at 1340 and then decreases to 0 at 1730 . for more details on the design and operation of stis , see woodgate et al . ( 1998 ) and kimble et al . ( 1998 ) . hs0624 + 6907 was also used by the nasa ##rs on four spectra in 1999 january and 2002 february ( serial numbers p1071001 , p1071002 , s6011201 , and s6011202 ) . four spectra with four active channels ( ` ` ' ' ' ) , two with rf filters for each of the 905 @ xmath261105 frequency range , and two with lif filters , to the 1100 @ xmath261187 ( see smith et al . 2000 , 2002 for details on design and operation ) . the highest frequencyranging from f @ xmath2630 up to @ xmath28 ( fwhm ) . for hs0624 + 6907 , the average integration time for the lif1 channel was 1 ksec ; the other channels had much slower integration times due to channel coalignment ##s during some of the measurements . we have taken the data from the channels and then analyzed the data for calfuse ##l ##1 . 0 . 0 as described by tripp et al . ( 2005 ) . because the frequencies of the different channels have different s / r values , we have combined and analyzed all the lif data to produce the same data that we used for our analysis ( we found that combining all the lif data did not increase the spectral resolution ) . for the spectral resolution as determined by the different channels , we used only the sic2a channel . instead , we used the channels of higher resolution ( e . g . , fe @ xmath4roman2 @ xmath291144 . 94 vs . fe @ xmath4roman2 @ xmath291608 . 94 ) identified by _ fuse _ and stis in order to compare the _ fuse _ spectrum with the stis spectrum and to determine the spectralstarting analysis of the data . one of the main goals of our a @ xmath0 qso absorption system study is to study the interactions between absorption and spectral lines . these interactions require optical imaging ( for both light detection and information about the galaxy of interest ) followed by infrared spectroscopy for high resolution measurements . to begin the light - curve analysis toward 0624 , we first used the @ xmath30 set of images taken of the qso with spicam on the chandra space observatory ( apo ) 3 . 5 m telescope on 2002 january 29 . next , we obtained images of the entire galaxy for remote viewing with the noao 8k @ xmath318k ccd imaging camera ( mosa , wang et al . 1998 ) , on the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 m telescope . the spicam images were used to select targets for the sloan galactic survey survey , but initially we only used the high - resolution mosa images . [ x = " < , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] 0624 was taken with mosa on the 4 m telescope 2003 january 29 - 30 . the field of view was @ xmath32 with a resolution of @xmath33 / 34 . as summarized in table [ fig : obslog ] , images were taken of @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 with a regular star catalog for filling in gaps in the ccds and for detection of cosmic rays . the variable stars from landolt ( 1992 ) were also recorded at regular intervals . during these observations , the designation changed from @ xmath360 to @ @ xmath373 . the data was processed with the iraf ##d and mscred using various methods . the first x - ray mosa observation of 0624 is summarized in table [ fig : image ] and [ fig : fieldzoom ] . the images for follow - up observations were obtained from the data from the sextractor instrument . ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . spectra of various objects were obtained using the compact imaging camera ( mic ) on the apo 1 . 5 ##m telescope on the following dates : 2002 january 28 , 2003 february 28 @ xmath2631 , 2003 march 03 , 2003 march 26 , and 2003 april 1 . spectra were obtained using a single 1 . 5 # ##ond telescope with spectral response times ranging from 360 to 1800 seconds per observation. the wavelengths were recorded in the traditional way , and the absolute measurements using neon - neon - neon arc - laser technology . the 360 - degree changes in wavelength were recorded as well , by comparing the measured wavelengths with their absolute values . the data was then recorded at wavelengths of @ xmath38 fwhm . llccccccccc & & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & & qso & 06 : 30 : 02 . 99 & 07 : 05 : 03 . 0 & 0 . 3700 & 0 . 000 & 0 . 000 & 0 . 0 & 14 . 0 & 15 . 0 & -

19. . the infrared measurements are made using the method developed by jenkins et al . we used the iraf and fxcor to cross - correlation the infrared spectrum with that of the radial velocity star hd 182572 . in practice we only use the red channel channel data for the cross - correlation , where the 4000 galactic and galactic emission lines are not measured . red channel data is also used to identify and measure the number of redshifted spectral lines ( [ see ##2 ] , h @ xmath39 , h @ xmath16 , etc . ) when possible . the observed wavelengths measured in this way are shown in table [ tab : spec _ red ] and are rounded to between 150 and 200 ( which corresponds to a spectral line pseudo - resolution of 0 . 1 to 1 . 5 mpc for an ordinary spiral galaxy ) . we have observed two galaxies with the echellette spectroscopy and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al . 2001 ) on the 2 @ keck infrared telescope during the nights of 2004 - 10 and one during solar eclipse . we observed galaxy ne3 ( see table [ tab : spec _ red ] ) in echellette spectroscopy with the 2 . 5 @xmath40 slit which provides @ xmath41 spectral lines ( fwhm ) . the corresponding se13 and sw3 galaxies were observed in the same region of the na @ xmath40 slit which provides @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 . the lines were measured , and were measured with the esiredux index ( prochaska et al . 2003xavier / esi / index . net ] ) . the ne3 estimate is derived from the analysis of the high - resolution na @ xmath4roman1 and na @ xmath16 spectral lines , and the corresponding estimate is @ xmath4430 km s @ xmath28 . for se13 and sw3 , estimates are provided for the na @ xmath4roman1 , na @ xmath39 , and h @ xmath4roman2 , and respectively , and the estimates are @ xmath44150 km s @ xmath28 . the result of our absolute magnitude is ( i . e . , the number of galaxies greater than a certain number of the sextractor is ) with these estimates##troscopic ( ) is also given in table [ 1 : 2 ] as a function of the @ xmath45 magnitude and mean distance from the absorption line ( @ xmath46 ) . in the @ xmath47 region centered at 0624 , we have measured the magnitude for all galaxies less than @ xmath45 = 19 . 0 , and the range for @ xmath48 per cent and for @ xmath49 . as we shall note , there is a significant presence of absorption lines in the 0624 region at @ xmath50 = . 0635 ; at this distance , the @ xmath51 corresponds to a mean distance of 367 @ xmath7 kpc , and @ xmath45 = 19 . 0 corresponds to @ xmath52 or @ xmath53 ( or @ xmath54 from brown et al . 1996 ) . for example , the large magellanic cloud has a magnitude equal to @ xmath55 or @ xmath56 . at this distance , we have measured it only for low mass galaxies . at higher distances , a greater number of such galaxies are found, and our current survey is accurate . however , within the 10 km range , our survey is only 90 per cent accurate for galaxies smaller than @ xmath57 . using information obtained from the survey in connection with our current cluster survey , we can study the large - scale structures that are represented by the 0624 sight line . in this section we focus on these structures : the abell clusters ( [ sec : abell _ clusters ] ) as well as nearby ( and interacting ) close clusters ( [ sec : close _ groups ] ) . these are large and may contain much larger massive particles , i . e . , superclusters ( einasto et al . 2001 and references below ) . in these simulations , clusters are found at the points where large - scale structures form . to improve the accuracy of these simulations , which are now being used in a wide range of scientific fields , it is necessary to look for physical evidence of the very _ large _ structures growing into clusters and to determine the density of the clusters . the sight line to 0624 passes through a region of very high abell cluster density and is well - suited for studies of this region .compare the number of abell clusters from the sight line to 0624 , including the sample size , and the parameters ( when estimated from the data ) . the density of abell clusters in this area is very high compared to the density of the other clusters in the abell region : the number of abell clusters within 2 @ xmath58 ( 3 @ xmath59 ) of a557 ( the cluster closest to the 0624 sight line ) is 6 ( 0 . 5 ) times higher than the average cluster within 2 @ xmath60 ( 3 @ xmath59 ) of other abell clusters . einasto et al . ( 2001 ) have discovered two superclusters in the vicinity of 0624 . their supercluster scl71 ( at @ xmath61 ) includes a554 , a557 , a561 , a562 , and a565 and scl72 ( at @ xmath62 ) includes a559 and a564 . however , a557 and a561 do not have high masses , and based on our observed data , the mass of hs0624+ 6907 / abell557 ( see also [ color : bright _ red ] ) , it is likely that the clearly visible a557 is a large cluster due to the presence of two clusters at two different distances . to be sure , we will compare images with infrared spectroscopy to identify large - scale clusters . the clusters at ( a564 and a559 ) are separated by 1 . 8 from each other , and the clusters at ( a565 , a562 and a554 ) are separated by 2 . 8 and 4 . 8 . according to colberg et al . ( 2004 ) , using infrared observations , more than 90 per cent of the clusters with a magnitude greater than 10 are associated with a galaxy . we can conclude from these studies that the sight lines in the region of 0624 and those close to the sight line are included in the spectra of some of these abell cluster members , which means that these clusters extend into the cluster . in this section we make some brief observations of the clusters and the clusters close to the sight line of 0624 , as determined from our infrared observations . we include these observations in the spectrum of the abellas discussed in the previous section . we point out the # ##s of the clusters from table [ 1 : big _ bang ] . from this , we can identify two galaxy groups : these two groups appear to be located with distances similar to those of the abell cluster , i . e , at @ xmath63 ( 6 galaxies ) and @ xmath64 ( 8 galaxies ) . this means that the wall of gas from a559 to a564 may be more than 5 degrees ( 15 ) away from a559 and that between a562 and a554 it extends for at least 5 degrees ( 15 ) in order to cross the qso sight line . however , the most prominent group at are the ones above , which do not match up with the abell cluster with the higher apparent magnitude . to determine the spatial coordinates of galaxies in the most prominent groups in the mosa cluster , take a color - coded map of the spatial coordinates of the clusters . we note that the group at @ xmath65 is mostly east of the sight line . the groups associated with abell 554 / 562 / 565 , are mostly west of 0624 . the groups associated with theabell 559 / 564 supercluster appears to extend from the southwest of the sight line to the northeast . we note that these properties are not known for most of the clusters shown in fig . [ fig : abell _ map ] , including the cluster that is closest to the sight line , a557 . however , abell clusters are easily visible without the use of binoculars , and it can be seen from both [ fig : map ] and [ fig : field _ map ] that several galaxy clusters are located at the distance of a557 . it is clear that a557 is not a single cluster but rather is the largest of these clusters by volume . is it also found in these large - scale galaxy clusters ? to answer this question , we examine the spectrum of 0624 for possible close relatives to the clusters of galaxies and galaxy clusters near the qso sight line . the majority of the x @ xmath4roman1 galaxies that we have studied and identified ( see [ fig : absline ] ) in the spectrum of 0624 are located at the distance of ; the length of the line is equal to the arc - width of the galaxy . this line has beentwo important findings : first , when a gas is detected by the @ ##er @ xmath66 from the galactic center , it is almost always detected within a few centimeters of the observed gas ( from table [ tab : z _ spec ] to table [ tab : lyalist ] ) , consistent with the findings of previous studies ( e . g . , lanzetta et al . 1995 ; tripp et al . 1998 ; impey et al . 1999 ; smith et al . 2001 ; bowen et al . 2002 ; penton et al . 2002 ) . second , weak absorption is clearly detected at the center of the @ xmath67 abell 564 / 559 supercluster . this gas , is located at , , and the corresponding @ xmath4roman4 @ xmath68 1548 . 20 , 1550 . 20 , ( [ tab : z076 ] ) , and the resulting gas is very similar to that of a559 . weak absorption is clearly detected at @ xmath13 = 0 . 10822 , which is several centimeters of the abell 554 / 562 / 565 gas . third , and somewhat surprisingly , it is detectedand all the galaxies that entered into the system at 0624 . however , figure [ fig : zgaldist ] , shows that the strongest lines are found in the region of highest stellar activity , which is similar to the results of bowen et al . ( 2002 ) and y ^ ot et al . ( 2005 ) . could these lines also occur in the vicinity of individual galaxies ? as we discussed in the previous section , the strong h @ xmath4roman1 system at is composed of a large number of lines of # ##tones . these lines are located in the galactic field . in fact , we have no direct evidence that suggests a relationship between the system and the lines in this system . in the case of this strong h @ xmath4roman1 system at , the closest observed galaxy to the galactic line with this line is @ xmath69 ( ne3 , figure [ fig : n _ 1 ] ) . however , a larger and closer system could have been predicted in the previous study . using these distances ( measured and reported by bowen et al . 2003 ) to determine the closest observed galaxies with these lines @ .##math70 , we note that there are only four objects closer to the absorption line than ne3 that could be observed . these four objects are most likely since the measurements have high sensitivity . however , if we consider the closest of these objects to at @ xmath71 , the closest object to 0624 has quite a large absorption at @ xmath72 kpc . in the case of at @ xmath13 = 0 . 07573 , the nearest object in space is nw3 at @ xmath73 kpc . it is possible that this object is in the debris disk of this nearby galaxy , but we know that other galaxies are located at @ xmath74 kpc than this @ xmath75 , and many other explanations are possible ( e . g . , other galaxies with tidally locked galaxies ) . however , the object at @ xmath76 is at a great distance ( 415 ) from the nearest known object ( nw4a ) and therefore unlikely to be interaction - rich with that galaxy . we will return to the three - parameter model . as mentioned in the previous section , the [ 1 : zgaldist ] is the firstof h and ly @ xmath16 lines in the direction of 0624 . we also estimate the column density and phase shifts of the ly @ xmath16 lines in the direction of 0624 using the voigt profile fitting program vpfit ( see [ 1987rfc / vpfit . com ] ) . figure [ tab : lyalist ] shows the h @ xmath4roman1 line parameters , column density , and @ xmath77values observed in this cluster ( some of the lines are slightly distorted and the voigt profile fitting does not provide accurate estimates ; we continue our study of these lines below ) . a very large cluster of ly @ xmath16 lines is shown as @ xmath78 ##1 . 0635 in figure [ tab : zgaldist ] . the presence of the stis cluster of hs0624 + 6907 in this ly @ xmath16 cluster is evident in figure [ tab : hi00635 ] . to avoid confusion with other clusters , we will simply refer to this group of lines as the ` ` group ' ' . this cluster contains at least one h @ xmat##h4roman1 is visible over a wavelength range of 0 . o @ xmath28 . we will refer to the ' ly @ xmath16 ' in figure [ fig : hi00635 ] . @ xmath13 = 0 . 06352 . ` ` component a ' ' . component a is produced by electrons from the h @ xmath4roman1 ly @ xmath16 , ly @ xmath39 , and ly @ xmath79 , as well as the h @ xmath4roman3 @ xmath291206 . 0 , h @ xmath4roman4 @ xmath681393 . 0 , 1402 . 0 , and si @ xmath4roman4 @ xmath681548 . 0 , 1550 . 50 ' . high energy components such as h @ xmath4roman1 , h @ xmath4roman2 , and h @ xmath4roman2 are not visible at the distance of component a or at the distance of any of the other components visible in figure [ fig : hi00635 ] .the o @ xmath4roman6 line at the end of the ly @ xmath16 line also extends into a region that is partially filled by the o @ xmath80 and o @ xmath4roman2 lines . however , most of the region is free from absorption , and we find no evidence for o @ xmath4roman6 lines . we also do not find the o @ xmath4roman5 line . lccl | lccl & @ xmath81 & @ xmath82 & @ xmath83 & & @ xmath81 & @ xmath82 & @ xmath83 + @ xmath75 & ( m ) & ( ) & ( ) & @ xmath75 & ( m ) & ( ) & ( ) 0 . 017553 @ xmath84 1 . 0e -

schmidt method and the fitting of the ` ` metal electron density ' ' method ( see jenkins & sembach 1991 ; jenkins 1996 ) are used to determine the total electron density . these two methods are generally in good agreement for the spectral lines , which do not appear to be significantly affected by metal bonding . the h @ xmath4roman3 @ xmath90 and profile @ xmath91 0 . 06352 is often confused with the corresponding h @ xmath4roman##1 . h @ xmath91 0 . 05486 ( see figure [ fig : syst0063 ] ) . however , the two lines at this point have a similar two - dimensional structure ( see figure [ fig : syst0063 ] and [ fig : civ064 ] ) , and the h @ xmath4roman3 profile shape is in good agreement with those of the h @ xmath4roman4 and si @ xmath4roman4 lines . this means that ( 1 ) deviation from @ xmath13 = 0 . 05486 is significant . ##ly to the frequency range where the h @ xmath4roman3 line lies . we consider the and h @ xmath4roman1 and @ xmath920 . 05486 lines , and both of the lines are located shortward of the h @ xmath4roman3 line . the resulting profile structure is shown in figure [ fig : syst0063 ] . the profile shapes used for each of the components in the @ xmath93 profile are not well - defined . some of the components are highly correlated and are therefore more complex than the otherp - values in brackets below ; these are shown in table [ tab : lyalist ] . component a is very difficult to use for a specific purpose : the three corresponding lyman series spectra ( ly @ xmath16 , ly @ xmath39 and ly @ xmath79 ) were not available , and the voigt - fitting did not provide sufficient results for the determination of the component a h @ xmath4roman1 column width . as shown in table [ tab : spectrum ] , using a fixed - point model of a and the two column lengths of ly @ xmath94 , and @ xmath79 , we find that the component a h @ xmath4roman1 absorption profile can be determined from two different sets of values for the h @ xmath4roman1 column width and the absorption profile . one of the two values is a ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) @ xmath95 , which should yield a single absorption profile indicative of the lyman series region ( lls ) at the observed wavelength of 970 . this wavelength range is defined by the length of the sic2a band and is thesee figure [ fig : lls _ rutr ] . the m / z of the sic2a spectrum is small but still sufficient to produce @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) . the intensity ratio @ xmath97 of the lyman limit absorption and the corresponding @ xmath4roman1 spectral line is then given by @ xmath98 where @ xmath99 ) is the absorption cross section and @ xmath29 is the rest - frame energy . the sic2a spectrum does not show any direct evidence of the lyman limit absorption at the planck wavelength , but the spectral line is very similar and because of this , a strong lyman limit absorption could be expected . based on the extreme value of the energy density , @ xmath100 = 970 , we have an @ xmath101 upper bound of @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) @ xmath102 @ xmath103 ( a black hole , see figure [ fig : lls _ rutr ] ) . we also show in figure [ fig : lls _ rutr ] the lyman limit is known for@ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) = @ xmath104 @ xmath103 ( the black hole ) , which is very consistent with our initial data ##set . the lack of a lower lyman limit edge rules out the upper best @ xmath4roman1 column density of h @ xmath105 @ xmath103 implied by the curve of growth shown in figure [ fig : c ] . the h @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) value from the curve of growth ( h @ xmath106 @ xmath103 ) is consistent with the presence of a lyman limit edge . to be precise , we consider all the metallicities derived both from the upper best [ @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) @ xmath107 and from the corresponding lower best value from the curve of growth shown in figure [ fig : c ] . we then consider the physical properties and the properties of the two components implied by the column density and the phase shift derived from voigt distance measurements . we focus on the data from @ xmath##13 = 0 . 06352 and 0 . 0757 because these systems exhibit strong interactions and can be interacting with other objects / systems as described in [ 13 : 1 ] . to determine properties from the various gases in these systems ( si @ xmath4roman3 , si @ xmath4roman4 , and si @ xmath4roman4 ) , we can make various assumptions , which depend on the reaction conditions and the properties of the gas . we can assume that the gas is not photoionised , and that the observed metallicities are very low . to determine the relationship of ##s and metallicities , we use the photoionisation model ( v96 , ferland et al . 1998 ) as proposed by tripp et al . ( 2003 ) . in these models , the gases are represented by high density , axis - parallel glass sheets with a thickness that equals the actual si @ xmath4roman1 gas layer . the gas in the system is photoionised by the uv radiation from the h @ xmath108 . we use the uv absorption model as proposed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) with the thickness equal to @ x##math109 for the elements . this model is consistent with theoretical and experimental data ( shull et al . 1999 ; weymann et al . 2001 ; dav & tripp 2001 , and discussed below ) . with the time required to calculate the h @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) , the observed metal ion concentrations depend mainly on the decay rate @ xmath110 ( @ xmath111 - electron density / - atomic electron density ) , the observed metallicity , = [ ( @ xmath96 ( x ) / @ xmath96 ( y ) ) - log ( x / y ) @ xmath112 . ] and the observed relative abundance of the elements . we compute the absolute abundance , and we use the models predicted by allende prieto et al . ( 2001 , 2002 ) and holweger ( 2001 ) for hydrogen , helium , and nitrogen , respectively . the metal - ion ##isation values predicted by the photoionisation model depend on the observed uv background shape . in this model , we also use the uv background shape predicted by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) , and we computethat later studies of the uv background ( e . g . , madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ; shull et al . 1999 ) showed a much higher euv - value for metals , which is the observed scattering value for a given metallicity and surface temperature . we show how these two background shapes affect our systems by comparing our systems with the uv background shapes ( see figure ) . @ & @ r @ & @ r @ & @ xmath114 & & @ xmath81 & & + o & ( ) & @ xmath115 & ( 2 ) & @ xmath116 & @ xmath117h + & 1215 . 670 & 1 . 704 & 603 @ xmath84 + & 10 . 1 @ xmath118 & @ xmath119 + & 1025 . 722 & 1 . 909 & 349 @ xmath8421 & & @ xmath119 + & 972 . 537 & 1 . 450 & 302 @ xmath8422 & & @ xmath119 + & 1 & 1302 . 168 & 1 . 804 & .@ xmath84 9 & & @ xmath120 + c vi & 1037 . 617 & 1 . 836 & & @ xmath8417 & & @ xmath121 + si ii & 1334 . 532 & 1 . 232 & 104 @ xmath84 10 & & @ xmath122 + c vi & 1548 . 204 & 1 . 470 & 143 @ xmath84 10 & 1 . 000 @ xmath123 & 13 . 02 @ xmath840 . 03 + & 1550 . 781 & 1 . 169 & 167 @ xmath8410 & & 13 . 08 @ xmath840 . 05 + si ii & 1260 . 422 & 2 . 104 & & @ xmath8412 & & @ xmath124 + c vi & 1206 . 000 & 2 . 304 & 151 @ xmath8410 & 13 . 02 @ xmath125 & 13 . 08 @ xmath840 . 03 + si ii & 1393 . 760 & 1 . 855 & & @ xmath8410 & 13 . 05 @ xmath126 &12 . 05 @ xmath840 . 06 + & 1402 . 773 & 1 . 554 & & @ xmath8411 & & 12 . 05 @ xmath840 . 06 + & & & 1242 . 804 & 1 . 988 & & @ xmath8410 & & @ xmath127 as mentioned above , the h @ xmath4roman1 absorption lines produced by @ xmath128 are distributed over a wide velocity range of @ xmath129 ( see figure [ 1 : hi00635 ] ) . from the velocity ranges of the wang - voigt lines and , using the biweight method as developed by wang et al . ( 1990 ) , we find that the line - of - sight velocity range of this h @ xmath4roman1 absorption line is @ xmath130 . the velocity range of galaxies at this distance is close to this , but much more extreme ( due to the large changes in the gas dynamics ) . this velocity range is similar to those observed in metal - rich galaxy clusters ( e . g . zabludoff &mulchaey 1998 ) , which is important because elliptical - rich groups often have strong x - ray emission ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ) indicative of hot gas in the outer region . therefore , we should note here [ see : below ] that the available data suggest that this group is primarily composed of s - type s and s0 stars . elliptical - rich groups are generally weak in x - rays but could still be hot for stars if the gas is much hotter ( @ xmath131 1998 ) and at a much higher temperature than that found in elliptical - rich groups ( mulchaey 2000 ) . first , we note that most of the gas in the complex , @ xmath132 is likely to be hot , collisionally unstable , for two reasons : first , the observed @ xmath4roman1 lines in the complex are generally very weak . if the gas distribution is affected by thermal expansion , then the phase shift is directly proportional to the gas density , @ xmath133 , where @ xmath134 is the temperature , @ xmath135 is the gas mass density , and the highest value is for @ xmath83 .they are @ xmath28 and @ xmath136 in length . since many processes such as diffusion and light scattering processes contribute to the observed temperature , @ xmath77values are the upper limit on the temperature . applying this method to the k @ xmath77values from table [ 1 : lyalist ] , we find that all of the k @ xmath4roman1 lines and the @ xmath137 line indicate that @ xmath8 temperature , which is higher than that for the diffuse ##d medium depends on the high temperature values , especially for electron - rich gas ( e . g . , mulchaey et al . 1996 ) . in a narrow system of gases , it is possible to observe a single component a of hot gas ( see , e . g . , table 1 , tripp & smith 2000 ) , where the metal atoms do not indicate the presence of hot gas , but they do indicate that hot gas molecules are present in the diffuse medium . thus , the different temperature values of component a indicate cold , photoionised gas . if component a gas atoms happen to be in equilibrium or collisional thermal equilibrium ( cie ) ,the @ xmath96 ( c @ xmath4roman4 ) / @ xmath96 ( c @ xmath4roman4 ) and @ xmath96 ( c @ xmath4roman4 ) / @ xmath96 ( si @ xmath4roman3 ) crystal structure analysis ( as for all species , for these examples , see figure [ tab : cldnlist0064 ] ) would yield a higher resolution @ xmath138 km ( smith & dopita 1993 ) . but the c @ xmath4roman4 structure of @ xmath139 km s @ xmath28 is highly unstable . to illustrate this , figure [ tab : civ064 ] shows an inverted representation of the c @ xmath4roman4 structure . we see that the @ xmath139 km s @ xmath28 is not equivalent to the stis e140 ##8 resolution of @ xmath140 km s @ xmath28 . voigt structure analysis for this structure also yields @ xmath141 , which is much lower than the @ xmath77valuemeasured using the cie method , i . e . , @ xmath142 km s @ xmath28 . the second component at @ xmath143 km s @ xmath28 is smaller ( see figure [ fig : civ064 ] ) , and the @ xmath96 ( si @ xmath4roman4 ) / @ xmath96 ( si @ xmath4roman4 ) and @ xmath96 ( si @ xmath4roman4 ) / @ xmath96 ( si @ xmath4roman3 ) distances are similar for the distances s @ xmath144 and 1 km s @ xmath28 , and we expect the transition energies and transition times to be similar for both components . however , the ions photoionised against the infrared light from qsos are not consistent with the observed s @ xmath4roman3 , c @ xmath4roman4 , and c @ xmath4roman4 ion ##isation ( and the limits for these ions ) . @ xmath13 = 0 . 06352 . figure [ fig : cloudym ] shows thethe metal column is predicted by these models ( small symbols compared with metal columns ) with h @ xmath96 ( log @ xmath4roman1 ) = 0 . 5 and [ c / n ] = @ xmath145 compared to the metal column models ( large symbols ) . we can assume that the metal column dynamics are in equilibrium ( in the log @ xmath146 temperature range ) with this model with h @ xmath147 ( log @ xmath148 ) . the component h @ xmath4roman1 and h @ xmath4roman4 located at this point could only arise in shock - heated gas if they arise in gas that is already in liquid state . several models have predicted the possibility of gas that is already shock - heated to a critical temperature and then cooled more rapidly than it can handle ( e . g . , shapiro & moore 1976 ; shapiro & wilson 1986 ) . however , if such large metal columns were to arise in gas in such a way , according to the models from shapiro & moore ( 1996 ) and schmutzler & tscharnuter ( 1992 ) , the @ xmath##96 ( c @ xmath4roman3 ) / @ xmath96 ( o @ xmath4roman4 ) column density ratio would imply a transition temperature similar ( @ xmath138 k ) to the one proposed for the collisional non equilibrium scenario . however , at higher temperatures , the theoretical 10 @ xmath4roman6 column density at this temperature is much higher than our theoretical upper bound ( @ xmath445 or higher in the schmutzler model ) . thus , the @ xmath96 ( o @ xmath4roman4 ) / @ xmath96 ( o @ xmath4roman4 ) column density ratio has an even higher value than 10 @ xmath149 k ( 1 . 5 or higherr in the shapiro model ) . because of these assumptions , this non - equilibrium noble gas transition is expected to lead to the @ xmath113 shift toward 0624 . the shapiro model makes many other theoretical assumptions in addition to the general assumption that the molecule is photoionised . for example , the photoionisation model assumes that the molecule has a very high metallicity of @ xmath15##0 even though we have observed no luminous galaxies on @ xmath151 . a similar low metallicity ( [ o / h ] @ xmath152 ) was also found by jenkins et al . ( 2005 ) for the lls in the system of phl1811 , but that system is much closer in distance to a luminous galaxy . if we derive the more precise upper limit on @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) from the measurement of the lyman window on ( @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) @ xmath153 , see also [ source : lls _ rutr ] ) instead of the speed - of - light on @ xmath4roman1 itself , we have [ o / h ] @ xmath154 . this upper limit is also much lower than metallicities commonly seen in infrared galaxies of higher masses ( e . g . , schaye et al . 2003 ) and is similar to those observed in high - mass galaxies in the milky way ( e . g . , sembach et al . 2001 , 2004 ; smith , shull , & giroux 2003 ; trippet al . 2003 ; ganguly et al . 2005 ; singh et al . 2005 ) . to determine confidence limits for parameters derived from our theoretical models , for example of metallicity @ xmath155 and density parameter @ xmath110 we use the @ xmath156 parameter , @ xmath157 where @ xmath96 is the density and the sum ##mation of the density parameters b @ xmath4roman3 , d @ xmath4roman4 , and e @ xmath4roman4 . with the parameters @ xmath156 derived from [ m / h ] = @ xmath145 and maximum @ xmath158 , we calculate confidence levels , with values that give @ xmath159 ##6 the values expected for a given confidence level ( see lampton , margon , & bowyer 1976 ; fox et al . 1992 ) . in this case , we find [ m / h ] = @ xmath160 at the maximum @ xmath146 confidence level . of course , these confidence levels do not always address the sources of the uncertainty such as uncertainty about the nature of the magnetic field , and theof the cloudy data converted into light . when we used the standard galactic disk model ( e . g . madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ; shull et al . 1999 ) , the results were more consistent with the cloudy data for a higher metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @ xmath161 and a lower absorption parameter than @ xmath162 . we can also put constraints on physical properties such as the particle size ( the size of the particle in the surrounding medium ) and the effective electron density ( also see the section in chapter 2 of tripp et al . ) [ fig : absorbersize ] shows the level allowed for the particle size @ xmath163 and the pressure @ xmath164 divided by the photoionisation parameter . the best estimate is that @ xmath165 1 . 5 kpc . if so , the baryonic mass of this particle would be @ xmath166 . however , we can see from figure [ fig : absorbersize ] that the limit covers a wide range for @ xmath163 to the maximum @ xmath146 value . the high thermal pressure limit is also considered . when theand the spiral spiral galaxy . for the second case , the derived pressure is increased by a factor of . 5 and the background size corresponds to @ xmath1678 kpc . the range of pressures in the universe in question [ sec : absorbersize ] is several orders of magnitude lower than the derived pressure measured in the center of the milky way ( see jenkins & tripp 2001 ) and perhaps even lower than pressures measured for hvcs in the milky way disk ( e . g . wakker , oosterloo , & putman 2002 ; smith et al . . ) , sembach et al . ( 1995 , 1999 ) and higher pressures for civ hvcs in the milky - way with a higher metallicity . however , if this results are true in most current models of galactic evolution ( wolfire et al . ) , the derived pressure depends on the model used to model the background radiation field ( see tripp et al . 2005 ) and both the background size and the pressure could be higher if the radiation field is greater than we expected . as stated in [ sec : pressure ] , the spectral lines measured at @ xmath13 = 0 . 07573 k in a non -secondary lines similar to a559 and a564 . the h @ xmath4roman1 ly @ xmath16 , ly @ xmath39 and the h @ xmath4roman4 @ xmath681548 . 5 , 1550 . 5 lines are also visible at this point ; the strengths of these three lines are shown in figure [ fig : syst0076 ] . the strength of ly @ xmath39 and the strength of ly @ xmath79 indicates that the h @ xmath4roman1 lines are not significantly affected by the interactions , and the resulting results are consistent . however , that of the h @ xmath4roman4 @ ar ##ar ##g shows no evidence of electron capture . we have matched these lines with only one electron . the results of the experiment are shown in figure [ fig : cldnlist076 ] . the presence of the h @ xmath4roman1 line ( @ xmath169 ) indicates a temperature for the sample higher than @ xmath170 ##8 , which strongly suggests a photoionisation event . the h @ x##math4roman6 is expected at this point , but several other spectral lines of heavier elements are very close to the normal range of the c @ xmath4roman6 line , and these lines may be the c @ xmath4roman6 lines . despite the fact that c @ xmath4roman4 is the only element found in this region , we can still find an approximate upper limit on the expected metallicity . the atomic number can be calculated as [ c / h ] = log [ / ] + log [ / ] - log ( c / h ) @ xmath171 , where and are the relative concentrations of c @ xmath4roman1 and o @ xmath4roman4 , respectively . . the range is not shown in figure [ fig : cloudym ] because there is actually a higher abundance of @ xmath110 than the expected [ . ] . with the c @ xmath4roman1 drawn from the ly @ xmath16 + ly @ xmath39 column ( figure [ fig : cldnlist076 ] ) , and , assuming that the metal is photoionised in the cellquoting from qsos ( haardt & madau 1996 ) , we found that [ [ / ] @ xmath172 , and < @ xmath173 > - 0 . 1 $ ] is the limit . once again , this metallicity upper bound is very high given the fact that no other objects have been observed beyond the red dwarf ( the nearest object is nw3 ##c @ xmath174 kpc , see below [ source : bright _ star ] ) . @ c @ c @ c @ c @ c @ c @ & & & & & + & & & & & & ##4 & 1215 . 670 & 309 @ xmath8410 & 13 . 05 @ xmath840 . 04 & 14 . 05 @ xmath841 . 02 & 15 . 06 @ xmath840 . 03 + & 1025 . 722 & 108 @ xmath8421 & & & 0 . 10 @ xmath840 . 08 + c vi & 1037 . 617 & & @ xmath8419 & & & @ xmath175 + c vi & 1548 . 204 & & @ xmath84 + & 0 . 10 @xmath840 . 04 & 13 . 1 @ xmath841 . 02 & 13 . 2 @ xmath840 . 04 + & 1550 . 781 & & @ xmath84 8 & & & 13 . 09 @ xmath840 . 04 + si iii & 1206 . 1 & & @ xmath8410 & & & @ xmath176 + si iii & 1393 . 760 & & @ xmath8414 & & & @ xmath124 + si iii & 1238 . 821 & & @ xmath84 9 & & & @ xmath177 ##8 [ fig : 2 ] we find that the clusters a554 , a562 , and a565 indicate that the large - scale cluster / supercluster is close to 0624 . our current cluster search has also found two clusters close to 0624 in the vicinity of the abell 554 / 562 / 565 cluster ( see table [ fig : 1 ] and table [ fig : 2 _ 1 ] ) , which indicates that the large - scale cluster is in the 0624 region . therefore , we haveand a number of weak ly @ xmath16 lines in the center of this structure at and slightly away from those of the young and abell galaxies . it is possible that the ly @ xmath16 lines are weak / weak because the gas in the structure is so dense that the at @ xmath4roman1 # ##ization makes the ly @ xmath16 lines weak , and we also know that the young galaxies are farther from the sight line in this structure ( @ xmath179 mpc ) than between the structure at @ xmath180 and the cluster , and it is also possible that the sight line does not reach the interior of the dark matter region where the gas is dense enough to contain gas and dust ( see also : bowen et al . how are the spectra of the ly @ xmath16 lines weak , , and compared to the strong ly @ xmath16 lines in the 0624 structure ( and near the sight line ) ? we have shown that the lines , and are in photoionised gas regions ; is this representative of the spectra of the ly @ xmath16 lines in the spectrum ? .specifically , do we have ly @ xmath16 lines that occur in these regions ? richter et al . ( 2004 , 2005 ) and sembach et al . ( 2004 ) have also found a mixture of the ly @ xmath16 lines ( blas ) with @ xmath181 , and with @ xmath28 in the spectra of four h @ xmath0 qsos ( pg0953 + 415 , pg1116 + 215 , pg1259 + 593 , and h1821 + 643 ) . williger et al . ( 2005 ) also found a large population of blas in the spectra of pks0405 - 123 . bowen et al . ( 2002 ) have also identified several bla lines from their higher energy simulations . if these lines are not affected by stellar winds , then they contain the cold - core hydrogen , and therefore , they in this case would contain a large portion of the hydrogen in the universe at the present time ( see richter et al . 2004 , 2005 ; sembach et al . 2004 ) . based on simulations , richter et al . ( 2005 ) and williger et al . ( 2005 ) found that most of the blas are broadnot thermal broken but rather smooth due to line breaks that are difficult to detect in the s / n lines by the stis echelle method . however , richter et al . ( 2005 ) report that about 10 per cent of the blas are not thermal broken , and the remaining s / n lines in the above table are very straight and smooth and appear to closely coincide with a sight line ##ening ( see , e . g . , pages 4 and 5 of richter et al . 2005 ) . in this paper , in addition to using a single sight line , we have developed methods that are different from ( e . g . , using proprietary software ) the methods described in the papers used for line detection , edge detection , and spectral analysis . therefore , we have the opportunity to further develop the bla methods described in these papers . for the 0624 sight line , we find that the mean @ xmath77value for the ly @ xmath16 lines is @ xmath182 = 2 @ s @ xmath28 , and the mean @ xmath183 = s @ xmath28 . however , as shown in the [ ref : lyalist ] , most of thely @ xmath16 measurements are much shorter , and the line lengths are highly variable . if we compare these line - lengths , we have @ xmath184 km s @ xmath28 and @ xmath185 km s @ xmath28 . these two @ xmath77values are in perfect agreement with the very high - resolution ly @ xmath16 measurements . in figure [ fig : larg ] we compare our measurements of the maximum @ xmath4roman1 @ xmath77values and the data from figure [ fig : lyalist ] to the measurements made by richter et al . ( 2004 ) and sembach et al . the solid line indicates @ xmath83 h . @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) for a normal distribution with an average q = 0 . 05 . this is not a rounding error ; measurements that have ( @ xmath186 ) located to the right of this line are more likely to be detected . the solid line in figure [ fig : larg ] indicates the maximum @ xmath77value as a function of @ xmath##96 ( for @ xmath4roman1 ) obtained by dav & tripp ( 2001 , see their figure below ) from the numerical computer simulations of dav et al . this observed upper envelope appears to be in broad agreement with the observed lower envelope for the two sight lines shown in the figure . from table [ 1 : larg ] , we see that the ( @ xmath186 ) spectrum that we have obtained from the 0624 sight line appears to be very similar to those obtained by sembach et al . ( 2004 ) and richter et al . sembach et al . and richter et al . also found more very broad ly @ xmath16 ##0 ( @ xmath181 million km s @ xmath28 ) than we have been able to previously detect in the 0624 spectrum . this may be partly due to signal - to - noise . the methods used by richter et al . and sembach et al . have achieved h / z because the sharp and sharp lines are harder to detect in the 0624 spectrum . for @ xmath187 km s @ xmath28 , the two sight lines appear to be in broad agreement . sight lines at 5000km s @ xmath28 of the qso and , of the qso , can result in broad lines masked by the qso , and these lines can be very complex ( see , e . g . , richter et al . 2002 ) , even if not part of a large - scale strong absorption line model . ] the 0624 method can be used to look for blas in @ xmath188 and @ xmath189 . looking for regions in which broad lines could have been masked by the weak absorption lines , we obtain a temperature - dependent weak absorption line @ xmath190 . with the ly @ xmath16 ##2 for the region with @ xmath181 and km s @ xmath28 , we can obtain @ xmath191 ( bla ) = 2 @ xmath8416 . this is much lower than the values obtained by sembach et al . ( 2004 ) and richter et al . ( 2004 , 2005 ) . however , richter et al . have excluded blas that are present in thermal regions on the grounds that these lines are more likely to be caused by non - thermal processes . if we use thethis way , we would have 11 blas ( see figure [ 1 : lyalist ] ) ; the remaining 11 blas would then be @ xmath191 ( bla ) = 0 @ xmath8410 . using figures 4 , 5 , and 6 from sembach et al . ( 2004 ) , and accounting for the many different statistical models used in this study , we conclude that our statistical model indicates that the bla baryonic content is @ xmath192 ( bla ) = 0 . 017 @ xmath7 ( in the classical sense , i . e . , @ xmath193 ) . this latter value also significantly increases the bla baryonic content , possibly because of the blas that arise from it . if we have blas that are located in outer space , this reduces to @ xmath192 ( bla ) = 0 . 0036 @ xmath7 , which is equivalent to that given by richter et al . and sembach et al . the values of @ xmath192 ( bla ) relate to , e . g . , distances that are not due to gravity and the non -these # ##s , although small and very difficult to measure ( see references by richter et al . ) , these new observations suggest that blas may be an ancient population of galaxies . with these infrared observations , it would be possible to obtain high - resolution images with much higher k / h in order to better understand the baryonic abundance of blas as part of the general distribution of dark matter in the early universe . we need more detailed information on the structure , boundary conditions , and the evolution of absorption systems in the direction of 0624 . what are the implications of these measurements for the study of galaxy formation and evolution ? the processes that add matter to galaxies ( e . g . gravity ) and remove it from them ( e . g . , radiation , gravitational waves ) can have profound effects on galaxy evolution , and the ` ` transfer ' ' of matter and energy from galaxies into the universe is also likely to play an important role in the galaxies that eventually fall out of the universe ( voit s . a . , 2005 ) . the nature and significance of the @ xmath194 - 2 measurements are a matter of great interest here . the structure and absorption systems in the direction of 0624, and the galaxy group and ly @ xmath16 ##0 , @ xmath75 = , have provided important , and very important , data for these groups , which we now have . rosat studies of young x - ray galaxies have shown that galaxy groups that are dominated by g - type galaxies may contain diffuse , hot background gas ( mulchaey 2000 , and others below ) . based on the observed relationship between background gas density and velocity at @ xmath146 for x - ray disk galaxies ( @ xmath195 ) and the fact that spiral - rich groups have greater velocity variations than elliptical - rich groups , mulchaey et al . ( 1996 ) have suggested that spiral - rich groups may contain much cooler background gas that could give rise to qso emission lines at higher temperatures ( e . g . , at @ xmath4roman6 ) . however , the galaxy group at @ xmath75 = appears to have properties that are neither consistent with the elliptical - rich groups associated with rosat nor with the fact that spiral - rich groups contain diffuse - hot background gas . it is unclear if the galaxy group at @ xmath75= is a late - type galaxy . < [ ref : galpics ] > @ xmath45 ##0 from the mosa survey of the 10 galaxies that we have observed in this group . all of the galaxies in the group show signs of folds and fractures ( both from the distance observations and from the brightness measurements ) . we know from closer observations that 4 - 5 of the 10 galaxies show signs of this structure ( sw3 , se1 , se8 , se6 , and possibly se4 ) . however , the other 5 could be late - type s0 galaxies , and thus the late - type classification should be restricted to those that have strong x - ray emission ( see , e . g , table 1 , zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) . the ne3 , se13 , and se5 galaxies , which all appear to be early - type galaxies , have lines and shapes consistent with the ` ` brown dwarf ' ' magnitude - magnitude relationships described in nature ( e . g . , smith , lucey , & smith 1992 ; smith et al . 2005 ) ; these galaxies are early s0s ( the other 5 galaxies have faint lines indicative of later types ) . the brightness profiles of the galaxies in @xmath75 = , albeit smaller , are more similar to those of electron - dominated groups than electron - dominated groups ( mulchaey et al . 1996 ; zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) . regardless of whether the gas is proton - or electron - dominated , it is expected that we find a large number of small , photoionised molecules in the gas medium ( [ ss : z064 ] ) . in the warm gas medium of the electron - dominated group , h @ xmath4roman1 lines should be very narrow and weak , but instead we find broad , diffuse lines ( see also [ ss : hi00635 ] ) . even in the warm gas known to be present in non - elliptical dominated groups , the h @ xmath4roman1 lines should be strong . we could use models of inside the gas , and in these models h @ xmath4roman6 is predicted to be smaller . however , if the gas medium is a gas , with molecular bonds ( which are the h @ xmath4roman1 absorption lines ) present in the gas molecules , then we would expect to see h @ xmath4roman6 from theand all the galaxies ( smith et al . 2005 ) , unless it is significantly disrupted . the lack of evidence of hot gas leads us to question whether this group is a massive , virialized group . an alternative explanation is that our sight line is along the long axis of a large - scale filamentary structure in the galactic plane . in this case , the position of the l and ly @ xmath16 clusters along the sight line could give a clear picture of the direction in which hot gas would be traveling . however , in our models of large - scale galaxies , hot gas is unlikely to be present in the entire group , even in high - overdensity clusters ( see , e . g . , table 1 , cen & ostriker 1999b ) , so it is unlikely that we find a large cluster of such gas at @ xmath12 , quite contrary to our predictions . as mentioned above , our models do not show the presence of hot gas at @ xmath12 , but we have no direct evidence of it . other sight lines show large clusters of ly @ xmath16 gas , e . g . , the ly @ xmath16 cloud at @xmath196 0 . 057 toward pks2155 - 304 ( shull et al . 1998 ; shull , tumlinson , & giroux 2003 ) and the ly @ xmath16 complex at @ xmath196 0 . 121 toward h1821 + 643 ( tripp et al . ) , in the 0624 ly @ xmath16 complex , the pks2155 - 304 and h1821 + 643 lines also show traces of red - orange neutral hydrogen . to determine whether the data and models are in agreement , it would be useful to include the chemical and physical properties of these ly @ xmath16 systems in the data for comparison with the data . it is also known that the two systems for which we have obtained the data ( at @ xmath75 = and ) both have very high metallicities , and both of these systems are at least 10 kpc ##s ( orbital distance ) from the nearest active galaxy . this also raises the question : how can gas that is so distant from the galaxy have such a high metallicity ? the gas could have been blown out of the galaxy by a stellar wind ; some theoretical models suggest that the ejected gasthey have a high metallicity ( # ##farlane & wilson 1999 ) , the problem with this explanation is that material from nearby galaxies are often found to contain large amounts of hydrogen gas ( e . g . , lu et al . 2004 ) , which appears to be consistent with the range of properties that we have observed . a more likely explanation is that the high - metallicity gas we have observed from galaxies has been tidally stripped out of some of the nearby galaxies . there are indications that tidal stripping could be a more efficient method for removing gas from galaxies , and the tidally stripped material could therefore more easily match the observed low - ion properties of the gas . for example , in the case of ngc3783 , the galaxy high - ion cloud ( hvc ) ( @ xmath197 247 is now thought to be tidally stripped away from the smc . while this tidally stripped material has a wide range of high - ion ##isation properties , but has little or no observed high - ion properties ( lu et al . 1994 ; sembach et al . ) , the tidally - stripped hvc contains some gas , which sembach et al . believe originated in the smc and escaped the effects of tidal stripping ( luclose to ( in situ in the sky ) . both the presence of high temperatures and the presence of the @ xmath80 suggest that the stripping process did not completely damage and destroy this hvc . these galaxies are close enough to the 0624 sight line to be possible sources of the gas from the tidal stripping process . one of the nearby galaxies , se1 , has a typical elliptical shape . this galaxy is a possible source of tidally generated gas . we have discovered a number of sight - line galaxies in the direction of 0624 using a combination of high - resolution infrared spectroscopy obtained with _ hst _ / stis and the ground - based observation and spectroscopy of galaxies at @ xmath4430 of the sight line . in addition to all the above data and other data , we have published the following results : \ } . there are several abell galaxy clusters in the direction of 0624 , including two clusters at @ xmath12 0 . 077 ( a559 and a564 ) and three at @ xmath12 0 . 08 ( a554 , a562 , and a565 ) . these clusters contain large - scale dark matter particles , i . e . , superclusters ( fi##laments of the ` ` dark gas ' ' . our galaxy cluster survey has found galaxies at these supercluster distances in the immediate vicinity of the 0624 spectral line , and so our qso will provide an opportunity to study the structure of large - scale gas clusters . the most likely group of galaxies identified in our galaxy group at is at @ xmath12 and is usually associated with the abell group with a high distance from the sun . however , a557 , for which no such group has been found , is at least likely belonging to the galaxy group at @ xmath12 . the two strong ly @ xmath16 absorption lines at @ xmath198 come from the groups at @ xmath199 and . the ly @ xmath16 absorption line is particularly strong : at this distance , we find the ly @ xmath16 line extending from a velocity range of 300 km s @ xmath28 with a line - of - sight velocity range of 265 km s @ xmath28 . the second - strongest group at is associated with the abell 559 / 06##4 large - scale gas , and this means that this complex of gas and dust fits into the abell 559 / 564 supercluster . analysis of the ly @ xmath16 co - emission system at @ xmath200 provides strong evidence that the gas is photoionised and very dense ; we find no other evidence of red - white mixing in this large - scale gas . we find a @ xmath4roman3 , b @ xmath4roman4 , and c @ xmath4roman4 as the main components of this ly @ xmath16 system , and photoionisation measurements show that the total metallicity is low , [ m / h ] = @ xmath201 . this is not surprising because we do not find any other galaxies close to the galactic line ; the nearest one is probably the nearby c @ xmath202 kpc . the ly @ xmath16 system itself is not contained in the c @ xmath4roman4 system , but instead we find a similar situation : the lower limit of the metallicity is very high ( [ m / h ] @ xmath14 ) and the upper limitlocated at @ xmath203 kpc . we have compared the values of ly @ xmath16 phase shift and h @ xmath4roman1 line parameters to high - resolution data obtained from the broad line , and we report similar results . we find that the distribution of broad ly @ xmath16 lines with @ xmath181 / 2 and @ xmath28 per unit area is in agreement with those lines found by richter et al . ( 2004 , 2005 ) and sembach et al . the baryonic nature of these broad h @ xmath4roman1 lines is still highly uncertain and requires models with high m / n ratios , but it is clear that some of these broad lines come from warm - hot gas and represent an important part of the matter in the early universe . we also find that the upper limit of @ xmath83 vs . @ xmath96 ( h @ xmath4roman1 ) is in agreement with results from numerical models . the presence of warm - hot gas in the h ##y / ly @ xmath16 line with @ xmath200 is difficult to confirm withx - ray spectroscopy of active galaxy clusters . it is very likely that this in this case we are observing a large - scale cosmic ray galaxy on a long baseline . the cluster contains a number of early - and late - bound galaxies and some hot , photoionised gas . the high - metallicity , hot gas l @ xmath13 = 0 . 06352 is a tidally bound material . this material may explain the high metallicity and the presence of hot gas . one of the bound galaxies has a peculiar structure associated with this material . several clusters of ly @ xmath16 galaxies have been found in the other galaxies , and more clusters are likely to be found as we continue to collect stis data . we look forward to comparison of these data to data from numerical simulations and other scientific studies in order to better understand the mechanisms that govern the formation of galaxies and the galactic medium . we thank dan smith and neal katz for our support . the stis observations of hs0624 + 6907 were selected for _ hst _ # 9184 with technical support from nasa and hst ##1 -
