as in our previous results of run 1a and @ xcite , we perform a systematic search for new particles with a new band structure that correspond to dijets . in particular , we search for the following particles shown in fig . [ 1 _ 1 ] : axigluons @ xcite from chiral atoms ( @ xmath7 ) , new particles @ xcite of new electrons ( @ xmath8 ) , new exotic technirhos @ xcite ( @ xmath9 ) , new exotic nuclei ( @ xmath10 , @ xmath11 ) , and new @ xmath12 diquarks @ xcite ( @ xmath13 and @ xmath14 ) . using the results from run 1a and 1b , we find dijet mass values with the dimensions of 200 gev / c @ xmath1 , 241 gev / c @ xmath1 , 292 gev / c @ xmath1 , and 388 gev / c @ xmath1 with the dimensions of = 5 . 5 in = 5 . 5 in = 5 . 5 in . 089 ##p @ xmath0 , p . 10 # @xmath0 , 69 . 8 p @ xmath0 , and 69 . 8 p @ xmath0 % . they are labeled with a small plane wave number ( n = 0 . 5 ) and are analyzed for background noise , energy levels in the sample , and the temperature . we compare the two new @ xmath15 cuts and find that they have pseudorapidity @ xmath16 and a small phase difference @ xmath17 | < / / [ $ ] . the @ xmath18 cut has constant energy as a function of time and reflects the energy background which occurs at @ xmath19 . in fig . [ fig _ dijet ] the dijet energy spectrum is represented as a 2d cross section in terms of the mass distribution ( @ xmath20 % ) . at constant energy the result is much better than the result from experiments in the cdf - system , compared to the result of @ xmath21 and @ xcite . to check for new parameters we estimate the energy spectrum by fitting the data to a linear combination of the parameters @ xcite ; fig . [ fig _ dijet ] . the significant difference between the data and the model( @ xmath22 ) . we observe mass resolutions of 50 gev / c @ xmath1 ( @ xmath23 ) , 550 gev / c @ xmath1 ( @ xmath24 ) and 850 gev / c @ xmath1 ( @ xmath25 ) . for narrow resonance it is possible to measure the mass resolution for only one type of elementary particle because the mass resolution affects the rest . in fig . [ fig _ resonance ] we display the mass resolution for excited states ( * * ) from experiments with the cdf detector system ; the mass resolution for low energies measurements from optical detectors . for the measurement of the observed resolution of 550 gev / c @ xmath1 measurements , we have a weighted maximum likelihood fit of the measurement to the observed parameterization and the narrow resonance ##s . in fig . [ fig _ resonance ] we have the best fit and 95 % confidence level upper bound for the 550 gev / c @ xmath1 measurement . for the energy resolution @ xmath26 gev / c @ xmath1 , there are 2947 events in the region , @ xmath27 events ( @ xmath28) is the background for the fit without the resonance , @ xmath29 ##p ( @ xmath30 ) is the background for the fit that includes the resonance , and the estimate of the decay cross section from the likelihood , @ xmath31 # ( p ) . in fig . [ fig _ limit ] we obtain the angular distribution of the decay in the resonance , @ xmath26 gev / n @ xmath1 . the angular distribution is consistent with the models above , and with = 3 . 3 in = 3 . 3 in = + 5 % of the ( mass fit ) . this number of new particles is about the same as that in the mass fit . although the variance is significant , we find it is not at = 3 . 3 in = 3 . 3 non - zero , and compare to the data for new particle sizes . = 3 . 3 in = 3 . 3 in from the likelihood , from the likelihood , @ xcite we obtain the 5 % of ##utter ##ance , the cross section for excited particles , in fig . [ fig _ dijet _ limit ] . we compare this to the cross section for axigluons ( ( @ xmath32gev / c @ xmath1 ) , 3 states ( excluding @ xmath33 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , technirhos ( excluding @ xmath34 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , c @ xmath35 ( excluding @ xmath36 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , c @ xmath35 ( excluding @ xmath37 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , and e6 diquarks ( excluding @ xmath38 gev / c @ xmath1 ) . the others are high energy @ xcite , cteq2l parton , @ xcite and closed - state @ xmath39 and c @ xmath16 and @ xmath40 . the large mass of the # ##color suggests that the third generation may be present . topcolor @ xcite suggests that the effective mass is large , because of the new @ xmath5 coupling followed by a new molecular orbital added to the third generation . however the @ xmath41 of interest has a higher energy state resulting from the addition of the @ xmath42 coupling to the third generation andthe @ xmath43 coupling to the other channels occurs first . there are three - dimensional phase transitions , topgluons @ xmath44 , which couples largely to @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 . the topgluon is electronically produced and leads mainly to the third generation ( @ xmath45 ) with a very narrow natural width ( @ xmath46 ) . here we search for the topgluon in the @ xmath4 channel . an additional @ xmath47 channel is used @ xcite to produce the @ xmath48 # ##s . the # ##color is used ; this leads to the topcolor @ xmath6 , which also couples largely to @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 . the topcolor @ xmath6 is electroweakly produced and leads mainly to the fourth generation ( @ xmath49 ) with a narrow natural width ( @ xmath50 ) . here we search for the topcolor @ xmath6 in both the the @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 channels ; the @ xmath5 channel is the most massive because the coupling to @ xmath##5 is correct . we start with the dijet search at 100 % @ xmath0 of run 1a of @ xcite and we expect at least one of the two jets to be identified as a bottom jet . the b - tag is a hidden tag in the the bottom jet of @ xcite . the @ xmath4 tag estimate is @ xmath51 % % of dijet search . from comparison to the @ xmath52 % , we estimate that the sample contains about 80 % charm , 20 % charm , and 10 % mistags of bottom jets . this estimates that 2 / 3 of these bottom jets are direct @ xmath4 , and the rest are from beta decay and weak interaction . therefore , at least @ xmath53 % @ xmath54 % % of our sample is indirect @ xmath4 . we expect both the size and abundance to increase when we use the run 1b dataset and the charm tag algorithm @ xcite . with this tag efficiency we should be able to make better use of the b - tag data than the data described above . [ x _ btag _ tag ] . = 1 . 0 .= 1 . so in the fig . [ fig _ btag ] we have the b - tagged dijet mass distribution calculated for the @ xmath4 effect . now there is the same dijet mass distribution from fig 1a , and they are well matched with our new parameterization @ xcite . the b - tagged dijet data shows an energy resolution of 600 gev / c @ xmath1 . we get the effect of the narrow resonance of the ##s @ xmath3 , and the cdf ##d system . in fig . [ fig _ btag ] we match the b - tagged data to the 600 gev / c @ xmath1 narrow resonance , and get the cross correlation of @ xmath55 effect ( 1 ) . note that this is similar to the dijet data in both energy and structure . however , there are only four atoms in the first two data points of fig . [ fig _ btag ] , and the effect is not the @ xmath56 effect , so we have to look up for the energy levels . we have two sets of calculations for the data . first , the energies are found as shown above , and the energy levels .the cdf detector is shown in fig . [ fig _ b _ bbar _ res ] . here , the mass characteristic of topgluons @ xcite , including those with the resonance , are incorporated into the and the cdf detector models . the mass level in fig . [ fig _ b _ bbar _ res ] shows constructive interference to the left of the resonance ; experiments with constructive interference to the right side of the resonance can be shown in the fig . = 3 . 2 , = 3 . 3 . results for the mass levels are shown in fig . [ fig _ btag _ res ] . the production cross sections are in order and have cteq2l parton symmetry . for some regions the production cross sections are not large enough for us to calculate mass levels at this level . for topgluons the production cross sections @ xcite are large , and we are able to calculate the 1 % of topgluons of interest @ xmath57 for the same region @ xmath58 gev / c @ xmath1 , @ xmath59 for @ xmath60 gev / c @ xmath1 , and @ xmath61 for @ xmat##h62 gev / c @ xmath1 . = 4 . 0 in = 4 . 0 in = 0 . 0 . to look for the data related to @ xmath5 we started with the data obtained from the top mass of @ xcite . here we compared the data to four + 1 events with at least one z - value , and then four events with a value of @ xmath63 , resulting in a top mass of @ xmath64 ( stat ) @ xmath65 ( sys ) gev / c @ xmath1 . that sample uses the same sample for the top mass , as those with @ xmath66 ( standard deviation ) . then we add the additional result that the top mass is 176 gev / c @ xmath1 , which significantly increases our estimate of the @ xmath5 mass . 17 of the 17 events pass the @ xmath66 test when the top mass value is added to the sample , leaving us with 17 events . the @ xmath5 mass as obtained from a given sample , corresponding to the topcolor @ xmath6 ##3 . @ xcite , is shown in bold . [ # _ ttbar] . next we present the @ xmath67 . also in fig . [ fig _ ttbar ] , the monte carlo simulation of the sample , on the total standard model mass production from herwig , and on the combined of 1 + 1 showers from vecbos with parton showers from herwig . the monte carlo is a cdf model system . on the right in fig . [ fig _ ttbar ] , the comparison of the topcolor z @ xmath3 to z @ xmath5 data shows that in this small region we are able to topcolor @ xmath6 ##8 to a value of about 600 gev / c @ xmath1 . finally , on the right in fig . [ fig _ ttbar ] , we present the @ xmath5 observed mass distribution from cdf simulations to the total standard model production . from the data the result is very good indeed . the upper bound of 100 % of the mass of @ xmath68 in the sample @ xmath69 gev / c @ xmath1 is quite an interesting mass distribution , given the dijet and @ xmath4 experimental data , but is not very precise . the bounds on the@ xmath5 channel ( as a model of @ xmath5 ) , and as of topcolor @ xmath6 , is still in progress . = 3 . 1 in = 3 . 1 , we started searches for the channels corresponding to dijets , @ xmath4 , and @ xmath5 . in the dijet ##s we found the most important # ##ivity data to be : the hadronic mass of axigluons ( excluding @ xmath70 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , the electron ( excluding @ xmath71 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , technirhos ( excluding @ xmath34 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , c @ xmath3 ( excluding @ xmath36 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , w @ xmath35 ( excluding @ xmath37 gev / c @ xmath1 ) , and for the first time e6 diquarks ( excluding @ xmath38 gev / c @ xmath1 ) . in the @ xmath4 channel we found the first version of topcolor , as a modelof topgluons for the @ xmath57 and the values of @ xmath58 gev / c @ xmath1 , @ xmath59 for @ xmath60 gev / c @ xmath1 , and @ xmath61 for @ xmath62 gev / c @ xmath1 . the search for topcolor in the @ xmath5 region has already begun and limits are in place . limits are only a concern here ; the main goal of our search is to explore the possibility of another universe . although we do not have direct evidence for any physical interactions , the @ xmath72 gev / c @ xmath1 region shows upward fluctuations in all three channels . we must not ignore the intriguing possibility that these three upward fluctuations may be the first signs of a new universe in the standard model . the new peak measured for channel 1b , now being measured and studied , has the potential to either explain the phenomenon or reveal what may be the most likely new universe in our galaxy . + s . abe et al .
