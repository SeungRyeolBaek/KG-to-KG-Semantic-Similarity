we can consider simple and complex graphs . let @ xmath1 be a graph with vertex set @ xmath4 and edge set @ xmath5 . a perfect matching or self - coloring @ xmath0 of a graph @ xmath1 is a subset of edges of @ xmath1 such that each edge of @ xmath1 is incident with exactly one edge of @ xmath0 . the kekul structure of certain molecular structures ( for example , diamond and diamond ) starts with a perfect matching of this graph . randi and others @ xcite studied the _ _ number of _ _ of the kekul structure , i . e . the maximum number of hydrogen bonds that form this particular molecular structure , and it is called the forcing number of harary et al . @ xcite . the _ forcing number _ @ xmath6 of a perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath1 is a subset of @ xmath0 such that @ xmath6 is incident with all other perfect matchings of @ xmath1 . the _ forcing number _ of @ xmath0 is the forcing set of all forcing ##s of @ xmat##h0 , denoted by @ xmath7 . an element of @ xmath1 is called a _ _ _ _ if it is contained in exactly one perfect matching of @ xmath1 . the _ _ _ _ ( _ ) _ forcing number _ of @ xmath1 is the minimum ( resp . maximum ) value of the set of all perfect matchings of @ xmath1 , denoted by @ xmath8 ( resp . @ xmath9 ) . in order to find the maximum forcing number of a graph with the maximum value of is an np - complete problem @ xcite . let @ xmath0 be a perfect matching of a subset @ xmath1 . a subset @ xmath10 of @ xmath1 is called a _ @ xmath0 - alternating cycle _ if the edges of @ xmath10 occur both in @ xmath0 and @ xmath11 . @ xcite [ 2 ] a subset @ xmath12 is a perfect matching of @ xmath0 if and only if every @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 contains at least one edge of @ xmath6 . for a subset##partite ##l , pachter and kim published the first minimax algorithm , with lucchesi and colleagues . based on : @ xcite .

[ 1 ] let @ xmath1 be the graph with the highest degree @ xmath19 . for any perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath1 , we have @ xmath24 for any anti - forcing set @ xmath6 of @ xmath0 . for any edge @ xmath25 of @ xmath6 , let @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 be the edges of @ xmath0 corresponding to @ xmath25 . all other edges @ xmath25 and @ xmath6 are matched with edges of @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 toconsider the set @ xmath28 of edges of @ xmath0 . it is known that @ xmath29 . now we say that @ xmath28 is a forcing set of @ xmath0 . for each @ xmath0 - edge pair @ xmath10 of @ xmath1 , by definition [ anti ] @ xmath10 must contain one edge @ xmath25 in @ xmath6 . then @ xmath10 must pass through both @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 . by the definition for @ xmath28 , @ xmath10 contains at least one edge of @ xmath28 . then , [ anti ] says that @ xmath28 is a forcing set of @ xmath0 . then the inequality holds . then @ xmath30 , and the first inequality is true . then we prove the second inequality . let @ xmath31 be a complete forcing set of @ xmath0 . then @ xmath32 . for each edge @ xmath25 in @ xmath31 , we choose from the edges contained in @ xmath0 together with the edges of @ xmath##25 . all these cycles form a cycle @ xmath33 of length no less than @ xmath34 , which is identical with @ xmath0 . we know that @ xmath33 is an anti - forcing set of @ xmath0 . however , theorem [ bound ] states that @ xmath35 is an @ xmath0 - like cycle @ xmath10 . since every edge of @ xmath31 is a single edge of @ xmath35 , @ xmath10 does not pass through any edge of @ xmath31 . this implies that @ xmath31 is a forcing set of @ xmath0 . theorem [ bound ] . . @ xmath36 . @ xmath37 . using the above the above definition is equivalent . thus we also have , @ xmath21 is the _ maximum anti - forcing number _ of @ xmath1 . whereas , @ xmath38 is the _ maximum anti - forcing number _ of @ xmath1 . the following is an immediate consequence of theorem [ bound ] . [ forcing ] let @ xmath1 be a cycle with a perfect matching and the _ anti@ xmath19 . , @ xmath39 . , @ xmath40 and @ xmath41 are called the _ forcing spectrum _ @ xcite and the _ anti - forcing spectrum _ of @ xmath1 respectively . for example , @ xmath42 and @ xmath43 ( see fig .

[ ineqality ] for a perfect matching @ xmath0 of a graph @ xmath1 , we have @ xmath49 . for plane directed graphs @ xmath1 we can see that the result of the above discussion also holds . the vertices of @ xmath1 are colored with red and blue so that each pair of the vertices has two colors . these two colored pairs form a bipartition of @ xmath1 . [ minimax ] let @ xmath1 be a plane directed graph with a perfect matching @ xmath0 . then @ xmath50 to find such a minimax , we need a previous result of lucchesi and then @ xcite for simple graphs ; a previous result ._ consider a lovsz @ xcite . let @ xmath51 be a directed directed graph . the set _ of @ xmath51 is the collection of sets that contain at least one edge of a directed cycle of @ xmath51 . @ xcite [ ly ] for a given directed graph , the maximum feedback set has dimension equal to that of the maximum set of self - organizing directed cycles . _ proof of theorem [ minimax ] . _ _ assign a new orientation of @ xmath1 to @ xmath0 to be a cycle @ xmath52 : each edge in @ xmath0 is directed from white end to black end , and the edges of in @ xmath0 are directed from black end to white ends . then the @ xmath0 - directed cycles of @ xmath1 correspond exactly to the edges of this orientation . _ assign each edge of @ xmath0 in @ xmath52 to a cycle ( i . e . contract the edge and add both cycles ) to obtain a new orientation , given by @ xmath53 . we can see that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the @ x##math0 - alternating cycles of @ xmath1 and directed cycles of @ xmath53 . that is , an @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 is a directed cycle @ xmath53 , and a directed cycle of @ xmath53 will become an @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 when every edge is connected to an edge of @ xmath0 . hence see theorem [ y ] a compatible @ xmath23 is an arc - independent subset of @ xmath0 if and only if @ xmath6 is a feedback set of @ xmath53 . thus @ xmath2 has the maximum number of feedback sets of @ xmath53 . on the other hand , a compatible @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath1 corresponds to a set of arc - independent directed cycles of @ xmath53 . that means that @ xmath48 has the maximum number of arc - independent directed cycles of @ xmath53 . note that @ xmath53 is a directed graph . see theorem [ ly ] for @ xmath54 . @xmath55 ##1 . 5 . however , the statement of the [ ineqality ] does not always hold in general . the graph is perfect ( # cf . [ 3 ] ( 2 ) ) ; for this particular perfect matching given in # ##er , it can be shown that there are at least two such alternating cycles , and the odd - odd number is at least one . in this case we restrict our discussion to the complete graph @ xmath3 with a perfect matching @ xmath0 . without loss of detail , @ xmath3 is located in the plane such that the edge - direction is normal and the vertices ( i . e . those edges of @ xmath3 that can have two low neighbors , but no high neighbors ) are normal . an @ xmath0 - alternating cycle @ xmath10 of @ xmath3 is said to be _ odd _ ( resp . _ odd _ ) if an edge of @ xmath10 of @ xmath0 goes from white end to black end ( resp . from black end to white end ) in the edge direction of @ xmath10 . the height of @ xmath3 is theedge of the opposite direction . the edge on the left is a free edge . the second forcing theorem states that the smallest non - negative number is the forcing number of a perfect system . [ 1 ] let @ xmath3 be a perfect system with a perfect matching . then @ xmath56 . since the alternating set of @ xmath3 is a compatible @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath47 for any perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 , we have that @ xmath57 from to [ minimax ] . then we can prove that @ xmath58 . it follows to show that for any compatible alternating set @ xmath47 of @ xmath3 with @ xmath59 , we can find a fries set @ xmath31 of @ xmath3 such that @ xmath60 . find a compatible @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath47 of @ xmath3 with a perfect matching @ xmath0 . the sets @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 of @ xmath47 are _ matched _ if they share an edge @ xmath25then @ xmath0 and the two cycles belonging to @ xmath25 cross between @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 ( i . e . @ xmath61 enters into @ xmath62 from one side and exits from the other side via @ xmath25 ) . such an alternate @ xmath25 is said to be a crossing . for details , see below . we say @ xmath47 = _ non - crossing _ if the two edges in @ xmath47 are a crossing . - two cycles @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 ( both edges are not in @ xmath0 ) . ] * = 1 . * for each cycle @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath47 of @ xmath3 , we can find the closest non - crossing cycle @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath63 of @ xmath3 such that @ xmath64 . * @ xmath47 has a pair of edge pairs @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 . in particular @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 have a pair oftheorem . let @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 be two edge pairs , which are not in @ xmath0 . then we can move to the shortest path @ xmath62 from where @ xmath65 crosses into the graph of @ xmath61 , and consider the cycle @ xmath66 . suppose that @ xmath67 is the first vertex of @ xmath62 entering from @ xmath61 and @ xmath68 the first vertex of @ xmath62 entering from @ xmath61 to @ xmath67 . for example , if the path @ xmath10 through @ xmath3 has two vertices @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 , we can describe by @ xmath71 the paths from @ xmath69 to @ xmath70 and @ xmath10 respectively . if @ xmath61 is a proper @ xmath0 - alternating cycle and @ xmath62 is an improper @ xmath0 - alternating cycle , then @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 ( respectively ) .( ( right ) ) . if @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 both have compatible ( resp . 2 ) @ xmath0 - alternating sets , then @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 ( see fig . 2 ( right ) ) . in both these cases @ xmath61 and @ xmath62 , @ xmath47 can be combined with @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 to get a new compatible @ xmath0 - alternating set of @ xmath3 and then a pair of cycles @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 respectively . since such a combination would not create any more cycles , by repeating the same cycle we can get a new @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath63 of @ xmath3 that is non - compatible . it is known that @ xmath64 . for each matching @ xmath10 of @ xmath3 , let @ xmath78 be the number of crossings in the set of @ xmath10 . from this , we can get a cycle matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath3and a member of @ xmath0 - alternating set @ xmath47 such that ( i ) @ xmath59 and ( ii ) @ xmath47 are non - crossing , and @ xmath79 is as large as possible relative to ( i ) and ( ii ) . we call @ xmath80 the @ xmath81 - _ interior _ of @ xmath47 . by the following theorem we have that for any two cycles in @ xmath47 their interiors either are equal or one equals the other one . all the cycles in @ xmath47 have a _ poset _ subject to the equivalence relation of their interiors . since every @ xmath0 - alternating set contains an @ xmath0 - alternating cycle in its interior ( cf . @ xcite ) , we can prove the following theorem . * theorem 1 . * every single member of @ xmath47 is a maximal . it follows to assume that all members of @ xmath47 are maximal . note to the contrary that @ xmath47 contains at least one non - crossing cycle . let @ xmath10 be a maximal .- a vertex of @ xmath47 . thus @ xmath10 is an @ xmath0 - alternating cycle . we consider the proper alternating cycle @ xmath82 formed by @ xmath10 and its complement , a subgraph of @ xmath3 . without loss of detail , assume that @ xmath10 is a proper @ xmath0 - alternating cycle ( since , all vertices are located on right - top corner of @ xmath82 ) . then we can find a vertex of @ xmath82 on the left - top corner [ fig . , @ xmath83 . ] we use the algorithm of zheng and search @ xcite . for @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 , find a set of vertices on the interior of @ xmath82 in fig . 2 that is a directed graph and such that neither @ xmath86 nor @ xmath87 is contained in @ xmath82 . we find , , if necessary , by @ xmath88 and @ xmath89 , and by @ xmath90 and @xmath85 ; and all the vertices ( not necessarily those with @ xmath82 ) with corresponding edges @ xmath91 and @ xmath92 , and @ xmath93 and @ xmath85 ( see ref . * * ) . * ( a ) @ xmath94 , and @ xmath95 , + ( b ) @ xmath96 ##3 , for all @ xmath97 , + ( c ) for all @ xmath97 , @ xmath98 , and + ( d ) if @ xmath99 , @ xmath100 , and @ xmath101 . we can prove the theorem by induction using @ xmath102 . we can use @ xmath103 . if @ xmath104 , then @ xmath105 is a proper @ xmath0 - alternating graph . then @ xmath10 ##3 @ xmath47 can be combined with @ xmath105 to create a new proper @ xmath0 - alternating graph @ xmath63 . that is , @ xmath106 , and@ xmath107 , a contradiction . for @ xmath108 , which means that @ xmath109 and the edge @ xmath110 belong to @ xmath0 . so @ xmath111 is the product of @ xmath82 and @ xmath95 . if @ xmath112 , since the cycle @ xmath10 of @ xmath82 is a proper @ xmath0 - alternating cycle , each of the edges @ xmath113 is a proper cycle of @ xmath82 . in this case the cycle @ xmath10 can be combined with @ xmath114 to give a proper @ xmath0 - alternating cycle with less than @ xmath81 - greater than @ xmath47 , hence a contradiction . so @ xmath94 . then the theorem holds for @ xmath103 . take @ xmath115 and show that , for all , @ xmath116 . we want to prove that it holds for @ xmath117 . there are two cases to be considered . * case 1 . * @ xmath9##6 . suppose that @ xmath118 . if @ xmath119 , then @ xmath120 will converge to @ xmath0 . using the analogous argument given above , we show that @ xmath121 contains members of @ xmath82 , and @ xmath10 can be combined with @ xmath122 to form an @ xmath0 - alternating alternating set with more @ xmath81 - cycles than @ xmath81 , by a contradiction . hence @ xmath123 . by the first hypothesis we have @ xmath124 , and @ xmath125 is an @ xmath0 - alternating set . if @ xmath126 , the same result holds for @ xmath127 . we can prove that none of members of @ xmath47 contains @ xmath10 and @ xmath125 . hence @ xmath128 is a complete @ xmath129 - alternating set , which is less than @ xmath47 , by the definition of @ xmath47 . hence @ xmath130 . if @ xmat##h131 , then @ xmath132 otherwise , @ xmath10 and @ xmath47 would be replaced with @ xmath125 to obtain a similar result . if @ xmath133 , by the same contradiction we have that @ xmath123 and @ xmath134 . then @ xmath135 . * step 2 . * @ xmath99 . find the intersection @ xmath136 with @ xmath137 such that @ xmath138 , and @ xmath139 . by the same rule , we have that the right hand side of the @ xmath140 belongs to @ xmath0 , the left @ xmath141 and all the @ xmath0 - compatible sides , which also belong to @ xmath47 , and @ xmath142 . if @ xmath143 , then @ xmath132 . we have that @ xmath131 ;

( for the definition of independent dominating , see @ xcite ) for every perfect matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 , with the [ 1 ] we have that @ xmath172 . note that @ xmath3 has no alternating cycles . since every @ xmath0 - alternating cycle of @ xmath3 has an @ xmath0 - alternating cycle in its interior , @ xmath14 has the maximum size of all @ xmath0 - alternating cycles of @ xmath3 . it is known that for every hexa##gon of @ xmath3 a non - joining edge belongs to @ xmath0 if and only if the two non - joining edges belong to @ xmath0 . find a maximum matching @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 such that @ xmath173 . let @ xmath6 be a maximum matching of the @ xmath0 - alternating edges of @ xmath3 and @ xmath174 . then @ xmath175 . we say that @ xmath176 is an upper maximum matching of @ xmath158 . let @ xmath81 be a subset of @ xmath3 contained in @ xmath6 . if the edge @ xmath177 of @ xmath3 adjacent to @ xmath81 matches the three non - joining edges of @ xmath0 , then @ xmath178 . therefore , @ xmath81 is an @ xmath0 - alternating edge . since @ xmath179 and @ xmath6 are independent , the edge of @ xmath3 adjacent to@ xmath81 must belong to @ xmath6 . then the following : , and @ xmath180 . now , find the unique alternating edge of @ xmath176 of @ xmath158 . find the perfect matching @ xmath181 of @ xmath3 as above . the two non - opposite edges of each vertex of @ xmath6 are known as edges of @ xmath181 . for any edge of @ xmath3 not in @ xmath6 , any other edge that is a pair of and together with the other edge not in @ xmath6 is not an edge of @ xmath181 . now we can see that @ xmath181 is the perfect matching of @ xmath3 and any edge of @ xmath3 not in @ xmath6 is an @ xmath181 - edge . hence @ xmath6 is the perfect matching of @ xmath181 - the edge of @ xmath3 . hence @ xmath182 . hence @ xmath183 . according to the above definition ,@ xmath6 is the set of all @ xmath181 - perfect copies of @ xmath3 . hence @ xmath184 . on the other hand , for the perfect copies @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 , @ xmath185 , and hence @ xmath186 . these statements imply the above statement . beyer et al . @ xcite used an algorithm of polynomial time to compute the minimum forcing number of a system . only the minimum forcing numbers of all - edge catahexes can be computed in polynomial time . for example , fig . [ cata ] shows the minimum forcing number of all all - edge catahexes . but the anti - forcing number of an all - edge catahex cannot be less than its minimum domination number ; for example , the triphenylene has the minimum forcing number 1 and the anti - forcing number 2 ( see fig . [ 2 ] ( 3 ) ) . li @ xcite counts the number of such systems with an anti - forcing edge ( i . e . an edge that itself has an anti - forcing edge ) . for li @ xmath188 , the@ xmath189 is a linear system with @ xmath190 both sides of @ xmath188 , and the end of each row is located above and to the right of the first edge of the first row , and we call it _ _ graph _ @ xcite ; for details , see fig . [ para ] . in particular , @ xmath191 with @ xmath192 and @ xmath193 and @ xmath194 with @ xmath193 are truncated and linear systems respectively . note that a truncated graph can be constructed and solved in different ways . namely , a linear chain has two anti - forcing edges , a directed chain has three anti - forcing edges , and a cycle has two anti - forcing edges . a complete truncated graph has only one anti - forcing edge ( see fig . [ para ] ) . in the following we can give a proof for linear systems with the anti - forcing property _ . the following proof proof 1 . let @ xmath1 be a regular , complete graph . each element of @ xmath1 is defined to be _ .( _ _ normal _ ) if it belongs to all ( resp . all ) perfect matchings of @ xmath1 . @ xmath1 is _ normal _ _ _ normal _ if @ xmath1 has a fixed single edge . the non - normal components of @ xmath1 form a subgraph whose edges are normal and are 2 - regular respectively , which are called _ _ blocks _ of @ xmath1 . similarly , a normal component of @ xmath1 is _ _ _ _ normal _ if it is formed by a pair of @ xmath1 with normal neighbors . a normal block of a graph with a vertex of degree 2 , and a single edge is a normal block . @ xcite [ 1 ] let @ xmath3 be a 2 - regular graph with a perfect matching . if the # ##s of @ xmath1 are of the same degree and agree on the origin , then @ xmath1 has at least one normal block . if @ xmath1 has a fixed single edge and @ xmath197 , then @ xmath1 has at least two normal blocks . let @ xmath3 be a regular graph with a perfect matching. let @ xmath198 be the set of all edges of @ xmath3 such that @ xmath199 and @ xmath200 belong to the same set and the @ xmath26 and @ xmath201 are parallel edges . hence @ xmath202 is an edge - matching of @ xmath3 and @ xmath203 is normal for all edge matchings @ xmath0 of @ xmath3 . theorem . [ component ] @ xmath3 has at least two normal components . such a component is a normal system with the anti - forcing number at least 2 . note that the anti - forcing number of @ xmath3 is the sum of the anti - forcing numbers of the normal components . hence @ xmath204 if and only if @ xmath3 has exactly two normal components , which are equal to . theorem [ component ] . [ af2 ] let @ xmath3 be a normal ##ized system . hence @ xmath204 if and only if @ xmath3 is not a normal and @ xmath3 can be constructed by adding .the graphs @ xmath205 and @ xmath206 have their edges inscribed on a fused path @ xmath207 of finite length such that + ( i ) an edge - parallel edge of @ xmath205 lies on the path , + ( ii ) the edges of each @ xmath208 with an edge of @ xmath207 form a linear chain or a chain with one edge ( i . e . the graph consists of a chain with only one additional edge ) , and + ( iii ) when the fused path @ xmath207 passes through each @ xmath209 ( or @ xmath210 ) of @ xmath205 , the edges of @ xmath205 ( resp . @ xmath206 ) with an edge of @ xmath207 form a linear chain that forms the first ( or last ) edge of @ xmath205 ( resp . a chain with one edge ) . ( see ref . [ 2 ] ) suppose that @ xmath204 . then @ xmath3 has two edges @ xmath25 and @ xmath##211 suppose that @ xmath212 has a cut edge , @ xmath0 . then by theorem [ component ] @ xmath82 has two pendant edges with opposite degrees . then one of @ xmath25 and @ xmath211 , called @ xmath25 , must be the two vertices of @ xmath3 ; so @ xmath82 has at least one pendant edge , or vertex . now , suppose that @ xmath25 has two edges with degree two . then @ xmath213 has the same degree two . if @ xmath213 is two - dimensional , it must be a cube , rather than a pentagon , so that @ xmath213 has an un - cut edge @ xmath211 . if @ xmath213 has a cut edge , by theorem [ component ] @ xmath213 has at least two cut edges . then @ xmath214 , then by theorem , and suppose that . . . @ xmath213 has a pendant edge @ xmath67 . the graphs @ xmath215 , @ xmath67 and @it belongs to all perfect matchings of @ xmath213 , and is therefore anti - forced by @ xmath25 . then the vertices of this graph and other edges , the pendant vertices of the neighbor graph , belong to all perfect matchings of @ xmath213 , so that they are anti - forced by @ xmath25 . repeating the same process , until to produce a graph without pendant vertices , forced by @ xmath216 . if @ xmath216 is symmetric , then @ xmath25 is an anti - forcing edge of @ xmath3 , a neighbor . hence , @ xmath216 is a perfect matching and the edge has symmetry . suppose that the triangular edges of @ xmath216 are symmetric . using the same argument to the proof of claim 1 , we show that @ xmath216 is a neighbor graph with an anti - forcing edge @ xmath211 . then claim 2 holds . without loss of detail , suppose that : @ xmath25 goes from the left - up end @ xmath67 to the right - up end . then @ xmath215 is a right -. let @ xmath69 be the line with center @ xmath25 , @ xmath217 the boundary edge of @ xmath69 adjacent to @ xmath25 , @ xmath218 the boundary edge of @ xmath69 adjacent to @ xmath25 . from the definition @ xmath219 of @ xmath69 is a ray belonging to and coming from @ xmath217 ( resp . @ xmath215 ) . the vertices of @ xmath210 at @ xmath47 ( resp . at @ xmath209 and @ xmath86 ) note that @ xmath220 ( resp . @ xmath221 ) also passes through vertices of @ xmath3 . let @ xmath222 and @ xmath223 be the linear combination of @ xmath3 consisting of rays from @ xmath220 and @ xmath221 ; see ref . [ case1 ] . for the same reason as claim 1 , we have the following result . from claim 2 we can see that @ xmath3consider no graph from parallel to @ xmath222 . let @ xmath225 denote a series of edges in @ xmath222 parallel to @ xmath215 and above @ xmath220 , @ xmath226 denote a series of edges in @ xmath222 parallel to @ xmath218 and above @ xmath220 ( see ref . [ case1 ] ) . then @ xmath227 are anti - forced by @ xmath25 in , and thus belong to @ xmath0 . let @ xmath228 denote the graph consisting of the edges adjacent to @ xmath222 and above in . if @ xmath229 is a directed graph of @ xmath3 , then @ xmath230 are also anti - forced by @ xmath25 and thus belong to @ xmath0 . if @ xmath228 is a directed graph with an odd edge in @ xmath223 , and then @ xmath228 has at most two edges in @ xmath222 . therefore , the graph [ .] we say that the odd edges in @ xmath228 are the normal edges , and that @ xmath3 is normal . in particular , for @ xmath231 and @ xmath232 be the chain graph of the edges parallel to @ xmath233 and define x . if @ xmath232 has a path from x to the other end vertex of @ xmath233 , by the same formula as above we say that @ xmath232 is a linear chain with an end vertex in @ xmath223 and the edges in @ xmath232 parallel to @ xmath218 are non - normal to @ xmath25 and therefore normal to @ xmath0 . there are two cases to be considered . in this case there must be an edge @ xmath234 such that for each @ xmath97 , @ xmath235 is a linear chain with an end vertex in @ xmath223 and @ xmath235 has the same normal edges as @ xmath236 , and @ xmath232 .a square is equal to the right ##most edge of @ xmath233 . since @ xmath3 is a positive integer , a square . starting with @ xmath223 , and the integer @ xmath235 we can find @ xmath237 in common and prove the following theorem : there must be an integer @ xmath238 such that for each @ xmath239 , @ xmath240 has a linear combination with right most edges in @ xmath222 and @ xmath240 , twice as many edges in @ xmath241 , and @ xmath242 has a degree equal only to the left edge of @ xmath243 ( see fig . 2 ) . so @ xmath233 and @ xmath243 have one half of @ xmath244 in common . let @ xmath245 be the center of @ xmath244 , @ xmath63 the center of the most - right ##most edge of @ xmath233 and @ xmath87 the center of the most -instead of @ xmath246 . then @ xmath247 is also a subhexagonal graph located in high - degree position of the graph @ xmath248 . let @ xmath205 be the graph consisting of @ xmath249 and @ xmath250 . it is known that @ xmath205 is a complete graph , @ xmath205 and @ xmath206 are in a cycle of equal length , and both ( i ) and ( ii ) exist . * * 1 * . @ xmath3 has vertices adjacent right to @ xmath223 . let @ xmath252 be the graph consisting of vertices of @ xmath3 adjacent right to @ xmath223 . let @ xmath234 be the complete graph such that @ xmath253 has the left side vertices adjacent to the vertices of @ xmath252 . note that @ xmath234 must be connected . let @ xmath254 have a pair of parallel graphs of @ xmath255 on the left side ( i ) . [ case2 ]) . ( the edges @ xmath256 are self - parallel to @ xmath25 and therefore parallel to @ xmath0 . if each @ xmath235 is a linear chain and @ xmath257 has two edges adjacent right to the left - end point of @ xmath236 , then @ xmath252 is a linear chain that intersects @ xmath223 with a path of odd length , so @ xmath258 will be a linear chain consisting of @ xmath252 and its right end . thus , by these properties we have that for each @ xmath97 , @ xmath235 has a linear chain with an odd edge in @ xmath223 and @ xmath235 has at most two edges in @ xmath236 , so @ xmath232 has a path adjacent right to the right end point of @ xmath233 . let @ xmath244 be the left end point of @ xmath233 , @ xmath245 the center of @ xmath244, @ xmath63 the center of the simply - connected vertical edge of @ xmath233 and @ xmath87 the center of the edge of @ xmath244 from north to @ xmath259 . since @ xmath247 also lies between @ xmath248 , and @ xmath205 south of @ xmath260 ( see fig . [ case2 ] ) . then the theorem is satisfied . now , suppose that @ xmath3 is obtained from the graph that the theorem describes . we then show that the anti - forcing property @ xmath25 of @ xmath205 is anti - forcing all edges and all vertices of @ xmath205 except for the edge @ xmath207 . that is , @ xmath261 . then @ xmath262 . since @ xmath3 is also equivalent to , @ xmath204 . then we find another way of doing the proof of theorem [ af2 ] as shown in fig . [ case ] . the following graph has the same vertical edge configuration . in particular , zhang and zhang @ xcite , and hansen and zheng @ xcitefor all graphs with a single equation . comparing the graphs @ xmath3 with @ xmath262 , we can see that in relation to these systems of equations , we can have that @ xmath263 . + * + * * m . abeledo , m . j . atkinson , unimodularity of the clar forcing ##s , linear algebra appl . 420 ( 2007 ) 441448 z . chen , a . mahdian , e . s . mahmoodian , on the forced matching numbers of perfect graphs , discrete math . 281 ( 2004 ) 112 . a . afshani , m . hatami , e . s . mahmoodian , on the theory of the forced matching numbers of graphs , australas . j . combin . 3 ( 2004 ) 147160 . a . beyer , a . proskurowski , a . hedetniemi , z . chen , graph forcing of graphs , congr .
