in solid - state photonic crystal fibers ( pcf ) the high - quality microstructured structure ( see ref . [ fig1 ] ) gives rise to a number of practical applications @ xcite and large - scale operation ( lma ) non - single crystal applications @ xcite . although pcfs typically have physical properties very different from that of standard fibers they of course share many of the same properties such as the resistance of the fibers to macro - bending . macrobending - induced loss in pcfs has been demonstrated both physically as well as theoretically / theoretically in a number of papers @ xcite . however , predicting macro - loss is an easy task and it requires a simple empirical solution of the above problem as well as calculation of a phenomenological scale parameter , _ e . g . _ _ effective bending losses . in this article we tackle the problem and show how macro - bending losses observed in high - quality pcfs can be predicted with high accuracy using easy - to - understand mathematical methods . predictions of macro - bending induced loss in photonic crystal fibers have been made using various methods including fiber - design for single crystal fibers @ xcite , fiber - design theory @ xcite, and phenomenological ##ly for the low - mode limit @ xcite . here , we will use the re - formulation of sakai and kimura @ xcite , and according to ref . @ xcite we apply a linear transformation of optical - transmission parameters such as @ xmath1 , @ xmath2 , and @ xmath0 @ xcite to the parameters corresponding to high - index - pcfs with a large number of black holes . in the low - index - case we use ( see below ) @ xmath3 for the beta - decay , @ xmath4 , for the decay . for the reference to the large - index @ xmath5 should be replaced by @ xmath6 . in ref . ( [ # _ lma ] ) , @ xmath7 is the core radius , @ xmath8 is the core radius @ xcite , @ xmath9 is the radius of bending , and @ xmath10 is the newly discovered - z - parameter of the pcf @ xcite . the advantage of our formulation is that it requires no other parameters ( such as the effective core radius ) and no other parameters , based only on @ xmath##11 and @ xmath12 , have been published , for both @ xmath8 and @ xmath13 @ xcite . from the expression @ xmath14 we can see the linear dependence of the critical bending radius @ xmath15 . the dependence holds only when the constant is greater than 1 and thus we can calculate the critical bending radius from @ xmath16 where @ xmath17 . therefore the pcf is very close to cut - off where @ xmath18 @ xcite so that the expression can be written as @ xmath19 this effect was first observed and later confirmed by birks _ et al . _ @ xcite and with a pre - value of # 1 was also published in february 2011 . we have fabricated three lma fibers using the drag - and - drop method and tested them by the standard cut - off method . all three fibers have a single air - hole , and a hollow core characterized by a single large air - hole in the center of the core , see ref . [ fig1 ] . for the lma - the stress - strain effect has been observed for strain angles of r = 5 cm and r = 10 cm and the results are shown in the. the predictions of fig . ( [ @ _ lma ] ) are still valid . it is clear that the predictions are based on the experimental data for @ xmath8 and @ xmath13 , in ref . @ xcite and @ xcite , and therefore do not require any further calculations . the results are given in ref . [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] for the lma - 30 and lma - 40 models , respectively . the pcf , in general , has both a short and long - wavelength bend - edge . however , the models given above only show the short - wavelength bend - edge . the reason for this is that the long - wavelength bend - edge occurs for @ xmath20 @ xcite . for the lma - pcfs it is only found in the ultra - short wavelength region of interest . in addition we have shown that macro - bending loss factors for high - resolution pcfs can be calculated with high accuracy using easy - to - understand empirical methods with both @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 as the parameters . since macro - bending occurs for both parameters and therefore is the loss factor we know that the predicted behavior will be useful for many applications ofthese fibers are photonic optical fibers . the starting point is the core - radius parameter for the bending radius in a standard - fiber @ xcite @ xmath23 where @ xmath8 is the core area , @ xmath24 is the core area , @ xmath7 is the core radius , and the standard - fiber parameters are given by @ xcite @ xmath25 combining these parameters into 1 . ( [ alpha1 ] ) we get @ xmath26 . the special case where @ xmath27 . 2 , @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 and 2 . ( [ alpha _ lma ] ) and ( [ alpha _ pcf ] ) have been calculated . for high - effective optical fiber we have a new calculation for the optical fiber parameters ; using that @ xmath30 we get : 1 .
