electron magnetic moments are without doubt among the most well - known and commonly observed in magnetic fields . @ xcite as it was known long before @ xcite , for a large number of experimental models the magnetic moment is equal to the electron mass and in general quite large . for example , for the following extended standard model the total electron magnetic moment is given by @ xcite : @ xmath0 at the same time , the magnetic moment of hypothetical elementary particles ( with mass @ xmath1 ) is @ xmath2 @ xcite . it should be noted however that much lower values for the electron magnetic moment are available for other extensions of the standard model ( see , for example , gravity @ xcite ) bounds on the electron magnetic moment can be derived in @ xmath3 field theory from the quantum effects of scattering of the electron - electron interaction . the following experiments provide us with the following upper bounds on the electron magnetic moment : @ xmath4 ( munu ##i @ xcite ) , @ xmath5 ( texono ##m @ xcite ) . the reactor experiment has obtained the world record result @ xmath6@ xcite . another type of neutrino detector borexino ( for neutron ##s ) has obtained a lower limit : @ xmath7 @ xcite . the strongest terrestrial constraints on the electron magnetic moment has been obtained from observations of the gas phase : @ xmath8 @ xcite . as it is pointed out , the most powerful terrestrial constraints on the electron - magnetic moment have been obtained from ( theoretical ) electron - proton interaction experiments and the attempt to achieve further improvement of the limits is in progress . in particular , it is expected that the upper limit at the limit of @ xmath9 will be reached by the hiroshima experiment , a new type of experiments at the hiroshima nuclear power plant with much larger distances of the electron to the nucleus that will significantly increase the neutron flux ( see @ xcite ) . an attempt to further improve the upper bound on the electron magnetic moment was made in @ xcite where it was shown that the approximation for the electron recoil energy in vacuum will significantly reduce the neutron contribution to the neutron cross section in relation to the electron when the recoil energy term is used in terms of the cross section . however , as it was shown in a series ofpapers @ xcite the nuclear physics experiments on surfaces of external magnetic fields are not subject to the electron capture theory , so that the free electron model can be used for them . one would expect that the physical properties would be much better visualized when it is confined to external magnetic fields and in space . however , the propagation in matter is a relatively new research area , still being developed and making a lot of new predictions for different situations . the new and improved method for prediction of the propagation phenomena in matter has been first proposed in a series of papers @ xcite . the new method is based on the analysis of solutions of the ordinary differential equation for propagation in matter in phase space . the method was used before for prediction of propagation phenomena in quantum electrodynamics and is known as ` ` the method of the solutions ' ' @ xcite the progress from the development of the method was accompanied by new and elegant mathematical analysis of the spin model of the white dwarf of propagation in matter ( the @ xmath10 ) , first proposed by @ xcite using the non - classical version of the spin model . the essence of the @ xmath10 .the electromagnetic effect of the ##s has very different helicity properties of particles . the limitations of the theoretical framework , such as neglect of the bulk , unpolarized and non - spherical particles , and of the electromagnetic effects of the high energy , make the study of the electromagnetic parameters in theoretical physics different from the classical ones . in this recent paper we should attempt to make a contribution towards the development of the theoretical framework and to answer the very important first fundamental question of the plasmon mass measured by the @ xmath10 . the application of theoretical physics for the @ xmath10 of physics is already carried out in @ xcite . the experiments already carried out in this paper @ xcite show that the plasmon measured by the @ xmath10 has a large mass that can increase the efficiency of the process . to understand how the plasmon mass affects the @ xmath10 , we turn to the theory of numerical mechanics and carry out all the experiments related to the @ xmath10 . in this case , in order to obtain the results we must have all the parameters for the process the same as for the experiments on the @ xmath10 . in addition ,we use only the classical model of physics and use particles instead of electrons . in the exact quantum case , one starts with the classical wave equation for the system in question in order to determine initial and final spin ##ors , which would be the quantum states . the solution is thus : @ xcite : @ xmath11 where is the case of the ##s in the non - interacting and unpolarized state @ xmath12 with @ xmath13 the particle ( s ) number density . under this condition the system ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) has s - wave functions given by the - spin @ xmath14 and the sign of helicity @ xmath15 and sign of spin @ xmath16 . for the name of the method and the solution of the wave function @ xmath17 the method is referred to @ xcite and @ xcite , but we have also the equation for the particle number density : @ xmath18 the s - state of the system is the magnetic or magnetic field @ xmath19 + [ \ , ^ { { } { \ bf \ { } \ { \ } $ ] and for the spinors forthe initial and final states ##s @ xmath20 can be written as @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 is the transition time length , @ xmath23 is the total magnetic moment and @ xmath24 is the transition length . the wave - equation for spinors in plasma corresponds to the power law @ xmath25 with expressions for the initial and final states @ xmath26 , in addition to ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) . for the first time , for the purpose of our calculations it is necessary to use the numerical evaluation @ xmath27 . it was shown in our original calculations for the @ xmath10 @ xcite the most favorable conditions for the plasma to change its temperature are found in the ##r plasma . this is the expression we will use here for the plasma and in the case of the plasma the plasmon energy should be written as @ xmath28 the numerical evaluation for high temperatures as @ xmath29 , with the energy as @ xmath30 . let us first consider the effect of the plasma on the properties of the light of interest . according to the standard spin light equation weconsider the system of quantum state with the helicity quantum number @ xmath31 and the corresponding initial quantum helicity number @ xmath32 . comparing the photon energy ( [ q : energy ] ) with the helicities we can solve the problem ( [ q : energy ] ) in relation to plasmon , which is not equal to photon energy since we take into account the energy of the first photon in question ( [ photon energy ] ) . for ease of calculation it is possible to use the above formula . in many cases the photon energy seems to be the only parameter in the theoretical problem and it is several times larger than any other parameter in the system . here we could also solve our problem of calculation of the photon energy , but we should not assume that the particles with non - zero energy could not have the magnetic moment . this our problem should be considered only as a theoretical one . it should be pointed out that in order to understand the theoretical problem of the @ xmath10 we should look for the representation of the photon energy in the energy spectrum and the quantum wave function . from theenergy - dependent : it is @ xcite that the process is kinematically dependent . in the limit ( taking advantage of the above - mentioned parameters ) : @ xmath33 starting with the plasmon , we proceed with calculation of the @ xmath10 decay rate and total power . the exact calculation of total power is an open matter and the resulting result is too complicated to be used here . however one can consider the very wide range of energies to understand different aspects of the wave function . first of all we calculate the rate for the decay of the @ xmath10 without gravitational interaction . this can be done by taking the value @ xmath34 and the resulting result is in perfect agreement with @ xcite : @ xmath35 from ( [ gammasl ] ) one then calculate the @ xmath10 rate for two different parameters , _ i . e . _ _ and _ - high levels of energy , by taking either @ xmath14 or @ xmath36 with the last term in the latter . since the energy is the limiting parameter , our values are within the range of the ground state energy . the above formula for the total power also includes the andvery - high energy : @ xcite as well as the following cases where the density parameter and the total mass are different : @ xmath37 if we look for the gamma decay ( say , @ xmath38 ) and the @ xmath10 we can see two different cases . one is the decay of interest at the threshold , and the other is associated with the integration of @ xmath39 into the total energy equation . the threshold case is especially important for this discussion , because it is the focus of the entire article on understanding the conditions under which the plasmon mass can not be conserved . for the equivalent cases the density parameter which has to be greater than the plasmon mass , which in its case is , is the total momentum : @ xmath40 . then the threshold case ( [ threshold ] ) should be considered . if we have the conditions similar to the threshold conditions it is possible to consider high - energy cases . using the linear ##ization of the decay , we could calculate the rate of the decay in the following way : @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 . at the threshold ( @ xmath43 ) , the rate ( [ gammaslseries ] ) ishowever , but it is valid for a wide range of systems with @ xmath44 and @ xmath45 . at the threshold the the total power can be expressed in the form @ xmath46 . the second form is too complicated to be used directly . for the coupling of the @ xmath10 with plasmon , one should use the formula : @ xmath47 the expansion ( [ intensslseries ] ) is valid only if the power meets the threshold @ xmath48 . then one should use higher powers of the @ xmath49 in the limit to obtain a larger amount of power . above the threshold the power has the same effect on the ` ` distance ' ' from the threshold @ xmath50 and the efficiency of the system . there is an increasing interest to the quantum theory and to magnetic moments in general . this interest is driven , mainly by the advances in experimental work on magnetic moments which have been recently published , as well as by studies of new phenomena closely related to the magnetic moment , such as the @ xmath10 and the belief in their potential for many practical applications . in particular the physics of the white dwarfs of the##utrino , we have already shown that the effect of plasmon mass is zero ( ( ( [ gammaslseries ] ) and ( [ intensslseries ] ) ) when the quantity @ xmath51 is compared with @ xmath52 , this leads to the system approaching the threshold . as long as the is @ xmath48 ( when the system is far from the threshold ) we can calculate the @ xmath10 decay rate and the parameters from @ xcite and their two simple derivatives ( [ gammaslseries ] ) and ( [ intensslseries ] ) where the plasmon mass is accounted for as a correction factor . since high energy particles confined to matter could be a common phenomenon in nature , for example in neutron stars , the effect of their presence in matter on the @ xmath10 rate can be ignored and the uncertainty caused by the non - zero plasmon mass should not be taken into account . however , the method of exact solution of the wave equation provides us with exact solutions for uncertainty and uncertainty over the full range of the system . one of the authors ( n . d . ) is referring to giorgio bellettini , giorgio la##arelli , mario , and gino isidori for the opportunity to participate in the rencontres de physics de la vallee daoste on problems and problems of theoretical physics .
