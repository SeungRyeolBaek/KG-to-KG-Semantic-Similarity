the leptonic decay of a single pseudoscalar particle @ xmath7 is usually of the form @ xmath8 , where @ xmath9 , @ xmath10 , and @ xmath11 . because no strong interactions are observed in the leptonic initial state @ xmath12 , these experiments provide a convenient way to study the weak , weak interactions that form the neutron and proton in the ground - state system . in these cases , the interaction energies can be parametrized into a single quantity , @ xmath13 , the pseudoscalar particle decay constant . the leptonic decay ##s can be determined by experiment , and the decay constant can be determined by the quantity ( with radiative corrections ) @ xmath14 where @ xmath15 is the weak interaction matrix , @ xmath16 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @ xcite ##r , @ xmath17 is the charge of the particle , and @ xmath18 is the mass of the decay particle . the quantity @ xmath13 is the same for the @ xmath19 and @ xmath20- particles of the @ xmath21 to undergo complete decay , a condition necessary for them to decay into the next @ xmath22 particle that is the @ xmath12 particle . the accurate determination of decay constant is one of the most common types of calculations using nonperturbative methods . these calculations have been done using either the @ xcite or squared standard deviation ( lqcd ) . the latter is now generally considered to be the most accurate way to determine the constant . determination of decay constant is useful for studying other decay phenomena , such as @ xmath23 decay , which occurs at @ xmath24 , a quantity that is not determined using lqcd calculations . the comparison @ xcite of @ xmath24 with the leptonic decay of the @ xmath25 particle is , however , very difficult . the data is very limited due to the lack of the presence of the many ckm suppressed particles @ xmath26 . the two instruments , @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 , are excellent instruments to study the leptonic decay of these particles since these particles are much more ckm suppressed than ., _ i . e . _ , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 are much heavier than @ xmath31 . therefore , the # ##s @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 results from the charm decay can be used to understand and perform the various lqcd calculations related to the @ xmath34 - type decay . among the leptonic decay in the anti - charm model , @ xmath35 products are more stable since they are ckm stable . also , the higher energy of the @ xmath11 decay reduces the helicity effect that is observed in the decay to heavier elements . the presence of these products in the charm decay , however , makes prediction of this effect difficult . features of the standard model ( sm ) may also affect leptonic decay of heavier elements . based on the non - standard model , the ratio of @ xmath36 could be increased @ xcite , as could the ratio @ xcite @ xmath37 . both of the decay rates could be increased or decreased . there is no indication of a correlation between the decay ratio @ xcite of@ xmath33 and the most recent experimental lqcd of @ xcite . this result is very important since the cleo - c calculation @ xcite of @ xmath32 agrees well with the lqcd calculation @ xcite of that particle . we @ xcite determine that this decay may be caused by a weak higgs interaction with a leptoquark . in this way , we provide an approximate estimate of the expected decay rate of the leptonic particle @ xmath0 ( spin - dependent effects are excluded ) , with @ xmath1 , from which we calculate the decay rate @ xmath33 . we provide a data sample of @ xmath38 , produced in the central energy storage facility ( cesr ) and followed by the cleo - c measurements of the unit - of - mass ( mc ) of @ xmath39 mev , and @ xmath3 event of @ xcite . the data sample consists of the absolute value of @ xmath40 @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 @ xmath3 events . we have also obtained @ xcite values of @ xmath43 and @ xmath##0 with a subsample of these detectors . the subsequent detector @ xcite provides measurements of @ xmath33 from @ xmath43 and @ xmath0 , with @ xmath44 , using essentially the same detector set as the one used for this instrument . the cleo - x detector @ xcite is a general - purpose solenoidal detector with four main detectors used in this instrument : a large - scale 24 - layer , ##scopic drift chamber , a 24 - layer main drift chamber , a ring - shaped cherenkov ( rich ) detector , and an optical array consisting of 7800 csi ( rich ) detectors . the main drift chambers operate in an @ xmath45 % magnetic field and provide neutral particle measurements at a drift angle of @ xmath46 % of @ xmath47 . the detectors provide a spatial resolution of @ xmath48 % of @ xmath49 gev / @ xmath50 . the main drift chamber also provides self - imaging ( @ xmath51 ) detectors that distinguish between neutral particles and ions . the rich detector measures the @ xmath52 % of @ xmath47 and measures a range of neutral andemission at high energies . the total energy distribution of the signal is @ xmath53 % at @ xmath54 gev and @ xmath55 % at @ xmath56 mev . the model is based on a random process that combines the information from the original signal , @ xmath51 , and the use of the shower energy to produce it ( @ xmath57 ) . we use the geant - based @ xcite monte carlo ( als ) simulation program to build models of signal - event interaction and background radiation . signal events are generated by evtgen @ xcite , but with the same properties of the als @ xcite , and final - state radiation ( fsr ) is generated by the als @ xcite program . the model of initial - state radiation ( isr ) is based on the correlation for @ xmath3 particles at the energies obtained from the cleo - x - y @ xcite and the shower energy where we collect the data . the detection of the @ xmath58 particles in an @ xmath3 system allows us to construct a time - series ( st ) model in which the @ xmath58 is produced by a hadronic system .and a second double - tagged ( dt ) subsample in which an additional @ xmath59 is generated for each sample of @ xmath60 . , the @ xmath59 is the size of the @ xmath60 . the @ xmath61 tag in the st sample can be either generated or derived from @ xmath62 ( or @ xmath63 ) . the st efficiency can be expressed as @ xmath64 where @ xmath65 is the total number of @ xmath3 events , @ xmath66 is the produced fraction of hadronic events reconstructed from the st sample , and @ xmath67 is the st efficiency . the @ xmath68 are the values , the values , and the factor of 4 comes from the combination of @ xmath28 and @ xmath61 tags . our double - tagged ( dt ) efficiency is derived from samples with only a single decay mode , such as the @ xmath69 , in addition to the st . the dt can be expressed as @ xmath70 where @ xmath71 is the leptonic mode production fraction , is the subbranching fraction of@ xmath1 yields , @ xmath72 , the efficiency of both the st and the leptonic decay in the same time . from the st and dt , we can obtain the effective branching fraction of the leptonic decay @ xmath71 , without having to calculate the decay efficiency or the decay energy of @ xmath3 yields , @ xmath73 where @ xmath74 ( @ xmath75 ) is the effective decay efficiency . because of the high beam energy obtained with the help of the cleo - dt decay and the high energy of the particles with which we are working , @ xmath76 , where @ xmath77 is the leptonic decay efficiency . however , the ratio @ xmath78 is due to the statistical effects associated with the st , and the effective branching fraction @ xmath71 obtained by this ratio is not independent of the efficiency of the st decay . to avoid these effects , we are using the many - particle hadronic decay model with only two particles in the ground state . the # st ##s and @ xmath79 are the ##s for @ xmath80and in the range ( see below ) of the @ xmath81 peak in @ xmath82 and the @ xmath83 peak in @ xmath84 , respectively . no attempt was made to separate these three peaks from the @ xmath85 dalitz vs . ] ] @ xmath86 , @ xmath79 , and @ xmath87 . using these tag modes also helps to reduce the tag bias which would be caused by the difference between the mask side and the mask side , if tag modes with low values and high values were used . the value of the tag bias @ xmath88 can be expressed in terms of the st efficiency @ xmath74 divided by @ xmath89 where @ xmath90 is the st efficiency when the recoil system is the only leptonic system with the @ xmath59 on the mask side of the signal . since the average st efficiency @ xmath67 , when the recoil system and all the @ xmath91 signals , will be lower than the @ xmath90 , a tag bias could be applied if the efficiency of the tag mode is high , andthe tag modes tend to produce charged particles in the ground state . as shown in fig . [ 1 : 1 ] , this effect is observed in our current standard tag mode . the @ xmath92 beam is constructed by two parallel directed beams that come from a single source and that have an invariant mass of @ xmath93 mev of the nominal mass @ xcite . we expect the resonance decay to have the following two paths in the nominal mass @ xcite : @ xmath94 ( @ xmath95 mev ) and @ xmath96 ( @ xmath97 mev ) . we require the number of charged particles to be @ xmath56 mev or higher to produce the observed resonance decay from @ xmath98 + ( = @ xmath99 ) . we construct the st ##r from the invariant mass of the tag @ xmath100 and st ##ing against the tag @ xmath101 . the decay energy is defined as @ xmath102 where @ xmath103 is the angular angular - momentum of the @ xmath4 beam , taking the total beam rotation ##s into account ; @ xmat##h104 is the angular - momentum of the particle , with @ xmath105 derived from @ xmath106 and the nominal mass @ xcite of the @ xmath91 mass . we define the total energy to be the @ xmath107 mev of the @ xmath108 mass @ xcite . this time frame allows both primary and secondary @ xmath91 distributions to be used . to calculate the difference between our st and dt values from the corresponding tag regions ( tag combinations that , by definition , fall within the @ xmath109 signal region ) , we use the corresponding invariant mass sidebands . we define the signal region as @ xmath110 mev @ xmath111 mev , and the sideband ##s as @ xmath112 mev @ xmath113 mev and @ xmath114 mev @ xmath115 mev , where @ xmath116 is the difference between the invariant mass and the nominal mass . we restrict the st @ xmath109 distribution to the range of high - precision signal functions and first - order chebyshev ##ian signal function to thethe st and sideband scaling factor . the st mass and of ##t mass for each tag mode are shown in fig . [ table : data ] and the st mass and @ xmath109 sideband scaling factor are shown in fig [ table : data - multiple ] . we used @ xmath117 yield over the four tag modes . . [ table : data - multiple ] scaling of tag - mode ( st ) yields , where @ xmath118 is the yield in the st - mode region , @ xmath119 is the yield in the sideband region , @ xmath120 is the sideband scaling factor , and @ xmath68 is the st sideband - mode yield . [ parameters = " < , > , > , > , > " , header = " , " , ] we used four semileptonic states , @ xmath121 @ xmath122 , @ xmath123 , @ xmath124 , @ xmath125 , @ xmath126 , and @ xmath127 , as the main sources of yield in the @ xmath128 signal region . the latter is thenonpeaking background , and the result ( with @ xmath129 ) is the peak background . variation in the signal parameters due to nonpeaking background ( @ xmath130 ) is measured by measuring the semileptonic background branching fraction and the precision with which they are measured @ xcite . the ##ion of @ xmath131 gives rise to a systematic uncertainty in our estimates of the amount of peak background in the target signal , which has an effect on our branching fraction ##s of @ xmath132 . we measure variation in loss , data vs mc events , due to the extra energy requirement , extra energy requirement , and @ xmath133 loss , by taking information from data and mc events , for which _ of _ the @ xmath134 and @ xmath2 meet our energy requirements , i . e . , ` ` non - peak ' ' conditions . we then take all of the above - mentioned conditions and express them in terms of data vs mc events . in this way we obtain the value of @ xmath135 for the extra energy requirement and the variation in all of the above conditions of @ xmath136 ( not true , by definition ) . the following- @ xmath69 , from the signal @ xmath69 this sample is unknown ( @ xmath137 ) due to the high probability ( @ xmath138 per sample ) that they ( @ xmath139 and @ xmath140 ) are misidentified as @ xmath69 @ xcite . uncertainty in these samples is the @ xmath141 and in the background of @ xmath142 . the signal @ xmath69 , from signal transfer processes , such as @ xmath143 dalitz decay ( @ xmath144 ) and @ xmath145 decay ( @ xmath146 ) , are determined by measuring the plus - minus errors present in correlation with @ xmath147 . the uncertainty in the background from this sample is determined to be @ xmath148 . the possible sources of this uncertainty are @ xmath68 ( @ xmath137 ) , signal decay ( @ xmath149 ) , signal decay ( @ xmath148 ) , @ xmath59 ##0 decay ( @ xmath150 ) , and fsr( @ xmath150 ) . for the measurements in question , the absolute branching fraction of the branching fraction ##s is defined to be @ xmath151 . in summary , from the determination of @ xmath152 and @ xmath28 ##0 with the cleo - newton method we obtain the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic states @ xmath153 and @ xmath154 @ xmath155 where the first value is absolute and the second is relative . this determination follows our previous determination @ xcite of the absolute branching fraction , which is a subsample of data collected in this study . the decay rate @ xmath33 can be calculated using ref . ( [ 1 : 2 ] ) with the values @ xcite @ xmath156 gev @ xmath157 , @ xmath158 mev , @ xmath159 mev , and @ xmath160 respectively . we compute @ xmath161 and use the determination @ xmath162 . in summary . we compute @ xmath163 along with our previous determination @ xcite of @ xmath164 mevwith @ xmath43 and @ xmath0 ( @ xmath165 ) respectively , we obtain @ xmath166 this result is derived from the branching fraction , and is the most accurate determination of the @ xmath91 leptonic mass , to date . our new value is larger than the previous lqcd for @ xmath167 mev @ xcite and @ xmath168 standard deviation . the difference between sm and lqcd for @ xmath33 could be due to uncertainty of the measurement @ xcite , the measurement errors between the experimental measurements and the lqcd calculation , and other factors that are not affected by the lqcd calculation and the experimental results . comparing with our previous measurement @ xcite of @ xmath169 , via @ xmath44 , we obtain @ xmath170 comparing this with our measurement @ xcite of @ xmath171 , we obtain the branching fraction of @ xmath172 this is comparing with @ xmath173 , the result obtained for the measurements with the ##s , as stated in ref . ( [ 1 : 1 ] ) with the values @xcite . we also appreciate the efforts of the cesr team in the us with the design and operating systems . m . cronin - hennessy and m . ryd from the h . p . sloan foundation . this project is funded by the national science foundation , the u . s . department of energy , the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada , and the u . s . science and technology facilities administration . a . amsler _ et al . _ ( quantum computing collaboration ) , phys . d * 667 * , 295 ( 2008 ) . j . ikado _ et al . _ ( # ##au ) , phys . lett . * 75 * , 251802 ( 2006 ) . j . aubert _ et al . _ ( international collaboration ) , phys . d . d * 111 * , 011107 ( 2008 ) . a . g . akeroyd and c . c . smith , phys . d * 111 * , 075004 ( 2007 ) ; a . g . akeroyd , prog . phys . * 111 * , 295 ( 2004 ) . j . r . hewett , arxiv : astro - ph / 9505246 . j. c . hou , phys . d * 100 * , 2342 ( 1993 ) . m . follana , m . j . a . smith , j . a . lepage , and t . shigemitsu ( hpqcd collaboration ) , phys . lett . * 99 * , 062002 ( 2008 ) . j . a . alexander _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . rev . d * 100 * , 052003 ( 2008 ) . m . a . dobrescu and j . a . kronfeld , phys . * 99 * , 241802 ( 2008 ) . m . cronin - hennessy _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , arxiv : 0801 . 3418 . m . artuso _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . lett . * 99 * , 071802 ( 2007 ) . j . a . ecklund _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . rev . lett . * 99 * , 161801 ( 2008 ) . j . a . alexander _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . rev .d * 79 * , 052001 ( 2009 ) . t . kubota _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , nucl . instrum . d * 320 * , 34 ( 1992 ) . p . peterson _ et al . _ , instrum . methods phys . , rev . d * 478 * , 142 ( 2002 ) . m . artuso _ et al . _ , nucl . instrum . methods phys . d * 502 * , 51 ( 2003 ) . m . dobbs _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . rev . d * 79 * , 112001 ( 2007 ) . d . p . peterson _ et al . _ ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . rev . lett . * 79 * , 161804 ( 2008 ) . m . barberio and y . wang , comput . . commun . * 79 * , 291 ( 1994 ) .
