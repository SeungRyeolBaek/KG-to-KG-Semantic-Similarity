images of laser beams travelling through the air are used for many applications such as remote sensing , radar , and long - distance radio communications . howerver , and other laser beams are highly sensitive to changes of the atmospheric pressure index . the fully coherent laser beam exhibits some degree of nonlinear ##ity in terms of its passage through the atmosphere . as a result , the noise / signal ratio is zero for long - distance communications . ( see , for example , ref . @ xcite - @ xcite ) . this adverse effect affects the performance of communication systems . to counter this adverse effect the concept of fully ( partially ) coherent beams was introduced . the incident laser beam can be transformed into a fully coherent beam by means of a laser beam incident at the exit point . this transformation introduces an additional phase ( usually associated with frequency and time ) to the wave function of the incident laser . the components of the additional phase determine the initial transverse pulse length of the beam . it is shown in ref . @ xcite , @ xcite that a significant increase in the noise / signal ratio can occur under two conditions : ( 1 ) the decrease of the initial transverse pulse length , @ xmath0, to the mean value , @ xmath1 , should be much greater than that ; and ( 3 ) the characteristic time of the signal , @ xmath2 , should be much larger than the characteristic time , @ xmath3 , of the detector . however , only the limits @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 have been defined in the literature . ( see , for example , ref . @ xcite , @ xcite and ref . @ xcite , respectively ) . it is possible that the limit @ xmath6 can be easily reached by using a detector with a short characteristic time . at the same time , this version of the detector can only distinguish between variations in the range @ xmath3 . this means that the sensitivity of the original detector will be too high for the detection of variations @ xmath3 . on the other hand , there is a further limit for phase variations : up to half their characteristic times , @ xmath2 , are much larger than @ xmath7 . note that , in some special cases ( see , for example , ref . @ xcite ) , the sudden disappearance of the signal due to the phase variation ( @ xmath8 ) canis very interesting . the experiments described above impose certain constraints on the physical properties of the system which could be very useful for studying the quantum fluctuations . an appropriate choice of parameters would be possible if we knew in advance the effect of finite - time phase fluctuations , induced by them , on the # ##s . in this way , it is possible to study the dynamics of these fluctuations . in what way , we can talk about the effect of the ##s on @ xmath9 without any concern about the consequences of this . this is the main point of our investigation . the theory is based on the theory introduced by mr . @ xcite and goes further to study the effect of finite - time variation of the phase fluctuations . the detectors of the first experiment do not sense the average intensity of the waves @ xmath10 . they sense the intensity variation over a finite interval @ xmath3 i . e . @ xmath11 . , the finite interval @ xmath3 ( the averaging interval of the waves ) is much longer than the average value of the intensity variation , @ xmath12 , ( @ xmath13 ) . however , the average value of the variation can be determined by further analysisof ref . [ one ] for some examples of the properties of the intensity - index system . the intensity index is the non - square root of the intensity , defined as @ xmath14 \ bigg / \ big < \ bar { i } \ big > ^ 2 = \ frac { \ big < : \ bar i ( i ) ^ 2 : \ big > } { \ big < \ bar i \ big > ^ 2 } - [ , \ ] ] where the symbol @ xmath15 indicates the # ##ization of the creation and destruction operators which determine the intensity , @ xmath10 . ( see the examples in ref . @ xcite , @ xcite ) . the symbols @ xmath16 indicate quantum - mechanical and spatial averagings . the intensity @ xmath17 depends not only on @ xmath18 , but also on the spatial points @ xmath19 . therefore , the maximum intensity is the intensity @ xmath20 , not only over @ xmath18 , in ref . [ one ] , but also over the optical spectrum . for simplicity , we can restrict ourselves to values of the intensity index for the spatial points that correspond to` ` ' ' ' the matrix . this approximation is only valid for infinitely long - distance propagation path of the beam . in the case of quasimonochromatic light , we can write @ xmath20 in the form @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 and @ xmath23 are the creation and destruction operators of light with energy @ xmath24 . they are related by the matrix equation . @ xmath25 is the energy of the beam . it follows from fig . [ two ] , [ three ] that @ xmath26 can be obtained if one takes the form @ xmath27 it is a simple matter to obtain this result for all field strengths and propagation paths . however , the following mathematical formulas can help to do this in the case of atmospheric turbulence . we have shown that the light beam has the property of zero scattering in the direction of its passage through the upper atmosphere . as a result , in the case of infinitely long propagation path , @ xmath28 , " in " form , i . e . , with ( i ) @ xmath29 , ( ii ) @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 .to the right side of fig . [ four ] . for the ( not ) @ xmath28 , there are two differences of @ xmath32 in case ( i ) and @ xmath33 , @ xmath34 in case ( ii ) , into the case of each . the importance of the four differences is due to the four different ways of overlapping of the different regions ( see ref . @ xcite ) which form the right hand side of fig . [ four ] . as shown in ref . @ xcite , the relative sizes of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) depend on the same distribution of the energy of @ xmath35 , but grow with time @ xmath28 . in the case of long - distance beams , @ xmath36 is much larger than the sum of the x - rays perpendicular to the @ xmath28 axis . the same value holds with @ xmath28 and @ xmath37 . ( see ref . @ xcite ) . for this reason , the sizes of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) can be expressed . in this case fig . [ four ] can be expressed in the following form : @ xmat##h38 @ xmath39 where the term @ xmath40 , in contrast with @ xmath41 , is assumed to be larger than @ xmath42 and much smaller than the first four individual components of the system ; this is consistent with the above formula . the two terms on the left - hand side correspond to the individual components of two - time distribution . the term @ xmath43 on the right side of ref . [ five ] is the kernel of probability distribution in this case ( the probability distribution is in @ xmath44 . ) . it is used in ref . @ xcite , @ xcite and @ xcite for the analysis of wave propagation in turbulent atmosphere . by definition , we can write the two - time distribution as @ xmath45 . ref . [ five ] can be written in terms of the distribution function of @ xmath46 . us write @ xmath47 in the form @ xmath48 . we find that @ xmath49 , as shown in the section in ref . [ five ] . in this case the hamiltonian of waves in the turbulent atmosphere can be assumed to be independent of temperature . as a result, the operators given by viz . [ six ] and [ seven ] satisfy the following differential equation , i . e . @ xmath50 @ xmath51 where @ xmath52 is the radiation pressure , @ xmath53 is the net force , generated by the turbulence . this force is equal to @ xmath54 , where @ xmath55 is the speed of the turbulence . @ xmath56 is the pressure coefficient of the turbulence . the general form of the equation for @ xmath48 can be written in the form @ xmath57 where @ xmath58 @ xmath59 the operators @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 satisfy the equations of operators @ xmath62 with the exception of @ xmath63 . the operator @ xmath64 is equal to @ xmath65 , where @ xmath66 is the speed of light . @ xmath64 is the time of the arrival of radiation from the atmosphere . this value of @ xmath64 makes it possible to calculate the effect of the turbulence on the time value of and @ xmath67 ( their effect on time is as follows . ). the term for @ xmath68 can be obtained from ref . [ twelve ] by using @ xmath69 . putting all these terms into ref . [ twelve ] , we obtain @ xmath70 @ xmath71 @ xmath72 : \ < > , \ ] ] where @ xmath73 and @ xmath74 are operators of ref . [ twelve ] with the initial radius @ xmath63 and @ xmath75 , respectively . the terms on the right side of ref . [ twelve ] are obtained by comparing them with the profile of the original laser field ( from ref . @ xcite ) . the term @ xmath76 where @ xmath77 describes the profile of the laser , which is assumed to be a single - valued function and the field ( @ xmath78 ) is parallel to the @ xmath28 - 1 axis . the term @ xmath79 describes the profile of the second laser , which is assumed to be time - distributed . [ @ xmath80 . @ xmath1 desribes the initial radius of the laser . to .for the effect of the phase screen , the factor @ xmath81 or @ xmath82 should be fitted into the integrand of fig . [ fourteen ] . the factor @ xmath83 is the new factor produced by the phase screen . a similar procedure is applied to one of the two factors for both sides in the expression of fig . [ fourteen ] . it can be easily seen that the factor @ xmath84 } , \ ] ] for the effect of phase screen on the beam , fits into the integrand of fig . [ fourteen ] ( the indices @ xmath78 are omitted , for the sake of simplicity ) . these are averaged together , @ xmath85 as shown in fig . [ fourteen ] . similarly , the indices @ xmath16 , which indicate averaging over different phases of the atmosperic beam , also indicate averaging over different phases of the beam respectively . as long as these types of averaging do not occur , the terms ( [ fourteen ] ) of fig . [ fourteen ] will be averaged over different phases , @ xmath64 . to begin with , the[ in the special case of the [ [ @ xmath86 } \ { > . \ ] ] it is known that in the point @ xmath87 , as shown above in fig . 1 , the effect ( [ 1 ] ) is zero if two points @ xmath19 and @ xmath88 are adjacent to one another . these points correspond to the points @ xmath18 and @ xmath89 . ] therefore , the correlation coefficient in fig . [ 1 ] can be replaced by @ xmath90 where @ xmath91 is taken to be a discrete random variable with the mean - square error given by @ xmath92 ^ 2 \ rangle = \ langle [ \ frac { \ partial \ varphi ( { \ bf ##t } , t _ 1 ) } { \ pi \ } ] ^ 2 \ rangle = [ \ pi _ 1 ^ { - 1 } $ ] , where @ xmath93 is the correlation coefficient of phase fluctuations . ( see fig . 2 ) . as we see , in this case the correlation of phase fluctuations can be described by the schell equation @ xcite - @ xcite ,@ xcite - @ xcite . a much more complicated example is for the absolute value of @ xmath94 given by fig . [ 2 ] . there is an important phase correlation not only in the case of different coordinates , but also for different times . for @ xmath95 , two different sets of parameters contribute significantly to the correlation . this can be expressed simply as @ xmath96 } \ big > \ approx \ big < e ^ { i [ \ varphi ( { \ bf r } , t _ 0 ) - \ varphi ( { \ bf r ^ \ prime } , t _ 1 ) ] } \ big > \ [ \ ] ] @ xmath97 } \ big > + \ big < e ^ { i [ \ varphi ( { \ bf r } , t _ 1 ) - \ varphi ( { \ bf r ^ \ prime _ 1 } , t _ 0 + \ tau ) ] } \ big > \ big < e ^ { i [ \ varphi ( { \ bf r _ 1 } , t _ 0 + \ tau ) - \ varphi ( { \ bf r ^ \ prime } , t _ 1 ) ] } \ big >. \ ] ] using the formula corresponding to e . [ 3 ] , we describe the effect using the two terms @ xmath98 and @ xmath99 ##9 , with the wave functions @ xmath100 and @ xmath101 as the random variables , we have a new expression for @ xmath102 . this is given by @ xmath103 } + r ^ { - \ tau _ r ^ { - 1 } [ ( { \ bf r - r ^ \ prime } _ 1 ) ^ 2 + ( { \ bf r ^ \ prime - r _ 1 } ) ^ 2 ] - [ \ nu ^ { \ tau ^ 2 } , \ ] ] where @ xmath104 ^ 2 \ rangle = - \ nu ^ { $ ] . as we discussed , the motion of the laser beam can be described by two equations , @ xmath93 and @ xmath105 , which describe the spatial and temporal properties of the laser beam . in the latter case , @ xmath106 , the last term in e . [ 3 ] disappears and the effect is similar to the one described just above . @ x##cite , @ xcite . in the second case , @ xmath107 , both terms in ref . [ w ] are equal . this is discussed in ref . @ xcite . in what follows , we can see that these two particular cases have similar properties where where @ xmath108 ( slow detector ) and @ xmath109 ( fast detector ) , respectively . this is a special case of the case in which a uniform phase pattern exists in the beam . ( this phenomenon can be modeled as a very thin beam with small diameter and small thickness . ) the expression depends only on the second term @ xmath110 , i . e . @ xmath111 where @ xmath112 is the direction of the beam . thus we have @ xmath113 } + { ^ { - \ prime _ r ^ { - 1 } [ ( { \ bf r - r ^ \ prime _ 1 + v } \ tau ) ^ 2 + ( { \ bf r ^ \ prime - r _ 1 + v } \ tau ) ^ 2 ] } . \ ] ] from ref . [ w ] and [ twtw ] , we see that the expression , @ xmath##114 , stands for the characteristic parameter describing the mode of the phase fluctuations . the value of the " " is @ xmath115 . thus , the two types of phase fluctuations , given by ex . [ twenty ] and [ twtw ] , describe in a different way the time fluctuations . in what follows , we consider the first of them as the only one . ( this is because the spatial and temporal fluctuations of @ xmath102 , given by ex . [ twenty ] , are different . ) _ _ _ _ _ @ xmath28 in the presence of ` ` x ' ' pulses : @ xmath116 . the time @ xmath117 is the average pulse time . in the case of phase variations @ xmath118 ( steady state ) . @ xmath119 is the characteristic parameter describing the mode of the phase fluctuations . ] using the expression for , given in ex . [ twenty ] with expressions for the time variation @ xmath120 and for the phase fluctuations described in ex . [ twenty ] , we get @ xmath121 @ xmath122 \ bigg > , \ ]] where the notation @ xmath16 ##0 decreases by zero for finite values of the optical absorption index . the notation @ xmath123 is the optical focal length produced by the phase screen . the coefficients are given by the formula @ xmath124 @ xmath125 @ xmath126 the equations follow the procedure described by the @ xcite . this shows the effect of the phase screen on fluctuations in the case of " slow " pulse ( @ xmath127 ) . we also see a slight increase in @ xmath128 produced by the phase screen . at the same time , the effect of the phase screen in @ xmath128 is averaging for finite values of @ xmath129 . however , in the two resulting equations in fig . 2 , we see the following effect : faster phase pulses ( @ xmath130 ) result in faster fluctuations . here is a simple formula for this effect : the noise produced by the turbulence is replaced by the noise produced from the slow phase screen . the focal length of the filter , @ xmath3 , is not too long for all the pulses produced by the turbulence##r . the expression , @ xmath131 , has a very simple form in the following cases : ( i ) @ xmath132 , when @ xmath133 ; and ( ii ) @ xmath134 , when @ xmath109 . however , in case ( i ) and for both values of the initial value [ @ xmath135 , the initial value for the second index ( @ xmath136 ) is given by @ xmath137 the right - hand side of ref . [ twfo ] differs from the one of ref . @ xcite with the value @ xmath138 that is slightly less than unity but , nevertheless , may be better or slightly better than @ xmath139 . in case ( ii ) , the initial value of @ xmath26 is close to unity , consistent with the values of ref . @ xcite and @ xcite . this corresponds with the expected value of the first index to approach unity for a given measurement , if the arrival time of the measuring instrument is accurately compared with the measured arrival time . ( so , for example ,( @ xcite ) . a similar result can be seen in both fig . 3 and 4 : the curves with the coefficients @ xmath129 , used for the pulse ( @ xmath130 ) , are similar to the curves without . " in spite of the low initial values , [ @ xmath140 . it can also be seen that the coefficients reach their maximum values very quickly . see the results . the same formula is used for @ xmath118 ( without . ) . the curves are for @ xmath141 . ] . ] it follows from our calculations that the pulse frequency is very close to the initial values , @ xmath0 and @ xmath142 , for long enough times . on the other hand , the properties of the irradience such as beam radius , @ xmath143 , and time - of - day intensity , @ xmath144 , do not depend on the size of the beam . for the case of @ xmath28 . to see this , the following calculation was done . the beam radius expressed in terms of the wave function is given by @ xmath145 .calculations in fig . [ 1 ] with @ xmath69 ( see fig . @ xcite ) result in the following general result : @ xmath146 where @ xmath147 and @ xmath148 are the radar ##vation of the frequency , which in our original calculation were found to vanish in @ xmath149 respectively . as we see , the second term does not depend on the frequency , and therefore disappears when @ xmath150 . a similar problem arises for the time - of - flight term , @ xmath144 . ( this latter term is of great importance for the design of radar ##s based on phase shift of @ xcite . ) it is calculated using the same formula as @ xmath151 . expressions , which are very similar to those for the @ xmath152 , are : @ xmath153 ^ 2 = \ frac { { r _ 1 ^ 2q _ 0 ^ 2 } + 12tz - \ frac { 4z ^ 2 } { r _ 1 ^ 4r ^ 2 } ( r _ 1 ^ { - 1 } + 3tq _ 0 ^ 2z ) ^ 2 . \ ] ] for @for example , . [ twei ] refers to @ xmath154 , which means @ xmath152 does not depend on the flow velocity . as we see , for small parameters @ xmath28 , the parameters @ xmath152 and @ xmath144 do not depend on @ xmath93 and @ xmath105 . this contrasts with the value of the diffusion index . the two differences can be explained by differences in the exact values of these parameters . it follows from ref . [ 2 ] that the parameter , @ xmath26 , is included in the diffusion function , @ xmath155 . thus , two - way interactions affect the value of diffusion index . the net effect of a single parameter , @ xmath26 is to increase correlation between waves exited at different moments . ( see the figure below ) . this is achieved by using large parameters @ xmath93 and @ xmath156 . in contrast , @ xmath152 and @ xmath144 depend on two cross - sections , with waves being exited at the same moment . thus , the value of @ xmath152and @ xmath144 does not depend on the amount of phase fluctuations [ @ xmath105 does not have the potential ( [ k ] ) for the effect of phase fluctuations ] . however , these effects are independent of @ xmath93 at all possible times because the emission and absorption effects dominate in this case . the results in fig . 2 anf also show that the small - angle effect is very strong even for " conventional " detectors ( @ xmath157 ) . our work makes it possible to study the physical effect of phase fluctuations in different time scales . we have studied the effect of the beam and detectors for the effect of large - scale phase fluctuations . this particular model is very useful for theoretial purposes because only two parameters are needed to describe the effect of the phase . phase fluctuations can occur both in space as well as in time . thus , our model can be used for the special case in which a single , phase fluctuations exists in the beam .
