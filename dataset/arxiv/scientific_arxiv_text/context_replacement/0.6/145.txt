the observation of ultracold matter waves can also , also theoretically , be performed on microchip - like surfaces @ xcite . in these cases , the complex structure of the surrounding atomic structure wins over the simple , high energy matter wave propagation @ xcite . one of the main advantages of designing a ` ` atom chip ' ' to perform atom optics is the ability to transport light from one molecular optical interface to another . first , we perform simulation of wave propagation in systems with small holes because of the changes to the electron chemical potential . an increase ( decrease ) in the tranverse wave energy results in a decrease ( increase ) in the wave energy along the path of wave propagation , increasing effective path length at the interface . the theoretical work is motivated in two areas . firstly , the studies have revealed the spatial dependence of the bose - einstein coupling ( bec ) in the region very close to the interface @ xcite , due , at least in part , to defects created during the initial fabrication process @ xcite . secondly , to better understand some of the modifications to the atom optics devices that are based on defects of the original design , for example , the time varying and nonlinearthe point contact has been proposed as a single - point - contact surface geometry for the @ xcite . however , the research has been done in multimode media of many of the different surface geometries , and it has been already shown that drilling a hole in the hole will result in the transverse effects of the bec @ xcite . to understand the impact of these effects , first we use the schrdinger wave model of waves with step - up , barrier - like and well - defined structures in the direction of propagation . there have also been some experimental studies of time - independent equations of wave propagation in various directions such as a curve ( step - up ) and a sharp curve ( not step - down ) in the limit of non - interacting atoms @ xcite , and non - interacting ( barrier - like ) structures in the barrier - like limit have also been studied @ xcite . the advantages of using smooth geometry whilst avoiding atom - atom interactions are that the time - independent equations can be used to calculate the propagation and propagation parameters . under these assumptions , we have already described the circular structure @ xcite , which consists of an abrupt curvefrom the center , into the surface and at high - temperatures , like a liquid crystal . our multimode model , adapted as it is to the the classical theory , provides a model for propagation of bec waves through non - one - dimensional ( 1 - d ) systems with the same degrees of freedom . for example , several space - based experiments have shown non - linear wave propagation through narrow - band , linear and nonlinear , 1 - d systems @ xcite . these nonlinear matter systems could be modeled by using the local medium , where combinations of the various propagation modes , including the nonlinear and linear ones , should be considered . for single plane - wave propagation at high energies in the local medium , the experimental results show that the system can be from two - moded , with the interaction and interference of the modes . the high - energy spectrum is @ xmath0 ##2 , and we have a simple way to describe the interaction of the two modes that combines the interaction of the ground ##1 ##guide with the multi - mode interaction of the field . there are a number of semiconductor - based devices that can use sees @ xcite , but we use the standard ansatztaken from physics . that is , we assume that the waves consist of an effective effective potential that is positive at the surface and negative at the surface - area , so that atom - atom interactions can be observed . however , assuming that the effective potential corresponds to an effective physical potential , the waves are assumed to be coming from different boundary regions with different changes in the distance between the ends , so that the frequency and the magnitude of the boundary regions remain constant along the path . the out - of - phase wave function is not a physical quantity . we consider the fourier expansion ( sho ) effective potential , which , for step - like or well - like effective potential , is given by @ xmath1 the step - like potential has @ xmath2 ; the well - like potential has @ xmath3 . the well - like potential consists of only a change in length . these equations are equivalent in this case , where frequencies are in units of @ xmath4 , and lengths are also in units of @ xmath5 . an effective well - like potential is shown in fig . [ 1 : abruptpot ] ( 2 ) , where theand frequency with @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 . ( a ) the energy levels of the barrier - led leads with @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 and focal length @ xmath8 . ( b ) energy levels of the sho and anti - sho leads with @ xmath9 . the dashed lines along @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 should be drawn , but they are drawn at an angle to represent the actual barrier focal length . the red - shaded lines correspond to the phase - shift phase ( for an infinite direct current ) . all the energies and frequencies are given in terms of ground states for the region . , [ = 336 ] the measured energy levels of fig . ( [ eqn : pots2d ] ) are shown in fig . [ 1 : abruptpot ] ( 2 ) . these energy levels serve as reference energies for the classical model since we relate the electronic wavefunction of each state to the corresponding ground state . in this model , the interaction between states occurs through the interaction between states . the energies of fig . ( [ eqn : pots2d ] ) are shown in @ xmath12 .that phase factor @ xmath12 was doubled , improving the theoretical accuracy and scale . [ the transfer - matrix values in fig . [ 1 : abruptpot ] ( 2 ) are not parallel to the phase factor ] . in addition , they would very well be off - center , resulting in distortion of the region ( as was seen in our earlier calculations of the solar system @ xcite ) . the underlying principle , however , remained essentially the same , and we decided to use phase - factor methods with the plane wave confined to the first ( normal ) harmonic phase . to perform the time - independent wave , we first used the transfer matrix method @ xcite , although most of the calculations described in this article use the phase matrix method @ xcite . the two methods are different , however , and since the transfer matrix method is the interpretation of our calculations , we compare them directly . the expansion of the transfer matrix method from one - dimensional to almost all degrees of freedom is performed @ xcite , but only a short ##cut is needed , and it leads to a flat / disk - shaped region of interest @ xmath13 . finally , the time - independent wavefunction is extended to the sho ##als, @ xmath14 for : @ xmath15 , and @ xmath16 for @ xmath17 : @ xmath18 \ quad z \ le z _ 0 \ ; , \ \ \ psi _ \ mathrm { i } ( x , z ) & = \ sum _ n \ kappa _ m ( x ) \ ; \ big [ d _ n e ^ { i \ kappa _ m ( z - z _ 0 ) } + h _ m e ^ { - i \ kappa _ m ( z - z _ 1 ) } \ big ] \ quad z _ 0 \ quad z \ le z _ 0 \ ; , \ \ \ psi _ \ mathrm { ii } ( x , z ) & = \ sum _ n \ varphi _ m ( x ) \ ; \ big [ d _ n e ^ { i k _ n ( z - z _ 0 ) } + h _ m e ^ { - i k _ n ( z - z _ 0 ) } \ big ] \ quad z _ 0 \ quad [ \ ; . \ quad { . } \ ] ] where the coefficients are @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 . then the wavefunctions and theirthe scattering of each mode and then sorting of the modes into the following set of coefficients : @ xmath21 the scattering coefficients of this submatrix are @ xmath22 using the method @ xmath23 . since different methods are provided for the calculation of sho - modes with different energies @ xcite ( these functions are usually expressed in terms of energies of the orbital ##s @ xcite ) , we perform the same calculation by using the s - mode method . the transfer matrix is obtained by solving the scattering matrix @ xmath24 , which if solved leads with the , @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 , to the two leads , @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 . assuming that the beam is close to coming from @ xmath29 to the third leads ( @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 , and @ xmath32 ) , the scattering equation @ xmath33 is solved , and solved @ xmath34 . the transfer and scattering coefficients for each leads are then given by : @ xmath35 there are some problems with the scattering matrix method , the description and application of which is largely confined to the literature . seehowever , the coefficients are due to the exponential coupling of the sho ##al @ xmath36 with @ xmath37 , which requires the use of strongly closed channels , leading to the generation of large errors in the transfer matrix . although the transfer matrix method avoids the need to include intermediate coefficients ( ie . @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 ) , it is still known to be accurate for the majority of the systems discussed in this paper . the interface matching method , by contrast , only accounts for the intermediate coefficients and is able to include strongly closed channels to achieve very high - accuracy calculations for the range of channels and systems discussed in this paper . the transfer matrix method works well , however , for step - like systems with a single barrier ( ie . @ xmath40 ) . there are large errors in the matrix method , and thus , often the coefficients are not solved for . the multimoded scattering and interaction mechanisms for three different systems are discussed in this paper : the step - like potential , the flow - like potential and the flow - like potential . the calculations for the step - like potential use the transfer matrix method , while interface matching is used for thewell - like and the bad - like mode . by doing these calculations , it is possible to see how the mode and @ xmath36 vary with frequency . the @ xmath36 dependence on the frequency of @ xmath41 is important , since it directly affects the amount of path overlap caused by the ground modes . using the orthonormality of the sho eigenstates , together with the fourier coefficients of the hermite polynomials , it can be shown that the path dependence of the @ xmath42 ground modes with the @ xmath17 ground modes leads to the following simple form : @ xmath43 for the @ xmath44 . due to this , @ xmath45 for @ xmath46 . ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) was first calculated by aslangul @ xcite . the dependence of the second mode , ( @ xmath47 ) on frequency is shown in fig . [ 3 : omegadependence ] ( 2 ) . sho wavefunction ##s @ xmath48 with the first mode with constant frequency @ xmath42 , and the second with constant frequency @ xmath##17 . ( a ) shows the @ xmath47 frequency as a function of @ xmath17 . the numbers followed by @ xmath49 represent the frequency . ( b ) shows the frequency as a function of @ xmath37 for four modes : @ xmath50 ( square ) , @ xmath51 ( empty - square ) , @ xmath52 ( empty - square ) and @ xmath53 ( triangle ) . the gaps and gaps in ( a ) are used to focus the eye . the units used for both ( a ) and ( b ) are given by [ x equal to @ xmath15 . , x = 336 ] for @ xmath54 , this is a perfect solving mode , and we can substitute @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 for @ xmath57 . as @ xmath17 increases , @ xmath58 monotonically decreases towards 0 . at the same time , the overlap with each other also increases and reaches a maximum when the last mode , @ xmath59 , is solved . as a function of time , these gaps converge at @ xmath60 , which , for @ xmath##61 , is @ xmath62 and for @ xmath63 , is @ xmath64 . plotting the values ( @ xmath65 ) of the sho ##als at these points against the ground mode energy shows that @ xmath66 . this plot , while useful , is not very illuminating and is not developed further any further . at the poles , the values gradually decrease from @ xmath67 to 48 . due to expansion of the system @ xmath41 , a new value of @ xmath48 then appears for @ xmath68 . the full convergence of the system with the ground mode can be seen in fig . [ fig : omegadependence ] ( 2 ) . this means that , even at high energies , only two modes must be used in the phase transition to achieve the convergence . the transmission and reflection energies , @ xmath69 and @ xmath70 , of ground mode s - waves in the slit - like channels are shown in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] . at the energies above the critical energy level ( @ xmath71 , the maximum ground mode energy ) , the system .##s is the standard 3 - mode confinement model . ground mode transmission , @ xmath72 , is the same , in the range of frequencies shown in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ( a ) ( for the case of @ xmath17 shown below ) , although the mode reflection can also be seen in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ( b ) as the mode opens . the reflection is reflected into the mode @ xmath73 shown in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ( a ) , which then falls away from there . as the new mode opens , the reflection into the excited mode @ xmath74 , shown in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ( a ) , opens , which is used to show the mode reflection . all of which is consistent with the standard model ##s for multichannel transmission @ xcite . multimoded two modes of mirror - beam transmission which consist of a significant phase change in the overall confinement potential from @ xmath42 to @ xmath50 , @ xmath75 , @ xmath76 , and @ xmath77 . the two modes are in the ground mode @ x##math78 . ( a ) shows @ xmath72 and @ xmath79 , the transmission probability into the ground mode and the sum of the reflection probability into the excited modes , respectively . ( b ) shows @ xmath80 , the reflection probability into the ground mode , and ( c ) shows @ xmath81 , the sum of the reflection probability into the excited modes . the total energy @ xmath82 is , in si units equal to @ xmath15 . the values of ( a ) and ( b ) give the total transmission and reflection probability for the 2 - d background potential for the frequency of @ xmath52 ( viz . of 1 @ xmath83 with the background potential @ xmath84 used to determine the maximum ground mode energy ) . , [ = 336 ] for frequencies in the ground mode , the total energy is @ xmath0 in the lower frequency limit . in this case the reflection probability is given instead by @ xmath85 with the sho ##al of 2 . ( [ eqn : 2 ] ) . these limits were introduced as part of the firstexperiments of jskelinen and stenholm @ xcite , in which the maximum power was reached by the transition and front - end ##s were temporarily suspended as the transition moved towards zero . these multimode effects have also been successfully observed during transformation of the bec from a microtrap into a full @ xcite , with particular emphasis on the effects of atom - atom interactions . the ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) can be seen in the low - energy behavior of the matrix elements of @ xmath86 , given by : . ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) . for sufficiently small changes to the step length , the energies of the first two modes are approximately the same on both sides of the transition , @ xmath87 . assuming that the energies determine the number of modes involved , the matrix elements that form the @ xmath40 - cycle are : @ xmath88 , and @ xmath89 . for an incoming wave in the ground state with @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 , and @ xmath90 , all the incoming modes are @ xmath91 , @ xmath##92 . to more fully illustrate this concept , the results of fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] are replotted in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] using an energy scale corresponding to @ xmath17 instead of @ xmath15 so that the two components for each mode are of the same total energy . the result consists of the same three pair - wise components as fig . [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ( @ xmath50 , @ xmath75 , @ xmath76 , and @ xmath77 ) spelled out as a multiple of @ xmath93 , where @ xmath94 . for the components , ( a ) are the scattering energies of the ground mode , ( b ) the sum of the ground mode scattering energies @ xmath79 , and ( c ) the total scattering energy @ xmath95 . the values for @ xmath96 correspond to the @ xmath97 . [ . , x = 336 ] at these energies , the scattering energy shown in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] ( .) , towards maximum of @ xmath98 , in accordance with fig . ( [ eqn : project ] ) . for the transmission mode systems shown above , the modes are @ xmath99 , @ xmath100 , @ xmath101 , and @ xmath102 . both [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] ( b ) and ( c ) show that at the end of a transmission mode ( cf . , @ xmath103 etc . ) the signal flux into that mode increases , exceeding that from before . the increase in the wavefunctions for @ xmath52 , for example , is particularly significant , with @ xmath104 , @ xmath105 , @ xmath106 , and @ xmath107 [ see fig . [ fig : omegadependence ] ( c ) ] . in this case , these four transmission modes must be reached . the maximum frequency of [ @ xmath108 , as per fig . ( [ eqn : project ] ) ] is sufficient to reach @ xmath109 . whether the transmission is coming from the source orthe converse , these results hold . the reflection mode mixing @ xmath110 is _ _ true _ as a function of the energy @ xmath82 for both the phase space ( ie . step - up from @ xmath42 to @ xmath111 ) , and the harmonic ##s ( ie . step - down from @ xmath112 to @ xmath54 ) this result also holds for the corresponding 2 - dimensional harmonic ##s , and , although we do not see it explicitly , the transmission and reflection mode mixing helps to show this is not the case for the multichannel case . the mode mixing as a function of @ xmath82 is identical for this case , however , since for the step - up , there can be many transmission channels open at the highest possible frequency , @ xmath113 , and for the step - down , there can be many transmission channels open at @ xmath113 . for higher frequencies , neither of the two cases has limits , and for points in the plane , the results from above . ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) . . to understand the properties of the simple step - down case , weconsider the potential shown in fig . [ fig : abruptpot ] , for a fixed length @ xmath114 and for that range from @ xmath42 to @ xmath2 and back to @ xmath42 . we also consider the wave - like characteristics for scattering from this potential . the phase and scattering characteristics for the wave with @ xmath50 , @ xmath75 , @ xmath76 , @ xmath77 and for @ xmath115 are shown in fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] . multimoded scattering consists of the wave - like characteristics with @ xmath50 , @ xmath75 , @ xmath76 , and @ xmath77 for a fixed length @ xmath115 as a function of @ xmath82 ( in si units equal to @ xmath15 ) . the legend for the scattering amplitude is the same as fig . ( [ fig : stepwithenergy ] ) and ( [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] ) . the legend of the amplitude is also the same as fig . ( [ fig: stepwithenergy ] ) . the lines of ( a ) and ( b ) are the corresponding transmission and reflection lines for the 1 - d barrier potential for the modes of @ xmath116 ( fig . of the @ xmath117 with the barrier of @ xmath84 ) . , [ = 336 ] and occur for all of the modes at different energies due to the phase difference at @ xmath118 . the 1 - d transmission lines for @ xmath116 , fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] ( a ) represent the magnetic field at the source of high - energy single - channel transmission through the barrier . as soon as the @ xmath42 , @ xmath119 gap appears at @ xmath120 , however , multichannel transmission takes place ( @ xmath121 is not connected due to symmetry ) . at @ xmath120 , there is only one channel propagation [ fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] ( a ) ] , and the effects of conversion into the ground state [ fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] ( b ) ] and the excited mode [ fig . [ fig : barrier##withenergy ] ( c ) ] is only at the energy limit . to reach the high - energy limit , the measurements for the @ xmath52 mode of fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] were taken to higher energies , and are shown in fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergyscaled ] with the energy measured for @ xmath122 . the total energy of the @ xmath52 , @ xmath115 , mirror - image modes shown in fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergy ] shown above is a peak of @ xmath93 where @ xmath122 . ( a ) shows the total transmission probability of the @ xmath123 modes and the sum of the transmission probability for the @ xmath124 modes . ( b ) shows the ground - mode transmission probability as well as the sum of the ground mode transmission probability . the peaks of ( c ) correspond to the @ xmath125 ground - mode and ##s of fig . ( [ eqn : interf ] ) . the second peak of @ xmath126 has energies up to 4 , which is not possible due to thethe model [ of the fig . , d = 336 ] in [ fig : barrierwithenergyscaled ] ( d ) shows that although there is more variation to the reflection probability than for the step - wise models in fig . [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] ( d ) , the total distribution of reflection probability decreases towards 0 as more barrier modes are added to @ xmath127 . to obtain an equation similar to fig . ( [ eqn : project ] ) , we must take into account the fact that the electromagnetic waves passing through the barrier have at least two phase transitions as in fig . ( [ eqn : project ] ) . the processes changing and increasing the width @ xmath114 of the barrier can also be included in such a model , which means that at higher frequencies ( relative to the barrier mode ) @ xmath128 where @ xmath37 is then averaged over the two barrier modes . the models shown in fig . [ fig : barrierwithenergyscaled ] ( d ) show that the two - dimensional version of this model does a better job of calculating the reflection probability at the @ xmath61 threshold ##s ( the @xmath129 ) . depending on the phase difference , the electrons that are reflected by the first interface can be converted back to the excited state at the second interface . we have seen this effect for circular hole bends @ xcite , where the amount of reflection could be reduced by tuning the hole made up of the hole to the point where the total phase difference between the @ xmath130 and @ xmath121 holes is a multiple of @ xmath131 . a similar theoretical consideration could also be made for # ##ic bends such as the red dot bend @ xcite , where the small but significant harmonic distortion could be reduced by varying the potential of the hole in different directions . the resonance and reflection problems for well - formed reflections due to the phase difference ( @ xmath132 ) are the same in this next section . the reflection problem for the semiconductor is illustrated by the existence of coherent states which feed into the concept of feshbach states in the multichannel circuit . much of the reflection theory discussed here has been previously discussed as part of our understanding of the circular hole bend @ xcite . the fundamental conditions for this effect are thesmaller than the standard length @ xcite , resulting in very narrow ground states and very narrow resonance . the resulting well - designed system will have narrow transitions between the background and background energy levels , and thus the possibility of very narrow transitions is below the threshold . two transitions are shown below , the first from @ xmath133 to @ xmath54 and back to @ xmath133 , and the second with @ xmath134 to @ xmath54 and back to @ xmath134 . in both cases , we take @ xmath54 to be the peak scattering energy , to make the comparison with the states in the previous figure . the scattering and absorption energies of both of these states with fixed length @ xmath115 are shown in fig . [ 2 : wellwithenergy ] . multimoded scattering energies of the barrier - free states with @ xmath133 and @ xmath75 for a fixed length @ xmath115 are a multiple of @ xmath82 ( in si units equal to @ xmath17 ) . the amplitude of the scatteringis the same as above . [ see : stepwithenergyscaled ] . the equations of ( 1 ) correspond to the @ xmath125 two - mode interference effects of interest . ( [ eqn : interf ] ) for @ xmath134 . , [ = 336 ] . @ xmath0 ##3 will occur at energies below the first - in - line , ie . below @ xmath135 for @ xmath133 and @ xmath136 for @ xmath134 . as already noted in our molecular motion model @ xcite , the interference effects for the second excited mode ( ie . below @ xmath137 for @ xmath133 , and below @ xmath138 for @ xmath134 ) do not result in any interference due to the weak interaction between the first and second excited modes and due to the existence of approximate solutions to them . the second - order two mode equations for the well - known model are also given by : . ( [ eqn : interf ] ) , although the position of the second excited mode in the model indicates that the two - mode interference effects at @ x##math120 ( in other words , at a higher energy than for the corresponding barrier - like potential ) . the two - mode model is shown in fig . [ fig : wellwithenergy ] ( a ) for the @ xmath134 potential , and is considered to be a good approximation at the @ xmath120 threshold due to the large reflection effect . the two - mode model also provides a good approximation at higher energies when the peak transmission probability has fallen below the second excited mode transmission probability , and also when the two other ##band resonances no longer play a role . models with more complex properties such as @ xmath139 and @ xmath77 were also studied . they exhibit so many variations over the range of energies shown in fig . [ fig : wellwithenergy ] , a , that the transmission and reflection effects can form a continuous series of equally - spaced periodic spikes . at energies near the second excited mode threshold ( @ xmath140 ) , there are not as many spikes , although there is some reflection there . as an example , the @ xmath141 , @ xmath115 , barrier - like potential has a large reflection1 ) @ xmath142 ( @ xmath143 ) that is now broken down to about @ xmath144 . this reflection probability can be compared with the @ xmath52 , @ xmath115 barrier - like potential in general . [ 1 : barrierwithenergyscaled ] ( 2 ) @ @ xmath142 ( @ xmath96 ) , where the maximum reflection probability is now about @ xmath145 . in other words , they play a much more important role for the well - known potential than the barrier - like . using time - dependent solutions of the schrdinger equation , we have studied the behavior of compact , ultracold ideal gases with rapidly changing transverse potential . several papers have described the potential for ` ` abrupt ' ' gas flow in microstructures ( eg . ) . in general , the interest here is in the use of abrupt ' ##s for gas flow with a tendency towards the molecular level , in the possibility of changing transverse potential in the ##istic systems , and also to study the properties of these molecular devices . for ideal gases with changes in the transverseguiding potential has been the subject of research : beam - like , beam - like and beam - like . the transverse - frequency behavior of all the modes differs from single - moded , with the exception of the interference behavior at frequencies with the highest possible energy . the coupling of the ground and the excited modes was caused by the overlap of the modes at the interfaces of the atom ##s . the significant coupling to these modes was due to the large overlap of the ground sho function of different frequencies with the excited sho function with a different frequency . therefore , care should be taken during the bonding of atom ##ized ##es to ensure that any significant ( or accidental ) changes in the modes ' behavior are not abrupt . high frequency wave propagation through guiding potential leads to @ xmath0 wave propagation via interference at the interface , combined with multimode interference . the ground sho - based methods behave very differently than the thin - film methods for the wave propagation in systems with an ultra - thin interface ( see ref . @ xcite , and the sections below that describe them ) . in that case , impedence interference occurs , where there is also large amount of interference at high frequencies due to thenote that the narrow guide modes will not match the wide guide modes over the entire length of the beam . although , to the best of our knowledge , models for conventional laser beams have never included high - energy / wave - transmission and guide modes . a simple solution was developed for high energy transmission through microstructures with multiple modes to account for the differences between them . it was found that a simple multi - mode model would be a reasonable approximation to the efficiency of the wave transmission , and was an important basis for the development of ` ` atom - based ' ' techniques to enable multi - moded wave - transmission through interfaces that carry multimoded signals . this work was supported by the department of the navy , office of naval research , and also by the scientific community . our transfer matrix program was developed by comparing the multi - mode model of wave transmission with a linear combination of 1 - d potentials @ xcite , and also by comparison with multi - moded 1 - d signals from the experimental analysis of @ xcite . the multimode transfer matrix program , however , has encountered many problems as the number of modes used in the calculation increases . this result can be seen in the [ tab : transcon##v ] , for cases with no barrier , @ xmath82 has a barrier - free match with @ xmath146 of + @ xmath147 . the unitarity of the scattering potential can differ significantly from @ xmath148 , even though @ xmath149 is shorter . the following two methods are used for matching , and they arise from the following equations . lcccc & & + @ xmath149 & @ xmath150 & unitarity & @ xmath150 & unitarity + + 1 & 0 . 00339154 & & 0 . 999976 & + + 2 & 0 . 00381548 & 0 . 2394 @ xmath151 & 0 . 124973 & 0 . 2500 @ xmath152 + 2 & 0 . 00267029 & 0 . 0328 @ xmath153 & 0 . 772832 & 0 . 2616 @ xmath154 + 2 & 0 . 00274164 & 0 . 8303 @ xmath155 & 0 . 804769 & 0 . 1844 @ xmath151 + 2 & 0. 00274223 & 0 . 1060 @ xmath155 & 0 . 807601 & 0 . 4533 @ xmath156 + 1 & 0 . 00264476 & 0 . 4352 @ xmath157 & 0 . 849707 & 0 . 4386 @ xmath154 + + 1 & 0 . 00339154 & 0 . 3307 @ xmath158 & 0 . 999976 & 0 . 0912 @ xmath158 + 1 & 0 . 00270062 & 0 . 4129 @ xmath159 & 0 . 795176 & 0 . 3826 @ xmath154 + 1 & 0 . 00274192 & 0 . 7813 @ xmath160 & 0 . 805169 & 0 . 1198 @ xmath157 + 1 & 0 . 00274223 & 0 . 5390 @ xmath161 & 0 . 807546 & 0 . 5052 @ xmath153 + 1 & 0 . 00277009 & 1 . 0555 @ xmath157 & 0 . 916579& 1 . 6275 @ xmath154 + + 1 & 0 . 00339154 & 2 . 2204 @ xmath158 & 0 . 999976 & + + 1 & 0 . 00270062 & 1 . 1102 @ xmath158 & 0 . 795176 & 0 . 3826 @ xmath154 + 16 & 0 . 00274192 & 0 . 3307 @ xmath158 & 0 . 805169 & 4 . 1198 @ xmath157 + 16 & 0 . 00274223 & 1 & 0 . 807605 & 0 . 8357 @ xmath161 + 32 & 0 . 00274223 & 6 . 4409 @ xmath158 & 0 . 807607 & 6 . 6739 @ xmath162 + 16 & 0 . 00274223 & 1 . 1102 @ xmath158 & 0 . 807607 & 2 . 2205 @ xmath158 + in an effort to improve the transfer matrix performance , a second method for constructing the transfer matrix was developed . this second method for constructing the transfer@ xmath163 , @ xmath164 with fewer elements , @ xmath165 , and @ xmath166 . the two elements of @ xmath86 of fig . ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) were added to remove the @ xmath167 elements . the exact values of the @ xmath168 are also shown in fig [ fig : transconv ] , and the unitarity . for the multi - mode case , it is very good , if not better that @ xmath169 . for the applications studied in this paper the transfer matrix method was not able to fully converge to the full set of values . the exception to this is for the step - wise calculations , where for the two exact values in this paper ( fig . [ fig : stepwithenergyscaled ] : @ xmath170 and @ xmath142 ) @ xmath171 modes could not be calculated ( since the transfer matrix has an exponential decay , and the modes are not accounted for ) . we also note that , since the @ xmath172 modes are time dependent , calculating them is much easier for the general pattern of thethan for multiple circular - bend systems using the same method @ xcite . for the most recent circular - bend systems ( ref . [ category : barrierwithenergyscaled ] : @ xmath170 , @ xmath115 and @ xmath142 ) , the phase matching method increases unitarity to greater than @ xmath173 with @ xmath174 combined . some of the transfer matrix related problems were passingly studied in _ _ et . _ _ @ xcite , where the transfer matrix approach was first applied to a system of multiple channel bends ( the transfer function was then derived from a set of linear equations ) . in the end , however , the calculations described in ref . @ xcite were performed with multiple interface pairs . we differ on this , since no such unitarity problems were studied in the multichannel transfer matrix version of ref . @ xcite , where the results obtained were for 2 or more channel bends with delta potential . on the other hand , the advantage of the transfer matrix approach is that , in the two - channel case , one can easily compute the transfer function of both finite and infinite channel delta potential @ xcite .
