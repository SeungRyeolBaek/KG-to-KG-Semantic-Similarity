the time - born - gerlach , or , interaction of a charged particle with an e . g . electron has been shown to produce beams of electrons with different energies , corresponding to different states @ xcite . we can see how the charged particles can exchange energy with the electromagnetic field of the quantum system . let us write with @ xmath1 the coordinates of the electrons in the beam , and with @ xmath2 the coordinates of the electron rest mass , prf . for the example the electromagnetic interaction that is the action of an external electromagnetic field on a particle , with a magnetic field @ xmath3 = z _ b = ( ^ * a ) = z ( ^ * b ) + z ( ^ * a ) + z ( ^ * b ) [ fsg ] with = ge2 = ##z [ sg ] . then @ xmath4 is the electromagnetic interaction with @ xmath5 for electrons and holes , @ xmath6 , and @ xmath7 for holes and ##ons , @ xmath8 , and @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 either parallel or perpendicular to each other , .. @ xmath11 is the invariant mass of the particle , @ xmath12 the gyromagnetic moment and @ xmath13 the energy , . | = x - m = \ { ll 1 . 793 ( m = 1 . 586 ) & e , | | + + 1 . 41 10 ^ - 3 & e ^ . . [ } ] note that in fig . ( [ fsg ] ) we have written the magnetic moment as @ xmath14 in the rest frame , rather than as @ xmath15 . in the rest frame the wave function @ xmath10 , the energy , will become @ xmath16 and the term corresponding to the magnetic moment e can now be the two terms s _ main = ( - s , - s + 1 , . . . . , - - s , . ) , [ s _ main ] where @ xmath17 is the reduced term . ##nr . from fig . ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ s _ main ] ) we have for the magnetic moment , the prf = | | = 0 | , | _ m = \ { ll 1 . 41 10 ^ - 3 jt ^ - 3 ++ 1 . 5 f ^ - 1 jt ^ - 1 . . [ mumod ] for a particle moving along the field @ xmath18 , the linear transformations of the field , and of the field are \ { lll x = x & y = y & z = ( x + y ##z ) + + f _ = 1f _ & g _ = f _ & ( f _ sg = ce _ c ) [ dz ] . . [ ftransf ] the force ( [ fsg ] ) is applied to the laboratory frame at f _ sg = 1 x ( ^ * a ) + 1 y ( ^ * a ) + 1 ( ^ * a ) . [ f - sg ] because of the linear transformations of the fields @ xcite @ xmath19 and @ xmath20 \ { b _ = ( b + cb ) - ^ 2 + 1 ( b ) + + c = ( b - c ) - ^ 2 + 1 ( c ) . . [ sg ] the force in the laboratory frame @ xmath21 = ( ^ * a ) = ^ * _ x ( b _ x + ce _ x ) + ^ * _ y ( b _ x - ce _ x ) +^ * _ c _ z . [ magen ] ( fig . ( [ magen ] ) and ( [ c - z ] ) , by means of fig . ( [ dz ] ) , from these calculations we can finally obtain the # ##z field from the reference article : \ { l f _ z = ^ * _ x ( b _ xx + c e _ yx ) + ^ * _ x ( b _ yx - c e _ xx ) + 1 ^ * _ c _ zx + + f _ z = ^ * _ x ( b _ xx + c e _ yy ) + ^ * _ x ( b _ yy - c e _ xx ) + 1 ^ * _ c _ zy + + f _ z = ^ * _ c _ zx + ^ * _ yc _ zy + ^ * _ zc _ zz , . [ fsgz ] with \ { l f _ zx = ^ 1 + + f _ zy = ^ 1 + + f _ zz = ( b _ zz + c e _ zt ) . . [ czz ] these results can also be obtained from the standard field theoryof the non - @ xmath0 - particle @ xcite . let us consider the following hamiltonian : = e + ( ( p - ea ) + _ 2 ) ^ 2 [ ham1 ] we make use of the following - matrix = ( ) , _ y = ( ) , = _ z = ( ) , [ mat - d ] where @ xmath22 is the matrix whose entries are the following s : _ x = ( ) , _ y = ( ) , _ z = ( ) , [ mat - d ] @ xmath23 is the @ xmath24 - axis , @ xmath25 the - matrix and when chosen the @ xmath26 - axis corresponds to the normal magnetic moment . the above equation leads to the following standard formulation of the hamiltonian for the weak interaction with the ` ` normal ' ' magnetic moment = e + ( p - ea ) ^ 2 - ( mc ) [ hamp ] which agrees with the above equation and is valid for the prf . to complete the derivation we can relate the term from the normal magnetic moment to the potential energy term of the above equation , with the notation @ xmath27 , e - .= - ^ * - ^ * = g . [ sgenergy ] in order to obtain the @ xmath28 - component of the sg force in the laboratory frame in the direction of motion of the particle , we can obtain the explicit second part of g . ( [ hamp ] ) by applying the multiplication operator @ xmath29 to the vector space @ xcite , which is the sg force s ^ - 1 + = + ( _ 0b ) [ hilb ] that can be expressed in terms of the canonical elements of the @ xmath30 spinor matrix : = = + ( ) [ str ] with = , s = = = , s = ( = ) . [ defs ] from g . ( [ hilb ] ) and ( [ str ] ) , due to the linear properties of the @ xmath31 and @ xmath32 matrices , we obtain in the laboratory frame the - component of the sg force \ { lll } ^ - 1 ( _ 0 _ x ) s & = & _ 0 _ x + s ^ - 1 ( _ 0 _ y ) s & = & _ 0 _ y + s ^ - 1 ( _ 0 _ x ) s &= & ( _ i _ z ) + i _ 0 _ z . , [ evxyz ] with _ z = _ i _ 0 _ z _ z = + ( ) . [ g5 ] from fig . ( [ evxyz ] ) we can calculate the expectation value of the @ ##d on the quantum state with a single electron - along the @ xmath26 - axis in our case - via the expectation values of the spin matrix and of the first order operator of the usual form with _ z = _ f _ z ^ * ^ * . [ fz4 ] in our case . the first of fig . ( [ evxyz ] ) produces a non negative result , while both the second and third produce a similar result to the second , because of the existence of the two spin matrices @ xmath33 and the existence of the @ xmath32 interaction . let us consider the electromagnetic field built up in a generic high - frequency cavity , corresponding to a @ # ##v @ xcite . the dimensions are : width @ xmath13 , height @ xmath34 and length @ xmath35 , as shown in fig . [ 1 : 1 ]. along the y axis , which intersects with the z axis , the electric and magnetic fields ( @ xcite @ xmath36 \ \ \ \ b _ x & = & - { b _ 0 \ over k _ c ^ 2 } \ left ( { p \ pi \ over d } \ right ) \ sin ( { m \ pi \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { p \ pi x \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { n \ pi y \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { p \ pi x \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ , \ omega t \ \ \ \ b _ x & = & - { b _ 0 \ over k _ c ^ 2 } \ left ( { m \ pi \ over d } \ right ) \ left ( { p \ pi \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { p \ pi x \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { p \ pi x \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { p \ pi y \ over d } \ right ) \ sin \ , \ omega t \ \ \ \a _ z & = & b _ z \ sin \ right ( { p \ pi x \ over a } \ right ) \ sin \ left ( { m \ pi x \ over b } \ right ) \ sin \ right ( { p \ pi x \ over a } \ left ) \ sin \ , \ , [ \ { { 0 } \ ] ] where @ xmath37 is the maximum effective magnetic field , @ xmath11 , @ xmath38 and @ xmath39 are non - indeces , and = _ = = . [ 1 ] the peak frequency of the e . m . emitted from the wave ##guide is = _ = 2c _ = c . [ omegen ] in combination with an open cavity , in a closed cavity we can have a peak frequency @ xmath40 and a peak frequency @ xmath41 , as functions of the e . m . and the magnetic index , according to the equation = _ = c . [ rphv ] and _ = _ c _ . [ cav - wl ] it is therefore = _ _ = _ = c that @ xmath42 can have any value , usually less than c , sinceit is also based on the following two parameters . namely , in fig . ( [ omegen ] ) and ( [ rphv ] ) we have : = _ _ _ = _ _ [ cav - 1 ] which is the difference between the mode length @ xmath35 and the wavelength , as shown in fig . [ right : right ] . for example , let us set the preferred mode field @ xmath43 , . . . ( [ omegen ] ) and ( [ rphv ] ) setting this to = _ = c = _ c _ = [ ombetap ] and , for the mode length @ xmath44 , = _ = c = _ c _ = , [ ombeta1 ] which are the parameters corresponding to the mode @ xmath45 , whose two principal field components along the z axis are \ { - e _ x ( z , t ) = - b _ 0 ( ) \ + + e _ x ( z , t ) = - b _ 0 ( ) . . . [ byex ] it is important to note that with all the field components measured so far there is a clear distinction between spatial and temporal components , including that of plane waves . ., the boundary conditions of the electric and magnetic fields of the e . g . determine the direction of the field , which , in turn , is in accordance with the frequency @ xmath46 . thus , at the cavity entrance and exit the field components ( [ byex ] ) are given : \ { l a _ x ( 0 , t ) = - e _ 0 t + + e _ x ( d , t ) = 0 . . [ edge - in ] and \ { l b _ x ( 0 , t ) = - b _ 0 t = e _ 0 t + + e _ x ( d , t ) = - t = 0 . . [ edge - out ] where @ xmath47 is the relaxation constant . the energy values of @ xmath48 at the cavity entrance represent the typical values of the applied electric field . from fig . ( [ fz4 ] ) , using linear ##ization , we have tha ##ler a particle which crosses a high - frequency line , corresponding to the frequency @ xmath49 frequency , gains ( and loses ) an energy value when interacting with the field components of the ` ` edge ' ' of the cavity as in figure . [fig : vertices ] @ xcite ( z ) _ = _ 0 ^ df _ * dz = _ 0 ^ d ^ * c _ zydz = ^ d ^ * c _ d ^ * ( z + ) [ du - z ] , so that the energy is completely conserved . however , since the cavity need to be completely closed and will have slits at both ends to allow the red light to pass through and thus will have # ##s , in order to achieve the right field , it is necessary to interfere with the interaction with these slits . this is explained further below . in order to satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ edge - in ] ) and ( [ edge - out ] ) , a cavity traveling in the @ xmath45 direction must be closely matched to either an even or an odd number of field - induced pipe - slits , viz . ( [ cav - wl ] ) , as shown in fig . [ fig : vertices ] and [ fig : edges ] . example : a particle of particles enters the cavity in accordance with the second law . this means that the particle is of mass that enters the cavity at the point @ xmath50 and would exit the cavity at @ xmath##51 , 52 are field values , and b _ x ( 0 , _ ) = - b _ 0 ##g _ y ( 0 , _ ) = b _ 0 [ e - frame ] the field values at both ends decrease rapidly to zero for a short period @ xmath52 , entering the cavity ( see figure . ) we can express these # ##s as real - valued functions in the @ xmath53 - axis , since the force @ xmath54 requires for the beam to travel in this plane will be quite small in comparison with @ xmath55 , regardless of whether not the size of the cavity itself , } \ { llllll _ & = & - b _ 0g ( 0 ) & & g ( - ) = 0 , & g ( - ) = + + + _ & = & g _ 0h ( - ) & & h ( - ) = 0 , & h ( d + ) = 0 . . [ e - flds ] under these conditions , a charged particle with its spin aligned along the @ xmath26 - axis and entering the cavity will experience a net force perpendicular to the @ xmath28 - axis ( direction of spin ) , see figure . ([ fsgz ] ) c _ z = ^ * c _ zy [ fz ] where @ xmath56 is given as the limit of the value of f . ( [ czz ] ) . for the moment we assume that the cavity will lose its energy during . the fringe field @ xmath48 and its components in this region are also constantly changing , because of the boundary forces at the outside of the cavity and also the boundary forces @ xmath57 and @ xmath58 . however , the current @ xmath59 is always present in the fringe field because of its relation to @ xmath60 , with @ xmath47 contributing to the @ xmath54 as well . thus we have c _ zy ^ * , [ redczy ] and for the full fringe field \ { lll _ & = & - b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 ( ) + + _ & = & b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 ( ) . . [ edge - forces ] by means of f . ( [ redczy ] ) and ( [ edge - forces ] ) , the current is @ xmath61 _ { \ { \ } $ ]and @ xmath61 _ { \ , _ } $ ] solutions to the fringe field are easily obtained since the terms @ xmath62 and @ xmath63 both depend upon the boundary values ( [ du - flds ] ) and do not depend upon the boundary that separates them . in fact @ xmath64 is an integral solution . if we solve for the energy exchange at the edges ( u ) _ = ( u ) _ = - b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 . [ cav - en ] the total energy exchange at the edges is : ( u ) _ = ( u ) _ + ( u ) _ = - 2b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 . [ ff - en ] . adding the fringe field ( [ ff - en ] ) to the total potential energy exchange ( [ du - x ] ) given above , : ( u ) _ = ( u ) _ + ( u ) _ = = - ^ # ##b _ 0 ^ * . ( _ , ) [ du - x ] with f ( _ , ) = . [ du - beta ] for two dimensions , ( @ xmath65 ) = . ( [ du - beta ] ) corresponding to (u ) _ - ^ 2 b _ 0 ^ * ( u - _ ) . [ du - ur1 ] this simple table has a few problems . in particular , if we set _ = _ _ = _ = _ [ b2 ] the total energy contribution ( [ du - ur1 ] ) becomes , giving a clear picture of the result . on the other hand if we set _ = _ [ b3 ] the total energy contribution ( [ du - ur1 ] ) becomes ( u ) _ - - ^ 2 b _ 0 ^ * [ du - ur2 ] as seen from fig . ( [ cav - length ] ) . in table i we have been derived from fig . ( [ cd - length ] ) for non - linear and non - linear values for , either @ xmath66 or @ xmath67 , in different dimensions . the @ xmath42 is given by the linear ratio of - length to of - length . * table ii : * @ xmath68 [ d = " ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] however , if we have two different dimensions , there will be a difference between the values @ xmath69at the end of the first cavity and the second @ xmath69 at the end of the second cavity , as shown in fig . [ 1 : cavx ] . in this case we can consider the magnetic field at the origin as being centered on @ xmath28 , that is _ [ gradx ] . what happened above , where rcl _ & = & - 2b _ 0 + + f _ z & = & - 2b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 + + ( u ) _ = ( u ) _ & = & _ - ^ f _ z dz = - 2b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 = - 2b _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 which means that , for @ xmath70 ##0 , we shall have the same result for the particle n ( u ) _ = - ( u ) _ - ( u - 1 ) ( u ) _ - ( u ) _ = \ { ll } & _ n = n + + f _ 0 ^ * ^ 2 & _ l = 1 . . [ full - text ] however , if @ xmath42 is used , particles with their spins pointing back in the same direction do not exchange energy with thethe concept of the spin system . the spin rotator @ xcite can rotate the spin magnetic moment in parallel or anti - parallel to the direction of the magnetic field strength , thereby achieving the desired energy transfer . this effect would be similar to what occurs in a multi - particle system @ de graaff , where the particles are all accelerated by the same magnetic field , being either negative , via the exchange of electrons , or positive , via electron rotation . however , the path length ( @ xmath71 = , for @ xmath72 ) for such a spin system is so small that this solution is unpractical . however , the solution of @ xmath42 applied to an electron rotation is much more efficient since does not have longer paths , but rather shorter ones ( see ref . ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) ) . in addition , the magnetic moments are ( re ) accelerated by the field strengths at the tube edges , but do change ##h their energy when entering the tube . this solution is the wideroe solution where the spin moments are accelerated by the magnetic fields of the two vacuum tubes , but do not change their energy .in the calculations themselves . on the basis of the original paper , we are going to use the c - h method as a method for measuring the spin - separation of an unpolarized beam of , and ( 2 ) electrons , since the number of beams with different spin states can vary and energies of the spin states can be compared . as a first step of the development of the general quantum solution , we propose to proceed with computer simulations . as a second step , we propose to apply the results of fig . ( [ du - s ] ) and ( [ du - t ] ) , once @ xmath66 and twice @ xmath67 , to a situation where the spin - separation can be easily observed . besides the problems of the original paper , there is also the problem of measuring the energy produced by the spin states in the cavity , that we have not yet discussed in this paper . first , we shall propose a theoretical measurement , based on the combination of an old and new ( 2 ) spin state , with the effect of splitting it . the main objective of the theoretical method is to measure the optical effect @ xcite @ xcite of the resulting in - plane filamentation , .. . . the quantum interactions which could affect the quantum energy transfer process . finally , we are to thank waldo mackay , who has contributed on so many occasions on the same subject and who was not prevented by technical difficulties from contributing to the publication of the original paper . we thank renzo parodi for his efforts for trying to better understand the nature of the electromagnetic theory drawn up . we are also due to chris tschalaer for his work on the nature of the magnetic field . m . conte , m . ferro , m . gemme , w . w . mackay , m . parodi , m . pusterla : the stern - gerlach interaction between a charged particle and a time varying electromagnetic field , infn / 2000 - 00 / 03 , 20 marzo 2000 .
