the use of lasers for atomic spectroscopy usually requires long term stabilization of the emission frequency of the laser source . for these applications the stabilization technique @ xcite should be very carefully designed and used , carefully preserving the laser linewidth and not to create an artificial drift in the laser emission frequency . moreover , modulation to the center of an atomic or molecular transition mode requires stabilization techniques and built - in amplifiers . on the other hand , for many scientific and industrial applications one also needs to use such modulation and , therefore , the resulting optical signal does not occur at the center of the optical lineshape , but rather at a different center , as for example , when heating an air sample @ xcite . for these applications a few simple and effective techniques were developed @ xcite and later @ e to deal with problems in the long term phase . the basic idea behind all of these techniques is to create a stable lineshape that can produce an optical signal . in particular , for the dichroic atomic transition mode laser ( davll ) @ xcite and its derivative @ xcite , the stabilization technique can only be used at the center of the phase - shift line . however , a very strong applied electric field is required to produce thezeeman detection of the probed phase transition and the phase transition with well known photodetectors is not possible . + in this article we work on a new method to generate a laser beam in a very simple manner , and capable of practical applications . our work describes the optical effect produced when a nonlinear - profile light beam is passed through an atomic vapor , and is characterized by the size of the aperture ( ex . [ 2 ] ) . we call this method angells , an acronym for optical non - randomly selected phase transition system . + the second order optical property of the nonlinear atomic vapor phase of a light beam results in a non - linear refractive index gradient , proportional to the light intensity . the nonlinear nonlinear index of the medium will then be written as @ xmath1 and the radial index gradient of the nonlinear - profile beam will produce a nonlinear radial index gradient of the medium . this nonlinear gradient will in turn act as a focus for the light beam , which will either be ( self ) - focusing or ( self ) - defocusing , depending on the value of the nonlinear radial index @ xcite . the radial index changes only when a cross section of thenonlinear medium . if on one side of the resonance frequency the index change is positive ( maximum on the z axis ) , the medium acts as a contracting lens and the power of the laser focused on transmission through an aperture will increase ( valley of the nonlinear lineshape ) . on the other side of the resonance frequency the aperture - index change is negative ( maximum on the axis ) , the medium acts as a contracting lens and the transmission through an aperture has a greatly reduced power ( valley of the nonlinear lineshape ) . in other words , the nonlinear medium acts as a lens which focal length depends on the laser wavelength . for a single atomic mass , for example , the non - zero index change can be written as @ xcite : @ xmath2 where @ xmath3 is the vapor pressure , @ xmath4 is the vapor wavelength , @ xmath5 is the gas constant , @ xmath6 is the vapor wavenumber , @ xmath7 is the atomic mass and @ xmath8 is the vapor wavelength detuning proportional to the atomic mass . for low detuning , ( @ xmath##9 ) , @ xmath10 is negative . for the detuning ( @ xmath11 ) , @ xmath10 is positive . the light emitted by the laser is also positive when the laser is centered on _ the atomic vapor _ , resulting in a wave - like lineshape with _ frequency shift _ . + in our setup , the target medium is a thin atomic vapor , embedded in the laser beam , by a sharp ridge to cancel the light with the frequency . + ##ly . our original setup is shown in figure . [ 1 ] . an 852 nm cw tunable nonlinear laser beam is splitted by a 90 / 90 beam axis . the low - energy beam ( @ xmath12 ) , of approximately high spatial resolution ( no temporal resolution required ) and of approximately zero energy , is captured by a 1 mm - focal - length lens . a small ( corresponding to @ xmath13 - @ xmath14c , corresponding to regions of @ xmath15 - @ xmath16 ) atomic vapor crystal @ xcite is in a 1 - mm - diameter optical cavity @ xcite . a large ( @ x##math13 ( mm ) to the diameter of the laser beam . we consider the transmission of the laser frequency through an aperture , so as to increase @ xmath17 of the beam diameter ( or 20 - fold more for a diameter of about 20 mm ) . when the frequency is transmitted through the aperture @ xmath18 phase ##r , the laser beam changes from self - focusing to self - defocusing . this gives rise to a noise - like lineshape due to a non - linear distortion due to the out - of - focus beam angle ( or noise - like distortion ) . the small differences in these lines are due to non - linear ##ity due to the light reflection from the cell windows . the small size of the beam angle and the cell windows makes the detection of this low - frequency effect difficult . however , this does not cause any significant problems to keep the laser in a position within the spectral band of the spectral line . + the error signal is the deviation of the reference voltage ( corresponding to the position inside the spectral line ) from the photodetector reference voltage . + the error signal is calculated and sent to the rest of the laser system to correct for the errors .. for dfb lasers , the energy is changed mostly by the injection temperature , the cavity configuration and , in the case of extended cavity lasers , the bragg - width ##s . we start with a dfb laser system , with the cs d @ xmath19 line and a fabry - prot ##ka , with extended cavity , based on the cs d @ xmath19 line . the resulting locking signal is proportional either to the injection temperature in the dfb or to the laser energy in the extended - cavity d @ xcite . for the sake of simplicity , we have replaced these systems with a custom - made integrated circuit with significant proportional and frequency corrections . + the design of the new system is shown in figure [ 1 ] . the quantum mechanical approach allows us to move the laser beam ( the extended - cavity pzt ##n ) around the atomic nucleus . we measure the locking signal with the help of a standard atomic weight ( sa ) measurement carried out in the atomic unit cell and measure the pulse - width ##s ( see fig . [ locked ] b ) . we use the energy spectrum obtained in this first step as a reference ( fig . [ locked ] c ) as well as to measure the locking signal( fig . [ locked ] a ) . the locking process involves three simple steps : the laser is turned on and the gap is adjusted until the laser output is at the desired reference frequency * ( @ xmath20 ) * , marked by dots in fig . [ locked ] a and [ locked ] b . the error signal is then set to zero by adjusting the reference voltage ( fig . [ locked ] b ) and the reset of the gap , thus locking the laser at the reference frequency ( fig . [ locked ] c ) . setting the reference voltage allows one to lock the laser at a frequency within the desired range and thus to distinguish the different frequency structures shown in the laser diagram . note that the reference frequency keeps the error signal at zero and turns on for the non - zero error signal . + ) , ( b ) the constant for the error signal as a function of the detuning voltage to the reference frequency , and ( c ) the angells - type - constant as well as the independent error signal . the reference frequency of * ( @ xmath20 ) is marked by a red dot in fig ( a ) and ( b ) , [ = 302 ] . [ locked ] c . the error signalwith the laser operating at the same frequency , for a period of a few minutes , as long as the sa signal for the unlocked laser . the laser remains locked for hours , and we have repeatedly and independently checked our home - grown periodic ##ity . the short - term rms pulse width is the same for the locked and the unlocked laser , i . e . of the order of 1 mhz or less , as determined by the laser frequency spectrum used as the standard reference . the long - term rms width of the locked laser is close to less than 1 mhz rms , and the frequency of the laser operating for a few minutes is in excess of . ( . + , liquid line ) and when ( @ xmath21 , liquid line ) the frequency reaches [ . , x = 302 ] we see the error due to the temperature and the shape of the line . although the gas pressure has always been between 55 and 60 @ xmath14c , the lineshape of the sa signal is stable against temperature changes as shown in ref . [ . ] below . the z - axis axis position changes very little ( @ xmath22mhz / @ xmath14c ) during this period @ xmath14##c . stability . the lineshape in fig . [ stability ] a has been locked at a different temperature ( as shown in the reference figure ) , but lower than over @ xmath14c from the rms temperature . therefore , the actual temperature change , except at the frequency center , is not affected by the temperature changes of the cell which lead to temperature changes of the order of 1 or greater than the rms cell temperature , as shown in fig . [ stability ] a . so to operate the laser at temperatures higher than at the frequency center , we have carefully monitored the laser temperatur chamber , without any holes . no other holes exist in the cell wings , that do not play any role in the operating mechanism of the laser system . therefore , the error signal remains approximately constant over @ xmath13 20 - mm , in the plane , around the rms temperature of the vapor ( @ xmath13 20 mm on the plane from this point ) . a benefit of using the angells method is the possibility of changing the slope of the error signal , by purely mechanical means , as shown in fig [ stability ] b . the error signal becomes smaller when the plane is fixed _ at the# ##ization _ ( # ref . [ 1 ] ) . we will mention also the fact that these lasers are already known to have very high stability @ xcite , allowing us to measure the differences in the laser signal . for lasers with high stability , a special photodetector can be used to reduce the measurement error rate . in addition , we have developed an opto - optical locking method based on the spontaneous emission of an optical pulse - like signal . the angells method has proven to be an effective and reliable locking method against large laser frequency changes . for these reasons , the set - up is simpler than other locking methods , without changing electric field or phase changes . the set - up is simple : various combinations of laser frequency , beam intensity , temperature , beam shape and beam pressure have been used , the combinations shown in the table correspond to those used for the measurement data . source : this work was jointly conducted by conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq , no 472353 / 2009 - 09 ) and coordenao de aperfeioamento instituto pessoal , nvel ##a ( cap ) ., m . a . and m . m . , published in cnpq . # ##0 , for instance , y . y . wang , z . - t . chen , m . taubman , m . tiemann , y . - hong , m . pfister , y . ye , ieee trans . , instr . and meas . * 2 * , 583 ( 1999 ) m . schmidt , j . hils , m . schmidt , j . opt . b * 6 * , 1576 ( 1988 ) the surface potential of pure organic molecules is zero at laser frequency . ##ucible at a linewidth from the laser at laser frequency . 0 , for instance , j . j . lett , j . d . phillips , j . d . rolston , j . d . phillips , r . j . smith , j . d . westbrook , j . opt . b * 4 * , 2084 ( 1989 ) m . chron , m . gilles , j . martin , m . moreau , m . sorel , j . phys . b * 5 * , 401 ( 1994 ) m . j . corwin , z . - t . chen , j . k. smith , j . j . wieman , appl . opt . * 35 * , 3295 ( 1998 ) j . a . pearman , c . p . smith , r . a . smith , d . a . smith , m . a . smith , m . j . smith , eng . phys . j : eng . opt . . phys . * 35 * , 5141 ( 2002 ) m . a . smith , c . p . smith , r . smith , j . j . kruger , j . j . close , appl . opt . * 35 * , 5163 ( 2008 ) a . j . smith , m . j . a . slagmolen , m . j . kruger , j . d . smith , r . a . smith , eng . lett . * 4 * , 1905 ( 2002 ) a . a . gazazyan , a . a . papoyan , a . sarkisyan , a . smith , , phys . lett . * 4 * , 801 ( 2007 ) r . a . smith , m . grilo , m . brasileiro , m . di lorenzo , m . ori , m . chevroll##ier , appl * 58 * , 871 ( 2010 ) others , e . g . , m . ackemann , m . scholz , ch . vorgerd , m . nalik , j . j . hoffer , m . g . smith , j . commun . * 147 * , 411 ( 1998 ) r . j . smith , m . g . solli , y . c . chiao , j . j . hickmann , phys . b * 58 * , 023804 ( 2004 ) we have performed several experiments of laser stabilization of an isolated hydrogen atom to bring a 780 mm thick cell to the junction of the two hydrogen atoms . the cell length was found to have a slight reduction compared to the actual cell length . this is not possible with thick cells ( 10 mm and 20 mm ) , but shorter cells can achieve stabilization even in thick cells . our man - made laser system is hooked up to a high - voltage dc supply ( current of + 1 @ xmath23m / s ) . j . peterman , _ laser - stabilization and stabilization _ ( kluwer pub . , dordrecht , 1991 )
