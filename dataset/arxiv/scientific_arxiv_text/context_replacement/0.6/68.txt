the open connectome project ( located at http : / / openconnecto . org ) aims to capture all the features of a large amount of human brain tissue , map these features , and create a high resolution 3d model of the data , known as the connectome . it is hoped that this data will help understand the structure and function of the human brain . the goal of this project is to accurately represent axoplasmic neurons , since it is very time consuming to 3d - print them . however , the goal is to create an accurate model with high resolution , to enable accurate data analysis . there has been very little published work towards this goal @ xcite . axoplasmic neurons are seen only as slices , determining the structure of the brain tissue and facilitating our inference . the 3d image we are working with is then coded using time - consuming cross - cutting techniques @ xcite to create connections between the neurons . we use this data as the testbed for both our algorithm and the axoplasmic neurons . the neural filter @ xcite is a non - linear structure consisting of a single neural filter @ xmath0 , which iswith equal size , and a 1d - filter @ xmath1 , which grows with increasing size : @ xmath2 _ 1 = \ frac { 1 } { i _ p } \ sum _ { q \ in s } g _ { \ sigma _ { r } } ( | | p - q | | ) g _ { \ sigma _ { r } } ( i _ p - i _ q ) i _ p , \ \ & \ hspace { 4mm } \ textrm { where } i _ p = \ sum _ { q \ in s } g _ { \ sigma _ { r } } ( | | p - q | | ) g _ { \ sigma _ { r } } ( i _ p - i _ q ) \ hat { s } \ ] ] is the extinction coefficient . this filter preserves the image by averaging over all pixels and preserving noise , and thus the image , but not averaging over pixels with different intensity differences . thus this filter produces something like axoplasmic noise in our image . even with the normal ##ization of the intensity difference , the resulting noise causes some unwanted interference between pixels . we try to solve this problem using lapla##cian ##2 . the laplacian filter measures the difference between the intensity of a pixel and the average intensity of its neighbors . thus , comparing the laplacian filter image to the original image results in an increase in intensity where the average intensity of the dark pixels is less than that of the original image , an intensity decrease where the intensity is greater , and a decrease in pixels of equal intensity . next , we use the 3x3 laplacian filter to find pixels with dark pixels such as axoplasmic pixels . we use the pixel intensity comparison algorithm for our filtered image to find and compare axoplasmic 26 . 5 mm @ xmath3 26 . 5 mm @ xmath3 26 . 5 mm @ xmath3 26 . 5 mm @ xmath3 26 . 5 - 26 . 5 mm @ x . we do this by going through the original image and looking for dark pixels , where a dark pixel is defined as a pixel with intensity less than a certain threshold value . when a dark pixel is found , we check for near - neighbors to see if the dark pixels are all below the threshold . next , we search the pixels for these , and we do this until we find afor further growth , wait until we are larger than the size of the axoplasmic cell . the algorithms we use for our algorithm are theoretically efficient and chosen accordingly . first , we use our projections on the data to check their accuracy and identify axoplasmic objects that were identified previously . for each slice , we scan the volume and see if an axoplasmic object is found in the corresponding slice - or ( with no modifications ) in one of the adjacent slices . if a previously identified axoplasmic cell object is found , we remove the new object . next , the adjacent slice locations are searched for axoplasmic objects with a more efficient search algorithm , and new objects are added to the corresponding slices . if an axoplasmic cell object is found in either of the adjacent slices , then we find the object in the corresponding slice to be removed , and remove it . we then tested our results on two samples from the kasthuri11 dataset , and then compared our results against the data from a sample . our results for axoplasmicreticulum , with 95 % confidence , and 95 % accuracy . these results are low since there is a bias common among family members . our current algorithm is designed to detect transverally distributed axoplasmic regions . in future research , we hope to extend our morphological region growing algorithm to also detect dilated axoplasmic regions , and to use a more sophisticated filtering technique such as kalman - marko ##v . finally , our algorithm can be used to detect unique regions in different em ##ts , such as neurons , by extending the morphological region growing algorithm .
