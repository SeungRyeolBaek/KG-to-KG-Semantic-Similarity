hydrogen stars ( cv ) are short - period stars with a white dwarf ( wd ) primary ( with mass @ xmath2 ) and a low mass main sequence secondary ( with mass @ xmath3 ) . the primary loses its roche lobe and transfers mass to the wd at the secondary lagrangian ( @ xmath4 ) point . the main features of the orbital period distribution of cv with the hydrogen star are the presence of variations in the 2 - 4 hr time range ( the so - called time variation ) and the observed cut ##off of the cv at around 4 hr , which can be seen in figure [ combined ] ( middle frame ; e . g . ritter & kolb 1998 ) . so far theoretical models have been unable to explain the exact details of the observed short - period cut - off and the variation of the cv orbital period distribution at this cut - off . this is shown in figure [ combined ] . stars that are under the influence of gravitational forces ( gr ; ritter et al . 1962 ) are the slow fluctuations of orbital angular momentum ( e ) with a short period of @ xmath5 . ( figure [ combined ] , middle frame ; paczyski 1971 ; kolb& baraffe 1999 ) . the probability of finding a system within a given time range is equal to the time required to search in this region . we can write , ( k ) , for the number @ xmath6 of systems found within a given orbital time range , @ xmath7 , and @ xmath8 for the orbital period evolution of this region . we can find an increase of mass ( or spike ) around @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 ( figure [ combined ] , lower frame ) , but no such increase is found in the mass distribution ( figure [ combined ] , upper frame ) . the orbital period evolution is the mass distribution of the mass distribution , which in turn is determined by two different processes . mass transfer breaks thermal equilibrium and expands the star . the expansion breaks thermal equilibrium and brings the star back to the equilibrium state . the orbital relaxation occurs where the two different time steps , the mass transfer time @ xmath11 and the relaxation ( sub - kelvin ) time @ xmath12 are approximately equal ( e . g . paczyski 1971 ; smith 1988 ) . if @ xmath13 occurs the star is forced to expand in response to mass transfer ,but if @ xmath14 the star will not expand far enough and will be small for its mass . the size of the orbital center is then determined by the observed mass transfer rate , and in turn by the expected rate of orbital angular momentum ( cv ) loss . in this section we discuss how to reduce the theoretical uncertainty by increasing the mass transfer rate , and propose ways to ` ` reverse ' ' the process by introducing a spike of @ xmath9 % of the stellar mass . in particular , we discuss the effect of a spike of orbital energy loss ( caml ) where the primary is lost as a result of the mass loss from the secondary , i . e . @ xmath15 ( see e . g . webbink 1985 ) . in section [ 2 ] we present our theoretical model , and give the solutions for caml . in section [ sec22 ] we present the calculations of the long - term distribution of cv , and in section [ comptest ] we compare the observed long term orbital energy distributions with the other equivalent model assumptions based on the results in section 2 . in this section we present the solutions to the relationship between the predicted and observed long orbital periods of cv . the maximum am loss of @xmath16 of the system can be expressed as the sum of two functions , = _ sys + _ caml , where @ xmath17 denotes the ` ` ` ' ' mass loss rate , interpreted as gravitational mass loss , that is , of mass loss , and @ xmath18 denotes the inverse square of the mass loss rate . we assume = 0 and _ caml0 _ . we consider the special case in which the caml mechanism , along with # ##e mechanism , causes a fraction of the transferred mass to leave the secondary . this fraction may be greater than , and the secondary will lose more mass during the second outburst than has accumulated since the first outburst . we give a simple description of the nature of the caml mechanism , thus avoiding the need to describe its exact nature . other caml mechanisms include a magnetic field , i . e . a field with a freely rotating secondary wd where most of the transferred mass derives its momentum from the wd axis in conjunction with the wd z - axis ( see e . g . wynn , smith & smith 1997 ) , and an optical disk , ( see e . g . livio & pringle 1994 ) . our caml mechanism generally follows the camof king & kolb ( 1995 ) . the secondary is assumed to be lost via mass loss that is non - linear with respect to the constant e , at the wd , and perpendicular to the z axis . we define @ xmath19 as the total amount of mass lost from the secondary that leaves the system . we assume then that some fraction @ xmath20 ( @ xmath21 ) of the secondary mass leaves the system with some fraction @ xmath22 of the angular momentum it lost , leaving the @ xmath4 system . we then consider mass that is lost from the secondary via # ##e loss , which in the long run can be interpreted as an energy loss from the secondary ( see e . g . kolb et al . this ) will cancel out the total orbital angular momentum of the secondary and will account for the fraction ( @ xmath23 ) of the mass lost . we then define _ caml = a ^ 2 _ e + , where we define @ xmath24 as the caml constant . for comparison with king & kolb ( 1995 ) we extend this to [ e : jdotcaml ] _ caml = 0 , > 0 , and to [ e##q : nufinal ] = ( 1 + - ) ( ) ^ 2 + . for our calculations shown above we use the expression , - + - , ^ 2 = . this is an approximation of the formula given by kopal ( 1959 ) and is accurate to within 1 % of the range @ xmath25 . in this section we make note of the long - term evolution of systems as they grow and evolve towards the theoretical limit . for the calculations we use the original formula of mazzitelli ( 1989 ) , adapted to us by kolb & ritter ( 1992 ) . all of these data points form the basis for the actual cv ##s that we see in figure [ comptest ] below . we calculated the range of the systems that were adapted to caml according to figures [ 1 : jdotcaml ] and [ 2 : nufinal ] . we calculated @ xmath26 and # ##ized systems @ xmath27 , with the range of caml systems @ xmath28 as shown in figure [ 2 : fullcaml ] . the systems then evolve from these points towards the next period ( right to left ) with a constant energy transfer rate . the cv period decreases with thecaml increases to a maximum of about 1 , for @ xmath29 . mass transfer stability puts an upper limit on the caml efficiency . an equivalent upper limit is 1 , where only the angular momentum of the transferred material is extracted from the system . although the transferred material may have more angular momentum than is transferred ( as in the case of a spin system where the angular momentum is extracted from the rest of the wd ) this does not include the total loss of the angular momentum . the maximum caml efficiency , associated with mass transfer , could be greater than 1 . the prediction of @ xmath30 which is the equation for steady - state mass transfer , in [ fig : 3 ] ( e . g . smith & kolb 1995 ) cannot be greater than 1 ; this puts an upper limit on @ xmath31 . [ fig : stab ] - _ 1 = - _ 1 ( ) the prediction of @ xmath30 against @ xmath32 for an energy - stable system ( @ xmath33 , @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 ) is given in equation [ fig : dq ] . the system also exhibits behaviour of fast mass transfer . @ xmath36 ( @ xmath##30 ( to equilibrium ) and a higher mass transfer rate @ xmath37 . the two stars are short lived , on the order of @ xmath38 . ( see also [ see : highmdot ] ) . the secondary then collapses with @ xmath39 . then , @ xmath40 @ xmath30 begins to collapse , but still stays stable , peaking at a point called @ xmath41 . the gravitational activity of the secondary may have an effect on the mass transfer . simulations by renvoiz , baraffe , kolb & ritter ( 2002 ) , [ see also kolb 2002 ] using 3dimensional sph , show that the secondary is enclosed in the non - rotating roche lobe and that its mass ##tric , is about 0 . 06 times that of the primary star in equilibrium . we model this process in our 3 - d stellar dynamics model by increasing the roche potential by the order of @ xmath42 . the mass transfer rate is calculated from the difference between the secondary and the roche potential , via - _ 1 = _ 2 ( - ) . where @ xmath43 is the mass transfer rate of the star in which the secondary fully reaches the roche potential and @ x##math44 indicates the photospheric - point mass of the star ( see e . g . ritter 1988 ) . figure [ source : barraffe ] shows the distribution of the orbital period and mass transfer rate for stars with different deformation factors @ xmath42 , ranging from 0 ( no mass ) to 1 . 06 . the mass transfer rate is expected to increase with increasing mass . this can be seen from the strong dependence on orbital period and point mass of the classical quadrupole formula for the mass transfer rate due to gravitational effects ( see e . g . rosen & lifschitz 1958 ) . although the quadrupole formula is generally valid only if the components are point masses , rezzolla , ury & yoshida ( 2001 ) found that the gr ##c calculated from the standard 3 - d model of the neutron star differs from the donor mass rate by more than a few percent . it can be seen from the figure that with the deformation factor 1 . 06 the orbital period varies from around 50 min to around 100 min , compared with renvoiz et al ( 2002 ) for gravitational effects only . a deformation factor of around 1 . 06 is expected to bring the minimum period to the maximum period of @ xmath45 ##0 . this ismuch larger than the theoretical value ( ) ^ = ( ) ^ = 0 . 06 from the gr ##n and roche 2001 . in our view we have the simplest case in which all the physical deformation factors are taken into account . the combination of the optical mechanisms suggested by renvoiz et al ( 2002 ) has the net effect of increasing @ xmath9 , n by about 50 % compared to the case with the mechanical . another possible physical mechanism that could produce a deformation factor to the order of 0 . 06 is the gravity of the donor , as suggested by dantona ( 2000 ) . we note that patterson ( 2000 ) claims to have no evidence for ` ` ` ' ' s at the period minimum . on the basis of the mass estimates from the kepler superhump of 2002 patterson claims that the donors give @ xmath46 more masses than those from two sources . , in most other cases if gravitational attraction is the same gr ##f . even if correct , this theory does not distinguish between the spontaneous equilibrium of the donor mass and the non - equilibrium caused by gravitational energy levels in excess of the gr ##b . to determine the statistical significance of the theoretically predicted distribution of mass at the period minimum ( ` `then ( ' ' ) we used the probability distribution of the parameters for making predictions about transfer rates . for each track a number of random fluctuations are observed , starting around 0 . as tracks evolve beyond the minimum period a point is reached ( as when @ xmath47 is behind @ xmath48 ) where the fluctuations of @ xmath47 become so large that the henyey method no longer works . the linear model uses algorithms to calculate / estimate the parameters and equations of motion for each track , and in this case the values are highly accurate . to apply the algorithm we use the semi - empirical method as well . the tracks were measured at the point of @ xmath49 , where @ xmath50 is the energy transfer rate at the minimum period for the track . the slope of the curve for the first segment of the track is given by r _ 0 = r _ 0m _ 2 ^ , where @ xmath51 and @ xmath52 are assumed to be equal . the values of @ xmath51 and @ xmath52 were calculated from the first two data points for each track . ( @ xmath52 has a mean value of about 0 . 5for values in the maximum range . ) to obtain the parameters to the model we first calculate @ xmath7 from the roche stability index , and @ xmath53 from the stationarity index in figure [ minpnumeric ] ( see figure [ above ] , see below for an example of an experimental model ) . we extended the range of values to the maximum range , see , fig . 5 . for the maximum range . we compare the calculated model parameter distribution for different values of the observed system @ xmath54 against the calculated model parameter distribution . the k - s ( kolmogorov - smirnov ) test is applied to the differences between the parent distributions . the only difference between the cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) of the observed and predicted systems is at the center of the cdfs , i . e . at the most likely regions for the k - s test ( ritter et al 1992 ) . we then decided to use the method : @ xmath55 test . for each parent distribution of systems , each year 134 systems are generated . ; ritter & kolb 1998 , an update in 2001 , as of january 2002 the number of systems in this test range is only 152 . this would include the data generated .the @ xmath55 test , the sample and all the results . . ] the sample was tested against the model parent distribution using the @ xmath55 test , with 1 , 2 and 3 sample bin . this method fills the gap for the reliability and validity of the @ xmath55 test which requires a large number of samples per bin . the observed child distribution was tested against the model parent distribution again , using the tests @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 . the result @ xmath22 of the sample with a single @ xmath55 value less than @ xmath56 was used as a measure of the confidence level of testing the hypothesis that the child distribution was different from the parent distribution . in the figure we see the sample bin n = @ xmath22 . kolb & baraffe ( 1999 ) found that the observed distribution of non - magnetic ones ( figure [ fig : mnmcvs ] , left frame ) , and the observed distribution of magnetic ones ( figure [ fig : mnmcvs ] , right frame ) showed no significant differences in the confidence level . to calculate and do this we calculate these values for @ xmath57 values , giving the result @xmath55 consists of 0 . 1213 . thus we can not rule out that the distributions are derived from the same underlying normal distribution . this is ruled out by the process of comparing these distributions with the normal distribution that is given by @ xmath7 ( see the table [ tab : tabcomb ] , for f and g ) which have different conditional moments ( p = 0 . 709 and p = 0 . 781 , respectively ) . we can see no significant differences between the two distributions . in the following we will compare this against the relative magnetic and non - magnetic moments of the particles . the absence of two flat periods in the original flat period distribution ( see [ tab : mnmcvs ] , at right ) does not imply an underlying normal distribution for the underlying parent distribution . the flat period is pr = 0 . 552 ( for the null - null model , see table [ tab : tabcomb ] ) . we use this distribution as a basis for the models described above . [ p = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] smith , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) found a ( modified ) flat period distribution by comparing two sample pdfswith different maximum values @ xmath58 leads to a carefully controlled problem . for the two wedge - shaped model pdfs based on the pdf ##s in our image [ 1 ] ( reference image ) the optimal range is @ xmath59 $ ] ( @ xmath60 is the second maximum period ) . this distribution function exactly matches the values of the two corresponding model pdfs . king et al . ( 2002 ) found that the range @ xmath61 is sufficient to rule out the initial distribution . it is clear that this result requires a certain amount of fine - tuning for @ xmath62 if the range of the model pdf is known . such a fine - tuning cannot occur because the two distributions combined will have only slightly different maximum values . we applied the range @ xmath62 found by king et al . ( 2002 ) to our non - spherical model pdfs that used the caml function and the distribution function as a basis to estimate @ xmath58 . the results gave a much better result ( @ xmath63 versus @ xmath64 ; 95 % difference ) for the caml pdfs compared to the original results based on the modified camlthe value we have is . in part this is due to the fact that the upper limit of @ xmath31 does not have the full dynamic range of @ xmath58 . in the case of the deformation factor pdfs the fit is poor ( @ xmath65 versus @ xmath66 ; re - estimated , @ xmath67 ) . it is possible to improve the fit by using systems with deformation factors up to 0 . 5 , and by adding the [ @ xmath68 $ ] , but this only gives the same good for @ xmath69 ( see the figure [ fig : 1 ] ) . however , even a small value is inconsistent with the normal distribution for long periods . this can be seen from figure [ fig : barraffe ] systems that are close to the deformation factors would fit into the larger population , and the gap would be filled by this population . for this we present in figure [ fig : grsum1 ] the version of the model proposed by miller , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) if exact rather than approximate pdfs are used . this version has the following parameters ##s ( @ xmath70 ; @ caml ,slightly longer ( , @ xmath71 ) than the uncertainty parameter for the @ xmath58 , and the same as in king et al . the only observed system with an extended bounce period is the result of the complete cooling of the parent system without follow - up of energy loss ( see e . g . ritter & kolb 1992 ) . such a mechanism is absent from the experimental data . if these effects were taken into account the total energy loss required to wash out the @ xmath9 effect would cover a wider area but at a lower rate . the bounce period spike would be similar to the one shown in the [ ref : grsum1 ] we have proposed mechanisms that could increase the bounce period for systems from the theoretical minimum value @ xmath0 min to the maximum value @ xmath72 min , and try to rule out the other possible effects of jumping above the maximum value ( the bounce spike ) . in king , schenker & hameury 2002 we focus on effects other than the orbital angular momentum ( am ) effect , i . e . we find that orbital collapse is the only possible consequence of the effect . we find that for a highly nonlinear maximum value effect ( see##l ) this would also imply the bounce period minimum . since the entire stellar population is expected to be stars with a range of caml , we would in this case expect to find a minimum of mass corresponding to @ xmath0 ##9 , rather than the very high cut - off . we find many stars that are ` ` unstable ' ' due to tidal effects , such as the tidal effects observed in 3 - d . sph spectra of roche - type donor stars . an extremely high scale factor of about 1 . 5 is expected to produce a bounce period of @ xmath45 min . a possible alternative interpretation of @ xmath9 as an upper limit rather than a period minimum ( patterson & schenker 2002 ) would increase the total mass of the population in a stellar population dominated by metal rich , unevolved stars to @ xmath73 . a system with a mass much greater than this would either have a bounce period greater than 10 min or would have already evolved beyond the period minimum . there are several stars with suspected @ xmath74 ; notable examples include wz sge ( @ xmath75 ; patterson et al 1998 ) and oy g ( @ xmath76 ;pratt et al . 1999 ) . it is also possible that systems fade / disappear before reaching the initial population , and thus are lost as such . the fact that the two model populations of sub - stellar and planetary systems have nearly identical values of @ xmath9 ( see figure [ 1 : mnmcvs ] ) , suggests that the main reasons for the observed decline would have to be found in the fixed stars and the planets rather than the underlying chemical or physical properties of the system . even if the fade / bounce is true we see in all our model populations ( except for the upper model population ) a general population decline due to the disappearance of systems before the bounce . we use a modified @ xmath55 model to determine the ` ` strength ' ' of populations against the original distribution . the r - model ( pratt et al 1992 ) is not applicable to the values of @ xmath77 ##9 and the more recent populations above . none of our upper model populations applies as well to the population which is not stationary in the plane ( selection probability @ xmath78 ) . for populations where the systems have a much greater fitness than expected from a small , stationary distribution ( selection probability @ xmath79 with@ xmath80 rather than @ xmath81 ) gives similar results for @ xmath82 . however , none of our models with @ xmath83 canot are based solely on the basis of this fact . models attempting to ` ` smooth out ' ' the period gap by using a large portion of the caml model are generally better than model models based on young stars that are subject to a small number of orbital d ##s . for these models the error rate increases if the overall wd ##v efficiency is taken into account , but this introduces an additional delay in the error rate . model populations where all stars form at long time periods ( just outside the period gap ) are a generally better model than populations that include all stars with low core temperatures . adding these parameters to the model causes a downward trend of the core energy spike towards short periods , thus making the period spike more predictable . this implies that all stars must have formed at long periods and passed through the period gap to form long - period populations . this is consistent with the fact that most young stars are highly evolved ( baraffe & kolb 2000 ; schenker et al . 2002 ; thorstensen et al 2002 ) . however , the, schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) obtained a realistic bounce period model , using two pdfs that represented pairs of systems with a fixed w ##d mass and fixed wd mass , but varying bounce periods . this model had a significantly larger number of systems with different bounce periods . we repeated this experiment with a different pdf , but failed to find a much better one . in general , we agree that the period correlation problem and the bounce period problem are an open problem . it is possible to construct statistical model systems where the period correlation is ruled out so well that it can also be ruled out , on the basis of an empirical statisticial test against the observed bounce period distribution . we thank david wynn , david norton and isabelle baraffe for helpful comments . john conway and chris jones also contributed comments to the pdf ##s . we also thank david norton for a good review of the paper and the late jean - marie hameury for useful comments .
