active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are the most massive , known sources of radiation in the universe . it is believed that the inner disk of agn consists of two massive black holes ( smbh ) surrounded by an outer disk . in some cases , gravitational waves are observed in agn , perpendicular to the axis of the disk . the causes of these are still unknown . agns whose surfaces are oriented at a right angle to the axis are called blazars . the observed ( according to @ xmath4 - 1 ) surface energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars shows two distinct non - thermal emission patterns . the low - temperature emission is thought to result from the greenhouse effect . the leptonic effect suggests that the high temperature is due to the compton scattering . this can be attributed to upscattering , by the large non - thermal number of particles responsible for the compton emission , and by the ( non self luminous : ssc ) @ xcite . blazars also show strong temperature variations , that may or may not be associated with the surface energy distributions . this information is therefore important to understanding the nature of them . in thishere we have the formula that we have used to make an estimate of the characteristic parameters of the ssc model . the ssc model has a constant for the magnetic energy , @ xmath5 , which is a simple power law with parameters @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 . the minimum , maximum and minimum correction functions for the parameters are now called @ xmath8 , @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 respectively . the core region is assumed to be a circle of radius @ xmath11 , with phase shift @ xmath3 with respect to the surface of the magnetic field of radius @ xmath1 . the region is then characterized by the characteristic parameters . ' ' ' ' ' @ xmath12 ' ' ' ' ' in the first case we have a @ xmath8 constant and equal to 1 , which is a good approximation as stated in the formula . the estimation of the four characteristic parameters has been done by taking their exact values and derived from the @ xmath13 model in which multi - dimensional data points have been added to the ssc model obtained by an @ xcite . this has been performed by thelevenberg - marquardt introduced @ xcite , which is an approximation algorithm for non - linear least - squares methods that simultaneously choose between two different numerical methods , namely the fast descent method and the gradient descent method . for example , we will describe the sub - model for the algorithm in table i . the sticking point of our argument is that from @ xcite we can only obtain a simple approximation to the ssc spectrum , in the form of a simple sed . on the other hand , from table ii , we see that at each step the calculation of the @ xmath14 requires the calculation of the sed for all the sampled points . although the sample point will usually not be one of the sampled points , from @ xcite , it will be between the sampled points , so that it can be used to calculate the variance of the sed . at the same time , the levenberg - marquardt algorithm allows the calculation of the time derivatives of @ xmath14 with respect to the ssc spectrum . these derivatives have already been calculated , by computing the likelihood function of the @ xmath14 with respect to a very small , carefully chosen .of the data . this problem could have caused a slight delay in the computation , due to the constant need to compute the sed at many , many different points in the data , this being the most difficult problem in terms of computation time . for this reason we speed up the computation to reduce the number of changes to @ xcite during the computation . the @ xmath0 tests during both phases are shown in fig . 1 . . data is used in this experiment . the corresponding table of the parameters can be seen in fig . 2 . [ parameters = " < , ^ , ^ , ^ " , parameters = " < " , ] [ l2ea4 - t1 ] in order to compare the behavior of parameters with different options , we use mrk421 ( phase 2 ) , given the limited number of mwl data sets and the low resolution , and most likely for ebl , of vhe ##f . the @ xmath0 test seds are shown in fig . 2 . in addition to the @ xmath0 tests , we also compare the behavior of the parameters using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) method . comparing the behavior of different coordinate systems ( synchr##otron and ( again , at the higher energies ) , and the two types of low - and high - energy data , we applied the _ piecewise _ test _ , _ i . e . _ we applied the ks test result to low - and high - energy data . _ the ks test result indicates that the compton residual are constant at 100 % energy level . our results show that for mkn421 , @ xmath1 decreases with source activity whereas @ xmath15 and @ xmath3 increase ( fig . 3 top ) . this can be seen as the situation where the peak energy and peak frequency remain constant with increasing source activity , decreasing the moment and increasing the number of high energy states . this correlation results from an increased electron - hole interaction , and thus , an increased peak frequency . the correlation ##s are normal with source activity . in fig . 3 ( top ) , the @ xmath1 - @ xmath15 z - correlation results from a relatively high energy peak frequency . the @ xmath1 - @ xmath3 correlation indicates that the compton residual of mkn421 is constant in the normal range . the @ xmath3 - @ xmat##h15 correlation is the combination of the electron synchrotron and the scattering of the photon emitted by a particle with momentum in zero towards the electron .
