information stored in qubits can be used for both quantum computation and for classical computation @ xcite . this information is stored in a quantum state @ xmath4 which in the case of a qubit can be parameterized by | ( , ) = | x + 1 ^ 2 | , ; [ , ] where @ xmath5 and @ xmath6 are the states of the two - dimensional representation of the qubit and @ xmath7 ; @ xmath8 . qubits are very stable , that means the state of a qubit can easily be changed by the effects of the quantum or a classical event . a ( very simple ) way to determine the quantum information stored in a qubit is to study it . with the help of an experimental model we can determine the state of a qubit , with an approximate accuracy up to 1 / 3 ( see below ) . in this way the quantum information is transformed into a classical information which can be stored , processed , and processed by the rules of quantum computation with very high fidelity . however , in order to reach the final state of quantum information , we have to store the information in states of classical information , and then we are able to change thetheory of decoherence . here it has been shown that classical computation and quantum information theory can be combined via symmetrization @ xcite . in particular , the qubit in the reference state is associated with the set of @ xmath1 ( ancilla ) qubits in the given reference state ( let us write @ xmath5 ) . the reference state @ xmath9 of @ xmath10 qubits , | ( | , , , 0 + | , , , , 0 + + | , , , , ) , [ 2 ] is defined . if we write the equation for the symmetric states @ xmath11 of @ xmath10 qubits with @ xmath12 of them being in the state @ xmath6 and @ xmath13 of them in the state @ xmath5 , then the equation ( [ 2 ] ) can be written in the following form | ( , | ) = | 0 ; 1 + i ^ 2 | | 0 ; | [ 2 ] where the states @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 are represented by the symbols = ; [ 2 ] and @ xmath16 , and @ xmath17 . wenote that the @ xmath10 qubit state @ xmath18 is equivalent to a single qubit state . so in this case the correlation is distributed among @ xmath10 - qubits - the resulting state space is ` ` ' ' ' . correlation of the qubits of the @ xmath10 - qubit state ( [ 5 ] ) is in the case @ xmath19 . we define the total correlation between the single state @ xmath20 and the original qubit @ xmath21 as = | ( ; ) | _ | ( , | ) | ( ; ) [ 5 ] where @ xmath22 is the density operator of the state space of the original qubit ( i . e . we have no _ prior _ information about the single state @ xmath21 ) . for this case we use the correlation _ fidelity = . [ 5a ] we see that for @ xmath23 the correlation @ xmath24 is equal to 1 ( as it should , because in this case @ xmath25 ) . for the case @ xmath26 we get @ xmath27 . in general in this case the correlation of the qubits areis equal to @ xmath28 . in other words , all the qubits of the quantum state @ xmath18 within the maximum @ xmath10 state do not contain any information about the corresponding one - qubit state @ xmath29 . so how do we extract the information from the @ xmath10 - qubit quantum state ( [ 3 ] ) ? the simplest solution would be to simply have a non _ universal _ machine which would perform the perfect transformation instead of a machine @ xcite . since the perfect transformation is impossible , there are a number of things we can do to convert the information from the @ xmath10 - qubit state @ xmath18 back into a single qubit . in particular , we have the following possibilities : * i ) * we can then simply extract the @ xmath10 qubit from and based on the information obtained from a single - qubit machine . * ii ) * we can have a universal machine which would perform a transformation as close as possible to the perfect transformation ( [ 3 ] ) . in this hypothetical case we have two possibilities - the type of transformation would be single - qu -. this means that log ( [ 1 ] ) for all values of the parameters @ xmath14 and @ xmath30 will be much larger than for all values of these parameters . thus , we can construct a quantum system which measures all the parameters with the same probability . * Â¤ ) * similarly , we construct a quantum system , such that when a single projective measurement of the ancilla is performed at the origin , the corresponding n - qubit state is obtained . the probability of the success of the measurement in this state is time - dependent . in what follows we shall consider all these possibilities . before , we mentioned that a new type of algorithm has been developed by terno and mor @ xcite - @ xcite . they used two different algorithms . the first would take the state of a classical quantum system and transform it into a state that is exactly the product of the reduced density matrices of the two states . the second , which is a modification of the first , would then start with the state of a bipartate quantum system , and transform it into a new state which has the same reduced density matrix as the original state . they found that .because of these properties are , in general , they can be used for different types of input states . an optimal simulation of the first kind has been proposed by bandyopadhyay , et . al . @ xcite . the operators we are using distinguish , to some degree of accuracy , an input state from an output state formed from that state and a known state . so we first perform the simulation by using a set of standard measurement operators . then we take the standard measurement - based approach to quantum mechanics and we obtain an upper bound on the efficiency of the measurement - based approach . we consider the fact that the @ xmath10 qubit state formed from the state @ xmath18 is equivalent to a single qubit . so we can perform a simulation based on using a projective model with two states @ xcite @ xmath31 ( @ xmath32 ) with | _ _ ( , ) & = & @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 , where the states @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 are equivalent only if | _ _ _ information about the corresponding @ xmath10 - qubit state is known . we then .the result of the measurement to obtain is a single - qubit state . however , if the result of the measurement is measured for @ xmath37 , the single qubit is prepared in the state @ xmath38 and the single qubit is prepared in the corresponding state @ xmath39 . for a given orientation of the measurement apparatus ( i . e . the state @ xmath40 ) this measurement - based process is : a single qubit prepared in the state described by the measurement apparatus ^ ( meas ) ( , | ; , ) = _ j = d ^ 2 | | _ j | ^ 2 | _ | _ j | [ 9 ] if we averaged over all possible orientation of the measurement apparatus we have on top a single qubit prepared in the state ^ ( , ) ( , | ) = | ( , | ) ( , | ) | + . [ 10 ] to determine the mean fidelity of this measurement - based measurement , we need to find the mean fidelity @ xmath41 , that is the difference between the state ( [ 9 ] ) and the corresponding orthogonal state @ xmath42 averaged over all possible orientation of the single qubit : _ j = | ( , ) |^ ( | ) ( , | ) | ( , ) . [ 11 ] taking into account the error ( [ 4 ] ) we perform the calculation in fig . ( [ 5 ] ) and we get _ n = ( 1 + f _ n ) [ 12 ] where the error @ xmath43 + f _ n = . [ 12 ] for @ xmath23 : @ xmath44 which is the standard method of estimation of the accuracy of a quantum qubit . from fig . [ fig1 ] we see that the error ( [ 4 ] ) is a linear function of @ xmath10 and in the limit @ xmath45 we get @ xmath46 , which is equal to the accuracy of the _ _ _ _ state with a quantum system such as the two systems under consideration . in other words , when the original qubit is transformed into an additional qubit state of the system ( [ 10 ] ) , additional accuracy can be obtained from the result . the quantum state of ( [ 10 ] ) in this limit is also equal to @ xmath47 , which is correct , because as we have seen , in this limit the @ xmath10 - qubit state is not in the= @ xmath48 , the information about the state is ` ` ' ' ' - accurate . we also need to find an upper bound @ xmath49 for the state , which can be obtained using a wide range of vector - based measurement techniques . we assume that it is _ a priori _ true that our @ xmath10 - qubit is derived from the input state ( [ 0 ] ) with the parameters @ xmath50 and @ xmath51 , with a single - qubit state ( [ 1 ] ) . the correlation function on the state space of the single qubit is @ xmath52 and the corresponding output probability density matrix on this state space is 1 . our goal is to compute the output state @ xmath9 with the parameter @ xmath53 [ see fig . ( [ 1 ] ) ] , where the parameters @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 are distributed according to the distribution @ xmath56 , which can be left unchanged for the measurement . if the distribution is positive , we produce the probability density matrix @ xmath57 , and if it is negative we produce @ xmath58 , where @ xmath59 with @ x##math32 and @ xmath60 appear in fig . ( [ 8a ] ) . we shall first consider the conditional distribution , @ xmath61 , , and this allows us to consider a wider range of ensembles . for the ensemble @ xmath53 , the probability of the output being @ xmath57 is @ xmath62 and the probability of output being @ xmath58 is @ xmath63 . averaging over all ensembles , @ xmath64 = d ^ ( , ) ( , | ) & = & | ^ [ | _ 1 | & + & | _ | | | ^ | _ | ( ^ , ^ ) ] + ( ^ , ^ ) . in order to determine the statistical significance of the results produced by this method , we estimate the output for a given input ensemble and integrate over the input ensemble @ xmath65 where @ xmath14 is a subset of @ xmath50 [ see fig . ( [ 2 ] ) ] . this can be written as @ xmath66 where @ xmath67 is the generalized conditional probability distribution , and @ xmath68 where @ xmath69 and the su##premum is taken over the value @ xmath70 . we then find that @ xmath71 , \ ] ] where the supremum is also taken over @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 . in order to reach this upper bound we must compute the values for @ xmath74 and @ xmath75 . after performing the above calculations we have for @ xmath49 the fidelity ^ 2 = . this fidelity for @ xmath23 is equal to 1 / 3 and in the example @ xmath26 is equal to 1 / 3 . for example , @ xmath10 is greater than the fidelity @ xmath41 of the method given by a . ( [ 7 ] ) as shown in our previous example . however , as we now see , it is alway greater than the fidelity of the standard quantum method . in what follows we see that a quantum machine which stores the information can send the information back to a single qubit more efficiently than with the memory - based method . as we have already shown in the example , computing does not allow us to build a quantum machine which would require using ( [ 7 ] )for an optimal ( quantum ) system @ xmath42 results in the @ xmath10 qubit quantum system ( [ 3 ] ) . therefore , we can expect to find quantum systems which work well under certain conditions . now let us say our quantum system , @ xmath76 , is a quantum system with the @ xmath77 - bit state space represented by the vector @ xmath78 ( @ xmath79 ) . the system is therefore first placed in the state @ xmath80 , and then it starts with the @ xmath10 - qubit ##s in the state ( [ 3 ] ) . at the start we want to separate the @ xmath1 ancilla qubits from the - qubit , so we want to use | ( , | ) | k _ j | | - 1 ; k _ j = 1 ^ k _ j = 1 ^ | k _ j ( , | ) | | | k _ 0 . [ 13 ] as seen from above . ( [ 13 ] ) during the design , the difference between the @ xmath1 ancilla qubit##s and the reference qubit are combined ( transformed ) into the correlation between the reference qubit and the state itself . by integrating over the correlation we would expect to find the best possible reference qubit , the state @ xmath81 . thus we have three constraints which would explain what we mean by the optimal _ ( universal ) transformation : the correlation between the output of the transformation and the reference state @ xmath42 has to be constant with respect to that of the reference qubit , and the transformation has to be input - output only . this nature of the transformation would also ensure that the information from the correlation matrix ( [ s ] ) is valid for the states most likely . we are looking for the _ universal _ transformation which would extract the state with the highest fidelity . using these three constraints we have found the _ transformation which is the _ optimal ##ized _ transformation , i . e . which separates the qubit - state @ xmath29 from the @ xmath10 - qubit . @ xmath9 is the state and the @ xmath##29 - state independent . ( see figure ) . this state is given by the equation : | d ; + | d _ | & & | d - d ; + ; + the sum of the states . the states @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 differ by the equation _ d = ( ) ^ 2 / 2 ; _ m = . [ 15 ] we can also show , that the state @ xmath84 is 29 - state independent and equal to @ xmath85 . similarly , it can be shown that the transformation ( [ 15 ] ) is unitary , i . e . among all the transformations satisfying the above conditions the transformation ( [ 15 ] ) has the highest probability . we see that for @ xmath23 the state @ xmath86 , which is impossible , because the original qubit has already been replaced with ancilla qubits . we find @ xmath87 in space . we see , that it is _ _ _ larger than the probability of the transformation via , . in the state @ xmath26 , the same algorithm gives us a perfectly stable state . even in this limit , the correct stateentangler , which we call the equality operator , is only able to extract information from the state ( [ 3 ] ) . this is one of the main points of our paper - the classical - universal relation works better than if the information is extracted ( namely , information ) from the known state ( [ 3 ] ) with the same the of the relation . this is due to the fact that @ xmath88 . we can also ask the same question , how can we generate states of a qubit in the unknown state @ xmath29 the optimal state of the state ( [ 3 ] ) . it can be shown that in quantum mechanics , universal entanglers , which would obey the conditions of the relation ( [ 3 ] ) do not work . if one wants to generate a state ( [ 3 ] ) from a qubit in the unknown state and @ xmath1 ancilla qubits in the known state @ xmath5 , two scenarios are possible , the classical - classical and quantum - . it is not surprising that the classical scenario works better . we have found the most efficient ( only with respect to states of the unknown qubit) the entangler given by the function : | + | = - 1 ; + | + _ = & & ; + for example of the universal entangler , @ xmath89 ##1 the ideal state and the parameters @ xmath90 and @ xmath83 are described by fig . ( [ 14 ] ) . one can see that the difference between the state of this entangler given by the transfer function @ xmath91 and the corresponding ideal state ( [ 15 ] ) is input - output symmetric ( i . e . does not depend on the parameters @ xmath92 ) and is equivalent to @ xmath93 . this is the best known quantum ( universal ) entangler . the clone procedure has a higher fidelity than even the best state - dependent methods , but it is not obvious that this is the best that it can do . in the field of quantum electronics , the best cloners are the ones which give the highest fidelity @ xcite . as we shall see , however , in the field of computers this is no longer the case ; there are state - dependent methods which are available . see the article below .@ xmath94 , is independent of the device itself and need not be known . they do , however , satisfy the conditions imposed by the unitarity of the above transformation . the input state for the device is assumed to be @ xmath95 , and the ideal output state , to which the ideal output should be mapped , is @ xmath96 . the output state is obtained by starting with the input state , using the above transformation , and then integrating over the state to obtain the output state of , @ xmath97 . one then derives the average fidelity for this device , which we shall call @ xmath98 , from @ xmath99 note that we are considering a linear ensemble of input states ; the fidelity of the n - qubit device @ xmath100 is assumed to be dependent on the unit state . our value for the average fidelity for a state - dependent device depends on our choice of input state , but for a state - independent device the average fidelity is independent of this choice . the calculation of the average fidelity is described by the following , and should not be discussed in detail . we assume that @ xmath101 and @ xmath##102 . this means that the initial state is actually a mixture of the states of the @ xmath10 ##4 and the entangler states , which means that the entangler states can be removed from the system . thus , the transformation which gives the average fidelity is called a kind of state space transformation . the average fidelity itself is given by @ xmath103 , where the probability @ xmath43 is given by ref . ( [ 1 ] ) . this average fidelity is less than the probability of the quantum _ spin _ transformation ( see ref . [ fig1 ] ) . in this case , the fact that the initial state allows us to choose an additional intermediate state , the spin , with which the qubit at the origin is fully aligned , results in a significant loss of information . as a result the information of the original ( original ) entangler is lost . however , we see that the state - space transformation can also be represented by a kind of state swap ##ping , i . e . | ( , ) | 0 ; 0 | = @ xmath104 . thus , when averaging over the states of @ xmath105we estimate the output fidelity of this state - dependent entangler to be equal to @ xmath43 which on average is less than the output of the state - dependent entangler . let us consider a linear neural network which has as its input the @ xmath10 - qubit vector ( [ 21 ] ) . the network is composed of a sequence of @ xmath1 c - not gates @ xmath106 where @ xmath107 is the input - bit with @ xmath108 being the source bit and @ xmath12 being the destination bit . this sequence of the c - not gates depends on the input vectors @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 . [ 21 ] p _ n | n ; 0 & & | n - 1 ; & | & + p _ n | n ; & & & ( | n - 1 ; & + | n - 1 ; 0 ) | 1from which it follows that the input vector ( [ 21 ] ) is represented by | ( , | ) & & ( | v _ + | ( , ) + & & + | v _ - | ( ) [ 21 ] where @ xmath111 is the source. . in fact . ( [ 21 ] ) we have constructed two state machines of @ xmath1 qubits @ xmath112 . evaluation of the two @ xmath1 qubits is done in order to determine whether they are in the state @ xmath113 or @ xmath114 . if the probability @ xmath115 is positive , then the @ xmath10th qubit is in the corresponding state @ xmath42 . the probability of this outcome is given by p _ | p _ + = . [ 22 ] this process is non - state - preserving , and probability associated with @ xmath10 . there is a difference between this particular process and those considered previously , such as the method @ xcite . those methods work for set of input states which is finite . the process discussed previously , however , works for a finite , and hence infinite , set of input states . it , in fact , works for all input states of the type we are considering . however , we can see that the degree of success of these methods depends on the type being considered . we have constructed a number of different methods of .an unknown state from an unknown state or from that state and a known state . finding the difference is , as always , the most invasive procedure . in the context of quantum electronics , the above transformation is very well implemented , at least if the accuracy is met by the standard . universal quantum devices are found to work very well for this purpose in that they can be used for the entire range of possible applications . this work was done by the national science foundation under contract phy - 9970507 , by the ist - ieee under the contract ist - 1999 - 11053 and by the ieee , international center for universal quantum devices . let us consider the universal quantum device which is as close as possible to the above example ( [ 1 ] ) . the transformation transforms the space spanned by the states @ xmath116 and @ xmath117 , into the space spanned by @ xmath118 and @ xmath119 . this means that we have a device of the following type @ xmath120 where @ xmath80 is the initial state of the device which is assumed to be the same for all states and @ xmath121 ( @ .##math122 ) for the unnormalized random pseudo - vectors . our task is to compute these vectors . unitarity it follows that @ xmath123 we shall then use our own transformation ( a . 1 ) to compare the output of the corresponding transformation to the input . ( [ 2 ] ) the output of the transformation is given by e . ( [ 3 ] ) . if we use the transformations @ xmath124 and @ xmath125 we can calculate the output of the transformation ( a . 2 ) @ xmath126 we can use this expression to calculate the output density matrix and find out the transformation itself . we define the @ xmath10 - qubit output density matrix to be @ xmath127 the output density is given by @ xmath128 where @ xmath129 is given by e . ( [ 4 ] ) . if we introduce @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 we can write this expression as @ xmath132 \ nonumber \ \ & + & \ \ ^ { \ ast } \ , \ langle \ _ { 0 }| d _ { 2 } \ rangle ) \ nonumber \ \ & + & ( \ alpha ^ { \ ast } ) ^ { 2 } \ beta ^ { 2 } \ sqrt { n } \ langle d _ { 2 } | d _ { 4 } \ rangle + \ alpha ^ { 2 } ( \ beta ^ { \ ast } ) ^ { 2 } \ sqrt { n } \ langle d _ { 2 } | d _ { 2 } \ rangle \ } . \ end { a . 4 } \ eqnum { a . 7 } \ end { 1 } \ ] ] requiring that the sequence is independent of values of @ xmath133 and @ xmath134 we find that @ xmath135 for these conditions to be satisfied the sequence is @ xmath136 \ } . \ nonumber \ end { 1 } \ ] ] in order for this to be independent of @ xmath133 and @ xmath134 , the value in question must be equal to @ xmath137 equal to . ( a . 7 ) and ( a . 8 ) we find that @ xmath138 satisfying these twowith those separated by unitarity we find that @ xmath139 and @ xmath140 . this implies that in order to maximize @ xmath141 , we must maximize @ xmath142 . our first step in doing this is to show that by combining the results of e . ( a . 9 ) and ( a . 10 ) we find that @ xmath143 where @ xmath144 and @ xmath145 . solving for @ xmath142 we find that @ xmath146 which , like @ xmath147 , is defined when @ xmath148 . this implies that @ xmath149 and that @ xmath150 . on the condition of the product we find that @ xmath151 we can express our result in the following way . let @ xmath152 be the set of all orthonormal vectors and with the elements @ xmath82 and @ xmath83 . from e . ( [ 1 ] ) we will find that @ xmath153 and the vector _ vector _ transformation operator is defined as by .##q . ( [ 5 ] ) . in order to find the optimal input - output transfer function we use the following form of the equation ( a . 5 ) such that the _ 0 _ of @ xmath154 ( with @ xmath141 given by q . ( a . 5 ) ) is zero . then , as before , the integral over is @ xmath155 . so when the integration over the parameter @ xmath51 is zero we can write the expression as [ @ xmath156 \ } \ nonumber \ { { 0 } \ ] ] with [ a . 19 ] _ 1 & = & _ 0 ^ ^ 3 + _ 2 & = & _ 0 ^ ^ 4 + _ 3 & = & _ 0 ^ ^ 4 ^ 3 for the integration over the parameter @ xmath50 we get [ a . 19 ] _ 1 & = & + _ 2 & = & + _ 3 & = & from the unitarity of the coefficients , it follows that @ xmath157 and @ xmath158 . when we find the parameter @ xmath159 where @ xmath160 , and @ xmath16##1 ; @ xmath162 we can write the mean fidelity ( a . 17 ) as & = & [ _ 1 ] ( _ 1 - _ 2 ) + _ 2 ( _ 2 - _ 3 ) + & + & [ _ 1 n + _ 4 ( n + 1 ) ] . [ a . 21 ] taking into account that @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 we can find that the value of the mean fidelity ( a . 17 ) was equal for @ xmath165 and @ xmath166 . in this case we write ( a . 21 ) = = [ _ 1 u + _ 1 + 2 _ 3 ] . [ a . 22 ] when we put into a . ( a . 22 ) the corresponding expression for the parameters @ xmath167 given by a . ( a . 22 ) we find that the mean fidelity is equal to the parameters @ xmath43 given by a . ( [ 18 ] ) . this value is equal to the mean fidelity of the two - dimensional model obtained via the state space analysis described in a . ( [ 18a ] ) . in fact , from our definition @ xmath16##6 it also follows that @ xmath168 = @ xmath169 . in particular , from @ xmath165 it follows that @ xmath102 , and that the resulting time - dependent rounding error is exactly equal to 1 . ( [ 18a ] ) , which we have to correct .
