natural hamiltonian systems are the simplest models of those physical systems for which the energy is conserved , for example harmonic ##s for the quantum system . however , as in the first two equations , other variables become part of the system ( see _ _ _ _ ) : angular momentum , maxwell - runge - lentz constant , etc . finally , these variables are given by the terms in the equation and , for linear systems , by first - order differential equations . hamiltonian systems with equations of the motion of mass greater than 5 are rarely studied , however , some of them are of great interest , as for example the three - dimensional taylor - calogero and taylor system . these equations describe the motion of the point - masses in a system under conditions given by the equations and @ xmath4 . ( we do not have all the harmonic # equations ) and they have also the general form @ xcite . thus the two natural hamiltonians and @ xmath5 are one linear and one linear in the energy distribution of the system , making the system liouville - integrable and invariant by separation of variables ( see @ xcite and see below ) . theorem .independent coefficients of the motion also exist , one linear , equal to the multiseparability of the hamiltonian , and one quantum . the systems are called maximal superintegrable ( ms ) , with the number of such independent coefficients of the motion equal to all the degrees of freedom , plus one ( for classical systems , the maximum number of such partial differential equations ) . ms systems are of the greatest importance in theoretical physics , where ##s and generators are used and this allows them to prove bertrand russell theorem . moreover , maximal superintegrability shows itself , for classical systems , in the fact that the spin states of classical systems are closed and , for quantum systems , in the fact that the spin levels are also closed @ xcite . in recent years , new discoveries made possible the unification of classical and quantum hamiltonian systems , ms and quantum , with physical laws of sufficiently large scale @ xcite whose development , now under way , yielded important results in general relativity , quantum mechanics , and computational techniques @ xcite . in this article , is also described the research on the ms system by claudia chanu , luca degiovanni and the others ( in the cdr )see also other papers . in these cases , the following theorem ( in [ teo0 ] ) assigns a degree of extension to a natural hamiltonian @ xmath6 in such a case an absolutely non - zero element , also of extension @ xmath7 , of the natural hamiltonian will exist . the following theorem , also in @ xcite , describes and demonstrates what we use for ` ` induction ' ' in the special case of natural hamiltonians on vector bundles of smooth varieties ; for a more detailed discussion , see @ xcite . for an @ xmath8 - dimensional natural hamiltonian @ xmath6 on the vector bundle of a ( pseudo ) - dimensional manifold @ xmath9 , let be @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 where @ xmath12 is the hamiltonian vector bundle of @ xmath6 , and [ teo0 ] let @ xmath9 be an @ xmath8 - dimensional ( pseudo - ) - manifold with metric tensor @ xmath13 . the natural hamiltonian @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 with metric tensor @ xmath16 is the extension @ xmath##17 has the form ( [ hamext ] ) with the first integral @ xmath18 with @ xmath19 replaced by ( [ x ] ) and @ xmath20 , if and only if the following conditions hold : 1 . the equations @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 are @ xmath23 @ xmath24 where @ xmath25 is the metric space of @ xmath21 . 2 . for @ xmath26 the extended hamiltonian @ xmath17 and the first integral @ xmath27 is @ xmath28 for @ xmath29 the extended hamiltonian @ xmath17 and the first integral @ xmath27 is @ xmath30 with @ xmath31 , @ xmath32 , @ xmath33 and @ xmath34 in @ xcite it is proved that @ xmath35 is completely different from @ xmath17 , @ xmath6 and the corresponding first integral of @ xmath6 is @ xmath36 . the integrability properties of ( [ hessteo ] ) are proved in @ xcite and it is proved that their relative integra##bility of @ xmath37 , where @ xmath31 is the constant curvature of @ xmath9 . however , the solution @ xmath20 will exist only with respect to @ xmath38 , and the total number of solutions is found on constant curvature manifold only . however , non - solutions can be found on non - constant curvature manifold ( cdr to ##r ) . from # ( [ vteo ] ) , the values of the corresponding parameters @ xmath22 can be obtained . these examples are given by @ xcite . the special case of @ xmath19 is easy to obtain from @ xmath35 by taking the @ xmath39 - th term of the matrix , using @ xcite @ xmath40 with @ xmath41 } { \ left ( \ begin { matrix } m \ cr 2k \ begin { matrix } \ right ) \ left ^ { 2k } p _ 0 ^ { { - 2k } \ left ( - 2m ( m + p _ 0 ) \ right ) ^ { } , \ ] ] @ xmath42 } { \ left ( \ begin { matrix } m \ cr 2k + p \( { 1 } \ left ) \ quad ^ { 2k + 1 } [ _ 1 ^ { { - 2k - 1 } \ quad ( - 2m ( 1 + p _ 1 ) \ right ) ^ 2 } , \ { n > 1 , \ ] ] where @ xmath43 $ ] is the matrix , and @ xmath44 . we note that the solutions of higher order obtained in other ways than by the extension procedure @ xcite can be easily obtained , due to the fact that the state variables are in these cases orthogonal to the coordinate system . as a simple example of the extension procedure we consider the two - dimensional hamiltonian @ xcite @ xmath45 the exact solution of the extended hamiltonian @ xmath17 and @ xmath46 where @ xmath31 is called the real part of the corresponding complex manifold . the solutions of the ( [ hessteo ] ) and ( [ vteo ] ) are @ xmath47 where @ xmath48 . when @ xmath49 and @ xmath50 , the configuration space of @ xmath17 is the vector space , the sphere @ xmath51 and the pseudosphere @ xmath##52 ##4 , and for @ xmath53 and @ xmath50 , the dual space , the desitter and non - desitter space , respectively . by the change of the coordinates @ xmath54 , the term @ xmath39 and @ xmath17 transforms into @ xmath6 and @ xmath55 this makes clear that the original formulation introduces an additional symmetry into @ xmath17 , in this case a dihedral symmetry of [UNK] @ xmath56 , and continues with the same first derivative @ xmath35 . in the dual coordinates ( i . e . @ xmath57 ) with @ xmath58 and @ xmath59 , @ xmath22 is connected with the newton - calogero potential or , equivalently , with the gravitational potential @ xcite . similarly , in the coordinates of @ xmath5 , @ xmath60 , with coordinates @ xmath61 , to @ xmath62 e . g . to the coordinates @ xmath63 , we have @ xmath64 the method of integration adds two distinct and independent first derivatives to the original hamiltonian @xmath17 : @ xmath17 itself and @ xmath27 . this property is especially useful when the hamiltonian @ xmath6 is ms . in this case , @ xmath17 is ms systems , and @ xmath65 - polynomial first integral . in @ xcite this property of the hamiltonians is known in many ways . for example , let us show @ xmath66 that is a special case of the generalized tremblay - turbiner - winternitz system ( ttw ) @ xcite for @ xmath67 and @ xmath68 , a positive - dimensional manifold of dimension @ xmath69 . this property is known for the ms system @ xmath70 and admits polynomial first integral of dimension equal to @ xmath70 @ xcite . in @ xcite it is known that @ xmath6 ##8 are systems of the form @ xmath71 with @ xmath72 , and in this case extended ms systems . similarly , harmonic ##s in @ xmath73 , rational or not , can be transformed into harmonic ##s in @ xmath74 @ xcite. the extension @ xmath20 can be extended to @ xmath75 . this leads to further extensions , denoted by @ xcite , that can be described in a paper in 2007 ( cdr ) . the same extension can be considered this way , with @ xmath39 , for any rational rational @ xmath76 . a simple extension of @ xmath77 , is that the extended ttw extension of , , with @ xmath78 , can be considered as an extension for any rational @ xmath70 . to date , hamiltonians and their quantum derivatives can be extended to hamiltonians and lie groups by a method of integration , usually in terms of einstein - beltrami operators . when the curvature of @ xmath9 is a constant , the extension requires more operators ( quantum derivatives ) in order to obtain integrability and superintegrability . the quantum curvature is then given by the classical curvature and by the weyl curvature @ xcite . at least in the case @ xmath79 , the quantum curvature of @ xmath17 and @ xmath80 is obtained , with the assumption of the superintegra##bility of the state moves it to the next state . this can be seen in the table from 2011 ( cdr ) .
