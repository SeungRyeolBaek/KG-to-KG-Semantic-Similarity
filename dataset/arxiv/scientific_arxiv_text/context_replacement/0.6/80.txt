one of the most important results of quantum mechanics of present day is the study of the behavior of bosonic many - body systems in the unitary regime @ xcite . by solving the feshbach equation the three - body scattering length @ xmath1 is known to very high values . the unitary regime is characterized by excited states ##ity . for non - interacting noble gases , the system ##eous ##h is unstable : @ xmath1 â†’ @ xcite . studying the efimov effect in quantum many - body systems leads to the concept of entropy . efimov effect occurs in the three - body system ( @ xmath0 = 0 ) where the quantum three - body interaction is such that the scattering length is much larger than the energy of the system . under this condition , a number of tightly coupled and highly excited states of efimov effect occur in the system . although the efimov effect and ultracold nature of the ##ons are well understood , the exact study of bosonic systems with large scattering length is difficult . however , @ xmath2 is a well understood quantum many - body system in this case @ xcite , the highly excited state is also claimed as of efimov effect, but no such data is currently available . whereas the recent experimental results of efimov physics for ultracold gases have raised interest in the possibility of study of many - body quantum gases @ xcite , the study of efimov physics for this system ( @ xmath3 ) is not possible . there are several studies in this area which study the properties of the gases @ xcite . although ideas and results reached in these studies are very similar , differences exist . this requires the study of the ##ity of bosonic transition states of efimov physics . + in this section we consider non - bosonic states of @ xmath4rb ##s ##n with van der waals forces . our interest also comes from the study of weakly bound molecules interacting from ultracold quantum gases . by the feshbach effect the weak interatomic interaction can be easily reduced to one energy level . for strongly bound organic molecules , the efimov character is almost zero ( @ xmath5 ) . our goal is to study the delicate threshold behaviour of weakly bound two - body states . to study this threshold behaviour we consider two - body interaction wave functions for the two - body states interacting .mass - independent two - dimensional van der waals model . we hope that our future work will understand the general behaviour of two - dimensional bosonic clusters in the nucleus . the use of cluster models with a short range neutral core and long - range attracting core @ xmath6 to give useful results as well as more generic models are possible . the method is summarized as follows . in fig . ii we show the two - body hamiltonian and the calculation . we show the calculation and show the existence of a quantum theory with efimov equations . it starts with this result . we can solve the many - body schrdinger equation using partial - expansion method ( phem ) . we have also applied phem to the two types of noble gas clusters @ xcite and star clusters @ xcite . the method has been described in detail in our book atoms @ xcite . we will explain the method further for interested parties . we imagine a system of @ xmath7 @ xmath4rb ##s , independent of mass @ xmath8 and interacting via two - body interactions . the hamiltonian of the system is given by @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 is the two - body interaction and @xmath11 is the position vector of the @ xmath12th particle . it is common practice to convert the motion of a many - body particle into the motion of the center of mass where the center of mass vector is @ xmath13 and the relative motion of the atoms ' center of mass is . for elementary particles , the center of mass acts like a free particle in certain conditions and we write the motion as . alternatively , we can compute the center of mass vector by using the polar coordinates , such as @ xcite @ xmath14 and . the hamiltonian for the relative motion of the atoms @ xmath15 and @ xmath16 is the set of the pair - particle interactions described in terms of these coordinates . the hyperspherical model analysis method ( hhem ) is an _ ab - initio _ _ many - body method and includes all the variables . the hyperspherical variables are composed of the hyperradius @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 hyperangular coordinates which are independent of @ xmath19 the polar coordinates @ xmath20 associated with @ xmath21 position vectors and @ xmath22 hyperangles @xmath23 , by their interaction . however the calculation of @ ##s number of possible pairwise interactions is a difficult task and the convergence rate of the hyperspherical field theory is very slow for @ xmath24 , due to the large size of the cluster . the hhem is also suitable for the analysis of large single - clusters . but for a small m or n - cluster , only two - body separation and pairwise interactions are needed . thus we can split the interaction density function @ xmath25 into two - body faddeev components for the global @ xmath26 . for @ xmath27 it is important to note that @ xmath28 is a combination of two - body separation ( @ xmath29 ) and the global @ xmath30 component . since for each of the @ xmath31 interacting components of the @ xmath0 interacting system , the irrelevant degrees of freedom are all reduced to just two , _ viz . _ , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 and the remaining irrelevant degrees of freedom are removed . since @ xmath25 is divided into only the two body faddeev components , _ and .- \ correlation _ is conserved . so the general result for a single faddeev equation is that when two particles interact , the rest of the particles act as in ##ials . thus the concept of two - body correlation follows from the two - body interaction in the above equation . it is to be noted that @ xmath28 is invariant under the differential operator @ xmath32 for bosonic particles and in the faddeev equation @ xmath33 \ phi _ { ij } = - [ ( \ vec { n } _ { ij } ) \ phi _ { kl > 1 } ^ { n } \ phi _ { kl } \ left { q . faddeev - eqn } \ ] ] where @ xmath34 is the total kinetic energy of . applying the operator @ xmath35 to both sides of v . ( [ q . faddeev - eqn ] ) , we get : the modified schrdinger equation . since we know that when ( @ xmath36 ) , and the rest of the particles are in ##ial , the total hyperangular energy and the total angular momentum of the whole system are .for the corresponding pair and . for the @ xmath26th faddeev basis vector corresponding to the set of spherical coordinates ( h ) ( which is a kind of hyperspherical ##s ( hh ) necessary and sufficient for the case of @ xmath37 ) and for the ( @ xmath36 ) basis vector @ xmath38 @ xmath39 . the resulting set of hyperangles in the @ xmath40 - dimensional space corresponding to the @ xmath26 ##th basis and @ xmath41 is called the basis . it has the explicit form : @ xmath42 @ xmath43 is the hh of the basis in the @ xmath44 dimensional space given by @ xmath45 basis vectors ; @ xmath46 is the hyperangle of the @ xmath47 - th basis vector @ xmath48 and the hyperradius @ xmath30 and is given by @ xmath49 = @ xmath50 . for the corresponding @ xmath22 noninteracting vector we have hyperradius vectors @ xmath51 such that @ xmath52 . the set of @ xmath##18 the number of hh is then reduced to _ _ _ @ xmath53 , for the @ xmath22 non - interacting pair @ xmath54 and for the interacting pairs @ xmath55 , @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 . thus the @ xmath40 - schrdinger equation reduces back to a four dimensional equation with the following set of quantum numbers : , @ xmath58 , the corresponding momentum quantum number @ xmath59 , momentum quantum number @ xmath8 and the central quantum number @ xmath60 for and @ xmath0 . using ex . ( [ cf . faddeev - n ] ) and ex . ( [ cf . faddeev - eqn ] ) and acting on the vector space , the system of partial differential equations for the partial derivatives @ xmath61 is : @ xmath62u _ { kl } ( r ) + \ displaystyle { \ sum _ { k ^ { \ prime } } } f _ { kl } f _ { kk ^ { \ prime } } ( r ) f _ { k ^ { \ prime} } } { _ { { ^ { \ } } } } ( 1 ) = [ & \ \ \ { { 1 } \ in { 1 . cde } \ ] ] + where @ xmath63 , @ xmath64 , @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 . + @ xmath67 is a constant and is the product of the ph for the states with the value of ph corresponding to the states @ xcite . the correlation for s @ xmath68 is given by @ xmath69 we do not have the same long - range correlation ##s @ xmath70 as described in above . it is also pointed out that the ground state of ultracold and noble gases in the unitary model is obtained when the two - body interaction with @ xmath1 is reduced to very small energies by solving the feshbach equation . although the unitary gauge model has been successfully solved both theoretically and theoretically @ xcite , the bosonic gauge interaction is a major problem for the two - body model . even though the size of the interaction is small compared with the energy level , interatomic distances are very large and the corresponding mean - value equations are. . + the interaction behaviour of these large molecular clouds is parameterized by a single parameter - the @ xmath71 - the scattering length . . for our current attempt to understand the interaction behaviour of the cloud , we use the van der waals model characterized by two parameters : the effective energy of the central molecular component @ xmath72 and the length of the long - wavelength component @ xmath73 . by keeping @ xmath73 constant , it is possible to calculate the energy of @ xmath72 . using the two - body schrdinger equation it is possible to calculate the scattering length for each component of @ xmath72 . we write the high - dimensional two - body schrdinger equation for the two - body waves , @ xmath70 and @ xmath74 where @ xmath75 for @ xmath76 and @ xmath77 for @ xmath78 . the average value of @ xmath70 , @ xmath79 , @ xmath80 is the interaction length . the solution of two - body waves is that the value of @ xmath1 varies fromnegative to positive , over an infinite interval . in fig . [ 2 . 1 ] , we consider the zero - energy state of @ xmath1 as a solution of @ xmath72 . for each collision , one more molecule in the three - body wave function exists which corresponds to one more two - body collision molecule . + for our next problem we solve @ xmath72 so that this corresponds to the energy in the three - body wave function . we add the energy energy to limit the energy of the molecule , but when @ xmath1 energy increases , the number of two - body collisions will increase which increases the energy of the molecule . + with the same set of equations we obtain the system of coupled differential equations ( cdes ) @ hyperspherical orbit equation ( haa ) @ xcite . using haa , we find the hyperradial motion is small compared to the hyperangular motion . then the solution of the hyperangular motion is obtained by solving the equation , giving the total hypercentrifugal energy for a given solution of @ xmath30 . the cde is then transformed back into a single coupled .for @ xmath81 \ int _ { 0 } ( x ) = { \ hspace * { . 5 . } , \ left { [ . eaa } \ ] ] which is defined as the average energy ( eaa ) and the total energy @ xmath82 is the total energy at which the hyperradial scattering takes place . the above equation is used to relate the energy and wave function with the boundary conditions for @ xmath83 . + in fig . [ 2 . gndstate ] , we show the different bosonic and ground state energies and the average scattering length of the boundary for different cluster sizes with @ xmath0 = 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 as a function of the scattering length @ xmath1 which describes the physical properties of the bosonic cluster located at infinity @ xmath84 . it is to be noted that the total energy of the bosonic cluster is given by @ xmath85 . with increases in cluster size , the number of particle particles @ xmath86 also increases and the energy becomes more negative than positive . for two particles the negative scattering length corresponds to the ground state with zero energy . for three particles theefimov states : if @ xmath87 and @ xmath88 = 1 , infinitely many many - body bound states with a negative energy and positive energy will exist . going in the opposite direction of the energy , these states appear to be evolving one by one . we have studied the properties of bosonic states and in fig . [ fig . left ] we have @ xmath89 ##1 as function of the state number @ xmath90 of the negative energy state . the properties of efimov states @ xmath91 as a function of the energy @ xmath90 are shown in fig . [ fig . rav ] . [ fig . excited ] , we know that for each of the @ xmath0 - like states there is a series of bound states with very high energy . it is clear that these series of states have a dependence upon the state number : @ xmath89 @ xmath92 @ xmath93 . the # ##s gives the values : @ xmath94 = 0 . 448 , @ xmath95 = 0 . 278 , @ xmath96 = 0 . 198 , @ x##math97 = 0 . 149 . whereas in fig . [ 2 . rav ] , we found that the spatial range of efimov states is much larger than the normal range and the c . i . d . properties of efimov states are easily calculated with the formula @ xmath98 @ xmath92 @ xmath99 where the observed values are @ xmath100 = 0 . 06 , @ xmath101 = 0 . 08 , @ xmath73 = 0 . 09 and @ xmath102 = 0 . 068 . the exponential @ xmath103 = 0 . 39 for @ xmath0 = 4 , 0 . 43 for @ xmath0 = 5 , 0 . 46 for @ xmath0 = 6 and 0 . 49 for @ xmath0 = 7 , is equal to the exponential of 0 . 39 as shown in fig . @ xcite for these states . now we determine the statistical properties of the observed states by using the cross - correlation function @ xmath104 which gives the probability of finding the @ xmath26 family of states in a given experiment @ xmath10##5 . [ 2 . 5 ] is the maximum correlation function for @ xmath106 with unitarity . @ xmath104 is seen as a very important parameter in the study of cluster dynamics because the interatomic interaction plays a major role . when we try to model it , due to the strong force of van der waals forces , the long range hard core radius dominates the direction of interaction , so @ xmath104 is defined for @ xmath105 less than the hard core radius @ xmath72 . we have @ xmath104 = @ xmath107 where @ xmath108 is the two - body correlation function and the correlation over the hypervolume is the value of @ xmath105 . the value of the correlation is equal to 1 @ xmath105 with increase of @ xmath0 and with no decrease . but we do not see any change in the correlation function . it appears that the resulting massive cluster is just like the cluster , as mentioned in the paper @ xcite . it is well known that although the physical properties of the cluster are very well known , much more is known about thefor clusters . in this article the existence of correlation ##al energies of three and four - particle systems is also suggested . the early studies in this area were mainly based on the tjon line which refers to the strong linear correlation between the energies of three - particle and four - particle systems @ xcite . it is suggested that the bosonic cluster energies corresponding to the unitarity , for different excited states should follow the generalized tjon line . it follows that the energies are strongly related to each other and the one - way relationship is linear . @ xmath109 . fig . [ g . tjon ] , we consider the energy ratio @ xmath110 as a function of @ xmath111 for different cluster energies @ xmath0 = 4 , 5 , 6 . these models have approximate fits of the ratio @ xmath112 . the fitting parameters are given by the [ g - tjon ] . we consider the best approximate fit of the energy ratio of clusters to the generalized tjon line . we note that the value of the fitting parameter , varies with time @ xmath0 and this is consistent with our model @ xcite . . table of fitting parameters of tjon lines . [ fig##s = " < , ^ , ^ " , t = " ^ " , ] [ [ - tjon ] this result opens the possibilities of further studies of how the product of the two tjon ##s is used in the calculation of the universal properties of such bosonic systems . & + ( a ) @ xmath113 & + & + ( b ) @ xmath114 & + + ( c ) @ xmath115 & + the study of weakly bound few - body systems and their universal properties in the nucleus is a major research area in recent years . the recent experimental study of efimov coupling in ultracold noble gases has increased the interest in such few - body systems . the theoretical study of three - dimensional bosonic clusters with more than two dimensions is very difficult and the theoretical problem is complicated with @ xmath24 . the system is weakly bound and the structure and the energy density differ . it needs to have interatomic interactions . in the latter case we use three - dimensional the wave function for the description of @ xmath0 - body systems . use of the van der waals equation for the universal properties of such cluster systems . we calculate the energy density of @ xmath0 - bodystarting with @ xmath0 upto two atoms . given the atomic wavelength , which is much shorter than the wavelength of light , the ground - state of @ xmath0 - 1 cluster exhibits universal behaviour . therefore , to show the efimov - dependence of the energy correlation we measure the exponential dependence on the state number . we also calculate the e . i . d . of the two separated clusters and it shows their exponential dependence on the state number . that of atom - atom interacting clusters exhibits the same behaviour and does not show any difference . it shows that the single interacting state is more like a single ground state . we also measure the energy correlation between the states contained in one atom and show that they have a non - linear relationship . we consider the tjon effect as the result of universal behaviour of bosonic clusters . we would like to thank the university of south africa ( unisa ) for the financial support of researchers where lot of research was done . we also received the support of dst ( usa ) with the research grant s / s2 / cmp - 0126 / 2012 .
