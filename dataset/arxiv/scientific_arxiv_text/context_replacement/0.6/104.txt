particles created in the gravitational field of the sun that are accelerated by interactions with dark matter may travel in the solar wind . however , their capture would produce particles with a higher energy than normal particles . the result would be an echo of high - energy ( @ xmath1gev ) detector ##s coming back to the no @ xcite . the energy signature at no @ xmath0a would come from @ xmath2 , consisting of upward - going flux that can be detected by the no @ xmath0a detector . the powerful and compact no @ xmath0a particle detector , with its high mass and energy density , and its high - energy energy signature , is an ideal instrument for these large dark matter experiments . at no @ xmath0a , the detector ##s can select events associated with the numi system . for single - particle particle physics experiments , so - called energy - gathering no @ xcite are used to select events of interest . then the upward - going flux can be measured in order to determine the x - ray intensity . the upward - going flux measured in the no @ xmath##0a the detector operates at 10 , 000 mhz . we want to reduce the upward - going proton trigger sensitivity to about 10 % or less , so a rejection of at least two orders of magnitude is required by the detector . of course , this effect can be achieved by keeping the sensitivity for upward - going signals very low . the energy available from dark matter detectors is temperature dependent ; therefore , energies from @ xmath30 . 5gev to 20 tev should be achieved with high sensitivity . for high - mass signal detection , no @ xmath0a will not be able to compete with the high sensitivity of the icecube no @ xcite . for low - mass signal ( no @ xmath320 gev ) the super - kamiokande detector probably has the highest acceptance @ xcite . if an effective upward - going proton trigger and effective cosmic microwave background radiation can be obtained , no @ xmath0a will be competitive with the kamiokande for all the energies above 20 gev / h @ xmath4 . one advantage that no @ xmath0a has compared to other detectors that perform successful experiments for dark matter detection is the abilitylow energy threshold for collisions . a 1 gev light ray travels about 10 ns through the no @ xmath0a , resulting in an energy threshold well below 1 gev . the trigger for the dark matter detector is avoiding hits by these high - energy particles . for shorter track lengths , the timing information may not be as powerful for rejecting upward - going backgrounds . either scattered or self - scattered , and using the top and bottom of the track to reject upward - going events will produce an effective two orders of magnitude resolution . in this case we rely on using the timing information from each of the tracks on the track to reject the downward - going background background and to reject upward - going backgrounds . the algorithm for upward - going backgrounds based on timing information is a slight improvement to the algorithm of the no @ xmath0a particle detector . this upgrade to the so - called ` ` multipoint ' ' algorithm occurred on december 31 , 2014 , and resulted immediately in a per - track timing resolution of about 10 ns ( note that the timing resolution with the previous algorithm was about 20 ns , so this is a slight improvement ) . with hundreds of hits per track , it is possible to reject upward - going backgrounds within two orders of( see the timing ##s ) . to determine the speed of the target system , the forward - pointing target computer takes advantage of the velocity calculated from each individual hit in the two views . the values are calculated using the hough - method , and are used to understand both the xz and yz views . we start from the beginning with the @ xmath5 - velocity , @ xmath6 , in the track in the yz view . the measured time of the next hit is defined as @ xmath7 . the velocity and measured time of each hit in the track in the yz view is thus : @ xmath8 and , for the xz view : @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 and @ xmath11 are the same values for xz and yz views , and @ xmath12 is the average mass in tdc ##Â² , which is related to mass by the factor of 0 . 625 kg / tdc . @ xmath13 is the time - of - flight of the target , defined as : @ xmath14 where @ xmath15 is the length in kilometers , and 0 . 97cm / s is the average speed , that the target##on reference required . since we know that the distance is measured and calculated in both views , ( @ xmath16 ; @ xmath6 ) and ( @ xmath17 ; @ xmath18 ) will correspond to the lowest and highest coordinates of the track respectively . in addition , we can calculate the entry points for a given track in either view without this problem . for the yz view , the distance can be calculated as follows : @ xmath19 cm , for the xz view : @ xmath20 where @ xmath21 cm and @ xmath22 cm are the coordinates of the cells and plane . the cell and plane with x = 0 have coordinates @ xmath23 cm and @ xmath24 cm . since for each hit in either view we can calculate ( x ; y ; z ) respectively , we can estimate the distance from the target to the apd entry point . the farther the beam is moved from the target the longer it takes for the beam to travel and be absorbed by the apd . we are interested in the propagation time of the light transmitted through the target , so we need to account for the actual propagation time through the ex. the speed of light in the cell is assumed to be 0 . 5 m / s . the energy level of each pixel of the individual @ xmath0a cell is typically set at 2 khz . the timing response to an incoming particle hitting itself in the cell can be parameterized in terms of the hit # ##s ( @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 ) , the number of hits ( @ xmath27 ) , and the ` ` ` hit ' ' ( @ xmath28 ) , or the average time between the knock - out and the point of impact of the particle : @ xmath29 ##a , @ xmath30 is a correction factor that does not affect the timing response . the values @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 correspond to the average falling and rising points of the response curve , respectively . as such , they are not correlated . for the purpose of calculating the response , the parameter of interest is @ xmath28 . by performing a single @ xmath31 calculation , the rising - point value of @ xmath28 can be calculated from multiple calculations on a single chip . for the case of the above , where thethe time can be calculated , and parameters are pre - calculated and adjusted so that the energy intensive process will not be repeated for each successive hit . an example of is the energy response response to multiple hits from a given single hit . the time delay of the time frame where the energy begins to accumulate is the [ simulation @ xmath28 . , width = 192 ] single - hit timing resolution is observed in simulation @ xmath0a magnetic field , with four - point trigger , before ( left ) and after ( right ) the grain boundary . see fig . @ xcite for more details . , width = 576 ] each timing resolution has an uncertainty , which varies with the amount of energy deposited . the time delay of a single hit from a single hit also affects the accuracy of the trigger , so a parameterization of resolution in terms of energy deposition is required for the time - domain analysis . single - hit timing resolution is measured against energy deposition in simulation . [ 1 : deltat ] . for high energy deposition the @ xmath32 is estimated to be ~ 2 ms from the start from the four - point trigger algorithm , which is consistent with that measured in simulation @ xcite . we .use the [ q : ytimes ] and [ p : xtimes ] to calculate the distribution of the expected v / s observed time for each particle . the expected versus observed time distribution for an upward - going particle track is in the x @ xmath0a mean field , with linear regression . the corresponding particle track ( a straight line ) has slope values equal to ` ` ` ' ' . the fit with the upward - going track , ( width = 1 ) is shown as the red - shaded line . the fit with the downward - going track is shown as the white shaded line and has a very good fit . , width = 384 ] an example of the v / s observed time distribution is shown in fig . [ fig : track _ slope ] . the curve is derived from a normal upward - going particle track measured with wimpsim @ xcite . as can be seen , the figures show a normal slope with a slope value consistent with the upward - going track , . it is clear from the figure that the normal slope values can be used to determine the particle velocity ( up or down ) . as shown in fig . [ fig : track _ slope ] , the slope values for cosmics and the##mpsim mc samples are fitted with the downward - and upward - going tracks , respectively . in the latter case , it is reasonable to assume that there are only two choices for the probability values . first , we can fit the mc samples on fig . [ fig : track _ 1 ] with probability values of 1 . for the upward - going tracks the fit with the slope equal to ` ` 1 ' ' results in a high @ xmath31 probability value of the result , @ xmath33 . then the fit with slope of ` ` - 1 ' ' produces a low probability value , @ xmath34 . combining the probability values from the fit with the fixed slope values , we can calculate the log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) : @ xmath35 the llr distributions for the mc and wimpsim mc samples are shown on fig . [ fig : track _ llr ] . from this picture , it is clear that a change in llr values of 3 will reduce the background signal to the required amount while maintaining a good image quality . note that the wimpsim mc distribution is for dark matter with ~ 1 gev background signal on the @ xmath36 sample . as for the wi##s from the z - axis can produce particles which , on average , have a much higher probability compared to the cosmic background sample . this is because the llr for the background has a mean value closer to 1 than the background rejection . the llr gives good results for predicting background rejection for the observed signal , in the case where the background rejection is large ( at least three orders of magnitude ) , leading to a reduction in the best - fit distribution . for example , for a background rejection of 0 . 5 the background rejection is by a factor of one more for the llr . at this rate the model assumes background rejection of up to four orders of magnitude . in addition to being a more robust model than used in the previous section , the llr model is more susceptible to mis - reconstruction , which can be an important factor in the data . since mis - reconstruction will result in slope distributions that support neither the upward - nor the downward - going signal , the probability of mis - reconstructed will have llr values close to ` ` ` ' ' , and will be consistent with the high - probability for the upward - going . the slope distributions for cosmics ( red ) and wimpsim ( blue ) , etc . , are= 576 ] the llr algorithm for cosmics ( red ) and wimpsim ( blue ) . ##s . detectors that can last less than 10 seconds and with fewer than 10 detectors are used . , width = 384 ] a time - based upward - going particle algorithm was developed for the no @ xmath0a ##z detector and first used in october 2014 . running no @ xmath37hz , the detector measures cosmic ray radiation by several orders of magnitude . on the left is a display of a triggered event that is a strong candidate , based on its topology , for an upward - going particle . the activity at the bottom right indicates a cc scattering interaction . the activity at the other end probably indicates that the particle travels upward . there is no evidence for a michel interaction , based on the timing used in the data . this also indicates that the llr algorithm is correctly detecting upward - going particles in the data . , length = " : : " , width = 384 ] on the right is a display of a triggered event that is a strong candidate , based on its topology , for an upward - going particle . the activity at the bottom right indicates a cc scattering interaction . the activity at the other end .note that the particles move upward . there is also evidence for a michel electron , shown on the adjacent diagram on the right . this also indicates that the llr detector is correctly selecting upward - moving particles from the detector . , t = " : : " , p = 192 ] as can be seen in fig . [ 1 : conc _ 1 ] , experiments with the michel ##s and other particles have been able to produce upward - going particles in the spontaneous sample . atmospheric events occurring on the other side of the detector are also capable of producing upward - moving particles in the sample . these observations provide an important tool for this study . the best way of distinguishing atmospheric trigger events from spontaneous events is to measure the mass of the contained particles , which has yet to be attempted in no @ xmath0a . the resulting spontaneous sample opens the door to a way to measure atmospheric triggering and sets the stage for a new dark matter search in the no @ xmath0a community . this public presentation was made possible by a grant from the university of virginia college of arts and sciences . additional financial support was provided by the ford foundation , the uvaphysics division , and the fermilab particle physics division . the authors also state that funding for this project is carried out by the fermilab scientific and technical institute . fermilab is supported by the ##lab institute , llc - contract no . 1 - ac02 - 07ch11359 with the united states department of energy . the university of california particle physics division is supported by nasa - sc0007838 . with j . a . hagelin , j . a . smith and a . j . smith , phys . ser * 2 * , 375 ( 1986 ) . j . buckley , r . j . cowen , m . profumo , j . smith , j . cahill - rowley , m . cotta , m . digel and m . drlica - _ _ _ , arxiv : 1310 . 7040 . j . fischler , j . smith , j . kowalkowski , j . smith , j . paterno and j . rechenmacher , j . phys . ser . * 396 * , 012020 ( 2012 ) .
