this model has a local component of density , which is more commonly known @ xcite . in recent years the local non - local component @ xcite has emerged as an experimental component @ xcite , and can be measured with high precision by the _ _ space _ experiment @ xcite . in the near future , as experimental data becomes more available , it will be possible to study the non - local components involved in a wide variety of processes , and to determine what conclusions will be drawn about super - universe inflation from the experimental study of local non - gaussianity . in this context , we propose a new method for studying the local non - gaussianity produced by near - universe inflation in two - dimensional models of inflation . our method is based on the free - space distribution of the parameter density on the local hypersurface , which can be thought of as a probability density function whose evolution is governed by a solution of the collisionless differential equation . using the cumulant of @ xcite to transform our density function into an exponential distribution , we obtain the differential equations which describe the evolution of this distribution . thus ,we see how these flows are related to the ##s , such as the dimensionless bispectrum generated by @ xmath1 @ xcite . we have some results which show that this method has good compatibility with previous methods . it is not necessary to make any assumptions about the resulting flow before finding a suitable source , and using the mean - motion method . since there are already several methods for determining the near - term contributions to @ xmath1 , including the commonly used @ xmath0 method , we find the method described above has a number of advantages . first , this new method is well suited to determining the local contributions to @ xmath1 . this is because we know the parameters of the inflaton ##s well , which makes it easy to determine the contributions to the density and other parameters . the scattering equation for the particle is nonlinear and has two distinct energy levels , which are related to the effects of the scattering effect on the system . this allows a good understanding of two possible causes of local non - gaussianity . one of these is the local non - locality associated with evolution of the probability density functions of the local hypersurfaces ; the other is the linear ##ityfrom the theory to the second peturbation , @ xmath2 . it would be difficult or impossible to understand this phenomenon in the context of other calculational methods , such as the standard @ xmath0 framework . the first step of our approach is compared with the computational complexity of its predecessor . special formulas for @ xmath1 are available for many fields , especially in the context of the @ xmath0 framework , but also for very small values of the mean @ xcite and the potential @ xcite . these formulas become more useful as the number of fields increases , especially if one considers higher order @ xcite . in the meantime , it is likely that analysis of complex systems with many fields will also depend on numerical integration . the standard @ xmath0 framework provides the solution to a system of ordinary differential equations which vary greatly with the number of fields . since complex models have millions of fields , this will be a significant problem @ xcite . however , the @ xmath0 framework relies heavily on a numerical integration method with higher order fields , since different solutions can be obtained from perturbatively different boundary conditions and @ xmath3 wave - functions of interest . moreover , the number ofcan be solved to high precision , since a single particle has the potential to explode . in this way we can solve our problem necessary to determine the distribution of particles in these models . our method is the solution to a system of differential equations which vary at least polynomially ( and in some cases , even exponential ) with the number of particles . it does not rely on the phase space , and it is much less sensitive to background noise . these advantages can be shared with other methods , such as the unified methods currently developed by lehners & renaux - petel @ xcite . a further advantage , to which we hope to add in a future paper , is that our method combines linear differential equations with source terms . from the analysis of these source terms , we see that it will be possible to determine those fundamental properties of the system which lead to the existence of the multi - gaussianities . this paper is summarized as follows . in [ ref : x _ fnl ] , we show how the non - zero model @ xmath1 can be represented in our paper . the model is in vector space , ( as opposed to euclidean space ) , which explains the difference between @ xmath1 and the multi -wave function of the inflaton field . our model for @ xmath1 draws a fine line between the contribution to non - gaussianity , and both the intrinsic nonlinearity of the gauge coupling and the gauge coupling between comoving and compact hypersurfaces . in [ sec : tensor ] , we present our model for the distribution of inflaton field strengths , which is the metric expansion " of a metric tensor " . we introduce the equations which describe the distribution of the components of this expansion in the one - and two - field models . in [ sec : numerics ] , we give a comparison of our new models and those presented in the literature . we derive @ xmath1 , from the two - field models , and show the consistency between them . we publish in [ sec : energy ] . in this paper , we present models in which @ xmath4 , and the reduced coupling constant @ xmath5 are equal to 1 . in this paper , we present our new method for calculating the non - gaussianity of @ xmath1 . this method has three main steps : a formula for the first term , @ xmath2 , in terms of the measured energy of thea local hypersurface ; formulas for the distribution of the strength of b - fields , @ xmath6 , as a function of their curvature at horizon exit ; and a formula for finding the curvature function from horizon exit to the horizon when we have the same values of @ xmath2 . the first two elements are given in sec . and , discussed at the levels of [ sec : derivative _ n ] and [ sec : derivative - s ] respectively . the third element is given in [ sec : sep ] . when it became clear that non - existence of the local gravitational field could be predicted by the wmap and _ _ _ _ _ @ xcite , the authors proposed second - order extensions of the curvature function . in this approach , the values of the curvature function are equal to the upper bound of the non - gaussianity @ xcite . this approach works better if isocurvature modes are used , so that the curvature function remains constant at horizon exit . in the more general case that isocurvature modes have curvature at superhorizon exit , the correlation ##s are time invariant . several methods have been proposed to describe this phenomenon . lyth &rodrguez @ xcite developed the @ xmath0 ##3 @ xcite beyond the ##ity . this approach is simple and well - suited to numerical calculations . rigopoulos , shellard and van gogh @ xcite started with a gradient approach , writing the above equations in langevin notation . the gradient model was used as a basis for the initial conditions for zero noise . a second ` classical ' gradient approach was taken up by langlois & vernizzi @ xcite . in its perturbative form , this approach has been used by lehners & renaux - petel to obtain numerical calculations @ xcite . a statistical approach has been developed by smith & smith @ xcite . what probability do we have of a given experiment ? consider a single observer , chosen at random from an ensemble of observers of interest . using one of the methods described above , we attempt to determine the statistical properties of the object , which would be observed by such an observer . these observers would have statistical properties which are very different from the curvature properties , but these statistical properties are irrelevant unless their effects are in evidence . suppose we have a collection of finite - dimensional spacetime ##s whosethis effect is expected to increase the total background radiation beyond a finite horizon . in three dimensions , each spacetime volume will follow a trajectory in the universe which is very different from the origin . the distance between them is determined by the parameter responsible for the expansion , which is obtained by limiting the kinetic energy to a small value . the trajectory function is a function of the trajectory followed by each particle in the universe , taken as a whole . one usually makes a prediction for a particular time . each spacetime volume follows a trajectory , which we denote with the notation @ xmath7 at a particular time , to be better known later . in this section , the ` @ xmath8 ' indicates trajectory on a relatively flat hypersurface . consider the distribution of the quantity of particles , @ xmath9 , which is a function of time . if we take the position @ xmath10 we can calculate the distribution of @ xmath9 , as the @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 ^ 2 , \ ] ] where we have calculated the weighted distribution of @ xmath9 , @ xmath14in ref . , @ xmath7 holds for a function of the number of variables . it is the @ xmath12 which gives the solutions . . in what we will call the general separate universe picture . it is often convenient to write @ xmath15 as the power series of the differential equation . in a different basis , the ` fid , ' @ xmath16 when . . is used to define the @ xmath12 , we progress to the ` perturbative ' separate universe picture . if all terms in the power series are equal , these two parts of the calculation are formally equivalent . in some cases , however , curvature may occur , or not at all . this situation is discussed in ref . although our calculation is generally perturbative , it is not formally equivalent to . . . we will discuss the application of our calculation to quantum field theory . [ see : ref ] . in contrast , the curvature of @ xmath2 produces large curvature in field theory ( especially in h - fields @ xmath6 ) , especially in a comoving hypersurface . in these cases , the curvature term is replaced by .##horizon inflation , which is a series of energy fluctuations occurring at a depth . in a single - field inflation , only two such fluctuations can be observed , which we call @ xmath17 . like the momentum , the potential energy density can also be a function of @ xmath17 position . for @ xmath18 , this can be re - represented as @ xmath19 where @ xmath1 is independent of the momentum . note the so - called ` ` null ' ' condition of non - gaussianity . this applies even when quantum mechanical effects can be ignored , making @ xmath2 a well - defined operator rather than a combination of and @ xcite . if this condition is satisfied , the value of @ xmath2 can be calculated and it follows that @ xmath1 can be determined by the equation @ xmath20 where we have shown that @ xmath2 is also independent , or equivalently that @ xmath21 . with @ xmath1 being independent , fig . 2 holds as for single - field inflation . in this case we can also use @ xmath##1 . applying g . to a single field with different boundary conditions , as in the case of lehners & renaux - petel @ xcite . where more than one field is involved , @ xmath1 will vary in value because it depends on the isocurvature modes . in this case we can assume @ xmath1 depends on a set of independent variables which is the normal distribution of isocurvature modes . is thus indispensible . in maldacena @ xcite , and in lyth & rodrguez @ xcite , we use g . for our definition of @ xmath1 , and for choice . in euclidean space , the coefficient @ xmath22 of g . depends on the coefficient @ xmath23 . more precisely , this follows from the definition of @ xmath12 , . . . in real space , this condition is only satisfied by considering the coefficients , and according to . . . to obtain , we require consideration of the difference between @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 . we then use the following formula , in which ` @ xmath8 ' is a smooth hypersurface with a fixed point. . the symbol @ xmath26 indicates the number of e - folds between this time slice and the nearby comoving hypersurface , where @ xmath27 is the density of dark - matter . the resulting change in time can be expressed in the following form : @ xmath28 where @ xmath29 . due to the assumption that the time slices are all outside the horizon , we are able to choose the time region covered by the hypersurface ` @ xmath8 ' at our time . in the second case , ` @ xmath8 ' is assumed to be a few e - folds from our choice of spacetime that is outside the event horizon @ xcite . this assumption has several consequences . first , we need to know the nature of the field fluctuations @ xmath30 ' at the time of its formation , where they can be estimated without the presence of field fluctuations @ xcite . second , as a consequence of the free - motion problem , the @ xmath31 is unknown at this time , leading to many problems . first , the @ xmath0 model describes the linear transformation from the state to @ xmath##30 to the physical model @ xmath2 . . . . , and , one knows that @ xmath1 can be reduced to a good approximation @ xcite @ xmath32 where @ xmath33 and for , we have chosen the ` @ xmath8 ' which is independent of observation . the similar result obtained for @ xmath34 . . is correct due to the large non - gaussianities involved in the differential equations at time 0 . as a way of computing @ xmath1 it is quite simple , and easy to use for many applications . however , it also concerns the problem which concerns @ xmath35 . for this reason it is possible to compute , from fig . 3 , those types of models for which @ xmath35 is sufficiently small or large . is not known . see , for example , [ . @ xcite . ] our algorithm is quite simple . we choose ` @ xmath8 ' to be at the horizon when we consider the physical model of @ xmath2 . the purpose of the @ xmath0 algorithm , etc . , is simply to compute _ of _ the _ values of the @ .##math36 and @ xmath2 . in [ sec : m - theory ] section , we show how the gauge field theory is obtained from the @ xmath0 model . in the next section we turn our attention to finding the formula for @ xmath1 under the assumption that the distribution of field values in ` @ xmath8 ' is linear . in [ sec : physics ] , we will solve the following equations to find the distribution of field values at horizon exit and ` @ xmath8 ' . although the @ xmath31 are all independent variables at horizon exit , they may be altered by their interactions . we will also allow for large - scale variations of the one - dimensional model . assuming that we are dealing with a collection of spacetime volumes in euclidean space , corresponding to an arbitrary scale , we define @ xmath37 @ xmath38 need not vary in time , but it must be a function of the scale which describes our collection of spacetime volumes . in all but the simplest cases it may vary in time . it is also possible to allow for the non - correlation among the @ xmath31 , which is small at horizon exit but gradually increasing . we define @ xmath39therefore , @ xmath40 should be expressed as a function of time and space . the various properties of the intrinsic value such that imply that , for example , @ xmath41 . when writing this , we take the values of fields such as @ xmath42 in reverse order . from the first ( @ xmath43 ) , three - point correlation , it follows that @ xmath44 . we come to the two - point theory , parametrized by : @ xmath45 and @ xmath46 . from , . , and , it follows that the three - point correlation of @ xmath2 is @ xmath47 the two - point correlation can be written @ xmath48 where we have added two additional terms , called ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' . the ` 1 ' term includes the terms _ _ _ _ non - interacting , those which arise from non - interacting interactions among the gauge fluctuations , @ xmath49 the ` 2 ' term includes non - those arising directly from the gauge fluctuations to @ xmath2 @ xmath50 the index of , . , can be used to describe thenon - negative values @ xmath1 . this makes it into the derivative @ xmath51 , which we shall discuss in more detail in [ category : numerics ] . to compute @ xmath1 in real terms , we need expressions for the derivatives @ xmath52 and @ xmath34 . for the first and second derivatives , these are easy to compute . lyth & rodrguez @ xcite use numerical integration , which is valid for arbitrary real and complex jelly - roll functions . vernizzi & rossi @ xcite obtained derivatives on a finite - dimensional model with an infinite sum - complete universe by applying the generalized derivative in the space of dimensions . their method was extended to other models by battefeld & easther @ xcite . sum - complete models can be computed by the same method @ xcite . an alternative approach has been developed by yokoyama _ _ @ xcite . a further problem exists in the general case , because we only consider the continuous functions on compact and comoving hypersurfaces which exist in the real universe . for the function @ xmath27 , and to all points of thedie - drop method , the method of 3 - cycles @ xmath6 between the free hypersurface ` @ xmath8 ' and the comoving hypersurface ` @ xmath53 ' = @ xmath54 where @ xmath55 and @ xmath56 are the potential ##s acting on ` @ xmath8 ' and ` @ xmath53 , ' respectively . by the phase factor of @ xmath57 , we show that @ xmath52 = @ xmath58 and that this holds for an ` @ xmath59 , which does not transform into the direct - sum of solutions for the same ` @ xmath27 . in addition a contribution from outside of the integrand is required , which allows f . ##rn to extend the solution of f . @ xcite to an arbitrary species . this problem arises in light of our observation that ` @ xmath8 ' and ` @ xmath53 ' are infinitesimally small . to extend @ xmath60 it is necessary to use the term @ xmath61 , which in the direct - sum case agrees withthe fundamental theorem of vernizzi & co @ xcite . for our first choice of a two - dimensional model , this takes the form @ xmath62 where the terms are conserved for a single large hypersurface . for an @ xmath63 - dimensional model , we would have @ xmath64 the relations which are the isocurvature relations . the calculation of these quantities is given in ref . @ xcite . for # - ##mation , one can see from the equations of motion that @ xmath61 is conserved with variation up to first order for slow - roll . it is not conserved for stationary particles , but the derivative can be neglected for infinitesimally small hypersurfaces . for each choice of parameters , @ xmath61 , according to the equations @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 the comoving hypersurface ` @ xmath53 ' is given by @ xmath67 we have assuming that the slow - roll condition holds , and that the kinetic energy can be neglected in combination with the derivative @ xmath59 . thus , ` @ xmath53 ' we have @ xmath68 where the##qs . , and we obtain similarly for @ xmath60 , and @ xmath69 where we have obtained @ xmath70 ##a . can also be derived without use of @ xmath61 by replacing ref . with the derivatives of ref . @ xcite , which are derived using the same theory . thus , we obtain @ xmath71 to obtain , we consider the partial derivatives of @ xmath6 . these can be derived directly from , by application of ref . . we obtain @ xmath72 ^ \ theta \ sin ^ 2 \ theta + 1 \ left ( \ frac { 1 } { v _ { , 1 } } \ right ) ^ { \ le ##q } \ sin ^ 2 \ theta \ \ \ hspace { - \ theta } \ mbox { } \ right \ left [ \ frac { v _ { , 1 } } { 1 } \ sin ^ 2 \ theta - \ frac { v _ { , 1 } v _ { , 1 } } { { v _ { , 1 } } \ sin ^ 2 \ theta - \ left ( \ frac { v _ { , 1 } } { 1} - \ frac { v _ { , 1 } } { } } + \ frac { v _ { , 1 } v _ { , 1 } } { ( v _ { , 1 } } \ right ) \ theta ^ 2 \ theta \ theta ^ [ \ theta \ right ] ^ c . \ end { 1 } \ ] ] an alternative expression for @ xmath73 can be obtained from the second expression @ xmath74 . the final result is @ xmath75 ^ 2 \ \ \ hspace { - 1 } } \ mbox { } + \ theta ^ 2 \ theta \ left ( \ frac { v _ { , 1 } } { v _ { , 1 } } - \ frac { v _ _ { , 2 } } { v _ { , 1 } ^ 2 } \ right ) ^ c . \ end { 1 } \ ] ] now that the exchange is complete , we can use the expressions ` @ xmath8 ' and ` @ xmath53 , ' since the linear map is the same for any hypersurface . once this is done it can be shown that ( see below ) , . is true for the first@ xmath76 . in this case we refer to the rate of change between arrival time and the time of exit , and to the function which relates the values of the particles at these two times . we start by considering the one - field case , which lacks the computational power of the two - field case , but it has some interesting features which are useful . among these features are the phase relationship and distribution of the background particle and the background field components , and the shape of the correlation functions . moreover , the behavior of the particle ##a process is similar to that which occurs in the two - field case . for this reason , the one - field case is an excellent example of the method we want to use . suppose that we are in a universe with a population of very large spacetime ##s , each with a very different time scale , and the sum of these scales is the smoothed background field with a different time frequency . in each case the smoothed background field @ xmath77 has a mean , given by the correlation function @ xmath78 , where in this case we are using the notation ` @ xmath8 ' for each of the local hypersurfaces . our solutionone is to use the first bispectrum , @ xmath1 , which is the third moment of @ xmath78 . in the theory of probability this is the distribution , which we call @ xmath42 . the normal distribution has mean zero , and the theory assumes that the variance is zero . for this reason , rather than using a distribution with non - zero third moment , as described in ref . @ xcite , we can use the moments as perturbative corrections to the variance . such a distribution is known as the _ cumulant expansion _ . the problem of cumulant expansion is a fundamental problem in probability theory . we consider a distribution with variance @ xmath79 , mean @ xmath80 , and variance @ xmath42 , with the three moments described by @ xmath81 and @ xmath42 respectively . a distribution with these moments is @ xmath82 , \ ] ] where @ xmath83 \ ] ] is the normal distribution and @ xmath84 is the @ xmath85 hermite distribution , for which there are several naming conventions . wedefine to be such that @ xmath86 which means that the first value of @ xmath87 is @ xmath88 . this is sometimes called the ` ` probabilist notation ' . ' ' we define the distribution @ xmath89 by the following parameters , @ xmath90 the probability density function in fig . 2 the parameters , and do not depend on the probability that @ xmath42 is positive . however , for large @ xmath42 the density function will be negative for large values of @ xmath77 . it thus fails to be a probability density in the strict sense . this does not pose a problem in practice , since we are interested in distributions which are strictly bounded , and for which @ xmath42 will always be positive . however , our main use of etc . is as a statistical tool to determine the expectation for the distribution . for this reason we do not know whether @ xmath78 is an exact probability density function in the # ##est case . ] @ xmath91 the distributions @ xmath79 , @ xmath81 , and @ xmath42 will be time - dependent , with theof the probability distributions in question can be obtained by computing the coefficients for these distributions . the density function defined in ref . is well - known and has been used in many applications . it is a solution to the problem of finding a non - periodic distribution whose components are periodic . ( [ x : p1d ] ) is in fact the first two terms of the _ _ charlier ` a ' series _ , also sometimes called the _ hermite series _ . in recent years it has found many applications to physics , of which our description is similar to that of taylor & taylor @ xcite . other applications are described in ref . @ xcite . for a discussion of the ` a ' series and other non - periodic probability distributions from an applied perspective , see @ xcite . in this article , we will refer to ref . and its recent extension to three dimensions as the ` ` density function . ' ' in the mean - motion case , the expansion of the spacetime ##time has a unique equation of motion @ xmath92 where @ xmath6 is the number of sub - moments of time . we refer to @ xmath93 as the expansion constant . thus @ .##math94 for the fixed point @ xmath79 and @ xmath95 where @ xmath96 the value of @ xmath79 varies with time , so the transport equation is time - dependent . however , we do not assume that the velocity field is _ _ _ well - described by a linear power series , but rather that it is well - described as varying in the direction of the fixed point . we take the velocity field to second order , although in practice this expansion could be extended to higher speeds . it helps to see how the probability density varies with time . conservation of energy according to the transport equation @ xmath97 ##9 . can also be interpreted as the expansion of the linear kolmogorov distribution where the probability of an observation goes to zero . it is well known for us , from the work of starobinsky , ##nr , which is the basis of the current approach to transport @ xcite that the choice of the gauge in this distribution is different , with different values corresponding to the choice of a different gauge . we have decided to use the self - consistent model , @ xmath6 , which means that we are testing the existence of hyper##surfaces of taylor series . these are the linear independent hypersurfaces whose boundary lines are the @ xmath0 as denoted by [ x : x _ fnl ] . in general , etc . cannot be solved directly . in practice it is possible to find solutions for the case of @ xmath98 , giving the equations for @ xmath79 , @ xmath81 and @ xmath42 . to do this , we need to solve this . into a hermite series of the form @ xmath99 the hermite series is linear independent , and application of the boundary conditions implies that the @ xmath100 will also vanish . this leads to a system of equations @ xmath101 , which we refer to as the evolution equation . at the top of the table , the equation @ xmath102 is zero and implies conservation of energy . the second non - zero equation is @ xmath103 and gives the evolution equation for the equations @ xmath79 , @ xmath104 the evolution equation on the right - hand side moves the particle through the gravitational field , as one would expect depending onthe background equation of motion , . . . 2 , the evolution equation shows that the density is strongly increased when the wings of the probability distribution cross the local velocity field . this effect is not predicted by the background equation of motion . if we are in a system with @ xmath105 , then the center of the density function will be moving faster than the wings . therefore , the density of the center will be greater than one would expect without paying attention to @ xmath79 . therefore , the probability density function is , giving the approximation to the background equation of motion . the equations for the distributions @ xmath80 and and @ xmath42 are : after considering @ xmath106 , and @ xmath107 in both cases , the second term on the right - hand side shows how @ xmath81 and @ xmath42 scale as the density function expands and contracts in proportion to the velocity field . these terms cause @ xmath80 and @ xmath42 to scale in proportion to the velocity field . thus , if we can ignore the two terms in the equation above , one finds that @ xmath108 and @ xmath109 . thistherefore , our account for the effects of these moments . also , these terms account for the jacobians associated with the moments induced by the process @ xmath93 . for reference to the non - gaussianity , the two moments are and are very useful . these terms describe how each moment is different from other moments and the interaction of the density function with the velocity field . in the example above , if we are in the region where @ xmath105 , the tails of the density function are growing faster than the heads . this means that one moment is shrinking and the head is growing , changing the probability distribution . the opposite happens when @ xmath110 . these effects are caused by the second moment in . thus , by extending our pdf to the first moment , and our velocity field to higher moments , we are able to obtain a set of field equations which describe the higher - order velocity fields for each moment . there is no significant change as we move from one moment to another . the field equations are more general in nature . our main problem is the restriction of the pdf ##s to two moments , allowing for the calculation of interactions between the moments . with this restriction , we can work out the moments whosethis is very similar to those found in the single - field system . the two - field system is described by a two - dimensional vector , @ xmath111 , defined by @ xmath112 where . we are using the product of two - fields @ xmath6 as the correlation constant . the term @ xmath27 has values in @ xmath113 . although we think it is possible that our assumptions apply to any number of fields , we have only ever used them for the two - field system . it will become clear later , some assumptions in this section apply only for two fields , and so we make no assumptions at all for systems with two or more fields . the two - dimensional field case is @ xmath114 = 0 . \ ] ] , and in the following we have returned to our assumption that the correlation ##s are used . as in the single - field system , we have a probability distribution which is not symmetric , but has a certain non - negative variance . that is @ xmath115 where @ xmath116 is the symmetric probability distribution , defined by @ xmath117 . \ ] ] in this case , @ xmath##118 describes the statistics of the distribution and @ xmath119 describes the order of the coefficients . we write the standard parametrization in terms of coefficients @ xmath120 and a single coefficient @ xmath121 , @ xmath122 the coefficient @ xmath81 represents one - dimensional statistics of the distribution , @ xmath123 the coefficients are represented by @ xmath124 . before stating this problem , it is necessary to consider and solve the problem involved in this . which is not addressed in the single - coefficient case . to obtain the solution of the system problem from the moment hierarchy , viz . , we used the definition of , and found that all of the hermite polynomials form the matrix @ xmath101 . however , hermite polynomials of the [ @ xmath125 $ ] are _ _ _ equal to the taylor expansion of . . . . the expansion according to and . the moment hierarchy would involve linear combinations of the coefficients . the problem is therefore an open problem of non - orthogonalization . to solve this problem it is necessary to find the identity matrix @ xmath##119 , placing the variables @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 for which fig . 119 into the set of probability measures for which the variables @ xmath128 and @ xmath129 are not invariant . the corresponding measures are @ xmath130 \ ] ] and @ xmath131 . \ ] ] a similar expression for @ xmath116 can be defined in terms of @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 , @ xmath132 we can define the non - negative function , which includes the constant , to be @ xmath133 in these cases we have @ xmath134 , and @ xmath135 . in general , we define @ xmath136 in general for all . to be valid , it is necessary to define the variables associated with the two variables @ xmath137 in terms of @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 . by definition , these are @ xmath138 by solving for the values of these variables and the expected value of x . we arrive at the following@ xmath139 the functions @ xmath118 , @ xmath38 and @ xmath40 are time - independent , but for simplicity we will simply ignore this in our calculations . next we will consider the time domain , which includes values of @ xmath118 , @ xmath140 , @ xmath121 and @ xmath40 . we change the state vector of the function of the first moment @ xmath118 back to @ xmath141 where we have become @ xmath142 . in the single - particle case , these values are independent of time and vary with the position of the particle . the theory can be extended to two dimensions if desired . our definition of @ xmath126 and @ xmath127 shows that the mean - square wave function can be written as a pseudo - hermite polynomial , @ xmath143 = [ _ n \ , _ { m , n \ # ##q } p _ { x } h _ m ( x ) p _ m ( x ) = [ . \ ] ] because the hermite polynomials are polynomials of the form given by @ xmath116 , wein the moment hierarchy @ xmath144 we replaced the moment " @ xmath145 of the moment @ xmath146 with @ xmath147 . we started the velocity field out at first order , and our initial distribution had only the first five moments . it follows that moment @ xmath146 with rank 5 or more is nonzero . if we extended the velocity field to higher orders , and added additional moments in the moment hierarchy , we would have non - zero first - order moments . addition of additional moments is a slight modification of our distribution and can be found in the table we use here . a notable modification of the distribution is 1 . 2 that the rank - @ xmath145 coefficients are the coefficients for the rank - @ xmath145 coefficients . put simply as such , the equations that come from are very simple . however , when expressed as phase - space equations , they can be expressed in a very simple way . : : the rank - 1 coefficient @ xmath148 is well defined . this reflects the fact that the moment distribution is defined as the density is . : : the rank - 1 coefficient @ xmat##h149 and @ xmath150 give evolution equations for the correlation @ xmath118 . these equations can be written for the correlation @ xmath151 we tell the reader that : and here , and in @ xmath152 , @ xmath153 and @ xmath154 describe the velocity field and its components starting from the correlation @ xmath118 . the first term , describes the non - uniform distribution of the correlation , which varies with the average velocity field of . . . the second term describes how the components of the probability distribution affect the velocity field at different points . narrow probability distributions have small components of @ xmath119 and therefore are more sensitive to the mean value of @ xmath155 . wide probability distributions have large components of @ xmath119 and are therefore more sensitive to the velocity field coming from the center . : : the 1 - 2 terms @ xmath156 , @ xmath157 and @ xmath158 give evolution equations for the correlation @ xmath120 and the correlation @ xmath121 . these can also be written as evolution equations for the: @ xmath119 @ xmath159 this term describes the translation and rotation of @ xmath119 . it is affected by the velocity field . it has a relationship to the rotation of the probability distribution , in a manner similar to the rotation equation used above . thus the point @ xmath40 serves as the basis for the rotation ##s . : : the order - 1 coefficients @ xmath160 , @ xmath161 , @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 describe properties of the point @ xmath40 . these are @ xmath164 the first term describes how the moments change into each other as the velocity field changes and changes the @ xmath165 coordinate frame back to the @ xmath137 coordinate frame . the second term describes effects of non - gaussianity from changes of the velocity field and the spatial dimensions of the probability distribution . the second - order coefficients in our case , those of dimensions four and five are also nonzero , but do not represent the time evolution ##s . these coefficients are the moments " obtained by changing the moments " . if we have any other cumulants, these higher - order terms would have generated evolution equations for the higher orders of the probability distribution . in general , all orders of the distribution function can exist . it is not possible to perform our calculations in a single step , for cumulants and moments of the random variable . the order we have chosen is sufficient to generate evolution equations for all the higher - order terms of the distribution function , the leading terms in and . , and and the leading terms , appear as the first terms in these equations . at this point we put our new method into practice . we select the models for which the non - linear behavior is not known , using the @ @ xmath0 approach . for each model we define our method and compare it with that obtained by @ xmath0 . to obtain a better result , we generate equations for these models . our new method uses the slow - roll approach , as described above . however , when using the @ xmath0 approach we obtain , , with and without slow - roll approaches . we use the taylor series , which were developed by rigopoulos , shellard & de jong @ xcite and extended by vernizzi & weiss @ xcite. the result is @ xmath166 we use the boundary conditions shown in fig . @ xcite , where @ xmath167 , and the resulting equation with parameters @ xmath168 and @ xmath169 . we plot the derivatives of @ xmath1 in fig . [ fig1 ] , which also takes the form of the corresponding @ xmath0 formula ( with and without the die ##bold effect ) . we use the @ xmath0 formula using the finite element method to plot the derivatives of @ xmath6 . a similar method is used for inflation . this method has a very large non - linear value , approaching zero value at the peak . if one moves away from the peak , @ xmath1 is left invariant . note that the theory of gauge transformations allows us to make corrections to @ xmath1 from the relative non - gaussianity of the gauge transformation , and non - dependence of the gauge transformation to @ xmath2 . as shown in [ x : x _ t ] , we plot the former @ xmath170 and the latter @ xmath171 , and plot them together in fig .[ fig2 ] . analysis of this model also shows that @ xmath1 is generated by partial integration of two much smaller signals . the peak shape and size are directly proportional to their respective sizes . thus , the peaks of @ xmath170 and @ xmath171 cancel , but their size remains constant . the signal in fig . [ fig1 ] comes from the peak of @ xmath171 , which is then replaced by @ xmath170 . it is possible that @ xmath170 also acts in direct response to the fourier transform , to which it is also directly proportional . in the single peak model , @ xmath1 is completely unstable . however , it has recently been shown by byrnes _ _ that a completely quasi - stable signal can be generated even when beta - decay is a good approximation @ xcite . the conditions for this to happen are well known , but they require a careful choice of parameters and careful interpretation of the model . in fig . [ fig3 ] [ fig4 ] we see the peak of @ xmath1 in the model with the peak @ xmath172 which corresponds to model 1 of experiment . * ( )when we use @ xmath173 and a ##ize @ xmath174 , @ xmath175 . it is clear that the result is good . in this case , @ xmath1 is being replaced by the results from the first - generation quantum theory , @ xmath171 , as shown in fig . [ fig4 ] . this result applies also to the two non - @ xmath1 experiments shown in fig . @ xcite , although we make the assumption that this is a # ##ization . in addition , fig . [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] show good agreement between our new results and the results of the original @ xmath0 experiment . these examples also use the initial ##a ##3 and @ xmath0 without the slow - roll approximation . we conclude that the slow - roll approximation is perfectly consistent over the entire experiment . non - observations are now being excluded from real - time observations of the microwave background radiation . our aim in this regard has been to develop a new method with which to measure the microwave background . our experiments now show good information about the results of @ xmath1 , and in the next few years we expect that the _@ _ x ##cite to make these assumptions more clear . it is also expected that higher - order quantities , such as the kurtosis of @ xmath176 @ xcite will be larger than @ xcite . to meet the needs of the scientific community for comparison with nature , accurate calculations of these non - linear quantities may be required for many aspects of real - world physics . a review of the literature shows that the ` moment ' @ xmath0 method , as proposed by lyth & rodrguez , is the method of choice for the calculations of non - gaussianity . in general , our ` moment ' method has two key advantages . first , the moment method works well when we apply the @ xmath0 formula to the flat hypersurface immediately after horizon exit . in our case , we make the same choice and consider the flat hypersurface as close as possible to the point of observation . in this , the purpose of the @ xmath0 formula is to describe much more than the non - linear time delay between field exit and the horizon boundary . we use the theory of field fluctuations to describe the rate of field fluctuations between horizon exit and observation . second , when considering the moment function one finds thatexpansion of the series , such as the one given above . . . this process is repeated at each level of calculation , and the result is equivalent to the perturbative method in a very similar way to renormalization - group - based theory @ xcite . in this case , solutions of @ xmath111 play the role of solutions . at a higher level , @ xmath177 , in the time domain , the expressions for first - order and for the renormalization group and for the solutions at infinity - @ xmath177 , resumming in time domain until they reach # ##s . this result is achieved with a method such as @ xmath0 which is non - perturbative in time domain , which can be an advantage in dealing with perturbative methods . we will note that although @ xmath0 is non - perturbative from a point of view , its solutions are also perturbative . for example , the work of vernizzi & weiss @ xcite and battefeld & easther @ xcite focuses on the construction of solutions which are stable up to first order , @ xmath17##8 , and will gain interest in @ xmath179 re - test . these results show that our method gives results in perfect agreement with previous results . as a by - product of our results , we note that the local non - gaussianities which have already been observed for sum - and non - linear systems @ xcite are dominated by non - linear from the second - order derivatives of the coordinate transformations from @ xmath180 to @ xmath2 . the contribution from the non - linear of the field fluctuations , dominated by the transformation @ xmath40 , is large . in these cases we can obtain a new estimate for @ xmath1 by considering the field fluctuations as being intrinsic linear . the non - gaussianity observed in these cases results from the geometry of comoving hypersurfaces with respect to the locally tangent hypersurfaces . our new method uses two well - known methods for measuring non - linear ##ities of the metric tensor . from our results , these methods give different estimates of @ xmath1 , and they do not always match . each method requires certain assumptions , such as the existence ofthey indicate the extent to which this information can be used . the statistical uncertainty between these methods can be compared to the statistical uncertainty involved in the calculation of @ xmath1 . the comparison table in [ ref : numerics ] shows that while some of these methods may differ , the statistical sampling method provides a comparison with other statistical methods . it is supported by the british centre for theoretical physics ( ds ) . it is supported by stfc . dw has support from the bbc . we would like to thank chris byrnes , jim lidsey and karim khan for their assistance . _ j . falk , s . rangarajan , and m . srednicki , _ the time evolution of the three -
