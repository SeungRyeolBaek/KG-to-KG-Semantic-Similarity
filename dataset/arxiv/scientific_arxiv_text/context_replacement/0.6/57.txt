in the field of spin glasses , much attention has been paid either exprimentally or directly to the study of spin glasses . however , our knowledge of them historically has been limited @ xcite . on this level , most of the recent studies have focused on the properties of the simple ising sg , using the three - dimensional ( 3d ) maxwell - einstein ( ha ) model . although the existence of a true simple spin - glass ( sg ) structure has been demonstrated for this material in zero field , the question of its existence or existence in other fields has remained open . this question is closely related to the much debated question of whether the ordered state of the simple ising sg in zero field is a replica - like structure ( rsb ) or not . if one wants to study the crystalline # ##s , one has to assume that those of other crystalline materials have more or less glass - like structures than ising , in the sense that the local magnetic interaction is much stronger than the local weak interaction @ xcite . for example , the commonly used simple spin glasses , _ i . e . _ , in spin glasses such as aufe , agmn and ag##n , the local interaction resulting from the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction . the local interaction is usually one or two times larger than the isotropic rkky interaction . numerical simulations have shown that the classical 3d - sg with long - range symmetry does not undergo the true sg transition at zero temperature in the field @ xcite . ( see , see also ref . @ xcite . ) since applied fields generally tend to ignore the sg order , a true thermodynamic sg transition is much more likely under applied fields in terms of the 3d casimir effect . recently , however , a rather unusual arc - like behavior has been observed under applied fields and 3d p - type field theory , although it is not completely clear whether the observed behavior corresponds to a true thermodynamic sg @ xcite . the result is in contrast to the zero - temperature case where the existence of a true classical sg transition has been confirmed in @ xcite . setting aside the issue of the mathematical nature of the term ` ` ' ' ' , it was also shown that a strong applied field exploits the zero - field sg transition process very effectively . for such fields, the ` ` ` temperature ' ' is much more relevant to experiments , where the ` ` ` temperature ' ' has much higher field strength @ xcite . ` observations of the ` transition ` under magnetic fields @ xmath0 were originally explained in terms of the mean - field model @ xcite . however , the mean - field anderson - kirkpatrick ( sk ) line @ xcite with the infinite - range sk model associated with non - magnetic fields has a spectral pattern similar to the normal line @ xcite , _ i . e . _ , the so - called inverse almeida - thouless ( gt ) line @ xcite @ xmath1 in weak - field regime where the temperature is small , and the gabay - almeida ( gt ) line @ xcite @ xmath2 in strong - field regime where the temperature is important . however , if one assumes that the ` transition - temperature ` under magnetic fields , while occurring in the infinite - range sk model , is unlikely to occur in the more accurate infinite - range sk model , the actual use of the mean - field model in interpreting the observed phase transition should be regarded with some skepticism . indeed ,the question of the exact nature of the experimental observed sg ` ` transition ' ' in magnetic materials remains open . however , one of the original authors has proposed a solution , the fig - chirality self - recoupling problem , aimed at solving some of the problems of the experimental observed sg transition @ xcite . in this scenario , _ chirality _ , which is a multispin operator in the theory for the description of locally noncoplanar spin structures induced by spin interactions , plays an important role . as shown in fig . [ fig - chiral ] , locally noncoplanar spin structures corresponding to the same spin state have two mutually equivalent ` ` chiral ' ' states , ` ` right - handed ' ' and ` ` left - handed ' ' states , characterized by the corresponding values of the ` ` chiralities ' ' . thus , we can denote the local chirality by _ and _ and _ states @ xmath3 , @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 and , @ xmath6 this type of chirality is called ` ` local chirality ' ' , in analogy with ` ` spin chirality' ' , as the dot product of two distinct # ##sons , @ xmath7 @ xcite . note that the chirality described by sg . ( [ chidef ] ) is a pseudoscalar in the sense that it is invariant under the @ xmath8 spin reflections but changes its sign under @ xmath9 spin reflections ( spin reflections which can be seen as a combination of reflection and rotation ) . - @ xmath10 has two distinct nuclear spins . ] for a completely ordered state , , in particular , the chirality description of sg . @ xcite involves the formation of a global _ chiral - glass _ ordered state in which only the chirality has a global long - range invariant ( lro ) while the rest remains unchanged . in the chiral - ordered state , among the other states of the hamiltonian , @ xmath11 , only the @ xmath9 spin rotation ( dc ) symmetry is preserved , with only the @ xmath8 spin reflection symmetry remaining . note that this also includes the novel - chirality ( global @ xmath12 ) based on spin -and time scale : however , although the chirality is completely independent of the spin on the time scale , it still exhibits a long - term structure completely independent from the spin . " the chiral - glass transition without the observed spin - spin transition was first observed in the experimental and on - line monte carlo ( sg ) simulations of the system performed by hukushima and one of the researchers ( a . s . ) @ xcite . it was also observed , that the magnetic moments associated with the chiral - glass transition were different from those of the ising model , and that the chiral - glass transition also had a quantum - spin - spin transition rsb . in the chirality simulation of a . @ xcite , " the transition in real heisneberg - like sg ##s is shown , as a chiral - glass transition ` ` induced ' ' via the random magnetic field . ' the ' random ' field applied to sg # ` ` recouples ' ' the contribution to the chirality , and the chiral - glass transition presents itself as an easily observed _ _ _ - glass transition in real heisneberg - like sg ##s . an important part of this simulation isthat the value of ##l is determined by the chiral - glass transition of the completely homogeneous system , _ and by the mean - field transition of the fully homogeneous system _ , which has been derived from the chiral ##ity . more recently , the same authors discussed some of the possible effects of the chirality transition of ref . @ xcite on the low - temperature behaviour of the fully homogeneous system of ref @ xcite . it was pointed out that the chiral - glass transition , although of the same form as the mean - field transition , occurs only in weak fields . in the weak field model , the gt line is shown to exist at @ xmath13 where @ xmath14 and @ xmath10 are positive . thus , the sg @ xmath14 could be either positive or negative . an important point here is that the chiral - glass transition line ( [ eqn : phaseline ] ) aparrently has a form similar to the gt line of the mean - field transition . we see , however , that their exact form is quite different . the time evolution of the chiral - glass transition line is that of # ##ity , whereas that of the gt - line isthe sk model should not be called sg . in the present paper , we rely on our results of large - scale monte carlo simulations of the fully developed sk model , and with the aim to clarify the spin structure of applied fields in terms of the chirality order . in addition , by means of our numerical simulations , we attempt to clarify in detail how the sg and the chirality order affect applied fields . some of the simulation results have been published in ref . @ xcite . the present paper is presented as follows . in [ secmodel ] , we describe our model and present some of the results of our simulation results . the physical properties obtained from our numerical simulations are presented in [ secphysq ] . the results of the simulations are presented in [ secresult ] . the results for the chirality - and spin - invariant models are presented in [ subsecchiral ] and [ subsecspin ] , respectively . it is known that the chiral - glass transition , although of the same type as the spin - spin transition , occurs in many materials . the chiral - glass transition transition is a multi - unit - scale of self - lattice transition in the chiral state , and it does not occurthe mean - glass transition corresponds to the magnetic transition . the details of the chiral - glass transition are described in [ subseccritical ] . the analysis shows that the equivalence relation of both the mean - field and mean - field chiral - glass transitions may be satisfied , which , however , differs from that of the solid model ising ##lass . in [ subsecphase ] , we have a simplified phase diagram of the transition . the chiral - glass transition line is not stable against magnetic fields , but the chiral - glass transition behavior under magnetic fields is a dependence of the gt ##o of the mean - field transition . the [ following ] is open to discussion and discussion . our numerical methods are presented in terms of the first two results on gt ##ly . in this article , we describe our results and explain some of the details of our numerical methods . the model we use is the 2d 3d solid model on the 3 - 2d plane described by the hamiltonian , @ xmath15 where @ xmath16 is the two - dimensional state vector , and @ xmath17 is the direction of the field vector along the @ xmath18 axis . the nearest - neighbor of @ xmath19 is theto decide on the structure @ xmath20 or @ xmath21 with high probability ( @ xmath22 % ) . we perform the simulation ##m for this structure . simulations are performed for a number of structures @ xmath23 , 0 . 5 , 1 . 5 , 2 . 0 , 3 . 0 , and 4 . 0 , while the real simulations are performed for @ xmath24 and 4 . 0 . the structures used are cubic - cubic , with @ xmath25 and with @ xmath26 , 8 , 10 , 12 and 16 with different boundary conditions . the data is taken for 128 - 1400 ##0 bond numbers , depending on the bond number @ xmath27 and the bond number @ xmath17 . small amount of data is also taken for @ xmath28 in some cases ( small samples only ) to study the temperature dependence of the bond properties . to achieve the thermalization , we replace the traditional heat - source technique with the heat - sink technique @ xcite . care is taken to make sure that the system is properly cooled . this is achieved by the following steps : first , we allow the system to move back and forth several times during the thetemperature - exchange times ( usually less than two minutes ) determine the maximum and minimum melting points , and at the same time ensure that the relaxation time to the first temperature - exchange process is very short at the second temperature , whose relaxation time consists of three @ xmath29 monte carlo steps per second ( t ) . this means that different regions of the phase space are sampled in each ` ` step ' ' of the temperature - exchange process . thus , we test the parameters of the model against at least three or three times for each set of samples . the values of these quantities are determined by the sample - to - sample statistical analysis of different samples . the parameters of our monte carlo simulations are described by the [ f - notation ] . in this way , we define the physical models used in our simulations as . [ defquantity ] let us start with the definition of the chirality . we define the absolute chirality in the @ xmath30 - th site and in the @ xmath31 - th site , @ xmath32 , for the different physical models by the formula @ xmath33 where @ xmath34 is the correlation vector of the @ xmath31 - th. . using this definition , there are in the @ xmath35 different chiral ##ities of the system . the average local average of the chirality , @ xmath36 , may be defined by @ xmath37 \ \ , \ ] ] where @ xmath38 is the local average and [ @ xmath39 the average of the spin length . this amplitude is for local spin structures , and this value tells us the extent of the noncoplanarity of the local spin structure . by considering two independent systems ( ` ` and ' ' ) governed by the same hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) , we may obtain the average of the chiral ##ity via the expression , @ xmath40 where @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 are the chiral ##ity of the order 1 and 2 , respectively . in our example , we compare the independent systems 1 and 2 by considering two independent systems of states in equilibrium with different local boundary conditions and different numbers of quantum states . in terms of this chiral variable @ xmath43 , the chiral - valued ##y value may be defined by @ xmath44 \ \ , \ ] ] where the average chiral -the coupling can be defined as @ xmath45 \ \ . \ ] ] like the glass coupling , the relative order of the chirality is temperature changes only . in order to take advantage of this short - term temperature change , we can consider the full chiral - glass coupling at @ xmath46 and the partial chiral - glass coupling @ xmath47 . dividing @ xmath48 and @ xmath49 by the values of @ xmath36 , @ xmath50 the characteristic function of the chirality is given by @ xmath51 } { [ \ langle { _ { \ . } ^ { \ rangle ] ^ { } \ . ) \ \ . \ ] ] we can also define the characteristic function of the chiral ##ity @ xmath43 \ @ xmath52 \ \ . \ ] ] in order to understand the initial state of the system , we can consider the autocorrelation function of the chirality defined by @ xmath53 \ \ . \ . { cxt } \ ] ] where the ` ` ' ' ' @ xmath54 is defined in terms of time . the time ( [ \##xt ] ) , which is performed similarly to the standard heat - capacity method without the temperature - exchange procedure , and the equilibrium spin configuration of @ xmath55 is derived from the equilibrium spin configuration obtained by our temperature - exchange simulation procedure . we then define the so - called @ xmath56 and @ xmath57 parameters for the chirality , as described in the article @ xcite , such as , @ xmath58 - [ \ langle q _ { \ chi } ^ 4 \ rangle ] } { [ \ langle q _ { \ chi } ^ 4 \ rangle ] ^ 2 - [ \ langle q _ { \ chi } ^ 2 \ rangle ] } , \ ] ] @ xmath59 - [ \ langle q _ { \ chi } ^ 2 \ rangle ] } { [ \ langle q _ { \ chi } ^ 2 \ rangle ] ^ 2 } \ \ . \ ] ] these @ xmath60 and @ xmath61 parameters are closely related to the sample - to - sample value of the chiral ##ity parameter . the @ xmath57 parameter is considered to be an example of the non - non - averagingness ofthe order parameter , _ i . e . _ , always vanish in the phase where the order parameter is self - averaging and takes a nonzero value in @ xcite . in contrast , the @ xmath56 parameter could take a nonzero value even in the self - averaging ordered state , and therefore , could not be used as an accurate indicator of the non - self - averagingness @ xcite . however , since in the latter case it vanish in the low - order phase and takes a nonzero value in the ordered state , it can also be used as an indicator of the phase transition . as in the case of the chirality , it is possible to define an overlap parameter for the highest spin . in this case , the overlap can also be defined as the _ _ _ of @ xmath62 and the @ xmath31 and @ xmath63 respectively ( @ xmath31 , @ xmath63 = @ xmath64 ) of the highest order , @ xmath65 where @ xmath66 and @ xmath67 are the @ xmath30 - the heisneberg spin ofthe numbers 1 and 2 , respectively . in terms of these two numbers , the ` ` longitudinal ' ' ( perpendicular to the applied field ) and ` ` transverse ' ' ( transverse to the applied field ) second order ratios can be given by @ xmath68 , \ \ \ \ q _ { \ rm l } ^ 2 = q _ { zz } ^ 2 , \ ] ] @ xmath69 , \ \ \ \ q _ { \ rm l } ^ 2 = \ int _ { \ mu , \ nu = 1 , \ } q _ { \ mu \ right } ^ 2 \ \ . \ ] ] the corresponding transverse and transverse order ratios are given by @ xmath70 } { [ \ langle q _ { \ rm t } ^ 2 \ rangle ] ^ 2 } \ right ) , \ begin { binl } \ ] ] @ xmath71 } { [ \ langle q _ { \ rm t } ^ 2 \ rangle ] ^ 2 } \ right ) \ \ . \ ] ] here , @ xmath72 and @ xmath73 are defined so that , in the upper limit , they are in thefirst - order , and is defined in the nondegenrate quantum state . since an independent component like @ xmath74 does not exist in classical fields , we can also define the ` ` ' distribution function ' ' for the transverse component @ xcite , @ xmath75 } { [ \ langle ( q _ { \ rm l } - \ langle q _ { \ rm l } \ rangle ) ^ { \ rangle ] ^ 2 } \ right ) . \ ] ] in applied fields , @ xmath76 can also behave differently from @ xmath72 . the spin - overlap distribution function is also defined on the phase space . in the following , we pay special attention to the transverse ( @ xmath77 ) component . the corresponding transverse component is defined @ xmath78 with and . for the proof of this , we define e . @ xcite , and consider the corresponding transverse - spin - overlap distribution function @ xmath79 defined in terms of the tensor overlap @ xmath80 which is the product of the tensor overlap @ xmath62 and , @ xmath81 the distribution function @ xmath79 is defined with respect to@ xmath82 . in the low - energy limit , the @ xmath62 ( @ xmath83 ) is said to be self - symmetric around @ xmath84 in the @ xmath85 limit , and so around @ xmath80 . let us assume , that there exists a pseudo _ x _ - invariant ##y , described by a nonzero @ xmath86 , and with a nonzero pseudo _ x rotation around @ xmath87 . consider the fact that @ xmath80 invariant nontrivially - describes @ xmath88 rotation about the @ xmath18 - axis of the two sides , which explains the symmetry due to the strong magnetic coupling in the absence of magnetic fields , even though self - symmetry is nontrivial ##ly to @ xmath79 rather than to @ xmath89 . in the @ xmath85 limit , the self - overlap weight of @ xmath79 should be given by @ xmath90 the proof of ref . ( [ ptform ] ) has been published in ref . @ xcite in the form of the _ x##y _ sg . if the transverse ##ly ordered state is rsb , the associated nontrivial amplitude would be equal to the contribution provided by fig . ( [ ptform ] ) . in this case , the important point here is that , as long as the ordered state has a constant transverse sg lro , the associated amplitude should be constant @ xmath79 ##2 @ xmath91 as shown in fig . [ xylro ] , due to the nature of the rsb . this section is the second section of the original paper . here , we present our experimental results for the quantity @ xmath22 _ _ for magnetic fields . here , we deal with the chirality - dependent properties . in fig . [ fig - locx ] , we show the shape and size properties of the local field ##ization of the chirality for magnetic fields . as can also be seen from fig . [ fig - locx ] ( 2 ) , conversion of @ xmath92 to @ xmath93 gives non - linear amplitude as long as the local field coupling is not too strong , _ i . e . _ , @ xmath94 , _ .295 , 0 . 308 , 0 . 313 , 0 . 260 , and 0 . 265 for @ xmath95 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 , 2 . 0 , 3 . 0 , and 4 . 0 , respectively . this implies that the spin configuration of the random spin system is completely noncoplanar , which suggests that the system has the nontrivial chirality . however , a close examination of the spin configuration shows that the noncoplanar spin configuration realized at low temperature in zero and weak fields is very close to the random one . therefore , for all spin configurations of the ##s , @ xmath36 should have the value @ xmath96 @ xcite , a value much lower than the corresponding @ xmath97 value . this also implies that the noncoplanar spin configuration in zero and weak fields is close to the random one . therefore , our experimental results show that , in the strong field case , @ xmath98 _ _ _ _ with a strong field at low temperature . this observation could be confirmed if we assumed that the 3 - dimensional noncoplanar spin configuration is close to the coplana##r . , and that the application of the magnetic field to the two flat spin structures leads to ` ` align to ' ' the structure from this configuration with in the direction parallel to the magnetic field . this gives rise to ` ` ` two - dimensional ' ' ' spin structure with structure @ xmath36 . of course , when the field is not applied , @ xmath98 size dependence , because not all forces cause spins to align with the field . in fig . [ fig - locx ] ( c ) , we show the size dependence of @ xmath99 for the field @ xmath24 . as can be seen from the figure , there is very little size dependence of @ xmath99 . for @ xmath95 , 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 , and only @ xmath26 for the field 0 . for the case of @ xmath24 , the size dependence of @ xmath36 is shown in fig . ( c ) . ] in fig . [ fig - qx2 ] , we show the chiral - like ##y . @ xmath100 for the fields ( a ) @ xmath24 , and ( b ) @ xmath10##1 . for both fields , @ xmath100 peaks more strongly at higher temperatures . , and ( b ) @ xmath101 . ] in fig . [ x - gx ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the relative strength of the chirality @ xmath102 for the fields ( a ) @ xmath24 , and ( b ) @ xmath101 . as can be seen from the figure , @ xmath103 has a negative dip which , with the @ xmath27 , tends to decrease and converge toward higher temperatures . however , @ xmath103 of and @ xmath27 peaks at a temperature well below the peak at @ xmath104 _ _ _ _ of @ xmath105 _ , thus peaks at temperatures lower than @ xmath104 . the bonding state of @ xmath103 is similar to the one observed in the molecule @ xcite . as described in fig . @ xcite , the presence of the negative dip and the crossover point at @ xmath106 is strongly indicative of the presence of a low - temperature transition where @ xmath107 and a _ __ , of the @ xmath108 etc . , and ( - ) @ xmath101 . ] in fig . [ fig - 1 ] , we plot the high - charge values @ xmath109 versus @ xmath110 for the fields @ xmath24 and @ xmath101 . for both fields , the lines converge on a straight line as shown . the linear scaling to @ xmath111 , as shown by the dashed curve in the figure , yields our best estimate of the effective chiral - glass transition temperature , _ i . e . _ , @ xmath112 for @ xmath24 and @ xmath113 for @ xmath101 . more precisely , @ xmath109 should coincide with @ xmath114 where @ xmath115 is the chiral - glass transition - temperature parameter . as shown above , our estimate of @ xmath116 is equal to , , , or less than the previous estimate shown above . similarly , scaling with respect to @ xmath117 , shown by the dashed curve in fig . [ fig - 2 ] , yields @ xmat##h118 for @ xmath24 and @ xmath112 for @ xmath101 . as shall be noted above , we compare the interesting properties of @ xmath105 , _ e . g . _ , the very negative dip and the crossing occurring in @ xmath106 , to the very one - step - scale free rsb of the chiral - scale ##y ##1 . for comparison with the one - step rsb , _ e . g . _ , the scale - free ordered - state potts model , the phase transition is assumed to occur as shown in fig . [ fig - binx ] , with the negative dip and the crossing occurring on the right of @ xcite . however , such a transition is not identical to the behavior we have observed in fig . [ fig - gx ] . the energy dependence of @ xmath119 can be observed from the ordered state of the system . here , we can show the chirality autocorrelation of @ xmath120 described in fig . ( [ cxt ] ) . to illustrate the energy size dependence , we show in fig . [ fig - x ] the size dependence of @ xmath12##0 for the data @ xmath101 in the log - log form , and for ( a ) @ xmath121 , and for ( b ) @ xmath28 . as shown in the figure , @ xmath120 has either a downward curvature characteristic of the free phase , or an upward curvature characteristic of the long - period free phase , depending on whether the curvature is higher or lower than @ xmath122 . also at @ xmath122 , the exponential decay corresponding to the power - law decay is observed . finally , our data shows that the chiral - type decay takes place at @ xmath123 , in accordance with our previous prediction based on @ xmath105 . from the observation of the decay of @ xmath124 , the value @ xmath125 of the power - law decay of @ xmath126 is assumed to be @ xmath127 . we note that both our data of @ xmath121 shown in fig . [ fig - auto ] ( a ) and of @ xmath28 shown in fig . [ fig - auto ] ( b ) are exactly the same data of @ xmath11##9 and of @ xmath125 , even though the @ xmath121 and @ xmath28 values themselves do not significantly differ , except for @ xmath128 . thus , our observation that @ xmath120 has an intermediate order of @ xmath119 , corresponding to the nonzero order corresponding to the higher chiral order of @ xmath129 , implies that the chiral - like ##y ##2 is ` ` stable ' ' with a nonzero long - range ea . the same formula applied to the @ xmath24 data for @ xmath130 and @ xmath131 . for the values ( a ) @ xmath121 , and ( b ) @ xmath28 . they correspond to @ xmath132 , 0 . 18 , 0 . 19 , 0 . 20 , 0 . 21 , 0 . 22 , 0 . 23 , 0 . 24 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 26 from top to bottom . [ results of power - law calculations are shown in the figure ( a ) and ( b ) for @ xmath133 . ] in fig . [ 1 - pqxt016 ] , we show the temperature##ral - - - - @ xmath134 for the energy @ xmath101 at a distance @ xmath135 , and above @ xmath136 . in addition to the ` ` ` side - peaks ' ' corresponding to the second peak at @ xmath137 , which grow and decrease with increasing @ xmath27 , there is a ` ` central peak ' ' at @ xmath138 for distance @ xmath27 , which also grows and decreases with increasing @ xmath27 . the structure of the model @ xmath139 is very much similar to the model described in ref . @ xcite for zero field , but also very different from those described in the other ising - type models such as the # ##h model @ xcite and the zero - field sk model @ xcite . as described in ref . @ xcite in terms of zero field , the # ##ities of @ xmath139 are predicted to be similar to the _ _ - - _ - _ rsb . the presence of a slight increase in the branching of @ xmath102 and the presence of the same rate of decay of @ xmath105 and @ x##math140 is also consistent with the existence of such a high - dimensional - scale rsb @ xcite . we show that our estimate of @ xmath141 is also consistent with the occurrence of a small transition in [ @ xmath142 in relation to the s - wave peak . at the temperature @ xmath135 , well above the chiral - scale transition temperature , @ xmath143 . ] in fig . [ 2 - gax ] , we show the the shape and energy distribution of the @ xmath144 and @ xmath145 data for the field @ xmath101 . although the values of the data are at large scale , the transition occurs at temperatures much lower than @ xmath112 in most cases , and the transition states of larger energies ( _ e . g . _ @ xmath26 and @ xmath146 _ etc _ ) will migrate towards @ xmath112 for example @ xmath27 . the results are consistent with our estimate of @ xmath119 , based on the crystal structure and the autocorrelation . and @ xmath57 because of the chirality for the field @ x##math101 . ] in this section , we present our experimental results of the spin - dependent fields . in fig . [ fig - gsl ] and [ fig - gst ] , we present the magnetic flux ratios for the longitudinal and transverse components , respectively , for the fields ( a ) @ xmath24 , and ( b ) @ xmath101 . for the fields , the _ to _ spin ratio @ xmath72 decreases monotonically toward zero with increasing @ xmath27 at the temperature above : see fig . [ fig - gsl ] . this figure illustrates the fact that the longitudinal component of the spin has a constant change caused by the field at a given temperature . in contrast , the flux ratio of the transverse component of the spin @ xmath73 decreases toward zero with increasing @ xmath27 , without either constant decrease nor constant rise : see fig . [ fig - gst ] . this implies that the longitudinal component of spin is present , namely @ xmath119 . , and ( c ) @ xmath101 . for the spin @ xmath101 , the spin is shown in the fig . ] , and (b ) @ xmath101 . ] in fig .

( strictly speaking , the values of @ xmath26 and @ xmath146 for @ xmath24 , show a zero - ness effect for @ xmath148 , but this is unrelated to these two values . ) , and ( c ) @ xmath101 . ] in fig . [ fig - qsxy ] , we show the corresponding longitudinal - spin - overlap value of @ xmath149 for the calculated @ xmath24 spin transition temperature @ xmath150 , just like the chiral - spin transition temperature @ xmath151 . the value @ xmath149 has a ` ` ` ` ' ' , a nonzero value of @ xmath##80 , 80 as shown in the figure , this ` ` ' ' ' becomes stronger with temperatures @ xmath27 , _ _ and the similar _ _ . the suppression of the shoulder implies that the chiral - glass ordered state does not accompany the standard transverse sg order , at least up to temperatures @ xmath152 . for @ xmath101 , we have also observed a suppression of the shoulder up to temperatures as low as temperatures @ xmath152 . therefore , we conclude that the chiral - glass ordered state does not accompany the standard transverse sg order , at least just below the chiral - glass transition point . generally speaking , the observed suppression of the shoulder is therefore not consistent with the kosterlitz - thouless ( k ) - type critical sg ordered state . however , we note that such a critical sg ordered state occurring at @ xmath153 is clearly indicated by our image of @ xmath73 shown in fig . [ 2 - gst ] . for the example @ xmath24 is the temperature @ xmath150 , just below the chiral - glass transition point @ xmath118 . a different image of the second part , shown in the imageshown in the right corner , as shown in the figure . ] in this example , we compare static and dynamic ##al ##bedo models with the chiral - glass model . the comparison above is only for the two - parameter models , @ xmath24 and @ xmath101 , where no numerical calculations have been performed . in the example above , we define @ xmath136 to be @ xmath154 ( @ xmath24 ) and @ xmath155 ( @ xmath101 ) , as shown above . we estimate for the chiral - glass model of @ xmath156 from the negative slope of the log - log dependence of the original chiral - glass model @ xmath47 versus the positive slope @ xmath157 . an example is given in ref .

[ x - getexponents ] ( 2 ) , where we plot @ xmath160 and @ xmath162 versus @ xmath27 on a log - log line . as can be seen from the figure , the lines converge to a log line as well . from the slope @ xmath163 , the solution @ xmath159 is assumed to be @ xmath164 . the values of the static order , @ xmath165 , @ xmath166 , and @ xmath167 , can be calculated from @ xmath168 and @ xmath169 , using the same temperature and hyperscaling conditions for @ xmath170 , @ xmath171 and @ xmath172 . versus the static order for the solution @ xmath101 . the slope @ xmath173 is the chiral - glass order for @ xmath174. the critical temperature is estimated , to be @ xmath155 . ( 2 ) log - log correlation of @ xmath160 versus @ xmath27 for the fields @ xmath101 and @ xmath175 . the estimate @ xmath176 assumes the chiral - glass zero - point - temperature parameter to be @ xmath177 . ] the temperature parameter @ xmath178 can be calculated from the field @ xmath179 , via the equation @ xmath180 . from our previous estimate , @ xmath127 , we get @ xmath181 . the above equation is used for the estimate of @ xmath24 . we also get @ xmath182 , @ xmath183 , @ xmath184 . these estimates for @ xmath24 are the limits with the above equation for @ xmath101 . our estimates of the chiral - glass parameter are reported in table [ x - criticalexp ] , and are compared with the corresponding finite - field estimates reported in table . @ xcite . the finite - field estimates turn out to bewe agree with the corresonding zero - field model , assuming that the zero - field and high - energy chiral - glass transitions occur in a single quantum process . we conclude that this result is consistent with the chirality prediction of g . @ xcite . in the [ 3 - criticalexp ] , we will use the sg values of the 3d ising ea sg @ xcite compared with the sg values ( with zero field ) of the n - type si model agmn @ xcite . the sg values of the chiral - glass model differ significantly from those of the 3d ising ea sg . in contrast , the chiral - glass values are similar to the si sg values for the si agmn , lending further support to the non - chirality self - recoupling hypothesis . for a further check of our knowledge of sg and @ xmath119 values , we have also done the following : we use the @ xmath185 values given by , @ xmath186 , and compare the # ##s of @ xmath105 , @ xmath109 , to @ xmath187( see the bottom right of fig . [ fig - c ] ) . as expected , such an analysis yields the corresponding chiral - glass transition values , @ xmath151 ( @ xmath24 ) and @ xmath188 ( @ xmath101 ) . these values of @ xmath119 agree with those derived from the chiral autocorrelation and used in our theoretical calculations . this means that our understanding of temperature and @ xmath119 is fairly consistent . in fig . [ fig - scalingc ] , we find the the best three - dimensional scaling value for the chiral - glass transition is @ xmath48 based on the equation , @ xmath189 where the @ xmath119 , @ xmath159 and @ xmath167 values are equal to the scaled values given previously . as can be seen from the figure , no scaling errors are observed , at least for larger structures . at the same time , however , one assumes that there is no significant deviation from the mean for smaller structures , as in the case of @ xmath24 . assuming significant deviation only for larger structures , the existence of a significant deviation- , vs . , and ( 1 ) @ xmath101 . ] the existence of such large sample - size variations has also been demonstrated from the properties of the chiral - # ##ting function @ xmath190 and of the chiral correlation function @ xmath105 . in a complete - scaling analysis , @ xmath134 itself should scale from @ xmath124 with probability 1 to @ xmath159 . however , given the range of values available for @ xmath191 , we should not expect such a complete scaling of @ xmath134 . such a lack of complete scaling of @ xmath134 gives rise to several sources of uncertainty in our estimates of @ xmath159 : indeed , if one tries to scale the width of the sample such as the sample size @ xmath48 , it yields @ xmath192 as shown above ( see ref . [ 1 - getexponents ] ( 2 ) ) , but if one tries to scale the width of @ xmath190 , it only yields @ xmath193 , which is much smaller than the standard deviation , but still well below the standard .3 . lack of a crystal structure of @ xmath134 is also reflected in the structure of @ xmath102 , which does not show a spin crossing at @ xmath194 in the range of temperatures shown : however , as shown in fig . [ g - gx ] , the transition is on the right side of @ xmath105 , above @ xmath124 , and the spin will appear to move back toward @ xmath119 as @ xmath27 ##4 . for the second sg transition , from the structure of the spin molecule and of the total spin - spin - spin correlation parameter , we have already obtained a strong statistical indication that the chiral - spin transition does not follow the transverse sg transition , at temperatures well above @ xmath119 . in other words , the spin crossing of the molecule occurs only at finite temperatures , or else , if it occurs at a finite temperature , the total transverse sg transition at @ xmath195 is much larger than @ xmath119 , or , above @ xmath152 . we warn the reader here that , as long as one looks at the sg transition and the spin correlation parameter , a very simple calculation canimpossible to actually do such a thing . as an example , we show in fig . [ scalesph01 ] the following large - scale 2d plot of the magnetic field ##s : @ xmath196 for @ xmath24 ; ( a ) the one assuming @ xmath197 , and ( b ) the one assuming @ xmath198 . these plots are shown in fig . [ scalesph05 ] for the case @ xmath101 with term @ xmath197 , and ( a ) @ xmath197 and ( b ) @ xmath199 . at first glance , these plots are perfectly similar without any differences if the terms are chosen in reverse order . thus , we can ask if the spin structure will match up with the chirality , with the corresponding terms ( @ xmath200 ) and @ xmath201 : in fig . [ scalesph01 ] . we find , however , this unlikely to be the case due to the following assumptions . , assuming ( a ) @ xmath202 , and ( b ) @ xmath198 . ] , and ( a ) @ xmath202 , and (b ) @ xmath199 . ] first , as stated above , the observed chirality and transverse - spin distribution coincide with our understanding of the energy distribution @ xmath73 and the corresponding transverse - spin - glass distribution at @ xmath79 . second , a detailed analysis of the data shows that , above and below @ xmath124 , there is an inverse correlation between the values of the transverse spin @ xmath86 and of the chirality @ xmath100 . in fig . [ fig - q2log ] , we see on a log - log basis the energy distribution of the two order parameters , @ xmath86 and @ xmath100 , at the positions above and below @ xmath119 . as can be seen from fig . [ fig - q2log ] ( a ) , at @ xmath119 the chiral - spin order parameter has a large upbending for the @ xmath27 , such that @ xmath100 tends to a nonzero value in the upper limit . in direct contrast to this , such an upbending is not observed for the transverse spin ##e ##q @ xmath##86 : indeed , @ xmath86 exhibits a nonlinear downbedning behavior at @ xmath124 , which gradually reduces to the expected linear behavior at higher temperatures . the nonlinear behavior of @ xmath86 is consistent with both , ( a ) the growth of the kosterlitz - thouless ( s ) - like transition at a finite temperature at which the spin - like transitions occur _ with a power - law expansion , ( b ) the exponential growth of the transverse sg transition at @ xmath203 which reaches the critical temperature at @ xmath121 at a relatively nonzero temperature relative to @ xmath119 . in the former case , there should be a well - defined transverse sg transition simultaneously with the critical temperature transition _ , whereas , in the latter case , there should only be a transverse sg transition at a finite temperature . strictly speaking , it is difficult to distinguish between the first two cases _ from the @ xmath86 model of critical temperature with @ xmath204 . however , we think we should at least consider _ the possibility that the spin - like transverse sg transition occurs _ simultaneously _ with the chiral - like transition at @ xmat##h124 , followed by the critical sg ordered state , @ xmath153 . first , we note that such a critical sg ordered state is not supported by our estimate of @ xmath73 of fig . [ c - gst ] . second , the transverse _ spin _ - glass correlation - length term appears in fig . [ scalesph01 ] ( b ) and [ scalesph05 ] ( c ) . the transverse sg and chiral order , @ xmath205 , is different from from the two - dimensional - resolution ( lcd ) value , @ xmath206 , commonly used for such a k - like transition . in so far as one assumes that the transverse sg order occurs simultaneously with the chiral - glass order , our best estimate of the transverse sg correlation - length term is not consistent with the lcd value @ xmath207 , which is very difficult to reconcile with the k - like transition observed at @ xmath86 and @ xmath208 . , the two points above and below @ xmath136 : ( a ) the transverse - spin - glass order is @ xmath86 , and ( b ) the chiral - glass order= @ xmath48 . the chiral - glass transition observed at this point is @ xmath118 . to show the departure from the norm , lines connecting the two long - scale fields @ xmath26 and @ xmath209 are drawn at this point . ] in fact , it was stated in c . @ xcite for the case of the _ spin _ model , the chirality definition has the root form : the spin and chiral ##ity are not involved in the sg order parameter of the _ wave function . this would not be related to the space and time scale of the transition . however , one should be aware of the fact that the spin - chirality transition is a _ long - scale _ phenomenon : at this point , the chirality is completely independent of the temperature of this definition , except in the limit ( @ xmath210 ) as seen from the classical power law . however , the behavior of the spin - glass transition states , including the sg order parameter which is a spatial parameter , may also affect the quantum information associated with the _ chirality _ _ i . e . _ , the behavior of the chiral - glass transition , up to the degreeand time scale . in such a case , the ( and only ) known ` ` spin - scale relations ' ' , would be @ xmath211 and @ xmath212 , the latter being derived from the time - scale relation , @ xmath213 . note that these values are not significantly different from the values we obtained from the finite - element model values of fig . [ scalesph01 ] ( b ) and [ scalesph05 ] ( c ) , given the simultaneous peaks of the spin and chiral sectors . however , we note here that such a simultaneous peak in the spin sector is only a short - term effect , not a real t ##ity . after using our estimates of the @ xmath119 values for magnetic field components , as calculated from the ratios of @ xmath109 to @ xmath187 , we obtain a phase diagram of the spin vs . magnetic field sector . the diagram is shown in fig . [ 1 - 1 ] . we have shown using the magnetic - scale values of fig . @ xcite , @ xmath214 . the values are derived directly from the ratio of the two @ xmath119 values via the@ xmath110 and @ xmath215 respectively . as is evident from fig . [ fig - phase ] , the chiral - glass model is very robust against magnetic fields . this is also evident from fig . [ fig - phase ] ( 2 ) where we have the magnetic phase diagram on a scale where both the magnetic and the magnetic - electric field have a length scale . however , @ xmath216 is very much different from the electric - phase diagram even on a scale as small as 10 % of @ xmath217 . at high temperatures , the chiral - glass phase axis is almost identical to the @ xmath218 axis , consistent with the coefficient etc . ( [ eqn : phaseline ] ) obtained from the chirality experiment . our model is even more robust with the values @ xmath14 and etc . ( [ eqn : phaseline ] ) , almost identical in that @ xmath216 exactly _ fits _ in with @ xmath17 , but it is difficult to reach a definite agreement due to the uncertainty of our measurements of @ xmath216 . if one concludes from our previous experiment that the presence of a strong magnetic field isto calculate the mean squared error of the chirality , @ xmath36 , from the zero - field value , so the predicted value of @ xmath216 is far too high . - @ xmath219 the existence of the 3d @ xmath22 ##9 is supported by the mc results . note that the - axes of the @ xmath17 and of the @ xmath219 state are not perpendicular in fig . ( a ) , but they are shown to be identical in fig . ( b ) . ] in addition , we have performed large - scale quantum monte carlo simulations of the 3d @ 22 state in different magnetic fields . we have shown that our mc results are consistent with the chirality predictions of etc . @ xcite . among other things , we have observed the existence of a zero - field chiral - glass transition in magnetic fields , almost of the same magnitude as the zero - field transition . the chiral - glass transition state exhibits the one - dimensional - scale of rsb , but it does not exhibit the atomic - scale , at temperatures up to and including @ xmath152 . the existence of zero - field chiral - glass transition appears to becompare with that of the low - spin model , which , however , significantly differs from the behavior of the young - ising model . . however , the chiral - glass values turn out to be similar to the corresponding values obtained for other such models as agmn . we have also constructed a magnetic phase diagram of the 3d - group model . the chiral - glass transition line in the @ xmath17 - @ xmath219 model was found to be nearly parallel to the z axis , due to very strong interactions of the @ xmath220 , suggesting that the chiral - glass transition line is very stable against magnetic fields . this rather surprising result probably comes from the fact that the magnetic field contributes to the hamiltonian change from the spin , _ , to the chirality _ , and the local interaction between the spin and the chirality is very weak . the chiral - glass transition line takes the form of the gabay - taylor model of the mean - field theory , with the magnetic properties being very different . . for example , we will have the first experimental example of the magnetic phase diagram of the 3d @ xmath22 ##9 ##d model . the way how we arethe values of magnetic field and temperature for all the experimental data are given in the table . ] it is not always possible to make a direct comparison of our theory with reality . this is possible because the horizontal magnetic field , which only exists in real sg materials , is not present in our present result . moreover , in real sg materials , spins do not actually rotate on the cubic - cubic axis , nor interact with other spins via the nearest - neighbor @ xmath22 _ , _ etc _ . in view of these theoretical difficulties , it may be useful to try to compare our theoretical sg phase diagram with the experimental data for diamond - like liquid crystals . chirality theory suggests that , in the high - field region where the temperature is low compared to the applied magnetic field , the sg transition line should simply be replaced by the chiral - like transition line of the more real sg . if so , our theoretical result is that the sg transition line of real diamond - like materials should be approximately constant against the temperature and in the low - field region where the applied field dominates the horizontal magnetic component . in fig . [ phasedg ] ( 1 ) , we havethe corresponding @ xmath17 - @ xmath219 phase line of the model aufe from vs . @ xcite . in the same paper , we also present our present result of the chiral - glass phase line , expressed in the following way . we attempt to model the quantum system using the classical quantum hamiltonian with an effective temperature @ xmath20 and an effective magnetic field @ xmath17 , which is expressed in terms of and . ( [ eqn : phaseline ] ) . first , we estimate the zero - point transition temperature of the non _ classical _ system to be @ xmath221k , by setting the high - energy gt - glass transition temperature of aufe to @ xmath218 . then , with the help of our previous result of @ xmath222 , we estimate the corresponding @ xmath20 temperature to about 50k . the field intensity @ xmath17 is then transformed into the field intensity of the experimental model @ xmath223 by the equation @ xmath224 , @ xmath225 is the quantum coupling constant : in terms of aufe , @ xmath225 is the##ly line to be @ xmath226 , where @ xmath227 is the coupling constant @ xcite . thus , our fig . [ 0 - 1 ] shows that the sg phase diagram of aufe will be approximately identical up to the point as far as @ xmath228 [ 1 ] . of course , given the differences in the parameters between the experimental model and the aufe , we could not expect a completely positive result here . nevertheless , the mean - field effects of aufe and other s - type field theories would be useful to study the sg phase diagram in the high - field regime . in order to make a comparison with the sg phase diagram in the low - field regime , it is necessary to consider the presence of random magnetic moments corresponding to the experimental model . thus , in the high - field regime where the applied field strength is equal to or greater than the random magnetic moments , the chirality model assumes the existence of a # ##ity line which describes the properties of the high - end of the mean - field domain @ xcite . in order to make further observations into the normal - glass and the chiral - glass phenomena in magnetic materials and to studygiven the accuracy of the chirality prediction , it would be possible to make accurate three - dimensional predictions for the _ _ _ spin _ glasses model . the numerial simulation was performed on the hitachi sr8000 of the solar system , issp , university of tokyo . the authors have referred to dr . t . hukushima , dr . t . yoshino and dr . h . t . suzuki for further information . for applications of spin glasses , see _ e . g . , _ ( a ) j . wang and a . p . young : rev . * 53 * ( 1986 ) 801 ; ( b ) j . h . wang and j . h . young : _ spin glasses _ cambridge university press ( 1991 ) ; ( c ) a . a . mydosh : _ spin glasses _ taylor & francis ( 1993 ) ; ( d ) a . p . young ( _ _ . _ ) : _ spin glasses and quantum fields _ world scientific , singapore ( 1997 ) . for the # ##al ##bedo , see , for example , ( a ) k . kawashima and a . p . young : phys . rev . * * 53 * ( 1996 ) , .##4 ; ( b ) g . marinari , g . parisi and j . j . ruiz - lorenzo : phys . b . b * 60 * ( 1998 ) 14852 ; ( c ) j . j . schmidt and j . janke : phys . * 60 * ( 1998 ) 4771 ; ( d ) g . palassini and m . caracciolo : phys . * 80 * ( 1999 ) 5128 ; ( e ) j . m . ballesteros , j . cruz , j . m . fernndez , m . martn - garcia , j . j . ruiz - lorenzo , m . tarancn , m . tllez , j . m . ulod and m . ungil : phys . b * 57 * ( 2000 ) 14237 . for , for example , ( a ) m . de cortenary , h . bouchiat , m . hurdequite and m . fert : j . physics * 47 * ( 1986 ) 2659 ; ( b ) h . bouchiat : j . physics * 47 * ( 1986 ) 265 ; ( c ) a . m . lvy and a . m . ogielski : phys. rev . lett . * * * ( 1986 ) 3288 .
