in the past few years , there have been several attempts to accurately model the motion of polymer chains with brownian motion @ xcite , which has most recently been used as a basis for studying molecular dynamics @ xcite . one of the earliest and simplest models was published as the spring model @ xcite , which is a bead - spring model @ xcite , where the dna molecule is held on a mesoscopic scale with beads attached to springs . the main forces acting on beads are bending forces from other beads , as well as random forces . mechanical forces on beads and molecular dynamics effects are ignored in the model in terms of accuracy and computational speed , but the model manages to deal with all types of polymer chains from beads @ xcite . other models exist , for example the zimm model . bending forces @ xcite , beads , and electric fields can be used to model a dna molecule and give a measure of chain length @ xcite , see , for example , the article @ xcite and experiment @ xcite on this subject . all of the above models model the molecule on only a small scale . in some cases , the model is used on a very small scaleof a biological system . " it is also possible to create a hybrid model which is energy efficient in the domain of interest , and couple this with a model which is more energy efficient in the domain of the corresponding domain @ xcite . an important mechanism for hybrid ##ization of dna molecules is binding of a protein to the dna molecule , which we describe in this paper . the model which we have created is protein dynamics for a molecule of dna , but with a small dna particle to occupy the binding site . as the molecule binds the protein , we increase the concentration of the surrounding dna particles to increase accuracy of our simulations , whilst making them more accurate . in this paper we selected the hybrid model for analysis due to its relative simplicity and low computational cost . such a model is applicable to complex protein dynamics when we have very low resolution , when hydrodynamic forces are low and persistence time is much less than the average distance between the domain @ xcite . the model is more accurate when we have protein dynamics with high energy resolutions . in the cell nucleus , genetic information is stored in terms of long and short dna strands , which are organized into regions . these dna fibres are organized into regions according to their length .target genes can be increased or reduced based upon this process @ xcite . dna folding fills space taken up in the cell by transcription @ xcite , and can be used when needed by the cell for certain stages of the cell cycle or to regulate gene expression . the folding of dna occurs on several scales . at the simplest scale , dna is wrapped around target dna to form the nucleosome structure @ xcite . this in turn is assembled into a dna molecule which is assembled into various higher order structures until we reach the level of the dna genome @ xcite . the finer details of how the nucleosome folding occurs in the dna fibre and how these are then packaged into higher - order structures are still a matter of ongoing debate , with long - term views of mesoscopic dna folding becoming less common in favor of more complex structures @ vivo @ xcite . at the most basic stages of folding , large amounts of space are not available for specific steps such as folding @ xcite . a simple solution to how this is done in the cell is to position target dna molecules on the surface of the dna when it is folded @ xcite , so that the machinery can recognize target dna without having toand into these close - packed clusters . this problem is not covered by the multiscale model of protein binding used in this paper . however , if one combines the further development of the rouse model , with a more accurate model done on a specific region of protein close to the binding site , then such a hybrid model can be used to study the effects of structural changes on binding at high - resolution spatial and temporal scales . when using this multiscale model , it is important to consider the benefits from using the more accurate model in the cluster model and how the accuracy of the model depends on these parameters . these are the main issues raised in this paper . the content of the paper is summarized as follows . in section [ secmrbs ] , we introduce a multi - resolution bea - spring model which extends the rouse model . we also introduce a discretized version of this model which involves the integration of different timesteps in different time scales . in section [ section3 ] , we study the coupling constant of the multi - resolution bea - spring model . we combine the above results with values for the coupling constant and the end - to - end coupling . we also study the optimal choice of timesteps for the integration of the couplingand base our results on the results of the computer simulations . our main research topic is presented in section [ section4 ] where we present and analyze the dna dynamics model . we propose a method to determine the parameters of dna dynamics on - the - fly using the metropolis - newton method . in section [ secdiscussion ] , we conclude our paper by discussing possible extensions of the linear multiscale model ( possibly to more complex models of dna dynamics ) and other multiscale approaches described in the paper . we extend the simple linear bea - spring model of @ xcite to include polymers of variable size and structures with variable rate growth . in section [ defmrbs ] , we derive the kinetic equation for this polymer using a system of partial differential equations ( sdes ) . we will then present a discretized version of this equation in section [ algoneiter ] , which will be presented in sections [ section3 ] and [ section4 ] where we use the multi - resolution bea - spring model to present and analyze multiscale models for dna dynamics . [ defmrbs ] let @ xmath0 be a positive integer . a multi - resolution bea - spring polymer of @ @ xmat##h1 consists of a series of @ xmath1 springs of length @ xmath2 , for @ xmath3 , followed by @ xmath4 , which are described by their spring constant @ xmath5 , for @ xmath6 . the [ @ xmath7 $ ] of springs are according to the law of sdes ( for @ xmath3 ) @ xmath8 where @ xmath9 is the surface friction coefficient of the @ xmath10 - shaped spring . by these equations , @ xmath11 is the bulk process , @ xmath12 $ ] is the boundary temperature , @ xmath13 is the pressure , @ xmath14 the side - effect and we assume that the spring constant @ xmath5 can be equivalently expressed in terms of the corresponding stokes equation @ xmath15 and @ xmath16 we assume that the diameter of the spring ( for @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 ) is also given by equation @ xmath19 and by equation @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 _ [ figmrbeadspring ] ] . the[ figmrbeadspring ] , we will use the multi - dimensional polymer - based model for @ xmath22 . the interaction between the @ xmath23 - th and the @ xmath24 - th beads is studied with the highest accuracy when using both polymers and materials with shorter chain lengths ( or equivalently with smaller spring sizes ) . the values of the parameters of the [ defmrbs ] are chosen so that we get the original rouse model @ xcite if we consider @ xmath25 and @ xmath26 . then , ( [ sdedef ] ) reduces to @ xmath27 where @ xmath28 , @ xmath29 and we can use @ xmath20 and @ xmath30 as parameters for these conditions . in the recent research paper @ xcite , the rouse model ( [ sderouse ] ) is equivalently defined as @ xmath31 where the random forces @ xmath32 makes on the beads from brownian motion are described by the equation @ xcite @ xmath33 where @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 . for the remainder of this paper , we will usethe sde algorithm is described below ( [ sderouse ] ) , because we can also use other methods for solving fluid dynamics models . the first discretization of ( [ sderouse ] ) is given by the ito - maruyama algorithm @ xcite , which takes the finite timestep @ xmath36 and replaces the value of @ xmath37 of the @ xmath10 - th term , @ xmath38 , and discretised by @ xmath39 and @ xmath40 for @ xmath41 , where @ xmath42 is simply a random variable with zero mean and zero variance ( i . e . @ xmath43 ) for @ xmath44 . in order to discretize the multi - dimensional string - packing problem , we look for finite timesteps . [ defvartimestep ] let @ xmath45 and time @ xmath46 , @ xmath47 be positive integers such that @ xmath48 and @ xmath49 for @ xmath50 . let us assume that at least one of the values of @ xmath46 is equal to 0 . we set @ xmath51for @ xmath6 and we have @ xmath52 the timestep associated with the @ xmath10 - th spring . algorithm [ defvartimestep ] shows that the timesteps must be integer multiple of the corresponding timestep @ xmath36 . the timesteps associated with the different springs are not independent of each other . the time series of the multi - phase two - spring model is updated at integer multiple of @ xmath36 . the structure of the model is described in algorithm [ algoneiter ] . the position of the @ xmath10 - th spring is updated at integer multiple of @ xmath53 . consider the relative motion due to brownian motion , with displacement ##s by springs connected to the spring . updated at integer multiple of the timesteps associated with each spring , i . e . @ xmath54 , @ xmath55 using the fact that the springs , springs and timesteps are the same , then we can easily obtain the following formula . the number of the springs which are connected to the springs : + update of the first spring : + update of the second spring : + [ lemc##onsnum ] let @ xmath56 , @ xmath57 , @ xmath58 and @ xmath45 be positive integers and @ xmath0 be negative integers . consider a multi - resolution bea - spring model of algorithm @ xmath1 with @ xmath59 , @ xmath60 , for @ xmath3 , and @ xmath61 , for @ xmath6 . let the timesteps associated with each step be equal to @ xmath36 , i . e . @ xmath62 . for @ xmath63 , algorithm @ xmath64 is equivalent to the rouse - maruyama discretization of the rouse model given by algorithm @ xmath65 . # [ lemconsnum ] shows that the multi - resolution bea - spring model is a variant of the rouse model . in the next section , we will consider variants of this model which will allow us to select the appropriate parameter values for this model and use them for multiscale simulation of dna sequences . we have selected a multiscale simulation model which includes the same parameters as the model , but we would like to remove some of theself diffusion constant _ of the resolution regime being considered for the system . we define the random parameter for the system to be _ constant _ if the expected value of the parameter is equal to the resolution regime being considered for the system . we consider the _ self diffusion constant _ and _ mass - average ( rms ) end - to - end ratio _ , the statistics we want to keep consistent for our system , which can be varied by varying the beads size and the number of beads used . the best way to calculate these statistics will be discussed in this section . the _ self diffusion constant _ is given by @ xmath66 where @ xmath67 is the _ centre of mass _ of the polymer chain at time @ xmath39 , which is given by @ xmath68 definition ( [ q : com ] ) is an alternative to the definition given by wang and wang @ xcite for the centre of mass of a polymer chain on only one side . if two chains have the same length @ xmath69 ( i . e . if @ xmath59 for @ xmath70 ) , the definition ( [ q : com ] ) refers to the centre ofmass constant for the inverse volume equation . in this case , the effective mass constant is given by @ xcite @ xmath71 where @ xmath1 is the number of beads . this equation is the , on the face of it , linear combination of equation ( [ q : com ] ) with @ xmath2 . if we assumed that all beads have the same diameter , then the mass of each beads would be proportional to the diameter , i . e . to @ xmath72 . however , using equation ( [ q : com ] ) , we have solved with @ xmath2 instead of @ xmath73 because beads do not represent individual cell structures or nucleosomes , but parts of the cells within them , and the beads diameter varies with the diameter of the beads , which is not in the equation in this case . if we have biological cells , we could model each beads as a line for connecting base pairs at distances of , say , hundreds of base pairs away from the beads of the same diameter . the line in the equation is then drawn between the beads . this linear ##izes with @ xmath2 .first , consider the equation ( [ q : rousediff ] ) for the general polymer model . if we model the same particle with a more complex model consisting of twice as many parameters ( i . e . if we change @ xmath1 to @ xmath74 ) , then we need to change the particle number ( i . e . from @ xmath69 to @ xmath75 ) to obtain a simpler model with the self diffusion constant ( [ q : rousediff ] ) . in particular , the size of the particle varies with @ xmath69 ( and also with @ xmath76 ) . using the following formula , we apply equation ( [ q : rousediff ] ) to the general multi - resolution beads - spring model . [ lemdg ] let us consider a multi - resolution beads - spring model of parameters @ xmath1 and a set of timesteps , with each parameter representing the set of parameters @ xmath77 and @ xmath78 . then the self diffusion constant of the linear polymer model with parameter @ xmath64 is given by @ xmath79 = @ xmath64consider each step of our evolution rule . considering the function corresponding to the @ xmath10 - the beads of @ xmath2 and integrating over the function , we see how @ xmath80 changes during the timestep @ xmath36 . since @ xmath9 , n will decrease by 1 and the evolution rule for @ xmath80 changes to @ xmath81 where @ xmath82 $ ] and then @ xmath83 is evaluated for the values @ xmath84 and @ xmath85 . @ xmath86 let us denote by @ xmath87 the first integer value of @ xmath88 when function is evaluated at time @ xmath64 at integer multiple of @ xmath89 . we can derive the @ xmath90 from equation ( [ rgequation ] ) if we consider the evolution of @ xmath91 when function @ xmath39 is evaluated at integer multiple of @ xmath89 . we consider the evolution of @ xmath92 for @ xmath93 $ ] , where we consider the fact that thedistribution of normally distributed random variables is also normally distributed . dividing equation ( [ rgequation2 ] ) by @ xmath94 , we obtain @ xmath95 . \ ] ] dividing equation ( [ dgdef ] ) , we obtain ( [ cf : sdc ] ) . the equation ( [ cf : sdc ] ) is a modification of that ( [ cf : rousediff ] ) , for the rouse model . it is applied to the parameters such that the length of the beads @ xmath94 remains constant after integration of the number of beads and the length , so the rouse - model is valid . we find the _ end - to - end distance _ @ xmath96 from one end of the beads to the other @ xcite . an important quantity to consider prior to this is the _ mass - average ( rms ) end - to - end distance _ of the beads @ xmath97 . the expectation value of the long - term value of the rms end - to - end distance , _ @ xmath98 , for the modified rouse model is given by @ xcite @ xmath99 we obtain##ize this method yields the following results . [ lemrms ] let us consider a multi - dimensional disk - like object of size @ xmath1 with the requirements of size @ xmath77 . \ @ xmath100 and the long - term evolution of the rms end - to - end system is given by @ xmath101 . ( [ sdedef ] ) for the system of @ xmath102 linear sdes . however , the sdes corresponding to the spatial coordinates are not linear . we can restrict our analysis to the systems of the first coordinates of each beads , ( [ rmsbond ] ) . let us transform the systems of the first coordinates of the beads into the @ xmath103 - dimensional [ @ xmath104 . \ ] ] linear sdes ( [ sdedef ] ) can be applied to the system of sdes for @ xmath105 in the following form @ xmath106 where @ xmath107 is a three - diagonal matrix given by @ xmath108 @ xmath109 is a four - diagonal matrix given by @ xmath110 and @ xmath111 and @xmath1 - the density matrix @ xmath112 ^ [ . $ ] the corresponding density matrix , written as @ xmath113 is the solution of lyapunov equation @ xcite @ xmath114 . it can be easily shown that the exact solution of this equation is thus : @ xmath115 with and , @ xmath116 @ xmath117 dividing this matrix by n ( the number of elements ) , we obtain ( [ rmsbond ] ) . the end - to - end result can be written as @ xmath118 dividing into ( [ eqrmsend ] ) , and ( [ rmsbond ] ) and the fact that the inverse density matrix @ xmath119 is zero , we obtain ( [ eqrmsend ] ) . the [ lemdg ] and [ lemrms ] are similar results which have been obtained under slightly different assumptions . the [ lemdg ] is obtained as a consequence of the [ algoneiter ] , and the other result , namely ( [ l : sdc ] ) , also holds when we consider the non - similaritycoefficients of the sde formulation of the multi - resolution bea - spring polymer ( [ sdedef ] ) . the [ algoneiter ] is defined in such a way that all the coefficients associated to them hold when the differential equation for @ xmath120 is satisfied ( see also ( [ rgequation ] ) ) . in particular , the [ lemdg ] holds for any combination of the types of timesteps associated with the coefficients . on the other hand , the [ lemrms ] is the coefficient of the sde formulation ( [ sdedef ] ) . if we have a discretized version of ( [ sdedef ] ) , then we have a discretization error . this error can be made smaller by using smaller timesteps . in this case , we find that the smaller timesteps are only valid for the material with the highest optical resolution . we have a family of optical multi - resolution ( omr ) models used to model material properties subject to the error . [ defomr ] let us consider a bea - spring polymer composed of @ xmath1 springs of length @ xmath69 ##1 to @ xmath103 , with the ku##hn = @ xmath121 and indexed by @ xmath65 with timestep @ xmath36 . let us divide the data into @ xmath122 regions , @ xmath123 , @ xmath124 , and springs , i . e . @ xmath125 the next region contains beads indexed by @ xmath126 and the @ xmath84 - th region , @ xmath127 , contains beads indexed by @ xmath128 . let us associate with each region an index , @ xmath129 , where @ xmath130 = @ xmath131 , for @ xmath127 , and @ xmath132 for @ xmath133 , with at least one region in between @ xmath134 which is the region with the highest resolution . higher values of @ xmath135 give more details of the model . we define the omr model as the multi - region multi - element model which consists of @ xmath136 regions of both beads and springs . for the @ xmath84 - th region , we define @ xmath13##7 springs with chain length @ xmath138 and a chain length @ xmath139 multiplied by @ xmath140 where @ xmath141 is the number of springs which are equal to the number which have the same chain length @ xmath138 . we assume that the average radius of curvature at grain - size springs with chain length @ xmath142 and @ xmath138 equals @ xmath143 , for @ xmath144 therefore , we find that the average lengths of the first and second turns of the spring chains are equal to @ xmath145 and @ xmath146 , respectively . scaling into ( [ sjscalings ] ) into ( [ com : com ] ) , and into ( [ nm1assum ] ) , we find that the omr model has @ xmath147 scaling into ( [ com : sdc ] ) , we find that the omr model has the same energy - conservation coefficient as the original com model ( given by ( [ com : rousediff ] ) ) . for the model @ xmath148 , wewe use the [ lemrms ] and scaling ( [ sjscalings ] ) to calculate the maximum rms end - to - end resolution for the method : @ xmath149 which is approximately independent of the range of resolution @ xmath129 , @ xmath124 . since the path length and the width vary between samples , it is important to maximize the rms resolution of the method @ xcite . we need timesteps to be very small so that they do not vary too rapidly . for discretized versions of the [ algoneiter ] , these values are in the form @ xmath150 , which is equal to the @ xmath84 - resolution ratio of the omr region to @ xmath151 . scaling ( [ sjscalings ] ) and assuming that @ xmath152 is of the same resolution as the average resolution @ xmath138 , we find that the resolution of ( [ driftscal ] ) agrees with @ xmath129 . assuming that @ xmath36 is large in the standard crystal structure region and that @ xmath153 is small compared to the standardif @ xmath121 , then the second region of the omr model , given by ( [ driftscal ] ) is much smaller compared to @ xmath154 the computational lengthscale of the omr model in the @ xmath84 - th region , @ xmath155 if , we compare the results of calculations performed by the simple , single - molecule rouse model with the omr model . the @ xmath84 - th region has @ xmath137 resolution , with timestep @ xmath139 . using the ( [ sjscalings ] ) , we find that we make @ xmath156 - th better resolution in the @ xmath84 - th region , making better calculations with higher timesteps . assuming that the computational time of the calculations of the rouse model in this region is equal to the size of the region , @ xmath157 , we can estimate the amount of computational time which is spent on the omr model ( as compared to the rouse model ) . @ xmath158 for example , if we re - scale the rouse model , except the region , @ xmath159 , then( [ nm1assum ] ) and ( [ fraccost ] ) note that we speed up our simulations by the factor of 2 . in this section we assume that results of the omr method represent the actual large - scale theoretical results . we shall apply this to the results derived from equations ( [ p : sdc ] ) and ( [ q : rmse2e ] ) for the rms end - to - end dynamics and the self - assembly of the system in its initial state . for the theoretical simulations , we use the parameters : @ xmath160 where the persistence length is chosen to be longer than the persistence length of : @ xcite , and the other parameters are chosen accordingly . for the rest of this section , we shall consider @ xmath161 , @ xmath162 and @ xmath163 the volume of system . we use different scale models for the entire system , with the single scale model considering the entire system in high resolution and the multiscale model considering the whole @ xmath164 of the system in medium resolution and the end in low resolution . the main parameters of the omr method are given in : [ 1 :consistencyparams ] . the omr model has 500 beads connected by 68 springs , whereas the more complex model is represented as 501 beads connected by 68 springs . . _ description of the omr model is used to do this . _ [ fig : consistencyparams ] [ n = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , p = " ^ " , ] with these initial data points the process continues until the protein is either bound or has left the cell . in figure [ fig : transcriptionresults ] , we present the fraction of binding of the protein to the dna , @ xmath165 , as a fraction of the fraction [ @ xmath166 $ ] of the protein from the first set of the beads . we present @ xmath165 as the fraction of beads which end up with the protein bound to dna . the data shown in figure [ fig : transcriptionresults ] show the fraction of @ xmath165 resulting from @ xmath167 % binding of the protein . if @ xmath168 , then the protein is also bound to dna , i . e . @ xmath169 for @ xmath168 . if@ xmath170 , where the angle of binding is nonzero , because the initial placement , @ xmath171 , is the distance of the molecule from the end of the molecule . in general , the initial distance from end to end is less than or equal to the initial placement of , @ xmath171 , and the simulations ( with the exception of error ) take place as if @ xmath170 . , based on the point , @ xmath171 , from the data for the single - scale ( black points ) and omr ( blue lines ) models . error bars give a 95 % confidence interval based on the wilson score interval for these distributions @ xcite . _ [ ref : transcriptionresults ] ] due to the limitations of the single - scale model we run a simulation of initial distances , , @ xmath172 m , @ xmath173 ( black points ) , where error bars give a 95 % confidence interval based on the wilson score interval for these distributions @ xcite . we run another for the final distances , @ xmath174 m , @ xmath175 ( blue lines ) , where the confidence##ly = omr , and show our results from the first line in table [ tab : transcriptionresults ] . we note that @ xmath165 is very similar to the rouse - scale and omr models . the model also helps in reducing simulation errors . for @ xmath167 , with the data from @ xmath176 from the first line , with results shown in table [ tab : transcriptionparmas ] , the omr model showed a 1 . 5 - fold improvement compared to the rouse model , with only a 2 - fold time difference . we hope for higher scale models to show significant improvements in resolution . in this regard we have extended our protein modeling methods to multiple scales by extending omr models . we have developed an mcmc model for improving the resolution of a single scale model , as well as an extension to the rouse model to accurately model a protein which has multiple scales . the scale length , as well as the number of scales associated with the protein , is adjusted to ensure consistency with the end - to - end shape and length of the protein at multiple scales , as well as the timestep to ensure sequence stability . we have also extended the omr modeland a 3d model of dna binding to a small molecule , for which the omr model showed similar results to the single - scale model . we have also shown a 1 . 5 - fold speed - up in computational time over a model which had shown a 3 - fold increase in stability , which allows the use of the omr model as a way to speed up computation whilst maintaining the same degree of accuracy as the more computational ##ly single - scale model . the speed - up in computational time could be further improved by combining brownian motion based on self - discretization ( [ see : particlediffuse ] ) with simulation - based methods such as the fpkmc ( second order quantum monte carlo ) and gfrd ( generalized wave equation for dynamics ) and @ xcite . when considering the 3d behavior of the dna binding molecule , note that it is also possible to zoom in and out quickly , as long as the dimensions are such that we can see a three dimensional structure different from the microscopic structure ( i . e . , when we zoom in , the microscopic structure is not visible ) . therefore , especially in the context of cancer , genetic material and other dna - binding molecules can act as short - scale models .at large scale , the methods are used . to understand the structure of the molecule , the structure of the microscopic structure should be known immediately before starting out . the structure may serve as a measure of stability @ xcite , which can be easily estimated in living organisms using single - molecule structure experiments @ xcite . the omr method could be applied to chemical models of dna and other biological molecules which use the rouse model @ xcite in cases where certain regions of the molecule have higher stability than other regions . the model used in this article is molecular dynamics , which is moderately accurate in its predictions , but as we move much further towards the active regions , then we will have to pause to consider the structure and the chemical effects occurring in them . models which use molecular dynamics such as the zimm model @ xcite have also been used to look at molecular dynamics @ xcite . currently it is of interest to develop a hybrid model which combines the rouse model in low resolutions and the zimm model in high resolutions . the combination of these molecular models might produce different structures with hierarchical structures forming as we move through regions . as we move into higher resolutions , regions of polymers can be described as smooth @ xcite , unlikethe fjc is where forces between beads are included . the linear static model of kratky and porod @ xcite , implemented via algorithms from hagermann and zimm @ xcite , provides a non - linear force model for the forces between the beads . allison @ xcite then runs the zimm algorithm directly on top of the static model to simulate bending as well as bending forces . an important , multiscale approach is to combine this at higher resolutions , with the static model at lower resolutions , in order to create a hybrid model . to provide even more detail , we would consider the interactions and the interactions between these molecules in the model of allison and everaers @ xcite which shows lennard - smith and fene interactions between them . as we approach the hybrid model , it may be useful to use a molecular dynamics approach to model the dna structure . many brownian motion models can be derived from molecular dynamics , either directly @ xcite or indirectly @ xcite , depending on the accuracy of the molecular dynamics model . a number of protein - based coarse - grain models have been developed for this ( e . g . @ xcite ) , along with other molecular@ xcite . multiscale simulation techniques ( e . g . @ xcite with very high - resolution ) , as well as adaptive diffusion techniques ( e . g . @ xcite for # ##s ) , have been developed . we extend these techniques to work with dna - binding molecules at a more limited size and size range . on top of this , models for the dna recognition induced by molecules such as transcription factors could be developed ( for example , adaptive diffusion and recognition in the cells @ xcite ) . the need for developing and testing multiscale models of dna which use some of the most sophisticated imaging techniques for different parts of the dna molecule is further driven by recent experimental data . electron - microscopy ( 3c ) - based techniques , performed at the genome - wide level using high - resolution images ( hi - c @ xcite ) , reveal the three - dimensional structure of the dna in an interactive manner . moreover , these imaging techniques have enabled us to observe accurately the assembly and assembly of the dna molecules in the cells @ xcite . 3d structures could be constructed with the experimental data . recent hi - c studies have revealed 3d structures such as those formed by dna - binding proteins @ xcite . to develop more accurate models ,information about the binding sites for these proteins can be obtained when we increase the efficiency of our algorithms . s . shinkai , s . nozaki , s . maeshima , and s . togashi . dynamic nucleosome structure : structural analysis of dynamic protein structures in mature mammalian cells . biorxiv doi : 10 . 1101 / 059147 , 2016 .
