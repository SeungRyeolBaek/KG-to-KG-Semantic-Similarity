the generation of gravitational waves ( gws ) will emerge as one of the major scientific discoveries of this era . their discovery will open up a new observation path to the universe , revealing new aspects of the field of physics previously overlooked by conventional astronomical methods . our understanding of space - time and physics under the most extreme conditions will be enhanced . although there has been no direct detection of gws to date , the evidence for their existence comes from high resolution , nobel - prize winning observations of the star psr 1913 + 1 and its companion neutron star ( ns ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? the gw mechanism that causes the due to gravity change is in agreement with the predictions of general relativity to greater than 90 % @ xcite . when the two neutron star ( ns ) systems eventually merge , they are expected to produce large amounts of gws @ xcite . these stars will become prime targets for the next generation of gw detectors , led by the ligo ( aligo ; * ? ? ? * ) which is expected to begin operation during the first half of 2015 and by itself a year later @ xcite . at high resolution , these new detectors are able to detect stellar activity at highand in the range 0 . 4400 au @ xmath0 @ xcite . close neutron stars ( ns ) consisting of at least one black hole ( s ) are common sources for gw events ; although there is strong evidence for their existence @ xcite , the exact histories of these sources for aligo data are not yet known . one hypothesis from the last decade is that the clusters of ns / ns and ns / ns ##0 could be the source of long - duration gamma ray bursts ( sgrbs ) ; # ##s are found in the electromagnetic ( x ) spectrum @ xcite . there are other sources of particle , radio and gamma ray bursts that may also be associated with gw events . these include long - duration gamma ray bursts ( lgrbs ; * ? ? ? * ) , and gamma ray bursts @ xcite , galaxies @ xcite , and radio bursts @ xcite as well as others . research has also shown that multi - source sources can play an important role in discovering these events . in the last decade , x - ray , optical and infrared follow - ups have all helped and enabled new developments in our understanding of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ); combining these observations with those at the gw observatory will also provide new insight into the computing tools and systems that work with a variety of light sources . a new generation of telescopes , wide - field observations , advances in time series analysis and improvements to radio and gamma ray detectors will provide a new platform for research . the successful direct detection of galaxies , electrons and high energy particles with gws would be a major achievement for astronomy , and a new phase of _ _ multi - disciplinary _ _ research , for the first time in gw . achieving the opportunities offered by gw observatory requires the establishment of a strong , multi - disciplinary collaboration . australian institutions are well positioned to facilitate scientific collaboration in this broad area and partnerships have already been established . to facilitate the follow - up of gw observations , memorandum of understanding ( mous ) have been signed between the ligo / australian gw observatory and a number of institutions either based in australia or with significant international support ; these include : the anglo - australian telescope , the australian square kilometre array telescope ( askap ; * ? ? ? * ) , the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ; * ? ? ? * ) , the high energy telescope array ( hi. . . . . ( ; * ? ? ? * ) , icecube @ xcite , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the skymapper @ xcite , the gw radio telescope observatory ( goto ) and zadko @ xcite radio telescopes . in this paper , we focus on the most important multi - messenger sources from the early survey efforts ; those associated with grbs . whilst doing this , we discuss the contribution that the new observatory will make to the current multi - messenger observations . the content of this paper is as follows : section 2 describes gw observations . sections 3 and 4 describe sgrbs and lgrbs and explain how co - operative gw and multiwavelength observations of these sources can provide new information . section 5 serves as a guide for those familiar with the techniques and tools of detection and data analysis as used in the gw survey ; this section is not intended to be comprehensive but to describe some of the most basic concepts of gw detection and data analysis . section 6 describes the data sensitivity and detection requirements for gw observations . the next two sections describe some of the techniques that form the basis for the gwand other observations of the gw data . section 7 discusses em and gw observations ; these could possibly be the most successful gw - astronomy collaboration using the gw data . section 8 discusses the successful follow - up of gw observations ; this task is extremely difficult due to the large scale nature of gw , and the # ##s for it are without doubt very high . section 9 discusses the many scientists involved in the co - operative research project with aligo / adv and we discuss the ways in which they could contribute to this scientific endeavour . finally , in section 11 we discuss the role that follow - up plays in gw astronomy . gravitational waves are observed in regions of space - time that are dominated by high energy charged particles of matter . the timescale of the observations determines the strength of the gw signal ; ground based telescopes can detect objects with frequencies in the range of @ xmath1 @ xmath2 , which is called the @ hz10 frequency range . this frequency range , called the ghz range , has developed the concept of interferometric gw , or ` ` listening to the universe ' ' . telescopes capable of doing this will begin operation in the second half of 2015 . "ligo , a network of us navy interferometric detectors at hanford and hawaii ( * * ? ? ? * ) will begin its first operational observing run ( o1 ) in 2014 - 2015 ; a year later it will be joined by the australian detector , ( adv ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) for its second observing run ( o2 ) . the ` ` new ' ' generation of interferometric gw detectors will now have three times the sensitivity of the previous generation detectors . the increased sensitivity translates into a 1 @ xmath3 increase in detector size , making it possible rather than expected . more detectors are expected to soon join the network . kagra , a chinese detector , is expected to begin operation in 2018 - 2019 @ xcite and ligo - 1 is expected to be operational from 2020 , reaching its operational goal at the same time as aligo by late 2022 @ xcite . the gw observations made by these detectors will differ from most other astronomical detectors in three ways : 1 . gws are not scattered or dominated by dark - energy matter and provide a window into the outer regions of the universe . because gw detectors measure an abundance rather than a mass , the range of the##ability of the power law with distance rather than the usual inverse power law . 2 , the number of a given number of x - ray pairs increase with distance , @ xmath4 , or , @ xmath5 , rather than , @ xmath6 ; 3 . because gws come directly to the detectors , the most small distance sources of gws tend to be highly energetic sources of electromagnetic radiation ; 4 . gw detectors are nearly universal , with a large @ xmath7 detection bias to detect events with a higher than average intensity over more than 50 % of the universe . the first point is that gw detectors will allow one to observe astronomical objects only by optical means . the detection window will also allow for observations into the low to medium mass range ( @ xmath8 ) of objects that are electromagnetically active for part , or all , of their lifetime . the second point is that a factor 5 increase in the sensitivity of a gw detector results in a factor 6 increase in the mass of the universe being studied . the third point is the detection window for only the most highly energetic astronomical objects . the detection range of gw is order of magnitude @xmath9 jy , much lower than the frequency range indicated by the em spectrum ( @ xmath10jy jy ) . the end result is that gw instruments are naturally occurring instruments with a narrow range of frequencies ( 105000 hz ) . there are a number of types of em interactions that could be associated with gw emissions @ xcite . while some of these associations are quite common , this article focuses on gw emissions associated with grbs . possible causes of both em and gw emissions include em as well as the interference ##s from nss ; for a discussion of the latter , see the main article in this section @ xcite . in the next few pages we give a discussion of the sgrbs and lgrbs and the types of gw / em interactions that could be observed in the gw spectrum . some of these associations are based on simple observations whilst others are more complex . when considering the latter , we find that when a wide field of research has been undertaken in the past , the interactions that improve our understanding of the universe have always been the most important . + radio waves from the merger of the binary stars of ns / bs and ns / bs are now believed to be obser##vable > ) . this phenomenon is a consequence of the association between these stars and sgrbs ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? the data comes from a number of different sources . firstly , the long timescales of events resulting from the migration of stars are consistent with the existence of sgrbs . secondly , the break - up of sgrbs has not produced an em transient . third , sgrb ##s have been observed to discs containing large stellar populations with distances of several tens of kpc from their respective centers ; this is consistent with co - orbital radial velocity of hundreds of kilometers , @ xmath0 , and consistent with the shorter and longer duration ##s expected from an interacting stellar population on a large scale . finally , as previously noted by [ kilonova ] , the discovery of a second em transient , * _ kilonova _ 1 provides the first experimental evidence to support of the sgrb / cbc association . further evidence of the cbc / sgrb association can be obtained from gw observations . both em and gw observations of sgrbs could beproviding a new insight to the fundamental physics at the core of grbs . low - energy gw ##p could provide multi - wavelength follow - up coverage of the prompt emission , revealing both the underlying physical mechanism and the physical processes at hand . real - time multi - wavelength follow - up could provide insight and further coverage of the sgrb process . a number of em interactions have been observed to cause the inspiral and fusion of bs / bs and bs / bs particles . in the [ 1 _ 1 _ 2 ] we describe the possible effects of these interactions and in the following section we will briefly describe the most extreme em counterparts that could be observed . during the initial phase of the formation of the solar system , the system is expected to produce a large hot plasma that interact with itself and the surrounding region ( the ideal medium for grbs ; e . g . * ? ? ? ) of matter moving at high speed . the interaction will lead to intense heating , producing short - lived bursts of x - rays that we see in the sgrb prompt emission . when the initial timescale is expected to be @ xmath112 or @ xcite , the grbs interact withsuch cluster bursts are generally shorter in duration than those associated with core - collapse events ( see the size difference of grbs ; * ? ? ? . however , the difference between these burst types is not easily determined from the observed gamma - ray burst spectrum ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . a number of _ _ _ - _ grbs have observed @ xmath12gev bursts ( even at distances as far as @ xmath13 ) . these bursts were observed with gamma - ray bursts with energies corresponding to 94gev ( grb 130427a ) and 62gev ( grb 131231a ) this supports the hypothesis that the burst energies may be higher than those observed @ xcite . however , these observations have largely been limited to lgrbs , with sgrbs also observing high energy bursts and gev bursts , lasting for several periods of time after the initial burst . the fact that _ - _ - has observed a burst of ~ 31gev during the initial burst of grb 090510 @ xcite is useful for post - observation analysis using gw ##b and ground - based cherenkov .and @ xcite , and @ xmath12 ##0 gev . also , sgrbs with time - dependent lifetime have also been identified as possible candidates for cherenkov - type @ xcite . the other possibility is the emission of prompt gamma rays . so far , these flashes have only been detected by lgrbs @ xcite . the near infrared signal associated with the prompt gamma - rays could be a cosmic source related to the internal shock @ xcite . a number of studies have suggested that compact binary mergers could be caused by radio bursts ( e . g . , * ? ? ? ) , from heating of the medium of the compact binary merger @ gws @ xcite , from the ever - changing magnetic field of the collision @ xcite , or from the interaction of the energy of the internal shock with the surrounding environment @ xcite . however , the detectability of signals from these sources may be dependent upon the interference from the surrounding environment @ xcite . therefore , these studies suggest compact binary mergers are an important mechanism for the generation of coherent radio bursts ( frbs ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which are currently ongoing . fluctuations and peaks in x - ray light emission at gr##bs ##t indicative of ongoing energy release . this could be caused by late - stage fusion onto a nearby black hole ( as in the close burst event ; see also at * ? ? ? * ) , or from the energy release from the spindown of a newly formed neutron star . however , recent studies ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) have shown that the merger of two nss could result in a supramassive star ; a star with secondary mass greater than the non - stellar primary , and free from both fusion and fusion @ xcite . over 90 % of x - ray burst light spectra of sgrbs observed by the _ x _ probe @ xcite have shown emission around 10010000 years after the burst ; these have been compared to the spin - down emission from protomagnetars @ xcite produced via the merger of two neutron stars @ xcite . observations of the fusion process can also be used to determine the stellar equation of motion , with gw analysis of the inspiral disk greatly improving this . @ xcite if the pre - burst source is an object , the burst emissions as high as the magnitudeonly this event ( at a distance of @ xmath14 mpc ; see [ references _ and _ references ] ) could be observed from observations of the radio - frequency protomagnetar ##ium @ xcite . this magnetar collision could produce ejecta at high energies which would interact with the surrounding gas and produce a characteristic white light from gravitational radiation @ xcite . gravitational wave radiation can also produce an emission signal if a single magnetar is recovered from the collision . several methods for producing the gws exist in the neutron stars , including @ # ##yon ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , @ xmath15 - 1 @ xcite , and strong - field induced stellar winds @ xcite . this phenomenon could be mapped by aligo ##t to @ xmath16 mpc @ xcite . in addition , the x - ray light source itself could be used to determine the observed gw emission from these sources @ xcite . neutron stars in sgrbs undergo an extremely high transition temperature , often interpreted as the conversion of the parent neutron star tosee black hole @ xcite . such objects could also form at frb when the magnetic field lines weaken as they approach the event horizon @ xcite , which is expected to collapse @ xmath17 seconds after the collapse @ xcite . the 3 - gw model could be a follow - up to test this model @ xcite . as the shock jet propagates , it reacts with the medium around the jet resulting in a forward shock travelling into the surrounding medium , and a reverse shock travelling back into the jet ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? these shock waves produce multi - wavelength electromagnetic radiation , first appearing in the x - rays and passing through the radio transition to infrared as it travels . the strong emission of grbs is due to the forward shock , and the strength of this emission is dependent upon a number of factors , including the density of the surrounding medium . however , in a low density medium , the forward shock emission is expected to be very weak . the multi - wavelength emissions of sgrbs have been observed and are much weaker than those of lgrbs @ xcite . this is consistent with sgrb##s are more common than lgrbs and with their origins in higher energy regions . the same phenomenon has also been observed for sgrb 051221a ( e . g . * ? ? ? * ) . a ` kilonova ' is also thought to occur after the collision of the nss . this unusual ir emission is caused by the radioactive decay of the ejected neutron rich matter @ xcite and could be detected 21 - 24 mag in the ir and 21 - 24 mag in the nir for a wavelength of 1 mpc @ xcite . the ir and near - infrared follow - up observations of grb 130603b have provided the most experimental evidence to date of this phenomenon , supporting the hypothesis that compact object candidates are the result of sgrbs @ xcite . these observations have led up to further experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis @ xcite . the ir and gw observations could suggest that sgrbs are also the result of such compact objects . an unusual strong neutron emission due to the kilonova event has also recently been observed in @ xcite . this has been supported by observations that only a small fraction of the ejected neutron rich matter could decay rapidly enough to cause s - .and @ xcite . the result was that @ xmath18 - emission from the gas in the outer disk of this ejecta could produce short pulses over a timescale of hours after the burst , peaking at around magnitude 20 in the u - band for a burst . for a burst of 1 mpc this pulse would peak at around magnitude 30 in the u - band and would serve as a precursor to the kilonova . lgrbs are amongst the most powerful radio sources in the universe in terms of luminous energy per unit viewing area . these short bursts have been observed to occur up to @ xmath19 and @ xcite and to have a luminous energy similar to that of the sun at only ~ 1 gyr ##ons . the high temperatures allow lgrbs to be observed up to large distances , making them a part of the high energy universe ( @ xmath20 ) . the simplest model for these events is known as the collapsar model @ xcite in which the inner disk of a wolf - rayet star slowly collapses to form a rapidly expanding black hole . its angular momentum causes the infalling disk to form an outer disk , which in turnusing the energy released to create an anti - matter plasma that winds its way through the outer atmosphere . the internal plasma is dominated by direct and / or indirect electromagnetic radiation from the surrounding electrons and ions and gravitational radiation . some researchers have suggested instead that the stellar plasma may consist of magnetars @ xcite . there is insufficient evidence to support this hypothesis for at least a number of lgrbs @ xcite . the association of lgrbs with the formation of massive stars @ xcite has been confirmed by several observations in and around dense regions of massive star - formation ; including the starburst spiral galaxies @ xcite . as noted above , their spiral structures , as well as their higher surface brightness , suggest that the multiwavelength spectra of lgrbs are much brighter than those that result from sgrbs @ xcite . in terms of gw emission from these events , a number of lgrbs have been associated with core - collapse events @ xcite . however the gw emission from these events is very complex , involving a combination of general relativity fields , magnetic fields , gravity , r ##s and chemical reactions @ xcite . these includeso it is a demonstration of a highly complex and complex mechanism that involves shock waves and resonance that produces extremely complex pulses with large pulse lengths over long distances . however , recent studies suggest this mechanism would need to occur within tens of kpc for detection . since most lgrbs occur at great distances , the vast majority of their gw emissions would be out of reach for modern astronomers . the need for rapid rotation to rotate the axis of the grb @ xcite allows for novel detection techniques that could produce transient gws up to tens of mpc @ xcite . these emissions could be observed in the sun or in the galaxy @ xcite . rapid rotation could also give rise to these emissions in the protoneutron ##ic ##p @ xcite a number of studies have suggested there is a sub - class of lgrbs known as low - energy grbs ( _ _ ll _ _ grbs ) . these stars have an extreme x - ray emission 2 - 3 orders of magnitude below the lgrbs @ xcite and have only been detected by c - @ xmath21 due to their low energy levels ( the closest is grb980425 , z = ) .0085 ( 36mpc ) . as such their energies have been estimated to be several orders of magnitude higher than lgrbs . experiments have shown that both lgrbs and _ _ ll _ _ grbs are bursts , and that the _ _ ll _ _ grbs may actually be high - energy jets from the direction of the burst . this has been a # ##standing problem and attempts to resolve it have included statistical analysis @ xcite , corrections to the local flux distribution @ xcite , and simulations @ xcite . the possibility that _ _ ll _ _ grbs could be just ordinary lgrbs travelling off - axis is also based on these observations , as they would have a much larger local flux distribution than expected from lgrbs and would produce higher phase transitions for lgrbs than expected from the burst of the lightcurves @ xcite . however , statistical analysis of _ _ ll _ _ grb 060218 has shown that the main difference between the two bursts comes from the extremely low - energy envelope . _ _ the presence of such an envelope would accelerate the burst and produce a strong gravitational # ##wave in a much higher direction than that produced by the anti - relativist##ic ##b that is able to travel to the red earth planet . however , the same models for the models put forth in @ xcite could not model these two different scenarios . it is also possible that gw transmission lines could be used by the same kind of mechanism for both these scenarios . the output from a typical gw detector consists of a time series data sequence , @ xmath22 , consisting of the amplitude response to a gw signal , @ xmath23 , and the detector noise @ xmath24 : @ xmath25 in general , @ xmath23 will be a linear combination of the measured individual detector noise , @ xmath26 , divided by the dimensionless detector noise size , for the two signals @ xmath27 : @ xmath28 which represents the amplitude response to signals of both signals , coming from opposite directions @ xcite . the signals , @ xmath29 and @ xmath30 , represent the angle to the source and @ xmath31 represents the phase angle of the source . a gw detector can measure the amplitude of a gw signal , but the time series is usually represented in the frequency domain by the sample rate data sequence , @xmath32 . this quantity is defined as the power spectral density @ xmath33 , with @ xmath34 the fourier transform of the frequency domain . alternatively , one can define a signal power spectral density , @ xmath35 , and a noise power spectral density , @ xmath36 . the noise power spectral density is given by : @ xmath37 with values of @ xmath38 @ xcite . this quantity is often used in plots to determine the resolution of gw interferometers . a typical gw detector does not detect the ground motion in the vicinity of a given signal . to obtain accurate resolution , a highly distributed network of gw detectors is required . such a network can use techniques such as _ temporal analysis _ , in which the signals from different sources are correlated over time @ xcite , or _ spatial analysis _ , in which the signal events are correlated when looking for a coherent source @ xcite . by simultaneously measuring the relative times of occurrence of gw events between members of the network , temporal pattern analysis allows the detector array to provide an all - around resolution with high angular resolution of the individual signals . a high angular resolution is of particular importance for gw / ir applications . for the mostalso in this study , the ##ity was improved for calculation of arrival times . to reduce the transmission cost , and to improve reliability , it is recommended that the detectors be as geographically widely distributed as possible @ xcite and as such , a number of detectors are expected to join the aligo / adv network within the next decade . the indian detector kagra , should start operations in late 2018 - 20 @ xcite ; at this time this detector could improve the directional precision of the aligo / adv network by a factor of 1 . 5 - 2 and the detection time by a large factor @ xcite . ligo - a detector with aligo technology will be added to the aligo / adv network in 2022 . 2020 events will be sent directly to @ xmath39200 mpc and up to 1000 events are detected per second @ xcite . the india detector will improve the directional precision enough to increase the number of gw events detected per second deg @ xmath40 from 3 - 5 % to 10 % @ xcite . it has long been thought that the gw detector in india would send the same signal to the more powerful global detectors ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; *? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? for example , adding an et detector to the aligo / adv 3 dimensional array would reduce the difference in detection times to tens of arc - seconds for the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) measurements @ xcite , thus increasing the ability to detect gw signals for multi - year follow - up observations . this benefit could be realized when next generation detectors such as the ` european gravitational wave observatory ' ( et ) target a target for the next generation @ xcite . the ideal location for a target in the future has been shown to be in oregon @ xcite , the state home to the multi - year operation of gw detector . the false alarm rate ( set ) is the rate that false alarms occur above a certain snr value , and is dependent on the number of sources ( non - model sources ) in the gw data stream . it is a significant factor as it determines whether a source should be selected for follow - up . for fully modeled sources , the rate of false alarms is at a level similar to that of background noise . for non - modeled sources , long lived , the data stream has a greater impact on the detector . some of thethe threshold is set so that noise generated by detectors is minimal . note that the probability , @ xmath41 , of detecting an event with an amplitude in the range @ xmath42 to @ xmath43 is given by the probability distribution of standard deviation @ xmath44 , the probability of detecting results with less than a certain threshold , @ xmath45 , is : @ xmath46 to be 100 % sure that a gw has been detected , we must have a snr @ xmath47 which is set to a level of 1 in 100 years of time . to do this one must consider levels of noise generated during that time . if the detector combined sampling rate is 1 , and the noise is filtered by @ xmath48 then , after 100 years we set @ xmath49 , then @ xmath50 which is our combined snr . for a network of three equivalent detectors the snr , @ xmath51 is given by : @ xmath52 where @ xmath53 is the snr of the ith detector @ xcite . this means that for a network of three equivalent detectors , to detect false alarms at a level @ xmath54hz= @ xmath55 . + the resulting gw signals from merger depend on the well known sampling pattern shown in figure [ _ _ 1 ] . the figure shows how the signal changes in both amplitude and phase towards infinity ; when it does , it spreads over the entire output of the gw interferometric detector . for very well - modelled sources , the most common signal processing method to extract information from the sampled signals is _ _ integration _ , in which _ _ filter _ , or the sampled signal as a function of frequency is matched with the output of the detector @ xcite . the matched signal will have an average amplitude greater than that calculated for white noise with an average snr given by : @ xmath56 ^ { 1 / 2 } . \ { { x : snr } \ ] ] for well - modelled sources , the filtering reduces the amplitude of the signal by a factor @ xmath57 , where @ xmath58 is the number of cycles used in the integration . in inspiralling to the integration , even though the sampled signal gw is ##s ##nr , the number of cycles in the sample rate , @ xmath59 , is small ; thus the sampled signal will vary . thisnote that for inspiraling systems , rather than just using the measured size of the pulse as a reliable measure of the detectability , we use the count of the individual pulses . the value of @ xmath58 increases with the size of the pulse as it grows , and if measured from a distance of 10 cycles until infinity , could produce @ xmath60 , thereby increasing the detectability by a factor of 10 . however , to achieve these results , the gw pulse - detection would have to be done over a large number of cycles ( of example @ xmath61 ) in real time the enormous challenges of both the physics and computational methods to achieve this can easily be overcome . an important advantage of computer - based inspiralling systems is that pulse detection can be done hundreds of cycles before the merger if enough pulses can be measured to determine the snr @ xcite . figure 1 illustrates this by showing a pulse detected just before the merger occurs . this technique could allow a long - duration pulse to be sent out to detection sites as near real - time as possible to perform a successful pulse detection ; the combination of em and gw data in this case would give an insight into the inner workings of theastronomical distances . it is also worth noting that gws observations provide an accurate measure of cosmic distance , @ xmath62 @ xcite . during the inspiral period , the gw strain , and the rate of change of gw strain are measured by @ xmath63 where @ xmath64 is the redshifted component mass , @ xmath65 , and @ xmath66 , @ xmath67 are the component masses of the source . thus , if one can measure the size of , for example , a binary system , one can determine the mass - component mass relation because of the cosmic distance law . a recent series of studies has expanded this field by developing new methods for resolving the mass - component mass relation with the gw observations @ xcite . although instrumental sampling is the best method for small , linear sources , large instrumental artifacts due to astronomical and cosmic distances can cause gw observations to be non - linear and non - accurate . therefore , one can develop new methods that can remove these artifacts and measure the observed gw strain . one such method is the @ xmat##h68 . that is a simple model checking method to detect the @ @ xcite . this method exploits the fact that the @ @ xmath45 is almost constant at all frequencies and is very sensitive to the contributions from all frequency components of the input signal . we can divide the data back into @ xmath58 bin of equal snr ##s , and create a model with the average power of each bin ( depending on the bin size ) . a true gw ##p will have power accumulated almost equally in each of @ xmath58 bin ; a true p will have power equally accumulated and will have a true @ xmath68 j . , m . a . , abbott , d . j . a . , angstadt , s . , et al . 2012 , ieee society of photo -
