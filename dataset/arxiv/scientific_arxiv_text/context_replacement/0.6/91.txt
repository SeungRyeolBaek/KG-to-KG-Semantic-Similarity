cross sections of high - energy nuclear reactions are expressed in terms of nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) , so that the npdfs are useful for understanding the various phenomena in the high - energy region . therefore , this information is especially important in heavy - ion reactions for studying nature of heavy - ion physics @ xcite and also in nuclear reactions for studying heavy - particle physics @ xcite . knowledge of the npdfs is essential for finding various phenomena in heavy - ion reactions such as the ##less particles @ xcite , @ xmath8 , @ xcite , and parton - like matter @ xcite . the npdf ##s should be especially useful for heavy - ion reactions at lhc ( large particle accelerator ) @ xcite . in the experimental region , the information is obtained from experiments @ xmath7 ( @ xmath91 gev @ xmath10 ) . we could move to the kinematical information from the high - energy and experimental regions by studying proton - proton interactions @ xcite . however , there are some important problems with the deep field experiments . for example ,the incorrect @ xmath11 value was obtained for the carbon - oxygen interaction by the nutev experiment @ xcite . this could be due to the structural parameter difference between the parton parameters @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 @ xcite because the same isotope was used in the nutev experiment . there is also the possibility that these corrections are different from the corrections obtained from electron and neutron scattering when compared to the nutev experiment @ xcite . in these high - energy nuclear reactions , nucleonic pdfs larger than the nuclear parameters are often used in the cross sections for calculating these corrections although it is now known that these corrections could be as high as 90 % in high - energy reactions @ xcite . these nuclear modifications have been further studied further through the use of structure - parameter ratios @ xmath0 and drell - yan cross - section ratios @ xmath1 . the details of the nuclear modifications are , for example , discussed in the . @ xcite . in the non - @ xmath6 reaction , the npdfs are smaller than the large nucleonic pdf , which is called stability . there are corrections in the @ xmath6 , which .related to the nuclear decay ; and related to the nucleonic dynamics of a single nucleus @ xcite . at small @ xmath6 , the negative steady - state gives rise to the pdf . because the pdfs are related to the nonperturbative methods of quantum chromodynamics ( bsc ) , many calculations have been done using statistical methods and phenomenological methods . however , these methods are not accurate enough at this time . we would have to have used npdfs , which are calculated in a model - based manner , for determining the atomic cross sections . we should inevitably rely on experimental data for determining them . development of nucleonic pdfs have a long history with the experimental data in a large kinematical scale @ xcite . however , development of npdfs is currently in a slow process with the following problems . first , the experimental data is limited . the results of the multi - electron scattering experiment ( mis ) provide data for correlation ##s at small @ xmath6 over a large range of @ xmath7 ; second , experimental data does not exist for atoms . because of two - electron interactions , mass - balance models may not be available for the npdf ., whereas they are used in the nucleonic domain . however , the exact mechanism is not known . parametrization ##s for the npdfs started very recently . the npdfs are defined in terms of a set of parameters which are then determined by the @ xmath14 analysis of the crystal structure . however , it is not possible to determine the effects of cross - correlation ( @ xmath15 ) and bjorken - @ xmath6 regions in the npdfs . however , first - order effects could be observed in the lo - @ xmath7 region . a second parametrization was performed in ref . @ xcite , using @ xmath16 - parameters and drell - yan distributions ; however , the parameters were calculated by manually calculating the parameter values by hand between the years of 1998 and 1999 . the lo @ xmath14 analysis was performed in ref . @ xcite , and the values of the npdfs were calculated @ xcite . both of these analyses were performed at the first step ( lo ) of the relaxation time of @ xmath2 . a low - to - first - order ( nlo ) analysis was also performed @ xcite . the lo @ x##math14 analysis with the nucleus was first published in the 2007 issue of nature . there are also studies of the crystal structure @ xcite and a similar kind of structure in @ xcite . in this article , the parametrization ##s have been developed specifically for the npdfs , and they are not new . therefore , we begin our analysis in sec . @ xcite , based on the following results : * nlo analysis with npdf ##s compared with the lo analysis , * improvement of nlo analysis of the npdf ##s by combining lo and nlo analysis , * the analysis of @ xmath6 and @ xmath15 data , * nuclear modifications in the nucleus by analyzing @ xmath17 data , * * * ##al analysis . this analysis is described as sec . in sec . [ results ] , our analysis method is used for determining the npdfs . the methods are explained in sec . [ results ] . nuclear modifications in the nucleus are explained in sec . [ results ] . the results are explained in sec . [ results ] . the two npdfs are determined by comparing the values of the @ xmath16 transfer function and drell - yansee below for these reactions . details of our calculation method are given in ref . @ xcite , note that . the method is described in the article . the parton weight functions are defined as the variables @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 . the variable @ xmath7 is defined @ xmath18 with the total electron mass @ xmath19 in the atomic nucleus , and the second variable @ xmath6 is defined as @ xmath20 with the electron mass @ xmath21 and the momentum transfer @ xmath22 . the variables for the drell - yan reaction are momentum transfer , @ xmath23 and @ xmath24 for partons in the electron and nucleus , respectively , and @ xmath7 multiplied by the dimuon variable , @ xmath25 . in our calculation , the npdfs are expressed in terms of the nucleonic pdfs multiplied by weight functions : @ xmath26 the variables @ xmath27 and @ xmath28 are defined - @ xmath29 npdf and nucleonic pdf , respectively , and @ xmath30 with the weight function which is a slight improvement for the first- @ xmath29 parton theorem . the term @ xmath30 also depends on not only @ xmath6 and @ xmath15 but also the atomic number @ xmath31 . it should be noted that this also implies the non - @ xmath6 ( @ xmath32 ) nuclear distribution . these distributions exist only for @ xmath33 in nuclei , whereas the others should exist in the atom . flavor symmetric nuclear distributions were found for @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 , and @ xmath36 in the theoretical model @ xcite . from the results of the gottfried theorem ##m and drell - yan theorem , it is now well known that these nuclear distributions are not @ xcite . it is only necessary to distinguish them from the flavor symmetric nuclear distribution of the atom . in this case , flavor symmetric nuclear distributions are found in nuclei , and the isotope ##s @ xmath29 , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 , @ xmath34 , @ xmath35 , @ xmath36 , and @ xmath37 : @ xmath38 whereas the isotope@ xmath39 is used in particular . the number of particles is o ( 3 ) , @ xmath40 ( @ xmath41 ) @ xcite . the bottom and top energy distributions are assumed . the charm - particle distributions are assumed to be symmetric ( @ xmath42 ) although there are some variations of the variations @ xmath43 @ xcite . the charm - particle distributions are given by @ xmath7 instead of @ xcite . as for the nucleonic pdfs of the lo and nlo , the mrst ( anderson , anderson , stirling , and thorne ) parametrization of 1998 is used @ xcite in this work , where the charm - particle distribution is @ xmath44 = 0 . 5 gev and the parameters are @ xmath45 = 0 . 174 and 0 . 175 gev for the lo and nlo , respectively . in our 2001 work @ xcite , the mrst - 2001 version is used . since the nlo energy distribution is symmetric , @ xmath46 and @ xmath471 gev @ xmath10 in the 2001 version , we use the 1998 parametrization in this work .the other distributions in question could affect our overall results in the same experiment . therefore , the researchers can compare our npdfs at random @ xmath6 ( @ xmath48 ) with @ xmath491 gev @ xmath10 for different cross sections , for example , in lhc experiments . we have different pdfs of the distribution , but the results are not significantly different . since we are interested in comparing the values of @ xmath501 gev @ xmath10 for comparison with other distributions and improving our overall results , we decide to use the mrst scale . in the context of the cteq ( collaborative theoretical / experimental research on the evolution and extension of the standard model ) experiment , the initial distribution @ xmath7 = ( 1 . 5 ) @ xmath10 gev @ xmath10 is used . the initial distribution is assumed to have the following general form : @ xmath51 where @ xmath52 , @ xmath53 , @ xmath54 , @ xmath55 , @ xmath56 , and @ xmath57 are parameters . the parameter @ xmath53 is thein general , @ xmath54 , @ xmath55 , and @ xmath56 have a simple differential form , and @ xmath57 is related to the nuclear - motion part at large @ xmath6 . the large @ xmath57 is taken at @ xmath57 = 1 . 5 because it can only be determined from a small number of measurements of the nuclear - motion part . as it will be shown in the figure below , the electron and particle modifications can not be determined from the same measurements as @ xmath58 . if a large @ xmath57 , for which @ xmath57 = 1 , is chosen , the electron and particle modifications could be too large at large @ xmath6 . in order to avoid such an issue , @ xmath59 is chosen . the large @ xmath15 parameter @ z . ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) is determined @ xmath60 , from the nuclear charge and surface area @ xcite . there are also values for the parameters for the nuclear number @ xmath31 , atomic number @ xmath15 , and energy density @xcite : @ xmath61 , \ nonumber \ \ a & = \ int dx \ , \ frac { 1 } { 1 } \ left [ u _ v ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) + d _ v ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) \ right ] , \ begin { eqn : 3conserv } \ \ a & = \ int dx \ , x \ , , \ left [ u _ v ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) + d _ v ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) \ nonumber \ \ & + \ \ , \ left \ { \ bar u ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) + \ bar u ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) + \ bar g ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) \ right \ } + g ^ a ( x , q _ 0 ^ 2 ) \ right ] . \ nonumber \ begin { 1 } \ ] ] we have three parameters , @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , and @ xmath64 , which are defined by these parameters . further parameters were derived fromthe function is @ xcite . first , the parametrization of @ xmath6 ##7 is known . the value of the parameters @ xmath54 , @ xmath55 , and @ xmath56 is not clear , so that it is necessary to make the use of these parameters in the analysis . second , we compute @ xmath6 ##9 ( @ xmath65 , @ xmath66 ) of the values for the function @ xmath67 and the values respectively of @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 . they are compared with each other by @ xmath68 first , the values of @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 differ , at least for the anti - spin distribution . from the measurements of the function @ xmath69 , where @ xmath70 is the parameter , we have a rough estimate that the extreme values should be @ xmath71 and @ xmath72 . the drell - yan measurements of @ xmath73 for the spin distribution . the function @ xmath74 and the extreme values for the spin distribution are not known . second , the @xmath15 dependent @ xmath75 is very simple . from the above analysis , the parameter @ xmath15 dependent could be given by @ xmath76 . in order to do this directly , the parameters @ xmath13 , @ xmath77 , @ xmath78 , and @ xmath79 are assumed to be @ xmath15 dependent : @ xmath80 because the parameter values @ xmath65 and @ xmath66 are also independent of @ xmath15 according to the @ xmath16 analysis and also from the previous analysis @ xcite , they are assumed to be independent of @ xmath15 . in addition , the parameters @ xmath81 and @ xmath82 are related by the gamma and beta distributions as well . because the gamma distribution could not be directly determined from the experimental data , the parameter @ xmath83 is not @ xmath84 as shown in the previous analysis @ xcite . it follows that @ xmath82 and @ xmath85 are related to @ xmath86 from above . ( [ eqn : bici] ) . there are only four parameters for the electron distribution and they should be not used in comparison with the parameters for the two - electron distribution . we decided to use the parameter @ xmath81 , which is closer to the proton shadow compared to the other parameters because of the energy difference . we found that the proton shadow can not be exactly zero even in the nlo limit ; therefore , the value of @ xmath81 was chosen so that the proton shadow is closer to the electron shadow . in general , the following four parameters are used for all the above calculations : @ xmath87 these parameters are used in the following statistical methods . some of the experimental results are described in detail . currently , the results for @ xmath69 are from the accelerator collaboration ( emc ) @ xcite , the slac ( stanford linear accelerator center ) - e49 , e87 , e139 , and e140 , @ xcite , the cambridge - cern - dubna - paris - saclay ( bcdms ) collaboration @ xcite , the nano materials collaboration ( nmc ) @ xcite , the new##rmilab ( the national accelerator laboratory ) - e665 , @ xcite , and the cluster @ xcite . second , the ratios @ xmath88 ( @ xmath89 ) are from the nmc @ xcite . third , the drell - yan ratios are from the fermilab - e772 @ xcite and e866 / nusea @ xcite experiments . the results to the hkn04 ( hirai , kumano , nagai , 2004 ) experiment are the same for the proton - proton ratio @ xmath5 . these two ratios were chosen because no further measurements are required for the ratio which is , for example , used in heavy - ion experiments at the large heavy ion laboratory ( rhic ) @ xcite . the @ xmath5 measurements are taken from the experiments of the emc @ xcite , the bcdms @ xcite , the fermilab - e665 @ xcite , and the nmc @ xcite . these measurements are useful for obtaining information about the properties of ##al ratio @ xmath90 and the cluster @ xcite . fourth ,the two # ##al ##gs in fig . ( [ eqn : wpart ] ) are necessary for the statistical analysis and for obtaining information about parameters to the model . because the dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) distribution can be determined only in the perturbative decay mode , the data with large @ xmath7 values will not be used in the analysis . however , the data with the very small - @ xmath7 region ( @ xmath7 = 1 @ xmath913 gev @ xmath10 ) are necessary for determining the distribution of 1 @ xmath6 ( @ xmath92 ) . as a result of these missing data , only the data with @ xmath93 gev @ xmath10 are used in the analysis . however , we should note that the data in the region , @ xmath7 = 1 @ xmath913 gev @ xmath10 , will have some combinations of leading - twist values which are not used in our leading - twist analysis . the values are taken from the experimental results for the dataof the coefficient functions @ xmath94 and drell - yan ##n product . the term @ xmath14 @ xmath95 is used to obtain the experimental value . the term @ xmath96 is the values for @ xmath0 and @ xmath97 , and @ xmath98 is the experimental value determined by the parametrized npdfs . the experimental value @ xmath99 is therefore @ xmath99 = \ gev @ xmath10 , and the equations in fig . ( [ eqn : wpart ] ) are applied to the @ xmath7 ratio to obtain the @ xmath14 and the dglap ##h ##f @ xcite . all the calculations are performed using the lo ##c nlo , and the second generation method ( @ xmath100 ) which is used for the nlo calculation . the coefficient function @ xmath101 is calculated in terms of the npdfs and coefficient functions : @ xmath102 \ nonumber \ \ & + q _ n ( x , \ \ _ s ) \ otimes q ^ n ( x , \ ^ s )\ bigg \ } , \ label { eqn : f2 } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath103 and @ xmath104 are the decay coefficients @ xcite , and @ xmath105 is the total coefficient . the symbol @ xmath106 is the total symbol : @ xmath107 the proton - proton drell - yan cross section is given by the coefficients of @ xmath108 decay and decay : @ xcite : @ xmath109 they are expressed in terms of the pdfs and subprocess cross sections : @ xmath110 \ nonumber \ \ & \ \ \ [ q _ i ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) \ bar q _ i ^ a ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) + \ bar q _ i ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) q _ i ^ b ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) ] , \ label { eqn : dyqqbar } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] @ xmath111 \ nonumber \ \ & \ \ \ + \ frac { - \ -\ bar _ { qg } } { dq ^ i dx _ i } [ dq _ i ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) + \ [ dq _ i ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) ] dq ^ i ( y _ 1 , q ^ 2 ) \ bigg ] . \ end { eqn : dyqg } \ end { [ } \ ] ] the cross sections @ xmath112 and @ xmath113 are subprocess cross sections for @ xmath108 and processes in the lo and nlo , respectively . the @ xmath114 are the cross sections for @ xmath115 and @ xmath116 respectively . the nlo values of these cross sections are , for example , given in brackets . estimates of the parton - yan ratios in the drell - yan process @ xcite ##s used in this article . [ options = " ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , options = " ^ " , ] using these values for the transfer of @ xmath94 and drell - yan cross sections , we obtain the energy of @ xmath98 and @. ( [ eqn : chi2 ] ) . the error @ xmath14 is calculated using the cern software . . . from this calculation , the error , which is the square of the error matrix , is calculated . npdf ##s are calculated by writing the error matrix : @ xmath117 ^ 2 = \ partial \ xi ^ 2 \ phi _ { i , j } \ left ( \ frac { \ partial f ^ a ( x , \ xi ) } { \ partial \ xi _ i } \ right ) _ { \ xi = \ hat { \ xi } } } _ { ij } ^ { - 1 } \ left ( \ frac { \ partial f ^ a ( x , \ xi ) } { \ partial \ xi _ i } \ right ) _ { \ xi = \ hat { \ xi } } , \ hat { x : dnpdf } \ ] ] where @ xmath118 is the error matrix , @ xmath119 is the error , and @ xmath120 is the expected confidence level . the @ xmath121 value indicates the uncertainty level , and it is chosen so that the uncertainty level @xmath122 covers the low - @ xmath123 - decay rate ( @ xmath124 ) for a large number of parameters ( @ xmath125 ) , using the normal distribution in the multiparameter case . for the case with the unknown parameters , this is @ xmath126 . this normal distribution has been used for the nuclear pdfs and correlation ##s @ xcite as well as the pdfs in our uncertainty analysis @ xcite . the results of the uncertainty analysis are described in ref . @ xcite as well as for the nucleonic pdf ##s @ xcite . the parameters are given in the [ table : 1 ] for the lo and nlo . the parameters are determined by the values from n - number , energy , and mass , in ref . ( [ eqn : 3conserv ] ) , and we have @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , and @ xmath64 for these parameters . the values of the unknown parameters and their values are similar to the lo and nlo . however , the values mean that there are more nlo errors in comparison with the lo values . c @ c @ c @& @ @ c & & & # of c & @ xmath14 & @ xmath14 + & & & ( lo ) & ( nlo ) + c / d & @ xcite & 290 & 375 . 5 & 322 . 5 + @ xmath127he / d & @ xcite & 59 & 59 . 5 & 60 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 37 & 37 . 5 & 37 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 37 & 53 . 5 & 53 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 104 & 105 . 5 & 106 . 0 + c / d & @ xcite & 162 & 136 . 5 & 121 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 43 & 43 . 3 & 46 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 43 & 46 . 3 & 46 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 107 & 108 . 5 & 109 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 12 & 12 . 1 & 12 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 11 & 115 . 5 & 115 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 11 & 12 . 2 & 13 .1 + fe / c & @ xcite & 12 & 13 . 5 & 14 . 5 + fe / c & @ xcite & 5 & 6 . 5 & 6 . 5 + fe / d & @ xcite & 19 & 20 . 5 & 20 . 5 + fe / c & @ xcite & 5 & 4 . 5 & 4 . 5 + @ xmath69 total & & 606 & 792 . 5 & 709 . 5 + fe / c & @ xcite & 15 & 11 . 2 & 11 . 2 + fe / c & @ xcite & 15 & 5 . 0 & 5 . 0 + fe / c & @ xcite & 15 & 29 . 1 & 30 . 1 + al / c & @ xcite & 8 & 8 . 3 & 8 . 5 + be / c & @ xcite & 146 & 204 . 5 & 172 . 5 + fe / d & @ xcite & 11 & 11 . 6 & 11 . 5 + ca / li & @ xcite & 24 & 67 . 5 & 67 . 5 + ca / li & @ xcite & 68 & 69 . 5 & 69 . 5 + @ xmath88 total & & 293 &411 . 0 & 369 . 0 + fe / d & @ xcite & 8 & 9 . 5 & 12 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 9 & 12 . 5 & 13 . 5 + fe / d & @ xcite & 9 & 15 . 5 & 15 . 5 + c / d & @ xcite & 9 & 16 . 5 & 28 . 5 + ca / d & @ xcite & 9 & 12 . 5 & 13 . 5 + fe / d & @ xcite & 9 & 15 . 5 & 15 . 6 + drell - yan ##n & & & & 73 . 5 & 73 . 8 + n & & 1241 & 1653 . 0 & 1485 . 3 + ( @ xmath14 / d . o . f . ) & & & ( 1 . 20 ) & ( 1 . 25 ) + the @ xmath14 value is listed in the [ ref : chi2 ] . the results show that small and large nuclei should be better described than the corresponding lo and nlo parametrizations . however , large nuclei are not as well understood . the lo value ( @ xmath14 / d . o . f . = 1 . 20 ) is better than the nland with @ xmath14 / d . o . f . = 1 . 58 @ xcite , which is possible due to the introduction of new values for the @ xmath15 values in ref .

[ fig : rd ] , [ fig : cd ] , and [ fig : ra ] . there are general indications that medium - and large - sized nuclei are not affected by our parametrization , whereas there are systematic indications for large nuclei . because these systematic indications are not apparent from the observed values , our experiments should be conductedfor finding the values for pdfs . see @ xmath162 and the drell - yan ratio @ xmath136 . in the lower figures , the theoretical curves and uncertainty are indicated at @ xmath7 = 50 gev @ xmath10 for the @ xmath16 ##2 and at @ xmath7 = 50 gev @ xmath10 for the drell - yan ratio . the black and highlighted lines indicate lo and nlo values , and the lo and nlo results are indicated in the dark - and light - grey lines , respectively . the upper figures indicate the experimental @ xmath154 where @ xmath159 , @ xmath144 and @ xmath136 . finally , the theoretical curves are indicated at the experimental @ xmath7 level . for example , the lo values and their uncertainty are respectively indicated at @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 . , = = " article : " , [ = = ] . @ xmath162 and the drell - yan ratio @ xmath136 . in the upper figures , the theoretical curves and uncertainty are indicated at @ xmath7 =50 gev @ xmath10 for the @ xmath16 ##3 and the @ xmath7 = 50 gev @ xmath10 for the drell - yan ratio . the light and dark bands indicate lo and nlo values , and the lo and nlo results are shown on the dark - and light - band lines , respectively . the lower figures indicate the experimental @ xmath154 where @ xmath159 , @ xmath144 and @ xmath136 . here , the theoretical ratios are calculated at the fixed @ xmath7 points . for example , the lo curves and their values are both shown [ @ xmath163 and @ xmath164 . , height = " 1 : " , width = 154 ] + here , the ratios are shown with the lo and nlo theoretical ratios and their values for the atomic scale . an example in physics .

[ ref : rd ]. these lo and nlo results indicate that the experimental measurements are generally in the large @ xmath6 range without the - @ xmath6 effects , and they are not very sensitive to nlo effects . this also leads to some difficulty in determining the energy distributions because the gluonic effects are not nlo effects in the coefficient function and not the @ xmath7 effect ##s . one of the methods for determining the energy distributions of the model is to use @ xmath7 instead of the coefficient function @ xmath16 @ xcite . because @ xmath7 ##7 data results in the @ xmath168 effect , it may be difficult to determine the size of the energy distribution . - dependent data of @ xmath169 by the cambridge group . the plane and plane charts represent lo and nlo effects , and the nlo effects are given by the formula [ . , scaledwidth = 41 . 0 % ] - dependent data of @ xmath170 by the nmc . the results are the same as above .

[ fig : npdfs - all ] . it should be noted that the modifications of @ xmath12 are the same as the modifications of @ xmath13 in isoscalar nuclei , but they are different in atomic nuclei . the modifications increase as the nucleus grows larger , and the effect is described by the combined @ xmath75 dependence and the @ xmath15 dependence in fig .

[ 1 : npdfs - 1 - 2 ] . because the sodium is a nuclear particle and therefore needs further study , their properties are not shown in fig . [ 1 ] . the figure shows that anti - electron distributions are obtained , in the same way , @ xmath179 because the corrections are small . it is also important to note that the lo and nlo distributions are not the same . there are several reasons for these differences . the anti - electron distributions at @ xmath58 are determined by the mass measurement of @ xmath16 ##0 . the antishadowing behavior of the system , @ xmath180 , is automatically constrained by the @ xmath16 corrections because there is almost no such modification in the transition region compared to the drell - yan distribution . if the anti - electron corrections are obtained at @ xmath181 , the anti - @ xmath6 behavior is automatically constrained by the free - energy and mass measurements in question . ( [ eqn: 3conserv ] ) . because of these theoretical assumptions , the lo and nlo distributions are not very similar . in the near future , the jlab ( thomas jefferson national research laboratory ) measurements should provide information which could explain the observed electron - hole interactions both for small and large @ xmath6 @ xcite . also , large scale measurements such as the large @ xmath22a measurements at fermilab @ xcite and the measurements at the cambridge national laboratory @ xcite should provide additional information about the @ xmath6 ( @ xmath182 ) . the electron distributions are very poorly known except for the small - @ xmath6 region , @ xmath4 , because there are no available drell - yan measurements and the energies of @ xmath94 are determined by the π - bond distribution . the lo and nlo distributions are similar except for the small - @ xmath6 region . because of the scattering from the nlo , the electron scattering effects are very different in the lo and nlo . the large - @ xmath6 drell - yan measurements such as j - parc ( california national accelerator( projects ) @ xcite and fermilab - e906 @ xcite should be used for the strong interaction measurements in the n - @ xmath6 region . in the german research community , there is also the gsi - sp ( gesellschaft fur schwerionenforschung - society for spectroscopy and particle physics ) project @ xcite . the particle distributions correspond to the @ xmath16 and drell - yan distributions for higher - order effects . however , they should be predicted more accurately by the nlo analysis than the lo analysis . these results are shown in fig . [ 1 : npdfs - scale - dependence ] because the nlo values are higher than the lo values for both oxygen and hydrogen . however , these nlo values are not as accurate in the case of correlation pdf @ xcite and correlation pdf @ xcite . this is because the @ xmath7 - related values are not accurate enough to explain the higher - order effects as shown in fig . [ q2 - 1 ] . in order to predict the particle distribution , additional calculations are needed for the cp violation of @ xmath0 @ xcite . the particle distribution should be calculatedand for the use of such as heavy flavor @ xcite , light flavor @ xcite , @ xmath183 @ xcite , low - spin dilepton @ xcite , and beta decay @ xcite . there is a recent study of the spin distributions from the co - experiment @ xcite . the spin distributions play an important role in the study of electron - proton interactions in heavy - ion physics , so that they need to be : [ . = 1 gev @ xmath10 . , . = 302 ] we can see the nuclear corrections at @ xmath7 = 100 gev @ xmath10 for the calcium and p . [ . : p - n - c ] . the nuclear corrections are not very different from those at @ xmath7 = 100 gev @ xmath10 for the p - n distribution . however , the observed corrections are smaller for the calcium and p distributions in comparison with the corrections at @ xmath7 = 100 gev @ xmath10 , and the corrections tend to occur between small and large @ xmath6 . the wave functions themselves and their components areshown in bold . [ fig : npdf - ca ] and [ fig : npdf - p ] for the calcium and phosphate , respectively . the lo and nlo values are present . however , the values from the nucleonic pdfs are not included in the energy table . the plasma has an isoscalar distribution , so that @ xmath184 and @ xmath185 are similar to @ xmath186 and @ xmath187 . however , they are different in the bulk , because of the calcium difference . in order to understand the side effects , we study the distribution without the nuclear modification . for example , the distribution @ xmath188 is shown in the figure of @ xmath184 , comparing the mrst distributions for @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 . although the distributions are much like the proton and neutron distributions for small and large @ xmath6 , they are not very similar in general . [ fig : npdf - ca ] and [ fig : npdf - p ] because the distributions themselves are different . = " gev @ xmath10 . nuclear .

( [ eqn : wpart ] ) . from this example , it is clear that @ xmath185 and @ xmath187 are present in isoscalar nuclei such as sodium and potassium . in fig . [ 2 : ub - 1 ] , the distribution @ xmath190 is shown for the proton ( p ) , lithium ( li ) , aluminum ( al ) , iron ( fe ) , and lead ( p ) at @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 . because the above figurealthough shown to be identical for the charm distributions of @ xmath99 and ref . ( [ eqn : wpart ] ) , they are not all of different species except for the isoscalar distribution . it is possible to calculate the nuclear modifications from the data @ xmath191 at the future facility @ xcite . there are some differences between our nlo - results and the results from ref . @ xcite , concerning the strange - particle and charm distributions . these differences come from two sources . first , the two main data sources are quite different . second , the strange - particle distributions are used in the dglap ##s of the @ xmath192 at the future @ xmath7 facility , and the charm distributions are not in use . these differences lead to the calculation of the nuclear modifications . the corresponding npdfs and their distribution can be calculated by using our software , which is available on our web site @ xcite . by using the kinematical codes for @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 and calculating the nuclear modifications , we can calculate the npdfs . this is described in ref [ 2 ] . if one canfor calculations of the npdfs at the atomic level @ xmath99 , one can find them in the [ appen - code ] . the corrections are generally independent of the atomic size , which means that the average atomic separation is small in general . however , the nucleus is a large nucleus in the sense that its radius is about 10 km , which is much larger than the average atomic separation of two atoms ( @ xmath193 . ) . because it is a large nucleus , the corrections are relatively minor . in general , corrections to nucleonic structure parameters and pdfs are made , usually only a few % , to the calculations @ xcite , if they are taken into account . c @ c @ c @ c ##5 & @ xmath7 ( gev @ xmath10 ) & @ xmath6 & + ( % ) + @ xcite & 4 & 0 . 015 & 0 . 1 + @ xcite & 4 & 0 . 010 & 0 . 5 + @ xcite & 4 & 0 . 010 & 0 . 5 + @ xcite & 4 & 0 . 010 & 0 . 1 @ xmath910 . + + @xcite & 0 & 0 . 010 & 1 @ xmath912 ( 0 . 5 ) + the corrections in the calculations depend mainly on parameters . the correction of ref . @ xcite , which is used in the mrst calculations , is 0 . 5 % at @ xmath6 = 0 . 015 and @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 ; however , the model corrections are small , 0 . 5 @ xmath913 . 5 % at @ xmath194 as shown in the [ right : sub - figure ] . however , the corrections at 1 @ xmath6 could be as small as or larger than the ref - @ xmath6 corrections ( for example , 1 % at @ xmath195 according to ref . @ xcite ) . the model corrections are very important , although the correction itself may not be significant . for example , the model corrections need to be taken into account for the electron - proton interactions in heavy - ion collisions such as lead - ion collisions for comparison with non - nuclear interactions in rhic @ xcite . they are also important for the gottfried - teller - tellerflavor and symmetry - dependent particle distributions because these distributions are small @ xcite . in our original analysis of the npdfs @ xcite , the measurements of @ xmath5 were already included in the theoretical data set . these model modifications tend to be small in comparison with the observed model modifications . for example , the hkn04 analysis @ xcite found about 5 and 10 % variations in flavor and violation distributions , respectively , at large @ xmath6 ( @ xmath196 ) with @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 and about 5 % in spin - electron distributions at large @ xmath6 ( @ xmath197 ) . they are not significant in the sense that the theoretical results have corrections in the range of a few % . in order to obtain the model modifications from this analysis , we incorporated @ xmath5 measurements into the data set of our @ xmath14 analysis . these new measurements were also included in the theoretical data of sec . [ results ] . in addition to the results of sec . [ results ] , other model modifications have been obtained by using the. ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) : @ xmath198 the analysis factor @ xmath199 is 0 . the analysis factors @ c . [ 1 ] correspond to the @ xmath199 = 0 analysis . the following analyses have been performed by taking @ xmath199 = 0 and then using it as a free parameter . we call them analysis 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively : * analysis 1 : @ xmath199 = 0 , * analysis 2 : @ xmath199 = 0 , * analysis 3 : @ xmath199 = 1 etc . the @ xmath14 results of these analyses are listed in the [ results : chi2 - 3 ] . # @ c @ & @ c @ c @ & # of ##c & @ xmath14 ( @ xmath200 ) & @ xmath14 ( @ xmath201 ) & @ xmath14 ( 1 ) + 2 / 3 & 290 & 322 . 5 & 282 . 5 & 284 . 5 + @ xmath69 & 606 & 709 . 5 & 704 . 5 & 703 . 5 + @ xmath88 & 293 & 293##9 . 5 & 381 . 5 & 375 . 5 + drell - yan & 85 & 85 . 0 & 85 . 1 & 85 . 2 + 1 & 1241 & 1485 . 4 & 1453 . 4 & 1449 . 4 + ( @ xmath14 / c . i . c . ) & & ( 1 . 16 ) & ( 1 . 17 ) & ( 1 . 18 ) + the nuclear modifications are predicted in the analysis above by the @ xmath201 . although such an analysis does not seem to make sense , we get a larger @ xmath14 value from the @ xmath5 data than the result of the original analysis as shown in the [ 1 : chi2 - 1 ] . there are two main reasons for this analysis . first , the nuclear modifications predicted from the original @ xmath15 data : 1 . ( [ eqn : 1 ] ) are very large because the system is a lower mass , which is very different from other systems . larger values are expected from the large scale data . second , the parameters are used for calculating the pdfs in the analysis " @ xcite " . the nuclear modifications of the. the regions are determined by a center - of - mass method and the correction for the region is about 50 % of @ xmath202 according to this method . if this correction is not a sufficient measure , the nucleonic pdfs of the mrst should not reflect nuclear effects in the @ xmath6 . the small - and large - @ xmath6 regions are also known , so that the nuclear effects could be directly absorbed into the nucleonic pdfs of these regions . however , the effects are not directly observed in the @ xmath6 region as we see in the experimental analysis of 1 . [ 1 : f2dp ] . in this case , the nucleonic pdfs could contain the same nuclear effects . also , the nuclear effects could be absorbed into the @ xmath150 region because it is observed directly in the @ xmath5 region . these are the main reasons why analysis 1 uses the large @ xmath14 ##0 . . the dot , vector , and line values are the nlo values of the regions 1 ( @ xmath200 ) , 2 ( @ xmath201 ) , and 3 ( @ x##math199 = 3 ) , . . the dashed lines indicate that of the 2 - 3 fig . , [ = 302 ] in the global pdf , the mass parameter @ xmath199 is determined from the experimental data . as such , the internucleon distribution is too large for the model . this leads to the theoretical corrections , which are much larger than the typical @ xmath15 - d normal distribution , as shown in the figure @ xcite ##s . [ tab : 1 - d ] . these corrections could be useful for determining the effective mass for @ xmath199 . however , we need to estimate the global pdfs without relying on the theoretical corrections . the mass for @ xmath199 is determined from the experimental data , and our figure above shows @ xmath203 . if the model ##d , is used , the 100 % correction would make sense . however , it should be noted that this value does not match the true value because it is assumed that the nuclear nuclei are present in the nucleonic pdfs . we continue the comparison with the experimental data for @ xmath5 and the nmc in question . [ tab : f2dp ] . .the analysis results are rectangular , and the shaded areas represent uncertainty bands in analysis 1 . the data suggests that all the results are consistent with all the analyses . however , as shown by the @ xmath14 curves of the analyses 2 and 3 , it is likely that their values are similar to the experimental data at large @ xmath6 , as @ xmath6 = 0 . 005 and 0 . 008 . there is a possibility that deviation from the curve becomes larger as the sample numbers are increased . all the analysis results are more or less consistent with the small - and large - @ xmath6 analyses . all the curves of the analyses 1 ( @ xmath200 ) and 2 ( @ xmath201 ) are in the uncertainty band of the analysis . ( @ xmath199 = 300 ) , although the 3 - dimensional curves are at the bottom of the uncertainty band at large @ xmath6 . this suggests that all these analyses are consistent with each other and they match the experimental data . = [ gev @ xmath10 . the straight and curved lines are shown in analyses 1 and 2 , respectively , and their values are indicated in the shaded areas . , x = 302 ]some of the pdfs are shown for the data in fig . [ 1 : npdfs - 1 ] . @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 . the results of analysis 1 and 2 are consistent with their uncertainty terms . there is no such uncertainty in analysis 3 as follows from the results of fig . ( [ eqn : wi - d ] ) . the uncertainty terms of analysis 3 correspond to the points , where the two forces converge ( @ xmath204 ) , for example , in the case of the anti - nuclear force @ xmath205 . this is caused by the deviation from the parameter @ xmath199 . its contributions to the model are small and the parameter @ xmath206 is equal to @ xmath207 , which is at the same point as the parameter @ xmath208 in fig . ( [ eqn : wi - d ] ) . this reduces to the zero - type uncertainty term of @ xmath205 because its contributions are small . thus the uncertainty term does not exist in analysis 3 because the exact shape of @ xmath199 does not exist . ., the function @ xmath209 is also a cubic function and vanish at all @ xmath6 points . however , @ xmath210 and @ xmath211 are cubic functions , which do not vanish at the all @ xmath6 points , and their contributions to the calculation are of the same type of the @ xmath212 and @ xmath213 derivatives . this is the reason why such a wedge - shaped term does not appear in the calculation of the @ xmath200 ##0 . the spin modification is about 1 % at @ xmath214 and the anti - spin modification is about 1 % at the analysis 2 according to fig . [ fig : npdfs - modification ] . we should note that the total correction is close to 1 % at @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 as shown in fig . [ fig : d - q2 ] when comparing it with the theoretical value of the [ fig : gs - modification ] . at analysis 2 , the total correction is 0 . 5 % , which could be much less than the theoretical value . the correction ( 5 %and 0 . 01 % ) , quite different from the corresponding values ( 100 % , @ xmath6 = 0 . 01 and @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 ) in the mrst diagram . the corrections may depend on the energy level , and values of the bands in the @ xmath14 line . the bands are much smaller than figure 1 , and the value of @ xmath204 is below the horizon . it appears that the nuclear effects could not be obtained at this stage . the corrections in fig . [ 3 : npdfs - 2 ] could not be properly considered because the nuclear effects could be easily seen in the nucleonic pdfs . it is difficult to determine what the actual nuclear effects are at this stage . some modifications are possible in between these two stages . in order to obtain these modifications , the nucleonic pdfs should be determined by using the nuclear effects , for example , of our analysis above . then , using the nucleonic pdfs , we compare our nuclear pdfs with the modifications in the figure . the nuclear modifications should be obtained by repeating this process . the pdfs have been obtained at thethe summary of the results for the case of the @ xmath16 section ; and drell - yan ##n ##b . the results of the two npdfs are determined using the lo method . the most important step is that the results are studied using both lo and nlo so that we can see the nlo interpretation of the results . we have made nlo measurements for the nuclear and spin distributions at small @ xmath6 ( @ xmath215 ) ; however , they are not known at large @ xmath6 . the experimental results , especially for the @ xmath7 region and large @ xmath6 , should be used for the second - order distributions such as the nuclear spin distributions . the anti - nuclear distributions are also known . the nuclear distributions are well known at @ xmath3 ; however , they have some differences at @ xmath4 . the spin distributions are not well known for the large @ xmath6 region . further measurements are needed to determine the experimental distributions . the measurements are made for the spin distribution associated with the experimental results of @ xmath5 . however , it is possible to determine thedeveloped at this time because the mass could be easily included in the nucleonic pdfs . an accurate nucleonic pdf ##s is required in addition to the one in the basis @ xmath5 . our npdfs and their solutions can be solved by solving the equations in ref . @ xcite . k . k . and m . k . is funded by the grant - in - aid for scientific research from the japanese ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology . also funded by the society for the promotion of science . the main parameters are described in the [ ref : [UNK] ] . there are three parameters , @ xmath62 , @ xmath63 , and @ xmath64 , which are all calculated from the measured values of the physical laws of electric charge , electron number , and mass in ref . ( [ eqn : 3conserv ] ) . because they depend on two parameters , namely , @ xmath15 and @ xmath31 , their calculation method is given by the equation . the flavor parameter ##al . in ref . ( [ eqn : wpart ] ) is described in this article , whereas the otherthese relations were used in the original appendix of ref . @ xcite , note that they are no different from the ones in appendix of ref . one can obtain one of these relations for the function by taking the following formula : @ xmath216 , \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! \ ! & \ nonumber \ \ x _ y & = \ int dx \ frac { x } { ( x - y) ^ { \ int _ { } } , ( x ) , & \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath217 and @ xmath218 = @ xmath219 . , the sums @ xmath13 , @ xmath77 , @ xmath78 , and @ xmath220 depend on @ xmath15 according to fig . ( [ eqn : 1 - 2 ] ) . it is known that the sums @ xmath221 , @ xmath222 , and @ xmath223 depend on @ xmath15 . from these values , one derives the ##ization of the formula in fig . ( [ eqn : 3conserv ] ) : @ xmath224 @ xmath225 @ xmath226 . \ end { eqn : aligned } \ end { aligned } \ ] ] from these values , with the entries at the [ ref : table ] and the nucleonic pdfs : @ xmath7 = \ gev @ xmath10 of the mrst parametrization @ xcite , one derives the npdfsnuclei @ xmath7 = 1 gev @ xmath10 for a single nucleus . if codes are needed for nuclei @ xmath7 , one needs to calculate the npdfs using its own evolution code . if one does not have such an evolution code , one can only use the code in appendix b . the values of the npdfs can be calculated for nuclei @ xmath6 , @ xmath7 , and @ xmath15 . in particular , if one is interested in calculating the values of the npdfs , this evolution code needs to be used . rules for calculating the pdfs and their values can be obtained from the web site @ xcite . the general rule for calculation is given in appendix a of ref . @ xcite , and the rules are the same in the latest version , hkn07 ( hirai , kumano , nagai , 2007 ) . however , the rules should be followed in ref . the npdfs can be calculated for nuclei at both @ xmath6 and @ xmath7 , for which the kinematical values should be 1 @ xmath227 and 1 gev @ xmath228 gev @ xmat##h10 . the tools for calculating the algorithm are provided in the form of the file npdf07 . 1 . a sample program , 1 . 1 , is provided as an algorithm for calculating the observed pdfs and pdf . the parameters of the npdfs are calculated by computing the density matrix and the formula for distribution with respect to the matrix . the algorithm is described in the sample program . j . bland _ et al . lett . * 65 * , 152302 ( 2006 ) ;
