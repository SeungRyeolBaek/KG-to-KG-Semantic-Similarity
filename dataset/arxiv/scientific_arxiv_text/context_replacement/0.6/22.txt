the very nearly # ##ness of variable stars in red dwarf galaxies provides important insights to the star formation history of these systems . some of these variable stars can provide new distance estimates for the observed system , others can provide new data for the theoretical models . different types of stars will also improve the understanding of the star formation history of these systems , serving as indicators of star formation during long periods . we found the data collection of our long period galaxy project to be particularly well suited to studying the contents of the long - period galaxies and to re - examine the contents of cepheids with @ xmath1 , as reported by sandage & carlson ( 1985 ) . we studied a group of young local red dwarf elliptical galaxies which are observed with the 1 . 5 m telescope of our telescope at ucla . the data and the data from the literature compiled by mateo ( 1998 ) are summarized in table 1 . . names , total star counts , the @ xmath2 - day estimates in years , and the distance estimates in kpc for the individual galaxies studied in our study . the data are taken from the literature compiled by mateo ( 1995 ) . for comparison , the data are from the work of lopez et . al ( 2002 ) and from this project . [[ = " < , < , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ " , ] @ xmath3 this . the observations so far were carried out in @ xmath4 and @ xmath2 - band , each over a 3 year period , with additional observations in 1999 . this version of the data set should be suitable for long period variable stars with periods up to @ xmath5 days . the observations in @ xmath4 , @ xmath2 and @ xmath6 - band were conducted during 3 year periods with the 1 . 5 m telescope at calar alto over populated 3 - year time periods . these observations should provide the basis for the sensitivity for variable stars with orbital periods ranging from @ xmath7 days up to @ xmath8 days . the resulting images were # ##ed , re - scanned and gamma rays scanned . first , the images from each night were astrometrically stacked to a deep reference frame and scanned with sample sizes up to their @ xmath9 . for each night , out of all the available images of a single night , a new image against a single deep reference frame was created . statistical analysis ( gssl & riffeser , 2002 , 2003 ) of thealard algorithm ( alard & lupton , 1998 ) . then , these difference values are combined with the reference coordinates . to extract lightcurves from the stellar images , determine which pixels differ most ( @ xmath10 ) from the reference images . a certain number of pixels @ xmath11 are selected , allowing the efficient per - pixel error correction of our image processing algorithms . then , using these pixels as input , images and other information are extracted from the reference images and the lightcurve data is processed . to account for the variations in the observed light intensity , the lomb ( 1976 ) algorithm and the algorithm from scargle ( 1982 ) were used . the data analysis was done using the hst algorithm developed by schulte - ladbeck et al . for the instruments leo a , and ugca b , we had done very little analysis and a large amount of the data went through the computer . the leo a data set served as the baseline : a total of 20 different variable types were identified . among them , we identified three different long period variables ( on average , @ xmath12 , and @ xmath13 , [ and ] @ xmath14 ) ,and we found two new candidates for lpvs . in addition we were able to find two new candidates for @ xmath0 cephei stars with a mean periods of 1 . 5 and 1 . 5 days . the latter candidate was first identified by dolphin et al . ( 2002 ) as c2 - v58 with a period of 6 . 5 days . the dolphin et al . model also fails in finding a new lightcurve with our data , however , applying our new method to their data set yields similar results . the two new lightcurves for the two @ xmath0 cephei stars are shown in figure 1 . the apparent phase diagram shown in the left corner of figure 1 is based upon the hst data obtained by dolphin et al . ( 1996 ) and schulte - ladbeck et al . represented by the diagram shows those candidates from our data that fall within the hst point of view , one @ xmath0 cephei stars in the variable regime ( arcs ) and the other for long period variables ( leo ) in the direction of the brown dwarf . dolphin et al . ( 1996 ) based upon arc - period data gave a mean period for the ##s of c .2000 and a mean diameter of 690 kpc ( see also schulte - ladbeck et al . ) . this result was further confirmed by the search for long period variables with the wiyn survey of 10 million years , c . 2000 ( dolphin et al . our observations supported this dataset for short periods . the right hand side of figure 1 shows the period - ##osity ( pl ) relation of the smc similar to the one measured by dolphin et al . the long period variables measured by dolphin agree with the same pl relation . the overplotted data for the other cepheids from our survey ( 2004 ) support this relation even in the case of short periods . we published the results for our search for variable stars in a number of g - type dwarf galaxies . for the leo a dwarf galaxy , the best known one so far , we have had a list of 22 candidates for it , 10 of these were long period variables and 4 @ xmath0 cephei ##ds . we compared the results with the period - # relation and the long period variables measured by dolphin et al . we concluded , that our cepheids have supported their results and the new distance estimate for leo a . this result was published .in comparison with the trgb group ( schmidt et al . , schulte - ladbeck et al . ) . the position of the lpvs in the high - mass group suggests that most of them are likely red giant branch stars . although a complete picture of these first magnitude stars is lacking for most of the two group stars , a rough estimate of their age will allow the determination of the star formation rate on the scale of 1 gyr - - below the extreme metalicity limit due to mass - loss effects . we want to thank drs . a . drozdovsky , m . maraston , j . m . schulte - ladbeck , and m . schmidt for their assistance . we appreciate the contributions of the calar ##co and wendelstein groups . j . fliri and j . riffeser carry out most of our work . the list is supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ##s ##n 1812 / 3 - 1 and ho 1812 / 3 - 2 . alard , j . & lupton , c . m . , , 503 , 325 smith , r . m . et al . 2002 , , 123 , 3154 gssl j . h .& riffeser a . 2002 , , 381 , 1095 gssl , j . a . & riffeser , a . 2003 , , conf . 295 , 229 lomb j . a . 1976 , , 37 , 447 mateo j . a . 1998 , , 37 , 435 sandage , j . & carlson , j . 1985 , , 37 , 1464 scargle j . a . 1982 , , 263 , 835 schulte - ladbeck a . et al . 2002 , , 124 , 896 garcia a . et al . 1996 , , 116 , 1244
