the statistical mechanics of pure systems and prominently the study of phase transitions and their associated surface phenomena has been the subject of more intensive research in recent years . the phase laws for pure systems ( the generalized phase law , wulff law , etc . ) have been formulated on a more rigorous basis and , if necessary , supplemented with additional conditions for their existence . the surface phenomena of systems with many different phases , or phases , have long been well - studied at the level of theoretical physics . however , they have not received much mathematically rigorous treatment and in general have not been studied properly even from a theoretical perspective . the main goal is to use the results from statistical mechanics of pure systems to obtain a higher level of understanding for phase transitions in systems . this is especially important in view of the important role that the knowledge of these phenomena plays in sciences , both pure ( chemistry , biology , physics ) and applied ( physics , etc . ) . see e . g . @ xcite for further discussion . among the many very interesting aspects of phase transitions in pure systems is the spontaneous _ phase separation _ of water upon heating ( or boiling ) . a well - known example from ` ` marine life ' ' is the formation of a shrimp in deep sea water .however , two major physical phenomena are observed : 1 . absorption of _ all the light into the solution of salt / water that is present . no evidence of _ facetting _ at the salt - water boundary . this study also reported the following results : 2 . salt water freezing at temperatures lower than the freezing point of fresh water . this is the phenomenon of _ freezing / depression _ . this ( 1 ) is what ` ` defines ' ' the structure of sea ice and is therefore partly responsible for the number of physical phenomena that have been observed , see e . g . @ xcite . however , ( 2 ) are not limited to the salt - water boundary ; they are caused by the whole range of the so called _ non - polar _ properties . a discussion of the physical effects of freezing / depression of water , referred to as _ colligative _ , can be found in @ xcite . of course , on a physical level , the above results are far from reliable . first , ( 1 ) results from the observation that , generally , the liquid phase is a more favorable environment for freezing than the solid phase . and ( 2 ) results from observation that the solution of salt has the entropic effect of freezing at theenergy - momentum coupling moves the freezing point to a higher temperature . finally , in figure ( 12 ) we see that , due to the crystal structure of ice , the ice - water surface tension must be constant . therefore , to describe the structure of ice water , the wulff equation has to be used with the assumption that only the liquid phase is at the surface . in essence , what is causing these phenomena is a phase transition followed by the collapse of the crystal structure . in the case of complex systems , these phenomena have been well studied at the level of theoretical physics for quite some time @ xcite and , indeed ( as seen on the planck time scale ) , also at the level of existence both in lower @ xcite and higher @ xcite systems . the aim of this and the other papers is to study the microscopic nature of liquids ( crystals ) in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics . however , a very realistic model of ice water / ice water is far from that of theoretical physics . ( in fact , even in complex systems , the structure of crystals is so complex that crystalization in complex systems has never been and only recently been observed in computer simulations @ xcite . ) so we must return to thea system in which one and more phases of matter are represented as discrete discrete particles located at boundaries of a probability distribution . for these conditions we see that phase separation is the non - volatile _ part _ of the potential in the system , a situation not unlike the classical case where phase separation can occur only at a fixed value ( say , the _ temperature ) of the system temperature . the boundaries _ of the phase - separation region can be easily calculated and shown to correspond with the exact values of the above equations in the physical - chemical domain . the result constitutes the basis of the following paper . in the following paper @ xcite we can show that , for small salt concentrations and varying with the size of the system , phase separation can still occur even in the event that a non - trivial part of the solution completely disappears ( bubbles ) to form a solid ( liquid ) . under these conditions the amount of water dissolved is proportional to the _ size _ of the system which implies that the probability of boiling - point formation is not a net effect . on a practical level , all of the above equations should apply to the non - volatile phase and the conditions when the system bubbles ( or disappears ) . however , in this and the following papers wewe take the _ presence _ of _ water and refer to the solid phase of the system as ice , to the liquid phase as ice - water , and to the gas as water . our system will be described as the @ xmath0 - dimensional hypercubic system @ xmath1 . we will assume the ( approximate ) nearest - neighbor hamiltonian of the entire system : @ xmath2 where @ xmath3 denotes the _ poles ( often translated into the hamitonian ) , @ xmath4 and @ xmath5 are poles , @ xmath1 and @ xmath6 are a single set of sites . the variables @ xmath7 , @ xmath8 and @ xmath9 are the solid ( ice ) , liquid ( water ) and gas interactions , which all take place at @ xmath10 with the _ variables @ xmath11 occurring at each site @ xmath4 . we will assume that @ xmath12 is the _ presence of ice _ at @ xmath4 and , similarly , @ xmath8 the _ presence of water _ at @ xmath4 . since a single water molecule need not necessarily be in thewe say , it is appropriate to use the term @ xmath12 when referring to the physical interaction of the water in the case of @ xmath4 which is essentially an ice - liquid interaction , but we do not explicitly introduce such a term into our model . the other terms involved are all self - consistent : an interaction between two solid points , terms for neighboring liquid points ( we can expect these to be neutral ) , an energy term @ xmath13 for the direct interaction of salt and water at each site , and , finally , energy terms for salt and water . for convenience ( and convenience ) , there is no direct ice - water interaction , except for the general presence of at least one neutral ` ` ice ' ' at each site . the terms which could have been used are unnecessary due to the uncertainty . we must assume also that @ xmath14 , therefore that the salt - water interaction is the direct contribution of salt to the equilibrium state of water . this model is necessary and therefore only appropriate for the physical problem of boiling point determination . we say that , after considering the case , the hamiltonian equation would just as easily describe a system with constant point values . if we say , theand @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 indicate the presence of ice and of water at the @ xmath4 , respectively . the restriction @ xmath15 implies that _ something _ has to be present at @ xmath4 ( the concentration of salt in water is unknown ) ; what is more problematic is the restriction of @ xmath7 and @ xmath8 to only the real case , namely @ xmath16 . take it to say that the authors are confident ( e . g . , on the case of @ xcite ) that almost all the results of this paper can be generalized to the case of real variables . however , we do not make any specific theoretical assumptions ; much of this work will rely entirely on computer software which , strictly speaking , has not been proven to work for the real case . a similar situation applies , of course , to the real case . but , our restriction to @ xmath17 serves only to solve the problem ; almost all of our results will apply to the case when @ xmath9 depends on ( only ) real variables according to the _ a priori _ assumption . it is very easy to show that the ` ` ice - waterthe ' ' of the interaction hamiltonian corresponds to the corresponding ising spin system . on a mathematical basis , this is done by referring to the ising system @ xmath18 , which in terms of the spin system @ xmath19 . combining these into , we arrive at the interaction hamiltonian : @ xmath20 where the interaction states @ xmath21 and @ xmath22 are given by @ xmath23 we note that the interaction term above is usually expressed in terms of ` ` ' ' ' , and that @ xmath24 will have a well defined value as if @ xmath25 , which refers to the system being in spin - free form . ( however , the definition of this expression is due to the @ xmath13 . ) with the following approximation to these values , the corresponding hamitonian allows us to obtain the following differential equation . we refer the following discussion to the [ sec2 . 2 ] . the hamiltonian given above indicates the presence of change in the salt concentration . therefore , this makes _ _ _ the term which is of particular interest . indeed , in an ideal system it is possible that the salt concentration will , indeed , change itselfuntil the system reaches a transitional phase . at the end of the model given above it is shown that , using grand canonical equations , the relative concentrations can be explicitly calculated , the result is the ising magnet with equilibrium temperature @ xmath21 and magnetic field @ xmath26 , where @ xmath27 in this case , phase transition is related to the curve @ xmath28 , i . e . , a closed curve in the @ xmath29 - plane . however , as is well known @ xcite , not much insight into the nature of _ _ _ _ is to be gained by placing the ising magnet in an external field . however , if ( for example ) the boundary conditions , the @ xmath22 has a finite volume , the phase transition form which misses and reaches the allowed volume . the transition phase of @ xmath22 corresponds exactly with the \ ##ity of the system ; the allowed volume and the physical properties of the system depend on the values of the boundary conditions . the term ` ` salt ' ' of the grand canonical equation indicates that the ideal system in this case is the system with a given amount of salt per unit volume . ( the above equation uses terms fromthe grand canonical ensemble ; see section [ sec2 . 1 ] . ) this equation is much more complicated because , at the point of formation , the salt solution does not have the ` ` energy ' ' to be completely removed from the solution . it is clear that , once the desired concentration of salt is reached , the equilibrium states @ xmath30 . 1 of the equation the resulting quantity is called the salt concentration . as can be seen in section [ sec2 ] , in our ising - type model of the temperature - based system , changing the salt concentration only leads to _ the _ change _ in the ising equation . therefore , this allows for the _ amount _ of dependence of the external field @ xmath22 . thus , the relationship between the salt concentration and the external magnetic field would require a constant change of the concentration , even at pressure which would force a molecule ( or a particle , depending on the initial conditions ) into the solution . [ rem0 ] we begin by showing that , although the field @ xmath22 is completely invariant to pressure , it does to a certain extent play the role of temperature in that it determines the _ a priori _ degree of dependence of the system for both _ and _. . " the first phase diagram to appear was in the @ xmath31 - paper . the work which led to this allows for an interesting mathematical solution of our current problem . the starting point which basically comes down to the theory of spin - salt equilibrium is that for each ising spin , the gibbs energy of spin , i . e . , the gibbs energy distribution over salt configurations , depends only on the overall concentration and not on the direction of how the spin is rotated in the equilibrium . for solution of differential equations @ xmath32 , let @ xmath33 be the total partition function for the ising spins with fixed equilibrium concentration @ xmath34 . the total partition function @ xmath35 with fixed equilibrium concentration @ xmath36 can then be written as @ xmath37 where @ xmath38 is the sum of the total values of the total concentration which only depends on the ising configuration via the overall concentration @ xmath34over the salt configurations with concentration @ xmath36 . as before , the total values of the weights are those with the largest solution to the equation ##mation . let us test the general model above again .the is @ xmath39 ( which is @ xmath40 ) , i . e . , the original ising model at the time @ xmath22 . if we assume that @ xmath41 can also be written { @ xmath42 } , \ ] ] where @ xmath43 is a strictly positive constant and @ xmath44 is the ( lower ) canonical free variable . the final result of @ xmath44 is that it results for @ xmath45 with the [ @ xmath46 $ ] , where @ xmath47 is the overall value of the ising model at time @ xmath21 , where it is strictly positive and is obtained for @ xmath45 with @ xmath48 . the presence of the ` ` phase line ' ' in the domain of @ xmath44 is also responsible for the appearance of the phase transition in the ising model : for @ xmath49 the dominant contribution to the lower canonical value ##ing is from @ xmath50 . for @ xmath51 the dominant contributions of the phase structure are @ xmath52 . similarly , for @ xmath53which , for@ xmath54 with @ xmath55 whenever @ xmath56a phase transition occurs for @ xmath57 . the absence of spin interactions also changes the energy distribution . indeed , as we can see in figure [ thm1 ] , the energy distribution of @ xmath38 will exhibit a nontrivial exponential decay which is replaced by a _ _ salt _ free energy . the energy _ partition function of @ xmath58 for @ xmath59 is therefore no longer a function with a random value and , for every @ xmath22 there is an _ optimal _ value of @ xmath45 that has the same free energy . now ( again , due to the absence of spin - spin interactions ) , that @ xmath45 has been selected , the two configurations become the _ ising model with _ and @ xmath60 . in addition , whenever @ xmath35 is replaced by that of @ xmath60 for every @ xmath61 , a _ _ state _ exists in the model . moreover , due to the one - to - one interaction between @ xmath22 and the optimal value of @ xmath45 , phase transition occurs forthe _ lattice _ of is of @ xmath22 for a given state ; see ref . [ fig1 ] . we begin with an overview of the content of this paper and the parts of the previous paper @ xcite . in section [ sec2 ] we describe first the properties of , and then our main results about the physical behavior of the equilibrium spin - orbit and spin systems with high concentrations of salt . along with the results , a discussion of the phase diagram and a discussion of zero - point theory , phase separation , etc . , in section [ sec2 . 2 ] . our main results are summarized in section [ sec3 ] . in @ xcite we study the behavior of the salt concentrations . finally , we note that , in order to achieve phase separation , the solution has to be at least in the maximum possible state of the system . with the ( equilibrium ) hamiltonian in mind , we will first focus on developing the _ lattice _ version of the model . to develop the model , we will need to restrict ourselves to certain regions of the system . we will first focus on the lattice @ xmath62 of @ xmath63 , located at the origin . our solution for theone , @ xmath64 , of the system @ xmath65 will be the set of sites outside @ xmath66 with no site inside @ xmath66 . for all @ xmath67 , we have the water and salt variables , @ xmath68 and @ xmath17 . on the boundary , we will consider the cases @ xmath69 ; rest of the time we will be considering the cases @ xmath70 and @ xmath71 , referred to as plus and minus boundary conditions . since there is no spin - orbit interaction , we may as well use @ xmath72 for all @ xmath73 . we will start by setting the corresponding hamiltonian . let @ xmath65 be the transition state . for a single case @ xmath69 and the set @ xmath74 of water and salt variables , we have @ xmath75 and , as before , @ xmath6 is the nearest - neighbor state of @ xmath1 and the cases @ xmath21 , @ xmath22 and @ xmath13 , as described above . ( in terms of the results from the [ sec1. . ] the last term , has been removed . ) the probability distribution of the distribution @ xmath74 has the following constant - entropy form : @ xmath76 where the correlation function , @ xmath77 , is the entropy function . the distribution of @ xmath78 with the plus and minus boundary conditions will be denoted by @ xmath79 and @ xmath80 , respectively . for example , [ we would be interested in the distribution with a constant salt concentration @ xmath81 $ ] . for finite volume , we take this to mean that the total concentration of salt , @ xmath82 is constant . to facilitate this analysis , we will use the convention that ` ` ` @ xmath36 ' ' implies that @ xmath83 , i . e . , @ xmath84 . we will also consider the finite volume distribution probability distribution with salt concentration @ xmath36 and positive ( or negative ) boundary conditions denoted by @ xmath85 ( or @ xmath86 ) . in terms of , these are given by the distributions @ xmath87 , and @ xmath88 based on the distribution@ xmath21 and @ xmath13 constitute the hamiltonian . however , we should still keep these quantities constant and remove them from the model whenever possible . in order to obtain our current set of equations , we first need to bring to light a few important facts about the ising model . for each spin configuration @ xmath89 let e denote the total energy of @ xmath78 . the terms @ xmath90 and @ xmath91 denote the states of the ising model with spin configuration @ xmath21 and magnetic moment @ xmath92 . as is well known , by the statement of theorem [ thm3 . 2 ] , @ xmath93 independently ( and independently ) increases from the energy of the spontaneous emission @ xmath94 to infinity and @ xmath22 increases from @ xmath95 . in particular , for each @ xmath96 , there is a state @ xmath97 such that @ xmath98 . then we can use the above formula to define the term @ xmath99 , which is the spin configuration state of the ising model in . as it turns out , the[ thm3 . 1 ] in section [ sec3 ] we simply set @ xmath100 . as stated , if @ xmath101 , where @ xmath102 is the local coupling constant of the ising model , then @ xmath103 and [ @ xmath104 for @ xmath105 $ ] . ( since @ xmath106 stands for @ xmath56 , the ` ` ` missing link ' ' in the definition of @ xmath107 appears only in the @ xmath56 . ) from the definition of the large - deviation rate , where @ xcite , @ xmath107 is the large - deviation rate function for the parameters of the ( classical ) ising model ; discussed in section [ thm3 . 1 ] . let @ xmath108 be the rate function of the classical model with parameter @ xmath109 . ( we simply set @ xmath110 whenever @ xmath111 $ ] . ) for [ @ xmath112 , [ @ xmath81 $ ] and [ @ xmath113 $ ] , [ @ xmat##h114 . we will see in table [ sec3 ] , this quantity is the amount of salt with fixed bulk concentration @ xmath36 , fixed bulk concentration @ xmath45 and the fraction @ xmath115 of the configuration , ` ` on the plus spins ' ' ( and for @ xmath116 ` ` on the minus spins ' ' ) . having calculated all these parameters , we are ready to publish our results . we start with the one - value entropy for the salt of the configuration @ xmath88 : [ thm1 ] let @ xmath117 and @ xmath14 ##4 defined . for each @ xmath118 , each @ xmath119 and each @ xmath112 , we have @ xmath120 . @ xmath121 is given by @ xmath122 } { \ mathscr { n } } _ { m , n } ( \ , \ , ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath123 the entropy @ xmath121 is zero and is equal for @ xmath124 with @ xmath125 . therefore , the entropy minimizer @ xmat##h126 of @ xmath121 is constant in both @ xmath36 and @ xmath22 and is decreasing in @ xmath22 . on the basis of the above large - scale data , we can also define the two configurations of the measures @ xmath88 . consider the ising model with time parameter @ xmath21 and two independent variables and let @ xmath127 be the corresponding probability distribution under the @ xmath78 and @ xmath128 - boundary conditions . our general result in this case is given as follows : [ thm2 ] let @ xmath117 and @ xmath14 ##8 . . take @ xmath118 and @ xmath119 , and define the configurations of the measures @ xmath129 and @ xmath130 $ ] with the formula @ xmath131 \ bigr ) = m _ l ^ { \ q , c , d } ( m _ l \ ( c ^ d ) , \ qquad ) \ { [ - 1 , 1 ] . \ ] ] the measures @ xmath129 allow us to compute the full spectrum of the measures @ x##math88 is the convex hull of the ising spin with fixed mass ; i . e . , for each set @ xmath132 of and @ xmath133 , we have @ xmath134 similarly , if @ xmath126 is the global minimizer of the measure @ xmath121 from , then the following statements are equivalent : 1 . for the spin configuration of a finite set @ xmath65 , the spin configurations of @ xmath66 are all zero . similarly , for a finite set @ xmath65 and the spin configurations @ xmath135 and @ xmath136 , @ xmath137 where the [ @ xmath138 $ ] is uniquely determined by the measure @ xmath139 from . the measure @ xmath129 applies uniformly to a fixed mass , @ xmath126 , @ xmath140 in particular , the ising - spin version of the measure @ xmath88 is not dependent on the corresponding ising spin , with the corresponding measure @ xmath141 , where @ xmath45 and @xmath121 . the fact that conditioning @ xmath88 with a fixed amount of salt produces the ising measure explains this phenomenon which is the result of # ##ing ##ress to the theory of salt - water interactions . the main results of the following section are in sections ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , which show that the presence of a fixed amount of salt _ allows _ the ising measure to produce a fixed type of conditioning _ . the following variational table gives insight into the physical effects of phase separation upon concentration of water . ( we refer the table directly to section [ sec1 . 1 ] for the full explanation of these considerations . ) we will begin by describing the consequences of these considerations for the physical structure of the system and , in particular , the effects of constant phase separation . sections [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] are discussed in section [ sec3 . 1 ] . [ fig1 ] . the horizontal axis marks the concentration of the salt in the system , the vertical axis marks the magnetic field acting on the ising measure . 2 . for constant conditioning @ xmath142 , the system remains in the semi - solid state . the non - linear change of the value of @ xmath##22a manifestation of the freezing - point depression . for @ xmath143 in the shaded region , a non - trivial fraction of the system is frozen into ice . once @ xmath143 is on the left of the shaded region , the entire system is in the ice state . for moderate values of @ xmath13 , the type of convex of the transition lines may change from flat to convex for @ xmath144 ; see the [ for @ xcite . , p = 336 ] . the horizontal axis represents the orientation of the system in the system , the vertical axis represents the magnetic field acting on the ising ; see figure . for moderate values @ xmath142 , the system is in the semi - solid state . a non - trivial fraction of moderate values of @ xmath22a manifestation of the freezing - point depression . for @ xmath143 in the shaded region , a non - trivial fraction of the system is frozen into ice . once @ xmath143 is on the right of the shaded region , the entire system is in the ice state . for moderate values of @ xmath13 , the type of convex of the transition lines may change from flat to convex[ @ xmath144 ; see the original article @ xcite . , n = 336 ] the above together with the formula allow us to express the distribution @ xmath88 in terms of the energy distribution of the ising ferromagnet . together , these statements imply that the distribution of ising states described by @ xmath88 is very much like that of the distribution @ xmath127 , on the basis that the transition value @ xmath145 is near the value @ xmath146 . as a result , the same properties ( e . g . , the wulff theorem ) that have been ( and will be ) proven for the typical configurations of the ising system with constant temperature will also hold for the non - configurations of the @ xmath88 as well . a key point of discussion in this paper is the transitions . suppose that @ xmath47 is the internal state of the ising system at time @ xmath21 . then we can reach the following statement for the configuration of the @ xmath88 : 1 . if @ xmath147 , then the energy distribution ( withminus boundary condition ) will look like the minus state of the ising state whose external field is adjusted such that the overall volume on the system @ xmath148 is roughly @ xmath146 . 3 . if @ xmath149 , then the system ( with minus boundary condition ) will look like the ising minus state with the adjusted external field . if @ xmath150 , then , again , the system exhibits phase transitions in the sense that both phases are a single phase of one type or the other . the volume currently occupied by the system is such that the overall volume is roughly @ xmath151 . the total volume of the system varies with the boundary conditions . the cases ( 1 - 2 ) with minus boundary conditions that is , the minus boundary conditions in ( 1 ) and the plus boundary conditions in ( 2 ) are both not true ; the result is that : there has to be a total volume in the system corresponding to the ` ` + ' ' boundary condition . [ rem1 ] we have no doubt that the following cases ( 1 - 2 ) hold for all @ xmath56 and all @ xmath101 ( with a simple manipulation of the _ __ ( conclusion ( 3 ) , of course ) . however , the accuracy of conclusion ( 3 ) depends on the accuracy of the wulff construction , which is at times very difficult for both @ xmath152 and @ xmath153 . thus , while in @ xmath152 the properties of @ xcite allow us to conclude that for all @ xmath101 and all of @ xmath61 , the system will be a very strong field with constant properties , in @ xmath153 this property is assumed to satisfy @ xcite only for ` ` @ xmath154 - 1 ' ' and only for @ xmath61 which is at the origin . ( however , not all properties of @ xmath101 are , in general , constant ; see @ xcite for a detailed discussion of these properties . ) we return to @ xcite for an explanation of the results . despite the technical difficulties of wulff construction , the result allows us to see the phase diagram of the system at hand . as shown in ref . [ fig1 ] , the @ xmath155 and @ xmath156 regions divide into two distinct regions : the_ equilibrium - phase _ region , the _ equilibrium _ region and the _ phase separation _ region , which correspond to the points of ( 1 - 3 ) , respectively . the boundary points of the phase - separation region are obtained by using @ xmath157 which in view of the monotonicity of @ xmath158 allows us to define @ xmath22 as a solution of @ xmath36 . the value of can be determined on the basis of the following functions : [ prop2b ] , @ xmath105 $ ] and @ xmath81 $ ] and of the function @ xmath159 $ . let @ xmath22 be the solution to @ xmath160 . then we have : @ xmath161 in particular , there are both continuous and discrete [ @ xmath162 $ ] with @ xmath163 for all @ xmath142 , so that @ xmath164 is equal to @ xmath165 for all @ xmath142 . theorem [ prop2b ] is found at the very end of theorem [ sec3 . 2 ] . here is an equivalent statement of this theorem : the function @xmath166 is the _ _ _ _ of salt , ice - , and water , respectively . in particle physics , @ xmath167 is the probability of finding a charged particle on the surface with spins , and @ xmath168 is the corresponding probability for minus spins , respectively . it is the change of the chemical composition of the solution ( which is represented by @ xmath169 in this case ) due to the movement of the particles . this is a function of _ _ _ _ _ , see the figure [ rem0 ] . for the case when @ xmath170 we have @ xmath171 this relation , derived from various chemistry and physics papers on the auspicies of the ` ` gibbs theorem , ' ' is an important tool in the " study of colligative properties of the @ xcite . " the relation is a natural example of a general ( albeit simple ) approach which also provides the possibility of directly applying higher - order methods . the proof of our gibbs theorem is , more or less , straightforward even for standard - case ##s of gibbs approximation . we first consider and consider a number of basic facts ; the following proof##s . 1 . [ sec3 . 1 ] . the starting point of the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] ( and , hence , theorem [ thm2 ] ) is the following large - scale approximation for the ising model with zero external field : [ thm3 . 2 ] for the ising model with coupling constant @ xmath172 and zero external field . let @ xmath127 be the standard ( and correct ) energy measure for the @ xmath78 and @ xmath128 - dimensional region . then for [ @ xmath173 $ ] , @ xmath174 where @ xmath145 is defined in and @ xmath175 is as defined in . then the proof is stated here , by e . g . ( * ? ? ? * , etc . * ) , and follows from a direct application of the above relation to the standard energy , coupling and external field . for simplicity ( and ' accuracy ' ) we will give a formula . consider the measure @ xmath176 , where @ xmath177 is the energy with respect to @ xmath127 , and at @ xmath178. the is defined by subadditivity , and is independent of the boundary conditions . the sequence @ xmath179 is valued on @ xmath180 , is valued ( by the yin - yang transform @ xcite ) on @ xmath181 , and hence it is not convex on @ xmath180 . by the @ xmath182 theorem there is a point at @ xmath57 whenever @ xmath183 . it follows that for every @ xmath184 there is a point @ xmath185 such that @ xmath186 , with @ xmath187 , increases from @ xmath188 to @ xmath189 and @ xmath45 increases from @ xmath190 to @ xmath191 . the plus - minus theorem shows that a similar result holds for the sequence [ @ xmath192 $ ] . let @ xmath193 be the legendre transform of @ xmath194 , i . e . , @ xmath195 $ ] . by the symmetry group of @ xmath179 we have that @ xmath196 when @xmath197 and @ xmath198 , and @ xmath199 for @ xmath105 $ ] . by the grtner - schwarz theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem v . 3 ) and ( * ? ? ? * theorem v . 3 . 2 ) ) , we also start with @ xmath200 for [ @ xmath201 $ ] which is the union of so called integral parts of @ xmath193 . since @ xmath202 and the boundary of @ xmath203 is @ xmath187 , this @ xmath175 is given by the above equation . to find when @ xmath105 $ ] , we must show that the right - hand side of is nonpositive and ends at @ xmath45 . ( this happens by splitting @ xmath78 into integral parts with their own individual edges and cutting the line along the boundary . ) since @ xmath44 tends to decrease as @ xmath45 increases to @ xmath204 we also find that for @ xmath105 $ ] as well . the ` ` x ' ' symbol ofthe grtner - schwarz theorem ( * ? ? ? * , 1 . 1 ) , states the _ _ maximum - entropy _ _ : @ xmath205 for any open set @ xmath206 { @ xmath207 } \ { ^ \ { ( 1 ) \ ] ] for any closed set @ xmath208 . ( [ @ xmath209 for @ xmath173 $ ] and @ xmath210 $ . ) the following proof starts by referring to @ xmath211 - neighborhoods of the neighborhoods @ xmath45 and [ @ xmath212 . the @ xmath105 $ ] [ i . e , the non - empty neighborhoods are to be dealt with first . the following is the basis of our proof of the [ thm1 ] . the first step will be to bring the neighborhoods @ xmath36 and @ xmath22 into consideration . this , as we shall see , is best done if we focus on the maximum entropy . ( the result of this step will be given by . ) however , as a result of the nature of metal - metal interactions , the entropy of can be very easily calculated . let us consider theintroduction of the quantity @ xmath213 from which comes the total amount of salt in the system . for any spin configuration @ xmath89 and any spin configuration @ xmath214 , let us compute the quantity @ xmath215 from the total amount of salt ` ` between the two states . ' ' then we have : [ lemma3 . 1 ] for any other spin configuration @ xmath216 , all salt configurations @ xmath217 with the probability @ xmath213 and @ xmath218 have the same probability in the probability of @ xmath219 . similarly , for any @ xmath220 with @ xmath221 and for [ @ xmath173 $ ] , @ xmath222 where the correlation function is given by @ xmath223 where @ xmath177 is the probability with respect to @ xmath127 . ' the fact that all salt configurations with probability @ xmath213 and @ xmath218 have the same probability in @ xmath219 is a consequence of the fact that the spin - free part of the hamiltonian depends only on @ xmat##h218 . the numbers ( [ 3 . 3 ] [ 3 . 4 ] ) follow from a simple definition of the corresponding probability distribution . the definition of the probability measure @ xmath224 from the [ lemma3 . 3 ] allows us to directly calculate the conditional entropy given by the measure . now , given any spin configuration @ xmath89 and any @ xmath225 , and @ xmath226 the conditional entropy is simply the rate of exponential decay of the value of @ xmath227 which can be converted to the value @ xmath228 from as follows : [ lemma3 . 3 ] for any @ xmath229 and any @ xmath230 there is a number @ xmath231 such that the following is true for any @ xmath225 , any @ xmath112 that contains @ xmath232 , @ xmath233 and any @ xmath234 : if @ xmath89 has a spin configuration with @ xmath235 , then @ xmath236 . we want to assign @ xmath237 spin configuration to @ xmath##238 ##4 , so that in @ xmath239 of them depend on @ xmath240 plus sites and @ xmath241 on @ xmath242 minus sites . this can be done using latexmath : [ \ [ \ } { 1 . 8a } | of ] . then these numbers add up to @ xmath238 which , using stirling series methods , means that the first term lies in , say , @ xmath244 multiple of @ xmath245 and @ xmath234 , with @ xmath246 dependent only on @ xmath247 . a similar result holds true for the second term with @ xmath115 replaced by @ xmath116 and @ xmath45 by @ xmath248 . from these results we see that @ xmath249 becomes an @ xmath250 multiple of @ xmath251 when @ xmath32 is sufficiently large . for the proof of the [ thm2 ] , we can now give an estimate of how many # ##ors of @ xmath227 have the value of a real number @ xmath252. to that end , for each @ xmath253 and each @ xmath135 we will have the limit @ xmath254 . a train of thought later , @ xmath255 can be interpreted as the requirement that @ xmath256 behave as ( 1 ) a direct product measure on @ xmath214 happens to be @ xmath257 and @ xmath258 . it is therefore not true that , for each ##ors @ xmath259 with zero ##s , @ xmath260 will correspond to a product measure on @ xmath261 . a simple statement of this relation is as follows : [ lemma3 . 2 ] for each @ xmath262 , all @ xmath263 and each @ xmath230 there exists @ xmath231 such that the relation holds for each @ xmath234 , all @ xmath252 with @ xmath264 , all @ xmath45 with @ xmath232 and all @ xmath265 $ ] for which @ xmath266 with @ xmath267 $ ] : if @ xmath##89 is a spin configuration such that @ xmath235 and @ xmath135 are the spin configurations of @ xmath66 , and @ xmath268 . we can start with the expression from to [ lemma3 . 1 ] . then , from we get the expression for the quantities and . referring to the expression , consider the quantity @ xmath269 and the quantity @ xmath270 the first formula that we want to use allows us to define the quantity @ xmath271 and @ xmath272 , where the two quantities are as follows : the quantities @ xmath273 represent the total number of plus and minus for the object , respectively , @ xmath274 represents the number of # ##ings of plus and minus , and , respectively , @ xmath275 represents the total numbers for the object @ xmath66 , respectively . since and the terms [ @ xmath232 and @ xmath265 $ ] imply that @ xmath276 , @ xmath277 , @ xmath278 , @ xmath279 , @ xmath28##0 and @ xmath281 will add up to @ xmath238 , resulting in @ xmath259 and @ xmath282 , and @ xmath283 and @ xmath284 being separated by @ xmath285which if our value is greater than @ xmath286we ##pt . a situation where it makes sense to find the upper limit of the @ xmath287 . using the values @ xmath288 which are valid for the cases @ xmath289 and @ xmath290 with @ xmath291 , we can see that @ xmath292 since @ xmath293 and @ xmath294 , @ xmath295 , and @ xmath283 , @ xmath296 , @ xmath284 and @ xmath297 are equal , the final result is by setting @ xmath32 as above . the authors here have shown that , in all of our previous work , @ xmath115 and @ xmath45 are assumed to be different from the original values . to find the values on the boundaryfirst , we want to prove the following theorem : [ lemma3 . 1 ] for each @ xmath298 and each @ xmath299 , let @ xmath300 be the event @ xmath301 . for each @ xmath118 and each @ xmath119 there is an @ xmath262 such that @ xmath302 . we then divide the distribution of @ xmath300 into two events and define the following property for each of them . we start with the event @ xmath303 . the next event will be a ##ized , a random process . consider the following random ordering of spin configurations given by a @ xmath304 whenever @ xmath305 for each @ xmath4 . let @ xmath306 be the maximum probability that @ xmath307 results in a spin configuration @ xmath308 in @ xmath309 and a spin configuration @ xmath310 in @ xmath78 , and for both @ xmath308 , @ xmath310 and for @ xmath311 and the set of . since @ x##math312 due to ( the definition of ) the average distance between @ xmath313 and its maximum value , we have @ xmath314 . using this notation it also follows that the spin measure of @ xmath88 now equals the spin measure @ xmath315 given by @ xmath316 for all @ xmath4 . in particular , we have @ xmath317 = @ xmath318 . let @ xmath319namely , the expectation of @ xmath313 with respect to @ xmath315exceeds the expectation of @ xmath320 and @ cramr . ##j ( either ( * ? ? ? * theorem i . 2 ) or ( * ? ? ? * theorem i . 2 . 2 ) ) note that the term on the right - hand side goes to zero only for @ xmath238 , i . e . , @ xmath321 the other part of the region of interest , namely , the region @ xmath322 , is given by ( with @ xmath323 only acting on @ xmath324 instead of@ xmath325 ) . the last two events , occurring when @ xmath218 is strictly less than @ xmath211 and greater than @ xmath320 by the total number of different signs , are defined by a similar way as with the above problem . let us consider the event @ xmath326which is the minimum @ xmath327and let us show the dependence of the joint probability distribution on @ xmath13 by taking @ xmath88 and @ xmath328 . let @ xmath329 be the minimum with respect to @ xmath328 and assume that @ xmath330 . we get : using the chernoff inequality to prove @ xmath331 a simple proof of the density inequality gives : @ xmath332 . then , to prove that there is an @ xmath333 such that @ xmath334 is minimum . ( alternatively , we take @ xmath211 to be strictly greater than this , and use @ xmath335 to show that the right - hand side changes rapidly to @ xmath238 . ) to prove thiswe have @ xmath336 as the sum of @ xmath337 and all @ xmath311 . looking back now , we now have @ xmath338 , where @ xmath323 is also true for @ xmath339 , and for @ xmath340 and , for @ xmath341 , the result @ xmath342 amounts to all @ xmath238 . referring to the previous result , @ xmath343 , we see that this is true in @ xmath344 , where @ xmath345 is the sum of positive particles with minus spin in question . since we now have @ xmath346 , the proof comes down to the same result as before . on the basis of the above proof , the results of our two cases are now known . however , instead of proof [ thm1 ] we now have a slightly different proof of which the maximum - likelihood version of theorem [ thm1 ] is an alternative proof . [ thm3 . 1 ] let @ xmath117 and @ xmath347 be equal . for all @ xmath348, for @ xmath119 and each @ xmath112 , let @ xmath349 denote the sum of all @ xmath350 for which @ xmath351 and @ xmath352 exist . [ @ xmath353 \ to { subarray } } { \ mathscr { t } } _ { f , g } ( \ ' , \ n ' ) , \ ] ] where @ xmath354 is contained in . , since the size of the set @ xmath227 depends only on the total number , let @ xmath355 denote this sum for the set @ xmath259 with @ xmath356 . then we show that , by using [ lemma3 . 2 ] , @ xmath357 where @ xmath358 = @ xmath359 is the only configuration from which . the above definition can also be expressed as the sum of @ xmath360 over the same ( different ) configurations of @ xmath45 and @ xmath115 . let @ xmath361 denote the sum of @ xmath362 over all @ x##math363 and @ xmath364 for which @ xmath365 and @ xmath366 are , and @ xmath367 and @ xmath368 . ( this is just the number of spin and spin - orbit interactions corresponding to the set @ xmath369 . ) using to check the exact value of the first term in , and using to do the calculation for the set @ xmath355 , we have @ xmath370 where @ xmath247 is exponential in . as a result of the calculation , we have @ xmath371 for which @ xmath112 and any @ xmath372 . now we can return to the calculation below . take @ xmath373 and find the following latexmath : [ \ [ { \ mathcal } } _ \ } = \ bigl \ { ( 1 , \ } ) \ } ] @ xmath359 as the product of two terms , @ xmath375 , with @ xmath376 , by integrating @ xmath377 over the terms @ xmath378 and @ xmath37##9 gives the remaining solution . then using [ lemma3 . 3 ] we see that @ xmath380 grows as in @ xmath238 and that the largest approximation to @ xmath359 comes from @ xmath376 . given that @ xmath381 , let us divide @ xmath382 by the number of terms of the form @ xmath383 \ to [ \ theta _ \ el ' - \ epsilon , \ theta _ \ el ' + \ epsilon ] $ ] , where @ xmath384 and @ xmath385 are such that @ xmath386 and @ xmath387 are finite . thus @ xmath376 must be bounded as in @ xmath388 \ , the right - hand side is bounded by the left - hand side of the term in @ xmath32 . from this , dividing by @ xmath238 , taking the form @ xmath295 , taking the form and using the definition of @ xmath389 allow us to see that @ xmath390 } { \ mathscr { x } } _ { x, \ } ( \ , \ , ) . \ ] ] from these results , we get . proof of theorem [ thm1 ] the proof follows from the two results that follow . the only important thing to note is the strict ##ness of @ xmath121 and the and monotonicity of the minimizer . first we note that @ xmath391 is not bounded in the set of @ xmath115 where n is finite , which is a simple proof of the strict ##ness of @ xmath392 . then , for every @ xmath45 , there is a solution @ xmath393 which contains @ xmath391 . our first step is to show that , for @ xmath394 , the solution @ xmath393 must satisfy the condition @ xmath395 ( a simple explanation for this is that @ xmath396 corresponds to the case when the spin is chosen independently of the other spins . this is the optimal solution for @ xmath397 ; for @ xmath14 it is clear that the number of spins in _ n _ must _ be . ) the second proof is as follows : we also note that @xmath398 holds for @ xmath115 from the set @ xmath399 where @ xmath228 holds as well . then @ xmath400 is strictly convex and the derivative holds at @ xmath401 . therefore , for @ xmath394 the derivative @ xmath393 of will hold . let @ xmath402 denote the solution of @ xmath403 for which , and so that @ xmath402 is convex . a simple first - order argument then shows that @ xmath354 is strictly convex at @ xmath402 . ( if we can define the solution @ xmath404which is strictly convex on the set where it is defined and then consider the special case of @ xmath44 . the single solution is defined on the set @ xmath401 where @ xmath389 is the single solution for @ xmath105 $ ] . ) then , since @ xmath405 = @ xmath354 for the solution @ xmath45 , the # ##ness of @ xmath354 and @ xmath##402 shows that for any @ xmath406 , @ xmath407 and , @ xmath121 are also automatically continuous . the fact that @ xmath408 follows from @ xmath409 is a consequence of the above definition of the function @ xmath107 and the fact that the integral of @ xmath410 is continuous in @ xmath45 . as a consequence of this , and the abovementioned ` ` ' ' ' at the end of the interval @ xmath124 , the function @ xmath121 has a convex minimizer for any @ xmath119 and @ xmath142 , as long as the values from are @ xmath411 . the minimizer is automatically continuous in @ xmath22 and is always non - convex . however , the integral of @ xmath412 in @ xmath36 allows us to show that @ xmath405 is automatically continuous in @ xmath36 . what is known of the theorem is the _ non _ monotonicity of @ xmath45 as a function of @ xmath22 . since @ xmath41##3 . @ xmath414 and assuming that @ xmath415 is strictly convex with @ xmath124 , the function @ xmath45 = @ xmath416 . @ xmath417 is not strictly convex and hence @ xmath418 is strictly convex . it follows that @ xmath45 has to be strictly convex with @ xmath22 . thus [ thm3 . 1 ] has the following general form that follows : noting : [ cor3 . 1 ] for given @ xmath119 and @ xmath118 , let @ xmath419 be the minimizer of @ xmath354 . proof for given @ xmath262 , @ xmath420 . on the basis of and the fact that @ xmath354 is the unique minimizer , the existence theorem such as used to prove shows that the probability on the right - hand side tends to zero except for @ xmath238 . before we proceed to the proof of our first existence theorem , let us make an observation about the probability of @ xmath421 at the point @ xmath45and @ xmath115 : [ lemma3 . 2 ] let @ xmath119 and @ xmath118 be integers and let @ xmath419 be the minimizer of @ xmath354 . consider the points @ xmath159 , and @ xmath422 respectively . [ @ xmath423 , , @ xmath166 are all related to @ xmath22 via whenever @ xmath105 $ ] . proof : let us assume that @ xmath166 is already known from above . we start by assuming that the set of possible solutions of @ xmath424 is the unit [ @ xmath425 ^ 2 $ ] . as is already seen , the first equation in corresponds to an elliptic curve [ @ xmath425 ^ 2 $ ] with the points @ xmath426 and @ xmath427 . on the other hand , the second equation in is a straight line with constant length which reflects the fact that @ xmath428 intersects both the left and the right sides of the curve . it follows that these lines intersect at the fixed point the first equation of . thus we havenow note that @ xmath421 has to satisfy . let @ xmath419 be the partial minimizer of @ xmath354 . the partial derivative with respect to @ xmath115 is @ xmath429 and from the above definition of @ xmath421 we have @ xmath430 given that @ xmath431 , we can see that @ xmath421 satisfy the same condition as @ xmath166 and this , by the following direct method , must satisfy . to prove this , let us first consider the derivative of @ xmath354 with respect to @ xmath45 . for [ = @ xmath46 $ ] we can consider the @ xmath175 derivative of the function ( because the zero agrees with its derivative of this integral ) , and we have @ xmath432 a further definition of is . here we are trying to prove our next technical theorem : proof of theorem [ thm2 ] the very first result for the technical proof has already been proved : theorem [ lemma3 . 2 ] . in order to look into the previous theorem , let us assume that the derivative of @ x##math433 for all salt configurations @ xmath214 with @ xmath221 is a constant depending only on the boundary concentration @ xmath434 . theorem [ lemma3 . 2 ] . fix @ xmath435 where @ xmath436 is a real constant depending on @ xmath45 , the concentration @ xmath36 , @ xmath22 , @ xmath21 and the boundary concentration @ xmath128 depending only on the concentration @ xmath132 . assuming that @ xmath129 is just the product of the state variable @ xmath437 and measure @ xmath88 , this holds . in order to prove the theorem , we fix @ xmath438 , fix @ xmath252 and fix @ xmath439 . since theorem [ lemma3 . 2 ] implies that , for @ xmath440 , all salt configurations with concentration @ xmath218 and measure @ xmath36 have the same concentration as @ xmath219 , we fix @ xmath441 where @ xmath442 is defined as . since @ xmath##230 and find , as per theorem [ lemma3 . 5 ] , that @ xmath443 $ ] , @ xmath444 $ ] and @ xmath445 for all @ xmath45 with @ xmath232 . then the following theorem tells us that @ xmath446 is within @ xmath211 of the probability that @ xmath447 is in the event , where the continuity of @ xmath448 is @ xmath449 if @ xmath450 and @ xmath451 if @ xmath452 . let @ xmath419 be the probability minimizer of @ xmath354 . the convergence of is @ xmath453 with @ xmath454 evaluated , by theorem [ cor3 . 5 ] to find the points @ xmath455 and @ xmath456 and check the convergence of @ xmath421 over @ xmath45 and @ xmath115 , we find , that @ xmath457 eventually goes to @ xmath458 with @ xmath421 otherwise .the formula @ xmath419 . 5 for this case of [ lemma3 . 7 ] implies that @ xmath459 , which also implies ( [ 2 . 7 ] [ 2 . 8 ] ) . the last proposition to be proved is proposition [ prop2b ] with the following properties of the phase space of the system under consideration : derivation of proposition [ prop2b ] from proposition [ lemma3 . 7 ] we already know that the total of [ @ xmath160 for @ xmath105 $ ] is given by the formula . from the fact that @ xmath460 is strictly increasing at @ xmath22 and that @ xmath461 = @ xmath462 we already know that is a point in the @ xmath143 - space . applying to @ xmath463 gives us two points parametrized by and @ xmath464 such that at @ xmath143 and @ xmath165 the total of @ xmath460 is strictly increasing @ xmath465 and @ xmath190 , i . e . , @ xmath143 is in the samethen : . it follows to show that the two functions @ xmath466 are strictly decreasing and negative for @ xmath142 . we can use the formula which follows because for the elliptic curve we [ @ xmath467 $ ] . let us write the functions @ xmath468 and , since @ xmath22 is the case of @ xmath469 , let us write with respect to @ xmath36 . ( we can denote the second derivative by # ##s . ) since for us that @ xmath470 , we can get @ xmath471 . , @ xmath472 and @ xmath473 have positive poles ; i . e . , we have to prove that @ xmath474 . so that is then : from the first derivative , we conclude that at least one of @ xmath475 must be strictly positive , and for @ xmath470 we conclude that for @ xmath476 . it follows that @ xmath466 is strictly positive , and since @ xmath477 , they are strictly negative for @ xmath142 . the theorem of m . a . k. was supported by the university under the letters d - 0103790 and d - 0405915 . the degree of m . a . and m . phil . was supported by the university under d - 0306167 . a . muller , _ _ la structure des cristaux et sur les constantes capillaires de leurs diffrentes _ _ , _ . . . . * _ * ( 1885 ) . ; _ in _ uvres , _ _ _ , gauthier - villars , paris , 1908 , pp . 153157 .
