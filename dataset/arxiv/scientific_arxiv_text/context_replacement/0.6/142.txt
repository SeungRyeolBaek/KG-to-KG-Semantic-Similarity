during the next few years applications of ads / ads model @ xcite to hadronic physics attracted a lot of attention , and many new dual models of ads were published in the literature ( see , e . g . , @ xcite ) . these models are able to reproduce such fundamental properties of physics as rotational and chiral symmetry breaking , and even to reproduce some of the fundamental hadronic observables ( decay rates , energies ) , with properties very close to the classical ones . amongst the dual models , a special case is the so - called ` ` bottom - up ' ' model ( see , e . g . , @ xcite ) , the goal of which is to reproduce the results of ads by introducing an alternative model in the 5 - dimensional ( 5d ) space sector . within the framework of the ads / ads model , by modeling the theory in the bulk we can attempt to reproduce / reproduce the results of other areas of physics . in the first case , we will be interested in the hard - core ads / ads model @ xcite , where the theory is simulated by simply passing through the ads bulk in the half - plane with a magnet , at a certain distance @ xmath0. in the framework of this soft - wall model , it is possible to calculate form factors and wave functions of vector sectors ( see , e . g . , @ xcite ) . to exploit the special case of the model for the excited state ( ` ` ` ##ization ' ' ) , a soft - wall sector was introduced in @ xcite . the @ xmath1 - 2 form factors for this model were introduced in ref . @ xcite . in general , the vector sector is more sensitive to the infrared ( ir ) spectrum , since this symmetry is not broken in it . however , the soft - wall sector seems to be more sensitive to the particular way the chiral symmetry is broken and , in other words , to the crystal structure and the properties of the transition region @ xcite . in this way , one of the easiest things to study in the theoretical model ##ity of atoms is the particle . the properties of the particle are used in many other models , ( see e . g . ) . in fact , the authors of ref . @ xcite ( see also the article @ xcite ) tried to derive the ( gell - mann oakes renner ) model @ xmath2 and thethe number @ xmath3 and that of the particle @ xmath4 and for the @ xmath5 limit ( the coupling between @ xmath1 particles and other particles ) . in ref . @ xcite , the solution of the elementary wave - function problem is also calculated for the @ xmath6 limit . in this section , and in the framework of the solutions found in @ xcite ( hard - wall model ) , we use a formula to describe the form factor and wave function ( and hence the wave function ) of the system . since the solutions of ref . @ xcite give a very large @ xmath7mev value for the elementary chiral symmetry group of @ xmath8 , we have calculated the chiral limit @ xmath6 of the hard - wall - model ##ity of two - dimensional systems . applying to the chiral limit allows us to realize one of the main advantages of ads / ads - the ability to work with the numerical solutions of the elementary equations of motion . expressing the elementary form factor in terms of these equations , we are able , in particular , to calculate and predict the value of the effective effective energy of theanalysis of the decay phase space . from the experimental basis , we come to the conclusion that the radius of the decay is smaller than what is known from nature . furthermore , we note that , in the case of the case of the @ xmath1 decay , increasing the decay signal will reduce the energy scale . in our paper , we systematically and directly describe two sets of two wave functions @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 , which are related to each other and are related to the two states described in our paper @ xcite , where we use two states . the paper is divided in the following sections . we begin with describing , in section i , the structure of the double - slit theory and the results presented in it . @ xcite , in particular , the properties of the two states , the governing equations for the states and their interactions . in section iii , we describe the method for calculating the energy scale , and express it in terms of the two wave functions described above . in section iv , we describe the relationship of our ir / h measurements to experimental data . we express the values of the effective decay rate and the effective decay time in terms of the .part of the theory and study their behavior in different parts of the phase space . in the end , we study the behavior of the large scale field at the momentum scale . next , we review the results . in the transverse background of ads , these states correspond to kaluza - type ( kk ) states in the ads background @ xmath11 ##0 . in particular , these currents correspond to the kk components of the vector gauge field in this background . since the gauge symmetry of the transverse part of the ads - background is not broken , the transverse part of the vector gauge field is unphysical , and the transverse components correspond to axial currents . thus , the axial - vector currents are the components of the transverse part of the axial - vector gauge field . however , because the axial - vector gauge field is not in the 5d background , the transverse components have no effect and are identical to the vector currents . this should be taken into account if we want to test the theory in a practical context . the basic assumption of the ads theory is that there is a connection between the 4d - and axial - vector currents and the corresponding 5d gauge field : @ xmath12where @ xmath13 , ( @ xmath14 and @ xmath15 are the rotation ##s ) . in addition , we may write @ xmath16 , where @ xmath17 and @ xmath18 are transverse and longitudinal components of the axial - vector component . the transverse symmetry breaking allows @ xmath19 to be invariant and interact with the gauge field , as in this equation . the longitudinal component can be written in the form : @ xmath20 . where @ xmath21 corresponds to the electron mass . fusion of the axial - vector and pseudoscalar components is described by the equation @ xmath22 \ , \ { { t } \ ] ] where @ xmath23 , ( @ xmath24 ) and @ xmath25 are written as the product of the chiral parameters @ xmath26 and the vector @ xmath27 and the chiral symmetry breaking parameters @ xmath8 and @ xmath28 , with @ xmath8 playing the role of the electron mass and @ xmath28 that of the gauge field . dividing @ xmath29 into units of @ xmath30 .the following description of the mechanism @ xmath31 . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] this higgs - like mechanism describes the axial - vector gauge field by introducing an @ xmath32 - like coupling term to the @ xmath33 - form of the lagrangian . using the coupling with respect to the transverse part of the axial - vector gauge field @ xmath34 and taking the mirror image of @ xmath34 and @ xmath35 we can obtain the following equation of motion @ xmath36 _ { \ perp } = [ \ , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] that describes motion of the axial - vector field , as @ xmath37 . the axial - vector boundary - to - boundary action @ xmath38 is given by the mechanism @ xmath39 . it is known . ( [ axvec ] ) with boundary conditions ( i . c . ) @ xmath40 and @ xmath41 . then , variation with respect to the transverse part @ xmath42 gives @ xmath43 and , variation with respect to @ xmath44 gives @ xmath45 the resulting wave function is obtained fromq . ( [ phieq ] ) and ( [ pieq ] ) with i . q . @ xmath46 , @ xmath47 and @ xmath48 . in the case of the case of ref . @ xcite , it is possible to use the gell - mann oakes renner equation @ xmath49 a massless expansion in the @ xmath6 limit . for @ xmath50 and i . ( [ pieq ] ) = @ xmath51 a perturbative expansion in the form of @ xmath52 , was obtained for us @ xcite , with @ xmath53 as the upper limit . then it was shown that , in the @ xmath54 limit , @ xmath55 corresponds to @ xmath56 and , roughly speaking , @ xmath57 in this case . since our goal is to find the general ##ization of in the chiral domain , this approximation should be sufficient for us . the case in the axial - current domain is of the pseudoscalar particle @ xmath58 and axial - current particle @ xmath59 , where @ xmath60 corresponds to the @ xmat##h61 axial - vector currents = ##s ( and we add the other terms ) . thus , the two - point function for the axial - vector current has the form : @ xmath62 where the linear differential operator is given by @ xmath63 the expression for the two - point function can be also written as @ xmath64 in which the first term on the right is directly proportional to @ xmath65 . as seen in ref . @ xcite , using this expression we can extend the two - point function to @ xmath66 _ { i = 0 } $ ] and see that @ xmath67 for the spacelike @ xmath68 , ref . ( [ axvec ] ) has the same form as the rest of the function , and the same inverse fourier expansion , exactly as seen from above . the first term of the axial - vector electric current is written as @ xmath69 . in the chiral case , when @ xmath70 , we have @ xmath71 , and the same expression for @ xmath72 , ref . ( [ phieq] ) can be written as the expression @ xmath73 for the solution @ xmath74 . in the chiral case , when @ xmath75 , the value of @ xmath76 increases to 1 for @ xmath77 . this equation and the e . g . @ xmath78 are the same as those for @ xmath79 and , , , etc . ( [ pioneq ] ) agrees with the @ xmath80 value of and ( [ axvec ] ) for @ xmath79 . similarly , the expression for @ xmath81 agrees with @ xmath82 : @ xmath83 and we can use @ xmath84 in our definition of @ xmath1 - state wave function ( ) . @ xcite , we see that it makes sense to define all the wave functions @ xmath85 of the quantum sturm - liouville equation . as we see , they are closer in their form to the corresponding quantum 1 - state wave functions than the solutions of the above equation . in the latter case , it is convenient to define the @ xmat##h86 ##0 : @ xmath87 , is at the phase of @ xmath88 and , according to fig . ( [ piondecay1 ] ) , is equal to @ xmath89 at the origin . note also that in fig . ( [ pioneq ] ) we can write @ xmath90 as part of @ xmath86 : @ xmath91 to calculate the total correlation , , we need to consider three - point correlation ##s . the correlator should include the external magnetic field @ xmath92 and fields with nonzero charge onto the spin axis , e . g . the magnetic field @ xmath93 @ xmath94 where @ xmath95 is the magnetic moment , with the energy being equal to the electron state being @ xmath96 ( as above , we have @ xmath97 , @ xmath98 ) . the canonical representation for the three - point correlation is the two - dimensional representation of fig . ( [ 2axial ] ) @ xmath99 where the second term , is constant with respect to @ xmath100and @ xmath101 is the total electromagnetic form factor @ xmath102 @ xmath103 ( relative to @ xmath104 ) , the other two terms are the number of wave - particle interactions and are evaluated either with respect to @ xmath100 , @ xmath101 , or both . finally , the electromagnetic form factor can be calculated from the zero - sum . from @ xmath105 to extract the result from the hall effect , we consider the terms of the second term of the system . there are two types of terms corresponding to the total electromagnetic form factor : @ xmath107 term and @ xmath106 term . let us consider all the terms from @ xmath106 term . they are @ xmath108 , @ xmath109 and @ xmath110 , and can be written as @ xmath111 + a _ { mn } [ a ^ { m } , a ^ { n } ] + a _ { mn } [ a ^ { m } , a ^ { n } ] \ , ) \ , \ , { n } \ ] ] where @ xmath##112 and @ xmath113 . using @ xmath114 values , we find out the component of the field which is equal to the 4 - point function @ xmath115 : @ xmath116 + a _ { \ mu \ right } [ a ^ { \ mu } , a ^ { \ nu } ] \ right ) . \ left { \ } \ ] ] using fourier transforms of and , we have , as before , @ xmath117 for the vector field , where @ xmath118 is the fourier transform of the 4 - point function @ xmath119 and @ xmath120 is the bulk - to - bulk solution of the equation @ xmath121 with i . e . @ xmath122 and @ xmath123 . this can be written as the sum @ xmath124 of all the bound states in the @ xmath125 - system , with @ xmath126 being the sum of the @ xmath127th bound state and @ xmath128 the transfer function given by the solution of the differential equation of motion for the vector field . the equation ( [ proj##0 ] ) taking up only the longitudinal component @ xmath129 of the wave - function z . taking into account that @ xmath130 , we also have @ xmath131 where @ xmath132 and @ xmath133 are the fourier transforms of @ xmath134 and @ xmath135 , respectively . however , there is only one hole in the sum of the ##holes in this expansion , namely , the massless hole . therefore , we have @ xmath136 and , respectively , @ xmath137 this allows us to write @ xmath138 in the expansion @ xmath139 with the longitudinal component @ xmath140 and the longitudinal transfer ##or @ xmath141 , which is the solution of the wave equation ( [ phieq ] ) . using this equation and the fourier transforms of @ xmath142 and @ xmath143 \ int ^ { f _ 0 } _ { \ epsilon } dz ~ \ frac { 1 } { z } \ , { \ cal ##c } ( w , z ) \ , \ epsilon ^ 2 ( z ) \ , { w } \] ] ( note that the second term in fig . ( [ xnia ] ) is for the center - tilt equation ) . integrating this equation with respect to time yields the following two - dimensional solution : @ xmath144 where , using the equation @ xmath145 , we have @ xmath146 with the parameter 1 . now , integrating @ xmath147 and using the dynamic factor in fig . ( [ proj0 ] ) , we will have @ xmath148 where @ xmath149 is the dynamic factor given by the equation @ xmath150 the corresponding boundary - to - boundary vector @ xmath151 for spacelike fields , transformed into the dynamic factor @ xmath149 , yields the equation @ xmath152 with i . q . @ xmath153 and @ xmath154 . the second term is given by @ xmath155 \ . \ ] ] we can now see that @ xmath156 . for all the fields , we have @ xmath157 given by , and the equations of motion are for @ xmath15##8 and @ xmath159 into @ xmath160 \ . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] we need only to generate the @ xmath161 expression from the @ xmath107 part of the ads expression ( [ almost ] ) . it is generated from @ xmath162 , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] and the expression from @ xmath163 into @ xmath164 \ , . ( [ almost ] ) . the ads expression ( see also ref . @ xcite ) can be more easily expressed in terms of the @ xmath165 [ equation @ xmath166 \ . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] the equation of state for @ xmath167 , we can see that the expression in square brackets agrees with @ xmath168 and gives the same factor as @ xmath169 this also allows us to also calculate the expression @ xmath170 where we take into account that @ xmath171 and @ xmath172 . we can also write our expression for the same form factor as @ xmath173 \ equiv \ int _ { x }^ { p _ 0 } dz \ , \ { \ cal ##c } ( y , z ) \ , \ phi ( y ) \ , \ phi { z } \ ] ] and define the function @ xmath174 as the total energy function , as it was defined in 1984 . @ xcite . note that writing down the second term in square brackets gives an expression similar to our expression @ xcite for the @ xmath1 - proton form factor @ xmath175 the terms of the function @ xmath176 correspond to the terms of the classical equation of motion . the value of @ xmath177 at the origin is equal to the @ xmath1 - proton mass of @ xmath178 ( or , @ xmath179 @ xcite ) , or , @ xmath180 . thus , the proton wave function @ xmath181 is the weak form of the @ xmath1 - proton wave function @ xmath182 . the difference is that , in the classical case , there is only the second term in the form factor of . the second , in fact , is needed to obtain the identity##ization of the phase equation of @ xmath183 . using fig . ( [ ff ] ) , this equation is written in terms of the @ xmath184 wave function , and using fig . ( [ ff ] ) we can write it either in terms of @ xmath9 : @ xmath185 : @ xmath186 the solution of the @ xmath90 wave function follows from the solution of fig .

( [ psi0 ] ) , gives the { @ xmath192 } { \ , [ 1 / 3 ] } \ , \ frac { i _ { 2 / 3 } \ left ( \ alpha z ^ 3 _ 0 \ right ) } { i _ { - 2 / 3 } \ left ( \ alpha z ^ 3 _ 0 \ right ) } \ frac { \ alpha ^ { 2 / 3 } } { i _{ ^ { } \ { { 1 } \ ] ] for @ xmath193 in terms of the confinement mass @ xmath194 and the confinement energy @ xmath195 . since @ xmath28 appears in the expression given by @ xmath194 , we can calculate @ xmath194 in what follows . note also that @ xmath196 . assuming that the equations of motion for the vector sector of this quantum system are not affected by the chiral symmetry - breaking effects induced by the scale @ xmath197 , it is possible to calculate the value of @ xmath195 from the vector sector above , i . e . , from the @ xmath1 - 3 scale . the corresponding scale of @ xmath195 ( calling it @ xmath198 ) is called @ xmath199 . as shown in fig . ( [ fpi2 ] ) , @ xmath193 looks like a very simple sum of two scales , @ xmath195 and @ xmath194 . note , however , that the scale @ xmath200 is very similar to that for @ xmath##201 and is different from that for @ xmath202 . however , for sufficiently large values of the limiting radius , @ xmath203 , the value of @ xmath193 is limited to the value of @ xmath194 \ . this limiting value of @ xmath193 is given by @ xmath204 } { \ gamma [ 1 / 3 ] } } = \ frac { 2 ^ { 1 / 3 } } { 2 ^ { 1 / 3 } \ , } \ , \ sqrt { \ frac { \ gamma [ 1 / 3 ] } { \ gamma [ 1 / 3 ] } } \ , \ alpha ^ { 1 / 3 } \ , \ approx \ frac { \ alpha ^ { 1 / 3 } } { 1 . 0 } \ . \ { { 1 } \ ] ] assuming that @ xmath205 agrees with the limiting radius , @ xmath206 , we should use @ xmath207 . for example @ xmath194 , the value of @ xmath208 is limited to @ xmath198 , i . e . , we are in the limit @xmath209 and we can see that , even if we combined the method ( [ fpi2 ] ) with @ xmath210 , the value of @ xmath193 would not change significantly . therefore , to derive @ xmath206 from fig . ( [ fpi2 ] ) for @ xmath211 , we should use @ xmath212 . however , given this set of values , the value of @ xmath193 is always in one - to - one correspondence with the value of @ xmath194 . it is possible to construct a dimensionless variable @ xmath213 where the values @ xmath214 and @ xmath215 correspond to @ xmath216 . as we can see from fig . ( [ fpi ] ) , the value of @ xmath193 is perfectly equal for @ xmath201 . the small value @ xmath195 is a convenient way to calculate it , and it makes sense to use the form of integral ( [ ff ] ) for an integral of the dimensionless variable @ xmath217 : @ xmath218 \ equiv \ int_ { 1 } ^ { 2 } { \ , \ , \ , \ { \ cal ##c } ( \ , \ , , z _ 1 ) \ , \ , ( \ , , z ) \ , \ end { 0 } \ ] ] where the length of @ xmath194 is given by the dimensionless expression @ xmath219 . the expression @ xmath220 takes advantage of the # ##ness of the scale factor . it is given by @ xmath221 } { \ , [ 2 / 3 ] } \ , \ frac { i _ { 2 / 3 } ( a ) } { i _ { - 2 / 3 } ( a ) } \ . \ end { 0 } \ ] ] for large @ xmath219 , it can be expressed as @ xmath222 . for small @ xmath219 , using the fact that @ xmath223 is very close to that for @ xmath201 , we can write @ xmath224 for this expression . in terms of @ xmath220 , the exponential growth rate can be expressed as @ xmath225 for small @ xmath219, this is @ xmath226 for all @ xmath219 , we have @ xmath227 the variables @ xmath228 are from the @ xmath86 and @ xmath90 ##0 functions found in @ xmath229 and @ xmath219 respectively . for @ xmath230 , the wave functions are @ xmath231 and @ xmath232 . as @ xmath219 increases , the functions become more and more complex ( see fig . [ psiphi ] ) . for example , we have @ xmath233 at the @ xmath234 limit , a function that stops at the limit ( see fig . ( [ rhodense ] ) ) . for nonzero @ xmath219 , the value of @ xmath235 monotonically increases with @ xmath219 , and the function itself decreases . the value of @ xmath235 with @ xmath219 is given by the monotonically increasing function @ xmath220 . it is useful to consider the probability of @ xmath236 ( starting with the ` ` x ' ' and @xmath237 ) with the @ xmath1 - electron density @ xmath238 of 1 . these values are very similar for @ xmath239 , but they differ for the @ xmath240 . in addition , the @ xmath1 - electron density is more than 10 times larger for @ xmath241 , which leads to the double - bubble model assuming that @ xmath242 is much smaller than @ xmath193 . it is important to understand how both these values @ xmath243 and @ xmath244 represent an important second - order property of the two - charge model . from the @ xmath245 - expansion of the electron density @ xcite @ xmath246 + \ ldots \ end { aligned } \ ] ] and the expansion of the density @ xmath247 \ , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] where @ xmath248 , we have for the total atomic radius : @ xmath249 \ , \ left ( \ alpha , beta ) = \ frac43 \ , a _ 2 ^ 2 \ , \ right \ { alpha - \ fra##c { a ^ 2 } { \ } + { \ cal ##c } ( a ^ 2 ) \ { \ } \ . \ { { 4 } \ ] ] thus , for large @ xmath195 and small @ xmath219 , when @ xmath250 , the interaction radius is also given by the coupling constant @ xmath195 . in particular , @ xmath251 for @ xmath252 . now , so we get @ xmath253 . this value is very similar to the value @ xmath254 that we found in the k - theory results for the @ xmath1 - k - model resulting from @ xcite from the definition of the @ xmath255 form factor . however , since @ xmath255 has kinematic - like interactions @ xmath256 , it is more convenient to replace @ xmath257 with the @ xmath258 form factor ( [ 1 ] ) given also by the wave function - theory . the radius of @ xmath258 is smaller than that of @ xmath255 , and the interaction radius is much smaller : @ xmath25##9 . so , for @ xmath260 , the @ x . i . p . mass is about 1 . 5 times larger than the @ xmath1 - particle mass calculated for @ xmath261 . with the addition of @ xmath194 , the mass becomes smaller ( see ref . [ 2 ] ) . the experimental value of @ xmath262 @ xcite is calculated for @ xmath263 . however , the experimental value @ xmath264 is very small . if we take @ xmath265 , then @ xmath266 . similarly , if we insist on taking @ xmath210 . with the hard - wall model instead of the @ xmath1 - particle mass , and the value of @ xmath194 is the value @ xmath193 ( so that for @ xmath267 ) , the experimental mass becomes smaller than the experimental value . in practical terms , the difference , in fact , does not seem too great : about 0 . 58fm instead of 0 . 58 ##fm . given that the hard - wall model for this is rather simple , the result can be seen as simple . however ,one might say that , in a more accurate theoretical model of physics , the mass of the particle would be larger . such an approximation is provided by our hard - wall model estimate of the @ xmath1 - large gravitational field , for which we have @ xmath2680 . 0 @ xmath269 ( 0 . 40 @ xmath269 for @ xmath270 ) , i . e . , the field is 0 . 40 @ xmath269 smaller than in the hard - wall model . if @ xmath271 would increase by a small amount , the result would be very close to the actual measured value . to find @ xmath272 for large @ xmath219 ( i . e . , when @ xmath273 for large @ xmath195 , or when @ xmath274 for large @ xmath194 ) , we need also the approximation that , in the case @ xmath201 , we can find @ xmath275 . thus the term in the expression in fig . ( [ rhozeta ] ) is a factor of the term @ xmath276 ( is it @ x##math277 ) , and we can write @ xmath278 \ . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] for @ xmath201 , the upper bound of n in this case can be directly divided by , and @ xmath279 which becomes @ xmath280 \ . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] in general . ( [ fpiinfty ] ) , we can write the integral in terms of the square root in terms of @ xmath193 : @ xmath281 thus , @ xmath282 , the @ xmath283 model consists of two componens : the fixed term @ xmath284 and the term @ associated with @ xmath195 . at @ xmath285 , the electron charge radius is infinite , reflecting the fact that the electron in this region is massless . a similar result to the result for the electron charge radius was obtained @ xcite in the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @ xmath286 which also includes the fixed term @ xmath287 @ xcite . in the experimental pifor massless , and the non - core source @ xmath288 @ xcite . the result , however , is much larger than that of our experiment ( [ rpifpi ] ) and adds 0 . 34 @ xmath269 to @ xmath282 , with the chiral ##ity term giving the result 0 . 34 @ xmath269 , for comparison with experiments . in our result , the experimental outcome taken for @ xmath289 is approximately equal to @ xmath284 , or almost exactly the result taken for @ xmath282 . more precisely , we can take @ xmath290 \ . \ { { 1 } \ ] ] for @ xmath237 , the original experimental result makes a very large value , and our experimental result is very close to the one taken for the njl data point . surprisingly , however , this value of the non - core vs / vs experiment , as we have shown , is much smaller than the experimental value . in the non - @ xmath245 model , the result @ xmath291 is replaced by the low - energy result @ xmath29##2 that is more like @ xmath293 . as a result , the small values @ xmath294 are included in the form factor integral , and the non - @ xmath245 small value of the form factor is given by the values of @ xmath295 at the scale @ xcite , and , @ xmath296 note that the scale @ xmath297 also exists in the standard model . in fact , it is the time scale of the electromagnetic wave function in the ' wave - particle interaction region @ xcite , where it corresponds to the ` ` fundamental time scale ' ' . the leading contribution comes mainly from the @ xmath298 term of the form factor integral ( [ ff2 ] ) . the @ xmath299 leading contribution is more than @ xmath300 since it is dominated by the @ xmath301 term . note , however , that it is not only in the locally observed region @ xmath302 : it is true for more than @ xmath303 of the form factor integral in this region ( namely , the @xmath183 , the @ xmath299 ( goes about 50 % into the square of the form factor ) . from a phenomenological point of view , the ads / ads - ads models for the same form factor vary in the value of the density @ xmath304 that they have . if we assume that the density @ xmath305 is @ xmath306 at the origin , the upper limit is @ xmath307 for any ads model . for @ xmath183 , the form factor is equal to unity , so that the parameters would vary in how they vary between these two models . in fact , the best approximation is given by the monopole expansion @ xmath308 . our on - line experiment produces a density that corresponds to @ xmath309 : the density @ xmath310 is less than unity for the @ xmath311 , but approaching unity for @ xmath312 ( see ref . [ ffact ] ) . in addition , a second monopole form factor was found in our experiment @ xcite , where we found the @ xmath1 - ads .and in the solid - state crystal model , in which it is described as @ xmath313 matrix - type model . it was shown in @ xcite that the form factor of @ xmath314 is the first - order wave function , and @ xmath315 \ { { 0 } \ ] ] is the surface - to - surface ratio of this matrix - type model , and is equal to the frequency of the wave . @ xmath316 was shown in our paper @ xcite . the value of the @ xmath1 - type is : @ xmath317 . as a result , the form factor @ xmath318 is the @ xmath1 - like value @ xmath319 . if we used @ xmath320 , for @ xmath321 and @ xmath322 , the value ( [ calf00 ] ) is @ xmath323 . the resulting wave function @ xmath324 is the theoretical maximum form factor , the ratio @ xmath325 of @ xmath323 to @ xmath183 ( equal to forthe ( value ) is higher than that of the standard si form factor . however , @ xmath326 converts to @ xmath327gev @ xmath328 for about @ xmath245 , yielding only 1 @ xmath329gev @ xmath328 for @ xmath330gev @ xmath328 , and thus increasing by more than 50 % the values jlab ##s @ xcite gives for @ xmath331 and 0 . 45gev @ xmath328 . the authors of ref . @ xcite propose to use ref . ( [ calf00 ] ) , ( [ caljo ] ) as an ads / qc model for the same form factor , with @ xmath332mev , so as to explain these non - @ xmath245 properties . however , such a model increases the value of @ xmath333 by about 50 % . our conclusion is that the ads / qc ##d should explain only the high - energy properties of atoms , and the very low - energy properties , such as @ xmath334 and @ xmath193 , shouldbe careful to consider the other parameters . on the other hand , if the scale factor calculations based on these parameters agree with the non - @ xmath245 model , it is quite possible that this is merely an indication that one is extending the model beyond its theoretical limits . also , as we have seen in the hard - wall model , to accurately estimate the particle density needs to include the chiral symmetry breaking effects found in the ads model . as a result , formulas for the wave function are quite different from those for the @ xmath1 - particle model . therefore , there are some reasons to believe that , in the hard - wall model , the particle shell should have the same density as the @ xmath1 - particle shell . however , the method of filling in the chiral symmetry breaking effects that are found in the hard - wall model of ref . @ xcite presents some difficulties when compared to the ads / ts model @ xcite with the @ xmath301 - wall . as described in ref . @ xcite , the solution of the equation for the @ xmath335 particle in this model is that chiral of @ xmath28 and the center of @ x##math8 are equal to each other , so that @ xmath336 can also be varied independently of @ xmath8 . however , if one reaches the chiral limit @ xmath6 , the chiral limit should also vary . this problem can be solved by appealing to more general mathematical models ( cf . @ xcite ) in which the chiral limit is varied independently . however , such a model is well outside the scope of the main article . instead , we should come to the conclusion that if the experiment is successful , the only possible outcome is a theoretical value of the density @ xmath337 that directly matches the energy scale , and its physical properties . thus , we have an example of a density @ xmath338 that is equal at the radius to the experimental value of @ xmath193 , i . e . , @ xmath339 , but which is still unable to match the experimental value of the total energy density . therefore , to increase the resolution , we should choose a density which is larger for each @ xmath32 than @ xmath340 . since the actual experimental value of the density is a constant , this can becheck this by calculating the slope for all @ xmath32 states . compare the experimental ansatz ( see fig . [ rhomod ] ) @ xmath341 \ , \ end { aligned } \ ] ] with @ xmath342 . it is twice the experimental value for @ xmath343 and twice the value of @ xmath344 comparing it with @ xmath345 and with @ xmath346 gives the first scale is given by the following table of values of the highest possible energy density : @ xmath347 the value of @ xmath348 for @ xmath183 is given by @ xmath349 \ . \ end { aligned } \ ] ] for @ xmath350 , one gets the experimental value 0 . 5 @ xmath269 for @ xmath351 . it is important to note that the density , with this slope , is an approximation for small values of @ xmath32 ( see fig . [ rhomod ] ) , much like the energy density in the brick - wall model ( see fig . ( [ rhodense ] ) ) . due to the large scale, @ xmath348 is larger than the magnetic monopole ##s @ xmath352 and , as a result , is in perfect agreement with the predictions . in fact , it is very close to @ xmath353gev @ xmath328 points , which exceed the values of the jlab @ xmath3541 . 5 and 0 . 45gev @ xmath328 points by about 10 % and 20 % , respectively . this also has a simple solution . the standard ads / qc model is which uses @ xmath355gev @ xmath328 for experimental values of @ xmath193 . on the other hand , jlab experimental values correspond to @ xmath356gev @ xmath328 , which is much better than the experimental values given above . the pre - experimental results , as we have shown , resolve the problem , but there still remains a large gap . as we have shown , such a gap may be simply a sign that we are at a point where ads / qc models should not be expected to exist . in fact , ads / qc models of the##s . @ xcite describes the system in terms of the electric voltage and current , without considering whether the current is generated from spin - 1 / 2 particles , or from magnetic fields , etc . for @ xmath245 and 1gev @ xmath328 , the fundamental nature of the system cannot be explained by the gauge theory ( which is a far - ranging instrument ) , and the description of the system ` ` as a particle ' ' may be difficult . in this context , we consider the system in the chiral framework of two dimensional physics . to this end , we developed a theory that attempts to explain its structure , in the framework of the gauge theory ##ity of physics with hard - core physics . in s . @ xcite , we model the particle with the z component of the z - direction gauge field . we developed the ( sturm - liouville ) gauge wave functions @ xmath9 and @ xmath10 that describe the motion of the particle and the vector @ xmath357 and vector @ xmath358 . these wave functions provide a very useful way to understand the fundamental nature ofthe result . we found that , just as for the @ xmath1 - particle mass @ xcite , the corresponding form factor is given by an expression of the form @ xmath337 that reflects the nature of the charge density of the particle . however , in addition to the @ xmath1 - term , when the mass is also given by @ xmath359 , the charge density has an additional term corresponding to @ xmath360 and together with the @ xmath32 - the term reflects the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking . these terms are used for expressions of the form factor of @ xmath361 . we obtained an explicit expression for the fine structure constant in terms of two components of the mass : @ xmath362 and @ xmath363 , corresponding to those terms in the . @ xcite . from the results , we found it possible to work with the values @ xmath364 and @ xmath365 of the above equation . in particular , we substituted @ xmath265 for the value of @ xmath219 corresponding to the corresponding @ xmath1 - particle mass @ xmath33##4 and 5 decay by @ xmath193 . the importance of the ratio @ xmath219 is that its value fits the model , where the physical properties are either determined by the confinement effects or by the corrections from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . for example , in the most general case @ xmath366 , the proton decay constant is determined primarily by @ xmath362 , with negligibly large corrections due to @ xmath195 correction . however , when @ xmath367 the proton decay constant is equal to the ratio @ xmath368 . thus , for example @ xmath369 , the radius of the particle is determined by @ xmath370 , i . e . , as one would expect , the particle radius is primarily determined by the confinement effects . on the other hand , for @ xmath366 the radius is primarily determined by @ xmath371 , while decreasing with @ xmath195 due to the @ xmath372 correction . we have shown that the effective rms ##e ##q @ xmath373fm for the soft - core model is greater than that obtained here . .in particular , the soft wall at the point @ xmath374fm ( calculated from the @ xmath1 - particle model ) , ` ` does not allow ' ' the particle to move around . therefore , we assume that if the ir model is ` ` ` ' ' , the size of the wall can be reduced to an amount enough to accomodate the particle . the new approach is to use the soft - wall model of ref . @ xcite and model the data in a way similar to what was done in @ xcite for the @ xmath1 - particle model . however , we are having problems with simply comparing the chiral symmetry group of the ir / ir model with the @ xmath301 soft wall . as stated in ref . @ xcite , the chiral symmetry @ xmath28 in such a model is equal to the coupling constant @ xmath8 , so that in the chiral case the symmetry disappears along with the particle mass . to overcome the inherent errors in the accuracy of measurements due to the presence of the soft wall , we calculated the ansatz for the probability density function and for the magnetic field obtained from the .- the error described in ref . @ xcite . we found that this ansatz was unable to match the experimental value of the x - radius . it very poorly matches the data in the @ xmath375gev @ xmath328 region , while perfectly matching the data in the @ xmath376gev @ xmath328 region . the theoretical explanation of this error is fairly simple : the best ads / qc prediction for the x radius of is @ xmath377 , and if one matches the experimental value for @ xmath193 , one gets @ xmath378gev @ xmath328 , which is much lower than the 0 . 4gev @ xmath328 value given by @ xmath376gev @ xmath328 jlab ##el . for this reason , we believe that the error mentioned above may be a sign that the model @ xmath379gev @ xmath328 is within the theoretical limits of ads / qc prediction . in the write - up of this paper , we have shown that the model @ xcite addresses the problemthesis and entry into the arxive . we do not have , however , any problems with our work and research . e . g . would like to thank j . p . johnson for his assistance and assistance at the university , j . j . draayer for assistance at ohio state university . note : published by computer science publishing , llc under u . s . government license no . 0 -
