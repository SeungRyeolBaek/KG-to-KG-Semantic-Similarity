observations of nearby galaxy clusters and galaxies in @ xmath5 often show regions with little - to - no star formation activity , in marked contrast with the above . over - dense regions are dominated by large , fast - evolving s0 and s galaxies , whereas more sparsely - populated regions tend to have galaxies with different sizes , lower stellar populations , and much slower star formation than @ xcite . the observed effect of increasing the galactic radius with time ( the young - oemler effect ; * ? ? ? * ) has been proposed as explanation for increased star formation activity and stellar population build - up in high density regions . namely , that star formation is occurring more rapidly in one or more galaxies than over - dense regions . two different mechanisms can account for the lack of star formation in over - dense regions ( for a comparison , the * ? ? ? ) . regions with very high gas density can be easily perturbed by gravity . they can also be formed more rapidly by an interaction of small galaxies with neighbours , a process called cooling @ xcite . gravitational waves can carry away earth ' s planet ##s ( * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?* ) , cutting off the energy available for future star formation and leading to a significant decrease in sf ##i . in the high - mass cores of galaxy clusters , the hot ( @ xmath6 ) intra - cluster medium ( icm ) can trigger star formation by stripping gas from stars via gas - phase transitions @ xcite . the combined effects of these two processes are highly dependent on the cluster or galaxy dynamics ( cluster structure , dynamics , and intra - cluster / intra - galaxy interactions ) and environment . the observations of galaxy clusters and groups @ @ xmath7 have provided strong evidence that star formation occurs not only in the cluster core , but in high concentrations outside of the cores or galaxy clusters @ xcite . experiments with star formation observations in the infrared @ xcite , group @ xcite , and optical emission - line spectroscopy @ xcite have revealed evidence of _ pre - processing _ , whereby infalling galaxies undergo processing prior to their formation in the galaxy core , and then are formed while in the local region @ xcite . the pre - processing hypothesis has also been supported by studies of the combined effects of galaxy clusters @ xcite and group @ xcite . computer simulations have also been used to study the effects and mechanisms of the pre- - . @ xcite showed that the same physical processes that are being attended to in group environments , including the very strong gravitational pull of galaxies , are capable of transforming late - type , disk - dominated galaxies into disk - dominated , early - type . therefore , @ xcite performed simulations of the gas - distribution processes , with dynamic - equilibrium dynamics ( des ) to fill the cluster with gas , and determine the fraction of the cluster galaxies that ended up settling onto high - mass clusters in different ages . in doing so , @ xcite determined what fraction of those cluster galaxies had been in clusters outside of high - mass for a long enough time to have been pre - processed prior to entering the cluster . the results of their simulations showed that at lower ages a small fraction of cluster galaxies could have been affected by their environment prior to entering the cluster , while at higher ages the fraction of pre - processed galaxies in clusters should only increase . the fraction of cluster galaxies affected by pre - processing in the @ xcite simulation depends on the time timescale for the physical processes ( interactions ) of their environments to produce them , and therefore has a slow evolution component . although many problems go into this simulation , the simulation is a goodnote that the rate of pre - processing has not varied greatly over geological history , and that the @ xmath8 pre - processing should be more efficient . some studies have suggested that the rate of sf evolution over geological history is likely driven by two distinct , and sometimes opposing , forces : climate processes ( or ` secular mass ' ) and environmentally - driven processes ( or environmental ) ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? . however , see the @ xcite for a discussion of how _ history _ _ uses the s sample to perform climate - and environment - analysis . therefore , any attempt to understand the mass dependence of sf evolution must take a full account for the fact that this particular galaxy selection function has mass dependence , especially since the observed stellar mass distribution is expected to vary with the @ xcite . assumptions about evolution caused by the galaxy selection function are important when studying galaxies over a wide range of distances , since one s sample , in stellar mass and in physical properties , including sfr , will likely also vary with @ xmath9 . as a result , so many of these assumptions that apply to non - @ xmath9 models would expect one s sample to .massive galaxies with lower sfrs , and cooler give a more clear picture of the effects of environment on galaxy evolution . however , studies up to pre - @ xmath9 tend to study a wide dynamic range of galaxies , which further gives us the chance to draw firm conclusions about environment - driven evolution . a comprehensive understanding of galaxy evolution in these environments must be applied to the wide dynamic range of galaxy , in order to study not only the active galaxies , especially clusters and clusters , but the more distant galaxies and gas regions . a major challenge faced when examining the possible mechanisms of galaxy evolution , in addition to the many issues of potential evolution , is the wide range of methods used to measure density . initially , @ xcite used an array of different galaxy mapping techniques , which could be roughly divided into two categories : nearest - neighbour methods , which measure galaxy density with an aperture that varies depending on the local galaxy density , and fixed - aperture methods , whose aperture do not change , to create a unified galaxy map . @ xcite found that these methods all use the same data set and produce similar results , but that the nearest - neighbour methods appear to be better for measuring the magnetic field of the galaxies , while the fixed - aperture methods are better atfor the superhalo length scales . however , the technique that is used to measure large scale structures ( lss ) , including clusters , rings , and galaxies , is not necessarily the best method for measuring the magnetic properties of those structures . in this regard , we attempt to understand the structure of pre - galaxies in the early universe by measuring the rest - mass density and star - formation rate of galaxies as a function of density , about two orders of magnitude above the density of the present supercluster . by relying on the photo - @ xmath9 measurements , we determine that our sample of galaxies , derived from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) , is spectroscopically for up to 10 galaxies ( @ xmath10 ) . however , we do not need to rely on high resolution ( photo - @ xmath9 ) measurements , which would cause additional problems due to scattering in our sample and light scattering in the line - of - sight . to determine the structure of the supercluster , we use two different techniques : voronoi scattering ( vs ) and the standard sample distance ( ms ) . the vs uses a multi -cluster - based methods , which can measure the fundamental density fields extending across the entire global halo of galaxies that we observed in the coma supercluster . the wise technique is very effective in identifying cluster structures , including cluster , group , and void , and so we use the latter to determine the types of structures observed in non - cluster environments . our combined wise and wise technique allows us to determine the structure of the entire halo by measuring the fundamental density fields of the cluster , group , cluster , and void structures . the advantage of the determination of our density fields is similar to the sfrs , so our new method of using the _ stellar evolution explorer _ ( galex ; * ? ? ? * ) and wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ? * ) to measure unobscured and cloud - free star - forming regions , respectively , for the entire coma supercluster corresponds to 0 . 02 @ xmath11 . 1 [ 2 ] on the coma supercluster and our data collection data , with our data from sdss , _ galex _ , and wise . in section [ lss ] we present our methods for determining the lss of the coma supercluster ,and in section [ results ] we present our new sfrs and measurements of sf ##r and mass versus size . in section [ results ] we discuss the implications of our results , and compare our results to other papers . in this section we use the parameters @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 , and @ xmath14 . m @ xmath15 mpc @ xmath15 , where the gravitational parameters have been calculated using the precision gravitational calculations of r . j . smith @ xcite . then we use the kroupa parameters @ xcite , and thus we can refer to those with constant mass m @ xmath1610 @ xmath17 as small galaxies , and those with m @ xmath1810 @ xmath17 as large galaxies . the hercules supercluster is an important site to study mergers of galaxy clusters in young galaxies . it contains two large galaxy clusters , abell 1656 and abell 1367 , and two galaxy clusters moving in a filamentary motion between the two clusters @ xcite . however , the two clusters are in very different stable states , with a1656 being stable and a1367 being insee groups @ xcite . the close proximity of the supercluster ( @ xmath19 ) allows us to map the galaxy distribution relative to nearby galaxies ( @ xmath20 ) with a spectroscopically resolved image , and the compact shape of the supercluster , with the galaxy distribution being roughly parallel to our line - of - sight @ xcite , makes it an ideal case study to map galaxies in a wide range of directions with little measurement error . recent studies of the hercules supercluster have been primarily focused on the most distant member , a1656 . its high mass , high galactic radius ( @ xmath21 ) , and size indicate that it attracted a great deal of interest from astronomers in these case studies ( see * ? ? ? * and references below ) . the new member @ xmath01 mpc ##1 of the group of a1656 , which has since been tentatively identified as the infalling group @ xcite , was suggested initially by the high population density of galaxies centered on the galaxy ngc 4839 , and was later confirmed by its strong x - ray emission and the number of interacting galaxies . @ xcite contains a large number of` post - starburst ' ( or p + b ) , working with the ngc 4839 group , came to the conclusion that the ngc 4839 group had experienced a burst of star formation @ xmath22 gyr ##o @ xcite , possibly triggered by the collapse of the multi - galaxy cluster @ xcite . another survey of @ xcite , of b - type and p + a galaxies in the galactic region of a1656 , found a strong correlation between these galaxies and the x - ray sub - galaxies from @ xcite , which suggests that radiation from the nearby icm may be an important factor in causing starbursts , and thus extinction , for infalling galaxies . studies of the galactic supercluster populations had to wait for further all - sky surveys with sufficient resolution to measure galaxies down to their size . however , the subsequent surveys of supercluster populations revealed higher numbers , which , according to the sdss model , only occur for the most massive galaxies and those located among the largest galaxies . @ xcite was the first to conduct an extensive study of the tidal effects of star - forming events on galaxies in the sdss , by using the sfrs , among othermolecular and morphological studies of galaxy properties , to the local density of @ xmath0122 000 , used the sdss data set 1 ( dr1 ) . they found that for galaxies with higher gas density , the sfrs only increase with higher density , and that the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is also much more pronounced in galaxies with lower gas density . @ xcite selected @ xmath23 ##0 - @ xmath9 ##4 from sdss dr4 , and measured a uniform local distribution of active and inactive sf ##rs , using the method of evolution ( or @ xmath24 ) , and found that the active galaxies only occur in galaxies with higher local gas masses . one of the most detailed morphological studies of the local distribution of galaxy properties in galaxies , including spectroscopically - observed galaxies , was by @ xcite . they used sdss dr7 to select @ xmath04000 supercluster galaxies , and measured the local density of each galaxy by measuring the relative fraction of galaxies within a circle of 1 @ xmath25mpc and a arc - width of 1 cm . @ xmath15 ( but with a slightly different distribution of galaxies withinwith the environment , as described above ( [ 1 _ 2 ] ) . they compared the different morphology , colour , and morphology of post - starburst galaxies in different clusters , and found a strong dependence of both colour and morphology with environment for the more massive galaxies and a weak dependence of colour and morphology with environment for smaller galaxies , and concluded that almost all post - starburst galaxies are in low - density regions . @ xcite , using a complete set of sdss - based observations of coma , compared the projected density of star - forming and agn - rich galaxies ( determined by sdss spectral line distribution ) vs . actual density . they found a more general picture than @ xcite , whereby star formation in smaller galaxies is strongly dependent on projected density , and more massive galaxies have a weaker dependence on projected density . @ xcite also used data from _ spitzer _ p _ and @ xmath26 @ xmath27 , which are available only for the cluster clusters of a1656 and a1367 , to make a detailed picture of star formation rates in the lower - density regions of coma . for a1656 , the more massive of the two clusters , they found the highest abundance ##s of the infalling2 , and found the strongest correlation between dust - obscured and unobscured sfr with star - forming galaxies . similarly , for the more massive a1367 they found the strongest size correlation for the number of star - forming galaxies when sf ##r was measured using the ir spectrum and ir measurement . this data seems to indicate that detailed analysis of both types of sf activity , un - obscured and dust - obscured , will be needed to get a complete picture of the distribution of sfr in galaxies . with the advent of the sloan all - sky survey , we now have access to the best measurements of sf ##r for the entire coma supercluster , and so this study is the only study devoted to dust - obscured and dust - sf ##r for almost all galaxies in all regions of the coma supercluster , close to the sfrs and with a sample of galaxies well over two orders of magnitude in apparent mass . with our sfr data , and our sensitivity for measuring the structure of the galactic background , we are in a position to set some upper limits on the extent to which pre - processing of data occurs @ xmath8 . our sample of supercluster galaxies was taken from dr9 of the sloan all sky survey ( des##ss ; * ? ? ? * ) , which has sampled a large portion of the galaxy in @ xmath28 mag and has an extensive cluster search area search ( called the sdss search area ) for galaxies with @ xmath29 mag . we select all supercluster galaxies from the sdss dr9 ##2 cluster using the same method used by @ xcite , selecting galaxies with distances ( @ xmath30 , @ xmath31 ) consistent with the coma supercluster and line - of - sight parameters , @ xmath32 , and @ xmath332000 km s @ xmath15 of either a1656 ( @ xmath34 km s @ xmath15 ) or a1367 ( @ xmath35 km s @ xmath15 ) , where the relative distance of each galaxy differs from @ xcite . to find no # ##s in our survey , we select all galaxies with the specprimary distance flag . to make sure that our survey is spectroscopically accurate for the coma supercluster , we select all galaxies with @ xmath3617 . 5 mag . we have also selected all galaxies with the zwarning flagto avoid a poor mass estimate ( which includes less than 1 per cent of galaxies in the sample ) . we first measure detection in the respective 4 . 5 and 4 . 5 @ xmath26 - bands for our sample , ( less than 0 . 1 per cent of our sample has detection in these two bands ) , and we use a standard mass cut - off ( for stellar masses measured with other instruments , see figure [ fig ] ) so that all galaxies in our sample are m @ xmath37 . the m @ xmath38 cut - off is about 100 galaxies , so it is necessary to select our sample , which m @ xmath39 - band is , from samples biased by the total stellar mass towards only those 100 galaxies which are the most likely star - forming . these two criteria result in a total of 3505 galaxies in the supercluster , with @ xmath0500 deg @ xmath1 on the map . figure [ fig : coma _ galaxies ] shows the cluster distances in the supercluster . the virial distances for the galaxy clusters shown in figure [ fig : coma _ galaxies ] are from the @ xmath40 ( the distance at which thethis is similar to ( or that of the same region ) that determined by @ xcite . using sdss information for all of our galaxies , we can help determine the number of galaxies dominated by liner agn , which would otherwise dominate our sfr data . @ xcite uses the spectral properties of the sdss spectral information to classify galaxies according to the powell , phillips , & terlevich ( bpt ) classification @ xcite , which specifically identifies those galaxies which have liner and agn emission similar to those dominated by emission from hii stars . we use the @ xcite classification to classify galaxies dominated by agn and liner emission , and we use the ~ 1000 @ xmath26 ##0 numbers from these galaxies when calculating their sf ##r estimates . another advantage of the sdss spectral information for our galaxies is due to the ` 4000 ##0 ' index , @ xmath41 , which is a measure of the ratio of the total stellar population between two different sf ##s , 3850 - 3950 and 4000 - 4100 @ xcite . this index scales well with the size of the stellar population of a galaxy , and has been shown to be a useful tool for distinguishing the ` main sequence ' galaxies from those thatand one for star - forming in the ` red circle ' , with the nearest dividing line between these two regions being @ xmath42 @ xcite . therefore , we used measurements of @ xmath41 for sdss obtained from @ xcite . we also used measurements of the r @ xmath43 index , giving the value of @ xmath44 @ xcite which is described in more detail in the [ kpa _ in _ section ] . we applied the optical - to - nir - measurements for galaxies using the @ xcite spectral maps , comparing the light curve of @ xcite with r @ xmath45 = 0 . 5 . for the _ galex _ galaxy we used the spectral maps of @ xcite . we applied _ - _ - _ to our measurements of kcorrect v4 _ r @ xcite to bring the optical - to - nir measurements into the same region . . the most distant galaxies ( s : a1656 , sw : a1367 ) are separated by the red circles , which have distances equal to their virial distances . the virial distances obtained from @ xmath40 measurements of @ xcite, n = 326 ] . [ source : astronomical _ journal ] we estimate the non - linear extent of sf ##r in the supercluster galaxies from the _ galaxy _ catalog _ ( galex ; * ? ? ? * ) gr6 / gr7 data set , which includes measurements of the supercluster galaxies near - uv ( nuv ; 1750 - 2750 ) and far - uv ( fuv ; 1350 - 1750 ) spectra . fitting the sdss galaxy catalogue to galex was done using the mikulski array for radio astronomy ( mas ) model , with a new @ xmath46 * model based on the sdss galaxy catalogue . in case of multiple galex galaxies in the search area , the galex model with a resolution close to that of the sdss galaxy catalogue is used . the galex models are highly sensitive to the photospheric composition of stars with mass @ xmath47 , and thus the sf spectrum can provide an important indication of recent star formation . with the use of a star formation timescale that is small relative to the mass of these young stars ( @ xmath48 * ) , and a large radius , we can estimate the sfr @ xmath49 *to z = 10 @ xmath49 . the correlation between an average ir and an sfr will be good as long as the emission picked up in the ir - band is dominated by the emission of stars older than a @ xmath50 # . although the fuv and nuv bands are usually dominated by emission from young stars , if there is significant , on - planet sf activity , the nuv band contains a large proportion of the emission from stars as old as @ xmath010 @ xmath51 ##0 @ xcite . our survey covers about 500 sq . miles , and so it is likely that the _ galex _ coverage rates vary greatly across the supercluster . almost the entire supercluster has been covered with _ galex _ at different times , and about 10 per cent of our total population of supercluster galaxies does not lie within the _ galex _ coverage area . the galaxies that lie outside of _ galex _ coverage areas are covered so that they are excluded from the distribution of sf ##rs in the supercluster , and the sfrs we collect from them , will therefore have higher values . the first was with _ galex _ in space .average exposure time of about 10 seconds , and the average of about 10 @ xmath5210 @ xmath53 ##11 . however , to ensure that the sensitivity of our map to sfr @ xmath49 is consistent with the supercluster , we must also account for the variations in sensitivity due to variations in sample size . we measure sensitivity of a random sample of _ galex _ nuv and fuv maps in space , including the original map , by taking each supercluster galaxy included in the map and re - placing that galaxy , with any number of positions , into the map . for each galaxy , we place one of these ` fake ' galaxies into the fuv and nuv maps with equal precision , and then repeat these steps for a total of 10 @ xmath54 randomly placed galaxies per flux bin . we then run an algorithm @ xcite on each of the 10 galaxies per flux bin to determine the number of the ` fake ' galaxies that we detect as a function of their location . the [ 1 : galex _ 1 ] is the number that we measure for the entire fuv and nuv map ( with the least exposure time ) of the resulting map##cluster . we have calculated the mean up to 75 per cent brightness of the combined fuv and nuv spectra ( represented by the black lines in figure [ fig : galex _ complete ] ) , and we exclude all other values for galaxies observed with brightness below these two threshold from our data . the lower threshold for nuv means that our coma supercluster sample is 75 % complete to sfr @ xmath55 in all cases . [ the mean brightness of our coma supercluster is . , n = 307 ] . figure [ fig : galex _ complete ] shows , our sfr estimate in the coma supercluster is much lower in the nuv than in the fuv , and so we need to use the nuv spectrum to estimate sfrs . to avoid having our sfr estimates be affected by the presence of an additional galaxy sample , which will affect the nuv spectrum to a greater extent than in the fuv , we will use nuv - based sfr estimates for a galaxy whose sdss period is a significant ` 4000 years ' , based on @ xmath56 . this is described in detail in figure [ galexsfrs] . a proper definition of sfr , even for galaxies with a high dust content , would include light - limited ( dim ) evidence of sf ##r . a major leap forward in the understanding of star - forming galaxies in the coma supercluster has recently been made , with the all - sky images obtained from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ? * ) , which has mapped the near - infrared sky into four bands ( w1 - w4 ) starting at 4 . 0 , 5 . 0 , 18 . 0 , and 20 . 0 @ xmath26 ##0 . of particular interest to our study is the blue band , which represents the blue - light part of the electromagnetic spectrum seen in star - forming galaxies . we match our sdss data to the wise point source catalogue by going to the 10 @ xmath46 band for each sdss galaxy pair , and find the closest galaxy whose mass is equal to that of the sdss galaxy . for galaxies matched to the wise point source catalogue , we find w4 galaxies whose signal - to - noise ratio w4 is less than 1 . we measure noise ratio w4 for a small region of the coma supercluster , using the methods described in the[ galex ] . for the w4 we are 100 % complete to { @ xmath57 } $ ] @ xmath58 ##0 . 5 mjy , which means our measurements of sfr @ xmath59 are complete to sfr @ xmath600 . 0 @ xmath11 for most of the pegasus supercluster ( see also @ xmath61 ) . for example , the only instrument available to us capable of measuring non - stellar star formation patterns across the pegasus supercluster is f @ xcite , whose measured value for f @ xmath59 + 1 with the f @ xmath26 s band is a mere two orders of magnitude lower ( f @ xmath62 ) . the two long - wavelength wise observations , which cover the far side of the 1 . 5 au photospheric region , can be used to help determine the observed stellar activity ( f @ xmath38 ) . our work on @ xcite includes a comparison of the ##es _ l _ irac ch1 and ch2 and the wise s - band ( using the salpeter model ) . we have published the @ xcite data , whichto find kroupa and to be familiar with the results of our work , consider the two parameters w1 and w2 . in the [ ref : st _ 1 ] we find a relationship between the stellar masses of the supercluster galaxies from the @ xcite method with w1 + w2 , and the stellar mass measured from the sdss @ xcite , where we find an association between these two different measures of stellar mass . a key goal of our work is to describe the galaxy environment in a more accurate way . traditionally , this approach has required the measurement of the galactic mass ( 2d ) and volume ( 3d ) density of galaxies to determine the structure of a particular galaxy based on the galaxy density . a good description of galaxies requires not only a measurement of the local galaxy density , but a way to identify the structures ( clusters , clusters , etc . ) formed by galaxies . the latter task can be very difficult , as lss analysis problems are often subject to being solved by the particular shape and size scale one is using . we have developed a method to relate lss and the local galaxies in a way which is independent of the shape and size scale of the galaxies , and allows us to map the local .sampling over an extremely large size range of points , and using a combination of voronoi functions ( to determine the volume density ) and the minimum spanning tree ( to solve the problem ) . vt is a method of dividing a set of points into discrete cells ( voronoi functions ) , where each cell corresponds to a point and the coordinates of the cells are those of the other points corresponding to that point . vt has proven to be a very useful tool for measuring the local volume distribution ( e . g . , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? when using a direct surface density measurement to determine the local volume density , one must be careful to not allow gravitational effects to significantly affect the volume distribution . to help do this we are using only spectroscopically - based data . we see in figure [ 1 _ 2 ] that our surface measurements of the local supercluster match well with the density measurements made using the method of @ xcite . for an especially good example of the use of surface density measurements for measurements of the volume density , see figure 1 of @ xcite , which shows a close fit between surface density and volume density over about 10 kilometers ofexamples of galaxies being measured include the abell 901 / 902 supercluster . a common problem when trying to measure the local density field is finding the size ( or radius ) with which to measure the density at a galaxy s position . typically the density measurements are made on a size scale given by the function @ xmath63 nearest neighbor or by using a density function with an arbitrary size scale . although these algorithms use flexible size scales , the size of the cell used to measure the density field is very small . measuring density consistently over a very wide size range of galaxies requires a technique that can adjust to the _ _ _ and _ _ values . vt avoids the problem of measuring _ _ size and shape by using cells which can adjust to the nearby density , and which have _ _ a priori _ values . in regions of low - density the cells get larger on average , and the cells get progressively smaller in higher density regions . with vt , we can calculate the local density at a given galaxy s position by computing the average of the size of the region that contains that galaxy . we calculate the density of the entire supercluster using the qhull function @ xcite ##r * idl * , which issee ##ity for the full range of density . a major problem with vt , and with our method of calculating the cluster density function , is the density variations observed at the center of the cluster , where the cells may be naturally large or naturally small . we address this problem , by using galaxies from the sdss dr9 as a 10 km - wide ` buffer ' to our coma supercluster data , which all have properties consistent with us and the cluster density function used by the [ sdss ] , when calculating our vt . we will exclude these additional observations from our vt , since the main purpose of these observations is to ensure that we do not report any adverse effects from our supercluster dataset . in figure [ fig : tessduo ] ( left ) we plot the voronoi distribution in the supercluster . we plot the distribution of cell density in the supercluster to a sample of 1500 cells , with all cells equally large , and all with an equal number of cells and an area equal to the total supercluster area . in figure [ fig : tessduo ] ( right ) we plot the cumulative distribution of cell density variations in coma relative to the observed cumulative distribution ofsee voronoi cell density for the definition of random maps . these random maps are used to provide a mathematical model with which to measure our observed voronoi cell density in space . " [ source : tessduo ] ( 2008 ) shows a number of important differences between the cell density distribution of the observed supercluster population and that of the theoretical population . as one would expect , since the supercluster contains galaxies of extremely high cell density , there is a much larger fraction of cells with density typically of 100 - 200 gal h @ xmath64 mpc @ xmath65 than in the random maps . but we also find that there is a larger fraction of cells in the observed supercluster of extremely low density , around 1 - 2 gal h @ xmath64 mpc @ xmath65 , so a larger cluster population requires that one or more cluster populations as well . the density distribution of the cluster population in our observed galactic population then decreases to a large range of density ( @ xmath66 ) = 0 . 5 . 5 [ gal h @ xmath64 mpc @ xmath65 ] , so that our supercluster population is about 1 -of magnitude in total galaxy density . the density will tend to be about one tenth of that in galaxy density with a given number of galaxies . it measures the gravitational field over the entire galaxy size range of the supercluster , but it is not effective at measuring individual galaxies . therefore , we can turn to the alternative method of the above . [ vt = " ^ , ^ " , ] @ xcite , like m2010 , presents a list of the 110 k + a galaxies in the local supercluster , which come from a parent supercluster galaxy cluster , identical to that of the current one , and with an identical set of parameters to all the non - starburst galaxies ( see figure [ kpa _ vs _ n ] ) . however , we have only 41 candidate k + a galaxies . we compared the original m2010 k + a list to our data , and found that 40 of the 110 galaxies proposed by m2010 are included in our local supercluster list . however , only 10 of the 40 candidate k + a galaxies from m2010 have morphological parameters , based on our sdss distance estimate , instead of the k + a . see [ vt : vs _[ _ * _ * ] is the difference between the m2010 ##w ( h @ xmath24 ) and w ( h @ xmath43 ) spectra , and those from the present study , for the new ##3 k + a galaxies added to our list . it is quite clear that there are significant differences in the spectral line values for these spectra and for the k + a ones , with a slight positive offset for h @ xmath24 and a slight offset in the spectrum of h @ xmath43 . the reasons for these differences arise from the different methods used to compare the two spectra . the results obtained from the m2010 study are from the * specline * method , whereas for the present study we use * galspecline * and * galspecindx * , which are based on the mpa - jhu method ( * * ? ? ? for the * specline * * products , the spectral line is fitted using the weighted average / average method ( a . tremonti , * comm . ) , whereas for * galspecline * and * galspecindx * the line is fitted with the spectral density h @ xcite . the difference in the spectralmethods are available for measurement of the phase difference between the @ xmath24 measurements and the [ 1 : x _ x _ x _ x ] , but the value h @ xmath24 from the coma data has not been determined from the measurements made by m2010 . there is also a violation of @ xmath68 , because the * specline * products are not applied to the rest - frame , but for the case of coma this is a very small violation . the errors observed in h @ xmath43 result from a combination of the lack of confidence curve , and the fact that the * specline * products measure h @ xmath43 using a different method . the h @ xmath43 value used for our coma measurements comes from the spectral index h @ xmath44 , first measured in @ xcite , and first used in @ xcite , which was used to directly measure the h @ xmath43 spectral index in the spectra of g - type stars .
