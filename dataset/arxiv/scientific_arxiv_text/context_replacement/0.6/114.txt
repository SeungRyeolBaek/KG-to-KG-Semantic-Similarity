the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) gauge is one of the most important methods to study the non - perturbative nature of quantum field theory . the difficulties of the use of the sd gauge for the ##s are well - known . however , the corresponding coupled equations for the local and global fields of yang - mills theory have been studied extensively in the u ( r ) theory . @ xcite in this case , we write the sd equations for the @ xmath0 yang - mills theory in the local abelian ( ma ) gauge and solve them directly in the ir ( r ) gauge region . the ma gauge is used to study the yang - mills theory from the starting point of the local field . in the ma gauge , in contrast to the usual sd gauge , we must first separate the diagonal components of the gauge from the off - diagonal components . this is not the case as in the perturbative case in the ir region . @ xcite also , we must take account of the coupled equations for the local field , on - diagonal ghost , local ghost and off - diagonal ghost . the analysis of the propaga##tors in the ma gauge are also used in the si model . @ xcite example , we derived the sd ##e from the @ xmath0 ##w - mills equations in the ma gauge @ xcite . the graphical representation of the equation is given in the [ 1 : sde ] . = . 001 .

( [ e : off - diagonal ghost ] ) and ( [ e : off - diagonal ghost ] ) , we obtain the relations @ xmath28 and @ xmath29 . in the case of @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 , from the ex . ( [ e : diagonal ghost ] ) , we obtain the relation @ xmath32 so that @ xmath33 is larger than @ xmath34 . in the case of @ xmath35 and @ xmath31 , we can replace the scale of @ xmath8 and @ xmath36 with @ xmath37 since terms from the first term of @ xmath8 are related in time by the ansatz ( [ e : acc ]) . then we obtain the value of the second term of the form factor @ xmath8 . in this case we obtain the relation @ xmath38 from the equation . ( [ x : a gauge ] ) note that @ xmath33 is no larger than @ xmath34 . next , we consider the case of @ xmath30 and @ xmath39 . as well as the above results , we can replace the form factors @ xmath6 and @ xmath40 with @ xmath41 and we obtain the relation @ xmath42 ( @ xmath43 ) . finally , in the case of @ xmath44 , we obtain the relation @ xmath45 ( @ xmath43 ) . the results are given in : [ tbl : einstein gauge ] . @ xmath32 & @ xmath42 @ xmath35 & @ xmath38 & @ xmath45 [ tbl : einstein gauge ] in the case other than the einstein gauge , that is , @ xmath46 , the assumptions and results are slightly different . however , the above results are equivalent tothe above formula allows for the following starting points . in this case , as if @ xmath39 , there is no term as in the previous two cases 2c and 2a . this is because the off - diagonal ghost term has the angular - momentum dependence for @ xmath46 , and so is equivalent to @ xmath47 for @ xmath22 . thus , we have the result @ xmath48 in the case of @ xmath39 . ( see also [ tbl : not einstein gauge ] . ) @ xmath30 & @ xmath32 & @ xmath48 @ xmath35 & @ xmath38 & @ xmath48 [ tbl : not einstein gauge ] in the ir region , the scale factors of the term are as @ xmath49 @ xmath50 @ xmath51 . the result is that the full casimir effect is suppressed in the ir region , while the on - diagonal ghost and off - diagonal ghost terms are suppressed in the ir region . our results are consistent with the theory of abelian groups @ xcite .
