theoretical descriptions of photonic optical fibers ( pcfs ) have traditionally been limited to the solution of classical field equations . in the most common case , the plane wave propagation method with periodic boundary conditions is the @ xcite . other methods , such as the multipole method @ xcite , take advantage of the periodic ##ity of the plane waves and to further exploit the periodic ##ity of the air - holes . the reason for the use of these methods is the highly nonlinear optical cross section of the pcf for which no symmetry is required . the goal of this work is to obtain a set of theoretically valid empirical equations describing the optical properties such as curvature and mean - curvature properties of the pcf based on the relevant optical properties and . we assume the crystal structure as described by _ _ _ @ xcite and extend our study to fibers that are of pure gold with a high index of 0 . 444 . the air holes of the @ xmath1 are arranged in a spherical shape with a center , @ xmath2 . in the center the air hole is formed by a very small point , known as the optical core . a detailed picture of such a core is shown in the corner of the adjacent figure . image . [fig1 ] . depending on the model , the network includes both single - and multi - core fibers with different surface properties as well as guided fibers . the results presented below are the # ##y sizes , @ xmath3 , from 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 and x sizes , @ xmath4 , from about 0 . 05 to 1 . the model is based on the plane - wave propagation model with the boundary of @ xcite . for the majority of the results , the size of the super cell was @ xmath5 resolved by @ xmath6 plane waves . for calculations of the scattering index alone , the super cell was reduced to a smaller size resolved by @ xmath7 plane waves . when trying to propose a general formulation for the pcf it is necessary to look for a formulation similar to the @ xmath0parameter obtained from standard fibers @ xcite . however , this simple formulation is not put forward since no wavelength - based intensity - based scattering index can be obtained . therefore , we instead propose a version of the @ xmath0parameter for the pcf resolved by @ xcite @ xmath8 although this formulation has the same basic mathematical properties as obtained from standard fibers ,the nonlinear ##ity of the pcf is taken into account . in ref . ( [ vpcf ] ) , @ xmath9 is the frequency dependent effective index of the fundamental mode ( fm ) and @ xmath10 is the relative effective index of the first fundamental mode of the first fundamental crystal , also called the first mode field model ( fsm ) . for a more detailed discussion of this expression and its relation to previous expressions we return to ref . @ xcite and see below . we have also shown that the first - fundamental mode cut - off can be confirmed with the criterion of @ xmath11 @ xcite and shown that this criterion is approximately equivalent to the fundamental - mode boundary conditions from the multipole model @ xcite . thus the cut ##off conditions have also been confirmed for @ xcite . further , the criterion of @ xmath12 is the first observation @ xcite that the relative effective mode field radius of the fundamental mode , @ xmath13 , independent of @ xmath12 varies over a large frequency domain of @ xmath3 . the effective field of @ xmath14 is given by @ xmath15 and corresponds to the @ xmath16 curve of thethe normal distribution with the same squared variance , @ xmath17 , as the normal distribution itself @ xcite . in the right panel of fig . [ fig1 ] , the values of @ xmath12 as function of @ xmath18 are calculated for @ xmath3 ranging from 0 . 05 to 0 . 25 in excess of 0 . 05 . in ref , the curves are seen to have different values based on @ xmath3 . the first horizontal line shows the two - point curve @ xmath11 . in the left panel , @ xmath13 is calculated as function of @ xmath12 for each of the two points in the right panel and is where the curves merge into a single curve . an equivalent expression for @ xmath13 can be found in ref . the curve is seen to grow larger for large values of @ xmath12 and the mean - square error decreases toward a larger value when @ xmath12 becomes larger . in ref , it turns out that @ xmath19 for @ xmath20 and @ xmath21 for @ xmath11 . in the right panel of fig . [ fig2 ] , curves grow to small values of@ xmath12 is shown in a @ xmath4 versus @ xmath3 plot . in the right figure , values of the @ xmath13 are shown , shown in a @ xmath4 versus @ xmath3 plot . since there is a strong coupling between @ xmath13 and @ xmath12 @ xcite the curves will have the same shape . when using a pcf a combination of @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 is in principle possible . however , in both cases the coupling will be weak allowing the coupling to extend beyond the curve and into the region of @ xcite leading to a higher value of @ xmath12 . in the other case , the coupling will be very strong allowing for the introduction of higher - order modes @ xcite . since both modes are tolerated by @ xmath12 the only neglected region in the @ xmath4 versus @ xmath3 plot can be neglected . this is shown in fig . [ fig3 ] where the upper limit is shown to be @ xmath22 where @ xmath23 . how such a region that can be neglected is of course not known . however , for @ xmat##h24 scattering - loss problem is a common problem in pcfs with a high film thickness . in non - linear pcfs it is for these reasons more expensive for the pcf than @ xmath25 and that a large number of gas - filled holes are required to achieve an acceptable level of scattering at @ xcite . however , we see that the longitudinal coupling effect is not obvious from the short - range . [ ref . @ xcite the scattering - loss problem is described in terms of the focal [ @ xmath26 $ ] , the lens and the fsm . in general scattering - loss due to longitudinal cross - coupling occurs when @ xmath27 , and a pcf with a smaller @ xmath27 will in general be less sensitive compared to one with a larger @ xmath27 . for @ xmath28 we can obtain ref . ( [ vpcf ] ) for @ xmath29 from which it is clear that a larger value of the @ xmath0parameter is preferred to a smaller value . in ref . ( [ fig3 ] ) it is not desirable to be restricted to the s - axis at ( @ xmath30 ) .in fact there is a slight upper limit to the value of @ xmath4 which cannot be ignored because when @ xmath31 one automatically assumes that @ xmath32 @ xcite . although the @ xmath0parameter is a convenient way to calculate the pcf , the limiting factor for the fig . ( [ vpcf ] ) is that a special formula is usually required for calculating the optical wavelength . in conjunction with solving for the parameter @ xcite it would also be possible to use an ordinary formula , based on the wavelength , @ xmath33 , and the optical parameters @ xmath1 and @ xmath2 . for fig . [ fig4 ] , we use @ xmath12 . values of @ xmath4 ( data points shown in red background ) for @ xmath3 range from 0 . 05 to 0 . 25 in excess of 0 . 05 . each data point in fig . [ fig4 ] is equivalent to a function of the form [ vpcf _ fit ] @ xmath34 + { } \ ] ] and the fit is determined by the corresponding data points . ( [ vpcf _ fit _ fit ] ) is not based on any of the aboveof the two - it is then obtained by trial and error in order to obtain the best fit of the values with the largest possible number of free parameters . according to the analysis , the data sets are restricted to @ xmath35 since @ xmath36 covers this area ( see the section of fig . [ fig1 ] ) and the result is therefore not directly known . , viz . ( [ vpcf _ fit _ v ] ) the free parameters @ xmath37 , @ xmath38 , and @ xmath39 depend on @ xmath3 values . in order to obtain this data , the functions ( also obtained by trial and error ) are applied to the data sets for @ xmath37 , @ xmath38 , and @ xmath39 . we assume that the functions are then given by the following : @ xmath40 @ xmath41 @ xmath42 the following set of parameters , viz . ( [ vpcf _ v ] ) , is our mathematical model for the @ xmath0parameter of the pcf with @ xmath4 and @ xmath3 as the two free parameters . for @ xmath43 and @ x##math44 the equation yields values of @ xmath12 which are larger than @ xmath45 from the experimental data obtained from fig . ( [ vpcf ] ) . the term extended single - mode ( ep ) refers to pcfs which regardless of structure , contain the same extended single modes of the single mode @ xcite . in the case of the @ xmath0parameter this corresponds to structure for which @ xmath46 for and @ xmath4 @ xcite . as shown in the right section of fig . [ fig1 ] this corresponds to two large gas bubbles . however , from the data in fig . [ fig1 ] it is very difficult to determine the exact @ xmath3 structure for which @ xmath11 for @ xmath33 = 0 . from fig . ( [ vpcf _ 1 ] ) it is easily shown that the structure can be derived from @ xmath47 fig . [ fig5 ] from this example , where we have extended the data in fig . [ fig4 ] to @ xmath48 . from the intersection of the half line with the half line we see that @ xmath49 .the result is . from the . ( [ x _ 1 ] ) we get @ xmath50 and the result from the previously derived value is within the limits of the empirical expression . there are many issues to consider when designing a pcf . in this paper we have addressed the mode / multi - mode issues as well as those related to mode - angle , / mode - angle , and mode - angle . we have shown how these issues can be addressed via the @ xmath0parameter . based on these numerics we have derived an empirical expression which allows for the calculation of the @ xmath0 - value with the measurement error and block - size as the only dependent variables . we believe that this result is a significant step away from the use of purely theoretical calculations in design of solid state pcfs with complex through - plane geometry . we thank p . j . folkenberg for the paper and p . j . hansen for their support from the danish academy of engineering sciences .
