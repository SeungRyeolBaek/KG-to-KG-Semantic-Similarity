there is evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at a range of distances ; smbhs with between @ xmath3 m @ xmath1 are observed in large galaxy clusters ( e . g . magorrian et al . 1998 : ferrarese 2002 ) , and the smbhs of galaxies [ which have been observed at distances as high as @ xmath4 ( li et al . 2001 ; li et al . 2003 ) ] are estimated to be between @ xmath5 m @ xmath1 ( see e . g . li et al . ) for the direct observation of smbhs , when considered in a general framework , suggests that smbh ##s may be a rare occurrence . if this is the case , the gravitational waves ( gws ) generated during smbh formation are a good candidate for detection by the _ _ _ _ _ _ ( lisa , folkner et al . 1998 ; flanagan & hughes 1998 ; flanagan et al . 2001 ) . estimates of the smbh formation rate depend largely on the relative abundance of smbhs in galaxies , and also on the physical parameters for the structure andformation of smbhs . in a typical cdm model , both the smbh formation models [ in which a large population of smbhs forms via migration and / or fusion ( eg . volonteri et al . 2003 ) ] and bulge formation models [ where smbhs form simultaneously with bulge in halo ( eg . kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) ] are consistent with the present - day presence of smbhs in the halo ( menou et al . 2001 ) . the formation of a smbh may be restricted to shallow regions at a certain depth . if so , then there is a very high virial depth ( @ xmath6 ) at which the halo can potentially form smbh ##s . if @ xmath6 is high ( eg . @ xmath7 k ) , then smbhs are present in all halo , and the event rates are on the order of 5 events per year ( wyithe & smith 2003 ; haehnelt 2004 ) . this event rate would be much lower , less than 1 per year , if @ xmath8 k and smbhs occur only at the center of the halo( haehnelt 2004 ) . calculating the detection rate has the potential to solve the entire smbh model [ with the possible exception of the detection rate of massive black hole ( bbh ) mergers , in [ snr ] ] . the rate of events detected by lisa depends on the characteristics of the gw signal and the # ##ed sensitivity curve . previous estimates of the detection rate have used continuous ( rather than time - varying ) gw signals to determine the detection rate ( wyithe & smith 2003 ) we have estimated the rate of detected events by comparing the sensitivity curve with the observed magnetic field strength due to the bbhs ( sesana et al . ) sesana et al . ( 2004b ) calculate the lisa detection rate for a global mathematical model for smbh mergers . we perform the following theoretically rigorous calculations for the lisa detection rate of smbh mergers using a global model that uses the signal to noise ratios ( snrs ) to determine detection limits . in [ snr ] we describe the prediction of snrs for the lisa rate of bbh mergers . in [ rr ] we describe our prediction of the smbh detection rate , and our estimated detection rate , , andfor the relative abundance of smbhs , , and the @ xmath9 @ xmath10 ) . finally , we write our decay rate , as a function of @ xmath6 ( [ cl ] ) , and with [ concl ] . in this table we have @ xmath11 , @ xmath12 , @ xmath13 , @ xmath14 km s @ xmath15 mpc @ xmath16 km s @ xmath15 mpc @ xmath15 , @ xmath17 and the decay power law with the @ xmath18 was measured by the _ _ space imaging program _ ( wmap , spergel et al . the rate with which bbhs decay is highly variable . first , the smbhs slow down toward the point of the collapsing halo due to positive feedback from the dark matter halo until they form a stable halo ( begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ) . the efficiency of this process depends on the orbital separation of the two dark matter components ( van den berg et al . 1999 ; colpi , rossi & governato 1999 ) . after the orbital separation ( @ xmath19) however , three - body interactions with stars that fall within @ xmath20 of the bbh range of mass ( the ` ` loss cone ' ' ) can increase the energy losses . depending on the orbital ratio of the binary and the mass ratio of stars , this process can result in a [ [ mass ratio ( @ xmath21 ) @ xmath22 stellar mass ratio ( @ xmath23 ) ] binary system . if this continues until a point , where energy losses are reduced by gws , the binary will collapse . yu ( 2002 ) showed that the rate of bbh decay depends on the time - frame for bbh decay during the hard core phase . during this phase , three - body interactions between the bbh and binary stars force them into highly elliptical orbits , raising the hard core temperature and increasing the mass ( eg . volonteri et al . the slowing of the decay rate is caused by the rapid decay of stars in the loss cone ( because of the ##ization where angular momentum is large enough that they pass through the bbh ) , resulting in a population of stars that can extract energy from the binary system ( see yu 2002 ) . )in the absence of planets which can cause it , we find this phenomenon difficult to explain . two - body gravitational interaction is likely to result in the expansion of matter back into the loss cone ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . it is unlikely that this mechanism alone can explain these observations . several many - body simulations have been performed to study the effects of the bbh expansion on the gravitational field ( due to two - body interaction with matter ) , which reduces the effective size of the loss cone and may prevent the star from forming ( quinlan & hernquist 1997 ; milosavljevi ' s & merritt 2001 ; chatterjee , hernquist & merritt 2003 ) . other mechanisms which may explain expansion of the bbh into the gw ##b phase have been proposed , including the formation of molecular clouds ( yu & rix 2000 ) , planetary and triaxial mass loss ( yu 2002 ) and expansion into a new smbh ( rees & rees 1992 ) . the mechanism of bbh expansion is of particular interest for lisa emission studies . whilst undoubtably still an open question , we believe that there are several ways to extract the required energy from the ray ##leigh . for the purposes of our study ( [ 1] ) we therefore conclude that transition of the system to the gw - state occurs with an amplitude ( @ xmath24 ) of 1 . all the factors discussed in this article are equal to @ xmath24 . the gravitational wave propagation process of bbh ##2 can be divided into three distinct phases ( brown 2002 ) . the process begins with the _ inspiral phase _ , with the smbhs gradually forming into small clusters due to the gradual loss of gw energy . eventually the clusters become spin invariant and the smbhs slowly merge to form a single star ( _ merger phase _ ) . the resulting gw phase can be modeled by considering the resulting binary as a single kerr smbh ( _ ringdown phase _ ) . the details of the inspiral and ringdown phases are well understood and computational models for the gws have been developed . however , many aspects of the ringdown phase depend on the details of the merger phase and must be determined from the parameters of the simulations ( see [ ringdown ] ) . detection of gws from a binary star system can be aided by the presence of galactic and sub - galactic gw sources , and the lisa detector sensitivity to gwsfrom these three events . the filter template ##s would not be able to separate the gw ##b from each other event ( bender et al . 2001 ) . the snr for a single filter template ( @ xmath25 ) is given by the product of the following distributed strain and noise spectrum : @ xmath26 where @ xmath27 is the fourier transform of the dimensionless noise and @ xmath28 is the maximum frequency of the filter . we calculate snrs for the normal phase ( or the peak phase ) of the inspiral phase . the average period of the ringdown phase is much less than one year and we also calculate ringdown snrs for the peak phase . estimates of lisa ##s strain spectrum are consistent with requirements for the instrument design . a recent instrument design method ( bender 2003 ) provides a ( dimensionless ) strain spectrum [ defined as @ xmath29 , for @ xmath30 and one year of operation ] with a non - power - law slope of @ xmath31 for frequencies of between @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 khz , and a power - law slope of @ xmath34 for frequencies of @ xmath35 to @ xmath32m . flanagan ( 2003 ) found a very small frequency cut ##off at @ xmath36 hz , roughly corresponding to the lowest possible frequency for a very small binary . lisa may be sensitive to frequencies close to @ xmath37 hz . as a general rule @ xmath38 is sufficient for the accurate detection of the binary ( hughes et al . 2001 ) . as the spatial separation of the stars increases , both the amplitude and phase of the inspiralling signal increases . to calculate the inspiral phase snrs , it is necessary to consider the time dependence of the signal on the ratio of signal to noise . we do this using the method developed by flanagan & hughes ( 1998 , see fh98 ) . fh98 requires that s - phase snr ( @ xmath39 ) be re - calculated in terms of the emitted gw - spectrum @ xmath40 @ xmath41 where @ xmath42 is the frequency of the gw . this is related to the emitted gw spectrum ( @ xmath43 ) via the linear model of the binary [ @ xmath44 . the inspiral phase signal can be directly derived to first order fromthe quadrupole frequency for the burst frequency is ( fh98 ) @ xmath45 where @ xmath9 and @ xmath46 are the two bbh frequencies corresponding to the half mass @ xmath47 and full mass @ xmath48 . numerical simulations of bbh frequencies show that this frequency is constant until @ xmath43 hz @ xmath49 hz ( fh98 ) which approximately corresponds to the burst frequency when the ##ized bbhs have an angular separation of 2 schwarzchild ##ts ( @ xmath50 ) . this frequency is the upper root of unity in time ( [ x _ z _ snr ] ) . since the gw frequency of bbh frequencies also varies with time , this frequency can be used to estimate the inspiral and merger phases . the average gw frequency of the inspiral phase at the observed frequency @ xmath51 corresponding to the merger phase is given by ( fh98 ) @ xmath52 ^ { 1 / \ } { ^ { \ } } . \ { { 1 } \ ] ] depending on the signal parameters , @ xmath53 may be called the lisa frequency . wenamely , the product of @ xmath54 and @ xmath55 as the upper bound of z _ z ( [ z _ z _ snr ] ) . we use the method described by hughes ( 2002 ) to calculate snrs for the ringdown phase . bbh decay is predicted to occur in a typical smbh with a bar - like model of the event horizon ( hughes 2002 ) . this version of the kerr model can be known as the bar - like [ @ xmath56 ] - like model ( kokkotas & hughes 1999 ) . the kerr time dependent mode is described by an amplitude dependent signal with a ( linear ) amplitude ( @ xmath57 ) whose amplitude depends on the amplitude of the bbh self - wave ( @ xmath58 ) produced during the ringdown phase ( @ xmath59 ) , the decay frequency , and the atomic number of the decay process ( @ xmath60 ) . the result is @ xmath61 ^ 2 , \ ] ] where @ xmath62 is the comoving distance to the nucleus at time @ xmath63 . the transfer function ( @ xmath64 ) is predicted tothe p - value of the gw is ( @ xmath65 ) = @ xmath66 . the second term in the ( [ 1 ] ) stands for the peak strain value for the initial bbh = ( fh98 ) . computer simulations show that @ xmath67 ( smith 2001 ; fh98 and discussed below ) . we have @ xmath68 . assuming that the distribution of the number of particles ( @ xmath69 ) is that of the inspiral momentum , the dependence of @ xmath70 and @ xmath71 on the distribution of the particle ' s momentum ( @ xmath72 ) and its strain [ @ xmath73 ] given by ( smith , holtz & smith 2002 ) @ xmath74 where @ xmath75 ; \ \ \ nonumber \ mathcal { a } _ { \ rm } & = & - [ \ mathcal { a } _ { \ rm rd } ( \ hat { r } . \ hat { r } ) , \ hat { r } \ ] ] @ xmath76 is the initial ringdown gw , and @ x##math77 for the lowest state . thorne ( 1985 ) , echeverria ( 1989 ) and recently holtz & hughes ( 2002 ) have proposed the ##s for @ xmath78 and @ xmath64 in terms of @ xmath79 and @ xmath60 : @ xmath80 , \ ] ] @ xmath81 which is equal to @ xmath82 per state . hughes & blandford ( 2003 ) note that the value of @ xmath60 may depend on the role that smbh ##₂ plays in smbh synthesis . we use hughes ( 2002 ) and for @ xmath83 . the energy strain [ @ xmath84 ] the sum of the energies of each state multiplied by the total impulse response . [ @ xmath85 ; thorne 1987 ] for a detector with the ##s divided by the axis @ xmath86 to @ xmath87 @ xmath88 for @ xmath89 , the upper limit is small and most of the energy released during the ringdown phase is concentrated in the lower ringdown region ( @ xmath90 ) . in this case the snr will be large##d ##nr ( smith 2002 ) @ xmath91 for regions with the same ##ward inspiral snr we find the snr by solving ( [ rd _ snr ] ) for the selected regions of @ xmath92 . more complex bbh will produce gws at lower frequency and for a much higher frequency the ringdown signal is at a higher frequency [ see also ( [ rd _ oneyr ] ) & ( [ rd _ fits1 ] ) ] . even if the original signal has a lower frequency going down and / or increasing rapidly with frequency , solving for the ringdown signal can produce more complex bbhs . we find that ringdown signal can produce phases of phases with frequency equal to @ xmath93 , @ xmath1 ( @ xmath94 ( @ xmath1 ) and @ xmath95 ( @ xmath96 ) . in the right hand corner of the [ snr _ 1 ] we find the snr for the inspiral ( _ solid - solid line _ ) and ringdown ( _ solid line _ ) signals of same frequency , @ xmath95 bbh , as a result of point - to. the right hand figure shows the relationship of ringdown to inspiral snrs , with the first parameter being the mass range in which the ringdown signal is detected . the snr is higher in the ringdown signal for @ xmath97 than @ xmath1 . we note that there is a range of smbh masses ( @ xmath98 , @ xmath1 , @ xmath99 ) for which bbh ##2 is observed only in the ringdown signal . since these masses increase with @ xmath100 , this mass range decreases with time . for @ xmath101 , the mass range is equal to the maximum smbh mass observed in the early 1990s ( @ xmath102 , @ xmath1 ) . these values are consistent with the observation of fh98 and to the fact that detection for the mass from the ringdown signal can have effects on the high frequency smbh mass . the high resolution of the ringdown signal from smbh masses has the potential for their detection if the high frequency signal has a power - law value of @ xmath103 and a lower cut - off ( compared to the low massof the observed background noise , ( bender 2002 ) . however , it is possible that frequency dependent sources of sb # ##s result in a very high - resolution noise , ( bender 2003 ) . in addition to the background noise , the gws from certain types of star clusters are expected to affect lisa s sensitivity ( see sesana et al . ) , sesana et al . ( 2004b ) found that bbh background only affects the background ( at the frequency of @ xmath104 ) , and this frequency is about an order of magnitude lower than the background lisa s . thus the background bbh background should not significantly affect lisa s due to supermassive bbh background . estimates of the merger rate of dark matter stars are given by the modified miller - schechter ( 1974 ) model ( lacey & johnson 1993 ) . we compare the merger rate per halo of mass @ xmath105 per unit mass with halo of mass @ @ xmath106 and @ xmath107 and @ xmath108 . the average ( full - scale ) merger rate of smbh ##s ( @ xmath109 ) is at the sameinterval ( @ xmath110 ) can be calculated ( e . g . wyithe & smith 2003 ) by integrating the halo merger rate ( @ xmath111 ) and the born - schechter dark matter halo mass ratio ( @ xmath112 ) as follows : @ xmath113 where @ xmath114 is the comoving mass per unit contact distance between @ xmath63 and @ xmath115 and the term @ xmath116 stands for time - dependence . the sum of the two smbh mass ratios [ @ xmath117 ] the host smbh merger contributes to the halo merger rate . interval ( [ reaction _ time ] ) has the following important properties . we have an observationally strong dependence of smbh fusion on the halo mass [ @ xmath118 , [ [ mbh _ reln ] ] . the merger rate @ xmath109 is given by the time for formation of the host smbh mass , at @ xmath119 , where the fusion @ xmath120 occurs . in terms of the snr @ xmath121 we consider halo fusion where the smthe star takes longer than the present epoch to return to the surface of the solar system , since the bbh will still have time to decay . this is achieved by measuring the merger rate relative to star counts with mass ratios greater than 1 ( colpi , rossi & governato 1999 ) . we assume the production of smbh ##s during these events , making our estimate of the merger rate a constant . the merger rate increases with the number of bbhs that fall into the gw ##b halo ( @ xmath24 ) . we also assume it to be efficient . this last assumption will increase the cd ##s of our star count ( although this value may be exaggerated , see sesana et al . 2004a ) , but should have no effect on estimates of the future merger rate . merritt et al . ( 2003 ) studied the evolution of the relationship between @ xmath9 and the radial velocity of the first star ( @ xmath124 ) compared to @ xmath125 in a sample of ultra - massive agn . they found no evidence for deviation from the previously proposed relationship ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt 2000 ) @ xmath126 ferrarese( 2002 ) showed that the velocity distribution of the inner galactic halo agrees with the relative motion of the outer surface of the galaxies ' center @ xmath127 , showing that @ xmath128 . 2 that there is an extension of the @ xmath124 @ xmath129 model , and comparing @ xmath129 to the virial ##ization of a virialised halo of mass @ xmath105 @ xmath130 ^ { 5 / 6 } \ \ & \ right & \ left ( \ frac { n + 2 } { aligned } \ right ) ^ { 1 / 2 } { \ rm ##l } ^ { - 1 } , \ right { 1 } \ ] ] [ where @ xmath131 , @ xmath132 and @ xmath133 are the overdensity of a virialised halo of mass @ xmath63 ] we can obtain the solution of @ xmath9 @ xmath10 ##5 ( corresponding to the radial velocity from ferrarese 2002 ) @ xmath135 ^ { 5 / 6 } . \ ] ] the @ xmat##h9 @ xmath10 ##7 has been observed only for cosmic rays in the galaxy @ xmath136 ( ferrarese 2002 ) . corrections to the halo size estimates [ porciani & madau 2000 ; kochanek & smith 2001 ; kw2001 ] and new models for the ##s ( smith et al . 2000 ; kw2001 ) show that galaxies with @ xmath137 and @ xmath1 tend to contain stars and clusters of stars . this may increase the number of more active smbhs relative to the number of other dark matter galaxies . in addition , effects from radiation from the sun , and also from the stellar wind are known to inhibit starformation in active galactic nuclei ( see barkana & smith 2001 and discussed below ) , and may also inhibit smbh formation . in the next section , we present an observationally significant smbh mass distribution ( @ xmath138 ) that directly accounts for these effects . a model which assumes that all dark - matter galaxies have smbhs ( e . g . wyithe & smith 2003 ) would also increase the smbh formation rate . if we assume that all darkand in galaxies with virial masses greater than the observed mass of the central smbh [ with mass derived from the @ xmath9 @ xmath10 ##5 , see ( [ mbh - mhalo ] ) ] . we test the mass balance model of dark - matter predicted by @ xmath139 by comparing the radial velocity profile of the galaxies with the density profile that is derived from the maxwell - schechter g - function , and which yields a relationship between the baryonic and virial masses ( see [ p _ vel ] ) . and by the observation of changes in the velocity relationship between @ xmath9 and the radial velocity of the central galaxy , we find that the fraction of galaxies of radius ( @ xmath105 ) and mass ( @ xmath63 ) that form a central smbh is determined by @ xmath140 instead of us [ cf . @ xmath141 . observations of the radial velocity of galaxies and the fraction of the gas in the central region of the galaxy where the velocity profile differs significantly from the one obtained by navarro , frenk & colleagues ( nfw ,1997 ) for cdm . most star formation models ignore the effect of the cooling of matter on the inner density and energy profiles of galaxies and their changes due to starformation . the cooling and collapse of the ' s baryonic halo into a more stable state changes the inner density profile , resulting in a higher peak circular velocity ( @ xmath142 ) than predicted by the velocity profile ( dalcanton , spergel & wang 1997 ; li , li & wang 1998 ; gonzalez et al . 2000 ; kw2001 ) . to calculate the inner - density profile , mo et al . ( 1998 ) assume that the baryonic and dark matter components are approximately equally distributed in the nfw ##f profile with density parameter @ xmath143 , energy parameter @ xmath77 and specific angular momentum @ xmath144 . the peak circular velocity of the inner density profile can be determined by self - similarity tests ( with angular momentum and energy constant ) for the expansion factor of the original halo . for a galaxy with specific angular momentum equal to that of the original halo , the circular velocity is related to the virial velocity by ( mo et al . 1998 ) @ xmath##145 ) n - body simulations of the halo ##s find the observed halo mass to be approximately independent of halo mass and equal to at @ xmath146 ( bullock et al . ) , the density function of the nfw ##f can be related to the observed virial mass @ xmath147 ( at @ xmath139 ) and @ xmath148 ( bullock et al . we find the value of halo mass in the halo region to be @ xmath149 , independent of halo mass . the cooled velocity fraction is assumed to be higher for more massive stars ( @ kw2001 ) , but we find that causing @ xmath150 to vary with halo mass as predicted by the gas model of kw2001 has no effect on the value of the adiabatically cooled velocity function . the halo cooling velocity function can also be derived from the psmf using the formula of m @ xmath151 for a cooled baryon fraction ( @ xmath150 ) that is independent of mass , this formula results in : @ xmath152 dependence of cooling velocity on halo mass for @ xmath153 m @ xmath154 m @ xmath1. . , the net effect of this new linear relationship is to estimate ( and re - calculate ) the young - schechter value of the virial velocity . to calculate our occupation fraction we assume that there is a radial velocity for which we have an occupation fraction of 1 . we then use the ( linear ) relationship between halo and virial velocity that supports this assumption . we then used the same radial velocity model developed by kw2001 for this calculation . kw2001 calculated values corresponding to @ xmath155 , and @ xmath15 . from this we start with the linear power of @ xmath156 with @ xmath157 ( allowing for a light curve with front - end velocity @ xmath158 ) . this process produces a halo expansion velocity ( @ xmath142 ) which , at the end of the occupation fraction , is consistent with the value derived from the observations of wang et al . ( 1998 ) to be @ xmath159 per second . therefore , our velocity is consistent with the value of @ xmath160 derived from the lensing observations ( seljak 2002 ) . the halo occupation fraction ( ) : [fig2 ] ) starting at @ xmath161 km s @ xmath15 ( @ xmath162 km s @ xmath15 ) . this radial velocity is also consistent with the same speed at which einstein - schechter and other mass density models converge in the work of gonzalez et al . ( 2000 ) and kw2001 . van den bosch et al . ( 2002 ) provide an example of the effect of galaxy formation efficiency on observed galaxy formation via the average galactic mass - to - light ratio . this ratio can be calculated by analyzing the mass - energy relationships using the ratio between ( time for ) observed galaxy - forming halo ##s and time - ( for ) particle mass ( see van den bosch et al . their work provides a maximum mass - to - light ratio ( indicative of high galaxy formation efficiency ) for dark galaxies starting with @ xmath163 at @ xmath1 , which is equal to the ratio of @ xmath164 at @ xmath165 at @ xmath1 . the mass ratio decreases significantly for halo ##s larger than @ xmath166 km s @ xmath15 . we note that , in @xmath138 km s @ xmath140 did not match our expected decay rate due to the exponential decay of the psmf . however wyithe & smith ( 2003 ) found that finding a lower cut - off to @ xmath138 with a virial temperature of @ xmath167 km s @ xmath15 had no effect on their results . prior to the reionisation of the halo , it required a virial temperature higher than @ xmath168 k for the halo ##s to form via molecular phase transition in the halo region . after reionisation of the halo , the high critical temperature allows the formation of gas into phases with virial temperatures lower than @ xmath169 k . these virial temperatures determine the critical temperature of the halo out of which the smbh will form ( e . g . barkana & smith 2001 ) @ xmath170 ^ { - 1 . 5 } \ \ \ right \ left [ \ frac { \ omega _ m } { \ omega _ m ^ z } \ frac { \ omega _ z } { { \ omega ^ z } \ right ] ^ { -1 / 2 } \ left ( \ frac { n + 1 } { 1 } \ right ) ^ { - 1 / 2 } , \ left { 1 } \ ] ] equivalently , the minimum virial depth is the minimum value for the initial mass ( or core , or mass ) of a region in which an smbh may exist . using the @ xmath9 @ xmath10 method , the ( [ mvir ] ) gives a minimum smbh mass ( @ xmath171 ) which is independent of temperature . for @ xmath172 m ( @ xmath173 k ) this minimum smbh mass corresponds to @ xmath174 m @ xmath1 ( @ xmath175 m @ xmath1 ) . in general , the relatively large majority of smbhs occur in very stable regions with virial depths lower than @ xmath176 m , although this lower temperature may be partly due to the difficulty of obtaining experimental data for regions with @ xmath177 ( e . g . kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . the observed expansion rates are shown in figure [ fig3 ] as a function ofthe effective virial temperature ( lower axis ) and the smbh temperature ( upper axis ) . the event rates per year decline with increasing @ xmath6 . for @ xmath178 m ( @ xmath179 ) @ xmath180 we expect @ xmath181 events per year for each of the ringdown and inspiral phases . these predictions fall far behind those of wyithe & wilson ( 2003 ) , with the difference due to our assumption of the smbh occupation fraction of the event rate . our smbh occupation fraction and other selection factors result in observations that decline more rapidly with increasing @ xmath6 than the models predicted . smbhs for the stars are @ xmath182 m @ xmath183 m @ xmath1 . if @ xmath184 is @ xmath185 the observed event - rates are very low ; somewhere between @ xmath186 and @ xmath15 for this case . the lisa does not predict events from the individual components of the two phases . however , there is evidence for smbhs as large as @ xmath0 m @ .##math1 for large galactic nuclei ( ferrarese 2002 ) and high - density , high - mass agn ( johnson & johnson 2004 ) . a typical value for the minimum smbh mass is 1 @ xmath187 / @ xmath1 , which leads to estimates of @ xmath188 events per year for this model . figure [ fig4 ] shows the average ##s of events as a function of the minimum virial mass . most of the events occur at @ xmath189 due to mergers with stars more distant than @ xmath190 and @ xmath1 . sesana et al . ( 2004a & b ) provide models for the average time of inspiral - bbh events for a new smbh formation phase ; 1 @ xmath191 ` ` ' ' ' after 10 years of activity due to mergers at @ xmath192 . this model provides a new model for the formation and growth of bbhs observed in an active debris disk . sesana et al .

( 2003 ) in which ( 1 ) the density is##hs ##s and @ xmath193 begin at @ xmath194 and continue via expansion and contraction during large galaxy ##s . while we do rely on the decay rate of dark matter particles for the calculation of our growth rate , our calculation is by using mass based models for the number of smbhs per halo . we do not assume the process leads to the formation of galaxies ( and by extension smbhs ) in large and small halo , but we have assumed that the size of the galaxy # ##ally determines the growth rate . we have assumed an accelerated evolution of smbh ##s , and sesana et al . ( 2004a ) provide a simplified model for their evolution that results in the galaxies being isolated from the halo itself ( where they do not exist ) . we specify an upper bound for the rate of supermassive bbh formation ( where the halo masses are less than @ xmath195 m @ xmath1 ) of @ xmath196 m @ xmath15 , which is lower than , or equal to , the @ xmath197 m @ xmath15 calculated by sesana et al . 2004a& search for a system with no source other than @ xmath195 and @ xmath1 . if intermediate mass black holes exist , then our estimate for the observed emission rate increases only slightly [ compared to the previous mass estimates for intermediate mass stars ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) ] to @ xmath22 billion per year ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . we have calculated the snr of both the inspiral and ringdown signals of smbh ##s , and the frequency and time ranges over which bbh emission can be detected by lisa . the higher frequency of the ringdown signal allows detection of the presence of more massive star systems . in addition , searching for multiple sources for the ringdown signal allows a better detection of bbh emission in smbhs which are more massive than @ xmath198 and @ xmath1 , and a better detection of the presence of smbhs over the frequency range @ xmath98 m @ xmath1 at @ xmath95 should they exist ( see @ xmath199 m @ xmath1 at @ xmath96 ) . we have calculated the radiusof the black hole systems modeled by lisa , a simple model in which black holes exist in systems with virial mass of a certain value and with an observationally motivated model with a mass and radius of the universe @ xmath200 . guided by the fact that the masses of both large and small galaxies fall short of the expected number of dark - matter galaxies , we estimate the maximum predicted event rate . this is done by comparing the observed cooled gas velocity function with the observed young - schechter ( 1974 ) velocity function . our predicted event rate increases rapidly with the potential for the maximum smbh that can occur . if we are constrained by the maximum possible halo ##s known from the galaxy , and the low - mass agn ( @ xmath201 and @ xmath1 ) , then we expect @ xmath188 events per year . many of these systems can be detected via measuring their low - mass inspiral and ringdown periods . our observationally motivated estimates for the detection rate of bbh will also show that observations of the bbhs provide a good model for lisa . the authors want to include david wilson , george melatos andavi asked for the support during the publication of this paper . sesana , s . , haardt , k . , madau , m . , & volonteri , m . 2004b , apj , 253 ( astro - ph / 0409255 ) smith , j . a . , gebhardt , m . , salviander , m . , smith , j . a . , xie , y . , brotherton , j . a . , wang , y . , & wang , y . 2003 , apj , 583 , 124
