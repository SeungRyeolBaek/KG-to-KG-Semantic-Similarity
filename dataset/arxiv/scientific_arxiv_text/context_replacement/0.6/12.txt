studies of charm decay are useful for several important reasons . first of all , there is the possibility of directly studying new physics in the standard model ( sm ) , since the amount of cp violation due to sm processes is significantly reduced allowing new physics processes to be more easily observed than in @ xmath8 , where the sm processes also have large contributions @ xcite . @ xmath1 decay ##s is useful because it could result from either sm or nuclear physics ( nm ) processes , and could teach us valuable lessons . another important reason for pursuing charm studies is that all @ xmath8 particles , @ xmath999 % , decay into nm , so observation of charm decay is very useful for @ xmath8 decay studies . also studied are spin branching ##s , atomic interactions , multi - particle systems , scattering , dalitz transitions , etc . . many heavier particles such as heavy quarks decay into @ xmath8 , and higgs particles also decay with large contributions to @ xmath10 , thus making charm studies useful . furthermore , charm studies teach us a great deal about weak interactions , strong coupling , and the weak interaction . this has been studied in @ x##math11 experiments at large , both by the type i experiment and more recently by bell and cleo - x , have measured @ xmath11 production , and by the particle and wave experiment , @ xcite . the two experiments are very different at present than in previous experiments . the @ xmath12 production transforms into @ xmath13 ; the resulting total cross - section is 3 . 82 @ xmath140 . 09 production for @ xmath15 production and 3 . 82 @ xmath140 . 09 production for @ xmath16 + @ xcite . @ xmath5 production was measured at 4170 mev , where the cross - section for @ xmath17 + @ xmath18 + @ xmath91 + @ xcite . the " other " continuum " background is about 1 ev . the relatively large cross - section , relatively large mass , and high energy , allow one to " use " @ xmath19 as a reference . " since the mass and energy of the particle are not yet known , the rest of the data can be analyzed for properties of the " continuum " background .to determine the energy level , for example at the @ xmath12 , the distribution of the energy is first reconstructed , as well as the background . then the @ xmath12 @ xmath19 and final states are calculated by first measuring the difference in the energy , @ xmath20 , of the decay states with the same background . states with @ xmath20 consistent with this are reconstructed and then the @ xmath19 on - line energy is calculated , @ xmath21 where @ xmath22 dominates over all the final state transitions . examples of single and double tags are shown in detail . [ cleo - single ] ( a ) that shows the @ xmath23 distribution for either @ xmath24 or @ xmath25 decay states . these " tags " show a large energy and a very small background . [ cleo - double ] ( b ) shows a single " tag " where the @ xmath3 and @ xmath26 states from the same background are shown . " for candidates from either @ xmath24 or @ xmath25 " . ( c ) the @ xmath27 distribution for distributions for candidates from @ xmath24 and @ xmat##h25 ] . the solid curves are a fits to the signals plus the backgrounds , that are indicated by the dashed shapes . the signals are symmetric due to radiation of the electron beams . , title = " fig : " , width = 302 ] distributions for candidates from either @ xmath24 or @ xmath25 modes . ( 2 ) the @ xmath27 curves for distributions for candidates from @ xmath24 and @ xmath25 modes . the solid curves are a fits to the signals plus the backgrounds , that are indicated by the dashed shapes . the signals are symmetric due to radiation of the electron beams . , title = " fig : " , width = 294 ] these algorithms make use of the data the first alpha decay of charm to identify the decay , and the sequence @ xmath28 , which also serves as a hash code in the case of @ xmath29 modes . for alpha - decay , only a certain frequency ratio sets the threshold for detection of the decay ##s , that are determined according to charm . for @ xmath2 and @ xmath3 these ratios are @ xmath30 and @ xmath31 , respectively . cleo - ., on the other hand , a special case where the branching ratios of all modes are calculated simultaneously and not independently . consider an ensemble of particles @ xmath22 , that is both absolutely stable and not absolutely reconstructed , where various combinations of modes can be observed . we count the number of the single tag neutral particles as @ xmath32 , double - tag particles as @ xmath33 , and double tags as @ xmath34 . they are related to the number of @ xmath13 particles ( either neutral or neutral ) by their branching ratios @ xmath35 and @ xmath36 where @ xmath37 and @ xmath38 are the same ##s for single and double tag events for each mode . ( in general the differences in the ratio between single and double tag events are , , and @ xmath39 . ) from these results we get @ xmath40 cleo - 1 has recently improved their original branching ratio by using the 281 ##2 @ xmath41 data sample , an estimated 10 times larger data sample than used by them for their original measurements @ xcite . the latest experimental results are presented in the [ ref : dbr ] @ xcite .( in this case when the errors equal in magnitude , the first error is arithmetic and the second statistical ; this will be used for the values given in this table unless otherwise noted . ) the absolute branching ratios for these modes have been calculated with great precision . comparing the pdg results with the original cleo - c results for @ xmath2 and @ xmath3 modes , and with the cleo - c results for @ xmath5 , we find @ xmath42 cleo - c does not give the branching ratio for @ xmath43 , because of errors on the dalitz scale . the @ xmath44 and the @ xmath45 modes should be used for comparison . since all of the @ xmath46 decay rates have been measured and compared to the @ xmath47 mode , to calculate the absolute branching ratio @ xmath48 these numbers can be used for various purposes . for example , adding up the number of # ##es that in the @ xmath49 mode decay to the @ xmath50 mode , calculating the @ xmath2 , @ xmath3 , @ xmath5 , and , and calculating thecharmonium has only a value of 0 . 09 @ xmath140 . 04 , where the only decay comes from the @ xmath2 decay . there is no experimental limit for @ xmath52 % . the experimental limits available are @ xmath53 % and @ xmath54 % at 95 % c . l . the limit for @ xmath55 of about 95 % is large enough to cover an enormous area . there are also signs that it may be naturally occurring . smith finds consistency with no mixing at 3 . 5 % c . l . in left - sign @ xmath30 % and smith finds consistency with no mixing at 3 . 5 % c . l . in right sign @ xmath56 % , thus making the studies very interesting . there have not been any signs of cp / t violation . this project is funded by the national science foundation , project # 0553004 . 2008 . m . artuso , m . asner , m . faccini , m . malvezzi , m . menaa , m . onysi , m . sia and m . stroiney for the results and the tools and methods used in this project . m . artuso, " interactions in the standard model and beyond , " in _ proc . of the _ int . symp . _ electron & proton interactions at high energies _ , ed . j . brenner , j . m . de los santos , and m . rathsman , world scientific , springer ( 2006 ) [ j - ph / 0510052 . m . malvezzi , @ xmath19 - " dalitz deviation from theory , " proceedings for the conference on interactions in particle and plasma physics ( cipanp 2000 ) , quebec city , quebec , canada , 26 - 28 may 2000 . reprinted in aip conf . proc . * 549 * , 569 ( 2002 ) . the @ xmath57 modes are @ xmath58 , @ xmath59 , and @ xmath60 , that sum to 3 . 93 @ xmath140 . 95 times @ xmath61 . the @ xmath62 modes are the analgous modes to those for the @ xmath57 and , inaddition , feeddown from the @ xmath57 mode ; they sum to 3 . 93 @ xmath140 . 95 times @xmath61 . a . petrov , " flavor : a review , " " looking at flavor theory and cp ##t ( fpcp 2003 ) , paris , france , 4 - 6 jun 2003 ; reprinted in econf c030603 : mec05 ( 2003 ) http : / / www . slac . stanford . edu / econf / c030603 / . c . godang _ _ ( cleo ) , phys . rev . lett . * 91 * , 5038 ( 2000 ) [ ap - ex / 0001060 ] . j . a . abe _ et al . _ ( focus ) , phys . _ * 618 * , 2000 ( 2005 ) [ - ex / 0412034 ] . j . abe _ et al . _ ( focus ) , phys . lett . * 91 * , 071801 ( 2005 ) [ - ex / 0408125 ] . m . aubert _ et al . _ ( focus ) , phys . rev . lett . * 91 * , 171801 ( 2003 ) [ ap - ex / 0304007 ] . j . a . aitala _ et .. _ ( e791 ) , phys . b * , 34 ( 1999 ) [ ap - ex / 9903012 ] . j . martin _ et al . _ ( belle ) , phys . lett . d * 485 * , 34 ( 2000 ) .
