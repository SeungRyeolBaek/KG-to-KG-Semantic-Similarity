in recent years electron transfer ( et ) between molecular molecules and semiconductor nanomaterials and surfaces has been subject of intense experiments @ xcite . the transfer of an electron into the absorption bands is a fundamental step for a number of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical research applications such as spectroscopy , laser energy conversion , quantum dot lasers , etc . the et between two molecular molecules and a semiconductor surface is the simplest of all such reactions : it involves only the transfer of one electron , and therefore no bonds are broken @ xcite . the ultrafast nature of the electron transfer from molecular molecules to the absorption bands of semiconductor surfaces was demonstrated in the experiments @ xcite . the sensitive nature of these experiments requires an exact understanding of the et dynamics to be able to model the time - dependent phenomena known as relaxation . this can be done using the diffusion density matrix ( rdm ) method used in the above experiments . in @ xcite the charge transfer from the molecule to the semiconductor absorption band was modeled using the time - dependent schrdinger method , while ignoring relaxation processes . the existence of relaxation processes was confirmed by the experimental observation that the effects disappear completely after 10 ms of theperylene - tio @ xmath0 ] . if we consider it to be possible to model a large number of systems where , for example , the whole system is surrounded by a heat bath , and at equilibrium . in the rdm , the whole system is divided into the relevant system part and a heat bath . thus the system hamiltonian consists of three parts the system part @ xmath1 , the relevant part @ xmath2 , and the heat - bath part @ xmath3 : @ xmath4 the rdm @ xmath5 is derived from the density matrix of the whole system by integrating over the degrees of freedom of the system . this , together with the second - order perturbative reduction of @ xmath3 and the above model leads to the redfield equation @ xcite : @ xmath6 + { \ mathcal l } \ , = { \ mathcal l } \ , . \ { { \ : redfield } \ ] ] . this equation @ xmath7 describes the redfield interaction . if one considers the system - part interaction with system part @ xmath8 and system part @ xmath9 @ xmat##h10 operators can take advantage of the following : @ xcite : @ xmath11 + [ \ lambda \ lambda , k ] + [ k , \ lambda \ lambda ^ { \ lambda } ] . \ { { { : pf - 1 } \ ] ] the @ xmath12 operator can be written in the form @ xmath13 where @ xmath14 is the term @ xmath8 in the vector approximation . the resulting wave function is assumed to be linear in the local coordinates as well as in the interaction coordinates . neither the vector approximation nor the linear approximation has been used . the so - called linear ##ized approximation which has some advantages @ xcite is not useful because it could lead to negative results for the general case of @ xcite . in the following we turn our attention to et , an interacting ground state and an excited band . the hamiltonian of this state consists of the ground and an excited band of the system and a quasi - product of the excited states , with the excited state @ xmath15 and @ xmath16 to be applied to @ xmath17 for the ground state , @ xmath18 for the excited band , and @ x##math19 for the non - trivial . as in ref . @ xcite we take the frequency of the transition state to be @ xmath20 . the coupling between the ground state and the transition state is assumed to be linear : @ xmath21 . a cone - shaped spectral density of e is assumed . instead of modeling the reaction from the ground state , we use the @ xmath22 - model . the ground state potential energy surface is chosen 0 . 1 along the z axis with respect to the ground state potential energy surface . this results in an excited plane model based on the ground state with positive energy and the corresponding one - electron transition state . the coupling between the ground state energy surface and the transition states is 0 . 1 . the harmonic system is described by the spectral density @ xmath23 . because all transition states have the same frequency the coupling to the system can be described by values of @ xmath24 in the thermal frequency domain . dividing the invariant ##s of the harmonic system by @ xmath25 the frequency of the coupling is given by @ xmath26 . to be able to understand the mechanism of coupling we .not even the e - band with such a large number of electronic states as in above . @ xcite . in that model a band of width 3 ev was modeled with an energy difference of 2 . 75 mev corresponding to 801 electronic states . these calculations are very difficult . # ##let theory become almost simple using plane - wave methods . for calculating such a large number one would have to use the monte carlo distribution function of @ xcite . we use a much simpler model and consider only that part of the electronic band which actually takes part in the injection process . the total size of the electronic band will be much larger . in the model , a band of width 2 . 75 ev is treated with five electronic surfaces . on each of these electronic surfaces , electronic states are taken into account . we are aware that this is not a linear model but rather that it ignores the effect of time on the electron injection process . here we look at two different processes involved in the process of electron injection . the time - dependent population of the electronic states of the electronic band is defined as the sum of the energy differences of the electronic surface @ xmath27 . as a second example we look at the time - dependent population of the electronic states ofthe ground - state @ xmath28 . these two probability distributions give some information about the mechanism of absorption . figure 1 shows the energy distribution for the quasi - continuum , i . e . the energy distribution of the absorption band , versus the energy of the excited band . as shown above , the two lowest energy states are separated only by @ xmath29 . the distribution shown on the top right of fig . 1 was first described by ramakrishna et al . and can be shown using the golden ratio . the electronic states of the quasi - continuum are represented by @ xmath30 where @ xmath31 is the maximal vibronic distribution in the ground state and @ xmath32 and @ xmath33 are the vibronic distributions of the wave functions in the excited and quasi - continuum states , respectively . the symbol @ xmath34 represents the energy of the band . based on these two properties can be seen . first , the electronic populations in the excited state of the band no longer only relax into the quasi - continuum states but also relax into the ground state ( see fig . 1 ) . second , the electronic populations also relax into the quasi - continuum states . the rec##urrences back into the ground state are much slower . only those parts of the wave function which are not high enough in energy can travel back to the ground . in fact , we extend the work of ramakrishna , willig , and others @ xcite ##s of these results into the study of electron transport into the absorption band of a semiconductor . this will , at least , be useful for understanding electron transport in the case of a crystal containing the semiconductor atoms .
