one interesting feature that has emerged out of the more than 100 extrasolar planet discoveries to date is the wide range of orbits observed . in our own solar system , most of the extrasolar planets which are not tidally locked to their host star have low orbits ( @ xmath1 ) , and many others have high orbits ( @ xmath0 ) . these observations have suggested several theories as to the nature of the observed extrasolar planets . one proposed mechanism , two - body resonance , occurs when two small planets orbit several astronomical units ( au ) from the host star and then interact , with one in an eccentric orbit and one orbiting the other @ xcite . this mechanism has been used to prove the existence of the @ xmath2 and the larger @ xcite , which contains a hot planet as well as two small planets in highly eccentric orbits . @ xcite is a hypothetical scenario in which two protoplanets orbit each other and interact to form a single massive , hot planet with @ xmath3 and @ xmath4 masses . interactions with stellar winds are a possible way to boost the number to ##2 . of the 13 planets orbiting a star with @ xmath0 , 12 have an obto find low - mass planets in five planetary systems : hd 3651 @ xcite , hd 20782 @ xcite , hd 80606 , hd 89744 @ xcite , 16 cyg bb , and hd 222582 @ xcite . if the inclination difference between the planetary companion and the stellar companion is large , the kozai mechanism @ xcite can explain large - scale changes in the inclination of the planet ( e . g . malmberg et al . these effects can be explained by both tidal effects and gravitational interactions with other planets , and they are particularly pronounced in encounters with a giant planet in planetary orbit @ xmath51 ) from the central star @ xcite . the kozai mechanism has been used to determine the orbital inclination of 16 cyg b @ xcite and hd 80606b @ xcite . @ xcite . the inclination of 16 cyg b in the system likely to be between 90 and 95 degrees , where 90 degrees is the edge - on inclination . however , it is the difference in inclination between the orbital planes of the planetary and stellar companions that is important in determining the accuracy of the kozai mechanism , and the inclination of the planetfigure ##2 is also not suitable for earth - like planets . of the 192 known planetary systems , 15 ( 25 % ) are multi - planet systems . the discovery of new planets in systems known to have at least one planet @ xcite suggest that multi - planet systems are possible . of particular interest are systems which contain a hot planet and a low - mass ` ` hot neptune , ' ' e . g . @ cnc ( = hd 75732 ) , gj 876 , @ xmath6 arae ( = hd 160691 ) , gl 777a ( = hd 190360 ) . inspired by the discovery of hot neptune in known planetary systems , we have begun an extensive search of known multi - planet systems to search for possible low - mass planets . three of the planetary systems discussed in this section ( hd 3651 , hd 80606 , hd 89744 ) are part of this search . the high radial - velocity resolution of the high resolution images from the wise - eberly telescope ( wise ) , combined with real - time , allows us to interpret the data in such a way as to detect any changes in the orbit of the new planets , and thus to move quickly on any new planets .. the analysis of the data in this work is discussed further in @ xcite with respect to the planet of hd 37605b . in this work , we attempt to integrate the data for the planets in these star systems with the data generated by n - body simulations . the simulations address the question : what other planets are ( or are not ) in these systems ? the new models also address the question : where are other planets located ? part 2 discusses the observations and the new model models for six known binary star systems : hd 3651 , hd 37605 , hd 45350 , hd 80606 , hd 89744 , and @ cyg ##1 . we have selected these planets based on two criteria : ( 1 ) each has a planet with @ xmath0 , and ( 2 ) each has been observed with the planet search program at mcdonald observatory . part 3 , we review and discuss the results of the new model simulations , experimental data , and upper bound calculations . five of the six planets used in this work have been observed with the mcdonald observatory 1 . 5 - meter - eberly telescope ( sam ) and the high resolution spectroscopy ( hs ) @ xcite . a brief description of the new planet modelsthis is available in @ xcite . for the cyg system , observations from mcdonald observatory were made simultaneously with the 1 . 5 m harlan e . smith ( hjs ) telescope ; the long - term planet search data for this system is given in @ xcite . the available astronomical data from these observations are combined with our data from mcdonald observatory and the standard swift program . to determine constraints on the stability of planetary systems , we would like to explore where different planets may exist in different orbits in the vicinity of the same planet ( s ) . we will perform numerical simulations [ swifthal / comet . . . ] @ xcite to determine the theoretical possibility of finding low - mass planets in any of the planetary systems mentioned above . low - mass planets can be used as test particles since the difference of angular momentum with other particles is small . we recommend the large non - interacting symplectic system ( rmvs3 ) version of swift for its ability to detect close encounters with massless , non - interacting test particles and planets . planets are found if they are ( 1 ) closer than the proper distance to the star , ( 2 ) closer than 0 . 05 au to the star , or ( 3 ) closer than 1 au from the star . since theone of these simulations was to determine the distance in which the planets could exist in circular orbits , we chose this new approach because the existing method of radial - velocity data could only detect planets at great distances . the test particle systems were set up using the data found in @ xcite , with the result that all the circular orbits were used in this study . for each particle system , test particles were placed in the circular orbits starting at 0 . 002 au and the end at 0 . 05 - 0 . 06 au . we had decided to focus on this study because the accuracy of our high - resolution simulation ##e is only about 3 - 4 % for the planets in this study . the test particles were combined with the new data , which had the effect of extending the simulations to three years . the physical parameters for the circular orbits of each planet were taken from our keplerian model as found in 2 . 0 , and from the data for both cyg ##1 @ xcite and hd 45350 @ xcite . the physical parameters were used to determine their absolute masses ( for @ xmath7 ) . the parameters were tested for @ xmath8 times , for @ xcite and the rest of the simulation in a short time . wenote that nearly all of the vacuum - tube simulations occurred during the initial @ xmath9 cycle ; by this time , the planets had all returned to their original orbits . we have the keplerian orbit data for hd 3651b , hd 37605b , hd 80606b , and hd 89744b in table 1 . a summary of the data used in our calculations is given in table 2 , and the new radial measurements are given in tables 3 - 5 . the radial measurements obtained for the new planets are local variations only , and do not include any other sources of error such as ` ` ` noise . ' ' the data for the first two planets , hd 45350b and 16 cyg b , were derived from @ xcite and @ xcite , respectively . the radial measurements from the telescope are given for hd 45350 ##b @ xcite , and those for 16 cyg b from the hjs instrument are given in @ xcite . starting with @ xcite , the new het measurements were combined with those from mcdonald , and the radial velocity of each planet was combined with its keplerian orbit by gaussfit @ xcite , and the brightness differences between each planet .to determine a free parameter . analysis of the fit to our keplerian model ruled out no evidence for other planets in any of the other observations in this set . the low - mass ( 1 * @ xmath10 ) planet hd 3651b was discovered in @ xcite using data from lick and keck . we used these data , which were collected in @ xcite , in conjunction with data from the hjs and observations from mcdonald observatory . the original data , which consisted of two observations per day , is determined by the mean - square weighted rms value of the velocity of each observation . the standard deviation of the measurement is used in addition to the weighted rms of the mean value to determine the mean value of the data ##set ( r = 1 ) . the rms of the average value for this dataset is : lick & keck6 . 2 , het9 . 2 , hjs12 . 2 . the measured free parameters for hd 3651b are of equal value to those used in @ xcite , and consistent with the @ xmath11 . the recent analysis of the cross - match to hd 3651 @ xcite is an important one : does the radial - velocity method apply to this planet ?caused by the process of orbiting the star ? we have a trend of @ xmath12 and @ xmath13 , meaning that we are now able to see a trend which is closely related to the binary system . however , the value @ xmath14 of the het ##h is only slightly affected by the presence of a linear trend ( @ xmath15 = 0 . 5 ) . the values shown in figure 1 were derived from the data which did not show a trend . we have 23 different orbital parameters for hd 37605 , since the announcement by @ xcite . the trend would show a period of 1065 days . the same result was obtained , for the trend of @ xmath16 and @ xmath13 , indicating a circular parent star . such a result would lend support to the hypothesis that many large multiple - star systems result from encounters with a close binary system . the minimum period that this binary system could have and would be consistent with the linear trend and the variations in the timespan of the system is @ 10 days , indicating a circular orbit . this system would also show a low activity in the brown dwarf region . the trend of hd 80606 , as announced by @ xcite , is themost of extrasolar planets known , with @ xmath17 ( table 1 ) . we then use the coralie data in combination with the keck data given in @ xcite and the data from het . the radial velocity values produced by this combination greatly increase the accuracy of the prediction to the precision of the data . since the errors of the het data given in tables 1 - 5 are rounding errors only , we start with tables 1 - 5 of radial - velocity ` ` r ' ' to fit for fitting the parameters for hd 80606 . for each of these parameter values , the calculated parameters are the same despite their differences . table 1 shows the parameters obtained from the study which added 0 . 5 of uncertainty @ xcite to the het data . the rms of the het data was : coralie18 . 5 , het7 . 5 , keck5 . 5 . @ xcite meant that the uncertainty @ xmath18 and the uncertainty of periastron @ xmath19 had to be added together by their addition to the keck data itself . however , the large number of parameters used in this analysis allowed gaussfit to work with the results obtained . for hd 89744##b , we combined data from the het with the data from the hjs ##9 and the data from @ xcite . the combined data was processed in the same way as for hd 3651 , resulting in n = 2 million times . the rms of the best fit for this dataset is : lick17 . 5 , het10 . 5 , hjs9 . 5 . as with hd 3651b , our orbital periods match with those of @ xcite and of @ xmath11 . the error in our data is small , most likely due to the star being designated f ##7 ( f7v ) , which requires more radial - velocity measurements due to the large number of spectral lines . for example , the f7v of hd 221287 was later determined to be the planet @ xcite ; despite the high - accuracy of the survey instrument , that orbital period has a mean rms of 0 . 5 . the results of the two observations are shown in figures 1 - 2 . the transit period of the two planets is plotted against their orbital semimajor axis . as shown in figure 2 , the long - period planets hd 3651 and hd 37605 will cross the star distance of about 1 . 5 au . theoutside of these regions , however , a large number of test particles remained in low - inclination orbits at the host star , apastron 1 , below the 1 : 1 mean - motion ratio ( mmr ) . in the hd 3651 system , particles were observed beyond about 0 . 8 au , which is not surprising given the low mass of the system . for hd 37605 , two broad regions of instability are shown in fig . 1 , corresponding to the 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 mmrs . the mass of the test particles in the region of the 1 : 2 mmr was between 0 . 00 and 0 . 06 . particles at 1 : 2 mmr were in phase with a lower mass , corresponding to @ xmath20 , which was probably due to tidal forcing . as with hd 3651 , the region beyond about 0 . 8 au was largely unaffected by the instability . figure 2 shows the stability for the hd 45350 and hd 80606 systems . the short period ( 963 . 5 days ) and relatively low mass ( # ##ₑ @ xmath21 = 0 . 05 ) of hd 45350b limited their stability to the ~ 0 . 6 au . these test particlesand in inclination up to @ xmath22 . the first planet , hd 80606 ejected all test particles to a distance of about 1 . 5 au , and only at 1 . 5 au do test particles remain in their orbits for the duration of the system ( @ xmath8 ##3 ) . a period of instability was observed at 1 . 5 au up to the 8 : 3 mmr . model 2 suggests that hd 89744b ejected all test particles except for a small region near the 8 : 3 resonance . for the 16 cyg b system , test particles south of about 1 . 5 au are stable , leaving open the possibility of long - term instability . the other planets vary in inclination up to @ xmath23 , but these models model the system as a secondary source , and the primary component of the system is not known . our results are consistent with those of @ xcite , which studied tidal instability in extrasolar planet systems and found that no test particles remained beyond the neutral zone of the hd 80606 , hd 89744 , and 16 cyg b systems . three of these planets ( hd 3651 , hd 80606 , hd 89744 ) ;monitored intensely with the het as part of a larger effort to search for low - mass , long period objects . no evidence was found for any other planets in these or any of the other studies in this study . we can determine what limits can be set for these planets using the high - resolution astronomical data we have collected . the method for determining these limits is similar to the one described in @ xcite , except that in this work , the well - known keplerian orbit for the target system ( figure 3 . 1 ) was determined by repeating the same experiment . in this work , we determined the radial - velocity of @ xmath24 for which 90 % of it would have been observed without the het . the sum of the two measured values was determined to be the radial velocity of the two particles from the system described in 3 . 1 . all the orbits from which the signals originated were measured in these two calculations . the results of these experiments were highly complex , reflecting the different monitoring methods used for these three systems . in particular , hd 3651 , hd 80606 , and hd 89744 were monitored intensely with the het as part of the search for long - period objects , whereas hd 37605 and hd 45350 were monitoredbut only recently the first planetary masses were measured and confirmed @ xcite , and 16 cyg a has now been detected with the hjs instrument at a rate of at least once per year . the detection limits are shown in figures 4 - 5 ; planets with masses outside the galactic radius can be ruled out with the instrument with 100 % confidence . somewhat earlier , the detection limits were obtained for hd 3651 ( figure 3 ) , which yielded a total of 195 planets , including 12 @ # ##es . for periods longer than about one year , we can detect planets with m = @ xmath21 and neptune masses . similar limits were obtained for 16 cyg b ( m = 161 ) , where the masses include 1 neptune mass ( figure 5 ) . since the detection limits can increase with the release of new data and with high - resolution observations , we can select a method to measure the strength of the limit . a good example would be @ xmath25 , where @ xmath26 is the mean number of planets , and @ xmath27 is the mean number of the radial - velocity measurements . the values of @ xmath26 and @ xmath27 are shown in figure 4 . for the hd 45350 system , the limitof the injection data are those of the detection limits above . the detection limits were observed at elliptical orbits ( @ xmath280 . 1 au ) . in this region , test particles remain stable ( fig . 5 ) and our measurements can detect planets with a mass _ _ _ between % 1 and 3 neptune masses . similar results were observed for the tight cyg ##d region , in which test particles remain stable , of @ xmath29 ##0 . 1 au . in that region , planets of 1 - 3 neptune masses can be detected from our limit measurements ( fig . 6 ) . for some of the limit measurements , there were significant ` ` black spots ' ' , where the periodogram ##s failed to accurately match the injection data . typically this occurs during the trial periods for which the full resolution of the injected data is required , and occur between the 6 - month and 1 - year periods . for observations of hd 37605 ( fig . 4 ) , hd 80606 ( fig . 5 ) , or hd 89744 ( fig . 6 ) could the data be ruled out below % 0 . 1 , and for the trial periods only , the results were much better . a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the measurement ofthe results were not followed in confidence for most of the three test systems , making the determination of the periodogram ##s difficult . this was demonstrated by the ` ` inner ' ' part of the data . however , the rms error for those three systems was too small to allow accurate orbit determination . this was only true for the f7 and hd 89744 . the three systems with the lowest estimates ( hd 3651 , hd 45350 , and the cyg ##2 ) also have the largest rms uncertainty in their orbit parameters ( rms = @ xmath30 ; # 1 ) . in fact , the largest rms for the first three systems = @ xmath31 . other factors such as the lack of data ( hd 37605 ) and long time scales ( hd 80606 , hd 89744 ) make the determination of the orbital parameters difficult for most of the test systems in this study . we have found that for a total of six known known extrasolar planet systems , there is no evidence for additional planets . gravitational field simulations show that there are planets surrounded by gravitational fields ( i . e . for @ xmath32 * ) where additional planets may exist . for hd 3651 and hd 37605 , we havethat other planets are also stable . combining these data with the data derived from the high - resolution survey data combined with currently available survey data is most useful for the hd 3651 and hd 45350 systems . the long - period data can be mapped - out to a * * ##s in the more distant regions of these systems . this project is based upon data funded by the national aeronautics and space administration , instruments no . nng04g141 g and nng05g107 g , by the national planet ##arium research grant program . we are grateful to the nasa tac for their generous use of their resources for this project . we also would like to thank barbara mcarthur for her work with gaussfit data . we thank the editor , greg laughlin , for his positive review of this project . this project has made use of the satellite transit data system ( rms ) , and the simbad system , developed by esa , toulouse , france . the schmidt -
