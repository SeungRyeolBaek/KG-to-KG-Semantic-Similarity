the process of reionization includes the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the first billion years after the big bang , and the transition of the galactic medium ( atmosphere ) from opaque to opaque . despite this knowledge , however , this is not yet fully understood . it is now well known that reionization was initiated at @ xmath14 due to activation of the ly @ xmath15 process ( e . g . @ xcite ) , and that the atmosphere was still transparent at l @ xmath4 when the temperature was less than 600 myr , based on the electron capture energy as measured by l @ xcite . however , there is still some debate about the rate of reionization . do galaxies evolve with enough speed at these early stages to produce sufficient reionizing energy ( e . g . @ xcite ) , or is the process being accelerated by other types of processes such as agn @ xcite ? observationally , recent advances in near - infrared imaging technology have greatly improved our ability to search for galaxies during this epoch . with the advent of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the _ chandra _ telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , a rapidly -knowledge of galaxy candidates at @ xmath16 is available thanks to a variety of surveys . these range from wide - field ultradeep surveys such as the galaxy ultra - bright survey ( hudf , @ xcite ) , to ongoing , large - scale surveys for @ xmath17 , either using older surveys such as the cosmic background near - infrared and deep sky survey ( candels ; @ xcite ) , or taking advantage of backward - looking observations as in the catalogue of reionizing galaxies ( borg ) survey ( ngc 11700 , 12572 , 13767 ; @ trenti ) . thus , the collection of 100 galaxy candidates at @ xmath18 is known as @ xcite , and we are expected to find the same galaxy candidates from the past 100 million years ( @ xmath19 ; @ xcite ) . these surveys bring further information on the galaxy quality factor ( lp ) available to @ xmath4 , which appears to be even more supported by another @ xcite survey , @ xmath20 , at a higher than @ xcite . however , recent studies suggest that these galaxy candidates may not be predicted as likely at @ xmath16 ,and either a single power law @ xcite or a double power law @ xcite leading to the bright end of the galaxy has been proposed . this change in the shape of the bright end is in turn related directly to the rate of star formation in the most overdense and fastest moving regions where the brightest and oldest stars are known to be @ xcite . this deviation from the schechter model could indicate a greater influence of tidal forces at later stages , which in turn would indicate an increase in the absorption of light emitted by stars . however , at @ xmath21 , the atomic number distribution of the stars is biased towards that at @ xcite , and this bias would cause the galaxy to take on a power - law shape at the bright end . however , the numbers at @ xmath22 are still too low to reach a conclusion on which galaxy is which , since only a handful of @ xmath23 stars are known . in addition to determining the age of the galaxy , the two non - @ xmath24 stars discovered by _ hst _ 1 are also potential candidates for follow - up observations to determine other physical properties such as physical and stellar properties @ xcite , and##ization ##s of the target @ xcite , and # # . for the latter , detection of the source relies primarily on detection of the lyman continuum in the galactic envelope , ( e . g . , @ xcite ) and / or of emission lines , either lyman - @ xmath15 ( e . g . @ xcite ) , [ emission lines such as ciii ] and civ @ xcite . the follow - up for detection at @ xmath25 is extremely limited , with no data on the emission lines from these sources . however , the candidate sources show some signs of confirmation based on the ongoing series of follow - ups which lead to similar results ##s to @ xmath26 @ xcite , with two additional ly @ xmath15 and at @ xmath25 @ xcite . with the aim of distinguishing the source of the brightest and most important source in the field of reionization from other sources such as candels , the consortium of reionizing galaxies , ( borg , or @ xcite ) has been carrying out low - light , forward ##ing experiments with wfc3 since 2010 . borg discovered a new source ( @ xmath27 )of @ xmath4 @ xmath28 - 1 , with @ xmath17 ( @ xcite ; see also @ xcite ) . this is a group of galaxies that are not affected by the fine structure constant ( borg , ` ` sample ' ' bias ; see @ xcite ) , which is particularly important for the galaxies found in large dark matter clusters ( @ xmath29 ) , as seen from the observations at @ xmath18 @ xcite . follow - up observations of the borg data with keck and vlt has provided evidence for an increase of the background brightness of @ xmath4 compared to @ xmath30 @ xcite . however , a new set of observations is needed , with a new data - set designed for the new detection of # ##s ##n @ xmath23 ( borg [ z9 - 1 ] ; @ 13767 , @ trenti ) . further observations from @ xmath31 of the dataset ( @ xmath32 arcmin @ xmath5 ) led to the discovery of two galaxies , @ xmath3 @ xcite with @ xmath33 , which are similar in sizeto the spectroscopically , @ xmath26 , identified by @ xcite , is much brighter than the two @ xmath34 - sources with @ xmath35 identified by the borg / candels data from the other source @ xcite . these recent results suggest that it may be possible for a large number of super - bright sources ( @ xmath36 ) to be present as long as 10 myr after the big bang . therefore , they allow us to further analyze the borg - data from sources from the previous study , which included @ xmath37 arcmin @ xmath5 , to search for the @ xmath3 sources and determine their spectral density . this section presents the results of this study , and is organized as follows : section [ section2 ] : discusses the borg dataset . section [ section3 ] discusses our search process for @ xmath3 candidates ( @ xmath38 - star candidates ) , with results presented in section [ section4 ] . in section [ lfsection ] , we determine the high - spectral density of @ xmath39 , and continue with previous data . section [ section : 5 ] continues and continues . .the times we use the @ xcite system : @ xmath40 , @ xmath41 and @ xmath42 . the times are given in the reference to @ xcite . we use data collected as part of the evolution of reionizing galaxies ( borg [ z8 ] ) survey , which consists of three borg pointings ( go 11700 , 12572 , 12905 ) , followed by the coordinated galactic observation series ( go 11702 , go yan , @ xcite ) and the gto of parallel observations . for an in - depth discussion of the survey , we refer the data to @ xcite . next , we use the 2014 ( dr3 ) press release of the survey , which consists of four borg pointings with a total area of @ xmath43350 arcmin @ xmath5 . the samples are sampled using the wfc3 / 2 filters f098 m , f125w and f160w , and in the new @ xmath44 system , using either the wfc3 f606w or f600lp filters . we refer to the wfc3 f098 m , f125w and f160w filters . the@ xmath45 , @ xmath38 and @ xmath46 respectively , and to the f606w and f600lp filters as @ xmath47 and @ xmath48 , respectively . the ##s for each instrument are on a field - by - field basis , and the @ xmath49 exposure values for the instruments and filters @ xmath50 are all @ xmath51 , with a maximum value of @ xmath52 @ xcite . we note that since the dataset comes from parallel observations when the other instrument is a computer ( ms / stis ) , there is no correlation of the two . to compensate for the lack of correlation , the borg noise analysis algorithm has been modified with a new laplacian - based algorithm designed for @ xcite . however , the lack of correlation has a negative effect ( @ xmath53 ) on the model and the data , as it has been determined by comparison of parallel ( parallel ) versus non - parallel observations of the magnetic field @ xcite . since the borg [ z8 ] instrument was designed to use @ xmath38 as its spectral baseline , parallel observations are nota single detected field in the @ xmath46 - range . to achieve a very good image analysis , if we include in the analysis only those fields with maximum exposure in @ xmath54 and @ xmath46 . this results in the loss of 5 fields out of 10 , so that the field covered by our analysis is @ xmath55 arcmin @ xmath5 . the calculation of the exposure time in @ xmath46 for the field in borg [ z8 ] is shown in borg [ fieldhist ] . the borg [ z8 ] raw data set consists of measured and averaged rms maps associated with ` multidrizzle ` @ xcite with a resolution factor of @ xmath56 , as well as the weight maps ( see @ xcite ) . using our image processing software to search for sources in the domain @ xcite , we extract rms maps from the weight maps , and adjust them to compensate for the noise caused by ` multidrizzle ` ( see @ xcite ) . in practice , this is done for each source and detector by placing the fields in the filter at the position normally associated with the fields ( i . e . the ` ` 0 ' ' position ) , and adjusting thestart with the parameters obtained from the rms measurements , which can then be multiplied by a correction factor to obtain the parameters . our measurement parameters are : : @ xmath57 for the source , and @ xmath58 for @ xmath44 ( see also @ xcite ) . in addition , the end - points are chosen to account for different distances from the line of sight , according to @ xcite . using ` sextractor ` @ xcite in multi - spectral mode , we take images of sources in the galaxy , using the @ xmath46 - based method for comparison . spectral and signal to noise ratios are calculated based on isophotal wavelengths / wavelengths ( mag _ iso ) , and we use mag _ iso for the full spectrum of the source . to select @ xmath19 - sources , we use the selection algorithm @ xcite . for high @ xmath24 , the source in the galaxy almost completely contains infrared radiation , leading to a break at the optical absorption line of ly @ xmath15 ( 1216 ) . for very low @ xmath59 , this causes a break at the @ xmath38 -scan , and re - scan , the @ xmath44 and @ xmath45 bands . our work on @ xmath38 - bands shows that our range of sources is being studied only in @ xmath46 . therefore , to reduce the risk of identifying new sources , we impose a strong limit : @ xmath46 , with s / n @ xmath60 . we can impose a weak @ xmath61 detection , reduce detector size for higher frequencies , and impose a short break : @ xmath62 , which is more difficult than the strong @ xmath63 break to multiple detectors ( e . g . @ xcite ) since we do not have the resources of multi - detector systems to map the range of sources to different wavelengths and to identify them . therefore , we impose the following limits for detection in @ xmath38 - bands : @ xmath64 when applying the @ xmath65 limit , if the @ xmath38 - band only has s / n @ xmath66 we apply the @ xmath67 limit instead . finally , to reduce the risk of artifacts from processing errors during the signal processing process , we can imposethe stellarity profile in the ` sextractor ` class _ 1 system . we have criteria _ 1 @ xmath68 , where 1 refers to a bright profile , and 2 to a low bright profile . we have visually examined the stars that meet these criteria to identify any possible orbital errors and emission lines . all the stars that meet these criteria and pass the visual inspection are listed in table [ table1 ] , and discussed below . lccccccccccc borg _ 0240 -

candidate together with 1 / 2 @ xmath87 . the candidates are detected over a range of distances , with four candidates at @ xmath88 , and two more candidates at @ xmath89 and @ xmath90 . from @ xmath91 , this leads to @ xmath92 to @ xmath93 . two candidates are detected only in @ xmath46 , while the other three are detected in both @ xmath38 and @ xmath46 . the rest of the data is shown in figure [ table1 ] , and the positions of @ xmath44 , @ xmath45 , @ xmath38 , and @ xmath46 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] . we use the redshi##fts for these galaxies , and the pre - @ xmath24 and bpz @ xcite , give a large magnitude ##i value , explained by the increase in the number of galaxies with high masses with properties similar to those of @ xmath22 * . for the single band ( @ xmath46 ) detection , the observed distance distribution is uniform over the entire @ xmath94 . for the double - band ( @ xmath38 and @ xmath46 ) detection , the observed distances are slightly reduced in @ xmath9 . the above magnitude ##s are shown in figure [ fig1 ] of the images of the galaxies . a comparison of the observed @ xmath46 candidates against the observed distances of our candidates against @ xmath21 and from the _ hst _ / wfc3 galaxies is shown in figure [ hvszplot ] . if none of our candidates are very distant at @ xmath46 , they are compared with pre - observed candidates at @ xmath39 and @ xcite . we then compare the distances of the candidates , starting from the nearest half - inch ( cm ) , toor the ` sextractor ` , which is transformed into the sample size by taking into account the effect of the point - spread function ( pp ) , and the time evolution of @ xcite . the empirical separation has been achieved by measuring and placing the source with the same size and shape into borg ##s . sample size is also important to help distinguish between high - and low - @ xmath24 sources , since the measurements of @ xcite and candels will show that @ xmath95 sources are more abundant than @ xmath96 sources with different sizes . this empirical separation can be compared to the empirical separation of sample sizes of @ xmath97 with @ xmath98 @ xcite , although a recent measurement by @ xcite shows that the sample parameters will decrease more rapidly with distance ( @ xmath99 ) compared to sample size . we describe the source of our source , in detail [ 2 ] . this source is the largest in the universe , with magnitude @ xmath100 . it was first detected in @ xmath46 at @ xmath101 , and then again in @ xmath38 at @ xmat##h102 , even though it is closer to the center of the sample . the candidate has a bright , @ xmath103 solution , with @ xmath104 . it also has a spectrum , and is @ xmath105 . its second ##al solution is also detected at @ xmath106 , with a broad higher - energy wing . this source , in the same field as the first , is detected with a @ xmath107 , making it the second - brightest candidate in the sample . it is detected with s / n @ xmath108 in @ xmath46 , and only slightly brighter with s / n @ xmath109 in @ xmath38 . it is the second bright candidate in the sample , with @ xmath110 . its ultraviolet solution , field borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 129 , is detected at @ xmath111 , with a broad higher - energy wing . field borg _ 0240 - 1857 is a third bright candidate with @ xmath112 , and with s / n @ xmath113 . this source is also detected in the same field ( @ xmat##h38 , @ xmath45 , @ xmath44 @ xmath114 ) . of the two possible candidates , this object is relatively compact , with a ~ 10 - kilometer radius @ xmath115 . this is smaller than the size of the source ( @ xmath116 ) , suggesting that it could be a point - source - type object such as a red dwarf star , although the stellarity of this object is @ xmath117 , which is less than the values expected for a point source ( e . g . @ xcite - class _ star @ xmath118 and @ xcite class _ star @ xmath119 to be closer ) . this object is close to the neighboring galaxy with @ xmath120 , with a centre - to - centre angular distance of @ xmath121 . if this compact object has an accurate angular distance estimate , it is likely to be near @ xmath122 , based on the # ##ness . using the models used for @ xcite and @ xcite , we estimate the gravitational lensing of this object . the pdfs are given by radial velocity .from @ xmath46 , , yields the same time - dependent yin - yang equation , as @ xcite and @ xcite . velocity density is the standard measure of the strength of a large gravitational field @ xcite . the angular components of the background source are represented as irregular spherical shapes ( e . g . @ xcite ) which depend on the velocity density and the effective angular distance to the source , and between the background and source ( where we get the same result - @ xmath24 ##0 ) . assuming that the background source is small @ xmath123 ( which is lensing strength ) , we find the source @ xmath124 . this source has a diameter @ xmath125 ( @ xmath126 ) , and is visible in the @ xmath46 image , with an irregular , spherical shape ( angular distance @ xmath127 ) . the source is also very close ( @ xmath128 * ) to the reference source , which appears in the @ xmath45 and @ xmath38 images . the @ xmath46 - based model is unique since : .and in a closer range than the one with visible light . we have compared the two flt images and found that since the distance between the dark pixel and the bright pixel is more than a @ xmath129 , and there is no evidence of a hot spot in the @ xmath46 - star , the identification of the source as a @ xmath38 - star is possible . this candidate is detected with a magnitude @ xmath130 , and is a / z @ xmath131 . it is not found in @ xmath38 , @ xmath45 or @ xmath44 . it has an apparent magnitude of @ xmath132 . this candidate is close to the source object ( @ xmath133 centre - to - centre - image ) . the source also has an apparent magnitude @ xmath134 , and is at an intermediate angular distance . we use the same estimation technique as for borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 1 to estimate the lensing strength of this candidate . assuming that the source is a @ xmath123 , we estimate the magnitude @ xmath135 . 5 of the flt .of this we discovered the presence of a source pixel , already known and detected by the image processing software , at the outer edge of the spectral range of the second candidate in one of the two @ xmath46 images . to determine the quality of the initial image , we measured the source pixel and the flt image together , so that the candidate is detected with s / n @ xmath136 in the source image and with s / n @ xmath137 in the image created by the bad pixel . therefore , we are confident that the candidate is stable and that the reconstruction from the original source image is correct . the third and last candidate is also detected with s / n @ xmath138 , @ xmath46 ( @ xmath120 ) , and also in the @ xmath38 with s / n = 0 . 91 . the measured brightness is also measured at @ xmath139 , with the theoretical limit at @ xmath140 . this candidate is also very close , with measured half - light at @ xmath141 , and the measured stellarity of the candidate ( x _ n = 0 . 91 ) . this candidatewith higher stellarity from a higher borg / z ##8 , a lower mass ( lower mass ) for this source is more likely , as we discussed in section [ 3 ] . to integrate the results of the selection of light sources for @ xmath3 from the original borg [ z8 ] , into a detailed signal / wave function analysis , we need to consider both the effects of radiation on our sample , and the total energy consumed by the source . there are several types of non - @ xmath24 sources that may have similar @ xmath103 characteristics to @ xmath19 lyman - alpha sources ( lbgs ) , such as galactic nuclei , high - mass galactic sources , and galactic radio sources . similarly , other stars in the same region may be the sources of our sample , although their colors have a different @ xmath103 character . with the signal - to - noise ratio , the selection of lower - source light sources from other sources by the ` sextractor ` class _ star , is not well understood . we use class _ star @ xmath143 and our definition of @ xmath38 - 1 in section [ section3 ] to describe noise resulting from theseparation occurs , but this is not a strong enough process to exclude such sources from our sample . in this case , all of our galaxies identified as @ xmath38 - band have class _ star @ xmath144 , with * borg _ 1459 + 7146 _ 785 having class _ star @ xmath145 ( a source identified by @ xcite as being of unusual dark matter ) . so we conclude that this source is most likely a radio source with unusual properties . extreme - line galaxies are a source of uncertainty for @ xmath19 sample samples . for example , galaxies in @ xmath146 with low [ oii ] emission lines are only in @ xmath46 - band because the emission line is too dark to be visible in the visible spectrum @ xcite . @ xcite showed that , at @ xmath147 , the highest density of extreme line galaxies that cover the visible spectrum is @ xmath148 per arcmin @ xmath149 , thus providing clear images of extreme - line galaxies with high @ xmath38 density and low density @ xmath150 . applying this data to @ xmath39 , weexpect to find @ xmath151 and others of this type during our search period . this prediction is in agreement with previous infrared observations of @ xmath147 borg , by @ xcite using the mosfire instrument on the keck telescope , and by @ xcite using xshooter on the very large telescope . these observations found strong emission lines in the spectrum of @ xmath147 candidates , and are expected to rule out emission lines from the non - @ xmath24 ##0 emission lines compared to @ xmath152 , suggesting that most of the @ xmath46 emission is due to a weak emission line . @ xcite will find that , with a 3hr shift , only a small portion of the spectrum ( @ xmath153 ) is so dominated by uv radiation and dominated by # ##ms that a strong emission line would not be due to @ xmath13 . the second , and probably most likely type of emission , is that of neutral and active particles that will have a strong balmer line and a very weak uv emission . under these conditions , @ xmath154 candidates will resemble those of lbgs and will beinto our database . starting with _ spitzer _ / irac , @ xmath155 and @ xmath156 , will help distinguish between high - and low - energy sources . in particular , the @ xmath123 source will be 1 - 2 times brighter in [ 3 . 0 ] and [ 3 . 1 ] than the @ xmath46 , and @ xmath19 lbgs will have a more uniform spectrum . without spitzer _ , we focus on the size of the sources and candidates for the @ xmath157 $ ] source , including those with @ xmath158 as the source . @ xcite shows that , while the mean size of sources for the @ xmath39 source from @ xcite and @ xmath72 , high - energy , irac - based sources have a mean size of @ xmath159 , they cannot be as large as @ xmath160 , and there are many non - @ xmath24 sources with sizes greater than @ xmath161 ( figure 1 , @ xcite ) . therefore , we select @ xmath162 as the source . the .the candidates in our sample are then expected to fit into these groups . the candidates found in @ xcite are smaller than the @ xmath39 candidates in our sample , and therefore it is likely that the larger sizes of borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 129 and borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 369 are due to their higher masses . using the size - density relation described in @ xcite , we find that the size of the @ xmath163 candidate for @ xmath164 ( the brightest in our sample ) would be @ xmath165 , below our threshold of @ xmath162 . this method should not be used to completely exclude extreme emission - line galaxies , which are known to be more massive . for example , @ xcite found that their threshold of six extreme emission line galaxies that fit is fwhm @ xmath166 , corresponding to our @ xmath167 values for @ xmath39 ##b . in addition to finding the average size distribution of our best candidates for bpz , we also used sed values found in @ xcite . from this , we found the average size @ xmath168 of@ xmath169 . we assume that three out of the six sources , borg _ 1459 + 7146 _ 785 , borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 129 , and borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 369 , are likely to contain contamination . for the other sources , contamination is also a possibility , and so we make a further estimate of @ xmath170 s ( two out of six s at @ xmath171 ) , based on the results from the borg [ z9 - 1857 ] survey @ xcite and the results of @ xmath168 for the candidates in their field . of the six possible sources identified in the original borg [ z8 ] survey , five of them , including the one above , were located in the same field ( borg _ 0240 - 1857 ) . the average error for this analysis is equal to the average of the results ( @ xmath172 s at @ xmath46 ) , and therefore such a finding is highly likely under the conditions of a normal distribution of sources in the six fields taken together . based on these results , the method of analysis can be used to determine the presence of three sources - @ xmath24 , @ xcite, under the general assumption that the abundance is correlated with dark - disk type ##s ( e . g . , @ xcite ) . overdensities have also been observed in @ xmath4 and lbg ##2 @ xcite . however , an additional factor , most likely with the unexpectedly large size of the sub - @ xmath34 - groups , would be the presence of an overdensity of bright and dark disk sources in the intermediate frequency range . in any case , a detailed study of this area is very useful since we can either find an extreme overdensity of the bright sources at @ xmath11 , or shed light on the existence of intermediate frequency galaxies with the @ xmath173 properties . we perform source selection experiments to increase the speed and accuracy of our calculations , at @ xcite . to do this , we identify and place the sources with an srsic index , in the data . half of the sources follow a typical vaucouleurs profile ( srsic index @ xmath174 ) , and the other half follow an ordinary profile ( srsic index @ xmath175 ) , with a range of frequencies ( @ xmath176) , shapes ( @ xmath177 ) and sizes ( normal ##ized with # 0175 ##0 @ xmath178 , same as @ xmath179 ) . the profiles of the sources are calculated by the comparison @ xmath180 with @ xmath181 ( normal distribution ) with a minimum cut - off of half - power @ xmath182 . the resulting profiles of the artificial sources are compared with the wfc3 profiles for each artificial source , before being inserted into the borg _ image at regular intervals . they are then identified with , and the probability of the detection ##s are calculated . this occurs by the calculation of @ xmath183 which is the size of the source image , that is the probability of identifying an artificial source of magnitude @ xmath184 within the source , and of @ xmath185 , which is the probability of identifying an artificial source of magnitude @ xmath184 and size @ xmath24 within the source image , assuming that the analysis is complete . an example of the detection process for the random sample of the borg _ 0440 - 5244 is .in the bottom panel of section [ figvolume ] , and the top panel of the following figure : the estimated effective volume probe of our search for the borg _ 1 as a function of the apparent @ xmath46 magnitude . + , from simulations , as a function of the apparent @ xmath46 magnitude . top panel : an estimate of the energy of @ xmath185 for the borg _ 0440 - 5244 . the selection function is recovered from simulations , by adding and removing the fields . [ figvolume ] , [ = " : : " , scaledwidth = 0 . 5 % ] from the figure in section [ below ] , we consider the three original sources to be present , because of their different light - wave energies , and we consider the mean - source field borg _ 1459 + 7146 _ 785 most likely . for the fourth source , we consider the detection power of @ xmath170 , e . g . we consider these sources to be present @ xmath3 . after taking into account the effective volume probe in our search , our estimate for the mean - field of the selection function of @ xmath3 is : .figure [ table3 ] , and shown in figure [ figlf ] . thus , we find a lower mean density of these sources than the determination of @ xcite around @ xmath186 , although the density is very high because of the large number of sources . for brighter sources ( @ xmath187 ) , our upper limits from @ xmath3 data are similar to those found in previous surveys , and provide the confirmation for us of the existence of sources at the bright - end of the distribution curve . when compared to the density data from the previous borg [ z9 - 10 ] and @ xcite , assuming that our two brightest sources are high - density sources , we do not find clusters of super - bright ( @ xmath188 ) sources in the sky covering more than half the sky . if follow - up surveys of our brightest sources showed that they are also at high density , we would still find that the density is lower at the bright end than the upper limit from @ xcite , and is therefore consistent with the determination of @ xcite around @ xmath189 . thus , our density estimate is lower , but is consistent with @ xmat##h190 with the corresponding parameters of @ xcite , shown in the corresponding images in image [ figlf ] . previous analyses did not provide accurate fit to the @ xmath3 sources , partly because of the large number of candidates . to ensure the stability of the data with our new datapoints , we decided to use schechter parameters for a maximum likelihood fit to the original sample sources , starting off with a poisson distribution for the number of candidates present in each source ( see @ xcite ) . due to the non - matching of @ xmath191 by @ xcite , the data is suppressed at the other end . this leads to a background noise that is too large over a wide range of the data set , and therefore , we are unable to accurately estimate the schechter parameters . our recent analysis clearly shows that the dataset is far too large for our time frame , and the increase in the number of candidates expected will require further analysis . therefore , we conclude that our results rest on the assumption that the two sample sources we found at @ borg _ 0240 - 1857 are candidates . if we were to include them in the set of @ xmath3 sources, we would expect that the results would show a power law at the other end , rather than a schechter effect . evidence for a single or double power - law effect at high energies has been found in observations of the source ##n @ xmath192 ( @ xcite , as originally discovered by @ xcite ) , and also at @ xmath11 and @ xcite , and can be best understood as a result of energy transfer from sources such as agn ##2 at high energies @ xcite . these effects , however , would not have this effect in the ordinary schechter - derived universe . therefore , the correct interpretation of our results largely relies on follow - up observations to confirm the existence of the candidates borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 129 and borg _ 0240 - 1857 _ 369 . in any case , it is also important to note that the number of possible sources @ xmath34 - 58 that we observe is small ( only coming from about 100 galaxies ) , making the search cost - effective , especially because most of the sources are located in a galaxy cluster . + @ xmath193 & @ xmath194 + @xmath195 & @ xmath196 + @ xmath197 & @ xmath198 in this paper we began the search for @ xmath19 ##5 using the data of the 2010 - 2014 group of reionizing galaxies ( borg [ z8 ] ) survey , a visible - light survey and near - infrared survey using _ hst _ / wfc3 . since the survey was unable to detect @ xmath4 sources and @ xmath45 - candidates , we went to the ~ 293 arcmin @ xmath5 of the search for @ xmath38 - candidate sources with @ xmath199 , followed by the identification of two candidate sources with @ xmath200 . our initial results were : * we identified two @ xmath39 - candidates , detected by @ xmath46 - m / z @ xmath6 and using the standard @ xmath65 source , with non - detection of the sources of the pair . the ' s would range from @ xmath201 to @ xmath202 . analysis of the observed brightness ##es led to the correct identification of two sources , with the two brightfive likely being high mass dwarf galaxies due to their size , and one likely being a relatively small dwarf galaxy because of the # ##ness and high stellarity . * of the five sources , three are in the largest cluster , borg _ 0240 - 1857 , with the two brightest of the three . such a scenario would be not possible if the source were @ xmath3 ( not @ xcite ) , with the data from @ xmath129 , but an alternative explanation of super - massive galaxies of intermediate mass would also be possible . * based on our current estimates of the population , we expect a larger galaxy population than for galaxies in @ xmath186 according to the results of bouwens et al . ( 2015a , b ) and with the theoretical calculations of smith et al . ( 2015b ) . however , our estimate is not consistent with the @ xmath13 ##9 with these results . * regardless of the location of the two brightest galaxies in the sample , the selection points that we use are a large number of sources , therefore useful for follow - up observations . this is not surprising , since the borg [ z8 ] model was originally consistent with @ xmath11in general , and the amount of detection could have been much higher given the presence of a strong emission line and the presence of a blue - black line to help distinguish dark and bright intermediate type galaxies . * targeted follow - up observations will help clarify the properties of the sources we identified , and to help clarify the bright - end of the galaxy and confirm the properties of the previously identified group of dark intermediate type radio sources that match the properties of @ xmath203 galaxies . the importance of targeted follow - ups and the continued ability to support searches for @ xmath3 galaxies being carried out in other galaxies is demonstrated by the most recent contribution of _ spitzer _ irac * to our efforts to determine the properties of the sources described above ( see # 12058 , van bouwens ) . with these observations , it will be possible to confirm the properties of the bright end of the galaxy of @ xmath3 , as well as to determine the conditions for future targeted follow - up observations without having to wait for _ james webb space telescope _ . p , j , and jw contacted the steward observatory , where much of this work was carried out , for support of. this survey is also supported by the _ hst _ / _ 13767 , 12905 , and 12572 . this survey was funded by the australian research council centre of excellence for all -
