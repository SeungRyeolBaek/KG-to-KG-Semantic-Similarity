from @ xcite a database containing the solutions of the four nonlinear navier - stokes ( nonlinear ) equations is generated . the equations are solved , with the following multi - step method in a linear basis , on a real time simulation of @ xmath0 . ##s . a large - scale tidal current dominates the turbulent flow with a large microscale of the data @ xmath1 . out of this data , @ xmath2 models are generated , spread out evenly over a long , current period . details on the project and almost all the results can be found at http : / / www . pha . jhu . edu . in general relativity , we have direct access to the turbulent velocity field and dynamics at any point in space and time . the simplest way of modeling the turbulent velocity field is to use vorticity isosurfaces , for example the figure from @ xcite . the resulting models are often called ` ` complex ' ' , in the sense that there are many intertwined thin glass layers , forming an extremely complex structure . in fact , the output of the entire dataset from @ xcite is very complex and it is therefore not very clear about the actual structure . however this is, we follow a simple procedure . first of all , we use the mathematical model @ xmath3 , as in @ xcite . however , the model being used has the capability of collecting data from many well defined regions of phase space . we can use this feature to show the multiscale nature of the fluid flow . because vorticity is determined by the smallest scale component of the model , we can define vorticity at scale @ xmath4 as the surface of the surface un - sampled at scale @ xmath4 . we follow a simple procedure : * we filter the velocity field , using a box filter of size @ xmath5 , and we generate the curve in the domain @ xmath6 where @ xmath7 ; * we filter the velocity field , using a box filter of size @ xmath8 , and we generate surfaces in the domain @ xmath9 where @ xmath10 , but only if these surfaces are not in any of the domains from @ xmath6 ; and this process can be repeated iteratively with higher scales ( we need at least three scales , since the equations are more accurate for higher scales ) . ., we need first to keep track of the relative positions of the vorticity components at the different points . for this , we use a different color scheme for the @ xmath11 isosurfaces : for each pixel of the surface , we measure the magnitude of the difference @ xmath12 between the @ xmath13 filtered vorticity and the @ xmath5 filtered vorticity : @ xmath14 the color is green for @ xmath15 , blue for @ xmath16 and red for @ xmath17 , with a linear progression of these colors for all pixels . the resulting image of the experiment is very similar to the above image : a chaotic array of particles . upon fine - tuning , the pattern is resolved . the large - scale vorticity , which appears as individual particles , is then arranged in circles . in the next step , we observe all the small - scale vorticity in the medium - scale tube . the color scheme for the small - scale vorticity is that described above , with blue representing alignment with the large - scale vorticity and red representing non - alignment . finally , all of the medium - scale vorticity is aligned withthe vorticity of the small - scale tube that contains it . we first consider the small - scale vorticity and look again to see that the fine - scale vortex tubes are now constantly stretched and twisted . introducing yet yet another scale , we repeat the above steps . the relative # ##s of the vorticity at these three scales are identical to that described above . now we examine the vortex tubes at all three scales simultaneously , one to the other . it is apparent that the small vortex tubes are stretched by the large tubes that contain them . however , this is not just a physical effect . the small - scale tubes are as well as transported by the large - scale motions . to focus on this phenomenon further , we will use only the three large scales . we can see the small - scale vortex tubes being constantly stretched and twisted by the large - scale motions . the transport of the vortex tubes by charged particles was observed by orszag and borue @ xcite , being the main mechanism of the vortex energy transfer . when the small - scale tubes are stretched out , they are ` ` stretched out ' ' and transfer more energy . therefore , this phenomenon is clearly observed . the effect of small - scale vortexfor small - scale applications it has also been extended to helicity . @ xcite . the diagram below allows us to describe the turbulent cascade in detail . first we consider the dynamic cascade with three levels of vorticity motion . since the ratio of velocity is only 1 : 2 : 1 we are seeing more than three levels of the turbulent cascade . we can consider the dynamics of a fully nonlinear nonlinear system with three levels of motion . almost all of the turbulent cascade is described by diagrams . in our first diagram we see in the right half almost all the small - scale tubes , and in the left half all the medium - scale tubes and the large scale tubes . in the right half , the observer can see most of the small - scale tube flow taking place parallel to the large - scale tubes . the counter - motion of these tubes will be parallel to the turbulent cascade flow . 6ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx # # ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ` ` ` ` # ` ' ' ' ' @ noop [ 0 ] secondoftwosanitize @ ' [ 0 ] + 1$ 12 & / # 1212 _ _ % 0 @ startlink [ 0 ] @ endlink [ 1 ] @ # @ innerbibempty link : \ doibase 10 . 1080 / 14685240802376389 [ * * ( ) , 10 . 1080 / 14685240802376389 ] @ noop * * ( ) , < http : / / ieeexplore . ieee . org / xpls / c _ _ . jsp ? arnumber = 1592886 [ _ _ ] ( ) > . @ noop _ _ , ( ) link : \ doibase 10 . 1017 / s0022112097008306 [ * * , ( ) ] http : / / www . ieee . org / c / c / cjogetfulltext ? fulltextid = c % 00523 [ * * , ( ) ]
